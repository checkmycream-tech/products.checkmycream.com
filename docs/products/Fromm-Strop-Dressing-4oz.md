      <li>cream applied easily to leather gave it a nice soft pliable texture to the leather and the straiht razo rubs on the leather very smoothly for a nice fine edge.</li>
      <li>These quality straight razors really benefit from a great strop that is lubricated/dressed well.</li>
      <li>This stuff makes a huge diference.</li>
      <li>the smooth side of my strop</li>
      <li>It works like it supposed to, even though it is cheap and bottle print ink comes off when you touch it.</li>
      <li>Fantastic Amazon Trader / experience.</li>
      <li>The smooth side may never need recharging since..</li>
      <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve examined the stropped edges under a microscope, and most of them have finished up without fine chips - the exceptions being where I tried to work too fast, or let my mind wander when I was working.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Item was described exactly as I had received it, left my strop looking and feeling great after application.</li>
      <li>, one is still visible in the right light.</li>
      <li>this is what i did for the russian leather strop... and was most satisfied with the results...</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t have so many knives, and I don&#x27;t use my knives so frequently, that I use up a lot of dressing.</li>
      <li>The bottle size was nice for the money &amp; should last a quite some time.</li>
      <li>I put on a liberal coating and then keep rubbing till the leather has absorbed it all.</li>
      <li>From time to time wonder why people left straight razors for those new burn the face or more accurately scrap the top 15 layers of skin off the face safety razors.</li>
      <li>It has very clear instructions and is easy to use.</li>
      <li>I use the Fromm Strop Dressing to moisten the strops so the super fine diamond dust can distribute itself over the surface of each strop and present fresh dressing to the surface, as I work.  </li>
      <li>I have one older strop that I haven&#x27;t had to add dressing to in almost forever as I think it is full.</li>
      <li>exactly what it is supposed to do</li>
      <li>works better for me than untreated leathers or leathers that are treated with different products.</li>
      <li>It produces I nice surface on the rough side.</li>
      <li>The old one is like new now :)</li>
      <li>a large bottle was uneccessary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>really well.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t know much about strop dressing, so i figured I&#x27;d give it a try</li>
      <li>ready to shave &#x27;practice&#x27; razor),</li>
      <li>It comes at a reasonable price.</li>
      <li>You cannot tell how much is in the bottle.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;did not sharpen my straight razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Feeling kinda chafed from the expenses incurred in my straight razor foray, I was determined to try and rescue my strop.</li>
      <li>I use this dressing on my leather strops for finishing straight razors.</li>
      <li>It made fast work of tuning up my razor.</li>
      <li>and i cant tell if it really made a difference</li>
      <li>very supple now</li>
      <li>It works very well for this purpose.  </li>
      <li>You don&#x27;t need much</li>
      <li>It came in a dingy looking bottle, but who really cares.  </li>
      <li>But there is no comparison to how your beard/face feels after a straight razor shave.&lt;br</li>
      <li>From what i can tell it works as advertised, I would have given it 5 stars if you didn&#x27;t need so much to get the strop dressed.</li>
      <li>I gave a 5-star rating, but really, I would rate a product like strop paste in terms</li>
      <li>Works like it is supposed to, gets your strop nice and supple after a few applications.</li>
      <li>Gotta love a sharp knife!</li>
      <li>I love sharp knives, you will too!</li>

    <li> I use this dressing on my leather strops for finishing straight razors. I could have sworn that I got a bigger bottle last time I bought it but oh well.&lt;br /&gt;Good stuff. JR</li>
    <li> my strop feels amazing now!!!  and i took a shot and used it on the tongue of a new pair of combat boots and it loosened them rite up :P very supple now</li>
    <li> From what i can tell it works as advertised, I would have given it 5 stars if you didn&#x27;t need so much to get the strop dressed.</li>
    <li> I like this product.&lt;br /&gt;I have two strops.  One is charged with 1.0 micron diamond paste, the other with 0.5 micron diamond paste. I basically use the strops to polish the bevel and remove the wire edge as the last step of sharpening.  I use the Fromm Strop Dressing to moisten the strops so the super fine diamond dust can distribute itself over the surface of each strop and present fresh dressing to the surface, as I work.  It works very well for this purpose.  It also seems to keep the leather &amp;#34;healthier&amp;#34; and more supple, which makes it easier to remove the wire edge without chipping.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve examined the stropped edges under a microscope, and most of them have finished up without fine chips - the exceptions being where I tried to work too fast, or let my mind wander when I was working.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll buy another bottle of Fromm 1907 when I run out, but I expect that to be at least several years.  I don&#x27;t have so many knives, and I don&#x27;t use my knives so frequently, that I use up a lot of dressing.</li>
    <li> This is good stuff! I&#x27;ve shaved with electric shaver, with multiple blades (Trak 2, 3, whatever), and now I&#x27;m using a straight razor. It takes more time in preparation of edge and in preparation and shaving of face, but it is meditative. I can&#x27;t complain about the shave - it is the closest I&#x27;ve ever had. Actually, a little too close once or twice. But there is no comparison to how your beard/face feels after a straight razor shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The honing of the blade took me a long time (I bought a &amp;#34;not ready to shave &#x27;practice&#x27; razor), but now I have a keen edge that has held for 3 weeks so far with only stropping before the shave. These quality straight razors really benefit from a great strop that is lubricated/dressed well. This stuff is good!!</li>
    <li> This works great. I&#x27;ve used it on a new and old strop. The old one is like new now :)</li>
    <li> great seller I recommend</li>
    <li> Good product. Can&#x27;t give 5 stars because it was not amazing. Yes it conditioned the leather but it does so the same as others. The bottle size was nice for the money &amp; should last a quite some time.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. I put on a liberal coating and then keep rubbing till the leather has absorbed it all. this takes a fair bit of time but I only use a small 4x4 cloth and it soaks it up and then keeps reapplying it as I go. This can make the cheapest driest strop lay down and smooth out for days and days. I have one older strop that I haven&#x27;t had to add dressing to in almost forever as I think it is full. Still It is one of my best strops.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;dray</li>
    <li> Product does what it says. Good price and timely shipping. Another satisfied customer. I have used this once and seems to do the job.</li>
    <li> Really good product. Will last a long time. After 3 applications my new strop was almost perfectly treated. Great product and would high;y recommend.</li>
    <li> It made my  strop super awesome!!! I didn&#x27;t check the size of the bottle, but i expected to be bigger.</li>
    <li> I have nothing at all to complain about this product. Worked great on my strop and there&#x27;s nothing wrong with this product. The only thing that could be improved really is if it stropped my razor for me.</li>
    <li> It came in a dingy looking bottle, but who really cares.  This made my stop really soft, I was surprised by its performance.</li>
    <li> I use this on all of my strops. I only use a straight razor to shave with. I will stick to my straight razors and the strop dressing helps keep my razors in good shape and reduces the number of times I have to hone them. It was just a eccentric chose I made.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  From time to time wonder why people left straight razors for those new burn the face or more accurately scrap the top 15 layers of skin off the face safety razors. I dislike electrics even more. If they don&#x27;t give razor burn, or pinch into the skin as it pulls out hairs; turn the hair and skin it collects into a fine powder that sticks to everything and has an odd smell that takes all day to get rid of.</li>
    <li> before using a new strop, apply this conditioner first and allow to dry overnight... this is what i did for the russian leather strop... and was most satisfied with the results... a little goes a long way</li>
    <li> Dressing works wet on strops, which you would think it would clean the strop, however, it does not clean or prep a strop for using.</li>
    <li> This product is designed to condition the leather on the strop. It has very clear instructions and is easy to use. It comes at a reasonable price.</li>
    <li> This product works well to condition your strop. Works as advertised. Not much else to say about a product like this.</li>
    <li> This stuff is really great. It made my strop soft. You don&#x27;t need much at all withc is great because the point of straight razor shaveing is to use less and spend less in the long term. I stroped a few times with no dressing. This stuff makes a huge diference. If you are just starting out order some with your first strop it improves the strop enough that you won&#x27;t want to get started without it.</li>
    <li> Works as intended as long as you follow the directions.</li>
    <li> Excellent.  My strop had dried ends due to non use. But talk about revitalized. Now it&#x27;s like new. Thanks that is, to Fromm&#x27;s Strop Dressing.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for a great product.&lt;br /&gt;Mark in&lt;br /&gt;Ky.</li>
    <li> Not much to say. This strop dressing works well for conditioning your strop.</li>
    <li> exactly what it is supposed to do</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t seem to contain any superfine abrasive as a strop dressing should but did condition the leather strop quite nicely.</li>
    <li> I  received just what I was looking for and works as described. And with prompt shipping.</li>
    <li> This dressing works wonderfully on my leather razor strop.  Very happy, does exactly what it should.  Gotta love a sharp knife!</li>
    <li> Applied two coats of this to my new strop. Applied one coat...waited 24 hours and applied another. Seems to have softened up the leather some. I did not want to make it to soft so I am satisfied with the results.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m nuts over this product!  At this price!  It seems to last forever in the strop!&lt;br /&gt;II cut a 1 5/8ths  strop from 11-13 oz then wet it as if I were planing to carve or imprint it.  Then it is VITALLY IMPORTANT to allow the strop to dry out to a firm but still damp consistency.  Then, using a sponge, lightly wet the surface again to open up the pores.  It cannot be too wet or yo will creat imperfections in the smooth straight surface of the leather.  At this point I put a medium to almost generous amount of this treatment on the ROUGH side of the leather.  This is going to be your go-to side for touching up your blade throughout the day as you use your blade.  In leather carving I tend to run my edge down my strop *at the angle of the cutting edge* after every cut* a thousand or more times per day!, to keep it cutting smoothly.&lt;br /&gt;On the smooth side of my strop I use either 12,000 or 20,000 grit (.4 micron) mixed with a homemade cream, depending on whether the strop is for razor knives or for heavily bladed tools like leather carving blades.&lt;br /&gt;This strop will remain active and useful (if you don&#x27;t accidentally nick and slice it or deform it...) for many years.  The smooth side may never need recharging since..well..diamonds are forever..(but eventually they sneak down into the leather and can&#x27;t reach your blade).&lt;br /&gt;But recharge the From Strop Dressing side once per several months to a year if you run your blades like me at about 1000 strokes per day. To a year.  Using a quality product like this ensures your strop can last for decades and be enjoyed by the next generation.</li>
    <li> I gave a 5-star rating, but really, I would rate a product like strop paste in terms of- does it work, or does it not? This stuff does. If you need it, get it.</li>
    <li> Softens the leather, allows the leather to \\&quot;grab\\&quot; the bevel of the blade better.  Does what it is supposed to do.  One bottle will last a long time, probably for the life of the strop.</li>
    <li> This dressing and a Razor Strop and you are on your way to a sharp knife.  Just be sure your family knows you have sharpened those knifes as this will leave an edge like a scalpel.  I sharpened a knife for my brother in law and couldn&#x27;t stop him from testing the blade with his finger tip.  Needless to say he doesn&#x27;t do that any more with knifes I give him.</li>
    <li> I buy this for my husband who is a shaving addict.  He says it is simply the best dressing out there for men who strop.  One bottle lasts a long time, too.</li>
    <li> made my leather lay flat and relaxed the leather for its intended purposes. this was a suggestion from the site to use to keep the leather from cracking overtime use.</li>
    <li> Small and i cant tell if it really made a difference</li>
    <li> Rip off just use shaving cream</li>
    <li> OK I guess haven&#x27;t used it.</li>
    <li> Use with strop leather.</li>
    <li> It re-freshened my  razor strop  &amp; made it like new.</li>
    <li> Alright, here&#x27;s what I did: I got into straight razor shaving by buying a stupid expensive razor (Hart) and equally stupid expensive strop (Mountain Mike). Within 6 months the strop was almost ruined. It was peppered with nicks and slits and scrapes. I looked into replacing the strop and, in my searching, also read about strop repair/refurbishing.  Feeling kinda chafed from the expenses incurred in my straight razor foray, I was determined to try and rescue my strop. I bought some 3M ultrafine sanding blocks from an automotive store (800-1000, and 1000-1200) and buffed the nicks and scrapes out, well, almost out, one is still visible in the right light. And then I applied Fromm dressing...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My strop is almost new again. No joke. I&#x27;ll periodically apply the dressing and I&#x27;ll be much more precise with my stropping. 4 oz of the dressing should last years, I hope my strop makes it that long.</li>
    <li> Good for strops.  Wipe on, allow to dry, they say.  I wonder about the moisture content&#x27;s impact on carbon steel blades, but a subsequent wipedown should quell any of those concerns.  The bottle is cheap plastic and mine cracked after little use, although the product was still usable.  Would get it again.</li>
    <li> I have an old Rolls Razor. Works well.</li>
    <li> The price for this product is far less for the quantity than many other strop dressings. I works well to keep the leather supple, and should last a very long time.</li>
    <li> does what its supposed to</li>
    <li> Fromm dressing cream is one of the secrets to the sharpest raziors and knives! If you use this stuff to maintain your edged tools, you will not only have extremely sharp cutting instruments, you wont have to hone has often. Good stuff, and well worth the price!</li>
    <li> As advertised and described, this is a &amp;#34;must&amp;#34; for the proper maintenance of any strop. I find it to be efficient, cleansing and a necessary part of keeping my razor sharp and shave ready.</li>
    <li> I used the product as directed and am not experienced enough with a razor strop to fairly judge its effectiveness.  It seems expensive for what you get, but one container should last a long time.</li>
    <li> Except that it does it&#x27;s job really well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I encourage readers to look at how many ounces this bottle contains. The picture gave me the impression the bottle was much larger. It&#x27;s actually a small bottle. Had the product not done it&#x27;s job so well I&#x27;d be very angry. A little does seem to go a long way so in my opinion a large bottle was uneccessary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all it earned it&#x27;s five stars.</li>
    <li> I used it with the chromium oxide. It made fast work of tuning up my razor. Just what I need for the job.</li>
    <li> Hydrates the leather and helps break in a new strop. Buy this to keep your strop from drying out. Just re apply when it starts looking pale.</li>
    <li> does what it should and does it well.</li>
    <li> Dressing did not work on my strop.  I used it twice as directed and my strop&lt;br /&gt;did not sharpen my straight razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dressing is a semi liquid.  You cannot tell how much is in the bottle.  It comes&lt;br /&gt;out in a goo like mess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend that bottle be clear to see how much dressing is in it.</li>
    <li> Really helps my strop now that I&#x27;ve had a chance to use it works great</li>
    <li> it is ok ended up using neatfoot</li>
    <li> what can I say, it&#x27;s strop dressing, works into the leather nicely and keeps it good and limber.</li>
    <li> cream applied easily to leather gave it a nice soft pliable texture to the leather and the straiht razo rubs on the leather very smoothly for a nice fine edge.</li>
    <li> this is for strops when they become hard and not flexible. it will make your leather supple and will increase draw</li>
    <li> Used this to softens the leather on some of my strops, work great, not messy or greasy. A little goes a long ways.</li>
    <li> I have an old Wagners strop I found at an antique store and used baseball glove leather conditioner to restore it, along with saddle soap. I use this now every once in a while when I see the leather on the strop start to harden or get dry. It works like it supposed to, even though it is cheap and bottle print ink comes off when you touch it.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t know much about strop dressing, so i figured I&#x27;d give it a try&lt;br /&gt;just to see what it could do. Come to find it, its some very nice stuff.&lt;br /&gt;I like it, because it takes the leather to a nice condition where the stropping in&lt;br /&gt;my opinion becomes more effective. The blade feels almost as if its lubricated&lt;br /&gt;when gliding over the leather</li>
    <li> works well with the new strop I bought.</li>
    <li> chose a cheaper strop and the dressing increased the drag and cleans the polished metal off the leather very well.</li>
    <li> I received this dressing and I started using it as per recommended instructions. I liked the fact that it did not leave a messy and oily mess on my strop. i highly recommend this dressing. good choice for sharpening razors.</li>
    <li> My son was impressed that I thought to get a strop dressing as part of his Christmas gift package. I&#x27;m anxious to hear how he likes using it this year.</li>
    <li> Item was described exactly as I had received it, left my strop looking and feeling great after application. Great product and I def recommend.</li>
    <li> Just takes a little bit to go a long ways, have used it several times on my strop and still have some left! Just put a drop or two on your stop, rub it in with a good clean rag and let it sit for a day, your razor will love you and your face will love your razor.</li>
    <li> The dressing arrived on schedule and was appropriately packaged.  I am still a novice at sharpening and stropping and thus it is a bit difficult for me to rate the quality of the product.  I have applied it to one strop and it left the leather much firmer than I expected.  The surface of the strop is now rather slick and stiff.  I will need to continue to experiment and use different techniques before deciding if a strop that is dressed with this product works better for me than untreated leathers or leathers that are treated with different products.</li>
    <li> Took my dried out strop into something much more useable. I like that it isncreased the draw a little too.</li>
    <li> It is a leather conditioner. If you have a Strop belt my husband recommends this product. He did the instructions as directed and it works</li>
    <li> Good product and covers real well .</li>
    <li> Works great for my Strop/</li>
    <li> Great product, works well.</li>
    <li> I used this on an old strop my grandfather gave me that was hard, rigid and had TONS of crap on it.  He was a professional barber who did shaves for a long long time.  The strop He gave me had been sitting around in a box in the closet for about 20 years and it was just about useless.  It wouldn&#x27;t get an edge to shave.  I decided to try some of this strop paste on it before I dropped the money on a new one.  Well... this stuff worked AMAZING!!!  It cleaned it up to where it looked dang near brand new.  It stained a little, but I think it&#x27;s because I applied it wrong and left it sitting for too long.  I just put a few dabs on a paper towel and rubbed it down.  This strop paste got all those years of crap off of it and turned it back into a good, workable strop.  Just because the strop was in such bad shape, I had to go over it about 10 times.</li>
    <li> Seems to soften leather nicely.  Used it on a baseball glove too.  No problems.</li>
    <li> Does what it&#x27;s supposed to do - moisturizes your razor strop and keeps it performing well for a long time (might use once a year?)</li>
    <li> I purchased this along with several other items for a gift for my husband. He says its a must have in any shaving kit.</li>
    <li> I use this to soften the leather on my knife strop. After it has been on over night, I use green buffing compound on the belt. My knives are razor sharp or sharper. I love sharp knives, you will too! My wife on the other hand gripes about how sharp the knives are. Mostly after she cuts herself.</li>
    <li> Fantastic Amazon Trader / experience. Highly Reccomend.</li>
    <li> Helps keep the razor sharp!</li>
    <li> Does what it is supposed to do. I use it on an old leather belt. It produces I nice surface on the rough side. I am pleased with this purchase.</li>
    <li> Excellent Transaction. AAA+++</li>
    <li> I feel this product will go a long way to support the function and lifetime of the strop that I will apply this to.</li>
    <li> Works like it is supposed to, gets your strop nice and supple after a few applications. BE WARNED: Do NOT get this stuff on your straight razor, it will tarnish steel almost instantly. Should come with a warning.</li>
    <li> Makes a big difference. Brought an old strip back from death&#x27;s door!</li>
