<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Really amazing, love it!</li>
    <li> My wife likes the original better.</li>
    <li> I may like this fragrance even more than the original Daisy scent. I&#x27;m usually not one for these warm floral perfumes, but there is something about Daisy Eau So Fresh that I just love. It&#x27;s playful, feminine, and fun. I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> My absolute favorite.  I get soooo many compliments its insane!</li>
    <li> My gfs favorite, so of course it went over well!</li>
    <li> Smells great.  Wife loves it</li>
    <li> Love this fragrance!!!! It&#x27;s light floral, but lasts nicely. My daugher in law did not like it, but I love it. It is the same price as in my local Macy&#x27;s store.</li>
    <li> Wonderful scent and beautiful gift bottle!</li>
    <li> Lady friend loved it. She&#x27;s happy I&#x27;m happy.</li>
    <li> Beautiful scent.  Light and feminine.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s the real deal stuff. I saved $30 by buying it here than in Sephora. It is my fav perfume.</li>
    <li> Great Buy very satisfied with my purchase</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s Amazing! I love the delicate smell that&#x27;s not over powering. Very bright and crisp for the perfect summer perfume.</li>
    <li> Nice and refreshing! Very close to one of the Armani, which they discontinued some time ago.</li>
    <li> This is the freshest scent EVER!!!  I can always count on any and ALL of the Daisy products!!!  Love the body lotion as well as the bath gel.  Marc Jacobs is a genius!</li>
    <li> My favorite perfume and the shipping was fast. Love it!!</li>
    <li> Amazing scent, great price and this huge bottle will last so long! Definitely worth buying over cheaper perfumes. Shipped quickly and a better price that I could find at Macy&#x27;s or Dillard&#x27;s.</li>
    <li> Money well spent. Smells fresh. Lasts long but not overpowering.</li>
    <li> Started using this fragrance only recently in the form of the rollerball variety. Of course it&#x27;s almost gone. I&#x27;m addicted. Was able to purchase at a price on Amazon that beats the brick/mortar retailers. Really happy with!</li>
    <li> I was looking for something to replace my Dolce and Gabanna Light Blue... this is perfect. I love how it smells, so fresh and clean! Lasts all day. Great price.</li>
    <li> Marc Jacobs Daisy Eau So Fresh Eau de Toilette was a gift for my daughter.  It is her signature scent so she couldn&#x27;t have been more pleased.  I love giving gifts that people really want and this was it and at a great price !  Thank you Amazon for coming through again.</li>
    <li> My view is as much as this perfume you shouldn&#x27;t have to apply twice daily or should last all day.</li>
    <li> Arrived right on time and exactly what I expected. I was very pleased.</li>
    <li> Amazing deal great product. I must admit I had my doubts about ordering my favorite perfume online but I couldn&#x27;t be more happy with the price and product. Thank you amazon</li>
    <li> This was exactly what I had just looked at in 2 other stores and was priced at 90.00 bucks in one and only 5 dollars cheaper in the next store .. So finding it on here at almost half the price was super !! Great buy and very happy !!</li>
    <li> I took my Mom to JCPenney&#x27;s and we tested MANY perfumes... she ended up liking a few, so I went back and smelled the favorites again. I ended up with this one because it absolutely captured my Mom - refreshing, bright, summery, and warm. It wasn&#x27;t overly floral, it isn&#x27;t so light that it wears away in 15 minutes... she&#x27;s found that it lasts long and she gets many compliments when she has it on. Overall, I think this made for a GREAT gift - if it wasn&#x27;t her new signature smell, I&#x27;d buy one of my own! BTW - Mom is 45 yrs old, I&#x27;m 23. I&#x27;d say it really suits a vast age range :P</li>
    <li> I bought  this product for my wife as a gift for Christmas. She love&#x27;s the scent and the bottle it came in, it&#x27;s great.</li>
    <li> Smells amazing !!!! Bought this for my mom for her birthday and she loved it !!!! Had to buy more ! Definitely much cheaper then in store</li>
    <li> I bought this one after trying it in a store and falling in love with this lovely, light-hearted fragrance. It is perfect for warmer weather. If you already love the original Daisy, give this one a try. Super cute bottle too!</li>
    <li> Finally a different perfume that I love, I always tend to wear the same one, this is perfect! thanks marc jacobs</li>
    <li> I have purchased other Marc Jacobs Daisy scents, but I bought this one without testing the scent. It arrived today and I love this scent. It has a flowery fruity aroma. I would order this again.</li>
    <li> Great scent. Cheaper than some of tge competition. The daisy dream fragranve is also great!</li>
    <li> I wanted to get a perfume for my wife on her 30th B-day.  She mentioned Marc jACOBS perfume once. I put it away in my menory bank.  I have to say she was totally excited and sprayed in on her body after she opened it.  All her cousins and sisters got jealous.  I felt like I had just earned some Man points.  About the Perfume, well balanced not over-powering, hella sexy and the Cap is a conversation piece.  I will be getting this for her again.pho show</li>
    <li> I just got this for Christmas. Smells wonderful! My mom ordered the 4.20 ounce bottle and we were both surprised at how huge it is! I&#x27;ve worn the perfume every day since I got it and I love it! It&#x27;s a light, fresh scent that is not overpowering at all. I will definitely buy more if this bottle ever runs out, which doesn&#x27;t seem likely any time soon. (Also, I am a lady using my husband&#x27;s Amazon account. That&#x27;s why the name is kind of strange.)</li>
    <li> I get a lot of compliments with this perfume. I, personally, also really love it. It isn&#x27;t too heavy and doesn&#x27;t overwhelm. Nice light pleasant scent. It has become &amp;#34;my scent.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> Came in original packaging and is authentic. Great smell! I love this purfume and so does my husband! Was such a great deal that I will definitely be back to purchase again!</li>
    <li> Wife likes it so if she is happy than i&#x27;m happy</li>
    <li> Smells amazing, I receive many compliments, it lasts a long time</li>
    <li> Couldn&#x27;t have found a better price! In love with the flowery scent of this perfume.</li>
    <li> Okay....is there anyone else out there that thinks that the under tone of this perfume smells like RAID??  I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s a fake, but maybe Daisy perfume is just not for me. I swear this perfume smells like RAID.</li>
    <li> Not sure I&#x27;m the one that should be reviewing this product, however my daughter seems to love Marc products.  This was first on her Christmas list and was very over joyed when she opened her package.</li>
    <li> I purchase this perfume as a surprise for my wife, Marc Jacobs her favorite designer by far so you could imagine when she opened and found his perfume staring back at her. The promptness and quality of this product has been exceptional. All in all as long my wife is over joyed I&#x27;m a super satisfied customer.</li>
    <li> Mom loved it. Got it for her. Fresh summery scent. Beautiful bottle. Arrived perfectly packed without any unbroken seal. Totally original.</li>
    <li> Package was sealed and brand new. As described.</li>
    <li> I bought this perfume for my mother on her Bday. It is the first very expensive scent she was ever given. It&#x27;s not her signature scent (Clinque:Happy is whats she&#x27;s known for wearing everyday) but it&#x27;s mine and I thought with me being away from home for college this is a good way to have me around.</li>
    <li> 100% satisfied! Great fragrance. Amazing price. Thank you.</li>
    <li> Smells great. The scent doesn&#x27;t last as long as I would like but you get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> It smells AMAZING!! Totally love it. The whole process of purchasing was simple and quick. The quality of the product was great! And the price: perfect! Couldn&#x27;t have gotten a better deal anywhere else! It came nicely packaged (in original box and sealed) and bubble wrapped for extra protection. Thanks AMAZON!</li>
    <li> I have to hide this from my granddaughter when she comes over, :&amp;#62;)  I have one hidden for her birthday soon!</li>
    <li> I love this perfume. It smells so good!  It&#x27;s my absolute favorite.  It&#x27;s not too overpowering but has a very pretty, light smell.  Definitely a great gift idea! I&#x27;m a 29 year old and I love it. I also bought this for my 50 year old mother-in-law and she loves it as well.  It&#x27;s the kind of perfume that women of all ages can appreciate.</li>
    <li> Love, love this cologne! And the price through Amazon!</li>
    <li> This perfume smells wonderful, but it doesn&#x27;t last long</li>
    <li> The scent last about 10 minutes.  The smell is great but reminds me of a body splash instead of a eau-de-toilette spray.  I would return if I could.</li>
    <li> Gift for a friend that loved it!</li>
    <li> I love it it smells so good and its the real thing I was afraid that it wouldn&#x27;t be the right thing imitation.  Very pleased</li>
    <li> I loooove this beautiful ,fresh scent! I have received many compliments already and I have just begun to wear it!</li>
    <li> This has become my newest favorite perfume that comes packaged as beautifully as it smells. A wonderful gift to give to someone you care about, or to keep for yourself.</li>
    <li> This perfume, I can&#x27;t even smell it; I sprayed it on and for the first 2 seconds you can smell it and then afterwards nothing, no scent.  This is not the real thing.</li>
    <li> I first sniffed this beautiful scent in 2011. Since then I have purchased 2 more bottles. I love fruity, sweet scents that are still fresh and have some mystery in them. This is the perfect fit. I have tried the other Daisies (eau de perfume, eau de toilette), but this one is the winner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you like Escada summer scents, CK Euphoria, Lancome La vie est belle and are looking for a summer scent... THIS IS THE ONE!</li>
    <li> This perfume smells great!  It is light, not too heavy, but others have commented to me that they could smell it long after I had gotten used to it and couldn&#x27;t smell it much.  I&#x27;ve gotten more compliments!  Even though it is Daisy, it isn&#x27;t a strong flowery smell.  It&#x27;s fresh and clean with a good scent.</li>
    <li> Exactly what it said it was</li>
    <li> The smell of the perfume has the perfect not-to light and not-to strong smell. Also the bottle is huge! :)&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this to someone else.</li>
    <li> my favorite perfume my wife wears. Great price, paid more at a local store for a smaller amount.</li>
    <li> I love this fragrance! It is becoming one of my favorites and I have A LOT of perfumes. I don&#x27;t know why I didn&#x27;t discover this sooner, but when I did, I was torn between this and the original Daisy. Both of them are great. This one has a little bit softer scent. It&#x27;s perfect for daytime use, but I love it so much I wear it whenever. I also get compliments frequently. Only downside is that it seems to fade on my skin, but areas where it gets on my clothes last a lot longer.</li>
    <li> Bigger bottle for $30 less than store price.</li>
    <li> This is my third or fourth bottle of this perfume and my first time purchasing from Amazon. This is the real deal! No worries here. It smells amazing as always. I am no stranger to high end perfumes. I&#x27;ve owned many. MANY! This is by far my favorite and it is the one I get complimented on the most. Some people say it doesn&#x27;t last, but that is not true. I can put this on in the morning and still get complimented in the evening. I do not smell it after the first couple hours, but everyone else does. I&#x27;ve also seen reviews where people state it is a fake, and I cannot speak for them. I just always make sure the seller I purchase from is Amazon, not another seller. It should say &amp;#34;ships from and sold by Amazon&amp;#34; under the price. I do not choose other sellers to save a couple bucks. I&#x27;m not saying there is anything wrong with that. I just don&#x27;t do it when it comes to fragrance and beauty products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a beautiful fragrance!</li>
    <li> Love this. Worth the money!!</li>
    <li> I LOVE this scent from Marc Jacobs. Of all of the Marc Jacobs perfumes, this is by far my favorite! The scent is so sweet and fresh. It has a fruity scent that isn&#x27;t too strong or overwhelming. If you&#x27;re looking for a perfume to wear during the Spring or Summer, you definitely need to try this one! You&#x27;ll love it!</li>
    <li> Exactly what was expected!</li>
    <li> Absolutely love it, and would highly recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nice large sized bottle, priced fairly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Delivery too was prompt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very Happy with this!</li>
    <li> I love this sent. It&#x27;s my new favorite and was much cheaper than the $97 one at a perfume shop or department store.</li>
    <li> I love this perfume ! I hate strong scented perfumes that leave you with a headache. This perfume  has a soft not over powering scent that leaves you smelling clean !</li>
    <li> Love the smell !  Cheaper than I&#x27;ve found anywhere else.</li>
    <li> Love this perfume so much! It was so much cheaper here than in stores!!</li>
    <li> The perfume is great, beautiful as described in the picture. The package is also really secure and well sealed! And the smell is exactly as the one in the store. It reminds me of the fresh but light smell of spring morning. Sweet but light and fresh smell. Amazon saves me lots of money! Only one thing that doesn&#x27;t really satisfy me is that the smell doesn&#x27;t stay really long. I spray it in the morning and 2 hours later, it almost disappears. I don&#x27;t know, maybe I&#x27;m too sensitive with it?</li>
    <li> Light and Refreshing!! Love it!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s my grand-daughters Xmas gift, she&#x27;s going to love it.</li>
    <li> One of the best fragrances out in the market today!  MARC JACOBS is a great designer....and this DAISY EAU SO FRESH is another one of my very favorites.  What was very surprising to me....is that AMAZON has such wonderful and great prices!  I was stunned.  I don&#x27;t think I will do to much retail for fragrances again.  WOW!  I have to admit I was very surprised.  GREAT collection  of MARC JACOBS available at AMAZON....but WOW,.....what a collection of many of my favorite designer fragrances at a great price, each and every one of them.  My other all time favorite is ESCADA!!!!</li>
    <li> It is perfect size and the price was awesome . I would highly recommend this to my friends and family and any readers out there.</li>
    <li> This is the second time that I purchased a perfume on Amazon and it is obviously a fake. First one was by Dolce and Gabbana &amp;#34;Light blue&amp;#34; and now this one. Both of them last about 1-2 minutes, then you can&#x27;t smell them at all...I&#x27;m very disappointed and I doubt that after spending good money on both perfumes I&#x27;ll ever purchase another one...</li>
    <li> This is one of the best scents ever! Light and fresh but also lasting through the day. I use it all the time and get so many compliments. Some people have even thought it was my shampoo that smelled so good but it was Marc! Great for young or older women.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this since I received it and I love the smell.  It&#x27;s so soft, yet lasts.  The smell is very very pretty. I love it.</li>
    <li> This perfume is a lighter smell than some of the other Marc Jacobs perfumes. It has a slight floral smell but it wears like a light clean smell. It lasts all day and you do not need to spray more than 2 pumps in the morning or you&#x27;ll be choking everyone around you in floral notes.</li>
    <li> The first perfume I received leaked all over the box and ruined the lid to the perfume and about an 1/8 of it was missing. I informed amazon and two days later I received a new one in perfect condition. They apologized probably about five times.</li>
    <li> Daisy Eau So Fresh is one of my favorite perfumes and I wear it friequently. I usually purchase it from the department stores however, because I am attending school outside of the country, I decided to go to Amazon to purchase the perfume. Upon receiving the product, I could instantly tell that the smell was &#x27;off&#x27; from what I was accustomed to. If you&#x27;re familiar with the scent, you&#x27;d be able to pick up on it. In addition, unlike those bought in the department stores which I put on in the morning and receive compliments throughout the day, this one does not last long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At this price point, you are better off forking over the extra $20 and buying it from the dept. store where you know you&#x27;ll get a product of quality and will be completely satisfied. I&#x27;d pay extra for no gimmicks/the real deal.</li>
    <li> This perfume caused severe allergy symptoms. I have tested this perfume in shopping malls before and never had any issues but when I started using this bottle I started having severe dizziness and nausea.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a 41st wedding present for my wife when we were on a cruise. It reminded me of when I first met her; fresh smell, a little sweet but child-like. And the bottle is a reminder of springtime, when we first met.</li>
    <li> Finally came in the mail extremely late but Amazon has credit my account for this bogus perfume. Watered down - there is no smell to it and I highly recommend you do not order from this site. The product is not good I have had Daisy perfume before and this is not it.</li>
    <li> I ADORE this scent!!!  It&#x27;s young and fresh and spunky!!!  I can&#x27;t tell you more about it...would love to bathe in it all day, every day!</li>
    <li> Made my partner happy</li>
    <li> i like this perfume, bought it for my wife. A+++++</li>
    <li> This perfume smells so good ! I&#x27;ll definitely buy this product again</li>
    <li> odor won&#x27;t last long enough!!</li>
    <li> The only reason that I am giving this perfume three stars is because the customer service that I recieved from Amazon was excellent. But unfortunelty the perfume only lasts for maybe a minute and then the scent goes away right away. I thought maybe it was the perfume, but I went to another store and I tried it on there. The smell lasted for almost the whole day. So next time I will not be buying a perfume from Amazon. I will just buy it from a department store even though Amazon did give me a rebate for it.</li>
    <li> Great fragrance and value, second purchase.</li>
    <li> I loved this perfum. It is floral, the bottle is gorgeous and the company that sell it to me was very fast and very good.</li>
    <li> Smell is good, but doesn&#x27;t last very long. Seems like the smell stayed longer when used at a store. I&#x27;ve heard other people complain about the same thing.</li>
    <li> I will not say \\&quot;THIS IS FAKE\\&quot; but it does not smell. I purchased perfumes from amazon may times and this time I&#x27;m really surprised. It is not a few hours, just a few seconds it smells on me. Then nothing. Unbelievable.</li>
    <li> Best perfume ever! It&#x27;s so feminine and delicate, and will never overwhelm anyone around you. I&#x27;ve gotten lots of compliments on it.</li>
    <li> Light and fresh, perfect for every day wear.</li>
    <li> Definitely it is not my favorite, its  scent is so soft that I barely  smell it. I can not deny that it smells very tasty but I have to spray me a lot.</li>
    <li> the product is what i expect. The only reason why i didn&#x27;t give it a 5 star, was the delivery time. it took so long i even forgot i had ordered it. besides that very pleased.</li>
    <li> Great perfume came earlier than expected</li>
    <li> This is one of my all-time favorite fragrances.  This fragrance is light, feminine, clean &amp; fresh. smelling.  I highly recommend Marc Jacob&#x27;s Daisy.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very satisfied with this product as well as the purchase process!  I would recommend it whomever is looking to purchase!</li>
    <li> I first got a whiff of this perfume a few months back on a trip abroad, and haven&#x27;t been able to get it off my mind since then. I finally decided to buy it on Amazon - best price out there, BTW - and I&#x27;ve got to say, of all the perfumes I own (and I own a good number), this is hands-down the best fragrance ever!!</li>
    <li> After trying numerous fragrances while looking for a nice, light, fresh, clean fragrance - This is the one!  Love how it smells on me - not overpowering but pleasantly there!!&lt;br /&gt;  Anyone who enjoys a subtle fresh fragrance will be most please with this one!  I AM!!!</li>
    <li> I love this fragrance.  Worth every penny.  On my third bottle in a year.</li>
    <li> From the fist time I Tried it , I culd not stop using it !!! Really nice Fragance and very Fresh</li>
    <li> Great price for a great product! Id buy it again in a heartbeat. It arrived sooner than expected in the exact condition it was promised. I&#x27;m very satisfied with this purchase</li>
    <li> Bought this for my lady...it smelled just as bomb as it did in Macy&#x27;s...but for a way better price</li>
    <li> If you like fresh &amp; flowers you&#x27;ll love So Fresh! The summery fresh flowery smell is delightful and smells beautiful.</li>
    <li> Excited. Product arrived ahead of time and it smells great.  Will order from them again</li>
    <li> Love it.  Smells like the real deal!!!</li>
    <li> I ordered this perfume after smelling it on a waitress at a restaurant. Though it is true that perfume scents change on different people, but it is absolutely fabulous! It had a nice fresh scent and a fun bottle. I get compliments everywhere I go!</li>
    <li> I gave this to my wife on her birthday and since then it has been her favorite perfume. I have always loved floral scents on women and I think this one matches my wife and her personality. I love smelling this on her... It makes her more beautiful and more confident. It&#x27;s perfect.</li>
    <li> I really enjoy this perfume and have gotten a lot of compliments on it.  I am also a Daisy wearer... both of these fragrances are wonderful!</li>
    <li> I really enjoy the smell of this perfume. I will be wearing it all the time. In addition to the great smell, it came in record timing! Within 2 days of the order the package arrived at my house.</li>
    <li> Bought this perfume for my mother for her birthday.  It is her favorite scent.  I won&#x27;t attempt to describe it, but she and everyone she works with seem to love it.  Lasts all day, but can be overpowering.</li>
    <li> This is my absolute fav!!! I use it everyday....I can spray a lot of the fragrance and it won&#x27;t be over powering.</li>
    <li> Marc Jacobs Daisy Toilette Spray was exactly what I expected.  I&#x27;m really enjoying the fragrance - especially for Spring time.</li>
    <li> I sent it to my daughter and she loved it! I chose this because it is very fresh but elegant.&lt;br /&gt;She gets many compliments from her friends and even strangers.</li>
    <li> Very Good!!! I love it!</li>
    <li> Love this perfume was glad to find it for a better price on amazon! If you love the soft, sweet smells. You will love this fragrance can&#x27;t go wrong</li>
    <li> I love buying this for my girl.  It smells wonderful and she likes it to.</li>
    <li> Love it.  Great price</li>
    <li> I love the fraguance of the Daisy... nice and fresh in the mornings last me all day. I recommended to anyone..</li>
    <li> Came very quickly!! Exactly how described. Love the smell, very fresh. Thank you!</li>
    <li> Love the sent and love the bottle! BE careful taking off the flower the first time though. Maybe I was a little excited and took it off to fast but the spray part flew off! I found it but it was a little annoying. But I&#x27;m happy even so!</li>
    <li> My favorite! I love the smell and shipping was speedy.</li>
    <li> The real deal! I always get compliments when wearing this fragrance.</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my wife on Mother&#x27;s day and she loves it. She previously used victoria secret body sprays and Daisy was a great upgrade.</li>
    <li> My wife loves this perfume. Very pleasant fragrance. Came in a factory sealed box and was a great value for the price.</li>
    <li> I bought this perfume for my 15-year-old granddaughter last Christmas.  She loves it.  Requested it again this Christmas.  Done deal!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love the smell.  I used to have the original Daisy in the black bottle and I loved that smell as well, but this one is so much lighter I just love it!  As does everyone that smells it on me.</li>
    <li> One of my favorites for the summer.</li>
    <li> I had heard and was very curious about this scent.  I asked around and received varying descriptions.  Thought I&#x27;d give it a try and this is my new everyday spray.  I absolutely love the fresh scent.  I absolutely recommend Daisy Eau So Fresh to all!</li>
    <li> This perfume&#x27;s scent brings people to ask me what I am wearing , the biggest compliment ever.  When they have to ask it means you are not wearing what everyone else is and that means it is special and expensive but yet the price isn&#x27;t .  The value for the amount of product is unbelievable this same bottle would cost me almost $40 dollars more at department store.</li>
    <li> I dont know which is better this or Marc Jacibs Dot...they are both so yummy. Love love love this perfume.</li>
    <li> Smells eau so fresh!!!!  I detect no difference in the fragrance versus the department store toilettes....and, in original packaging!!!</li>
    <li> Exactly what you would find in store for a lot more money. Worth it!</li>
    <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE this product it is a clean sweet smell. I work in a medical office my patients love this it is not to strong for those that may be irritated by a strong smell.  Get compliments all the time!!!</li>
    <li> I just received my perfume in the mail today! Couldn&#x27;t wait to try it on, I must say I definitely wasn&#x27;t disappointed! I am so happy with my purchase.... Thank you Amazon for delivering so prompt and careful!  I am a big fan of Amazon...</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been searching for a new perfume since my old favorite was discontinued. I&#x27;ll admit to being influenced by cute bottles, and this perfume definitely has that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the scent of this, it&#x27;s very fresh and clean right out of the bottle. It&#x27;s floral without being musky. However, the scent changes a bit once it&#x27;s applied to my skin. I realize different people&#x27;s body chemistries can be different, so this may not happen for everyone. And the changed scent on my skin is still good, just altered a little. So if you are considering this perfume, you may want to try to get ahold of a sample or use a tester bottle at a store first.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I find that this lasts for a few hours. By the end of the day, it&#x27;s pretty faint unless I hold my wrist up to my nose!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, this does not impact my rating, but please check out the seller feedback carefully before purchasing. It seems as though some sellers may be offering counterfeit product, especially in the larger-sized bottles.</li>
    <li> Love, love, love this fragrance! I always get compliments on how good and fresh this fragrance is. Would definitely buy again!</li>
    <li> I was a bit sceptical about purchasing perfume online but I was not disappointed with this purchase. It was the correct product and it came long before it was expected. :-)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this for years. It&#x27;s strong enough to be noticed but not too intense. Very sweet and sexy :)</li>
    <li> I LOVE this perfume!!! Everyday I put it on I am refreshed by the delicious scent! Such a wonderful gift!</li>
    <li> its smell just as good as I seen in the store. I love the bottle</li>
    <li> Product as described and shipped as expected.  No problems with anything and everything was as expected.  Thanks again for the item.</li>
    <li> Got this Marc Jacobs perfume for my sis-in-law, she loves Marc Jacobs perfume. It smells great and at a good price. Great gift!</li>
    <li> Got it for my fiancé and it smells good not to strong and the  smell of the fragrance last all day like if she was in a flower shop all day. I was satisfied with the shipping and item came nice and secure in a big box item was a lot bigger then expected</li>
    <li> I was trying to find a light beautiful scent.. I have a hard time with perfume, but this one is perfect.</li>
    <li> Brought the perfume for my girlfriend for mother&#x27;s day. The smell is just perfect for the spring/summer. She loved it and will definitely buy it from Amazon. A $30 savings from Macys.</li>
    <li> My granddaughter loved fit!</li>
    <li> Beautiful very clean smelling, nice</li>
    <li> Fails to match the perfume in either strength OR fragrance...</li>
    <li> Fast and as promised.</li>
    <li> dont hesitate to buy it.. I am enjoying it a lot. Much cheaper than the market price. I surely recommend it</li>
    <li> This is my favorite scent, it is not overpowering yet, it smell sensual.  The large bottle lasts a very long time.</li>
    <li> Gave her this for valentines day....in store it was about 95..screw that! If I can save some money and use the rest for something else she&#x27;d like, why not? Brand new</li>
    <li> Amazing price smells amazing. I was scared it was a knock off bc it was so cheap but it is the real thing came sealed and smells perfect</li>
    <li> It is great, my wife loves it and also do I, I mean every time she puts it on I just wanna Jump on her :-) . I reccomend this perfume to any female!!!</li>
    <li> I love this smell. It&#x27;s so fresh and airy yet floral. It&#x27;s not as deep as the regular daisy. It has pretty good staying power too. Would recommend over the delight spin off.</li>
    <li> Firstly, the packaging of this product is wonderful. If you&#x27;ve bought Marc Jacobs perfume before, then you&#x27;re probably used to his marvelous package designs. If not, you&#x27;re in for a treat. I bought this as a gift for my sister for Christmas, and she absolutely loved it. It is also a wonderfully refreshing fragrance with a hint of floral. This makes a great gift, and also a lovely perfect to own yourself.</li>
    <li> so sexy and so sensual.  I love it.  Just , send  me a new atomizer.  the one included with my purchase does&lt;br /&gt;not work unless one exerts lots of pressure in order to spray it.  I had worn the other Daisy scent and I am&lt;br /&gt;totally addicted to these scents.</li>
    <li> It smells amazing and i think this is so worth it because its a huge bottle that can last a while! plus its about $30 less than getting it at a store. Totally worth it! Smells pretty &#x3D;]</li>
    <li> Very impressed with the speed with which my order arrived and love it!  Would recommend to others looking for similar items.</li>
    <li> This fragrance is my go-to scent.  so fresh and refreshing.  It last long on my skin.  Amazing price, and Quick Shipping</li>
    <li> great price and everyone says how fresh i smell. i love this perfume.,</li>
    <li> I accidentally ordered my mother the DG Light Blue for men instead of women, fortunate because I realized after ordering it how many women I&#x27;ve enjoyed that scent on, and the turnaround time was phenomenal. My mother loves the scent too.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve gotten lots of compliments from people.  It doesn&#x27;t over power you but strong enough to last long time.</li>
    <li> Love this fragrance and the price</li>
    <li> The prefect on time gift for the wife</li>
    <li> When the product was delivered one of the bottles was leaking. It also does not spray. The other was fine</li>
    <li> My wife is up to her third bottle, and imust say i loc&#x3D;ve this perfume, it has such a fresh scent that you never get fed up of it!!</li>
    <li> It arrived quickly and smells great!</li>
    <li> I really feel satisfied with my purchase.  I really feel that I got more for my money.  Plus, delivery was fast and seamless.</li>
    <li> Always rapid delivery, great prices and quality.</li>
    <li> My wife loves this and says that it is the original (not a fake reproduction) at an affordable price</li>
    <li> I love the smell of this perfume, so fresh, co clean, and not overbearing at all. The scent lasts all day.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a new Spring/Summer perfume when I bought this at Ulta, however next time I will buy it online. My husband and I love this perfume. My only issue is that it is not very long lasting. But I suppose that just means I can spray more on without feeling guilty!</li>
    <li> Awesome shipping and fast</li>
    <li> A light refreshing spring/summer fragrance.  It does not last as long as the original Daisy so to prolong the scent you might need to layer the scents (that is use the lotion and body wash in addition to fragrance)</li>
    <li> I really love the smell of this perfume!  The price of this large bottle of perfume was even better and I received pretty fast as well!</li>
