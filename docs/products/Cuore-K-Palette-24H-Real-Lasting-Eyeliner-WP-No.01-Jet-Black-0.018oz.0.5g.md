      <li>I have hooded eyelids and have been trying to find a good eyeliner since forever.</li>
      <li>It goes on real easy.</li>
      <li>and I love it!</li>
      <li>Love it!  </li>
      <li>The tip on this eyeliner is amazing.</li>
      <li>I saw so many good reviews about this product.</li>
      <li>It does have a perfect precise tip for application and it went on smooth the first time.</li>
      <li>This is easily my favorite eyeliner of all time</li>
      <li>Ordered 2 more</li>
      <li>I love the color.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m glad I bought it</li>
      <li>It is much better than drug-store brands and does not smudge.</li>
      <li>You do not want to use this on your lower eyelids, like most liquid eyeliners.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Love this liner.</li>
      <li>I can sleep in it and still have perfect lines the next day.</li>
      <li>This one doesn&#x27;t \\&quot;cake\\&quot; up between the creases, no matter how many times you go over it.</li>
      <li>Longevity is pretty good for me, about 5-6 hours before needing touch-up.  </li>
      <li>It dries very quickly, within seconds unlike most liquid eyeliners.&lt;br /&gt;3)</li>
      <li>Yet I&#x27;m still able to remove it easily with makeup remover wipes at night.</li>
      <li>On the bright side, it has a really cool package, a nice brush, vibrant color pigments and no bothersome chemical reaction with the eyes.</li>
      <li>That is super impressive for liquid liner, especially since I wear this liner every day.</li>
      <li>This one product is easy to use and no smudge.</li>
      <li>It stays on all day and comes off easy.</li>
      <li>It comes off so easily that water on a tissue took it off, if that says anything about its staying power.  </li>
      <li>It stays on until I take it off and removes easily with my Crealine H20 makeup remover.</li>
      <li>It stays on all day and is extremely easy to apply and it does not run or fade even with sweat.</li>
      <li>Precise, dark and easy to control, this eyeliner is the best that I&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s foolproof in terms of control and allows you to draw anything from a fine line to spamming on for halloween.</li>
      <li>However, nothing&#x27;s perfect, and this one does smudge/run a little.</li>
      <li>and the point is extremely precise.</li>
      <li>What a bummer, i was excited about it too.</li>
      <li>Its great because you can style your eyeliner wings easily, and get a sharp point...</li>
      <li>I love this more than any other make up product I own.</li>
      <li>It creates better defined and crisper lines than a pencil, but dries faster and looks more natural than liquid.</li>
      <li>The only good thing about it is the pen tip is nice and flexible but so is many other liquid liner pens that work better.</li>
      <li>; and that tag line was good enough for me.</li>
      <li>One tube has lasted me about 6 months, which I think is quite good for such an inexpensive liner.    </li>
      <li>I would like a more intense color payout;  </li>
      <li>and I have definitely used my fair share of gels, liquids, kohl, and oil sticks.</li>
      <li>and it still looks great after an average 14-hr workday.  </li>
      <li>It does not stay on if water gets on it however it does have pretty good lasting abilities.</li>
      <li>It really isn&#x27;t worth the price.</li>
      <li>really can&#x27;t say enough good things about this liner.</li>
      <li>pricey but worth it.</li>
      <li>But out of the choices out there, this one is near the top.</li>
      <li>K palette makes great streak free, long lasting eyeliners!</li>
      <li>it is very easy to draw lines with this eyeliner, and it dries really fast and last all day.</li>
      <li>It did not withstand the hot weather or the humidity</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll start buying it from Amazon again since apparently the Asian market is realizing how awesome this product is and wants to constantly jack up the price.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Then, 6 months later when I went to buy more, the price had gone up to match Amazon&#x27;s price.</li>
      <li>This eyeliner seemed exactly like the type of thing I&#x27;d be looking for.  </li>
      <li>I first found this product while shopping in Japantown in San Francisco.</li>
      <li>-I only use this to line my top eyelid, it is not for use on your waterline.   </li>
      <li>didn&#x27;t last all day for sure</li>
      <li>this stuff isn&#x27;t absolutely waterproof!</li>
      <li>Benefit&#x27;s They&#x27;re Real!</li>
      <li>The packaging is very neat (I even got some free false eyelashes in mine!), pen works great -- and by that</li>
      <li>Easy to use, long lasting, way better and cheaper version of the dolly wink eyeliner.    </li>
      <li>These last all-day, are easily removed with makeup remover, and dry quicker than most eyeliners.</li>
      <li>I would definitely purchase it again just because of how easy it is to apply and it did not run or smear.</li>
      <li>I took some water and rubbed the eyeliner off quick and completely off.</li>
      <li>I love this eyeliner and will probably continue to use it until I get too old to wear excessive eyeliner :)</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s quite delicate and I&#x27;m sure could be damaged easily.   </li>
      <li>Besides, it&#x27;s really rather value for money.  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t have much of an oil eyelid,yet this one smudges.</li>
      <li>highly recommended for everyone!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried liquid eyeliners and eyeliner pens from Lancome, Givenchy, Urban Decay, Kat VonD, Tokidoki, Stila, and Sephora, but this brand and Dolly Wink eyeliner are by far my favorite.</li>
      <li>don&#x27;t know if its a quality control issue or what, but the eyeliner went on inconsistently (streaky, more gray than black).  </li>
      <li>Highly recommended, will buy it again.</li>
      <li>/&gt;However, my biggest reason for repurchasing this eyeliner is that the tip is very sharp/precise, and dries quickly without me having to shut my eyelids for 5 minutes to dry.</li>
      <li>On the downside, the color is just not as black as I would like it to be, though that&#x27;s not really a big problem; just go over it once more!</li>
      <li>(I&#x27;ve slept in it more than a few times), but it does eventually start to get flakey and spotty.   </li>
      <li>Color is pretty dark, and the formula dries quick, doesn&#x27;t bleed.</li>
      <li>I find this eyeliner is best for tight lining and for touch-ups after you use false lashes.</li>
      <li>I have oily skin and live in the tropics where it&#x27;s sun/rain</li>
      <li>rarely stays on my face for too long.</li>
      <li>Eyeliner pen and Bobbi Brown&#x27;s gel eyeliner have much darker pigmentation (as well as being super long lasting...</li>
      <li>Nice basic eyeliner with a super fine tip that works well for getting in between and along the base of the lashes.  </li>
      <li>and it certainly did not last like any type of tattoo.  </li>
      <li>This however only impacted the quality of the bristles got really messed up.</li>
      <li>Can even line the inner part if you want, you have that much control with this pen.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know who payed these people to state that this is like a real tattoo and last all day.</li>
      <li>Interestingly, when I found it at the Asian market it was a few dollars cheaper than it is here.</li>
      <li>I ordered my first bottle here and have since purchased it from my local Asian market.</li>
      <li>i have nothing to complain about this eyeliner except the price is high compared to the cheaper eyeliners that i had used which does the same job as this one.</li>
      <li>it stays on for so long and goes on really well</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s too bad because the pen offers great control and the liner itself doesn&#x27;t seem to bother the eyes.  </li>
      <li>I mean the liquid tip is extremely easy to use.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used this for only 2 days so far</li>
      <li>I have a tiny Asian eyelid fold and usually eyeliner smears easily.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s also easy to create a natural taper just by using the thin and thicker portions of the brush.</li>
      <li>Never before have I seen such a delicate and precise tip which makes it easy to keep the line thin and natural, or to layer up for thicker lines.</li>
      <li>Tip is very sharp, therefore makes precise lines, especially when I like to draw very thin lines on top of my upper eyelid.&lt;br /&gt;2</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> it is very easy to draw lines with this eyeliner, and it dries really fast and last all day. i have nothing to complain about this eyeliner except the price is high compared to the cheaper eyeliners that i had used which does the same job as this one. btw, this eyeliner is better than the ultra thin one (micro .05mm in BLUE) that is carried by the same company.</li>
    <li> The packaging is very neat (I even got some free false eyelashes in mine!), pen works great -- and by that I mean the liquid tip is extremely easy to use. It gives off very thin, medium, or thick lines with just a swipe and appropriate pressure. The tip is quite sharp and never really wears off. Color is pretty dark, and the formula dries quick, doesn&#x27;t bleed. I haven&#x27;t tested it on my eyes yet (what a dummy), but I have on my hand. The eyeliner doesn&#x27;t seem to wear with rubbing AT ALL. The problem is... this stuff isn&#x27;t absolutely waterproof! I took some water and rubbed the eyeliner off quick and completely off. What&#x27;s up with that? I guess it could be a pro because some liquid eyeliners take a millennium to get off. Otherwise, I love the fact it doesn&#x27;t smudge (I hate panda eyes), and it won&#x27;t take me long to apply.</li>
    <li> It goes on real easy. It stays on all day and comes off easy. What else can I ask for in a liner? A must have!</li>
    <li> This eyeliner seemed exactly like the type of thing I&#x27;d be looking for.  I have a hard time keeping any eyeliner on and I&#x27;m always trying to find a brand that promises the staying power I need.  However, this is not the liner to buy.  It doesn&#x27;t necessarily run or smear, but within a few hours of application, it had vanished.  It&#x27;s too bad because the pen offers great control and the liner itself doesn&#x27;t seem to bother the eyes.  It did not withstand the hot weather or the humidity and it certainly did not last like any type of tattoo.  I would not purchase this liner again and would definitely look for an alternative.  It comes off so easily that water on a tissue took it off, if that says anything about its staying power.  Although this can&#x27;t compare to those liners you buy that rub off and leave you with two black eyes, I was dissapointed.  On the bright side, it has a really cool package, a nice brush, vibrant color pigments and no bothersome chemical reaction with the eyes.</li>
    <li> This stuff is just like a tattoo.....I will be ordering another one soon....lasted all day and into the night...easy to work with...smooth thin line. Can even line the inner part if you want, you have that much control with this pen.</li>
    <li> I bought this based on the 4 stars received and the reviews of others posted. I don&#x27;t know who payed these people to state that this is like a real tattoo and last all day. BS I say. If it lasts two hours that&#x27;s a big deal. It flakes off, or bleeds into the crease of the eyelid. I can&#x27;t believe that I spent 18.95 on this. I have used longer lasting eyeliner that I bought in the dollar store. Total waste of money. The only good thing about it is the pen tip is nice and flexible but so is many other liquid liner pens that work better. RIP OFF. Save your money.</li>
    <li> I bought this eyeliner based on a recommendation from a friend.  She got it from an asian market, not from amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know if its a quality control issue or what, but the eyeliner went on inconsistently (streaky, more gray than black).  After a few layers of application to get an even, dark coat, the liner flaked off in an odd pattern throughout the day.  That being said, it didn&#x27;t give me raccoon eyes or anything - it just looked terrible on.  What a bummer, i was excited about it too.</li>
    <li> This is the best eyeliner I have ever used (and trust me there have been many). It stays on all day and is extremely easy to apply and it does not run or fade even with sweat. I am not sure if it is really waterproof though; I have never tested that.</li>
    <li> I like this products and shipping on time. This one product is easy to use and no smudge. Good to wear during summer &#x3D;}</li>
    <li> I have hooded eyelids and have been trying to find a good eyeliner since forever. This has been a godsend. It&#x27;s foolproof in terms of control and allows you to draw anything from a fine line to spamming on for halloween. The trouble I have with other quick-dry/non-smudge eyeliners is that it rubs off, leaving me with blank patches on my eyelids where the hood folds in. This one doesn&#x27;t \\&quot;cake\\&quot; up between the creases, no matter how many times you go over it. Removal isn&#x27;t half bad either. You might get a faint mark leftover if you don&#x27;t use a primer but one should always use a primer before applying any type of eye-makeup. Staying power is terrific! I have oily skin and live in the tropics where it&#x27;s sun/rain/high humidity and it still looks great after an average 14-hr workday.  On the downside, the color is just not as black as I would like it to be, though that&#x27;s not really a big problem; just go over it once more! Besides, it&#x27;s really rather value for money.  Have re-bought this for the past 4 years and will continue to do so.</li>
    <li> I bought this because of the terrific reviews others had given it.  I was very disappointed when I tried it.  It doesn&#x27;t stay all day, and it flakes off.  Within at hour, it looks terrible.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my sister since she&#x27;s been looking for an eyeliner and she threw water on her face after applying to test it out and the eyeliner faded. Although I know this isn&#x27;t what usually happens when wearing eyeliner, I did expect it to stay on since it claimed to be a &#x27;tattoo&#x27; eyeliner.</li>
    <li> It does not stay on if water gets on it however it does have pretty good lasting abilities. Not sure if I will be repurchasing. I love the color. The pigmentation is not to die for. It is much better than drug-store brands and does not smudge.</li>
    <li> Out of all the liquid eyeliners, this one is the easiest to apply and smudges the least. However, nothing&#x27;s perfect, and this one does smudge/run a little. But out of the choices out there, this one is near the top. I&#x27;ve used it for years. Now, when are they gonna have colors??</li>
    <li> Love this liner. Second time purchasing it. Only complaint is, no matter how careful recapping it, some of the bristles still got messed up. This however only impacted the quality of the bristles got really messed up.</li>
    <li> I saw so many good reviews about this product. I&#x27;m glad I bought it but this eyeliner takes a bit to dry. If you&#x27;re mono-lidded like me, this means it can smear on upper lash line. Also, I found it was not an all day wear for me unless you touch up or do multiple coats. Great precision and pigmentation.</li>
    <li> Thin lines. Great control. Long staying power. I&#x27;ve bought myself and my mother these eyeliners multiple times- highly recommended for everyone!</li>
    <li> pricey but worth it. The liner stay on all day and it doesn&#x27;t smear.  Highly recommended, will buy it again.</li>
    <li> Nice basic eyeliner with a super fine tip that works well for getting in between and along the base of the lashes.  Longevity is pretty good for me, about 5-6 hours before needing touch-up.  I would like a more intense color payout;  Benefit&#x27;s They&#x27;re Real! Eyeliner pen and Bobbi Brown&#x27;s gel eyeliner have much darker pigmentation (as well as being super long lasting... like 14 hours durable!).  I find this eyeliner is best for tight lining and for touch-ups after you use false lashes.</li>
    <li> I love this more than any other make up product I own. I use pressed powder on my eyelid before application. It doesn&#x27;t run, streak, or flake off. Lasts all day for me.</li>
    <li> This eyeliner does NOT last 24 hours. I wore it out and pulled an all nighter, this wore off before morning. It just sort of fades and flakes off after a while. However, that may depend on your skin type. I tend to have somewhat oily eyelids and makeup rarely stays on my face for too long. It does have a perfect precise tip for application and it went on smooth the first time. I had no issues appyling it. I would definitely purchase it again just because of how easy it is to apply and it did not run or smear.</li>
    <li> This is easily my favorite eyeliner of all time and I have definitely used my fair share of gels, liquids, kohl, and oil sticks. It doesn&#x27;t smudge or smear at all and the point is extremely precise. One tube has lasted me about 6 months, which I think is quite good for such an inexpensive liner.    Some things to keep in mind:  -You must be very careful not to bend or damage the tip when putting the cap back on. It&#x27;s quite delicate and I&#x27;m sure could be damaged easily.   -I only use this to line my top eyelid, it is not for use on your waterline.   -You will know when to replace it when the liquid become slightly less opaque.  -This eyeliner is the type to flake off, not smear off. It DOES last about 24 hours (I&#x27;ve slept in it more than a few times), but it does eventually start to get flakey and spotty.   -I don&#x27;t advise using this over excessive creams or powders as it might dirty and clog the brush tip.    I love this eyeliner and will probably continue to use it until I get too old to wear excessive eyeliner :)</li>
    <li> This eyeliner does not last very long at all.&lt;br /&gt;I expected it to last at least a few hours but it does not.</li>
    <li> I have a tiny Asian eyelid fold and usually eyeliner smears easily. These last all-day, are easily removed with makeup remover, and dry quicker than most eyeliners. I&#x27;ve tried liquid eyeliners and eyeliner pens from Lancome, Givenchy, Urban Decay, Kat VonD, Tokidoki, Stila, and Sephora, but this brand and Dolly Wink eyeliner are by far my favorite. It creates better defined and crisper lines than a pencil, but dries faster and looks more natural than liquid.</li>
    <li> I tried this based on a friend&#x27;s recommendation.  It did stay on longer than usual but since it&#x27;s a pen with dispensing liquid, the tip is uneven when I apply and getting worse as time goes by.  In the summer this is smearing in about 1 hour even when I use an eye lid prep and pre-make up foundation.  It really isn&#x27;t worth the price. Try Revlon ColorStay liquid liner.  It works just as well for half the price.</li>
    <li> Easy to use, long lasting, way better and cheaper version of the dolly wink eyeliner.    There are articles about the comparison about how identical this is to dolly wink but the cost of dolly wink has sky rocketed: [...]</li>
    <li> I had a K-Palette 1 Day Tatoo eyeliner before and I remembered it was great. But this one, it smudges so much that I don&#x27;t even know if it is fake or not. It said it is sweat proof and water proof too but this one literally wears off when I put cold water on it (no scrubbing). I don&#x27;t have much of an oil eyelid,yet this one smudges. I might give it a third try since I still have faith in the previous one, but after that, no more. i don&#x27;t write on comments at all, but this time that I was so shocked and disappointed at a product that had prompted me to write so much.</li>
    <li> I am a liquid eyeliner junkie. I can&#x27;t handle eyeliner pencils and my skin is oily so eyeliner pencils hate me too. I&#x27;ve tried so many different kinds of liquid liners and when I randomly heard about this one on a beauty blog, I decided to give it a try. I ordered my first bottle here and have since purchased it from my local Asian market. Interestingly, when I found it at the Asian market it was a few dollars cheaper than it is here. Then, 6 months later when I went to buy more, the price had gone up to match Amazon&#x27;s price. Six months after that and now the price is up another three dollars, making it more expensive than from Amazon. I&#x27;ll start buying it from Amazon again since apparently the Asian market is realizing how awesome this product is and wants to constantly jack up the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ANYWAY, as I mentioned up there, about every six months (maybe longer) I need to replace my bottle. That is super impressive for liquid liner, especially since I wear this liner every day. Like, EVERY DAY. I vary my look from a thick winged look to thinner lines just around the lashline, but it&#x27;s usually winged liner for my daily look. As I also mentioned up there, I have oily skin and in the past my wings would smudge or rub off by the end of the day. Not with this liner. I can sleep in it and still have perfect lines the next day. Yet I&#x27;m still able to remove it easily with makeup remover wipes at night. The tip on this eyeliner is amazing. Never before have I seen such a delicate and precise tip which makes it easy to keep the line thin and natural, or to layer up for thicker lines. And because of the shape of the brush it&#x27;s also easy to create a natural taper just by using the thin and thicker portions of the brush. Also, the thin tip makes it easy to line the inner eye.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really can&#x27;t say enough good things about this liner. I don&#x27;t stray from this eyeliner and I never will. This is my eyeliner FOR LIFE.</li>
    <li> Here are my opinions on this liner:&lt;br /&gt;1) Tip is very sharp, therefore makes precise lines, especially when I like to draw very thin lines on top of my upper eyelid.&lt;br /&gt;2) It dries very quickly, within seconds unlike most liquid eyeliners.&lt;br /&gt;3) This eyeliner material feathers off, instead of smudging.&lt;br /&gt;4) You do not want to use this on your lower eyelids, like most liquid eyeliners.&lt;br /&gt;5) I use this eyeliner only about ~3-4 times a week, and it usually lasts for 2 months for me, which is a bit tough on the wallet.&lt;br /&gt;6) You may want to consider using eyelid primer before using this eyeliner (but the same goes for all other eyeliners).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, my biggest reason for repurchasing this eyeliner is that the tip is very sharp/precise, and dries quickly without me having to shut my eyelids for 5 minutes to dry. Just wish it was a bit cheaper for the quantity.</li>
    <li> I first found this product while shopping in Japantown in San Francisco. I did not understand anything on the packaging other than &amp;#34;1 day eyeliner tattoo&amp;#34; and that tag line was good enough for me. This liquid liner pen wears all day, is richly pigmented and really allows me to create dramatic graphic eye looks. It stays on until I take it off and removes easily with my Crealine H20 makeup remover. 100 thumbs up!! Seriously.</li>
    <li> K palette makes great streak free, long lasting eyeliners! You can&#x27;t go wrong with this!</li>
    <li> Sorry, I really wanted this to work. Unlike its name, this eyeliner wore off by the end of the work day. Eyes were smudgy @ 4 hours and no liner 8+ hours later. Averaging it out to 6+ hours is 1/4 day. I&#x27;ll stick to the other liquid eyeliner I use which stays put.</li>
    <li> I bought this product because I heard a review about it on youtube. Its great because you can style your eyeliner wings easily, and get a sharp point... not so great because well it whines off very easily! What I use it for now is to just get the shape then I go over it with eye shadow or another eyeliner. Defiantly not &amp;#34;24 Hours&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t last long and dried out quickly.</li>
    <li> Useless.... product for the claims they are making.  dont waste you money on it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this for only 2 days so far and I love it! it stays on for so long and goes on really well doesn&#x27;t smudge that I&#x27;ve noticed, I&#x27;ll never use another eyeliner again it&#x27;s awesome.</li>
    <li> didn&#x27;t last all day for sure</li>
    <li> Definitely lasts all day, even on oily skin</li>
    <li> Precise, dark and easy to control, this eyeliner is the best that I&#x27;ve ever used.  Love it!  Ordered 2 more so I have a couple of back ups.</li>
