    <li> Excellent price given the combs were included - performs as well as I was hoping it would.  Very glad I made this purchase!</li>
    <li> It cuts perfectly,no defects at all.</li>
    <li> My husband is active duty military so I needed something that would hold up against a weekly haircut. I have tried several others and spent more money than I&#x27;d like to say on clippers that last 6 months then crap out. These have held up to the task. They cut great, not leaving all those little stragglers sticking up that I have to go back over and over to get. The only downfall is that they have a fan in them cooling the clippers so the handle can tend to get hot if you hold to close to the top. But no real complaints otherwise. Great buy!!</li>
    <li> I am a hairstylist and I got my Oster clippers a few weeks ago- so far I love them. They cut very nice and I dont have to keep going over and over the hair, like I did with my old ones that were a different brand. I havent noticed them getting too hot at all. I am quite happy with these clippers!</li>
    <li> Hands down the best clippers I have ever owned.  The attachments are strong and will last a long time.  Thanks!</li>
    <li> There are many, many reviews for this clipper that influenced my purchase, all of which were redundant!  Plain and simple...these clippers are everything I was looking for and more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very pleased with them and how fast I received them!</li>
    <li> Ok, this thing is definitely built like a tank compared to the toys that you find at Target and such. I have been cutting my hair for years and I have had osters handed down from my dad. It finally started acting up so I bought others as Wahl and Conair. The only lasted a quarter of what the Osters did so given the history, I decided that Osters were well worth the money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have thick hair that the Wahl and Conair would need multiple passes to cut. When I used the Oster 76 Classic LE, it was clean from one pass. I guess force of habit made me go over a couple more times but I don&#x27;t think it really needed it. I did have to get used to it since it felt different than the others but it was a quick learning curve. The on/off is a toggle on the bottom of the clipper and the wire is relatively thick compared to the cheap ones. The comb set does come with a drawstring pouch for them though. It also comes with clipper grease and blade oil. I do have to say that the comb set is a good quality and it does fit the 76 well compared to the other universal crap combs. It has metal spring loaded clasps that sercure it to the clipper. Overall, so far, I am happy with my investment. I plan to have this for quite some years!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only minor negatives are:&lt;br /&gt;It is louder compared to the cheaper ones, but you&#x27;ll know why when it spools up. It doesn&#x27;t tug hairs if you go at a decent speed or leave a stray strand so that&#x27;s good. It is also heavier than the cheapos...I&#x27;d say about 2 or 3 times heavier but it you have any decent strength, you&#x27;ll be fine. That&#x27;s the trade off for heavy duty quality! It also does warm up a bit more...I avg about 30 min give or take all around but I have a straight up army flat top style (not total buzz, almost more like crew cut). How I cut: The sides and back are relatively quick, the time goes into blending the sides and finer details. It is not hot enough to burn but warm enough that leaving it in one spot of bare skin would get uncomfy after a few seconds. No biggie though...I use the comb set so it stays off the skin 90% of the time. It does not come with a storage case (asides from the factory foam and box).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope this helps answers more than the basic questions. If you cut hair regularly (not pro but can use it for pro)then invest in something other than the cheap ones. It will pay for itself within 6 mos of regular cuts&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: 10/1/2013 still a buzz cut every other week at least and the thing is still a beast. I think it may have gotten slightly louder but I just clean it out more often and make the blade oiling more frequently as it does. Otherwise, it already paid for itself by far. The clipper attachments also in good shape. I am happy I did not waste my money with this...awesome&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;update: 7/30/15 still purring!! Just keeping up with the regular cleaning and oiling of the blades and still trims down everything in it&#x27;s path.

    <li> I am very happy with my purchase it is a deal that you cant pass up!!!! the guards are good the clippers are beautiful and of course its quality, its Oster.</li>
    <li> This Is the first time in 32 years I have not used Wahl clippers. I read the reviews and decided to try these. For a woman I have large hands but the clippers are so large and bulky I cannot get a good grip on them. Also fine hairs are just passed over. I am very disappointed. Also paying $18. for shipping was outrageous. I should return them but it is too much trouble.</li>
    <li> These clippers are very durable, precise and very sharp. They cut all different types of hair with ease. The comb sets are very easy to swap. Packs a lot of power, stays cool after multiple use. The cutting blade is treated with antimicrobial coating which reduces growth of bacteria, mold and mildew. Awesome product.</li>
    <li> I won major brownie points purchasing this for my husband&#x27;s birthday. He says nothing compares to these clippers. I purchased the trimmer, fast feed and 76. The trimmer lines perfectly, the fast feed gives a great five o&#x27;clock shadow, and the 76 classic gives him a professional cut. Spending more know will save us the money we spend at a barber shop every other week.</li>
    <li> They run kind of hot but they&#x27;ll do for the type of work I do.</li>
    <li> Perfect and flawless function.</li>
    <li> I just purchased these to keep my own hair in-check. I don&#x27;t like purchasing things twice - so, I made my purchase decision based on apparent quality and other reviews - and after receiving the Oster Classic 76, I&#x27;d say they are built to last. This set is nice because it comes with a really wide range of comb/guards.</li>
    <li> great set of clippers!</li>
    <li> I bought this to start cutting my own hair. After looking over several different sets I decided to buy the Oster 76 since I have a Oster brand shear I use to groom my dog with and they are bulletproof even after years of heavy use. The 76 has the same quality I was accustomed to and they cut great without any issues. The clip on combs fit securely and make cutting your hair a breeze. 10 for the top and the 8 for the sides. A little tricky around the ears to get it right but after a few tries it all turned out great. Throw in a Wahl mustache trimmer for touch-up and you will never pay a barber again. A tripple fold out mirror will be a great help too.</li>
    <li> This product was expensive, but it is a good value for the quality. It is a professional  model. It is heavy at first, but the feeling goes away as you use the clippers. The size plastic heads are very easy to mount and dismount. The quality hair cut is great. If you can deal with the price, this product is worth that price. I would buy another clipper as a present.</li>
    <li> My hands are small and it is a little large and heavy.  With that being said, the clipper cuts amazing.</li>
    <li> HUGE! It&#x27;s like a hedge trimmer. Almost like holding a beverage can. Can be cumbersome but will get the job done. Seems to be top quality. Had I known the actual size I may have opted for a smaller version but I think I will get use to the size and it should last longer than my hair!</li>
    <li> These are great clippers, everyone already knows that! I love the way the motor sounds although some people think they&#x27;re loud I like it. feels very solid and quality, the guards that came with it are very high quality as well and range from #0 all the way up to lengths way too long for clippers anyways. I have been using these clippers at work for a few months now and everything is so far so good!</li>
    <li> Exactly what I wanted and works great! Can&#x27;t be happier. 😀</li>
    <li> Wow this is a great tool. Very we&#x27;ll made, not too loud ! Glad to have it!!!! Love it !&lt;br /&gt;Old school look, rugged !!!</li>
    <li> I have been using the Oster Classic 76 hair clipper for about a year now. One of the best things that I have done.&lt;br /&gt;48 year old male. Hair looks great. ( not that i have a full set of hair ) Easy to cut hair myself. No going out to spending money and time when I can to it better ,cheaper and faster. Saving $150 a year doing it myself.</li>
    <li> I love these clippers, they are top of the line.  I love the color and they are powerful yet relatively quiet for a clipper.  I would definitely recommend them to others.</li>
    <li> This is a llimited edition purchase at a reasonable price. I&#x27;m happy with this purchase and it arrived within a couple of days using the standard shipping.</li>
    <li> Absolutely the best clippers that you can buy! This is not cheaply built! It&#x27;s high quality. Just make sure that you oil them well, and DO NOT let water sit on the metal parts. It will rust!. I have saved a TON of $$ on haircuts at the barber by buying these. WELL worth the money!</li>
    <li> Annoying cord aside this tool is truly excellent.  It is industrial and you would see it in use in salons.  Deals with every imaginable hair issue. Better than all the others.</li>
    <li> Great Deal!!  So glad I made this purchase.</li>
    <li> Very strong clippers good 4 a life time, solid build quality!! A good buy 4 some one looking 4 clippers to last a long time!!</li>
    <li> I had purchased an inexpensive set of Oster Clippers in 1985 as a soldier in the military and have been cutting my own hair since. Not being happy with the inventory available at the local big retail stores I bought this most expensive set of professional Oster clippers. Wow...not all clippers are equal. This is a great set and I will have them for the rest of my life...then someone will enjoy them after that....should have bought these years ago.</li>
    <li> best clippers you can buy</li>
    <li> Fast delivery and the product arrived just as described!  It works great! I needed them for my new job. They are amazing!The limited edition silver casing makes them look really nice and unique. Thanks for the quick delivery and honesty with the product listing!</li>
    <li> me and my son been cutting our hair for over 2 years now we already got what we paid for it and still going strong</li>
    <li> My husband has really thick, curly hair, and we have been buy cheap buzzers for a long time. They have all been miserable to work with. We finally decided to bite the bullet and get a good pair. I am so glad we did. They cut through his hair so easily without getting stuck or clogged. Best hair investment ever.</li>
    <li> I had my hair cut with it many time and never let me down.&lt;br /&gt;This model rocks.&lt;br /&gt;And the color is awesome.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve burned through close to 10 clippers over the years. This is by far the best clipper I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
    <li> I purchased these clippers for home use on myself and two boys.  These clippers work great!  They cut consistently and don&#x27;t reach an uncomfortable tempurature even with the three cuttings in a row,  the only downside is that the is not a bag for the clippers.  The bag that comes with the kit is clearly made to hold the attachments, not the clippers.</li>
    <li> I like to trim up more with this great clipper.  Before this I hated trimming my hair.&lt;br /&gt;I use this as an electric razor and hair trimmer.  Any other clippers pull hairs and leave&lt;br /&gt;sores that take weeks to heal.  How smooth. This is the best.</li>
    <li> Very good well made product.  I cut my own hair and this gives me a perfect cut.</li>
    <li> My previous clipper was a Remmington which did its job well enough, even if it pulled my hair a lot if I let it get too thick or long.  This isn&#x27;t an issue with the Oster.  It has a much more powerful motor and what appears to be much better quality blades.  I am happy with the ease and quickness of my self haircuts now.  I notice a lot less need to go back over areas to get stray hairs.</li>
    <li> Same as the old one, don&#x27;t see a difference in the limited. Also no bag like the picture shows. O well. Expected in today&#x27;s world. Cuts ok. Almost the the old one better</li>
    <li> I used to have an Andis one which worked so much better.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s amazing, love it, makes men&#x27;s cuts so much cleaner and faster. It&#x27;s also much quieter than my last clippers.</li>
    <li> Never came back to the barber shop!</li>
    <li> The clipper is heavy, but in a good way.  Doesn&#x27;t get overly hot near the motor vent or blades like some other models do.  Some people say it&#x27;s loud, but I don&#x27;t find it any louder than the last few clippers I&#x27;ve owned.  The construction is solid, cuts hair very easily and smooth without catching like cheaper models do.  I&#x27;ve used it every other week for the last six months and haven&#x27;t noticed any degradation of performance.  All in all, this is by far the best hair clipper I&#x27;ve ever used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Additionally, purchasing this set with the 10 piece universal comb set was a great deal.  The combs are spring loaded to form a tight fit over the blades.  Not like other sets that just slide on by two tracks on the sides of the combs.  FYI, there is not enough room in the small bag to house the combs and the clipper.</li>
    <li> Awesome tool! Finally I got a clippers that takes just one try to get a clean cut! I absolutely love it!</li>
    <li> I do not know why everyone give such a high rating for this ,I do not like it, if you use it more than few mins ,it gets hot from the bottom of the machine, first few month it cut hair very good ,but after a while,the blade get duller just like all the other cheap brand, for the money you spend on this product, it is not worth it!</li>
    <li> This is a very robust, heavy (good thing) professional tool.  It is made in the USA and I can already tell it is going to last me for life unless I run over it with the car or something.</li>
    <li> This is the real deal. If you are looking for professional quality this is it.</li>
