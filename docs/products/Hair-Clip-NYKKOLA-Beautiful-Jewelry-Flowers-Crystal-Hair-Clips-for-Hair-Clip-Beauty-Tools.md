      <li>This clip is beyond cheap and chintzy looking.</li>
      <li>I find that a lot of items made in China are cheaply made.</li>
      <li>so I&#x27;m just going to copy the same review for all of them because they are all great.</li>
      <li>More colorful than pictured.</li>
      <li>all the time its really fancy!!!</li>
      <li>Shipping is free so if you need this right away I do not recommend.</li>
      <li>Very pretty and made well.</li>
      <li>This was a very pretty hair clip.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very pretty and sparkly.</li>
      <li>This clip is very pretty and arrived with all its jewels in tact.</li>
      <li>However, the flowers were very pretty.</li>
      <li>Well worth the price paid.</li>
      <li>But it was totally worth the wait.</li>
      <li>but it was well worth it if needed for an occasion order  </li>
      <li>Beautiful but very heavy....</li>
      <li>Love this one, although a little heavy, but awesome.</li>
      <li>I like how the comb curves and arches to fit securely and flat.</li>
      <li>It is really pretty, however, the metal flower piece fell away from the clip as soon as I opened the package.</li>
      <li>First off, this product comes from China, so it will take a while to ship.</li>
      <li>However the comb teeth bent and one broke off the first time I used it.</li>
      <li>so I&#x27;m trying to figure out if I can hot glue it.</li>
      <li>It is very beautiful and will do the job for holding long or heavy hair while being prettier than the photo.</li>
      <li>it would definitely increase the chances for a more peaceful atmosphere.</li>
      <li>very sparkly and fun to ware.</li>
      <li>It is lovely and will add glamour to a simple hair bun or ponytail!</li>
      <li>I ended up hot gluing it, but just be aware it will need to be reinforced.</li>
      <li>Love the clips, when I ordered I thought I was only getting one, but I got two.</li>
      <li>Never expected something so pretty for so cheap.</li>
      <li>its came on a different color, not as strong as i</li>
      <li>it took a little longer than I would have liked for it to be shipped</li>
      <li>I honestly have not yet gone out anywhere while wearing this just because the weight is just a little intimidating.</li>
      <li>I really like this hair</li>
      <li>What a shame because the whole item is built very well</li>
      <li>kids women for once a reasonably priced item doesnt disappoint</li>
      <li>it also looks fabulous from the back.  </li>
      <li>It shipped straight from China.  </li>
      <li>It really adds glamour to your hairstyle.</li>
      <li>Very.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t look much like the picture.</li>
      <li>It can be wear in even in short hair if it is light in weight</li>
      <li>Perfect for an updo style or simply to spice up a casual do.  </li>
      <li>Very pretty but only for decorative use.</li>
      <li>didn&#x27;t fit on my hair very loose</li>
      <li>Has a little weight to it but not too heavy and looks great when you wear it.</li>
      <li>But I live in Wisconsin and it was broke when I got it so don&#x27;t get it during winter</li>

    <li> Worked great for my bridesmaid and maid of honor in a pretty side bun for my summer wedding YAY :D</li>
    <li> I really like this hair Barrett I get compliments all the time its really fancy!!!</li>
    <li> Very beautiful and classy.</li>
    <li> I have very thin hair and I use this when I put it into a bun to hold it in place. It is well made and I will be buying from this seller again</li>
    <li> Very heavy but it&#x27;s beautiful. Bigger than I expected</li>
    <li> Nice from a far..you got what you payed for</li>
    <li> This was a beautiful comb and looks gorgeous in my daughters hair.  This was a great Christmas gift for a young lady.</li>
    <li> It is not beautiful in real. It does not look like the picture and looks very cheap as if it was in the sun for ages. I will never buy anything made in China anymore. I just waste my money. I order things and ship them all the way into the trash. How sad</li>
    <li> Got this for a requested gift.  It is pretty but being made in China don&#x27;t know how long it will hold up.  I find that a lot of items made in China are cheaply made.</li>
    <li> This was a very pretty hair clip. I only gave it 4 stars because the comb part was a little thicker than I wanted. However, the flowers were very pretty.</li>
    <li> More colorful than pictured. It looks white in the picture, but actually has quite a bit of color in it. Light weight and well made.</li>
    <li> A beautiful hair pin, looks truly amazing in hair up do ... Yes, definitely recommend for evening hair style ...</li>
    <li> I try to send it back but my husband through away the package so I have not way but keep and item the I can not even used, to sad</li>
    <li> Very pretty but only for decorative use. Will not keep your hair up. Mine broke after two weeks so I&#x27;m trying to figure out if I can hot glue it.</li>
    <li> Very Nice! Looks just like the picture! I like how the comb curves and arches to fit securely and flat. Well worth the price paid.</li>
    <li> Product arrived broken, Looks well made and fashionable.  Arrived in a paper envelope and given the shoe print was stepped on.  A little super glue and it was usable.  It was a gift and didn’t realize until it was given. I would have given it a 5</li>
    <li> This comb would NOT work for someone with thin hair.  The comb part is thick and big.  It&#x27;s very pretty and works very well for my daughter who has thick, thick long hair.  But there is no way this would work for my other daughter&#x27;s thinner hair.</li>
    <li> Very pretty large and heavy comb with long prongs.  It is very beautiful and will do the job for holding long or heavy hair while being prettier than the photo.</li>
    <li> We&#x27;re very happy with the hair clip! It&#x27;s really beautiful and have an amazing quality.... It looks stunning in hair buns!</li>
    <li> It is not as shown on the picture that the comb like sticks are not showig that I made a mistake of buying this. You have to have hair up as the picture to hold this pin which is not good for my short hair.</li>
    <li> This clip is beyond cheap and chintzy looking. It&#x27;s so ugly my 6 year old niece turned her nose up at it! The comb piece itself is far too long and will stab you in the head, and the &amp;#34;crystals&amp;#34; aren&#x27;t even decent glass. I&#x27;m annoyed that I wasted the $1.80 on it that I did and would request a refund, except it would cost more to ship it back. Gross.</li>
    <li> I was really pleased by this item the price  it took a little longer than I would have liked for it to be shipped but it was well worth it if needed for an occasion order  at lest a month in  advance to make sure you get it in time.</li>
    <li> It is beautiful but quite heavy for small hair  and can no be used with any style. It can be wear in even in short hair if it is light in weight</li>
    <li> Very. Cute but it looks like it&#x27;s only valued for the few dollars I spent on it. But super cute</li>
    <li> Lovely color and beautiful. However the comb teeth bent and one broke off the first time I used it.</li>
    <li> IT doesn&#x27;t hold any hair, heavy for its size, doesn&#x27;t support any hair or hold. I am not using it. I can&#x27;t even use it as just &amp;#34;decoration&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> This clip is very pretty and arrived with all its jewels in tact. Has a little weight to it but not too heavy and looks great when you wear it. Simply gorgeous.</li>
    <li> Great product for the price.</li>
    <li> Beautiful makes my hair look so classy</li>
    <li> Perfect for an updo style or simply to spice up a casual do.  The price was so appealing as well--loved it!</li>
    <li> Beautiful but very heavy....</li>
    <li> beautiful.  stays in granddaughters hair well.  I have got to stop buying things I need 3 of !!!!!!!  it would definitely increase the chances for a more peaceful atmosphere.</li>
    <li> didn&#x27;t fit on my hair very loose</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s very pretty and sparkly. It looks just like the picture. However, it is a Chinese hairpin, not a clip. Also, the tongs on it are very long, and might go straight through a bun.</li>
    <li> Total difference with pic post on website</li>
    <li> Love this one, although a little heavy, but awesome.</li>
    <li> I I Ordered the hair clip to wear for upcoming wedding I was attending but i received the hair clip broken.</li>
    <li> Was broken when opened the package</li>
    <li> this was for a wedding and they are so darn cute everyone wanted to wear them. even the bride to be.</li>
    <li> It will take up few weeks to arrive but the price is worth it. Added this to my collection. Looks okay not great.</li>
    <li> This hair clip isn&#x27;t good quality is very cheap looking and it&#x27;s not like the photo.&lt;br /&gt;I am disappointed in this hair pin because it falls off  my hair and it&#x27;s not cute like&lt;br /&gt;On the photo.</li>
    <li> A beautiful hair accessory that goes with everything.  When I wear my hair up, I tease the top for addition height.  It looks great from the front and with this hair accessory it also looks fabulous from the back.  A great compliment getter.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t look much like the picture. Mine has some gold paint between some of the flowers. And it&#x27;s very cheap. The comb part is bulky and heavy.</li>
    <li> This is a comb, not a clip. It is beautiful and i love it.</li>
    <li> Incredible price and the photos don&#x27;t show how pretty the clip is. It is lovely and will add glamour to a simple hair bun or ponytail!</li>
    <li> not right for my hair</li>
    <li> awful color--I like the clip though</li>
    <li> I have to admit that this was a disappointment.  It hurts when i put it in my hair and it is very cheap looking.  It looks better in the picture than in reality. Skip this one.</li>
    <li> its came on a different color, not as strong as i though, it cant hold all my hair because its not strong</li>
    <li> Love it, I like that it is metal and not plastic. But I live in Wisconsin and it was broke when I got it so don&#x27;t get it during winter I think that played a roll in it.</li>
    <li> fun and pretty great for gifts and self--recommend buying two for bun or pulling hair from face--great for holidays kids women for once a reasonably priced item doesnt disappoint</li>
    <li> I honestly have not yet gone out anywhere while wearing this just because the weight is just a little intimidating. I feel like if it does fall out, the impact it will make with the floor will just be too embarrassing. Those of you who like weight though in your hair, this product is so beautiful. Very reflexive of the light, and the colors are beautiful.</li>
    <li> cheap, looks great.&lt;br /&gt;didn&#x27;t use myself but give as gift to people who helps me on vacation.</li>
    <li> Read my later review. I change my mind after using this product, and have edited this to give it five stars.</li>
    <li> The soldering that connects the decoration to the hair piece broke after 1 use. What a shame because the whole item is built very well but the connection between the comb and the decoration was ineffective. Will have my husband solder it, hope that works.</li>
    <li> Love it! no to mention the price. I bought a few items together with this one so I&#x27;m just going to copy the same review for all of them because they are all great. The only thing is that the items come from China so it took a while to get here. But it was totally worth the wait. Great quality too.</li>
    <li> Never expected something so pretty for so cheap. Nice add on for a pony tail or bun. Very heavy and sturdy. Shipping is free so if you need this right away I do not recommend. Took me like 3 weeks to receive.</li>
    <li> First off, this product comes from China, so it will take a while to ship. It is really pretty, however, the metal flower piece fell away from the clip as soon as I opened the package. I ended up hot gluing it, but just be aware it will need to be reinforced.</li>
    <li> This piece is so pretty and delicate. It looks lovely with an up-do and stays in place.  Glad I purchased it.</li>
    <li> This is such a pretty little piece for your hair. I&#x27;m wearing it for a wedding, and I think it will look fabulous!</li>
    <li> bought this and did not get it. dam shame. I should have gotten it last month. not good for business.</li>
    <li> this is an awesome hair piece and you can&#x27;t beat the price. i was shocked when they sent me 3. i thought i was only getting one. now i have great gifts for friends.</li>
    <li> Lovely comb. The rhinestones are just enough sparkle to show off the comb but also show off whatever style you are wearing. More colors please!</li>
    <li> LOVED THIS HAIR PEICE.</li>
    <li> Not anything like I had expected. The packaging was poorly done, the comb is very poorly made and flimsy, the colors aren&#x27;t what I expected. It shipped straight from China.  I purchased several hair things from this dealer at the same time, and I have been equally disappointed with all of them. I would not recommend purchasing from this dealer.</li>
    <li> If I could give a 0 I would. Please do not order it is a waste if money.</li>
    <li> I knew it was probably cheap - ah duh! But it took an entire month to arrive and then it was broken and unwearable. I would NOT recommend ordering from this company even when the price looks inviting. Color was also not as portrayed, it looks much more lavender and purple that the picture.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this clip. I have worn it many times. It is so beautiful. It really adds glamour to your hairstyle. I rate this clip a solid 10 hands down.</li>
    <li> Very pretty and made well.Took a long time to get it about a month.So if not in a hurry I would buy again....</li>
    <li> very sparkly and fun to ware.</li>
    <li> Love the clips, when I ordered I thought I was only getting one, but I got two. Pleasantly surprised. I have worn a couple times and gotten compliments.</li>
