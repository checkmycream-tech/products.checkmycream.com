      <li>Not too happy with the service.</li>
      <li>This item would also make a great gift.</li>
      <li>over all it was a great product.</li>

      <li>The lace is beautiful and adds a touch of class to a caboodle without looking cheap.</li>
      <li>I love it!</li>
      <li>I love this case!</li>
      <li>I received my makeup case, although it is a nice case it is not the one i ordered.</li>
      <li>now I have to attach it with some kind of glue...</li>
      <li>Also this one had the best price by far.</li>
      <li>This is the best way to store make up as it is easy to organize, easy to maintain everything, and easy to clean.</li>
      <li>So I got this as a gift about 2 years ago, when I first received it i was so happy and excited!</li>
      <li>would give it 5 stars if the mirror would be okay and if this would have Lace like it say&#x27;s...</li>
      <li>Also as some of the others have said, mine arrived with the mirror not attached to the inside of the top compartment.   </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m thinking of getting another one, to organize my jewelry. :)</li>
      <li>the lace makes it look stylish and it comes with keys</li>
      <li>I would say that is more of an error on Target&#x27;s warehouse/shipping people, and I would complain on them, not on this product.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve had it for a while and love it.</li>
      <li>It holds so much more.</li>
      <li>I love opening up the box and seeing my eye shadows, organized by color groups, my lip color by type and everything else in the bottom.</li>
      <li>You may be better off buying it in person.</li>
      <li>It is just as cute as it looks in the picture.</li>
      <li>i have gotten many compliments and people ask me all the time where i got it.</li>
      <li>and I really love how the compartments pull out.</li>
      <li>Then for the top section it has lip gloss, two lip sticks, and miscellaneous disposable eye applicators.</li>
      <li>I orderes this with my own allowance, and was quite excited when it arrived two weeks aafter I ordered it.</li>
      <li>I am very glad that I ordered this case it was definitely worth the money.</li>
      <li>I will say that it is large and kind of cute</li>
      <li>I also have professional make up brushes that are in their own leather container which fits quite nicely into the lower section.</li>
      <li>This is truly a beautiful way to store all of your extra not-daily-wear makeup.</li>
      <li>and this box is only good for just a bit of makeup.</li>
      <li>But overall it&#x27;s a good product.</li>
      <li>It is really cute and very functional.</li>
      <li>If I was 12 I would love it just as much as I do now at 21.</li>
      <li>It has a mirror inside, fold out 3-leveled compartments on both sides, and it absolutely makes me want to go out and buy more makeup to fill it with.</li>
      <li>Now that i&#x27;m starting to get more and more makeup</li>
      <li>There are six smaller compartments that telescope out 3 on either side and they are perfect to sort all my smaller make-up.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very light-weight and easy to move around.</li>
      <li>But overall it still is a nice product.</li>
      <li>But worth having still;  </li>
      <li>It is NOT black lace and it does not have nearly as many compartments as advertised.  </li>
      <li>I just received my case, it came pretty quickly...</li>
      <li>It holds a good amount of makeup and three little</li>
      <li>I needed something feminine and pretty, to match my decor.</li>
      <li>And the lace is really pretty.</li>
      <li>It is a peice that will last awhile and it will be able to grow with you.</li>
      <li>This box is exactly what I needed.  </li>
      <li>This is the first time I have ever owned a Caboodle</li>
      <li>I loved the lace and the little compartments!</li>
      <li>I have an extensive nail polish collection and filled them up.</li>
      <li>I wondered whether I would like it as much as I did in the picture.</li>
      <li>I really dislike the silver cases so this one really stood out to me.</li>
      <li>it doesnt take up too much room.</li>
      <li>I love the black lace design.</li>
      <li>I love my Black Lace Case.</li>
      <li>DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!!</li>
      <li>I love all the little seperated compartments, I can organize everything just how I like.</li>
      <li>Buy it, its worth it especially if you are going to use it for nail polish.</li>
      <li>I actually bought this item in Target&#x27;s store because I wanted to look at it first.</li>
      <li>So I&#x27;m going to get a hot glue gun and attach it back, but if you dont want to go through all of that, by all means dont buy this.     </li>
      <li>It is exactly the same.</li>
      <li>This is the 3rd case I have in this exact style.</li>
      <li>There is a larger compartment in the bottom that fits bottles and lotion tubes really well.  </li>
      <li>The black lace is very pretty</li>
      <li>But i noticed that the pull out compartments were a little flimsy, and i noticed that the bottom really didn&#x27;t have so much room.</li>
      <li>Needless to say the top compartment broke!</li>
      <li>First off, it seems as if I am not even close to the only one who has ordered this product only to receive something completely different.  </li>
      <li>I read some reviews on here about people receiving a completely DIFFERENT makeup case after ordering this one, and I am sooo sorry, because this one is truly adorable and just ROCKS!</li>
      <li>Big enough to fit all my make-up but small enough to travel with and no be clunky.  </li>

<li> Big enough to fit all my make-up but small enough to travel with and no be clunky.  </li>
<li> It&#x27;s a cheap, ugly-looking, fake crocodile-skin monstrosity and NOT black lace.  </li>
<li> I wondered whether it would be too small or too large.</li>
<li> In the middle section, I have a mixture of single eye shadows and my mascara.</li>
<li> It looks really nice in the picture not sure why I got the wrong item.</li>
<li> I received my case today and it&#x27;s a totally different item than the Caboodles Black Lace Case.</li>
<li> It is a solid black case, not the lace that i wanted.</li>
<li> only waited a few days.</li>
<li> I used to have all my make-up just thrown in a big, black, velvet box and had a hard time actually finding anything I was looking for.</li>
<li> The other 2 I have had for over a year</li>
<li> Some of the other reviews said it had a mirror which it doesn&#x27;t.</li>
<li> I had got the other 2 from Sallys Beauty Supply</li>
<li> However,  as some of the other posters have mentioned it is not lace embroidery.</li>
<li> I don&#x27;t think you can be very rough with it because if the inside compartments are damaged, it&#x27;s all over.  </li>
<li> It comes with a key so that you can lock it as well, which I like because I have a little baby who will soon be a little toddler getting into everything!</li>
<li> And beyond all that, this thing is so rattly and cheap that it makes me sick to my stomach to know that I paid any money for it.  </li>
<li> it&#x27;s black tho.&lt;br</li>
<li> It&#x27;s black faux crocodile print.</li>
<li> I wanted the black lace case and what I have now is just like crocodile print &#x3D;S</li>
<li> What a mess.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I used to have all my make-up just thrown in a big, black, velvet box and had a hard time actually finding anything I was looking for. I bought this and immediately organized my make-up and brushes. I love opening up the box and seeing my eye shadows, organized by color groups, my lip color by type and everything else in the bottom. And, it is so beautiful. I love the black lace design. I needed something feminine and pretty, to match my decor. This is perfect.    I&#x27;m thinking of getting another one, to organize my jewelry. :)</li>
    <li> I orderes this with my own allowance, and was quite excited when it arrived two weeks aafter I ordered it. I opened it up and inside was something that was completely different and BROKEN. I purposely ordered this one because i love the print, well the one i recieved was a horrible faux black leather. I also ordered it because it had no mirror, well the on I recieved had a mirror in it that had FALLEN OUT. I was very unhappy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> I received this item and the mirror was broken off from the inside.  Also when I went back to my order it was not the same product that I ordered.    It looks really nice in the picture not sure why I got the wrong item.</li>
    <li> This makeup case is very nice. It holds a good amount of makeup and three little \\&quot;shelves\\&quot; expand outward on each side when the case is opened. I&#x27;m happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> I received my case today and it&#x27;s a totally different item than the Caboodles Black Lace Case. Not even close to what I ordered. I hate it and will be sending it back. I ordered another one and AGAIN they sent the wrong case.  Returning this case also and now must wait 4 weeks for refunds for both orders...which hopefully includes credits for all the shipping I paid. I will NOT order another case from Target.</li>
    <li> I received a wrong case! I wanted the black lace case and what I have now is just like crocodile print &#x3D;S and the mirror isnt in its place !!! now I have to attach it with some kind of glue... DO NOT BUY IT !!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Do not buy from here it is overpriced! Shop around you&#x27;ll see. Great bag tho. I&#x27;ve had it for a while and love it.</li>
    <li> I just received my case, it came pretty quickly...only waited a few days. However,  as some of the other posters have mentioned it is not lace embroidery. It&#x27;s black faux crocodile print. Also as some of the others have said, mine arrived with the mirror not attached to the inside of the top compartment.   So I&#x27;m going to get a hot glue gun and attach it back, but if you dont want to go through all of that, by all means dont buy this.     I will say that it is large and kind of cute (the only plus). But I decided to use it as a jewelry case instead of a make-up case. I&#x27;ll be looking for another case.</li>
    <li> It was a great price and great quality. All my makeup fits it brings a key to lock it which it helps me alot! I love it!</li>
    <li> I love this case! It is really cute and very functional. I spent a lot of time researching different cases and this one was by far one of the cutest. Also this one had the best price by far. It keeps all of my make up in place and it ads to my decor. I really dislike the silver cases so this one really stood out to me. It is just as cute as it looks in the picture. And another point any girl any age would like it. If I was 12 I would love it just as much as I do now at 21. It is a peice that will last awhile and it will be able to grow with you. It is a great gift!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t see lace .. it&#x27;s black tho.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The mirror is broke &amp; You can only send it back and get a refund or&lt;br /&gt;contact Target to see if they have the same in the store.&lt;br /&gt;I would give it 5 stars if the mirror would be okay and if this would have Lace like it say&#x27;s...</li>
    <li> I received my makeup case, although it is a nice case it is not the one i ordered. It is a solid black case, not the lace that i wanted. Not too happy with the service. But overall it still is a nice product.</li>
    <li> First off, it seems as if I am not even close to the only one who has ordered this product only to receive something completely different.  It&#x27;s a cheap, ugly-looking, fake crocodile-skin monstrosity and NOT black lace.  Mine also had a broken mirror.  And beyond all that, this thing is so rattly and cheap that it makes me sick to my stomach to know that I paid any money for it.  I tried gluing the mirror back in, but that didn&#x27;t even work, so now I probably can&#x27;t even try to return it.  What a mess.  I&#x27;m on the lookout for another makeup organizer AGAIN and this time, I&#x27;ll pay close attention to the reviews.  Don&#x27;t waste your money on this piece of crap!</li>
    <li> This is the first time I have ever owned a Caboodle and I am very happy with this purchase. The deepest section fits a mineral blush, two mineral foundation containers, and a concealer container. I also have professional make up brushes that are in their own leather container which fits quite nicely into the lower section. In the middle section, I have a mixture of single eye shadows and my mascara. Then for the top section it has lip gloss, two lip sticks, and miscellaneous disposable eye applicators. This is the best way to store make up as it is easy to organize, easy to maintain everything, and easy to clean. I am very happy that I made the purchase.</li>
    <li> I was a little nervous upon ordering my Caboodles Black Lace Case. I wondered whether it would be too small or too large. I wondered whether I would like it as much as I did in the picture. Well, It arrived three days after I placed my order. I love my Black Lace Case. It&#x27;s the perfect size, all my make-up fits in it nicely. I love all the little seperated compartments, I can organize everything just how I like. It&#x27;s very light-weight and easy to move around. I can definitely take this case with if I travel. The black lace is very pretty and I really love how the compartments pull out. I am very glad that I ordered this case it was definitely worth the money. If I had a second chance, I would buy it again in a heartbeat.   This item would also make a great gift.</li>
    <li> I like this case but it&#x27;s just a little bit flimsy.  I don&#x27;t think you can be very rough with it because if the inside compartments are damaged, it&#x27;s all over.  But worth having still;  I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;d buy it for a child.</li>
    <li> This box is exactly what I needed.  There are six smaller compartments that telescope out 3 on either side and they are perfect to sort all my smaller make-up.  There is a larger compartment in the bottom that fits bottles and lotion tubes really well.  Big enough to fit all my make-up but small enough to travel with and no be clunky.  And the lace is really pretty.</li>
    <li> I read some reviews on here about people receiving a completely DIFFERENT makeup case after ordering this one, and I am sooo sorry, because this one is truly adorable and just ROCKS! I would say that is more of an error on Target&#x27;s warehouse/shipping people, and I would complain on them, not on this product. It is durable enough that if you took this separate at an airport, it could be one of your bags itself. It comes with a key so that you can lock it as well, which I like because I have a little baby who will soon be a little toddler getting into everything! I actually bought this item in Target&#x27;s store because I wanted to look at it first. It has a mirror inside, fold out 3-leveled compartments on both sides, and it absolutely makes me want to go out and buy more makeup to fill it with. This is truly a beautiful way to store all of your extra not-daily-wear makeup. They sell a smaller one too for $19.99, but I say go all the way and just get this one. It holds so much more.</li>
    <li> Do NOT make the same mistake I made, read the bad reviews, if I had, I would NOT have wasted my money. They will NOT send you the case that is displayed in the picture. Mine also arrived with the mirror missing from its correct position.  It is NOT black lace and it does not have nearly as many compartments as advertised.  Then amazon.com gives you the run around in getting the product that you actually ordered. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!! You may be better off buying it in person.</li>
    <li> i have gotten many compliments and people ask me all the time where i got it. perfect for me cuz i dont have tons of makeup nd it doesnt take up too much room.</li>
    <li> I bought this caboodle for dance competitions it has great amount of space. the lace makes it look stylish and it comes with keys so you can lock it if you don&#x27;t want a sibling steeling your makeup. over all it was a great product.</li>
    <li> This is the 3rd case I have in this exact style. I have an extensive nail polish collection and filled them up. I had got the other 2 from Sallys Beauty Supply but they no longer have them so I ordered this one. It is exactly the same. The other 2 I have had for over a year and they are holding up well with no problems. Some of the other reviews said it had a mirror which it doesn&#x27;t. The lace is beautiful and adds a touch of class to a caboodle without looking cheap. Buy it, its worth it especially if you are going to use it for nail polish.</li>
    <li> So I got this as a gift about 2 years ago, when I first received it i was so happy and excited! I loved the lace and the little compartments! But i noticed that the pull out compartments were a little flimsy, and i noticed that the bottom really didn&#x27;t have so much room. It was great to have, but after about a year, it started to come apart. The paper inside was starting to come off, and you could start to see the cardboard from pull out compartments. Needless to say the top compartment broke! Now that i&#x27;m starting to get more and more makeup and this box is only good for just a bit of makeup. But overall it&#x27;s a good product.</li>
