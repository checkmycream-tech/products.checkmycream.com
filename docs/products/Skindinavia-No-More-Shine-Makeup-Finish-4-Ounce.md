      <li>Great face spray!</li>
      <li>I love it!!!</li>
      <li>Great, great, great product!  </li>
      <li>lol.</li>
      <li>This is good stuff.</li>
      <li>Love it!</li>
      <li>I love this product!</li>
      <li>I absolutely love it!</li>
      <li>It creates a nice canvas for the rest of your makeup (bronzer, blush, etc).</li>
      <li>It really helps the makeup set in &amp; stay beautiful all day!  </li>
      <li>It feels nice</li>
      <li>You definitely have to use it before and after applying your make-up to have best results if you have oily skin.  </li>
      <li>and I love the matte look when I apply make-up.</li>
      <li>This product is about as effective as a spray bottle filled with water.  </li>
      <li>I found that this product will work best with proper skincare.</li>
      <li>This setting spray is awesome and I will definitely purchase again.</li>
      <li>Not any more because of this</li>
      <li>okay</li>
      <li>I love this product.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m in love with it</li>
      <li>I was expecting a bit more help with my shine.</li>
      <li>drying time is slightly more than most, but totally worth it!  </li>
      <li>I tried this product for a first time, and I am in love!  </li>
      <li>I had no bad things happen while using it it was light and refreshing and not sticky or anything.  </li>
      <li>This super product was recommended to me by a makeup guru that I watch on YouTube and this stuff is the bomb!</li>
      <li>I have tried spraying lightly</li>
      <li>Still, oil will break through so plan to use it more than once a day if you have pretty oily skin like myself.</li>
      <li>I love that it lasts throughout the whole day!</li>
      <li>Definitely worth the investment!</li>
      <li>I originally got this because my makeup tends to get oily throughout the day even after setting it with powder.</li>
      <li>As much as makeup costs and the time it takes me to put it on, I&#x27;m so glad this product has been invented.</li>
      <li>Full disclosure:  </li>
      <li>I bought this because I heard and read good reviews that it would make your makeup last all day and look like you just put it on.  </li>
      <li>I recommend it, it&#x27;s higher quality than a lot of other finishing sprays, but hear that the one used more for bridal makeup works even more effectively for oil control.</li>
      <li>Its so easy and helps so much I use it every day!</li>
      <li>Probably after 6 hours, I started to get super oily again.</li>
      <li>I have super oily skin</li>
      <li>The setting spray is what professional makeup artist use for bridals and other celeb people to set their makeup and make them flawless all day.</li>
      <li>I. Honestly didn&#x27;t notice a big difference.</li>
      <li>My make-up stays put and looks fresh after a nine hour workday, even with this Florida heat and humidity.  </li>
      <li>It is useful as it described.</li>
      <li>and this does not help very much because of the sweating on the face.</li>
      <li>I ABSOLUTELY recommend this product!</li>
      <li>This was my first finishing spray</li>
      <li>In other words, do NOT go to sleep with your makeup on because your pores will be clogged and your makeup will just sit on your skin rather than blending in nicely.</li>
      <li>I use this product everyday, and I agree with other reviews that it works best when used under AND over your makeup.  </li>
      <li>It works great for a few hours, but definitely didn&#x27;t last for 16 hours or more.</li>
      <li>Certainly, I enjoy the sensation of the fine mist landing on my skin as gently as a light summer rain, but I do not enjoy the sight of of my make-up still sliding off my face just 30 minutes later as if I used nothing at all.  </li>
      <li>It really helps minimize touch-ups throughout the day.</li>
      <li>I have VERY oily skin.</li>
      <li>I use it primarily as a primer and then finish with the Urban Decay product.</li>
      <li>Didn&#x27;t really do much of anything.</li>
      <li>and I think it works really well.  </li>
      <li>this product really help keep my foundation from getting on clothing or making me feel like I need to wash my face after just a couple of hours.</li>
      <li>This spray puts in work because I have VERY oily skin</li>
      <li>And the spray was very fine and doesn&#x27;t mess up your make up.  </li>
      <li>I have very oily skin that produces far worse than the comparatively cute sheen many supposedly \\&quot;oily-skinned\\&quot; women</li>
      <li>It might be more expensive, but it works a whole lot better and longer.</li>
      <li>On particularly hot/humid days, I spritz this and my BB cream lasts alot longer.</li>
      <li>My makeup would look patchy and my fountain would melt off, even my high end brands.  </li>
      <li>Highly recommend.</li>
      <li>Those of us with oily skin are always looking for something that might work a little better.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m so glad I got the bigger bottle because I will be using this product for a long time.</li>
      <li>Keeps makeup in place and looking like new for hours.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried multiple setting sprays, most recently the one from Urban Decay and this one beats them all for a fraction of the price.</li>
      <li>The only thing I suggest is to use a little more than what is called for on the  bottle.</li>
      <li>The combination of a primer, matte foundation, and this setting spray, locks in my make up completely.</li>
      <li>Gave to my 15 yr old daughter with poreless skin</li>
      <li>It does keep my makeup &amp;#34;in place&amp;#34; longer, but as far as combating shine, I am not sold.</li>
      <li>and I will definitely purchase it again and hope to get the right bottle next time</li>
      <li>Granted I still have a little, but like I said I have super oily skin.</li>
      <li>for some odd reason this hasnt run out yet its a bit pricey but its worth majority of the time</li>
      <li>I used it with bare minerals</li>
      <li>Sometimes it dries with a short of &amp;#34;filmy&amp;#34; finish on the skin, but it&#x27;s barely noticeable.</li>
      <li>This does not really do anything for me other than make my face feel initially fresh after the application.</li>
      <li>I find that it gives my makeup such longevity, and makes it last like no other.</li>
      <li>I have very oily skin and am very please what this product has done with keeping my make-up put and my less less oily as the day goes on.  </li>
      <li>, it dries quickly and it does not have any negative smell</li>

<li> I recommend this to anyone with oily skin or if you want your makeup to be long lasting.</li>
<li> Normally I would have to reapply powder after a few hours but with this product, I don&#x27;t have to anymore.</li>
<li> and it keeps everything in place all day long.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve tried other brands like the Urban Decay and Model in a Bottle setting spray, but they don&#x27;t give me the effect like Skindinavia does.</li>

<li> READ MY OTHER REVIEW ON THIS SIMILAR PRODUCT.</li>
<li> My face was dry and not oily to the touch, but the shine was almost a glow.</li>
<li> This covers the pores but within 2 hrs, it fades and I can see the pores again and have to touch it up with the loose powder.  </li>
<li> I purchased this product a few months ago, and I use it on myself &amp; my clients when I do a makeup application that I want to stay on as long as possible.  </li>
<li> and I suspect those for whom it works do not really have OILY skin.</li>
<li> and I have minimal shine.</li>
<li> A 4 ounce bottle has lasted me several months, but I don&#x27;t wear makeup everyday.</li>
<li> and I have tried spraying liberally until my face was nearly wet.  </li>
<li> No More Shine Makeup Finish Spray gives me the longest lasting result.</li>
<li> I am an extremely oily person with horribly cystic acne and scarring, so I use a fair bit of foundation and concealer to cover my skin problems.</li>
<li> I was skeptical to spend this much on a product, but my daughter just had to have it.</li>
<li> Not worth the money paid.  </li>
</ol>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I love this product. Just spritz it on your face after you&#x27;re done applying all your makeup and it keeps everything in place all day long. A 4 ounce bottle has lasted me several months, but I don&#x27;t wear makeup everyday. I will definitely keep this in my makeup bag. As much as makeup costs and the time it takes me to put it on, I&#x27;m so glad this product has been invented.</li>
    <li> I ordered the no shine spray but I received the bridal finish spray.  That one seems to work okay but it was not what I ordered and did not have time to make an exchange.</li>
    <li> This is my second bottle. I can truly see the difference in the longevity of my make up when I spray this and when I don&#x27;t! It keeps my make up lasting longer. I have oily/combination skin so mattifying primers and setting sprays are a must for me. The combination of a primer, matte foundation, and this setting spray, locks in my make up completely. I actually do not have to touch up or blot throughout the day with this combo. If I do not finish everything off with a setting spray, I DO notice a difference in my make up. Nothing drastic but enough to convince me that this product works, at least for me! Love it!</li>
    <li> It is useful as it described.</li>
    <li> I have oily skin and my makeup tends to wear off towards the end of the day but once I started using this product I definitely noticed a difference in how long my makeup lasted. I no longer needed to apply touch ups to my entire face! I recommend this to anyone with oily skin or if you want your makeup to be long lasting.</li>
    <li> I have oily skin and I love the matte look when I apply make-up. This setting spray is awesome and I will definitely purchase again.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product a few months ago, and I use it on myself &amp; my clients when I do a makeup application that I want to stay on as long as possible.  It really helps the makeup set in &amp; stay beautiful all day!  I would recommend it!!</li>
    <li> This product is a must have, especially if you have combination/oily skin. When I use it, my makeup lasts all day and I don&#x27;t get oily AT ALL. Normally I would have to reapply powder after a few hours but with this product, I don&#x27;t have to anymore. It&#x27;s lightweight and has never irritated or caused my skin to breakout. I love it!!!</li>
    <li> I tried this product for a first time, and I am in love!  The makeup stays put even with my combination/oily skin. I haven&#x27;t tried to keep it on for 16 hours, but I can vouch for 11 hours I wore it.</li>
    <li> READ MY OTHER REVIEW ON THIS SIMILAR PRODUCT. I FEEL THE SAME ABOUT THIS ONE. I ACTUALLY COULD NOT SEE IN DIFFERENCE IN THE 2.</li>
    <li> I will purchase this item again.  It holds my make up in place all day and isn&#x27;t harsh or drying</li>
    <li> This was my first finishing spray and I think it works really well.  I used it with bare minerals make up which is awesome BTW.  I have VERY oily skin. Like I put on my make up and have to blot before I leave the house!  Like I&#x27;ve never come home to see any remnants of blush left on my face until I tried this! Yes some oil did come through but far far less!  I had no bad things happen while using it it was light and refreshing and not sticky or anything.  And the spray was very fine and doesn&#x27;t mess up your make up.  Definitely not going without this stuff ever!  Its so easy and helps so much I use it every day!</li>
    <li> It does keep my makeup &amp;#34;in place&amp;#34; longer, but as far as combating shine, I am not sold. I think Zero Oil by Origins is still the best product for me when it comes to taming an oily face!</li>
    <li> I bought this because I heard and read good reviews that it would make your makeup last all day and look like you just put it on.  I have pores on my nose and around my nose that I cover with foundation and powder.  This covers the pores but within 2 hrs, it fades and I can see the pores again and have to touch it up with the loose powder.  I followed the instructions and shook up the product and sprayed it over my face.  It feels nice, it dries quickly and it does not have any negative smell but IT JUST Does NOT Work.  2 hrs later the pores are back.  Will not buy again.</li>
    <li> It does help, but only for a couple of hours.  I was expecting a bit more help with my shine.</li>
    <li> Definitely did not work for me. My face was dry and not oily to the touch, but the shine was almost a glow. Lots of powder still needed</li>
    <li> Not good, I received different product!!!</li>
    <li> Keeps makeup on all day but it still makes may &amp;#34;T zone&amp;#34; on my face oily.</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t quite set my makeup like the setting spray from Urban Decay (which is also made in collaboration with Skindinavia.)  I use it primarily as a primer and then finish with the Urban Decay product.</li>
    <li> I am an extremely oily person with horribly cystic acne and scarring, so I use a fair bit of foundation and concealer to cover my skin problems. On particularly hot/humid days, I spritz this and my BB cream lasts alot longer. Definitely worth the investment! Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried multiple setting sprays, most recently the one from Urban Decay and this one beats them all for a fraction of the price. My make-up stays put and looks fresh after a nine hour workday, even with this Florida heat and humidity.  I love this product!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used the Mary Kay mattifying product for several years, but saw the rave reviews for this product and had to try it.  Those of us with oily skin are always looking for something that might work a little better.  Well, this wasn&#x27;t it for me.  Even following the directions to the letter, by early afternoon at work my face was a greasy, shiny mess. This just didn&#x27;t work for me.  I can&#x27;t recommend it and I&#x27;ll NEVER buy it again.  Going back to Mary Kay.  It might be more expensive, but it works a whole lot better and longer.</li>
    <li> It works great for a few hours, but definitely didn&#x27;t last for 16 hours or more. Probably after 6 hours, I started to get super oily again.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work for my oily skin.  Gave to my 15 yr old daughter with poreless skin and she said it did very little.  Very disappointed to say the least.</li>
    <li> I use this product everyday, and I agree with other reviews that it works best when used under AND over your makeup.  I find it&#x27;s not really effective unless you do it this way.  My skin is acne-prone, and it doesn&#x27;t cause breakouts unless I sleep in my makeup (which I shouldn&#x27;t do anyway, I know!).</li>
    <li> for some odd reason this hasnt run out yet its a bit pricey but its worth majority of the time then again i dont always use it use this for a matte finish</li>
    <li> Full disclosure:  I have very oily skin that produces far worse than the comparatively cute sheen many supposedly \\&quot;oily-skinned\\&quot; women have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For women with skin like mine, this spray is laughable.  I have tried spraying both before and after I put on make-up.  I have tried spraying lightly and I have tried spraying liberally until my face was nearly wet.  However I use it, it does not work.  This product is about as effective as a spray bottle filled with water.  Certainly, I enjoy the sensation of the fine mist landing on my skin as gently as a light summer rain, but I do not enjoy the sight of of my make-up still sliding off my face just 30 minutes later as if I used nothing at all.  I cannot recommend this spray and I suspect those for whom it works do not really have OILY skin.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical to spend this much on a product, but my daughter just had to have it.This item lives up to its name. I have super oily skin so I applied before I put on my make-up and afterwards. My make-up stays on all day and I have minimal shine. Granted I still have a little, but like I said I have super oily skin. The only thing I suggest is to use a little more than what is called for on the  bottle.</li>
    <li> Honestly, not worth the money (at least for me). I have oily skin and I have been looking for that holy grail product that will help make my makeup L-A-S-T throughout the day. I am a person constantly on the go and I am tired of buying oil-blotting sheets, so I thought... Why not give this a shot after reading all of the review. Welp, gotta say... This does not really do anything for me other than make my face feel initially fresh after the application. Other than that, my makeup is not lasting any longer than it did before. I will not be repurchasing again.</li>
    <li> Great face spray! Same makers than Urban Decay.</li>
    <li> This super product was recommended to me by a makeup guru that I watch on YouTube and this stuff is the bomb! I absolutely love it! The setting spray is what professional makeup artist use for bridals and other celeb people to set their makeup and make them flawless all day. If you ever used Urban Decay or Tarte setting spray. They actually partnered up with Skindinavia to help them create a setting spray for their line.</li>
    <li> Great, great, great product!  I will keep buying this!  I have such severe oily skin.  My makeup would look patchy and my fountain would melt off, even my high end brands.  Mine would collect in my pores and look so terrible.  I have tried a lot of face setting sprays.  This one keeps me matte for at least 14 hours and keeps my makeup on my face!  My eye makeup make up would crease and spread, even with eye primer, and I would find myself reapplying it in the day.  Not any more because of this product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The drying time is slightly more than most, but totally worth it!  I just fan my face with what ever I have laying around.</li>
    <li> Keeps makeup in place and looking like new for hours.</li>
    <li> this product really help keep my foundation from getting on clothing or making me feel like I need to wash my face after just a couple of hours.</li>
    <li> I. Honestly didn&#x27;t notice a big difference. I was hoping my makeup would last longer, but it didn&#x27;t . It&#x27;s just such an expensive product for such minimal improvement. I won&#x27;t purchase again.</li>
    <li> I have very oily skin and am very please what this product has done with keeping my make-up put and my less less oily as the day goes on.  You definitely have to use it before and after applying your make-up to have best results if you have oily skin.  I tried it just after the application and it did not work the same.  I&#x27;m so glad I got the bigger bottle because I will be using this product for a long time.</li>
    <li> This is good stuff. It does help control shine, but maybe not as well as it could. Sometimes it dries with a short of &amp;#34;filmy&amp;#34; finish on the skin, but it&#x27;s barely noticeable. Still, oil will break through so plan to use it more than once a day if you have pretty oily skin like myself. I recommend it, it&#x27;s higher quality than a lot of other finishing sprays, but hear that the one used more for bridal makeup works even more effectively for oil control.</li>
    <li> - I rated this item 4 stars because I was sent the wrong one although it still does the trick for me as to setting my makeup. I&#x27;m in love with it and I will definitely purchase it again and hope to get the right bottle next time lol. This spray puts in work because I have VERY oily skin and once I apply it to my face, the oiliness is gone! I love that it lasts throughout the whole day! I ABSOLUTELY recommend this product!</li>
    <li> I originally got this because my makeup tends to get oily throughout the day even after setting it with powder. I don&#x27;t have oily skin, but my foundation made my skin appear shiny. I use this spray before I apply my foundation and after I apply both my foundation and concealer. It creates a nice canvas for the rest of your makeup (bronzer, blush, etc). I found that this product will work best with proper skincare. In other words, do NOT go to sleep with your makeup on because your pores will be clogged and your makeup will just sit on your skin rather than blending in nicely. Sometimes this product can also leave a bit of a shine after it dries. I use a small bit of powder wherever appears to be shiny and that does the trick for me. Do I find this product necessary? Probably not... I find that it&#x27;s extra work to use this and still have to set it with a powder to reduce the look of shine.</li>
    <li> I cannot go a day without spritzing it over my makeup! I find that it gives my makeup such longevity, and makes it last like no other. It really helps minimize touch-ups throughout the day. I&#x27;ve tried other brands like the Urban Decay and Model in a Bottle setting spray, but they don&#x27;t give me the effect like Skindinavia does. I know Skindinavia partnered with Urban Decay with their All-Nighter Spray but for some reason, the Skindinavia No More Shine Makeup Finish Spray gives me the longest lasting result.</li>
    <li> Disappointed! It did not control the oil on my face. Didn&#x27;t really do much of anything.</li>
    <li> I have oily skin and I perspire a lot and this does not help very much because of the sweating on the face.</li>
    <li> Not worth the money paid.  Doesn&#x27;t prevent shine well at all.</li>
