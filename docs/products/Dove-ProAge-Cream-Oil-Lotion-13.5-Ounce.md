      <li>I would apply it and found I would have too apply another lotion on top of it.  </li>
      <li>I WAS STILL ABLE TO GET IT, EVEN THOUGH THEY NOLONGER SELL IT IN THE STORE.</li>
      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>My favorite lotion ever.</li>
      <li>I LOVE THIS PRODUCT AND WAS GLAD</li>
      <li>so...2 for me :)</li>
      <li>My favorite was one that I bought out of the country.</li>
      <li>Love it.</li>
      <li>So glad to have found it on Amazon.</li>
      <li>i love the way it moisturizes my skin, and the way it shines my skin as well.</li>
      <li>I have used this lotion and I love how it works on my skin.  </li>
      <li>I was glad to get a 3pack.</li>
      <li>I have offered it to male friends of mine and they were equally impressed with the feel and smell of this lotion.</li>
      <li>so I figured this would be even better.  </li>
      <li>Now I think it smells pretty good</li>
      <li>Silky smooth and great scent too!&lt;br /&gt;Absolutely love, love, love this product and refuse to live without it.&lt;br</li>
      <li>The Pro-Age lotion and body wash are the best products I have used for relief during the winter when my skin gets painfully dry.</li>
      <li>The best is the Intensive/Extra Dry Skin formula.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It is easy to apply all over without leaving you greasy.</li>
      <li>I received this as a Christmas gift along with the hand lotion a few years ago, and found it to be the best I had ever used before.</li>
      <li>this lotion leaves my skin radiant and smooth.</li>
      <li>Makes you feel smooth all over, I shave my legs with it then put some on every night going to bed</li>
      <li>Smells like a cheap sunscreen (it has an SPF 5).  </li>
      <li>One of my favorites  Great value 3-pack with extra bonus ounces</li>
      <li>- It is lightly fragrance and it does stay with you like 24 hours after you use it.</li>
      <li>Please don&#x27;t stop having this available.  </li>
      <li>The reason I order this lotion online, is because I can&#x27;t find it on the store shelf any longer; I love this lotion, and I am very upset with Dove, everytime I find a product that I love</li>
      <li>I was really excited to find this at such a great price.  </li>
      <li>She has tried a lot of different creams and this is by far the best.</li>
      <li>but it does absorb quickly which i like.  </li>
      <li>But since I love all Dove&#x27;s creams and lotions so far, I went ahead and tried it.</li>
      <li>I really can recommend this product it soaks into your skin so quickly</li>
      <li>great product which is hard to find otherwise&lt;</li>
      <li>I definitely will be purchasing this again as well as more of the pro age products.</li>
      <li>I love the dove lotion it has made such a diffence in my skin.</li>
      <li>If someone sits next to you, they will not be able to smell it unless they put their nose on your body.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Leaves my skin smooth and soft.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried many different lotions, which didn&#x27;t really live up to the hype.</li>
      <li>Very high quality ingredients.</li>
      <li>and i will be purchasing you very soon.&lt;br</li>
      <li>It really softens my skin and is not greasy at all.  </li>
      <li>It is not oily and so no one can really tell if you are using lotion.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I like it so much that I order it in the 3-packs</li>
      <li>It really smooths your skin and makes your skin shinier</li>
      <li>I have been using Pro age products since they came out because they really do what they say.</li>
      <li>My skin is lovely and soft to the touch, I only use it at night and after swimming.</li>
      <li>my skin has improved incredibly with this lotion no more dry or flaky absolutely unbeliveable</li>
      <li>less noticable cellulite and very smooth.</li>
      <li>I have been fortunate for several years to have found a body lotion that has made and kept my body very soft.  </li>
      <li>I use it mainly on my arms every night.  </li>
      <li>It is not thick neither</li>
      <li>I love the plain Dove Cream Oil lotions</li>
      <li>My skin is very sensitive and this lotion has not been a problem for me.</li>
      <li>/&gt;There is not a strong smell, just a regular lotion-y kind of smell that is inoffensive.</li>
      <li>had read some reviews prior to buying, and someone had mentioned it had a funny smell, so I was relutant to try it.</li>
      <li>(my skin will be 60 years old on my next birthday) than the other Cream Oil formulas Dove makes, and they smell much better.</li>
      <li>and so you do not need to use a lot to completely fill your body with it.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
      <li>It is very moisturizing, but it definitely has a sticky feeling when it dries.</li>
      <li>, they stop produce it; because like this product, the green tea and cucumber lotion, isn&#x27;t available to purchase in stores.  </li>
      <li>I have looked high and low in retail stores for this lately and have not been able to find it until seeing it on Amazon.</li>
      <li>I look high and low for this lotion.  </li>
      <li>this is the only thing that makes my skin soft.</li>
      <li>I have very dry skin, particularly in the winter.</li>
      <li>Hours later my skin does feel soft and moisturized, but I wish it didn&#x27;t leave such a sticky residue.&lt;br</li>
      <li>This product did it - after a month of using it at morning and night, I have no dry spots, I&#x27;m not breaking out and my skin looks radiant.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Awesome product buy dove! It contains alpha hydroxy acids as well as glycerin and olive oil. Very high quality ingredients. I definitely will be purchasing this again as well as more of the pro age products.</li>
    <li> this lotion leaves my skin radiant and smooth. It is something that i will always want to be apart of my lotion collection. It is even a rather effective hand lotion. my hands look and feel differently when i use it. I have offered it to male friends of mine and they were equally impressed with the feel and smell of this lotion. I will continue to purchase it.</li>
    <li> This product is AWESOME!  I always had dry skin in the Winter and tried many different (expensive) products to no avail.  This product did it - after a month of using it at morning and night, I have no dry spots, I&#x27;m not breaking out and my skin looks radiant.  Love it!</li>
    <li> I was really excited to find this at such a great price.  I love the plain Dove Cream Oil lotions so I figured this would be even better.  I found the AHAs too drying on my already dry skin.  I would apply it and found I would have too apply another lotion on top of it.  After only two days, my hands looked and felt like a desert.  Like another reviewer, I found the smell is disgusting.  Smells like a cheap sunscreen (it has an SPF 5).  I ended up returning it.  I will go back to the plain Dove Cream Oil lotions.</li>
    <li> I love everything Dove!  It really softens my skin and is not greasy at all.  I would recommend buying this product.</li>
    <li> The Pro-Age lotion and body wash are the best products I have used for relief during the winter when my skin gets painfully dry. The relief was almost immediate. When I could no longer find the product at a store, I was truly upset. So glad to have found it on Amazon.</li>
    <li> I have used this lotion for a long time.  I have very dry skin and it works great on my skin.</li>
    <li> I love the dove lotion it has made such a diffence in my skin. less noticable cellulite and very smooth. I have it on autofill thorugh amazon.</li>
    <li> The scent of this lotion makes me physically ill. In spite of its name, it does no more to heal or protect aging skin (my skin will be 60 years old on my next birthday) than the other Cream Oil formulas Dove makes, and they smell much better. The best is the Intensive/Extra Dry Skin formula. The Shea Butter formula doesn&#x27;t smell that great either, but anything is better than the ProAge.</li>
    <li> dove proage lotion is my favourite and most used lotion i own! i love the way it moisturizes my skin, and the way it shines my skin as well. thank you dove proage! and i will be purchasing you very soon.&lt;br /&gt;  herb miller</li>
    <li> the consistency of this \\&quot;oil lotion\\&quot; is like watered-down regular lotion but it does absorb quickly which i like.  probably won&#x27;t buy again because i have a feeling the watery consistency is not moisturizing as well as the thicker lotions.</li>
    <li> Silky smooth and great scent too!&lt;br /&gt;Absolutely love, love, love this product and refuse to live without it.&lt;br /&gt;Can&#x27;t find at my neighborhood Walmart any longer, and am so happy to buy in bulk at Amazon!!!</li>
    <li> I have ordered several &amp;#34;freebies&amp;#34; over the past 8mo. nary to receive a one! I received nail stuff but had to pay for that!</li>
    <li> This was a great buy .. the lotion has the consistency of oil but applies like lotion and it has a pleasant light scent.</li>
    <li> My wife says that this is the best hand cream there is. She has tried a lot of different creams and this is by far the best.</li>
    <li> One of my favorites  Great value 3-pack with extra bonus ounces</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for quite some time . I love it.</li>
    <li> My favorite lotion ever. I think I have tried everything on the market and this is the only thing that makes my skin soft.</li>
    <li> This is a great cream and great for face and body, both. It hydrates beautifully!!&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this cream !!!</li>
    <li> I am a dedicated user of Dove Soap, Creams and Lotions. My favorite was one that I bought out of the country. I can&#x27;t seem to find it anywhere here in the US :( But as I am getting older, I found this lotion as the perfect replacement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had read some reviews prior to buying, and someone had mentioned it had a funny smell, so I was relutant to try it. But since I love all Dove&#x27;s creams and lotions so far, I went ahead and tried it. It did have a strange scent, but nothing awful, and it was not strong either, so I continued the use of it anyway. Now I think it smells pretty good and refreshing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is easy to apply all over without leaving you greasy. Moisturizes very nicely. And after a few weeks, I did notice my skin a little firmer. Sure its not a miracle lotion, but I can tell the difference, and I love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price was good, I didn&#x27;t need all 3, but it was a good deal so I gave one to my mother in law ( by the way, she loves it also! ) one for me, and one for a back up in case I run out....so...2 for me :)</li>
    <li> - It is lightly fragrance and it does stay with you like 24 hours after you use it. If someone sits next to you, they will not be able to smell it unless they put their nose on your body. And so the fragrance part is not really relevant.&lt;br /&gt;- It really smooths your skin and makes your skin shinier which is great.&lt;br /&gt;- It is not very dense and so you do not need to use a lot to completely fill your body with it.&lt;br /&gt;- My skin is very sensitive and this lotion has not been a problem for me. I use it at night. When I go to work and return home, the lotion still stays with me.&lt;br /&gt;- It is not oily and so no one can really tell if you are using lotion.&lt;br /&gt;- It is not thick neither and so you won&#x27;t feel over-heated when using it in like your house or work office, even under a sunny day like 70 F</li>
    <li> The reason I order this lotion online, is because I can&#x27;t find it on the store shelf any longer; I love this lotion, and I am very upset with Dove, everytime I find a product that I love, they stop produce it; because like this product, the green tea and cucumber lotion, isn&#x27;t available to purchase in stores.  Please let me know if the green tea and cucumber lotion can be purchased online...</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve very dry skin. So dry it cracks &amp; bleeds. I&#x27;ve tried many different lotions, which didn&#x27;t really live up to the hype. I&#x27;d given up on finding a lotion that helps. Than along comes Dove with a coupon for Dove Pro-age Cream Oil Lotion. OMG! This stuff actually works. I use it twice a day, after my shower. If for any reason I skip my morning shower, my skin still feels moisturized all day. I don&#x27;t get the dry, flakeies mid day. As an added bonus, it smells good &amp; I often get compliments about how good I smell! If like me, you&#x27;ve really dry skin, than Dove Pro-age is the lotion for you. Try it, you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> I have very dry skin, particularly in the winter. This lotion is thick and creamy; and doesn&#x27;t feel oily though there is oil in it. I like it so much that I order it in the 3-packs because I know I will go through it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is not a strong smell, just a regular lotion-y kind of smell that is inoffensive.</li>
    <li> I have been fortunate for several years to have found a body lotion that has made and kept my body very soft.  I am now in my 70&#x27;s and find people comment on my skin.  It has become hard to find in local stores so have been very happy when I found it on Amazon.</li>
    <li> I received this as a Christmas gift along with the hand lotion a few years ago, and found it to be the best I had ever used before. When it was gone I tried to find it in the stored with no result. It was suggested to me to try Amazon. To my surprise  it was there.&lt;br /&gt;they are the best hand and body lotion I have ever used.</li>
    <li> This is the best lotion ever. Makes you feel smooth all over, I shave my legs with it then put some on every night going to bed and I can go days longer with out shaving . Love it.</li>
    <li> A gruff, military man in my extended family had to use his wife&#x27;s Dove ProAge in a pinch once. I&#x27;d purchased it for her, based on my experiences with it.  She really liked it.  However, HE LOVED IT.  She even caught him with a bottle, stashed from her, lol!!!! I now regularly buy this product for HIM.</li>
    <li> This product is okay... the smell isn&#x27;t unpleasant, but it isn&#x27;t &#x27;pretty&#x27; either. It is very moisturizing, but it definitely has a sticky feeling when it dries. Hours later my skin does feel soft and moisturized, but I wish it didn&#x27;t leave such a sticky residue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t hate it, but I don&#x27;t love it - I probably would not buy this again. It&#x27;s just OK.</li>
    <li> I am a 52 year old with extremely dry and flaky skin. It has plagued me my entire life until I started using this lotion a few years ago. I have looked high and low in retail stores for this lately and have not been able to find it until seeing it on Amazon. Thank goodness!!! my skin has improved incredibly with this lotion no more dry or flaky absolutely unbeliveable BEST EVER  LOVE LOVE LOVE IT!!</li>
    <li> I have used this lotion and I love how it works on my skin.  Too bad I can longer find it in stores I shop.  It is a little too pricey.</li>
    <li> Dove Pro Age Lotion is the only lotion I have used for years.  I was glad to get a 3pack.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been buying this cream oil lotion at local stores for quite a while and then all of a sudden I couldn&#x27;t find it anywhere except here on Amazon. Being a senior citizen any moisturizing you do helps.  I use it mainly on my arms every night.  It absorbs quickly and either the cream is working and the wrinkles are less noticeable or my eyesight is getting worse. Whatever, I will continue using the cream.</li>
    <li> I LOVE THIS PRODUCT AND WAS GLAD I WAS STILL ABLE TO GET IT, EVEN THOUGH THEY NOLONGER SELL IT IN THE STORE. MY DAUGHTER ALSO LIKE THIS PRODUCT , SHE HAS BEEN USING IT FOR A YEAR NOW</li>
    <li> I have been using Pro age products since they came out because they really do what they say. The stores here seem to have stopped selling it so was very glad to find it o n Amazon. I really can recommend this product it soaks into your skin so quickly so you are not left feeling sticky. My skin is lovely and soft to the touch, I only use it at night and after swimming. All I can say is do try it you will be amazed how good it is.</li>
    <li> Excellent ! I can no longer obtain this product in the stores.  I don&#x27;t know where Amazon is getting  it from but Im glad to obtain it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Leaves my skin smooth and soft.</li>
    <li> I look high and low for this lotion.  I just LOVE!!!! it  Please don&#x27;t stop having this available.  It penetrates  into your skin and doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy feeling.  Just LOVE IT</li>
