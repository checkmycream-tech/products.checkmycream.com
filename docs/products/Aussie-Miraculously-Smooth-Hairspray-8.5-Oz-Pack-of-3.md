      <li>I should probably order more</li>
      <li>I can not find this product in many stores around ny area any more .</li>
      <li>This is my MOST favorite hairspray in the world.</li>
      <li>Love it</li>
      <li>It says it&#x27;s hairspray, but really it&#x27;s more the Anti-humidity remedy that all of us girls have been looking for.</li>
      <li>This hairspray is my favorite.  </li>
      <li>I sure wish P&amp;G wouldn&#x27;t get any money for this.</li>
      <li>Love this hair spray.  </li>
      <li>LOVE AUSSIE PRODUCTS.</li>
      <li>but this product does keep my hair from becoming fuzzy in the humidity.</li>
      <li>first i was excited, i received this product for complimentary testing purposes but, after doing so i wasn&#x27;t happy..</li>
      <li>Could not find this anywhere in The Dallas area, ordered by e-mail and it arrived shortly thereafter, in about a week, came at a great price, cheaper than the stores and without tax.</li>
      <li>I had looked for Sydney Smooth for a while and couldn&#x27;t find it.  </li>
      <li>This item is no longer available on grocery store shelves</li>
      <li>I could never find Aussie Sydney Smooth at the store with the lowest level of hold.  </li>
      <li>Aussie three pack is worth the money, your hair stays in place , i love the smell of this hair spray smells clean, i will buy again</li>
      <li>It keeps my hair smooth for at least 12 hours, the BEST!</li>
      <li>And thanks to Amazon for bringing this to us :)</li>
      <li>It smells amazing--it makes my hair smell fresh and clean.</li>
      <li>I wish it was easier to find in stores, but luckily you can still buy it online.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll have to give it a few more weeks to see which one I ultimately like best.</li>
      <li>Exactly as what I bought in the store and as described!  </li>
      <li>True to it&#x27;s description, it&#x27;s really great on my naturally curly hair, especially in the south Texas humidity.</li>
      <li>I live in a humid climate and this spray really holds up you hair nicely.  </li>
      <li>It holds well and was a great price compared to what I usually pay.</li>
      <li>work in Adult Education and can easily give these three bottles to my students, but</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m an Aussie user from way back, but I&#x27;ve never tried this particular kind of hairspray.</li>
      <li>I style first, then spritz it all over and then use Aussie&#x27;s Freeze Hairspray to keep it all day.</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t say that it has made my hair LOOK silkier, but it certainly feels that way.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m ready for my close up.</li>
      <li>The Sydney Smooth hairspray has yellow writing for both those words.</li>
      <li>She absolutely loves it and cannot go without it.</li>
      <li>I like it because it works very well to keep your hair in place but not create an impenetrable barrier on your head.</li>
      <li>It really does fight humidity&#x27;s effects on your hair</li>
      <li>Really works..</li>
      <li>I always find the Super-Extreme or Instant-Freeze or Carbide/Tungsten tip or Diamond-Coat hold but never the very minimum</li>
      <li>I holds really well</li>
      <li>Tresemme really does hold your style, even after you comb it out.</li>
      <li>It holds great and doesn&#x27;t make your hair stiff!!!</li>
      <li>Live in Florida and thanks to our humidity</li>
      <li>I use this on a daily basis for my naturally super curly hair.</li>
      <li>If I add it to my hair while wet, it leaves my hair so smooth to the touch once it dries.</li>
      <li>Light hold (doesnt really hold much into place but makes hair wuite hard).</li>
      <li>It is not stiff nor sticky, in any type of weather.</li>
      <li>It keeps stray hairs in place and adds a lot of bounce to my natural curls.</li>
      <li>With Aussie, the natural humidity in the house made my hair lose it&#x27;s style, before I even went out into the melting snow day.</li>
      <li>My husband developed a lung problem</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t tell a difference as far as humidity though.</li>
      <li>I have fine, hard to hold hair and have always had to use a fine aerosol mist to avoid weighting down.  </li>
      <li>Just what I wanted to calm the hair down.</li>
      <li>my wife loves this stuff she say nothing works as well for her fine thin hair</li>

<li> A Floridian myself, I feel her pain; my hair is often dry and frizzy.</li>
<li> For some reason this hair spray is getting harder to find in stores.  </li>

<li> Come on Aussie, reconsider your decision as it beats all the expensive products hands down and is a necessary item for us Floridians!!!!!</li>
<li> I use it everyday, but doesn&#x27;t make it greasy or hard to style.  </li>
<li> I am not pleased with this product and now i am stuck with three bottles.</li>
<li> I have used Aussie products for a long time but have been unable to find this hairspray anywhere.  </li>
<li> I like that my hair don&#x27;t get &#x27;hard&#x27; from using this.  </li>
<li> and it got hard to find in stores lately.</li>
<li> Also, my dogs never liked to be around when I was spraying my hair.  </li>
<li> I did not know when I purchased this that it was made by Proctor &amp; Gamble, a company that continues to unnecessarily test its products and product ingredients on animals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> Even in Florida in your Grandparents car, with the A/C broken.</li>
<li> Unfortunately none of the stores here carry it anymore</li>

    <li> My favorite hair product! I have curly hair and this is the best product I&#x27;ve ever used, they don&#x27;t have it in the store anymore so I always buy it online. It keeps my hair smooth for at least 12 hours, the BEST!</li>
    <li> Best hair product ever</li>
    <li> Smells great and works great too. Love it</li>
    <li> I have used Aussie products for a long time but have been unable to find this hairspray anywhere.  I love it and was so glad to find some.  I should probably order more so I can continue to use it.</li>
    <li> I have been a hair stylist since 1980 and this is the best product I have used to keep your hair from frizzing in humid weather and it just to feel like silk.  I also use Aussie&#x27;s Freeze hair spray and it is still silky, but keeps my hair as I put it all day.  Just Amazing products.  It says it&#x27;s hairspray, but really it&#x27;s more the Anti-humidity remedy that all of us girls have been looking for. I use it everyday, but doesn&#x27;t make it greasy or hard to style.  I style first, then spritz it all over and then use Aussie&#x27;s Freeze Hairspray to keep it all day.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a Christmas gift for our daughter because she loves the product but cannot find it locally. She absolutely loves it and cannot go without it.</li>
    <li> This does not hold your style at all! That said, I recommend Tresemme all day humidity resistance. Tresemme really does hold your style, even after you comb it out. With Aussie, the natural humidity in the house made my hair lose it&#x27;s style, before I even went out into the melting snow day.</li>
    <li> Very good product! It works perfectly as anti-humidity. Congrats to Aussie for this product. I do recommend. And thanks to Amazon for bringing this to us :)</li>
    <li> This product does not work in humid climates. Also it left a lot of buildup in my hair. I am not pleased with this product and now i am stuck with three bottles.</li>
    <li> Awesome!  Fantastic! This item is no longer available on grocery store shelves and I&#x27;ve used it for 12 years after moving to Texas.  I&#x27;m delighted to find it available.</li>
    <li> I did not know when I purchased this that it was made by Proctor &amp; Gamble, a company that continues to unnecessarily test its products and product ingredients on animals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would never knowingly purchase a P&amp;G product. Amazon won&#x27;t let me return this, because it&#x27;s liquid (didn&#x27;t know about that little return policy, either).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I work in Adult Education and can easily give these three bottles to my students, but I sure wish P&amp;G wouldn&#x27;t get any money for this.</li>
    <li> Just enough hold without being hard.  Unfortunately none of the stores here carry it anymore so I have to get it online.</li>
    <li> my wife loves this stuff she say nothing works as well for her fine thin hair and it got hard to find in stores lately.</li>
    <li> I have always been a fan of Aussie&#x27;s Sprunch spray but after reading several reviews, I decided to try this. True to it&#x27;s description, it&#x27;s really great on my naturally curly hair, especially in the south Texas humidity. I&#x27;ll have to give it a few more weeks to see which one I ultimately like best.</li>
    <li> Live in Florida and thanks to our humidity my thick hair always goes flat after I style it. Years ago I started using this product and HAVE ALWAYS BEEN thrilled by it. Just like the bottle stated, 12 hours of anti-humidity. Even in Florida in your Grandparents car, with the A/C broken. Have been having problems finding it and just found out from Aussie they have discontinued making it. WHY???? Come on Aussie, reconsider your decision as it beats all the expensive products hands down and is a necessary item for us Floridians!!!!!</li>
    <li> This is my MOST favorite hairspray in the world. It never leaves my hair crunchy or stiff and never leaves any nasty residue after use. I use this on a daily basis for my naturally super curly hair. Best stuff ever!</li>
    <li> Good hair spray...way too pricey...</li>
    <li> I can not find this product in many stores around ny area any more . So great to be able to buy it in bigger quantities for a great price. I will be purchasing this again</li>
    <li> I purchased this product because A) it was on sale, and B) another reviewer mentioned how nice it made her hair feel in the Florida humidity. A Floridian myself, I feel her pain; my hair is often dry and frizzy. I needed hairspray, so I decided to give this one a shot. I love this product! It smells amazing--it makes my hair smell fresh and clean. If I add it to my hair while wet, it leaves my hair so smooth to the touch once it dries. I can&#x27;t say that it has made my hair LOOK silkier, but it certainly feels that way. It keeps stray hairs in place and adds a lot of bounce to my natural curls. I&#x27;m very pleased and would purchase again (when I run out, that is...it will take a long time for me to go through three bottles!)</li>
    <li> THIS IS THE BEST SPRAY ON HUMID DAYS. IT HOLDS AND WILL NOT LET YOUR HAIR LOSE CURL OR VOLUME. LOVE AUSSIE PRODUCTS.</li>
    <li> Love this hair spray.  I holds really well and then washes out without leaving a residue. Wish I could buy it locally without having to order it.</li>
    <li> This is the only hair spray my teenage daughter will use.  It holds down the flyaway hairs without making it stiff.</li>
    <li> I have fine, hard to hold hair and have always had to use a fine aerosol mist to avoid weighting down.  My husband developed a lung problem so I had to investigate non-aerosol sprays.  Also, my dogs never liked to be around when I was spraying my hair.  This product is perfect and I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> It is not stiff nor sticky, in any type of weather. Have used it for years and will continue to do so as long as I can continue to get it through Amazon. All the stores where I use to get it no longer carry it. ;-(</li>
    <li> If you want an anti-freeze that is not oily / greasy / nasty, this is it. It works perfectly, I don&#x27;t understand how/why they&#x27;re discontinuing this product, get it while you can!</li>
    <li> I use this hairspray on humid days and it does the job.  I was hoping for a softer feel to my hair but this product does keep my hair from becoming fuzzy in the humidity.</li>
    <li> Just what I wanted to calm the hair down. Pump works well and the smell is pleasant. What else do you want?</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m an Aussie user from way back, but I&#x27;ve never tried this particular kind of hairspray. It holds well and was a great price compared to what I usually pay. I can&#x27;t tell a difference as far as humidity though.</li>
    <li> For some reason this hair spray is getting harder to find in stores.  I&#x27;ve been buying this on Amazon for about 2 years now.  I like that my hair don&#x27;t get &#x27;hard&#x27; from using this.  It really does fight humidity&#x27;s effects on your hair (my hair never gets frizzy when I use it).</li>
    <li> Aussie three pack is worth the money, your hair stays in place , i love the smell of this hair spray smells clean, i will buy again</li>
    <li> first i was excited, i received this product for complimentary testing purposes but, after doing so i wasn&#x27;t happy.. once i sprayed it i automatically disliked the smell and once i sprayed it, it turned my hair feel gross and didn&#x27;t like that.. its good for in a pinch but, other then that thumbs down</li>
    <li> I thought I was ordering the Aussie \\&quot;Sydney Smooth\\&quot; hair spray, but this was not it. The Sydney Smooth hairspray has yellow writing for both those words. This instead, was the Aussie \\&quot;Miraculously Smooth\\&quot; and is not the same, not in texture nor smell, so beware.</li>
    <li> I could never find Aussie Sydney Smooth at the store with the lowest level of hold.  I always find the Super-Extreme or Instant-Freeze or Carbide/Tungsten tip or Diamond-Coat hold but never the very minimum so I went on Amazon and there it was.  I like it because it works very well to keep your hair in place but not create an impenetrable barrier on your head.</li>
    <li> Love it!!  Really works..</li>
    <li> This hairspray is my favorite.  I live in a humid climate and this spray really holds up you hair nicely.  I love that you can get it in a 3pk. and that they are still selling it.  I had looked for Sydney Smooth for a while and couldn&#x27;t find it.  I finally realized they just changed the name.  I wish it was easier to find in stores, but luckily you can still buy it online.</li>
