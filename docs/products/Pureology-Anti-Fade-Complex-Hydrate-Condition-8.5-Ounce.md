      <li>Nice smell.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m kind of a product junkie</li>
      <li>It is very strong.</li>
      <li>This by far is one of the best!</li>
      <li>Received this product quickly and in good condition.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m also not a fan of menthol/minty/tea tree stuff in my hair products - more b/c of the smell than the tingly feeling - and this had just that.</li>
      <li>I LOVE the pureology hydrate line.  </li>
      <li>I absolutely love Pureology products.  </li>
      <li>My hair looks best with Pureology&#x27;s sulfate-free shampoo and conditioner - especially in the &amp;#34;Hydrate&amp;#34; version.</li>
      <li>I also love how it makes my body tingle from the menthols as it rinses from my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I absolutely love this shampoo and the conditioner.</li>
      <li>My favorite conditioner.</li>
      <li>I love the smell of</li>
      <li>I also love how it makes my body tingle from the menthols as it rinses from my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I truly love this condition..</li>
      <li>and I love Pureology&#x27;s antifade protection, as I do get my hair colored.  </li>
      <li>People have complimented me on how healthy and shiny my hair looks.</li>
      <li>And even with all this abuse, the Pureology conditioner still manages to make my hair look healthy and shiny.</li>
      <li>It looks full and has nice movement.</li>
      <li>My hair is silky smooth with zero fly aways (which I normally have an abundance of).</li>
      <li>Her hair is gorgeous - smooth and glossy (although she rarely puts heat to it and rarely colors).</li>
      <li>It moisturizes perfectly without weighing my hair down</li>
      <li>(I have baby fine highlighted and lowlighted hair, but a lot of it.)</li>
      <li>hair is in good condition, color treated, fine and straight but full.</li>
      <li>/&gt;There are no sulfates, which is HUGE.  </li>
      <li>I have been using pureology for a few years now and it is the best you can use.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Currently, I am using the Redken Color Extend and feel this product works just as well for my color, smells better, and is more reasonably priced.</li>
      <li>I love the minty fragrance (it contains peppermint oil) as it makes my hair smell fresh and clean for days.</li>
      <li>I love this conditioner by Pureology, leaves my hair silky soft but still with body and most important, keeps my hair coloring from fading.  </li>
      <li>it&#x27;s worth every dollar and penny!</li>
      <li>This is the best conditioner I have ever used - only a little is needed - I love it!</li>
      <li>For $25 I really expected great.</li>
      <li>I detangle my hair while I&#x27;m in the shower and rely on a good conditioner to help comb it out in a relatively short amount of time.</li>
      <li>Like many women, I am very picky about my hair.</li>
      <li>I suggest tried and true, CAT Protein by Redken.  </li>
      <li>The true test was the effect on my hair.  </li>
      <li>I thought I&#x27;d made a huge mistake when I was using it the first time.</li>
      <li>I have fine, straight hair</li>
      <li>My hair feels MUCH fuller, is very smooth and is SO much easier to brush, after showering or any time during the day.</li>
      <li>So, I feel like I&#x27;m probably throwing away $6 worth of conditioner because I can&#x27;t it out of the bottle.</li>
      <li>I tried the Pureology Hydrate after it was recommended by my colorist who promised it would help my hair retain that fresh from the salon color.&lt;br</li>
      <li>The Pureology feels good when my hair is wet, and makes it easier to comb through.</li>
      <li>To truely test my theory I purchased another bottle of the exact type of Pureology at Ulta and used it today.  </li>
      <li>can&#x27;t justify spending this kind of money for a product that doesn&#x27;t do what it promises to do for my red hair.</li>
      <li>SO worth the money</li>
      <li>She admitted that if your hair is very healthy, then it can be a bit much for daily use.&lt;br</li>
      <li>This conditioner makes my hair soft, easy to comb through and able to hold a curl better than any other I&#x27;ve tried and the minty scent and sensation start my day on a positive note!</li>
      <li>I have very fine hair and have been using permanent hair color for the last decade or so.</li>
      <li>That means, that it is super gentle, and will not allow your color to fade.  </li>
      <li>My hair smells really nice when dry</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m on a tight budget, but I heard good things about it</li>
      <li>: after just two minutes on, it leaves the hair amazingly soft and smooth to the touch.</li>
      <li>This is a wonderful product, but someone is selling it or obtaining it from someone that is selling it illegally.  </li>
      <li>I thought all conditioners were the same, and used cheaper brands like Garnier Fructis or Suave most of the time.</li>
      <li>It is not descriptive enough, however, to describe it as appropriate for all &amp;#34;dry color treated hair.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>leaves your hair soft and smooth</li>
      <li>This is my favorite  after trying several.</li>
      <li>Most of the Pureology reviews are glowing; however, I did not have the same experience.</li>
      <li>I love this product, I&#x27;ve been using for several years.</li>
      <li>If you have damaged/frizzy/thick hair, give Pureology a whirl -- it really works!</li>
      <li>Love this conditioner, its the only product I use.</li>
      <li>Overall, it&#x27;s okay,</li>
      <li>/&gt;So, in short, this product is great for people with dry, coarse, and curly/wavy hair who want to condition their hair and seek greater control over it.</li>
      <li>I have used this product for several years and it is a great cure for dry and damaged hair.</li>
      <li>It gives me greater control over styling and is pretty much de rigueur for guys with my growth pattern in Asian hair salons.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Looks very much like the real thing, but after watching my hair lose it&#x27;s color I tossed it.  </li>
      <li>I have been using this product for over a year and it is a wonderful everyday conditioner that goes extremely well with Pureology Colour Care shampoo.  </li>
      <li>It smells similar but not as strong.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This is a wonderful product, but someone is selling it or obtaining it from someone that is selling it illegally.  This is a salon only product, and is guaranteed ONLY if purchased in a salon.  Please support your stylists.</li>
    <li> Holy Grail all the way.  I have thick, long, normal (in a dry climate) and thin hair, and this does a perfect job of detangling without weighing me down.  Only a very small amount is needed, so that umber expensive bottle is lasting me along time.  Peppermint is yummy but not as tingly as Nioxin.  Only thing I&#x27;ll purchase in this line.  I&#x27;m not a brand loyalist by any means.</li>
    <li> Very please with purchase overall. Shipping was on time and lots of precaution was taken to ensure package would arrive unharmed- lots of packing material, etc.</li>
    <li> This product was highly recommended so I gave the shampoo and conditioner a chance, but for the expensive cost of the products it really doesn&#x27;t deliver much. I have fine, straight hair and it made it limp and frizzy at the ends. My less expensive drug store brands do better than this costly product. Not worth the price in my estimation.</li>
    <li> Received this product quickly and in good condition.  I think this is one of the best conditioners I have used.</li>
    <li> I was happy to get another bottle of Pureology Hydrate Conditioner after running out this summer and using something else.  I&#x27;ve always got great results from it and I&#x27;ll continue to use this as long as I keep colouring my hair.  Only thing I wonder is if they may have changed the formulation as it seems to not make my hair as soft as I remember it being before.  I&#x27;ll give it four stars this time around.</li>
    <li> I have been using pureology for a few years now and it is the best you can use.  It makes your hair feel healthy and smells good.</li>
    <li> I read a bunch of rave reviews for this online - especially from gals with thick, curly hair like mine. This just didn&#x27;t do it for me. I detangle my hair while I&#x27;m in the shower and rely on a good conditioner to help comb it out in a relatively short amount of time. Not only did this not provide any slip, it didn&#x27;t even make my hair feel soft afterward. I&#x27;m also not a fan of menthol/minty/tea tree stuff in my hair products - more b/c of the smell than the tingly feeling - and this had just that.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t believe I did not take notice of the reviews that mention the smell of this product. It is very strong. I thought I&#x27;d made a huge mistake when I was using it the first time. I would not have bought this had I smelled the peppermint in the store BUT...my hair looks and feels great! It looks full and has nice movement. My hair smells really nice when dry (I am very surprised.) The conditioner is so thick that when squeezed out of the bottle it comes out in a ribbon that holds its shape. The price is ridiculous and I&#x27;m not going to say its worth every penny but for what its worth I will be buying more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair is in good condition, color treated, fine and straight but full. I used Pureology volume shampoo and Bain de Terre Recovery Complex in combination with this conditioner.</li>
    <li> Does a great job when used with shampoo.  Leaves no residue and protects color.</li>
    <li> I have been using the companion Pureology Serious Colour Care, Antifade Complex, Hydrate Shampoo for about a year and have noticed that my color/highlights last longer than with other colour care shampoos but this conditioner has really made a difference in the colour and texture of my hair. I have a few red highlights (hardest to keep) that haven&#x27;t faded at all in 4 months. This conditioner makes my hair soft, easy to comb through and able to hold a curl better than any other I&#x27;ve tried and the minty scent and sensation start my day on a positive note!</li>
    <li> I have very dry, thick ,curly hair and on top of that I have bleached my hair and I flat iron it everyday..- I have used all the shampoos under the sun ranging from $1 a bottle to $50. This is the only stuff that works. I was about to give up hope on my hair because it was so damaged ..that was when I went into the salon store and the lady who saw my hair recommended Pureology. I have long hair and about a nickel size of this shampoo and conditioner is more than enough to clean and condition my hair. My hair looks like and feels like it did before I ever bleached or colored it. And, unlike other products the results are lasting.Now everytime someone compliments me on my hair  I recommend  this product. This really is the BEST stuff out there trust me I know! SO worth the money..when you try this stuff you wont go back !-.</li>
    <li> I thought that I was getting a good deal, with added convenience.  Turns out this product is a fake.  It smells similar but not as strong.  The true test was the effect on my hair.  I&#x27;ve been using it for over a month and my hair has suffered.  I have used Pureology for 8 years and I know the wonderful things it does for my hair.  Not the case after using this product.  To truely test my theory I purchased another bottle of the exact type of Pureology at Ulta and used it today.  In ONE day I could immediately tell the difference.  Spend and extra $10 and buy your Pureology in a salon where it is guaranteed to be genuine.</li>
    <li> This is one of the greatest conditioners that I have ever used... and that is saying a lot.  I&#x27;m kind of a product junkie and I will definitely keep this conditioner as one of my must haves.  It moisturizes perfectly without weighing my hair down and I love Pureology&#x27;s antifade protection, as I do get my hair colored.  It has a great minty smell that is energizing for morning hair washers and it kind of tingles on your scalp.  I love it!</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t dry my hair out, but can be a little heavy. My hair is thick, full but fine. Nice smell. Lasts a long time.</li>
    <li> I have curly hair that is prone to dryness and not much shine.  My hair is also highlighted.  Double whammy!  This product immediately improved the feel and shine of my hair.  Styling is so much easier.  Only negative is the shape of the bottle.  It is awkward, and the flow of the product out of the bottle is not great.</li>
    <li> I abuse my hair badly. I highlight it, I blow dry it daily, I straighten it obsessively. I wash it often and without mercy, but using this shampoo you&#x27;d never tell! The peppermint scent is wonderful and wakes me up in the morning. My hair is silky smooth with zero fly aways (which I normally have an abundance of). People have complimented me on how healthy and shiny my hair looks. Unlike most \\&quot;hydrating\\&quot; or \\&quot;healing\\&quot; conditioners, I actually feel this one start working the second I use it. I highly recommend this for anyone who has color treated, heat treated, dry, frizzy, curly, or wavy hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Spend the extra money for this line, you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> I love this conditioner by Pureology, leaves my hair silky soft but still with body and most important, keeps my hair coloring from fading.  HOWEVER, the bottle I received from Amazon was NOT the real thing.  It is cheaper than in the salon, but when you consider how much professional hair coloring is, this is no bargain.  My hair color began to fade shortly after starting this bottle and when I looked at the bottle close up, I realized that it was different than the Pureology I buy at the stylist&#x27;s shop.  The labeling was not embossed directly on the bottle but was clear stickers stuck to the bottle. I have never seen this before.  Looks very much like the real thing, but after watching my hair lose it&#x27;s color I tossed it.  The fragrance is a little different, too.  Will NOT order this item from Amazon again.</li>
    <li> I Love this Conditioner!!!  I have used it for five years and it is the ONLY conditioner I use!!!</li>
    <li> I have very fine hair and have been using permanent hair color for the last decade or so. For as long as I can remember, my hair would fall out in clumps every time I showered. I thought all conditioners were the same, and used cheaper brands like Garnier Fructis or Suave most of the time. After a stylist recommended I switch to using Pureology products, (especially the conditioner), I&#x27;ve only lost a few strands here and there. My hair feels MUCH fuller, is very smooth and is SO much easier to brush, after showering or any time during the day. It gets way less tangled when I run my fingers through. I&#x27;d definitely recommend this product to anyone with this hair type!!</li>
    <li> A little goes a long way- your hair is silky &amp; your scalp tingles &amp; smells like menthol.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love Pureology products.  I color my own hair so I have to be very careful about drying out my hair or using harsh products.  This by far is one of the best!</li>
    <li> My HG, hands down. I have tons of fine hair, so it&#x27;s very thick but also fragile. I have to use a heavy duty Elchim dryer if I want my hair to dry in less than an hour, so it gets a lot of heat. It is also color treated, so it can be very dry and hold lots of static. After a recent phase of strightening it every day, my poor hair was fried! And even with all this abuse, the Pureology conditioner still manages to make my hair look healthy and shiny. Unlike other conditioners, it doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down, nor does it make it look dull. I love the minty fragrance (it contains peppermint oil) as it makes my hair smell fresh and clean for days. So okay, it IS expensive, but you don&#x27;t need to use very much of it to obtain amazing results. If you have damaged/frizzy/thick hair, give Pureology a whirl -- it really works!</li>
    <li> I use this along with my Purology Shampoo, a little goes a long way &amp; the mint scent gives a nice tingle to your scalp.</li>
    <li> Even if you don&#x27;t want to go for the shampoo, you have to have the conditioner!  It makes my hair feel amazing, silky smooth but not weighted down like with other conditioners.  It smells great and healthy too!</li>
    <li> I LOVE the pureology hydrate line.  I have been using this personally and selling this to my clients for the past two years, and it is my favorite for most people.  The only people I don&#x27;t recommend this for, are those with ultra healthy, fine hair, as it can weigh your hair down if your hair is too fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are no sulfates, which is HUGE.  That means, that it is super gentle, and will not allow your color to fade.  If your color does fade while using this, then your hair is too porous and you might consider using a protein treatment every shampoo, for about a week prior to your next coloring.  I suggest tried and true, CAT Protein by Redken.  Just spray it on, work it around, and allow to sit while you shave your legs, or just relax.  It will feel in all of the hole that have been \\&quot;eaten\\&quot; out of your hair by bleach, or damage.  Finally, continue using pureology and your hair will feel great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this for all of my clients with the following hair types:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Naturally Curly&lt;br /&gt;wavy&lt;br /&gt;Permed (please tell me that there are not very many of you out there that still perm)&lt;br /&gt;Highlighted&lt;br /&gt;Colored&lt;br /&gt;Dry&lt;br /&gt;Brittle&lt;br /&gt;Environmentally damaged&lt;br /&gt;Heat damaged&lt;br /&gt;Thick&lt;br /&gt;Coarse&lt;br /&gt;dull&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please don&#x27;t use very much, as it is extremely concentrated.  Put a quarter size dollop (or less) in your palm, and emulsify it in your hands, then gently pat it down the top layer of your wet hair.  Then start to massage it in, and within a minute, it will start to \\&quot;melt\\&quot; through your hair, and soften it.  If you have trouble getting it out of the bottle, because it is so thick and concentrated, tip it upside down and tap the bottle against the palm of your hand, and it will all drop to the top, so that you can squeeze it out.  Then when you are almost finished with your bottle, add a bit of water to it, and shake it real good, you will then be able to utilize every bit of the product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enjoy the invigorating scent!  I do have a few clients that don&#x27;t love the smell of the menthols at first, but am told that it grows on them in time.  I also love how it makes my body tingle from the menthols as it rinses from my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a must buy for almost all!g scent!

    <li> This one is really good stuff like Purology always is . I would get this again!  This is the best ever this brand!</li>
    <li> Not happy with product item smelled different then my past salon product and the item was sent 10 min from my home and took 10 days to get it</li>
    <li> I am shampoo/conditioner snob and this stuff is absolutely dreamy. I dyed my dirty blonde hair black over and over, eventually tired of it and bleached the hell out of it and this stuff made ALL the difference! I bought some other salon-brand s/c, spent more $ and was very disappointed. Nothing compares to this stuff. I just wish it wasn&#x27;t so pricey! The raised the price at Pure Beauty so I went to the internet for a deal, which I found, but it&#x27;s still a little steep--but worth it.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for several years and it is a great cure for dry and damaged hair.</li>
    <li> I love this product, I&#x27;ve been using for several years.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my daughter and she loves it. Her hair is gorgeous - smooth and glossy (although she rarely puts heat to it and rarely colors).</li>
    <li> I love this conditioner! I have super thick hair thats also has keratin treatment and this conditioner works wonderfully! It doesn&#x27;t take much so one bottle lasts awhile. Smells nice too!</li>
    <li> the only conditioner i can use on my hair that actually works. the BEST. the very best.</li>
    <li> This is the only conditioner I will use. It keeps your hair soft and doesn&#x27;t leave it frizzy! Highly recommended....</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know why I bother trying other brands anymore. My hair looks best with Pureology&#x27;s sulfate-free shampoo and conditioner - especially in the &amp;#34;Hydrate&amp;#34; version.</li>
    <li> Like many women, I am very picky about my hair. (I have baby fine highlighted and lowlighted hair, but a lot of it.) I tried the Pureology Hydrate after it was recommended by my colorist who promised it would help my hair retain that fresh from the salon color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of all of the pureology lines, the hydrate has the least offending scent.  I tried samples of all of the pureology lines, before purchasing the hydrate line and many of the pureology products actually smell terrible, which made it hard to use on a daily basis.  However, the hydrate line&#x27;s conditioner has a minty smell  (think aveda&#x27;s rosemary mint fragrance).  I have used this product for the last three months on a daily basis.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After daily use for two weeks, I felt that my hair had a film, a residue. My hair felt like it had an enormous amount of product in it, when I hadn&#x27;t. I would then have to use a clarifying shampoo such as Bumble and Bumble Sunday Shampoo.  When I asked my colorist about the film, she stated it is because the pureology hydrate line is geared for people with seriously damaged hair and is fabulous for healing such damage.  She admitted that if your hair is very healthy, then it can be a bit much for daily use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave this conditioner three stars for the following reasons:  (1) the residue, and (2) this conditioner is expensive for the what you actually get.  If you&#x27;re willing to pay this, then pay an extra $5 and get the kerastase bain satin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the positive side, (1) this product is 100% natural and (2) my color did look fabulous.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Currently, I am using the Redken Color Extend and feel this product works just as well for my color, smells better, and is more reasonably priced.</li>
    <li> Love this conditioner, its the only product I use. Leaves my hair soft and shiny without weighing it down.</li>
    <li> This is the only product I will use on my hair</li>
    <li> leaves your hair soft and smooth</li>
    <li> This product is excellent for hydration, just as Pureology labels it to be. It is not descriptive enough, however, to describe it as appropriate for all &amp;#34;dry color treated hair.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To preface, my hair, left untreated, is extremely coarse and wavy, with difficult-to-tame cowlicks to boot. It is dry, from coloring, but I have recently begun chemically straightening my hair again. It gives me greater control over styling and is pretty much de rigueur for guys with my growth pattern in Asian hair salons.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, regarding the conditioner, I believe the Hydrate Condition would be the perfect product for my hair were I not to straighten it: after just two minutes on, it leaves the hair amazingly soft and smooth to the touch. The problem is, the conditioning agents really, really weigh down your hair, such that it is difficult to achieve any lift, even with heat styling. (I imagine people with thin hair would have similar experiences.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, in short, this product is great for people with dry, coarse, and curly/wavy hair who want to condition their hair and seek greater control over it. If you have thin or straight hair and wish to build a bit of volume when styling, you might want to look for a lighter product. (NB: I only noticed after purchasing/using this product that it also comes in a &amp;#34;Light&amp;#34; version.)</li>
    <li> This product is VERY pricey and I&#x27;m on a tight budget, but I heard good things about it so I thought I&#x27;d give it a try.  I&#x27;ve used it religiously along with the Anti-Fade shampoo.  I also follow all the rules for keeping red hair vibrant: don&#x27;t wash for 48 hours after coloring, don&#x27;t shampoo too often, wear a hat in the sun, and don&#x27;t use heat styling products too often.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was pretty upset to see that the red color rinses off my hair in the shower when I wash it, just like with other anti-fade products.  Having used both the shampoo and conditioner for 3 months, I have to say that my red hair hasn&#x27;t stayed any more vibrant than when I used other less expensive fade protection products.  The color looks drab after 2 weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t justify spending this kind of money for a product that doesn&#x27;t do what it promises to do for my red hair.</li>
    <li> Feels tingly. Adds moisture yo hair. My favorite conditioner.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this shampoo and the conditioner. I finally found exactly what I needed for my extremely dry hair. It&#x27;s expensive but totally worth it! You only need to use a little bit to get the benefits and the amount of time spent in the morning struggling to style your hair is cut in half. It leaves my hair so soft and silky. Smells so good too.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for over a year and it is a wonderful everyday conditioner that goes extremely well with Pureology Colour Care shampoo.  This product won&#x27;t fade your hightlights and won&#x27;t dry out your hair. I like the nice tingly feeling and the scent isn&#x27;t overpowering either.</li>
    <li> This is the best conditioner I have ever used - only a little is needed - I love it!</li>
    <li> Most of the Pureology reviews are glowing; however, I did not have the same experience. Don&#x27;t get me wrong, it&#x27;s a good conditioner - good, but not great. For $25 I really expected great. I have blonde highlighted hair that is wavy-ish and has a tendency to get dry and frizzy. I need a serious moisturizing conditioner to keep my hair shiny and healthy. The Pureology feels good when my hair is wet, and makes it easier to comb through. But, once it&#x27;s dry, I don&#x27;t see any improvement in the shine. Plus, after finishing a bottle, I haven&#x27;t seen any improvement in the dryness or frizziness. The worst part is the odd-shaped bottle. It is extremely difficult to get the conditioner out, especially after about half is gone. So, I feel like I&#x27;m probably throwing away $6 worth of conditioner because I can&#x27;t it out of the bottle. Not sure what I think of the smell - it&#x27;s minty bordering on menthol-y, which can be invigorating before work in the morning, but certainly doesn&#x27;t inspire any romance when getting ready for an evening out. Overall, it&#x27;s okay, but in my opinion, not worth the price.</li>
    <li> Best condition ever, it has a minty fresh scent as well as feeling on your scalp when you have it on so it&#x27;s very relaxing and your hair feels so silky soft after you rinse it. it&#x27;s worth every dollar and penny!</li>
    <li> I truly love this condition..it is not heavy on your hair.&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t make your hair greasy. I love the smell of it.&lt;br /&gt;I think the price was really good through Amazon. It was more than half off.&lt;br /&gt;I would tell everyone to buy this product. Very satified....JC</li>
    <li> Moisturizes  my hair really well.  This is my favorite  after trying several.</li>
    <li> Best conditioner ever!  Don&#x27;t know that I&#x27;ll ever be able to use another kind! Detangles better than any other product I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
