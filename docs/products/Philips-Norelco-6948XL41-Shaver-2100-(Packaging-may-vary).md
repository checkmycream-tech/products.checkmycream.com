<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Does shave my face very well, so it is under my sink.</li>
    <li> I really like how simple it is and easy to use (like my last shaver), i even like the fact that its usable even while on the Charger which was the biggest Con for my previous Shaver. The three blades are Smooth and can glide across my face no problem without pain!...my only reason to give this product 4 stars is because the Trimmer part isn&#x27;t as strong as i hoped to for when i have my &amp;#34;WareWolf&amp;#34; days. Other then that for the price its pretty darn amazing</li>
    <li> We returned this item. It was junk. I guess you get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> Very slow and weak motor even on a full charge.  It&#x27;s the first Norelco shaver that I was disappointed in.</li>
    <li> Weak motor may die earlier than expected</li>
    <li> after a few uses, just finding that the shave could be a little closer and the power of the shaver (even when plugged in) seems to be on the low side.&lt;br /&gt;this is a replacement after coming from a straight shaver, and it feels like the older shaver did a closer shave.</li>
    <li> This was for my grandson and he loves it.</li>
    <li> This is definitely a budget shave. If you can afford a better one I would recommend doing it. I can go into a long review but I don&#x27;t see the need, you get what you pay for. This razor feels cheap. The heads are not very flexible and the groomer is not very sturdy. The whole head has to come off to clean it unlike better razors that can just flip open easily to allow occasional cleaning. It&#x27;s a pain to clean and it cannot get wet. I have bought many electric razors and I can tell you that this will get the job done but like I said before, get a better one if you can afford it.</li>
    <li> It gave mea rash, I gave it away to my brother and he liked it.</li>
    <li> Great product - Hubby loves it.</li>
    <li> Yet to open..its a present..looks good...</li>
    <li> A great shave for what it&#x27;s intended. I use it as a clean-up shave after my initial Monday razor shave, it does well at cleaning up one day growth but on anything more then that it doesn&#x27;t do quite as well which is why I did not give it 5 stars.</li>
    <li> the shaver sounds real &amp;#34;wimpy&amp;#34;;  maybe that&#x27;s an improvement over older electric shavers, I haven&#x27;t used an electric for some time. I like the quiet, but tend to think that the lack of noise related to the fact that it also doesn&#x27;t take care of my &amp;#34; light&amp;#34; whiskers, (it takes me a week or two to get a &amp;#34;5 o&#x27;clock shadow&amp;#34;).  But . . . . I work at it, push hard and go back and forth against the grain, and finally wind up with a passable shave.  I think that even though it was one of the least expensive Philips Norelco shavers around, it seems kind of pricey.</li>
    <li> My husband purchased this product a few months ago and it still working great.  I love the way it leaves his face nice and smooth.</li>
    <li> it ran quiter than my old one, and cleaned up easier. i would reccomend it for performance and a good value</li>
    <li> GREAT FATHERS DAY GIFT OR JUST AN ANYTIME GIFT FOR SOMEONE IT IS RECHARGEABLE AND THE CHARGE LASTS FOR A WEEK VERY NICE</li>
    <li> I had been looking for a good deal on a razor, and I believe this is it. Shaves quick and smooth</li>
    <li> good quality, good price</li>
    <li> I have to admit that I am female. That may seem odd when you read a review about a man&#x27;s razor.&lt;br /&gt;I was curios to see if a \\&quot;man&#x27;s razor would work for a female&#x27;s legs, especially one with this sort of round blade placement. I am happy to report that this does in fact work very well for my needs! A quick once over each day and my legs are good to go!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the basic, no frills, Norelco. It has a smooth, matte finish plastic body and no bells or whistles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tend to think that the quality of the shaving heads is all about the same , more or less.&lt;br /&gt;For that reason this Norelco is a perfect choice for any woman who is wondering if a Norelco might work well on their legs. I should add, perhaps, that I do not have the heaviest or thickest leg hair so YMMV. No. I have not tried on my underarms, and doubt that I will...but you never know.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a perfect &#x27;second&#x27; razor for a man who might like to keep a razor in their car or office too. Basic black goes with everything and it is purported to run 40 minutes on a charge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This razor, and it&#x27;s modest price, is a winner for all of us !</li>
    <li> This razor lasts. I&#x27;ve had a Norelco of this model before and it just stays consistent in its clean shave.  It&#x27;s easy to use.  No chord means I can charge it up and take it with me, if I&#x27;m in a hurry out the door to work.  It is great on vacation.  The charge is quick (about a couple of hours at the most) and lasts quite a few shaves.  It feels good on my face and doesn&#x27;t chafe, yet shaves clean.</li>
    <li> It is a gift for my father. I have not use it , but it looks good!</li>
    <li> I bought it as a gift for my boyfriend. He says that it is easy to use. He likes that it was easy to clean up. He liked it as a gift too.</li>
    <li> I am truly impressed with this razor. Its quiet, cuts very close, and the battery seems to last forever. Great job Norelco</li>
    <li> Originally I bought one of the Power Touch razors (from another retailer) and used it for two weeks. It kept nicking me every time I used it so I returned it on Norelco&#x27;s 45 day guarantee and bought this razor instead. This is a great little razor. It&#x27;s very light weight and quiet. It shaves the way I expect Norelco razors to shave (with no nicks or cuts).</li>
    <li> WONDERFUL RAZOR FOR THE MONEY.  GLAD I HAVE IT.  HOLDS A CHARGE FOR A GOOD LONG TIME</li>
    <li> Wonderful Shaver for the money and the shaver holds its charge for quite awhile;</li>
    <li> Does good job but I was hoping I could use it in the shower.</li>
    <li> SO FAR ITS WHAT I EXPECTED..</li>
    <li> I get a good shave from this razor</li>
    <li> Third Phillips Norelco i&#x27;ve bought. Poor quality, poor performance. My dad had an old Phillips Norelco that he used in the Navy for 20 years. THAT was a real Norelco. These corner-cutting budget units that they&#x27;re churning out are a joke. It only cuts well for about 2 weeks, and it&#x27;s loud.</li>
    <li> Got it because it has &amp;#34;kosher&amp;#34; features, but it does not compare to my other Norelcos in terms of features - for one, there is no charging indicator so the charger frequently dies during shaving</li>
    <li> The hard shell case was fine, but the strap was not included, even though it was supposed to be included.</li>
    <li> It is a really nice shaver for the price.  My husband is loving it.</li>
    <li> Perfect to be used by my grandson who is just starting to shave.</li>
    <li> Works well. I like that I can use it without it being plugged in. Its an upgrade from my old shaver.</li>
    <li> Son in law is very tough on shavers and loves this one!</li>
    <li> Nice unit and holds charge for along time! Very close shave!</li>
    <li> My cheek become so &amp;#34;smooth&amp;#34; after using this.....I can&#x27;t believe it even when I touch my cheek ....lol</li>
    <li> This was a gift for my Father who just loves it.  He has been using Norelco Electric Shavers for years and his next electric shaver will be a Norelco.</li>
    <li> Nice for a. quick shave in a hurry.</li>
    <li> very cheap version for occasional use</li>
    <li> Great shaver for a great price! Left my skin very smooth!</li>
    <li> It literally feels like its pulling the hair out of my face</li>
    <li> Exactly what I expected. Works well.</li>
    <li> Simple -- PIECE OF JUNK ... I mean if you are looking for a shaver that gives a smooth shave anyways because this one doesn&#x27;t. Why it is rated as #1 I&#x27;d have to say is because they spend billions of dollars to tell you it is and they sell it as the cheapest to get a high sales rate and nobody bothers to realize they have spent $25 on a razor that doesn&#x27;t shave. QUIT PUTTING OUT TRASH PRODUCTS CORPORATE AMERICA!</li>
    <li> great shaver does far beyound hopes</li>
    <li> Big talk, little result.&lt;br /&gt;I wouldn&#x27;t try it again.</li>
    <li> This thing couldn&#x27;t be more cheesey and disappointing if they tried. I buy plenty of Philips Norelco razors and I thought I was getting a deal. Instead I got inconvenienced with a return.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Norelco shavers for roughly forty years now.  Unfortunately this is the worst one I&#x27;ve ever purchased.  Oddly the less expensive basic ones have typically been the better ones, not so in this case.  This one is not only cheap but it works cheap too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It gives a poor shave.  Compared to my old Norelco it irritates my face a little (I&#x27;ve *never* had a Norelco irritate my face before).  It seems &amp;#34;slow&amp;#34; in that I have to pass over and over and over again the same region in order to try and get shaved.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Usually a Norelco shaver lasts me about ten years.  I&#x27;m hoping this one doesn&#x27;t and will probably replace it soon.  I&#x27;m so disappointed that I sometimes use my previous Norelco (which I&#x27;ve repaired myself) and my Braun.  Stubbornly I keep trying this one to see if it will get better or I will get used to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would rate it a 2 but gave it an extra star because even at their worst the Norelco shavers seem to be better than other brands.</li>
    <li> I always use the brand of Philips Norelco and all had great experience. Not use this one yet, but have no doubt I will like it still. Package came in nicely.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok. Had a better Norelco previously that lasted years and shaved better. This one is ok for the price.</li>
    <li> Great product as it gives a very smooth shave and the mustache fixture works excellent in grooming my mustache. The battery life is also very good. This product is lightweight and is easy to manouvre on the contours of your face. Ideal for non-shavers like myself,</li>
    <li> This shaver does a great job and is very quiet I love it.</li>
    <li> A reasonably priced (under $50) Norelco shaver. No fancy features, which means good reliability and light weight.</li>
    <li> I use it any time I don&#x27;t use the old fashioned hand razor and shaving cream.  Works just like one that costs more at the local department store.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t get this. It&#x27;s a terrible product.</li>
    <li> I would give five star if it was water-proof at this price.</li>
    <li> It works fine for me!</li>
    <li> Works fine. Smooth shave.</li>
    <li> gift for a disabled veteran who requested this specifically.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 21 and my facial hair is blond. Hell, I could go two weeks and nobody would notice I didn&#x27;t shave. Anyway, needed a new razor and I&#x27;m loving this one. Charge lasts me a rather long time...Probably the lack of facial hair that it needs to cut :/</li>
    <li> Not the fastest shaver but is a good shave.</li>
    <li> I recently received a Philips Norelco Rechargeable Cordless Razor to review for the Vine Program. I had my husband put it to the test since he is the primary razor user in our household. He was very pleased with the shave he got with this razor and said it worked just as well as the more expensive model he has been using. The razor charged quickly and held its charge well. The compact size makes this razor a good choice when traveling.</li>
    <li> The Philips Norelco 6948XL/41 Rechargeable Cordless Razor is one of the lower end models in the Philips line of rechargeable razors. I think the shave is nearly as good as the higher end models, but you don&#x27;t get any bells and whistles. I gave a fancy $130 [[ASIN:B003V32UE2 Philips Norelco 1160X/42 SensoTouch  2D Electric Razor with Jet Clean System]] to my father and he didn&#x27;t like it. He wanted this model!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pro&#x27;s&lt;br /&gt;Inexpensive compared to higher end models&lt;br /&gt;Cuts a day old beard very well.&lt;br /&gt;Cuts a several day old beard well, but not perfect unless you work at it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;No battery life indicator (you can&#x27;t tell how much battery power you have left)&lt;br /&gt;Can&#x27;t shave using water or foam&lt;br /&gt;No charge indicator (you can&#x27;t be sure when it&#x27;s done charging)&lt;br /&gt;Less shaving time then higher end models (that means shorter battery charge time)&lt;br /&gt;Can&#x27;t be cleaned with water, but a brush is provided&lt;br /&gt;No stand, so you have to lay it on its side.&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t have a &#x27;quick&#x27; charge for 1 shave emergencies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all a great value.</li>
    <li> Rotary vs foil!  Battle of the century.  Foil has come a long way but I still think rotary is hard to beat for thicker beards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a good Norelco rotary shaver, just a very basic rechargeable one.  It&#x27;s not water resistant so no using it in the shower and no cleaning it under the faucet.  You&#x27;ll have to clean it the old fashioned way: take the top off, knock the hair particles out and brush it down.  You can rinse the shaver head (once detached) and then just let it dry before putting it back together.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The motor sounds anemic compared to other shavers I&#x27;ve owned but it cuts just as good and runs smooth.  If you just want a low end rechargeable, I think this is a good one.  If you&#x27;ve got the cash to blow, though, think about a waterproof model, which are a lot easier to clean.</li>
    <li> Both my husband and I have tried this, even though it&#x27;s really for men.  My husband has used these in the past and said that this one is lighter and more quiet.  Even though the price seems low, it works really good.  He can use it 3 or 4 times before having to charge it again.  He had been using just a disposable razor for shaving, but he really likes this rechargeable electric shaver and is using it exclusively.  I tried it on my legs, too.  It will do when I need a quick shave, but I think the razor shaves a little bit closer for that purpose.  I really liked how smooth it glided over my legs with 5 day old stubble.</li>
    <li> I purchased this shaver in October. It shaved fairly well initially, but now fails to hold a charge for proper operating speed and a good shave. No matter how often and long I charge it, it slows down badly. Unfortunately, I threw away the packing material as my previous Norelco shavers had been durable, so return is not possible. One of only 2 Amazon purchases of the many I&#x27;ve made which didn&#x27;t work out well, though I can&#x27;t hold Amazon responsible.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for almost 1 year without any problems. It&#x27;s easy to clean and maintain. It works regardless of whether you use it in the US (110V) or most other countries (240V).</li>
    <li> Works great and love it! It provides a close clean shave. It is smooth without pulling hairs. I had bought another brand name at a higher price and had returned it, but happy with Philips Norelco.</li>
    <li> I had an issue with it, but Philips Norelco has AMAZING customer service.</li>
    <li> I got it, turned it on and did not work. I tried to charge it and it didn&#x27;t work. Amazon refused a return.</li>
    <li> Works very good I like it, but I&#x27;m going to upgrade,good buy</li>
    <li> After receiving this razor I charged it for 8 hours.  When I tried to use the razor it would not turn fast enough to shave.  I assume a defective item as the light was on showing it was charging but it apparently didn&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> Poor. You will get many missed and many ingrown hairs from this shaver..</li>
    <li> This thing is great and a great price.</li>
    <li> not as smooth as previous Norelco but lowest cost</li>
    <li> It did not cut close enough and I ended giving it away.</li>
    <li> The packaging on this Philips Norelco razor is ridiculous. I&#x27;ve never has so much trouble opening a product before. I needed a sharp knife and pliers to open, and almost cut off a finger in the process. I understand that it&#x27;s so impossibly difficult to open to deter theft, but one would think that the packaging contained the Royal family jewels or the Hope diamond.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The razor seems fine, but if it&#x27;s a gift make sure you include a blow torch or machete so the recipient can open the package.</li>
    <li> Amazing product really worth it&#x27;s money</li>
    <li> first time used, left razor burns and cuts all over my neck.</li>
    <li> It seems very cheaply made and really don&#x27;t shave close at all ! Im going back to a razor !!</li>
    <li> Seems to work well but then all Philips Norelco shavers do. Had them for years and never has one failed.</li>
    <li> My son has problems with razors as they cause him to break out, this solved that issue.</li>
    <li> For a basic shaver with a good pop-up trimmer, this one fits the bill perfectly.  My last Norelco was almost identical to this, but the battery wouldn&#x27;t stay charged for more than about 3 days any more. So I bought this one, which fits my hand perfectly and is lightweight.  And I can now go about 8 or 9 days between charges. Awesome.</li>
    <li> great product, great service</li>
    <li> This razor provides a very close shave!  I&#x27;ve had it quite a while now and have yet to recharge it (after the initial charge) so I&#x27;m very happy the charge lasts.</li>
    <li> I brought this for my Grandpa. It got dull very quickly and his nurse plain out told me it &amp;#34;sucks&amp;#34;  I am very upset I waisted $30 on this product since it was a gift. I&#x27;m really angry about this and I hope no one else feels the need to waste their time on this product.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping and just what I expected.  Thanks....</li>
    <li> Terrible!! This was a gift for my father in law and it broke after 3 months. Was used about 3-4 times a week. Difficult to put together after taking apart for a cleaning. Resorted to calling Phillips Customer service it was as though the operator read out of the manual. She kept insisting to look for the arrow on the grey piece, there was no arrow.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a backup to the higher end razor I usually use and to be used when travelling. Having said that, it is a great razor. The results are not very far off from my more expensive razor and it was MUCH less expensive. I highly recommend.&lt;br /&gt;The battery lasts a very long time. I charged it before the first use and have not charged it since. I figure that I have shaved at least 20 times since the first charge.</li>
    <li> My husband uses this and it works great.  I noticed that some other people had trouble cleaning it, but I don&#x27;t see how that is so as my husband doesn&#x27;t have any problem with that from the product we received.</li>
    <li> This shaver didn&#x27;t last 2 months without problems with the razor heads.  I serviced it as directed, and it now is to the point where the shave is so bad that I&#x27;ll need to replace it, at about 4 months old.</li>
    <li> I have used Norelco shavers since the early 1970&#x27;s and this one does a better job than any I have had in the past.  It is not very fancy but it does a good job of cutting.  I believe that it is a good value.</li>
    <li> I have a lite beard but this shaver knocks it down fast. I&#x27;v shaved four times on the first charge and I bet i&#x27;ll get two or more before a recharge!</li>
    <li> I, just received my Philips norelco 6948XL/41 shaver. Works excellent,great price,very pleased!!!!!  Excellent service!  Shipped on time!  Thank-You!!!!!</li>
    <li> Close shave&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Doesn’t conform to facial features as well as the ones with the wobbly head but does give a good close shave. Money well spent. Will buy another and recommend to friends.</li>
    <li> Had to work very hard to remove beard stubble. Did a lousy job and took too much time.  Good old razor blade provides better shave and much faster</li>
    <li> Perfect gave away for a gift.  He loves it.</li>
    <li> Got two of them for the price of one with the coupon Amazon gave me. Very well made. Works very well.</li>
    <li> Good razor but I have only used one other. It gives me a smooth shave, no nicks or scratching. I recommend it to others.</li>
    <li> Wonderful product , very fast shipping. Was a great gift idea</li>
    <li> This works well for a low-priced shaver.</li>
    <li> the perfect father&#x27;s day gift~  Dad was so happy :)</li>
    <li> Great product, great price.</li>
    <li> Very much good price.</li>
    <li> was for a gift so cant leave a good review for it at this time other then that item shipped fast and was very good price..</li>
    <li> I am a chick. I use this razor for my legs and it works 10x better than any razor made for women. So take note ladies. I would recommend this to anybody girl or guy. Good quality for the price for sure. Very happy!</li>
    <li> Yes indeed it was very nice.</li>
    <li> Competitively priced.</li>
    <li> Its very good. Thanks.</li>
    <li> What a deal. God bless Amazon.</li>
    <li> It was a gift, so I have no idea how it works on my face. It seems to work well based on what I&#x27;ve heard.</li>
    <li> yup, it does the job!!  no more last minute trips to the drugstore for plastic razors on shorts-wearing days!</li>
    <li> I only had minor irritation from switching to this razor, only after the first shave, then nothing. The head really conforms to your face, I&#x27;ve never used one like this before and I&#x27;m glad I decided to experiment. I can&#x27;t get as close a shave as I could with disposables razors, but I don&#x27;t really need to, and besides that I couldn&#x27;t use disposable razors while relaxing &amp; watching YouTube, but I can with this razor! It comes with a little brush, but I seem to get most particles out just by blowing, maybe over time I&#x27;ll need to use the brush once in a while.</li>
    <li> The user guide says that after 20 sessions your skin become normal, but i think i have more than that and my skin still red</li>
    <li> Not a super smooth shave but did not pull hair. I would recommend to friends.</li>
    <li> It works well but it&#x27;s not the smoothest feel in shavers I&#x27;ve ever had. Still, quite good for the money.</li>
    <li> Arrived in display packaging.  Not very powerful.</li>
    <li> Was in a quandary regarding all the choices, all the bells and whistles.  So I read the customer reviews to see what they said about the quality of the shave..  The collective wisdom lead to a sound choice at an inexpensive price.  If price is no object, go right for the big guns.  But not necessary.</li>
    <li> This was a gift for my son. He likes the Norelco electric shavers the best. He&#x27;s been using them for years.</li>
    <li> I use this as my travel razor.  I&#x27;m on the road more than a 3rd of the year so I needed something durable (has to endure air travel), simple (not a lot of parts), and does a good job in a hurry (who isn&#x27;t running late when they travel?).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to tell you -- this razor delivers on all fronts.  In the past, I&#x27;ve not found an electric razor that came anywhere near as close a shave as a razor blade.  But this razor hugs the curves of my neck and face and really gives me an incredibly close shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve now bought a 2nd one -- to use at home!  I highly recommend this razor.</li>
    <li> Cheap casing, but does the job for the $$$</li>
    <li> Works great. Not as many &amp;#34;bells and whistles&amp;#34; as other models but is exactly all I need.  Fast shipping.</li>
    <li> My husband hasn&#x27;t tried an electric shaver for years.  They never cut close enough and the razor burn was awful.  He was pleasantly surprised with this Norelco - especially with the low price point.  Overall, the razor gave a nice close shave - not like a blade but respectable.  He gave it a try for about three weeks.  The irritation was minimal but he still needed to use some aftershave lotion for comfort.  He plans to keep it around for touchups during the day but he still isn&#x27;t willing to give up the blade.  Especially since he sometimes wears a goatee and needs to keep hard lines around his nose.</li>
    <li> This Norelco replaced my previous Norelco - that I used for 45 years, only having to replace the blades twice!</li>
    <li> My husband loves this. Very close even shave.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s okay and is good for the price, but this is not the best shave by any means.</li>
    <li> my man likes this shaver since he does not need to manually cut away his hair with a razor.</li>
    <li> Good product and quick delivery.</li>
    <li> I love it, quick clean shave price was right also !!</li>
    <li> I had one of these years ago.  This one seems cheaper, lighter and like the battery doesn&#x27;t want to hold a charge so I am thinking a 3 star rating but you know what - it gets the job done so I will give 4.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s nice to get back to a nice basic razor that does the intended job with no bells and whistles to go wrong.  It&#x27;s simple to charge and to clean and gives me a decent shave.</li>
    <li> Bougth it for a friend and now im getting it for me</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s okay, but it only really works if there is basically no hair. if it gets long enough for you to really feel it the razor takes forever to cut it. it can&#x27;t cut hair, takes some time to get stubble down from a few days. if you shave everyday it would be good i guess b/c the hair wouldn&#x27;t get long enough, otherwise i&#x27;d suggest one that can handle a longer and harder shave. other than that, this product does work and do it&#x27;s job, its uses are just limited.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used and bought razors similar to this one, but those that were about 5 times the price.  Sure, they have the \\&quot;self-cleaning\\&quot; stuff, which is sort of worthless in my opinion.  This thing is easy to use, holds a charge really well, and does the job well.  What else do you want?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I&#x27;ve noticed, as a general rule, between electric razors that are more expensive and cheaper, like this one, is that the more expensive ones seem to be the higher maintenance ones.  The cheaper ones, like this one, don&#x27;t have to be maintained as much.  Therefore, if you are the type of individual who doesn&#x27;t want to or can&#x27;t take proper care of a razor (but only expects it to work for a year or two as well), then get this model or something similar to it.</li>
    <li> This razor meets the basic requirements.  The battery life so far has been good - at least a week.  It shaves close enough but not a close as a wet shave with a standard razor.</li>
    <li> Arrived on time and in great condition. I hope my boyfriend likes it...our roommate has a similar one and my boyfriend has been mentioning that he wanted one, so I don&#x27;t know how well it works yet, but I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;ll be great!</li>
    <li> The razor does not hold a charge like the one I  Had before this one.I should have bought the next one up.</li>
    <li> Ok I&#x27;ll admit I purchased this to shave my legs. It works ok. But doesn&#x27;t offer a smooth finish. I purchased a tri-foil years ago that delivered a smooth finish. This doesn&#x27;t fit the bill.</li>
    <li> No issues at all.  I get one every 18 months or so.  Much cheaper than buying an expensive one with yearly blade replacements, and it works just fine.</li>
    <li> This happens to be one of the best buys I have ever made. The price was a fraction of what I would have paid in any store. You have to trust the brand name. It has been around for many years. It works on me really well and I would recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> This is my second or third Norelco shaver and they have all served me well in the past.  I like to shave with a blade every once in a while with warm water, shaving cream and a 5 blade razor.  It is always a nice experience but who has time?  During the week, when I am in a hurry - I love to use my Philips Norelco shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Philips Norelco shavers are great because you can keep one in the car and shave while you drive.  For some reason, cell phones are illegal in many states but as far as I know, shaving while you drive is completely legit.  I see women applying mascara and eye liner while driving to work so a man shaving his face should be fine.  If you keep one in the car, it is great for the days when you just forget to shave because as they say &amp;#34;It isn&#x27;t difficult to remember but it is easy to forget&amp;#34;.  Always use great caution when shaving while you drive and try to avoid the women applying mascara and eye liner.  It must be dangerous to to have brushes and pencils close the eye.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shaving with the Philips Norelco is quick and easy.  For a daily maintenance shave, it takes about 2 min.  A quick shave before bed makes the morning shave even easier.  My wife also appreciates a smooth face at night in the event of an smooching because it makes my face less scratchy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Philips Norelco 6948XL/41 feels a little cheaper than previous models but it appears to shave just as well.</li>
    <li> Works great, only one problem with my order...IT WAS MISSING THE POWER CORD. Don&#x27;t know if it was supposed to be separate, but i had to buy a charging cord separately.</li>
    <li> So far it is working satisfactorily</li>
    <li> Great shaver for little $ great  battery life , pop up clipper and so super close without razor bumps not lift and cut quality but a step down but way better than panasonic or most Remington products.</li>
    <li> my husband loves this razor, says it is by far the best one he has had, hes had a lot of them lol.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a girl and I bought this because I can&#x27;t use normal razors to shave with. I get razor burn, nicks, chunks of skin missing, ingrown hairs that get infected.. I have since I started shaving.  This has been amazing! None of the above issues happen and my legs are super smooth</li>
    <li> Dont like angle of the trimmer to razor hold</li>
    <li> IT DOES WHAT I EXPECTED HAVING HAD A NORELCO SHAVER IN THE PAST.  IT IS QUIET, SHAVES CLOSELY, WORKS SMOOTHLY AND IS COMFORTABLE ON MY FACE.</li>
    <li> I got this for a gift for my dad, even though he said it doesn&#x27;t give a close shave like the old fashion way, he said he like it , so I&#x27;m happy!</li>
    <li> It  was just what my husband wanted.  Thanks.</li>
    <li> For the money it&#x27;s hard to beat.  It shaves as close as many of the other much more expensive ones I&#x27;ve tried.  The power though seems a bit weak in that the blades don&#x27;t sound like they are spinning as fast as my previous one (which is a very similar Norelco to this one but water proof)  I could still use that one, but simply bought this one instead of buying new blades for my older one.  I do like this one better than my other cheapy Norelco when shaving under my nose... this one does not have an issue with a few of the hairs that my other one does.</li>
    <li> good all purpose shaver.  Affordable.</li>
    <li> I bought this because it was cheaper than buying a replacement head.</li>
    <li> Fast delivery and what can I say about Philip Shaver.... The best there is.</li>
    <li> Perfect shave first time. After years and years of a Norelco I tried a Remington twice the price of this shaver that didn&#x27;t quite make the grade. This one felt light and insubstantial compared to my  old Norelco and turned on it seemed not  as fast or powerful as that old one and not even close to the speed and power of the Remington. I thought &amp;#34;Uh oh!&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;But! First shave was absolutely perfect. Quick, close, quiet, one-and-done. I paid twice as much for something else and wasn&#x27;t satisfied with the shave or with the expensive recommended maintenance. When the heads dull on this one I&#x27;ll just buy another.</li>
    <li> All three were well packaged and will make excellent gifts to the Veterans we are supporting this Holiday season.</li>
    <li> disappointed --- no manual, came in a plastic bag.  Used?</li>
    <li> Its neat,quick and easy to use.Takes about a week to get adjusted to the shaver.Will definitely recommend it to a friend.</li>
    <li> Good, if could  wash in water, so much the better.</li>
    <li> My last Phillips Norelco lasted for a few years and I was very happy with it. Now I have the 6948XL/41 and I love it. It comes with sideburn trimmer and cleaning brushes and an excellent shave.</li>
    <li> Heads spin slow but cut very well.</li>
    <li> The pop up trimmer works only 10% of the time. Bad product.</li>
    <li> For the money, this is the best darn shaver I ever used! Amazing!</li>
    <li> This Norelco shaver is value priced without sacrificing performance. It is a cordless, rechargeable shaver that also features a full size pop-up trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Upon opening, I charged the shaver for 8 hours. It was somewhat charged upon arrival, I assume for quality control to make sure the battery and charging cord and interface are all functional. After a full charge, I had my son, who has a heavy beard, shave his face with it. He was favorably impressed. The shaver is remarkably quiet and does a very good job. He got a close and comfortable shave. The three floating heads pivot independently so it easily shaves contoured areas like the chin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pop-up trimmer works well, also, and cleaned up my son&#x27;s sideburn area really nicely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This shaver cannot be rinsed out with water. Instead, you pop open the head and use the supplied brush to clean out under the heads. We are used to being able to clean our electric razors with water so with that in mind, this razor is probably best used as a travel razor because of it&#x27;s compact nature. It might also be a nice gift for a young man who has just started shaving because it&#x27;s very comfortable to use at a great price.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve found that this razor catches areas of my face and neck that other electric razors don&#x27;t. This is especially useful if one is thin and has angles and hollows to deal with. There&#x27;s nothing like running a razor over your face, over the same spot again and again, and not getting the job done. This razor catches those spots. I recommend this razor for the closeness of its shave, and for its self-sharpening feature.</li>
    <li> This is a great shaver at a very nice price.  I&#x27;d never used a Norelco before and wasn&#x27;t quite sure what to expect.  But after using it for a couple months, I recommend it.</li>
    <li> good buy....works fine.</li>
    <li> Seeing that razors just keep getting more and more expensive, $100, $200, $300 . . . it is nice to see that there are still options that are reasonably priced and the product actually works.  It sounds as you are operating the razor that the motor is running slow but it shaved well.  We tried to drain the battery to recharge it, see if that helped -- like maybe the slow-running motor was an indicator of a dying battery -- and we let the razor run for over three hours and the battery just would not die!  The main detractor for us was that you can&#x27;t rinse the razor but otherwise, overall, this is a decent razor.  If you have a super thick beard this razor might not work so well but wasn&#x27;t able to compare.  This would be a great addition for a travel kit or as a gift for a first time shaver who doesn&#x27;t need to shave every day or have thick/heavy facial hair to cut through.</li>
    <li> Love this Razor.  Got it for my husband and it has been leaving his face baby butt smooth.  It doesn&#x27;t cause irritation to his sensitive skin either.</li>
    <li> Works fine for the price - but you do get what you pay for - the more expensive models seem to be more substantial shavers and last longer on a charge.</li>
    <li> Great shaver at a great price.</li>
    <li> Not a very good shaver,not what i expected</li>
    <li> This is not the best Norelco razor I&#x27;ve owned, especially in terms of features.  For example, I&#x27;ve owned one that was also rechargeable, but you could wash the blades off under the spigot.  Having said that, that razor (7310xl) sells for more than twice the price of this model based on what I see today on Amazon.  In fact, this razor doesn&#x27;t cost much more than a set of replacement blades for a lot of razors.  And, given that it can be used corded or charged, I think it&#x27;s a really good value.  It shaves as well as the more expensive model I&#x27;ve had.  So, unless the blades wear out faster than I expect, I rate this as a good razor and a very good value.  I think that it actually spins the blades faster than other rechargeables I&#x27;ve used.  Brushes out easily enough and has a sideburn trimmer.</li>
    <li> This is an entry-level razor that shaves well, is light, quiet, and easy to use. I&#x27;ve been using Norelco for decades and this one is complimenting my 5825XL that I&#x27;ve had for about 15 years. This razor (the 6948) feels a bit cheap; both light and plasticy, compared to my old razor. It is more round and less contoured, so the fit in the hand isn&#x27;t as natural. It isn&#x27;t a big deal, but don&#x27;t expect this to feel as nice as higher end Norelcos. This isn&#x27;t \\&quot;Father&#x27;s day\\&quot; or \\&quot;graduation gift\\&quot; quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are two issues I have with Norelco: One is the batteries. On my unit I&#x27;ve had to replace the rechargeable battery (NiCAD) at least three times using a soldering iron and replacement batteries from Radio Shack. The battery on this model is a better one (Nickel Metal Hydride, or NiMH) and I hope it lasts. But the instructions are very clear that you cannot use it only corded and you shouldn&#x27;t drain it all the way often and you shouldn&#x27;t charge for more than 8 hours (or less than 8 hours). So this appears to still be a bit finicky. I don&#x27;t want to remember about my razor; can&#x27;t the electronics monitor things and just turn it off or use the battery when it needs to be used? Do I have to remember to plug it in at night and unplug in the morning?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other thing that bugs me is their recommendation to change the blades every year. I certainly go two or three years without replacing blades and I&#x27;ve had very few problems. If I go too long the blades do begin to cause skin irriation, but the once a year is a very conservative estimate. Perhaps I have a lighter beard than most.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you search for Norelco razors you&#x27;ll see that their main line up consists of the 6945, PT720, PT730, AT810, and AT830. The 6948 (the razor being reviewed) is not very prominent. Go to the [[ASIN:B006GQYSDC Amazon listing for the 6945 ]]and scroll to the bottom for a comparison of Norelco razors and you won&#x27;t find the 6948.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The 6945 has a Lithium Ion battery but doesn&#x27;t have a pop-up trimmer.  It is my understanding that the Li-Ion battery is the more advanced technology and less likely to memory and other issues. However a trimmer is also important, so both of these razors are a bit of a compromise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Despite it being double the price, I think the [[ASIN:B006GQYSGO PT730]] is worth a strong consideration for the following reasons:&lt;br /&gt;- The shaving head quality is two levels above that of the 6945/8. The PT730 blade is \\&quot;duel precision cut\\&quot; and the \\&quot;Super Lift &amp; Cut System\\&quot;. I know these are mostly marketing terms, but there does appear to be real physical changes to the blade and it is nice to know you have the one used on the higher end devices.&lt;br /&gt;- It has a trimmer and the Li-Ion battery (no compromise)&lt;br /&gt;- The blade is easier to clean as you can run water through it.&lt;br /&gt;- The quick charge feature is nice; if your razor is dead and you shave on the go, you can charge it for 3-minutes and get one shave out of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only downside is price, but it may not be that drastic a difference in the long run. Although the Amazon listing for the PT730 says to change the heads every year , the instructions at Phlips-Norelco site say \\&quot;New! 24 months\\&quot; for a change for the PT7XX series (and one year for the 69XX series). If you go by this, the razors will cost about the same over a two year period since the replacement heads cost about the same as the difference in cost for the razors. (The [[ASIN:B000068PBT replacement blades for the PT730]] are only five dollars more than [[ASIN:B004URZADG for the 69XX series]].)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In summary, this is a very good simple razor at an excellent price and is a very good value. You might wish to check out a higher end model if this is your primary razor and plan to have it for several years.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using a similar Norelco for decades and it finally started losing power (battery) and was pulling (probably dull...original heads).&lt;br /&gt;This new one is great. About $35 and I can shave about as quick as it takes to brush my teeth.  I should have replaced to old one sooner.</li>
    <li> I like that its rechargeable. I am thinking about buying another one for my son. Great gift for any man.</li>
    <li> The pricing for electric razors has always puzzled me - some are dirt cheap, like this one, while others are well over $100. I guess I have a simple face with simple needs because this razor does the job just fine. It holds a charge, gives a close shave without the time and hassle of a razor and shaving cream, and it is affordably priced.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At this price point, however, it of course lacks the features of some other more expensive models: No wet use (can&#x27;t use in the shower); no charging stand; and you can&#x27;t rinse it off under the water faucet to clean it. But, you can always pay a bit more for a higher model if you need those things.  I don&#x27;t shave in the shower and I just unplug it and move it off the sink when it&#x27;s charged and I am good to go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, at this price point, it is a great gift idea for family members, office/work occasions, or to stash one away at work if you forget to shave at home or are running late.</li>
    <li> So far battery life has been great--I haven&#x27;t charged it in two weeks.</li>
    <li> GOOD VALUE FOR THE PRICE</li>
    <li> Works great for daily shaving of a man&#x27;s head. No more do I worry about nicking or slicing my scalp during my groggy morning rush. Doesn&#x27;t cut as close as a straight razor, but it&#x27;s as close as it gets. The closeness of this electric razor is probably what my head feels like an hour or two after shaving with a straight razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For an important occasion I might still use a straight razor, but for work and day-to-day use, I&#x27;ll never go back to a razor!</li>
    <li> GOOD TRANSACTION, NO PROBLEMS</li>
    <li> does what it is supposed to do for the price</li>
    <li> Arrived very quickly and works great!  Husband very pleased with it &amp; pricing was great too!</li>
    <li> If its knocked off a counter onto a tile floor it becomes a million pieces :(</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s very good and I like it.</li>
    <li> This is an entry level shaver and it feels more like a toy.  I was replacing a 12 year old Braun that needs a new battery.  It is like going from a V8 to a 4 cylinder.  This Norelco doesn&#x27;t have enough power.  Returned.  I broke my own rule, \\&quot;Don&#x27;t be afraid to pay for quality if you need to use it every day\\&quot;.</li>
    <li> Works very well, quiet and cuts close.</li>
    <li> I got this for Christmas for $25 on sale! I can&#x27;t complain about it! Sure beats shaving with cream and a razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend it!</li>
    <li> Purchased for my dad who said that the packaging was terrible to open.  Amazon should make this a frustration free item.  Cheaper than buying a new shaver head for an older shaver.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my son who is just getting to the age where he has to shave regularly.  He is very pleased with this shaver.  It is quick and easy for him to shave before school; much better than the shaving cream and razor.</li>
    <li> it works well and keeps charge(power) for a lot longer than usual.cuts clean enough.design is very nice.one thing you have to take into buying anything now/and i mean anything!if it is not made over seas it will have parts from overseas!i dont thik this razor will last very long/like all overseas products.but if money is a priority and your trying to get the best for a dollar-this is a good one.</li>
    <li> Good product, good price, fast delivery!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only owned this six days, so I&#x27;ll wait a few months before posting a complete review, but after reading the users manual for this shaver, I need to post a warning.  I would not have bought it if I had read the owners manual first.  The only reason I&#x27;m not returning it is that I don&#x27;t have time now to research alternatives.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My big concern about buying it was that it&#x27;s been so hard to replace the battery in past Norelco&#x27;s.  After I&#x27;d been using it for two days I read the user manual, hoping that I&#x27;d find that Norelco had begun using a more easily replaceable battery.  Instead, I found just the opposite:  Norelco says that when the battery can no longer recharge, the owner should discard the battery properly and then THROW AWAY THE SHAVER!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The manual (page 19) says &amp;#34;Do not attempt to replace the battery ... Discard your razor .. Do not attempt to plug the power cord into the outlet ... after the battery has been removed.&amp;#34;  There&#x27;s no mention of taking it to a repair facility to replace the battery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This not only is environmentally and fiscally terrible practice, it means that Norelco probably has not designed this shaver to last much beyond the 30 month warranty.  (the standard two year warranty is extended six months if you register online).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the positive side, it shaves better than I expected.  I&#x27;ve been using a Gillette Fusion Proglide and only switched to the Norelco to save water during the California drought. It doesn&#x27;t shave as well as a manual, but it comes close.  Also positive: I&#x27;ve shaved six times and haven&#x27;t had to recharge the battery yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll write a more complete review after I&#x27;ve owned it longer.</li>
    <li> Great buy for the money</li>
    <li> price is reasonable and it is good at close shave</li>
    <li> It Is Of Poor Quality, Nothing Like My old Norelco That I Boudgt It To Replace,</li>
    <li> Heck of a lot better than my much more expensive one for which I changed blades and still gave me a rotten shave.&lt;br /&gt;If it doesn&#x27;t work well after one year, I can toss it and buy another. So far no problems.</li>
    <li> When it comes to shavers- I&#x27;ve tested quite a few, and generally people in my family prefer screen type shavers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of the very first things I check for is how it does on fine hair. A lot of men&#x27;s shavers, even expensive models, don&#x27;t do well on fine hair at all. It just folds under the head. This one cleaned the section of my arm I tried it on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Next test is having my husband try it on his medium coarse facial hair. It shaved it very close. Not blade close, and not as close as the screen type expensive shaver he uses regularly, but definitely well enough. The trimmer works easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d recommend it as a starter electric razor, to help someone learn how to care for and clean one regularly and to start shaving. Because it does handle finer hair, it&#x27;s also a good choice for legs. It will require more frequent cleaning if used on finer hair.</li>
    <li> pretty good razor.......... but i like a couple of razors i bot at B&amp;M discount store (BCF) better. those were $9.99........ of course, a year from now the norelco may still be working while the vivitar (name?) $9.99 models may dead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i would also note that i like the discount razors better because i think they shave closer BUT ALSO that you can hear the cutting. with the norelco you can&#x27;t hear the cutting but i also think the other razors cut closer, especially on side face/neck hair which is more like normal hair with no tough stubble</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband and he loves it.</li>
    <li> Quick service and the shave is great!</li>
    <li> Perfect for my son&#x27;s first shaver</li>
    <li> Good gift for a young man growing up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;this is just a filler statement to make up the extra words needed in order to submit the rating.</li>
    <li> for the price it pretty darn good. I am left a little stubbly but not to bad. Again for the price it is great.</li>
    <li> ★★★★★ Five stars -- It was a pleasure dealing with you -- Thank you!! A+++++++++</li>
    <li> I charged it once and 2 months later it is still going. Easy cleaning, close shaves. What more could you ask for?</li>
    <li> This shaver does a good job.</li>
    <li> Got it for dad for father&#x27;s day and he likes it.</li>
    <li> The shaver does everything I expected it to do and does it fast.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s so much quieter than my previous Norelco I thought it would drag and pull hair. But it is as good as my 7 year old one so I am happy; and the price is right.</li>
    <li> Got this in yesterday and Don used it. It did a very good job shaving him.</li>
    <li> Rechargeable battery operation. Charger cord included. Quiet. Gives an acceptable shave, not as good as a Gillette fusion, but a lot quicker and easier. I bought it because I&#x27;m getting lazy, and don&#x27;t want to go through all that wet shave mess, but I don&#x27;t like to look like a bum either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had one of these maybe 40 years ago that was a plug in and sounded like a vacuum cleaner, and periodically nipped a row of flesh along with the whiskers. This one is MUCH better.</li>
    <li> Great for the price-the trimmer feature is the best part. Does a good job for a daily shaver-no more stubble on the husband who hates to shave :)</li>
    <li> looks good. a gift to young brother.</li>
    <li> Bit of a rough shave.  You&#x27;ll get a better shave by spending more for a higher dollar model.</li>
    <li> The razor arrived as promised, and is performing very well, with more shaving per charge than any I&#x27;ve had before.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my brother for christmas and he says he loves it.</li>
    <li> I dont even seems to be norelco. Very very basic. i thought norelco had a minimum quality standard....now I have changed my mind</li>
    <li> It was upto my expectations.  Easy to use,  handy to carry when you travel. Excellent one to love it everyday</li>
    <li> Outstanding razor.  Much better than I expected.Easy to use.Gives fast shave.Easy to clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this shaver to anyone.</li>
    <li> Offers a very nice shave for an affordable price. It looks a little cheap, but does a great job. It has the same performance as my other, much more expensive, cordless razor.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t be used with water, irritate my face skin every time i use it, lost money. Next time, i will buy Braun</li>
    <li> So far, does everything as expected.  Would recommend to a friend...</li>
    <li> Do not misunderstand the three star rating.  This very inexpensive Norelco shaver does the job.  I am assuming that, because of its low price, the motor inside doesn&#x27;t spin quite as fast or as strong as the other much-higher-priced Norelco shavers I have owned in the past.  Bottom Line: It gets the job done.</li>
    <li> Norelco productshave been my mainstay for shaving for many years. This razor performs the best of any I&#x27;ve purchased from them in the past. The battery lasts much longer than previously purchased more expensive razors. A very good value and an excellent product.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t always like shaving my legs in the shower... and most ladies&#x27; electric razors suck.&lt;br /&gt;I used to appropriate my husband&#x27;s razor, experimenting on whether or not it did a good job on my legs. I was satisfied, and finally decided to buy one of these for myself.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t care about being able to wash it in water. (You can&#x27;t. Only dry brushing it clean.)&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t care about it not having a stand. (I put it in the bathroom cupboard anyway.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, for me, this is a neat and low priced little electric razor.&lt;br /&gt;I may even consider giving this as a gift to a couple of my friends.</li>
    <li> This does a great job -- nice, close shave. Great for the price. I don&#x27;t understand why people would spend a ton more money.</li>
    <li> Great service from Amazon&lt;br /&gt;Amazingly smooth shave at a very good price.&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend this to anyone looking for a new shaver</li>
    <li> Had a great Braun foil shaver for the last decade, which was great, but it finally began shorting out, and going to work with half my face shaved was not an option.  I did a consumer search and settled on this triple rotor Norelco.  It does not shave as close as the Braun, but it&#x27;s a comfortable shave that covers my face evenly.  The Braun motor buzzed along at a noisy 90MPH, but it often irritated my skin.  The Norelco has a less powerful motor, but it&#x27;s quiet and shaves smoothly, though it takes almost twice as long to get the job done.  This budget model is a good buy for the price.  I like that it operates both corded or cordless.  It works for me, but if you want the best electric shave possible, you&#x27;ll need to step up in price.</li>
    <li> I bought it for my husband. He is truck driver and it&#x27;s not easy to shave with regular razors, when you drive all day.He likes it so far:))</li>
    <li> Update: This shaver got very dull very fast. If I have to replace the blades every 3 months, it ends up being a very expensive shaver with minimal functionality. Probably better off paying a bit more for something else.  After trying all sorts of fancy electric shavers for years and having complaints about this or that aspect, I thought, why don&#x27;t I just get the cheapest one I can find? So I got this one and I&#x27;m really glad I did!  It works, what else do you need? Shaves just as well as models 3x more expensive, and it&#x27;s not any rougher on my skin. So what if it doesn&#x27;t have a battery meter and you can&#x27;t take it into the shower? I just want to shave and be done it with. Plus, at $29, if it doesn&#x27;t end up lasting years and year, hey, not the end of the world, I can get another one.</li>
    <li> Unlike other Norelco more sophisticated models, and for my skin type, this razor works perfectly with a long battery life between charges, providing smooth and pleasant results.</li>
    <li> My husband loves it.  Especially the cordless feature.  His old one (of a different brand) wouldn&#x27;t hold a charge.  Thanks!</li>
    <li> My husband loves it so much he shaves everyday LOL</li>
    <li> Does what I need it to.  nothing fancy, and I don&#x27;t get a super close shave with it, but it works for traveling and when I need a quick clean up.</li>
    <li> Nice shaver..charge also lasted 4 days before recharge.</li>
    <li> Decent shaver, got it for my son.  No frills, gives a decent shave.  Good for the price.</li>
    <li> nice rig. battery could last a little longer but definitely does the job well</li>
    <li> Bought this for times when in a hurry or, just plain lazy.  Good performance for a next day shave.  Less so for heavier beard than that.</li>
    <li> Great shaver, not as close a shave as my previous Norelco but much better price</li>
    <li> Operates very quietly, does not wake the wife.  Close shave and the on/off switch is large and easy to use.  It&#x27;s been almost two weeks without recharging and still going strong.</li>
    <li> It is of great use and convenient because it is rechargeable, I could not need to buy batteries. I would recommend to my friends.</li>
    <li> Even with a full charge it runs too slow for my wants.  And it is so lite I doubt it will last very long.</li>
    <li> my husband says he loves it</li>
    <li> I like it .It‘s very good</li>
    <li> best shaver for the price</li>
    <li> Fantastic razor! A truly great electric razor for the price. 5+ stars!</li>
    <li> A good shaver for the price. If you have a heavy beard growth you may need a better shaver.</li>
    <li> this Norelco Rechargeable razor was a gift for my husband.  It is exactly what he wanted.  It replaced his old razor.&lt;br /&gt; He has trouble with his hands(things that come with age) so this razor is exactly the right size for him and he is very&lt;br /&gt; pleased and happy with this razor.</li>
    <li> A very good shaver at a reasonable price.  I am well satisfied with it.</li>
    <li> I was a long time user of another brand of electric shaver that was reasonably priced, but now very expensive. So I decided to give this Philips Norelco a try. I&#x27;m glad I did because it is giving me the best shave I&#x27;ve ever had with an electric shaver.</li>
    <li> Economical verion of a classic.</li>
    <li> I have had plenty of Norelco Shavers before, this inexpensive shaver is great for travel or just around the house.</li>
    <li> Very close, smooth shave.  Battery life seems longer than described.  I would buy this one again, and maybe even as a present!</li>
    <li> I bought this product at my local Wal-Mart and I must say that it is the best electric razor I have seen and for the price, who wouldn&#x27;t want this product? It&#x27;ll save you a lot of money in using normal razors to shave. The only downside I can think of is that it takes some time to clean the hair out of the inside of the blades and you can&#x27;t use water to do it, because, then, the razor&#x27;s dead. The included brush that comes with the razor doesn&#x27;t do much help with it, so you literally have to take it apart and pat it out until you don&#x27;t see any visible hairs in the deposit or in the razor blade&#x27;s sink.</li>
    <li> This Razor works very well, especially considering the price is currently around $20.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shave it delivers is relatively close. Not as close as shaving with a non-electric razor but definitely close enough for any setting. You may have to pass the razor over a spot a few times but even with that, it still takes only a few moments to shave using this razor. It is much, much quicker than using a conventional razor, and does not require (OR WORK WITH) shaving cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As others have noted, the razor ships with medium quality blades on it. The replacement blades (Philips Norelco HQ56) are supposed to be much better, so I&#x27;m looking forward to replacing the heads once they wear out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m definitely happy with the purchase. For $20, plus replacing the blades only once a year, this is a much cheaper shave than Gillete, Schick, etc. razors.</li>
    <li> It does what it says it will do! Very easy to use and clean. Light weight and easy to store.</li>
    <li> husband happy with his</li>
    <li> Bought it for my brother and dad.  They borh like it.  It shaves skin closely</li>
    <li> My husband stated that he has not had a close shave in a long time.</li>
    <li> Very close and smooth shave.</li>
    <li> I have a long history with Norelco razors, having bought them for my husband for 20 years.  So when my son needed a razor, I purchased this Norelco for him.  It is the same one that my husband had used before without problem.  However, it has not lasted even a full year.  I purchased it Dec. 11 of last year, and as of July of this year, the battery is dead.  I can&#x27;t blame that on my son; he charged it appropriately, cleaned it properly, and only shaved a few times a week, so it was not overused.  I am not pleased that my purchase did not last  even a year.  I expected better from Norelco, and am wondering if this battery was defective, or if  this is the quality I can now expect from the Norelco brand. **update - I did speak with customer service at Norelco and they agreed to replace the handle portion of the unit, where the battery is located.  I still don&#x27;t think I could recommend this razor, though, as I&#x27;m not sure if this was an unusual problem, or a symptom of declining quality.</li>
    <li> My husband just told me the other day how much he like this shaver. He didn&#x27;t think he would. I got it for him because he hurt his hand. Now he won&#x27;t go back to a razor.</li>
    <li> Good for the price, but not the closest shave you&#x27;ve ever had in your life. I usually shave 2 to 3 times a week, and this product is great for those quick shaves. Perfect for people who need to shave but don&#x27;t wanna deal with razor blades and creme.</li>
    <li> Few bells and whistles.  However, for the money, this is a very good electric razor. It performs better than my $60 razor.</li>
    <li> This is my first shaver, I just tried it for the first time and it is better than using old razor blades</li>
    <li> This razor gives me a close shave and the trimmer does a good job of keeping my beard looking well groomed. I don&#x27;t think you can beat it considering it&#x27;s reasonable cost.</li>
    <li> This was ordered for my 83 year old father! He has several medical issues including loss of use of his hand and legs not moving well. But this is easy for him to use.</li>
    <li> He didn&#x27;t know where to get a good razor for a good price, I can count on Amazon to have what I need.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d hoped that this would give me a nice clean shave (as my previous Philips Norelco had).  But it really doesn&#x27;t work very well. It&#x27;s also not washable, which is a definite step down from the other razor, but my main complaint is how long it takes to shave with this thing.  It really just doesn&#x27;t do a very good job cutting hair.</li>
    <li> very smooth shave. No pre-shave needed. So glad I got it. Highly recommended for anyone who needs to upgrade and stay within a budget.</li>
    <li> I have (3) Philips Norelco rechargeable cordless razors. They have performed very well over the years but are now simply wearing out.&lt;br /&gt;Based on my good experience with Norelco in the past I purchased a new Norelco 6948XL/41 rechargeable cordless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It worked fine right out of the box, however, the head mechanism does not fit properly when I pop it off to clean everyday. Also, the rear hinge for the head is no longer there. This means the head &amp; cutters come off in your hand or fall in the sink or on the floor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With the addition of a $.03 hinge I would have given a 5 star rating.</li>
    <li> This is a better razor that my old re-chargeable razor was as far as it&#x27;s ability to hold a charge longer. My old Norelco razor would only hold a charge for 2 days before needing to be recharged. This one [Philips Norelco 6948XL/41 Rechargeable Cordless Razor] will hold  charge for at least a week, maybe longer. This is in my opinion, an entry level cordless razor, and having said that, gives an entry level shave, but I would recommend this razor.</li>
    <li> Worked fine for first few days, then completely stop working,  terrible product. I wish I didn&#x27;t buy it. Bought a quality shaver,  works great</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not a loud razor and it&#x27;s very light. A good razor for the price.I&#x27;m very satisfied.Is a good choice.</li>
    <li> Somewhere on Amazon, in reply to a review or question, I stated that I&#x27;ve been satisfied with my ancient Norelco model 705RL but it was finally seeming kinda dull, and I&#x27;d simply like a new one just like it.  This is it, except it&#x27;s also cordless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wasn&#x27;t thrilled with everything being cordless -- suppose it runs out, I need a shave, and forgot to charge it?  The good news is that this will also operate by using the cord. The bad news is that if you do that constantly, the battery life (as the instructions state) will be diminished.  The good news is that if you use the cord only in emergencies, my guess is that any effect will be negligible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has a pop-up trimmer.  It&#x27;s much, much more effective than the trimmer on my old Norelco -- that&#x27;s probably just because of the old one&#x27;s age (it used to work well).  I also bought Norelco&#x27;s basic groomer, but doubt I&#x27;ll use it.  The shaver&#x27;s trimmer seems, while very effective, less aggressive than the groomer&#x27;s (which also sounds louder, like a barber&#x27;s trimmer).  Which means if you&#x27;re trimming a beard, the shaver allows a little margin for error.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shaver&#x27;s sound is nicely muted, and compared to my old one, mechanically the old one sounds like Model T.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I sometimes skip a day or three before shaving. Using a pre-shave lotion, this shaver has no problem catching me up.  And if I let it go too long, I just start by using the pop-up trimmer, then finish up with this shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although this shaver is not immersible, the blade head comes off completely (press a button and it lifts right off). I used to do this with my old shaver, and either slid out the blades and immersed the parts in alcohol, or simply held the assembly under the faucet. (Put a strainer over the drain!) Once dry, reassemble.  This model&#x27;s instructions don&#x27;t say you can do this (or not), but I see no reason why an a occasional brush-out and rinse like this won&#x27;t keep it clean, efficient, and sanitary.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There&#x27;s a 45-day Money-back guarantee, mainly aimed at former razor users but apparently valid for any user.  (You pay to ship insured to them.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Instructions state to charge it for a full 8 hours, for 35 minutes&#x27; use.  I don&#x27;t use it every day, but the first charge has held okay for more than a week. Instructions state: \\&quot;Battery performance is best if you recharge only when the batteries are (almost) completely empty. ... Continuously recharging or continuously using as a corded razor will reduce life of batteries. You may also shave using the power cord provided. This razor will not recharge while being used corded. Charging and recharging requires a full 8 hours. If razor has not been used for at least 1 month, razor must be recharged for a full 8 hours. ... Connect the charging plug into any 100V to 240V AC outlet. Use only the the power cord provided.\\&quot;  Outside North America, a plug adapter may be needed.  The cord is a simple coiled cord (no power brick) that stretches comfortably from 18\\&quot; to about 36\\&quot;.  There is no low-charge or full-charge light, so make note of what time you plugged it in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Register your purchase online and you&#x27;ll get an additional 6 months on the 2-year warranty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No doubt Norelco&#x27;s more expensive models are cooler, and maybe they even shave better or something.  But this does the job for me.</li>
    <li> Typical Chinese product. Fully charged it stops rotating intermittently. Just feels cheap to the touch. I went back to my old shaver.</li>
    <li> I hate devices that have proprietary cables. I also don&#x27;t like when companies change cables. Norelco used the same type of charger cable. It was nice because I could use the same old cables. Now they changed. Just irks me, that&#x27;s all.</li>
    <li> I have used a Norelco shaver for MANY years. This unit shaves as smoothly as my other units. However, it does seem to be a bit slower cutting than my corded units in the past.</li>
    <li> I do not know how the recipient likes this razor product since he lives in another state. He needed electric shaver to avoid cutting himself.</li>
    <li> Works great for about 2 weeks then gets dull but can use for another couple weeks</li>
    <li> no problems with this product.</li>
    <li> Clean &amp; close shave&lt;br /&gt;Great value</li>
    <li> This Norelco does the same job for me that a &amp;#34;high end&amp;#34; much more expensive shaver did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has all things i need  (charger, mustache trimmer attached to main unit, can be taken out of charger (portable) to carry around, etc)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing it doesn&#x27;t have is the ability to get wet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So i simply am careful &amp; avoid water, no problem for me.</li>
    <li> great father&#x27;s day present</li>
    <li> Great little shaver at a good price.</li>
    <li> meets the requirements is good, I recommend</li>
    <li> Great product. Worked perfectly as advertised. Highly recommended. I owned one from Panasonic before and it did the job just fine.</li>
    <li> My husband love this razor. No fiddling with a metal straight edge razor, nicks and razor burn ,anymore. Always a smooth feel.</li>
    <li> It was like shaving with a wood chipper.</li>
    <li> My ten year old Norelco razor served me very well but, asked me if he could retire. I said yes and quickly logged into Amazon to keep my beard neatly trimmed! My new  Norelco razor must be on steroids, much more quicker shave and even closer. My older razor served me well but, I really like my new razor!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Almost forget to tell you the price was very low, treat your self to a new quick closer and cleaner shave. Your partner is also going to be thrilled with a smoother beard, you will enjoy the benefits!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;wishing you better shaving!</li>
    <li> This review may help you decide between this Norelco and a Remington Microscreen (MS2-390) my husband owns.  The Remington is still going strong after four years.  It was top rated in Consumer Reports magazine at the time he bought it.  His facial hair is mostly light with a few patches of course hair and two trouble areas (areas you just can&#x27;t cut close enough, even with a disposable razor).  He shaves 2 or 3 times per week and cleans the unit irregularly.  Both of these machines have the power to cut facial hair effortlessly without stopping or pulling.  He does say he pushes on his face more with the norelco to shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Both Norelco and Remington have sideburn trimmers.  The Norelco&#x27;s is easier to trim around ears with, but the Remington is easier to cut sideburns straight.  The Norelco trimmer seems to be engineered better:  flip out vs. the Remington&#x27;s slow release pop up, which can get jammed with trimmings which requires extra fiddling/pulling to get it to pop out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Remington Advantages&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Closer shave --- the Remington cuts closer, so he can go an extra day without shaving again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Trimmer is better for cutting sideburns straight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Norelco Advantages&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Price --- on average, and barring special deals, a Norelco will be cheaper up front, and cheaper to replace.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Noise --- the Norelco is quiet enough for conversations while using it, without raising voices.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Irritation --- after using the Norelco most times, he doesn&#x27;t feel the need to use aftershave.  After using the Remington, he has to use it; he can just feel it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cleaning --- in the Norelco, the trimmings are easier to \\&quot;tap out\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Safety --- removing the top to clean does not expose you to sharp blades.  Although he&#x27;s never cut myself with the Remington, when he looks at the exposed blades, he&#x27;s afraid to touch them let alone try to clean them or get his lips too close to try and blow trimmings from them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Trimmer is better engineered and more useful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, he just wishes the norelco shaved closer.</li>
    <li> I replaced a similar unit that I had for six years. This model is much quieter and does a nice job, although it takes lots of strokes to get the neck whiskers. For the money it can&#x27;t be beat.</li>
    <li> had one almost like it for over 20 years and it finally gave out....not corded....like the cord/cordless factor and international current.</li>
    <li> Have used Norelco for over 40 years and the last two have been disappointing because the motor speeds are less powerful making it more difficult to get a closer, faster shave.  I actually took the blades from the new razor and am using in my old razor as it was just as cheap to buy the razor as to buy new blades.</li>
    <li> Very poor shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Needed an electric razor for 3 weeks so did not want to spend a lot of money,  Did not get a close shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would not recommend this model to anyone,</li>
    <li> After my cheap $19 Braun razor broke down after three years, my wife got me the Norelco rechargeable for a Christmas present. I like that I can get a shave done in minutes, without needing to apply anything. It may not shave as close as a standard disposable razor, but for complying to military regulations for being clean shaven, it works very well.</li>
    <li> Close shave, very quiet, good price purchased for son.</li>
    <li> For the price the razor works fine.  Took me a bit to realize that the head can only be put on one way so you have to be cautious about lining the head up properly.. Otherwise once that is done it works fine.&lt;br /&gt;You have no way of knowing when the charge is complete though the light does not flash or change color..  That too was different than the older one that I had.. Must had needed to order the next model.</li>
    <li> I like this Philips Norelco 6948XL/41 Rechargeable Cordless Razor , which own a low price. You can buy it if just for daily cleaning.</li>
    <li> I ordered this one for my son and he is a happy camper. As of now I own 2 of them.</li>
    <li> Meets the purpose I sought from an inexpensive razor.  It does a reasonably good job for a quick shave.  The price is right for what I wanted.  I would recommend to someone else who wants a razor to meet my objectives.  Do not expect the close, easy shave you would get from a razor that costs $100 or more, not one less than $30.  As I said it meets my requirements for an occasional shave.</li>
    <li> The perfect shave for the perfect price</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for sometime for an electric razor that would do at least an adequate job on my head. I attempted for awhile to use a foil-style electric razor, but it ever did that good of a job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, I&#x27;ve only had one shave with this razor, but this Norelco shaved the two-day hair growth on my head as good if not slightly better than the Mach 3 I normally use. Even after one shave, I cannot really imagine returning to a blade, not if this razor continues to shave my head as well as it did today. I&#x27;ll update this review if my opinion changes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you need an inexpensive razor to shave your head, I highly recommend this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: I&#x27;ve now used this razor daily for six weeks, and I am still as satisfied with it as I was after that first shave. I have even used it on my face (once) and it did as great of a job as it has on my head. I&#x27;ve put away all my wet shaving gear. It simply is not needed with how effective this razor is for me. I am a very satisfied customer.</li>
    <li> Best cost for an excellent shaver.</li>
    <li> The item is worth every penny u spent on it.It works very well and not expensive,so I strongly recommend it</li>
    <li> This has been so far a great purchase. My husband only buys Norelco&#x27;s, so this was a no brainer. I did not expect a 5.00 dollar coupon off, but it surely came in handy. He gets a very close shave with this razor and would recommend it to others who are shopping for a good product.</li>
    <li> You simply can&#x27;t beat this product at this value! This thing is the best electric shaver I&#x27;ve ever used before and it&#x27;s got a smoother closer shave than any super high priced shaver. Shaves close enough to where I don&#x27;t even bother with the blades anymore which is a huge $ saver. The battery power is good enough for me, I rarely have to charge it and I use it regularly.</li>
    <li> I received a sealed box unit, but the shaver head is extremely dull and does NOT cut well. It takes 45 minutes to shave what should take 5-10 minutes.</li>
    <li> It pulls my hairs hard and it doesnt cut all that much.&lt;br /&gt;Why even bother selling this crap?&lt;br /&gt;if you got a big beard, its great, but for short every day shaves...ouch</li>
    <li> I purchased the Phillips Norelco rechargeable razor as a gift for my father and he was very happy with it. He has Parkinson&#x27;s disease so this razor will help him groom himself better.  Thanks</li>
    <li> Purchased for my son as his first electirc shaver.&lt;br /&gt;He has had no issues and this works as expected&lt;br /&gt;in that it won&#x27;t shave as closely as a blade, but is&lt;br /&gt;perfect for a quick touch-up of the &amp;#34;scruff&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> The HQ( is the best shaver head I have used.</li>
    <li> Great price great item. Would buy again</li>
    <li> I have been using Norelco razors for 30+ years. I have to agree with another review that the newer models  don&#x27;t seem to be made as well as older models. However, the razor runs the same and cuts just as well. The bottom line, though, is that it cost a lot less than others I have owned so I would say it is a good buy!</li>
    <li> Great for price but great brand</li>
    <li> Good product and seller.</li>
    <li> Works great since I got it a month ago. Very comfortably fit your face and shave with low sound.</li>
    <li> Product is okay but dose not give clean shave.Charging and battery lasts good,Good for travelling overseas,dual charging system.Needs blade upgrade only.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a gift for my husband whose shaver had died.  He loves it!  It shaves effortlessly and completely.  What else can you ask for?&lt;br /&gt;Mrs.W</li>
    <li> Does a great job, especially on the neck, and leaves me little or no irritation. My skin is very sensitive but my beard stubble is very thick/wirey (Greek-Russian background) so I wear out razor blades pretty quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only shaver that consistently cut through my beard was the Wahl Bump Free foil shaver but it would leave me with irritation on the sides and on the neck. When I got this one while waiting for a replacement foil for the other shaver, I picked this one up relatively inexpensively on Amazon. Note: It is always a good idea, I think, to have two shavers--one for backup/travel, the other as your &amp;#34;daily driver.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, I stopped using the Wahl shaver because I like this one so much. Granted, they&#x27;re two different shavers (rotary vs. foil) and this one is also a tad cheaper than the Wahl. However, it gets my neck stubble a lot easier and It&#x27;s also a LOT quieter than I&#x27;m used to; you might not think this is an issue but wait until you wake up your spouse with it. This shaver is pretty quiet by comparison to what I&#x27;m used to, and doesn&#x27;t wake up the misses. As for the shave quality, it&#x27;s certainly blade-close for me. I think I get a better shave with this Norelco than a blade because it gets my neck hair really well and doesn&#x27;t nick or irritate me. Also, one of the niceties is that this shaver can be used while plugged in. If the battery dies while you&#x27;re shaving (you&#x27;ll hear it wind-down), you can plug it in and use it on AC.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cleaning is a bit tricky. The manual tells you that cleaning the blades shouldn&#x27;t be more than a monthly affair, and once weekly to empty the hair trap. I empty the hair trap daily and clean the blades approximately every other week. I realize I do it a little more than most but I don&#x27;t like the &amp;#34;smell&amp;#34; that shavers get when they&#x27;re not cleaned regularly. The cleaning procedure outlined in the manual is simple enough to follow and does a good job but the blades and foils are very delicate (e.g. tricky) so take your time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I&#x27;m delighted with this little shaver. I don&#x27;t like shaving in the shower (never have) so a dry shaver is all I want, and this does that quite well.te (e.g. tricky) so take your time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I&#x27;m delighted with this little shaver.

    <li> better than the 100 bucks Panasonic,&lt;br /&gt; unbeatable price too&lt;br /&gt;surprisingly good!&lt;br /&gt;highly recommend&lt;br /&gt;highly recommend&lt;br /&gt;better than the 100 bucks Panasonic,&lt;br /&gt; unbeatable price too</li>
    <li> Cuts well but I forgot how nice the floating blades were in the higher end norelco razors.  This makes maneuvering the razor somewhat more uncomfortable.</li>
    <li> This product is nearly identical to my previous razor and easy to use. Replacement heads are identical to my old razor.</li>
    <li> Good quality and fast  shipping.</li>
    <li> it doesn´t shave as I expect it im really disappointed</li>
    <li> The shaver is lightweight, comfortable, good quality, I recommend it.</li>
    <li> I bought this to my son, it seems to me it is not much power if you have very thick beard or you just have to be very patient.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Norelco electric razors for almost 40 years.  Over the years they have gotten lighter and with fewer frills (the old ones use to have a hard clamshell case for storage.)  But the basic design of the lower end models like this one have stayed the same, in fact, this one reminds me of one of the first ones that I used - solid and simple.  The shave is pretty good, although it takes more time to shave the area under the nose for some reason. The full size sideburn cutter is great.  The razor works well under the chin as well as behind the neck under the hairline. Super easy to clean although once the razor heads component is removed for cleaning it comes all the way off, and call fall to the ground if you are not careful (unlike some of the other models in which that component is attached and just pops up for cleaning.) Overall I would recommend this razor for the person who likes things simple, and cheap, but of good quality.</li>
    <li> Great shaver. Great value.</li>
    <li> Great shaver for the price.  Just be aware that it comes with the CloseCut heads not the Lift-and-Cut heads so it is not nearly as close as every other shaver Norelco has made since at least the 1960s when I got my first one.  Buying new heads gets you the better shave.  Until then, don&#x27;t judge based on these inferior heads.</li>
    <li> So far, so good. It&#x27;s not a loud razor and it&#x27;s very light (in comparison with the last one I had which is like 10 years old). It&#x27;s got a good cut. A  good razor for the price.</li>
    <li> Actually surprisingly great shave but not being able to take in shower is a real bummer.</li>
    <li> The closest shave yet from a Norelco shaver.</li>
    <li> I am very disappointed in the quality of the shaver. I had a norelco razor that was about 20 years old &amp; this razor doesn&#x27;t seem to do any better than the old one.</li>
    <li> This shaver is the best I have ever used and I have owned most of the major brands.  I got it two weeks ago and its performance exceeds my expectations.  The charge lasts about one week which is good.  It can be charged while shaving unlike shavers you can use in the shower.  It  shaves close in a short time without making a lot of passes.  I would recommend as a good choice to anyone.</li>
    <li> A few months ago, I bought this razor and it was exactly what I needed and worked very well. You get a close shave without irritation. But, the other day, the whole thing just fell apart, and after talking to a few people, this razor seems to do that sometimes. I&#x27;d probably either get another brand or at least a different model.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had many Norelco electric shavers over the years.  This one is a chargeable one, but you can use it plugged in as well.  The shave is extremely nice, close, comfortable, but I attribute that to the blades, and many of their units use similar / same blades, so why pick this one?  This one has the trimmer (not all of them do!).  This one has a nice metal part that holds the heads, some of their other ones are plastic (maybe not a big deal).  The heads on this one float nice (so do many of the others).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have two different Norelco razors right now, one in each bathroom, and I like this one over the other one, a 7310 (and previously I had a 6940).  However, I get the sense that this 6948 works hard, and needs a charge more frequently to stay at full strength.  Whereas the 7310 works hard longer in between charges.  The 7310 has a feature that allow you to wash the heads out under water carefully, without removing them from the unit, sort of nice, but I don&#x27;t do it all that often.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can see more about the 7310 here:  [[ASIN:B001AJ6YS2 Philips Norelco 7310 Men&#x27;s Shaving System]]</li>
    <li> For a few dollars more than a new set of shaver heads, I get a new shaver, too.</li>
    <li> it seems cheap and does not cut very close...spotty hair patches..wish i had not bought it. still have to use a reg razor</li>
    <li> It would be nice if this shaver had the same feature as my previous Norelco: I could rinse that one by water. Otherwise it&#x27;s as good as other Norelco shavers I had before.</li>
    <li> Philips models 6948XL and AT830 are among the most useful of current rotary shavers. Both have articulated cutting heads in 3-head assemblies that are imbedded in shaver bodies rather than in floating holders. Both have internal batteries and wide, pop-up trimmers. Neither comes with a charging stand. A battery charge is rated to provide 35 minutes use with model 6948XL and 50 minutes use with model AT830.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Value-priced model 6948XL has a nickel-metal-hydride battery, has cutting heads mounted in a fixed holder and is not waterproof, providing only dry shaving. It connects directly to AC power. Its internal power converter takes a rated 8 hours to charge the battery. There are no battery indicator lights, so users guess when the battery needs charging and time the charges themselves. Model 6948XL uses the older HQ56 heads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Intermediate-priced model AT830 has a lithium-ion battery, has cutting heads mounted in a rocking holder and is waterproof, allowing wet shaving. It comes with an external 15 volt, 5 watt AC-to-DC power converter that charges the battery in an hour or less. Indicator lights show when the battery needs charging and when it is fully charged. Model AT830 uses the newer HQ8 heads that provide somewhat closer shaves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The newer HQ8 heads each have two segments with fine, circular holes that are positioned toward the inside of a 3-head assembly. They are apparently intended to emulate the performance of foil shavers, handling short whiskers so that they are squarely cut. However, there are only 9 blades on an HQ8 cutter versus 15 blades on an older HQ56 cutter. To compensate, AT-series shavers rotate about 50 percent faster.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shave quality with model AT830 is good, if not quite as close as one gets from skillful use of a straight razor. It takes somewhat longer to get a uniform shave with model AT830 than with model 6948XL. Shave quality with model 6948XL is marginal, although it is better than one got with Norelco rotaries years ago. With either current Philips model, it takes less time to get uniform coverage of difficult neck and chin areas than it usually takes with a foil shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Philips rotaries have become value leaders among current electric shavers. Performance has improved over the Norelco rotary shavers of years ago--the brand Philips distributed in North America before the early 1980s. Philips currently offers models with good performance at premium, intermediate and value prices. Premium models have cutting heads mounted in floating holders and come with charging stands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I began using Remington electrics years ago, when they were the most reliable units of the day. In those days Norelco provided a shave with little skin irritation, but it was a fairly coarse shave with poor feel and appearance. Then Braun, while owned by Gillette, introduced titanium foil shavers that combined fairly close shaves with little skin irritation, and I switched to them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, foil shavers don&#x27;t cope well with outlying areas of neck and chin, where whiskers tend to bend over and escape being clipped. The Braun triple-track design does better than just a curved foil, but it typically needs many passes to provide a uniform shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With their high speeds, foil shavers don&#x27;t really cut whiskers. They grind whiskers to powder, provided the whiskers can be persuaded through the holes in the surface of a foil. Currently Braun is delivering its best foil technology to the U.S. only at premium prices, encouraging another look at alternatives.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rotary shavers provide much of their action around the edges of disk-shaped \\&quot;combs\\&quot; where whiskers can slip through slots. Their low speeds encourage shaving with slower and more strategic motions. Because rotaries are quiet, one easily hears when cutters engage whiskers. Recent Philips models provide thinner combs and more precise mating of cutter blades to combs, as compared with Norelco models of years ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cleaning a rotary shaver appears more important than cleaning a foil shaver. Larger whisker fragments put drag on heads and internal parts. Removing head assemblies and brushing while dry has proved most effective, even though model AT830 can be washed with hot water. Philips does not offer cleaning accessories comparable to accessories from Braun. A few premium shavers have cleaning bases that can&#x27;t be bought separately.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Philips model AT830 is a good choice for everyday use at home. Overall, it performs as well or better than current foil shavers and provides uniform shaves somewhat faster. However, a little more time will be spent cleaning the shaver. Model 6948XL might be a good choice as a travel shaver. It&#x27;s somewhat more rugged and won&#x27;t cost as much to replace if lost or damaged.</li>
    <li> Got this for my boyfriend. He likes it a lot</li>
    <li> It is a good shaving machine, better than what i had expected.  It is not great great but i like it that is more powerful than my previous norelco</li>
    <li> Gives a nice close shave as did my previous Norelco.  I&#x27;ve been using is for 10 days without recharging the battery.</li>
    <li> Have to charge for 8 hrs so a great difference from more expensive models...also no full charge indicator.  Guess when charged</li>
    <li> This Electric Razor was such a great deal for the price! At first I was Skeptical because I&#x27;ve been a razor man, but I wont be needing those anymore with this!</li>
    <li> The shaver is working to my satisfaction</li>
    <li> I own an older, more expensive model which I really like.  I bought this one to use exclusively on my face while using my older one for my head.  This new one is adequate but not as good as the more expensive model.  But, it&#x27;s ok.</li>
    <li> Next time I will try to find the date of manufacture.&lt;br /&gt;This was an old model. Not worth fussing about but less than satisfactory.</li>
    <li> VERY fast, close, painless shave, doesn&#x27;t seem like you had to do anything and you&#x27;re done.  Works on 110 or 220 V.</li>
    <li> My grandfathers favorite</li>
    <li> Like I said above this is my first electric shaver, but so far I have been using this for about 6 months now and it works great and is also a great price.  Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> The head comes apart to clean easy and there is a company that makes a kit to sharpen it. My first one lasted me almost ten years. I bought the first one at Andrews AFB, and it died while deployed to Iraq.</li>
    <li> Just perfect for my sons first electric razor!</li>
    <li> It is cheap and good, not great but here is the thing it is cheap you feel me. I like that I can shave while it is connected to the charger.</li>
    <li> As good, or better, than previous ones and great service!</li>
    <li> Quick, quiet, cheap.  Love it.</li>
    <li> Good product and good seller.</li>
    <li> This razor gives a good close shave.  The only negative is it cannot be cleaned by putting it in running water.  The pop up trimmer does not work as well as the 7000 series.  Still it is a good buy.</li>
    <li> Excellent. Works well, holds a charge well.</li>
    <li> It was a early farther day gift for my hubby Charles his stoped working I used some of points and got a really deal</li>
    <li> It is more like a low 3 star product, but the crazy LOW PRICE and free Amazon Shipping, it is worth every dollar you pay for it.  It work fine.  Not waterproof .... but it&#x27;s fine if you are broke, as I am.</li>
    <li> All is good with this purchase.</li>
    <li> Now, let me say this. this cant be washed. There aren&#x27;t enough words for me to describe my dissapointment in this product, because I have my international courrier, and when i receive it, I wished this had a sign saying, IT CANT BE WASH, i would be happy, but it doesnt.</li>
    <li> Does what it&#x27;s supposed to. May buy next level up next time.  : - )</li>
    <li> I was HIGHLY distressed in the whole experience. I felt,under the circumstances Philips Norelco could have shown greater compassion for someone who has been a customer for years.</li>
    <li> I found the unit while somewhat adequate, it is under powered.  It seems to run down quickly as evident from the motor sound after about 5 minutes.  It is not near as close a shave as indicated in the write ups and competitor comparisons.  I have seen the same model at Walmart, and Aldi Supermarket for the same price only you don&#x27;t have to pay shipping.  This in my case would have saved over 5 dollars.  If you are in it for the long term, spend more money on one that will do a better job.  I would not recommend the Philips Norelco 6948XL/41 Shaver 2100.</li>
    <li> I love this inexpensive Norelco electric shaver.  I have had really bad acne all my life (now in 40s) and have always used electric shavers since I was a teenager because they do not cut your pimples or other acne like a regular razor does and you do not have to use shaving cream which can also irritate acne.  I also bought my 15 year old son who also has bad acne one and he thinks it&#x27;s great.</li>
    <li> Good shaver for the money. I&#x27;ve always used Noreclo and I rate this as good but I&#x27;ve owned better.&lt;br /&gt;It was strictly a &amp;#34;How can I go wrong for $30.&amp;#34; decision. Shave is OK for me.</li>
    <li> Gave this to my father as a Father&#x27;s Day gift. He seems pleased and I am as I now have to shave. It replaced one that he must of kept for 20+ years. It works.</li>
    <li> Bought it as a gift for my dad.  He said it was ok which is high praise from him.</li>
    <li> This one replaces a similar model I had for 5+ years. These are so so cheap that it makes sense to replace the whole razor rather than buy new blades which cost almost as much. Shaves smooth and close like the last one.</li>
    <li> its an ok shaver it worked for 4 months with out fail but has started to get dulled and clogs easier as time goes on and now is a tad bit painful to work with after 6 months</li>
    <li> the quality and the power when shelving was a bit unexpected. i bit disappointed .</li>
    <li> The closest in electric, well worth the money I got it today and shaved my head first bald. Excellent On face too.</li>
    <li> Very quiet.  Does a great job, but, I suppose that IS because it is new and blades are very sharp yet.  Very satisfied!</li>
    <li> Great product, I have had a beard for years and recently shaved for professional reasons and hate razor shaving daily. I do have a heavy and corse ginger beard so I wasn&#x27;t expecting this shaver to do as well as it does.</li>
    <li> Works great and gives a nice close and smooth shave. Very quiet</li>
    <li> I have owned much more expensive razors from Philips but this one does the job well.  I&#x27;m fortunate in that I live in 3 different homes and have electric razors at each place.  I went to Amazon, my favorite place and ordered their best seller which cost $29 bucks.  Works great and from now on I&#x27;m re-buying this product only</li>
    <li> I use my 2 pair morning and eve daily</li>
    <li> This is the best shaver I have every used. The battery lasts very very long. I have never even charged it since I got it out of the box. Also the flip out clipper on the back is very handy.</li>
    <li> I did not expect greatly this thing..&lt;br /&gt;Because price is low.&lt;br /&gt;But, I was mistaken.&lt;br /&gt;Was veryer good than ideas..&lt;br /&gt;To front, is likely to use well.&lt;br /&gt;This thing is really cool.</li>
    <li> My dad tried it, and it didn&#x27;t do a good job at all</li>
    <li> works ok but thought it would have been more effective. I would not consider it a waster of time and money  at all.</li>
    <li> I had one that was almost like it. Found out it was more economical  to replace razor than buy  new heads and blades.</li>
    <li> This is great for any guy. I bought this as a gift for my boyfriend and he loves it. He uses it at least 3 times a week and he hasn&#x27;t had to plug it in to charge it once and it&#x27;s been about 3 months.</li>
    <li> can&#x27;t complaint... for $14 i paid, this is a great razor...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;does a good job... very light, and battery last long enough for at least 5 shavings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i keep mine in the car for last min touch ups</li>
    <li> Bought for my son&#x27;s first razor for a gift. He likes it. I have a different Norelco and Norelco&#x27;s are the best! His seems to work as well as mine, flexible heads, rechargeable.</li>
    <li> Self sharpening titanium blades are awesome plus it gives a nice close shave around my goatee. highly recommended. Awesome shave every time!!</li>
    <li> Unbelievable - almost too good! Had a real old triple head and not using it.  I was using a blade for the last 5 years.  Bought two, one for each of my sons, and tried it.  Going to buy one for myself.  UPDATE: 4 months later and still shaving great!  UPDATE: Just bought one for myself - kids left for school.</li>
    <li> Good, does NOT come with a case, just FYI</li>
    <li> I STUCK WITTH A PHILIPS THATS SAME AS MY OLD 1</li>
    <li> Norelco makes the best razors. I have yet to not be happy with their products. The price on this particular model was fantastic. What reason do I have paying the high prices when I got this one for such a great price and it works perfectly.</li>
    <li> I, a woman, use this to shave my legs.  After a few times of doing it, my shave is plenty close and there are no nasty razor cuts.  I&#x27;m going to teach my 10 year old daughter to use an electric razor when she&#x27;s old enough.  SO much better for the skin that a blade.</li>
    <li> Surprised myself with this razor. I almost always prefer a regular razor for a close-shave but also enjoy the convenience of an electric for a quick shave...... even if I have to use one twice a day, morning and night. I never thought I could get a close shave with an electric..... but this one actually does deliver a close shave without burning the skin (an important point). It is also very quiet, another pleasant surprise. The pop-up trimmer works pretty nice too for sideburns and close to the ears for &amp;#34;shag&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> Went with this for the price, features and had a norelco in the past. smoother shave than my remington.  holds charge for about 6, maybe 7 shaves. motor does run slower than my other. have only used 4-6 weeks so can&#x27;t talk about how long it will last.</li>
    <li> When it arrived, I charged it for 8 hrs.  I used it after 2 wks for 10-12 hrs as I forgot about it (I am 70 yrs old).  At the end of that time it was dead, and would not recharge.  I guess it does not have overcharge protection.</li>
    <li> He must like it, he hasn&#x27;t complained at all.</li>
    <li> Best electric I have had so far.Stays charged for a long time like a month or so.</li>
    <li> Really great razor and for the price you cant go wrong. Leaves a nice shave and really good battery life.</li>
    <li> The next model up is a better value, mainly due to advanced lithium-ion battery. It also spins faster and cuts closer.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent razor for the price. I recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Michael Beitler, Ph.D.&lt;br /&gt;Author of &amp;#34;Strategic Organizational Change, Third Edition&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> Got this for my son and it works great.</li>
    <li> I have been using a 20+ yr old Norelco shaver and it has been an excellent performer with a really great design.  The power cord connection was damaged during a business trip so I decided to buy this equivalent style Norelco model.  As noted by another reviewer, the motor runs significantly slower - and seems to be barely able to handle the task of a simple shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If Norelco monitors these reviews as other companies do, I&#x27;d like to know how you managed to ignore decades of making top quality shavers and then somewhere along the line, decide to make this junk.  Here &#x27; s a tip, you might try testing your products outside the lab before putting them on the market.  If you had, feedback would have clearly picked up this performance deficiency.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m fixing my 25 year old shaver and will return this new model shortly.</li>
    <li> Great razor, no complaints</li>
    <li> The shaver is excellent, it gives a very nice smooth cut.</li>
    <li> outperforms more expensive brands.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my teenage son.  He absolutely LOVES it.  I love it too.  Great little razor for the legs while he&#x27;s at school.  Get it.</li>
    <li> WORKS WELL, THIS WAS BOUGHT TO REPLACE A LOST ONE JUST LIKE IT. DOES A NICE SHAVE AND TRIM. THANK YOU.</li>
    <li> Very effective. I use it much more than I had anticipated.</li>
    <li> Closet shave ever with electric shaver</li>
    <li> GIving this to my husband because he has a REALLY LONG BEARD :)</li>
    <li> Originally I bought one of the Power Touch razors (from another retailer) and used it for two weeks. It kept nicking me every time I used it so I returned it on Norelco&#x27;s 45 day guarantee and bought this razor instead. This is a great little razor. It&#x27;s very light weight and quiet. It shaves the way I expect Norelco razors to shave (with no nicks or cuts).</li>
    <li> The shaver seemed to shave fairly well but the charge or use cord would not stay in place to charge without without wedging something against it to hold cord connected and if you tried to shave with cord connected because battery was low it just fell out. This was the case on two shavers sent to me. The second one the cord would stay connected during a charge if the cord was put in one way only, but that&#x27;s not how the cord is made-it should work no matter which way the was plugged into the shaver. Not an Amazon problem but a Norelco/Phillips problem. Very disappointed in Norelco QA for this shaver-expected better.I have two other Norelco shavers (one is really old and works fine) that are quality items.</li>
    <li> I got one of these for each of my sons. It was a key Christmas present for them. Their smiles were broad when they saw it. Since they shave every day it is really nice to have a new shaver. Now they think of me when they shave every day.</li>
    <li> Got it on sale on Amazon and the product is great. My father loves using it and I recommended it to relatives</li>
    <li> the product came on time and is just asadvertised</li>
    <li> My first experience with an electric shaver, because I currently can&#x27;t use the safety razor I&#x27;ve always used.  I&#x27;m very satisfied with the performance of the Phillips Norelco and amazed at how long the battery stays charged.  It&#x27;s been 4 weeks since my initial charge and the battery is still providing power for the shaver.&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I would like would be a charge indicator light telling me when to charge the unit and when it has been fully charged.&lt;br /&gt;An excellent shaver for the price.</li>
    <li> As modern and up to date as possible. I could feel a big difference the first time i used it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Norelco razorsfor decades.  I chooseto get new ones when I could have replaced the razor heads.  Thidone is economical, but it&#x27;s performance is outstanding.  It takes only 8 hours to recargebatteries; my last one needed an overnight charge from when itstoped running as I startedto shave.  I expected to use it for 12 to 14 days between charges; This one ran for three weeks out of the box.</li>
    <li> I have used a Norelco cordless shaver for years, and have always been happy with the shave it delivered.  Battery life however was not so hot.  I had to recharge the thing every three or four days.  My old shaver died recently, and I ordered this one as a replacement.  The new model shaves every bit as well as my old one did, but the battery charge lasts practically forever.  It arrived fully charged, and I have been using it regularly for a full month, and have not yet had to recharge the battery even once. In fact, if the eight-hour-runtime decribed in the manual is accurate, I will probably only need to charge it two or three times a year.  I love it when I can grab a needed tool any time, and find that it &amp;#34;just works&amp;#34;.  The feeling of freedom is just awesome.  Peg</li>
    <li> I have been a fan of Norelco shaver for a very  long time.  My old shaver was also a Norelco and the battery died after 10 or more years of daily usage.  It still works but I have to connect the plug to use it.  I chose Norelco again without hesitation and this one also met my expectation.  This shaver is not a top of the line shaver that has all the bells and whistles.  It does its own job nicely and reliably.  The battery lasted for long and the noise level is very low.  And it is a light shaver and cut smooth.  I have absolutely no complaints at all.  The only caveat is that the Philips Norelco 6948XL/41 is not water proof.  But I was fine with it.  At this price, I think I could not find any better shaver on the market.</li>
    <li> For a less expensive razor, this does a good job. Close shave, easy to use. I was able to get a more expensive one that could be used in the shower too, so the convience of being able to use it in water and even clean it with water, makes this razor less favorable of the two. However, if not being able to use it with water is not a problem for you, then I would recommend this razor. I have seen razors up to $500, so for $30, definitely worth it. Especially for someone just starting with an electric razor. Some people irritate very easily with them. Find out before you spend a lot of cash.</li>
    <li> price was great. met expected mission.</li>
    <li> Arrived on time and was as advertised.  Not as good quality as my former Norelco shaver that lasted 8-10 years, but pretty hard to beat for the price, with a very nice 2 year warranty.  These are well built and will likely outlast the battery, which will last longer if the instructions are followed regarding letting the batter get to almost empty state before recharging.  Nice that you can replace the blades but I found that by taking them out &amp; cleaning them with an old tooth bruch every few months they are as good as new.</li>
    <li> The shaver is great.  Works well.  I have thick whiskers and usually dread the electric shaver.  Feels like the whiskers are being pulled out by a little guy with tweezers inside the case.  I have tried so many shavers, I almost gave up.  The Norelco works amazing smooth and very quickly shaves smooth without the burn or stubble.  The delivery is also super fast.  Ordered and two days later, it is in my hands.  Highly recommend this shaver.</li>
    <li> All items arrived promptly and performed as I hoped they would.</li>
    <li> I don, t like lt and would like to return it</li>
    <li> The price is fair.the perfomance is decent</li>
    <li> Provides a clean shave with ease. Run long before needs to be recharged. Easy to clean. And fits well in hand</li>
    <li> I am a Norelco user since 30 years ago. Yes,  it&#x27;s a good product. I will keep using this brand.</li>
    <li> Christmas is not about Christ, but it is about us.&lt;br /&gt;I can buy cheaper at the store.&lt;br /&gt;How much money is enough?&lt;br /&gt;This is 100% rip off.</li>
    <li> This was a replacement for Norelco that wore out. Exactly as advertised and easy to use. Excellent for shaving legs.</li>
    <li> my husband loves it.  wore out two so far.  and he looks forward to using this for a long time also.</li>
    <li> This is a modestly priced outfit that  I thought  might be handy to have around for use when I am in a hurry and can make do with an inferior shave. I will be darned, I get a fine shave out of it and am going steady--it is a kind of romance.</li>
    <li> This razor performs well above what I expected.  For an electric shaver, it gives a very close comfortable shave.  I am not always by a plug for electric, this unit works for weeks without recharging.</li>
    <li> This thing misses hairs more often than not. Its so unpredictable that I end up looking like i have leopard spots even when going over the same areas over and over. I ended up using a straight razor to shave the damage this thing did to my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It HURTS on longer hairs. It yanks on them rather than clipping them off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An absolute return.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The directions for this thing say &amp;#34;stick with it&amp;#34; even if you don&#x27;t get the expected results. No thanks.</li>
    <li> Good price and quality. Compares to razors much more expensive.</li>
    <li> I finally replaced my old shaver with this one. It was amazing how much better the shave was.</li>
    <li> Great close shave.  Easy to use and clean</li>
    <li> This was for my dad. It works good on his face.</li>
    <li> This is my third Norelco shaver and I bought it because of the low price. I was not disappointed, it works just fine.</li>
    <li> Amazed at the quality for the price. The single row of blades gets every single hair and it is very smooth. The black plastic looks and feels cool. The unit is quieter than most others. Can&#x27;t believe the price for this.</li>
    <li> This shaver cuts closer than its predecessor&lt;br /&gt;It is quiet in operation and cleans easily.&lt;br /&gt;It recharges quickly in several hours. I usually recharge it  overnight.&lt;br /&gt;For the cost it is a best buy.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been shaving with an electric razor for about 20 years now.  I&#x27;ve never liked using a blade and really like the speed an ease of use of an electric.  For the first 5 years of shaving, I used a floating head type razor like what this Philips offers.  I then switched to a foil type razor and haven&#x27;t looked back, but I thought it would be worth re-visiting this type of razor to see if I would be willing to switch back.  It&#x27;s a tough call.  This razor does offer a lot and does a great job at cutting facial hair, but I think I like the closeness of the foil type razor more.  However, there is nothing wrong with this razor, and if you&#x27;re looking for an inexpensive electric razor I really don&#x27;t think you can go wrong here.  Here are a few of my thoughts on this razor:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s quiet...very quiet.  About 1/3 the volume of my foil razor.  Since that doesn&#x27;t really matter much to me, it wasn&#x27;t a big factor in my overall decision.  I guess I was just surprised a how quiet this razor is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The heads do a fine job cutting.  I actually think this razor is slightly faster on the neck hairs (which as we all know are the hardest to get a close shave on) than my foil razor.  But strangely enough I found shaving under the nose and chin my foil razor did a better job.  I had some difficulty navigating this razor in tight areas like right under the nose.  Still though, this razor did just fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do wish this razor had some sort of indicator that the battery was getting low.  It has 1 light, green, that lights up when the razor is being charged.  But it never tells you when it&#x27;s fully charged, and never warns you when it&#x27;s losing power and ready to recharge.  My foil razor has a battery gauge that shows the % of battery life left which is incredibly handy, especially when traveling.  However, given that my foil razor was 3x as much $ as this one, that&#x27;s just a feature that you have to pay for.  But I think this one could at least have the green light turn yellow, or blink or something to indicate it&#x27;s time to charge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This razor is very light weight which is nice, but given the 3 heads, it&#x27;s bulkier than my foil razor.  Takes up a bit more room, especially when traveling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this is a fine product and it does it&#x27;s job well.  Of course you get what you pay for, and this is a bare bones product with not bells or whistles.yellow, or blink or something to indicate it&#x27;s time to charge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This razor is very light weight which is nice, but given the 3 heads, it&#x27;s bulkier than my foil razor.

    <li> excellent value, we have been looking for one at this price forever but they are difficult to find in the stores.</li>
    <li> very close shave especially for the price.  it&#x27;s a must to set up your beard. williams lectric  is great.use after shave lotion  for soothing feeling.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not the best shaver I&#x27;ve ever used, but I haven&#x27;t broken it yet so that&#x27;s saying something.  You want better, than pony up the dough.</li>
    <li> After complaining for months that is old (so old it used to belong to my dad who passed away over 14 years ago) Norelco shaver would no longer hold a charge, I got this one for his birthday.  He tells me mearly everyday that he loves his new one.  So I guess it was a good present.</li>
    <li> I am satisfied with this razor, but it does not shave as close as a Norelco razor with the same design that I had for 20 years before the rechargeable battery stopped holding a charge</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t mind that the razor was no frills.  I don&#x27;t need a cleaning brush or cheap travel case.  However, the shaving heads were smaller and rough (actually to the touch).  While the razor shaved ok but slower due to smaller head, the shave was painful because of the actual roughness of the shaving heads...not because I had to get used to the new blades.  Am returning to Amazon but they are charging me for the experience because the razor itself wasn&#x27;t in the category of did not work.</li>
    <li> As advertised and delivered as promised.</li>
    <li> shaves well &amp; price is right</li>
    <li> my old norelco seems to be better. it needs new blades, has a flip up head to clean it. new one takes longer time, have to re-attach the head</li>
    <li> Good ítem! And good seller! Thanks!</li>
    <li> Affordable with excellent shaving results.</li>
    <li> It is fine for my needs.</li>
    <li> Had one like this for years, loved it, family bought me a newer model, wet/dry shave that had a cradle charger and had to take off the head to use the trimmer.  Tired of all that so I got back to basics and a great shave and pop up trimmer and just a cord to pack for charging.  Best thing was I got it for less than a third of the price.</li>
    <li> works good I guess I need to get used to it.</li>
    <li> 2nd of the same brand an model, the old one still working, just the blades got busted after 3 years !</li>
    <li> Great for the price! Obviously not the best shaver on the market, but it does a fairly close shave without pulling hairs. Certainly preferable to buying disposable razors and shaving cream all the time.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t have as much power as my old one, but it gets the job done eventually</li>
    <li> arrived on time and its ok</li>
    <li> I had a less expensive model that finally fell apart so I researched new models.  I am very pleased with this one and it&#x27;s the best I&#x27;ve ever had.</li>
    <li> This works fantastic for me. Although maybe because the blades have dulled after lots of use, i&#x27;m having to go over a certain areas few times to get all the hairs. I don&#x27;t recall if it did this in the begging...maybe i just need to switch the blades. But anyway I think it works fine.</li>
    <li> good quality  8 hours of charge time for about 45 minutes of use seems a little wrong  works good</li>
    <li> After numerous frustrations with much more expensive electric shavers, I thought I would give this a try.  Doesn&#x27;t appear to be built &#x27;bulletproof&#x27;.  Might seem slightly &#x27;flimsy.&#x27;  The motor doesn&#x27;t spin very fast.  I thought this was odd but I vowed to give it 7 days &#x27;try-out&#x27; as the manufacturer suggests.  Day 1:  not bad but......  Day 2:  better.  Hey, this thing actually works pretty good.  Day 3:  even better! very close shave actually...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I won&#x27;t bore you with the rest.  This razor is the bomb!  If you give it a week to get used to using it,  I think you&#x27;ll find that it&#x27;s a &#x27;keeper!&#x27;</li>
    <li> Loved it!  I got it for my husband because he is always carving his face up when he is shaving.  (Mostly because he uses disposable razors.)  Finally, I decided that it was time to get him something better.  I saw this and thought it was worth a try for only thirty bucks.  I have been really impressed.  It takes a little while to charge but it holds it&#x27;s charge for a long time.  My husband is one of those lucky individuals that doesn&#x27;t have to shave every day so that might help but I know he doesn&#x27;t have to charge it that often.  The blades last for a year and you can buy the replacements at your local store so it&#x27;s nice and convenient.  we don&#x27;t really have any issues with not being able to wash the razor because my husband just takes it to he sink and pops it a couple times against the blade cover and most of the hair falls right out.  So for us, that doesn&#x27;t seem to be a real problem.  We have never used to the trimmer so I can&#x27;t attest to how that works.  Overall, I recommend it to others I know who are looking for an inexpensive razor that not only gets the job done but does it well.at the same time.  I am very pleased.  My only complaint is the new blades are almost as much as buying the razor all over again but since it&#x27;s only once a year it&#x27;s not that big of a deal.</li>
    <li> I just used it for the first time this morning (7 Jan 2014) and I&#x27;m very impressed.  Normally, to get this close a shave, I have to use a razor and shave directly against the grain-----and I wind up nicking myself half the time in doing so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ergonomic: fits in my hand like a custom made tool.  I have pretty big hands.&lt;br /&gt;Quiet:  unless you live with an extremely light sleeper, you&#x27;re not going to wake anyone up with this shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One caveat I need to add is this:  I cannot grow an actual beard.  The only place on my face that my hair grows-in thickly is on my chin and mouth-----everywhere else on my face my hair comes in very thinly.  So if you&#x27;re the kinda guy that get&#x27;s a 5 o&#x27;clock shadow 5 minutes after you&#x27;re done shaving, this may not be the right electric shaver for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I only paid $19.95 for this so I feel like a got a really good deal.  We&#x27;ll see how long this thing lasts.  Will update you when possible</li>
    <li> The razor arrived in excellent shape and performed smoothly and well.  Shaving took half the time of the old razor.</li>
    <li> Works the same way as my old shaver. Nothing amazing about this shaver but not bad either.</li>
    <li> shaves good-only thing I don&#x27;t like is that if you use the cord-it takes away from the battery charge-WHY WOULD THEY MAKE IT THAT WAY???? IT SHOULD CONSERVE THE BATTERY</li>
    <li> I bought this razor for my husband and he seems to like it.It&#x27;s a great price, size and travels well.</li>
    <li> Had it for about 3 months. it works great.</li>
    <li> I gave this to my husband, as his old one was breaking down (after years of usage). He said it doesn&#x27;t have a lot of power and doesn&#x27;t give him the close shave he desired. The other thing is that he can&#x27;t clean it on water, just need to be dry brushed.</li>
    <li> Best shaver I&#x27;ve ever had in 50 years.  It works like a charm.</li>
    <li> Great for travel watch pricing its up and down like gasoline</li>
    <li> Am away from home for the summer and forgot to bring the cable for my regular Norelco Cordless. So I went to Amazon and found this basic razor to cover me for the rest of the summer.  It doesn&#x27;t have any frills, but it does the job intended -- and does it very well!  Now I have a travelling razor that will beBasic with my on all trips from now on.</li>
    <li> The Norelco 6948XL definitely gives a good shave compared to other electric razors I&#x27;ve used. The only thing better is shaving with one of the modern multi-blade razor systems. I&#x27;ve had no problem having a decent appearance all day long. The 5 o&#x27;clock shadow is definitely delayed until well after I&#x27;m home from work. The shaver works quietly and surprisingly quickly. The trimmer on the back works, but is a bit awkwardly positioned.  When travelling, the charge lasts for a week or more, which is all one needs for most trips. All in all an excellent shaver at a very good price. It would be interesting to compare this with Norelco&#x27;s more expensive models, but I am not sure the shave could get any better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve now used the shaver for a while. Bottom line: the Norelco shaves quietly and reasonably close to the skin. The shave lasts about half a day before feeling noticeably rough. Compared to a modern 5-blade razor (Schick or Gillette), the results are inferior. If you are in a rush, the Norelco gives a quick shave that can be touched up in the evening, if desired.</li>
    <li> Very pleased.  Works as described.  Gives a very close shave--you just need to get familiar with shaving with it.</li>
    <li> Hubby likes the new razor. His old one was not keeping a charge and was quite used. This was a Father&#x27;s Day present to him from me, his wife.</li>
    <li> seems ok for the cost..good value</li>
    <li> this shaver works better in my opinion that the more expensive models. it is no frills, but works like its supposed it for a truly quick shave.</li>
    <li> Sometimes, when you buy something, you just want a solid, durable and reliable product that does the job it supposed to. Many gimmicky products that saturate the market nowadays are just that gimmicky, flashes in the pan that will be swiftly taken off of store shelves for warehouses and discount retailers.&lt;br /&gt;Enter the Philips Norelco 6948XL/41 Rechargeable Cordless Razor. It&#x27;s a bad ass.  It shaves with authority and does it quietly and most important - closely.  All of this without razor burns and snags.  This shaver is the most solid shaver I&#x27;ve used in YEARS! Almost ever!&lt;br /&gt;It would have been nice if you could wet shave with this but eh. I&#x27;m very pleased with this the way it is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly reccommended!</li>
    <li> Shaves close and smooth even on the neck area. Lighter weight than my older Norelco. Great razor for the price.</li>
    <li> My husband busted it out of the box almost instantly and he loves it so far. His only complaint is that it takes him a littlle longer to shave but he said it was worth it for how smooth the shave is.</li>
    <li> Great razor for the price</li>
    <li> Works great, just like all the Norelco Razors  my husband has had.</li>
    <li> Perfect replacement for its more expensive older brother.  Shaves cleanly and quickly.  Batteries hold their charge nearly forever.  A fine product.  A+++</li>
    <li> I used to have Norelco razors a while ago. Got this one mainly for the price and it works very good. I only use it if my face if perfectly dry without any moist spots, gives a nice shave but obviously will never be as close as a good shave. Great razor and great price.</li>
    <li> This was a gift for my husband&#x27;s birthday (it was on his wish list).&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s the 2nd Norelco I&#x27;ve bought in over 30 years of marriage so they last!</li>
    <li> This was a gift for my teen son and is his first electric razor.  He likes it and it does give him a smooth shave.  He&#x27;s had no issues with charging or keeping/holding a charge and has nothing but good things to say about it.  This is a dry shaver and it has not caused any breakouts or anything.  SUPER fast shipping.  Would recommend shaver and seller.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t give as close of a shave as I would like, but for the price it works well. It has kind of a fat design but isn&#x27;t uncomfortable to hold. The trimmer feature doesn&#x27;t work very well, so if thats important to you, do not buy this razor.</li>
    <li> It does everything I want.  Gets a close shave, the beard and mustache trimmer works well and the battery life is excellent so far.  I&#x27;ve had it for 3 weeks and only had to charge it once with daily use.</li>
    <li> Works well, good shave, holds a charge for a few days. Price is right, if it breaks, throw away and buy another.</li>
    <li> Had to return they sent replacement it was nice of them and new one works fine different model so I am happy</li>
    <li> It was time to replace the heads on my Norelco razor.  Replacement HQ8 heads are listed between $17.99 to $29.99.  Prime made this razor available for $24.95.  A new warrantied razor for the cost of replacement heads.  Heck of a deal.  I&#x27;m a staunch Norelco user and am very pleased with this razor.  I recommend it for anyone looking for a dependable, inexpensive razor.  The only draw back, compared to my earlier Norelco&#x27;s is that the unit is for dry use only.</li>
    <li> buy this razor. What a total waste of money. This thing is inconsistent and completely uneven with the amount of hair it trims. There&#x27;s not much else I can say about this, I just hope you read this review before you buy it. Very unsatisfied :-(</li>
    <li> USE VERY EASY,FEEL VERY GOOD！IT IS MY BEST GIFT! I LIKE IT VERY MUCH! I CAN USE IT 1 YEAR!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Philips Norelco cordless razors for a while, including most recently the 7810XL, which is still a fairly expensive razor (eighty dollars plus).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This one, the 6948, is obviously in a lower class, but for thirty dollars, I don&#x27;t see how you could possibly do any better. It has a \\&quot;cheap\\&quot; feel - it&#x27;s very light and the plastic just feels insubstantial - but it performs very well for the price. I&#x27;ve used other \\&quot;budget\\&quot; razors and they can be very inconsistent. This is a great budget razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A couple of notes - the heads are flatter than the other Norelcos I&#x27;m used to, which means it gives a great shave on flatter areas like cheekbones, but it&#x27;s a little tougher to get close on more rounded areas such as the jawbone. On the plus side, after charging it fully, I&#x27;ve used it for over 2 weeks and have not had to recharge it yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think if you can afford a better razor you&#x27;re probably better off getting the best one you can afford...but if you&#x27;re on a tight budget and you need an electric razor, I would highly recommend this one.</li>
    <li> This review is from my husband&#x27;s experience, not mine. Obviously, as a woman, I&#x27;m not the target market. I usually buy my husband Norelco electric shavers. He doesn&#x27;t care for disposable razors. He was faintly impressed with this razor, considering he usually balks at anything less than $50.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What he likes:&lt;br /&gt;-gives a decent shave&lt;br /&gt;-rechargeable and can be used plugged in&lt;br /&gt;-fairly easy to clean with the supplied brush&lt;br /&gt;-it&#x27;s light, so good for traveling&lt;br /&gt;-price (okay, that&#x27;s my like)&lt;br /&gt;-holds a long charge (about 6 or 7 shaves per charge)&lt;br /&gt;-heads are a little flatter than some, helps with a close shave&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What he doesn&#x27;t like:&lt;br /&gt;-can&#x27;t rinse the razor with water&lt;br /&gt;-no indicator to tell you if it&#x27;s fully charged. It&#x27;s pretty much green light, you have power and dead, you have no power.&lt;br /&gt;-can get a little tricky in hard to reach places like under the nose due to flatter heads&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, you can&#x27;t go wrong for the price. Very nice entry level or travel razor.</li>
    <li> This shaver was such a hit with my husband that I bought a second one for my son.  Both love it for simplicity to use and a close shave.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s slower then my last shaver but it works.</li>
    <li> works good. i dont have an over abundance of facial hair tho.</li>
    <li> My husband was having trouble with razor burn with his old safety razors.  It was painful and quite unsightly.  We researched electric razors and ordered this Philips Norelco because of the favorable reviews and the reasonable price.  He&#x27;s thrilled with the results.</li>
    <li> My old shaver is a Norelco model 5625x, about 15 years old.  It would no longer hold a charge.  I ordered this new model 6948XL as a replacement, hoping that it would serve as well as my old one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It turns out that 6948XL is much improved.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s less expensive, quieter, gentler, faster, and closer than my old shaver.  So quiet that at first I thought it wasn&#x27;t working.  No need to press against skin and get a bit of a rash.  I can&#x27;t see stubble that well, but surprisingly soon I can feel with my other hand that I&#x27;m finished.  All my life I&#x27;ve kept a Gillette razor for when I wanted a really close shave.  Bye-bye Gillette!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have one suggestion for improvement.  This shaver still has that got-ya for when you clean the heads and their housings.  Don&#x27;t mix them up because odds are 6 to 1 against pairing them as they were.  And yes, sooner or later I will drop them all in the sink.  Worldwide, I&#x27;ll bet that happens at least a million times a year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I marked one pair with a black Sharpie, another pair with a dab of red nail polish, and no mark on the third pair.  My suggestion is that Norelco color code the heads and housings when they put them together at the factory.</li>
    <li> Very Good. 5 star service!!!</li>
    <li> Fits IPhone 6,but not my IPhone 4S</li>
    <li> It is nice and cost effective.</li>
    <li> Very very good shaver</li>
    <li> Runs very slow and is the cheapest quality electric razor I have ever owned.</li>
    <li> For the price, it is the best Norelco I have owned and I have owned and used Norelco razors  for over 45 years.  The shave is very close and not too irritating to the skin .  I have owned more expensive Norelcos; however, you can&#x27;t beat this razor for a reasonable shave at a more than reasonable price,</li>
    <li> Goes for a long time without running down. Really easy to clean, and the beard trimmer is great for trimming the back of my neck.</li>
    <li> Super nice, clean, smooth shave!</li>
    <li> If you liked the Norelco razors from the 80&#x27;s and 90&#x27;s, you&#x27;ll like this one. Nice simple razor! It has the old single blade cutters. Not the lift and cut blades that do nothing but trap skin, hair, and dirt and are difficult to clean. It takes a bit long to charge but it holds a charge that has been lasting me a month. The price is good. The cord is the old type. Transformer is built into the razor like they used to be. It says not to clean under water, but I do remover the head and rinse it under water. I have done this many times with no problems. The body is not sealed so it can not be rinsed. I use the brush and it is very easy to clean.</li>
    <li> Working fine after about 2 months. Holds charge well. Easy to clean. Quiet, sharp. If I&#x27;m careful I can even do nose hairs.</li>
    <li> This shaver does exactly what I wanted it to: no more, no less.  I base my rating on my personal expectations rather than comparisons to a different unit, as I have been a lifetime razor user.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s more convenient than lathering up, scraping my face and cleaning up afterwards.  After learning some nuances of its use, it delivers a close shave and does not pull or pinch.  I am less impressed with the trimmer, which I can compare to my Wahl Peanut commonly used by professionals, but that alone costs more than the Norelco.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note that I do not have a particularly heavy beard, so some may find they need a more robust unit.  Construction quality is &amp;#34;light&amp;#34;, but I have not encountered any problems so far.  If you&#x27;re looking for better feel or fit and finish, I suspect you could find them in a more expensive model as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To put things in perspective, my watch collection includes timepieces from both Rolex and Invicta; both meet my expectations and would each get 5 Stars.</li>
    <li> I have always liked Norelco products ant this razor meet all of my expections.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this razor to all of my friends.</li>
    <li> Shaves smoothly. This is my first electric shaver. The biggest problem I had was that always I cut my self when I shaves. This solved that problem for me. Its quiet and gives a close smooth shave which I love.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But its good to have some indication to battery status. Other than that I love this.</li>
    <li> Several people had mentioned how &amp;#34;quiet&amp;#34; this razor is... and in my case, I can see why it&#x27;s so quiet... because it only operates at about half the power/speed of the razors that I&#x27;ve been using for years. Even with a full charge AND with it plugged directly into an outlet, it refuses to cut even the most minor stubble efficiently. The 3 rotating razor heads keep getting caught in a days worth of stubble (which shouldn&#x27;t happen) and the &amp;#34;beard/mustache&amp;#34; trimmer does the same thing... it keeps snagging my hairs. If I wanted my hairs ripped out I would use tweezers, lol. I can tell that if it operated at higher revolutions per second that it would cut the way that it&#x27;s supposed to.. but that&#x27;s not the case. It&#x27;s possible that I have a defective unit, but I sort of doubt it. I am quite disappointed though, that I&#x27;m going to have to return this after it had so many positive reviews.. is what it is I suppose.</li>
    <li> I originally purchased this item less than a year ago.  It doe an adequate job and was cheap.  I guess it is also cheaply made since it broke after less than a year. Even though it is still under warranty, it is cheaper and less hassle just to buy a new one.</li>
    <li> Good razor.... Very light weight</li>
    <li> best razor I have ever owned.  I have used an electric razor for the last sixty three years as I am 83 years young.</li>
    <li> Summary: this razor is the best of its kind I&#x27;ve ever owned (and I&#x27;m an old man).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Purchased the Philips Norelco 6948XL/41 to replace a Remington F-3790 that had become dull and ineffective. For the cost of replacement parts, refurbishing the Remington seemed a bad idea. In hindsight, that was a good decision. The new Norelco outperforms the Remington in every way I can think of. The Norelco is so quiet, you might think the battery isn&#x27;t charged. The Norelco is also nearly free of vibration (while the Remington felt more like a paint shaker and sounded like a chain saw). So how&#x27;s the shave? The closest and most comfortable I can remember from an electric razor - and I&#x27;ve been using them for over 20 years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Remington missed hairs, even when it was new. I&#x27;ve used the Norelco for 3+ weeks, and have yet to find a stray hair it didn&#x27;t cut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, when the Remington battery ran completely down, you had to wait for it to partially recharge (at least 30 minutes) before you could finish shaving. It wouldn&#x27;t shave at all with a dead battery, even when plugged in. With the Norelco, you can run down the battery, then finish shaving with it plugged in, and then let it fully recharge while at work. Nice.</li>
    <li> Bought it with a coupon. Quiet good product and convenient to use.Philips always produce good products. All is good except not washable.</li>
    <li> This is my first rotary shaver so I decided to buy this one because of cost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I normally use gillette but got this for my head simply of razor bumps starting to pop up more frequently.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am pleased with this product.  It works great, easy to clean and the grip is comfortable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You will notice when you receive this product the motor sounds a little weak but for $30 what can you expect.  However, contrary to that it gives a good clean shave.  Totally impressed by this for the cost!</li>
    <li> I really like this razor.  I will not pay what to me are outrageous prices for electric rotary razor.  The $29.00 cost is well worth it.</li>
    <li> Quiet and effective. Great.</li>
    <li> my husband likes it just fine.</li>
    <li> If only you could get the cap on after cleaning it. You try and try turning it every way andfinally when you have had it it goes on.</li>
    <li> So glad we bought these because it is great quality and so much cheaper</li>
    <li> Very pleased with the shaver, my husband is enjoying it.</li>
    <li> I use this on my legs. While it doesn&#x27;t get as close as a razor, I have zero razor burn and pretty smooth legs.</li>
    <li> Fore those of you, like me, who actually have a somewhat substantial number of hairs on your face. This e-razor really isn&#x27;t that great. It doesn&#x27;t snag, necessarily. I just doesn&#x27;t cut well. The follicaly dense areas of my face I have to go over several times just to get all the hairs. And even then it doesn&#x27;t feel clean. It has caused me a rash a few times. Does it work? Yes-ish? But unless you either thin facial hair or just not alot, this e-razor is not for you.</li>
    <li> Nothing fancy. But it shaves close.</li>
    <li> I have used this razor for two weeks and so far it performs quite well, It seems to hold a charge for the time Philips claims. I would buy it again!</li>
    <li> Good cut, very nice battery life, and a familiar, functional design make this a very good shaver. The one bad thing about it is that it doesn&#x27;t come with a carrying case, therefore, I had to save my old one. Come on, Norelco. Really?</li>
    <li> Truly disappointing. The motor is very, very slow and it takes more time to shave than with a razor. The shave itself is fairy good but nothing like my old Norelco. I should have read the reviews on this thing before I forked over the money. You do indeed get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> Product arrived right on time and it is ok for the price.</li>
    <li> This item arrived in great form.  Ready for Christmas.  Thank you.</li>
    <li> Close shaves and I like that when the battery goes dead in the middle of a shave, I can just plug in the cord and&lt;br /&gt;finish up. Something my last Norelco could not do.</li>
    <li> works pretty good, like the cheap price tag.</li>
    <li> The cleaning brush was not included.</li>
    <li> Great razor! Works really fine, the trimmer is excellent, very good to cut longer beard. Very good relation between price and quality</li>
    <li> I am very happy with this razor.  It cuts close, is comfortable and easy to use.  It has good battery life.</li>
    <li> cuts good, charged good, Its pretty good, i just like it for cheap price but not really a useless tool,</li>
    <li> I needed a new razor and went with a Norelco again. I didn&#x27;t need &#x27;fancy&#x27; and this one is just  what I wanted. It works great and haven&#x27;t had to charge it yet and have had it for almost a month.</li>
    <li> to heavy beards. I use this just for quick touch up of old gray beard in between regular straight razor shaves so it works for me at the price I paid. The motor is weak so it is not for shaving anything more than a light beard comfortably. Norelco has several shavers more expensive than this and if you need a good razor for a heavy beard, this isn&#x27;t it. It holds a charge ok, just not a powreful shaver.</li>
    <li> I was very disappointed in this razor. It tugs and pulls hair out while shaving. Weak powered motor makes the razor feel cheap and low quality. Even when fully charged, the results are less than acceptable. Would not recommend.</li>
    <li> easy to start using, charge time is acceptable.handling is comfortable, shaving is very smooth.one of the best used, would like to recommend.</li>
    <li> My beard is light and fine and this razor with the most aggressive blade now available in a rotary by Norelco takes more than twice as long than my old Norelco. Now looking at other brands.</li>
    <li> My husband has had two Norelco shavers before which gave him wonderful service, when the head assembly wore out we opted for a new one rather than put money into the old one.  We plugged it in to charge the battery as directed before use. It runs much slower than the old one,it sounds like the battery is low and doesn&#x27;t do nearly as good shaving as the old one did even though it is plugged in all the time.</li>
    <li> Excellent value but does not cut as close as a blade.  I would recommend to others and I would purchase again.</li>
    <li> This is the first time I have ever used an electric shaver. I absolutely love it! I am never going to go back to old disposable razors, and this didn&#x27;t even cost that much more. I had no idea what I was doing, and of course, I didn&#x27;t read the manual, and even still, not one single nick or pinch. The pop up trimmer is great for trimming longer hair.</li>
    <li> A very good product.  My husband had one for a long time until it finally gave out so wanted another.  He was very happy with it.</li>
    <li> Product not up to expectations.  Not as good as prior Norelco  Shavers purchased in the past.  Used shaver about 6-7 months then just quit.  No charge light.</li>
    <li> Works same as prior model made over the past 10 years.  One thing I did notice is the battery does not appear to last as long as prior models.  Not a big deal if you&#x27;re near AC.  Overall I&#x27;m satisfied.  Price is right.</li>
    <li> I had read reviews which recommended buying a man&#x27;s electric razor, claiming they were better made than women&#x27;s models.  This just didn&#x27;t work for me, and I returned it.  On the plus side, the return process went smoothly.</li>
    <li> Good product.  This is a replacement for my previous Norelco shaver.</li>
    <li> What I like about this razor:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Inexpensive price (at the time)&lt;br /&gt;- quieter than a foil razor (at least mine... a Panasonic ES4026)&lt;br /&gt;- can be used corded&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That last time.. corded use... It&#x27;s getting hard to find electrics that support both cordless &amp; corded.  It&#x27;s either wall wart or docking station.  I literally grew up with old Braun foils that used both and missed that when I moved to different manufactures.  Charge low?  No problem if I can find an outlet.</li>
    <li> Inexpensive and being used by my 95 year old Dad.  He is always dropping his shavers.</li>
    <li> Great shaver. Shaves nice and close and is very quiet. I don&#x27;t know the battery life at this time but so far so good.</li>
    <li> ordered this for my husband to replace the old norelco he had that died on him. he likes this new one just as good as the last one. great price at only $29 with free shipping!</li>
    <li> Not as close as a regular razor but good enough.</li>
    <li> This shaver surprised my husband. It works better then any he has had in the past.</li>
    <li> perfect!  works great!</li>
    <li> This shaver shaves at least as close as any other electric i&#x27;ve used. It feels a bit cheaper. It sounds a bit less powerful. It runs only half as long on a charge. Considering the price, though, its an incredible buy. Its very easy to use and clean. Havent tried the trimmer yet. Great buy for the money.</li>
    <li> Very satisfied with this purchase</li>
    <li> does better that I expected</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s basic. Works perfectly fine with no issues.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only reasons I won&#x27;t score 5/5 is I feel that the inner workings of mechanics will eventually break given there delicacy and being visible against the elements.</li>
    <li> used them for 50 years and its still great</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s almost all plastic, and can&#x27;t come into contact with water. Other than that, it&#x27;s fine- I&#x27;ve been using the Norelco &amp;#34;tri foil&amp;#34; design for 10-15 years</li>
    <li> I always have used a Norelco razor and this one is very quiet and has the handy battery operation. Good value.</li>
    <li> Working great so far.</li>
    <li> I have really thick hair on my legs and it feels rough when I shave but this electric razor is like magic on my legs! It leaves it nice and smooth and shiny. No prickly feeling finally!</li>
    <li> just got my new shaver. i&#x27;ve had many norelcos over the last 40 years. this is a basic model, but cuts just as well as my last one (the 007 model). i had been keeping my OO7 alive with blades from previous models for a number of years, but finally bit the bullet and get something new. got this basic model and can&#x27;t say it cuts any differently than the others. the replacement blades are around 22.00, which is less than the others. maybe i&#x27;ll get replacement blades in a couple of years...or may will just get another shaver like this one. i am not fussy and think this will serve me well (well enough). guess it is time to throw out the several other norelcos i have been saving and start fresh.</li>
    <li> Very practical. I can shave at home, traveling or on my way to work. Good shaving, although I need to shave everyday but I think what you have to do to avoid shaving with a razor that can irritate your skin. This shaver does not irritate your skin. Battery is powerful enough to last days.</li>
    <li> This is my first Norelco and besides cutting very well, it&#x27;s increditily&lt;br /&gt;quiet, so I&#x27;m a happy guy.  Good product!</li>
    <li> The product is very nice and handy. Easy to use and the blades are of good quality. It&#x27;s a great item for those who are always on the run. It gives you a great shaving comfort, even if you use it dry.&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend this product. Philips is really maintaining a quality in their Norelco brands.</li>
    <li> To be frank: I haven&#x27;t used it yet !  I  bought it &#x27;cause I thought my old Norelco was going bad.  That was a year ago or more ! and the old one is still going (like the bunny...).  If this is anything like the  &#x27;old&#x27; Norelco it&#x27;s a great shaver.</li>
    <li> This is a very nice electric razor. I really like the  trimmer. Never realized how much more fun it is to walk around the house while shaving. Eliminating the electric cord really eases up the chore.</li>
    <li> My husband loves this! Close shave and his skin doesn&#x27;t get irritated.</li>
    <li> Light weight and simple to use.</li>
    <li> Sleek design. Portable. Precise and close shave. My boyfriend loves it. His face is so soft and his goatee stays trimmed.</li>
    <li> I was disappointed in the quality of the razor.i have bought and used  norelco for  many years but this will be my last one&lt;br /&gt;The delivery time was good the price reasonable .maybe charge a bit more p and improve quality</li>
    <li> If you want the electric shave that made Norelco famous, here it is!  Excellent close shave, self-sharpening blades, easy to clean - - and affordable!  I can&#x27;t imagine how a $150 Norelco would be much better as far as shave quality or performance.  I don&#x27;t have the money to spend on cutting-edge looks, and can&#x27;t envision why anyone would use an electric shaver in the shower anyway.  If you want a wet shave, get a razor and a mirror!  However, if you prefer to sit in your easy chair, cold beverage at hand, TV remote nearby, and shave at the same time, this quiet little machine is your answer.  Need I say more?  Just buy it.</li>
    <li> For the price, this shaver works great.  Quick, easy way to clean up afternoon shadow.</li>
    <li> Did not give my husband a good shaving experience.  He always used Norelco but this particular model didn&#x27;t fill his expections.</li>
    <li> This rotary shaver is the best bang for your buck that I have seen.  I have a heavy beard: it shaves nicely, and I have charged it only once in one month and have used it daily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cleaning is easy: I have disassembled it once and cleaned the heads with alcohol, and blow out hair every two days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is quite a bargain--and shaves as well as models costing 5x the price.</li>
    <li> Well made and easy to use!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m really pleased with it!</li>
    <li> This razor is SO much better than the Norelco that we originally bought and paid $109 for it.It gives a much closer shave!</li>
    <li> I am a girl and I shave my legs with this!!! Why hasn&#x27;t anyone mentioned that before? No more ingrown hairs, no more needing to shower before I wear a dress, no cuts like from those aluminum electric razors.</li>
    <li> It shaves a lot more closely than other electric razors I&#x27;ve used. Just make sure to keep it fully charged; without full power it will be more difficult to use. The only downside is the blades get dull fairly quickly.</li>
    <li> An option of gift to men.</li>
    <li> The motor runs too slowly.  Takes a long time to shave.  Also, it has a cheap feel to it.  I am returning it for a refund.  I advise not to buy unless you are okay with low quality, and extended shaving time.</li>
    <li> Helps a lot , gets me a close smooth shave</li>
    <li> Cuts really well but does not have the features of the more expensive models.</li>
    <li> My husband needed an electric razor after having a stroke. This one works OK, but he has to shave daily with it, where with a straight razor, he would go 2 or 3 days.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my Dad who is in an assisted living facility in another state. My husband recommended this brand, and my Dad seems very happy with it.</li>
    <li> OK, folks, the Five Stars have been earned.  Practically from the get go I had not been too happy with my current Remington electric shaver, meaning to get the close shave I expected I had to re-shave the area over and over again, at times developing a reddish, itchy rash to go with it. And replacing the original blades after using the new shaver for just 90 days did not remedy anything, either.  The shaver just kept refusing to provide me with a close shave unless I ended up with skin irritation, let alone provide me with a comfortable shave when I had more than a two day&#x27;s growth.  It wasn&#x27;t until a co-worker mentioned how happy he had been with his Norelco 6948XL shaver that I felt it was time to try something else, so I went ahead and ordered the shaver from Amazon.  Enter the Norelco shaver and all want to say is: Wow!!!  I just don&#x27;t know what else I can say about this shaver.  Even though I just got it, let me count the ways I just started &amp;#34;to love thee,&amp;#34; Norelco;  a) Quiet as a mouse instead of the &amp;#34;lawn mower&amp;#34; Remington I had. b) About as close a shave as anyone could possibly expect - AND if a second or third re-shave of the area is needed, the razor goes over my skin smooth as silk - NO itchy reddish rashes!!  People, I 100% agree with some of the reviews about this razor.  Highly recommended as far as I am concerned.</li>
    <li> Had to replace my old Norelco and this one is so much smoother. I really love it and I couldn&#x27;t live without it. I want another one for my car for emergencies.</li>
    <li> Im not very happy with it.  Doesn&#x27;t give me a close shave &amp; the battery lasts for 1 shave...not good :(</li>
    <li> I bought it for my husband, he has not complained yet. . . Which definitely says a lot. Not bad for price.</li>
    <li> So far.  Ask me in three years.</li>
    <li> When my previous shaver needed new heads, I priced them and discovered I could buy this shaver for just a little more. This shaver gives me a good shave and the battery lasts a long time between charges. Oh, yes - the head design makes for a very comfortable shave under my chin.</li>
    <li> Works fine, similar to other Norelco&#x27;s I have owned</li>
    <li> My husband says it works ok but he will probably upgrade it soon!</li>
    <li> Very good!&lt;br /&gt;I like it very much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks.</li>
    <li> I condemn the idea of ever using a razor again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t hurt my skin when I want to just attack the short rough hair on my face after a day or two.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not the best for attacking thicker beards, but for touching up; I wish I had this long ago&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love it ten&#x27; outta ten</li>
    <li> Not quite as close of a shave as a razor, but when one cannot a good alternative. I take it with me to the gym and it makes a nice touch up after the work out when your hand is not quite as steady as it could be.</li>
    <li> My previous Norelco shaver was about 7-8 years old and not doing a good job shaving. At one time I replaced a new shaving head on the old model. A results were better, however not quality the same, so I decided to purchase a new model. Replacement heads are still less expensive then purchasing a new model, but with the age of the shaver I felt a new replacement shaver was needed. I am very happy with this new shaver.</li>
    <li> You just can&#x27;t get out to the street after shaving with this haha, the shaving is not completely homogeneous, there&#x27;s always some nasty hairs that got away from the razor, and so you still NEED a final cut with a real razor after using it</li>
    <li> This product is excellent!</li>
    <li> It is quiet, smooth and efficient which adds up to a delightful morning pleasure.</li>
    <li> It was everything I wanted in a razor.</li>
    <li> Having owned several Norelco shavers since my college days, I expected quality when I purchased this one, and&lt;br /&gt;it delivered nicely for the price.&lt;br /&gt;The shaving comfort is tolerable on dry skin and it produced a remarkably close cut. The battery seemed to&lt;br /&gt;go about four shaves for me until the rotors ran too slowly to cut very well. The unit will operate with the cord&lt;br /&gt;attached, but its length made it difficult (too short).&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking for a nice shave without spending a bundle, the 6948XL/41 will do it!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband. he likes how easy it is to use. His only compaint is that it doesnt get as close as a razor and that it gives him a razor burn if he uses it on his neck. Overall it does the job, and is great for touch up in between shaves with a razor.</li>
    <li> Got them as gift to give away. I don&#x27;t know if it functions ok but I served it&#x27;s intended purpose. I did not get it back so it must be okay product</li>
    <li> quiet and very effective.  Husband loves it.  Shaves in a 3rd of the time of his old tired Phillips.  They last about a year.  still cheaper than the old blade and razor.</li>
    <li> this norelco shaver is great.</li>
    <li> It was a gift for my sweetheart so I haven&#x27;t heard from him about the product.  I can say that it was nicely packaged and I was proud to give it.  Price point was good.</li>
    <li> Great product. Excellent way to get into this kind of razor. It has a learning curve, so don&#x27;t expect your first time to be perfect. Also, if you get irritated at the beginning don&#x27;t give up, the manual itself says your face need a couple days to get used To it. I would recommend it.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a norelco. take care of it and it&#x27;ll take care of you. DO NOT drop ANYTHING when cleaning. Tolerances are tight enough that you will start to efff things up! Even at that, replacement blades are very reasonably priced.</li>
    <li> Great price, great product</li>
    <li> This shaver is great!  The result is better than I expected. This is the third type of shave I have used in my life and this is the best. The convenience of using it unplugged is also a surprise advantage. I purchased the Norelco because I trusted the quality and it has come through with flying colors. Thanks.</li>
    <li> good shaver, it is typical.</li>
    <li> My expensive Norelco lasted less than one year before the battery died, so I decided to try a cheap one. It works, kind of rumbles along and I do get a good shave, it&#x27;s just cheap. Charge does not last very many days and it definitely operates at a much lower RPM</li>
    <li> Product received approx. 8/15/2014.  I don&#x27;t use this every day but use this electric as a supplement to the daily razor I use. It&#x27;s light and works well in the approx. 6 times I used it. So far the battery was only charged once and still good.  For an inexpensive razor it seems to be a good choice. If I used an electric razor everyday I would buy a better model.    11/12/2014- still works well. I haven&#x27;t had to recharge it yet but mine gets very light use.</li>
    <li> This is much better than my $140 Panasonic shaver</li>
    <li> Works great. I clean shave everyday for work and it does a number on your skin after a while. This razor gives a close shave without irritation and does not dry out your skin.</li>
    <li> Quality is not up to standard for Norelco.</li>
    <li> A good shaver at a good price.</li>
    <li> My son like it but he said the only thing is you have to use it dry.</li>
    <li> Excellent for the price.  Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> very useful when you don&#x27;t want the  scraping of a razor</li>
    <li> I wanted the trim feature not available on my prior model.  Has more battery time and blade replacement cost is more in line with what would be considered reasonable</li>
    <li> This may be an older razor but newer razors don&#x27;t seem to be as comfortable as this one, get this one it&#x27;s cheap and it works</li>
    <li> so far so good. exactly as I ordered. works perfectly!</li>
    <li> well my bf loves it , what can i say hehe so guys i think it is good i am a girl myself idk</li>
    <li> i use it mainly around the outside of my ears for unwanted hair. works perfect. i have used it to shave and it does remarkably well. can&#x27;t use it all the time because of my other facial hair. it will not edge close enough. if i don&#x27;t shave for a coupla days, it works well for taking off the rough beard before i use my razor. definitely a good product so far for the price.</li>
    <li> Works great, don&#x27;t bother spending more for a more expensive one. This is all you will need. Great quality for the cost.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve owned four of Norelco models in the last few years. Norelco really cut corners with this model; power cord is very short and the battery within the shaver jiggles as you shave. All in all, it is not worth the money. Should spend a few more dollars getting either other brands or upgraded models.</li>
    <li> Electric razors are great.  But every 6 months you need new blades.  This great razor actually cost less then the blades alone when is on sale.  And you end up with newer batteries that last longer.  Great deal.</li>
    <li> I am getting old enough that I am forever nicking myself with even a safety razor.  So...I bought this hoping it would do a good enough job.  I was very impressed!  It does a great job with no muss and no fuss!!  Wish I had bought it sooner!!</li>
    <li> Unfortunately I thought this was a wet and dry razor and when you couldn&#x27;t even rinse it it wasn&#x27;t for me</li>
    <li> Easy to use, easy to clean, very quiet, gives a nice close shave. Have used it for about a month without any problems.</li>
    <li> Husband has been using for a while now and it works fine for the price</li>
    <li> It is very sharp and very quite. I love it very much</li>
    <li> looks very good, price is cheap.  I really like Amazon&#x27;s delivery speed as it is very quickly.</li>
    <li> For a cheap, entry-level razor it gets the job done.</li>
    <li> I have only used the flip-up trimmer on the reverse but it did exactly what I wanted and needed it to do. Item was already charged and ready to use.</li>
    <li> its so good just it have&#x27;t anti water design is not comfortable to clean it</li>
    <li> As good as electric shavers get.</li>
    <li> Not the softest shave.  Felt sharp and irritating to my face.  Shave is OK, so keeping the shaver, for now.</li>
    <li> Does the job. Holds a charge. Basic, few frills (except for trimmer, which works well). Very reasonable price for a solid electric razor. What more do you needed? But I&#x27;m a Timex kind of guy, not a Rolex guy.</li>
    <li> Mi paquete c perdio al llegar a venezuela no pude usarlo</li>
    <li> the razor is well constructed and works fine.However the cord is too short. It has to be stretched to it&#x27;s maximum before use.</li>
    <li> Since I first started shaving more than 40 years ago, I&#x27;ve always used an electric razor. My first shaver was a Norelco and it lasted close to 20 years. Since then, I&#x27;ve tried other brands, like Braun and Remington, but always end up going back to Norelco. Each Norelco razor I&#x27;ve owned has been built a little less solidly than the previous one, and has lasted for a shorter time. This Norelco 6948XL/41 razor is a good value for its price. It gives a smooth, comfortable shave every time. Few electric razors at this price include a pop-up trimmer as this one does. Recharging it once a week seems to work well; going beyond a week between charges, the razor doesn&#x27;t work quite as efficiently. While the motor itself isn&#x27;t especially noisy, the battery case inside the shaver clunks around a bit during use-- not a problem, but it does give the impression of lower quality construction. Spending more money might get you a sturdier or fancier shaver, but this one does a good job at a reasonable price.</li>
    <li> Cuts most whiskers.  Nothing like a blade.</li>
    <li> Basic, but adequate. And it was just $29.95!</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s a great shaver at a great price!  Each charge last forever, easy to use very functional. I recommend this product to anyonethat wants a close shave at a good price!</li>
    <li> I am a return customer for this type and brand of shaver.  It may be a good idea to change the cutting heads every year or so but the price of them makes it more sense to just buy another shaver.  I have to take the head apart to clean it after every other shaving or it seems like it doesn&#x27;t cut quite as fast or as good..</li>
    <li> Years back I had one similar to this (Phili-Shave) and produced a smooth shave probably because my beard was soft then. I was apprehensive that with my beard hard with age the results would be not so good. Amazingly I was mistaken.</li>
    <li> doesn&#x27;t shave real close</li>
    <li> The shaver is doing well in its first two weeks. It is giving a close shave without the shaver burn..</li>
    <li> Great shave every time</li>
    <li> Great easy to use simple shaver.</li>
    <li> A head that falls off when you open it? No flashing light when recharging or recharged? This item is a step backward from previous models. I realize that P-N wants me to spend $50+ for a shaver. But I think $35 is more than enough.</li>
    <li> Great razor for the money.</li>
    <li> After being fully charged the shaver gave me a very close shave. It is small, comfortable to hold and follows the contour of my face very well. The only downside is that only the removable heads are washable but this is known ahead of time if one reads the description before ordering.</li>
    <li> I wish I would have spent more to get a better quality. It&#x27;s not bad, but the razors went dull within 3 months of not a lot of use. The battery doesn&#x27;t last long, it&#x27;s usually plugged in while using it.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a gift for my dad, so he wouldn&#x27;t keep cutting himself with a blade razor.  He loves it and says it shaves very close.</li>
    <li> Excellent!  Read directions before starting. Works very well</li>
    <li> Awesome product. Very good quality and performance. I wish it had a battery stand charger too to make it easier to charger.</li>
    <li> Purchased as a gift form my teenage soon, it seemed like a good starter shaver for the price.  So far it works well for him.  I like that he can use it plugged in or wireless.</li>
    <li> Working fine, worth for price.</li>
    <li> This shaver is great. It delivers a good close shave with no irritation. I was a foil razor user for years but I grew tired of the foils developing holes.</li>
    <li> This shaver was the first out of the box kosher shaver in years as it does away with the Lift &amp; Cut technology in favor of a more basic cutting technology. In 2012 this shaver was below $29 and then went up to $39 but now in this new 2100 model and with the no frills packaging the price is back down again. Yeah.</li>
    <li> This razor is great. My husband has very sensitive skin and is on oxygen 24/7 and this razor is doing a great job with out irritating his skin. The price was really great and that is another reason we bought it. I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I hate that Norelco doesn&#x27;t sell replacement batteries and discontinues shaving heads after a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My previous model was working fine, but the battery wouldn&#x27;t recharge and even the corded operation started being a problem because it first charges the battery (which is just about dead) and the battery powers the heads. This model is just the same, so I know I&#x27;ll have to replace it eventually, even if none of the parts actually break.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Plus, they stopped making the shaving heads for my previous model and I know they will eventually discontinue them for this one too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this one thinking it would be just like the previous model.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In many ways it&#x27;s similar to the previous model, but it feels like the motor is less powerful or somehow just spins slower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, not a bad shaver for the price, but the tricks the manufacturer plays feel cheap to me. Make your money on the blades, not on people having to buy a new device every so often.</li>
    <li> Blades do not seem as sharp jor cut as well as the last new rotary I had</li>
    <li> Excellent!  Time-tested product at good price and with all the features i was looking for.  Would buy again for sure.</li>
    <li> Works well at a great price.</li>
    <li> got this for my grandson for his birthday he says he loves it no more razors.Or using hes brothers anymore.</li>
    <li> The giftee hasn&#x27;t given me much feedback other than it is operational. I didn&#x27;t expect much more, as he&#x27;s a man of few words. (That last part pleases his wife.)</li>
    <li> its alright but definitely consider a higher end model, i ended up just storing this one in the car for a travel razor&lt;br /&gt;the 7310 holds blade rpms more consistently as the battery drains.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t use it every day but it does what I need it to do.  I get lazy on weekends and won&#x27;t shave until Monday.  I can&#x27;t use a blade by then but this will do the job. It won&#x27;t get as close as a blade but no electric can.</li>
    <li> This is the second time I&#x27;ve bought this particular product, and it is my favorite of others I&#x27;ve tried over the years.</li>
    <li> unit wasn&#x27;t up to my quality expectations!</li>
    <li> Good. Really quiet. Holds up charge well. So far so good. I recommend it.</li>
    <li> My husband loves it no complaints but previously we had a Remington for the same price and it shaved a little faster than this one.</li>
    <li> I was really surprised that the product was this good at this low of a price. It definitely exceeded my expectations&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mike</li>
    <li> close but comfortable shave great value</li>
    <li> As expected, Norelco quality rules.</li>
    <li> Won&#x27;t shaves well and hurts a little bit.</li>
    <li> This is my first electric razor and I love it! Close shave, no razor burn or rashes, super quiet and seems to be well made. I definitely recommend this product. I&#x27;ve had for a few weeks and use it every other day.</li>
    <li> it woks well , make me loving shaving</li>
    <li> My third Norelco shaver. Worst one. Acts like it has no power. Terrible shave. Loved the other two shavers and had them for years. Have given this shaver several months but it now sits in a drawer and I shave with a razor. Won&#x27;t buy Norelco again. Would give 0 if possible.</li>
    <li> Nice shaver with high quality. It is totally clean-cut and better than what i bought before.</li>
    <li> No problems, price is right.</li>
    <li> My dad said that he loves it.  IT shaves well.</li>
    <li> Very good dry cut shaver. light weight and quiet. I liked my last one which was a Remington but this one beats it hands down...and at a great price. I paid $25.</li>
    <li> We could not keep it working. You sent us a replacement and it too only worked for a week..&lt;br /&gt;We will not get another, we do not want another.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you anyway.&lt;br /&gt;Lynn</li>
    <li> shaves hair as if it was its last. it also outlasts that of other shavers.</li>
    <li> Very pleased with this product, so far.  It is very lightweight and feels like it is cheaply made, but it has worked fine the short time I have had it.  Received in a timely manner.  No hassles.  Thanks</li>
    <li> I received another kind of razor for Christmas 2 years ago and had forgotten how good a shave you get with a triple header razor.  I will never buy anything except a phillips triple header razor.</li>
    <li> Excellent electric razor. Gets the job done.</li>
    <li> I ordered this because I liked the ideas of the three blades better than my Panasonic one blade. I thought it was going to be great. It was ok, I really should give it three stars. I do have pretty thick hair, but not thick enough to where an electric razor won&#x27;t cut.  With this razor I am going over the same spots four or five times. And its not very smooth after.&lt;br /&gt;But this razor is very quiet, I can shave while the hubby sleeps in the morning and it doesn&#x27;t wake him. It also holds a very good charge compared to the last one I had. Its not terrible, but its not an A+. My hunt is still on!</li>
    <li> I bought it for my boyfriend and the first time he tried to use it his beard was too big so the razor was hurting him. We figured out that he should trim it first and then use the razor.</li>
    <li> Works great but the battery doesn&#x27;t last very long, the nice thing is that you can use it while it is plugged in.</li>
    <li> This is an inexpensive shaver to replace one I&#x27;ve been using a couple of decades now.  It arrived on time, and in perfect condition.  I&#x27;ve used it daily since its arrival and have no complaints at all.  Lasts quite a while on a single charge.  This is not one you can clean under the tap - so don&#x27;t use water on it.  It came with a cleaning brush, charging cable, and plastic protector cap.</li>
    <li> Great razor for the price, been using this for a month now and it&#x27;s still working wonderful. Would buy again</li>
    <li> Was a Christmas gift to someone else. They liked it.</li>
    <li> works terrific. i love it!</li>
    <li> Another Christmas gift for my husband and he has really been pleased. It gives him that whole extra 5 minutes to sleep in:) Close smooth shave and very quiet. Give it an A+.</li>
    <li> Was a gift. They love it.</li>
    <li> did not accept charge</li>
    <li> After 60 days and not using this shaver everyday the &#x27;head&#x27; broke.  Only one blade moves- two don&#x27;t.  Lightweight and quiet but quality is terrible in my book. Trying to find warranty info- think it was 45 days. ps blade head price is near the shaver cost</li>
    <li> a piece of crap  -don&#x27;t waste your money on this  turkey</li>
    <li> It works very well. My third in a row. I have a curly beard that is hard to cut with conventional shavers. I left my last one in a hotel room and that was the reason I replaced it. The battery life is very good. The cutting heads work better than my last one, perhaps because it is newer. Two thing that keep it from being perfect. I was used to a hinged cutting head cover. This one I have to pull off and snap back on. A minor hassle. The other is the trimmer is manually extended and not spring loaded. It is not the product&#x27;s fault. I did not compare models carefully enough but had I known, I would have opted for a model above this one.</li>
    <li> I replaced my Braun 7 with the model.  It was cheaper than getting replacement blades for my Braun..  In fact I get a better, closer shave with this shaver.  It is cheaply made mostly of cardboard, so I clean it with a dry tooth brush after each shave.  When it stops giving me satisfactory shaves, I&#x27;ll just get another.</li>
    <li> Bought for husband, so far so good.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my hubby for Christmas. I had a hard time picking one because I didn&#x27;t want to spend a bunch of money on something that may not work for him but he loves it. Thinking about buying another one for his work.</li>
    <li> This was a gift for my husband to replace his old razor.  He LOVES this one.  It was a great purchase at a great price and has worked just as hoped and expected</li>
    <li> I love this little shaver! 1st one I&#x27;ve ever owned and it works great!!</li>
    <li> It works fine. Just what i expected.</li>
    <li> Been using for months now.  Very happy with it. Decently close shave. Battery seems to be lasting fine.  Trimmer seems average.  Good price!</li>
    <li> This was an excellent value for money. My son is relatively new to shaving and was much more comfortable with this then a flat blade razor. The battery life between chargings is quite long, and the razor head is very easy to clean.</li>
    <li> Worked very well from the get go.  After a couple months has lost a little sharpness from blades, it takes a little longer to get a close shave.  Overall, especially given the price, I&#x27;m happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> For the money it&#x27;s not bad, but as they say...&amp;#34;you get what you pay for.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> I have an expensive Norelco for home use, but bought this as an inexpensive travel shaver. For the price, it&#x27;s pretty impressive.  It&#x27;s not as comfy as my expensive Norelco, but it shaves quite well.  The battery is not Lithium, but the self discharge seems quite low, so it&#x27;s always ready to go between trips.  If it does discharge, it can be used while charging.  All in all, a heck of a value in shavers.</li>
    <li> It really doesn&#x27;t work, I have to pass the same area several times to make sure everything is trimmed, it also creates lots of irritation.</li>
    <li> I inherited my grandfather&#x27;s Norelco in 1974 and have been using them ever since.  They last a long time, cut great, blades easy to change, easy to clean.</li>
    <li> So far so good.  Shaves well.  Trimmer works well.  No problems.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this thing for about a week now, and I love it.  An important thing to note when reading reviews about shavers, razors, etc., is that everybody has different skin and hair types.  What works for one person may not work for another.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For me, this razor works. My skin isn&#x27;t rough and my beard hairs aren&#x27;t made of steel.  I read a couple 1-star reviews from people saying using this razor was like holding a weedwhacker to their face and I can happily say that this is far from the case.  It glides smoothly across my face, and like magic my facial hair disappears.  I don&#x27;t have any problem getting the &amp;#34;hard to reach places&amp;#34; around my jaw bones and under my neck, it works fine in those areas if I hold my skin taught and shave in gentle circles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used to shave with disposable razors, so this is the first electric shaver I&#x27;ve ever used.  It&#x27;s so easy to use, and so much faster than a razor!  The instructions say it may take up to three weeks for your skin to adjust but I can say that my skin has felt perfectly fine throughout the past week of use.  In fact my skin would get far more irritated using a razor as opposed to this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is a little inconvenient not having any sort of battery indicator other than a green light to show that its charging, but it&#x27;s simple enough to just charge it overnight when it starts to wind down.  The popup trimmer is pretty handy though, but I&#x27;ve only used it once.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since this is the first electric shaver I&#x27;ve ever used, and I&#x27;m a cheap college student, this thing is amazing to me.  It doesn&#x27;t feel cheap at all.  That being said, I&#x27;m sure there are nicer ones out there, but I can&#x27;t imagine how they could possibly be THAT much better than this because this one gives me a pretty damn close shave.  In some areas of my neck, particularly spots that were hard to get at with a razor, this shaver outperforms the razor.  In other areas, the razor did a better job. But overall, this thing cuts down shaving time by about 90%, and if it gives me a smooth enough shave for my girlfriend to be happy, then I&#x27;m happy.</li>
    <li> I actually have the 1100, which is the exact same thing. Only mine has a power cord no battery and no pop out trimmer. Same shaving heads though and it shaves awesome! I had some debate between this or a foil electric, and the rotary by far beats the foil. Very close shave, no missed hairs. Just pull your skin tight and it works great!</li>
    <li> Great quality and price.</li>
    <li> Just a low average Norelco razor, but that&#x27;s what I needed &amp; expected. No bells &amp; whistles at all. I use to shave my head and it works well for that.</li>
    <li> The razor works great but I think a blades are lacking quality</li>
    <li> Gave this to my son as a present.  He loves it.  Get the job done and fast. Great shaver!!</li>
    <li> This shaver is perfect for a stroke patient. The best part is no more cuts.</li>
    <li> I got this for my boyfriend as a present for his birthday and he loves it!!</li>
    <li> for a new razor it does not cut that close as my old norelco.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;also, there was no charger with the product.  does it need one?&lt;br /&gt;Jerry Barde&lt;br /&gt;Jergab@aol.com</li>
    <li> This shaver with the Close-Cut rortary heads is an engineering marvel.  It truly deserves the 5-star rating.  Think of a surgical instrument as a shaver.  No burn.</li>
    <li> My 6th or 8th Norelco ating back to the 1950&#x27;s.  They have all been good!</li>
    <li> love it. Great price......of course I only shave 1 day a week!! Yippee!</li>
    <li> A great razor--my husband still uses it</li>
    <li> This razor is adequate, but you get what you pay for. It is noisy and does not hold a charge as well as the more expensive models.&lt;br /&gt;If you are on a budget, it cuts well and the trimmer is convenient. It will serve you well.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s like a toy. not good quality. will not buy again</li>
    <li> I found this shaver very good.</li>
    <li> came on time good pouduct</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used electric shavers almost exclusively for decades now, mostly Norelco, and I have to say I feel this is the best electric shaver I&#x27;ve ever used. It shaves close and is very comfortable. Amazingly comfortable. What I&#x27;m shocked at is how low the price is for this shaver. I&#x27;ve paid much more over the years for shavers and they didn&#x27;t shave as close and comfortable as this one.</li>
    <li> I am completely satisfied with the razor. I buy a new basic Norelco every couple of years rather than replace the heads. This model was on sale and  I am back with a close shave again.</li>
    <li> I have used Norelco razors for several decades now.  They never disappoint.  Almost perfect design and it just works as expected - fast, easy shaving with no skin irritation.  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> good shaver and easy to clean and great price</li>
    <li> Quiet and smooth, the last one lasted almost 30 years, hope this one which is almost the same last as long.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband and he quite likes it.  There is probably no difference between this shaver for $25 and the more expensive ones. They all do the exact same thing, right?  This one provides a close shave with no pinching and that&#x27;s the point isn&#x27;t it?  This one will likely need replacing in a year, but for the price, you can&#x27;t beat it.  This one was within our budget and he&#x27;s had one of these before and liked it so we purchased another one.  He now prefers the style with the rotary blade and says it give a closer shave than the style with the straight rectangular foils.  Strangely enough, for several years he used a Braun travel shaver, which he said gave a really close shave despite its size.  Sadly, Braun no longer makes the inexpensive travel style.  But this one, works even better.  You can&#x27;t go wrong for this price.  He highly recommends this product.</li>
    <li> Works great and very fast shipping just as described</li>
    <li> This Shaver makes a real difference since it cuts your beard 25% closer than typical electric shavers.</li>
    <li> Apparently I needed a new electronic razor worse than I thought. This thing cuts close!</li>
    <li> This inexpensive razor does exactly what I bought it for. I get up at 4:00am to go to work, and by 10am, I&#x27;m a little shaggy. I keep this in my office for a quick, but thorough, shave, and it delivers. Not the closest, to be sure, and it&#x27;s a little unrefined on the skin, but it holds a charge very well, and gets the job done.&lt;br /&gt;A well-made, appropriately priced product.</li>
    <li> husband will love this for Christmas</li>
    <li> It performed to my expectation, but doesn&#x27;t excel. A decent buy for its price.</li>
    <li> Great price. My old one wouldn&#x27;t hold a charge. Saw this and decided to take a chance. RPMs seem low, but it gets the job done.&lt;br /&gt;Use it everyday.</li>
    <li> Not as good as before - more plastic and cheaper feeling.  Doesn&#x27;t cut my beard as close as Norelcos did in the past!</li>
    <li> I find it in dealmoon ,[...] a great deal.&lt;br /&gt;Perfect use. It is enough for normal use.&lt;br /&gt;And the battery lasts quite long.</li>
    <li> This is a good electric shaver for people on a budget. The front blades do not give a very clean shave (my disposables give better), but the trimmer in the back works really well. Also, as many people pointed out, there is no &amp;#34;full charge&amp;#34; LED and the battery is nickel (I believe) so it loses its life if you overcharge it.</li>
    <li> This razor replaced an identical one that I had been using for more than twenty years and the only noticeable difference was that the blades are sharper so it cuts a little better.</li>
    <li> I had one that was more expensive  and this one seemed to shave better I am well satisfied with the razor</li>
    <li> better then more expensive one which I did not like or shave me well get this one and save more?</li>
    <li> Perhaps I could have had my other one repaired, but being hard to get out I chose this one and I am pleased with it.  It is smaller and easy to hold and does the daily job of grooming adequately. Thank you.</li>
    <li> works well, great price</li>
    <li> Great norelco value price, and a good battery life mean comfortable shaves  w/o corded  use.... charged weekly less than overnight!</li>
    <li> My husband really likes his new Philip Norelco electric shaver and says that he doesn&#x27;t have to push down as hard with it as his old shaver, which makes shaving a lot easier.</li>
    <li> its an OK shaver, but i think i liked my old norelco better, but after 15 years it bit the dust.</li>
    <li> A great razor that i love. It works well and shaves very smoothly. The razor head is called HQ56.</li>
    <li> Bought it for my husband who is very lazy when it comes to shaving. He still uses a regular razor along with this. This is like his lazy day tool. He uses a razor Monday, Wednesday, and Friday and this is his Tuesday/Thursday tool. Frankly I think he should use this full time. Super smooth with it IMO.</li>
    <li> Good tool. I have bought it 3 times!</li>
    <li> average razor, but for the price not bad</li>
    <li> You get what you pay for and this was one of the cheaper options out there. It worked OK (not great) for about 3 months but after that it just couldn&#x27;t give a close shave.</li>
    <li> my husband loves this!</li>
    <li> looks very good, I will try it tonight.</li>
    <li> Will last a long time as long as you don&#x27;t overcharge it repeatedly</li>
    <li> great shaver for the $$. Everything as described and delivered in 2 dys flat!</li>
    <li> it leaves skin bumps after shaving, It&#x27;s no smooth at all. As for shaving it&#x27;ll do, but not all the facial hair would be shaved off.  Since you can&#x27;t use shaving cream, it wouldn&#x27;t leave you with smooth skin. It&#x27;ll leave you with burning sensation just hope you have a  very strong after shave afterwards, you&#x27;ll need it.</li>
    <li> Okay.. Its only 35 bucks... so you get what you pay for....&lt;br /&gt;My three main gripes are that the lid to clean the beard trimmings does not flip up.. It comes off completely.&lt;br /&gt;You cannot rinse it.&lt;br /&gt;The battery life is relatively short compared to other Norelco&#x27;s I have owned.</li>
    <li> My daddy loves that he still has the independence to shave himself. He was not able to with a razor. Now, with this shaver, he definitely feels more independent!! Thanks</li>
    <li> It is an OK razor. I didn&#x27;t realize it was rechargeable. I would have rather had a regular plug in razor for more power. It would cost too much to return it. It gives a decent shave for the price.</li>
    <li> excellent product and a good price</li>
    <li> Great Shaver and price!!!!!!!!! Thanks!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> light to the touch, easy to handle and a very smooth shave</li>
    <li> For the price it&#x27;s hard to beat this little razor.  It does a decent shave in short order and the battery charge lasts a long time.  The flip-up trimmer is also very handy for touching up sideburns and stray locks.  One might have to periodically use a regular blade razor for areas like the neck.</li>
    <li> Ordered this shaver for my 15 year old grandson, who has just recently started shaving. Shaver was great price and the directions were easy to understand. Perfect shaver for teens.</li>
    <li> Caca that&#x27;s right Caca! This thing couldn&#x27;t shave the fuzz off a peach.</li>
    <li> Husband loves this but would be great if it came with a stand but it really is worth buying!</li>
    <li> Good shaver for the money, would buy again</li>
    <li> Bought this for my fiancé and he has no complaints!</li>
    <li> Not very smooth but gets job done</li>
    <li> Just had over a month and no longer working or charging. I will contact amazon but according return  policy not eligible for return. Buyer beware</li>
    <li> I buy it for my farther,he like it very much</li>
    <li> Stays charged for 5 days of shaving after one night&#x27;s charge.  Blades last about 8 or 10 months before they get so dull I notice them start to tug at my hairs.</li>
    <li> This was a gift for my son and he loves it.</li>
    <li> Pretty good .I love it！</li>
    <li> looks and feels cheap</li>
    <li> Shaves nicely! Better than my last Norelco!</li>
    <li> Very easy to use and clean.  It does a close shave. It is as good as the other Norelco shavers that I have.</li>
    <li> This replaced my second Norelco razor, which I used for over ten years.  I used my first Norelco for over fifteen years.  This one shaves more comfortably and as close as the first two.  The first time I charged it up, it gave me over three weeks of shaving before haing to re-charge it.  It has easily met my expectations so far.</li>
    <li> good. I receive it on time, and good quality, especially for the battery, lasts so long time--almost a week! I like it</li>
    <li> I purchased in early July 2013 and love it still today (Nov 2013) as it is still providing a close shave.</li>
    <li> Does  ok job and shaves as close as a disposable razor, its far cheaper in the long run also.  I love the pop up trimmer for my beard and side burns along with trimming. The Wife loves to use it to trim and even sculpt other places that get too wild and out of control to mention LOL.</li>
    <li> I was initially very skeptical of buying this razor with it being one of the cheapest options.  The cheapest aren&#x27;t always the best but this product is fantastic!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My previous razor, a Remington, has gone out after only 6 months of use (not a good time for a razor to go out with the upcoming holidays). Since money is tight, I could only afford this but now having used the product for several weeks, I am very glad I didn&#x27;t fork over more money.  This razor has done an incredible job for the price I paid.  The product gets a much closer shave than my other razor ever did.  The shave is very comfortable and leaves my skin smooth.  With my previous razor, if I hadn&#x27;t shaved for about 3 days, I would have to use the trimming tool to trim my facial hair first because the razor would pull the hair rather than cutting it causing a very painful shave and would leave my skin very red.  This razor handles the longer hair very well! Another reason this razor is fantastic, is that it shaves my upper lip and my neck, chin very well.  Those 3 spots are notoriously hard to shave but this razor tackles it with easy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This, being my 3rd in 4 years, is by far the best razor I ever used. I would absolutely recommend this to everyone and would not even consider another brand after being throughly impressed with this Philips Norelco!</li>
    <li> My uncle bought, he said very good, but I have not used, because the shaver is personal activities...&lt;br /&gt;I bought the Braun 790</li>
    <li> Excellent shaving Razor! Can be used cordless or with the cord also. It has a 2 Year Warranty and they even gave me another 1/2 year extensions to 2 1/2 years...-very cool:)!</li>
    <li> Average Norelco shaver (at a low price).  Better than Remington though, by far.</li>
    <li> The best buy I&#x27;ve made in my 80 years. Great price, great shave, I could not be more satisified with Amazon.com&lt;br /&gt;Thank you!</li>
    <li> For years, we bought the very expensive models, and I&#x27;d buy the hubs a new one every three or four years.  Then we moved next to a family with a small son who delights in smashing things, and decided that expensive razors were not a good thing to have around him.  So we bought this one, and it&#x27;s better than any of the high-dollar ones.</li>
    <li> I purchased this to keep in my RV for when we travel.  The motor seems a little weak to me, but it does a decent job cleaning up my two day stubble.</li>
    <li> This worked great and then stopped charging and would not work anymore....</li>
    <li> I had previously bought a more upscale Norelco model which was ok but took much longer to shave. The results were ok. Now with this lower price model I get a faster and closer shave. Save your money and buy this model.</li>
    <li> I bought this razor for my husband as a traveling razor so we would have a dop kit out at our lake house.  He likes it, as a second razor -- but says, &amp;#34;It doesn&#x27;t have fast rotation.&amp;#34;  He thought it was better than the more expensive one he had at home, though.</li>
    <li> Makes for a great travel shaver.</li>
    <li> This is a replacement for an old razor. It is mostly like the other one and does a great job.</li>
    <li> Rough, not very close shave. No batt level indicator</li>
    <li> My dad has everything and every year i buy hi gifts and he never even opens the containers the gifts are in, UNTIL I bought this item! What a winner, he not only opened the gift he used it! THANK YOU!</li>
    <li> Works well and is easy to use.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this shaver for years and it&#x27;s perfect.  Shaves well and it&#x27;s nearly silent.  Very easy to clean too and it goes a month on a charge.</li>
    <li> This razor give me a bad shave every time I use it. I&#x27;m left with scratchy patches, streaks of red on my neck from irritation from the razor, and missed hair(s). Worst cordless razor I&#x27;ve used.</li>
    <li> My Husband is very happy with his Christmas present.  This was a replacement for his old Norelco so it was a no brainer.</li>
    <li> I had been using the high-priced model Norelco for a long while, nursing the original blades along.  But the price of the replacement blade assembly was crimanly high, more than the original razor price.  Norelco should be ashamed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I checked the field of razors but could not find one I liked.  So, I bought the 50 dollar Norelco reluctantly.  It is OK.  Not quite as good as the highpriced model, but replacement blades are within reason.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyone want to buy a highpriced Norelco body?  Perfect condition but useless without very expensive blades.</li>
    <li> Did the research like most.  I&#x27;m a blade shaver but I use this occasionally when I&#x27;m traveling.  I is very comfortable and works great.</li>
    <li> I purchased this as a Christmas Gift for myself but my son and daughter in law provided a gift card for it.&lt;br /&gt;I bought it because it was a perfect match for the one I have had for many years which stopped working.&lt;br /&gt;It is a great basic razor and gives a nice close shave with regular use. I had been using my old razor and a blade razor too.&lt;br /&gt;I was quite surprised by the battery life. The description claimed 35 minutes of shaving on an 8 hour charge.&lt;br /&gt;I charged it for 8 hours and started using it on 1/4/13 and the charge just ran out now on 1/23.&lt;br /&gt;I think this is a great product and Philips Norelco will let you return it within 21 days if you don&#x27;t like it for any reason.</li>
    <li> Rating given in error, tried to post 5 stars!!!!!!!! I love how smooth this makes my face... greatly appreaciate it</li>
    <li> My older models were made much better, quality is just not there.  I should have sent a bit more maybe I would have gotten a better product.</li>
    <li> This is a great electric shaver. I have used Norelco shavers for several years now. And this is one of the best. It gives a clean close shave. You have to be careful not to over shave yourself. It also has a battery that you can use while you are on an airplane or somewhere where you have no Electric current. Thanks Norelco for your work.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok,does it&#x27;s job.</li>
    <li> As a blade shaver, I needed an electric shaver for the occasional &amp;#34; I don&#x27;t want to shave today.&amp;#34; But it&#x27;s a great razor, plus inexpensive and can be used as a plug in should the battery be dead, or resist charge down the line.</li>
    <li> My aunt wanted a shaver for her face and she insisted on getting a 3 way razor as her precious one so I got her this. She likes how sharp and good it is on her legs but so sharp that she&#x27;s afraid to use on her face, hate to say &#x27;I told you so&#x27; because this isn&#x27;t a face razor. I decided to get one for myself too and it works great. This is my back up method in case I need to go out or go swimming but too lazy to go through the hassle of using a regular manual razor. It&#x27;s a great tool to have when I come across those lazy days where I want to wear shorts.</li>
    <li> Decent electric razor. I&#x27;ve only used it once so far and it did a pretty good job. It didn&#x27;t get every hair but no biggy.</li>
    <li> The quality of this razor is poorer then the earlier versions.&lt;br /&gt;It is doing its job but requires more work.&lt;br /&gt;The battery is really BAD.</li>
    <li> Gift for someone, arrived as promised.</li>
    <li> I used this for a month and had razor burn on my neck the entire time.  I also had to use my razor to get the areas this couldn&#x27;t.  Went to charge it the other week and after 8+ hours of charging, wouldn&#x27;t work.</li>
    <li> I find the cost of replacement blades are only slightly cheaper than buying a whole new unit, so I usually end of buying a new unit. I&#x27;ve try to sell my old ones in a garage sale but no luck. I&#x27;ve been using this product for 10 years so you know I am satisfied. The razor is a good value. You won&#x27;t get as smooth of a shave as with a razor, but I don&#x27;t think any electric razor is capable of that. It doesn&#x27;t take long to charge if you don&#x27;t want to use it with the cord. I like the feature in the back and will use this to trim my neckline (a second person really needs to do this for you) and sideburns.</li>
    <li> Very good pruduct and at the best price, the truth will not be disappointed.</li>
    <li> The best u can&#x27;t beat the price I love it i don&#x27;t have a thick beard so this is just perfect for me easy to clean highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Nothing amazing about this shaver. Not bad but certainly nothing I&#x27;d brag about. My old Norelco was much faster and a cleaner shave. The heads on the old one got bent so I pitched it and got this to replace it. I wish I had saved it and just got a new battery and new heads! This one&#x27;s heads spin more slowly so I need to really work at shaving. And after a few shavings, it needs to be recharged. The only good thing is that it wasn&#x27;t that expensive so when I get fed up with it and buy a different shaver, at least I didn&#x27;t spend top dollar for it. I guess this is an example of the adage, &amp;#34;You get what you paid for&amp;#34;. Yep.</li>
    <li> My razor was delivered on August 19, I charged it overnight, and began using it daily on Aug 20. Today is Sept. 29. Forty days of shaving on a single charge, and it&#x27;s not dead yet. And I shave my whole face - no beard or moustache. Aside from an amazing battery, the shave itself is close and comfortable. No complaints. Worth every penny.</li>
    <li> Love it! Will do business again</li>
    <li> Can never go wrong with philips shavers. Shaves great, but need to clean the head after every shave with the provided brush (takes some time to clean properly). Wish it was waterproof and could just put the head under the tap.&lt;br /&gt;For this price range, probably the best out there.</li>
    <li> Horsepower is not enough</li>
    <li> Thank you quick ship it in the Libory item works great very satisfied</li>
    <li> Been a wet shaver for years, but in my old age, the blade was cutting me more than helping.&lt;br /&gt;what a nice surprise,no wet mess,able to get into the paces a blade just cant,and very reasonably close!&lt;br /&gt;not to mention the savings on water, blades and cream!&lt;br /&gt;for this price, a very good quality product.&lt;br /&gt;try it, you wont be disappointed!</li>
    <li> Great gift I got for my brother.</li>
    <li> Bought this shaver and the Nose Trimmer 1100 (NT8110/60) at the same time. Both work extremely well and are easy to clean. Use is cordless and haven&#x27;t had to recharge during any shaves. Smooth shave. Doesn&#x27;t hurt my skin. Would recommend. Amazing price on Amazon, too!</li>
    <li> Poor shaver. Does&lt;br /&gt;Not shave completely.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m having a bit of trouble getting use to this electric shaver.  Although I typically use a 3 - 5 blade shick disposable razor, I&#x27;ve used many electric shavers in the past and never had problems with razor burn, ever.  My son has an older similar Norelco shaver that I borrow once in a while.  He never liked his as he said it felt like it was trying to yank the hairs out of his face.  I on the other hand thought it was a great shaver and added it to my wish list.  But this new Norelco leaves bumps and rashes all over my neck and face.  Unless I splash my face with that pre-shaving stuff and then again with the electric aftershave when I&#x27;m done, I will look like a big red strawberry for a couple days,  Even with pre and post treatment, I still have a good razor burn that last several hours after I shave.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s awesome!!! It&#x27;s everything I needed in an electric razor</li>
    <li> It would Have been nice to a more presentable case for the thing but I will get along with what I have otherwise the razor is just fine . Very much better than my old one of the same mo#  Thank you much. Jct216x.@gmail</li>
    <li> I really liked this razor right from the first shave.  Maybe it&#x27;s because I&#x27;ve been using other Norelco razors, but I didn&#x27;t need any sort of break-in period.  The shave is close, no razor burn, and it&#x27;s fast.  Noise level is about the same as my old razor.  I don&#x27;t mind that I can&#x27;t clean it with water because frankly I hardly ever did that with the old razor anyway and I think because it&#x27;s not water proof it&#x27;s a little lighter.  I&#x27;ve been getting 7-8 shaves per charge, which is perfectly adequate for me.  And you can&#x27;t beat the price.  Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband and he loves it.  Second one I have purchased for him, in quite a few years.  Trouble is they last a long time so therefore does not need replacement very often.&lt;br /&gt;Good products and will continue to purchase even for Christmas gifts for my family.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been after my husband for *years* to switch to an electric razor. Especially these days, as disposables seem to be getting more expensive than ever, I thought this would be a good one to try. For the price, as he says, it definitely does what it is supposed to do and gives a smooth shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s been a long time since he tried an electric razor, so his biggest surprise was that the shave was as close as it was. He was actually quite impressed. He also liked that there were no problems with ingrown whiskers, which used to be a problem in the past. He also liked the availability of the trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only downside, for him, was that his neck tends to be quite sensitive, so at times there was a bit of irritation (particularly if he were to sweat right after shaving). However, he freely admits that it may just be because he is used to standard razor blades. In time, he believes, the irritation would subside and no longer be an issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the price, it&#x27;s a great bargain and he would recommend it to anyone who is looking to try an electric razor for the first time. He intends to keep using it, which is the greatest recommendation he could give.</li>
    <li> I bought this last month and i have used it several times. its really good and does exactly as advertised. its very silent and runs smooth. at first i wasnt even sure if it was running, it was that quiet. doesnt pull hairs. but i did feel a little burning feeling after shave. which is not that big deal. i guess it happens with non-wet shavers.&lt;br /&gt;pop up trimmer is really cool and works really good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i can recommend this to anybody with no bad feelings.</li>
    <li> Nice shave but not the closest shave ever. Cuts nicely and does not pull. Very amazing product to get as a gift.</li>
    <li> iit&#x27;s good razor. it&#x27;s very cheap. I did not use yet, but may be good. I seem to be price range ratio good goods and recommend.</li>
    <li> Shaving wise this thing does okay - nothing special but it functions. However, it is NOT waterproof (can&#x27;t rinse it out! eeewwww!) and it only runs on 120V (the first time I&#x27;ve ever heard of a razor not being 120-240V) making it useless for travel. Basically, I wasted $30 on a piece of junk I can&#x27;t travel with and I can&#x27;t wash. Which is just gross.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I want to clarify - the description DOES say 120V-240V. The product itself has no markings but the cord (NOT an adapter, the power supply is internal) is labelled 120V. I&#x27;m not actually sure it can&#x27;t handle 240V, but it has no markings on it to indicate it can. Why risk it when it&#x27;s already not washable and kinda gross? I&#x27;m spending $10 more on the next model up!</li>
    <li> good and it is very cheap. it is beyond my imagnation. when i used it, the sound is low and not so nosiy</li>
    <li> You cannot expect much for this price.  Pay more and get a quality shaver.  Very bad quality even at this price!</li>
    <li> When I first received the shaver, I noticed that it made an operating noise that was much lower in volume compared to my much higher end shaver that cost 15X more than this one. No problem I said, I got this on the cheap solely for a backup shaver should my primary one die on me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No way, this shaver will butcher your face and it can&#x27;t get the hard to reach areas, like around the lower jaw/upper neck areas. You had to go through multiple passes on the same area just to get a good trim, I&#x27;m all for a good deal just like the next guy, but there&#x27;s no way I can justify to butcher my face to cause all that pain and suffering for a &amp;#34;deal&amp;#34; that&#x27;s not even worth it. Spend the extra money for a better model, your face and sanity will thank you for it.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my husband and could kick myself for not doing sooner. Because of its low cost I thought it would be a disappointment to my husband. I bought him a very expensive razor couple years ago. He says this one is way better. Other one went to trash bin.</li>
    <li> Razor runs slower than previous one that I had, and therefore, it does not seem to cut as quickly.&lt;br /&gt;.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t seem to shave quite as well as previous models owned. Doesn&#x27;t let you know when the charge is low, just stops in the middle of your shave. You have to recharge on a schedule rather than when a led starts blinking. I would not buy this one again but would look for a better model.</li>
    <li> Husband loves it.  Shaky hands finally required him to give up razors and he has found this an acceptable replacement for a smooth shave.</li>
    <li> This si such a great convenience works great!</li>
    <li> My husband&#x27;s had at least 5 different razors i the last 5 years, and this one is the best one so far.</li>
    <li> This razor was terrible. It didn&#x27;t even take off my hair. I returned it immediately.</li>
    <li> close shave- very quite</li>
    <li> Good price but I must say blade get dull after couple shaves oil and clippers spray is a must to keep it sharp..</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t used a electric razor in a while but technology has improved. Always had good experience with Philips personal products and this is another case of that.</li>
    <li> I have a heavy beard &amp; usually use a blade &amp; shaving cream but sometimes I just need to clean up a bit if I&#x27;m going out for dinner. Not only does this razor work well for that, but I now have started using it every other shave and i&#x27;m amazed at how well it performs.</li>
    <li> I received it in excellent condition!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s hard to understand how this razor made it into production with its serious design fault.  The razor will not stay in its charging base under any circumstances.  The charger base is round and it tips over every time.  I used a stout rubber band to lash it into the charger base.  It has no power.  The razor gives heavy razor burn, and takes far to long to shave.  An unmitiagted disaster!  Back it goes to Amazon.</li>
    <li> Wow! This thing really does a good job. I had another cheap electric razor before (the twin row kind) and it was terrible and I&#x27;m glad I lost it on vacation but this one is great! It&#x27;s funny, I usually dread shaving but sometimes when I get home in the evening I&#x27;ll just turn this on and get my shaving done as I read the mail or talk to my wife :)&lt;br /&gt;AND it&#x27;s a SURPRISINGLY close shave, like using a razor if you go against the grain, as they recommend&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:&lt;br /&gt;Dec 11, 2014&lt;br /&gt;I have only charged it the second week after I bought it, I shave every other day or so. It&#x27;s still going over a month later. I LIKE this razor. It&#x27;s finally time for a recharge. I&#x27;m considering buying a backup one for whenever this one craps out someday.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:&lt;br /&gt;June 15, 2015&lt;br /&gt;It still works great. I use it daily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: July 19, 2016&lt;br /&gt;It still works great. I replaced the heads with Genuine Norelco heads (from an online auction site) since I lost two of them and there&#x27;s not much difference between the originals and the new ones; keep on trucking if you still have your originals&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: July 26, 2017&lt;br /&gt;It still works great.</li>
    <li> My teenage son had a great first shave!!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know why it&#x27; #1 bestseller. My husband has Alzheimer&#x27;s and I tried to shave him with this last week.  To me, it was a waste of time. I pulled the skin taut like instructions said, but it still didn&#x27;t want to remove beard. I don&#x27;t know what shaver would be better though.</li>
    <li> The product works well for the price.</li>
    <li> For my son.  This is his 2nd.  works great</li>
    <li> Bought this one for my friend and he loves it very much. He said it works great and his skin feels smooth: no irritation at all. Thank you for great product and great service.</li>
    <li> terrific and smooth shave</li>
    <li> Works very well with very low irritation. Smooth action. Great design.</li>
    <li> GREAT PRICE  GOOD PROUDCT. THANKS TOM</li>
    <li> Good deal for a basic shaver. I bought it for my father who has Parkinson&#x27;s. His previous shaver just stopped working and resorted to using a razor. His Parkinson&#x27;s made it challenging for him and frequently ended up with nicks. He didn&#x27;t want an expensive replacement; he is pleased with this shaver at this price. The only caveat is that it takes 8 hours to fully charge but only lasts for 35 minutes worth of shaving.</li>
    <li> quiet- shaves close- love it.</li>
    <li> Cost effective and works great! This shaver is still rechargeable and has a side burn trimmer. Not as fancy as the expensive Norelco units, but just as functional on a daily bases.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s real cheap and now I know it&#x27;s not as pro as we think</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this several months now and I&#x27;m happy with it. A couple of good points: 1. The motor is quieter than the one I had before. This is nice because now I can hear the cutting action of the blades, so I know when it is still hacking away at the forest. Helps me know when I&#x27;m done. 2. Easy to clean just by blowing out the whiskers with my breath. When the blades are whisker free I can hear the blades freely spinning with my blows.</li>
    <li> Great shaver for the price. Comfortable and smooth shave. Feels a bit lighter than my other Norelco. Hopefully the battery is as good as my other one.</li>
    <li> As expected and delivered on time.</li>
    <li> My husband really likes this shaver. He says they have made improvements since  the last time he used one. I certainly like the close shave he gets.</li>
    <li> i love the reflex action rather then the floating heads</li>
    <li> I am a female but I needed to throw out the bladed razors when I had to start taking coumadin blood thinner medication so I bought this for my legs and underarms.  It works fine.  Doesn&#x27;t get quite as close as the blades but I really like this razor.  It warns you that your skin will get irritated the first few weeks.  THAT IS TRUE!!!!  Especially under the arms but I am happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> My son is just starting to shave. At 14 years-old he obviously doesn&#x27;t have a full beard stubble to remove so there was no need to go hog wild in buying the biggest and best. This was the perfect razor for him to start with. He&#x27;s had no trouble and it stays charged for the days he doesn&#x27;t use it. I like the pop out trimmer. Works great for his neck and sideburns.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We are happy with this purchase at just the right price for a starter.</li>
    <li> Ordered this one for Dad because I&#x27;ve loved mine for over a year. So easy and economical</li>
    <li> I replaced a 10 year old Remington and am very satisfied. The Norelco seems to stayed charged for along time and is extremely quiet. Above all it gives me a close shave with comfort.</li>
    <li> Best shave I have had in years.</li>
    <li> Been using it for a couple months works great. Great choice for a first time electric razor user</li>
    <li> ARRIVED ON TIME.WAS PACKAGED IN ORIGINAL BOX AND HOLDS A CHARGE VERY WELL SO FAR, ABOUT 2 WEEKS OR SO.THE ONLY THING THAT IM CONCERNED ABOUT IS SOMETIMES IT MAKES A SQUEAKING/GRINDING SOUND WHEN IN USE.MAYBE IT IS BECAUSE IT&#x27;S NEW AND STILL BEING BROKEN IN.IF NOT THEN IM DONE BUYING ONLINE BECAUSE RETURNING IS A HASSLE AND COSTS $.WALMART HERE I COME IN PERSON, SO IF ITS REFURBISHED AND REPACKED AND REMARKETED BECAUSE IT WAS PREVIOUSLY RETURNED BY SOMEONE ELSE THEN I WILL DO THE SAME.</li>
    <li> a replacement for same model bought years ago......works great</li>
    <li> Does the job and quiet!</li>
    <li> a GREAT VALUE. . .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My husband has used the shaver for three weeks and says that it does a great job shaving--much better than other shavers he tried or razors and lather.</li>
    <li> Works well for the price. Has a nice little flip-up beard trimmer on the back. Out of the box it will probably need to charge for a bit, mine did at least. Definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> Good shave but the battery charge doesn&#x27;t last very long. Probably why this model has been discontinued.</li>
    <li> Very good and practical shaver</li>
    <li> what can I say . its a Norelco . I have a really tuff beard , It mows it down and should last forever</li>
    <li> I received and have been using my shaver daily for a month or so, charging it once a week. It has performed flawlessly so far. It is nice and light, easy to handle and easy to clean with each use. I am very satisfied with it.</li>
    <li> shaves very quiet and smooth, works also on 220V, so it will work in Europe as well.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m very satisfied.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my FIL, works well!</li>
    <li> I bought this for Christmas, and just opened it to use it. I found it did not have an electric cord with it. Of course, my old Norelco cords don&#x27;t work. It is too late to return it, so into the trash this piece of rubbish goes!</li>
    <li> Why only 3 stars?  because I have a tough beard.  I have tried the expensive razors and the quality brand but less expensive ones and find no difference in the quality of the shave.  the problem is even with self sharpening blades like this one  the quality of the shave diminishes rapidly.  lastly, the replacement blades are more expensive than the razor and never seem to be as good as the originals.  that&#x27;s why I keep buying razors.  If you have a soft beard this is a great buy</li>
    <li> Have had a Philishave since they came out in the 50th. Always been satisfied. And I am sure will continue to do so.</li>
    <li> best shaver i have ever owned wish I had found this one along time ago! It follows couture of my face and that is a plus</li>
    <li> My face grows in more heavily than most. I use a regular razor when I want a good shave, but wanted this for during the week when I just want a quick clean up and don&#x27;t feel like lathering up. This gets me to my morning coffee quicker. It does about as good as I expected for the price.</li>
    <li> smooth shave at it&#x27;s best</li>
    <li> I have a light beard, so I don&#x27;t need a workhorse, but this razor, even for me, is a bit of a toy.  Its rpms are very slow even at full charge.  It cuts without pinching, but right now it is only weeks old.  At a purchase price of around $25 it is fair value, but when the blades get old and dull, I probably will toss it and search for something new.  I think current electric rechargeables are vastly overpriced.  I had an excellent Remington rechargeable that I bought over ten years ago for about the same price.  Ah well...</li>
    <li> The shaver is quite good and a lot sharper than my old one.  The charge does not last as long as I would like it to but I am satisfied.  I am glad I bought this instead of new blades for the old one.</li>
    <li> Perfect. Cheap price, good build. I had an older model of this and liked it so much I got this newer updated one when the old one finally died after 10+ years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You don&#x27;t have to re-charge the battery, you can use it with the unit plugged in. (Who needs a wireless shaver?! To shave in the car, Jeez just shave in the mirror with it plugged in, it only takes 2 min.)</li>
    <li> I read the reviews saying that it is a good value for money and I bought it. But I realized again that  &#x27;value for money&#x27; means, you get less value, if you pay less money. It doesn&#x27;t have the wet shave option and leaves the skin very irritated, very difficult to clean as well!&lt;br /&gt;I returned this one, and paid more money to get more value out of a higher model.</li>
    <li> For that 1 star review. What you can expect for $22.? I use 5 dollar coupon. It is execellent and close shave. Reasonable price and quality. I like it.</li>
    <li> Cannot believe what a great shave I get in a really short time. Also surprised how long a single overnight charge lasts for me since I shave almost daily. Good price, prompt delivery, product as described or better. I would purchase from this vendor again.</li>
    <li> Product arrived quickly, well packed and appears to be of decent quality, will update that part once tested out.  I own another model cordless philips and generally battery life is great and replacing heads every 6 months should be more than sufficient and found on amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This seller PC Parts Depot (if you&#x27;re ordering from them,) you might say has a new egg there if you get my drift.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you like new eggs, you&#x27;ll like the price of this item elsewhere much better, about $10 less and free shipping. Item just arrived in a non-Amazon box, which is how I know.</li>
    <li> This electric razor is a good value, has 2 nice surprises. 1.  Has a Trimmer for sideburns, eyebrows.  2.  Is rechargeable.&lt;br /&gt;Comment: (1) It seems rather slow in comparison to what I was using previously, for many years until the rechargeable battery on former razor died, wife said old one was about $160+ 5+ years ago.  (2) The plastic pack it came in was very thick plastic, so the first task was to get it out of the plastic without cutting myself. I considered knives, heating blade hot to melt, perhaps a saw tooth steak knife. I have a 4 inch set of Electronic Technician diagonal cutters, good for small wires, tough fingernails, toenails. They did the job with multiple cuts around the plastic until freed without damage. Charged it, shaved with it several times. It was worth the price and shipping. I shave with blades about once a week, so the electric is good for in between clean-up.  I am happy with my purchase and the cost, including lowest cost shipping.</li>
    <li> great gift for my son for Christmas. I would recommend this to anyone for first time shavers like my son</li>
    <li> This shaver does have a trimmer. Battery life is less then other Norelco&#x27;s I have had. The shave is comfortable but must do a lot of repeat motion to get the job done, RPM&#x27;S seem slower then other models. I have owned several Norelco shavers and this model is the &amp;#34;Chevrolet&amp;#34; and not the Cadilac. I will likely not buy this model again when it comes time to replace, I will spend a little more.</li>
    <li> I really like perfect cut and the battery lasts more than what you say I love good buy buys recommend</li>
    <li> Affordable and fast shipping. It&#x27;s cheaper than going to walgreens and does the job.&lt;br /&gt;If you don&#x27;t know what this razor does, you don&#x27;t need it.</li>
    <li> I have owned and used a Philips Norelco shaver (6863 XL--I&#x27;m pretty sure they don&#x27;t make this model anymore) for YEARS.  The battery has finally completely given out and even when it is plugged in, it still won&#x27;t work.  I got a Remington SR9130TV and it was good, but it just felt so bulky so I thought I&#x27;d grab this.  In so many ways, it is just like the 6863 XL and I love it.  I still prefer my 6863, but I won&#x27;t bother getting into the trivial comparisons since I doubt many people will have owned a 6863, anyway. Instead, here&#x27;s what I like about this model:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Not too large--easy to hold.&lt;br /&gt;* As part of the previous--the shaving heads are small so while you are shaving, your hand is close to the skin on your face which lends to a greater feeling of fine control&lt;br /&gt;* The pop up trimmer can be opened and closed with 1 hand without significantly adjusting your grip&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And what a nice, smooth shave I got, too!  Things wear out and getting a new replacement of most things really shows how much the old thing has slowly degraded.  At the time of this review, the product was $30 and at that cost I recommend getting a new one just to enjoy the fabulous, smooth shave you didn&#x27;t realize you aren&#x27;t getting anymore.</li>
    <li> Husband&#x27;s beard is not very thick , so give him the basic models! Although it&#x27;s  not body wash , but shave very clean .He likes , that&#x27;s my love.</li>
    <li> The razor works well and was a bargain for the price.&lt;br /&gt;A good product at a good price. Definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> Gets the job done with no pinching pulling or shave bumps</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t used an electric shaver in decades and this is quite an improvement. I opted for this because of price. I don&#x27;t see the need for any other features than simply shaving whiskers, which it does very well</li>
    <li> great shave.  close. comfortable.  extremely light. it was supposed to come with a bag and a brush that weren&#x27;t there.</li>
    <li> Good price and fast shipping</li>
    <li> It does a good job of letting me trim around my beard and that&#x27;s why I wanted it.</li>
    <li> It does cut close and with comfort.</li>
    <li> Ezactly what my husband wanted and likes</li>
    <li> I love the shaver and satisfied with the purchase.</li>
    <li> Quit after 2 months.  Luckily, I got a better one as a Christmas gift!!</li>
    <li> Great shaver and a good buy!</li>
    <li> Nice affordable razor for everyday use</li>
    <li> This gives a nice close shave.  It&#x27;s battery life is excellent.  It&#x27;s a great value for the price.</li>
    <li> Bought this a gift for my husband as a replacement for one that got broken. He was pleased with it because he had one before but that&#x27;s about all I can say. It was packaged in that awful plastic formed stuff over a printed paperboard piece. It is horrible to try and open those things! I refuse to buy one of those gadgets made &#x27;specially to open them because that just encourages manufacturers to continue packaging that way. What&#x27;s wrong with a box made from recycled paper/cardboard?</li>
    <li> Ordered for my son for Christmas.  He loves it.</li>
    <li> Same as above. Thanks so much.Well pleased.</li>
    <li> Weak motor - cuts well but doesn&#x27;t look like a quality piece at all.</li>
    <li> I got this item for my stepson&#x27;s first razor.  It was a cheap and affordable and exactly what I was interested in for starting my little man on the next journey.  So far, it&#x27;s reliable and easy to clean.</li>
    <li> It works great. Thank you</li>
    <li> Had this a month or two. Easy to take head off shaver to discard of shavings/hair. Very smooth feel. Have not gotten a single cut from the shaves with this product. Very quiet too. Not your typical lawnmower sounding weed whacker of a shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is quite affordable, which gives me the thought that this wont last too long before it dies, but I got it for around 30 bucks, and I wouldn&#x27;t mind having to replace it every year or so for that price.</li>
    <li> Shaves well ny last one lasted for 10 years or more, its rechargeable and hopefully will last another 10 years</li>
    <li> I have a full beard. I travel internationally. There are times when I need to reduce stubble but not have to shave as close as a blade will get. Electric razors have never been my choice over the years. This was a chance choice to see if I might find a reasonable evolution. Basically, nothing shaves as close or as crisp as a razor, even the basic 2 blade disposables. For light beards these may prove satisfactory. But for heavier beards, stick with shaving cream and your choice of manual razorss</li>
    <li> Closest shave I&#x27;ve ever had and no skin irritation or leftover hair in the blades. This thing is awesome!</li>
    <li> Very nice, got three days ahead of schedule, got this shaver for my elderly father-in-law who is in a assisted living home and he is very happy with it. Thank you</li>
    <li> very good i like it so much!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> The old expression, you get what you pay for.  When it comes to razors, this is not the one for those with strong hair.</li>
    <li> As others have posted, this is a lower power shaver. If you&#x27;re the type who has a 5 o&#x27;clock shadow 2 hours after you shave, I would not recommend. Does well for me. Light beard, use daily to clean up around the goatee. If you take it slow and do not press it hard onto your skin it gets about 99% done.</li>
    <li> Who would have thunk it! I hate shaving my legs I have to devote a space of time to get in the shower, soap up the legs and shave in a not very comfortable position, But not any more with this little beauty I just prop a leg up on the bathtub and shve in minutes. I should have thought of this sooner.</li>
    <li> works as expected, provides a great ,close, clean shave, without dragging or cuts</li>
    <li> present for my husband, he loves it!</li>
    <li> Works like a charm and at a great price too.</li>
    <li> Use it every day, works great!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my grandson. He really likes it</li>
    <li> The least expensive and best shaver I have ever had. The fourth Norelco I&#x27;ve had, and the closest shave.</li>
    <li> My husband had this razor and liked it very much but it needed a new head .But we found i t was just as  economical  to buy a new razor..</li>
    <li> Replacement for a previous Norelco that had been dropped one too many time. I love the Norelco shavers and have owned numerous different ones. It is almost cheaper to buy a new one that it is to buy replacement blades/heads.</li>
    <li> Now I can shave quickly and comfortably. This item works great and don&#x27;t bother getting anything that&#x27;s fancier or more expensive unless you wanna shave in the shower. 5 stars all the way!!</li>
    <li> replacement for my old one 15 or so years old best part my old charge cord works hope the 12v coed works also</li>
    <li> Bought 2 of these - 1 for each of my teenage boys.....does the job well....</li>
    <li> Big improvement over my old one which died after many years.  Nice and compact, and a close shave too.  Never as good as a blade, but about as good as I could imagine from an electric.  And the price was very reasonable.</li>
    <li> I cannot review this product because the package product sticker number matches the number that I ordered, however the actual razor inside was not the razor pictured with the product when I placed the order. I though it would be a 3 round floating head shaver, it is a straight head series 7000 Bodygroom 7100 Model BG2040 according to the package printing on the box.</li>
    <li> Let me start off by saying this is a good shaver for the price. It&#x27;s entry level and won&#x27;t provide the razor smooth results of a high end shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I picked this up at CVS about three months ago as an impulse buy, more than anything else. I own several electric shavers from the big three companies and bought this just to add to the collection. It was $50 but since I had a 20% off coupon I decided to pull the trigger. I&#x27;m not blown away but it&#x27;s not a purchase I regret.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first couple of weeks the results were subpar and the irritation was horrible. I kept at it though as I know sometimes your skin just has to get used to it. Within two weeks I was seeing full results. For the $35 it costs on Amazon right now, I&#x27;d buy if you&#x27;re looking for an electric shaver on a budget, a decent backup, or one for travel. The shaver is good and gets visibly close on the cheeks and jawline. The neck is still a tough spot as with most electric shavers. The trimmer is exactly what you&#x27;d expect on a $35 shaver. It&#x27;s not great but nothing to complain about.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The biggest con is that you aren&#x27;t supposed to clean it with water. I personally just pop the head off and splash the body under the faucet for a split second to clean, I then rinse the hease under water for a good 30 seconds. After that I shake them dry and pretend it never happened. I guess the shaver does too because after three months it&#x27;s still going strong. Would I recommend that, probably not and I&#x27;m sure it will catch up to me one day so do at your own risk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At the end of the day I think just about anyone can find some use out of this for $35, so with that being said...yeah I&#x27;d recommend it.</li>
    <li> This shaver cuts close all right. But it may be too close for some of us. It leaves my face smarting from the sharpness of the blade even when I try not to press too hard. I would opt for another choice next time.</li>
    <li> In my country there is shortage of disposable razors and almost everything so this came perfect for me. Just keep the blades clean and it will do the job.</li>
    <li> He loved and still loves it!! My fiancé has this one also and in fact he was the one who suggested to get this for my dad. He was so sure my dad will like it. And I was glad he did. :-)</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s OK ... that&#x27;s the best I can say. My really old Norelco finally &amp;#34;died&amp;#34; after many years of use. Purchased this as a replacement, but it is no way near the quality of my old one. It works. But everything about it is &amp;#34;flimsy&amp;#34; feeling, and the blades are no way near as sharp as my old one, even after years of use.</li>
    <li> Very pleased, works well.</li>
    <li> Shaves head and face.</li>
    <li> Does the job. Comfortable,easy shave. Very good for the price.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok for the money not the best</li>
    <li> My husband says the razor works well.</li>
    <li> My husband uses this and likes it!</li>
    <li> It does the job for my face well.</li>
    <li> Imported&lt;br /&gt;  Close-cut Heads with durable, self-sharpening blades&lt;br /&gt;  Heads flex and float for ultra closeness&lt;br /&gt;  Pop-up trimmer is perfect for your sideburns and moustache&lt;br /&gt;  Up to 35 minutes of cordless shaving with an 8 hour charge&lt;br /&gt;  Easy to clean with hair collection chamber and cleaning brush</li>
    <li> Durable and much better than the single blade ones.</li>
    <li> Could NOT be HAPPIER!!!!!!!!!!!  My last rechargeable razor was a piece of junk.  It putzed out on me about a year after I got it, and every time I used it, it shredded my face.  The Phillips?  AWESOME!!!!!  I like the fact that you can use it as a cordless razor, or keep it plugged in.  I get a nice, clean, close shave every time I use it.  Five plus stars for me!</li>
    <li> Much better than I thought it would be, for the price I paid.</li>
    <li> Previously used the Gillette Mach 3 until developing skin irritation and was advised trying electric razor. Looking over the availability of electric razors and their features have found this one to be a sensible choice price and feature wise. The past month has been a comfortable shave and look forward to many more.j</li>
    <li> a good shaver, helped me realise how blunt my old shaver was.</li>
    <li> my husband is very happy with this.  cuts real close and its ok without a stand.  would get another one</li>
    <li> This works better for shaving my legs then for shaving my husbands face. It wouldn&#x27;t get all the hair on his face and his skin felt raw by the time he was done. I would not buy this again. Waste of my money. Although I do use it for my legs and its great!!</li>
    <li> Very easy to use, very easy to clean, very easy to recharge. Overall, this product served its purpose excellently and I could not find a fault with the product, shipping, ordering process. 5 Stars!</li>
    <li> I felt it was easier and faster to use a regular wet razor since I shave both face and head.</li>
    <li> This is my first electric shaver and I love it!</li>
    <li> Nice inexpensive shaver good for face and body works.</li>
    <li> Wonderfull i love this model</li>
    <li> good product... the shave is a lil rough.. since it was my first time</li>
    <li> My teenage son says &#x27;pretty good&#x27;.  but he is new to shaving, and just plain old prefers this over a blade.  The battery life seems to be pretty good. he only shaves 1-2 times a week and it holds a charge for a couple weeks.</li>
    <li> It gets the job done.  Ive only used it once so far but it cut my neck and irritated most of my neck with red marks that I had all day long.  Ill try to be more careful shaving next time.  Maybe I put too much pressure on it while shaving?  We&#x27;ll see.......</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for 3+ months now and I&#x27;m happy with the results.  Produces a good shave without irritation... holds a charge pretty well and has been problem free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the wish list for this model would be a low charge indicator of some sort - this lacks that completely.  You can kind of tell when the whir of the razor takes a lower frequency, but that may mean that this craps out for you mid-shave.  That&#x27;s the only thing not to like here for me.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t have the clean by water like my old shaver but the price is good so I am pleased with it</li>
    <li> Like the bang for the buck ($30 plus tax &amp; shipping).  I (female) use it on my legs, &amp; like all electric shavers, it doesn&#x27;t remove all hair close enough...passable, though.  Tried it on underarms, even with directions found online, but ended up with some chewed up skin.  I am on Coumadin, so that&#x27;s the original reason I got an electric razor.  It&#x27;s important that I not injure myself shaving.  I reverted to using manual razor for underarms, as that can be controlled better.</li>
    <li> Even thought it gives a clean shave with new blades, i have to pass it numerous time over my face to achieve a clean shave.</li>
    <li> Reliable battery life. Easy to clean and maintain, and left no razor bumps. Overally, would highly recommend to all regular shavers.</li>
    <li> I just purchased in Fort Myers, FL. and I wanted one in Florida, too...........................................lol.  And it will &amp;#34;make my Ex-Wife&amp;#34; mad.</li>
    <li> The built-on trimmer is somewhat worthless, which is mostly why I bought this product, but the battery life is acceptable. Everything else is fine, too.</li>
    <li> Give a smoothe shave and it quiet and painless.</li>
    <li> The shaver is a very good value for the money. Use it every day and it works perfectly.</li>
    <li> Excellent for the price.  I used to shave every other day with a razor, but now shave everyday.  The shave is quicker and less irritating than a razor, easy to clean.  Don&#x27;t bother spending a lot for electric shavers that you can take in the shower.</li>
    <li> I was expecting a little more</li>
    <li> Does the job well.  Only one complaint - it should be multi-voltage.  A common problem with electrical gadgets sold in the US.</li>
    <li> lacking storage pouch but runs when battery is dead via cord. Most important feature if you ever had to shave rapidly but had to wait for shaver to charge because you forgot to plug it in the night before. Not the water proof model so is less expensive but I don&#x27;t shave in the shower so I saved some money.</li>
    <li> The worst. Had one years ago lasted for years. This on was dull in two months. I should have returned it but f I r got I had ordered it on Amazon.  Don&#x27;t waste your money</li>
    <li> This is a good razor--pretty much the same device that it has been for the last 25 years that I can remember.  The battery last for several shaves and the trimmer works as one would expect.  Good product.</li>
    <li> This is a great razor for the money, it cost about the same as a set of replacement blades for my old one. I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars only because the quality feel of this razor. But, it is working great so far.</li>
    <li> very pleased, better than expected.</li>
    <li> So quiet you barely know it is on, wife loves for her legs. Would recommend to others.</li>
    <li> My husband has an expensive one that cuts a little closer to my skin than this.  But it is a good shaver.  It just takes a little longer to go over some spots on my legs.</li>
    <li> Light weight, medium quiet, awaiting by use for it to cut closer.  For the price it appears to be a good buy!</li>
    <li> Razor does the job. I&#x27;am happy with it.</li>
    <li> It is the only razor I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
    <li> Very close smooth shave.  Very happy with it.</li>
    <li> Not as smooth as my $80 Norelco but for the price, I&#x27;m shocked at how nice it is. I&#x27;ll use this as a spare for the second, lesser-used bath. Couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
    <li> Even better than my old Norelco.</li>
    <li> Got this for 15 year old who seems to be growing hair like he is fertilizing it!...It is great &amp; just saw it at CVS for $85.00!</li>
    <li> the best bang for the buck!</li>
    <li> Poor performance - the new PNs are very inferior to the original ones.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using an electric shaver for some time.  I have only had this one for a few months but it is the least expensive one I have ever had and works at least as well as any I have had. Clean shave, quiet, even has a trimmer which many inexpensive shavers don&#x27;t.  Couldn&#x27;t be more pleased to this point.</li>
    <li> I do believe it will do the job just fine.</li>
    <li> For the price, this product is great. Works very well and the charge last a long time. Every day shaving, the charge will last 3-4 weeks. The shave is better than my previous more expensive Norelco. Great product, great service!</li>
    <li> Great Shaver for its price</li>
    <li> Meets expectation!  No, even beyond.  He usually complains about everything, and nothing but good words about the close shave.  The nice thing is that it was charged on opening... no having to wait 8 hours to try.  I don&#x27;t know how big a charge it had, but certainly enough to try it out.</li>
    <li> Excellent shaver!  Provides a super close shave with no pinching or irritation.  Also very easy to clean.</li>
    <li> bought for my son. regular razor irritated his skin. this one doesn&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> Like always, everything is ok</li>
    <li> This razor is pretty decent and gives a pretty close shave.  The battery life is quite limited and eventually you may need to just plug it in.  The head pops off and can be washed in hot water and the rest is easy enough to clear.  One thing I finally figured out about these 3 head Norelco shavers: if you manage to get a few longer hairs into the blades they tend to wrap around and eventually impede the movement of the head and displace the edges enough to make the shave no longer close.  Inside the shaver head, unscrew the little plastic thingy and the blade assemblies pop out.  One by one, pop them out, remove the blade from it&#x27;s little cowling and remove any long hair wrapped around or coiled around axle of blade wheel or blade, and replace in the head. Replace plastic screw top. If there was hair inside function should miraculously recover!</li>
    <li> It is two in one shaver,charge it use it as you need it works well&amp; it is a quality product.</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with this product. The only reason i didnt give it 5 Stars was because i do have to struggle sometimes to cut a few hairs.</li>
    <li> Gets rid of facial hair!!</li>
    <li> Nice shaver,at a reasonable price.Nice close shave</li>
    <li> Nothing special.  This isn&#x27;t the answer if you are looking to ditch a razor, just enough for a spot job in a clutch.</li>
    <li> Received within time stated.  Works as described.</li>
    <li> Lasted only a few weeks then it could not hold a charge.  Return period of 30 days ended a few days before product lost its charge for good.</li>
    <li> Excellent. Excellent sale, excellent product. Totally satisfied all around. Thank you!</li>
    <li> I should have bought it sooner. I now get a close shave each morning. It is a replacement for my old shaver that I had for the last 20 years.</li>
    <li> I brought this product because I needed to replace my previous razor by this brand.  I looked at the other models in the lineup, and decided on this model.  I like the shave and closeness. I like the rechargeable battery. I also like the experience I had with my previous razor.  I recommend this product because of my experiences with this model and my previous model. I do like the fact I can replace the heads in the future as well. This model was cheaper on Amazon than it was in Target.</li>
    <li> Great product for great price.&lt;br /&gt;Its Phillips, so no comments necessary. They make the best electronic razor!&lt;br /&gt;Not the best, but does its job for the price!!\&lt;br /&gt;Good Buy!</li>
    <li> Pretty good shaver, very cheap, fast shipping.&lt;br /&gt;The best, you can charge and use with or without cord, quiet and smooth skin.</li>
    <li> seems to work well and was a great deal</li>
    <li> I had used 3 different Braun rechargeable foil razors for years, but felt that Braun was making their shavers too complex. I thought I would try a rotary head and bought this inexpensive Norelco model. I have used it over the past 6 months.  Every time I use it, I am left with nasty red blotches and a rash, especially on the neck. This is just a bad design.  Maybe it&#x27;s just my face, though I never had this problem with the Brauns. Maybe I can&#x27;t use rotary heads for some reason. Anyway, I&#x27;ve thrown the Norelco in the garbage and am trying a Remington foil.</li>
    <li> Works just like my old one and cost less than the replacement heads.</li>
    <li> We got this for my husband for fathers day (yeah it&#x27;s cliche but he really needed a new one) and he likes it. It charges pretty quickly and more importantly it holds the charge for a long time. He commented that you don&#x27;t really know you need a new razor until you get the new one and realize how dull the old one was.</li>
    <li> Shaves very closely, very neatly. Its battery is holding charge for weeks. The price is great also. Had it for about 4 months. Very happy so far.</li>
    <li> Shaver is like shoes, the old one is always better. I think this is closest to my old one and will take time to become part of me.</li>
    <li> Bought it as a birthday gift for my Father who is 90. It works well on his face with wrinkles. It is easy to use....simple to operate.</li>
    <li> Use this azor every day . Glad I got it .</li>
    <li> Gives a nice close shave.</li>
    <li> I like it.  The charge last a really long time.  The cut is good.</li>
    <li> It works, a bit noisy compared to similar and even upgraded versions of this 3 headed model.  Battery last OK.  It shaves. I&#x27;m happy.</li>
    <li> The shaver came with no power cord. The reason I kept it was because I had an old cord from an old machine. Also, I didn&#x27;t think it was worth the hassle to return it and wait for new one.</li>
    <li> This was the perfect starter shaver for my 16-year-old son.  It is a basic, no-frills model -- priced right.</li>
    <li> I prefer Norelco over any other brand. I&#x27;ve never had a problem with there products and I would recommend Norelco to other people who choose to use an Electric Shaver over a blade.</li>
    <li> Hard to beat for the price, but I wish it was waterproof like my last one. Hard to complain for the price though.</li>
    <li> Blades aren&#x27;t very sharp. Snags hair consistently.  Beard trimmer also not very sharp blades do not move move fast enough. I realize that traditional Electric Razor like remington twin blades and the Braun shavers are the best option for me.</li>
    <li> Product met requirements and was delivered in a timely manner.</li>
    <li> Bought as a gift. Good reliable razor overall. Doesn&#x27;t quite shave as close as a blade. But satisfactory overall.</li>
    <li> Razor gives a reasonably close shave which serves my needs now. I consider this a very good deal re: price and very fast delivery.</li>
    <li> good inexpensive spare shaver</li>
    <li> Although I did not buy this at Amazon and it was given to me as a gift this is a good general electric shaver. The original blades didn&#x27;t hold up very well and replaced them as they do need to be replaced at least once a year. I went over a year with mine. So it got irritating to shave with dull blades. I replaced them with the HQ56 replacement blades and I believe they are much better blades than what were originally installed from the factory. I alternate between my wet shaver system and this. My beard being on the heavier side, if I go more than 2 days between shaves I have to wet shave because this shaver cannot handle it and it gets bogged down very easily. For me I have to use this shaver no less than every other day. It does a good job so I don&#x27;t look like a homeless guy but there isn&#x27;t any electric shaver on the market that can get you as close as wet shaving can. I call this shaver the lazy man&#x27;s shaver if you&#x27;re in a hurry and you do not have the time to go through the ritual of getting yourself prepared for a close clean shave from wet shaving. A good idea though I have found is spring for some Williams&#x27; Lectric Shave lotion for a better shave with an electric shaver. But all and all this is a good basic electric shaver and on an 8 hour charge you can get 35+ minutes of cordless shaving which is kind of cool. You can still plug it in and shave with it as well. But the cord can be a pain in the a** and gets in the way.</li>
    <li> I bought it for my father-in-law who is 92 and he loves it. It was easy to use and clean. Good price also.</li>
    <li> Performed as expected</li>
    <li> What a great value and super fast shipping - I highly recommend this item!</li>
    <li> I had another Norelco that after 20 years wore out. This one does a nice job in replacing the old one.</li>
    <li> Works great. I can get a nice close cut. Not sure on how long the battery power lasts but I was able to shave twice and battery still seems to have plenty of power.</li>
    <li> Have used Norelco for years, this seems as good as the previous model.</li>
    <li> Works like a champ! Easy to clean, light weight, and also very quiet.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m an established adult male with many years of shaving experience.  On a scale of 1 to 10 where 1 is the lightest and 10 is the heaviest beard, I&#x27;d say I have a 7.  I grow hair on my face fairly fast and if I were a normal person, I would have to shave every day.  I say it that way because I also have sensitive skin on my neck and if I shaved every day, I would literally destroy my neck, even with the most careful of shaves with the newest razor.  So I shave once or twice a week followed up with a [[ASIN:B004QWST7Y beard trimmer]] to keep things acceptable until my next shave.  When I do shave these days, I normally use a [[ASIN:B003KWO3UI Gillette Fusion Proglide]] with good [[ASIN:B0084GVSWG Italian shaving cream]] applied with a [[ASIN:B003WR3QSG badger hair shaving brush]].  I shave with a light touch and generally, only in the down direction.  I finish up with a [[ASIN:B003LEXEDW RazoRock alum block]].  The whole method works great and I&#x27;m left with a close shave with almost no irritation, which is especially important for my neck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But I wanted something to supplement my cartridge shaves.  Something quick and carefree.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enter the Phillips Norelco Rechargeable cordless razor, or so I thought.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Phillips-Norelco comes with a coiled cord which stretches out to about 6 feet when uncoiled, a cleaning brush and a protective cover for the shave heads.  The device itself fits in the hand nicely, although it is a little top heavy.  It&#x27;s either on or off and the power switch is coated in non-slip rubber.  Note that this particular razor is not waterproof.  It as a pop-up beard trimmer on the back to trim sideburns and the like, but is not meant to groom a full beard.  The three shave heads float individually so that they can more easily conform to the curves of the face - this is a compound mechanism - The three mounts each spring in towards the center and the three actual round blades float on them.  It&#x27;s very floaty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I charged it up for eight hours and gave it a try on a three-day beard.  Unfortunately, even though the device has a green light to indicate the battery is charging, it has no indication of a full charge or the charge state when using the device.  I imagine such features are reserved for more expensive models.  The shave started out normally.  The razor was quieter than I expected, but it had sort of an unrefined grinding sound to it.  I could feel the floaty heads floating.  I did what I thought was a decent job, avoiding my sideburns and trying to keep light, even pressure and a circular motion.  Unfortunately, right after I finished, I started to feel a burning sensation, especially around my lower neck.  My lower neck started to get splotchy red, irritated and it burned a lot.  I used my [[ASIN:B003LEXEDW RazoRock alum block]] to calm it down but it still burned for hours afterwards.  Even worse, the splotchy red marks on my lower neck lasted for three days!  That was despite daily applications of the [[ASIN:B003LEXEDW RazoRock alum block]] which usually works like a charm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once nice thing was that most of my shaved beard was caught by the head assembly which pops off for easy cleaning.  That&#x27;s about the only good thing I can say about it so far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Okay, so my first experience with this didn&#x27;t go well.  I will try it again soon and report my findings.  It&#x27;s not like I&#x27;m new at shaving, but maybe I was using it wrong?it a try on a three-day beard.  Unfortunately, even though the device has a green light to indicate the battery is charging, it has no indication of a full charge or the charge state when using the device.  I imagine such features are reserved for more expensive models.  The shave started out normally.  The razor was quieter than I expected, but it had sort of an unrefined grinding sound to it.

    <li> I am trying to figure out why my son has constant stubble, so I used his razor.  Shaved twice, both times using Pre Shave, and It looks like I haven&#x27;t touched it.  I am looking for another model and am surprised by the number of high ratings for this razor.</li>
    <li> Norelco razors are always good! Every year or so I bay a new razor rather than replacement blades because the cost differential is small.  I donate, after thoroughly cleaning and sanitizing, to a local charity that assists people in emergencies such as their house burning down and they are left with nothing but the shirts on their backs.</li>
    <li> Very quite and a closer shave than I expected. Closer than my old foil razor and so much more pleasant to use.  And you can get replacement heads, hp56 I believe. The info came in the box.</li>
    <li> This razor is VERY GOOD for the price. If I had to do it over again, I would pay a little more and get a better model. For the price though, it is good.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t like this razor.  Too hard to reassemble when parts fall out while cleaning.  Never again.</li>
    <li> Good product. Great delivery time. Arrived as promised. Love Amazon.</li>
    <li> Good product for the money!</li>
    <li> My first electric razor and I absolutely love it. It gives you a close shave and is pretty quick, the blades only need to be replaced once a year, and the hair gets sucked in making it easy to clean up. Honestly for the price you can&#x27;t really ask for more. Just don&#x27;t forget to charge it or it will pull your hairs, which sucks. All in all a great product.</li>
    <li> This is my sons first razor. He uses it a couple times a week and looks so much better. No razor burn or problems at all. He likes it a lot.</li>
    <li> Very happy with this purchase</li>
    <li> Ordered it last week and received just 3 days later with normal shipping from Amazon.  I was worried about power based on several other reviews, but find it is fine.  I do wish it blinked or something so I&#x27;d know it was fully charged.  Although advertised as \\&quot;close shave\\&quot;, which is marked on packaging and on the actual blade covers, I find it is actually not as close a shave as provided by tow ancient Norelco shaves I&#x27;ve had about 15 years without ever changing the blades.  The shave isn&#x27;t irritating, although that&#x27;s probably due to the lack of closeness.  My facial hair is light colored though, so the constant 5 o&#x27;clock shadow isn&#x27;t noticeable.  For $30 bucks, I&#x27;m very pleased.  UPDATE:  After using it for a week, the shave became closer.  Perhaps the blades just need to be \\&quot;broken in\\&quot;.  It also does an adequate job on my neck, which previous electric shaves have not been able to do.</li>
    <li> Love this little shaver!  I&#x27;ve had a few electrics in my life, and decided to try this out - the price was right, and it had good reviews.  I was very pleasantly surprised to see that it does, indeed, give you a close shave.  The trimmer attachment works well, too - not something that I&#x27;ve been pleased with in the past with other shavers. I would definitely recommend this Norelco!</li>
    <li> GREAT CORDLESS SHAVER I HAD A BEARD FOR 20 YEARS ONE DAY SHAVED IT OFF AND I NEEDED A GOOD ELECTRIC SHAVER. I BOUGHT THIS SHAVER IT IS THE BEST.</li>
    <li> It works well for me. I like it very much.</li>
    <li> Quiet, close shave, well designed.  Seems perfect in every way.</li>
    <li> Shaver is all that I? expected. I am happy with the item</li>
    <li> My husband needed a new shaver and we bought Norelco because my husband used this brand in the past. My husband is a senior and said that he didn&#x27;t need all the bells and whistles so I researched and purchased this one.  My husband is very pleased and said that this gives him a close shave and is easy to use.</li>
    <li> A nearly exact replacement for the older shaver I had been using for many years, with the battery dead and the motor slowly dying. I look forward to using this for quite a few years. I have a beard, so I don&#x27;t have to shave a whole lot of my face, but I trim my mustache daily, trim the edges of my beard periodically, and shave under my chin.</li>
    <li> Just like it...it matches what I paid.</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with this model from Norelco.  I have used Norelco electric razors for over 30 years and it seems that the more expensive and fancier models don&#x27;t shave as well as this more basic one.  Great and close shave with this razor!</li>
    <li> Works better than I thought it would.</li>
    <li> This is a fine razor. Need I say more ?</li>
    <li> I was using a 20+ year old Norelco 5885 XL.  It lasted that long because I  was able to change the battery when it would no longer  hold a charge.  Had considered buying one of the higher priced Norelco Razors.  Have found from reading reviews that because most of them are wet/dry razors  all of them are sealed and there is no way to change the re-chargeable battery.  This razor, so far, has worked very well giving me the kind of shave I have come to expect from Norelco.  There are 2 screws visisble in the handle so it looks like the battery may be replaceable. But even if it&#x27;s not, I can buy another new one 5 or 6 times over and still not pay as much for one the more expensive ones.</li>
    <li> Excellent product. I never tried an electric shaver before and it was so intuitive and easy to use that i was surprised.</li>
    <li> great shaver,great product</li>
    <li> great shaver at a good price</li>
    <li> I buy the cheapest Norelco I can find each year instead of buying new razor heads (only a couple of dollars more).  I like the Norelco and in my experience the expensive ones are no better than the low cost ones.  I&#x27;ve used Norelco for years and really like them.</li>
    <li> I bought one as gift for my friend in China during the thanksgivings. Today I open it, but it doesnot work at all. I&#x27;m very sad.But I don&#x27;t have time to return it as I will go back China during Christmas. Good news is that it is not that expensive.&lt;br /&gt;One of my friend here also bought one, his seems very good.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not the lucky man.</li>
    <li> The 6948XL shaves perfectly.  I have always received excellent products &amp; performance from Phillips Norelco.</li>
    <li> you get what you paid for here.</li>
    <li> Had it just a short time, but so far very quiet and a nice close shave</li>
    <li> This was one of the best gifts I&#x27;ve gotten my husband. He can shave while driving to work, so convenient!</li>
    <li> My husband loves it.  Smooth shave with no pulling.</li>
    <li> still using it a year later and it works great. Great value, and I&#x27;ve had no problems at all with this.</li>
    <li> shaves great clouse &amp; fast  wh</li>
    <li> Easy to use.  Does great job.</li>
    <li> Does exactly how it should. Love it.</li>
    <li> Need to charge more than instructions indicate</li>
    <li> The older one we have had for over 12 years, and it was time to replace.  Perfect for our need.</li>
    <li> A decent shaver for the price but nothing like the older version. I purchased the silver, older model many years ago and this newer version is simply put a cheaply made newer shaver. The older one was waterproof, had a much longer cord and as far a the battery is concerned their is no comparison. The old one held a charge through many, many shaves while this one only a few. The cord is so short it barely reaches from my outlet which is right next the bathroom sink to where I shave at the sink. It appears Norelco like so many other manufacturers have economized on a really outstanding product and made it mediocre instead of raising the price a bit. I am disappointed with the results.</li>
    <li> Just too underpowered. Pulls on hairs even after fully charging, but It did perform a mediocre shave. If I didn&#x27;t have to pay return shipping I would return it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had an earlier version of this shaver for what must have been around seven years. I should have replaced it a long time ago or maybe just the blades. Sure, they got a little dull, but it still worked quite well for me so I stuck with it. The battery died eventually, but I was always near an outlet so no biggie there either. Finally it stopped turning on entirely, so I bought this new one. I can&#x27;t say it&#x27;s worked for me for 7+ years, but I can say it feels just like if not better than the old one, and the benefit of fresh blades is something I noticed right away. I still use the trimmer first, of course, but what a good job it does! The trimmer does a really good job and gets surprisingly close, and then the circular blades take care of the rest. I&#x27;m glad I stuck with the same brand.</li>
    <li> First one sharp enough to give me a clean shave.</li>
    <li> Enough for basic use.</li>
    <li> Norelco shavers are the best</li>
    <li> Insanely cheap yet seems to me to be as good as the Norelco I purchased 12 years ago for twice as much money. Very happy I bought this.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t need fancy, just needed functional. These tend to last many years with minimal maintenance. Good product.</li>
    <li> Gives a good shave, great for those &amp;#34;I&#x27;m in a hurry shaves&amp;#34;. Cleans you up and gets you look back up to snuff in just a little bit. Cuts much better than the old electric I had years ago. This does not cut as close as my double edge razors and you have to shave more often but it so easy with this unit you will not mind.</li>
    <li> Works great for the price.</li>
    <li> It shaves close, easy to keep clean and has a long interal between charging&lt;br /&gt;Ed</li>
    <li> Does not do a good job shaving</li>
    <li> Got this for my grandpa, and he says it&#x27;s amazing!</li>
    <li> Such price can buy it, I feel very good! For his father, he liked it</li>
    <li> Great inexpensive electric razor.  I was very pleased to find that it cut my beard very close without repeated passes over the same area.  I love the popup trimmer for sideburns and around the top of ears.</li>
    <li> I ordered this for my husband and he&#x27;s very happy with it. Good price and fast shipping.</li>
    <li> This was a gift for my brother.  He told me he was very happy with this Philips Norelco shaver.</li>
    <li> I lke them, good product and price.  Quick delivery.</li>
    <li> You get what you pay for! To rough my face shaving. Buy a more expensive model!</li>
    <li> Works well for the price</li>
    <li> I bought this a few months ago and so far it&#x27;s still working.  At first I wasn&#x27;t getting a close shave.  In fact, I was barely getting a shave at all. But as promised in the instructions, my beard has adapted to the electric shaver, and I get a reasonably close shave.  I&#x27;m never going back to a razor.</li>
    <li> all that we expected !!</li>
    <li> Great Little razor.  I had to move from a blade to an electric due to being put on blood thinners.  I wasn&#x27;t happy about the thought of giving up my razor for what I thought would be an inferior electric shave. Was I ever wrong.  This thing shaves way closer than my blade.  Nice and fast and easy, and I can go over and over any tough spots for the perfect shave.  By and around my nose and chin has NOT been a problem, a great job there.  My neck is now nice and easy with no nics or cuts with a very close and smooth shave.  I just go over it a couple different directions and I get it all nice and smooth and comfortable.  Way faster than the blade, way closer than the blade.  And if I want to do a quick touch up after 5PM I don&#x27;t even mind doing it with this Norelco 6948XL.  Glad I got it!!!</li>
    <li> After months of using the motor seems to be giving up even though is fully charge</li>
    <li> Works decently, would like it more if it was water proof. Decent shave, good for on the run or a quick touch up</li>
    <li> Purchased for an elderly man with Parkinson&#x27;s. He has no trouble using it and seems very pleased.</li>
    <li> i love .i use it every day .</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband as he had been wanting one for some time now and wouldn&#x27;t pay the $60+ to get it.  I found it on Amazon for less than $35 so I decided to get it.  When he got home from work, he immediately tried it and said he loved it.  It has a cord but once charged, you can also unplug it and use as cordless.  I was skeptical at first, but when it says it gives a close shave, it isn&#x27;t kidding.  It was such a close shave it felt as smooth as can be.  I really love it myself because now there is no chin stubble that rubs me when we kiss.  So yay for both of us.  I highly recommend this shaver.  Says what it does and does what it says.  Great purchase.</li>
    <li> Pleasantly surprised.  Provides many shaves on one charge.  Very quiet, much quieter than the previous two similar designs.  The same replacement heads work on this one.  Provides an excellent shave.</li>
    <li> This works as intended. There&#x27;s nothing amazing about it. The product just works and does the job it was built for. No complaints.</li>
    <li> Does a really good job.  Shaves closely without any irritation.  Lightweight and easy to handle.</li>
    <li> Used by my grandfather about 6 times before it all fell apart. Horrible investment. Better to spend an extra $20 for better quality. Never owned an electric haver that lasted so little.</li>
