      <li>Cute</li>
      <li>My 14 year old daughter loved these!</li>
      <li>excellent thanks so much</li>
      <li>They are kind of large but still cute.</li>
      <li>good presentation, colors the same that picture, great quality, and fit very well on my hand, looks very cute ;)</li>
      <li>Overall great quality, cute bag they came in, and pretty bracelets!</li>
      <li>The straps that wrap around are plastic, but despite that it doesn&#x27;t look cheap.</li>
      <li>I am happy with them especially considering the price.</li>
      <li>So far, my daughter and one of my good friends BOTH have tried to bribe me into given them one of them.</li>
      <li>Came fast, lovely quality, will enjoy wearing.  </li>
      <li>Well when they came I was surprised at how nice they were.</li>
      <li>it makes her look cool.  </li>
      <li>Super cute&lt;br</li>
      <li>But the rubber string immediately came apart from the fastening clamp the very first time I wore it.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a durable quality, and the best part is if you wet it time after time it won&#x27;t rot like other bracelets because it&#x27;s made out of a plastic material</li>
      <li>So pretty and arrived fast!</li>
      <li>These bracelets came much sooner than I expected which I was very pleased with.</li>
      <li>They look exactly as pictured.</li>

      <li>Exactly as you see in the picture.</li>
      <li>Its a quick fix with some super glue but wish it was made a little better.</li>
      <li>The chain has gotten caught on a few things but besides that,  I love it!</li>
      <li>I highly recommend!</li>
      <li>VERY WELL MADE...</li>
      <li>Pleasantly surprised at how pretty they are in person.</li>
      <li>Blue bead faded to white very quickly (within 1 week?)</li>
      <li>These bracelets are pretty enough.</li>
      <li>One broke the first day - had to push a piece back in and glue it.</li>
      <li>I would have like a blue instead of the white or the red but, for the price, these colors are fine.  </li>
      <li>my 9y old daughter loves this cause</li>
      <li>Only thing I don&#x27;t like is how the blue Center is a light blue but the blue bracelet Is actually a teal blue/green, if the Bracelet was blue Like the center I would be happier</li>

<li> Not good for everyday use maybe just for special occasions.</li>
<li> (i wanted a layered effect) and I wear them every SINGLE day since I received them (wash dishes, bathe wash clothes) in these bracelets, and must say that I am suprised that they have NOT turned color considering its not real gold.</li>

<li> THAN I EXPECTED...</li>
<li> closed to prevent the strings from coming apart.  </li>
<li> THE HAMSA IS SUPPOSED TO PROTECT FROM THE EVIL AND BRING WEALTH AND HAPPINESS.</li>
<li> One was broken when it arrived, but it was easily fixed.</li>
<li> My son passed away this year and our family members wear the bracelet everyday in remembrance of him.&lt;br /&gt;Since they are inexpensive, they wear out -  </li>
<li> I mean they have turned a little</li>
<li> but didn&#x27;t even last a day :( not durable.</li>
<li> They break very easily poor quality.</li>
<li> but I only received one piece, very disappointed!</li>
<li> It was horrible, if I were you I wouldn&#x27;t get it</li>

    <li> good presentation, colors the same that picture, great quality, and fit very well on my hand, looks very cute ;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;0</li>
    <li> It was horrible, if I were you I wouldn&#x27;t get it it&#x27;s not worth it just to wear for 3 days, it turned green to fast.</li>
    <li> they were okay I wanted them for gifts but they look rusty already</li>
    <li> excellent thanks so much</li>
    <li> They break very easily poor quality.</li>
    <li> The bracelets are nice. Only thing I don&#x27;t like is how the blue Center is a light blue but the blue bracelet Is actually a teal blue/green, if the Bracelet was blue Like the center I would be happier</li>
    <li> So pretty and arrived fast! Thank you</li>
    <li> Cute and looks just like in the picture. The straps that wrap around are plastic, but despite that it doesn&#x27;t look cheap. Adorable and perfect for every day wear. Recommended!</li>
    <li> i have bought these bracelets before and I loved it! For some reason, the second time I got them the sizing was bigger.</li>
    <li> Absolutely loved them!  One was broken when it arrived, but it was easily fixed. And the price can&#x27;t be beat!</li>
    <li> Loved these bracelets very good quality and they are adjustable. You get what you see and that is all four bracelets in the colors shown. Mine came on time and even individually wrapped with tags. I love them and will buy from his seller again! I highly recommend!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a durable quality, and the best part is if you wet it time after time it won&#x27;t rot like other bracelets because it&#x27;s made out of a plastic material</li>
    <li> These bracelets came much sooner than I expected which I was very pleased with. They look exactly as pictured. I am happy with them especially considering the price.</li>
    <li> They&#x27;re pretty, I wear them every day.</li>
    <li> my 9y old daughter loves this cause it makes her look cool.  plus she loves the shiny design and the different colors.</li>
    <li> Well when they came I was surprised at how nice they were. My roommates loved them and they fit perfectly. However a day later the strings (plastic) popped out of the clasp and broke. Its a quick fix with some super glue but wish it was made a little better. All in all though a great gift!</li>
    <li> Bracelets are just as they were described. They are really nice. I bought 4 at one time (i wanted a layered effect) and I wear them every SINGLE day since I received them (wash dishes, bathe wash clothes) in these bracelets, and must say that I am suprised that they have NOT turned color considering its not real gold. I mean they have turned a little but nothing that anyone would notice.  So far, my daughter and one of my good friends BOTH have tried to bribe me into given them one of them.</li>
    <li> These are very cute. I would have like a blue instead of the white or the red but, for the price, these colors are fine.  The value is excellent.</li>
    <li> My son passed away this year and our family members wear the bracelet everyday in remembrance of him.&lt;br /&gt;Since they are inexpensive, they wear out -  but we just replace if needed.  I have purcheased many sets to get us through years to come.</li>
    <li> These bracelets are pretty enough. But the rubber string immediately came apart from the fastening clamp the very first time I wore it. This has happened on 2 of the 4 bracelets.  I have not worn all 4 yet.  I used a plier to squeeze the fastener closed to prevent the strings from coming apart.  That seems to work for now.</li>
    <li> LOVE IT. BOUGHT FOR MY FRIENDS AND MYSELF. BE HAPPY AT THE END.  THE HAMSA IS SUPPOSED TO PROTECT FROM THE EVIL AND BRING WEALTH AND HAPPINESS. HOPE IT WORKS</li>
    <li> Two of them broke the day I received the item.</li>
    <li> They are kind of large but still cute.</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t had any problems with breakage. Very cute, and worn with stackables.</li>
    <li> Love them. I have gotten so many compliments and people have gone online to buy them for themselves.</li>
    <li> Absolutely beautiful. Exactly as you see in the picture. Arrived one week sooner than delivery date. Well packaged. 👍</li>
    <li> These bracelets are beautiful! I love them &amp; love that the package came with 4 colors! Overall great quality, cute bag they came in, and pretty bracelets!</li>
    <li> estan muuy bonita , solo que una de ellas se le despego una correa son de platico solo que la pegue con un poco de brillo para unas y bua ala lista de nuevo !!!!</li>
    <li> Great Christmas buy!!!</li>
    <li> Super cute&lt;br /&gt; I loved the way it was packaged! The chain has gotten caught on a few things but besides that,  I love it!</li>
    <li> DELIVERY WAS AS STATED... WERE SMALLER THAN I EXPECTED... VERY WELL MADE... WOULD HAVE TO SELL TO A YOUNGER CLIENTS DUE TO SIZE</li>
    <li> its state it that there will be 4 pieces but I only received one piece, very disappointed!</li>
    <li> Very cheap. Blue bead faded to white very quickly (within 1 week?) Bought these for a group of 4 girlfriends but I don&#x27;t feel comfortable giving them something that&#x27;s such bad quality.</li>
    <li> you get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> Came fast, lovely quality, will enjoy wearing.  Recommend you purchase to wear as a set on your arm</li>
    <li> My 14 year old daughter loved these! They look like what you see in the pictures displayed. We were happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> Nice, although it is plastic</li>
    <li> Pleasantly surprised at how pretty they are in person. One broke the first day - had to push a piece back in and glue it. Shipping takes quite a while, but it did arrive sooner than they said it would.</li>
