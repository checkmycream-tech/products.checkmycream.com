### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>but Amazon probably has the best price on it anywhere.</li>
      <li>I literally can&#x27;t believe my eyes when I see good reviews on this shampoo!  </li>
      <li>Great product.</li>
      <li>A truly all-natural shampoo that leaves hair feeling great.</li>
      <li>It rinses out great.</li>
      <li>have shoulder-length wavy (not curly) fine-ish (but a good amount of it) hair.  </li>
      <li>it got me good then, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>A hair conditioner with more &amp;#34;conditioning&amp;#34; would be great.</li>
      <li>This shampoo smells amazing.</li>
      <li>Himalaya Hydrating Shampoo is a great shampoo that is free from gluten, Sodium Lauryl Sulfate (SLS), Parabens, Silicones, and Phthalates.  </li>
      <li>I liked it.</li>
      <li>amazing sodium free shampoo!</li>
      <li>In most cases, I can see why someone may have a differing opinion on a product than my own, but this isn&#x27;t one of those times.  </li>
      <li>I love this stuff.</li>
      <li>I could still smell it after washing again with a better shampoo.</li>
      <li>Love the shampoo...</li>
      <li>Love Himalaya Botanique&#x27;s line and Himalaya&#x27;s line of herbal remedies.</li>
      <li>It wouldn&#x27;t even fit into a ponytail, it was so fuzzy, matted and uncontrollable!  </li>
      <li>(I use their toothpaste and love it).  </li>
      <li>Nice mild fragrance.</li>
      <li>It was like using a mixture of sand and clay and would&#x27;t rinse out easily.  </li>
      <li>And to add insult to injury, the smell is so strong</li>
      <li>/&gt;so, if you&#x27;re looking for a super intense clean, this may be great for you.</li>
      <li>Himalaya has it priced great value for such super ingredients both what is in it and what is not in it!</li>
      <li>perfect for keratine treatments and everyday use!</li>
      <li>so was excited to see Himalaya had a line for this</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m willing to sacrafice a bit to use better products for me</li>
      <li>/&gt;once rinsed out, my hair feels squeaky clean.</li>
      <li>This shampoo left my hair feeling good but didn&#x27;t care for the fragrance of the shampoo....</li>
      <li>It does a great job of cleaning my scalp too whereas other shampoos may be leave it itchy.  </li>
      <li>Super fresh and invigorating in the morning.</li>
      <li>This natural shampoo enriched with a unique blend of rich botanicals like Aloe Vera and Fenugreek, hydrates and nourishes hair roots.</li>
      <li>Yeah it makes hairs rough when washed but when  the water is soaked hairs looks nice...</li>
      <li>I am on a quest to find a good all-natural, no animal testing shampoo that actually works well for me, and this is definitely not it.</li>
      <li>volumizing shampoo was used once on my daughter&#x27;s fine, naturally blonde hair (she is 5).  </li>
      <li>I really like the shampoo.</li>
      <li>very quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
      <li>i find it a bit much.</li>
      <li>It is very concentrated.  </li>
      <li>and then there was halloween when i had so much product in my hair</li>
      <li>and kind of dried out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>the other hand, i did have a stretch where i went a couple days without showering and then went to the gym, and it was just the right amount of clean for me then.</li>
      <li>I was really excited about having found my \\&quot;perfect\\&quot; new natural shampoo when the hubby finally told me it STUNK!  </li>
      <li>I am really determined to find natural haircare</li>
      <li>The method is to drop about a 1.5 tablespoon size blob in your hand (note I have longer hair), lather it up in your hands really well, run your hair underwater RIGHT before you apply (hair needs to be soaking wet)</li>
      <li>As earlier reviewers expereinced, this along with most natural shampoos are not fun to apply-</li>
      <li>So, back to my herbal essense I went straight away.  </li>
      <li>It was completely unbelieveable.  </li>
      <li>Love the thick texture.  </li>
      <li>as in, when i use it i have to use a little on the front, put more in my hand, put a little on each side, put more in my hand, put a little in the back, then use lots of shower water to dilute it and get it</li>
      <li>or rather, not a daily shampoo unless the pores on your head take \\&quot;oily\\&quot; to new and uncharted levels.</li>
      <li>Have been  using for a year now, and don&#x27;t see changing in the near future.</li>
      <li>you put it in, you can barely get your fingers through to your roots and you have to keep re-applying.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Maybe if someone is desperately crunchy enough to need to use a natural product they&#x27;d be better off using a mixture of real mud and sand, like they used to do before soap was invented.  </li>
      <li>However, the reason I feel this Hydrading shampoo has serious potential is, I&#x27;ve found a good method that only works with this shampoo (note I&#x27;ve tried 4 other brands plus himalaya&#x27;s other shampoo product \\&quot;Rejuvenating Shampoo\\&quot; and</li>
      <li>A tiny pearl does my full head of thick short hair.  </li>

    <li> Great product. Love the thick texture.  Nice mild fragrance.</li>
    <li> This really has to be the worst shampoo I&#x27;ve ever tried. I am on a quest to find a good all-natural, no animal testing shampoo that actually works well for me, and this is definitely not it. The shampoo is thick, tar-like goop that does not lather at all and is difficult to work through. Despite claiming to be moisturizing, it stripped all of the moisture from my hair, to the point that it was difficult to work their thin, worthless conditioner through. And to add insult to injury, the smell is so strong it&#x27;s nauseating. I could still smell it after washing again with a better shampoo. I&#x27;d rate it zero stars if I could.</li>
    <li> Himalaya Hydrating Shampoo is a great shampoo that is free from gluten, Sodium Lauryl Sulfate (SLS), Parabens, Silicones, and Phthalates.  It is very concentrated.  A tiny pearl does my full head of thick short hair.  It does a great job of cleaning my scalp too whereas other shampoos may be leave it itchy.  This natural shampoo enriched with a unique blend of rich botanicals like Aloe Vera and Fenugreek, hydrates and nourishes hair roots. Hibiscus, Licorice and Chebulic Myrobalan revitalize and provide moisture to your hair and scalp.  Himalaya has it priced great value for such super ingredients both what is in it and what is not in it!</li>
    <li> or rather, not a daily shampoo unless the pores on your head take \\&quot;oily\\&quot; to new and uncharted levels. and CERTAINLY not hydrating. quite the opposite.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;it doesn&#x27;t spread well. as in, when i use it i have to use a little on the front, put more in my hand, put a little on each side, put more in my hand, put a little in the back, then use lots of shower water to dilute it and get it moving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;once rinsed out, my hair feels squeaky clean. almost literally. and kind of dried out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;on the other hand, i did have a stretch where i went a couple days without showering and then went to the gym, and it was just the right amount of clean for me then. and then there was halloween when i had so much product in my hair i was petrified whenever someone flicked a cigarette lighter around me for fear that i, too, might ignite. it got me good then, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;so, if you&#x27;re looking for a super intense clean, this may be great for you. i find it a bit much. i use it about once a month. i can&#x27;t bring myself to throw it away because it does serve a purpose and it was expensive.</li>
    <li> Used the hydrating shampoo.  Should have purchased the conditioner as well.  Next time.</li>
    <li> liking it ...it controls my hair fall.Yeah it makes hairs rough when washed but when  the water is soaked hairs looks nice...</li>
    <li> This shampoo smells amazing. I only wish it were a bit less expensive but Amazon probably has the best price on it anywhere. Super fresh and invigorating in the morning.</li>
    <li> I am really determined to find natural haircare so was excited to see Himalaya had a line for this (I use their toothpaste and love it).  As earlier reviewers expereinced, this along with most natural shampoos are not fun to apply- you put it in, you can barely get your fingers through to your roots and you have to keep re-applying.  However, the reason I feel this Hydrading shampoo has serious potential is, I&#x27;ve found a good method that only works with this shampoo (note I&#x27;ve tried 4 other brands plus himalaya&#x27;s other shampoo product \\&quot;Rejuvenating Shampoo\\&quot; and this method did not work with any of them).  The method is to drop about a 1.5 tablespoon size blob in your hand (note I have longer hair), lather it up in your hands really well, run your hair underwater RIGHT before you apply (hair needs to be soaking wet), you&#x27;ll get the same effect you&#x27;re used to with regular shampoos.  I was really excited about having found my \\&quot;perfect\\&quot; new natural shampoo when the hubby finally told me it STUNK!  He said it smelt like indian spices and not in a good way :-(  So, back to my herbal essense I went straight away.  I&#x27;m willing to sacrafice a bit to use better products for me but there&#x27;s no way I&#x27;m sacraficing how I smell! :-(</li>
    <li> In most cases, I can see why someone may have a differing opinion on a product than my own, but this isn&#x27;t one of those times.  I literally can&#x27;t believe my eyes when I see good reviews on this shampoo!  I bought two bottles on sale (wonder why) at a vitamin store, but I hate them so much I had to post here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have shoulder-length wavy (not curly) fine-ish (but a good amount of it) hair.  To look at it, you&#x27;d call it normal or average.  I recently bought both the hydrating shampoo for myself, and the volumizing shampoo for my daughter.  I can deal with the strange goopiness, but it stripped my hair SO badly that I looked like a dry fuzzy lion all day.  We are talking Rosanna Rosanna Danna from SNL hair.  No amount of thick conditioner or leave-on products that I usually use, could help -- nor did it help when I tried to wet it down.  It wouldn&#x27;t even fit into a ponytail, it was so fuzzy, matted and uncontrollable!  I tried it twice (in case I mistook something else for the shampoo&#x27;s effect) to no avail.  Add to that the disgusting smell that kept wafting into my face hours after I used it, and the fact that my husband looked closely at the top of my head and asked me what strange product I&#x27;d COATED my hair with, and this became a garbage product very quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The volumizing shampoo was used once on my daughter&#x27;s fine, naturally blonde hair (she is 5).  It was like using a mixture of sand and clay and would&#x27;t rinse out easily.  Again, conditioner didn&#x27;t help.  TONS of leave-in detangler wouldn&#x27;t help me comb through it even with a wide-tooth comb.  It was completely unbelieveable.  She was crying her eyes out and I was left with shards of her hair shafts in my comb.  Garbage, garbage, garbage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe if someone is desperately crunchy enough to need to use a natural product they&#x27;d be better off using a mixture of real mud and sand, like they used to do before soap was invented.  Otherwise, stay away.</li>
    <li> Love the shampoo...however its a bit thick!!! But works so well on the hair....</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll never use any other shampoo!</li>
    <li> Have been  using for a year now, and don&#x27;t see changing in the near future.</li>
    <li> I really like the shampoo. It is thick and doesn&#x27;t pull my on my hair. It rinses out great. I liked it.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. I have very thick long hair , the aloe in this really makes a difference. Softens the hair and cleans so well.</li>
    <li> amazing sodium free shampoo! perfect for keratine treatments and everyday use! i used to buy kerastase but I switched and won&#x27;t go back!</li>
    <li> I had a bad allegric reaction.  Both my scalp and hands are itching and pealing away.  It is impossible to know what caused it because there are so many indgredients.</li>
    <li> This shampoo left my hair feeling good but didn&#x27;t care for the fragrance of the shampoo....don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll purchase it again.</li>
    <li> A truly all-natural shampoo that leaves hair feeling great. Love Himalaya Botanique&#x27;s line and Himalaya&#x27;s line of herbal remedies. A hair conditioner with more &amp;#34;conditioning&amp;#34; would be great.</li>
