### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>overpriced.4star :D</li>
      <li>Very good for skin cleaning</li>
      <li>This peeling jelly is incredible.  </li>
      <li>I have been using this product for three years, and am happy to see that I can get it from Amazon and not have to stock up while in Korea.  </li>
      <li>Smells like grape bubble gum, LOL.</li>
      <li>Both have a pleasant grape/wine scent.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s as good as they say.</li>
      <li>and i&#x27;m so glad i did!</li>
      <li>am I glad I did!  </li>
      <li>Love Korean skin care!</li>
      <li>- then there is a kind of skin shedding feeling as the cream kind of coagulated under the finger tips.  </li>
      <li>I bought this since it was a cheaper version to the popular Cure.</li>
      <li>The smell is pleasant, like a sweet wine.  </li>
      <li>I will order more.</li>
      <li>When used on a cotton pad after makeup removal, it smells lovely, like grape jelly and cleans as a toner while exfoliating.  </li>
      <li>Love this stuff.</li>
      <li>Love this stuff.</li>
      <li>Honestly, this stuff is pretty amazing.</li>
      <li>It is very gentle, and smells good.</li>
      <li>I loved it so much I bought one for my mom</li>
      <li>I had no idea what to expect from this product, which was mentioned favorably in a New York Times travel article about shopping in Korea for beauty products, and there it was on Amazon at am extremely good price.  </li>
      <li>Leave my skin feeling smooth but also quite moist afterwards.</li>
      <li>I liked it so much, I just bought the Innisfree Wine Peeling Jelly Scrub.  </li>
      <li>Face feels smooth and clean afterwards.</li>
      <li>I am pretty cynical about skin care and cosmetic claims, but one nice thing about Korean ones, I can&#x27;t read any of their claims (or how to use the stuff), so good outcomes are more surprising than they would otherwise be.</li>
      <li>Jelly Softner keeps my skin looking bright and much younger.</li>
      <li>However this one is a lot more gentle on my skin</li>
      <li>I apply it by pouring a bit in my hand and rubbing fairly vigorously over my face, then rinsing and following quickly with a moisturizer.  </li>
      <li>Either way, I find it useful as it gets rid of excess oil for me.</li>
      <li>i love it and would recommend to anyone looking for soft, baby-like skin.</li>
      <li>it exfoliates without irritating and leaves your skin glowing and smelling like delicious grapes.</li>
      <li>My skin looks more supple and smooth than it has for a long time.  </li>
      <li>Such a nice gentle exfoliant!</li>
      <li>It smells divine and leaves your skin super soft and clean.  </li>
      <li>Very gentle and does the job without irritation to your skin.</li>
      <li>The Innisfree Wine Peeling Jelly Softener, wierd as it sounds is exactly that.  </li>
      <li>After rinsing off the skin is so soft and silky smooth.  </li>
      <li>I put it on my skin without washing first, rub it around a bit, then rinse it off.</li>
      <li>i tried this stuff a few years ago as a sample and loved it and had been meaning to order it but somehow forgot.</li>
      <li>Does leave my skin soft and fresh after use.  </li>
      <li>Fast shipping</li>
      <li>And it really works.  </li>
      <li>All I know is that I really like the way my skin feels</li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s any better than some other product one could buy locally.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Western exfoliating products rely on physical abrasion of the skin (all those scrubbing beads, rotating brushes, etc.), while this is more of a gentle chemical peel.  </li>
      <li>I have sensitive combo skin, and this stuff exfoliates my dry patches wonderfully without the roughness of big abrasive particles or the sting of harsh chemicals.</li>
      <li>It makes my face soft and smooth, and without any of the irritation that I have had from various scrubs.</li>
      <li>However, I have heard some theories say that it is not your dead skin cells but rather a specific ingredient mixing with the excess oil on your skin which I believe is true as it creates more pieces around my T-zone.</li>
      <li>I would highly recommend.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s quite interesting to see it create the little pieces on your skin.</li>
      <li>and it really helps to keep my face clear.  </li>
      <li>I read a review of Korean cosmetics in the New York Times.  </li>
      <li>I am using all new products, and something is working.  </li>
      <li>After reading about this item in the New York Times</li>
      <li>It goes on smoothly and as it is rubbed into the skin a slight granular sensation is felt</li>
      <li>It does leave your face remarkably soft afterwards.</li>
      <li>Wow.</li>
      <li>There are little very very gentle scrubby bits in here but the main exfoliation comes from rubbing the product until it pills up.</li>
      <li>The product has English instructions if you gently peel off the Korean instructions, the English instructions are underneath.   </li>
      <li>I have used it only twice, but so far it is living up to the hype.</li>
      <li>Within a few minutes you actually see exfoliation beginning and the &amp;#34;blackhead&amp;#34; -- dried pore oils come out on their own.  </li>
      <li>It smells grapey and has the consistency of a loose gel with a very fine and thinly dispersed grit.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Really gets rid of dead skin cells. Face feels smooth and clean afterwards. It doesn&#x27;t get rid of blackheads though.</li>
    <li> My friend had given me a sample to try and I was hooked immediately.  It smells divine and leaves your skin super soft and clean.  I use it about twice a week and it really helps to keep my face clear.  I loved it so much I bought one for my mom and she&#x27;s now hooked as well!  I would highly recommend.</li>
    <li> This was recently mentioned in an article in the travel section of the Sunday NYT.  I decided to give it a try &amp; boy am I glad I did!  I can&#x27;t believe the dead skin this product took off my face!  I liked it so much, I just bought the Innisfree Wine Peeling Jelly Scrub.  I recommend them both.  Both have a pleasant grape/wine scent.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for three years, and am happy to see that I can get it from Amazon and not have to stock up while in Korea.  Western exfoliating products rely on physical abrasion of the skin (all those scrubbing beads, rotating brushes, etc.), while this is more of a gentle chemical peel.  The smell is pleasant, like a sweet wine.  This gel causes the outermost skin layer to slough off in small pills without scrubbing.  Use a regular cotton pad to apply generously. Using it once or twice a week makes your skin glow.  I also use it on the backs of my hands and elbows, following with moisturizer.  Wine Peeling Jelly Softner keeps my skin looking bright and much younger. One can immediately see the difference.</li>
    <li> Additional information:   The product has English instructions if you gently peel off the Korean instructions, the English instructions are underneath.   I read a review of Korean cosmetics in the New York Times.  This was one of the recommended products.  It does smell like red wine. And it really works.  Within a few minutes you actually see exfoliation beginning and the &amp;#34;blackhead&amp;#34; -- dried pore oils come out on their own.  No scrubbing required.  Apply, wait a few minutes, and rinse off. Your skin will instantly feel and look smoother and glowing.</li>
    <li> Such a nice gentle exfoliant! Leave my skin feeling smooth but also quite moist afterwards. There are little very very gentle scrubby bits in here but the main exfoliation comes from rubbing the product until it pills up.</li>
    <li> Very good for skin cleaning</li>
    <li> I bought this since it was a cheaper version to the popular Cure. It has a scent similar to dimetapp grape flavour but I don&#x27;t mind. It&#x27;s quite interesting to see it create the little pieces on your skin. It does leave your face remarkably soft afterwards. However, I have heard some theories say that it is not your dead skin cells but rather a specific ingredient mixing with the excess oil on your skin which I believe is true as it creates more pieces around my T-zone. Either way, I find it useful as it gets rid of excess oil for me.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s as good as they say. Love this stuff. It&#x27;s a cross between a mask and a toner. Smell is to die for (if you like the smell of red wine).</li>
    <li> After reading about this item in the New York Times I knew I had to try it.  I have used it only twice, but so far it is living up to the hype. It is very gentle, and smells good.</li>
    <li> I also bought this after seeing the NYT article. Smells like red wine. It makes my face soft and smooth, and without any of the irritation that I have had from various scrubs. Honestly, this stuff is pretty amazing. I hope they will keep importing it. I have no idea what the instructions say, since they are in Korean. I put it on my skin without washing first, rub it around a bit, then rinse it off. After that, I just moisturize.&lt;br /&gt;If anyone can actually read the instructions, please tell us what they say!</li>
    <li> Smells like grape bubble gum, LOL. It works the same as other peeling gel out there such as cruel and you do need ti rinse it off after. However this one is a lot more gentle on my skin and I like that its alcohol-free. Does leave my skin soft and fresh after use.  Fast shipping but the product is overpriced.4star :D</li>
    <li> Wow. This peeling jelly is incredible.  I use it three times a week.  It goes on smoothly and as it is rubbed into the skin a slight granular sensation is felt - then there is a kind of skin shedding feeling as the cream kind of coagulated under the finger tips.  After rinsing off the skin is so soft and silky smooth.  I do not read Korean, so I don&#x27;t know if I am using the product correctly or often enough, or even not often enough.  All I know is that I really like the way my skin feels and I will purchase this product again.</li>
    <li> i tried this stuff a few years ago as a sample and loved it and had been meaning to order it but somehow forgot. i finally got around to it and i&#x27;m so glad i did! my skin has never felt softer! it exfoliates without irritating and leaves your skin glowing and smelling like delicious grapes. i love it and would recommend to anyone looking for soft, baby-like skin.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. I will order more. Very gentle and does the job without irritation to your skin.</li>
    <li> This is a second purchase . This has helped my facial skin a lot. I have sensitive combo skin, and this stuff exfoliates my dry patches wonderfully without the roughness of big abrasive particles or the sting of harsh chemicals. I use it every alternate day and am noticing that the dryness of my skin is going away and my skin is glowing . The container was actually a bit bigger than I thought .</li>
    <li> Gimmick!  Does not exfoliate at all.  Disappointed!</li>
    <li> When used on a cotton pad after makeup removal, it smells lovely, like grape jelly and cleans as a toner while exfoliating.  Love Korean skin care!</li>
    <li> I had no idea what to expect from this product, which was mentioned favorably in a New York Times travel article about shopping in Korea for beauty products, and there it was on Amazon at am extremely good price.  I have very dry skin, and with the horrid winter and necessity of constant heat, it was worse than usual, so I have been searching for help.

    <li> Don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s any better than some other product one could buy locally.&lt;br /&gt;Would not spend the money again for this.</li>
