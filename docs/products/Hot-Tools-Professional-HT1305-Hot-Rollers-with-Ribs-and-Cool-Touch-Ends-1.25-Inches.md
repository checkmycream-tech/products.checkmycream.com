<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Great product!  Rollers heat up quickly and give me a perfect curl!</li>
    <li> GREAT FOR TRAVELING AS IT TAKES VERY LITTLE SPACE IN YOUR SUITCASE..&lt;br /&gt;I LOVE IT AND RECOMMEND IT.  THANK YOU</li>
    <li> I have only used these curlers once. I will say they get very hot. I will be taking them on vacation.</li>
    <li> This roller set is small, convenient and just what I was looking for. I took it along on a trip to the UK and it worked great as it has dual-voltage. Only an adapter is needed with no need for a converter. The rollers do get very hot so you really have to handle them by the edges when rolling. They work well on my long hair. Another reviewer mentioned that one of the rollers would no longer heat up. I suggest pushing in the metal pin on the bottom of the roller after each use and before inserting them back on the heating rack. This might help if one of the rollers fails to heat up.</li>
    <li> I have searched through many stores looking for this particular hairsetter, and after many miles of no luck,turning to the internet was the best solution to this. When I travel, I like to have a fast easy solution to my thin hair. The compliments I get are also a good way of knowing that I found a good easy way to look good.</li>
    <li> Product arrived promptly as promised. I tested both sets and both were working. I already had an old set and have loved it for home and travel. Have never had a problem with it and that is why I wanted more.</li>
    <li> I can make no comment on how well the rollers work.  But they were not what I had ordered.  First, the \\&quot;Helen of Troy\\&quot; brand was not on them (as shown in the photo), only \\&quot;Hot Tools.\\&quot;  Second, the unit was very heavy---too heavy for travel.  Because I could not return the item if the plastic packaging was opened I could not test it out.  It might work well  but it was not what I ordered and that was a disappointment.  Therefore I give it 3 stars.</li>
    <li> I love this rollers. Small for travel and home use.</li>
    <li> I have used this set for years but forgot them when I went on vacation.  I bought another brand which broke after only a few uses. When i got home I looked on Amazon and was so happy to find the same set. Now I have a spare :-). Very compact, easily fits into a suitcase.</li>
    <li> I am sad that my Conair travel set is so old, and that Conair doesn&#x27;t seem to make them anymore. I&#x27;ve tried others but they didn&#x27;t heat evenly.  But these curlers seem to be doing the trick. I am very satisfied with them.</li>
    <li> I have the Hot Tools larger set of these for home use and needed more rollers than 5, so I got two sets.  They get super hot, roll up just fine, and it is compact and light for travel.  I stopped using pins for hot rollers many years ago.  Get the plastic clamp type from conair on amazon or Sally&#x27;s.  I have a few places that the plastic clamp puts a crimp in my hair, so I use the wire ones there.  Keep your fingers on the edges.  It gets hot!!</li>
    <li> Good for the price. Wife likes it for traveling</li>
    <li> After a lifetime of hot roller use, these are the very best hair rollers I have ever used. They heat up immediately.</li>
    <li> Bought these to take on an overseas trip because of the dual voltage.  The case and holder are compact and very well designed.  However, the curlers get very hot.  Unlike my decades old Set to Go by Clairol that has little knobs, the ribs don&#x27;t protect your fingers from getting burned.  I find it difficult to wrap the hair around the roller by holding on only to the cool ends.  Also, the ribs don&#x27;t grip the hair very well and the curlers slide around.  The curl is softer than I prefer.  I&#x27;ll keep them for the trip, but I&#x27;ll stick to my old set for every day.</li>
    <li> Gets too hot for my hands</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t know what to expect when I got these rollers. I didn&#x27;t exactly have high expectations, but as I&#x27;ve always used curling irons but found them to be ineffective and time consuming, I decided to try hot rollers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I travel a lot and it&#x27;s usually during travel when I want to look extra nice without lugging around a ton of hair products and tools.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Plug it in and after a couple minutes, roll them in your hair and clip/clamp. I would definitely buy the plastic clamping clips rather than these metal wire ones that are completely not secure. I typically proceed with my morning routine, brush up, wash my face apply skin care and after 10 minutes, I&#x27;ll take them out and whala! Supermodel hair. Though the curls loosen after one day, even the second or third day looks amazing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THIS IS THE ANSWER!</li>
    <li> Love them!  I have medium type hair and these rollers keep my hair curled all day!  Love them and would buy again.</li>
    <li> I bought these rollers to travel with and since I generally only use carry-on size bags, these were the smallest ones I could find.  I have taken them on several trips and am very pleased with them.  They pack easily and take up very little space. They do get very hot so even experienced hot roller users need to be careful.  Since I need 10-12 rollers for my hair, I appreciate that the rollers reheat quickly as I replace them.  My 4 stars are due to the size/shape of the connections on the bottom, because it can be a little tedious to get the roller back onto the connector and I can see that the slightest damage to it would make the roller or connection unusable.  Only time will tell if normal wear and tear is tolerable. While I love the soft case, I am considering lining it with cardboard to prevent bending of the rollers when attached to the base, or may just pack the base separately from the rollers.</li>
    <li> Please don&#x27;t ever stop selling these- I&#x27;d be lost. I always have 2 sets; one packed and ready for business travel, the other for basic at home use. These rollers are quick, versatile (any style) and easy</li>
    <li> I have used these a dozen or so times since purchase- basically any time I need my hair to look presentable. My hair stylist had recommended the big velcro rollers to use for a blow out, but any kind of fancy blow drying is beyond my capabilities. I remembered these curlers--I used a Vidal Sassoon set years ago and figured they would work for me. Now I just blow dry my hair, spritz with hair spray and put these curlers in. In just a few minutes I get body and a curve at the ends. My hair is super fine and I can&#x27;t use rollers with the clamp--they always leave dents, so the wire U clips are perfect They heat up fast, curl fast, and pack away small. Glad I decided to try them again!</li>
    <li> . . . so I won&#x27;t have to put up with these curlers on too many occasions.  They are so hot that they are difficult to handle, and so heavy that they fall out of my hair.  I chose them because of the soft cover (figuring it would be easier to pack), but wish I&#x27;d gone with the Conair hot rollers instead.</li>
    <li> I love these rollers. Heat up very fast, easy to put in&amp; remove. These are especially good for travel in Europe because compact &amp; can curl one side, then the other in minutes. Don&#x27;t need to turn knobs- it&#x27;s automatically done &amp; just need prong adaptor. I like that they don&#x27;t need to stay in my hair more than  3- 4 minutes  to be effective so less damage to hair.  Place rollers in stand to reheat while still warm &amp; then curl other side. Perfect size roller for my shoulder plus length hair. These rollers do a better job than my curling iron because the curl lasts all day with less frying/ heat on hair. Although I don&#x27;t mind the picks that hold then in, I have purchased the pinch claw type of roller holder. Either one does the trick.</li>
    <li> The middle heating element doesn&#x27;t get hot, just barely warm.  I originally posted this review and Discount Jungle contacted me immediately.  I could either return the unit or get a credit.  I decided to keep the hot rollers (I can still use 4 of them) and receive a credit.  They asked me to remove the negative review first and then I&#x27;d receive the credit.  It&#x27;s been about 3 weeks now and I&#x27;ve yet to receive a credit for this purchase.</li>
    <li> Hot Curlers are easy to take wherever you go .. Home, work.&lt;br /&gt;or on a trip.. The extra curl can freshen any hair style .</li>
    <li> Great product except for fact that not all rollers heat up.two months into ownership one does not heat up at all.</li>
    <li> I absolutely LOVE this product. I use it every day and always get complements on my hair!&lt;br /&gt;People stop me in elevators and ask me who styled my hair....Not kidding</li>
    <li> finally hot rollers that get really hot,i have very long fine hair,very hard to keep a curl in,works very well. easy to take with you when traveling. gets hot really quick!</li>
    <li> Did not last, shorted out in 37 days. I have purchased this product before, but quality is very bad now</li>
    <li> These are great travel rollers. They get hot in seconds.</li>
    <li> The rollers were so hot they burnt my scalp and burnt my fingers. Rollers are advertized as an inch and a quarter but they are only an inch in the center producing a too tight curl. Skip these</li>
    <li> I love these rollers. They get really hot quick and love the size and there is just enough and I have med length hair.</li>
    <li> I always liked this company and will continue to do so. They have my 100% all the way, Tom.</li>
    <li> When you don&#x27;t have time to wait around, these curlers are quick/fast and leave you with a nice soft curl.</li>
    <li> I got these to replace my vidal sassoon rollers that I&#x27;ve had for over 20 years.  They are a perfect replacement!</li>
    <li> I had the older version from about 10 years ago and needed to get a new model. This was perfects just like the last one I had. It is perfect for any occasion and the small compact size makes it a nice additional business travel.</li>
    <li> Works very well and product was as described. As the curlers are somewhat &amp;#34;slippery&amp;#34;, it is sometimes difficult to wind hair --especially long hair-- around the roller.</li>
    <li> The size of the rollers are great for shoulder length hair and fit well in my suitcase for travel.  However, as stated in another review, the rollers are quite heavy and it is quite a trick to get them to stay in my hair which has a bit more of a softer/light weight texture.  I usually use the Clairol genuine soft clips which work great with all of my hot rollers, but it was a challenge even with these clips for the rollers to stay in due to their weight.</li>
    <li> Very similar to an ancient (lol) set I have. I needed a couple of extra rollers to set my hair, and these work well. The clips are slightly different and not as good IMO, but if you don&#x27;t go shaking your head around, they will stay in.</li>
    <li> I HAVE HAD THIS EXACT SAME MODEL, ORIGINALLY MADE BY VIDAL SASSON FOR ABOUT 30 YEARS AND IT FINALLY BROKE.  SO GLAD TO FIND THIS.  NOT A BAD PRICE.  GREAT FOR TRAVEL, BUT I USE IT MAINLY AT HOME AND WANTED SOMETHING THAT WOULD SLIP INTO MY DESK DRAWER AND BE OUT OF SIGHT.  I HAVE SHOULDER LENGTH HAIR, BUT IT TAKES A CURL PRETTY GOOD AND THIS FIT THE BILL PERFECTLY.</li>
    <li> These are great rollers--the perfect size I wanted.  They get too hot to handle, however, and I have to remove the rollers and let them cool off before I can roll my hair without searing pain to my fingers.</li>
    <li> These heated up more quickly than any rollers I have owned in 40 years of curling my hair. Perfect size rollers for shoulder length hair.This is the advantage these have over another travel set where they give you small rollers which I never use. Pins worked well. The ability to wrap the cord around the bottom of the unit is a nice feature.</li>
    <li> Easy to travel with and better then conair.  I brought 2.  One for home and one for the suitcase.  Just make sure the rollers are firmly in place.</li>
    <li> I bought these to take on a cruise with me do to there travel size and rating.  They had so little heat in the curlers that they gave my hair no curl and basically not even any wave.  So not only was that a bust the only place that seemed to get hot was the end which you needed to touch to some degree in order to use, it was here you could burn your finger tips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was extremely disappointed and after numerous attempts to return product and communications when I finally thought I had made progress to do so, communications stopped even when I attempted again.  I was really disappointed as Amazon and its sellers are usually very helpful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will be very hesitant about certain purchases in the future.  What happened Amazon I love you but am very sad/disappointed.</li>
    <li> The rollers heat up very quickly and the set it light and portable.  The clips are not a perfect match, so consider buying an extra set of 5 clips from your local drugstore, and using 2 per roller.  But otherwise, it&#x27;s a great, lightweight set at a good price.  They heat quickly and get hot, but not too hold to handle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great for travel, too</li>
    <li> Curlers work ok but are really hot to the touch when putting them in.</li>
    <li> great size for travel</li>
    <li> These are perfect for travel.  They get hot rather quickly - you just have to make sure they are pushed down well on the posts.</li>
    <li> Wish I could find the ones like my very old Remington mint green rollers. They were a little bigger and easier to handle. I do not like the soft plastic cover and the pins are so tight at the opening that if you move your head they snap off.</li>
    <li> My wife loves the curlers but one of the heating elements never worked.  She needs a second set to curl all of her hair.  They heat up really quick.</li>
    <li> 4th set.  These are great!  I use them everyday.</li>
    <li> After reading many reviews of many different hot roller products I decided just to bite the bullet and order this set.  I ordered it to augment the number of medium size rollers in an ancient Helen of Troy set that I have had for years.  I am delighted with the portability of the set and the amount of heat generated by the rollers and how quick they are to heat up.  I need fifteen of these size rollers to set my hair but traveling with a standard set is a nightmare.  I can see the potential for 3 sets of these to tuck in to various nooks and crannies of my luggage.  Now, here&#x27;s my qualifier.  I have used this system maybe four or five times and to my dismay, the last time I used it, one of the rollers failed to heat up.  I think I can still get by by putting the roller from the non functioning connection onto the one that is vacated by the first roller I put in my hair.  The rollers are quick enough to heat up that by the time I&#x27;m done putting in the first four, I am hoping the fifth will have had time to become hot enough to curl my hair. I may still invest in two or more sets of these and hope that this was the exception rather than the rule.</li>
    <li> Super excellent for travel, short hair and touch ups! Love this product.</li>
    <li> The middle prong does not always heat up, otherwise i like the size and convenience of these rollers</li>
    <li> they burns fingers, so I have to use them before they get hot.  I wish they were larger in size....it products a good curl tho...</li>
    <li> Even though it was new, there are rollers that do no heat up!  Maybe I should send it back.  Help!</li>
    <li> I like the size of these curlers.  I took them on a small weekend trip and they do not take up much room in an overnight case.  Gave them a four star because they did not heat up as quickly as described.  Would have liked a sturdier carrying case.</li>
    <li> I purchased a set of travel curlers like this many years ago made by Vidal Sassoon.  Over the years I lost curlers, holders, etc. so recently decided to replace them even though they still worked.  I could not find anything like it made by Vidal Sassoon anymore, but this set by Hot Tools looks exactly like my earlier set.  I am happy to say the quality is excellent.  I find this is the perfect set, not just for travel but for every day.  Recommend.</li>
    <li> These work amazing AND warm up FAST!  I&#x27;ve used them now traveling on vacation and going to the gym before work.  I highly suggest this particular set.  NICE soft travel case too!</li>
    <li> Great set for travel, goes anywhere, fits in anything, I hair thick hair and it does the job, you must use on dry hair, blow dry hair first then set. Just wish it had a close compartment for the clips and not just a holding space, an oversight in the design phase, never-the-less it heats up quickly, leaving you with strong bouncy curls.</li>
    <li> I bought these to take on a vacation when I was using only one suitcase.  They heat up quickly.  They burnt my fingers they were so hot!  They did the trick though and I had a head full of curls by placing them in my hair and taking them out almost as soon as I put them in! My friend used them and really liked them also.</li>
    <li> This travel roller set comes in a thin plastic cover &amp; the base is thin plastic.  While the rollers themselves are the same size as my old Remington set, the size of tbe entire set is much larger. Every cm of space counts when travelling! My old Remington set has a sturdy, insulated, nylon cover, I took my old ones overseas instead.</li>
    <li> Would highly recommend this product.  Item shipped quickly and quality is very good.  If you have searched for a good travel set, look no more!</li>
    <li> A few weeks ago, I would have given this product 5 stars, but I have to dock it by one since I just realized last night that the middle prong is burnt out and won&#x27;t heat the roller any longer.  I can only attribute it to a problem handling some foreign electrical currents, because it worked perfectly in Scotland a few weeks ago (N.B. I used a new travel converter and had it on the higher voltage setting for heated devices, as per instructions).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said, I&#x27;ve used this product faithfully since I purchased it in November, 2012 and it really does make perfect curls without burning your fingertips or scalp. (I&#x27;m used to using hot rollers, so I have never had a problem with the temperature of the rollers, but for someone not used to them, I can understand how it might be a bit toasty; you do get used to it, though.)  I repeatedly have people literally stop me in public and ask me how I got such great-looking hair, and I always tell them that hot rollers are the key.  Just put these babies in after heating them up for about 20 minutes, let &#x27;em marinate (go cold), et voil&amp;agrave; - perfect, model-type hair each and every time.  I have very thick, coarse, heavy, long hair and I find that 5 rollers are enough for even my unruly mop.  I don&#x27;t need to use hair spray or anything to keep them in place, since they retain that big, loose curl for days, even.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, I&#x27;ll be purchasing another replacement set, so while I only truly got about a year&#x27;s solid use out of this, it was worth every penny at just over 20 bucks a pop!</li>
    <li> Convenient and heat up very quickly.</li>
    <li> Unlike others I&#x27;ve tried and returned, these rollers give off no awful fumes, and are the closest thing I&#x27;ve found to two little sets of Revlon I bought decades ago that lasted so long they were out of production by the time I needed to replace them. Those were great: not too big, not too small, not too heavy, and a circle on the rollers changed color when the temp was right. That quality doesn&#x27;t seem to exist anymore, or not at a price that makes sense. Hot rollers are imperfect so you have to decide what you really need and give up the rest. Generally, you can choose from:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Sets that smoke and stink. Do NOT buy Conair for this reason. (They scare me.)&lt;br /&gt;2. Sets that contain graduated sizes: not enough of what you need; too many you never use&lt;br /&gt;3. Sets with rollers that are covered in hair-grabbing material that falls apart&lt;br /&gt;4. Small sets of enormous rollers, too few for a whole head and a little heavy for travel&lt;br /&gt;5. Sets with clamps that make ridges in the hair&lt;br /&gt;6. Sets with pins that don&#x27;t hold the roller&lt;br /&gt;7. Sets that don&#x27;t tell you when they are fully cooked. (They generally work in about 2 minutes.)&lt;br /&gt;8. Sets that don&#x27;t have a place for the pins or clamps&lt;br /&gt;9 Combinations of the above&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The set we&#x27;re talking about here has the #4,#6 and #7 deficiencies so here is the solution: I bought two sets so I have enough rollers. At home I plug them both in. I travel with all the rollers but only one of the heating elements, pop a roller on as I take one out.  You have to get used to the  pins, particularly at the nape  of the neck where they really don&#x27;t work because the rollers are (too) heavy and there isn&#x27;t anything for the pins to grab.  I don&#x27;t bother with the pins here, just  hold them in place for a few seconds and the curl takes quickly. These rollers, left to heat for a long time,  are hot to the touch but the ends are cool so learn how to hold them and wind the hair quickly, be patient till you learn how to use the pins (the trick is to push them all the way through), and use the rollers on dry hair only. Another thing : It is a pain to put the rollers back in the heating element because they have to go on just so, and there&#x27;s no marking on the roller for a guide. Any manufacturers listening? Make a set in which the consumer can pick the precise sizes she wants.</li>
    <li> I have thrown out my regular large curler box and replaced with these.  Heats up in minutes and purchased two sets.  Travel curlers and home curlers.  The best!</li>
    <li> Very compact size, heats very quickly, clips work fine.  Case is a little stiff/bulky -- I will probably just pack these separately for better space efficiency.  Wish there were six rollers, but otherwise I like this a lot.  UPDATE:  Just returned from Europe, where these worked great.  They are indeed dual voltage, and required only a plug adapter, not a voltage converter.</li>
    <li> I bought these rollers to be an add on to another set that was about 2 short for what I needed. If you don&#x27;t already own any rollers, 5 will not do your entire head (I have shoulder-length hair and use 13 for my whole head).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These heat up really fast and are really hot. The place you are suppose to hold them to keep from burning yourself also gets warm (no matter how long you heat them) and if you touch the inside by accident you will get burnt. I found out the hard way that I cannot put them above my ears or near my forehead because they will burn my skin; but used in the back of my head they seem to be ok. The size is good, medium, so not super tiny curls, but not spread out beach waves, either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These do not have the combs to help hold the hair as you begin to roll it. I find it hard to roll my hair (it is fine and often slips). I typically have to reroll 2-3 times before I get it to hold because of the lack of combs. If you have hair that easily wraps, this may not be an issue for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The clips (metal) hold well and I have not had trouble with them bouncing off. I gave these 2 stars because of the heat (they are meant to go by your skin, they shouldn&#x27;t be hot enough to form welts) and the lack of combs. I will not buy rollers from this brand again. If I had needed all 5 on a regular basis, I would have returned the,m, but since I only use 2, I can put up with 2 rollers being a pain in the neck.</li>
    <li> I love these rollers, perfect for traveling. However, they can become extremely hot. Only allow to heat for 2 minutes.</li>
    <li> Rollers heat up very fast and are the perfect size for short or long hair.  Great for home or travel.</li>
    <li> Love these rollers! Highly recommend them. Compact and easy to pack. Heat up very quickly. Easy to use. Great deal!</li>
    <li> Arrived safe and sound; good value</li>
    <li> I ordered two of these, and I love this product my only disappointment is that one zipper has broken already</li>
    <li> These rollers get hot fast and only take a couple of minutes in the hair to get a good curl. The only problem is after a couple of months one of the heating elements quit working so I only have 4 working rollers. I have not had a problem with the clips but it does take a little bit of practice to get used to working with the rollers.</li>
    <li> this works intermittently, some of the holders don&#x27;t work at all times.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t need a full set of curlers for my hair, so this set is great!  It is compact and easy to pack.  Great for anyone with short hair.</li>
    <li> the curlers are fine - but take longer that 90 seconds to heat by far !!!!!  The clips sent with the product do NOT secure the rollers.  They fall out repeatedly - and this never happened with my clairol hot rollers.  You only get 5 - no extra - so don&#x27;t dare drop one in the sink or toilet or behind the dresser - or you will be out of luck !</li>
    <li> Love how small they are. Great for travel</li>
    <li> One curler does nt heat</li>
    <li> Just bought these and need time to use them to give them a 5.  I have very curly hair and have trouble styling my top especially in hot weather.  I&#x27;m looking forward to putting them to good use when needed.  Just perfect for what I&#x27;m going to need.  I like the compactness.</li>
    <li> This product is convent and easy to pack. I use it whenever I need a quick easy curly hairstyle. The rollers heat fast. The case is compact and fits nicely in you suitcase.</li>
    <li> I have fine hair and it was too slippery for me.  Couldn&#x27;t keep the pins in.</li>
    <li> Great for travel to Europe - dual voltage.  Rollers stay in my coarse hair but might not work well for fine hair.  Heat up quickly and create just enough curl for my thick bob style hair.</li>
    <li> these curlers are perfect for home or travel. I never need more than the 5 that come with it. who ever needs more? I&#x27;d looked for something similar for a long time. Marilyn</li>
    <li> Love these hot rollers. The size is perfect for my hair which is long. They heat up fast and pack nicely for trips.</li>
    <li> These heat quickly, are dual voltage, and the price was excellent. I am buying another set as a gift and one more for backup.</li>
    <li> Usually, products that claim to help you travel light &amp; better are only geared toward lightening your wallet. These curlers, on the other hand, changed how I travel!  I like having my hair curled, and I didn&#x27;t think that changing from the big old shoe-box sized set to this one would make much difference.  It does.  I detach the curlers while traveling (just leave them loose in the bag) so that if they are pressed in my luggage they will not hurt their attachment points.  If you can get curled with only 5 curlers - or, as another reviewer said, are patient enough to reheat and recurl -- and you need more room in your luggage and hotel room - this product did it for me.</li>
    <li> I previously had a professional brand name version of these hot rollers.  When it reached the end of its life, I was unable to find it anywhere to purchase.  I came across this brand, Hot Tools, and decided to give it a try.  Hot Tools Hot Rollers are just as good as the previous professional brand name version I had (and cheaper!) and I am completely satisfied with it.  If I was able to find the professional brand name version again, I would still stick to Hot Tools.</li>
    <li> I had mixed emotions about this - didn&#x27;t think they would work - I was wrong.  Needed this for my cruise and didn&#x27;t want them to take up space.  They were perfect and they heat up really quick.</li>
    <li> These curlers were perfect -- right size, easy to travel with, heated quickly, etc. -- for a while and then one by one they stopped heating until all I had was 5 lukewarm -- if that -- curlers.</li>
    <li> EASY to travel with. Doesn&#x27;t hold on to hair as much as I would like when you start at the ends, but once you can get it rolling, it works great.</li>
    <li> I have thin fine hair so its hard to get it to hold curls, but with these my hair will hold the curl and ill have lots of volume. The curl you get is big, soft, butifull curls that last a long time. Only i wish i ordered the bigger set, witch i will order soon.</li>
    <li> Both ends of the roller end are too hot, burned my fingers badly, there is no way to hold it.</li>
