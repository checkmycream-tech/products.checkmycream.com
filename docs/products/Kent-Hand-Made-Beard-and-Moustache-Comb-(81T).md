<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Easy to tote in my coin wallet for a quick comb,</li>
    <li> great comb but too small, lost it within two weeks</li>
    <li> good item! Great quality!</li>
    <li> There is nothing defective with this comb, however is was not made clear just how tiny it is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although described as a beard and mustache comb in the pamphlet, I can&#x27;t imagine using this anything but a mustache.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My wife joked that it looks like a doll house toy.  It would take considerable effort to straighten a beard with a comb this dainty.</li>
    <li> Great size, sturdy, durable. I WAS using a super cheap one with a trimming set until I saw this and tried it but this was worth the price for sure.</li>
    <li> Handy item to carry in your wallet if you need to tame that facial hair anywhere!</li>
    <li> Really like this comb! It&#x27;s small enough to fit in my money clip (or inside my beard) which is great! Quality and when you whip it out people see that your beard means more to you than some cheap plastic comb. Very pleasantly surprised!</li>
    <li> I bought this because it had my name one it so I don&#x27;t feel bad but this is in no way a beard or man sized comb super small doesn&#x27;t seem had mad and to small for two fingers or going threw beard but does do good for after a brushed finish touch</li>
    <li> Way too small for everyday grooming.</li>
    <li> well made comb - SUPER tiny. If you want something other than a comb SPECIFICALLY for your mustache go for a bigger model.</li>
    <li> This is the cutest little comb. I really love it. It fits in your pocket and is available whenever you need it.</li>
    <li> Nice &#x27;stache comb. A tad smaller than I was expecting, but having never owned one before I was not sure what to expect really. Should easily fit into a shirt pocket without showing. I&#x27;d recommend it.</li>
    <li> I received this item in no time and now i see why. Its smaller than my pinky finger. What a rip off. I couldnt believe my eyes, I thought I was ( and still do ) swindled. Do not buy this, if you were looking for a decent sized beard comb.</li>
    <li> This is a staple in a man&#x27;s top-shelf grooming kit. Quality hand made comb lives up to its reputation.</li>
    <li> quality but smaller than I thought</li>
    <li> BE SURE TO READ THE FINE PRINT AND DETAILS. I thought this was going to be a full size beard comb. Its not!! Its a baby comb. ..worthless to a man with a mean manly beard. I was very disappointing when I opened the package and seen the actual size of it. Completely my fault but still a disappointment.</li>
    <li> Not quite what I expected. Almost to small for my larger hands.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a nice fine plastic beard comb while the beard is still short hair and it&#x27;s too small for my hand to hold it.  It&#x27;s okay. But not really what I wanted.</li>
    <li> so small!  the picture made it look big!</li>
    <li> My beard loves this comb.  I do wish I got a little bigger size, but this works well.</li>
    <li> I just don&#x27;t care for it&#x27;s extremely small size.</li>
    <li> perfect for what i needed</li>
    <li> The superior quality is evident right out of the box. Sturdy material without being clunky. Precisely milled teeth. Feels great on the skin. A great value delivered with typical British aplomb!</li>
    <li> Excellent quality. Use it everyday. If&#x27;n yur hairy, get one!</li>
    <li> works as advertised.  Was smaller than expected.</li>
    <li> Where would I be without this lovely little comb for my thick mustache. This product has very fine teeth and certainly helps when you are trying to trim your mustache.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work if you have a thick mustache, teeth are so close together.</li>
    <li> I have normal size hands and this comb is uncomfortabley small. I have to hold it mostly with my thumb and index finger. I would recommend a different comb, I started using one of those longer black ones with the two different size teeth and it works the same but easier to hold.</li>
    <li> Great comb, work&#x27;s well.</li>
    <li> greate comb! i little tinier than i thought but in general its a great comb</li>
    <li> I really loved this comb. It combed my beard and moustache wonderfully. A tiny little thing though. I&#x27;ve already lost it! If I ever find it I will be pleased.</li>
    <li> very small, almost useless to use.</li>
    <li> My husband LOVES this.</li>
    <li> The Kent Hand Made Moustache Comb is a high quality product and an essential accessory for any man with a fancy moustache (such as upward curling like Dali&#x27;s).  The comb is solid, compact, and polished with rounded tip teeth to prevent irritation to the skin.  The only negative consideration is that the comb is easy to lose due to the small size.  I would recommend customers drill a small hole in the center of the handle and attach to a key case or key ring to prevent loss.</li>
    <li> This tiny comb is ideal for untangling beard and moustache hair. It may not look like much, but it get the job done. I use it daily after I shower. It is also helpful to use a beard wax or conditioner with it.</li>
    <li> I love this comb. It&#x27;s small but just right for a mustache or goat tee and it works great. The first thing you will notice is the quality and feel of the comb. I&#x27;m so pleased with it that I am going to buy another one or maybe even two so I can have one available at home and carry one with me.</li>
    <li> The last mustache comb purchased broke pretty quickly. This one seems sturdier. Fingers crossed.</li>
    <li> This works better than a regular hair comb. Use after the beard oil and your mustache &amp; beard are easy to manage.</li>
    <li> If this comb was full size...I&#x27;d give it 5 stars. It&#x27;s made really well...thick plastic. Just sucks, even for a goatee, that it&#x27;s so small. But I still use and like it.</li>
    <li> Great little beard comb. It&#x27;s about the same size as a bic lighter, perfect to put in your pocket.</li>
    <li> This is a tiny tiny little comb. It actually looks like a doll comb in your hand. The construction is top notch. My beard has never looked more luxurious and handsome.</li>
    <li> Fine toothed moustache comb. Very strong construction. Comfortable to grip and keeps the &#x27;stache looking good.</li>
    <li> People may complain that this comb is small. Those people don&#x27;t understand what a beard/moustache comb is, and should be disregarded. They are always small! The diminutive size is exactly what makes it a moustache comb.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After the first pass of this hand-made comb through your majestic &#x27;stache you will immediately think, &amp;#34;I&#x27;ve finally made it. THIS is what luxury feels like!&amp;#34;  It&#x27;s so much smoother than the cheap Wahl you get with your generic grooming kit, and a great investment for anyone who takes moustaching seriously.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My wife purchased this for me as I&#x27;m constantly adjusting my handlebars, and curiosity got the best of her. She asked if she could comb my &#x27;stache with this comb, and the one that I used previously. I allowed it. She let out a genuine &amp;#34;WOW!&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line, get this comb. It&#x27;s worth every hand-made penny. Let the nay-sayers spend their short time on this earth using Chinese stamped out crap and say it&#x27;s worth it to save $2.00.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my fiancé and he loves it.</li>
    <li> really small, but effective.</li>
    <li> LOST IT ALREADY. TOO SMALL</li>
    <li> This comb is so small, at first I thought it must be a toy! It is the smallest comb I have ever seen. Although it says \\&quot;Beard &amp; Moustache\\&quot; comb, it is barely big enough for a tiny moustache, and if your hair was that short, you would certainly not need a comb for it. For any beard, forget about it. I am returning it to Amazon for a refund, since it is worthless.  As another reviewer stated, it might be marginally sized OK for Adolf Hitler!</li>
    <li> A must have for any moustached man! Being a hand cut comb there is no pulling or scratching from sharp edges. A very handsome product!</li>
    <li> Not as big as I&#x27;d like, I&#x27;m pretty sure the picture of it on my laptop is bigger than the comb. But it is a very good comb.</li>
    <li> Made lovely, but too tiny for my husband&#x27;s huge mustache. He took it to his man cave and I haven&#x27;t seen it since then. I am sure he is using it.</li>
    <li> Thought it would be bigger. Works great for the mustache not so much the beard.  And that&#x27;s all I have to say about that</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t see who this comb is made for. This is a very small (Barbie Style) comb that doesn&#x27;t really get through your beard hair. The spaces between the.. Tines?.. is so small that it doesn&#x27;t allow much hair to come through. Basically useless. Maybe make a good mustache comb.</li>
    <li> Seems well made, I didn&#x27;t realize when I read the dimensions just how small it really is. Will work great for my husband&#x27;s mustache but I&#x27;ll have to get a bigger one for his beard... or maybe a brush.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t know what to expect beyond it being a comb,but I was very surprised to discover that it lives up to it&#x27;s reputation.That is,it combs perfectly and precisely.I sport a waxed moustache that spans almost 9 inches across when fully extended.This comb is great for a quick pull through to even the wax before styling.The best part is that it doesn&#x27;t scratch my face as I comb.The tips of the comb teeth are smooth feeling.Very nice to use.It fits nicely in my shirt pocket for primping as I go through the day.  This is quality,plain and simple.Worth the meager price you&#x27;ll pay.</li>
    <li> So small I kept losing it, but decent quality</li>
    <li> It feels great to hold, not too small but just big enough.</li>
    <li> at first i thought, nah  --  too tiny.  but it turns out it fits under my nose just right, and hairs that were wanting to be a vine down into my beard have been brought under control with the use of a little wax.  i am content, while my critics are scrambling to find other things to complain about.  i might take up reciting limericks to give them an assist in that department.</li>
    <li> there is nothing wrong with the quality, but I did assume which is my fault that i was not buying a BEARD comb for a BABY. lol it is litereally 2 inches long. it made everyone laugh and I showed it off. if you want a gag gift this is the product. the quality is fine, but the size is just rediculous. this is the worst part of shopping online, I love amazon and never usually get &amp;#34;caught&amp;#34; buying stuff like this because their descriptions are great. this one however has slipped through the cracks. just realize your buying the smallest comb in history of man . it will however work, after 475 passes of the comb you have a nice combed beard.</li>
    <li> I was surprised how small this comb was but it is well worth it. It feels great... I keep it in my wallet.</li>
    <li> This comb was made for baby dolls! I bought this comb for my husband who has a full beard and the comb is so small that he can not even hold it between his fingers The comb actually gets lost in his beard!  DO NOT BUY THIS!</li>
    <li> It puts a smile on my face every time I use it.  It is a very nice little comb.  I leave it with my &amp;#34;kit&amp;#34; of beard balm to use to help distribute conditioner and/or shape my beard.  I don&#x27;t carry it because I will be too likely to lose it.  It is inexpensive, it ships pretty fast considering that it has to travel from across the pond.  So buy one, or better yet buy two, and give one to a bearded friend!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s solid, doesn&#x27;t feel like it will break, and small enough to fit in small pocket of jeans or in my wallet. Definitely too small for a beard but a great mustache comb.</li>
    <li> it was cheap in every aspect. I opened it up, felt how cheap it was and then i threw it straight in the trash.</li>
    <li> Poorly advertised as a beard comb. It is only a mustache comb unless you have a very very very short beard. But it is well made. That is why it gets two stars.</li>
    <li> Not what I wanted. Thought the comb was bigger.</li>
    <li> Works great and small enough to carry around in your shirt pocket</li>
    <li> Your beard will be soft and smooth after a thorough combing with a hand-cut comb. Worth the money, and fits in my wallet.</li>
    <li> Never used a beard/ moustache comb besides the one that came in my hair clipper kit.  Boy oh boy what a difference. Comb works great, has nice sized teeth with good spacing. It feels good to use this comb on my beard rather than my last one that felt like it was breaking my hairs</li>
    <li> Besides being the only grooming gear that you will ever likely describe as &amp;#34;adorable,&amp;#34; this is just a fantastic comb. It&#x27;s really marvelous in a way that I didn&#x27;t know a comb could be, and will definitely have me looking at Kent for any comb I buy in the future.</li>
    <li> Nice comb, the only draw back is it is very small (just over 2&amp;#34;). Very solid and well made, the teeth do not break out like many small combs.</li>
    <li> I love this comb! I should have bought multiples. Every man with beard and / or mustache should own one.</li>
    <li> Many knock this comb for its small size but as a moustache comb it is invaluable.  I would not recommend this as a beard comb, look to Kent&#x27;s larger pocket and full size combs which are equally well made.  Very high quality with no catching on hairs due to mold lines that machine injection molded models suffer from.  Yes, it is more expensive but it will last a lifetime with basic care and do a better job all the while.</li>
    <li> This is perfect for facial hair.  The gap between teeth is narrow enough to be effective on facial hair, but not pull on it. It just feels well made.  It&#x27;s also small enough that you could take it anywhere.  Although I don&#x27;t, you could easily keep it in your wallet.  I use it with Honest Amish beard balm to keep my beard conditioned.</li>
    <li> First off I was shocked at how small it was. I quickly got over that by it&#x27;s performance,&lt;br /&gt;Best comb I have ever owned. Glides through beard like magic.</li>
    <li> This comb is perfect if you have a nice thin shorter beard or mustache. My beard is so course and thick, this comb just isn&#x27;t big enough. It&#x27;s quality though.</li>
    <li> Love this little handy comb.  Perfect size to throw in your pocket with some wax.  Works great and feels better than any other comb in my house.  I like to use handle tip to get wax from containers instead of my nail.</li>
    <li> It IS a Kent comb, but it is also still plastic. You are paying for the name and not the product.</li>
    <li> Great little pocket-sized comb! A perfect gift for the bearded gentlemen in your life.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s really small. Smaller than I expected. I feel a bit ridiculous combing with it.</li>
    <li> My husband really likes this comb.</li>
    <li> Not only was the delivery really quick, but the comb is even better than I expected. It&#x27;s tiny -like the size of a thumb, maybe a little bigger- but it&#x27;s comfortable. It glides through my beard with ease and leaves it soft and manageable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly reccomended for short to medium beards and all mustaches. If you have a long powerful beard, it will still work but you might be better off with something a bit bigger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For me, it&#x27;s perfect!</li>
    <li> Comb is really small. Smaller than expeected</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s the little pleasures that make life really wonderful.  When I pull out my moustache comb and meditatively comb my moustache and beard, I feel like a real Sir.  Nice quality, feels good in the fingers.</li>
    <li> Just make sure you know the size of this comb.  It&#x27;s about as long as a tube of chapstick.</li>
    <li> Does exactly what you&#x27;d hope, nice small little comb. Wish it was a little sharper but is really smooth and easy to use.</li>
    <li> Much smaller than anticipated. Though I would use it as a beard comb but it&#x27;s really a mustache comb.</li>
    <li> awesome product. looks very nice. bit small but oh well i still like it awesome very very very very cool</li>
    <li> I know I should have probably read the dimensions...but I didn&#x27;t and I was a little disappointed in the size.</li>
    <li> As advertised, excellent product. Comically small</li>
    <li> Keeps the monster stache under control and gets the food particles out nicely.  I drilled it and keep it on a neacklace for easy access.</li>
    <li> It was just what I needed. Very well made and tiny enough to go everywhere to keep me looking sharp</li>
    <li> As described and delivered on time.</li>
    <li> Very Very Very Very small.</li>
    <li> Tiny comb, but works great!</li>
    <li> Nice, as described,and it says I need to write more for this description. What can I say, it&#x27;s a comb.</li>
    <li> Very handy little comb.</li>
    <li> There&#x27;s Kent combs and then all the rest.  If you have a stache, just buy the damn thing.  You won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
    <li> if you are trying to train your mustache, there is no other comb to get. it is the perfect size and the teeth are super fine to add great detail. its great!</li>
    <li> I rated this comb a two star because nowhere in the description did it mention that it totaled 3&amp;#34; LONG! I have man hands, which makes this comb hard to hold, and difficult to use. The size makes the comb a challenge to remove from your pocket, if you can find it in the first place. At $3.87 + shipping this comb cost nearly $4 per inch. While I recognize that this is a beard and mustache comb, I had hoped that it would be made for a man not an action figure doll.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s alright. EXTREMELY SMALL.</li>
    <li> Basically useless.  Not described well.  This comb is not even functional to those with any facial hair. I could not recommend</li>
    <li> This comb was a great buy and worked like a charm ... that is until I lost it ...sniff, sniff. So, guess what? I&#x27;m buying another one today. That&#x27;s how good it was and how much I miss that little booger. My wife will be happier too. She like the groomed look vs. the &amp;#34;what bird&#x27;s nest does it look like today?&amp;#34; look.</li>
    <li> I thought this comb might be a little bit bigger, it is so small. Well anyway my son hasn&#x27;t tried it yet.</li>
    <li> Good for a stache, but too small to run through a beard.  Literally this thing has less than 2&amp;#34; of comb length, and its fairly shallow and fine toothed, i.e. for a mustache.</li>
    <li> This comb does exactly what I want it to do.</li>
    <li> Perfect little beard comb for me.  My beard is small and this works great for it.  Seems well made and because of the small size, travels easily.  Someone with a large beard would likely find it too small though.</li>
    <li> I purchased the Kent Beard and Moustache Comb to carry in my pocket allowing moustache maintenance at anytime. The comb is very well designed and made. High quality materials give it great durability and function. I recommend without reservations.</li>
    <li> I have never used a stash comb that has held up this well.&lt;br /&gt;Great comb that looks good and holds up to everyday use!</li>
    <li> Expensive for what you get. I bought it because it was recommended but really it makes no difference what comb you use.</li>
    <li> A small, but very durable moustache comb.  Love it.</li>
    <li> Yea...I bought this for a friend&#x27;s birthday...you know, the friend that&#x27;s had a beard for years - and he was coming to town.  Well, the day after his birthday his sister died and he took another two weeks to come out (he was sad) and I give him this comb then realize he shaved his beard off.  So now I&#x27;m the jagoff friend that reminds him of something he&#x27;s lost.  True story... I mean, the comb is cool and all, but what the hell are you gonna do in a situation like that?</li>
    <li> I found this comb to be useless. It is incredibly small and very difficult to handle while combing my beard.</li>
    <li> Fine quality moustache comb.  Very useful when other combs grab hair beyond the moustache.</li>
    <li> This is so small I keep lossing the damn thing.</li>
    <li> Gave this as a gift to someone who had been using a broken piece of a hair comb for his beard and mustache.  It&#x27;s a little smaller than I thought it would be, but he seems to like it fine as is.</li>
    <li> Great, I like buying here</li>
    <li> It is what it is, but when they say small, it&#x27;s SMALL. I couldn&#x27;t even hold it in my hand. It requires two dainty fingers and it&#x27;s like mowing your lawn with a scissor. I suppose if you have a precious, silky hipster beard and some tuft above your lip, you&#x27;re good with this HANDMADE (?) plastic piece of crap. But if you have an actual man-sized beard, forget it.</li>
    <li> It combs my beard like a total champ. I purchased a second one of these for my travel bag, and yet another one for my Dad&#x27;s unruly beard. He loves it as much as I do. Very fine, easy through the beard, easy to clean, great quality.</li>
    <li> It is smaller than I thought it would be. I broke my own rule &amp; didn&#x27;t review the description close enough. However, it still works great despite my large hands.</li>
    <li> Works really well. Carry it with me wherever I go for a touch up here and there.</li>
    <li> Best mustache comb to be found anywhere!! My husband lost his comb while traveling. I found this on amazon and ordered two! The comb moved through his mustache easily and doesn&#x27;t poke the skin like some combs do.</li>
    <li> Carry this in my pocket and keeps my moustache smooth and flat. I order several at a time so I can keep one in the bathroom, suitcase and with me all the time.</li>
    <li> It is very small. I almost thought it was for a Barbie doll. It just didn&#x27;t work for me. Good luck.</li>
    <li> No one needs a big comb when grooming a moustache.  This comb allows for easy combing and at that time any excess wax is spread and some removed.  Comb out on the first stroke and up on the successive strokes and the was is spread evenly and neatly.</li>
    <li> Great beard comb to use. Only wish it was a little larger. It would reduce chance of losing it. Nevertheless, might buy one more for spare.</li>
    <li> This could be a really great beard and mustache comb, but it&#x27;s too small. It&#x27;s just not long enough to be very effective without a bazillion swipes at your face. The teeth are good and if it was half again as long as it is, it would be super.</li>
    <li> Since I had bought many Kent combs already I went ahead and bought this as well. It&#x27;s as functional as it is cute. It is very cute and should last a very long time.</li>
    <li> How did I live for so long without a good mustache comb?  Just the right size and combs through my &#x27;stache like buttuh...  I used other combs that would catch and snag, but I have no issues with it.</li>
    <li> This comb was exactly what I wanted.  It&#x27;s small, fine toothed,and works perfectly for my beard and mustache. Great value!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this every single day since I got it. Keep in mind it is tiny! But that&#x27;s what I wanted. It&#x27;s in my pocket all day and I forget it&#x27;s there and it&#x27;s like new! Very durable! I originally got it to help spread wax on my beard but I find myself using it to comb my entire beard, although it&#x27;s a little tiny for it, it works and the way it&#x27;s made doesn&#x27;t poke my cheeks. Definitely will buy more products from this company.</li>
    <li> Really great little comb. Bought for my boyfriend who has an epic beard. Small and easy to pack, they are goof for traveling, and very reasonably priced.</li>
    <li> I find this comb to be the perfect size for taming the coarse, unruly bracken which lines my upper lip. Yes, it is small. Such size allows it to be kept unobtrusively on one&#x27;s person, even in one&#x27;s wallet. If you need to comb the hair on your head, or even a caveman-style beard, get something bigger. If you just want to keep your whiskers and maybe your eyebrows in line, this is the comb for you. It is obviously well crafted of durable material and the spacing of the teeth is perfect for facial hair.</li>
    <li> Outstanding little comb. I have several Kent Combs they are the best.</li>
    <li> Lovely and smooth feel.</li>
    <li> Thought it was a full size comb it&#x27;s like 1 inch in size lol  I have a full beard dusent work for me</li>
    <li> Terrible. This comb was extremely to small. You could use it to comb a mouse I guess but not a man. Look like something you would get out of a bubble gum machine</li>
    <li> This is the top of the line mustache comb. I us mine daily and it works great. You cant&#x27;t go wrong with this item.</li>
    <li> A nice, quality moustache comb that fits in your pocket or travel bag. The description says beard and moustache comb, but its really too small for a beard comb.</li>
    <li> This is a very nice comb. It feels sturdy and definitely gets the job done. That being said, reading the description will only get you so far. I saw the photos and knew that it was supposed to be really small, but you don&#x27;t really know until you actually see it. I have a thick beard and this guy would really only work on a thinner beard or a standard mustache. If that&#x27;s what you need it for, please don&#x27;t hesitate to purchase this. I really wish that it would come with a decent carrying sheath or thin case. I&#x27;ve carried other combs in my pocket and the teeth eventually break. I would hate for that to happen to this one, as nice as it is.</li>
    <li> Perfect for your beard, nice quality, and great size.  I would recommend this to anyone who wants to clean the beard up, or keep it looking good</li>
    <li> Very nice. Hubby is so glad I purchased for him. NOW he is truly beard flexing. The combs goes gently through the facial hair with ease. All the way through even for being such a tiny little thing. Thanks</li>
    <li> So small it&#x27;s about worthless unless you&#x27;re Papa Smurf in which case it&#x27;s fine.</li>
    <li> Been using this the last few days and all i get is compliments. It is a mustache comb tho. It takes me 45 minutes to brush my beard&lt;br /&gt;because it is a comb for ants!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I did not pay attention to the overall size of the brush before purchasing... it&#x27;s TINY.  That being said, it works great and I really have no complaints.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s not bad to tell you the truth. i dont know how it&#x27;s &amp;#34;hand made&amp;#34; i mean.. it&#x27;s probabally extruded in a mold and that&#x27;s that. anyway. i kinda wish the bristles were pointed more so they could grip your hair and get to the skin underneath. but all in all. its 5 bucks and it is sturdy. i&#x27;m totally going to loose this thing though.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> This is a great comb if you have just a mustauch...but it doesn&#x27;t work well for a thick full beard. I&#x27;m hoping to find the next size up, I think that would work for me. When I first opened it I thought it was a comb for a Barbie Doll.</li>
    <li> I carry it in my pocket every where I go. I love having this with me to fix my mustache after I eat, drink or use a tissue.</li>
    <li> Well received my comb no problems,when I got my first look at it,I thought it was a comb made for Barbie and Ken dolls,that being said,my beard is way to gnarly for this comb,but for my moustache part it really works good,well now that my mustache is coming in thicker,it works awesome on the mustache,gets it ready for the wax and the swirl,goes hand in hand with a good mustache wax,be careful and don&#x27;t lose it.I now agree that it&#x27;s a 5 star.</li>
    <li> This comb is tiny. Like, REALLY tiny. I definitely wasnt expecting it to be so small.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, it is a good mustache comb. My girlfriend said &amp;#34;Oh that&#x27;s cute lol&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> Pass on this comb. Teeth are too narrow and comb is too small even for a mustache let alone a beard.</li>
    <li> Does a good job for what it was made for.</li>
    <li> This little comb is a nice addition to my &amp;#34;facial care&amp;#34; collection. I even use the handle to scrape wax out my jar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s small, so don&#x27;t loose it!</li>
    <li> Works well. A little smaller than I thought, but does the job.</li>
    <li> Just because the comb is for a mustache is no reason that it has to be so small.</li>
    <li> The comb is small and it fits right in my wallet. Just the right size in my book. It is very sturdy and made to last.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t have a moustache, but my goatee is about 3 inches long, so I tend to keep it combed and somewhat groomed. I order this comb since it had decent reviews and I needed a new small comb.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, this arrived and I wasn&#x27;t disappointed, but it really is a small comb.  It is literally the length of my forefinger on my average sized hands, that includes the handle and comb teeth.  I can run it through my beard and it does work nicely, but I might like it just a little more if the teeth were a bit deeper cut.  So it&#x27;s perfect for a moustache and short beard, but not something I would use everyday for mine, although it will come in handy when I travel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, the quality of the comb is super!  Rigid plastic and the teeth do not move at all, but they are rounded smoothly at the ends, so it is very pleasant to run a Kent through my chin hair!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are several other sizes of combs that Kent sells, so I&#x27;m sure there is something for everyone.  This will work for me as will the 113mm Kent comb that I bought in addition, so I am quite pleased with the purchase.</li>
    <li> This comb is small enough to fit into the comb pockets in pants comfortably, and has been very sturdy. I even put it through the wash and it came out fine, although the labeling has mostly rubbed away at this point. Works fine for both my beard and head hair.</li>
    <li> Love this comb. It is like thousands of joyful angels prancing through my mustache and beard making sure that ever hair is gently handled and put in the right place.</li>
    <li> This is a really well made comb. It work better for a mustache as I use a wider ACE comb for the side of my beard but this little comb goes everywhere with me. Very well made. Total keeper.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t beat this for a beard/mustache comb. I bought 2 and leave one in the car at all times; the other stays in my pocket. They&#x27;re so small I can&#x27;t believe they cost what they do. I left it on my Wish List for months and looked all over the internet for a better price but I guess Kent just prices these high.</li>
    <li> A little hard to hold when wet</li>
    <li> I bought this little guy for one of my moustache-laden-man&#x27;s stocking stuffers.&lt;br /&gt;It has appeared to be a good investment so far!&lt;br /&gt;The comb is sturdy, sleek, and aesthetically-pleasing.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend it!</li>
    <li> Very very small in size. More of a mustache comb than a beard comb</li>
    <li> This was a gift for my 23 year old  who has decided to grow a beard. He is the love of my life, but I am secretly hoping that he has it professionally trimmed to look more upscale. But he got a kick out of the beard comb that I send as some stocking stuffers from the Honest Amish people for Christmas! Now he says he keeps it in his back pocket and when he is out somewhere with friends and they ask him if he is ready to go (to wherever they are going) he replies &amp;#34;No&amp;#34;. Then he gets his little comb out of his back pocket, makes a few swipes with it and then says &amp;#34;Now, I am ready&amp;#34;. He says is gets a laugh every time!</li>
    <li> This was a gift and he seemed pleased.</li>
    <li> Best mustache comb I&#x27;ve ever used. I have a large and in charge handle bar and use a very stiff wax and it is no match for this comb. It is very sturdy, but also very comfortable on the skin. It is a bit small to use on a beard but it can be done. I have several and will continue to buy more for myself and as gifts for others. Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> Silly me thought this comb would be bigger.  Its so small I feel like Im using a comb for a doll.  Its tiny.</li>
    <li> Works great for me.  Have one for the bathroom and one in the shaving kit for travel.</li>
    <li> Great pricing compared to other beard combs. I went to a specialty shaving store and they tried to sell me a comb made from buffalo horn that was priced at $40. Ridiculous in more ways than one, right? This Kent comb works identically. After all, it is only a comb. It gets the job done, end of story.</li>
    <li> I am always misplacing my normal mustache comb, so I keep this one in my wallet as a secondary comb. The construction is high quality and none of the teeth have chipped or broken off. It&#x27;s kinda heavy for such a small comb, but weight is usually a sign of reliability - if it breaks, you can just hit someone with it.</li>
    <li> Too small to hold unless you have small hands.</li>
    <li> The picture was deceiving.  It is too small to be used for anything.  Very displeased with this product and would not recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> Yup, its small and tiny in the hand, but it does the job. It was a nice intro into the line.</li>
    <li> like it, but wish it had a longer handle.  Stays in my travel bag now that I have the Swissco boot comb</li>
    <li> I bought this comb based on the positive reviews other people have given it. Unfortunately I was very disappointed with it. The only positive thing I can say about this comb is the quality. The comb is very solid and the rounded teeth are great. The size and teeth space are another story. This comb is practical joke small. To me the comb felt very uncomfortable and unnatural in my hand. I was looking for a fine spaced comb, but the spacing on this come was dissatisfying. The cheap crappy comb that came with my beard trimmer has finer spacing than this comb. I was under the impression that 81T meant 81 toothed, but it doesn&#x27;t. This comb has 25 teeth. Oh well, $10 wasted :/</li>
    <li> Nice little mustache comb. I had a cheaper plastic comb from local drug store but the it was too fine. This one fits the bill for a those more course facial hairs. I can also comb in some mustache wax without losing the wax to the comb.</li>
    <li> Works well with my handle bar mustach.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t look handmade, but it&#x27;s a good size and I really like it best mustache, I have found.</li>
    <li> Great comb. Very small, pretty much good for mustaches only.</li>
    <li> The Kent Hand-Made Beard and Mustache Comb is a surprisingly robust bit of grooming gear, but is exactly the correct size for both use and carry. It disappears into a vest or trouser pocket with its light weight making it practically unnoticeable, but is never hard to find again, and its robust construction means you can carry it all the time without fear of it become bent of otherwise damaged.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Kent Hand-Made Beard and Mustache Comb is large enough to hold easily, but small enough to maneuver around one&#x27;s facial topiary with ease, and the finely-spaced teeth on the comb do a very efficient job of organizing one&#x27;s facial hair without pulling or snagging.</li>
    <li> 10/10 would buy again</li>
    <li> I was a little skeptical when the comb arrived and it was a lot smaller than I had expected.  I have to say it is now something I use almost everyday.  It&#x27;s small enough that it doesn&#x27;t pull your hair when you&#x27;re combing thick areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m just hoping I don&#x27;t loose it.  If I did I&#x27;m sure I would buy another.</li>
    <li> arrived without any problem , it is perfect</li>
    <li> hehehe my beards so thick i can use this thing like a pick</li>
    <li> Pretty good comb, smaller than I imagined, like a barbie-sized hair comb, but fits in a wallet easily, so kudos there. Only negative is the price, the things so darn small that I feel like $7 is a bit much. Maybe that&#x27;s me being a cheapskate, but I feel $3-4 at most would be appropriate for this product.</li>
    <li> A tiny little thing. If a Ken doll had a beard this might be good, but for my 6&#x27;3&amp;#34; son, it was too little!</li>
    <li> Excellently portable (as others noted, first great into the fifth pocket on jeans), but really only good for a mustache, not large enough to handle a beard.</li>
    <li> This is a TOTAL RIPOFF I paid 6 dollars with shipping just to find out that it is like 1 inch long I mean this thing is worth only about 99 Cents, buyer beware this thing is SMALL i mean very small!! Very disappointed in this purchase. BE WARNED</li>
    <li> Hated how small it was at first, now I carry it with me everywhere and use frequently.</li>
    <li> This comb is a must-have for anyone wanting to tame their unruly moustache. Hercule Poirot would have become one of his own adversaries for one!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had my doubts, as I&#x27;ve never bought a \\&quot;premium\\&quot; comb, but the Kent 81T works great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was using (reluctantly) a green, plastic piece of injection molded crap that came with a tube of cheap moustache wax. The teeth, if you want to call them that, were thin, mostly bent, too close together and pulled the hairs of my impressive soup strainer so much that I rarely used it. The handle is also so small, it WAS difficult to hold. (I&#x27;ve uploaded a photo showing both combs, if you would like to compare the two.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That has all changed with the Kent 81T!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ordered three from a seller in Jolly Old England, of all places, and I keep one at my desk at home, one on my desk at work, and one in the watch pocket of my jeans (which is perfect for this diminutive comb).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The comb is a little small, but not TOO small. After all, you&#x27;re combing a moustache, not a sheepdog.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The handle is adequately large, I am able to easily grip it even with my large manly fingers (those of you of the feminine persuasion may find it a delightful fit), and using it to comb my &#x27;stache is like a dream: There is NO hair pulling with this hand-made, sawcut comb!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also bought three tins of Burts Bees Miracle Salve and I am using the two together on a daily basis to train my rather anarchistic lip-follicle-extrusions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can also use the comb on your beard, in a pinch, but this comb really does its best work on a moostache.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve never owned a \\&quot;premium\\&quot; comb before, but am so impressed with my Kent 81T, that I just ordered a Kent Rake Comb to use on my head hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These combs are a little more expensive, but I think they&#x27;re worth it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pamper yourself today!</li>
    <li> This is a nice comb,but is very very small!! It works fine but i have big hands and it makes it hard to use!</li>
    <li> Husband loves this comb!  He uses it daily and it really helps tame the beard and mustache!  This is a great product!</li>
    <li> This is a great quality comb but its way to small and very easy to lose anywhere in your pockets or home.</li>
    <li> I would recommend this to anyone who has a mustache and uses wax.  It is a well made comb.  I think it is a little small, it gets lost in my pocket.</li>
    <li> This small, but not tiny comb is nice for fine-tuning a moustache. Very smooth teeth that don&#x27;t scrape skin or snag hairs. Thick, quality feel. I use it daily to comb my stache to the side. A little expensive, but I&#x27;ve never found one comparable.</li>
    <li> This product is only for the manlyest of men! It works great on my handlebar stache, before the wax that is.</li>
    <li> Very tiny. Tines started breaking a week in. I wouldn&#x27;t feel comfortable recommending it.</li>
    <li> Husband loves the comb</li>
    <li> perfect for keeping my mustache neat and clean</li>
    <li> If you, like me, are a man of distinction, then you must have a beard! And seeing as how you must have a beard, then surely you must also keep it well-groomed.  What&#x27;s that you say? Untamed? WILD MOUSTACHIOS!?!? Well, friend; I say \\&quot;no more!\\&quot; With the Kent Hand Made Beard and Moustache Comb, you will be the envy of all men and the object of desire of all women. Or at least, you will no longer look like a 15 year old man-child dressing in Daddy&#x27;s clothes.  This is honestly a very nice comb. It&#x27;s small and fits easily into the Hand Made Beard and Moustache Comb pocket that is found on all jean pants. If you add in a little leave-in conditioner, you will dramatically improve the appearance of your beard and moustaches.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d like to see someone comb their beard with this tiny thing. Y&#x27;all don&#x27;t know it yet but it&#x27;s getting sent back to ya!</li>
    <li> not as big as i thought it was going to be</li>
    <li> I keep it in my pocket and keep the &#x27;stache lookin&#x27; good everyday! it&#x27;s always there when you need it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(The gold lettering will wear off very quickly if you keep in your pocket and use it often, but for me, I didn&#x27;t deduct a star for this because it is function over style that I was looking for. And it serves it&#x27;s function perfectly).</li>
    <li> The package arrive empty</li>
    <li> Great little comb.  Has lived in my pocket for a month now.  The comb tips aren&#x27;t sharp and it is always a delight to use.  The lettering is wearing away, but I don&#x27;t really need it.  Keeps my stache in shape!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s TINY ! Who is going to use it? Haven&#x27;t even opened it - most ridiculous thing I ever saw! I have big hands and am using a big comb.</li>
    <li> This is a very nice beard and moustache comb however, I find the size is difficult to hold on to. I found an old comb about the same size with a longer handle and I primarily use it.</li>
    <li> Best comb for my beard and moustache.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my son and he just loves it.  Keeps his Van Dyke looking fabulous !</li>
    <li> Very small and very usefulness! My favorite pocket comb! Beard and Mustache both!</li>
    <li> Useless, but with clever reviews.</li>
    <li> Great comb.  A little smaller than one would realize even with the description, but a solid sturdy comb. Works as well as a moustache comb can.</li>
    <li> I bought this comb because I needed one to go with my mustache and goatee. It got my order for the Remington trimmer over $35 and I figured if I didn&#x27;t like it I could mail it back. When I got it and realized how small it was I thought I had been taken. It&#x27;s tiny!  But I unwrapped it and tried it out. I immediately realized it was the perfect size for the job. It was stamped,  &amp;#34;hand Made&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;saw cut.&amp;#34;  After using it I realized why. If you stamped this small of a plastic comb out, the combs would break under the pressure of your beard.  By making it one piece in a mold and then cutting the combs, it will last a long time.  They should make a big deal about this in the blurb for it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s perfect for my mustache and goatee and should be fine with full beard.</li>
    <li> This is a well made comb, but is way too small to be used on anything but a mustache.  I can use any of my other combs on my mustache, so this one just sits in the drawer.  Again, I&#x27;m not slamming the comb, I just see no real purpose for it.</li>
    <li> unless you&#x27;re Hitler or Charlie Chaplin, this will do nothing but get stuck immediately in your moustache. it&#x27;s tiny. it pulls your moustache out. if you have a moustache you know how terrible it is getting one or two hairs yanked out of your lip. this comb grabs 20 at a time and does this.</li>
    <li> 1.) Super tiny! Like the size of a little doll babies comb (2 inches). Easy to conceal &amp; carry, fits in your wallet. For Large beards go with a regular comb.&lt;br /&gt;2.) Nice strong quality material. Should last a long time.</li>
    <li> Perfect for your facial landscaping.  Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> Its tiny, which is to be expected. Really only good for the mustache.</li>
    <li> fits right in my wallet for when I need to comb the stache</li>
    <li> Wonderful little comb with a very smooth pull.  It&#x27;s thick on the handle and on the top so it won&#x27;t break easily during travel.  I recommend this seller as well, very attentive to customer needs, this product was original lost in the miasma that is the postal service and they quickly sent out a new one without asking any questions that would have made me feel like i was fleecing them.  Great seller, great product.</li>
    <li> It is night and day the quality between a store bought comb and this mustache comb! I was skeptical on whether this comb was worth the extra couple of buck but after receiving and using this comb I am 100% completely satisfied with its quality. The bristles are not prickly and combs through my mustache with ease. I HIGHLY recommend this to anyone serious about having a mustache. The shipping was quick and the product is exceptional!!</li>
    <li> It probably mentions it in the details, that I may have overlooked, but the comb is very small. About the length of my thumb. Works fine and is actually easy to carry around. I keep it in my wallet. The reason I gave it 4 and not 5 stars is that is a bit pricey for the size. Overall satisfied and delivery was quick. Would buy from vendor again.</li>
    <li> My husband loves this comb.</li>
    <li> I suppose the item description accurately describes it, but somehow I just expected it to be a little bigger.</li>
    <li> Very cool stocking stuffer! Quality craftsmanship.</li>
    <li> Great quality, smooth combing action ( unlke some that catch and pull) attractive and well made piece. Best mustache comb I own ! (and I own a few)</li>
    <li> My husband likes this comb. He says it feels great when combing.</li>
    <li> i have two of these bad boys.. they fit in your wallet even, perfect size for my bearding! nothing negative to say</li>
    <li> This comb performs its job quite well.  It&#x27;s small, sturdy, and straightens my mustache and beard hair quite well.  The teeth are well spaced and I haven&#x27;t had any break or bend yet.  Definitely worth the couple of extra bucks.</li>
    <li> makes a unique gift.  good for all kinds and lengths of mustaches.</li>
    <li> Very nice comb. Does a great job without any breakage.</li>
    <li> This is really handy little comb for the moustache.  I&#x27;ve recently started using moustache wax after years of a more natural approach. Not wanting to use a standard head comb for a lip&#x27;s worth of fur I found this little item. It works great for the &#x27;stache and is easy to clean of wax.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My beard is too much for this little comb, however. I use a pick and a boar bristle brush due to its ridiculous dimensions.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my boyfriend as a stocking stuffer. He has a very thick beard and mustache, which can be easily combed with this. He absolutely LOVES it</li>
    <li> The product is smaller than I expected, but this makes it easy to take on the go. Strong &amp; durable. I love how it&#x27;s hand made</li>
    <li> I bought this comb as a present for my husband along with a beard oil and soap. I have to say I almost threw out the comb because it was taped to a paper and I didnt expect it to be that tiny. Thankfully I noticed it. The small (tiny) size actually makes it easy for him to carry around to groom his beard.</li>
    <li> I love my beard, and I have issues with it at the same time.  My face is normally very oily thus making me use more harsh soaps.  This dries out my beard.  I use this comb with some leave-it-in conditioner and it does the trick.  The comb is a high quality item that I believe will be in my poisson for quite some time... that is unless I lose it... its very small.</li>
    <li> The size is perfect! It&#x27;s very durable and sturdy. It fits anywhere and it keeps the beard very neat. You&#x27;ll love it</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t always comb my beard, but when I do, I use the Kent Hand made Beard and Mustache Comb LOL&lt;br /&gt;This is one of those items you buy just to confuse the woman you&#x27;re dating, it really is quite fun pulling this thing out and just manly combing my stubble while eating out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Your girlfriend will be tested, if she really cares about you she will not dump you!&lt;br /&gt;Just stare into her eyes while combing your face, be sure to do it when the water comes as well, sticking your pinkie up is optional but I find it gives an added Man Factor effect lol&lt;br /&gt;She will know you&#x27;re in control as you groom your face at the table.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In all seriousness, this is one of those things you impulse buy for fun because of how neat it seems, it works fine, but I don&#x27;t see this as a super useful tool unless you&#x27;re serious into Facial hair, if you are then I can see this being used for styling possibly or just keeping it untangled and clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall pretty cool little item.</li>
    <li> I love this beard brush.  It helps me keep the chin-warmer looking neat and professional.  It&#x27;s easy to lose if you keep it in your pocket too, so go ahead and buy two now.</li>
    <li> Great fine comb for the price, highly recommend. Leaves stache looking great, also small enough to fit in pocket. Just be cautious not to lose it because of it&#x27;s size.</li>
    <li> Good quality product yet kind of pointless?</li>
    <li> The picture is deceiving; comb is very tiny and hard to use on any facial hair. it didn&#x27;t meet my expectations!</li>
    <li> I probably should&#x27;ve paid more attention when I purchased this, but the comb is actually really, really small... I was expecting something bigger. It&#x27;s pretty cool for my mustache, though pretty small for my beard. I keep it around just in case I need to travel, or whatever, but I don&#x27;t use it very often. It&#x27;s cute though...</li>
    <li> Much smaller than I thought it would be. This is smaller than your little finger!</li>
    <li> made very well; Although its alot smaller than I expected it to be !</li>
    <li> Nice product, great customer follow up, was a Christamas gift stocking stuffer.</li>
    <li> Good comb.  It will last for years.</li>
    <li> Cool fits in my wallet gets the job done</li>
    <li> Got the item very quickly and was very pleased with the quality!</li>
    <li> Yes, it is tiny. Would not work for a long, full beard (mine is close cropped). Perfect for my moustache</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s smaller than I thought it would be. And doesn&#x27;t make a great beard comb. Works great for mustache, though.</li>
    <li> Other combs I&#x27;ve tried didnt hold up against my large handlebar stache......especially with wacky tacky wax in it. The blades would break or bend. This little guy does the trick and I carry it around in my pocket all day for the occasional re-do!</li>
    <li> I ordered this comb for the incoming mustache on my face. With the addition of wax, this comb helps me maintain my &amp;#34;Dastardly Dan&amp;#34;. It is the right length to provide enough leverage to pull through the burliest &#x27;stache. Plus...it&#x27;s hand made. How cool is that. On a side note, the vendor I bought from ships from the UK which adds a bit of time to get your comb. All in all, super happy.</li>
    <li> Husband likes it but I have to say I laughed when it arrived. It&#x27;s about 3 inches long. of course that makes sense, but I wasn&#x27;t expecting it.</li>
    <li> The best mustache comb around. Doesn&#x27;t pull or rip hairs out, very portable and durable. Will buy another as a backup.</li>
    <li> Smaller than expected but high quality. Worked great on my rather wiry beard. The gold paint wore off quickly, but I would have preferred it without any markings at all.</li>
    <li> This comb is small enough to fit in your change pocket.  Works as intended, high quality, just smaller than I expected (my fault for not reading the specs)</li>
    <li> This is just a ragedy little comb and a waste of money.  Go to the dollar store and by a small pack of combs.</li>
    <li> There really isn&#x27;t much to say about a beard comb.  I came from some cheap monstrosity that came free with my electric groomer.  It was like combing my face with an angry porcupine.  It even drew blood once when it snagged on a small imperfection in my skin.  So, I decided I needed something better and I bought this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It fits my hand well enough and is small enough to travel.  The teeth have held up well and I&#x27;ve suffered no more maulings at the hands of an inferior product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Basically, it does everything a comb should do.  The only reason I knocked off a star was for the price.  I know it sounds kind of petty, but $7 is still a little high from my perspective.</li>
    <li> This is a great comb! It doesnt snag like some of the others. Reason for 4 stars is the Kent logo is already coming off in some places</li>
    <li> Is a lot smaller than expected it&#x27;s hard to hold while combing</li>
    <li> Its not BIG as I thought it would be. But its ok</li>
    <li> It really is to small to comb through any respectable beard or mustache.</li>
    <li> Everything Kent makes is quality. This has become a daily companion for my Kent folding pocket comb. Couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
    <li> Solid construction. It is small and will not get in the way of your trimmers or scissors.</li>
    <li> very nice little comb</li>
    <li> Nice little comb for applying moustache wax.</li>
    <li> Nice quality,  a tad larger than I thought but nice.</li>
    <li> It looks nice, it&#x27;s small, and it works.  What else can I say about a mustache comb?</li>
    <li> Perfect for any beard or mustache!!!</li>
    <li> It is my fault for not reading the measurements correctly. It really is pretty tiny.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My low rating isn&#x27;t so much about the product as it is more about the delivery of the product.  It came in a 11x7 envelope. which is why i figured it was much bigger of a comb. But there was no protection to it.  Now I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s my USPS carrier&#x27;s fault. But it got bent in my mail box, which caused one of the teeth to break.  I wish, with it being such a smaill item(no bigger than a tooth pick), it would have been in a better package.</li>
    <li> Better than a regular comb especially for those with Chaplin&#x27;s, Vandyke&#x27;s, soul patches, and goatees and at a good price to try finding then at Wal-Mart or any other retail stores you can&#x27;t I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
    <li> A nice litte comb for your moustache and/or beard, fits nicely in the watch pocket on your jeans</li>
    <li> Outstanding performance and craftsmanship.  I had to buy two of them.  Just wish they were bigger lol.</li>
    <li> Gave this as a present along with a product for a beard!, he loved both! Thanks Amazon</li>
    <li> Kent Moustache comb...bought this for my husband as a gift.  I know I probably could have purchased a less expensive comb, but this&lt;br /&gt;little guy is well made and should last a long long time.  My husband was impressed.</li>
    <li> I expected something along the lines of perhaps 4 - 5&amp;#34;, but the whole thing is 3&amp;#34; from end to end. Well made, but tiny.</li>
    <li> I have always had a mustache (the Hulk Hogan horseshoe style minus the Playboy Bunny blonde color) since I was a freshman in high school.  I never groomed my mustache just until about a month ago.  With THIS comb, and an awesome wax, I made a transition into a gentleman&#x27;s handlebar mustache after 18 years of the same old monotonous mustache. The day after I used this comb with a little wax on my freshly sculptured stache, I was confronted by a yoga-panted soccer mom in front of a Chipotle and we discussed my son&#x27;s humor and my daughter&#x27;s pigtails for about 10 minutes next to my soccer dad crossover SUV.  I am not saying that it was only the comb that made me look approachable but if it wasn&#x27;t for the comb, my gentleman&#x27;s mustache wouldn&#x27;t have looked so elegant and I would&#x27;ve looked more like a creeper.  A handcrafted comb that doesn&#x27;t pull out your hairs when you use it is the way to go, gentlemen.  And for you firefighters, it&#x27;s best to remove this comb out of your pocket before you go interior because the only drawback that I can list but doesn&#x27;t reflect on my rating is that it doesn&#x27;t repel smoke-smell.  My golden stache reeked of house fire for weeks and nothing I did to the comb got the smell out.  With that said, the durability is pretty awesome too.  This comb has been jingling around in my pocket for weeks with my keys and the tines are still intact.  I cannot recommend this comb enough.</li>
    <li> It is the size of a barbie&#x27;s comb.</li>
    <li> Comb serves its purpose.  Good quality.  Small like all mustache combs.</li>
    <li> I bought a few of these for Christmas this year and they are so nice that I ended up keeping one for myself. Very smooth with no sharp edges. I believe these are all finished by hand. Very beautiful tortoise shell color and these ride along very nicely in your pocket.  I definitely recommend these to you facial hair farmers out there!!</li>
    <li> this thing is way too tiny. it must be meant for a 14 year old&#x27;s mustache, not a full beard. real dumb.</li>
    <li> This tiny comb may seem like an absurd thing to own, but if you want to style your mustache it is a must have.</li>
    <li> I actually ordered this as a gift before I knew my boyfriend actually wanted one. He has this awesome handlebar mustache and takes good care of it; so I thought that maybe he could get some use out of it. The day it arrived he knew nothing of my plan and just loudly stated while fixing his mustache that he really wanted one. Guess how happy I made him to pull it out and give it to him? Now I can&#x27;t get him to put the thing down.</li>
    <li> totally was suprised at the tiny size. I am to fault for not reading the reviews. I needed a beard comb and ordered it. I never would have given it&#x27;s so tiny. But having said that, it does fit in my wallet so that is helpful. I wish it were full size for an $8.00 comb...</li>
    <li> A tiny well made comb I use daily for mustache and eyebrows. Nothing smaller would be practical, but this works and is fun to use.</li>
    <li> I guess I didn&#x27;t really look at the measurements --- it&#x27;s small but useable --- I tend to continue using my brush more</li>
    <li> Works nice, good condition, fast delivery. BUT superrrrr small. A lot smaller than I thought, not sure I would have paid the money for it.</li>
    <li> Size of brush works well for mustaches. Very portable and fits in my normal size wallet. The comb could improve by being a full comb of same size so that you could comb more at once. Overall highly effective mustache brush.</li>
    <li> For a full beard, get a boar bristle brush. This is a great mustache comb, well crafted, and doesn&#x27;t rip out hairs and snag like the cheapo plastic combs.</li>
    <li> Product as advertised</li>
    <li> Much smaller than I thought</li>
    <li> Got this to keep my beard looking nice. It is small and works great.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s an excellent product, has held up great. Everything they say it is. Would recommend it to all.</li>
    <li> just the perfect size and works so well. a joy. and so well made</li>
    <li> This comb is about 2&amp;#34; long, with about half of it handle. I don&#x27;t doubt it&#x27;s a good comb, but to sell it as a beard comb is an absolute joke.</li>
    <li> Best beard comb I&#x27;ve ever had.&lt;br /&gt;Full Disclosure: First beard comb I&#x27;ve ever had.</li>
    <li> Great comb. super durable, not going to break in you pocket like some plasit ones do, feels soft on the face. And its super small, so you could carry it in  you wallet like i do.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t know about the beard part. This won&#x27;t tame any beard longer than about 1/4&amp;#34;, but it&#x27;s great for shaping my &#x27;stache after a wax application.</li>
    <li> This would be a good comb if I were a little girl&#x27;s doll, but alas I am a man and this comb is much, much too small.</li>
    <li> My husband really likes this.  I got it for him for Christmas!</li>
    <li> a little too shallow for a robust beard, but great size for traveling in pockets</li>
    <li> Very, very small. I honestly should&#x27;ve read the description better.  It&#x27;s very cute though and it IS very smooth going through my goatee. But I do feel a little silly using it</li>
    <li> Great comb for the mustache. Fast shipping.</li>
    <li> This comb is tiny. I understand it&#x27;s a mustache comb but my husband is a big guy and this was just not going to work. It&#x27;s the size of a doll comb..</li>
    <li> I bought this to groom my beard when I deem it to be a little bit unruly and it does just that.  It is a little smaller than one would expect and especially so for myself because I have large hands and chubby fingers but it does exactly what I bought it to do. It&#x27;s of a very high quality and it&#x27;s nice to think that it is completely handmade. It&#x27;s kind of cute because of the size but I wouldn&#x27;t complain,  I can see myself eventually having to buy another one though.</li>
    <li> It glides like a dream through my beard as it massages the skin beneath it. But unlike other combs this one is crafted with love by people who really care about the quality of their product. The teeth are perfectly crafted to provide only the most desirable sensations. I might grow out my pubic hair just so I can use it there as well.</li>
    <li> Lost it once because it&#x27;s so small. Does what it has to do. Can&#x27;t complain.</li>
    <li> Use this every morning for maintaining the stash.</li>
</ol>
