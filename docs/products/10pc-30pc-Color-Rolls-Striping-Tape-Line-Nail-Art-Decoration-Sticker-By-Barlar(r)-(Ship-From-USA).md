<li> Needless to say NONE lasted on more than a few hours.</li>
<li> /&gt;Purple: Dark Purple (only one) :</li>
<li> : Solid Dark,</li>
<li> so I wasn&#x27;t expecting these to be this way since I paid a few bucks extra.</li>
<li> Make sure you base coat of nail polish is COMPLETELY dry before applying these.</li>

<li> I&#x27;ve used these primarily for creating stripes with base color.  </li>
<li> The rolls are thick!!!</li>
<li> That&#x27;s annoying.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> very helpful with designs</li>
    <li> These are great! You don&#x27;t have to fidget around like you&#x27;d have to when using regular tape (which i did before i discovered this haha)</li>
    <li> The adhesive is... Ok.... Perks of easily, but whatever I can deal. My issue is that the coloring is cheap so when you apply any top coat, the color dissolves off and every single one turns into plain silver. Go for more expensive better quality striping tape.</li>
    <li> Lots of funky colors. Works great, haven&#x27;t had an issues.</li>
    <li> This is a joke. Don&#x27;t stick and tears when you go to use it.</li>
    <li> Great price for 30 rolls.  I&#x27;ve used these primarily for creating stripes with base color.  I noticed on two of the colors, when I pulled the tape the foil came off. Overall real happy with these.</li>
    <li> Gift for two girls who love to do nails. They love the shiny colors of tape.  Easy to work with.  Will buy again when needed.</li>
    <li> Product as described. Love all the various colors!</li>
    <li> My step daughter is always giving mani&#x27;s &amp; she absolutely  loved these</li>
    <li> SO MANY TO CHOOSE FROM!</li>
    <li> Perfect! Just as described!</li>
    <li> 11yo daughter loves these!</li>
    <li> repeat colors but that&#x27;s ok</li>
    <li> Daughter loves them. Quick prime ship and nice quality and quantity. More than you&#x27;d get for the price at a local drug store or supercenter for sure!</li>
    <li> A little tricky to use, but a great price! Worth it.</li>
    <li> Very cute and makes my nails look sharp. I don&#x27;t like that the top layer tends to peel off and the color changes. I have to be careful about how I apply my top coat. That&#x27;s annoying. I wish they could just stay on.</li>
    <li> Tape fades color after applying top coat. Ive tried over a dozen of top coats, top quality ones and the color fades into silver. I&#x27;ve purchased cheap ones from elsewhere and those seem more nicer and definitely does not fade...so I wasn&#x27;t expecting these to be this way since I paid a few bucks extra.</li>
    <li> Very easy to work with. Love em.</li>
    <li> I got a lot more than I thought I would for this price. The rolls are thick!!! There is a lot of tape per roll!</li>
    <li> Make sure you base coat of nail polish is COMPLETELY dry before applying these.</li>
    <li> What a bummer! It&#x27;s a great idea but I tried 3 times to use different strips and every single time they came off! I did follow directions and used some clear nail polish to help them stay on...some even came off in my sleep. Needless to say NONE lasted on more than a few hours.</li>
    <li> I received this item today and couldn&#x27;t wait to use it! When I opened the package the first thing I did was make sure I had 30 rolls; I had to count them twice. The first time I counted them I came up with 28, I was like oh heck no, I&#x27;m supposed to have 30. So I decided that I would contact them again before I jump the gun with my review. The second time I couted out 30 rolls; whew! A few of them were stuck together.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Colors: A few reviews said that they had more than one of the same color: 6 blue, 5 green and so on. Well, first look I thought the same as well until I noticed the difference. If the room you&#x27;re while looking at the colors have dim lighting you will not notice the difference. The colors are a shade lighter, shiny/dull, patterned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pink: Dark pink/Light pink, Polka-dot Dark/Polka-dot light. Same for Sliver&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Green: Patterned, Solid both shiny. Same for Red, Grey, and White.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Purple: Dark Purple (only one) :-(&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Blue: Moonlight Blue Patterned/Solid, Baby Blue Patterned/ Solid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Black: Solid/Pattern&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rainbow Strips: OMG, I have TWO of them! (Not complaining, I&#x27;m using them for perfect lines NOT leaving them on as art/decor.) Both shiny.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gold: Solid Dark, Darker Solid(and thicker)/Solid Light, Light Patterned&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Copper: Patterned/Solid/Lighter Solid (and thinner).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I did have a double after all😒.... The patterned whites act like it doesn&#x27;t want to peel correctly, but it is also one of the thinner rolls. I used a gold one and it worked just fine -maybe it was because it was thicker.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, I am a satisfied and would recommend.</li>
    <li> My daughter loves this.</li>
