      <li>This brand makes a fabulous sunscreen lotion, too.</li>
      <li>It works great - goes on better when it&#x27;s a little warmer</li>
      <li>but this is good for tiny areas.</li>
      <li>Her skin is so fair that it&#x27;s almost translucent in places, so I&#x27;m constantly worried about sunburn.  </li>
      <li>It stays on for a full day of summer camp, and she has never once burned.</li>
      <li>It seemed to provide adequate protection, but I think it needs to be reapplied after a couple hours b/c</li>
      <li>My older son who is 5 also likes the orange smell of this one much better and doesn&#x27;t complain everytime I put it on him.</li>
      <li>The stick itself is a yellow-orange color and it goes on and blends VERY easily (even for a 5 year old) and leaves no &amp;#34;cast&amp;#34;, yellow-orange or otherwise.</li>
      <li>My kids have very sensitive skin, so we had many problems with sunblock.  </li>
      <li>No gross chemicals, quick &amp; easy to apply, yellowish color means no white ghost face, smells great, and keeps my kids from getting burned.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s ok if you rub it in completely though.</li>
      <li>it seems to be effective and is a physical barrier rather than a chemical product.</li>
      <li>Natural color, applies easily, lasts all day - all the family ended up using it on their faces.</li>
      <li>Overall I like cream better</li>
      <li>This is my first time using the sticks</li>
      <li>First time using it.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t like strong perfumes and smells in general, and this one doesn&#x27;t bother me at all.  </li>
      <li>Has nice scent and goes on clear instead of white.  </li>
      <li>I also bought the 30+ lotion and really like it, also.  </li>
      <li>so i hesistate to let my hubby use it as the primary sunblock for covering all of his hairy parts, but it&#x27;s terrific for kids and women.</li>
      <li>I really like this one.  </li>
      <li>Works very well.</li>
      <li>One only good thing about this entire purchase experience is this product is indeed natural.</li>
      <li>kind of a small stick</li>
      <li>probably better for little babies who don&#x27;t move around much.  </li>
      <li>No burns, just a slight tan :)</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t love the yellow color that makes him look jaundiced, but that&#x27;s not really a big deal.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend, no sunburns and we are in the water a LOT.</li>
      <li>I find the stick a little hard to rub on face not as smooth as I like but smells good.</li>
      <li>My son has very sensitive skin and no itching or reaction.</li>
      <li>My daughter is very sensitive to smell and even she likes it.</li>
      <li>The review I posted earlier was for TruKid Sunny Days CREAM w/ a HIGHER (20%) zinc oxide content.</li>
      <li>If you are like me and have small children that love to get into things then this may not be for you.</li>
      <li>It looks too funny to wear outside.</li>
      <li>At first it feels heavy, but, my skin absorbed it well.  </li>
      <li>(We live in southern Connecticut, not a place like California where the sun is much stronger.)  </li>
      <li>But, I still have to rub the sunscreen in, with my hands, for complete coverage.  </li>
      <li>I had to hide these from my 3 year old because she thought they were like glue sticks and wanted to play with them.</li>
      <li>I bought this for a my 3 year old that breaks out with every sunscreen we have tried.</li>
      <li>My 1.5 year old does not allow me to put this on his face</li>
      <li>When I opened it, it appeared old and clay like.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a little hard at first to rub on, but gets better once it is warmed a bit.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve always used the Neutrogena for Babies stick until I started researching the various chemicals in sunscreens and decided to switch to an all natural one.  </li>
      <li>I was a bit surprised at how small the tubes were, but a toddler face doesn&#x27;t take a whole lot of sunscreen</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> So, in reading the product specifications, I guess I just did not understand the size of this product...it is so small!  It&#x27;s basically the size of a glue stick. That said, it is convenient and makes it a bit easier to apply on little ones&#x27; faces. I like that the ingredients are all safe. It seemed to provide adequate protection, but I think it needs to be reapplied after a couple hours b/c my little one&#x27;s face was a bit reddened after a long day outside without a reapplication.  Being that it is so expensive, I don&#x27;t think I will buy it again, though.</li>
    <li> We love this sunblock, matches skin tone so my son doesn&#x27;t walk around like a ghost and goes on easily.</li>
    <li> I have used this sunblock since they were in the market. it&#x27;s great product. My kids have very sensitive skin, so we had many problems with sunblock.  However, this trukids did not bother my kids&#x27; skin. They totally love it. Also, I like the orange smell. Unlike other product, this stick is not really dry. Also, very easy to use by kids.</li>
    <li> works well. nice consistency. the kids don&#x27;t mind when i put it on them. kind of a small stick so i hesistate to let my hubby use it as the primary sunblock for covering all of his hairy parts, but it&#x27;s terrific for kids and women.</li>
    <li> I like this product for the SPF 30...works well in protecting. I love that it comes in a stick form!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; The sunscreen is  &amp;#34;clay like&amp;#34; .  You HAVE to use your hands to rub in the sunscreen!  You can just rub the stick on your face.  Otherwise you will look like you have clay facial cream on your face.  At first it feels heavy, but, my skin absorbed it well.  Didnt feel to greasy.</li>
    <li> The review I posted earlier was for TruKid Sunny Days CREAM w/ a HIGHER (20%) zinc oxide content. I reposted my rating and comment under the correct TruKid product. SO, beware and read the active ingredient label carefully.</li>
    <li> Works very well. It&#x27;s a little hard at first to rub on, but gets better once it is warmed a bit. Would buy again.</li>
    <li> great stick sunblock... gets great ratings for being super safe for kids and its really easy to use!  this is our 2nd year using it every day for camp</li>
    <li> awesome stick sunscreen!  it smells nice!  it is tinted so it blends in with your skin!  my kids let me apply it to their skin......heck my kids even apply it to their own skin!  stays on in the water.</li>
    <li> I find the stick a little hard to rub on face not as smooth as I like but smells good. First time using it. I will have to see if it works on my daughters fair skin. Overall I like cream better but this is good for tiny areas.</li>
    <li> Love this sunblock stick. I&#x27;ve tried several others. Has nice scent and goes on clear instead of white.  Definitely will buy again.</li>
    <li> LOVE this sunscreen stick!&lt;br /&gt;This is my 3rd year buying them for my children for summertime and to carry with them at their day camps. It is great protection, has safe ingredients (rated a &amp;#34;1&amp;#34; by the EWG Skindeep database which is very good!), kids love the smell (orange creamsicle-ish) and it doesn&#x27;t irritate their skin (many that are readily available in the drugstores do). The stick itself is a yellow-orange color and it goes on and blends VERY easily (even for a 5 year old) and leaves no &amp;#34;cast&amp;#34;, yellow-orange or otherwise.</li>
    <li> So convenient to throw in a purse, stroller, or bag.</li>
    <li> Ok.  It does the job, but the sunscreen texture is a bit weird.  When it goes on, it leaves yellow streaks everywhere and is a bit gloppy.  It&#x27;s ok if you rub it in completely though.</li>
    <li> My kids like a sunscreen stick on their faces so it doesn&#x27;t run in their eyes.  I&#x27;ve always used the Neutrogena for Babies stick until I started researching the various chemicals in sunscreens and decided to switch to an all natural one.  I really like this one.  It is a tan color so when you put it on it doesn&#x27;t turn their faces white.  It smells like oranges which for some reason the kids aren&#x27;t crazy about but I like it.  The protection has been perfect.    My only suggestion for the company is that they make the stick wider so it is faster to apply.      I also bought the 30+ lotion and really like it, also.  It is white, like the typical zinc sunscreens, though.</li>
    <li> Pleasant smell but made my daughter breakout.</li>
    <li> BEST SUNSCREEN STICK EVER. No gross chemicals, quick &amp; easy to apply, yellowish color means no white ghost face, smells great, and keeps my kids from getting burned. This brand makes a fabulous sunscreen lotion, too.</li>
    <li> Positive:&lt;br /&gt;Sunscreen/moisturizer in balm/sunstick&lt;br /&gt;High safety rating&lt;br /&gt;High Aloe content&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Negatives:&lt;br /&gt;Packaging: if you buy online, safety of packaging is a concern.  Vulnerable to tampering.&lt;br /&gt;This balm is a greenish yellow color, and I have decided to use it only inside as a moisturizer.  It looks too funny to wear outside.</li>
    <li> Great natural sun block form my kids I like how it works and smells nice too!!</li>
    <li> I buy this stuff in the 3 pack because we go through a LOT of it. It&#x27;s not greasy, it is kind of a yellowish color and it blends in easily to the kids skin. I use it on my nose and ears as well. The smell is great, very light and fresh. My daughter is very sensitive to smell and even she likes it. My son has very sensitive skin and no itching or reaction. Highly recommend, no sunburns and we are in the water a LOT.</li>
    <li> Purchased after Looking for a safe product for my children&#x27;s faces. Goes on smoothly and rubs in evenly. Not too thick, but covers the face well. Not oily or too creamy. My son thinks it smells nice. Great bonus is it seems to stay on after swimming and doesn&#x27;t wipe off easily. My son rubs his face when he gets wet and the sunscreen doesn&#x27;t come off happy with this purchase!</li>
    <li> Great product for fair skin redheads</li>
    <li> This sunscreen stick worked as expected! Rubbed on my lil ones face, and didn&#x27;t leave any white residue, stayed on while she swam all day, in the Florida sun. No burns, just a slight tan :)</li>
    <li> This was my 1st time purchasing this product.  I didnt know what to expect.  When I opened it, it appeared old and clay like. (not like other sticks Ive used that resembled chapstick). It has no smell despite the &amp;#34;citrus&amp;#34; scent.  I rubbed it on my face, and, it crumbled to my dismay.  After using it a few times, it is easier to rub on my skin.  It now goes on like a chapstick would.  But, I still have to rub the sunscreen in, with my hands, for complete coverage.  Otherwise, I would tan with streaks.&lt;br /&gt;I still like the product because of the SPF and the ingredients.</li>
    <li> My kids like it. My 10yo son commented that he like the citrus smell. I like that it seems to be effective and is a physical barrier rather than a chemical product.</li>
    <li> I like the sunscreen, but I don&#x27;t like the cap design. If you are like me and have small children that love to get into things then this may not be for you. I had to hide these from my 3 year old because she thought they were like glue sticks and wanted to play with them. We eventually lost all the caps, and so the sunscreen dries out</li>
    <li> Natural color, applies easily, lasts all day - all the family ended up using it on their faces.</li>
    <li> This is my first time using the sticks and I was hoping they&#x27;d be easier on my wiggly toddler. They definitely are. I don&#x27;t love the yellow color that makes him look jaundiced, but that&#x27;s not really a big deal. He even likes trying to put it on himself.  I was a bit surprised at how small the tubes were, but a toddler face doesn&#x27;t take a whole lot of sunscreen so I think they&#x27;ll probably last a while.</li>
    <li> I find this sunscreen easier to apply to my 4-year-old than a traditional cream.  Plus, it doesn&#x27;t leave her with a ghostly white glow.  It stays on for a full day of summer camp, and she has never once burned. (We live in southern Connecticut, not a place like California where the sun is much stronger.)  Her skin is so fair that it&#x27;s almost translucent in places, so I&#x27;m constantly worried about sunburn.  I just &amp;#34;paint&amp;#34; all of her exposed skin with the stick, then I rub it in with my hands to make sure it&#x27;s even and it&#x27;s covering everything.  The smell is very light and pleasant.  I don&#x27;t like strong perfumes and smells in general, and this one doesn&#x27;t bother me at all.  I&#x27;m buying the three-pack because I never want to run out of it!</li>
    <li> Easy to apply and smells great.</li>
    <li> probably better for little babies who don&#x27;t move around much.  My 1.5 year old does not allow me to put this on his face</li>
    <li> The smell is really bad. Made me feel dizzy all day. We want to return the product but never heard back from the seller. Please note, they are super small and very hard to rub into your skin. I think there are better options out there. One only good thing about this entire purchase experience is this product is indeed natural.</li>
    <li> I bought this for an easier way to apply sunscreen to my child&#x27;s face.  It works great - goes on better when it&#x27;s a little warmer (if you toss it in a diaper bag next to something cold, forget about it!).</li>
    <li> I bought this for a my 3 year old that breaks out with every sunscreen we have tried. This one he doesn&#x27;t! My older son who is 5 also likes the orange smell of this one much better and doesn&#x27;t complain everytime I put it on him. I will buy this one again.</li>
