      <li>:)</li>
      <li>was that it didn&#x27;t come with more nail stickers.</li>
      <li>Love &#x27;em</li>
      <li>I purchased this item because I love Halloween</li>
      <li>Again, I love the mini packs of OPI.  </li>
      <li>Great vibrant colors.</li>
      <li>Easy to use and</li>
      <li>Overall great Halloween treat.</li>
      <li>Didn&#x27;t go on smooth at all.</li>
      <li>The minis are the perfect size, since I probably wont wear these colors other than for Halloween!!!</li>
      <li>Definitely worth it!</li>
      <li>but it faded quickly.  </li>
      <li>It shipped quickly and when I opened my package</li>
      <li>For what it is, it was fun, but I wouldn&#x27;t purchase it again.  </li>
      <li>These colors are so much fun.  </li>
      <li>so was worth the cash</li>
      <li>These were really fun.</li>
      <li>and I wanted to do something fun this year.</li>
      <li>The other colors are fun and good staples to have on hand.</li>
      <li>the price is right...</li>
      <li>This is my second favorite of the OPI mini packs.  </li>
      <li>I love this OPI nail polish set the only issue</li>
      <li>Thanks!</li>
      <li>found we liked the look of the Glow in the Dark color better if we put two coats of the white underneath it.</li>
      <li>daughter loved the nail decals (which is why I am on here right now, looking for more of the decals), though they were a little big for her tiny nails.  </li>
      <li>The black and white polishes are great.  </li>
      <li>These colors are fabulous and the green glow in the dark, although requirs several coats, is beautiful!</li>
      <li>I was really looking forward to these OPI Spookettes nail polish</li>
      <li>Really like this set.</li>
      <li>These colors are really beautiful although the pricing should be much lower they are really small bottles even smaller than i thought they would be.</li>
      <li>I wanted to use it on some plastic items to make it easier to tell right from left in dim light.  </li>
      <li>For an adult they would be just the right</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this for anyone wanting a GITD paint.  </li>
      <li>I could not find any other paint (of any kind or purpose), let alone one that actually worked.</li>
      <li>Cute little set!</li>
      <li>The glow in the dark did not go on smoothly.</li>
      <li>I tried both the GITD alone and with the white underneath first.  </li>
      <li>They are cute little bottles and my set came with some extra nail stickers.</li>
      <li>Add a clear topcoat and the nails</li>
      <li>its nail polish can only comment so much</li>
      <li>Very excited to recieve my little spookettes set!!</li>
      <li>The glow in the dark is lots of fun for the kids and even my older teen!</li>
      <li>but the green is the only one that glows as the package clearly says and it did glow long term too altest 7 or 8 days worth untill</li>
      <li>Awesome product btw, the green one tends to get weird colored but not to worry that won&#x27;t affect the polish&#x27;s effect to glow in the dark!</li>

<li> The glow in the dark green is fantastic and actually glows in the dark.</li>
<li> Especially the unexpected green color.  </li>
<li> The green that glows in the dark actually glows in the dark and is a adorable green color.</li>
<li> I was looking for this OPI&#x27;s set for sooo long</li>
<li> I bought this pack primarily for the glow in the dark color but was a little disappointed with how strong it was.  </li>
<li> Both work well, with the GITD alone being less obvious in full-light.  </li>
<li> The orange requires several coats to be dark enough and the green is very very pale.  </li>
<li> The glow in the dark one was a little sheer though so you have to apply a couple coats for it to be noticeably green</li>
<li> Glow in the dark polish was like gunk.</li>
<li> Ordered them for the glow in the dark polish for the Glow Run!</li>
<li> Cut out, soak in water for a few seconds, then use a toothpick to slide onto the nail where they adhere in seconds.  </li>
<li> I put the glow in the dark and the orange under some black shatter polish for a scary Halloween look.</li>
<li> You can&#x27;t go wrong with this product. !!!!</li>
<li> Horrible quality.</li>

    <li> Wonderful colors! All colors are just as they look- bright and perfect for Halloween. The glow in the dark green is fantastic and actually glows in the dark. I&#x27;ve had it on for 1 week and still glows bright.</li>
    <li> These colors are fabulous and the green glow in the dark, although requirs several coats, is beautiful! The decals are very cute too. I&#x27;m in love with these!</li>
    <li> Perfect colors for Halloween, perfect size jars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The best part were the \\&quot;free\\&quot; decals. Could NOT be easier! Cut out, soak in water for a few seconds, then use a toothpick to slide onto the nail where they adhere in seconds.  Add a clear topcoat and the nails are unbelievable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My daughter loved the nail decals (which is why I am on here right now, looking for more of the decals), though they were a little big for her tiny nails.  For an adult they would be just the right size.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just wish this set came with more decals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We found we liked the look of the Glow in the Dark color better if we put two coats of the white underneath it.</li>
    <li> These colors are really beautiful although the pricing should be much lower they are really small bottles even smaller than i thought they would be. Overall great colors and great for a gift idea.</li>
    <li> I bought this pack primarily for the glow in the dark color but was a little disappointed with how strong it was.  I put on three coats and you could just tell that they glowed but it faded quickly.  For what it is, it was fun, but I wouldn&#x27;t purchase it again.  The other colors are fun and good staples to have on hand.</li>
    <li> I love this OPI nail polish set the only issue was that it didn&#x27;t come with more nail stickers. The nail stickers stayed on for along time, even on the toe nails. Plus they didn&#x27;t rise up where you could see they were stickers. Love &#x27;em I wish they had Christmas ones &amp; saint Patrick&#x27;s day.</li>
    <li> its nail polish can only comment so much lol but the green is the only one that glows as the package clearly says and it did glow long term too altest 7 or 8 days worth untill it all chipped off finally so was worth the cash we thougt</li>
    <li> Very excited to recieve my little spookettes set!! Colors are great! Set comes with nail decals that I cant wait to use.  The minis are the perfect size, since I probably wont wear these colors other than for Halloween!!! Love OPI!!!</li>
    <li> I bought this set specifically for the glow-in-the-dark polish.  I wanted to use it on some plastic items to make it easier to tell right from left in dim light.  It definitely works.  I tried both the GITD alone and with the white underneath first.  Both work well, with the GITD alone being less obvious in full-light.  I highly recommend this for anyone wanting a GITD paint.  I could not find any other paint (of any kind or purpose), let alone one that actually worked.</li>
    <li> Glow in the dark polish was like gunk. Sticky. Horrible quality. Didn&#x27;t go on smooth at all. I just threw it away.</li>
    <li> Again, I love the mini packs of OPI.  These colors are so much fun.  Especially the unexpected green color.  This is my second favorite of the OPI mini packs.  My favorite is the Skullicious.</li>
    <li> Polish bought for a friend</li>
    <li> These nail colors were great! The glow in the dark one was a little sheer though so you have to apply a couple coats for it to be noticeably green but it does glow wonderfully. I put the glow in the dark and the orange under some black shatter polish for a scary Halloween look.</li>
    <li> Terrific colors and the water decals were an added bonus.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love it.The green that glows in the dark actually glows in the dark and is a adorable green color.I love all the colors plus the nail stickers that you get with the set.So glad I bought this!</li>
    <li> I purchased this item because I love Halloween and I wanted to do something fun this year. When I realized that O.P.I had a mini set I had to purchase it. It shipped quickly and when I opened my package I was very pleased! I can not wait to use it.. Fabulous!!</li>
    <li> I was really looking forward to these OPI Spookettes nail polish&lt;br /&gt;When they got here I was really happy&lt;br /&gt;They were really cute&lt;br /&gt;I would buy from this seller again</li>
    <li> Polish arrived in a timely manner. Ordered them for the glow in the dark polish for the Glow Run! Just what I needed! Thanks!</li>
    <li> Really like this set. Tons of ideas come to you when you are holding this package! The glow in the dark is lots of fun for the kids and even my older teen!</li>
    <li> I was looking for this OPI&#x27;s set for sooo long and this was the best offer I could find! I think the zomb-body to love nail polish is my fav! Thank you!! :) Awesome product btw, the green one tends to get weird colored but not to worry that won&#x27;t affect the polish&#x27;s effect to glow in the dark!</li>
    <li> Cute little set! Definitely worth it!</li>
    <li> These were really fun. Nail lacquer was great, except... The glow in the dark did not go on smoothly. It was rather sticky and clumpy. However, it did glow. Overall great Halloween treat.</li>
    <li> Wonderful price and product..Easy to use and the price is right... You can&#x27;t go wrong with this product. !!!! Awesome</li>
    <li> Great vibrant colors. OPI is a great brand. Received at a good time. Definitely recommend this product to anyone who paint their nails.</li>
    <li> I am a fan of Halloween and these are perfect nailpolish colors.  The orange requires several coats to be dark enough and the green is very very pale.  The black and white polishes are great.  They are cute little bottles and my set came with some extra nail stickers.</li>
