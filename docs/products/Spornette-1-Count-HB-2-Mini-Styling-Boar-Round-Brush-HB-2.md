    <li> Nice little brush!! I love it and would recommend this!!!!!!</li>
    <li> The bristle brush is what I was looking for but I would have preferred one with a pointed handle for parting the hair.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a comb/brush with 3 rows of plastic bristles.  I&#x27;d gone through several pages and didn&#x27;t think I was going to find what I was looking for.  This looked like it might work.  After going through a few more pages, I found what I was looking for and ordered several.  I should have taken this off the order but I thought it might be helpful when I&#x27;m having trouble with the back of my hair.  However, it&#x27;s not working for me and is sitting unused in my drawer.</li>
    <li> MY BABY FINE THIN HAIR LIKES THIS BRUSH THE BEST.  BEEN USING THEM FOR YEARS</li>
    <li> not what I expected, sharp on scalp</li>
    <li> I really like a boar bristle hairbrush so bought this smaller version to fit in my purse. While it does fit in my purse the bristles are much too short and spiky making them extremely scratchy on my scalp. If you&#x27;re looking for a boar bristle hairbrush I&#x27;d go with something a little larger.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t find this size anywhere except on net............thanks</li>
    <li> A good brush, it works well especially for bangs and fits into an average size purse--artificial bristles.</li>
    <li> Great size good quality. A must have for many short haired clients. Fast shipping.  Pleased with this product.</li>
    <li> Exactly the size I was looking for and great quality.  It&#x27;s perfect for very short hair and since it&#x27;s made of boar not nylon leaves the hair nicely styled and healthy looking.</li>
    <li> Got this for my husband after the one he had got beyond cleaning. He likes it better than his old brush.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve given it only four stars because there is one disappointing thing about this brush. Some of the bristles came out. All the bristles in one hole came out when I cleaned the brush. It does not affect the use of the brush so I am otherwise quite happy with it.</li>
    <li> Works fine on the bottom layer of my hair without any grabbing or pulling on my hair.</li>
    <li> Hard to find small size, excellent materials, super-speedy shipping and tremendous price-point.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What&#x27;s not to love?</li>
    <li> Happy to find small brush with these bristles</li>
    <li> This is a great brush for styling fine short hair like mine.  I like the fact that it&#x27;s made with boar bristle because it will last longer than the ones with nylon bristle.</li>
    <li> This brush met my expectations.  I also have both the larger Spornette 314 and the smaller HB-2.  I use all three of these brushes for styling my hair and highly recommend them.  I like the way the bristles grab and hold my fine hair.</li>
    <li> Perfect to use with a hair dryer for mustache curling.</li>
    <li> I have had trouble finding a small round brush. This one is very small and high quality. Its exactly what I wanted.</li>
    <li> Met my expectations for size. I haven&#x27;t had a chance to use it yet though.</li>
    <li> Bought this brush for my mother because she want to replace her current brush. The 3/4 inch is a good little brush, it just to small for her use. I also purchase the 1 1/2 inch and the 1 3/4 inch brush by Spornette. She prefers natural brushes beacuse she has short, fine hair and they work best for her.</li>
