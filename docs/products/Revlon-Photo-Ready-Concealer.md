      <li>Provides great coverage.</li>
      <li>This is Dan&#x27;s wife Laura and I absolutely love this concealer!!</li>
      <li>:) a must have in my make up bag!!</li>
      <li>I tried many types of concealers but this one was the best.</li>
      <li>coverage is great, it&#x27;s easy to use and matches perfectly with my skin tone.</li>
      <li>Applied nicely, but did not have the look one would expect from a good concealer.</li>
      <li>I just love this concealer from Revlon!</li>
      <li>I love this concealer!</li>
      <li>i am in LOVE with it!</li>
      <li>I love it!</li>
      <li>This stuff works great for anyone who needs a light coverage concealer.</li>
      <li>It covered it up nicely.</li>
      <li>Great product at a very reasonable price.</li>
      <li>Excellent coverage for the blemishes and red marks that I have and very easy to apply .</li>
      <li>My all time favorite go-</li>
      <li>, this is an ok concealer but anything beyond that</li>
      <li>Most makeup will do this unless you wear a primer under it and set it on top.</li>
      <li>thank you Revlon! :)</li>
      <li>Most eyelids have lines so if you put eyeshadow on your eyelids and wear it for a while, it&#x27;s going to cake into your lines if you don&#x27;t put the correct stuff on.</li>
      <li>I have been using this concealer Before I put on my foundation for more than a year now</li>
      <li>it makes it more noticeable.</li>
      <li>That&#x27;s a win win for me because I bought 2 for less than the price of 1.</li>
      <li>Great product, goes on smooth, matches my skin tone perfectly and does not leave any thick buildup or clog my pores...</li>
      <li>Also, not the greatest if you are very oily or have large pores.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>This product is easy to use.  </li>
      <li>so i will be on the hunt for my next great find :)</li>
      <li>and you will either look &amp;#34;cakey&amp;#34; or it will settle in fine lines and wrinkles and emphasize them.</li>
      <li>This is by far the best drug store concealer i&#x27;ve come across so far!</li>
      <li>I knocked off a star for it not lasting all day, but for the price, it is a great concealer.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried a lot of products esp the expensive ones you get at make-up counters, but this one works the best so far (and price is great!).</li>
      <li>it was too light for my complextion ....  </li>
      <li>Perfect for everyday use.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>This concealer is a top shelf product it is the right shade, the right consistency, the right blend-ability and the right choice...</li>
      <li>but not recommended to anyone who needs higher coverage!</li>
      <li>it goes on smooth, doesn&#x27;t crease, blends easily, hides dark circle, easy to apply quickly, doesn&#x27;t look ashy, and it stays on!</li>
      <li>It gives great coverage with just a little dab.  </li>
      <li>eyes-- Picks up tired eyes, illuminates awesome!!</li>
      <li>It helps to brighten the undereye area, but to me, isn&#x27;t really worth the price.</li>
      <li>This goes on, it covers my dark spots under my eyes and is pretty great for pimples.  </li>
      <li>I use it with a matte powder (Mac or Bare Minerals) on top and get a lot of compliments on how &amp;#34;clear&amp;#34; my skin looks (even though it is not).</li>
      <li>In view of the fact that there are so many other really excellent products out there to do the job right, I&#x27;d recommend that you pass on spending your hard earned cash on Revlon Photoready</li>
      <li>Also if you&#x27;re looking for something that works good for underye circles, dark spots, or acne, I recommend Benefits Boing concealer!</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t really use this product until I started highlighting and contouring!</li>
      <li>Also, I first started using this product when I got a black/purple eye after playing basketball.</li>
      <li>At first.</li>
      <li>It stays put through most of the day, although it does have a tendency to wear off on long days.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;This was a surprising disappointment because the Revlon Photoready Primer is FABULOUS, and I&#x27;ve gotten tons of compliments since I&#x27;ve started using it.</li>
      <li>For me, I use this stuff mainly for a highlighter.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
      <li>I normally get it at Duane Reade/Walgreens for $11.99.  </li>
      <li>Other concealers that I have tried tend to be too light for my skin</li>
      <li>the darker shades of make-up aren&#x27;t made for folks with naturally tan skin).</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s becoming so hard to find in stores now.</li>
      <li>Glad to find my color as it is hard to find locally.</li>
      <li>am young, have combo skin and don&#x27;t have large pores, however I do have a lot of dark spots from acne and this covers them</li>
      <li>Spend a few extra dollars for a higher end brand.</li>
      <li>/&gt;WARNING: if the surface of your skin is not flat eg.</li>

    <li> I am 48 years old, and have some age related facial pigmentation, and some dark brown spots from acne ( got acne in my middle age; the unfairness of it!)&lt;br /&gt;I am Asian ( Indian).&lt;br /&gt;This product did a great job of covering the blemishes, and blended well with my skin tone. Other concealers that I have tried tend to be too light for my skin tone.&lt;br /&gt;The concealer also stays on, and does not just wash off or disappear after a few hours.&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend it. Great product at a very reasonable price.</li>
    <li> This stuff works great for anyone who needs a light coverage concealer. It helps to brighten the undereye area, but to me, isn&#x27;t really worth the price. Spend a few extra dollars for a higher end brand. For me, I use this stuff mainly for a highlighter. To brighten darker areas on my face it works great. but not recommended to anyone who needs higher coverage! I&#x27;d recommend Hard Candys glamoflage it retails at walmart for around $8! Also if you&#x27;re looking for something that works good for underye circles, dark spots, or acne, I recommend Benefits Boing concealer! ($19 at Sephora or Ulta) but can be found on Amazon for under $10.</li>
    <li> I purchased this item in a store, not from Amazon, so I cannot speak to the quality control from Amazon.  The product I purchased is excellent.  One reviewer claims there is glitter in it - I have been using it for a month and have not seen any glitter - I have no idea what she is talking about.  This goes on, it covers my dark spots under my eyes and is pretty great for pimples.  It stays put through most of the day, although it does have a tendency to wear off on long days.  It blends well and I have no complaints about it.  I knocked off a star for it not lasting all day, but for the price, it is a great concealer.</li>
    <li> This is Dan&#x27;s wife Laura and I absolutely love this concealer!! Great for under the eyes-- Picks up tired eyes, illuminates awesome!! :) a must have in my make up bag!!</li>
    <li> If young (teens - late twenties/ early thirties), this is an ok concealer but anything beyond that and you will either look &amp;#34;cakey&amp;#34; or it will settle in fine lines and wrinkles and emphasize them. Also, not the greatest if you are very oily or have large pores.&lt;br /&gt;I am young, have combo skin and don&#x27;t have large pores, however I do have a lot of dark spots from acne and this covers them nicely!&lt;br /&gt;WARNING: if the surface of your skin is not flat eg. has bumps or pimples, whatever you do, DON&#x27;T WEAR THIS! it makes it more noticeable.</li>
    <li> This product is easy to use.  It blends well . I will purchase it again</li>
    <li> I have been using this concealer Before I put on my foundation for more than a year now &amp; it is very good. It gives great coverage with just a little dab.  It can get a lil oily in warmer weather but I use a lil bit with a matte foundation.  It is actually cheaper on Amazon than anywhere else.  I normally get it at Duane Reade/Walgreens for $11.99.  It was basically 60% off at Amazon.  That&#x27;s a win win for me because I bought 2 for less than the price of 1.</li>
    <li> Concealer works well to hide my dark circles and old acne blemishes. Provides great coverage. I use it with a matte powder (Mac or Bare Minerals) on top and get a lot of compliments on how &amp;#34;clear&amp;#34; my skin looks (even though it is not). It does not feel too heavy or oily (I don&#x27;t use foundation...just this stick and powder) and it does not cause me to break out. Perfect for everyday use.&lt;br /&gt;I am of southeast asian descent and I typically find it hard to find cosmetics that match my skin well (when I&#x27;ve tried other brands, my under-eye area winds up looking grey or my face looks orangish b/c the darker shades of make-up aren&#x27;t made for folks with naturally tan skin). I&#x27;ve tried a lot of products esp the expensive ones you get at make-up counters, but this one works the best so far (and price is great!).</li>
    <li> I tried many types of concealers but this one was the best. I hope they don&#x27;t discontinue it! I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> This concealer is a top shelf product it is the right shade, the right consistency, the right blend-ability and the right choice...I love it!</li>
    <li> At first. I didn&#x27;t really use this product until I started highlighting and contouring! I use this as my under-eye concealer, and highlight! I looooooooove this! It doesn&#x27;t stand out and make me look I don&#x27;t know how to wear make-up. It glow! Buying forever.</li>
    <li> Excellent coverage for the blemishes and red marks that I have and very easy to apply . Glad to find my color as it is hard to find locally.</li>
    <li> Great product, goes on smooth, matches my skin tone perfectly and does not leave any thick buildup or clog my pores...</li>
    <li> honestly the BEST concealer i have ever used. this is the only concealer i now use. i am in LOVE with it! thank you Revlon! :)</li>
    <li> Let me just tell you guys, I haven&#x27;t bought this product but I&#x27;m reading a lot of reviews saying that the makeup caked in lines. NEWS FLASH: Most makeup will do this unless you wear a primer under it and set it on top. It&#x27;s like eyeshadow. Most eyelids have lines so if you put eyeshadow on your eyelids and wear it for a while, it&#x27;s going to cake into your lines if you don&#x27;t put the correct stuff on. So please disregard anyone who talks about caking, they don&#x27;t know how to properly wear makeup. As for the glimmer? I&#x27;m not sure.</li>
    <li> I just love this concealer from Revlon! coverage is great, it&#x27;s easy to use and matches perfectly with my skin tone. Will continue to use this product as my number 1 choice for concealer</li>
    <li> Applied nicely, but did not have the look one would expect from a good concealer. There is a shine to this product that is not helpful when you are trying to cover up something -- it draws attention to it instead. In view of the fact that there are so many other really excellent products out there to do the job right, I&#x27;d recommend that you pass on spending your hard earned cash on Revlon Photoready Concealer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This was a surprising disappointment because the Revlon Photoready Primer is FABULOUS, and I&#x27;ve gotten tons of compliments since I&#x27;ve started using it.</li>
    <li> I love this concealer! It&#x27;s becoming so hard to find in stores now. It blends in so well w/ my skin and I use it w/ a bronzer. No foundation for me. Also, I first started using this product when I got a black/purple eye after playing basketball. It covered it up nicely. Works like a charm. I freak out when I start running out of this stuff because it&#x27;s a definite must-have.</li>
    <li> This is by far the best drug store concealer i&#x27;ve come across so far! it goes on smooth, doesn&#x27;t crease, blends easily, hides dark circle, easy to apply quickly, doesn&#x27;t look ashy, and it stays on! what else do you need?? unfortunately, this shade is becoming increasingly difficult to find.  so i will be on the hunt for my next great find :)</li>
    <li> it was too light for my complextion ....  my complextion , is not light, nor dark.. it,s like a medium</li>
    <li> My all time favorite go-to concealer stick to hide all of them flaws.</li>
</ol>
