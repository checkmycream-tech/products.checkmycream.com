<li> I&#x27;m not sure what the advantage of a more expensive set would be, but I am not a makeup expert.</li>
<li> /&gt;the brow brush kinda rough for me though works well&lt;</li>
<li> Not very durable.</li>
<li> I have a few brushed from this brand and</li>
<li> - I had to take one star off due to the eyelash/brow brush tool breaking (brow part of the tool).</li>
<li> Instead, the packaging doubles as a case, as shown in other pictures.</li>
<li> buy the set again as these are less bulky than other ecotools I bought before&lt;</li>
<li> Not worth the money.</li>
<li> And be warned that although these brushed are not labeled &amp;#34;mini&amp;#34;, they are VERY small.  </li>
<li> I might have dried it incorrectly?</li>
<li> I have spent a lot of money on makeup brushes and have been annoyed when the little bristles come off and stick to my makeup.  </li>
<li> I&#x27;ve been using them for the past 2 years.</li>
<li> Unfortunately the set was utter garbage and fell apart almost immediately.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After</li>
<li> This one is not very good.</li>
<li> Just a little bit sad that the hairs from one the brush are falling apart.</li>
<li> The hard plastic that holds the plastic bristles broken and caused the bristles to come out.</li>
<li> planning on making 2 sets, 1 for home base and 2nd for travelling</li>

    <li> its very tiny, but handy for your purse. good quality but not what i thought.</li>
    <li> Great starting set and add on with other sets. I added other sets and individual brushes with this set. I liked the wood handle and it felt grown up. Looks really good in my bathroom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 10/16/17 - I had to take one star off due to the eyelash/brow brush tool breaking (brow part of the tool). Not very durable. The hard plastic that holds the plastic bristles broken and caused the bristles to come out. The eyelash part of the tool has not broke yet.  The brushes are still holding up really well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are better eyelash/brow tools out there. This one is not very good. If you are buying this set for the eyelash/brow tool, don&#x27;t buy it.</li>
    <li> Les pinceaux de cette marque sont vraiment trés bien (pour l&#x27;instant) mais j&#x27;ai été un peu surprise que ceux de ce pack soit plus petit que les pinceaux achetés séparemment. L&#x27;étui est aussi un peu juste parce que trop souple.</li>
    <li> These brushes are pretty good quality. I like them much better than the cheaper, national brand types. I can get this whole set for cheaper than one or two of those &amp;#34;other&amp;#34; brushes. Good buy.</li>
    <li> I think this is a decent variety of brushes for the price.  I have been pleased with them and found they clean up very well after a period of use.</li>
    <li> But the brushes are too soft&lt;br /&gt;Like WAYYYYYYYY too soft&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But for the price it&#x27;s good&lt;br /&gt;The handles are well made&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But these compared to a 30$ MAC brush&lt;br /&gt;Yeah it&#x27;s good for the price&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I literally just threw it in my order for free shipping&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kinda really regret buying them</li>
    <li> I love ecotools! I&#x27;ve been using them for the past 2 years. They don&#x27;t pull and last a very long time!</li>
    <li> I already bought some different ecotools brushes&lt;br /&gt;and love how they feels on my skin and how well and easy they washed&lt;br /&gt;thats why I starting to collecting some of them&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;touch up set so far meeting my necessity,&lt;br /&gt;actually I only need the brow and lip brush but decided to buy the set&lt;br /&gt;as planning on making 2 sets, 1 for home base and 2nd for travelling&lt;br /&gt;the brow brush kinda rough for me though works well&lt;br /&gt;will buy the set again as these are less bulky than other ecotools I bought before&lt;br /&gt;these one will definitely good for travelling, adding with ecotools retractable brush&lt;br /&gt;good set, highly recommended</li>
    <li> I have spent a lot of money on makeup brushes and have been annoyed when the little bristles come off and stick to my makeup.  These EcoTools brushes don&#x27;t do that, and are affordable.  What a blessing!</li>
    <li> An eco friendly beauty tool that feels luxurious. These are smooth on your skin and perfect size. A little pricey but worth it.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t wear a lot of make up, but this kit works for my every day use. It is compact to fit nicely in my drawer, but still a nice size handle. The powder brush is a little featherier than I love, but it&#x27;s not a real issue.</li>
    <li> I made the mistake of purchasing a makeup brush set from amazon that had good description and reviews at a great price. Unfortunately the set was utter garbage and fell apart almost immediately.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After doing extensive research and watching Youtube  recommends from beauty expert Lisa Eldridge, I bought this set, along with [[ASIN:B004Q1GCFG Sigma Beauty Basic Eyes Kit - 7 ct]] and https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B003UH0528/ref&#x3D;oh_aui_detailpage_o07_s02?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;psc&#x3D;1 to create a customized brush collection.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Touch Up Set is of excellent quality and arrived exactly as the image and description indicates. I&#x27;ve used every brush multiple times and find the handles to be a great size, even though they are market as &amp;#34;travel&amp;#34;. My favorite brush in the set is the white tipped brush - I use it for bronzer and it blends perfectly. I love EcoTools and have many other products in their line, I especially love their commitment to the a better planet.</li>
    <li> a little smaller than I thought but still great</li>

    <li> This is my favorite brand of makeup brushes.  And be warned that although these brushed are not labeled &amp;#34;mini&amp;#34;, they are VERY small.  Great for your purse.</li>
    <li> Just a good product at a reasonable price. Bristles don&#x27;t fall out easily, yet they are soft and substantial and they get the job done. Repeat buyer.</li>
    <li> I would recommend this product for anyone on a limited budget who is looking for a  decent set of makeup brushes:)</li>
    <li> Glad to have the eco friendly option for makeup- I usually don&#x27;t wear any...but decided a little is nice! As long as its doing no harm from production to personal use. The &amp;#34;lipliner&amp;#34; tool in this could be used for eyeliner if your steady with your hands.</li>

I love this touch up set for traveling, or to throw in my purse for touch ups. THANK YOU AMAZON FOR THE LOW PRICE. :)</li>
    <li> The brushes are good quality. However, mine did not come with the canvas case shown in the pictures. Instead, the packaging doubles as a case, as shown in other pictures.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using primarily the eyeshadow and brow brushes from this set for about a month and I am happy with the way they work. They don&#x27;t shed hairs and they are easy to handle. They are very soft and I think the way they apply makeup is nice. I&#x27;m not sure what the advantage of a more expensive set would be, but I am not a makeup expert.</li>
    <li> These brushes are great. They work well and clean easily. I have purchased more of them in different sizes. I highly recommend.</li>
    <li> These brushes work great!! They dont hurt or cause a rash!! Love them soo much! They leave only the makeup on your face not the bristles.</li>
    <li> These brushes are soft and just plush. I was about to buy more expensive brushed but I&#x27;m happy I too a chance with these. Besides I only needed eye makeup brushes. They are also nicely placed in a carrying case which has a mirror. I like.</li>
    <li> Love any and all Eco Tools brushes</li>
    <li> Eco-friendly, cruelty free, super soft. I love all of their products and will continue to buy more. Check out my full review at emeraldsugar dot com, click on ecotools</li>
    <li> I thought it would be better cause I have a few brushed from this brand and all of them are super soft and amazing. However I tried using the finishing brush is so scratchy!!! every other brush was ok and i expected it to be bigger..&lt;br /&gt;the picture is deceiving. Not worth the money. I&#x27;d rather buy their individual brushes.&lt;br /&gt;I do not recommend unless you like scratchy brushes.</li>
    <li> beautiful, fit as expected.</li>
    <li> cute, durable and safe!</li>
    <li> i got this as a gift, they loved it. i think ita a great deal for the price. nice midium quality</li>
