<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Feels good on my face, but didn&#x27;t notice a huge difference. Since I use it daily, it really on served as a reminder of sorts to take additional time washing my face.</li>
    <li> did not work as good as I would have hoped. was looking for more exfoliation</li>
    <li> I really love this facial sponge.  I use it by itself after I have cleansed my face. It makes my face feel clean,  but it is gentle and porous.</li>
    <li> The product is ok but too pricey. You can find a same Korean brand facial sponge for $3 with same quality. This sponge is also made in Korea by the way. Since you have to change it probably every two months, the overall cost can be equal to a Foreo Luna.</li>
    <li> It really work on acne thanks</li>
    <li> I do not think I have ever started a blog post like this but I LOOOVVVEEEE THIS KONJAC SPONGE!! This is not an understatement. Let us get the facts about this sponge:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  100% Natural Sponge&lt;br /&gt;  100% Coloring &amp; Additive Free&lt;br /&gt;  100% Biodegradable&lt;br /&gt;  Naturally Sustainable&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used Konjac sponges in the past and they were good, nothing that I could complain about but this sponge was unique. On the packaging this is what it also claims:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  Gently Exfoliates&lt;br /&gt;  Cleanses Pores&lt;br /&gt;  Prevents Acnes &amp; Pimples&lt;br /&gt; OK now to my experience. This sponge is so easy to use. Soak for about 1 minute to soften the sponge (do not ever use hard) and gently massage in a circular motion then rinse after use. This sponge is made from the konjac plant root and natural bamboo charcoal and contains activated carbon and minerals. I use this sponge every night as a part of my night time face routine and it makes it so easy to exfoliate and cleanse skin. The feel after use is amazing. One of the things that I love also about it is that it does not shed like the others that I have used in the past. Anytime that my face is oily, it gently removes the oils and greats a smooth and healthy finish and look. With its natural antioxidants that fight acne, I am confident that it will continue in preventing acne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  Cruelty Free&lt;br /&gt;  Vegan&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Additional information that makes me love this sponge even more.</li>
    <li> Great sponge. Very soft yet completely cleanses away all impurities</li>
    <li> My daughter loves the way it leaves your skin feeling after washing. It&#x27;s such a fun shape.</li>
    <li> This little sponge is so neat and so effective! All you have to do is wet it and wash your face with it, and if you want to, add you favorite face wash, but I just used it plain.&lt;br /&gt;I have small bumps/pimples around my hair line, and after one use they were almost gone and my face wasn&#x27;t as oily!&lt;br /&gt;This is a great natural way to get clear skin if you are prone to acne, pimples or bumps.</li>
    <li> After reading so many positive reviews I could not wait to try out this product. I was looking for something to help with blackheads and exfoliate. This product did neither. I did not see a decrease in blackheads, and there is no way the texture of this sponge can exfoliate.When the sponge is dry it is hard and very rough, but when it gets wet it is floppy and almost has a slimy texture. Think if a dish sponge... this appears to be the same thing in a prettier (and more expensive) package.</li>
    <li> I purchased this sponge because my dermatologist told me I needed to use a loofah sponge for my adult acne. I decided to try this one out because of the great reviews and I was amazed at how wonderful it felt on my skin! I was expecting it to feel rough and scratchy but it really feels smooth and wonderful. My face is so clean after I use the sponge that I don&#x27;t even need astringent anymore. This is a wonderful product and I would highly recommend it! I told my husband it feels like washing your face with a cloud from heaven. 😊</li>
    <li> I love love love this sponge the first few days I washed my face every morning and night with it and I couldn&#x27;t have been happier with the resultsof super smooth soft skin but after a while if using it I guess it stopped working aswell as it first did and on the box it says it last 20 washes but mine lasted like 10 before I started getting breakouts again so nothing really bad idk if I got my sponge to wet or what I just know it didn&#x27;t last as long as said but I plan on keeping it the full 20 days if breakouts get worse I&#x27;ll just get a new one I noticed they have a ton of different  kinds of sponges that help your skin no soap needed just the sponge. It&#x27;s worth trying it helped my skin alot over never had clear skin for as long as I did with this sponge so I&#x27;m definitely  going to make this my new number one face treatment.</li>
    <li> So I have always had an oily face, and I have always gotten pimples because of it. I have always hated it, and nothing has ever helped, and I have tried so many ways to get rid of them. After using this konjac sponge just after a few days I could feel a difference. My face had felt very smooth, and was way less oily. Within a few more days I couldn&#x27;t even feel an oily feeling on my face. I have not been using my konjac sponge for to long, but so far I have seen great improvement. As for my pimples I have seen many of them go away with this product, not all of them just yet, but hopefully soon they will all disappear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This sponge works wonders, there are many other brands out there that sell theirs for cheaper, but they do not work. It really is worth paying a few more dollars for a real improvement. When I first got it and held it in my hand it was so hard I thought it would be very rough on my face, but when it is wet it is incredible how soft it becomes. It becomes very gentle for your face. I absolutely love this product, it may not work for everyone but it definitely worked for me. I would recommend this product especially to people who have tried other products to get rid of pimples, or to remove the oil from there face and never got results, well maybe this will be the one to change your life.</li>
    <li> Loved it, but very fragile. It has since started breaking apart.</li>
    <li> My girlfriend was very pleased to receive this surprise gift. It&#x27;s a super popular product that beauty bloggers have been raving about lately. I&#x27;d recommend it to anyone, she&#x27;s said it cleans the skin great without being too abrasive.</li>
    <li> This product is great if you wish to add gentle physical exfoliation to your routine. However, I&#x27;m giving it three stars because I feel that it is overpriced for what it is and should really come with a hook to air it out between uses. These sponges hold on to water like nobody&#x27;s business. That combined with the dark color make it the perfect breeding ground for mold and bacteria.</li>
    <li> This product is exactly what it say great for oily skin. I have combination skin. My T zone which us oily cleared up my normal part got drier. I would recommend for oily skin for sure</li>
    <li> I was a little iffy at first with this product.. but i thought I would give it a shot! after 4 days, my complexion has brightened up. In order for any product to work, it needs to &amp;#34;detox&amp;#34; the skin first, so it did bring up some bumps but after a day it was taken care of! I am happy with this purchase!</li>
    <li> great products, fast shipping great seller will be back again to purchase</li>
    <li> My Konjac Sponge is a company that specializes in providing several different sponges, which fit the different needs and even skin problems a person may be suffering from. I have occasional acne breakouts and my motto is to always treat for blemishes that may occur before actually getting a full blown break-out. This means I keep a mild prevention regimen going when it comes to chemicals, so I don&#x27;t nuke my face when that would be overkill.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Konjac sponges have become more prominent and are now carried at the drug-store level to luxury stores stores and the prices vary for the same active ingredients. Construction of the sponge is critical because how tightly the root is packed in, to size and texture make a difference. I have had sponges never breakdown and need to be tossed because they aged and some sponges started to disintegrate within the first week of use. A good sponge should be able to last a month&#x27;s time and to avoid issues such as contamination and germs, it should be disposed no matter how intact it remains once it reaches the time period (i.e. expiration). So, when pricing I always see the Konjac sponges as a supply of 60-Days (of uses). The sponge should last and be workable, meaning I&#x27;m not tying to use a disfigured nub to wash my face correctly on day 20. I try to stay around the $10 range and will go up to $12 if the product&#x27;s size is larger, performs better, and so forth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Verdict:&lt;br /&gt;The &amp;#34;My Konjac Sponge&amp;#34; company has so far the largest sponge in size that I have so far experienced. I love the &amp;#34;drop&amp;#34; shape and again, it&#x27;s big for just $10 bucks. It fits my budget and that breaks down to a little as $0.33 a day (at 30 days) or $0.16 (at 60 days), per use and I sometimes use it twice a day, so that extends my savings. Effectiveness in the end is what matters! I was sent the Charcoal version from the company and in their description, they state their charcoal is derived from bamboo extract. I used the sponge and was pleased with the amount of exfoliation and the texture of the product against my skin.  The charcoal did not over dry my skin but did it&#x27;s job at preventing acne/blemish from showing up. You are left with a nice clean surface after rinsing. The sponge dries well too and I store mine suspended from a hook and allow it to always air dry. I&#x27;m at the 3-week mark and the sponge is still kicking with just a few frays along the edge reflecting everyday use. 90% intact and I am happy with how well the product performed and much happier that I can get it for the price I want.  I received the above product(s) free of charge from My Konjac Sponge Company.  I am not obligated to provide a positive or favorable review, just my honest opinion.  My review is based on my experience with the product and/or brand, which may differ from yours.was pleased with the amount of exfoliation and the texture of the product against my skin.

    <li> This sponge is really nice. I have used it with just the sponge itself, and also with a facial cleanser. It makes my skin feel super soft, and also very clean after using it. I really wasn&#x27;t sure how this was going to work and if it was really that good like the reviews said. But, I&#x27;ve noticed that my face seemed much brighter after using the product for a few weeks.</li>
    <li> Love the material and that it is eco-friendly. I was happy to found out that it worked great with my sensitive skin. I have tried a variety of facial sponges in my life and had a few bad experience with them being to hard on my skin. I highly recommend trying this sponge if you have sensitive skin it honestly gentle on the skin especially after you soak in water.</li>
    <li> I love how gentle this sponge is on my skin. I have a very oily T-zone. My forehead is especially oily because of my bangs. It&#x27;s great that they have a string on sponge so I can hang it up. My Konjac Sponge clears and cleans the greasy parts of my face without drying it out. Leaves my skin feeling so nice to the touch. It&#x27;s easy to use, rinse, hang it and go.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my teenage son who has a lot of acne. My Konjac Sponge seemed to do a good job of cleaning, but there was no improvement with his acne.</li>
    <li> I mean I really like that this spong is all natural... So far the only thing I notice is that my skin is really smooth and it does the job with not leaving my skin so oily. My only concern is how to care for it after you use it, but I normally run it under hot water for a while and let it air dry. I would definitely be buying one after this one gets a little used up.</li>
    <li> I do not see how this sponge exfoliates. When I wet it, this item is the consistency of a sponge. Soft, but not exfoliating material. It cleans ok, but not great. To be honest a rag will clean better. Will not buy this again.</li>
    <li> Face is more clear. Price is great compared to similar items from Sephora. Awesome product!</li>
    <li> Awesome product I wish I got another for free. :)</li>
    <li> This a great sponge.  It has really helped clear up my daughter&#x27;s skin.  It lasts about 3 months before you need to replace.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t understand why some people say it&#x27;s hard to soften them. It softens up in a minute in water for me.  Does exfoliate some what.</li>
    <li> My 14 yr old loves this sponge as it has really helped clear her blemishes.  Easy to use and she is very good about cleaning and air drying it between uses.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a nice sponge and is great for my face, and not too rough. However, it doesn&#x27;t exfoliate as much as I need. I am prone to acne, and since switching from using a wash cloth to this, my acne has actually gotten worse.</li>
    <li> Great product. Fast shipping.</li>
    <li> Love my konjac sponge. Gently exfoliates my skin to get rid of flakes and leaves my face silky smooth. It has a gel-like consistency when wet which lets me use it daily without being abrasive.</li>
    <li> This thing is amazing! I love the shape and feel of it even more than the lil one, though I love that one too. I can&#x27;t say enough about the Konjac Sponges and all of their other products.  They always get a 5 STAR rating w/ me. Konjac&#x27;s products are the real deal. I LOVE a company I can trust.</li>
    <li> I am very impressed with this sponge.  It claims it&#x27;s good for oily skin but I am sixty years old with combo/dry skin.  In spite of that combo I am plagued with clogged pores on my nose and chin, it&#x27;s unsightly.  Without cleanser, after about 3 uses, this sponge gave me skin so clean and free of clogs and I usually use a Clarisonic!!  Eventually I started adding some cleanser but even without it, it&#x27;s amazing.</li>
    <li> Great product. It is not harsh at all but leaves my face feeling clean, not stripped.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a bit skeptical of this sponge. It feels very soft - too soft. Perhaps I&#x27;m just used to my dry brush with the rest of my body, and perhaps my idea of exfoliating is an overdone, unhealthy version of what I really need, which this sponge would deliver. I&#x27;m also concerned because it smells...off. But perhaps that&#x27;s the activated charcoal.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t use any soap or product on my face, allowing my skins natural oils and ph to balance and keep my face clear, which works as long as you exfoliate your face daily and eat healthy.  That&#x27;s where this comes in. The activated charcoal and rougher exfoliation of this sponge is good to keep my face clean and smooth, but it&#x27;s not too rough.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;ve enjoyed using this. It lightly exfoliates my face each time I use it, and carries away excess oils as well. Just be sure to get the right sponge for your face type and condition. I&#x27;ll update to how this works in a month or two with my face, and in holding its condition, but as of now Id recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;Update: It&#x27;s been a few months and it&#x27;s lasted well. The sponge is starting to get bigger holes, but it&#x27;s not physically falling apart yet. I try to keep it clean and I&#x27;ve microwaved it once for 10 seconds to disinfect it.  I plan on buying more soon.  I&#x27;ve recommended this to all of my friends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: I found a cheap, similar quality alternative on here that&#x27;s less than half the cost of these [[ASIN:B00GNA9K4S Ecotools Pure Complexion Deep Cleansing Konjac Sponge]]</li>
    <li> i really enjoyed the sponge but it seem to fall apart after about 3 weeks</li>
    <li> LOVE the konjac sponge. Honestly, it did take a while (like, two weeks) for my skin to clear up personally, but it&#x27;s worth the wait! I had constant acne and I was always hitting it with the harsh stuff - benzyl peroxide, salicylic acid and such. It&#x27;s amazing how my skin repaired itself when I took a gentler, natural route. I know that everybody&#x27;s skin is different, and the Konjac sponge might not work for you, but even if it doesn&#x27;t work you&#x27;ve only lost ten dollars. It&#x27;s worth the try!&lt;br /&gt;By the way, I heard about this product from mamanatural.com and bought it because Genevieve spoke so highly of it.</li>
    <li> Omg!!! I love this sponge. My face looks amazing, it&#x27;s is baby soft and acne is cleared up in just a week.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m buying everyone in family one for Christmas</li>
    <li> This is the first Konjac Sponge I&#x27;ve ever tired so far so good. I am 27 years old and already noticing signs of aging. My forehead keeps breaking out perhaps because of my hormones. I always had to use make up to cover up my dull face. But since I don&#x27;t want to spend too much time putting make up on everday(I get tired and I don&#x27;t want to be late at work too), I tried looking for natural remedy for the face to improve texture and skin tone and found out about konjac sponge. It was delivered 5 days after I ordered it. It was quick! I was so excited to try it. I didn&#x27;t have to soak it in water, I just let it soak in warm running water. After two days of using it, I already noticed the result. I use it every evening with my daily cleanser which is Cetaphil and it does its job. My forehead&#x27;s skin tone was more even that I didn&#x27;t have to use make up at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After 2 weeks of using this Konjac Sponge, my face looks more even and smooth every after use. I am now using it twice a day, morning and evening to maximize the result. Although the changes isn&#x27;t really drastic, I felt that my face has improved a lot and I no longer use make up. At all. I&#x27;m open to trying out other brand of Konjac sponge and I&#x27;ll update this review soon.</li>
    <li> Sponge softened normally in water but then became way too soft to provide any exfoliation. I don&#x27;t perceive any effect from using the sponge. I even tried drying it completely and only wetting a portion but that didn&#x27;t help. I don&#x27;t see any benefit with this product.</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive, overly chemically exfoliated skin. I love I use this sponge with an oil face wash. It&#x27;s so gentle and never has that musty sponge odor.</li>
    <li> This sponge is awesome.  When it is wet it is so squishy and soft on your skin.  I didn&#x27;t know what to expect with it but since I started using it my skin is noticeably smoother and more healthy looking.  I am not much of a beauty products kind of girl but this one is awesome and I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Have used a clarisonic for many years. I absolutely love this sponge. I use it in the AM and use my clarisonic at night. Definitely feel the difference, my skin is softer, smoother and I feel it has helped decrease the occurrence of acne.</li>
    <li> I love this product, it simplifies my daily routine. My skin is not as oily as before and I have less breakouts. I recently tried Proactiv and was not pleased. This is a great product and I would recommend it to anyone. It&#x27;s all natural, I love the fact that it is also biodegradable.</li>
    <li> I have bought 3 of these for my teenaged boys.  They work and really take more effort than washing their faces.</li>
    <li> Not sure if this product is really helping my face. When i switched to this product i also changed my face cleanser. However, I do like the sponge and it does a nice job cleaning my skin between my clarsonic days. I feel like it provides just enough soft exfoliation on the face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Its been a few months and still going strong.. yes, i should replace it every few months... but i just drop it in boiling water to hopefully kill residual bacteria/germs. Overall, i think it&#x27;s a great product for the price and how it is used.</li>
    <li> Great for daily facial cleansing with or without cleanser. Soft enough to use around the eyes and lips and still exfoliate your nose and forehead. Comes with a string to hang it up for drying. Does not fully dry between uses, so I will be sanitizing it in the microwave.</li>
    <li> This leaves my skin so smooth. Lovely.  I wash my face first with mild cleanser and my hands, then rinse and use this very gentle sponge/exfoliator in circular motions in both directions, clockwise and counter clockwise, then rinse out well and hang to dry.  My first one was flawed and fell apart. They promptly replaced it.  After it gets dried out I soak it a few minutes to make it soft for use again. I use it two or three times a week.</li>
    <li> Loved it. My face is normally oily but the sponge deffinatly helps with that as well.</li>
    <li> Nice shape but went with a charcoal infused sponge instead.</li>
    <li> Found out about this product on youtube. Have been using it for the past week, and am loving it. Soft enough to use everyday, but effective enough to exfoliate dead skin cells. I will be reordering this product for sure.</li>
    <li> So soft and nice!  I found that I can use even less of my facial cleanser when used with this sponge.  Feels great.</li>
    <li> I know that Konjac is good for diet (Dr.Oz has talked about health benefits of Konjac sometimes in the past episodes) but I was a bit skeptical if this it was also good for skin.  I&#x27;ve been gently massaging my skin after I washed my face with this sponge.  Honestly I couldn&#x27;t tell any difference after a week of use, but now I&#x27;ve been using for almost 3 weeks and  just noticed last night that my pores on my nose look smaller.  Also, I have a combination skin (dry skin around eye and cheek area buy oily around nose and chin area) but my nose and chin area are less oily now so I don&#x27;t have to fix my make up as often.  All I&#x27;ve been doing is just a few minutes of konjac sponge massage every night.  If you are looking for an additional easy beauty routine, this would be it.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t really seen a crazy difference since using it, like some of the other comments were saying so if you&#x27;re looking for a big difference in your complexion, I don&#x27;t really think you should expect that from just using his sponge. I do still like it however, it&#x27;s nice to use with your normal face wash.</li>
    <li> I have really enjoyed the sponge. So far so good. I would reorder</li>
    <li> I have always had red cheeks and irritating acne, and I have never been able to consistently combat them -- until I used this charcoal konjac sponge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This charcoal konjac sponge is exactly what I needed to get a daily yet gentle exfoliation to calm my skin and remove dead, flaky skin. This is drastically different from my previous routine, relying on using the twice-a-week exfoliating creams, but I realize now that my sensitive, combination skin needed exfoliating every day. I use this every night with my favorite cleanser. Now, my skin is more even, less spotty, and glowing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And another great feature is that this sponge is really economical and sustainable. I was thinking of buying the $199 Foreo Luna silicone handheld cleansing device which has a 2-year warranty. But at $10 a pop, this sponge lasts for 3 months, so the yearly cost would be $40 while the Foreo would be about $100/year. (Granted, the Foreo Luna has a 10-year quality guarantee, but it isn&#x27;t bio-degradable, so that was a turn-off for me.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In brief, I really recommend this sponge for its gentle exfoliation properties and incredible value.</li>
    <li> This product is great as an alternative to skin care, especially for one with sensitive skin.  I use this product in alteration with my clairsonic and may I add....this has done wonders for my face.  You also have a choice of what kind you want, which is a plus!</li>
    <li> Ugh what to say...this is just a regular sponge. Should&#x27;ve just got the Bochia one from Sephora. $10 wasted. :(</li>
    <li> My husband swears by this and the white body konjac. We order a new one ever 4-8 weeks, always consistently good.</li>
    <li> item came cracked resulting in a torn sponge when wet, simply feels like a rather slimey soft sponge, don&#x27;t like this on my face at all.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t do anything for my skin.</li>
    <li> Skin feels amazing even after just one use. Noticeable acne improvement within 2 uses.</li>
    <li> I like it. It feels great on my skin which is somewhat sensitive. Not sure how long I can use one for though.</li>
    <li> Awesome product and fast shipping highly recommended!</li>
    <li> I have been using a Clarisonic for some time now, and while I love it I find myself grabbing for the konjac sponge. I feel the exfoliation is gentle but effective.  My skin feels so smooth after using it. To disinfect it I pop a container of water in the microwave for 2 minutes then submerge the sponge. I do this once a week to keep everything sanitary. Great stocking stuffer idea for sister/friends,</li>
    <li> I have been wanting to try this sponge for a while. I got to try it for FREE, what better way to try something. I have been using this sponge for 4 days now, it is amazing! You can use this product with just water or with a facial cleaner...I have only used it with a water. It glides across your skin leaving it feeling (literally) squeaky clean. My husband couldn&#x27;t believe how clear my face is! I love the teardrop shape which fits nicely in the palm of your hand while you wash your face! I will defiantly be buying this product over and over!</li>
    <li> Perfect my teenage son.  He was starting to get black heads on his nose and with the sponge the black heads are almost gone.</li>
    <li> Loooove. Leaves skin soft and smooth. Gentle on skin.</li>
    <li> A regular sponge works just as well. :-(</li>
    <li> I really enjoyed the Konjac Sponge. When I first received it it&#x27;s hard in which you need to soak under water to soften up. Before I read the directions I was extremely hesitant to try it. Upon putting it under the water, it started to soften up in which I just worked the water through so it would soften up the parts that seem to be more resistant to getting wet. I just just used a circular motioned over my whole face and upon finishing the last spot, I could feel a huge difference. The oiliness that I have, regardless of what I do, was next to none. I don&#x27;t have too much oil to where I have a shine, but enough that it&#x27;s there when I touch my face, especially around my nose and chin. I break out a lot in that area. Just the 2 or so minutes of using (I may have used it longer then needed but I thought the first time I may want to go out of my way to ensure it&#x27;s clean up) it was a tremendous difference. It&#x27;s easily able to be washed out and comes with a handy string to have it hang up and air/drip dry. It&#x27;s about the size of my palm, give or take so it&#x27;s a nice decent size that&#x27;s not too big to handle yet big enough to get the job done. I&#x27;m extremely happy with this product and I can&#x27;t wait to see what&#x27;ll happen with me continue usage!</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing! Ive tried this one &amp; the white regular one. Absolutely love them both. Highly recommend!! My skin is so much softer after using &amp; after using this one, my acne has improved.</li>
    <li> I very much enjoy the sponge. It has a very light  scrubbing quality that is soothing to my face</li>
    <li> Loved trying this sponge out.  I was given this for free to try, and I have to say it exfoliates and cleanses very well.  It rinses out clean and lasts for a very long time.  My skin is better cleansed and looking good!</li>
    <li> Game changer, love!!!</li>
    <li> This sponge feels like it&#x27;s not doing anything, but I love the results! It makes my very acne-prone face feel great. Soft exfoliation rather than harsh!</li>
    <li> makes my face feel clean and fresh and i have noticed that it isnt ad oily in the mornings and the blackheads are going away.</li>
    <li> It feels very nice on my skin. It&#x27;s super soft. Just when I put a cleanser on it, it gets absorbed too quickly and doesn&#x27;t make foam. Not a big deal but I like my foam. Also, it doesn&#x27;t clean all of make up of. I still love it a lot. Good help</li>
    <li> good and soft .Would like to recommend to the friends and will buy more for my daugter</li>
    <li> At first I thought it wasn&#x27;t doing anything by way of exfoliation—I&#x27;m used to that cheese grater feeling when I get my scrub on. But it&#x27;s a lighter touch, and it works! I&#x27;m able to use it every day, and my skin is smooth and ready for toning.</li>
    <li> Not only is the product great (and actually helped me clear my face up), but I received an appreciation email from the owner thanking me for my purchase. To me, being interactive in some form with your customers is a big plus and because of that I will def stay a Konjac customer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Onto the product, the shape is perfect for washing different parts of my face, especially around my nose. You have to be delicate with the string that&#x27;s attached, I accidentally pulled it with a a bit of force and it almost ripped off the sponge. I like the string because it allows me to just hang up the sponge to dry. It&#x27;s easy to use and enjoy it. Price isn&#x27;t much, so good value for a good price.</li>
    <li> I was complaining to a friend of mine about how tired I was of my adult acne (I&#x27;m 37  but apparently my pores still think I&#x27;m 16) and she asked me if I had ever heard of these sponges. My first thought was, \\&quot;How in the world could a sponge make any difference?\\&quot;  But after what she told me and doing some further research, I figured it wouldn&#x27;t hurt to try it.  Heck,  I&#x27;ve spent hundreds in facial-care  products that didn&#x27;t help,  what was a few more dollars?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; When I first tried it, I used  it  as part of my nightly routine.  It seemed to work just fine,  but it was the next day when I realized this thing just might work!  My normally oily face was smooth and not the slightest bit oily!! I noticed a significant improvement in just a couple of days.  Within 2  weeks I had not a single pimple on my face!  Let me tell you,  there aren&#x27;t a lot of products I can claim have been life-changing,  but this one has been nothing short of a miracle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* I do want to warn that not all konjac  sponges are created equal. I tried a less-expensive  one and was sorely disappointed.  It got mildewy  in just a few days and my acne came back! I will definitely stick to this brand only from now on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**Another update that I feel the need to share! A few months ago my eyes started getting really scratchy and itchy. I had no idea what was causing it. I went to the eye doctor 3 times, tried allergy medications and 3 types of eyedrops. Nothing was helping. I then realized I had been using my konjac sponge for a few months and decided to stop using it to see if it was the culprit. Sure enough, within 2 days my eyes were back to normal! So just be really careful not to use your sponge too long -- I think it was starting to break down and I was getting particles of the sponge in my eyes. Now I take care not to use it on my eyes at all, and I replace it every couple of months.</li>
    <li> Gentle but effective. Soft on the skin but helps gently to exfoliate your face. It&#x27;s just a little hard to travel with - but I like it so much that I won&#x27;t go any where with out it!</li>
    <li> I am an adult who has had almost no acne during puberty, but started breaking out (face, chest, back) when I hit the age of 19. I&#x27;ve been using this sponge every night for about a year and my face is now very clear. Of course, there are other factors that probably play into this, such as my face wash (L&#x27;oreal 360 Clean Anti-breakout, which I&#x27;ve been using for over a year), my diet, makeup, and the amount of sleep I get, but I do notice that whenever I switch to a new sponge (every 3-4 months), any acne on my face at the time will clear up relatively quickly, and it will stay pretty clear for a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried two brands of charcoal konjac sponges in the last year. I haven&#x27;t seen much difference between this (My Konjac Sponge) and pureSOL&#x27;s konjac sponge when it comes to the effect on my skin. However, the reason I prefer My Konjac Sponge to pureSOL&#x27;s sponge is its shape. This sponge is thinner, so it dries quicker, and it has a wider and flatter surface, which makes it easier to make contact with my face.</li>
    <li> Works great for my teen sons skin.  Helps keep the break outs and black heads away without any harsh chemicals.</li>
    <li> I really enjoy using Konjiac Sponge. I have very oily but sensitive skin and physical scrubs irritate my skin easily; so this is perfect for me – very gentle and effective.</li>
    <li> I bought an oEder for me and loved them do much I gifted my sister on mothers day, she loves hers also.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll begin my review by telling you that there is nothing I haven&#x27;t tried in the realm of facial care products.  I&#x27;ve fought with acne since I was nine years old and have tried topicals, lasers, chemical peels, antibiotics, and everything in between.  If someone were to tell me that rubbing dog mess on my face and chanting the alphabet in Chinese would help my skin battles, I&#x27;d be outside prompting my dog to get on with her business.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said, it&#x27;s summer--and brutal--where I live, so this means the oil glands are in overdrive.  I wash my face twice daily and use a prescription acne topical that usually keeps the problems at bay.  As of late, I&#x27;d noticed that, in spite of this careful maintenance routine, I was still waking to a woefully greasy face.  In fact, within an hour of washing, my face was gunk-nasty with oil again.  Anyone with oily skin will tell you that over-washing or over-medicating is a fast way to make your skin freak out and retaliate.  My topical also tends to severely dry my face in some spots, and finding a balance seemed more a dream than a possibility.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t remember the source that educated me about the Konjac sponge, but when I read about it, I was intrigued and figured the sponge a cheap &amp;#34;try it and see&amp;#34; purchase.  At the time, I was peeling badly and needed something gentle to help my terribly flaky-yet-inexplicably-oily skin.  There are several kinds of Konjac sponges, all crafted for specific skin types; I chose the one for acne-prone skin since that&#x27;s what I normally am fighting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I could not be happier with this product!!!  I wash my face to remove all makeup, then I go back over my freshly-cleansed face with my Konjac.  My skin gets a healthy, gentle rub from the sponge with NO risk of irritation.  I have used Clairisonics before, and those only made my breakouts worse, even with the most gentle brush.  I&#x27;ve been using the Konjac charcoal for a couple of weeks and am very pleased.  The sponge gently remedied the flaking issue, and I no longer experience Grease Face right after washing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I plan to buy the dry skin Konjac for a friend who has painful dryness on his forehead every fall.  He, too, has tried a multitude of things to alleviate the discomfort of overly dry skin, and I&#x27;m going to encourage him to give the Konjac a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For $10, you can&#x27;t go wrong.  The Konjac won&#x27;t cure acne, but it will certainly be kind and helpful to already troubled skin.  Make sure to rinse thoroughly after each use and hang to dry.  A quick trip through the microwave is an excellent disinfectant for this kicky little sponge.gently remedied the flaking issue, and I no longer experience Grease Face right after washing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I plan to buy the dry skin Konjac for a friend who has painful dryness on his forehead every fall.

    <li> Love the clean skin feeling get when use it on my face.  I am a &amp;#34;senior&amp;#34; &amp; my skin is beginning to be very dry, regarless of how much cream I use.  This little sponge, which is a perfect size for my hand, is exactly what was needed.  I do not rub hard, just gently smooth all over my face.  When rinse, it has a nice creamy feel &amp; not as rough... My daughter says she can feel the difference.  Awesome! .  My skin has always been senstive, but have had no problems with the Konjac. Will certainly order again</li>
    <li> Excellent exfoliation product! Arrived very quickly.</li>
    <li> Gently scrubs face. Good for sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> Awesome product because it has a string to hang it up to dry. The sponge is huge when it expands with the water in it. It feels amazing on my skin. The best part about this sponge is it doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin at all I could rub this sponge twice on my face and it doesn&#x27;t burn my skin. Also I love how there is only three ingredients in this sponge. I feel like it is exfoliating my skin nicely without being painful scrubbing feeling from liquid exfoliates with beads inside them. It is very gentle on my skin so I could use it once or twice a day. Also it gets rid of the dry flakes I get on my face from products. I got his product for free to review as part of a promotion.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a minimalist when it comes to skin care, but I have recently started searching for high quality products that clean my face well. I have been using it for the past few weeks with my favorite drug store cleanser and have had zero breakouts since. I bought this sponge based on a review that it works very similar to another popular (expensive) cleansing device. I splurged and spent money on that device and rarely used it, but I can say that I feel that this sponge cleans my face better than that did. I already bought another sponge so that I have a replacement when my current sponge starts to break down. I will continue to buy for many years to come! This sponge is amazing! I&#x27;m completely obsessed with it and with washing my face now. Your skin will never feel smoother.</li>
    <li> I have been using the face sponge for about 3 weeks now. I can definitely see an improvement in my skin. My pores are smaller and the texture is more even. I like the results so much that I have purchased sponges for my husband and two granddaughters. The girls are at the age where they have breakouts. We are all loving these sponges and will continue to use them.</li>
    <li> I love this sponge it has cleared up my acne and made my skin glow. I will defiantly be purchasing this again in the future.</li>
    <li> ive struggled with acne my whole life and this has helped clear up my complexion! after a couple weeks of use my pores were smaller and my acne had noticeably subsided. i love that this product also has the string so that can hang it up to dry. definitely need this!</li>
    <li> This is a curious product. I don&#x27;t like using abrasive scrubs for the fact that they irritate my skin. This looked at first seemed like a much gentler alternative, especially for the dry winter months when my skin tends to be flakey. The texture is gelatinous when moistened, and it didn&#x27;t feel rough as I used this in the shower. It didn&#x27;t really help my flakey skin, and it left areas rather shiny and red, and made my skin more flakey. Also, I broke out in red welts. I&#x27;ve discontinued this, and feel grossed out that you can never really get this &amp;#34;sponge&amp;#34; clean after even one use.</li>
    <li> Ive bought a charcoal sponge just like this in a heart shape from a different brand a while back. It said on the box it should last about 3 months with proper care. Mine lasted way longer than that, probably closer to a year. I was going to repurcahse it when it finally started falling apart and when I searched it on here(Amazon) I saw this one and thought I&#x27;d give it a try. Its a bit larger than the heart-shaped one was and seems well made. I&#x27;ve had it about 2 months now and its still in fine condition. After soaping it up and cleansing my face, I rinse it out really well: I lay one hand out flat with the palm up and the sponge on my hand and hold it under running water while gently pressing downwards on top of it with my other hand, not all the way down but enough to push out some water and suds and suck in the fresh water. I keep doing this until no more suds are coming out. Then I gently press together 1-3 times outside of water to get most of the water out. DO NOT WRING IT or squeeze it tightly. I then press it lightly in between a towel 2 times using the same hand method as above and then hang it on its string on a hook to air dry. ALWAYS AIR DRY this. It will last you a long time too and its well worth the money then. Its gentle on my skin and leaves it feeling soft and clean.</li>
    <li> I first came on Amazon looking for just any sponge to really work the face wash into my face.  I ended up stumbling upon these for acne prone skin.  I was very excited about the reviews and purchased them immediately.  However, I never saw any change in my acne.  It just kept on coming.  This feels great on the skin and works well for applying face wash - but it didn&#x27;t help my acne any.  Will not buy again.</li>
    <li> My new favorite find!  I have sensitive skin that turns red at the slightest irritant.  I LOVE this sponge as I can use it to clean my face with just water (no cleanser necessary).&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s also great for camping or travelling as it dries quickly to a stone-like hardness &#x3D; easy packing.</li>
    <li> Maybe I just don&#x27;t get it, but for all the hoopla around Konjac sponges, I expected to be more impressed with this. I don&#x27;t feel that it is all that exfoliating, and the texture is a little too jelly for me.</li>
    <li> I love using this - it is light weight, and creates a great foam with my cleanser when I wet the sponge prior to use. The sponge itself provides a nice resistance when cleanosing my face, but is not scratchy. The texture when wetted feels soft and pliant. If you are looking for a stiff, coarse sponge, this is not your product. It dries easily, I hang mine in my bath tub, and it would fully dry in a day and a half.</li>
    <li> I love how after I used this on my skin it felt so good, it was silky soft.  It has definitely helped with my dry skin - it&#x27;s gotten rid of the extra skin on my face and helped reduce all the dry spots on my skin!</li>
    <li> After I was provided with the Konjac Sponge free to try, my son who is 19 and has acne has been using the sponge. His face has been much smoother and clearer ever since. It really works in cutting the oil on his skin and clearing up any blackheads. Would definitely order this product again.</li>
    <li> I love this sponge! I never write product reviews, but this really gets the job done. I have pretty sensitive, oily, acne-prone skin. I can never use exfoliators because they are so irritating, but I usually have patches of dry skin that makes my complexion look really uneven. With this sponge, I can exfoliate without irritating, and it keeps my skin smooth as a baby&#x27;s butt - NO LIE! It&#x27;s really amazing. I think it might have made my pores clearer, though my skin hasn&#x27;t been breaking out recently so I can&#x27;t say for sure. The one problem I would say is that it never really dries out even though I hang it up. But I will take the package advice and boil it every month to sterilize.</li>
    <li> I love these sponges. They make my skin feel so amazing and it does a great job at clearing up breakouts.</li>
    <li> When I first saw this product, I thought for sure it was a joke. Once I tried it, I was sold. My skin feels so different, at first I couldn&#x27;t stop touching my face. That&#x27;s how much my skin improved -- instantly. It&#x27;s been a long time since I&#x27;ve gone out and faced the world with only a little powder, instead of tons of concealer, foundation, etc. The amazing part of this sponge is that although it exfoliates, it is very mild in the treatment it has on your skin. Really, I can&#x27;t imagine how this really works, but the absolute fact is that it does! I will never be without this Konjac Sponge again, I guarantee that. Sample provided for review, and I can state unequivocally that it will amaze you with its effectiveness!</li>
    <li> Repeat customer. I love my sponge as my facial breakouts has decreased significantly</li>
    <li> I had one of these in our shower and after I had used it for a couple months, I figured it was time to toss it. A couple months later, my husband specially requested I buy another one because he loved the way it made his skin look. I had no idea he was also using it, but if he was asking for one, we both must love the way it makes our skin look and feel.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this for a little over a week now, and so far I love it. A Konjac sponge saved me while I was taking Accutane, and after finishing my treatment I decided to buy this one to help clear up what acne I have left. My skin ALWAYS feels great after I use this. I haven&#x27;t had a bad skin day so far since. I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s done anything in the way of clearing up my acne, but I have my boyfriend use this so he at least cleans his face and I think it has definitely helped clear up the sparse acne he gets around his mouth. After this one is retired, I&#x27;ll absolutely be buying another one from here. Hopefully by then I won&#x27;t be needing the acne-specializing sponge.</li>
    <li> Have used this each day, sometimes twice per day but, don&#x27;t see any difference.  There are others to choose from, so maybe this particular one is not for me.</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;ve never used a konjac sponge, you need to know that they are THE BOMB. It blows my mind that something that is basically a perfectly shaped piece of vegetable root could be the best face cleanser ever. You will be amazed at how smooth, bright and exfoliated your skin is using these and after about a week of regular use your pores will become absolutely tiny. No special sauce needed, just this sponge and some water. If you still want to use cleanser with it, you just need a drop as the sponge will make it foam up like nobody&#x27;s business.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You have NO EXCUSE now not to wash your face before bed because this is about as low maintenance as it gets. Get it wet. Rub it on your face. Go to bed. Boom. Done. It even gets off makeup and it&#x27;s naturally ph balanced to keep your skin gorgeous without needing toner. Plus, it doesn&#x27;t dry out your skin like so many cleanser can. The charcoal in it does extra pore cleansing and tightening and is ideal for blemish prone skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On top of everything, I LOVE the size of this one- I&#x27;ve gotten these in so many sizes and shapes, but this is easily the largest sized one I&#x27;ve gotten, making it easy to hold. I&#x27;m impressed that they have so many varieties available as well, I&#x27;ve only ever tried the white ones and the charcoal ones- I&#x27;d be interested to see the difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I may have gotten this for review purposes, but trust me, this is a REAL TWO THUMBS UP!</li>
    <li> This sponge is one of the best things I&#x27;ve ever purchased. It has drastically simplified my morning routine and my skin feels softer than ever.&lt;br /&gt;I no longer have to use a facial soap/cleanser in the mornings. There is enough abrasiveness and bamboo charcoal to make my face feel clean and awakened. I also only use facial scrubs/exfoliators once every two week, yet the incidence of having flakey dead skin on my face has drastically gone down. I&#x27;m not sure what this is doing for my skin, but I definitely love it.</li>
    <li> I first heard of this on Kathleen Lights YouTube channel and wanted to try it because her word is practically gospel. I was dubious the first times I tried it with no result by itself, but then I remembered that Kathleen uses hers with her face wash and tried that instead. The result was instantaneous. The sponge allowed the face wash to have a greater impact and thorough reach into my pores to wash out the impurities and left a soft feel to my face. I won&#x27;t say it&#x27;s a miracle worker, because my idea of a miracle worker is complete transformation to flawless skin, but it is definitely a repurchase. I love it so much that I am actually writing my first review ever. Definite must have :D</li>
    <li> Fast shipping! Great product!!! 😁👍🏻</li>
    <li> I suffer from adult acne which was shocking to me at first.  I try my best to take care of my health and do right by my skin. I had the most beautiful skin when I was younger and as I have gotten older it has changed drastically in a major way. So I was ready to give anything a try if it would tame the unwanted acne from invading my life. When I received My Konjac Sponge at first I must say I was like what is this and what is this going to do to help me. With an opened mind, I read the directions and followed them to the letter. When I took the sponge out of the package it was hard as a rock and I said to my self, What am I suppose to do with this? Once I wet the sponge it became soft as can be and I did just want I was told to do and I must say surprisingly enough it felt great on my skin and the light exfoliation has done wonders for my skin. I have not noticed any major acne eruptions in the past few weeks and that make me extremely happy. To have a prodcut that it not electronic or costly do what My Konjac Sponge does is amazing. No one has an excuse as to why they do not give My Konjac Sponge a try!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*I received this for free to give my honest opinion.*</li>
    <li> When it dries up, it&#x27;s hard like styrofoam. Just soak it in water and it softens up again, in the consistency of a squishy pool noodle. It says it is an exfoliator, but I would say that it is VERY VERY VERY VERY gentle at that. I wanted more scrubbing action, but it is not rough enough to do that. I scrub it on my face for a few minutes while I watch TV and my skin does feel smoother. BUT I think if I did the same thing with a wet face towel/ wash cloth, I would get the same results.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a week now, and it&#x27;s definitely helped get rid of the black pores on my nose! Overall, it&#x27;s helped reduce the oil on my face, though it has made my nose very dry - perhaps it&#x27;s because it&#x27;s where I&#x27;ve been scrubbing the most though. :)</li>
    <li> Feels great on skin, works very well.</li>
    <li> Skin broke out like crazy.</li>
    <li> I have been using this sponge for several weeks now and I havent touched my clarisonic brush since.  I have a very sensitive skin/acne prone skin.  Regular clarisonic brush was too harsh for my skin and even acne brush was still harsh so I had to use it lightly on my skin.  But this thing is soft on my skin and yet exfoliates dry patches/dead skin. I love it. will def buy again.</li>
    <li> It seemed to work okay for a few months but then it stopped being effective. Initially it did mop up a lot of the oil on my face and clear up my complexion, but after a few months my breakouts came back, no matter how many times a day I cleaned my face.  I tried replacing the sponge as recommended by other reviewers but it simply stopped working.  I don&#x27;t know if my face adapted and became resistant to the sponge, but I switched back to Neutrogena&#x27;s Proactiv competitor and have had much better success.  I would say give it a shot.  Everybody&#x27;s body is different and it&#x27;s a relatively small investment.  It does seem to work as advertised, my face always felt soft and clean after using it...it just didn&#x27;t last.  Maybe your face is less stubborn than mine! :)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this a few days now, and so far so good...no over-drying, feels nice on the skin too!</li>
    <li> I am so pleased with this sponge. It exfoliates delightfully and gently, makes your face wash last so much longer, and is fantastic for travel. I am back to buy another to keep at the gym!</li>
    <li> I have mature skin but still issues with clogged pores on my chin. Saw an improvement immediately! Will be ordering another for my son.</li>
    <li> I have been using this Charcoal Konjac sponge by My Konjac Sponge for about a month now.  When it arrived I was a bit unsure how to hold it as I had been using smaller facial konjac sponges.  After a couple days I was able to get my coordination with the larger meaty part in my palm and using the pointy end for working around my face.  This sponge is made from natural konjac, a Japanese yam, with the infusion of bamboo charcoal.  This sponge is a bit softer and less dense than my previous konjac sponges.  This is almost the consistency of the Ethiopian sourdough pancakes that are used to scoop up entree dishes which are well, spongy.  Right..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;#konjacsponge&lt;br /&gt;The sponge has the addition of bamboo charcoal to help scrub away oils and impurities.  There is not any gritty feeling in this sponge.  It does not have the strong scrubbing feel that you might expect of an exfoliator.  But I have really found that this sponge does exactly what I need in getting my face cleaned and oil free.  I enjoy the way I can get this sponge to contour over my face and clean in massaging circles.</li>
    <li> I have had really good results with this sponge. I am 38, use each night with a bit of Neutrogena acne wash (witch hazel in morning), and after a couple weeks realized I no longer had much adult acne, especially the deeper kind. While I&#x27;m not 100% clear, I&#x27;m so significantly better that this will be a permanent part of my routine. I&#x27;m so thankful to have found it!</li>
    <li> LOVE THIS!! I no longer have any problems with dry skin at all. It&#x27;s soft and not at all rough on my skin and I use it whenever I wash my face. I loved it and so does my brother since I had to buy him one of his own after he saw mine.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t find this very useful at all.  I used it a bunch of times and I just didn&#x27;t see that it was helpful.</li>
    <li> Gentle on skin. Very mild exfoliant. Not very easy to rinse out (soaps, oils, etc.).</li>
    <li> I have very dry skin and I don&#x27;t feel like this product was rough enough to remove my dry, flakey skin. However, I do feel like it helped to get down deeper and clean my skin than just face wash.</li>
    <li> I really enjoyed this Konjac Sponge and I have definitely been using it everyday. It did not dry out my skin and it was very gentle and easy to use. The instructions on the back of the packaging was very helpful and told me exactly what I needed to do. I also like the fact that you don&#x27;t have to use an extra product/cleanser with the sponge if you do not want to and you still get really clean and clear skin. I will definitely be purchasing another the next time around.</li>
    <li> I have tried a couple of different Konjac sponges in the past - both this charcoal one and the yellow / turmeric one for anti-aging. I&#x27;ve now purchased several of these charcoal ones and turmeric ones. I have to say this charcoal one is my favorite.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This one stays softer and more expanded when wet. It&#x27;s a bit larger in size and is the perfect size, shape and flexibility for a really good face cleansing. The turmeric one shrinks up considerably when it&#x27;s dry and is very hard (rock-like, actually). It&#x27;s difficult to get enough moisture in the dry sponge to use it very well. It&#x27;s not the case with the charcoal one so that&#x27;s why I prefer this. Perhaps it has something to do with the different &#x27;ingredients.&#x27; I also think I can benefit more from the anti-acne properties of the charcoal sponge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have found my face is breaking out A LOT less since discontinuing my old face washing routine and replacing with the Konjac sponge about 7-8 months ago. I used to wipe my makeup off some with a makeup wipe, then wash my face with my Clarisonic brush. The Clarisonic is a great product and is not bad to use here and there to really knock the dirt from beneath the top layers of your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, my face always feels cleaner after I just use this sponge and a dab of Philosophy face wash. It must be getting it cleaner, because without changing anything else, my face is not breaking out nearly like it used to. The directions say you can wash with the sponge without soap; however, I still prefer to use a little face wash. With that said, using this sponge allows the wash to foam up better than on the Clarisonic brush or even just when washing by hand. So really you barely need any face wash to cleanse your face. For that, it&#x27;s extended the shelf life of my face wash too, which I appreciate!</li>
    <li> This sponge is very gentle and it saves a lot of soap. I would buy this sponge for friends as a gift.</li>
    <li> I love it... leaves my face smooth and silky.</li>
    <li> I was hoping this thing would exfoliate a bit more - I am a 33 yr old with acne, and I use a lot of prescription drying agents so exfoliation is key. Once wet, this thing is almost mushy. But I&#x27;ve discovered to rub my soap on my face, then begin scrubbing with the sponge mostly dry, then as it becomes wet it softens. Get best of both worlds.</li>
    <li> This is a great product. The sponge is very soft and works!</li>
    <li> Love the sponge! It works great on my sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> Holy gentle, batman! Don&#x27;t worry about using to much pressure on your face, this awesome black teardrop is gentle as hell! I tend to have a heavy hand when exfoliating, which has often left my face raw, dry, and hating me. I didn&#x27;t have to worry about over-exfoliating, because its so soft and fluffy, it&#x27;s what I&#x27;d think a cloud would feel like (if...you know, they weren&#x27;t water). The best BEST part? You&#x27;d think because it&#x27;s so gentle it wouldn&#x27;t cleanse very well, right?? WRONG! I could FEEL it cleansing as I was rubbing it in small circles around my face. I rubbed in my normal cleanser a bit, then used the sponge to make it a foamy cleansing mess. Afterwards, my face never felt SOO SMOOTH and CLEAN. I was absolutely amazed, and after my shower just kept muttering to myself and touching my face saying &amp;#34;Wow, wow it&#x27;s so soft. It&#x27;s amazing. Is this my skin?&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s been a few weeks since I&#x27;ve had it, and using it nightly in the shower (along with the body Konjac sponge with is A+++ as well!) and I can see a difference in my face. My skin tone has been more even, and doesn&#x27;t have the dull &#x27;is she sick?&#x27; look to it. It has what I&#x27;d not necessarily call a &#x27;glow&#x27;, but that&#x27;s probably the closest word I could get. &#x27;Healthy&#x27; would work as well. My skin looks healthy. I will DEFINEITLY continue to buy this (and body sponge) every 3-4 months instead old fashion loofas.</li>
    <li> Gently exfoliates and makes my face clean and fresh without blackheads. Good size. Very soft and gently. I like it for my combination sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t get the hype with these sponges. I used mine a couple times on my face but it was nothing special. Now it sits by the sink and I use it for washing my hands after gardening. It helps remove the dirt as well as any sponge. Decent sponge , just not special</li>
    <li> excellent it&#x27;s help me</li>
    <li> I had no idea what to expect. Based on the description of this sponge, I thought it was going to be rough and scratchy. It was awesome when I used it for the first time. My skin felt so soft afterwards. I&#x27;ll probably purchase another :)</li>
    <li> turn around time was great, love the charcoal and natural sponge for deep cleaning.</li>
    <li> I received this complimentary for review purposes. This review is 100% my opinion and am I no way affiliated with this company. My whole life I have struggled with acne and annoying black heads. Since I’ve discovered this konjac sponge my face has cleared up so much! I love the fact it’s 100% natural konjac fiber because I feel a lot better putting something on my face that is natural compared to some harmful acne products out there. All I do is wet the sponge until it is soft and then massage on my face. After, I clean the sponge I hang it up right in my shower and I’m good to go! This sponge doesn’t dry out my face and makes it feel super clean. When I use acne products I usually have to use a clarifying lotion and with this I don’t it’s almost like an exfoliator but much more gentle on skin. Just in a few days I have noticed big improvement. A few months to have something that makes my face feel this good is definitely worth repurchasing. When I buy acne products it lasts me about a month because of frequent use so this ends up saving me time and money in the end anyways.</li>
    <li> I saw reviews for this sponge and was very hopeful that it would help clear my skin. Within a week of using the sponge twice daily, I was seeing results. While it can&#x27;t keep my skin clear constantly, that&#x27;s only natural. It is an amazing product, and I would suggest going for this brand over some of the more expensive versions by other beauty lines. I have suggested it to many of my friends, and I will definitely repurchase.</li>
    <li> The sponge is soft and does a good cleansing job on my face.  I love it.</li>
    <li> Bought this because every other cleanser wasn&#x27;t working well for and was drying out my skin like no other!!! I have really happy with it, it feels great. I like to cleanse my face with it for a solid minute to exfoliate :) it works as a gentle exfoliator nicely. It doesn&#x27;t dry my skin out at all! After washing my face with it I feel refreshed and super smooth. I don&#x27;t know if I would use this if you had sever or really bad acne, it keeps my pimples at bay for the most part, but I still get break outs. Doesn&#x27;t come with detailed instructions however, so I look up YouTube videos on the sponge, they say to replace after 2-3 months. I looks like I should replace every month though. Overall, nice product!</li>
    <li> This is a great konjac sponge.  It is bigger than other sponges I have used in the past.  I use it while in the shower and hang it up to dry.  I like using it in the shower so I don&#x27;t forget to use it.  My face felt noticeably smoother within a few days of using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did receive this product to review.  All opinions are my own.</li>
    <li> Great seller. I love the sponge</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s wow to clean your face deeply !</li>
    <li> This sponge is a miracle worker! I love it so much. I have purchased 3 within the last 6 months (two for me and one for a friend). Being able to boil them to kill bacteria and germs makes it an even better product. It distributes face wash very evenly on your skin and helps the product to foam up. Makes my skin feel squeaky clean!!! Two thumbs up!</li>
    <li> arrived super fast. very happy with the product, makes my skin look brighter and clear.&lt;br /&gt;haven&#x27;t broken out since i started using it. good sign ;) works as good if not better than&lt;br /&gt;my clarisonic.</li>
    <li> Terrific product--leaves my skin feeling smooth and soft, my skin is clearer and my pores have vanished. I just ordered a 2nd one so I have a back up when this one is retired (in a couple months).  I also ordered one for body. I&#x27;m sold on this sponge.</li>
    <li> Love these sponges, really cleared up my complexion.</li>
    <li> Great sponge for your face! It would be nice if they came in a larger pack as a reusable option because I like to change things like this out often.</li>
    <li> This was my first experience with a konjac sponge. I wasn’t very familiar with them beforehand but I did a little research and gave it a try. It was very… different. But in a good way. I’d soak the sponge in warm water for a couple minutes until it was completely soft, then gently scrub my face. It took a few days but I did begin to see less blackheads– and as of now, almost 5 weeks later, I haven’t seen a blackhead in a couple weeks. My skin is also much smoother. The konjac sponge is gentle but exfoliates well. I don’t really have any complaints except that it needs to be hung up to dry and it took me about a day to realize the only place to hang it in my bathroom was the robe hook behind the door. But that’s not really the sponge’s fault, is it? (^_-)</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t think this is the real konjac sponge. I&#x27;ve been using it to exfoliate my face every other day and I honestly don&#x27;t notice any difference. The blackheads on my nose are still there and I don&#x27;t really see any dirt or dead skin on the sponge after exfoliation.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this sponge for a couple of weeks, but after the first use I could feel a difference in my skin, and my face is a lot less oily for longer in the day.</li>
    <li> My first impression on seeing this product online and through photos is i thought it looked like a rough type of sponge like it would really scrub roughly on your skin to remove the dead skin cells but dont let its appearance fool you because its surprisingly gentle and soft, so don&#x27;t expect a real rough or harsh scrubbing type of exfoliating sponge. It does feel hard when you first remove it from its package but the instructions call for you to hold the sponge under running water to let the sponge absorb the water and once it does you should gently squeeze out the excess water which will leave the sponge with a very soft to the touch feel. But i feel the need to warn you if you have never used a kojac sponge then you must remember to not squeeze the sponge to hard or like you would a rag when trying to get all of the water from it because that will damage your konjac sponge. I did enjoy the size of the My Konjac Sponge because it was a bit bigger then any previous konjac sponges i have used in the past so i found that very nice because i felt it was much easier to manage when it was bigger in size.</li>
    <li> Had problems with shipping but it was resolved.&lt;br /&gt;Other than that I really like the sponge, I don&#x27;t feel like I got a lot of use out of it though before it started to feel &#x27;different&#x27;&lt;br /&gt;but I did notice the difference on how clean my face felt &#x3D;)</li>
    <li> I received this Konjac Sponge for free to try and review; regardless this is my 100% honest opinion. This sponge worked just as well as any of the other sponges I have tried of this type. I am giving this one a full 5 stars over the lower stars that I gave the others because the description was straight forward. It wasn&#x27;t promising any miracles of curing acne or improving skin like other sponges tend to do. I was expecting the sponge to help wash my face when using it along with my cleanser. It does that just fine, it has no weird smells and is gentle. It will help clean and exfoliate your face gently but it is not very rough so it won&#x27;t give a heavy exfoliation like some other products on the market making it safe enough for daily use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The sponge itself soaked up water quickly going from light hard rock to a soft squishy sponge. I like to put my facial cleanser directly on my wet face and then use this to wash the cleanser back off completely cleaning my face. I then squeeze it out and allow it to hang in my shower until I use it again the next day. It doesn&#x27;t leave any residue behind on my face and when I leave the shower my face feels clean and ready for my morning prep!</li>
    <li> If you don&#x27;t currently use a konjac sponge in your skincare routine you seriously need get your hands on one. These are so great at gently exfoliating your skin.</li>
    <li> Awesome stuff.  I&#x27;ve been having some acne issue on my forehead and I&#x27;ve used many facial items and there hasn&#x27;t been any DRAMATIC results even if these products have high raves.  So I decided to use the conjac sponge in combine with my product, and I have to say this is the KEY item.  I use it with warm water and it helps to open up the pore and clean out the pore real good.  At night time I wash my face with this in combination of the product i&#x27;ve been using WITH a serum .. KICKS the product right in.  Next morning I woke up and noticed the redness has gone down a whole lot and so did the blemishes.  WILL purchase again and it&#x27;s a definite recommend from me!</li>
    <li> Super gentle on my skin. I was a bit leery at first because I know charcoal can be harsh, but this has been so gentle and wonderful. I have already noticed a difference in my skin health and less acne! I want to try the body size next!</li>
    <li> I have used a lot of different type software sponges,  cleansers,  and scrubs for my oily skin.  So when I saw the Konjac Sponge I was a little skeptical.  After using it the first night I could not only see a difference but my face didn&#x27;t look like shiny.  The Konjac Sponge was super easy to use and I now use it in my nightly skin regiment.  Since using the Konjac Sponge my face still gets oily but no where compared to how it usually is.</li>
    <li> I buy a new one every couple months. I use this in the shower instead of a face wash - it&#x27;s gentler on my skin, doesn&#x27;t dry it out, but does a great job cleaning up oils... no soap needed!</li>
    <li> This sponge is everything! it is exfoliating but not too much so, it cleans off all my makeup and leaves my face feeling fresh. I&#x27;m so happy I could find an alternative to the $18 high end brand ones, this is all I will be using to wash my face now</li>
    <li> I ordered two of the sponges, one each for my 16 year old daughter and myself. So far, we are both very happy with it.  My daughter has the standard teenage acne flair ups and I have occassional mid-life break outs.  After using for a little over a week, we both are noticing a difference in our complexion.  We both have noticable clearer skin and very soft.  Yes, we like it and will order again when we need to.</li>
    <li> These work great!!  I love them and now use them all the time!!</li>
    <li> Cleared up the face and neck acne I&#x27;ve been suffering with since the age of 13, and I&#x27;m 31 now, I had tried almost everything.</li>
    <li> Happy with this product so far.</li>
    <li> Maybe my expectations were too high but based on previous reviews, I really expected this to last longer than 2 weeks. The pores on my nose do seem clearer which is nice but since the sponge breaks down so quickly I don&#x27;t feel that I can justify the cost.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m hooked to these things, dont know how its done or the science behind it but it works !!! I loved so much how it felt on my face and how quickly my complexion changed for the better that I purchase one for my sister in law who has always had problem skin and she to fell in Love</li>
    <li> Oh my goodness I did not think my face could feel so soft before moisturizer. I need to see if they have something like this for all over your body because I seriously felt AMAZING after I washed my face tonight!</li>
    <li> Love this sponge. It helps keep my face clear. I use it in the evenings. I make sure to hang it up after I use it.</li>
    <li> I love this sponge for it&#x27;s ability to gently exfoliate. The surface, when wet, has a slimy texture (but it doesn&#x27;t come off on to your finger or face) so it slides around effortlessly on your skin. The clay and texture exfoliate so gently. I&#x27;ve definitely noticed a great change in my face since starting to use it. Read the other reviews too for more info on how long it lasts etc! Definitely buying this again.</li>
    <li> If you want soft and smooth skin this is a must have product. It is easy to use.  Love it&lt;br /&gt;Will purchase again.</li>
    <li> I wanted a daily way to exfoliate my face, but scrubs are often too harsh and don&#x27;t work evenly.  This is gentle!  I mean, results begin to show days or a week after daily use.  That&#x27;s OK, as it&#x27;s gentle and not doing damage.  Between this and a chemical-exfoliating wash, my skin is less congested.  I have high hopes this will help keep dry patches at bay, black heads away, and clogged pores a thing of the past.</li>
    <li> Did nothing for my skin. My facial skin is without acne, or dark spots. It really didn&#x27;t do anything for me. As far as I was concerned to was just a weird looking cleansing sponge. It didn&#x27;t even feel that great. I felt it was a waste of my money.</li>
    <li> I associate konjac with jelly, so I expected it wouldn&#x27;t feel like an average sponge. In case you don&#x27;t make that association, it will come out of the packet feeling kind of moist and slimy (but there&#x27;s no slime, more like a outer film). There&#x27;s also a string threaded through which makes it really easy to hang in open air so it wont collect bacteria lying on a surface or against a mirror. After washing, it will dry and shrivel up very quickly, so you don&#x27;t have to worry about molds and such either!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It holds suds near the surface very well, so you don&#x27;t have to use a bajillion pumps of cleanser because the sponge just kept soaking it up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The exfoliation is verrry gentle, and in fact was too gentle for me. I have very dry skin which causes flaking and my facial skin to be kind of thick and ornery. I gave it a 4 because it wasn&#x27;t what I needed, but it&#x27;s actually a really quality sponge and I could see it working for other people. I did see slightly clearer skin, but my skin needs some heavy duty attention. It also has charcoal infused which is awesome for drawing out impurities but has no funky smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, gentle faced, acne-prone, oily, blackhead having friends, or people tired of using their hands to wash their face--This will work loads better on you. It&#x27;s really awesome.</li>
    <li> I wanted to try out the konjac sponge craze.  Not sure what all the hype is about.  It&#x27;s a very nice sponge, but hasn&#x27;t worked any miracles yet!  My 12 year old son enjoys poking it.  It is certainly fun to use.</li>
    <li> I have super sensitive skin and this sponge is so effective and gentle! No more dry, peely patches..and no pimply rashes from harsher exfoliants. I use it daily and I love it.</li>
    <li> I use this, in addition to my other My Konjac Sponges, for periodic breakouts.  It works, it really works!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always had problems with black heads and whiite heads. I may not have issues with adult acne because I only get occasional zits here and there - but black and white heads can be just as annoying. I started using the &amp;#34;My Konjac Sponge&amp;#34; because it is made with natural materials and it is said to be great in exfoliating the skin. I am really glad that I tried this product, as it is now part of my nightly ritual. I have been using it religiously for almost a week now and my skin has been looking brighter and clear of black and white heads! This product is well priced - very affordable, in fact. Truly worth purchasing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received one or more of the products mentioned above for review purposes. Regardless, I only recommend products or services I use personally and believe will be good for others. I refuse to review or endorse products that I have not or will not personally try.

    <li> Excellent natural product, Reduced oiliness of skin, cleared up current breakouts and prevented further breakouts.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping and exactly what I wanted.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my son to use for his acne. He says its &#x27;ok&#x27; - typical teenager! But I have noticed some improvement with his skin since he started using this.  So for now I&#x27;ll rate 4 stars but if more improvedment is noted, I&#x27;ll update to 5*.</li>
    <li> This is a good product, it is exactly as advertised.  It&#x27;s soft but still exfoliates well, and I use it to remove my cleanser.  I can&#x27;t tell if the charcoal is doing anything, but I am happy with this product and I would buy it again.  I like this one better than the green clay one, but they&#x27;re about the same.  Good seller, good price and fast shipping.  Thank you.</li>
    <li> I loved this sponge, it worked great! However it says that you are not supposed to wring it out but hang it up to dry. I did that and the sponge ended up breaking within 2 weeks. Sad.</li>
    <li> Great exfoliator it really gets deep into pores even though it dosent feel like its doing it. Helps my acne gets the dirt and grime out. I only use it at night when I take my shower. Its just great!</li>
    <li> Absolutely love My Konjac Sponge.  Love that it is vegan and easy to use. Does great on exfoliating my sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> After hearing a lot of talk about konjac sponges, I decided to give this one a go. I typically use face scrubs as my sole means of exfoliation, and never use sponges or cloths while cleansing. However, I really did like this product. I&#x27;ve been using it about a month (maybe a little longer) now, and it&#x27;s still intact after daily use. Though it seemed to be preventing breakouts at the beginning, it seems as though that effect wore off a bit as I used it. Perhaps this was due to the charcoal wearing off? I&#x27;m not exactly sure, but as far as the sponge keeping my face smooth, it definitely continues to deliver. It&#x27;s extremely gentle on the face, which has me continuously using it day after day. I&#x27;m definitely interested in getting a larger sized konjac sponge for the entire body next!</li>
    <li> The sponge is less scratchy than exfoliant scrubs. It is gentle on the skin. It is soft when wet and hard when dry.</li>
    <li> This sponge is super soft and I love that I don&#x27;t have to spend so much time doing laundry to wash all of my washcloths daily anymore. And it lasts 2-3 months!</li>
    <li> Fabulous product. My daughter and I both purchased and it&#x27;s amazing. Leaves skin Clean and smooth.</li>
    <li> After my first use, my face felt super smooth. This is a great product.</li>
    <li> Leave my oily, acne prone skin feeling squeaky clean and fresh. I have in fact noticed how the pimples have diminished, will buy more! Thank u</li>
    <li> This is my first review I&#x27;ve ever taken the time to write about a product. A friend recommended I try this type of sponge since I was not a fan of the Clarisonic. I am so happy she did. I&#x27;ve suffered from acne since I turned 20. I&#x27;ve been on every prescription possible, including 3 rounds of Accutane and I still continue to break out :-/ Well, that is until I tried this sponge. I wanted to see if this product really worked so I stopped using it for a week, BIG mistake. This has kept my acne at bay. I still get the occasion blemish; however, no more &amp;#34;block parties&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;big Berthas&amp;#34; are present on my face. I&#x27;ve tried the green clay one and have found this one works best for my skin type. I&#x27;ll never be without this sponge. Guess you could say I&#x27;m a lifelong customer.</li>
    <li> So happy with My Konjac Sponge -- my skin looks and feels great now that I&#x27;m using this. Would highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> best thing I&#x27;ve ever washed my face with</li>
    <li> Fast Shipping, great product!!!!!!</li>
    <li> My teenage son and I both use these, and LOVE them.  I order new ones after about 2 months.  They work beautifully for cleansing and exfoliating, and I really seem to control breakouts.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this sponge!&lt;br /&gt;It starts out hard as a rock, but add warm water, and it completely softens up. It isn&#x27;t harsh at all, just the right amount of exfoliating.&lt;br /&gt;The size is nice too, perfect for face and neck, but big enough for arms and legs.&lt;br /&gt;Very happy with this purchase. I&#x27;ll definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> I just recently found out about this hidden gem! Better than I expected use it daily now with my all natural cleansers and I&#x27;ve seen a big improvement in my skin. I used to rely on my clarisonic type spin exfoliating brush to remove dead skin cells and brighten but this is so gentle and yet works wonders! Love it. Will de be ordering again &amp; again. I&#x27;ve only purchased the charcoal as my skin type is oily/acne prone. Great product</li>
    <li> I was asked to try out this product and write a review. I&#x27;ve been using it for three weeks now &amp; like it overall. I use it in the shower with a cleanser and my face would be softer and smoother. It doesn&#x27;t really prevent acne but leaves the skin feeling soft and smooth. I do wish there were more info about it like when should I throw it away or how to clean it.</li>
    <li> I bought this brand to compare with another. I will not repurchase or recommend this one at all. First it came sealed yet grossly moist inside the package. Second it does not exfoliate even half way as decent in comparison to the other charcoal sponge I bought. I would look at the other brands available on Amazon instead of purchasing this sponge.</li>
    <li> Update: So I&#x27;ve continued using this sponge and I&#x27;m still purging in two areas. I noticed my skin is better in other areas but cystic pimples keep emerging. Other clogged pores seem to clear themselves easily, luckily enough. It&#x27;s been about 1.5 months and I&#x27;m going to see what happens still. I knew I had a lot of underlying skin problems do the fact I&#x27;m still purging doesn&#x27;t surprise me.   Old post: I&#x27;ve been using this sponge for just about two weeks and notice no improvement in my skin. In fact, my skin is oilier than before and a lot of clogged pores have surfaced (which may still be a good thing). I have had about four cystic pimples since starting, too. I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s a reaction and am going to keep using for at least a month. Hopefully things will change but so far a little disappointed.</li>
    <li> Shipped super fast. I love the way it feels. Been using it one to two times a day tops. Came here to buy this based on raving reviews on MUA on reddit and youtube.</li>
    <li> I bought this based on the rave reviews. I was hoping it would exfoliate and help with clogged pores.  It&#x27;s soooo soft I can&#x27;t imagine it&#x27;s doing anything at all. I use the Clarisonic brush and in comparison this is useless.  I let it dry out and then it wen&#x27;t in the unused cosmetics and personal care items basket in the closet. Boo!</li>
    <li> I ordered the sponge and when it arrived i wasn&#x27;t impressed it looked like any old facial sponge from a drug store but when I used it for the first time I noticed the change in my skin, immediately it was softened. I didn&#x27;t see all the excess oil that use to come right back after my face dried. I have been using it for about a week now and I absolutely love it! The only reason I didn&#x27;t rate it at a 5 is the time that it takes for the sponge to dry out and there isn&#x27;t any care instructions for the sponge. How long should i use it before I throw it away? It just needs more instructions. Other than that it&#x27;s Perfect. I will definitely buy from this company again.</li>
    <li> My skin has never looked or felt so good. I wish I&#x27;d known about this years ago. Highly recommended this to all of my friends and family!</li>
    <li> I heard about the konjac sponge on an acne blog and decided to try it out. My skin is sensitive. and so far this hasn&#x27;t aggravated it. However, I&#x27;m also not sure if it&#x27;s cleansing as deeply as I would like. I&#x27;ve had a few minor blemishes since I started using it two weeks ago. I&#x27;m squeezing it dry as suggested and I also microwave it in a bowl of hot water once a week to kill germs. It&#x27;s a good product, but I might try something different when this wears out.</li>
    <li> I see people talk about these all the time over at r/skincareaddiction, now I know why.. This thing is awesome</li>
    <li> I used to use the Boscia konjac sponge, but at 16.00, I wanted a cheaper alternative.  This is amazing, and about twice the size.  I find myself reaching for my sponge before my Clarisonic or my Foreo Luna.  I wish I&#x27;d found this before I sunk 300+ into the other brushes, but alas.  Now I know!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This gently exfoliates and I think the charcoal really does give a little extra anti-acne oomph to my cleanser.</li>
    <li> This is a great way to exfoliate if you have sensitive skin. I am in love with this sponge :)</li>
    <li> Game changer if you have acne and sensitive skin. My son loves this sponge. Exfoliates without causing more skin issues. A great product. Will be buying more when he leaves for college in the fall.</li>
    <li> I read about Konjac Sponges and also the antibacterial use of charcoal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love how gentle it exfoliates, my face feels very clean afterwards! Love!</li>
    <li> I have used it every since I purchased it and I noticed that my skin is alot smoother.  Since I bought the one for oily skin the true test for me is in the summer, but otherwise no complaints.</li>
    <li> I have spent lots of money on exfoliating products for the past few years and have always had bad reactions to each one. The reason for that is simple,  I have very sensitive skin so this Konjac Sponge has helped me a lot. Because it is natural, I do not have to use a soap and risk damaging my skin. I find this to be more gentle on my skin than a luffa pad. With this sponge, get smoother, a lot less redness and no skin breakage. I recommend this sponge to anyone who has sensitive skin!</li>
    <li> I pair this delightful Konjac with a daily face wash of choice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far so good. The magical properties of this uber organic sponge appears to be on-fleek.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t really enjoy using this after the first time, which I&#x27;ll admit was a novelty! It&#x27;s hard to describe the texture.. like mildly abrasive gummy bears with holes? I didn&#x27;t feel like it did anything special in the way of exfoliation, though I tend to prefer alphahydroxy acid exfoliators more anyhow.</li>
    <li> So far I love this little sponge. I do wish there had been some type of directions as to whether you should be using it with your cleanser or not (maybe I missed them on the package?).</li>
    <li> overall disappointing.  small sponge, expecting something more along the lines of a luffa or natural sponge; i.e. more texture for exfoliation purposes.  for $10 i believe a better sponge can be obtained elsewhere.  O well, sometimes you win, and sometimes you lose; but you can&#x27;t find those excellent products without taking chances.</li>
    <li> To be perfectly honest I wasn&#x27;t really expecting the texture of the sponge to change so much once I wet it. I kind of wanted it to stay a little bit hard so that I can scrub my face. I still like it though I just had to work a little bit harder it did a great job pulling all the extra gunk out of my pores. It&#x27;s a little bit stiffer it would be a perfect sponge.</li>
    <li> This was my first Konjac Sponge- I chose the bamboo charcoal one first because I have a tendency to break out, and reading the (rave) reviews, I was really hoping that it would work as well as everyone was saying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received the sponge about a week ago. It feels stiff and almost like an even lighter-weight pumice stone, but when you wet it, it turns sponge-like and a bit slick, but not unpleasantly; it&#x27;s got some natural clay cleanser-type stuff incorporated, so it gets slightly sudsy when wet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using it morning and evening, pretty much on its own- sometimes with some soap if it&#x27;s at the end of the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use a Clarisonic, but hearing the reviews that said that it essentially had the same effect, I decided to  forego the Clarisonic for the week and only use the Konjac to see what would happen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin hasn&#x27;t broken out, and my faces feels calm and clear.  The Konjac sponge leaves my face feeling really clean, and fresh, and just on the verge of squeaky clean, but not stripped. I feel I would only have to use the clarisonic once or twice a week now, and I really love the feel of the Konjac.  Will repurchase, and I want to try the other ones, as well.  Great product, recommend</li>
    <li> Great sponge that effectively reduces excess oil on skin! Company sent it on time and item was neatly packed! Helped my teen with acne within the first few days ! Thank you</li>
    <li> At first, I had a very high expectation about this product and looked forward to using it. However, when the real package came from Amazon, I found that the sponge&#x27;s package is smaller than I expected (see size details below):&lt;br /&gt;- When it&#x27;s wet, the sponge dimension is 4.25\\&quot; L x 3.3 W x .6\\&quot; H.&lt;br /&gt;- When it&#x27;s completely dry, the sponge dimension is  3.25\\&quot; L x 2.5\\&quot; W x .4\\&quot; H.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The sponge comes slightly wet, sealed inside the plastic packaging. I feel that the texture of the sponge is not very effective in removing my blackheads because the surface is a bit smooth. Although my skin is slightly smoother after using it, I had to press/massage/scrub the sponge hard on my skin to get it slightly exfoliate my skin. I&#x27;ve tried other brands of konjac sponges that give better exfoliation, so I think this product is okay..</li>
    <li> Weird at first, it felt very soft and jelly like on my face but it&#x27;s actually great at cleaning without scraping my skin no matter how hard I scrub.</li>
    <li> This works so well on cleaning my face.  I have very oily skin, and this really helps keep the oil away.</li>
    <li> I was really excited when I ordered this! I read so many great reviews and was sure it was for me! I do a lot of charcoal face masks that do wonders so I was sure this charcoal sponge would do me well...&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, it did not. Upon first use I totally broke out (which is not normal for my skin) I may have one small blemish once every month or two that goes away in just a few days but after my first use of the sponge i had three areas of break outs! I&#x27;ve been too scared to use it since....</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this sponge for about three weeks now and it still amazes me how such a gentle sponge can do a better job exfoliating my sensitive skin than any of the many other methods I&#x27;ve tried in the past. I use this every morning and my makeup always goes on much better because my skin is noticeably more smooth. I&#x27;m being extra gentle with the sponge to prolong its life as much as possible, so I don&#x27;t squeeze out water the way I do with regular sponges. To remove water after use, I press it between a couple layers of a towel, then hang to air dry the rest of the way. The appearance of my skin has significantly improved in just a few short weeks, I never want to be without one of these sponges!</li>
    <li> Wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect since I am a guy. But it&#x27;s super soft and at first I wasn&#x27;t sure if it was doing anything at all. But when I squeeze out after wiping my face with it, the water is dirty/whiteish. I like it a lot. Am definitely going to buy another one when needed. Right now, mine is slowly deteriorating. I use it every day several times(shower, or if its been a hot day just soak it and wipe my face with it). Good product.</li>
    <li> I came across the sponge by luck and the great reviews convinced me to give it a try, I&#x27;m really glad I did. I use it with cleanser in the evening before bed and in the morning I just use it on it&#x27;s own. Even without cleanser, my skin feels cool, clean, and not oily at all. My acne is even starting to clear up after using it for about a week. Plus, I love how it feels. It&#x27;s got such a strange texture.&lt;br /&gt;I like it so much I&#x27;m sending one to my boyfriend to convince him of how great it is.</li>
    <li> I have to say I have been pleasantly surprised how much this little sponge has improved my skin.  I just ordered a second, and I&#x27;m very happy with the results.</li>
    <li> I thought it would take multiple uses to see a difference, but it only took one time to see the smooth and clean result.  Once fully soaked with water, the sponge is super soft and feels wonderful on the face.  It was hard to believe that something this soft could exfoliate, but the result says it all.  Love, love, love!</li>
    <li> This came quickly and I love the sponge for daily use with my normal cleanser routine. Looking forward to seeing how it works in the long term</li>
    <li> Had high hopes for the sponge given the reviews on the website. But after using it for two weeks straight I have seen no noticeable change in my skin. I still have the same number of blackheads and the same kind of dirt, and I still break out. No major change. Pretty disappointing!</li>
    <li> I swear by these sponges. I&#x27;ve struggled with adult acne and have tried so many different products. The konjac sponge is gentle on my sensitive skin and helps keep acne at bay. I&#x27;ve order a few online now and they come fast and are great for the price I&#x27;d definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> After reading about this sponge and the benefits I wanted to try it out. I purchased it about a month ago and use it everyday. I just love how my face feels after using the Konjac sponge. My face feels so clean and very soft. I have also noticed that my pores have gotten smaller since using the sponge.</li>
    <li> After reading all the rave reviews I was extremely excited to try this product out as my face has recently started breaking out from the Summer heat.  I tried it for the first time and actually felt that my face felt the exact same.  A lot of other reviews stated that their face felt soft instantly, but I also think that you do get those same results when after you wash your face.  So I didn&#x27;t see the hype there.  I would also like to point out that again this is just a sponge and after using it for 1.5 weeks I haven&#x27;t seen any sort of improvement in my skin.</li>
    <li> I love the Konjac Sponge so much! A typical sponge feels dry when squeezed, but the Konjac sponge does not. It&#x27;s amazing how much moisture it can retain. At the same time, though, I am always able to wring out enough water so that it&#x27;s not dripping all over me when I exfoliate my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I feel like I&#x27;ve hit the jackpot on face exfoliation products. Wash cloths make my skin very red and irritate my moderate acne, as do microdermabrasion brushes (which also feel so harsh on my skin). In contrast, the Konjac Sponge causes minimal redness and irritation, and it&#x27;s FUN to use! I feel like I am rubbing my face with a cloud!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t had it very long, so I haven&#x27;t given it a deep clean yet. I make sure it&#x27;s completely rinsed and put in a &#x27;safe&#x27; place every time I use it. I have seen plenty of video reviews online that say you can give it a gentle, deep, natural clean by sticking it in a jar with some warm water and witch hazel. I&#x27;m sure this will help pull out some of the impurities still leftover after wringing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also love that this sponge is made from a plant. As an earthy type of person, it&#x27;s so great to finally find something that isn&#x27;t synthetic or single-use but still works really well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will surely recommend this product to everyone I know. It&#x27;s awesome! Give it a try, especially if you are struggling with acne. I have moderate/severe cystic acne and an itchy rash all over my face, and this sponge has really helped me. I feel that it&#x27;s helping to control my flakiness AND oiliness at the same time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Need I say more? Awesome product. Try it!</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t really sure which sponge to order because I don&#x27;t have acne. But I got this one anyway because I don&#x27;t think it makes a difference. It&#x27;s very easy to use, more so than a washcloth. Not so rough as to be abrasive, but I just feel a little brighter after washing my face!</li>
    <li> I ordered this sponge because it had great reviews supporting what the label says this sponge does for your skin and face. I was excited to receive it so I try it right away. I have oily skin and break out a little bit around my neck and chin sometimes. I use the best quality make up, brushes and sponges but I still break out a little. I saw this as an affordable solution for my problem as it claims to benefits acne prone oily skin. I like how the sponge feels when wet in my hand but no in my face. It feels really plasticky and I don&#x27;t feel exfoliated. I&#x27;ve used it without cleansing soap and my face just feels sort of greasy smooth but not clean. So I have tried it after washing my face first with my Shea Moisture Black African Soap bar but same feeling. I feel clean because of the soap but the sponge just sort off makes my face feel claycky smooth. Honestly, I have not seen any acne improvement on my face. At this point, I am confused what this sponge does? It doesn&#x27;t cleanse me nor clears my blemishes. So I do find it expensive and useless.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t tried anything like this before.  I expected it to feel a bit like pumice, but it feels soft and a tiny bit slimy (in a good way, if that&#x27;s possible).  I have only used it three times so I haven&#x27;t noticed anything yet.  My skin is quite smooth.  I have the Clarisonic brush doohicky and I just don&#x27;t use it because it&#x27;s more work than I like to do on a daily basis.  I like the sponge better so far.</li>
    <li> I liked it a lot at first, but after three or four uses it started smelling like mold and not working.</li>
    <li> I really love the feel of this sponge. It&#x27;s very different than a standard sponge or even other beauty sponges. I use it with a facial cleanser and when I rinse it with water and rub the cleanser off with the sponge again, it pretty much removes all the cleanser. I know because when I rinse my face one last time directly with water it feels like I don&#x27;t have any product on my face and my face feels squeaky clean. I&#x27;ve found after using this for about 2-3 weeks that my face breaks out less and is clearing up. I have moderate adult acne. I love this sponge!! It feels spa-like too, very soothing!</li>
    <li> By the afternoon my face is an oil slick. But I have noticed that since using this sponge that my face is a lot less oily and my face feels smoother. I definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Leaves my face feeling refreshed and clean...love it!</li>
    <li> Took care of this exactly how the instructions stated. It disintegrated within 1 week.  Bought a konjac sponge twice this size for $4 less at a local store. This sponge is junk.  Will never buy this brand of konjac sponge again.</li>
    <li> Leaves my skin clean and soft. Works as well for me as the Clarisonic spinning brush. I use an eye makeup remover, Mario Badescu Enzyme Cleansing Gel, and this sponge. I follow up with a moisturizer. I have combination to dry skin with small pores, barely any fine lines, and I do not have a problem with acne, eczema, or rosacea. I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I absolutely LOVE this Konjac Sponge! I personally have very sensitive skin and normal exfoliants and washcloths irritate my face, but this sponge really does a great job of exfoliating all my dead skin off and making my face feel smooth! I also noticed the first time I  used it that I cleared all the little blackheads that I had on my nose! Ever since then I Have been hooked! I have also tried the French Green Clay Konjac Sponge but this is my favorite by far!</li>
    <li> When I received the sponge it was very hard.  I anticipated that it would scratch my face.  However, the instructions said to wet the sponge.  Soon as I wet the sponge it expanded, became very soft and rubbery textured.  I loved it.  It reminds me of one of those cosmetic pads that are made out of rubber.  But, there were some slight differences.  The sponge can be used throughout the day to remove oil but it also works well with your favorite facial cleanser.</li>
    <li> I tried a konjac sponge from a Sephora store and really liked how it toned my skin and my skin feels very soft after using it.&lt;br /&gt; When it came time to purchase another one i decided to look on Amazon to see if i could find a cheaper one. And i came across this brand and decided to give it a shot because it was $8 cheaper, which is great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And i honestly didn&#x27;t notice any difference apart from the size which the My Konjac Sponge is bigger and thinner so it actually dries faster than the one I purchased from Sephora.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall very satisfied and will buy it again! :)</li>
    <li> very interesting texture.... and I don&#x27;t use soap...it&#x27;s not abrasive..... i hope it&#x27;s cleaning my face pores..... still too early to tell.. only 3 days.. but, I like it</li>
    <li> I am ordering more in the near future and I feel the product is very good and does what it advertises</li>
    <li> This sponge was recommended to me by a spa tech, and I love it. It&#x27;s very gentle but effective. It also reminds me of the Millennium Falcon, which can only be a plus.</li>
    <li> love this item  unique and prized</li>
    <li> I am not sure what the benefit of this thing is.  It feels squishy and slimy when wet, which is how you&#x27;re supposed to use it, and I don&#x27;t get the sense that it is exfoliating at all.  I don&#x27;t feel like it is giving a deeper clean than with any other basic scrubber.</li>
    <li> I like the way the sponge feels on my face. Very soothing but I have not seen any improvement in my acne during the week I&#x27;ve been using it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m really enjoying my sponge.</li>
    <li> I bought this one for our son. He has told us he loves his konjac sponge.</li>
    <li> I love these sponges. Skin so soft!</li>
    <li> My skin seems noticeably clearer after a few weeks. Easy and convenient to use.</li>
    <li> effective at cleansing yet gentle enough for my sensitive skin</li>
    <li> ( I was given this product for free and this is my own honest opinion )&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My face has never felt smoother.  I have the MY Konjac Sponge Bamboo Charcoal Facial Sponge to thank for that.  I&#x27;ve been using the MY Konjac Sponge for a couple of days now and it has really impressed me.  The way you use the sponge is the key to making sure your face gets as clean as possible.  Make sure to you clean your face using the sponge in circular motions.  This allows the sponge to wipe away all the dirt on your face and not miss a spot.  If you are worried about the sponge hurting your face, don&#x27;t be.  The sponge doesn&#x27;t hurt one bit and is softer than soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I definitely recommend this sponge if you are having problems keeping your face clear and awesome looking!</li>
    <li> This is a great product, the konjac sponge provides gentle exfoliation and is easy to care for. I originally bought the charcoal sponge because I have combination skin and have been battling breakouts in my t-zone. After a few weeks of use it was obvious that my face really isn&#x27;t oily enough to handle both exfoliation and charcoal powder in one go. I ordered the plain konjac sponge and tossed this one.</li>
    <li> So far I like the white and green ones better. This one is kind of flat and slimy for some reason and doesn&#x27;t seem to be as miraculous as the others have been.</li>
    <li> Really loved this product. Does what it says at a great price. What more can you ask for? Nothing. That&#x27;s what.</li>
    <li> Enjoyed using My Konjac Sponge! It is quick, convenient and made my face feel clean and refreshed each time I used it!!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s great fun to wash your face with- still waiting to see the positive effects... It has a great texture, though does seem to stay quite damp even after &amp;#34;drying.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Excited for more washes!</li>
    <li> My face feels so soft after using this just two times!  I just added it to my regular routine and I love it.</li>
    <li> I use this with my Lush Coalface soap for extra exfoliating.  Not for daily use, more like once a week, since the soap already has its own exfoliating texture.  But I love how it makes my skin feel extra smooth!  Just make sure to take it out of the shower area and allow it to air dry.  It is a sponge, after all... and who wants to have a science experiment growing in their damp shower!  Only docked it a star because the string that comes with it is super chintzy.  For $10, would expect something a bit more sturdy.</li>
    <li> I love it.  It does have a weird texture when wet, but don&#x27;t let that hold you back.  Very gentle exfoliation - no irritation or redness after using.  You can use it with your own facial wash or with out.  I&#x27;m planning on buying a few more as backups.  Good price on Amazon site, one is selling on a popular beauty website for almost double their price.</li>
    <li> I purchased the sponge about a week ago and it works great. I really like it. It is free from added chemicals or added fragrances and that makes it really gentle on the skin. I love that it&#x27;s all natural. It makes my skin feel very soft. I can already see a difference in my pore size. I purchased the sponge to help with blackheads and they have already been reduced also. I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Upon arrival, the sponge is dry &amp; firm.  Once wet it becomes soft &amp; feels great on your face.  It rinses well so no left over cleanser the next time you use it.  Will order again, and plan to look into other products offered by this company.</li>
    <li> Broke apart after two weeks of admittedly vigorous use. I did not deviate from the instructions provided so perhaps it was just a faulty order. That said, buyer beware.</li>
    <li> Great sponge for gently exfoliating your face while washing</li>
    <li> am using it for a short period of time but so far I like the product but need to use it a lot longer to give a realistic review</li>
    <li> Works great on my sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> Great product. Even without using soap. My skin feel perfectly balanced.</li>
    <li> Awesome sponge!  Love it and use it every day.</li>
    <li> Awesome little sponge that I use everyday!  Great quality!</li>
    <li> So far, so good! I have not had any breakouts and it seems to be leaving my skin clean!</li>
    <li> Great product, lasted me a little more than 3 months with the right care. Did not fall apart at all! It did not break me out, I used it a few times a week and the surface of my skin was really smooth and stayed that way.</li>
    <li> Love the sponge. It is just the right size and has the tapered end so it goes nicely around the nose. I have sensitive skin and so far I have had no problems with it irritating my skin like a lot of exfoliators do.</li>
    <li> Love love this sponge! My face is glowing!</li>
    <li> Faces looks and feels cleaner after I use. I use in the morning when there is no makeup on my face.</li>
    <li> I was watching a news segment and they raved about this sponge. All this time i&#x27;ve been using a loofah sponge and eeh.. never really saw a difference so I decided to give this a shot.. I was totally surprised how refreshed my skin started looking..</li>
    <li> This sponge is so cool. I have been using this for 2 weeks now and have noticed a bid change in how my complexion looks. Sometimes I use this with cleanser and other times just by itself. It really feels like a deeper clean but without the harshness of the rotating brushes, etc. I am a fan and will certainly keep this as part of my regular skin care routine.</li>
    <li> Use my Konjac sponge nightly on face &amp; love it!</li>
    <li> Love the Konjac Sponge!!  It has replaced my usual cleansers.  I saw results right away after using it for a couple of days.  It really does reduce blackheads and has made my face look smoother and clearer.  I will definitely re-order and keep using the sponge daily.</li>
    <li> Excellent quality ... I had purchased a &amp;#34; name&amp;#34; brand for twice the money and it fell apart in less than a week and this sponge shows no signs of wearing out !</li>
    <li> It is a great sponge but it ripped after a week of use without hard scrubbing.  Maybe I just got a bad one.</li>
    <li> This is maybe the 5th time for me to re-purchase this sponge and I have been using it for almost 3 month now. It&#x27;s a jelly like sponge so it feels so smooth and gentle on my face. The most effective way for me to use it is after rinse off my face wash I use this sponge gently massage on my face with circular motion. I also tried to add face wash in it but since I have sensitive skin my skin kinda hurts a little after wash. It won&#x27;t clear out all the black&amp;white heads but It can remove most of the dead skin cells and gives you a fresh, clean skin to start with. A little expensive for a konjac sponge but this one is very good quality and will last for a long time. If you are looking for a gentle everyday expoliator this one is the best choice.</li>
    <li> As a CNA who works at night I don&#x27;t have much time or energy for a face saving regime. My combination complexion isn&#x27;t what you&#x27;d call flawless, so I couldn&#x27;t afford not to clean my face regularly. This sponge is easy to use and since I began using it about 1  month ago my skin has become clearer and I can hardly believe the new convenience of my new face regime.</li>
    <li> I gave these to myself and 3 others.  We all love the way our skin feels so soft and is really cleaning up nicely.  Thank you for this product.  You can be sure we all will order again in the future.  Great gift and very loved by all.</li>
    <li> I really like it! It makes my skin soft. Will be getting more!</li>
    <li> I wont use cleanser with sponge. Unneeded.  However after one use, this one seems &amp;#34;used up&amp;#34; and light colored. I will try different makers of this kind of sponge for better quality. I think charcoal is the way to go for cleansing.</li>
    <li> Works magic on my Face. Highly worth using day to day.</li>
    <li> I love this product , I have very sensitive skin and have to be careful when using facial products but this Konjac sponge is so gentle that I can use it everyday. My face feels super soft and I have noticed fewer breakouts, it is definitely a must have for anyone that wants clear skin.</li>
    <li> It really helped my skin by decreasing the amount of pimples I normally get and is a good exfoliator. I also love it because it also aids with efficiently removing makeup when used with my normal makeup removing foam. I used to break out because of residue left over from makeup and even sunscreen, but ever since I started using this sponge, I haven&#x27;t broken out once! I also have extremely sensitive, acne-prone, and combination skin (it&#x27;s as bad as it can get), and the konjac sponge is gentle and hasn&#x27;t irritated my skin at all. It doesn&#x27;t get fully get rid of my blackheads, but nothing actually does (not even medicinal cream), so I wouldn&#x27;t claim that it doesn&#x27;t get rid of blackheads. I also wouldn&#x27;t claim that it gets rid of existing acne or will completely heal it, but it does prevent new pimples from forming as often, which, in the long run, has resulted in improved skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the quality and state of the sponge, it&#x27;s been over a month and the sponge is still holding up like new! Cheap and durable, exactly what I needed!</li>
    <li> I use an RX retinol which can make my skin dry/flakey. Sometimes my Clarisonic is too aggressive for how delicate the RX can make my skin. I find the use of these konjac sponges to be a great alternative. It&#x27;s very very gentle but effective at exfoliating the dry flakey skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They are soft enough to use daily, can be used on their own, or with your favorite facial wash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I find that if you hang dry them outside of the shower they dry quickly, which I feel extends the life of them a bit (plus doesnt contribute to possible bacteria build up from being wet)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you replace them once every 3 mos then it can be expensive for just a sponge; but if you use it every day it&#x27;s worth while.&lt;br /&gt;If you don&#x27;t use it every day and only use it every so often then you could get more mileage out of it.</li>
    <li> Made a positive difference to my daily skin care regimen! Order this product monthly</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure what this thing really supposed to do.  There is absolutely no exfoliation.  Actually I think it made me break out.</li>
    <li> Great sponge. Face feels very clean after use.</li>
    <li> Good quality. Thanks.</li>
    <li> Quick delivery, product was just as indicated. Thanks!</li>
    <li> First I would like to say, I make a lot of my own clay face masks and beauty products so, I know quality ingredients! Activated Charcoal is one of nature&#x27;s miraculous wonders! Activated charcoal pulls out toxins. What are pimples? Infections what do infections have? Toxins! When first using this product to treat a toxic warfare on your face you can expect to see some unsettling disturbances. This is all because your toxins are being drawn out. After frequent use your skin will begin to neutralize and heal. When it comes to anything related to beauty patience is a virtue keep this in mind before giving up and tossing in the towel. My product was not moist and was a lovely gentle experience!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this for free to review. Regardless, my reviews are always unbiased and reflect my true opinions.</li>
    <li> good exfoliant. I have a lot of acne so it&#x27;s not a miracle worker but I&#x27;m on medications that are very drying and I no longer get the flaky looking dry skin. yum.</li>
    <li> I found this product in the magazine, actually it was another kind but from same family of sponges. Konjac has a lot of different sponges that are suited for different types of skin. I usually use clay on my face once a week and after reading a review i decided that this sponge should be good for washing my face. You see my chin area is so itchy, i think it is from the make up i use, but if i use the clay the itch stops for 3 days max and the clay can be used only once a week so i had a delema.. so i decided to purchase  Konjac Sponge All Natural Fiber Bamboo Charcoal Facial Sponge and give it a try to see if that will help...The sponge it self is so gentle and can be used with any of your favorite face washes or alone without anything.. it exfoliates your skin gently and made my itch to go away.. it evens out your skin tone and makes you look radiant and the most important it doesn&#x27;t dry your skin...which is a big one for me..So i would recommend this type of sponge for anyone who has little pimples or uneven skin tone or dry skin. It help with all of those mentioned things and will give your skin a healthy look. I&#x27;ve been using it for 2 weeks now and i love it.</li>
    <li> The sponge has helped clear out clogged pores, but is not a cure all for breakouts.  I add a bit of soap when washing my face at night since I didnt feel like the sponge alone was enough for removing dirt,  oil, &amp; make up.  I just ordered the green tea konjac and would order this one again as well.</li>
    <li> Wonderful product. Had to purchase for family when I realized my complexion had improved ten fold. I recommend to anyone who has oily/combination skin.</li>
    <li> I really like this sponge - it lathers up easily, helps rinse your face off and leaves your skin very soft.  It works great with all types of cleansers, bars and liquids alike.  Glad I bought it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m going to start this off by saying this isn&#x27;t a cure for acne, but it definitely helped me. From time to time, maybe once every two months, I get some sort of nodules or cysts that would be a big pain to deal with. They would last for a week or two and the post-inflammatory red scar left over would last for months. This sponge was a lifesaver because in the couple of months that I&#x27;ve used it, I haven&#x27;t gotten a big cyst like that at all. Granted, I do have breakouts still because I&#x27;m trying to use more natural methods of dealing with my skin, but these breakouts are much milder than before. If you&#x27;re looking for a good tool for exfoliation that can help acne, this is the one. But know that skin is much more than just exfoliating and putting on cremes. Your skin needs to be restored from the damaged state that chemicals and harsh cleansers have caused. This sponge is a natural tool to help you do that.</li>
    <li> Got one for my wife so she could try it out. This is her second one because she absolutely loves it. There&#x27;s no doubt I&#x27;ll be purchasing another one.</li>
    <li> ....and I&#x27;m so glad!  It really does work as a mild scrub.  Just add water!  It&#x27;s amazingly smooth and the contours are perfect (it&#x27;s a fat tear drop shape).  I got an email from the CEO saying she hoped I liked the product.  Now THAT is customer service!  I recommend this little sponge (it&#x27;s the color of charcoal, which threw me because it&#x27;s BAMBOO Charcoal) because it delivers what it promises.  The price was $10 and I think it&#x27;s worth it.  It seems to be showing no wear, so I&#x27;m curious as to how long this will last.  No information was contained on the packaging to indicate the life of the product.  The packaging is so nice, friendly to the environment with no over the top container.</li>
    <li> Love this sponge for my face! I really do think it helped a little bit with my acne. I have bought 2 of them already. It lasts a while but my dog ate the first one....</li>
    <li> I ordered this facial sponge to use in conjunction with another face wash product. While I was not disappointed with this product, it did not &amp;#34;wow&amp;#34; me to the point where I would purchase it again. It came very quickly, however, and does its job - it cleans my face and feels very gentle on the skin.</li>
    <li> This sponge fell apart after 1 week of using it.  I&#x27;d like to say that I liked the sponge, but I didn&#x27;t get to use it enough time to really know for sure how I felt about it, as it literally crumbled to bits maybe the 4th or 5th time I used it.  Waste of my money.</li>
    <li> This sponge is my secret weapon. I&#x27;ve been using it daily for about a year now and my skin is noticeably smoother and blackhead-free. Such a small thing, but a gentle buffing in the shower on a regular basis makes for a brighter face.</li>
    <li> Not sure how I REALLY feel about this. Day 1, I was so excited to try it. I was expecting a rougher feel on my skin. It doesn&#x27;t &#x27;feel&#x27; as though it is exfoliating my skin. However, my skin does feel super smooth after each use. I&#x27;ve used it in conjunction with my current facial wash, so I am not sure if it actually cleans the skin, by itself. Without the facial wash product, it just feels weird on my face without lather. It falls out my hand easily, so I often have to handle it by the string.I prefer the round end, as opposed to pointed end. The material (when wet) resembles fake plastic to me. I hope it will increase after longer use. For now, I wet it partially before scrubbing my face, so that some of the hardness is retained in the sponge, it just gets way too soft for my liking. Especially when hot water is used. I enjoy using it thus far though. I will do a more thorough review once I have used it longer than a month. I will also test it solo without facial wash, then use my toner to determine if it actually gets all the dirt and oil off my skin. So for now, my initial review is 3.5 stars.</li>
    <li> Two stars, the product itself was well enough made and decently packaged but my skin responded quite poorly to use of the sponge- break outs and a slight rash. To be fair I have sensitive skin and plenty of people seem to be satisfied...</li>
    <li> This is a great, sturdy sponge. I love using it in the shower. It gently washes my face.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m in love with the Konjac Sponge!&lt;br /&gt; I think it&#x27;s amazing on how much moisture it can retain. I love the way it really cleans my skin. Leaving my skin acne free! Another thing that I like about the Konjac Sponge is that it&#x27;s made from a plant. I&#x27;m all about earth plants that are great for our bodies. It&#x27;s feels great to finally find something that isn&#x27;t synthetic or single-use but still works fantastic!! Do I need to say more? Awesome product. I recommend it! Give it a try!</li>
    <li> the pieces of the sponge are all over your face when you quit using it.  You have to go back and pick up the little black pieces everywhere.  It works as it says it will but I hate the mess it makes.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been searching for a product that will exfoliate my skin and give me a better clean without making me feel like I just got botox. I&#x27;ve tried many scrubs, but they were so harsh that my face became really dry and tight; I couldn&#x27;t even smile or laugh without my face hurting. After reading the review on multiple blogs and on Amazon, I decided to give the Konjac sponge a shot. It sounded like a dream come true. The sponge is effective, soft on the skin and environmentally friendly!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I like the packaging. It&#x27;s simple and to the point. The sponge was really hard when I got it and it felt a bit abrasive, so I was a bit apprehensive about using it. However, once you soak it in water, it turns really soft. I decided to add a cleanser onto the sponge before using it, though it is not necessary. You can use it alone. I gently rubbed the sponge on my face is a circular motion. After rinsing, I felt refreshed and clean without my skin being tight and dry. I&#x27;ve been using the product for two weeks and the results are amazing. My skin is less oily, which means I don&#x27;t need to apply finishing powder as often and I&#x27;m breaking out less. The only complaint I possibly have is that the string is very flimsy, but other than that, it works great! Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> This facial sponge is amazing! After one use my skin felt less oily and my pimples have reduced dramatically! This is now a necessity to my facial skin routine!</li>
    <li> Turned nasty after a week of having it. Didn&#x27;t work at all for my acne. Felt like it made my acne worse.</li>
    <li> I use this sponge to wash my face at night. It&#x27;s gentle, but still does a great job removing my makeup.</li>
    <li> Well seriously what can one say about a sponge?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It absorbs water!!! That&#x27;s a proven fact! In fact it absorbed all the water in the tub! Suddenly I was sitting in a dry tub with an 8 foot sponge in my lap!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has a very long battery life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does exactly what it claims to do, which is remarkable when you consider it&#x27;s just a sponge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is not related to Sponge Bob so you won&#x27;t be able to get an autograph. Believe me I tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But seriously, this sponge does what it&#x27;s supposed to do and that&#x27;s about all you can ask of a sponge. My wife likes it and believes it was worth the price and since she&#x27;s the one using it, that&#x27;s all that matters. Frankly I feel silly writing a review about a sponge, but hey, someone has to. There aren&#x27;t enough sponge reviewers in the world.</li>
    <li> I will update with progress later on, but I have already noticed a huge reduction in the amount of oil my face produce since I started using this sponge. I purchased on a whim and I have been so happy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Normally at the end of the day my face is very shiny and oily. This week I have had &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; skin. It does not feel oily, it removed most of my sebaceous filaments. Even my esthetician noticed a difference in my skin&#x27;s oil production.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The sponge is much larger than I thought it would be. It is a bit bigger than the palm of my hand. I was expecting something more the size of a makeup sponge. It has a little string to hang in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend normal cleansing, rinse of face wash, and then use the Konjac sponge with only water.</li>
    <li> Really wanted to like this.  First few times exfoliated well with my usual gentle cleanser and I was pleased. Skin felt smooth,really clean. After the third or forth day of using this just once per day my skin began having that &amp;#34;recently sanded&amp;#34; look.  My skin was reddened, puffy and sensitive to touch.  Repurposed this item to feet only. This item is advertised safe for sensitive skin and to be non abrasive. In my case that was not true.  Possibly another type of Konjac Sponge would have worked better.</li>
    <li> Soft scrubbing and makes my skin feel great</li>
    <li> This product is really nice for very gentle exfoliation. If you have very sensative skin, this would be perfect. But if you want something more rougher, then I would suggest to find something more exfoliating.</li>
    <li> This product works well and excellent, I was just wondering why when it arrive was it wet (with out me open the package)but other than that is great ..</li>
    <li> Bought this over the hype about them but I was not impressed. I feel I get the same results from a washcloth.</li>
    <li> I love this thing.&lt;br /&gt;I use it after using a cleanser to help exfoliate and I love that it helps make my face feel clean without drying it out and it does seem to keep my skin healthier with regular use.</li>
    <li> Been using this for 3 days in a row. I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s because of peer pressure or for real, I feel like my face and neck had been lighter in color as if a layer of dirt/dead skin had been remove. Otherwise, I like the cool feel of it on my face and will just buy it as a regular face cleaning product. No harm done. It doesn&#x27;t lather soap.</li>
    <li> Easy to use. Saw some complaints in other reviews - cant see why. It has a little string to hang it from so it drys out.</li>
    <li> I love my Konjac sponge!! My face glows after using it. I have tried it two different ways. One without soap and one with soap. I prefer using it with my cleanser. Have bought 3 others for friends!!</li>
    <li> I love this sponge!! Does exactly what I need it to do but is gentle at the same time. Would definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> Eh. Didn&#x27;t work for me - saw no results one way or the other. Also - I was really careful about drying it out (I hung it from a hook so both sides could dry out) as some reviews noted it got mold, and although I never actually saw anything, after the first couple of uses it did have a mildew type smell to it that it did not have the first couple of times I used it.</li>
    <li> love this!! once its wet its surprisingly soft but exfoliates wonderfully.</li>
    <li> I am happy with My Konica Sponge. My skin is acne prone and sensitive. I was having trouble with some dry patches from the cold weather and I&#x27;m happy to say that after one use the dry flaky skin was gone and my skin looked a little brighter. I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s helping my acne yet because I&#x27;ve only been using it for 5 days. Time will tell. Overall I&#x27;m very pleased.</li>
    <li> You&#x27;d be better off with a washcloth. This thing doesn&#x27;t exfoliate at all. I used it for three weeks then it started to make my eyes itchy, dry, flaky, and burn. I would have never know why this had happened if I didn&#x27;t see that it had happened to some other people in the reviews. Waste of money.  I asked for a refund since this product gave me a rash but they refused to even answer my e-mail. I think they pay people to give good reviews.</li>
    <li> Love this sponge. My skin feels baby soft.</li>
    <li> I was impressed at how soft and how slippery this feels on my face. While working and rubbing it in, it generates freshness, more like a good cold feeling in my face, almost like it is freshening you up without trying too hard. I also extend it to my neck, moving in concentric circles, working it on my pores with soft strokes. You don&#x27;t need to press too hard. After drying, I feel that my pores are tighter and all that&#x27;s left is a moisturizer. I actually skipped the toner on this one to experiment - it has the same effect with all the natural and organic ingredients, so I then just applied my usual moisturizer. There was one night that I deliberately skipped my moisturizer to see if this works overnight without it. By next morning, my skin still feels smooth, the nutrient properties worked miracles on my dry skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although I got a sponge that is directed towards oily skin, I can still say that it worked and I didn&#x27;t experience any reaction at all. I don&#x27;t use any cleansing brush like Clarisonic &amp; such so I can&#x27;t compare it with them. But, on the other hand, I can say that this works so much better than my drugstore facial scrub. Using that everyday seems a bit harsh to my skin so I stopped it and opted for this instead. I was a little bit worried about hanging it to dry because then bacteria will grow given the moist nature it has but the company said it could be boiled before use and they suggest getting a new one after every 3 months.</li>
    <li> I have been using Konjac sponges for the past few months and have fallen in love.  I started out with the original My Konjac Sponge (a gift from my mom) while I was going through a flare up of rosacea.  I have been battling rosacea for nearly two years now, and had been on medications for countless months without much improvement.  I was getting tired of popping pills that didn&#x27;t seem to help so I stopped and decided that I was just going to have to live with a red, bumpy face.  On this last flare up, my face actually started burning and peeling - it was an awful feeling.  My mom gave me one of her packages (she keeps a stock of them) and told me to try it.  It&#x27;s amazing how it gently exfoliates without irritating my skin.  All of the peeling skin was washed away and my skin wasn&#x27;t bright red by the time I was done scrubbing - it was a miracle!  I use the sponge in combination with First Aid Cream cleanser - I have used both the original formula and the red clay, and both are fabulous.  The My Konjac Sponge brand in particular has held up wonderfully, and I really appreciate how affordable they are.  I also love the different varieties.  I bought the bamboo charcoal one as a replacement for the original one I got from my mom and love it just as well, if not more!  I have seen such an improvement in my rosacea, and while it&#x27;s not completely gone, I feel that the konjac sponge has really helped keep the flare ups at a minimum and has helped immensely with the bumps on my forehead.</li>
    <li> My pores seem smaller, and my face isn&#x27;t as oily as it used to be. It also took care of two annoying blackheads near my hairline.  I have to order another one soon.</li>
    <li> Lasted 5-6 months (supposed to be replaced every 3 months). The material is so soft I bought the baby Konjac Sponge for my infant.</li>
    <li> I was a little nervous at first when I opened this sponge because it appears really hard and scratchy. I was so wrong. It softens up extremely fast, even faster than the directions stated. I love how easy this thing is to use and how soft it is on my face. I have been using it alone without a cleanser and it feels amazing on my face. My skin is much smoother since I began using this and I will continue to use these sponges from now on. It also as a string attached for hanging to dry which is great. Excellent product.</li>
    <li> Love this sponge! It keeps skin smooth. Great for use on your back and chest after a good workout to avoid breakouts.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know if there is a placebo effect but this was not a helpful product WHAT SO EVER. I used this very sponge for three months straight and there were not results to speak of. Also, to say this sponge exfoliates is just a lie. I had better results using a washcloth. Speaking of which, I&#x27;m using it now and the results are wonderful! I should have saved myself the 10 bucks and just did that. Point is I have much disdain for this product. It was a waste of money and the hype about it is blown out of proportions. The only reason I have this product a two star instead of one was because of the fast shippment. Also because the product was just as it was depicted in the picture.</li>
    <li> LOVE THIS SPONGE!!!! My skin was looking dull. After using this sponge, my skin is smooth, my pores seem minimized and I&#x27;m experiencing less acne than before. Ready to order a fresh sponge for my face and one to use on my body when showering.</li>
    <li> This sponge is so soft once its wet. When you first open the package it&#x27;s a little weird because it&#x27;s hard as a rock but then soak it and it gets very soft and squishy. I use it both with and without cleanser and my face always feels clean afterwards. I also like that it is bigger and thinner than other sponges. Making it thinner makes it much easier to dry out.</li>
    <li> So far I love this sponge, it seems to do what it claims by reducing oil/sebum. I use it in the night and in the morning with my face cleanser and it seems to be working great so far. Love that it is also organic and doesn&#x27;t contain any weird chemicals. Definitely worth trying.</li>
    <li> This sponge is great for GENTLE exfoliation.  My skin feels so soft after using it, without harsh scrubbing damaging my skin.  I don&#x27;t, however, think that this sponge is a miracle product the way that many reviews have made it seem.  It&#x27;s worth the low price and is wonderful at gentle exfoliation, but did NOT clear up any blemishes or reduce wrinkles or any other magical claims.</li>
    <li> I love this little sponge. It&#x27;s easy to use and feels great on your skin. I would recommend this to anyone.</li>
    <li> I was asked to review this product. Actually my 16 year old daughter took this product to review. The sponge is very rough to touch dry but once you wet it, it softens greatly. My daughter and I have a skin condition on our arms called Keratosis pilaris. We have struggled with this skin condition all of our lives, which is hereditary. So we are constantly trying to find a simple solution to this problem. My daughter used this sponge on her face and was quite impressed with the results. Her face was extremely soft and smooth after the first use. I was concerned about the sponge being sanitary after multiple uses because my daughter has extremely sensitive skin. This particular sponge comes with a string attached to conveniently hang to dry. She did not use any cleanser with the sponge; mainly because she is fearful of germs. She cleaned her face prior to using the sponge and then exfoliated with the sponge once her skin was clean. I tried the sponge on my arms following the same manner as my daughter did with her face. I have tried a lot of products for my arms and I was very impressed. I have continued to use this sponge for my arms and they are smoother than they have ever been. This just may be the answer to my prayers. I would suggest using a different sponge for your face; one for body, one for face. So, I will be purchasing a couple of these sponges for my personal use!</li>
    <li> This sponge is the perfect softness mixed with a little exfoliating. I bought this as an alternative to my Clairsonic, because that gets too messy if you&#x27;re not in the shower. The sponge was great for the first 3-4 uses, then it started to smell musty (without any part of my routine/care changing -- I could even smell it on my face). I wring out the sponge after every use, and hang to dry and it still smells like that. I&#x27;ve even tried &amp;#34;washing&amp;#34; it with different soaps to get that smell out and it doesn&#x27;t seem to work. :(</li>
    <li> This has been my second purchase of the Konjac sponge and I love it!  It gets off all my makeup while still being super gentle.  I attribute this sponge with helping to clear up my adult acne.  I&#x27;m hooked for life!</li>
    <li> total waste of money!</li>
    <li> great product makes my skin smooth</li>
    <li> I bought this sponge because I have combination skin, and needed something that would exfoliate any dry skin without drying it out too much. I use this sponge and alternate between cream cleansers (Olay Total Effects 7 Revitalising Foaming Cleanser and Neutrogena Deep Clean Cream Cleanser) and it leaves me with super soft skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The major complaint I have about this sponge is that it began falling apart after about 2 weeks of using it. I leave this sponge hanging in my shower, and it began to disintegrate at the spot that it would lay up against the shower wall (I assume because of too much moisture accumulation). I let it air dry and am especially careful to not let it touch anything while doing so, and that seems to have helped the problem, but still frustrating that I&#x27;m left with a hole/indent on one side of this sponge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I recommend giving the Konjac sponge a try if you are looking for an exfoliating clean for combination skin, but be wary of the shelf life and don&#x27;t be surprised if it doesn&#x27;t stay looking brand new for long.</li>
    <li> fantastic &amp; different from all the rest of facial sponges</li>
    <li> interesting product, I love it!</li>
    <li> I like this sponge and I would buy it again. I can&#x27;t say it worked wonders for my skin though. It didn&#x27;t look any worse or any better than it usually does. I like the texture of it and it feels good on the skin. I used it without any cleanser for the first three weeks but now I feel like it&#x27;s lost it&#x27;s &amp;#34;oomph&amp;#34; so I use a little cleanser with it now. But I think I will try another brand of konjac sponge to compare the two. Overall, a good facial sponge.</li>
    <li> A lovely, soft sponge that does the trick for removing makeup in the shower - leaves skin feeling very nice.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been struggling with adult acne for quite some time. I began to use Proactiv+, which has been working well- but not entirely. Once I incorporated this into my morning routine (with a gentle tea tree based cleanser from another company) I quickly saw noticeable results. I now only use proactive in the evenings only, and I&#x27;m cutting back on it more &amp; more each day (due to ingredients I&#x27;d rather not use on my skin). The konjac sponge is a wonderful natural alternative and has worked best for me so far in my fight against acne! My skin has never been so smooth- definitely worth a try!</li>
    <li> Made my face feel great. Good by itself to massage face. Only requires a very small amount of a cleaner to get face squeaky clean. Very gentle on my skin and left my face feeling great.</li>
    <li> Having dealt with skin problems most of my life, I was hoping this could be an inexpensive way to help my skin. Unfortunately, it made it worse. I started breaking out the day after I started using it. I stopped using it for about a week to wait for my skin to clear up. Once it did, I started using the sponge again to see what would happen. Once again, I broke out after using the sponge. I&#x27;m not saying that this won&#x27;t work for anyone; it just didn&#x27;t work for me. I&#x27;m sure it works for some people, but I don&#x27;t really believe the reviews on here about miraculous results the day after using it.</li>
    <li> Seriously I use this over my clarisonic every single day. My face feels so clean and almost as if it is breathing after I use these. They are great.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this! So much I just suggested it in a natural group I am in, and in my business group. I tried this to review it and oh man! My husband has dry skin, and I have two kiddos at home. We are definately getting the body sponges! Awesome item! Thanks again!!!</li>
    <li> This sponge has been a skin saver for me! I like that it is all natural. Does an amazing job of getting rid of dead skin and leaving soft luminous skin! I&#x27;ve used sponges like this before, I have to say this one has to be the BEST HANG DOWN! When you first open your package, the sponge will be hard...no worries. Soak it in your sink (I do this while removing makeup) Add a little of your favorite cleanser and move in circular motions This will leave fresh soft new skin! Follow with you favorite moisturizer :)</li>
    <li> I really love these sponges. It left my face feeling very soft and exfoliates very gently.&lt;br /&gt;The best skincare product I have so far!</li>
    <li> Very soft and gentle on my face.</li>
    <li> I highly recommend this product for everyone.  Easy to use and easy to store.</li>
    <li> Very good cleaning tool even for people with acne.</li>
    <li> I have really small pores that clog easily and are impossible to unclog without tearing my face apart like an animal. I have only had the sponge for about 12 days and I already notice a difference in the quality of my skin. It&#x27;s softer, and zit-free areas look flawless. The areas ridden with zits are clearing up and there are definitely no new ones surfacing. The sponge also makes my face feel more clean than the best face wash does because the charcoal is absorbing so many particles that were probably left to rot in my pores previously. My only confusion is whether I&#x27;m supposed to use face wash with the sponge? I didn&#x27;t want it to degrade the sponge, so I wash my make up off with face wash first, then use the sponge with tepid water to further clean my pores. Does anyone know what the company recommends?</li>
    <li> Love this product it helps to minimize my oiliness and control my inflammation.</li>
    <li> Ripped apart after using for 5 days. Don&#x27;t bother.</li>
    <li> Definitely worth a try</li>
    <li> This sponge is amazing !!!!  I have had this bad boy for a little over a week and i am loving the results so far!!!  I was a little skeptical when i received it because it comes as hard as a rock and it looks like a pumice stone, which scared the tar out of me, because there was no way i was going to rub a pumice stone on my face.  Though after further inspection i saw that you had to wet to soften it so fear not, it does not stay like this, it softens up great when water is added!  There are a few things i would like to add that are not clear at all on the packaging 1) this can be used with soap or by itself, it doesn&#x27;t damage the sponge to use it with soap.  I myself use it with soap and have loved the results. 2) after every 2 weeks of use they recommend that you sterilize and sanitize your sponge by placing it in a microwave safe bowl full of water and putting it in for 1:30 minute at your microwaves regular temperature. I just wanted to note these 2 things because i had to go searching for these answers because i didn&#x27;t want to ruin my new awesome Konjac sponge by not using it correctly.  With that said my skin has become more and more awesome and my blackheads on my nose are disappearing and this is all within a week!!! I can&#x27;t wait to see what results i get after a month.  Overall this is an awesome product for the price i can&#x27;t wait to order some of the other Konjac sponges to try out !!!  I did receive this product for free for review purposes, but all opinions are my own.</li>
    <li> not sure if this works</li>
    <li> I love this product. Its really helped my skin become better and clearer and clear #konjacsponge</li>
    <li> Omg I love this thing. I&#x27;ve been using a clarisonic for years, but when I began using Retin-A about a year ago it was way too harsh on my skin. The Retin-A made my skin super flaky though, so I was constantly stuck. I could either give my skin a break and let it flake off everywhere and look disgusting, or I could scrub it. It would be red and kind of painful, but at least it would be smooth. See what I mean? Rock and hard place. No good options.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enter the konjac sponge. This is still physical exfoliation, but it&#x27;s so incredibly gentle that even I can use it twice daily with no ill effects. It scrubs off all the flakies, but feels like angels are kissing my cheeks. When I rinse, my face is smooth and glowing instead of bright red and shining. This is how skin is supposed to look and feel. I have nothing bad to say about this.</li>
    <li> Excellent product. I love it. Perfect.</li>
    <li> Great sponge! Very gentle but efficiently exfoliates the face. This is ideal for those of us with sensitive skin that gets easily irritated with other sponges. It&#x27;s also a good sub for using a Clarisonic or something of the sort. You don&#x27;t need to spend $99+...you just need $10! You end up using less cleansing product with the sponge as it froths. It also helps me remove the last of my makeup (i.e. foundation, mascara, etc.). Will be purchasing another one once this one is used up! **One thing, however, it never dries completely in a day but other than that, great product.</li>
    <li> I saw a charcoal sponge in fitness magazine, but after reviews of that particular brand I decided to go with Konjac.  I feel like it really deep cleans the face softly (if that makes sense).  My skin feels clean and smooth after using.  I use it with gentle cleanser.  Will definitely keep buying this product!</li>
    <li> I used this to clean my face twice a day while in the shower- didn&#x27;t use any soap, yet my face felt clean and soft after each wash. It is an interesting texture, and it may seem kind of slimy to some folks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price still feels a little high, though, and I have not purchased a next one yet.</li>
    <li> I used to use my Clarisonic daily, but am no addicted to this!  It makes your skin feel soft and smooth and has greatly reduced shine on my t-zone.  Like other reviewers, I microwave one a week to get rid of the germs.  I wash my face with facewash at night and now only water in the am.  LOVE.</li>
    <li> I saw this product promoted by MamaNatural on Facebook and I&#x27;m so glad I gave it a try!  My skin feels so much cleaner using this than any other store bought face wash or homemade scrub. I love it and already told my friends to check this out as well. I even got an extra one for my husband to use when he goes away for drill weekends and training a weeks!</li>
    <li> It makes my skin feel great, and it&#x27;s perfect for washing my face. I microwave it once a week to kill any microorganisms. It can be used with cleanser or water.</li>
    <li> Great exfoliation! My skin feels wonderful after using this. My hormonal acne has cleared up a little bit since using this - I&#x27;m hopeful that it will continue to improve after I use the Konjac sponge more.</li>
    <li> Love this sponge! My face feels so good after and it just takes a small drop of my liquid facial cleanser to get a great lather on my face. Sponge fits great in my smallish hands and it is easy to hang to dry on our shower caddy! I have noticed my face is clearing up a little and my face isn&#x27;t as oily as usual - not sure if that&#x27;s the cooler weather or the sponge. I hope it&#x27;s the sponge so I have better looking skin year round! :)</li>
    <li> This product is amazing. It leaves my skin so soft!</li>
    <li> I break out occasionally and use epiduo and aczone to help my skin but since using the sponge have had no breakouts at all :) I use it at night with avene trixera wash face soap. Too great wow</li>
    <li> This is the 2nd time I&#x27;m purchasing the Konjac sponge.  I completely love it!  The texture is great, its long lasting; I use it everyday.  I still have my old one which is a different type (clay) and this one is charcoal...I highly recommend these sponges.  Great product.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t see any difference with my acne</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had a clarisonic for years, but this is a really great alternative. Something about it is just easier. While I&#x27;ve only been using it a few days, I sm a huge fan!</li>
    <li> This changes my skin! I can&#x27;t thank the maker of this product enough. I get almost no acne since I have been using this product. I use it along with the ACURE products, it its just amazing. My skin is softer and I never get cystic acne anymore- I used to get some on the back of my neck. I have also recently went gluten free which helps as well...but even before I noticed a dramatic difference. Thank you Konjac Sponge!</li>
    <li> Does a good job cleaning.  Very Gentle on the skin.</li>
    <li> It dried  up in a few days and it was useless</li>
    <li> I was recently introduced to Konjac Charcoal Sponges and I am in love. I reviewed another brand last month and I would say that this brand ranks right up there. I can feel how much cleaner my face is even without cleanser when I use this! The wider end is great for large surface areas like my cheeks, with the pointed ends being perfect for hard to reach spots around my eyes!!! I usually use it with a cleanser (just my preference) but I have used alone on days where I was makeup free and I was seriously amazed at how clean my face felt afterwards. And, without the dryness that a lot of facial cleansers can cause. I have found something that will definitely be in my beauty routine forever.</li>
    <li> I have been using konjac sponges twice a day for about a year, and my skin has never been smoother and more even.  I prefer the shape of this one to the more circular shaped kind, as it is easy to hold.&lt;br /&gt;I have tried several brands, but this konjac sponge is the most durable.  However, these do disintigrate, so I am forced to buy a new one every 2-3 months; I wish the price was a little lower or if they sold the product in bulk form.</li>
    <li> I started using the Konjac sponge 5 months ago.  It made a huge difference in my skin.  My skin got smoother and clearer.  I am now on my second Konjac sponge, and I have made this sponge a part of my skin cleansing routine.  I plan on giving some sponges out as Christmas presents this year, too :))</li>
    <li> This is great for sensitive and oily skin since it can be used with any cleanser. I really love the exfoliating properties.</li>
    <li> Sponge is fine but the third party I bought it from spams for reviews and will not stop unless you opt out.</li>
    <li> Alright so I am going to admit right off the bat here I had low expectations for this product. However, My Konjac Sponge has impressed me!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had never heard of it before, and while I owned, and have used, natural sea sponges in the past, it has been years, and so many other cool items have come out in the mean time. Regardless, this sponge is pretty darn cool! You wouldn&#x27;t know by looking at it in the packaging, and feeling it as it comes rock hard, but it gets so soft, so squishy, yet has just the right amount of exfoliating surface to get all the dead skin cells off without harming your skin one bit!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When you get it wet it feels like a spongy gel like blob almost in your hand and I know that does not make it sound appealing but you just have to feel it on your face!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When you are done using it you hang it to dry and it is pretty much dry the next morning getting hardened up again and it really just does not look or feel like something you want to clean your skin with but when you wet it - it gets all soft and gel like again almost as if it is living! I love it! I do not exfoliate my skin often enough, and I hate those chemical peels. I have tried a peel once and I just can&#x27;t bring myself to put those chemicals on my face again. This is my alternative natural way of getting deal skin cells off of my face from now on.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this sponge for a few weeks and I&#x27;m very happy with it. It produces a nice lather with the cleanser I use and makes my skin feel super clean and soft.</li>
    <li> This sponge is a great discovery. I did not know what to expect myself, but others had said it was great and now I agree. First, it is soft. I had thought it would be coarse and perhaps too abrasive for my skin. Also, the package said it is good for blemishes and, again I was concerned as I do not have that issue. I simply needed gentle exfoliating. This sponge has left my skin very soft and smooth with no signs of harshness. I have heard that it is important to let the sponge dry after using, which I am doing.</li>
    <li> Too soft and makes my skin very dry</li>
    <li> Works great. I love this more than the first Konjac I purchased (different brand). It&#x27;s a great size, and the little string to hang it with allows it to dry quickly and without touching my germy counter. I love this sponge. This is my second purchase.</li>
    <li> Noticed a positive change in my skin in just a few uses.</li>
    <li> This is a great and decent size sponge for oily faces. I use it every morning.</li>
    <li> First purchased this product because of the countless 5 star reviews. After the first use, I fell in love with how soft my skin felt during and after I scrubbed my face. I used the sponge for about 2 months, and later on to my disappointment I started getting bumps and dry skin on both sides of my cheeks. I decided to stop using the sponge for a week, and they lessened.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: I have sensitive and dry skin. I would not recommend the charcoal sponge for those in the same boat. There is an option for sensitive skin.. But personally, I would stray away from facial sponges altogether. I think the texture may still be a little too rough for my skin.</li>
    <li> The sponge worked great for the first few weeks. However, I have noticed that it is beginning to disintegrate after using it once a day. Just be careful how hard you wash face I guess....</li>
    <li> Provides a very gentle exfoliation</li>
    <li> Love the sponge!! Really adds to your skin care regimen!</li>
    <li> Soft and gentle. My skin definitely improves so much better than before. If you keep it dry and clean, it can reuse up to forever. Obviously no more good nutrition but it is useable. For that price you should at least try one in your life for your life.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a sucker for any product that is great for the skin. When I first received the product it reminded me of a beauty blender lol but when I wet it, it became this soft sponge. I washed my face in circular movements and wonder if I was doing it correctly but I instantly saw that my skin was being exfoliated in a different kind of way. Three days later I have noticed soft glowing skin that feels smooth and soft to the touch. There are so many added healthy benefits that I am in love with like the Bamboo Charcoal... Charcoal is highly absorbant and it penetrates deeply into pores to draw out impurities and toxins. Refines texture and it encourages skin renewal, leaving my skin smooth and refreshed. I love that this sponge is handmade and biodegradable and can be composted after use. This sponge is amazing and it&#x27;s so good for my skin!!</li>
    <li> Best facial sponge ever.</li>
    <li> Great konjac sponge.  Works well with my cleanser and provides very gentle exfoliation.</li>
    <li> I purchased this along with the green one and I regret it.This did nothing to help my skin, in fact, I broke out every single day I used it. I was so frustrated I didn&#x27;t understand what was going on and realized using this product was the only thing I did differently. Once I stopped using it, I stopped breaking out. This thing is awful.</li>
    <li> If you have a problem with texture don&#x27;t get this sponge, when it is wet it feels like gross slime..Yuck, I don&#x27;t even know if it works, it just made my gag reflux kick in..</li>
    <li> This is a great product! I can highly recomend it. My skin feels so soft and clean after using this.</li>
    <li> Good for the first month or so but after it ended up breaking out.  I bought a second one but the same thing happened.  Won&#x27;t be purchasing a third.</li>
    <li> I love the feel of this sponge, and the size/shape is perfect. Much better than the Boscia konjac sponges, which cost twice as much at Sephora. This will be my brand from now on!</li>
    <li> This may be common sense, but make sure the sponge is thoroughly wet before using. I used it over acne while it was only a little damp and it irritated my acne quite a bit. Once it&#x27;s completely wet though, it feels really good!</li>
    <li> I would like to give this sponge five stars because its no other like this one! I especially adore the charcoal ones because of my oily and a bit sensitive skin. I&#x27;ve been using the sponge for awhile and I don&#x27;t think I can ever wash my face again without it. It really works great for washing off make ups. It&#x27;s also easy to take care of and one sponge lasts long! so you don&#x27;t have to worry about the price</li>
    <li> It does cleans my face thoroughly. It does not remove black heads. But since I don&#x27;t have acne problems, I don&#x27;t know if it really helps with that.</li>
    <li> I like this sponge a lot although I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s quite the miracle worker that other reviewers tout it to be... at least not for me. I&#x27;ve been using it for about 2 months now, I only use it at night after I remove my makeup. It is a nice exfoliator, and helps eliminate the occasional visible dry patches/flaking skin that I get on top of my oilyness. But my skin isn&#x27;t any less oily or break-out prone than before I started with the sponge. I do like that it&#x27;s gentle and that the sponge allows me to take a break from harsher cleansers in the evening, so I will continue using it and plan to buy another when I need it. Just don&#x27;t expect a miracle!</li>
    <li> I love this sponge!! It&#x27;s so soft and cleared up my skin after like one use! Definitely worth the money this is a high quality product. I&#x27;d never used one of these sponges before and now I&#x27;m totally addicted! I want to buy the rest of them!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried this one and the pink one so far, alternating uses. My skin looks better and seems clearer. My daughter is going to try the green one next.</li>
    <li> Better then i expected! My boyfriend ordered one as well from a different user and his is alot smaller. He is always trying to steal mine :) thanks you so much i will be buying more in the future!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product since it first came out and I fell in love with it right away. I always have oily, acne prone skin and this product is magical. Washing my face with this sponge helps reduce my oil. I used to blot my face every 2 hours, but since I have started using this sponge to wash my face, I only need to blot once a day in the evening. I also notice my blackheads disappear after few days of using it.&lt;br /&gt;This product is amazing and worth all the pennies you spend!</li>
    <li> Product got great reviews, I did notice how slimy it was coming out of the package though!  Product seems to work well enough, but I don&#x27;t see anything groundbreaking compared to my Clarisonic</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s pretty nice! I&#x27;ve been using it for a few weeks and I like how it feels on my skin. It&#x27;s not like my holy grail beauty product and makes my skin glow like a radioactive baby&#x27;s butt, but it certainly feels nice when I exfoliate with it. The texture is wonderful and the teardrop shape of it fits really nicely in my hand. I am still on the fence on whether I would repurchase it again, but there&#x27;s nothing about it that I don&#x27;t like.</li>
    <li> This is a very nice Konjac sponge facial cleaner.  It&#x27;s the right size for my small hands and has a looped string so that it may be hung up to air dry.&lt;br /&gt;This sponge comes in dry form, but when wet it becomes pliable and soft.  It&#x27;s a very gently exfoliator made of natural materials.&lt;br /&gt;The only issue is it&#x27;s shelf-life: One to two months and then it will need replacing.  It may be prone to growing mildew if not rinsed cleaned and dried thoroughly after every use.&lt;br /&gt;I received the Konjac sponge for the purpose of review. All opinions are my own and based on my own use of the item.</li>
    <li> This does a beautiful job of exfoliating my skin without being too harsh. It does a nice job of absorbing excess oil in my skin. Since I have started using it, I have seen a major reduction in both my closed comedones (whiteheads) and my cystic acne.</li>
    <li> Loved it! Works so well to gently exfoliate my skin (which is sensitive/oily) but I&#x27;m sure it would work for any type of skin. I use it once a day because of how sensitive my skin is, but normal skin could probably use it twice easily - it&#x27;s that awesome. Highly recommended! I&#x27;ll definitely be buying it again.</li>
    <li> been using this for a week and my skin looks light years better - i have a lot of blackheads on my nose but tiny pores - i&#x27;ve tried everything to get rid of them - peels, nose strips, facials - but nothing has worked until the konjac sponge.  true miracle worker</li>
    <li> This is the best sponge that I have ever tried. It&#x27;s 100% natural and biodegradable. It&#x27;s super soft when is wet. I feel peace when I pass the sponge in all my face. I have noticed that my pores are smaller, mi skin is clean, fresh and I noticed a huge difference when I applied my foundation. The makeup looks better. The pores look beautiful. I highly recommend to add this sponge to your beauty routine.&lt;br /&gt;@MakeupByOne</li>
    <li> update july 2015: have purchased about seven of these sponges.  the most recent one arrived without a string.  emailed the company on saturday, received a reply within minutes.  company&#x27;s solution was perfect.  nice to purchase from a company that shows high level of concern for their customers.  -- original review: i purchased one for myself, then a second and third for my kids.  the sponge feels good on the face, the string is handy for hanging up after use.  i do not know how it compares to similar products, i have not purchased these types of sponges from other companies.</li>
    <li> So, the sponge does feel nice - I have been using it for about a week. My skin is softer, but I have had a lot more pimples on my nose for some reason. I am thinking that maybe I had some oil deep down in my pores and it is now coming up, but I am not sure. My forehead has cleared up from breakouts - perhaps soon my whole face will be clear. I plan to keep on using it for the time being because my skin does feel smoother, and softer. Hopefully in the next week or so the breakouts will lessen.</li>
    <li> Typically you use charcoal, also called carbon, to remove organic chemicals from substances like water. So, as you might easily imagine, using this sponge with chlorinated water will quickly render the minuscule amount of charcoal in these sponges useless as the charcoal is rapidly used up as the chlorine is absorbed. The manufacturer apparently knows this and neglects to put any information about the useful life of the charcoal on their packaging. A glaring omission is stating how long the charcoal lasts. Obviously, there are no benefits, so they avoid mentioning any. As far as the texture of the sponge goes, I think it&#x27;s great. It&#x27;s soft and lasts for 2 weeks maximum with 2 face washings per day. After 2 weeks the surface breaks down and at that point it becomes ineffective. It&#x27;s clear that the manufacturer is using charcoal as a gimmick. The charcoal incorrectly adds perceived value to what should be a very, very inexpensive product. For me the value of these sponges at first was pretty high, but after analyzing the facts I feel that these sponges would be properly valued at 1/4 their cost.</li>
    <li> My daughter loves her Konjac sponge. Makes yoiur skin very soft.</li>
    <li> I really like the konjac spong. Is really feels nice on my skin and i have sensitive skin. This sponge doesn&#x27;t hurt my skin at all. IT&#x27;S So. Gentle i can use it in the morning and at night and it wont hurt my skin and my skin feels really clean love it and will purshes again</li>
    <li> The Konjac sponge worked very well for my daughter.  The charcoal in it helped to exfoliate and deep clean her face without irritation. She loves the way her skin feels after using the Konjac sponge.  It is a great product.  I would highly recommend it to anyone who is dealing with acne-prone skin.</li>
    <li> I never knew I would love washing my face as much as I do with these sponges! I saw a You Tuber talk about them once, orederd them and have since repurchased two!</li>
    <li> I was excited to try this out, it had high reviews, but it didn&#x27;t last as long as I had hoped. Barely 2 months and it&#x27;s falling apart. With the right cleanser and toner it works well. I saw a nice improvement in acne prone skin.wish it was cheaper for how quickly it is destroyed</li>
    <li> Bought this for my wife and daughter.  Both love how well it works.</li>
    <li> MIRACLE!  Cleared up my skin so well (adult acne, milia), leaves it polished and smooth.  This is a must-have product!!  Love it.</li>
    <li> It didnt do as expected, didnt seem to help with or prevent acne for me anyways.</li>
    <li> This sponge is WAY better than Boscia&#x27;s complexion clearing sponge. I absolutely love the large, triangular shape- it gets into small nooks and crannies of my face. I&#x27;ve noticed my face stays comfortable (not overly oily) on my T-zone when I use this regularly. It&#x27;s a better alternative to the sponges at Sephora, and most definitely the best I&#x27;ve used thus far. I&#x27;m hooked!</li>
    <li> Believe it or not, I&#x27;ve always used rubbing alcohol and cotton pads on my face. It&#x27;s cheap, simple, quick, and cuts through oil and makeup remover like nothing else. I HATE having water on my face and the rubbing alcohol/cotton pad method has kept my face reasonably blemish free through my teen years. But I wanted to be a little kinder to my skin. At least on occasion. So I tried this sponge out, as it has lots of good reviews. Let me go ahead and say that the size is not an issue. It fits in my hand just right and isn&#x27;t too small at all. It soaks in water and gets soft in less than 30 seconds and is really gentle on the skin. Is it a miracle worker? Eh, I haven&#x27;t noticed a huge difference. But I&#x27;m not suffering from extreme acne, either. I don&#x27;t care for the &amp;#34;sponge&amp;#34; smell that it has now, but I&#x27;ve read that a microwave can fix that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My point: For the face, it&#x27;s better to use this than a rag or loofa. In my opinion. It&#x27;s more gentle and works well with suds. Will it be your cure-all for facial blemishes or oily skin? Who knows! It hasn&#x27;t made mine worse, though!</li>
    <li> I love how this sponge feels once i massage my face it doesn&#x27;t feel rough nor never scratched my skin the sponge feels so pampering spa like this sponge really cleanse my face clean leaving it very soft and pampered it really scrubs out all access oil very well</li>
    <li> I always wanted to use it and now, it&#x27;s one of my &amp;#34;must use&amp;#34; item. It prevents acne and pimples, and helps for oily skin. It makes my skin smooth, too.</li>
    <li> Cali Julz says...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Who knew this rock that looks like its from a volcano could work such wonders with my mature skin! Not only is the texture improved, I have noticed I don&#x27;t get those occasional breakouts as much and my makeup just goes on so much better.</li>
    <li> I actually liked this product. It was dry and hard out of the package and needed to be wet to soften it up. I didn’t use any cleanser with it because I wanted to see what it was like on its own. I visibly saw my face less oily and seemed like the breakouts I had were more “muted” than before. These results were almost immediate. I wanted to let it dry completely before using again and start the process over.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;  • Does not leave my face oily&lt;br /&gt;  • No need for additional product (although I washed my face first and then used it but I usually use 2 products to wash my face anyway.)&lt;br /&gt;  • I saw less breakouts the times I used it&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;  • I live in a dry climate but had a rainy season therefore the sponge took days to dry.&lt;br /&gt;  • The place I put it to dry wasn’t in sight of when I washed my face so I forgot to use it at times when I wanted to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Final Recommendation:&lt;br /&gt;I like this product and will keep using it in my normal facial cleansing routine.  I like natural products that work and this one did on my skin type.</li>
    <li> Damn... this thing powered through my black heads like I didn&#x27;t have em in the first place.</li>
    <li> I have blackhead issues on my nose. After using this sponge, with no soap, I could see my blackheads start to lift. It was like they were being pulled to the surfaces. I&#x27;ve heard about how effective charcoal is for your face but never expected this. Also, this product leaves your skin soft without feeling over-exfoliated. Last, it takes a bit to fill the sponge with water. I recommend letting it soak in the sink for a little while instead of running it under water.</li>
    <li> Love this sponge. I have been using this for a week and have seen good results. I have oily skin and prone to acne and this sponge has helped me with my skin problem.</li>
    <li> I have been using it for a few weeks and I have to say I am impressed!  It&#x27;s great for all skin types and you don&#x27;t even need to use cleanser with it (I&#x27;m a product junkie so that part was hard for me!). After using the sponge my skin felt really clean, soft &amp; smooth and that was all without using additional product.  However, you can use it with your normal facial cleanser as well, which I did on a few occasions!  Cool product!</li>
    <li> May I please have a refund?  I thoroughly researched the konjac sponges and after reading the positive reviews, I bought this brand and wasted my money.  Only 4 uses and it is nothing but a pile of grey stuff at the bottom of my sink now.  :(  The first three times, it felt nice on the face, but cannot really say if it was cleansing.  I followed all the directions, but it is nothing but powdery stuff.  If the owner reads this, please refund my money.  I am hoping I got a bad batch rather than say your product is bad.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t really see any difference with using this sponge to using something else.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m giving this product four stars, simply because I think I had high expectations. It did deliver... Somewhat.    When the package is opened, one is greeted by a small, almost tear shaped hard sponge. I&#x27;m talking pumice hard. A quick run underneath warm water ensures its softening, and it&#x27;s really quite delightful on the skin - soft and not abrasive. It&#x27;s sort of odd basting your face with something that resembles a kitchen cleaning tool, but nevertheless, I know I felt a keen difference after I had finished wiping my face. My skin felt fresher, lighter, and like I had just cleansed it without all the heaviness and clogged pores. I was rather impressed. I rinsed it under warm water, hung it up to dry, and ta-da - done. Great for busy women and mothers.    Now I bought this product because I was really hopeful it would get rid of some of that nasty acne and whiteheads that followed me straight out of the teen years and into adulthood.This is where my expectations far exceeded reality. I had in my mind that I was going to be the next Loreal-Skin-So-Smooth model. So, whilst this product did clear it up a ton, which, I suppose, is a miracle in itself, I still have a little bit which is probably only noticeable to me.    Just a note of warning, this sponge does not dry if you live in a humid environment, or your bathroom doesn&#x27;t see the light of day (i.e doesn&#x27;t have a window, like mine). I hung mine on my faucet to begin with and it would still feel damp by 24 hours. I now hang mine in my bedroom on a coat hanger which seems to do the trick. You&#x27;ll want it to dry out completely by next use to prevent the invitation for a mold party.</li>
    <li> This single handily cleared my acne and made my face glow. I am on my 5th one and can&#x27;t say enough good things. Best find ever!</li>
    <li> Perfect sponge for sensitive skin. I had recently started a new prescribed topical treatment for acne that was leaving my skin dry, flaky, and itchy. This sponge eliminated all flakiness without being too harsh. Sponge is great quality and cheaper compared to other online stores. Will definitely be repurchasing.</li>
    <li> Product came right on time, and works very well! It left my skin feeling silky smooth without having to use any face wash at all! This is ideal for me in the mornings since I don&#x27;t like to put too much strain on my skin with a ton of products. It is soft and spongy and not abrasive yet works like a scrubbing agent. I love it!</li>
    <li> This thing is awesome.  I purchased it in January and it&#x27;s still working like new.  It NEVER stinks.  It dries out between uses. I hang it from the pump of my cleanser.  I don&#x27;t know if it has any benefits but I like using it.  I rotator it&#x27;s use with my Clarisonic. I want one big enough for my body. Do they make them bigger?</li>
    <li> This is great for daily exfoliating, I wash my face with this every evening.  It is gentle and just right.</li>
    <li> I ordered this specific sponge because I needed something to exfoliate with and wanted something natural.  I had reviewed other sponges by this same company, but decided on this one because somewhere along my brief research I read that it was good for sensitive skin.  So far, I&#x27;m not disappointed in the least!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this once a week, to keep my skin from over-stressing (I have extremely sensitive skin), and have yet to experience any.  Once I&#x27;m done in the shower, I take it out of the bathroom (mine is small with no ventilation, so it can stay humid and warm for a while after I shower) and hang it around the neck of a hangar in my bedroom so it dries out quickly and to prevent internal molding.  When dry, it is thin and very hard, like a rock.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Further info:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use a sulfur soap with dead sea salt by ADOVIA for my face daily and CeraVe Moisturizing Lotion for face and body after every wash.</li>
    <li> Really no different than using a washcloth.  It didn&#x27;t take my makeup off, like I was lead to believe, so I had to use soap. Meh...it&#x27;s alright.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a WHOLE lot smaller than I thought it would be and it&#x27;s a different shape as well. In the picture this sponge looks to be a teardrop shape at every dimension, but it&#x27;s not bulbous. It&#x27;s actually flat with a round raised portion that comes up about half an inch to an inch and the tip to the bottom of the sponge is roughly 4&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As the description states that it has charcoal and bamboo particles and whatnot and that you can use it without soap, it leads you to believe that the sponge has some kind of coating on it to clean up with. That doesn&#x27;t appear to be the case and when you run water over it, you don&#x27;t get a lather either. It would appear that this is just an overpriced sponge worth about $5, not $10. However, the sponge is soft and it seems usable in place of my loofah that&#x27;s getting ratty. The small size might come in handy to keep my shower tidy and I plan on using my Axe body wash with it, so I don&#x27;t need any pre-applied cleanser anyway.</li>
    <li> Love these sponges! Made my face clear up too!</li>
    <li> This sponge is amazing! I like that I can use it with or without facial cleanser. I will be purchasing these for family members this Christmas!</li>
    <li> This sponge is great. It has a unique texture that does a good job cleaning your face. It contours to the curves of your face as it helps cleans without irritating your skin. I had seen some reviews on YouTube and decided to buy one. I take this in my dopp kit when I travel. I can leave my exfoliate products and powered facial brushes home. It would be interesting to see a larger &amp;#34;body sized&amp;#34; sponge offered.</li>
    <li> My daughter and I are very happy with this sponges.  We tried them and already ordered more!  I highly recommend them to others</li>
    <li> My Konjac Sponge was super nice and sent more one of there Bamboo Charcoal Sponges to try last month. I have never used a facial sponge before and did not know what to expect. The bamboo charcoal sponge says it helps oily acne prone skin, which I really didn&#x27;t know how to feel about. A sponge that will help get rid of acne, no way. I have to say I was totally wrong, since using this sponge I have not had a break out at all. Besides that my face looks smoother and very healthy. This is a wonderful product and is totally worth the cost.</li>
    <li> I literally don&#x27;t even know if this works in any way, I use it a lot because it feels AWESOME. Just get one for rubbing on your face. I recommend it.</li>
    <li> Fantastic product, which I use after shaving and seems to calm my face, i.e., no razor rash or &amp;#34;nibs.&amp;#34; Vendor delivered very quickly. I am totally satisfied with this purchase.</li>
    <li> This actually helps calm the oil on my skin and I don&#x27;t even have to use a harsh alcohol-based astringent.  I feel like it keeps the oil off my skin after I use it... loving it so far</li>
    <li> My skin feels smoother and cleaner than before I started using the sponge.  I highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on this sponge! It is VERY soft and doesn&#x27;t exfoliate at all. It takes about 3+ days for it to dry completely, keep in mind it was kept in a big room with lots of air circulating. I&#x27;ll just stick to using my hands.</li>
    <li> As someone with oily skin who struggled with acne as a teenager I know the importance of keeping your face really clean, wash rags and cheap luffas don&#x27;t always do the trick and can even damage the skin, I&#x27;ve been looking for a good natural face sponge designed for oily skin and the good people at MY Konjac Sponge have made a wonderful product out of Konjac fiber and activated Bamboo Charcoal, it feels great against the skin as it deep cleans without being hurting your skin or causing irritation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hypoallergenic, Fragrance free, vegan and made to the hugest standards, you can tell this company puts allot into the product. This is without a doubt my favorite sponge, I read the packaging luckily because I tend to be hard on my product, glad I read not to wring it out, and it&#x27;s worked out and held up really well after several showers. I would highly recommend this I think it would make a great addition to any gift basket, and a great addition to anyone&#x27;s bathroom.</li>
    <li> Very nice feel on skin, cleans very well. Will buy again.</li>
    <li> Fantastic purchase! I am very happy with it.&lt;br /&gt;With the sponge, there is no need for soap, which is perfect for sensitive skins! besides, when travelling, now I just need to have the sponge with me to wash my face any time, anywhere, that&#x27;s one of the reasons I really like it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even after the first use, the skin really feels cleaner and softer, perfectly smooth. I&#x27;m definitely using one of these sponges from now on.</li>
    <li> Based on other reviews I had high hopes for this facial sponge, but unfortunately I didn&#x27;t find anything special about it :(&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does the job (i.e. gently cleaning the face), but no more and no less than any other kind of natural sponge that I&#x27;ve tried, which - at least to me - doesn&#x27;t justify its price tag.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Additionally, both sponges I bought started breaking apart after a few weeks of use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Advice: to prolong the sponge life, don&#x27;t hang it. It comes with a string for hanging, but the weight of the sponge after using it - even after gently squeezing the water out of it - is too much for it. As a result, the sponge starts breaking apart at the string connection and is fast useless.</li>
    <li> I love this sponge - it comes with a little string attached so you can hang it in the shower. After using the sponge with face wash, it easily rinses clean and dries out. The next time you want to use it, you just leave it under the water for a few minutes to soften it back up again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have noticed a difference in my skin since beginning to use this sponge and think it has been softer (and feels cleaner).</li>
    <li> This thing is amazing. Im sure that it was made from unicorn magic. It feels normal when scrubbing your skin but then you touch your skin and feel brand new.</li>
    <li> I ordered this after reading the reviews and have been very happy with it. It seems to have cleared up the blackheads I have been fighting with.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s alright. I haven&#x27;t seen much improvement or changes. I think my Aveeno pads were better.</li>
    <li> These sponges are natural, affordable, time-saving and give you results. I used them as a youth in Japan and suffered no teenage acne.</li>
    <li> I look forward to using this. The shipping was fast and it was a great price. I used it for the first time last night and I have very oily, shiny skin. It cut most of the oil my face did feel clean but I still washed my face with my sodium sulfacetamide suffer cleanser.</li>
    <li> I never write reviews but I just had to say that this sponge is fantastic!  I have sensitive, combination skin and have had very problematic skin for about a year and a half now (lots of acne, some dry patches, some oily patches).  I have tried all sorts of different face washes, toners, moisturizers, you name it--with little to no success.  I decided to try this sponge because of the reviews and its relatively low cost.  After the first use, my skin felt AMAZING.  After using it once a day for the past month, my skin looks so much better! It has helped my acne go away and my skin looks brighter and more even.  Every person&#x27;s skin is different, but this sponge is definitely worth a try, especially if you have sensitive skin and have had trouble finding products that work.</li>
    <li> This sponge is great.  It feels so good on my face and neck.  I would like to find a more efficient way to clean the sponge because it holds a LOT of soap and takes a little bit of work to get it all out, though.</li>
    <li> I had never heard of this product before, but from the reviews it sounded like it might be good for my face.  I have very oily skin with flaking.  I&#x27;ve been using this sponge for a couple weeks now (once or twice a day) and really love it.  It does not feel abrasive, but does a great job exfoliating.  I have used it with and without cleanser - both ways work wonderfully.  It has alleviated most of my oil problems and leaves my face feeling soft and smooth.  Some reviews indicated that it started breaking apart, but I have not had that problem.  The string is very handy for hanging it up to dry.  I will definitely purchase this product again and may buy a couple for stocking stuffers!</li>
    <li> I love this sponge. I let it soak in distilled water before I start my evening routine, and by the time I&#x27;ve gotten my makeup off, brushed teeth, etc., it&#x27;s good to go! It&#x27;s gentle enough to use every day with a face cleanser, and now it has its own little hanging spot in my bathroom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The texture is so weird and awesome. It&#x27;s definitely spongy, but a little jelly-like? Once you wring it out a little, it&#x27;s pretty much a normal little sponge. Will definitely be buying a fresh one in a few months!!</li>
    <li> I though that it would be a little rough to buffer my dead skin but it&#x27;s not it&#x27;s too soft when you wet it</li>
    <li> I love how this sponge leaves my skin feeling so clean and smooth. It does not feel overly dried out and tight, like some products leave your skin feeling. I have oily skin but I&#x27;m also 48. I like that it can be used without a cleanser as well. I&#x27;ve tried it both ways and it&#x27;s just as effective without a cleanser. Love it!</li>
    <li> This product was for my 14 year old daughter. She LOVES it!!!  She uses it in her &amp;#34;T&amp;#34; zone and it has made a world of difference. It makes her skin very soft and noticeably smoother....definitely less oily. It is very simple and quick to use which is a PLUS for a teenager. I will definitely get another one if ever needed.</li>
    <li> This is great, I use it with a daily wash and it works great. It is so soft on my face but yet does the job.</li>
    <li> I like it 💞💞💞💞easy to use , deep clean and very soft on the face💞💞😘😘😘</li>
    <li> Love it! I&#x27;ve been using it for some time now and super impressed: I hadn&#x27;t had any acne at all! Plus the sponge is super soft and exfoliating at the same time! Love it and definitely would repurchase!</li>
    <li> I love my Konjac sponge! I suffer from adult acne, and am always on the look out of new products for treatment. I have to admit I didn&#x27;t know what to expect, and have never tried a sponge of this kind before. It arrived dry, and kind of reminded me of rice cakes. After soaking it, it softened quite a bit, and was soft on my skin. Don&#x27;t expect a rough scrubbing exfoliation with this sponge, but a soft gentle exfoliation, Your skin will be soft and smooth without damage from harsh scrubbing.&lt;br /&gt;After using it for a week, I have noticed less acne, and less oil production- along with smoother, healthier, and glowing skin.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you for this wonderful product!</li>
    <li> Gentle exfoliation that leaves my skin soft! I use it almost every day.</li>
    <li> The difference wasn&#x27;t immediate or dramatic but I think it was well worth the price. When I started using it I was in the middle of a particularly annoying breakout. The gentle exfoliation didn&#x27;t rub my blemishes to harshly and seemed to take care of my oiliness well. I&#x27;ve been using it twice a day since I got it and haven&#x27;t had any major breakouts since. I&#x27;ve used it both with and without cleanser and find that I prefer it without.</li>
    <li> Amazing product! It leaves your skin smooth and clean. Moreover, it is handmade in Korea, vegan &amp; cruelty-free! Best product ever.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t understand the hype over these sponges.  Did nothing for me.  I can&#x27;t say that it&#x27;s bad because its not but didn&#x27;t improve upon anything either.</li>
    <li> This is an amazing product. It does the job without making my face feel like it was exfoliated with sand paper. It exfoliates while leaving your skin smooth and fresh feeling.I ddefinitely recommend this product to all skin types. I have dry skin and I use this every night. I love it.</li>
    <li> Great soft sponge that enables you to clean your face without touching it too much with your hands! Pair it with a cleanser or use it by itself.</li>
    <li> I thought would be much thicker.  I had one before it was double of thicken of this on.  Bmc facial sponges are better quality.</li>
    <li> Today we are going to take a look at this facial product called MY Konjac Sponge Bamboo Charcoal Facial Sponge. When I got the sponge and took it out of the package I was like, “Boy this is stiff and has to be scratchy on the face.” Well once I put the sponge in the water it softened right up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The sponge is said to help with preventing and helping clear up acne so I was excited to try this as my son’s face breaks out easy.  When I first opened it up I got excited to try it that I wasn’t sure if I was suppose to put any soap or anything on it. Well I read the instructions and it says just get it wet until it is soft and moist and then rub it in a circular motion. I had him us it from day one to see if it would help his acne and to be honest did not notice any difference in his complexion.  I guess after doing more reading I could use it with a cleaner but then what is this? Just another sponge huh? I do like how there is a string that allows you to hang it when you dry so that it is not just laying in a tray or where it can still absorb or not release the absorbed water. I also used this on my face as well to see how well it cleaned my foundation off my face and then took a white cloth and washed my face again and it still had foundation on the cloth. I guess this one confused me as to what the main focus on it was.</li>
    <li> This is used by my 13 year old daughter who has some acne pimples and oily skin on T zone.  It is not severe but she is using Burt&#x27;s Bees creamy cleanser for sensitive skin to clean her face. THen she uses KONJAC and rubs around face for a minute or so.  She says her skin is soft.  Afterwards she splashes cold water to close pores and is ready to put on her toner.  She uses THayers alcohol free witch hazel toner in Rose petal.  She doesn&#x27;t like the cucumber smell.  She likes the lavendar one too.  Alcohol free works for her sensitive skin.  She likes this so far.  Been using for a little while now about 4 days a week.  Hopefully continues to work for her.  So far a positive product.</li>
    <li> I really enjoy the level of exfoliation this provides.  The product was priced appropriately and shipped quickly.</li>
    <li> Started &amp;#34;shedding&amp;#34; /fell apart on me within a week or so of use..  I followed the directions exactly but ended up just throwing it in the trash.</li>
    <li> Thank you reallylve this sponge! Makes my face soooo soft</li>
    <li> Too soft for my skin needs and it started to fall apart within 12 uses. Also I hhaven&#x27;t noticed my skin being any clearer but I will say that I only used it about 15  times.</li>
    <li> I have been using my sponge for 2 weeks now and so far no issues for me. I enjoy how it helps clean and exfoliate my skin.</li>
    <li> Love this! Very easy to use with either cleanser or just water. It&#x27;s very gentle and feels nice!</li>
    <li> Item is very easy to use - and after one week of use, it does seem to make my skin softer.  It is surprisingly soft - I was expecting something more abrasive - but it still does the trick.  If you&#x27;re looking for exfoliation - this isn&#x27;t it - but rather it gently cleanses the skin and is excellent at removing makeup.  I also noticed that I&#x27;m not using much of my facial cleanser - this works just fine on its own.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s soft and bouncy and you don&#x27;t feel much scrubbing, but skin is getting  so clean, even and soft after using this sponge...</li>
    <li> Amazing! I&#x27;ve heard great things about these sponges, but I&#x27;ve always been a little Leary of &#x27;gentle&#x27; exfoliators because I don&#x27;t feel like they do anything. Not the case with this! I noticed a difference in my skin after the second use. Super soft, and my pores actually seem smaller! My makeup also goes on much better. I would recommend this sponge to anyone, in fact, I&#x27;m getting a bunch for Christmas gifts. Definitely a must!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure if the bamboo charcoal is doing anything for my skin, but this is a very gentle sponge.  It feels almost gelatinous when wet. But don&#x27;t be mistaken: it does exfoliate.  So be gentle to your face.  I think I over used it at first, and had opened up some acne on my face and had a bit of a mess the following week.  My skin is very sensitive.  I use it sparingly now, to get an extra deep clean when I feel like I need it. Not sure how long this should last, but I guess like most sponges it can grow bacteria if you don&#x27;t keep it in a place where it can properly dry out.  But if you like to use scrubs or brushes on your face, I&#x27;d recommend this as a more natural alternative.</li>
    <li> Smooths skin &amp; tightens pores, yet it is very gentle on skin.&lt;br /&gt;After trying it out, I ordered extras for my friends.</li>
    <li> I love the Konjac sponge! It arrived earlier than expected, and has really helped my skin. It exfoliates very gently which is great for everyday use. My nose blackheads are almost completely gone. I would definitely repurchase.</li>
    <li> So far, I have only used my sponge a few times, but I love it! Already my skin looks smoother !</li>
    <li> I love this sponge.  It&#x27;s gentle enough to use 2-3 times a day and I love how soft and smooth my face feels afterward.  Also, you don&#x27;t have small fibers that are left behind if you use a washcloth.  I&#x27;ve noticed that my t-zone is less oily and I also have less dry patches around my eyes and chin.  The string makes it easy to hang up for drying.</li>
    <li> Does what it says and definitely feels very nice on skin but DOES NOT LAST LONG.  After about 2-3 weeks of use, the sponge became hard and rough even after soaking in warm water for a long time.</li>
    <li> After reading all of the positive reviews I thought it would be an awesome new product to try.  I was careful to always keep it moist but within a few weeks it developed tears and disintegrated.  Needless to say I do not recommend this product.</li>
    <li> This sponge has definitely helped keep my oily skin in check! I have recommended it to my fellow oily-skinned friends and will re-order.</li>
    <li> Helped my acne and the texture on my face tremendously. I love it. I use Avalon Organics Vitamin C Renewal Refreshing Cleansing Gel on it, and it&#x27;s a wonderful combo.</li>
    <li> I definitely prefer it to synthetic cleansing sponges I&#x27;ve used. It&#x27;s gentler on the skin ,lives it soft and ready for your skin routine.I used it with my cleanser but it seems that it can be used without one.It looks harsh before wetting it but actually it&#x27;s gentler than all others I used.I recommend it.</li>
    <li> I was really excited about purchasing this product, after reading such great reviews. I received the product quickly, thru my prime membership.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The sponge itself has a very unique texture, like a thin filmy texture. It&#x27;s very gentle not abrasive at all. I used it with a very gentle foaming face wash twice a day. Ran it under warm water and squeezed out any excess product, to clean it. And just hung to dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Less then a weeks use, and I can see that the sponge was beginning to deteriorate. A whole began to form in the center of the sponge. Needless to say I was very unhappy that I had to toss it. I really don&#x27;t feel I got my monies worth. I&#x27;m torn about buying another one. I really wanna like this product but don&#x27;t think I would buy it again.</li>
    <li> I love the charcoal facial sponge and use it exclusively in the mornings and at nights when I haven&#x27;t worn any makeup during the day.  I have combination skin and this is great for all of the different zones on my face leaving all of my skin fresh and vibrant looking after using it.  The sponge is very soft when fully wet and doesn&#x27;t feel like it&#x27;s even exfoliating as I use it, but my skin has never been softer or smoother.  I&#x27;ve tried other types of the konjac sponge as well and haven&#x27;t found one that I don&#x27;t like, but for times that I don&#x27;t want to add a little soap to the sponge, the charcoal is the best formulation that I&#x27;ve found.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried lots of konjac sponges over the years, and this one is really quite good.  Once you re-hydrate it, it is super soft and has a silky texture.  It was so soft, in fact, that I was worried it wouldn&#x27;t be a very good exfoliator.  I tend to wake up in the morning with little flaky patches around my chin and nose, and I like to do a light exfoliation so my makeup will apply smoothly.  This did a great job, with or without cleanser (though I prefer with cleanser), at buffing away the dry spots without any irritation whatsoever.  My skin is fairly acne prone, and I find if I over-scrub, I break out.  I&#x27;ve had no issues with this sponge causing skin issues.  It has stayed soft over it&#x27;s many uses, and is very easy to clean by boiling it in the a cup of water in the microwave.  I STRONGLY recommend keeping up on regular cleanings (once a week or so), or you risk contaminating your skin with sponge bacteria, and no body wants that noise.  This sponge works just as well as the more expensive sponges that I&#x27;ve tried, and MUCH better than the cheaper ones.  All in all, I&#x27;m looking forward to trying their other *flavors*! This product was sent to me for review, but these are my 100% honest reactions and I will certainly be purchasing this product in the future with my own money.</li>
    <li> It really does work you just need to be consistent. I will be buying the other sponges soon!! Great buy :)</li>
    <li> After a week, I&#x27;m already seeing great results. The sponge is a little smaller than expected and was moist in the packed when it arrived.</li>
    <li> I just started using it so i can&#x27;t really be sure it&#x27;s working! I do like how it feels on your skin though!</li>
    <li> This little sponge makes my face feel superclean.  It is gentle but really does the trick. I just hang it up to dry after use and make sure I am patient while getting it really wet before using it. No problems.</li>
    <li> I am very disappointed this sponge made no difference in my face cleansing routine.  I am 33 and have struggled with acne since I was 12.  I have very oily skin and hyperpigmentation.  I&#x27;m always very patient when it comes to trying new skin care product.  I consistently used this sponge for about a month with zero improvement to my skin.  Another disappointing product.</li>
    <li> I had never tried a Konjac sponge before this, so I had no idea what to expect from it. I knew it was supposed to be helpful for your face and assist in keeping pores clean, but that was really all I had to go on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first thing I noticed was that in the package, this sponge is hard as a rock. It reminded me of sea sponge, only it looked noting like anything I had ever seen. Once you add water to this, it instantly becomes soft and pliable, so much so that, except for the color, it seemed nothing like how it started. You can see in my photos the difference between the dry sponge in the first one and the wet sponge in the other two. The sponge absorbed the water so quickly, I had to squeeze some of it out before trying this on my face because it was dripping everywhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The sponge almost felt soapy once it had absorbed some water and felt almost strange when rubbing it across my face. Not strange in a bad way, just something different from any of the makeup type sponges I had tried before. It was not uncomfortable, and did not seem to have any smell or anything to it, just a very different sensation than I expected. It was super soft and glided easily across my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a week or so of using this, I could tell a definite change in my face. I normally have breakouts during menstruation, so that is when I chose to use this. I noticed a reduction of acne and a better overall appearance to my face after using this and it seems to have almost stopped the normal breakouts that I usually experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like that this comes on a string for hanging, so I don&#x27;t have to worry about it touching anything that could transfer to my face and it dries easily this way too. The next time I need it I just get it wet and use it again, no hassle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*I received a sample item for review purposes. All opinions are my own.</li>
    <li> i&#x27;ve had this product for about 2 weeks, and I haven&#x27;t noticed anything AMAZING come from it. I use it twice a day once in the morning (no cleanser) and once at night (with my DDF Saylic Wash) It does feel nice on my skin and it&#x27;s more gentle than the cleansing brush I was using, but as of right now, i&#x27;m not really sure it does anything special.</li>
    <li> I use this with just water in the mornings, my skin seems like it has been less dry and more smooth.</li>
    <li> I love this! It&#x27;s very gentle and soft. And it feels really good on your face. And it defiantly cleans my pores better than just using my hands.</li>
    <li> I love this product. I was skeptical at first, but I&#x27;ve had it for about 3 weeks now and I stop using soap for my face altogether.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only issue has been this week due to ahem certain hormone changes so my skin is oiler than normal, but my face is still loads clearer than it was before I started using it.</li>
    <li> I have used several different Konjac Sponges, but thus far, the My Konjac Sponge is my favorite. It is an affordable, all natural option for face care and it really works to keep my face oil free and clear. I love konjac sponges because they are easy to use, clean, and even store. Plus, they leave my skin soft and clear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use my My Konjac Sponge every day when I take my shower and it&#x27;s amazing how simple it is to use it. I just get it wet until it feels squishy then I use it around my face in circular motions for about a minute. Once it am done scrubbing my face with it, I rinse my skin and the sponge and just hang My Konjac Sponge to dry. I do sanitize it once a week by submerging it in boiling water for just a minute and hang it as usual.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This sponge is gentle, yet effective on my skin. It leaves my skin soft and clean. I no longer have an oily T-zone or dry cheeks and my skin looks and feels even and toned. Using this Konjac sponge is more affordable and effective than any expensive skin care program or product I have ever used. Many offer large promises and low results with an even higher price to pay. The My Konjac Sponge does what it says it will and is affordable at only $10. It also fits easier in my hand than others because it is large and it is egg shaped making it easier to use all over the face, even in the creases between the nose and cheek and chin crease. I am loving my results and plan to use My Konjac Sponge as my brand for years to come.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this sponge on my face for a few weeks now and my skin has never looked better.  It feels and looks much smoother. I love it so much I bought another one for the second bathroom so I always have one on hand. There are different varieties of these sponges for different types of skin so I recommend reading the details on skin type before you choose one.</li>
    <li> This sponge is awesome! Get it wet and it turns into a heavenly soft exfoliant for your face. It drys overnight and is ready to be used again the next day. I use it in my daily face washing routine and I can say that it will be a permanent addition.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using these about a week now and I can already tell a difference on my skin.  These sponges are great for cleaning the skin on my face and neck.</li>
    <li> This is the best product. I bought another one for a friend. Does a decent job of exfoliating (although I still use an exfoliating product - sugar scrub - no microbeads, please! - every couple weeks). What I really like is that it cleans without drying out my skin too much. I have always had trouble with oily, acne-prone skin, but this really seems to keep my skin clear. Wish I&#x27;d found this years ago. I also really like that it is smoother on my skin than a wash cloth and it gets into some of the smaller spaces, like around my nose and eyes well. I still have to use a make up remover to get mascara off, however.</li>
    <li> I was able to try out this product and let me tell you this is awesome! I don&#x27;t know why I never had one before. This cleans my face so well! I have oily skin so this works for me. I also use it dry to scrub my face with. I&#x27;m not sure if you&#x27;re supposed to do that, but I like it, especially since I have dry skin on my forehead. I would recommend these to anyone!</li>
    <li> Softens up nicely and feels good against your skin.  Works like it&#x27;s supposed to.</li>
    <li> If you have not had the pleasure of using a Konjac Sponge do not hesitate any longer.  I have tried 3 different ones over the past year and like them all!  I will always have one now.</li>
    <li> I have extremely sensitive skin, it&#x27;s dry and I suffer from rosacea so it&#x27;s often difficult to find products that work well but that don&#x27;t make my face feel red and irritated. I have tried a konjac sponge once before from another cheaper brand and didn&#x27;t have the best experience, while it didn&#x27;t have a major flair up, my skin felt irritated. When I had the opportunity to try out this particular Konjac sponge I was  bit leery from my past experience, but decided to give it a try anyway...I can always just give it to my daughter if I find it to be offensive to my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My konjac sponge arrived quickly, in perfect condition and nicely packaged. The packaged included very clear instructions for use and left me with no questions on what I should do. I think that the konjac sponges are so nifty, starting out so solid and hard and then becoming soft and luxurious once water had saturated the sponge...then go right back to solid again once you hang them to dry! Very cool!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like I said, this sponge is super duper soft and feels very nice...so I had very high hopes! I took my sponge and used circular motions on my face, once done my skin felt very clean, soft and just looked brighter as well. I experienced no redness or irritation, which was very much a delight to me!  Thinking it might be a fluke I have used it three more times still feeling skeptical, but I can safely say that no irritation has occurred and my skin is looking fabulous! I definitely think this sponge is a winner and a higher quality than other konjac sponges out there&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product at no cost to me and have provided my HONEST review in return.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know exactly what I was expecting, but I had read such great reviews on this product from other beauty blogs, and even here on amazon so I guess I was expecting it to perform miracles. I have oily skin prone to acne. In fact I break out all the time. After using this product, I don&#x27;t think it made any difference whatsoever. I was just confused. I don&#x27;t know, maybe if I kept buying it and using it for a longer period, it would have made a difference. I liked how soft it made my skin the first couple of days of using it though. Otherwise, I don&#x27;t&#x27; think the price is warranted.</li>
    <li> This is great size konjac sponge. I have tried different kinds of cleaning tools for my face like electric face brushes, loofah and towels, most of them left my cheek bones red and irritated. I also have tried and bought other konjac sponges before but the sizes are too small for me. With my Konjac sponge, I love how it cleanses my face. It is very gentle and doesn&#x27;t irritate my face. Once this sponge is soaked with water, it becomes super soft. Because the size is also bigger than the other konjac sponges, I feel like I am cleaning my face so much better. It has been a couple of weeks now and it is still holding up well. Every 3 days, I soak it in a hot boiled water for a few minutes just to sterilize it. The string comes in handy so it can easily hung after use. Overall, this is a really great sponge and now my new favorite cleaning tool. it is the softest and most gentle thing your can use on your face. I love it and I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I really like this sponge. I&#x27;m 67 and I notice it really helps with my aging skin. My pores are larger now, and the sponge really helps in cleaning my skin without irritating it. It feels good. I&#x27;m so glad I gave it a try!</li>
    <li> My second experience with the My Konjac Sponge and I love it. My skin feels clean and there is no irritation. I&#x27;ll definitely continue using this product.</li>
    <li> Konjac sponges are great! I use them everyday and my face has improved a lot because of its many beneffits</li>
    <li> I do like this sponge, but I don&#x27;t noticed a super significant difference in my skin like many other reviewers are commenting on. Wish the sponge was bigger, love the texture and the way it feels on my skin!</li>
    <li> I got this based on other reviews and I&#x27;m glad I did.  I&#x27;m still not sure how it works, but it works, and it works really well.  This sponge leaves my skin clear and smooth and not the least bit dry.  I have been using it without a cleanser, even though one could.  Does a great job of drawing out the black heads and other impurities, leaving the skin looking clear and healthy.  Get one and try it.</li>
    <li> I use this every morning and every other night…I switch with the Clarisonic at night.  I like using this more than just using my hands.  I switch between this and the pink clay and haven&#x27;t decided which I like better.  It lasts me about a month before I need a new one…it starts t break down and hurt around the sensitive skin around my eyes.  I have tried sterilizing but that doesn&#x27;t seem to help.  I do like using it though!</li>
    <li> Bought this one after reading all the reviews. After a week of using the Konjac, I notice that my skin is smoother with smaller spores and less oil. Also the price is acceptable with months of usage (or at least until the Konjac needs to be replaced).</li>
    <li> I have really been enjoying this!  It&#x27;s a physical exfoliant but it doesn&#x27;t feel like one. It come dry in the package and before you first use it you soak it in clean warm water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The texture is squishy and when you use it on your face it is very very gentle, so gentle you don&#x27;t think is doing anything - but it is!  I use it after I&#x27;ve cleaned my makeup off. It doesn&#x27;t dry your skin out and is in no way harsh- would be suitable for sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Make sure you follow the directions and gently squeeze out excess water and hang to dry between uses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will buy again</li>
    <li> Love these spoges!! My 13 year old daughter loves hers! Great product!</li>
    <li> Amazing results right from the get go!</li>
    <li> Sponge seems to help my very dry skin.  It is a bit slippery because of size and shape without soap on it, but I&#x27;m very happy with the results.  Plus it does not smell!  Nice product.</li>
    <li> My expectations were that this sponge would be good for exfoliation. It was not the texture I was expecting, it was too smooth. I hung it up in my bathroom (well ventilated) after each use, but it took it more like 24 hours to dry out. I felt that it might collect bacteria when it stayed so moist all the time. Otherwise it was very comfortable on my face and had no odor, left no residue.</li>
    <li> I like the Konjac sponge, but haven&#x27;t used it enough to notice a big difference in my cystic acne. I&#x27;m still having breakouts and my skin is still oily. I do like how clean my skin feels after I use it. So, I give it 4 star for now.</li>
    <li> very very good! i used it with dr bronner&#x27;s peppermint soap to wash face in the morning and at night. twice a day. it seems to be gentle enough not to cause any irritation. I noticed after a few days that the blackheads around T zone are reduced to very little. i had oily T zone, large pores and lots of blackheads. i didn&#x27;t expect this sponge could be so effective because i&#x27;ve tried so many things in the past: charcoal sugar scrub, bentonite clay, egg white mask, BHA 1%, chemical peels, ultrasonic facial brush, apple cider vinegar, tea tree oil, oil cleansing ... i was desperate and didn&#x27;t think anything could actually work. but this sponge seems to be working. i&#x27;ve only used it for a little over a week and i will keep using it and see if it is indeed my life changer ... keep my fingers crossed. this is my only hope for now. i will start PMD microdermabrasion soon and hope that will help with uneven skin tone etc.</li>
    <li> I purchased this on a whim based on a friend&#x27;s suggestion (and all the great reviews) and am very pleased! I&#x27;ve been using my sponge for almost two months now, fairly regularly, and my skin looks and feels much healthier than it has in years. It really helped unclog my pores and has made them much less noticeable, and also evened out my skin tone. I really like how gentle it was as I have sensitive skin. I would recommend this to anyone looking for a great facial product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is worth noting that because this sponge isn&#x27;t as abrasive as some others, it does take regular use to notice a true difference. This is in no way a complaint, but good to know if you are purchasing and hope to see a huge change after one use. ;) The only incident I did have, and am not sure if this is related to using the sponge or not, was that I had several break outs after I started to use it. I don&#x27;t have acne and rarely get a blemish, but had three or four within the first two weeks of using this. I continued to use the sponge and none have come back since those initial few appeared.</li>
    <li> I saw these types of sponges when I lived in Japan years and years ago, and not knowing how to read Japanese or properly use them (being embarrassed to even ask) I never tried them.  Fifteen years later a friend here in the US tells me she is using them and attributes them to her recent glowing and acne free skin.  We discussed how to use them and which to buy and where she found hers.  I live in a very rural area and decided to search Amazon.  I bought several and have been using them for a month now.  My skin has not looked and felt this good in years!  While this is no quick fix, it provides better long term results I feel with an all natural product that is earth friendly.  I definitely recommend this to others.</li>
    <li> At 50 I have the same oily skin issues I had as a teenager it seems. This bamboo charcoal sponge keeps my skin oil free for the day, better than the 100s of matte finish powders and foundations I&#x27;ve tried, this truly works. This is my second purchase, first sponge lasted about three months. Next I&#x27;ll try the French Green Clay Facial Sponge.  Highly recommend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Oct. 2014 update: Outstanding customer service after sponge 3 didn&#x27;t work as expected and sponge 4 disintegrated within a week. The FREE replacement sponges are as expected, still happy with the product. Customer Service explained a couple of lesser sponge batches caused the issues.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know if this is just too gentle for my oily easily clogged skin or not. I like using it but I don&#x27;t really feel very exfoliated. I might try the Boscia one to compare because so many people rave about these sponges but I am still feeling faithful to my clarisonic or dermalogica microfoliant</li>
    <li> I bought this mostly due to the glowing reviews around the internet and I have to say that this little sponge is extremely effective. I use it in combination with african black soap (that I purchased in the same order) and it&#x27;s gentler (and cheaper!) than my Clarisonic but my skin&#x27;s texture is so much nicer using this that I&#x27;ve all but abandoned the Clarisonic. I plan to buy these again in the future, especially because of how friendly the seller (whom I believe is also the creator of the product) is.</li>
    <li> After using this product for a while, I honestly don&#x27;t see how it&#x27;s anything special. Quite frankly, it&#x27;s just a regular facial sponge. It works well as a regular sponge, but considering all it promises, it doesn&#x27;t reach expectations. It&#x27;s way too mediocre for the price and the hype.</li>
    <li> great product love love love it</li>
    <li> RECENTLY I PURCHASED THESE WONDERFUL SPONGES FOR MY FACE... I HATE ROUGH CREAM EXFOLIATORS WITH SANDY OR ROUGH PARTICLES.... THESE SPONGES ARE WHAT I WAS LOOKING FOR FOR A LONG TIME... THEY CAN BE USED WITH OR WITHOUT CLEANSERS... YOU GET THE SPONGE WET AND SWIPE IT AROUND YOUR FACE AND NECK AND CHEST IN THE SHOWER OR OUT.... YOUR FACE IS CLEANSED AND EXFOLIATED AND SOFT... REMOVES BLACKHEADS NICELY... YOU RINSE THE SPONGE AND ALLOW IT TO DRY TILL THE NEXT TIME YOU CLEANSE...AND ITS MADE OF NATURAL PRODUCTS... I GAVE ONE TO MY 2 SONS AND THEIR GIRLS FRIENDS AND ONE TO MY HUBBY WHO LOVES IT AS WELL...</li>
    <li> For some reason I was under the impression that this sponge was going to gently exfoliate while in use. While dry it is stiff and hard almost as hard as a pumice stone (not something you should put on your face). Once wet it turns into a true sponge with a sort-of  squishy gel like consistancy, which is fine for rubbing on some face wash but I not for lifting away any dead skin cells. It sucks at taking off eyeshadow/mascara &amp; eyeliner.</li>
    <li> My skin is glowing! Much better than the clarisonic for everyday exfoliation, and makes my face cleanser last 3X longer because I only need to use a tiny amount.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for a week now, and I have definitely noticed a difference in my skin tone and texture.  At first, I was worried that the sponge would be too harsh for facial skin, but, as other reviewers have noted, it feels very soft when wet--almost like an exfoliating washcloth.  I am very happy with the improvement in my face&#x27;s look and feel.  And it dries rather quickly-in fact, I packed it for the weekend, and it was completely dried out overnight to put in my suitcase.  Good purchase!</li>
    <li> It is useful as it described.</li>
    <li> These sponges help to keep my skin clear and clean!  They are super gentle but effective and way less money than a clarisonic.</li>
    <li> The sponges I bought were gifts for my two daughters - in - law and teenage granddaughter. They love them and feel their skin is so much healthier, smooth and bright. They say you will see results after one week! Needless to say, I now got one for myself!</li>
    <li> I saw this konjac sponge in Allure magazine, and since I was looking for a mild exfoliator for my face I decided to give it a try.  It&#x27;s great!  Gentle enough to use daily on my sensitive skin.  You can use it with your regular cleanser or by itself with warm water.  And it&#x27;s a great price compared to a few other konjac sponges I considered.  I would definitely recommend this product!</li>
    <li> Grand daughter love them</li>
    <li> Saw no difference in blackheads or evenness of skin. I prefer my clairsonic brush.</li>
    <li> I have both the original konjac sponge and the charcoal and both work amazingly well! I have to admit though, the charcoal version helps a lot with blackheads and other annoying skin issues--My face looks so much brighter and healthier after I started using this product. I used to use the Aveeno exfoliating pads, but the &amp;#34;my konjac sponge&amp;#34; out performs them by A LOT. When you first use this thing you are left thinking, &amp;#34;How can something so soft exfoliate my skin?&amp;#34; and I have to admit, I was really skeptical when I first purchased one of these. However, after the very first use, I was sold. This works so, so well. My skin is so soft and clean after using this thing. It&#x27;s a miracle product :). It&#x27;s virtually eliminated any problem areas on my face. When I first started using it, I coupled it with my face wash, but at this point . . . I use my face wash, wash that off and then exfoliate with the sponge. This has been the most successful pattern of use for me. But I know a lot of people use it WITH their face wash, so --it&#x27;s really up to preference :).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love, love, love it! Would highly recommend to anyone looking for a quality, effective, exfoliating product.</li>
    <li> AMAZING! I absolutely love this product! Excellent fast shipping! Thanks so much!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s easy to use, comfortable, but, nothing special.</li>
    <li> I came across an article one day that talked about konjac sponges, what they were and how good they supposedly were for your face. I had never heard of them until I read this article and I was intrigued. I came on Amazon to see how much and at $10, I figured it was worth a try. Plus, I had some giftcard money, so even better, it was free to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The sponge was bigger than i was expecting, and pretty hard, but I figured it would soften up once I got it wet. I honestly wasn&#x27;t sure what kind of results to expect - typically when I try new beauty products, especially ones people rave about, I never seem to have the same kind of amazing experience everyone else had. So I guess naturally, I was kind of skeptical about this thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I got the sponge wet, put some of my cleanser on it and washed my face for the first time....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well...consider this skeptic converted!! First and foremost, the thing feels amazing on my skin. It&#x27;s like rubbing my face with a cloud...a kind of wet, sort of gel-like cloud. It exfoliates, but very gently - you don&#x27;t have to use a lot of pressure when using it. Secondly - the thing that really shocked me was that I was able to see a difference in my skin right away - it was brighter, softer and was practically glowing. I also noticed that it helped with my pores too - my pores are pretty large and obvious, but this sponge has helped make them look a bit less noticeable. I&#x27;ve been using it pretty regularly for the last two weeks and my skin looks awesome. It&#x27;s definitely a welcome addition to my beauty routine!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So take it from a fairly skeptical person when I say that this actually works. So many things claim to do this or that, but this one actually does. And it&#x27;s inexpensive to boot! I can&#x27;t wait to try some of the other sponges too....I&#x27;m definitely hooked on this thing now...</li>
    <li> This sponge is so much more than I ever imagined!!  I love the fact it creates great lather with very little product and I find it to be the best facial sponge I&#x27;ve ever used!!!</li>
    <li> I did not notice any AMAZING skin results like other reviewers.  Actually did not notice a decrease or change in my acne at all.  But I do like using it as a gentle exfoliator on the skin.</li>
    <li> The charcoal has seemed to really helped compared to the plain one I used previously and the quality is great and much cheaper than the ones at saphora. Just make sure you let it get completely dry in between uses so you might have to keep it out of bathroom.</li>
    <li> This sponge fell apart after 1 week:(</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t do anything special. You can use a wash cloth and save your money</li>
    <li> I am a huge fan of Konjac sponges and this is no exception. I have used quite a few sponges (some charcoal, some original) and this one is one of my favorites. It&#x27;s large enough that you can keep it in your hand and clean your face without any issues. Occasionally, it&#x27;ll try to yank my nose ring out but that&#x27;s just because I&#x27;m not paying attention. It is a sponge. I typically use it to rinse of my face masks or to just exfoliate in the morning and it makes my face super soft and clean. I love that this one has a little string so you can hang it from your shower caddy to dry. If you are looking for a sponge for your bathroom, this is the one!</li>
    <li> I like that the MY Knojac sponge products are never tested on animals and is 100% natural and biodegradable. You can use the sponge with or without cleanser though my face felt the cleanest when using it with a cleanser. You can save a lot of money on cleansers since you only need a fraction of what you would normally use since the sponge makes the facial cleansers lather better than if you were using your hands or a face cloth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin has appeared much brighter and I am getting fewer pimples from using this sponge. The sponge deep cleanses better than when I was using my hands and gets into the nooks and cranny&#x27;s (like around your nose) that I may otherwise miss. The sponge is reusable, just rinse and squeeze the moisture out after each use (do not ring it out as it may damage the sponge) and lay flat or hang to dry. The sponge should however be replaced every couple months.</li>
    <li> I was very excited to use my konjac sponge after the great review I watched from Genevieve Mama Natural. It took 4 days (FOUR DAYS!) for the deep cleansing bamboo charcoal to clear up the acne I had, and close up my pores. Now my skin a perfectly balanced clean &amp; hydrated. I love using the sponge every morning and night because it&#x27;s gentle but it still works. I don&#x27;t use any cleanser or soap, so the money I&#x27;ll save with only having to replace it every three months or so is great. Lovely product, I&#x27;d recommend it to anyone - and I&#x27;m stocking up for Christmas gifts!</li>
    <li> Great product. Gently exfoliates without drying out skin.</li>
    <li> A great little sponge, works nicely and is gentle on my skin. Would recommend to anyone with oily and or dry skin.</li>
    <li> Received my package on time. The sponge is good for exfoliating my skin. I have noticed that the little whiteheads around my nose andy chin are gone. I&#x27;ve only used it for a week so I hope to see my changes with prolonged use. I&#x27;m trying to get away from harsh chemicals so I plan on ordering again in the future. I&#x27;m even considering the body size sponges.</li>
    <li> Very soft and so far no breakouts!</li>
    <li> This is a high-quality and skincare staple in my bathroom. I replace the sponge every few months for sanitary reasons. I appreciate the seller&#x27;s quick delivery -- I got the products earlier than I expected.</li>
    <li> I really do like the sponge, it&#x27;s much better and gentler on my face than the oscillating brush I&#x27;d been using until recently. The only real issue I have is with how quickly it dissolves. I read that was an issue, but I was still a bit surprised. With twice a day use, you&#x27;re not going to get even a month out of the sponge before it&#x27;s down to a nub. I&#x27;ve read that it lasts longer if you really go out of your way to clean it, dry it, and keep it out of the shower--but it&#x27;s really hard to spend that kind of time, particularly in the morning. That being said, it&#x27;s very affordable (especially with Amazon prime free shipping) and I suppose it&#x27;s not unreasonable to have to replace something you wash your face with that often. I was also pleased to receive an email from the company, asking for my feedback on the product and even providing a personal number, should I have required it. Ultimately, I think this is a pretty good product and would definitely recommend giving it a try.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s absolutely wonderful!!! My daughter took it from me on the first day and now I have to order another one....&lt;br /&gt;Feels amazing on the skin and clears it up immediately leaving glowing skin.</li>
    <li> I like this product. I did however experience some breakouts after using this product, but i do love this. I feel that it cleaned my face great. I did receive this product for review purposes.</li>
    <li> I have used several konjac sponges in the past, and this one is by far the worst. I had high expectations after reading its reviews, and hoped that it would be longer lasting than other sponges I&#x27;ve had.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first time I used it, it was great, and the second time too. After that, (and I never wrung it out, I hung it to dry after each use) the sponge developed a large hole on both sides and started tearing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like konjac for cleaning my face, it is a gentle yet effective exfoliant. However, this one has been a disappointment in that it lost its soft and springy texture very quickly, and broke down after a few uses. I would recommend trying a different brand if you want to try a konjac sponge.</li>
    <li> I am not sure why I love it but I do.  It just  feels good to use. My first was the round black charcoal sponge.&lt;br /&gt; My second is the red bamboo.&lt;br /&gt; I prefer its larger size  but for some reason I like the first one more. Not sure of the difference.</li>
    <li> I used this for a while left skin clear and clean. Notable difference in skin condition but unclear if it was due to the combination i was using at the time but both me and my wife have reordered this. Generally speaking anything my wife repeat orders has merit as she&#x27;s really fussy about beauty stuff.</li>
    <li> these sponges are so cute and soft and make me very happy.</li>
    <li> The Konjac Sponge is my favorite beauty tool. I use this with just water and with a variety of all natural face wash. The sponge gives just the right amount of exfoliation. I love it!</li>
    <li> Great sponge, I switched to another sponge brand and what a mistake that was. I will order this brand from now on. No smell like other sponges and feels great to touch.</li>
    <li> Love this sponge! I have a skin routine (mix of Cerave and Paula&#x27;s Choice products) I&#x27;ve been happy with, but I heard great things about these konjac sponges that I had to try it out. Once you wet the sponge it is super soft and not abrasive at all. First use and my skin felt super clean, without being dry. 2 weeks in, my skin feels softer and less oily later in the day. Very happy and will keep this a part of my routine and purchase as gifts for my friends!</li>
    <li> Didnt work for me like all the rave reviews I read, but overall its a good sponge.</li>
    <li> Works great on my son&#x27;s face but definitely needs to be hung up to dry after every use and only lasts about 4 weeks.</li>
    <li> This is my first time using a konjac sponge, and I&#x27;m happy to say that I really like the product. I used an exfoliating sponge on my face for years and I&#x27;d always end up breaking out with fresh sponges because they were too abrasive. The konjac sponge is much softer, and while the packaging says it exfoliates, I don&#x27;t believe it. That said, I was looking for a softer alternative and this is exactly what I wanted. I look forward to trying some of the other colors to see their effects on my complexion.</li>
    <li> Leaves a clean fresh feeling every time. Nice size. Rinsed easily. Would order again</li>
    <li> Simply amazing! Feels amazing on my face, exfoliates my face, and helps with redness.</li>
    <li> I love this sponge because it helped to naturally clear my skin. It has a string on it to hang it up, and It is also made of a material that doesn&#x27;t harvest bacteria. I use it with my cleanser, and it works great.</li>
    <li> This is the BEST sponge ever!  I have adult acne , been using this konjac sponge it has cleared my face up within a few days. Amazing results from this sponge. Nor does it shred to pieces like most sponges. I&#x27;ve been the konjac sponge for 2 weeks twice a day still like brand new. Just make sure to rinse it well. And that&#x27;s it :-)</li>
    <li> Been using this for a week now and so far I love this sponge. It reminds me of those cute sweet sponge-like rice cakes.  It&#x27;s foamy, perfect for my charcoal bar soap, and easy to clean &amp; care for. I rinse it in hot water before each use for about a minute, next I gently squeeze it between my palm so it&#x27;s not too watery then I rub it against my soap bar until it suds up a bit, and I cleanse my face with it in circular scrubbing motions. When I&#x27;m ready to wash my face, I wash out the sponge in warm water to get the suds out and now that it&#x27;s wet I use it to wash/wipe the soapy lather off my face then I towel dry my face and rinse my sponge in hot water, gently squeeze out the excess water, and hang my sponge up to dry on a hook in the shower. Awesome thing is the floor by the sink is not wet from splashing/washing my face like how it would be if I used my bare hands. I also don&#x27;t get water running down my sleeves. Love it! Would definitely order again in a few months. It&#x27;s so gentle and cleansing on my sensitive acne-prone skin that I can use it daily. I definitely prefer it over wash cloths (because they don&#x27;t sud as well) &amp; power brushes (because they feel too harsh when I get painful cystic acne or scabs).</li>
    <li> One of the best konjac sponges out there! Love that it&#x27;s all natural and available so readily on Amazon. I had the pink one from the same company but decided to try this one out for my recent acne troubles and it has really helped! I keep mine propped up sideways on a small dish so that it can dry completely between uses to avoid bacteria and it only takes about 10-25 seconds to turn back into a sponge after drying up. I don&#x27;t hang it because I&#x27;ve heard the string can rip through the sponge but if you wring it out completely before hanging it up I don&#x27;t see why there would be a problem.</li>
    <li> Sponge started to disintegrate after only a couple weeks of use. Not worth it, unless the quality, and durability of the product improves.</li>
    <li> Very soft once wet, easy to use.</li>
    <li> I really like this sponge. I have sensitive skin and I find it less abrasive then a loofah or a wash cloth and It cleans very well.</li>
    <li> sponge is fine, but it is so small that it is not very useful. Also, the string is like a piece of floss and has already ripped</li>
    <li> I love this sponge!  It softens up so nicely and is so soft and gentle on my face!!  Great for post-surgical use!  I&#x27;m ordering some for my friends for Christmas!</li>
    <li> Quick Take: feels amazing, easy to use&lt;br /&gt;Sometimes you love things you don&#x27;t understand. This weird little sponge is one of those things.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know why this sponge feels so delicious against my skin. I don&#x27;t know how it&#x27;s so versatile, letting you get right up into your pores for a deep clean, or just sweeping softly over your skin to freshen up. I definitely don&#x27;t know how it&#x27;s managed to keep my blackheads even SLIGHTLY under control,* which two years of using my Clarisonic have failed to do. And I have no idea how this thing I bought on a whim managed to become one of my favorite cleansing products.&lt;br /&gt;But what can I tell you? I love this thing. It&#x27;s ideal for travel (wring it out in a washcloth and zap it with your hairdryer if it&#x27;s really sopping wet) and it just feels amazing on your skin.&lt;br /&gt;The black sponge is a true black horse. Try it.&lt;br /&gt;* Don&#x27;t get me wrong, I still have blackheads. But the sponge does seem to help me from getting MORE blackheads than I have accepted as my lot in life, so I&#x27;m counting that as a benefit.</li>
    <li> Very nifty little sponge. I&#x27;m not the kind of person who buys every pricey beauty item out there (maybe I should start?) but when it came to getting a pack of cheapo washcloths or &amp;#34;splurging&amp;#34; on an experimental Konjac sponge, it was a no-brainer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have oily, nasty skin with tons of residual acne scarring and the occasional breakout (even now at 25). Sponge immediately left my skin feeling softly exfoliated without any roughness. 4 stars for now while I use it for a week, and I&#x27;ll update with longer-term results soon.</li>
    <li> Fabulous product! This is so gentle on my face but cleans really well. I would absolutely recommend this product to anyone. The seller shipped lightening fast!</li>
    <li> Unfortunately, using this sponge caused my skin to become more oily than usual, so I had to discontinue using it. I liked how it made my face feel smooth, but the oily skin was a recipe for disaster. My face hasn&#x27;t quite recovered even after I stopped using it. Hopefully it can balance out again. I suspect that the charcoal removes too much of the natural skin oils, and so my skin overcompensated by producing more oil. I don&#x27;t recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I expected gentle exfoliation from this sponge; once it&#x27;s wet, it becomes almost slimy and definitely doesn&#x27;t exfoliate. I didn&#x27;t see any improvement in my skin, so I stopped using it.</li>
    <li> I love this thing. It feels great on my face.</li>
    <li> This is a great product!&lt;br /&gt;My face feels very clean&amp; smooth after I used the Konjac sponge.</li>
    <li> Great product! Cleans naturally and doesn&#x27;t dry out skin!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never had any product that works like this before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My brother has suffered from very bad acne for many years to the point that some became cystic. He became very insecure because his face is literally plagued with acne. He maintains very good hygiene and he visits the dermatologist regularly. However, none of those options helped and his acne just got worse as time passes by. I, myself, suffer from acne but only a few zits here and there but big large ones. Both of us have very oily skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, I was looking for remedies that actually work and I stumbled upon this. I bought one for my brother to use and after a week of usage, I can see his skin looking better, cleaner, brighter. He reported of less acne popping out, and some acne scars he had are slowly fading away. It&#x27;s actually working!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, I decided to buy one for myself too. It has been two weeks since I&#x27;ve used the product and all I can say are just good things! My face has gotten brighter and smoother. I haven&#x27;t had any single pimple ever since and my blackheads are clearing away too. The scrub is not that harsh so it&#x27;s okay to use daily. I use it once a day because I&#x27;m just being cautious and I don&#x27;t want my skin to dry out completely. And good news for those who have oily skin out there! It helps in keeping my face less oily, one of the main things why I love the sponge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I could still say a lot of good things about this product but you all know got the point. TOTALLY RECOMMENDED. I WOULD BUY THIS FOREVER.</li>
    <li> Size:  At first, I was confused about how it shrank after the first time I used it. But, I realized that I actually have to soak it longer to make the sponge back to its original size. The sponge has a fairly good size, easy to hold when washing your face.    Texture:  The sponge has a \\&quot;slimy\\&quot;/\\&quot;Smooth\\&quot; texture. Some people might not like it, but I think it&#x27;s fine.    Cleaning:  I love how the sponge cleans up my oily face and gives a freshness to my skin. :) It works great!    Outbreaks:  It helps to prevent acne outbreak (at least for me). I didn&#x27;t have any outbreak so far even since I used this (maybe about 4 months). Of course, there are a lot of other factors that create pimples and outbreaks. But, this sponge does help in a way.    Overall:  Great product! Will give other sponges a try in the future!</li>
    <li> Not what I expected. I used it in the shower with cleanser. Did not feel the softness people have reported. Then used a toner to see what was not picked up and was disappointed, dirty cotton ball. Clarisonic is better.</li>
    <li> I used to have very textured, oily, large pore-ed skin. After using this sponge for 2 weeks, my face is significantly smoother. In some areas I don&#x27;t see any pores at all. I would definitely recommend using this product if used appropriately. I would also recommend getting 2 at one time and switching off, as the sponge doesn&#x27;t ever dry out fully if used twice a day.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s great -- my face feels really clean after using -- will purchase again -</li>
    <li> Love this item. My face appears so much fresher. I will be reordering again in the near future</li>
    <li> Amazing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have hard core acne, the cyst causing kind, and this handled it. It is clearly just for face, it didn&#x27;t clear any under-chin, neck or chest acnes, but my face is Completely clear!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not sure exactly what I was expecting. I thought it would be rough, even though it&#x27;s a sponge. When you get it wet it becomes completely soft and it&#x27;s like rubbing a somewhat slimy wet cotton ball over your face. It doesn&#x27;t leave your face gross (though you still rinse it off), doesn&#x27;t foam and doesn&#x27;t irritate in any way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This does not clear blackheads (nor does it claim too) ... My nose is usually dry with blackheads whereas my cheeks are acne, it doesn&#x27;t dry out your dry parts. When the acne is clear though you will notice the blackheads more.... I&#x27;m going check their other sponges and maybe do one at night and one during the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will NEVER use abusive products like clearasil again!</li>
    <li> This sponge makes my skin feel so smooth but, does not irritate.  Best facial cleaner ever!</li>
    <li> I used my last sponge for a year before replacing it.&lt;br /&gt;It has a lovely texture and I use it every day.</li>
    <li> I really like this sponge.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it works exactly, but it exfoliates ok.</li>
    <li> I wanted something the would gently exfoliate my skin and was tired of buying or making exfoliating scrubs. I don&#x27;t know how well this works in terms of exfoliating already dry, flaky skin, though. The first few times I&#x27;ve used it, the difference was minimal. However, this gently scrubbed away the blackheads on my nose with the first use! I was shocked! This immediately brightened my overall complexion as a result. I will continue using it just for that fact.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this for a little over a week and there are no signs of wear and tear. I make sure to hang it up to dry to keep mold from growing.</li>
    <li> Feels really good on your face, not too rough or too soft. Needs minimal face wash to get the job done.</li>
    <li> Solid product.  Lathers great, but had hoped it would be a little rougher.</li>
    <li> This just seemed like a sponge to me. I felt like just using my kitchen sponge would do the same thing.</li>
    <li> Exactly as I expected. Great product!</li>
    <li> it is ok.  Can&#x27;t rate something that needs months to work, even then how do you measure?  It feels great on your skin, but does it really exfoliate? It is so soft....~!</li>
    <li> Leaves your face feeling very smooth and clean with no chemicals</li>
    <li> Works amazingly well!!! Use with any mild soap and now I have not break outs. Will out some raw honey on my face after when I have it which also helps. I leave it on while I shower the rest of my body and then rinse off.</li>
    <li> Wow! I&#x27;ve always been slightly skeptical of &#x27;facial scrubs&#x27; but this one is gentle on the skin. Time will tell if it indeed works. But so far, so good.  Great Product! Great Service! Great Amazon Seller!</li>
    <li> don&#x27;t bother. bought two, one for me and one for my 18 y/o. found his in the trash and mine? I use it only because it was $10. So I have a rather expensive sponge to wash my face (which I usually used my fingers/hands).</li>
    <li> I was really excited at the thought of using this when I travel instead of lugging my MIA along, so I tested it out at home for a week.  I thoroughly rinsed it out after each use and used the short, almost totally useless string to hang it up to dry.  It was not easy to find something to hang it off of in the bathroom, short of shoving a push pin into your wall, which I did not want to do.  Anyway, I eventually found a spot.  As for using it, it felt just ok on my skin.  The texture was a bit strange, almost slimy feeling.  Definitely worked well enough to clean my face, but it didn&#x27;t feel like it was exfoliating.  It would dry well enough between uses (morning and night), but not all the way.  After a couple days I noticed a really strange smell, sort of like feet...but not my own!  It did not take long to figure out it was this sponge.  Of course I assumed that meant I wasn&#x27;t rinsing it well enough, so I rinsed and squeezed it out even more excessively after every use.  It still got smelly.  To me, bad smells equate to bacteria or mold, the last thing I want to smear on my face.  Threw it away.</li>
    <li> I bought this on a whim and have been very happy with it. My skin is SO soft after using it! I did not find that I could stop using face wash. I wash first with my normal soap and then I use this to exfoliate my face before a final rinse. The sponge dries quickly overnight when left out on a counter. I will probably be keeping one of these on hand going forward.</li>
</ol>
