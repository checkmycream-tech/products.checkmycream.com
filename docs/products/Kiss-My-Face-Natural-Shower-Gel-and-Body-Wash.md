      <li>I end up using more than I probably need because I feel like I am not getting clean.  </li>
      <li>The amazing pine scent is what sold me on this product when I first smelled it in the store.</li>
      <li>It has a really pleasant pine smell, lathers nicely, and doesnt leave your skin dry.  </li>

      <li>Contains wonderful natural ingredients like Aloe, plant extracts and natural oils.</li>
      <li>I find it lathers just great for one person, so I enjoy not taking an extra 5 minutes every day to try and get all the soap out of my loofa.  </li>
      <li>Perfect for both men and women, young and old.</li>
      <li>For that kind of bottle you really do have to make room on a shelve.</li>
      <li>This is great soap, the only thing is that it smellsl ike a Christmas tree.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;d think the lid of this bottle should be taped securely in place for transit?  </li>
      <li>If you are looking for paraben free products, try \\&quot;Yes to</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s also free of a lot of the harmful chemicals they like to sneak into everything now-a-days.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> nice product, my only issue has been with the pump.  Every time you press down to dispense, it leaks a lot from the base of the opening, where the cap screws on.  Im sure its just a one time thing... I have it on subscribe and save, so we&#x27;ll see if it happens again...</li>
    <li> The only reason I rate this product a 3 star is because of the smell.  Now, if you like pine candles and smelling like pine, then this is a great product.  It smells just like a pine tree! For me, however, this is not that great.  I was thinking it wouldn&#x27;t smell so much like pine, and more like lavender, but it is pretty pungent at first.  This smell does not stick around all day, so I am okay with continuing to use it.  I find it lathers just great for one person, so I enjoy not taking an extra 5 minutes every day to try and get all the soap out of my loofa.  I would recommend this product if you like the smell of pine.</li>
    <li> I wanted the scent of pine and finally found it.&lt;br /&gt;This is very nice and rinses off easily without being so moisturizing (I can do that by myself if I want it).</li>
    <li> Prefer to use natural items as much as possible. The scent is refreshing. Excellent buy.</li>
    <li> Big and a little too easy to use</li>
    <li> There seems to be a little inconsistency with this product, as suggested in other reviews.  We bought this after using at a friends house, where it&#x27;s had a great smell.  The product we received doesn&#x27;t smell nearly as much, which was our entire reason for buying it.</li>
    <li> Got this soap for my husband.  He says he likes it and both he and I love the scent (although I would not use it because the smell is a bit too manly for me).  It has a woodsy mountain smell and it seems to moisturize your skin without being greasy/oily.  We need soaps that moisturize because we live in the low desert of So. Calif. and it is dry out here.  Overall good soap.</li>
    <li> This shower gel smells great &amp; works well with my sensitive skin.  I have to use a little more for a good lather but I don&#x27;t mind and I love that it has a pump.  We use for the whole family.</li>
    <li> This is a fantastic shower gel. Does not contain SLS, Parabens, Petrolatum, Mineral oil - now THAT is hard to find - these toxic chemicals are pervasive in almost all cosmetic products these days. Contains wonderful natural ingredients like Aloe, plant extracts and natural oils. I have tried scores of shower gels (including designer ones like Armani, Burberry, YSL). Some clean exceptionally well, some smell exquisite BUT this is the one I found to be the best for skin. In spite of not containing the surfactant Sodium Lauryl Sulfate (or Sodium Laureth Sulfate or Ammonium Lauryl sulfate) - this cleans wonderfully. Most importantly this leaves the skin feeling healthy, cared for and detoxed. The smell is of natural Pine and so this is not for people who are looking for heavily scented cologne like fragrance from a shower gel. If skin health is a prime concern when choosing a shower gel than this is the best I have come across. HOWEVER, this particular money saver 32 OZ pack, for some reason has the contents extremely watery as compared to the regular 16 Oz packs available here and at health stores like Wholefoods. So I returned the 32 Oz bottle and went back to the 16 Oz bottle. Apart from this, this Gel is one of the best you will find if you are looking for a green (environment friendly), natural, effective and safe skin care product&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE and CAVEAT - 29th May 2016 - The formula for this product has changed since this review was written. The new formulation evidently has more artificial ingredients and lesser of the beneficial natural ingredients than the original. I have not tried the new formula</li>
    <li> The amazing pine scent is what sold me on this product when I first smelled it in the store. The bottle is huge, so it lasts a long time. The body wash is moisturizing, refreshing and leaves my sensitive skin soft and smooth. Since I try to avoid body washes with chemical ingredients or perfumes, I like that this one has no sulfates, phthalates, artificial fragrances or animal testing. When I use it, the pine and ginseng scent isn&#x27;t as strong as when I smelled it in the bottle, but it&#x27;s still a nice, natural, aromatherapy wash for the bath or shower.</li>
    <li> The product isn&#x27;t bad, but the smell of it was not as expected. It has a very heavy pine scent - not like you are in a forest, but the pine scent of a kitchen cleaning prodcut. I obviously expected a scent, but not one quite so heavy.</li>
    <li> A very nice soap with a great fragrence. Gentle on the skin and with a bottle this size it should last you a while too. Give it a try for sure!</li>
    <li> Awesome product! I love all the Kiss My Face products.  So hard to find products without dyes SLS and other toxins.  This line rocks! Smells awesome and leaves skin soft.  Safe for the environment.</li>
    <li> Kiss my face shower gel does not break my skin out. I have very sensitive skin and it makes it feel smooth and not tight or dry like most shower gels. I have this scent and the kind that has an &amp;#34;athletic&amp;#34; sort of smell. While I prefer that scent more, this one is not that bad.</li>
    <li> I love this shower gel!  it smells great and rinses off completely.  I used to use creamy shower cleansers - but they left a film on my skin which showed up as a white &amp;#34;ring around the collar&amp;#34; on my blouses.</li>
    <li> Smells so good and makes a great bubble bath! Though I love the product this is the second time I received the order and it has leaked every where. I am canceling my subscription because of this.</li>
    <li> great for the soul :D this is the best anti stress KMF makes, in my opinion. Price point is excellent for the volume! I;m considering joining the automatic delivery club for this item :D Thanks for making it available!</li>
    <li> The gel itself isn&#x27;t bad but I wasn&#x27;t a fan of the smell. Kind of was too masculine for my taste. Lather was great and knowing it&#x27;s all natural and good for the environment helps! LOVE this company though.</li>
    <li> I love this soap! It smells wonderful and feels good. I have really sensitive skin and this soap does not irritate me at all. I also love the pump. It keeps me and my family from wasting it by using too much.</li>
    <li> The concept of all natural is appealing...I always hate reading ingredients that I can&#x27;t even pronounce.  Unfortunately I have found find Kiss My Face products so hit or miss.  I just got this along with a few other of their products.  Smell is subjective and many have indicated they love it....well if you love moldy smelling pine!  That is all I smelled.  It was like they got a good deal on pine cones that were going rotten.  I tried to get my wife to take it so it wouldn&#x27;t go to waste but she said she would pass.  I suppose that is for the best anyway in terms of our love life!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also I found it was not concentrated.  Took me about 15 pushes before I had enough to make any kind of lather on my bath sponge.  It did not seem to have any of the moisturizers that sounded so good.  Back to Dove for now.</li>
    <li> Smells good! I love Kiss My Face products. No bad stuff. I feel the stress rinsing down the drain when I use this stuff. Thanks KMF!</li>
    <li> It arrived half spilled in the inside of the shipping bag.  It works ok but not good when 30% is gone.</li>
    <li> I *love* Kiss My Face bath gel, but I&#x27;d given up buying it in the small size available at my local market for both price and environmental reasons. This large dispenser lasts a long while and costs much less per ounce than the version available closer to home. I&#x27;m grateful to have the luxury without the guilt and expense.</li>
    <li> Kiss my face makes some good stuff and they are less harmful than regular shower gels, this one smells great, good foam and keeps you clean. Gotta love it.</li>
    <li> This is great soap, the only thing is that it smellsl ike a Christmas tree.  I have not made up my mind if I love it or hate it yet, but the soap itself is awesome.</li>
    <li> I chose this because it is natural and oh, so, gentle for my skin.  If I have a scrape, it doesn&#x27;t irritate and it cleans well.  It works great, especially if you have eczema or skin sensitivities to chemicals in other cleaning products.  I also used it on my hair but as with all natural products, your hair may tend to feel a bit dry.  This huge bottle lasted me a long time which was more bang for the buck.</li>
    <li> Love the bath gel but the pump broke after about a week of normal use.  Have had this problem with a pump on sunblock from the same company.  Irritating.</li>
    <li> The wash itself is fine, but I find the scent masculine and not particularly relaxing.  It&#x27;s a great size and value.</li>
    <li> Nice scent and easy to use.</li>
    <li> This smells like the Adirondack woods and makes me feel good.  The moisturizing is wonderful - it keeps my elbows smooth without making me feel greasy.  Perfect for both men and women, young and old.</li>
    <li> My husband has sensitive, dry, itchy skin and had tried various brands of shower gels.  This has been the best and the dry, itchy skin is gone!</li>
    <li> Great product and cheaper than Whole Foods!</li>
    <li> The soap is nice but the only drawback is the pump on the bottle should be better able to dispense more soap with one pump versus several pumps to get what I want.</li>
    <li> Not somuch a stress reliever but left my skin feeling nice and softer.</li>
    <li> I like the soap but the dispenser barely works.</li>
    <li> This is good stuff. It has a really pleasant pine smell, lathers nicely, and doesnt leave your skin dry.  I feel super clean after I use this.</li>
    <li> Even though this is a large container, it is not watered down, it foams up great and has a very nice scent, works for men and women, because it has the spruce scent.</li>
    <li> It got you clean but it smelled like you were bathing in a pine forrest.</li>
    <li> I like the concept of the body wash, but it falls short in a few areas.  The wash is thicker, clear and feels good on your skin in the shower and afterwards. Here in the winter, my skin becomes very dry and this does a good job hydrating the skin(aloe is one of the first ingredients).  Things for me that are goof also include natural, no parabens and cleaning power. Bad things are cost for bottle, the smell(too medicinal for me, smells like unwashed old people) and the size of the bottle( does not fit my shower anywhere!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Decent but not great.</li>
    <li> This products maine problem is it does not create suds well.  need 4 pumps worth of product to get clean.</li>
    <li> i like the scent and the feel on my skin. it&#x27;s refreshing. i use it in my hair too and it leaves it soft (i have buzz cut).  i wish it had more lather.  i feel i have to use alot to get a good sudsy lather.  i like the product but next time i will prob try something else. good price and fast shipping.</li>
    <li> I love the smell of this shower gel. My whole family uses it.  It is calming and relaxing and has a nice outdoorsy scent.  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> My favourite shower gel. It smells awesome, I feel squeaky clean and moist with no excessive suds.</li>
    <li> Skin is our largest organ - skin takes on all the impurities of industrial chemicals.  Taking a shower and still feeling &amp;#34;heavy&amp;#34; or smothered is a result of putting unnatural chemicals on skin.  Not an organic certified product, but certainly pure and devoid of industrial waste like sodium laureth sulfate and a herd of other surficants and stippers that belong in a body shop for automobiles and not on sensitive human skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For a lasting, refreshing cleanse try this product.</li>
    <li> Firstly, it arrived leaking, so soap was all over the inside of the bag, I had to wash the bottle, so I lost a few ounces off the bat. Kiss My Face is typically a great brand, but I don&#x27;t like how this gel didn&#x27;t lather better, which added to my stress. But it smells wonderful :) so much that my roommate used it regularly too.</li>
    <li> I like the smell of this shower gel but it was \\&quot;disappearing\\&quot; very fast. I know that products without \\&quot;bad\\&quot; chemicals don&#x27;t foam up like other shampoos but this one is almost gone and it&#x27;s only been couple of weeks since I bought 32 ounce bottle. I have used \\&quot;Yes to Carrots\\&quot; shower gel for a while now so I am just going to use it again. I was simply curious about other products and unfortunately, I wasn&#x27;t too impressed with this one. If you are looking for paraben free products, try \\&quot;Yes to Carrots\\&quot;, \\&quot;Yes to Tomatoes\\&quot; or \\&quot;Yes to Cucumbers\\&quot;, those are really great, both as shampoos and bath gels.</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive skin, so I always have to check labels. I love that this body wash doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin. I love the pine scent.</li>
    <li> I prefer a soap that suds up a bit.  I end up using more than I probably need because I feel like I am not getting clean.  Smell is great though.</li>
    <li> smells good and doesn&#x27;t make me break out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Must try this stuff. it has a great pine smell to it.</li>
    <li> Love the smell.  It doesn&#x27;t lather as well as other soaps, but I&#x27;m happy since it&#x27;s all natural ingredients and the amount you get, it will last for months.</li>
    <li> Has an invigorating &amp;#34;wake me up&amp;#34; scent.</li>
    <li> a gift for someone else, she liked it.</li>
    <li> My husband uses a lot of this with his net scrubby, it is mild and love the larger size and pump</li>
    <li> stinks stinks stinks...did I mention it stinks. this smells NOTHING like the shower gel we bought in the same scent at our local store. it smells like someone poured pine sol in the bottle but worse. gag</li>
    <li> The gel itself isn&#x27;t bad but I don&#x27;t like the smell of it.  Very medicine-like smell.  I won&#x27;t be purchasing this particular item again.</li>
    <li> I used to refuse to believe that shower gel could make you feel better, as well as making you clean. No longer. This fragrant gel does it all.</li>
    <li> Good quality shower gel.  Has a woodsy pine scent that permeates the bathroom when used - great for guys.  The scent does not linger and your skin will smell natural afterwards.  You won&#x27;t smell like a forest.  My skin does well with this product, but you will run through it fast because its consistency is a little runny by nature.  Obviously, does not suds up due to the lack of certain ingredients that cause skin irritation / cancer.  Would buy again.</li>
    <li> As a person with a lot of stress and anxiety and headaches, this is a miracle bath and shower gel. I grew up on a farm in WI and there are a lot of pine trees in the area. I find it&#x27;s a relaxing scent because I always liked that fresh outdoor woodsy smell, though if you don&#x27;t like pine or fir scent you probably won&#x27;t like it. To me, it smells refreshing and has a bit of the menthol-like feel when you breathe it in. It opens up your sinuses and helps relax your muscles. It&#x27;s also free of a lot of the harmful chemicals they like to sneak into everything now-a-days. I haven&#x27;t had issues with the pump as some people have stated, but if I do, I would still give this 5 stars. I truly feel refreshed, clean and relaxed after my showers when I use this.</li>
    <li> Great fresh smell makes good bubbles</li>
    <li> Refreshing, light natural scent, not too flower-y, rinses off easily, not gloppy or sticky. I like the pump, easy to use.</li>
    <li> I love the smell and feel of the Kiss My Face Anti-stress Bath and Shower Gel, Value Size, 32 Ounce. Definitely would recommend.</li>
    <li> My sister loves this gel, and while I haven&#x27;t used it myself, it sure does smell nice.  Unfortunately, the big bottle I ordered arrived in a large Amazon box with 8 other gifts---but in transit, the screw-lid of this bottle came loose and several ounces spilled out.  The bottle itself was in a plastic bag - but that bag didn&#x27;t appear to be actually sealed in anyway, so the gel spilled out of the bag as well, into the box and onto other gifts - fortunately, all of those were either shrink-wrapped or in other bags, and thus none were ruined.  All told, probably lost about a fifth of the contents of gel.  I&#x27;d think the lid of this bottle should be taped securely in place for transit?  Of course, Amazon immediately offered to expedite a replacement bottle (great service!) - it is out of stock, so hopefully it will come in time for gift-giving...</li>
    <li> Bought it for the whole family to use. Perfect for everybody. Will buy more in the future for sure. Great smell (like a pine forest) and a great size as well. For that kind of bottle you really do have to make room on a shelve. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Mmmmm this smells so darn good! I love the fresh pine smell all year around. It is so delicate you can use it on your face, on your lady bits, everywhere. It does a fantastic job of removing any residue and rinsing clean. The bottle is humungous and it&#x27;s a great deal! Lasts for months (and I use lots of soap!). I&#x27;ve even used this as shampoo in a pinch and it didn&#x27;t dry my hair out much at all. I subscribed to this and it&#x27;s a regular part of my routine. Great product!</li>
    <li> Works and it can also be used in place of shaving cream if you forget to bring it on a trip. I Like that it is natural. No imitation scent.</li>
    <li> Never tested on animals. Good product with a nice light scent.</li>
    <li> I love Kiss My Face bath and shower gel but the new bottles don&#x27;t pump as well. I dumped it in an old style bottle to use</li>
