    <li> I usually buy this at Sprouts grocery store....they happened to be out and the Earth Science website was out of this particular product too. I received the product very quickly. The product was in perfect condition and exactly what I ordered and expected.  Thanks!</li>
    <li> Quickly shipped and at a great price.  I would buy from this seller again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product since Jason discontinued their \\&quot;Suma Moist\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;The cleanest most effective product that I&#x27;ve found to date.&lt;br /&gt;Love this stuff. My local health food store doesn&#x27;t stock it anymore.&lt;br /&gt;Hope it doesn&#x27;t get discontinued like the rest of the best products.</li>
    <li> After using this face cream for 48 hours I developed a sun-burn-like rash and my face began to swell.  72 hours later and my face is only just beginning to return to normal. If you use this cream and you experience a mild tingling sensation I would advise you to wash the cream off ASAP. Initially I thought the tingling was a good thing and for the first 24 hours my face looked and felt lovely. I don&#x27;t have particularly sensitive skin, at least not until now. I think I&#x27;ll stick to Weleda products in future.</li>
    <li> not heavy or sticky ~ very nice. I get lot&#x27;s of compliments for looking so young. Not sure  how much it is genetics or genes.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful cream so far, I use it several times a day if it is possible. I tried many different products before. I will buy this one again and again.  I am 37, have a mixed skin type.</li>
    <li> This is very hydrating, gentle and effective.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the ES Almond Aloe, and their other products, for years, but recently switched to this to give it a try. I love it. It is fragrance free and although it seems heavy when you apply it, it absorbs quickly and does not have an oily finish. It also makes my skin feel much firmer. I highly recommend it for the quality and the price.</li>
    <li> Best face cream I have found. Make my skin smoother and brighter and it does seem to minimize wrinkles as well as acne. It is a bit greasy but absorbs in a few minutes. Well worth the results. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this cream for about 12 years and have found it to be very effective and gentle.  I use Retin A and put Active Age on afterwards.  I have sensitive skin, but I have never had a rash from using  Beta Ginsing cream.  People always mention how nice my skin looks.  I think that it is a combination of the Retin A and the cream.  I will continue to use this cream as long as it is available.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for over 20 years now and highly recommend it. I frequently get complimented on my skin and asked what my &amp;#34;secret&amp;#34; is.</li>
    <li> Love that I can order online, as the places I use to buy it do not carry it anymore.  I have normal skin and this is such a great hydrating day creme.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for years and it&#x27;s truly the best!  Try it...you won&#x27;t be sorry!  All Earth Science products are high quality.</li>
    <li> I HAVE NOT USED THIS CREAM LONG ENOUGH TO SEE A DIFFERENCE.  BEA</li>
    <li> This stuff is so heavy and greasy I can&#x27;t imagine even someone with extremely dry skin being able to use it. I&#x27;m wondering about using it at night, but to be honest, I don&#x27;t know if I want this greasy stuff all over my pillows and bedding. I may try putting just a bit of it on during the day when I&#x27;m not going anywhere. Unless this stuff performs some sort of miracle, I don&#x27;t think I will be purchasing again. If I didn&#x27;t have to pay shipping, I would return it.</li>
    <li> I was given this cream by a friend.  I used it for 3 or 4 days, and it worked well as a moisturizer.  But I then developed a serious rash that continued to worsen in the following days.  I have since read that an outbreak of contact dermititis often lags initial exposure by a few days.  The rash began on my legs (where I used the cream) and then spread all over my body.  The itching reminded me of poison ivy itch.  I finally resorted to medication.  Benedryl didn&#x27;t do anything, so I had the doctor prescribe prednisone.  I am two days into that treatment and am hoping the condition will improve soon.  If you are sensitive, be careful with this product.</li>
    <li> I liked everything about this except the smell. I am sorry to say that I can&#x27;t tolerate it at all. If this were unscented, or fresher smelling somehow, it would be perfect. I may try to use it as hand lotion, but I can&#x27;t stand the smell of it on my face.</li>
    <li> This cream works great for my dry skin.</li>
    <li> Dried out my skin for over a week. Use with caution.</li>
    <li> Excellent all natural facial product.  Delievered on time as promised.</li>
    <li> Nice cream that seems to be doing what it&#x27;s supposed to do. Eight more words required? Eight more words required?</li>
    <li> I love earth science it is all natural without any parabens, and this moisturizer moisturizes very well. I use it in rotation of other products.</li>
    <li> Nice weight cream I use for day or night. Sinks into my skin fairly quickly. This is a good place to find it - Vitacost is another place that ships free and has this product.</li>
    <li> I had run out of their apricot product and wanted something fragrance free.  Amazon recommended this one and I read the reviews and ordered it.  I like it a lot.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for a couple years now.  It goes on smoothly, easily and does not leave a greasy film on my face.  And most important: it is cruelty free.</li>
    <li> Non-allergenic  and  really  soaks in  the face and neck.  All natural  with no colors or perfumes added.  Used it now for  15 years.  Best  face cream  available  at a reasonable  price.  Won&#x27;t break  you out!!  Add the Deluvia  Aloe  Cream  and you have the two  best  available  for face and body,  day and night  creams.</li>
    <li> Love this cream!!! I buy it over and over!</li>
    <li> Used this for years.  Excellent product.  Will continue using.</li>
