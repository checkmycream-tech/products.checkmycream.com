    <li> Great moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DO NOT USE IN SILICON TRAVEL TUBES! Gets too thick.</li>
    <li> I love this product, the seller was very prompt in Shipment. Item as described thank you so much,  highly recommended</li>
    <li> I got this in the mail in great time, I love the size and the pump-very sanitary! It hydrates without being greasy, love this moisturizer</li>
    <li> great price for the quantity</li>
    <li> This is my second salon size bottle n I absolutely love my skin now. It looks do uniform in color n my face has a nice brightness n glow to it! Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t feel heavy or break me out. I love it. I wish it was spf 30 or more, but I still buy it as is!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 50 and have always had problems with acne. I use this moisturizer every day, and use the Murad scrub twice a day to help with the breakouts. I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t believe I found this big of a bottle for the price.&lt;br /&gt;This is by FAR the BEST moisturizer I ever used. I&#x27;ve used this for two years. When I run out my face sure shows it after about a week. No other kinds compare and I&#x27;ve used TONS of different expensive kinds.&lt;br /&gt;The only thing that I didn&#x27;t like about this shipment was that bottle was not sealed at all. It was closed and didn&#x27;t appear to be used but I was leary. But I needed it so bad I used it anyway. And it&#x27;s fine.&lt;br /&gt;I still gave it 5 stars because I love it so much.</li>
    <li> The product goes on smoothly and absorbs nicely. However, after a couple of uses, my skin was getting really red. I got these blemishes that resemble more of eczema rather than the typical zits. I switched back to my Cotz zinc oxide sunscreen, and redness has significantly diminished.  Although it didn&#x27;t cause acne outbreak, it definitely warrants caution in those with sensitive skin like mine.</li>
    <li> Made my entire face break out</li>
    <li> It says noncomedogenic but every time I put it on I get pimples. Don&#x27;t waste your money...</li>
    <li> This product is worth every scent. I have been using it for about two years now and it has kept my skin in pristine condition. I have really excellent skin because of it. It helps control the periodic acne that I get, get rid of blemishes, discolourations and uneven skin tone and to a lesser extent helps control the oil. Why waste money on expensive BB &amp; CC  creams, Murad is all u need. I will never purchase another brand of moisturizer again.</li>
    <li> Great. Makes my face very soft. Has a different smell that takes some getting used to.</li>
    <li> Works great and like the pump!</li>
    <li> I dd not care the thick, heavy feeling of this product. Gave it to my daughter ho has more of acne problem than I do.</li>
    <li> still waiting to see if it works</li>
    <li> This moisturizer is awesome. Thick and leaves no oily look or feel.</li>
    <li> love this brought, the fact that it has SPF. and the size  great for the price</li>
    <li> Stuff goes on well and doesn&#x27;t leave me greasy. Sometimes though it is not moisturizing enough so I have to use another one in combo.</li>
    <li> my favorite summer moisturizer.  The salon size is a good value</li>
    <li> Really good buy for this product.</li>
    <li> Just started using the product yesterday but the pump was not working.&lt;br /&gt;Can I get a new pump please</li>
    <li> Bigger size on sale of my fav moisturizer, best deal ever! I have oily skin but as I age, I&#x27;ve found I need more moisture. This is great as it keeps my skin clear and keeps me hydrated!</li>
    <li> This was delivered to me &#x27;in a baggie&#x27; . . . no cap was on it and the lotion was all over the baggie;  the container was soiled and looked &#x27;used&#x27; . . .  I am sending it back!</li>
