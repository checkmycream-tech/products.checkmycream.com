<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> An effective mosquito repellent in the U.S. but in the Caribbean and Mexico seems like mosquitos drink this stuff as a cocktail. I got bit right through it.</li>
    <li> A classic. Keeps your skin youthful. If my mom recommends it, its good. Invest in some Neosporen too, you wont regret it.</li>
    <li> Love it. Smells good. Works great for bugs. Doesn&#x27;t hurt the baby. Bought it for years. Hope they never change it.</li>
    <li> I use this as  brush cleaner for my oil paints instead of harsh things like turpentine. Leaves my brushes clean and with a nice smell as well.</li>
    <li> Good stuff, has many uses, including polishing old bakelite back to life.</li>
    <li> The SSS that was sent was put to work (diluted with water) as a flea &amp; mosquito prevention for the dog.  However, we will also likely use it for the family too and the other many uses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The condition in which I received the oil was somewhat poor - it was shipped in a USPS cardboard mailer and it had rained so by the time I received it, the cardboard mailer had a rip in it and it was soaked through so there was a secondary hole developing as well.  Thankfully I received it when I did so it had not opened up completely.  In the future, shipper should reconsider the thin-envelope mailer the item was shipped in - in case of rain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than that, the item was exactly what was expected and I would order it again.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you,&lt;br /&gt;LS</li>
    <li> The item shown is not what I got when I ordered. It did not have the Skin So Soft logo (SSS) on the bottle. I am disappointed.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this for years to repel mosquitos. This is the original scent. This is the OIL, not the gel, so it is a bit messy to apply. The top screws on, and does not have a special applicator, so I pierced the protective foil only slightly in order to only get a little out at a time, rather than pour it. I rub it onto my legs, arms, and mosquitos really do not like it.</li>
    <li> Same Skin So Soft that&#x27;s been around forever. I use this on my horses and dog. I mix with water and vinegar as a non chemical fly spray for horses. I use on a paper towel to rub down my dog when he gets smelly and it smells good and hopefully repels insects. This was a good price too.</li>
    <li> I use it to repel mosquitos.</li>
    <li> Lovely skin and no bug bites? What more needs to be said about this old, reliable Avon product? Been using it since I was a kid and I&#x27;m in my sixties now. Just don&#x27;t put it in the bath too often unless you put bleach or some other toxic substance down the drain. I remember my not-very-happy dad going under the house, in the the crawl space, to clean out the trap that connected to the sewer because the oil build-up trapped the hair (like putting grease down the kitchen sink traps food) from my mom&#x27;s and my long, hot luxurious baths.It&#x27;s a lovely soak but better to put it on after the bath or shower.</li>
    <li> Love this! Is great for my eczema</li>
    <li> I use this for flyspray for me &amp; my Appaloosa when we go riding in the summer. Besides keeping all annoying insects away, he smells so good too.</li>
    <li> Wow, this smells soooo bad.  Seriously.  We bought this to keep the bugs of of my babies, but the smell was so bad that we needed to wash them a few times to get rid of it.  stay away.</li>
    <li> Always a good product.</li>
    <li> The bath oil is wonderful; I would appreciate a better cap though.  This top screws off and there isn&#x27;t an inner liner to limit how much comes out.  It&#x27;s too easy to spill; especially early in the morning when I&#x27;m not fully awake anyway!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks much!</li>
    <li> I always have liked skin so soft bath oil. I use it just after my shower and rinse the dogs with it to help with flea&#x27;s</li>
    <li> we have use this for several years as insect repellent and it really works and smells so nice instead of chemicals.</li>
    <li> Great mosquito repellent without the stink</li>
    <li> We use this oil for as mosquito repellant as it seems to work &amp; smells so much better than other bug spray. It also really penetrates dry skin.</li>
    <li> I have used this on our dogs for years . we have a rescue dog now and she has a dry skin condition and was always bringing fleas home from her walks after 6 mo of using this everynight it no only has made her skin really soft not one flea gets on her.</li>
    <li> Gives great soft skin after one use and smells very nice. Arrived quickly as well thank you so much!!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s nice and smells good but I&#x27;m allergic to it.</li>
    <li> I heard this keeps mosquitos away. They love me. Unfortunately I can&#x27;t say that it worked for that purpose.</li>
    <li> Great in the bath, but I use it on my horses during the summer for fly spray.</li>
    <li> Perfect item for repelling mosquitoes.  Just put in a sprayer and spray your body or around you on the ground and no mosquitoes!!</li>
    <li> This is one of my favorite oils, it  is great for re-hydrating dry skin, really does repel mosquitoes and great for removing old labels.  I love the scent and bought a bottle for my daughter and grandson.  A very natural way to repel mosquitoes without the use of insecticides.</li>
    <li> For some off reason this works to keep mosquito off me. As a chemist I try to minimize the amount of chemicals that get on me as they cause dry skin and other negative effects. This works perfect for me and leaves my skin soft and slightly shiny. Please note that it is oily for about 20 minutes as it is absorbed into the epidermis and then it no longer looks oily.</li>
    <li> My dog has his own area our back and I put this on his ears, legs and back and I don&#x27;t have to repeat that process for at least a day or 2. Put it on by hand because most dogs don&#x27;t like the spray sound and if they think you&#x27;re just rubbing them, they will allow you to put it on with no problems. I plan to let this be my bug repellant during those warm or got days.</li>
    <li> Best product ever to repel mosquitoes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I could be standing around 50 people near a mosquito swarm and I&#x27;d be the only one with 20 bites in a matter of minutes. That&#x27;s how much mosquitoes are drawn to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No &amp;#34;Bug Repellent&amp;#34; ever works for me, it seems to make the attraction worse if I use regular &amp;#34;Bug Spray.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I swear by this stuff for repelling mosquitoes. Plus it&#x27;s good for your skin.</li>
    <li> Love this product in bath. Did nothing to stop the mosquitoes from biting me in Mexico. I had heard it was good for stopping mosquitoes from biting.</li>
    <li> I remembered Skin so Soft from many,many years ago.  I expected it to be the same.  The smell is extremely strong, wasn&#x27;t useable for me - it&#x27;s a church donation now.  Disappointing how many &#x27;old standard&#x27; products get reformulated (and wrecked in the process)...</li>
    <li> Not only is this good for my skin, I use it on my mini schnauzer, softens her skin, shines her coat and repels the fleas.</li>
    <li> my skin is so so soft. love to bathe in this. Outstanding results on my feet. love this i will buy more</li>
    <li> It keeps your skin soft but better yet keeps thos Mosquitos away.  With the fears of this new virus we use this product each time we camp and are outside at home.</li>
    <li> I purchase this every year as part of a fly/mosquito repellent mixture for the horses and the family. I don&#x27;t know whats in it but bugs don&#x27;t like it. I have never used it for bath oil but it works great for my use.</li>
    <li> added a few drops of essential oil bug repellent and it worked better to keep the bugs off.</li>
    <li> After my shower, Skin So Soft keeps my skin from drying out.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! I use it after showering. Sometimes I spray some on the screens and the beautiful scent comes through the room. It keeps my  hydrated, soft and smelling nice!</li>
    <li> The effectiveness of this product against Mosquitos is legendary.</li>
    <li> I love this in the summer because I live in Alaska, it&#x27;s true, our mosquito&#x27;s are huge.  Without this we would look like burn victims.  The scent is fabulous, I love it, I always have.  It just rubs right into your skin and the bugs hate it.  I never use bug spray and never put bug spray on my boys.  We only use this.</li>
    <li> This oil can be used for so many things so I buy it all the time. Its a very gentle oil so can be used on any part of the body and it never stings. I rub or spray it on my legs and feet to keep mosquitos away and it works for me here in Arizona.</li>
    <li> Love it. Works wonders on my skin and smells great.</li>
    <li> The ONLY thing that keeps the mosquitoes off of me. I put some in a tiny spray bottle and use it whenever I need to.</li>
    <li> Arrived very quickly, good price</li>
    <li> I love the skin so soft!!! I&#x27;ve been using it for a couple of years now and it leaves your skin soft and you have that clean feeling&lt;br /&gt;after you take a shower.</li>
    <li> The product has a history of being great for fighting mosquitoes.  It has held-up to it&#x27;s name and fame and my family will continue to use it.  Thanks!</li>
    <li> Best for keeping away the bugs. would love a slightly less oily formula.</li>
    <li> The best it really helps to keep the mosquitos away from you.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great.  My grandmother turned me onto to this stuff a couple of decades ago, as I used to sneak into her bathroom cabinet to get a bit of this fabulous body oil.  But, as a young adult, I traveled to Minnesota for the summers and the mosquitos loved me.  I disliked using pesticides so I would use this product after each shower in which it alleviated having miserable bites by using, not sure why it repels bites by the mosquitos, but it surely does.  Nowadays, I just want an easy to use moisturizer on my legs after each shower and I looked at purchasing this product.  I read reviews about using Skin So Soft on my pet as well.  I bought it, still love it and now I am experimenting to see if this will help to reduce fleas on our family dog during Spring and Summer months....So far, so good!!!</li>
    <li> have used this product for years....it&#x27;s great for repellant , like the smell and it works</li>
    <li> Good Stuff.  Just as I remember it to be.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t be without this, so I was happy that I could buy it from my favorite shopping site, Amazon. Decently priced and with my-Prime did not to have to pay shipping. I refill both of my shower stall smaller spray sizes from this big jar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used it for years. It has a nice clean scent. The scent does not last long so it doesn&#x27;t interfere with men&#x27;s cologne&#x27;s or any fragrances. It is great to repel bug bites too. We take in on vacations. It&#x27;s a must-have in this household.</li>
    <li> I always use this when traveling anywhere there are mosquitoes  I am very susceptible to bites but I have never gotten one bite when I put on skin so soft all over my body before going outside. It smells nice but obviously the mosquitoes don&#x27;t think so.</li>
    <li> Always been a fan of this!  Softens skin and smells so sweet!</li>
    <li> Great Product as always. I use this in my recipe for horse fly spray. works like a charm :)</li>
    <li> Love this stuff.  So glad that I can purchase on Amazon now.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d never tried this product before and now I see that it&#x27;s irreplaceable. Not only is it great for the skin on people but also on my horses ( plus it keeps bees, mosquitoes, and flies off of them ).</li>
    <li> Always an excellent oil.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t used it yet as I purchased this for my upcoming trip to India to ward off the disease infested Mosquitoes.&lt;br /&gt;The packaging was excellent and the box arrived pronto. So A+ for the seller.</li>
    <li> Very satisfied thankyou I love skin so soft and it came very fast good job Amazon</li>
    <li> Works great as a mosquito repellant. ;)</li>
    <li> finally found this product</li>
    <li> We bought this to use on our trip to Costa Rica as bug repellant. My friend tried the Skin So Soft actual bug repellant and told us this worked better. This did work very, very well and we really liked how it made us smell. The only reason I give it a four is that the bottle will leak if you don&#x27;t take extra care to seal it very well. I suggest putting it in smaller bottles if traveling and sealing any bottle you bring with duct tape and plastic bag.</li>
    <li> Black flies, mosquitoes and the rest of summer biting bugs don&#x27;t like it, but I do.</li>
    <li> Great to use as a flea and tick repellant for dogs!</li>
    <li> Skin So Soft is an indispensable tool at house -- not for the bath, but for removing glue and insect bites,  It is actually to much work to remove the ring it leaves un the bathe tub.  It cleans clean those labels you can&#x27;t get off bottles, formica or fridges.</li>
    <li> Superior product for dry skin!</li>
    <li> This works great as mosquito repellent.  The only problem is the cap, which is not a spray cap.  As a result, you end up smearing far more of it than you actually need, and feeling all sticky.  Also, the cap is a little odd, and I accidentally spilled like half the bottle out while we were camping.  :(</li>
    <li> The SSS I recall from my childhood had a slightly prettier fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I read (in a blog) that this formula leaves out the orange oil, and substitutes jojoba. Might be just speculation, as I do not know for sure, but I do think the formula is different somehow.  Kinda sad.</li>
    <li> Great buy got ot foe mosquitos</li>
    <li> As a former Avon Representative, I found this to be a great price.  My daughter uses this religiously in her baths and I am hoping to find these at this great price in the future.</li>
    <li> Great pruduct for skin, also for your animals to prevent fleas.  ; )</li>
    <li> Was not the &amp;#34;Original&amp;#34; as advertised. This is the new version with jojoba added and that is not what is pictured above or advertised.</li>
    <li> Works great as a bug repellent.</li>
    <li> THIS ITEM WORKS VERY WELL FOR DRIED SKIN PROBLEMS.  IT ALSO IS A GOOD CLEANER FOR OIL, GRERSE, PAINT, AND OTHER SUCH ITEMS.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a complete mystery to me why people like this so much.  It&#x27;s only so-so as a bath oil - very thin and watery.  And the smell is dreadful - if it really works to repel bugs, there&#x27;s no mystery why, though the testing has seemed to disprove that, too.  And there is no way to use it from this bottle - you really have to pour it into another container.  I made the mistake of buying the 24 az. size and now need to figure out how to get rid of it. Sorry, but I can&#x27;t find anything good to say about it</li>
    <li> I have actually never written a review on a product before, and I purchase many items on the internet and in particular, through Amazon.  However, this product smelled so bad that I had to issue a warning.  Typically I very much enjoy lotions, perfumes, body washes, etc. and I enjoy many different types of scents.  When other reviews say that this smells bad, they weren&#x27;t kidding.  It actually smells like some type of household cleaning product - definitely NOT a body oil.  I frequently smell and try out new scents at Bath and Body Works, Ulta, etc. and I have NEVER smelled anything like this.  I used it once and will never use it again.  My teenagers held their noses when I came out of the bathroom having used this oil after a shower.  Can&#x27;t comment on the bug repellent component, because I won&#x27;t be testing that out.  As other posters have mentioned, there is no way to dispense this from the bottle other than pouring it into your hand (or directly into your bathwater), so it&#x27;s drips and runs.</li>
    <li> good product but did not like the fact that it is open bottle and pours out fast&lt;br /&gt;would buy different product like baby oil if it has a dispense instead of just open</li>
    <li> My dogs spend a lot of time outdoors. It is great for keeping the nasty, biting flies at bay. It&#x27;s always worked in the past so I would buy it again.</li>
    <li> This is still the best for mosquitos and for skin softner.</li>
    <li> I use this on my pet pig to keep the mosquitos anf gnats off of her.  I mix it with water in a spray bottle and spray it on her every other day.  It helps keep her skin moisturized.</li>
    <li> This stuff is the best for repelling insects.  I don&#x27;t believe in using toxic chemicals (deet) on myself or my family so I have tried many all natural repellents.  None have really worked that well.  I mix this in a spray bottle 1/2 water, 1/2 skin so soft and spray on exposed skin.  It really works although it is pretty stinky.  It repels husbands as well as bugs!</li>
    <li> I use for the Mosquitos in our yard and it works great.  I just wish it came with a squirt gun or something.  Not a huge fan of the smell, but it works!</li>
    <li> A little Avon Skin So Soft goes a long way. It can be on the greasy side if you use too much.  I like the  scent, but it is strong.  It does what it says....your skin will be soft!</li>
    <li> I use this as an ingredient in fly spray for my horses and it works great!!</li>
    <li> I love skin so soft.  I use it for myself but even better it keeps gnats out of my horses ears.  I put a bit on a cloth and rub their ears and it keep the bugs away.  It is excellent on my skin too and keeps mosquitos and other bugs off me also.  Great product.</li>
    <li> I used it on father&#x27;s day to go fishing as an insect repellent. It worked for the bugs but attracted the sun like no other. I got burnt! I&#x27;ve only used it once but it is the same skin so soft you&#x27;re used to.</li>
    <li> Smells wonderful.  Moisturizes your skin in an exemplary fashion and really keeps the bugs off.</li>
    <li> Smells as great as it did when I was a kid and keeps the mosquitos off.</li>
    <li> It is good as I use it as a flea repellent and to replenish our dogs skin oil also, Yes it works great,  Even in our own bath water,</li>
    <li> Great especially in the summer no bug bits of any kind it works great and your skin is smooth.  Some people don&#x27;t like the smell but I don&#x27;t like mesquitoe bits or spider bits so guess what I don&#x27;t mind the smell.</li>
    <li> I actually use this on my horse and he smells great and it helps keep the bugs off. This seller is fast and reliable.</li>
    <li> I get really dry skin and have used Skin So Soft for years. My grandma used to have it when I was a kid. She used to put it on us to keep bugs away in the summer. I still use it as bug repellent and it works well. In my opinion, it smells good and keeps bugs away and moisturizes my dry skin in the winter. It is a very versatile product. I&#x27;m a fan.</li>
    <li> very fast service everything as stated</li>
    <li> I use this as bug repellent! Half water half oil. Was told buy Avon rep long time ago that Avon chemists had no idea why this worked, but it does. Allergic to bugs and spray this around before I sit down outdoors. I do spray on myself lightly also. My whole family uses this. I am sure if you want to use this for other reasons it&#x27;s good!</li>
    <li> Great for bug repellent.  When in the Army this is all we used.  Keeps ticks off too.</li>
    <li> my wife is so happy with this product.</li>
    <li> I like to use this as after bath rinse for dogs with flea allergy&#x27;s 1 tbsp per gallon.</li>
