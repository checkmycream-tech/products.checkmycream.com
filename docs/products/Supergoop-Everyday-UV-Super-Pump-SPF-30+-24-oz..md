      <li>It&#x27;s the best.</li>
      <li>Best Eco-friendly sunscreen I&#x27;ve ever used!!  </li>
      <li>is great!!  </li>
      <li>Best of all, no oxynenzone!</li>
      <li>It provides great protection and doesn&#x27;t ruin her skin.  </li>
      <li>The dispenser is very handy.</li>
      <li>Great product and good pump.  </li>
      <li>Per my dermatologist wife, this type of sunblock provides good sun protection but takes up to 20 minutes to be activated after applying to skin.</li>
      <li>I researched it on the Cosmetic Safety Database and it looks good.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s my go to brand forever more!</li>
      <li>I also love that fact that it doesn&#x27;t clog your poors and gives your face a nice healthy sheen in a good way that looks like the bb creams in the store for $60 bucks.  </li>
      <li>Not bad but not as good</li>
      <li>This sunscreen is easier to apply than most barrier sunscreens.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll be buying more.</li>
      <li>I have SO many people hooked on this stuff.  </li>
      <li>It goes on more like moisturizer than sunscreen.</li>
      <li>Im glad I bought it.</li>
      <li>family tribe favorite</li>
      <li>Otherwise, the thinner places will tan more than the locations with thicker application.&lt;br</li>
      <li>and you also apply it on face, ears, neck, arms, top of hands...</li>
      <li>physical sunblocks are one of the best skin protectors out there, including chemical sunblocks, like parsol (avobenzone)</li>
      <li>Easy to apply.</li>
      <li>Easy pump to use in the mornings after a shower and before clothes.</li>
      <li>Easy to use and spreads well .</li>
      <li>The pump bottle format is so convenient to use that it encourages us to put on the sunscreen every time we leave the house -- faster than squeezing stuff out of a bottle with slippery hands -- and the sunscreen itself rubs in easily.</li>
      <li>Strongly recommended.</li>
      <li>It goes on smooth and coverage</li>
      <li>Goes on smooth and holds up under sweaty conditions.  </li>
      <li>Goes on easier than most sunblocks, and the pump makes it great for applying to kids without making a mess.  </li>
      <li>Although, the reason I love it, is the daily SPF and the pump is VERY easy to use and you never forget it in the AM</li>
      <li>Also a very consistent texture and creaminess for applying it.</li>
      <li>Seduced by the beautiful packaging and free samples with purchase, I have succumbed to temptation several times only to regret it after my clothes are stained, the kids Are screaming that it burns and sensitive skin kid has a rash.</li>
      <li>We have been using this proud for over 7 yrs and have gone through about 12 of the pump dispensers during that time...including the much larger size they used to make with the square handle...wish they would bring that back...</li>
      <li>Was fabulous on our daughter&#x27;s sensitive skin!</li>
      <li>Had higher hopes for this product.</li>
      <li>I was so excited to find this large sunscreen pump at my local drugstore because of the huge amount of sunscreen my family goes through during the summer.  </li>
      <li>Super cool pump, enough for the whole family for the whole season.</li>
      <li>I am sticking with pure, non-nano zinc oxide from now on.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t contain the gross chemicals that we&#x27;re trying to avoid and it spreads more easily than some other screens that rely on Zinc Oxide.</li>
      <li>This one really fits the bill.</li>
      <li>Just try to remember how much this bottle costs as you pump.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
      <li>, it probably is not going to be as effective as something with a physical blocker such as zinc --</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t have a strong smell, which I love, but it is a little greasy, which is the only reason I didn&#x27;t give it five stars.</li>
      <li>If humidity is high this lotion seems to just rub off and my kids ended up burnt anyway</li>
      <li>and this is why the zinc-based sunscreens are much thicker and harder to rub into your skin -- so if you burn extremely easily and/or you will be have a lot of direct sun exposure, then you may just want to use zinc-based blockers.</li>
      <li>Easy to overuse due to liberal pumping action.  </li>
      <li>Although it has a rather odd smell, it spreads and blends in easily.  </li>
      <li>I believe that the active ingredient is Parsol, which was used in sunscreens in Canada for years and was only approved by the FDA in recent years -- before that I used to always load up on sunscreen whenever I visited Canada because I couldn&#x27;t find an effective, easy-to-apply sunscreen in the U.S.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I have had a reaction to it before and somehow missed it on the bottle when I bought this sunscreen since it is normally near the bottom of ingredient lists (which would help explain the severity of my reaction).  </li>
      <li>It lasts all summer for my family and does not bother my young children.</li>
      <li>/&gt;--Does not break out the kid in the family that has extremely sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>Hopefully my review will save someone else who is similarly sensitive to phenoxyethanol and chemical sunscreens from going through what I did.  </li>
      <li>This is a good sunscreen and it&#x27;s pretty convenient being in a pump bottle, but I&#x27;m not sure in the future that I like it enough to keep paying the more expensive price tag.</li>
      <li>So, I empty the small, pretty containers of the chi-chi sunscreen and pump in my super goop.&lt;br /&gt;We</li>
      <li>, it&#x27;s thick but still easy enough to spread.</li>
      <li>i have asked a number of times, directly on Dr. T&#x27;s Supergoop website, why they don&#x27;t have a physical sunblock, such as zinc oxide or titanium dioxide, in the big pump version .  </li>
      <li>I am certain that the offending ingredient is Phenoxyethanol (a preservative commonly used in \\&quot;natural\\&quot; skincare products in place of parabens) as it is a known skin irritant, and is high up on the ingredient list in this product.  </li>
      <li>While less convenient than the spray mist and takes longer to apply, this is the real deal.  </li>
      <li>Our family is pale-skinned and we have never burned using Supergoop, though we are careful to reapply several times throughout the day and generally try to avoid too much direct sunlight.</li>

<li> I would say that it doesn&#x27;t ever quite feel dry to me - not unlike other sunscreens - and I continue to feel a little sticky the whole time</li>
<li> AND we needed it to be free of all those scary chemicals.</li>
<li> This sunscreen applies thick, white, creamy paste substance that applies in slow, smooth motion.  </li>
<li> The white residue takes a little rubbing to disappear, but will reappear during and after playing at the beach in the form of white flakes on skin/hair.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
<li> This is a water based sunscreen so it rubs in extremely well, not leaving any white streaks.</li>
<li> does not produce the burning, stinging sensation you can get from other products (especially if you didn&#x27;t reapply and have started to get red on the face).&lt;br /&gt;--not as greasy as some other products if you need to hold a tennis racquet after applying.&lt;br /&gt;--does</li>

<li> Look at the bottle, folks, it is 18 oz, not huge but plenty enough for the summer.</li>
<li> EWG gives this product a \\&quot;yellow light\\&quot; score (with one of the active sunscreen ingredients, Oxtinoxate, getting a 6!!).  </li>

<li> story short, I have become bored and am tempted by the more glamorous and expensive brands out there.</li>
<li> We&#x27;ve been using it a few weeks</li>
<li> you&#x27;re missing out.  </li>
<li> We&#x27;ve been using this stuff at home for the past few years.</li>
<li> Don&#x27;t get me wrong, I would definitely buy and use this again, but my family is a little smarter now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> /&gt;--actually works past the expiration date...</li>
<li> My 12 yr old plays tennis practically every day of the year in white clothing that gets nasty orange stains if he borrows other sunscreen at practice.&lt;br</li>
<li> I don&#x27;t mean just cover everywhere, but literally cover even amounts.  </li>
<li> However, I suffered a horrible allergic reaction to it all over my arms and legs</li>
<li> I also wish I had checked the Environmental Working Group website before purchasing this product, as that would have saved me the horrible reaction regardless.  </li>

    <li> This is the sunblock we use every summer. The pump bottle format is so convenient to use that it encourages us to put on the sunscreen every time we leave the house -- faster than squeezing stuff out of a bottle with slippery hands -- and the sunscreen itself rubs in easily. Our family is pale-skinned and we have never burned using Supergoop, though we are careful to reapply several times throughout the day and generally try to avoid too much direct sunlight. I believe that the active ingredient is Parsol, which was used in sunscreens in Canada for years and was only approved by the FDA in recent years -- before that I used to always load up on sunscreen whenever I visited Canada because I couldn&#x27;t find an effective, easy-to-apply sunscreen in the U.S.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No, it probably is not going to be as effective as something with a physical blocker such as zinc -- and this is why the zinc-based sunscreens are much thicker and harder to rub into your skin -- so if you burn extremely easily and/or you will be have a lot of direct sun exposure, then you may just want to use zinc-based blockers.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a sunscreen to keep up with my family during baseball, soccer, etc. AND we needed it to be free of all those scary chemicals. I researched it on the Cosmetic Safety Database and it looks good. We&#x27;ve been using it a few weeks, it&#x27;s thick but still easy enough to spread. I would buy it again.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t have a strong smell, which I love, but it is a little greasy, which is the only reason I didn&#x27;t give it five stars.</li>
    <li> Left my child with a rash all over.</li>
    <li> Goes on smooth and holds up under sweaty conditions.  I use it to play golf and do not like a product I have to apply on the course.  This one really fits the bill.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s the best. No comparison. Especially for the price.  It lasts all summer for my family and does not bother my young children.</li>
    <li> Great product and good pump.  Small enough to bring with on beach vaca or to have on a counter at home.</li>
    <li> Super cool pump, enough for the whole family for the whole season. Easy to apply. Best of all, no oxynenzone!</li>
    <li> I was so excited to find this large sunscreen pump at my local drugstore because of the huge amount of sunscreen my family goes through during the summer.  Although it has a rather odd smell, it spreads and blends in easily.  However, I suffered a horrible allergic reaction to it all over my arms and legs (thank goodness I didn&#x27;t use it on my face!) in the form of a red itchy rash all over the areas I had applied it, as well as swelling.  It took several days to go away.  Fortunately, the drugstore took it back and gave me a refund (and the pharmacist also recommended medicine to treat my bad reaction).  I am certain that the offending ingredient is Phenoxyethanol (a preservative commonly used in \\&quot;natural\\&quot; skincare products in place of parabens) as it is a known skin irritant, and is high up on the ingredient list in this product.  I have had a reaction to it before and somehow missed it on the bottle when I bought this sunscreen since it is normally near the bottom of ingredient lists (which would help explain the severity of my reaction).

Hopefully my review will save someone else who is similarly sensitive to phenoxyethanol and chemical sunscreens from going through what I did.

    <li> i have asked a number of times, directly on Dr. T&#x27;s Supergoop website, why they don&#x27;t have a physical sunblock, such as zinc oxide or titanium dioxide, in the big pump version .  physical sunblocks are one of the best skin protectors out there, including chemical sunblocks, like parsol (avobenzone)....so i&#x27;m just wondering why they don&#x27;t combine parsol with zinc oxide like a lot of other sunscreens out there.  i haven&#x27;t gotten an answer.  so, i&#x27;m left to keep guessing.  i put in a couple of reviews on their website, but they never post them....so their reviews are filtered.  try to put in a review...it&#x27;ll say the post will be reviewed...check back, and they never post it.</li>
    <li> Best Eco-friendly sunscreen I&#x27;ve ever used!!  It goes on smooth and coverage is great!!  It&#x27;s my go to brand forever more!</li>
    <li> Was fabulous on our daughter&#x27;s sensitive skin! No breaking out for her! Also a very consistent texture and creaminess for applying it.</li>
    <li> We have been using this proud for over 7 yrs and have gone through about 12 of the pump dispensers during that time...including the much larger size they used to make with the square handle...wish they would bring that back...&lt;br /&gt;POSITIVES:&lt;br /&gt;--Does not break out the kid in the family that has extremely sensitive skin. EVERY other sunscreen breaks him out.&lt;br /&gt;-- does not produce the burning, stinging sensation you can get from other products (especially if you didn&#x27;t reapply and have started to get red on the face).&lt;br /&gt;--not as greasy as some other products if you need to hold a tennis racquet after applying.&lt;br /&gt;--does not stain your clothes!!! My 12 yr old plays tennis practically every day of the year in white clothing that gets nasty orange stains if he borrows other sunscreen at practice.&lt;br /&gt;--actually works past the expiration date...found a jug I had left in a suitcase after a trip. It had expired a year prior, but it worked like a charm...in the Caribbean!&lt;br /&gt;Long story short, I have become bored and am tempted by the more glamorous and expensive brands out there. Seduced by the beautiful packaging and free samples with purchase, I have succumbed to temptation several times only to regret it after my clothes are stained, the kids Are screaming that it burns and sensitive skin kid has a rash. So, I empty the small, pretty containers of the chi-chi sunscreen and pump in my super goop.&lt;br /&gt;We have containers in every car, every tennis and golf bag, every purse, school backpack and sitting on the kitchen counter by the back door.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t even like to think what my world would be like if they ever stop selling this stuff.</li>
    <li> Works well.This was something that Ive been looking for. Im glad I bought it. Easy to use and spreads well .</li>
    <li> If you haven&#x27;t tried Supergoop you&#x27;re missing out.  I have SO many people hooked on this stuff.  I also love that fact that it doesn&#x27;t clog your poors and gives your face a nice healthy sheen in a good way that looks like the bb creams in the store for $60 bucks.  Although, the reason I love it, is the daily SPF and the pump is VERY easy to use and you never forget it in the AM and you also apply it on face, ears, neck, arms, top of hands...I also have them in the car for when I&#x27;m driving to appointments.</li>
    <li> This is the only sunscreen she&#x27;ll use.  It provides great protection and doesn&#x27;t ruin her skin.  It goes on more like moisturizer than sunscreen.</li>
    <li> This is a good sunscreen and it&#x27;s pretty convenient being in a pump bottle, but I&#x27;m not sure in the future that I like it enough to keep paying the more expensive price tag.</li>
    <li> The dispenser is very handy. I keep it by the door to pump a handful as I leave in the morning. Keeps me freckle-free.</li>
    <li> Had higher hopes for this product. Not bad but not as good I was expecting. If humidity is high this lotion seems to just rub off and my kids ended up burnt anyway</li>
    <li> Went to the beach on family vacation with scorching sun.  This sunscreen applies thick, white, creamy paste substance that applies in slow, smooth motion.  After using this for a week, here are some gotchas.  Don&#x27;t get me wrong, I would definitely buy and use this again, but my family is a little smarter now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Apply evenly.  I don&#x27;t mean just cover everywhere, but literally cover even amounts.  Otherwise, the thinner places will tan more than the locations with thicker application.&lt;br /&gt;- Hairy arms, chest, legs, and any other location with hair gets tricky.  The white residue takes a little rubbing to disappear, but will reappear during and after playing at the beach in the form of white flakes on skin/hair.&lt;br /&gt;- Easy to overuse due to liberal pumping action.  Just try to remember how much this bottle costs as you pump.&lt;br /&gt;- Apply to face and leaves skin looking oily shiny, but doesn&#x27;t feel oily at all.  Not a problem at the beach.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a parent of two travel soccer players, I&#x27;ve used just about all types of sun block.  While less convenient than the spray mist and takes longer to apply, this is the real deal.  Strongly recommended.</li>
    <li> Look at the bottle, folks, it is 18 oz, not huge but plenty enough for the summer. This is a water based sunscreen so it rubs in extremely well, not leaving any white streaks. Easy pump to use in the mornings after a shower and before clothes. I&#x27;ll be buying more.</li>
    <li> This sunscreen is easier to apply than most barrier sunscreens. It doesn&#x27;t contain the gross chemicals that we&#x27;re trying to avoid and it spreads more easily than some other screens that rely on Zinc Oxide. My kids like that they don&#x27;t look like ghosts after applying it. I would say that it doesn&#x27;t ever quite feel dry to me - not unlike other sunscreens - and I continue to feel a little sticky the whole time it&#x27;s on. I also don&#x27;t find it be water resistant at all and if my kids wear it at the pool it needs to be reapplied every hour.</li>
    <li> We&#x27;ve been using this stuff at home for the past few years. Goes on easier than most sunblocks, and the pump makes it great for applying to kids without making a mess.  Per my dermatologist wife, this type of sunblock provides good sun protection but takes up to 20 minutes to be activated after applying to skin.</li>
    <li> family tribe favorite</li>
