<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> My son really love his brush. What a good choice this worked very well! One of his better gifts from amazon.</li>
    <li> My Grandson wanted this brush, it really is nice he purchased 2 brush&#x27;s and as long as he is happy then Granny is happy, and he is Happy with both of them.</li>
    <li> Simple as that. The brushes shape is one of a kind. It helps your confections. This brush also depends your wave pattern. I&#x27;m one of those people who doesn&#x27;t really like hard brushes. This is a medium and it can maintain my hair for long periods of time. I know what you&#x27;re thinking; Diane brushes are a lot cheaper and can still do the job. Diane brushes are good, but the quality of this brush blows other brushes out the park. Have a trouble spot? This brush is sure to fix it!</li>
    <li> i haven&#x27;t really used it yet but i think i will like it once my hair grows to the correct length</li>
    <li> Really good for trying to get waves, don&#x27;t recommend for fresh cuts: kinda hard :( , overall good product for 360 waves.</li>
    <li> got a dirty brush that was used feeled with dandruff , before it came it i brush with my normal brush and as soon as i ised this brush bunch of dandruff , they gave my used peice of junk brush , looked like cornbread or cookie crumbs in my hair ...waste of 20 bucks i threw it away ..if u dont have a new brush atleast say so dont  sell used brushes ...i already threw it away and i dont see dandruff nomore ...im not the only reviewer who has said this others have gotta used stankin brushes corn chips and ish in it</li>
    <li> This is a great brush!!! It is bigger then I expected, so it takes a little getting used to. I highly recommend this brush for all wavers!</li>
    <li> this is a awsome product my waves were spining instantly. if you want want super deep waves BUY THIS BRUSH</li>
    <li> Both the blue and the green medium boar bristle brushes cracked within 20 seconds after initially runnning them under warm water and soap.  This is totally unacceptable. Now previously, I bought the red soft brush and have had it for 6 months with no problems, regularly running it under warm water and soap to clean it.  I have never had this problem with a Diane brush and I don&#x27;t know if I can ever purchase from Crown Quality Products again as that $40 plus dollars seemed to have been a waste.  The quality of the wood should not be that fragile and so I question the &amp;#34;quality&amp;#34; of the company in their choice of wood.</li>
    <li> I brought this brush and my son loves it!!! Great price too!! He said it helped to get more waves in his hair!!</li>
    <li> very good brush for waves while hair is thicker</li>
    <li> This brush gives you such a quality feel when brushing your hair. There is not a day that goes by that I don&#x27;t use this brush. In fact, I bought a second brush. One for my car, and one for my room. If you&#x27;re looking to get waves in your hair in a short amount of time or just looking to stay groomed, look no further than this brush.</li>
    <li> Being a female waver i was looking for a brush that would give me results. i just received my crown brush today in the mail and i must say its a major upgrade from the wav enforcer i been using. it hugs your head close while massaging your scalp. so glad i brought this brush.. one happy waver</li>
    <li> I received this brush on August 1, 2012 &amp; I am extremely impressed. It lived up to the hype. I waited for a while to review it because I wanted to see how it worked long term. I most definitely  encourage anyone who is serious about their wave game to make the switch over to Crown brushes if they are using another brand. The width of the brush covers more of your head than traditional brushes &amp; the curve design contours to the shape of your head more so than other brands. The bristles seem study and the color is beautiful. It doesn&#x27;t take a of pressure when brushing either. You can actually feel the bristles pulling your hair. I see an improvement in the deepness of my waves also. Great investment &amp; I am a very happy customer.</li>
    <li> Best brush ever the curve that it has fits around your whole head its just amazing also ordered the softy non handled red one but i would like to know wat is better handled brushes r non handled</li>
    <li> So I did some research on the cqp and this brush is amazing. I hear a lot of talk about how you brush your hair, the kind of brush to use but these things are true but it all depends on your hair grade and texture. I love this brush because of the contoured design, the bristles never leave your HAIR not scalp, and you don&#x27;t need 1,000 strokes per hour to achieve the 360 wave pattern. I&#x27;m wolfing with it now but my next buy will be the onyx hard long handle because my hair is thick. Thanks cqp and I&#x27;m loving the blue.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t tell no difference in hair same as any other brush fell into the hype just like when I bought that dam tsu rag. my old methods and brush work the same not impressed at all. hair still wavy but not deeper like all the hype was I guess it was all in their mind.im going on 4 weeks now and my wavy enforcer brush that I paid $5 for is doing just as good real talk</li>
    <li> Does what it says the bristles on this brush are way better than the Diane&#x27;s , not to mention this brush just flows with your hair pattern .. If you want waves get this brush</li>
    <li> I WAs Skeptical About Spending $20 On A Brush. WHitin The 1St Couple Of Days, I Had New Waves. Its Definetly Worth The Money</li>
    <li> If you Wave you need one of these cause its the best Brush on the market nothing else comes close</li>
    <li> This brush is the only brush I will use now. Great for wave building and it fits great in the hand. You can get 360 waves in no time! This brush is great for when your hair gets long. its a harder brush</li>
    <li> CRACKED THE LOGO ON THE BACK IS FADING A WAS OUT OF PLACE FROM THE BEGINNING UNBELIEVABLE WASTE OF MONEY. DONT BUY QUESTIONABLE AUTHENTICITY</li>
    <li> If you serious about getting waves get this brush it cost a Lil much but it worth it using this brush will have your waves on spinn foreal</li>
    <li> Bar-none the best brush i ever put in my head period if anyone was to ask this is the brush to get i have all four brushes an all of them meet or exceeded my expectations out of the product</li>
    <li> I just received it today, which makes this brush #3. I love these brushes, You just cant have one. This brush makes it easier to get waves, I keep feel the bristles tugging my hair as I brush. Big up&#x27;s to CQP.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my son-in-law for christmas and he loves it.  Very well made and comfortable in your hand.  Does a great job too!</li>
    <li> I thought the brush was gonna be the same color as the one shown in the picture</li>
    <li> All Wave enthusiast if you want to take your brush quality to the highest level, this is the product you want to add. Any brush will do the trick and you do not need a crown brush to get, develop, and/or maintain waves, but it will allow you to brush your hair evenly and with high quality bristles that makes for better waving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do own several crowns. I Own the Hard, the Premium (with Med Boar Bristles), and this brush the Medium Mixed Boar Brush. This brush is more like a soft/med brush, does not have the feel of a medium brush, but it feels great and is effective. I usually use it when my hair is 1-2&#x27; and it is great, probably my favorite pick out of their selection. It also is designed to to contour to your head. Great purchase, you won&#x27;t be disappointed</li>
    <li> this brush is the best brush I ever had in my life the second day I noticed my waves receive more definition control and don&#x27;t have to wear wave cap as long as I use to do.thank you very much crown.</li>
    <li> This has to be the greatest brush ever. The brush does exactly what the description says it does, it curls up your hair in a short period of time and that&#x27;s what most wavers look for. This brush deserves five stars for the quality, looks, and overall the brush itself. Also it was a nice and expeditious transaction if you ask me.</li>
    <li> The moment I pulled her out the bag and touch my hair. I immediately felt the difference .the brush covers most of my head and the experience was crazy. I been brushing my hair ever since . This product lives up to its name . Fellow wavers this is worth the price . Also anyone looking to become a master barber hit me up at jemworld2@aol.com it&#x27;s free . Must live in nyc</li>
    <li> Pros: I highly Recommend the medium CQP is good for fresh cuts and also good for wolfing.... if your a beginner i recommend you buy the medium and a premium... this brush made me get better waves on the sides... not to mention it feels so good when you just get it you wont wanna stop brushing trust me... it just feels so different from a regular brush... get one today you wont regret it... worth it&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: well the only con i have is that my paint came off too easily at the grip of the brush but it was my fault my hands were wet... just watch out for that these brushes cost alot and they are like candy the way they look. best brush you can buy</li>
    <li> I have just used this brush for the first time after using a wave enforcer brush from Walmart. The reason I&#x27;m writing a review this early is because after only one use I can see a very noticeable change. My waves are more pronounced after just one use! I&#x27;ve been having trouble getting permanent waves in the back bottom right of my head and again after Only One Use, I can see them forming. I see now why this brush had been patented. BTW - I don&#x27;t brush all day and I never will. I think now I can finally say &amp;#34;I&#x27;m spinnin&#x27; on &#x27;em&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> The brush was missing bristle when it came and wasn&#x27;t brand new as expected. Good brush not great. Could have been better with the quality of the brush.</li>
    <li> This brush was all it stated and more. Great feel and it works as advertised. I strongly recommend it to anyone looking to enjoy a quality product.</li>
    <li> When I received my brush it wasn&#x27;t as firm as I know CQP medium brushes to be. The brush I bought from here was more so a med/soft brush.</li>
    <li> I have experienced a noticable difference in my wave development since using CQP brushes. When I first discovered CQP I purchased a Premium and my waves started forming quickly. One day after using this medium my temples are starting to wave up nicely and my crown is doing allot better. Keep in ming its about the technique and consistancy one puts into getting waves ..not the product but this product really has assisted in my efforts. I have a Hard and Softy on the way and withn the next month my entire head should be wavy (only lacking in the right side on my crown) and connecting very nice.</li>
    <li> ARRIVED EARLY. The brush is sick pricey but sick. The contours of the brush make brushing a better experience.</li>
    <li> Nice brush. Easy to use and strong soft brittles.  I like it.  So I&#x27;m a satisfied customer. :) :) :)</li>
    <li> Very good brush feels terrific against my head and the waves are coming i recommend this to anybody tryna get waves</li>
    <li> Best brush i ever bought.  Will be buying another as soon as more come into stock.</li>
    <li> The quality was pretty shoddy.  Whole sections of bristle so came out. The logo rubbed of after the first day the wood is not the quality you see on the picture. Either this is an old version I received, it&#x27;s a fake, or not as good a product as advertised.</li>
    <li> Perfect brush, does as it says. Waves connect perfectly, the brush covers Alot of area with just one pass on your head  </li>
    <li> Packaging was horrible.  Look like the brush had been used (hopefully it wasn&#x27;t). But the brush is good. I would buy another one</li>
    <li> This brush is great! It&#x27;s a must-have for anybody who wants 360 waves. This truly gets the job done with way less effort. I&#x27;m seeing amazing results in such little time! The way it contours to your head and how the bristles are designed just makes everything easy. It makes you actually want to brush lol. Worth every penny. I&#x27;m very appreciated with this product.</li>
    <li> I love this brush got my waves deep and helped me get waves on the side better then my diane. I plan on getting a soft one next</li>
    <li> Man this brush is the truth. I won&#x27;t say it&#x27;s the best ever but it&#x27;s the best I&#x27;VE ever had. Fresh out the packing....25-30 strokes and I could already see how well it shaped my waves/hair in what would&#x27;ve taken my wave enforcer 10min to do REAL TALK! The curvature literally shapes your head and the medium bristles are so long and top notch they grab your strands almost like a comb and smooths em back down like a softy. Perfect for early wolf stages. I recommend using about 2 weeks AFTER your last cut</li>
    <li> It gave me more wave in my trouble spot but my waves weren&#x27;t connect and it didn&#x27;t give me that deep look that I wanted but don&#x27;t get me wrong it feels great in my hair and is probably the best brush that ive own</li>
    <li> This brush is wonderful. It&#x27;s fantastic actually, it really is. It&#x27;s helping with the wave process like it&#x27;s supposed to....but man Crown brushes are over priced. I don&#x27;t care what anybody says because at the end of the day, it&#x27;s a brush.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s awesome my waves connected perfect best thing that I put on my head</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m in love with my new crown brush. About to order another one for the car so I can keep my waves flowing.</li>
    <li> This is the best wave brush money can buy! I love the curve design because all of the bristle make contact to your hair causing the waves to become deeper. This is a must buy!</li>
    <li> This is the best brush ever. I really does get you instant waves. Once using this brush for a couple of days, you won&#x27;t even need your durag!</li>
    <li> Yea it&#x27;s just a brush, but it&#x27;s everything they say it it, it is soooo much more efficient than a regular brush, so now I&#x27;m team CQP for life!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t be afraid of the price tag, its worth it. I used to use my soft, medium and hard Diane brushes, and had decent waves besides my hard to wave right, but within a month, my waves were much straighter and deeper, and my hard to wave right side had defined waves, which will be deepened this second wolfing session. GO GET THIS BRUSH IF U WANT DOPE WAVES</li>
    <li> My waves are crazy!!! 😊</li>
    <li> This brush is like a glove for your head and feels amazing and also fits well in my hand only thing is the label goes away after continued use.</li>
    <li> I cut and style my own hair. Low curly hair waves) has always been my forte. This brush helped me to enhance my hair and gave it better texture and connections. This brush with my normal regiment has enhanced the way my hair looks.</li>
    <li> Awesome brush its a must have Just got mine brush in today i i been brushing none stop cant help but to brush my hair.</li>
    <li> I brought 3 of these brushes, a hard and 2 mediums, they&#x27;re awesome, dnt knw why i waited so long to get them. if u&#x27;re a waver n ya aint got them ya missing out. The seller shipped them very fast too. Good stuff @ Team CQB.</li>
    <li> I started using this brush as soon as I removed it from the package and I saw results immediately. It may be a medium, but it was as hard if not harder than the hard bristled Diane I own, but I&#x27;m not complaining. I&#x27;ve had the brush a little less than one month and I&#x27;m getting waves and connections in places I didn&#x27;t have before. I tripped on the price at first, but really, this brush is worth the investment.</li>
    <li> I waited like it was Christmas eve night on these to arrive, as my waves have been progressing very well. I knew that my Diane&#x27;s could only take me so far without me having major brush sessions, which I really dont like brushing for 15-20 minutes at a time. Let me tell you after reading a lot of reviews about &#x27;hype&#x27; and what not, but there is no hype, a noticeable difference after a quick session with this brush. Only down fall is the price, it doesn&#x27;t need to be so expensive, the quality is unmatched and they don&#x27;t use any more quality materials than other manufacturers. I think its just matter of standing out by the price. Like i say, product is five stars, price isn&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> Definitely works on any type of hair, exactly what you need to get waves on a any problem areas. Easy to grip handles makes it effortless.</li>
    <li> The talk is true! This brush seriously makes my Dianes garbage. I was skeptical about that at first because I thought Diane was the best brush ever but once you do this... its AMAZING!! BUY IT~!&lt;br /&gt;Also the bristles are a little bit harder than the Diane 8119/8114 but its still a medium brush.</li>
    <li> i kwo i will love this brush a have tryed a lot of brushes @ im a female with waves... so i now this is the brush for me..... thxz/</li>
    <li> Recommend this brush too this brush I the truth I use this brush in the shower awesome also nice firm too.</li>
    <li> im a person who has enjoyed good hair care products. so when i learned of the 360 brush i knew this would be perfect for my brushing habits. the brush is wonderful. my hair is grown and i see y the med brush is necessary so i&#x27;ve just purchase a soft 360 red. wish me luck. i&amp;#34;ii b back . aka L.A</li>
    <li> The last brush needed for my collection, my GO-TO brush with amazing pull power on hair strands which definitely helps deepen waves. I love this brush although its hard to come by i would say that if you have the $$ and the chance to purchase one and youre into hair care....get it! great product proud to say my collection is complete with the happy medium</li>
    <li> These are just simply the best brushes ever! They help form my waves sooner. The bristles don&#x27;t hurt my head but are hard enough to get the job done correctly.</li>
    <li> My son loves loves loves this brush. He brushes his hair all day long. All day long.  Waves looks really nice.</li>
    <li> Just know, this brush is the best brush on the market for peak waving purposes. It truly gets the job done.</li>
    <li> Its a great brush. Brought my brushing time down. It also helped me gain waves that I didn&#x27;t have before. The brush curves to the head and snaps the hair into curls. worth the price</li>
    <li> If you don&#x27;t have 1 then there&#x27;s nothing more to add, this brush speaks for itself no need to write a book why u need 1.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Takeaway - buy now ;)</li>
    <li> Great product, it came in excellent condition and you notice the difference in a matter of minutes. Best brush out there hands down..</li>
    <li> Great brush must buy for any waver.</li>
    <li> I started off wit a diane brush I had loved it for the time but once I got this one the wave game totally changed for me this is the real deal if you want thicker and crispier waves 5 STARS!</li>
    <li> The brush is very useful, it doesn&#x27;t miss any hairs as you brush and feels great. It really goes deep and grabs the hairs.  I recommend this brush for mostly wolfing for it will be harder than you think. But I guess you don&#x27;t always have to press hard so you should be good. I recommend you get the soft one to go along with this one because they go great together</li>
    <li> When I received my Brush it was obviously USED it was so caked with dandruff and it had hand prints and dings already in the brush! Obviously someone doesn&#x27;t care enough to send there customers new Items or even clean the used ones to make it look used! VERY DISAPPOINTED!!!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t usually write reviews, but I depend on them to buy products so I figured I should start. Maybe it&#x27;ll help someone else make an educated decision.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have thick, coarse, tightly curled/kinky hair. I&#x27;ve used Diane and Annie brushes (Diane being my previous favorite brand). This is the largest brush I&#x27;ve used which is good because it covers a lot of area in single sweep. The curvature doesn&#x27;t necessarily aid in more contact and can take some adjustment. I would definitely brush in the mirror a lot before going it blind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bristles are a mix of nylon (the hard &amp;#34;plasticky&amp;#34; kind) and boar. It looks more mixed than it feels. On the head, it&#x27;s actually a pretty hard brush, but that&#x27;s coming from someone who is a &amp;#34;begin again&amp;#34; waver and hasn&#x27;t seriously brushed in months, so for a veteran, it may not be as tough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The boar bristles do tend to fall out with brushing, but this is an issue with all &amp;#34;mixed&amp;#34; bristle brushes. I have to say that the CQP holds up pretty well overall. They don&#x27;t just shed like some other brushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, a good brush. I&#x27;d definitely recommend it. But will say this: a $25 brush will help, but the ONLY thing that creates and connects waves is consistent brushing in the same directions. Brush, brush, brush. If you got it and you want a quality tool in your arsenal? Definitely go for the CQP. It&#x27;s worth at least a try.</li>
    <li> The best brush I have ever owned so far hands down. It proves the saying of &amp;#34;you get what you pay for&amp;#34;. If you need to clean it just use hair shampoo of your choice, warm water (hot water will crack the brush), and a comb to clean. To dry you can air dry or use a blow dryer.  I would recommend it to barber shops or anyone looking to produce waves.</li>
    <li> They need to come out with some more so I can spend my whole pay check</li>
    <li> Just got this brush today and after using it, I feel like there&#x27;s really no point in using any other brush for waves.  My other brand name brush feels like it does absolutely nothing compared to this.  Very satisfied.</li>
    <li> this brush is nice i just got it on tuesday and its been sick this brush changed my waves from ok to spinin GET THIS BRUSH</li>
    <li> This brush is the DRE Beats of brushes. I could not be more impressed with this brush, it is a must have for all TRUE wavers</li>
    <li> GOT PRODUCT YESTERDAY- SON LOVES IT AND SO DOES MY DAD, SAID IT FELT GREAT ON THEIR SCALP. WILL UPDATE SOON ABOUT THE WAVES....</li>
    <li> This brush exceeded my expectations. My girlfriend practically stole one from me. Best brush ever, with a reasonable price. Keep up the great work</li>
    <li> My waves are better since.getting the brush after just two weeks for all.you wavers this is a must have. I put my waves on that.</li>
    <li> Feel good on your head , not to hard not to soft .Just what i needed for my arsenal of brushes</li>
    <li> I already had waves prior to buying this brush. I just wanted to get my crown right. I decided to go ahead and pick it up. My order took 4 days which was not bad at all. This brush is a absolute beast.At first it was too hard but after using it for about 3 days you get use to it(I think my hair thickened/grew). The brush does a substantial job with laying hair down once durag is applied, gives hair a great shine, and helps connection. The brush is heavy duty, feels as if bristles do not wear down. It&#x27;s well worth the price. Ill be getting the black medium and the red softy to finish it off.Purchasing a hard will not be necessary. I still rock with my Diane 8119(The medium,now a softy compared to the Crown). If you want to see a picture of my waves up to date follow me on twitter @DATBOYWAVY.</li>
    <li> Easy to hold and tranforms waves into a deeper pattern. I believe that the price could have been cheaper. But oh well.</li>
    <li> This brush is great for serious wavers! Its a medium and curves to the head and the boar bristles spread the moisture in ur hair to the ends</li>
    <li> I watched the reviews on youtube and customers swore by it so I had to give it a try for two weeks and I have thick course hair and this really trained my waves like no other brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  Its going to make you brush more even though you don&#x27;t need to because of the curved shape glides in sync with the curves of your head. Best brush I have every used I&#x27;m waiting on my softy now.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this brush. I love the feel of it and the hold it. I definitely think this is the top brush on the market for waves. Also  I ordered this one and a hard brush but they both came in two days :)</li>
    <li> This brush puts is money where it mouth is. I had waves in the past and it took at least 6 months to spin. Now with my CQP 360 brush I&#x27;m spinning like a top and I&#x27;m in month 2 in the wave game</li>
    <li> If u want real results this is a must have!! Believe the hype!!!! This brush enhanced my waves, just try it!</li>
    <li> Love these brushes. .. This is my second one, the first was stole so.had to get a new one assp</li>
    <li> The royal blue is the best brush of all time. It helps your connection and depth faster than the other brushes</li>
    <li> This brush is a perfect transition from the  360 Gold Wave brush soft, for when your hair gets longer--be careful with it though if you are used to soft brushed this one is a little bit harder and you might need to run some water on it to soften it up a little bit...as your hair grows though it will be good to you...</li>
    <li> Works better when you&#x27;re hair is slightly longer when you&#x27;re trying to get waves (get the Soft brush for shorter hair).</li>
    <li> i found this brush on line and was kinda iffy on getting it but now im glad i did. thanks</li>
    <li> This brush is awesome! It curves to my head, it&#x27;s hard, but probably needs to get broken into. It would be a five star purchase if the brush was cheaper.  $10-$15 would definitely be a more reasonable price.</li>
    <li> This brush is amazing. It increase the quality of my waves the first day I got it. I will definitely be buying more Crown Quality Products.</li>
    <li> A good brush that lays down your hair evenly and is very useful the price is a little costly but worth it</li>
    <li> I bought this brush recently and i do like it for what it is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is great for longer hair and even shorter hair once the brush is broken in or wet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It cuts my brushing time in half.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My wave look more developed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It handled my trouble spots.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It feels good on my head.  It makes me want to brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is way way way too expensive!  Six dollars would have been sufficient enough to actually put Diane Brushes out of business.  The brush is way better than any brush out there.  However, companies get greedy and exploit the customer. I do not agree with that. Now if the price reflects the work a companies puts into the product then I can empathize.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In conclusion,  this is a great product, but I had to tag it for the outrageous price.  Waves are never that important.  Oh, and dont get me started with the premium version of this brush.  That version cost the ridiculous price of $30.00!!!! The wood of the brush must be made from the actual Cross and the bristles are made from Jesus&#x27; beard!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Crown Quality, stop exploiting your target customers!  I see you hustle but don&#x27;t hustle your target audience.</li>
    <li> these are the best brushes ever made!!!!&lt;br /&gt;i was skeptic at first, but when receive and used them, they shut every brush that i ever bought down!!!&lt;br /&gt;i&#x27;m buying two more to keep at my job!!</li>
    <li> Definitely better than any other brush on the market hands down. I would recommend this brush to anybody looking for waves.</li>
    <li> This brush is not for everybody, i was so hyped to get it and after brushing with it for about 2 weeks i started to realize that it was messing up my connections so i threw it in the trash....I will never ever buy a brush from this company again...all i can say is any brush will give u waves...dont believe the hype...I fell victim to youtube reviews....smdh...</li>
    <li> I  read the reviews and wanted to try it out. There was only 1 left  at the time so I made my mind up fast to order. Shipped  May 31 with  free 5-7 day ship but  was at my door at june 3. Overall a good brush, I like how it has a dip in the middle so it cuffs your head almost while brushing and it has grooves  on the  sides for better grip.</li>
    <li> What can i say it the best brush made</li>
    <li> This brush is legit.. Already got results in less than 3 days!! A must have for a serious waver.. The price seems a little high for a brush but you pay for what you get and its worth every penny</li>
    <li> This Crown 360 Gold Ceaser brush does exactly what it says it&#x27;s designed to do, create waves. I guess it&#x27;s the contoured shape that covers every side of of your head when brushing.</li>
    <li> This brush is Dope!!! To tell the truth it is the best brush I ever had once you brush with blue beast there is no turning back</li>
    <li> Yes you can go to the local hair store and get a Dianne or some other brush for 1/3 of the price, but you will not see the same results.  The curve of the brush and the length of the brissels are key.  This brush will bring out your waves in the hard to manage places (crown, back, sides) and make them standout in the basic places (top, sides).  If your on the fence, make the move and you will not look back.  This is my 2nd set as I lost the 1st.  Didnt think twice after searching long and hard for my first set.</li>
    <li> i received my brush yesterday and i absolutely love it .i&#x27;ve had waves for years but after using my brush for one day i can already see a drastic change i would recommend this product to anyone who wants waves or to make your existing waves better .</li>
