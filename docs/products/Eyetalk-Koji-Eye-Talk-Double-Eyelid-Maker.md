      <li>i love it</li>
      <li>(I used Darkness for more than two years before)</li>
      <li>It would probably work better if I used it during sleep as well.</li>
      <li>Love it</li>
      <li>Now I have 1 perfectly shaped eyelid (due to irritation) and 1 without an eyelid crease that made me look like I cried all day and night.</li>
      <li>I gave this 2 stars because it was easy to remove</li>
      <li>SO I bought this glue after reviewing it in youtube and thought it would have been an easy fix.</li>
      <li>Lasts about 7hrs and touch up is easy</li>
      <li>You will smell a strong smell when you apply it.&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
      <li>Huge fan of the wand that loops onto bottle and the strength of the glue, but</li>
      <li>The first thing I noticed is that it has some kind of scent - not necessarily a bad scent.</li>
      <li>I was looking for double eye lid glue and found that this brand is actually very popular.</li>
      <li>This is the first eye glue that I was able to ever successfully use to create double eyelids.  </li>
      <li>This glue is good and is easier to work with than double eyelid tape.  </li>
      <li>It can last like 2 hours, and the smell isn&#x27;t good</li>
      <li>Easy to use, kinda last long, best eyelid glue ever.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It smelled pretty strong, like the elmer glue.</li>
      <li>The tool they give you is super helpful as well.  </li>
      <li>and  it lasts a long time product wise.</li>
      <li>If I put eyeliner near it or on it, the eyeliner (even if it normally comes off easily on its own with water) smears with it.  </li>
      <li>The best eyelid glue I have used has actually been a clear eyelash glue and that was water proof, lasted a lobg time, and looked natural.</li>
      <li>So far, I think Koji glue is the best to make double eyelid naturally.</li>
      <li>I know it&#x27;s not permanent, but it&#x27;s nice to know there&#x27;s a remedy to go back to.</li>
      <li>I have used many double eyelid glues and so far Koji eye talk is quite okay.</li>
      <li>I came off when the weather was hot one day</li>
      <li>This works pretty well.</li>
      <li>It needs skills and time to make it look not fake.</li>
      <li>The product came exactly like in the photo.</li>
      <li>remove, I just wash my face with soap and water like my daily routine, then peel it off easily, then apply another one.&lt;br /&gt;Wait</li>
      <li>If you can&#x27;t read Japanese and has never used this product before, there are instructions on Youtube and they are easy to follow.</li>
      <li>But when I apply on the correct spot, like 1 cm above my eyelashes, then it was fine.</li>
      <li>Maybe it&#x27;s the shape of my eyes in general that are not right for this product, but I&#x27;ve found the &amp;#34;Darkness&amp;#34; brand which is Korean to be way more effective for double eyelids.</li>
      <li>but i really do like it</li>
      <li>I really like this</li>
      <li>I really like this.  </li>
      <li>I was kindda worried about that, but it was gentle on the skin</li>
      <li>The consistency of this glue is more watery than other glues that I have used</li>
      <li>It is harder to apply correctly than even it appeared to be in the videos (which didn&#x27;t make it look all that easy).  </li>
      <li>This one actually works, and my double eyelid stays most of the day.  </li>
      <li>I tried this after watching some tutorials on Youtube (which I highly recommend for the novice).  </li>
      <li>I highly recommend curling your eyelashes BEFORE applying this product.</li>
      <li>Did not want to go to post office to waste more money and time to return the item.</li>
      <li>I guess it works better if you&#x27;re looking for a fake lash glue (it&#x27;s very strong in that regard), instead of a double eyelid glue.</li>
      <li>I promise, I have tried all sorts of tape available in the market, and it&#x27;s always so frustrating that they don&#x27;t fit my eye, or they hurt my eye.  </li>
      <li>It also actually looks pretty natural as the glue dries!  </li>
      <li>For me, using it consistently for 4-5 days helped the skin to produce double lids.</li>
      <li>Coz i was not sure that it was safe to use therefore just threw it away.</li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t work as well as other double eyelid glue (seems thinner), but it&#x27;s okay.</li>
      <li>The adhesive ability is great, but the double eyelid is not work for me, maybe my method is wrong...</li>
      <li>(I have sensitive skin).</li>
      <li>/&gt;So, the main rule is to apply it religiously daily for 3 months, I heard.</li>
      <li>My eyelid is very slowly starting to create a new fold.</li>
      <li>It last all day long, I really like it.</li>
      <li>For the days I put heavy eye makeups, I need to reapply the glue occasionally (2-3 times), but it is not bad because reapplication of the glue doesn&#x27;t make any marks.</li>
      <li>It did not last long and was very u natural looking.</li>
      <li>why I can&#x27;t give it full stars is the fact that the glue is so hard to get off later.  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t wear makeup very often, so I&#x27;m not very skilled at applying such thing.</li>

<li> I recommend the blue bottle Active Eyetalk of the same brand; I&#x27;ve been using that for 2 years and so far that&#x27;s the only glue that&#x27;s worked for me.</li>
<li> Then I&#x27;m screwed and have to scrub it pretty hard with makeup-remover or those makeup wipes.  </li>
<li> I realized it does not last long.</li>
<li> Tugging or pulling at the lids will cause the glue to go undone, leaving a white coat from being stretched.</li>
<li> it does not last for a long time.</li>
<li> After I did, it took less than 1 minute for the glue to dry, then start poking, then voila, new eyelid</li>
<li> It took a couple tries in a couple days to finally get a hang of it.</li>
<li> I haven&#x27;t use it for that long yet but could already see the result and am encourage by it.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
<li> However, it looks shiny, not clear after it dries.  </li>
<li> I&#x27;m still hoping for the permanent double eyelids that I&#x27;ve heard other people get from using this product.</li>
<li> Because it won&#x27;t be sticky enough to hold your lids due to the oil on your eyelids.</li>
<li> so you need some time to let it dry.</li>
<li> There are limited illustrations which do not help.  </li>
<li> Kind of disappointed...</li>
<li> and it actually does work and is less noticeable than eyelid tape.</li>
<li> This is a life saver for days my left eye wants to randomly become a single lid.</li>
<li> If only when it dried you couldn&#x27;t see it...</li>
<li> the thing is though, my eye shape is hooded and monolid/hooded on the other and the eye</li>
<li> Unlike other glues, this glue is not so visible when applied, and the eye shadows don&#x27;t stick on the glue (the area where you made crease with the glue).</li>
<li> so I purchased the active one to see if there&#x27;s a difference.</li>
<li> Not worth it at all.</li>
<li> This glue stays on for less than 15 mins.</li>
<li> I use it to correct my hidden eyelid during the day.</li>
<li> I don&#x27;t like it don&#x27;t waste your money people</li>
<li> It just looked like it was already opened used product and that applicator was missing.</li>
<li> I have not used the stickers or other similar glue options, so am unable to compare it to those products.</li>
<li> Not exactly easy to use.</li>
<li> Not pleased with the outcome.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> No complaints about this product. I use it to correct my hidden eyelid during the day. It is only a temporary fix though. If you are looking for something stronger or want to create a stronger/permanent crease, I would still suggest using double sided tape.</li>
    <li> I guess it works better if you&#x27;re looking for a fake lash glue (it&#x27;s very strong in that regard), instead of a double eyelid glue. Because it won&#x27;t be sticky enough to hold your lids due to the oil on your eyelids. I recommend the blue bottle Active Eyetalk of the same brand; I&#x27;ve been using that for 2 years and so far that&#x27;s the only glue that&#x27;s worked for me.</li>
    <li> The product came exactly like in the photo. I have used it before and this was my 2nd bottle. Easy to use, kinda last long, best eyelid glue ever.</li>
    <li> i ordered this on monday 12/1 and it got here today which is 12/3 and i got it in a cute lil package and it works perfectly! i love it and im looking forward on buying more! :)</li>
    <li> It can last like 2 hours, and the smell isn&#x27;t good</li>
    <li> After using this product for a while I realized it does not last long.</li>
    <li> Works just perfect! It last all day long, I really like it.</li>
    <li> This is a life saver for days my left eye wants to randomly become a single lid.</li>
    <li> I really like this.  This is the first eye glue that I was able to ever successfully use to create double eyelids.  I promise, I have tried all sorts of tape available in the market, and it&#x27;s always so frustrating that they don&#x27;t fit my eye, or they hurt my eye.  This one actually works, and my double eyelid stays most of the day.  The tool they give you is super helpful as well.  It also actually looks pretty natural as the glue dries!  My only gripe and why I can&#x27;t give it full stars is the fact that the glue is so hard to get off later.  If I put eyeliner near it or on it, the eyeliner (even if it normally comes off easily on its own with water) smears with it.  Then I&#x27;m screwed and have to scrub it pretty hard with makeup-remover or those makeup wipes.  The glue literally just lingers forever, I almost feel like, which can be frustrating.  If you get eyelash extensions like you do, this could definitely be a problem.  Overall I would recommend this though.  I&#x27;m still hoping for the permanent double eyelids that I&#x27;ve heard other people get from using this product.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s been about 3 months using this product. My eyelid is very slowly starting to create a new fold. It would probably work better if I used it during sleep as well. It doesn&#x27;t work well when you sweat so I purchased the active one to see if there&#x27;s a difference.</li>
    <li> Frankly, it just doesn&#x27;t work and it difficult to remove. Very disappointing and I will try to return.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like it , I don&#x27;t like it don&#x27;t waste your money people</li>
    <li> Not exactly easy to use.</li>
    <li> I love it! I have an irritated eyelid that changed the shape of my eyes. Now I have 1 perfectly shaped eyelid (due to irritation) and 1 without an eyelid crease that made me look like I cried all day and night. SO I bought this glue after reviewing it in youtube and thought it would have been an easy fix. I don&#x27;t wear makeup very often, so I&#x27;m not very skilled at applying such thing. It took a couple tries in a couple days to finally get a hang of it. After I did, it took less than 1 minute for the glue to dry, then start poking, then voila, new eyelid crease.&lt;br /&gt;You have to apply it religiously though. I did for a couple of days, days and night, and the result had shown itself, then I relented and didn&#x27;t apply it at night, then I went back to the beginning again.&lt;br /&gt;So, the main rule is to apply it religiously daily for 3 months, I heard. I haven&#x27;t use it for that long yet but could already see the result and am encourage by it.&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t hold so well if you sweat. I came off when the weather was hot one day and I started perspiring.&lt;br /&gt;To remove, I just wash my face with soap and water like my daily routine, then peel it off easily, then apply another one.&lt;br /&gt;Wait until it turned transparent before you start poking your eyelid.&lt;br /&gt;It smelled pretty strong, like the elmer glue. I was kindda worried about that, but it was gentle on the skin (I have sensitive skin). But I do notice that it cause irritation if apply too close to the eyes. What I meant is is you apply it too close to the eyelashes, then I noticed it burned my eyes, chemical? But when I apply on the correct spot, like 1 cm above my eyelashes, then it was fine. You will smell a strong smell when you apply it.&lt;br /&gt;Will buy another one if need be.</li>
    <li> Love it. Works great!</li>
    <li> Item not delivered. Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> If only when it dried you couldn&#x27;t see it...</li>
    <li> i love this and will buy again when needed!</li>
    <li> It does what it says.  Love it</li>
    <li> Perfect for eyelash glue, but not for double eyelids. Maybe it&#x27;s the shape of my eyes in general that are not right for this product, but I&#x27;ve found the &amp;#34;Darkness&amp;#34; brand which is Korean to be way more effective for double eyelids. I think I will just use this for eyelash glue only now.</li>
    <li> really crazy, i used this for 30 minutes because I was really curious and took it off because it was night time and I had to go to sleep but it lasted for 3 days. the thing is though, my eye shape is hooded and monolid/hooded on the other and the eye im trying to match with my hooded eye is already kind of hooded so maybe that&#x27;s why it works but i really do like it</li>
    <li> With age, my eyelids have begun to droop and I was hoping that this product would correct that. However, I found that this product was difficult and messy to put on, and the results looked weird. Not pleased with the outcome.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work as well as other double eyelid glue (seems thinner), but it&#x27;s okay. Comes in cute container with nice wand attachment.</li>
    <li> I was looking for double eye lid glue and found that this brand is actually very popular. If you can&#x27;t read Japanese and has never used this product before, there are instructions on Youtube and they are easy to follow. (since the instruction book contained is in Japanese) I really like this and it actually does work and is less noticeable than eyelid tape. It is also very easy to take off. Will buy more once I run out!</li>
    <li> It needs skills and time to make it look not fake.</li>
    <li> I have used many double eyelid glues and so far Koji eye talk is quite okay. The first thing I noticed is that it has some kind of scent - not necessarily a bad scent.The consistency of this glue is more watery than other glues that I have used (I used Darkness for more than two years before) so you need some time to let it dry. Unlike other glues, this glue is not so visible when applied, and the eye shadows don&#x27;t stick on the glue (the area where you made crease with the glue). There is no &#x27;white glue strips&#x27; showing on your eyelid and the glues do not clog together which can look really nasty. For the days I put heavy eye makeups, I need to reapply the glue occasionally (2-3 times), but it is not bad because reapplication of the glue doesn&#x27;t make any marks. So far, I think Koji glue is the best to make double eyelid naturally.</li>
    <li> This glue stays on for less than 15 mins. Not worth it at all.</li>
    <li> I am not happy with this purchase. This koji yet talk glue was all open, no sealed plastics, the box was opened and smashed. It just looked like it was already opened used product and that applicator was missing. I did not want to use it . Coz i was not sure that it was safe to use therefore just threw it away. Did not want to go to post office to waste more money and time to return the item. I wanted to give 0 star but without giving any star I could not submit my review</li>
    <li> Instructions in Chinese so I don&#x27;t have a clue as to how to use this.  There are limited illustrations which do not help.  When I have time I will try to find a tutorial on YouTube.  Until then I have droopy eyelids :(</li>
    <li> Huge fan of the wand that loops onto bottle and the strength of the glue, but the weird part is cleaning it off. It peels and sticks together to form a plastic squishy ball. Lasts about 7hrs and touch up is easy but beware when it wears off without you noticing, others will notice the tape like gloss! Otherwise would order again👌</li>
    <li> This was ok. It did not last long and was very u natural looking. No matter what I did or how thin of a layer I put the glue was noticable. I gave this 2 stars because it was easy to remove and  it lasts a long time product wise. The best eyelid glue I have used has actually been a clear eyelash glue and that was water proof, lasted a lobg time, and looked natural.</li>
    <li> it does not last for a long time. maybe 2 or 3 hours. then you have to replace it. Kind of disappointed...</li>
    <li> The adhesive ability is great, but the double eyelid is not work for me, maybe my method is wrong...</li>
    <li> This glue is good and is easier to work with than double eyelid tape.  However, it looks shiny, not clear after it dries.  The shine shows through eye shadow so I see a shiny line were applied.  I may try putting primer on over the line...</li>
    <li> like it, can also use for apply eye lash</li>
    <li> Delivered on time and I am happy with the product</li>
    <li> I tried this after watching some tutorials on Youtube (which I highly recommend for the novice).  It is harder to apply correctly than even it appeared to be in the videos (which didn&#x27;t make it look all that easy).  I have not used the stickers or other similar glue options, so am unable to compare it to those products.</li>
    <li> This works pretty well. I would apply a coat on the desired location and use a blow dryer for 5-10 seconds. This actually helped produce double lids overtime. For me, using it consistently for 4-5 days helped the skin to produce double lids. I have not had to use this for almost a month. I know it&#x27;s not permanent, but it&#x27;s nice to know there&#x27;s a remedy to go back to. I highly recommend curling your eyelashes BEFORE applying this product. Tugging or pulling at the lids will cause the glue to go undone, leaving a white coat from being stretched.</li>
