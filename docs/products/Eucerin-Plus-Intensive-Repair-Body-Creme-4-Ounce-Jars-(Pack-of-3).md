      <li>I tracked down as many as I could find</li>
      <li>It works better than any dry skin cream I have tried in the past - any I have tried many.</li>

      <li>I&#x27;m a dude and not such a fun of how glossy the creme appears on the skin for such a long time.</li>
      <li>I searched for products to help clear up the bumps on the back of my arm and came across this and a few other more pricey options.  </li>
      <li>This jar appears to not be available in stores that I have checked and tubes with this creme are hard to get all the contents out.  </li>
      <li>Also do not apply on face because as soon as I do so, even trying not to get any near the eyes, my eyes become instantly watery.</li>
      <li>Unfortunately it is no longer made and not available here on Amazon either.</li>

<li> Unfortunately it is no longer made and not available here on Amazon either.</li>
<li> &quot;, then don&#x27;t use this product; due to \\&quot;product contains AHA that increase skins sensitivity to the sun and that you must limit yourself for a weeks time after\\&quot;, my opinion is if you like a fast tan use this product chicks and dudes alike, or even look at other option.</li>
<li> Will definitely be buying it again since it is helping w/ the winter, dry skin problems!</li>
<li> I wash my hands quite often and the repair creme helps bring back the moisture to my very dry hands.  </li>
<li> He noticed an improvement in just a few days, his heels are now completely healed.</li>
<li> My husband&#x27;s podiatrist recommended this product for his extremely dry and cracked heels, a problem every winter.</li>
<li> It helps prevent dry sking and provides softness to skin tissue.  </li>
<li> I use baby wash with a exfoliating sponge in the bath and follow up with Eucerin Plus Intensive Repair creme immediately after they dry off.  </li>
<li> My podiatrist recommended this product to prevent dry skin cracking during winter.  </li>
<li> I have eczema and this is the only cream that doesn&#x27;t irritate my face, it is a bit heavy</li>
<li> Every other cream or lotion that I have tried just gives my baby a rash.</li>
<li> While it is a little heavier than some of the others, it makes it smoother and definitely reduces the appearance of dull dry skin.  </li>
<li> Now I have used it for the past 3 days and really no improvement on my eczema just yet.</li>
<li> Just wish the cost was a little less.</li>
<li> Does not aggravate my rosacea, and I use it year round.</li>
<li> Seems hard to find.</li>
<li> This moisturizer is hard to find in Las Vegas</li>
<li> Either Amazon re-sales used creme or Eucerin sucks in manufacturing.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s so disappointing to finally find something that works so well and then be unable to obtain it.</li>
<li> If I&#x27;m gonna subscribe to something that was poorly presented, I would rather not at all.</li>
<li> After a bad flare up I treat with a prescription cream from the doc.</li>
<li> I still have some \\&quot;chicken skin\\&quot; but it got rid of my redness and some bumps, so im going to keep using the product!</li>
<li> It seems to me that Eucerin Intensive Repair Body Creme is terribly under quantity.</li>

    <li> Great lotion that I have used in the past and will continue using in the future.  Pretty greasy when you first put it on but very good for dry skin.</li>
    <li> My boys get bumps on the back for their arms and sometimes on their cheeks.  I believe it&#x27;s Keratosis Pilaris.  I use baby wash with a exfoliating sponge in the bath and follow up with Eucerin Plus Intensive Repair creme immediately after they dry off.  It really controls those bumps, which could get out of control if I don&#x27;t use it on them after EVERY bath!!  Great product.</li>
    <li> This product is excellent.  It helps prevent dry sking and provides softness to skin tissue.  The service has been great.</li>
    <li> It seems to me that Eucerin Intensive Repair Body Creme is terribly under quantity. I have opened my package to day and once I open the lid it appears that the film was already opened on ALL of them. It also appeared to be missing a good ounce of product (and yes I did expect small containers as for it did say 4-oz but it wasn&#x27;t even filled all the way), why in the world would those to issues occur? If I&#x27;m gonna subscribe to something that was poorly presented, I would rather not at all. Either Amazon re-sales used creme or Eucerin sucks in manufacturing.

Also do not apply on face because as soon as I do so, even trying not to get any near the eyes, my eyes become instantly watery. Warning if you like the out doors, \\&quot;A LOTS\\&quot;, then don&#x27;t use this product; due to \\&quot;product contains AHA that increase skins sensitivity to the sun and that you must limit yourself for a weeks time after\\&quot;, my opinion is if you like a fast tan use this product chicks and dudes alike, or even look at other option. Personally I&#x27;m going back to Vanicream products !</li>
    <li> I bought this product for my grandaughter. She was glad I found it. I looked all over the COUNTY where I live and it was available nowhere! Then I thought I&#x27;d check on Amazon.com and there it was. Thank you for your availabilty on this product.</li>
    <li> I searched for products to help clear up the bumps on the back of my arm and came across this and a few other more pricey options.  I opted to try this.  Although I do not use it regularly it has really helped the feel and appearance of the bumps.  I would recommend trying this first before using the more $$ options.  It does feel a little goopy and doesn&#x27;t apply very smooth like normal lotion, but that didn&#x27;t bother me.</li>

    <li> My baby has eczema and after trying many things like aveno lotions even the other eucerin products didn&#x27;t work. After a bad flare up I treat with a prescription cream from the doc. and this cream maintains my baby&#x27;s skin. Every other cream or lotion that I have tried just gives my baby a rash.</li>
    <li> After 2 weeks, there was a noticeable reduction in the red bumpies on the back of my arms. I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for several years. I cannot find it anywhere but online since I found out it has been discontinued. No longer making it is truly a lose for me.</li>
    <li> Great lotion that was recommend by our dermatologist...finding it on line at a great cost was an added bonus!  Will definitely be buying it again since it is helping w/ the winter, dry skin problems!</li>
    <li> Great product. Seems hard to find. Does not aggravate my rosacea, and I use it year round.</li>
    <li> My dermatologist started me using this years ago.  It is pricey, but worth every penny.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried every brand of body creme over the years, but have found  nothing to compare with Eucerin products.  I use many (all) of their products, &amp; favor those that are unscented. Eucerin is wonderful  for moisturizing dry skin.  Also, especially recommend (by my dermatologist) for Eczema.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for severaly years!!&lt;br /&gt;Has made an incredibly big difference. My son has&lt;br /&gt;sensitive slin as do I...I use it on my face too!! A great&lt;br /&gt;moisturizer!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m thrilled to have found it on Amazon!!&lt;br /&gt;Can no longer find in stores!</li>
    <li> I really enjoy this cream. It&#x27;s really good for extreme dry skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the 6 month auto ship so I&#x27;ll have it on hand. This moisturizer is hard to find in Las Vegas</li>
    <li> I have tried many, many moisturizing creams and this is my favorite.  It keeps m,y very dry skin soft and smooth for 24 hr.</li>
    <li> My husband&#x27;s podiatrist recommended this product for his extremely dry and cracked heels, a problem every winter. He noticed an improvement in just a few days, his heels are now completely healed. Unfortunately it is no longer made and not available here on Amazon either. It&#x27;s so disappointing to finally find something that works so well and then be unable to obtain it.</li>
    <li> I searched several local stores.  I even looked in the health care store.  I found it on your web site only.  WOW</li>
    <li> The intensive repair works really well on dry skin.  I wash my hands quite often and the repair creme helps bring back the moisture to my very dry hands.  I use it after every shower on my feet.  The trick is- make sure the creme is massaged into the skin for the best results.</li>
    <li> I have used this cream for years- it&#x27;s great, so when it was discontinued I tracked down as many as I could find&lt;br /&gt;and buy them. I have eczema and this is the only cream that doesn&#x27;t irritate my face, it is a bit heavy but it soaks&lt;br /&gt;in quickly.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a long time user of this crème, and knew exactly what to expect.  I was just running out of it and thought it was time to get more.  For extremely dry skin, there is nothing better I&#x27;ve ever found.</li>
    <li> llego en perfecto estado y rapido, quisiera saber si puedo resibir ofertas del vendedor directamente para comprar mas rapido, en estos dias seguire conprando sus productos.</li>
    <li> Very effective in smoothing rough skin and also makes some plemishes disappear.  I use it regularly on various skin growths, and it definitly helps to reduce their size.  I recommend it.</li>
    <li> This is one of the best skin cremes made.  It stays with your skin for a long time, keeping it smooth.  This jar appears to not be available in stores that I have checked and tubes with this creme are hard to get all the contents out.  I am glad Amazon offers this at a reasonable price.</li>
    <li> I have tried several body creams to fight sun damage and aging of the skin.  I always come back to this one.  While it is a little heavier than some of the others, it makes it smoother and definitely reduces the appearance of dull dry skin.  Just wish the cost was a little less.</li>
    <li> My podiatrist recommended this product to prevent dry skin cracking during winter.  It works better than any dry skin cream I have tried in the past - any I have tried many.</li>
