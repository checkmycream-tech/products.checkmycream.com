      <li>I purchased this product for Christmas for my daughter and it works much better than the three-fingered glove that came with her curling wand.</li>
      <li>and she has used it many times already</li>
      <li>but I was expecting a better glove than one that looks like a showering glove thing</li>
      <li>Much better than the glove that came with my curling wand set.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I never tried any heat resistant glove. When I bought this I expected to just get a heat resistant glove. My package came in sooner than expected delivery date and I was surprise to find 2 clips and hairtie with the product. I didn&#x27;t use the product immediately when I received it. I am now writing a review to say this glove did protect me from my extremely hot curling iron (I believe my iron heats up to 420). I did notice if you have the glove against the iron for a while you did feel the iron but not as hot as how you would have felt it without the glove. Honestly, it just felt warm with the gloves on and my hand was protected well. I think this was definitely worth the investment.</li>
    <li> Good product, works well.</li>
    <li> Great quality- fast shipping!</li>
    <li> this works perfectly for my super hot flattening iron. the glve catches on my earrings, but overall, i highly recommend.</li>
    <li> It was such a fast delivery and a pretty bag it came in too!!</li>
    <li> I like the glove a lot. My clipless curling wand didn&#x27;t come with a glove, so this was definitely necessary to curl my hair safely. It was nice that they sent a number of hair bands and accessories for free too!</li>
    <li> Great for hair styling without burning your fingers or hand. Prompt delivery too!</li>
    <li> Great product.  Received very quickly, thanks.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I needed, and it came with a cute makeup bag! I am very pleased with this purchase!</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this glove! I have burnt myself countless times using those three-fingered gloves. No more burns!!! The product is if exceptional quality--especially given its low price! Told all my friends to buy one!</li>
    <li> Bought this as a Christmas gift for a quilter who appliqués, after I saw Mary Fons on tv use one to prevent burns from steam iron when doing applique. I can&#x27;t rate it because it hasn&#x27;t been used yet, but I expect it to be great. Now I see that I HAVE to rate it.</li>
    <li> Arrived on time, works well and came with a free makeup pouch. Can&#x27;t complain!</li>
    <li> We do BBQ and put our hands in 200 degree plus meat to shred it.  We put these gloves on under our rubber gloves and we can&#x27;t feel any heat at all.  Do make sure you are ordering two!  The description says &amp;#34;gloves&amp;#34; but they sell them as singles.</li>
    <li> I like this glove because it&#x27;s thin enough that I can still feel my hair as I&#x27;m curling and heat resistant enough that I don&#x27;t burn myself.</li>
    <li> Maybe I received the wrong product...this glove sucks. I bought this because of the reviews, but I am very disappointed. I can&#x27;t twist the ends of my hair around the curling wand for 3 seconds without getting the tips of my fingers burned off. And the glove is extremely way too small. Its toddler sized.</li>
    <li> it is absolutely the great it has a great fit and stretches i&#x27;ve used it a couple of times with my babyliss curling/straightening iron.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t seem to get the hang of using a comb and a flat iron togethers so I used my hand.  This keeps my fingers from getting burned.</li>
    <li> Use it daily when styling my daughters hair.</li>
    <li> This glove is okay. The material makes it hard for me to grip my fine hair. It does protect against heat well, though.</li>
    <li> This glove works pretty well.  I was able to keep my hand on the curling wand long enough to set my hair.  Much better than the glove that came with my curling wand set.</li>
    <li> This glove is great. I have extremely small hands and it fits well. I have shortish hair and always burned myself one place or another when trying to curl the bottom layer, especially in the back. This glove fixed the problem and I finally have presentable looking curly hair. Some reviewers said the glove makes it impossible to section your hair, which I guess is kind of true, it&#x27;s a little slippery. But I either take the glove off for a second if it&#x27;s being troublesome or just use the other hand, the extra ten seconds it takes doesn&#x27;t bother me...</li>
    <li> It works perfectly, and the texture gives you a nice, firm grip unlike others I&#x27;ve tried which are just too slippery or bulky. This glove is stretchy which helps with a good snug fit, and is very comfortable to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rachel C.</li>
    <li> This glover works great with my curling iron. While not completely heat proof, I find that as soon as my fingertips feel warm/hot it&#x27;s a measure of when my hair needs to be released from the iron. The glove fits well, it&#x27;s stretchy and pulls on and off easily. I&#x27;ve been using or a few months and it&#x27;s held up well. The seller also included a free gift: 4 rhinestone bobby pins, which I loved.</li>
    <li> Great product! Let&#x27;s me girl my hair without burning my hands! Love!! And great customer service</li>
    <li> bigger than my hand and a bit clunky to use.  Arrived quickly.  I wouldn&#x27;t get it again.</li>
    <li> I was very happy to receive this glove. I had just gotten my first clipless curling iron and I burnt my fingers the first time using it. I heard about these heat resistant gloves and was excited to try it out. The glove was perfect for what I needed it for. It prevented me from burning my fingers when using my clipless iron. I was very happy to receive a couple additional freebies with my package! I got a 12 pack of nice hair bands as well as a couple Jewel hair clips. I would definitely recommend this company and this product. -Tamara C.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know if my hand is too big for the glove or not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The glove was stretched so much that the heat from my curling wand went through the holes in the glove and burned me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The glove has also begun to fray after less than 5 uses.</li>
    <li> I like with othe gkive and dont burning me!!</li>
    <li> I can feel a little of the heat in my fingertips and I can&#x27;t really feel when I&#x27;m at the end of my hair shaft. Also the material snags my hair and makes it a little frizzy.</li>
    <li> I no longer burn my fingers when curling my daughter&#x27;s hair!</li>
    <li> Nice item! Fits my small hand perfectly.</li>
    <li> works great need to get another one</li>
    <li> a little small but nice hair gifts come with it</li>
    <li> Great product! The perfect companion to any wand! Flexible enough to fit a wide range of hands, plus they send you cute little hair accessories as an added thanks!</li>
    <li> This really works. I needed this because I fingers would burn while curling my hair. This is inexpensive and like I said really works</li>
    <li> Very bulky, hard to feel my hair.</li>
    <li> This glove works perfectly for using a curling wand. It takes a little getting used to, but it does a decent job of keeping you from burning yourself. I&#x27;m happy with this purchase and will continue to use the glove.</li>
    <li> I tried using the three-fingered mitt that came with my curling wand, but it just wasn&#x27;t working out.  It was awkward and I still burnt my fingers.  With this glove I can actually use the tool without fear of pain.  I can touch the wand for a few seconds and feel the warmth, but not a burn.  It fits nicely too and I can actually use that hand to pick up locks of hair, something I could not do with the three-fingered mess that came with the curling wand.  If you want to use a curling tool without clamps or combs, this is a must-have!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The glove arrived promptly after ordering, and with a nice surprise!  I hadn&#x27;t realized there would be a bonus with it, but it came with a very nice cosmetic bag.  I was very pleasantly surprised. I will do business with this company again in the future.</li>
    <li> These gloves normally costs a lot more! I have not burned myself since I bought these! They protect my hands, without getting the way. I would suggest to anyone that has experienced burns while curling.</li>
    <li> This glove is amazing when it comes to curling hair. I always burn myself when trying to curl my hair but with these, I have nothing to worry about. The heat resistance is perfect and this does not feel uncomfortable at all.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not bad but I was expecting a better glove than one that looks like a showering glove thing</li>
    <li> Worked well and protected my hands from a hot flat iron well.</li>
    <li> PERFECT !!  This glove fits my size small hand just perfect, now I won&#x27;t burn my fingers again when I try to use my new curling iron brush I just got from Amazon the other day.  Glove is very flexible.</li>
    <li> Good product, easy to use, effective. Gave 4 stars as I have long fingers and these are definitely not long enough</li>
    <li> These are wonderful people and very caring about the quality of their product.  It is terrific!  I highly recommend!</li>
    <li> Nice product!  Would recommend if you need a styling glove.</li>
    <li> Fits great, even big hands. This glove makes it so much easier to curl my hair, much better than the 3 finger one that came with my curling iron.  The iron feels warm but not hot through the glove. I just wish I had bought 2!</li>
    <li> These gloves are amazing for the price.  No more burnt fingers using flat iron. I bought a second pair to give to my stylist  she currently wears winter stretch gloves to protect hands.  Comes with a cute pink storage bag and small mirror.  Nice touch.</li>
    <li> Works great and the bag I received with it is super cute! I would definitely would recommend this glove!</li>
    <li> Luv these gloves!!! Dexterity is amazing.  I do wish they came in sizes (sm, med, etc) but I do have small hands.  For my money, the best on the market.  I use a clip less curling iron daily and find these a real time saver.  Thank you for the generous and useful free gift included.</li>
    <li> Works like a charm!  Fits well (accommodates different size hands), does the job!</li>
    <li> I bought this glove courtesy of my husband&#x27;s account and overall find that it is adequate.  It does protect my hand from burning on my heated hair devices.  I can feel heat coming through however if I have the glove near the heat source for more than a couple seconds.  I was also a bit disappointed to see a little note that came with the glove that said that the glove could melt with more than incidental contact with a heat source (isn&#x27;t the glove advertised as &amp;#34;heat resistant&amp;#34;?!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the whole, the glove is affordable and protects my hand to some degree.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t understand what all the bad reviews are about (with the exceptions of maybe some customers getting a faulty glove) but other that, it&#x27;s a perfect glove no problems yet, it does it&#x27;s purpose.</li>
    <li> Glove works wonderfully! My hand stays unburned and I can get more curls because I don&#x27;t get frustrated!</li>
    <li> Good Product. I Use It Everytime I Straighten MY Hair. I Would recommend The Product.</li>
    <li> Perfect for use with high heat hair irons, fast delivery, thank you</li>
    <li> My daughter loves it as much as me.  No fear of touching the iron and getting burns.  It fits my hand well and hers also. Has a great grip. Allows you to work with it on without it feeling bulky.</li>
    <li> Great Product. I love using my heat protectant glove when flat iron and using the curling wand on my clients. Great value for the price!</li>
    <li> I love this product and works just as it was stated! I&#x27;m a lefty, so this glove can be used for both hands. Haven&#x27;t been burnt and doesn&#x27;t tangle my hair. A great buy every girl needs!</li>
    <li> This glove works great. I have small hands and it fits nicely. It&#x27;s defibitely worth the money. Also Luck Box sent me a cute extra for free.</li>
    <li> Works great!  You don&#x27;t feel the slightest bit of heat until you have direct contact with the heat source for at least 5 seconds.  The only thing that is unfortunate is that you don&#x27;t have the same dexterity when using the glove because you can&#x27;t feel your hair as you put it into sections to curl.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never owned a heat resistance glove before, wow! Now I wonder why I waited so long! I could have missed the pain from all the finger burns I&#x27;ve had over the years. This glove works great, I use it with all my heating, styling tools. It&#x27;s not something you can just grab a curling iron barrel with and hang onto for a substantial amount of time with. It&#x27;s not meant for that, but if you&#x27;re using it as directed, it will definitely save your fingers from getting burnt while styling your hair!</li>
    <li> Product was exactly what I was looking for! No more burnt fingers! Glove fits perfect and is easy to use.</li>
    <li> This glove is awesome, I finally got to use my curler freely without getting burnt, if any damages happen to it i&#x27;ll be buying more!&#x27;</li>
    <li> I purchased this product for Christmas for my daughter and it works much better than the three-fingered glove that came with her curling wand. It is very easy to use and it is completely heat resistant. Great product!</li>
    <li> Thank you for the great understanding and quick resolution to the issue. I appreciate the honest and quick reaction. Thank you again. Great glove(s)&amp;#60;---------- haha.</li>
    <li> This product was exactly as advertised. It arrived on time and with an added gift! I have used it a few times now and I am very happy with the performance. I would definitely recommend trying this out if you are using a clip-less or tapered wand iron!</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful product! It does exactly what it is suppose to do. Great heat resistant glove</li>
    <li> Gave this to my Mom to use with glue gun. She keeps burning her fingers. Hopefully this will help.</li>
    <li> I am happy with this purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The glove does hold up against the curling iron (as long as you don&#x27;t hold it for a long time - for quick curling it is fine).  Also, the weaving of the fabric is tight enough to protect your hand (I did notice a looser weave in the fabric around the base of the thumb which I am going to be wary of). The glove is comfortable and fits well (the base/wrist is a little tight but not truly uncomfortable).  I&#x27;m not gonna lie and say I wasn&#x27;t super excited when I saw that the glove material was super sparkly, because I was (lol).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The glove also came with a small red makeup bag with a little mirror that is super cute (there were a number of loose threads but they were easy to remove and I wasn&#x27;t expecting the bag at all so who really cares).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would repurchase this item.</li>
    <li> I wish I were the one who invented this glove.  I own a professional curling iron and it doesn&#x27;t have much of a tip at the end of it,  I am forever burning my fingertips. NOT ANYMORE!  I Love my Glove!  It&#x27;s a must-have for hot styling products!</li>
    <li> the material is different than i imagined or…looks like on the site, but it def serves its purpose. i use this to wand my hair and the process is so much faster with this glove because I&#x27;m not super worried about burning my hand…i actually wish i had ordered two instead of just one. i would recommend this item and would purchase again.</li>
    <li> It does the job! I like the customer service back up for tips &amp; help. That&#x27;s always great!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s just one glove.  It&#x27;s rough to the touch, and the wrist band is thin and blocks blood flow (I&#x27;m regular weight, tall).  It&#x27;s also not fully heat resistant but protects from severe burns on the hand that wears it.  I honestly think that a regular winter cotton glove gives the same protection.  The fibers will pull from the fabric if you use velcro rollers to keep the curl in.</li>
    <li> I really want to love this, but I just can&#x27;t. I don&#x27;t have big hands- never have. However, I feel like this glove isn&#x27;t TIGHT on my hands- but it doesn&#x27;t WORK on my hand size.... my fingers got burned from using this- And I didn&#x27;t even notice it. Liek I said, I really want to love this product, however, I just can&#x27;t..... I&#x27;m sure that it works for hands that are smaller than mine.</li>
    <li> Received in a timely manner. It is beautiful and serves its purpose though I was a little disappointed because I thought I was receiving two gloves.</li>
    <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE my glove - it came with a pink and black lace case. Ever since I&#x27;ve had the glove, my hands are burned less and they feel more protected while curling my hair. I&#x27;ve gotten better and faster at curling my hair. The glove came within 2 days and was priced really good. Thank you so much!! I&#x27;m so glad I bought this!!!</li>
    <li> Resist heat but feels scratchy to touch. I also wished it came as a pair and with a non slip padding to be able to switch hands without the need to take it off and wear it on the other hand.</li>
    <li> This glove is amazing. It is thin enough that I can feel what I am doing but still thick enough that I dont get burned!</li>
    <li> Love it!!!! Now I can finally curl my hair without the risk of burning my fingers! It&#x27;s a must have.</li>
    <li> I purchased this last week to use with my curling wand this past weekend. I had made maybe 10 curls when I noticed both the thumb and pointer finger started to become extremely threadbare. I burned my pointer finger (not too badly, but enough to definitely feel it) and could barely use the glove for the remainder of my curling. I was super disappointed as I had read many good reviews before buying. I&#x27;m hoping I just received a faulty glove!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***UPDATE*** A customer service rep contacted me within hours of posting this review to immediately help resolve the issue. This company is amazing with their outstanding customer service!</li>
    <li> Glove works very well, arrived in a timely fashion with a free little carrying case.</li>
    <li> Works great and just what I needed!</li>
    <li> This is just stupid. There isn&#x27;t way to have this on your hand while separating your hair to put on the wand.</li>
    <li> I use this glove with my instyler and curling iron. I&#x27;ve been wanting to purchase this for a while and glad I finally did. I can style much quicker since I&#x27;m not worrying about burning my hand. The company also included a free gift, who ever does that! Great customer service. Above satisfied with product and service.</li>
    <li> really does the job, especially at this price! excellent job!</li>
    <li> The glove works well and has shown to be as good as another glove I had used before. It resists heat well and is easy to grip with.</li>
    <li> This was the best surprise.  I guess I didn&#x27;t realize that I would be getting a zippered pocket resembling a small makeup case to hold my mini flat iron and it contains a tiny mirror tethered to the inside of the bag.  A pretty marine blue, it appears to be heat resistant on the outside allowing you to rest the iron on it. Really for the price I would have been happy with the glove alone!</li>
    <li> Its a lil snug and i dont really have large hands, BUT it works great! I havent got burned yet and i use it quite often. Hope this helped. I would definitely buy another one! It died look the same as in the pic.</li>
    <li> It say a resistant gloves!!!!! Is only a globe, they send other things in the pack but I rather have two gloves!</li>
    <li> Awesome quality, great that the company puts free cute hair clips with your purchase, really awesome. I can not curl or straighten my hair without this product. Saves you time and from burning yourself . If you use heated stylets buy this you won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
    <li> Got a hole in it the first time I used it. On a good note, it did protect against burns....except of course, where the hole is.</li>
    <li> Great no burns now.  Great idea.</li>
    <li> After loosing the glove that originally came with my wand, I ordered this one off of Amazon and have been using this glove for about a week now. I really have no complaints, it&#x27;s a high quality glove that works just as well as the one that came with the wand. I will continue to use this glove, and let&#x27;s hope this one doesn&#x27;t get lost!</li>
    <li> This product can really fast and even came with a free headband! It works really well, but if you hold your hand too long on the hot surface, you will start to feel the heat. Other than that, it is a reallt good product and fits all size hands!</li>
    <li> Gloves came in great condition</li>
    <li> I have to say, these gloves are great especially for curling irons. I would always burn my hand on the curling iron and it would make me all frustrated. With these gloves, I never burn myself anymore. It&#x27;s also quite flexible. It doesn&#x27;t hold back my fingers at all, unlike some other gloves. It resists quite nicely, you can barely feel the heat.</li>
    <li> A bit overprice. Just as described.</li>
    <li> worked well with the curling iron we purchased.  You will not burn your hands</li>
    <li> Excellent product. Works well. Very pleased.</li>
    <li> Came very fast daughter loves it</li>
    <li> Love this glove ..it works ! And so beautifully packaged !!</li>
    <li> The glove is easy to wear and has saved me from burning my fingers!  I have a small hand and the glove fits great.</li>
    <li> I was very happy when I got my order. After several years using my curling iron and witnessing my burnt hands I can finally relax and be sure that these burns will never happen to me!!! So I definitely recommend it to you, girls!!!!</li>
    <li> I bought this glove to use when blow drying as I always have a problem with burning the fingers that are holding the brush.  No real burns...just very uncomfortable and prohibits me from doing a good job.  I was very excited when I found the glove on Amazon as I thought it would solve my problem.  And, it does...sort of.  By itself, it does very little.  But, I tried putting a cotton glove that I usually use for overnight hand treatment underneath it and--voila--success! So, I can&#x27;t in good conscience give it more than 2 stars because using it by itself--as it was intended--is useless.</li>
    <li> Awesome! I bought the clipless curling iron and tried to use it without this glove first. My fingers were very upset with me and my  hair didn&#x27;t turn out so well (try using a curling iron that you keep trying to avoid touching). Got this glove and now can use the curling iron as it should be! I can touch the hot metal for about 20 seconds before really feeling the heat which is just the right amount of time to get the curl I want. The overall transaction was smooth and fast so will definitely revisit this vendor when needing more accessories.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t had the opportunity to use it yet but I was impressed that it arrived days sooner than expected and came with a little extra surprise included as well. I have tried it on and it &amp;#34;fits like a glove&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> This glove is really good at blocking the heat and is comfortable.</li>
    <li> The glove is a big improvement over not using one and it doesn&#x27;t get caught in my hair.  I can still feel the heat, but it is quite good considering the price.</li>
    <li> love it and really helps protect my hand from the hot styling tools</li>
    <li> The new glove I received is much better and provides protection so you don&#x27;t burn your fingers. And it fits my large hands! Thanks Beautiful People!</li>
    <li> I use this glove when curling my hair with my flat iron. It provides just the right amount of protection from the heat. Now I don&#x27;t have to worry about gripping higher up on the flat iron and burning myself.</li>
    <li> Did the job! Purchased for my daughter-in-law who is going into beauty school... says these gloves go for upwards of 40-60$ on their school website! Great deal and does the job just how she wants!</li>
    <li> I love this glove, I use this glove to protect my hand, when I&#x27;m curling with a curling iron or flat iron on my clients hair.</li>
    <li> Definitely heat resistant but not heat proof...so it works as it should. Makeup case was an added bonus.</li>
    <li> Glove does resist heat but it feels scratchy on your hand.</li>
    <li> my girlfriends feels like Michael Jackson when she wears it, she straightens her hair and says &amp;#34;heee- he&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> Wow! these work pretty good!  They&#x27;re a little bulky but sooo worth not having burned fingers :).  Highly recommended!  Great vendor, prompt shipping, well packaged.  Will shop this vendor again.</li>
    <li> This is a fantastic glove!  My daughter is no longer burning her hands trying to straighten or curl her hair.  She has several friends that are going to order one also because they see how the glove really protects your hand.  It is definitely well worth the great price for this glove.  Shipping was fast and product arrived as expected.  It was a Christmas gift I bought for my daughter and she has used it many times already and it still protects her hand as good as it did when it was new.  The free gift was actually exactly what my daughter said she needed in addition to the glove so it was perfect.</li>
