      <li>And it&#x27;s a nice price</li>
      <li>Had nice brands.</li>
      <li>Definitely worth it!!!</li>
      <li>this isnt for everyone if your a person eho stays with one look ect prob not for you bit if you love make up</li>
      <li>I love the stuff I got</li>
      <li>Ehhhhh I wasn&#x27;t completely satisfied with the items I received, it was ok</li>
      <li>I love this package is like a surprise</li>
      <li>Wish it was more varirty</li>
      <li>Products were ok.</li>
      <li>but it was ehhh ok</li>
      <li>Its an ok lot.</li>
      <li>so it was ok, but would not have purchased something like this for myself.  </li>
      <li>but i love make up</li>
      <li>tje lipsticks melted from the summer heat in the mail the shadows very high quality very pleased</li>
      <li>Lots of &amp;#34;stuff&amp;#34;, but not much that was very good quality or particularly useful.  </li>
      <li>Just looking at the picture I can tell that 90% of these items I know for certain are available or were recently available at the dollar tree.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s Alright we would be nice to get a little more things</li>
      <li>you like it nice quality only thing</li>
      <li>The items were new, still wrapped and a good variety of different things.</li>
      <li>those are all the exact some ones that you can walk into a dollar tree and purchase for yourself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>only one thing was showen, I love the quality</li>
      <li>I love it all and would definitely get again.</li>
      <li>The eye pads, the eyeshadow little black books, the proffusion eyeshadow pallets, most of the physician&#x27;s formumla, all of the NYC and L.A. Colors stuff, The soft lips stuff, the uddely smooth cream, all the nail stuff except the color quick, and a good chuck of those lip glosses.  </li>
      <li>lip gloss is more for an older woman and not a teen</li>
      <li>then highly think you should order this.</li>
      <li>Everything was new &amp; shipped like 3 days after I ordered it.</li>
      <li>and it was all old makeup.</li>
      <li>I got the package early and opened it up</li>
      <li>They should really post a picture with literally 10 items because people might think 10 peaces of different brands of make up that&#x27;s what I thought</li>
      <li>i would prefer less lipgloss and my lipsticks more pink and red</li>
      <li>/&gt;This isn&#x27;t to say they&#x27;re BAD, but really, save yourself some money and just go to Dollar tree and buy them, and make sure you get colors you like and will wear.</li>

    <li> Some makeup came broken :(</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t like that some of the makeup was expire</li>
    <li> I got the package early and opened it up I love the stuff I got but the skin stuff was to dark, I got stuff that wasn&#x27;t even showed in the pic only one thing was showen, I love the quality but I think that they should email u for ur skin color or somthing and the rest be random</li>
    <li> Are the cosmetics sealed</li>
    <li> I recommend not to buy it because i thought it would come in like a lot of makeup but it came with only a little, this didn&#x27;t make my dat</li>
    <li> It was for my daughter so it was ok, but would not have purchased something like this for myself.  Products were ok.</li>
    <li> I got this and had to throw away 6 products</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t get what I was expecting half didn&#x27;t even have brands on them and it was all old makeup. Waste of money I didn&#x27;t get any products of the brands listed. It was all a bunch of junk</li>
    <li> Do not purchase this! It is terrible, mine came with tiny travel sized makeup. So I could only use a little before the makeup ran out. It&#x27;s a waste of money!</li>
    <li> I received only 5 things. Not 10.</li>
    <li> I recommend it, it&#x27;s a very good quality. People always ask me where I bought it.&lt;br /&gt;There&#x27;s a variety of beautiful make up.</li>
    <li> None of the items I received from this lot were ANY of the brands listed. Some items were repeats and nothing was name brand. Honestly disappointed</li>
    <li> Will be buying this again. Love it!</li>
    <li> I can use each color sent to me as if they had an idea of my skin color. Thank you I am glad I bought this beautiful gift for myself</li>
    <li> I was a lil worried because of bad reviews but i love make up this isnt for everyone if your a person eho stays with one look ect prob not for you bit if you love make up you like it nice quality only thing tje lipsticks melted from the summer heat in the mail the shadows very high quality very pleased</li>
    <li> I love this package is like a surprise you never know what you are gonna get you get a bit of every thing i got a bronzer and a stay matte powder the rest were 2 lip liners one eye liner 2 eye shadows abd the rest were nail polish and lipsticks and lipgloss i would prefer less lipgloss and my lipsticks more pink and red but i loved it</li>
    <li> They had an excellent selection of colors.  The wet slicks lip gloss is more for an older woman and not a teen but...  all in all, a very good buy.</li>

    <li> What an awesome deal with a lot of variey!</li>
    <li> I loved these, perfect assortment!</li>
    <li> I like what I received</li>
    <li> Its an ok lot. Had nice brands. Wish it was more varirty but it was ehhh ok</li>
    <li> There were many fake brands that I cannot even gift...</li>
    <li> i was very happy with the 10 items that were chosen for me. The items were new, still wrapped and a good variety of different things.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s Alright we would be nice to get a little more things</li>
    <li> Amazing!!! Loved it!!! Definitely worth it!!!</li>
    <li> there was only 2 things I couldn&#x27;t use but Hey to everyone giving it bad reviews... it&#x27;s pretty much a surprise lot. So u were expecting to get stuff that u didn&#x27;t plan to get. I love it all and would definitely get again. Had a little bit of eveything u need with different colors for different skin tones. Everything was new &amp; shipped like 3 days after I ordered it.</li>
    <li> This is the best thing ever. I got it for my girlfriend and she loved it, it your looking for good quality for cheep then highly think you should order this.</li>
    <li> Just looking at the picture I can tell that 90% of these items I know for certain are available or were recently available at the dollar tree.  The eye pads, the eyeshadow little black books, the proffusion eyeshadow pallets, most of the physician&#x27;s formumla, all of the NYC and L.A. Colors stuff, The soft lips stuff, the uddely smooth cream, all the nail stuff except the color quick, and a good chuck of those lip glosses.  Even each of the hair accessories (like the hair loops and the clips) those are all the exact some ones that you can walk into a dollar tree and purchase for yourself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This isn&#x27;t to say they&#x27;re BAD, but really, save yourself some money and just go to Dollar tree and buy them, and make sure you get colors you like and will wear.</li>
    <li> They should really post a picture with literally 10 items because people might think 10 peaces of different brands of make up that&#x27;s what I thought</li>
