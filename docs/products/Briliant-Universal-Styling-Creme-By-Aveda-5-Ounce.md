      <li>you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I inherited a tube of Aveda Brilliant Universal Styling Creme from my wife.</li>
      <li>This is a review of Aveda Brilliant Universal Styling Creme.</li>
      <li>, the reason for 4 stars is that it can be heavy/greasy if you don&#x27;t go easy and distribute evenly.</li>
      <li>my hair is fine blond</li>
      <li>You absolutely need to own this product.</li>
      <li>it helps smooth and soften.  </li>
      <li>Makes my hair smooth and the right amount of hold.</li>
      <li>I use Brilliant all the time; this just isn&#x27;t that really nice purfumed kind of product :(</li>
      <li>So clean and fresh.</li>
      <li>A quick combing will finish distributing it throughout, and I&#x27;m done.  </li>
      <li>item arrived quickly and well packaged.</li>
      <li>Works great with other products!</li>
      <li>My daughters hair is naturally curly but with very fine strands</li>
      <li>Shipping was fast and easy.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m talking elementary school.</li>
      <li>It has a pleasant but not very strong scent that could be used on a man or woman since it is not perfume-like.</li>
      <li>I would not suggest this as your staple hair product for ethnic hair but definitively get if you want something to make your hair soft and a pretty nice natural moisturizer!</li>
      <li>However, it is an AMAZING pre-blow dry creme.</li>
      <li>Aveda is also a company rated A+ by the Better World Shopping Guide for social responsibility and environmentalism.</li>
      <li>Very fast delivery.</li>
      <li>I also happen to think the earthy-herbal scent of this is pretty awesome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>You have to use really hot water to get it off of your hands after you put it in your hair.  </li>
      <li>The fragrance is great and long lasting.</li>
      <li>As others have stated, the fragrance is pleasant and not overwhelming.  </li>
      <li>The most important thing to realize is that if you fine, thin hair, this is not the pomade for you.  </li>
      <li>It has dried and become much coarser in the last year, so upon my stylist recommondations I switched from one aveda product line to the brilliant line..</li>
      <li>Thanks wife...</li>
      <li>It is very hard to find a good product for her hair.  </li>
      <li>I recommend it highly.</li>
      <li>A dime&#x27;s worth of cream emulsified between your palms and worked in throughout the hair gives it instant shine, reduces frizz noticeably and helps with styling.</li>
      <li>I have used Aveda products for many years, but did not know about Univesal Cream - my hair is thick, course and very frizzy -</li>
      <li>This product made my hair super frizzy and dry!</li>
      <li>that caveat aside, since I belong to the group that requires more care for my usually unmanageable hair, this stuff is a godsend.  </li>
      <li>Use a little too much on fine hair, and you may look like you dipped your hair in grease.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I have not found anything that has compared to this product as far as making my hair so soft and moisturized!</li>
      <li>really young-</li>
      <li>I have ethnic curly/kinky natural hair and was looking for a styling creme that would moisturize my hair.</li>
      <li>This hair creme works better than any on my thick, wavy hair.</li>
      <li>Definitely one of my faves for my wild hair and highly recommended.</li>
      <li>This is a fabulous item especially if you have dry and coarse hair</li>
      <li>then I use a small amount after using a light curling iron.</li>
      <li>You don&#x27;t need to use much product which saves money since a tube lasts a long time.</li>
      <li>it left my hair soooo soft!</li>
      <li>I use this to keep my dry, coarse, straight hair soft and mangaeable.</li>
      <li>I have naturally curly hair and this only requires a pea size amount for my shoulder length hair.</li>
      <li>I have to be very careful how much of this</li>
      <li>My daughter has extremely dry and sensitive hair.  </li>
      <li>Be sure to apply it little by little, or else you&#x27;ll have to wash your hair out and blow dry it again!</li>

<li> I&#x27;m 75 years old and recently stopped coloring my dark brown hair.  </li>
<li> and if I use more than a tiny amount of it my hair looks greasy and dirty.</li>
<li> In fact, you need to be really careful and only use a tiny bit.</li>
<li> In other words, if you use a little too much on these types of hair, it may disappear.</li>
<li> All is needed is just a small bead to completely tame runaway strands, calm frizz, and make it combable (such a word?).  </li>
<li> I&#x27;ve tried other brands and always come back to this basic styling creme.</li>
<li> I apply it to newly shampooed dry hair, let it dry and then use a curling iron to add a little curl.</li>
<li> My hair is probably about 1.5 to 2  inches long.</li>
<li> I get compliments from all my friends who think I am frosting my hair rather than going grey.</li>
<li> I am only half grey, but the grey hair was wiry and resistant to styling.</li>
<li> Sometimes I apply it to wet hair and blow dry.</li>
<li> I received it a few days later</li>
<li> so I am careful how often I use it.</li>
<li> I like to rub it in between my palms until it&#x27;s warmed, and then carefully distribute it through my damp hair.  </li>
<li> It weighed my hair down so much and made it look and feel worse than before.</li>
<li> Also, I know this product isn&#x27;t the cheapest, but a little goes a long way.</li>
<li> When I twist my hair up and put this on it along with my other oils and shea butter</li>
<li> usually keep a tube until I have to cut it open to get out the dregs!  </li>
<li> It&#x27;s somewhat long past her shoulders.  </li>
<li> Apply small to damp hair and blow dry</li>
<li> Using anymore than a drop may lead to a greasy mess.</li>
<li> This was too heavy for us imo.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> it works..use VERY little though!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this cream for at least 8 yrs. One tube lasts me about 15 months, but I don&#x27;t use it daily. I have short medium course gray hair. It is thick and slightly frizzy. A dime&#x27;s worth of cream emulsified between your palms and worked in throughout the hair gives it instant shine, reduces frizz noticeably and helps with styling. Sometimes I apply it to wet hair and blow dry. It&#x27;s rather expensive so I am careful how often I use it. I recommend it highly.</li>
    <li> I have to be very careful how much of this I use - my hair is fine blond and if I use more than a tiny amount of it my hair looks greasy and dirty. I squeeze just a tiny amount out and then mix it with water before putting it on my hair.</li>
    <li> This hair creme works better than any on my thick, wavy hair. It controls frizz without being greasy. You don&#x27;t need to use much product which saves money since a tube lasts a long time. I&#x27;ve tried other brands and always come back to this basic styling creme. It has a pleasant but not very strong scent that could be used on a man or woman since it is not perfume-like. Aveda is also a company rated A+ by the Better World Shopping Guide for social responsibility and environmentalism.</li>
    <li> I use this product after shampooing with brilliant shampoo and conditioner. Apply small to damp hair and blow dry then I use a small amount after using a light curling iron. My hair is color treated and over 60. It has dried and become much coarser in the last year, so upon my stylist recommondations I switched from one aveda product line to the brilliant line.. I have used aveda products for the last 30 + years and have been very happy with all the products for the many hair issues I&#x27;ve experienced. Aveda has a wonderful product line for every hair type.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful hair product. I have naturally curly hair and this only requires a pea size amount for my shoulder length hair. It eliminates frizz and adds volumn and manageability to my hair. The seller (Lowest Prices in Life) communicated well and shipped promptly.</li>
    <li> I was amazed at the amount of money I&#x27;m saving on these wonderful products very fortunate to have found such a fabulous company!</li>
    <li> Makes my hair smooth and the right amount of hold. Love it!</li>
    <li> I have premature white coarse hair. This controls my hair and leaves a wonderful shine. Love it.</li>
    <li> This is a fabulous item especially if you have dry and coarse hair</li>
    <li> This is like putting thick grease in your hair.  You have to use really hot water to get it off of your hands after you put it in your hair.  Weird.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 75 years old and recently stopped coloring my dark brown hair.  I am only half grey, but the grey hair was wiry and resistant to styling. Someone suggested Aveda products and I went searching on Amazon. I found this Brilliant Styling cream and loved it from the start. I apply it to newly shampooed dry hair, let it dry and then use a curling iron to add a little curl. I get compliments from all my friends who think I am frosting my hair rather than going grey. And my husband loves the vanilla scent!</li>
    <li> This is a review of Aveda Brilliant Universal Styling Creme. It&#x27;s best for more coarse hair. If you have fine hair, this is not the best product choice for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I inherited a tube of Aveda Brilliant Universal Styling Creme from my wife. Thanks wife... I love this stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have curly, medium-thick hair with a medium coarseness. My hair is probably about 1.5 to 2  inches long. All I need is about dime sized blob of this on one hand which I rub on both of my hands then through my damp hair. That&#x27;s it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This keeps my hair manageable without any stiffness and lets my curls do their thing. What is remarkable about this product is the depth of shine that it gives my hair. I also happen to think the earthy-herbal scent of this is pretty awesome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Worth every penny that this costs.</li>
    <li> The most important thing to realize is that if you fine, thin hair, this is not the pomade for you.  This is tailor made if you have thick/coarse/curly/ethnic/wavy/curly/frizzy/horsehair/kinky, etc., hair.  In other words, if you use a little too much on these types of hair, it may disappear. Use a little too much on fine hair, and you may look like you dipped your hair in grease.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With that caveat aside, since I belong to the group that requires more care for my usually unmanageable hair, this stuff is a godsend.  All is needed is just a small bead to completely tame runaway strands, calm frizz, and make it combable (such a word?).  I like to rub it in between my palms until it&#x27;s warmed, and then carefully distribute it through my damp hair.  A quick combing will finish distributing it throughout, and I&#x27;m done.  If I decide to blowdry, it also acts as a protectant, and just a touch more as a finisher.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I usually keep a tube until I have to cut it open to get out the dregs!  As others have stated, the fragrance is pleasant and not overwhelming.  Definitely one of my faves for my wild hair and highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I use this to keep my dry, coarse, straight hair soft and mangaeable. It helps bring in and retain mositure.</li>
    <li> I have ethnic curly/kinky natural hair and was looking for a styling creme that would moisturize my hair. When I twist my hair up and put this on it along with my other oils and shea butter it left my hair soooo soft! I have not found anything that has compared to this product as far as making my hair so soft and moisturized! I would not suggest this as your staple hair product for ethnic hair but definitively get if you want something to make your hair soft and a pretty nice natural moisturizer! Works great with other products!</li>
    <li> But I wont buy again. My daughters hair is naturally curly but with very fine strands and Im always looking for good de-frizz products. This was too heavy for us imo.  Maybe good for another hair type.</li>
    <li> Excellent Service and Product!</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! I am in love with the way it smells too! So clean and fresh. It&#x27;s a great smoother on naturally curly hair. You can use too much so it&#x27;s better to layer it on rather than glob it on. Shipping was fast and easy. Saves me a trip to a salon. (My salon doesn&#x27;t sell Aveda.)</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing. You absolutely need to own this product. I remember my mom using this product when I was really young- I&#x27;m talking elementary school. I&#x27;m in my early/mid twenties and one day I realized that this product was amazing when my mom used it years ago. Aveda isn&#x27;t carried around me, so I opted to purchase it via Amazon. I received it a few days later and I remembered why this product is a holy grail item!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can basically use it for anything. Today, I decided to throw a little bit in my hair after the shower to tame the frizz. No heat necessary. However, it is an AMAZING pre-blow dry creme. It will hydrate your hair, get rid of the frizz, and protect it. You&#x27;ll see and even smell the difference. The fragrance is great and long lasting. Also, I know this product isn&#x27;t the cheapest, but a little goes a long way. In fact, you need to be really careful and only use a tiny bit. Using anymore than a drop may lead to a greasy mess. Be sure to apply it little by little, or else you&#x27;ll have to wash your hair out and blow dry it again!</li>
    <li> This product made my hair super frizzy and dry! It weighed my hair down so much and made it look and feel worse than before. Do not recommend to anyone with coarse hair.</li>
    <li> I have curly hair and This in conjunction with Aveda Brilliant Humectant Pomade works to keep the curls together !</li>
    <li> item arrived quickly and well packaged. i use this in my hair as a finishing cream. this is the 2nd bottle i have purchased and i love it. will buy again in the future and i do recommend this product!</li>
    <li> My daughter has extremely dry and sensitive hair.  It is very hard to find a good product for her hair.  She has a relaxer and very thick hair. It&#x27;s somewhat long past her shoulders.  Some people have a problem with the scent.  She likes it.  I tolerate it.  To me it smells similar to mens cologne.  Like a woodsy scent.</li>
    <li> I saw this in a magazine a celebrity was saying is her go to hair styling cream. I like it, the reason for 4 stars is that it can be heavy/greasy if you don&#x27;t go easy and distribute evenly.</li>
    <li> I have used Aveda products for many years, but did not know about Univesal Cream - my hair is thick, course and very frizzy - it helps smooth and soften.  Really happy that the assistant at the salon I go to told me about it.</li>
    <li> Excellent product. Very fast delivery.</li>
    <li> More runny than my original Brilliant Hair Creme.  Doesn&#x27;t smell so great.  Works okay - wouldn&#x27;t rebuy.  I use Brilliant all the time; this just isn&#x27;t that really nice purfumed kind of product :(</li>
