      <li>LOVE</li>
      <li>At these prices I will definately buy more of these.&lt;br</li>
      <li>These scrunchies are very cute and worth the price, but they do have a bit of that &amp;#34;Barbie shine&amp;#34; inexpensive hairpieces often have.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s easy to put over a pony or bun to make a more &amp;#34;done&amp;#34; look.  </li>
      <li>Very cost effective and handy when wanting to just run to the store without getting all done up.  </li>
      <li>The is so easy to use.  </li>
      <li>but I followed the review to shampoo and powder and the look fine.  </li>
      <li>These things are great and this seller sells these at unbelievably low&lt;br /&gt;price, or else he was having a good sale on.  </li>
      <li>Items arrived a few weeks sooner than the seller predicted, so I was happy!</li>
      <li>So if your hair&#x27;s a light brown, it might not match that well.</li>
      <li>But I brushed it out good and it lost that fakey sheen.</li>
      <li>great little hairpiece for the price.</li>
      <li>the color of the hair is much more red than the picture.</li>
      <li>and I said it&#x27;s not my real hair!</li>
      <li>I really like it!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a pretty close match to, say, Kristen Stewart&#x27;s hair color.</li>
      <li>so I don&#x27;t wear it that much, but the effect is neat, especially if I style my hair piled on top of my head.</li>
      <li>I gave it 2 stars just to be fair about a product at such a low price.</li>
      <li>It looks really shiny when you first take it out of the bag, almost plastic looking.</li>
      <li>color matched by hair very well.</li>
      <li>looks real to me and</li>
      <li>In addition, the hair looks very synthetic.</li>
      <li>I really like this.</li>
      <li>I ordered two based on other reviews, but one would have been okay for my purpose.  </li>
      <li>This fake hairpiece arrived safely in a plastic sealed bag which was appropriate.</li>
      <li>The color was exactly as promised, it is holding together nicely (unlike the more expensive one I purchased that  was too dark, the hairs are pulling right out of the scrunchie, etc)...</li>
      <li>LOVE this little piece.  </li>
      <li>If it were worth it, I&#x27;d ship it back.</li>
      <li>It is not as full or long as described</li>
      <li>these are great for people who have thin fine hair and want a little extra hair.</li>
      <li>It looks like your natural hair.</li>
      <li>It looks natural when you wear it.  </li>
      <li>not really the right color.</li>

<li> Impossible to blend this hairpiece with my own hair.</li>
<li> This isn&#x27;t a long hairpiece.</li>
<li> it is too shiny, not as full as it is pictured (not even close to) and it is useless for me, if i was seeing this product in a store even at this low price (1.12$), I would not buy it.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s from Hong Kong and although the picture is pretty close to the actual shade of the &amp;#34;hair&amp;#34; it isn&#x27;t very curly, it looks messy, fake and not very full.</li>
<li> The hair itself I expected to be browner, instead it seemed to be lighter or with like gold/light brownish highlights.</li>
<li> It is one of the stronger scrunchies I have had, so no worries about it slipping or falling out.</li>
<li> I have bought a few of these  at  different places  over the years for my daughter.</li>
<li> Expected a fuller piece like the ones I had before.</li>
<li> It seems well made, looks natural, fairly thick.  </li>
<li> If you have dark brown hair, matches well..</li>
<li> To tone down the shine, run some shampoo through them, followed by baby powder.</li>
<li> This one was not full and it is just a piece to add around your ponytail.</li>
<li> , the color is a little darker than the photo suggests.</li>
<li> You need to have extremely thin hair for this to even remotely work.  </li>
<li> #34;my wavey, thick  hair&amp;#34; has been pulled up and I put in a clip.  </li>
<li> Unfortunately the brown didn&#x27;t quite match the brown of my hair</li>
<li> Hair looks extremely fake, overly shiny and</li>
<li> it looked way to fake</li>
<li> For the price  this  is not too bad.</li>

    <li> This hair piece is excellent quality and matched my hair color perfectly!  I was really impressed and very well made!</li>
    <li> Not as it is pictures to me..From this day forward I do not see myself buying this type of item on line!!!</li>
    <li> these are great for people who have thin fine hair and want a little extra hair. looks real to me and no one can ever tell if it is or not.</li>
    <li> These scrunchies are very cute and worth the price, but they do have a bit of that &amp;#34;Barbie shine&amp;#34; inexpensive hairpieces often have. To tone down the shine, run some shampoo through them, followed by baby powder. It works like a charm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, the color is a little darker than the photo suggests. So if your hair&#x27;s a light brown, it might not match that well. It&#x27;s a pretty close match to, say, Kristen Stewart&#x27;s hair color.</li>
    <li> I ordered two based on other reviews, but one would have been okay for my purpose.  It&#x27;s easy to put over a pony or bun to make a more &amp;#34;done&amp;#34; look.  Items arrived a few weeks sooner than the seller predicted, so I was happy!</li>
    <li> Perfect pony tail wrap, love it, thanks:)</li>
    <li> This fake hairpiece arrived safely in a plastic sealed bag which was appropriate. The hair itself I expected to be browner, instead it seemed to be lighter or with like gold/light brownish highlights. It appeared to look like &amp;#34;healthy&amp;#34; hair with a shine, no frizzies. This isn&#x27;t a long hairpiece. It&#x27;s on banding like a scrunchie so don&#x27;t be mislead by the title description because it looks similar to the photo. With my current hair color, this item won&#x27;t be worn but if I lighten it once summer arrives, it should mix in with my ponytail up-do&#x27;s just nicely.</li>
    <li> If it were worth it, I&#x27;d ship it back. It&#x27;s from Hong Kong and although the picture is pretty close to the actual shade of the &amp;#34;hair&amp;#34; it isn&#x27;t very curly, it looks messy, fake and not very full. It is one of the stronger scrunchies I have had, so no worries about it slipping or falling out.</li>
    <li> Much better than the expensive hair scrunchie that I recently purchased from Amazon.  The color was exactly as promised, it is holding together nicely (unlike the more expensive one I purchased that  was too dark, the hairs are pulling right out of the scrunchie, etc)... This is an awesome buy !!</li>
    <li> The is so easy to use.  I pull my hair up, and attaching this with a hairpin, you can&#x27;t tell it isn&#x27;t my own hair.  Very cost effective and handy when wanting to just run to the store without getting all done up.  I&#x27;d buy it again.</li>
    <li> not really the right color.</li>
    <li> These things are great and this seller sells these at unbelievably low&lt;br /&gt;price, or else he was having a good sale on.  These are so shiny and make your&lt;br /&gt;hair look very healthy looking. At these prices I will definately buy more of these.&lt;br /&gt;They are so nice and soft too.&lt;br /&gt;These are great for adding volume to your hair.</li>
    <li> they were shiney but I followed the review to shampoo and powder and the look fine.  cant beat the price.</li>
    <li> great little hairpiece for the price. color matched by hair very well. i bought 2 and put the together to make a bun</li>
    <li> Expected a fuller piece like the ones I had before. This one was not full and it is just a piece to add around your ponytail.</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t believe it when I got this and it matched my hair perfectly. A co-worker commented on it and I said it&#x27;s not my real hair! She didn&#x27;t believe me. It looks really shiny when you first take it out of the bag, almost plastic looking. But I brushed it out good and it lost that fakey sheen. I&#x27;m very pleased.</li>
    <li> I have bought a few of these  at  different places  over the years for my daughter. I like  to put her hair in a bun and put this around. For the price  this  is not too bad. I have had no issues with  it tangling and looking matted  until  my puppy adopted it for his own.</li>
    <li> Hair looks extremely fake, overly shiny and the color of the hair is much more red than the picture. Impossible to blend this hairpiece with my own hair.</li>
    <li> This hairpiece met all my expectations.  It seems well made, looks natural, fairly thick.  You can&#x27;t beat the price. I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> good to use when you put your hair in pony tail.  gives fullness of your hair.  quality of hair is good</li>
    <li> Should have returned this.  You need to have extremely thin hair for this to even remotely work.  In addition, the hair looks very synthetic.</li>
    <li> the color was to red i just didnt care for it it looked way to fake so i gave it to a friend and she liked it</li>
    <li> LOVE this little piece.  I wear it up and it looks like &amp;#34;my wavey, thick  hair&amp;#34; has been pulled up and I put in a clip.  LOVE IT</li>
    <li> It is not as full or long as described</li>
    <li> If you have dark brown hair, matches well..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The band itself doesn&#x27;t seem very strong...</li>
