<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I love it!! very good!!</li>
    <li> This stuff is awesome, love it, can&#x27;t say that enough. I like to put it on right after a bath, it&#x27;s cooling. Had a spot of persistant chapped and peeling skin, started using this stuff and it&#x27;s gone, hoorah.</li>
    <li> For those of us with oily, pimple-prone skin, this gel-creme is the best moisturizer! Also try the one with spf for daytime wear!</li>
    <li> I got this product a month ago and to be honest it&#x27;s really not bad. The product doesn&#x27;t make me break out and it leaves my face feeling super refreshed after applying the product. The only down side is that a few hours later, it makes my face really oily and shiny. My face is a combination of everything, so it&#x27;s really hard to find good moisturizers for my face. I actually stop using this because of how my face would become so oily/shiny after a few hours later. Would I recommend this? Yes I would. I understand we all are different. Even though this product isn&#x27;t for me, it could be for you!</li>
    <li> Probably the best moisturizer I&#x27;ve ever used. Goes on smooth and light, dries quickly, and is not at all sticky or greasy or oily. Heals pretty severe dryness that I get with changing seasons or over-washing, in just a day or two of use. Doesn&#x27;t block my pores at all either. A little goes a long way but if you get too much you can just spread it onto another dry part and it disappears.</li>
    <li> Tired the product as living at altitude dries your skin out fast. It moisturizes well without being too greasy to incur breakout. Would purchase again, for sure.</li>
    <li> Some people like spending $40 or $50 for a \\&quot;good\\&quot; moisturizer for their face. I don&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That&#x27;s why I bought this sweet little jar from Garnier. An ex-girlfriend of mine was in love with this stuff and I always wondered why. One day I tired it after I got some minor sunburn.&lt;br /&gt;WOW! It was great. Made my face feel cool and fresh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Instead of my face being oily or dried out it now feels just like skin. Every day. And I couldn&#x27;t be happier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only regret is not buying the bigger sized bottle.</li>
    <li> I have a new obsession with moisturizing gels because regular moisturizers are often too oily for my skin. Of all of the moisturizing gels I have tried, this is by far the best (and the cheapest!). It glides on smooth, is fast absorbing, and leaves my skin refreshed and matte. It is winter now and I find this product to be moisturizing enough even in the cold and wind.</li>
    <li> I was a huge fan of Clinique&#x27;s Moisture Surge, but took it out of my budget 2 years ago when I switched careers. I&#x27;ve been looking for a gel moisturizer ever since then. This stuff is amazing! My skin is extremely sensitive (I have rosacea on my cheeks which results in red blotchiness and bumps), dryness from prescription Retin-A, and sometimes oily chin or other problem spots. Other moisturizers (even some formulated for sensitive skin) caused my face to burn and turn hot pink or left me feeling greasy and broke my face out. I&#x27;ve had neither of these problems six months (and 2 jars) later. Just to clear up any confusion, this is not a cream; it&#x27;s a gel. Applying it is kind of like applying aloe vera, minus the stickiness. It feels smooth and refreshing on. My (acne-prone) baby sister was immediately sold when I gave her a sample and is now an avid fan. At this price (comparable or less than any major drugstore brand moisturizer), I think I&#x27;m going to stock up. If they discontinue this product, I&#x27;ll be heartbroken.</li>
    <li> My sensitive skin breaks out into pimples from most face creams, even the ones for sensitive skin.  This one works decently enough to use under mineral makeup (not too greasy, not too thin), and doesn&#x27;t clog my small pores or give me a rash.  My only complaint is the amount of fragrance. It&#x27;s not a bad smell (green apple-ish), but it is rather strong.  It&#x27;s not a cream at all, it&#x27;s 100% gel, almost identical to aloe vera in texture and transparency.</li>
    <li> This looked like a great product.  It has a light, airy texture and goes on like a dream, with a cooling, refreshing feeling on your skin.  But it has way, way, too much perfume in it.  The scent does not dissipate with time, so if you&#x27;re sensitive to artificial fragrance, steer clear.  Also, after a half hour of wearing the gel, that soothing sensation turns to a stinging irritation.  I had to wash it off.  Too bad, it would  have been a great product if they had left out the harsh fragrance.  Who wants artificial scent on their face anyway?</li>
    <li> My acne has gotten better since using this product. I use it as a night cream and as a daily moisturizer. It smells really good and is refreshing. I&#x27;m hooked.</li>
    <li> This product has been a lifesaver for my VERY sensitive skin! I have combination oily/dry/sensitive skin. I was having trouble with very dry skin and went through numerous moisturizers, all of which caused redness and irritation if not full breakouts. Using this moisturizer after the Olay regenerating serum (fragrance free) twice a day, after just two months my skin is clear and soft, with a noticeable decrease in redness and blotchiness. As a bonus, it has a very nice smell -- very cucumber-y and refreshing, not flowery or overpowering. It is NOT a lotion, so you don&#x27;t get any of that lotion residue. Even my husband has borrowed it a few times for dry skin, because you can&#x27;t see it at all. My only note would be this does not contain an SPF (which is fine with me because I&#x27;ve found the SPF ingredients usually cause breakouts for me). This gel-cream is a winner!</li>
    <li> Received as described, fast shipping good price, wife likes it</li>
    <li> I picked this up at a local dollar store as a last resort.  My skin was very dry from tanning and acne meds, and I was hesitant to use this because normally moisturizers cause me to break out horribly.  It&#x27;s fabulous.  It&#x27;s light-weight and oil free.  So glad I found this.</li>
    <li> Love it, buy it on a regular basis.</li>
    <li> First let me say that I have normal skin that is very fair and nearly flawless to begin with, however, I&#x27;d like to keep it that way for as long as possible! I bought this product because I had received a sample in the mail and instantly loved it!! It absorbs so quickly and is so light and literally \\&quot;refreshing\\&quot;! Your skin feels amazing, it looks amazing and the light fragrance just seems to complete it. I got mine at Wal-Mart for under $7 I believe. I use this before going to bed and when I wake up I use it under the Moisture rescue lotion with SPF in it (which is also a great product). I hope this stuff stays with us for a very long time, but I&#x27;m stocking up just in case! Would ABSOLUTLEY recommend this to everyone!</li>
    <li> This is an awesome product that I recall buying while living in Palm Dale Ca...a very very dry desert part of Southern California. The ingredients in this product are much the same to this wonderful hair &amp; facial moisturizer that I would spray like water on my thirsty face &amp; hair...it cost me a fortune from the salon! This stuff does the same magic with skin thirsty for moisture...no grease just pure liquid that your face absorbs on contact! Love it!</li>
    <li> I have just started using this Gel.  It feels great going on and seems to melt into my skin.  I hope I can find such a good price again when I empty this jar.</li>
    <li> Amazing soft skin,last along time!</li>
    <li> My cheek hurt when I use it, although I really like the smell.But maybe that&#x27;s because I have sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> I love Garnier&#x27;s Moisture Rescue Gel-Cream!  It goes on smoothly, feels lightweight, absorbs quickly, and doesn&#x27;t feel oily on skin.  I have a combination normal/dry skin, and I haven&#x27;t had problems with breakouts on my normal patches or with my dry patches not getting enough moisture.  This moisturizer takes care of both qualities of my skin!  I&#x27;ve been using the Garnier Moisture Rescue Gel in conjunction with the Brusher Cleanser Gel and my skin feels soft and amazing!  Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> I have never written a review before, but I had to for this product.  You only need a little bit to go a long way and the way it feels is incredible.  It&#x27;s very moisturizing and leaves my skin feeling incredibly soft and supple.  I have used so many other moisturizers and this is the only one I&#x27;ve ever loved.  I hope they keep it for a long time.</li>
    <li> I love this product and I have super oily African American skin. I hate heavy moisturizers and this one is so light weight it is refreshing to my face after I wash my face. I still use a spf 40 that is light weight over it, and it doesn&#x27;t feel like I&#x27;m wearing anything. I love the scent and how natural it is. I highly recommend this product. Also I just purchased the eye roller today and I&#x27;m sure it will be amazing.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s really helpful with my dry skin ,</li>
    <li> great product, my skin looks healthier ... but just to also throw this out there because it might not be just the moisturizer, but I also made a diet change.. I drink at least the recommended amount of water (64oz) and I never skip breakfast. Oh, plus I cut out sodas and cut way back on drinking.. been using this product plus diet for little over 2 weeks now and my skin is noticeably smoother. I need now to only wash it at night (to remove makeup) and when I wake up I just rinse with water and reapply a fresh coat of moisturizer and only need to use a a light coat of powder :) I will definitely be buying this item again.</li>
    <li> Very soothing and moisturizing gel liquid that feels like a splash of fresh water on your face. I use it after any facial procedure and also every day in a regular basis. Very affordable price to compare with other brands similar products.</li>
    <li> It feels good when you lather it on but then it dries making your face feel dry as well.</li>
    <li> This moisturizer feels cool on your skin and dries quickly, which makes it my favorite morning moisturizer to put on right before primer. It has a fresh scent which matches how it makes your skin feel. No negatives to mention.</li>
    <li> This is the worst stuff you could put on your face ladies. I just bought this and didn&#x27;t have my glasses on to read the ingredients . So figured well its moisture rescue so shouldn&#x27;t have no alcohol in it..put it on my face and nothing absorbs in the skin that fast . I new I was sucker punched..wow only thing that can dry that fast is alcohol ..get home and look at the ingredients and yes the 3rd ingredient is alcohol denat ....omg why would you put this crap on your face its the same stuff they use for paint thinner..keep using this stuff and you will look old at a younger age ..what a joke..it will dry your face out ..how can they call it moisture recuse. They put that in there so you think its absorbs in the skin when its not its drys as fast as it hits air..and on your face..can&#x27;t believe everyone loves this they got you fooled</li>
    <li> I love this moisturizer! :D I decided to give it a try a month ago, and this gel-cream removed the dry flakes on my face! My face was so dry, and applying the gel-cream has improved my face! It is soft, and refreshing! &#x3D;) I love it, and I fully recommend to those with dry face.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m the type of person who gets bored with products and/or is very particular about what I put on my face.  I have acne prone skin, so I&#x27;m very careful about anything that&#x27;s heavy or thick or is likely to clog my pores and cause more breakouts.  I use acne medication that really dries out my skin.  Add to that the dry air this past winter and I looked like a prune.  In the space of a few months I suddenly had fine lines around my eyes!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, that wouldn&#x27;t do, obviously.  I bought about 5 different products, anything with the word \\&quot;moisture\\&quot; or \\&quot;hydration\\&quot; in the name.  My skin was still dry and some of them gave me zits because they were too thick and heavy and coating.  Then I found this gel.  Thank God.  I just purchased my third container yesterday. That&#x27;s noteworthy because I usually don&#x27;t buy anything twice.  My skin looks/feels great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This gel is moisturizing and yet extremely lightweight.  I don&#x27;t feel like I&#x27;m coating my face with anything that might clog my pores.  It leaves no residue or film.  It feels like I&#x27;m putting water in gel form on my face.  It&#x27;s got a nice scent.  Sometimes if I&#x27;m not going out during the day, I&#x27;ll use this in the daytime too because I like it better than the Moisture Rescue day lotion. The closest thing to it is H20&#x27;s Oasis gel moisturizer, but this is 1/3 the price and I feel has more beneficial ingredients in it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also use the Moisture Rescue day lotion with SPF (which is lightweight, moisturizing and non-clogging) and I just bought the Moisture Rescue face wash (which feels creamy and non-drying and is awesome).  I use a lot of the gel cream so I run out of that more quickly, but a single jar will still last you a decent amount of time, 4 months or so.  The day lotion lasts a crazy long time.  I bought mine in February I think and it&#x27;s only half gone, although like I said I don&#x27;t use it every day.  You also need to use only a dime size of the face wash and you get a huge tube, so I expect that will last a long time too.  For the price, you really can&#x27;t go wrong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m now turned on to Garnier and will be buying their retinol eye cream next :)ime too.  For the price, you really can&#x27;t go wrong.      I&#x27;m now turned on to Garnier and will be buying their retinol eye cream next :)</li>
    <li> This is my favorite moisturizer. I use this as a day cream under my make up as well as night cream. I love that it is gel because it absorbs so much faster. I&#x27;ve been buying it for the past two years and I can&#x27;t switch back to creams. This spoiled me. I have oily t-zone and this doesn&#x27;t make my face oily at all but it does take care of my dry areas. I love this moisturizer and I will continue using it!</li>
    <li> I use this with other garnier face products and it does well, but I do feel that there are probably some better creams out there for moisturizing.</li>
    <li> Left my face feeling light and breathable and it&#x27;s got a nice fruity smell.</li>
    <li> this Garnier Moisture Rescue Gel Cream gives you a cool and relieved face. I use it when Im stressed and its at my desk. I splash my face with water and add my gel and instantly Im relieved of that frown face. I have issues with menopause so if you know what I mean when that hot flash hits me I go for my jar of GARNIER RESCUE GEL and indeed I am relieved . I get instant moisture and a cool tingle . gloria</li>
    <li> I have never written a review before, but this product is so amazing that I felt compelled to write my first one. I have extremely oily, sensitive, and blemish-prone skin, so it goes without saying that I am weary when it comes to using moisturizers. They have the tendency to make me break out and make my face feel greasy. I purchased the moisture rescue gel cream on a whim and ended up falling in love! It goes on like silk, absorbs quickly, and leaves my skin soft, smooth, and hydrated. Plus, it doesn&#x27;t make me oily or cause any breakouts! Perfect for sensitive skin. I will never use another moisturizer again! Thank you Garnier for making such an amazing product!</li>
    <li> I have dry &amp; sensitive skin, so I have to be very careful what I use on my face- I have broken out in rashes before from facial products. This product is gel-like, smooths on easily &amp; makes your face feel wonderful. It dries quickly &amp; leaves no oily residue or build-up. Smells wonderful too, an herbal fragrance, but not overwhelming. My face feels soft all day. This is wonderful stuff that I would recommend to anyone, especially anyone with problem skin.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about 6 months now and I just love it.  It&#x27;s light, airy, has a slight cooling effect, and even brightens my skin a little.  I use it in the morning and at night.  It really is a cross between a gel and creme.  Despite the color, it is a translucent color when applied to the skin.  It comes in a rather small jar, but it lasts a really long time.</li>
    <li> I used this during the summer months and I felt it provided decent moisture.  The grape scent is fairly strong at first, but wears off quickly.  This isn&#x27;t a miracle cream or anything like that, and if your skin is extremely dry then you&#x27;re better off using something else (like me now that it&#x27;s winter).  But it works for a quick boost of moisture, AND it&#x27;s rated well on goodguide-dot-com (a major plus in my book).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By no means is this a replacement for Clinique Moisture Surge, but it&#x27;s a good fake-out for a fraction of the price!</li>
    <li> Bought by my boyfriend because my skin has been a little tight and dry lately, product of a very cold winter. This does the trick moisturizing wise. Leaves you with a great cooling feeling right after applying and you only need to use a small amount for your whole face and neck( i shake it before using and just use a little from what sticks to the top of the container). I use a powder foundation and i found a couple hours after applying my skin is a little oily in the T-zone, which normally wouldnt happen without the Garnier Refreshing Gel Cream, but i just blot and bye bye oily shine. Im also prone to breakouts and this has not affected my skin acne wise, but i would say is making my skin alot smoother. Over all it&#x27;s a good product, just use sparingly especially if you have oily skin.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this..Makes your skin feel amazing. Can tell a difference after one use. This a must have product for me now.</li>
    <li> I live in a very hot and dusty place, and can&#x27;t stand any da creams on my face if they leave oily feeling on my skin. This product is perfect - it moisturises the sking and leaves absoultely no oily after-effect, this is exactly what I needed. It s almost fragrance-free which is also great. Totally satisfied with the quality, and great value for money. Love it!</li>
    <li> I bought this at my local grocery store after reading the reviews on amazon. This stuff is the best. It leaves my skin feeling so hydrated. Plus alittle goes a real long way. I started using it about two months ago and I see drastic change in my face. I use it every night and when I put it on it sooths my skin almost because it is so cool feeling. It smells wonderful too. I love how it makes my face look like a glow as if I&#x27;m so happy. Probably because my skin is happy. I can honestly say when I wake up in the morning I have no pimples and my skin is not greasy or oily.... When you sleep you loose so much water but this balances everything out. I only use it sometimes during the day, but I don&#x27;t prefer wearing it during the day just because I don&#x27;t wear makeup and I don&#x27;t want to over use it plus I&#x27;m satisfied with how much it works at night time to where I think it makes a differnce during the day. Plus the stuff I use to wash my face keeps my face good through the day. I recommend people to buy this.</li>
    <li> I used this as a night moisturizer.  When I wake up in the morning, my skin feels tight.  When I wash my face in the morning, it is like the product is still sitting on my skin.</li>
    <li> The gel is so soft and makes my skin feel like velvet! It doesn&#x27;t leave any residue and a little bit goes a long way! I use mine every day, twice a day and it&#x27;s still almost full (I&#x27;ve owned this for about a month). I don&#x27;t break out from it and it really works well under makeup (I recommend letting it dry before putting makeup on though). The seller packaged it well and I recieved it the first day it was expected to come. Very happy with both product and seller :]</li>
    <li> I love how lightly scented the gel is. At first I was skeptic, but I found that it was worth it. Such a small amount goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a great gel if you are on the go and need to take it with you. It really helped my acne and it isn&#x27;t oily at all. It also helped with the flaky skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But, if your skin is already oily, make sure to give it a little rinse later in the day to help fight the greasy stuff.</li>
    <li> There is none better-- smoother, cooler and even more moist than pure water...</li>
    <li> I live in an extremely humid and hot climate, and love this stuff as moisturizer for the spring and summer. I&#x27;m about to finish my second jar and will definitely be repurchasing this to go with a nice sunscreen for my daytime routine. By the end of the day, I definitely feel like I need to wash my face, but it is nowhere near as oily as other moisturizers tend to make it.</li>
    <li> I have really oily skin, so I have always steered clear of moisturizers on my face, as I don&#x27;t need any more help in the shine department.  I saw an coupon for this in the Sunday paper, and was intrigued because it was a gel, and I had heard gel moisturizers are great for oily skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I picked myself up a jar of this and tried it... It worked just like it claims. It felt very refreshing and glided on my skin like silk, quick to absorb, and NO oily feeling and no residue left behind. It smells FANTASTIC. I just can&#x27;t get enough of the scent.. I wish it was just a bit stronger so I wasn&#x27;t the only one who could smell it. In fact, I wish they&#x27;d use this scent in all their products, or even have a body spray of it. It&#x27;s light, refreshing, and clean smelling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price can&#x27;t be beat for a product of this high quality. Why spend big bucks when this works beautifully? I can&#x27;t wait to try their other skin care products if this one is so fabulous.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: It appears they changed the formula when they changed the label. It smells bad now, whereas I used to love the scent so much, I would have bathed in it! I hate the scent so much now that I can&#x27;t use it. Bummer!</li>
    <li> I really love this product, nice smell.&lt;br /&gt;Leave smooth feeling and never feel dryness, last for all day long.&lt;br /&gt;I bought 4 bottles in 5 months.&lt;br /&gt;Use it everyday, twice daily.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m allergic to lots of products so never try new stuff but I got a sample of this either in the mail or in a magazine (somewhere!) and absolutely love it. I use a heavy cream at night and use this during the day (I live in Miami so heavy cream is a nightmare during the day) and it&#x27;s just perfect.</li>
    <li> This is the best moisture cream I have ever used and inexpensive. It&#x27;s not oily at all and make your skin smooth.</li>
    <li> Moisturizers skin quickly.  I applied at night and by morning my dry skin was almost completely repaired.  However, this also made my skin break out terribly.  Every time I use it my skin has broken out with many pimples only in the area I have applied this moisturizer.  Do not use if you have oily skin.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this moisturizer for a yearish, and it works super well. My skin loves it.</li>
    <li> Extremely moisturizing and cooling. Perfect for moisturizing winter skin or battling tropical weather. I live in year-round tropical weather and with the extreme humidity and dryness, this refreshes and cools off my skin. Feels great, and glides on smoothly.</li>
    <li> Years ago I used a Loreal moisturizer that was very similar to this one. To my dismay it was discontinued. I never found a perfect alternative until I stumbled upon this Garnier product. It is perfect. I can&#x27;t use many things because my face is oily and many moisturizers tend to add to the problem. Even with oil-free lotions, they tend to add to my trouble and leave my make-up looking shiny and oily before lunchtime even comes. This is a great product for those with the same trouble. It&#x27;s gel based formula is absorbed into the skin nicely, make-up applies smoothly and evenly and looks great all day. I don&#x27;t even use an additional eye gel, this is sensitive enough for the entire face!</li>
    <li> I have had this product for at least a year and a half but haven&#x27;t used this product until this past summer when I was looking for a lighter moisturizer and realized I should thoroughly test this product out. It worked well, my face never felt dry and it has been a great moisturizer for the summer. However, about a two months into using this product I realized that the product seemed to be evaporating because more and more was gone each day, at a much faster rate than I was actually using on my face. I never left the jar opened past the 20 seconds it would take to moisturize my face, yet the product still evaporated.  I lived in New England this past summer and there were only a few \\&quot;hot\\&quot; (85 &amp; above) weeks. It seems like unless you keep this product in an air-conditioned room over the summer, it evaporates very quickly. For spending $8 on 1.7 oz of moisturizer and have it a lot of it evaporate if you live in an non air-conditioned home does not seem like the best price.</li>
    <li> Love the feel of this moisturizer, especially for summer!</li>
    <li> Non oily! Great for my oily skin. Will use nothing else! I have tried the name brand Clinique and all I can say is save your money and go with this!</li>
    <li> This is by far my favorite moisturizer. It goes on silky and doesn&#x27;t feel sticky or heavy.</li>
    <li> This gel-cream is not really a cream, but pretty much just a green gel. Not to say that it doesn&#x27;t work well, though.  My skin type is normal, but I do get oilier patches in the summer and drier patches in the winter. What I would recommend this moisturizer for is mainly for the summertime only. I found the lightness and coolness of the gel to be refreshing on sunburnt and oily skin.  As for performing in the winter time, I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s enough to cure dry skin. I&#x27;m having to moisturize twice a day now, and I still have patches of dry skin.  So really, this is a product for people with oily skin or for those whose skin gets oilier in the winter. Because it&#x27;s just not creamy enough to attack dry skin, but it&#x27;s light and airy enough to sit on oily skin.  Also, for those who are wondering, the smell of the gel isn&#x27;t too strong. It just smells like grape seeds.</li>
    <li> I love this moisturizer!  I had been using a high-end moisturizer ($98 for 2oz) and this works just as good.  Picked it up at WalMart for less then Amazon too.  I&#x27;m hooked!</li>
    <li> This was perfect when traveling through hot, dry Utah and Arizona! I still keep it on hand because it is a nice base moisturizer. It doesn&#x27;t seem to improve my skin overtime but keep it from being dry. On daily basis I prefer my Aveeno ultra soothing daily moisturizer. It arrived fast and is a good product that my daughter and I will use again!</li>
    <li> One of my favorite products by far. I hate how most face moisturizers make your face feel oily or caked on. This dries super fast, feels so light and after it&#x27;s dry you forget you put anything on. Also, my face is SUPER sensitive but I had no breakouts, redness or itchy feelings with this. LOVE LOVE LOVE this product.</li>
    <li> + lightweight&lt;br /&gt;+ cooling&lt;br /&gt;+ absorbs quickly&lt;br /&gt;+ skin smooth not greasy&lt;br /&gt;- slight scent (doesn&#x27;t bother my sensitive skin)&lt;br /&gt;- jar is glass ( while I like it, tile doesn&#x27;t)&lt;br /&gt;- doesn&#x27;t wear well under makeup&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall nice and I prefer a gel over lotion. In the past I have purchased a certain brand that offers a gel and this is a much more cost effective product with the same results. I have dry skin in some areas and others can get really oily. Gels always seem to balance this issue without being heavy or added to oil.</li>
    <li> One of the best with its cool feel on the face</li>
    <li> Its not oily and its smell really good. It makes my skin soft and smooth. I put it on my face at night and when I wake up my face is dewy.</li>
    <li> Works great for acne when mixed with tea tree oil and jojoba oil. Much better than anti-blemish lotions from bigger brands.</li>
    <li> Only moisturizer that doesn&#x27;t make my acneic combination skin flip out and overproduce sebum. Very light and fresh. I love it, definite repurchase for me.</li>
    <li> Pros:   This product feel super great on my face.    It absorbs quickly and doesn&#x27;t leave behind that filmy feeling that some moisturizers&#x27; will.     I thought this product was the one...  Cons:   ... until a few weeks later when may face developed a few giant, painful zits.    So I stopped using it and my skin is slowly, but surely going back to normal.    Smells good. Its just a bit strong and perfume-y.</li>
    <li> Love this moisturizer. I have oily skin so I needed something that would give me the moisture I needed without the greasy feeling. This product is light but provides the nutrients my skin needs. It good for the summer underneath foundation. I have also used it underneath my tinted moisturize and it didn&#x27;t leave me feeling greasy. They were quite compatible. I would highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I was hesitant to buy such a cheap product, especially since I have not liked other Garnier products in the past. After reading so many positive reviews I gave it a try. This is a wonderful gel to use at night; it keeps my skin healthy and it doesn&#x27;t clog a single pore. I can&#x27;t use most creams because they give me those little white bumps around my eyes, called Milia, plus an overall general breakout. Zero irritation here, no burning or bumps, it&#x27;s just effective. And one little jar has lasted me for awhile. The UV cream version of this is wonderful for the daytime, and together they have become beauty staples for me. Before these products I couldn&#x27;t find an moisturizer that worked for me, but even oily skin needs moisture.  I&#x27;m 35 and I still get acne (my parents used to steal my Clearasil when I was a teenager, so I figured it would happen to me, too). For those that know my pain, it is difficult to stay acne free while we begin to fight the signs of aging. Although it is not labeled as an anti aging product, use this regularly and you&#x27;ll find an overall difference in your skin texture. The first night I put it on I wondered if it would be effective enough, but give it a few nights and your skin will feel healthier and more youthful overall.</li>
    <li> This &amp;#34;cream&amp;#34; is horrible! I should have read the ingredients before I bought it. It has alcohol as one of the main ingredients, which literally burned my sensitive skin. My face was chapped and very sore after using this product. I does not moisturize AT ALL. I had scabs and my face even scarred! I am so disappointed with Garnier and will not be purchasing their products in the future. This cream is a hazard! If you have sensitive skin DO NOT purchase this product! I would give zero stars if I could! A total waste of money!</li>
    <li> love the smell and how it feels going on. not greasy at all</li>
    <li> I used this today and it&#x27;s great. Honestly. It feels like I&#x27;m putting aloe gel on my face, but leaves my skin soft and fresh feeling. It&#x27;s not oily, which is great, because I have combination skin. I highly recommend this product! :)</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t need to mention it again. It&#x27;s just the best product for summer season. It&#x27;s drug store version of Clinique&#x27;s gel moisturizer. I love it so much!</li>
    <li> This is one of few moisturizers that I can apply around my eyes without feeling irritated. Nice scent, highly recommended!</li>
    <li> I absolutely DESPISE using lotion because of the sticky feeling it leaves after. However, I have very dry skin, so this poses a problem. I bought this stuff to see if it was any better, and I love it! It feels nice on the skin and dries without leaving any nasty residue behind. I just got it so I&#x27;m not sure how well of a moisturizer it will be (I have eczema), but it seems to be helping just from the few times I&#x27;ve used it. It&#x27;s a small tub, but a little goes a long way. I use it on patches of dry skin on my arms. I don&#x27;t know how well it would work as a body lotion because I feel like you&#x27;d have to use more of it and it&#x27;d get expensive after a while since the jar is so small. Anyway, I recommend it! It smells nice too.</li>
    <li> When I think of gel, I think of hair products! And since I&#x27;ve never known gels to moisturize the skin, using this was even more alien to me!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But wow.. this has actually proven itself to pack quite the efficient punch! The gel is slightly opaque with a nice cool color of mint green. The gel feels as cool as it looks and isn&#x27;t thick like a tub of hair gel, but it certainly isn&#x27;t runny, though you may get some gel on the underside of the jar&#x27;s lid if the jar is placed at an angle or upside down. The gel is also completely scentless!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let me just say a little goes a LONG way. Usually when I put lotion on my face, I put a little dollop in my hand, rub my hands together to warm it up, and spread it onto my face. Because this gel requires so little to go a long way and absorbs quickly into your skin, I simply dot my face with the gel and that meager amount is enough for my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Within a minute, the gel is completely absorbed, readying my skin for some sunblock. Before I used to use Cetaphil moisturizing cream and as fantastic as that cream is, it&#x27;s a little too thick and rich for my daily needs so I&#x27;d have to wait a few minutes for it to fully absorb to put on makeup otherwise if I put on makeup with the lotion still sitting on my skin, it&#x27;d LOOK like I have makeup on my skin. Cetaphil is great, but I think its richness is better for using at night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m very glad I bought this gel, it&#x27;s perfect to use before a day out. My skin is in great condition thanks to my daily use of Vitamin C on my skin and thanks to abiding by the rules of The Japanese Skincare Revolution by Chizu Saeki so I&#x27;m used to my skin looking a nice way and didn&#x27;t think my skin could look any better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Though my skin is firm and smooth with the use of my regular moisturizer, Cetaphil, I&#x27;m surprised to see a difference with Garnier! The luminosity I&#x27;ve gained from the use of Garnier is absolutely flattering. My skin looks so smooth and glows! All this time I thought the richer the better but this gel cream has taught me that less is more! It&#x27;s so light yet my skin is quenched!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this moisturizer!</li>
    <li> This is nothing but watered down lotion. It is just water. It does nothing for my skin. I&#x27;ve been using it for a couple of days now and see no difference in the baginess of my eyes or moisture to my skin. Nor does this make my skin feel softer. I prefer the olay/loreal face lotions over this. I took a chance on this due to the other reviews even though if you look at the ingredients there is nothing in it that would help your skin like peptides, acids, etc. I do not recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I enjoyed this moisturizer more than I expected; that being said, I&#x27;m not sure I will re-order it. I have slightly dryer skin, and I did not think this would be strong enough. It is, and has a very pleasant cooling sensation while putting it on. I marked it down because this does not soak into your skin like a lotion - it sits on top of it. If I absently rub my face anywhere, I can still feel it on my skin and it flakes off, which grosses me out!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I do re-order this, it will only be for summer because of the nice cooling sensation and lightness, but I probably will not because of the gross flakiness.</li>
    <li> this is my second bottle , it works magic, love, love, love it</li>
    <li> I get itchy, red rashes from oil of olay sensitive, so I was worried about whether this would do its job.  I love it!  Glides on easily, dries fast, and leaves my skin soft-without the itchiness of other moisturizers!  No more search for a moisturizer that works AND feels great!  Thank you Garnier, for a great product that really does its job!</li>
    <li> So i was looking for a cheaper alternative to my department store brand.  I cant say this made my skin super soft, but it did soothe the flakiness i was experiencing. Its very cooling great for the summer.  It is very light and smells good.  I will probably go back to my department store brand, but if im ever in a finacial bind id probably purchase this again.</li>
    <li> I am all about gel moisturizers because I find that the majority of non-gel creams out there give me a filmy/sweaty feeling on my nose and my upper lip area. I absolutely abhor this feeling! This gel cream is a great alternative to what I used to use: the Clinique Moisture Surge moisturizer. The Garnier Gel Cream absorbs quickly and definitely is enough moisture for me. I have combination skin and am usually only oily in the T-zone area. I love this stuff and it smells so great!</li>
    <li> I really like this moisturizer. Its lightweight and different than most. Its a gel that dries clear and non-sticky. Its hard to find, so I applaud Amazon for carrying it!</li>
    <li> I tried this cream for a week and my skin became extreemly dry ,flakey and cracked, it did the opposit of moisturising, it felt like my skin was dryer than it ever was in my life, it just did not work for me, the smell is very nice and when you rub it  you feel like you&#x27;re rubbing water on your face, it&#x27;s nice for a few minutes and then there&#x27;s no real effect for it.&lt;br /&gt;I would not recommend this to anyone.&lt;br /&gt; my skin is normal with a semi oily T-zone.</li>
    <li> This is the best moisturizer I&#x27;ve ever used. It keeps my skin so hydrated and soft, I love it. I use it every day and night.</li>
    <li> I have tried many moisturizers to soothe my dry acne prone skin. If you guys have acne prone skin, you&#x27;ll understand how dry your skin can get after cleansing your face. It got to the point where if I don&#x27;t apply moisturizer after cleansing I end up looking like a fish sun tanning for hours, My face all flaky and dry and terrible. This Gel-based moiturizer is by far the best moisturizer I have ever used. I highly recommened this production. Bottom-Line, if you suffer dry skin and need something that works? Run to your nearest walmart,target or CVS and try it for yourself. You won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
    <li> I live in Hawaii, this works perfectly in this humid climate. Nice &amp; cool, not greasy.</li>
    <li> I have dry skin with oily patches on my chin and nose. This gel-cream is kind of watery - absorbs quickly not leaving any effect on my skin at all</li>
    <li> Wonderfully clean smelling, does the job without feeling greasy for my combination skin.  Would highly recommend to anyone with combination or greasy skin.</li>
    <li> This product works very well. It&#x27;s reasonable and a little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> I love this product... I found a sample in Glamour magazine and had to buy it from Amazon. It seems that none of the other stores carry this product..</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for years. My local grocer stopped carrying them, so I stockpiled up because my face is so dry without it.</li>
    <li> I bought this because I had read on pinterest this was a great dupe, to Clinique&#x27;s moisture surge. Well..its not. It is a really nice product though, just not the same. I love that its a gel, its lightweight, light moisturizer (excellent for summer). But it doesn&#x27;t have the power Clinique&#x27;s does at all. I sometimes have to apply this twice. It does take it a while to dry on my face or soak up like. Im still pretty happy with this. I like it for my hands too! Its not greasy, feels very clean.</li>
    <li> I liked how easy it was to apply and the nice  way it. Felt on the skin and the price was a bonus</li>
    <li> This product moisturizes quite well, absorbs quickly, and has a very light, pleasant scent. The only issue I have here is the price point. You could easily go through this jar in a few days to a week. Garnier is going to have to change its price point and make this less expensive, or offer more product. Otherwise I have a feeling this will be discontinued.</li>
    <li> My skin is more on the combo side (somewhat oily) and I love how light this gel cream is! I do not have to apply too much of it and it definitely keeps my skin moisturized, but not to the point where it is very oily. Would recommend!</li>
    <li> I really love it because it does feel so light when you use it on your face.I use it everyday,it feels so good</li>
    <li> Good price. I have issues with psoriasis and this seems to help break outs. I put it on after washing my face and it is very refreshing and has a good smell. I am a guy and this doesn&#x27;t have a feminine smell. The bottle is small but you only need a little on your fingers. It spreads well and drys quick. I have been using it for over a month and still have a little left</li>
    <li> I would not recommend this to anyone with sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;I am a very pale, freckled face 20 year old with super sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;I thought that this being a &amp;#34;moisture rescue&amp;#34; type of product it would moisturize my skin,&lt;br /&gt;it didn&#x27;t. It cause very bad dry patches all over my face instead.&lt;br /&gt;Will be throwing the rest of this jar in the garbage, maybe this was meant for people with&lt;br /&gt;oily skin? I have normal skin and have never had this bad of a reaction before.</li>
    <li> This is an amazing moisturizer, so light and fresh and it will leave your skin moist all day long.&lt;br /&gt;Plus a small quantity goes a long way which is incredible.</li>
    <li> This worked for my skin it was hydrating and my skin was really soft!!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve just turned 50 and have had sensitive skin for decades. In the last 10 years, I&#x27;ve tried all sorts of anti-aging creams, lotions and serums, including the most popular and highly rated brands (Olay Regenerist, Roc and more). I&#x27;ve bought products specifically for sensitive skin as well. One unexpected \\&quot;side effect\\&quot; has happened in the past few years--rosacea. It&#x27;s mild, but noticeable, and when I stopped using any lotions or potions, it began to clear up. HOWEVER... I&#x27;ve still needed a good moisturizer for everyday use, and have had a terrible time finding one that&#x27;s mild. I saw this at the drug store and decided for $7.99 it was worth a try. Wow! It&#x27;s fabulous! The gel absorbs quickly, feels refreshing, moisturizes without stinging, feeling oily or heavy, and is actually calming my easily-irritated skin! After only a few days, the redness is gone. No more wasting money on expensive products that don&#x27;t work for me; from here on out I&#x27;ll stick to Garnier Moisture Rescue.</li>
    <li> Okay, I just bought this yesterday at walmart. And already I am in LOVE with it. I had just started using a new foundation that completely dried my face out and I was flaky everywhere. I panicked because yesterday was valentines day and my boyfriend was taking me somewhere nice and my moisturizers weren&#x27;t working. I ran to walmart and saw this and tried it out. Within 10 minutes of putting it on, my skin was completely back to normal. No flakes, no dryness. My skin looked radiant. Now, I have acne prone skin and currently have a few blemishes. When I woke up this morning, my blemishes were faded and almost gone?! I know this product isn&#x27;t supposed to clear acne, but so far, it has for me. I love this so much and I&#x27;d recommend to this anyone with dry skin like mine.</li>
    <li> This didn&#x27;t work for me. When I used a small amount, it left my face too dry. When I used a larger amount, my face shined like two turkeys before thanksgiving. I felt like Goldilocks of the problem skin. I could never get it right. I switched to something else and it seems to be working OK for the moment. So, I guess this product just wasn&#x27;t for me.</li>
    <li> Sad that I can&#x27;t find this in store anymore. I love this as a moisturizer for summer.</li>
    <li> Did not like this product, it&#x27;s useless. Did not provide any moisture.</li>
    <li> This is now my favorite moisturizer. I can instantly feel my skin being smooth as I put it on. I love it! Best moisturizer I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
    <li> I just discovered Garnier brand products about 6 months ago. I find them to be well-priced and of excellent quality.</li>
    <li> I will advise this product to people with oily skin. It keeps your face nor to dry or too oily, it realy works from normal to oily skin.</li>
    <li> I have very touchy skin and this works great for me without leaving a residue, clogging my pores or leaving me look sunburned.</li>
    <li> Good smell, but as my skin is sensitive, and it is a little allergy when I use this product.</li>
    <li> The product feels very cool to the skin and goes on light, which feels really nice especially if you happen to have sunburn on your face. It also doesn&#x27;t cause any flare-ups or any sort of acne problems. But it makes your skin feel very greasy and takes a long time to seep in. It makes you look sweaty and oily. I also didn&#x27;t see much of a difference moisturizing-wise, and for that reason I am giving this 2 stars. Don&#x27;t get it, it&#x27;s a waste of money. Also, in my opinion, moisturizers work much better when they are in a cream format as opposed to a gel.</li>
    <li> Nice scent, jelly like texture, absorbs very quickly, but as moisturizer is very average to my taste. Just my personal opinion. Someone might like it.</li>
    <li> This worked very well for me, I&#x27;m an 18 year old male with oily skin, and this helped me hydrate my skin after successive chemical peels, without making my skin look oily.</li>
    <li> i actually bought this from target.  i was never the type to use moisturizers, didnt really think i needed them back then, but as of the past few years my skins become really dry, and even after washing my face, even with a scrub, my skin was STILL looking flaky and dry, so my makeup always looked like crap and i couldnt figure out why. i switched the the neutrogena face wash, just the standard orange in a pump bottle, and though it works awesome, afterwards, my face is suuuper tight and dry.  and thats where this little product comes in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;it smells great, very fresh, clean and crisp scent but also very light. and speaking of light, a little bit of this stuff goes a looong way.  i was surprised by its texture really. i was expecting an actual cream, like your typical lotion stuff and i saw this green stuff and touched it and it felt really good lol. its cold, slick and not oily at all.  that was one thing that concerned me but nope, i put a little on my wrist, rubbed it in a little and once it dried it was just smooth and soft, no oily residue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i came on here because i was like, oh this stuffs awesome, and i wondered how others who bought it felt about it so i thought a good place would be to check amazon for other peoples comments, and was not surprised to see how highly everyone else spoke of it, so i had to put my word in too because im totally in love with this stuff..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i wondered if anyone knows of any of those good little face scrubber things? like the Wave or just something good that scrubs the face, a little battery powered one. or a microdermabrasion  thing. i really want to try one of those. i am in my mid 20&#x27;s and still get some bad breakouts, and i just don&#x27;t know what to do anymore.there&#x27;s rarely ever a time my face is ever 100% clear, and by the time it does, i break out again a week before that time of the month and it takes weeks to heal.  any advice is totally welcome and appreciated.</li>
    <li> It really works!  I very quickly purchased another one.  My skin feels smooth and this gel does everything creams are supposed to do, but never do!  Buy it!</li>
    <li> I use this after having used microdermabrasion crystals on my face. It preserves the skin softness yielded by the dermabrasion, and presents drying without clogging pores.</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with this product. It works great. After I went through cancer treatments my skin was in poor shape. My cheeks were dry and very red. After trying several different moisturizers , this was the only one that restored my skin and made it soft again. I use this twice a day.</li>
    <li> very smooth application and really keeps skin supple and smooth for upto 10 hrs  !&lt;br /&gt;does what it says ! refreshing ...</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s so extremely light, and just glides on your skin. It&#x27;s not the best moisturizer for dry spots, but it feels so nice when it&#x27;s on your skin. Really refreshing, and it feels like there&#x27;s nothing on.</li>
    <li> I have been on the hunt for a new moisturizer for the last several months since my favorite moisturizer has been discontinued. I decided to try Garnier Moisture Rescue Refreshing Gel-Cream because it had good reviews on Amazon. I have never previously used a Garnier product or a gel moisturizer before. Unfortunately, this moisturizer isn&#x27;t for me and it is largely because of the scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A rundown on my skin type. I have very sensitive skin. I tend to have combination skin, although when my skin is dry it is VERY dry. It it gets oily it just gets moderately oily. I don&#x27;t really have issues with breakouts (only a pimple here or there from time to time), but do have issues with my skin breaking out into a itching rash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I purchased this moisturizer I was hoping for a light-weight, oil-free, scent-free moisturizer. I wanted something that didn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling oily, but also moisturized it. Also, having very sensitive skin I need a moisturizer that won&#x27;t cause pimple breakouts or rash breakouts. Lastly, I need a moisturizer that I can put my liquid foundation over and still gives me an even skin tone. Although the Garnier Moisture Rescue Refreshing Gel-Cream lived up to a lot of these requirements I had big enough issues that this product just isn&#x27;t going to work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve previously never used a gel moisturizer before. This was the first time and I have to say I wouldn&#x27;t be opposed to it in the future. I don&#x27;t know why they call it a gel-cream as there is nothing cream about it. This moisturizing gel is very similar to putting aloe on your face. The consistency of the gel is very similar to aloe and it soaks into your skin relatively quickly like aloe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had limited use of this product so I am not exactly sure how it would have panned out in terms of overall moisturizing my skin and skin breakouts. In the two weeks I used it I did not suffer from any skin irritation or pimple breakouts. Also, it left my skin feeling very soft. For the most part my skin felt moisturized and being a gel it was very light-weight and non-greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ultimately, the problem I had with this product is it is scented. The scent is light, but per-fumy. Scented skin products are never good for someone with sensitive skin (or sensitive anything for that matter). The scent never went away until I washed the moisturizer off my face. It followed me around all day and being on my face it was so close to my nose. I also had issues with my eyes drying out from the smell. At first I wasn&#x27;t sure why my eyes were drying out and thought it might have to do with the moisturizer. I stopped using the moisturizer and I stopped having issues with my eyes drying out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- It moisturizes your skin.&lt;br /&gt;- Lightweight&lt;br /&gt;- Oil-free&lt;br /&gt;- Leaves skin smooth feeling.&lt;br /&gt;- No breakouts or skin irritation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- Has too much of a scent.&lt;br /&gt;- Irritated my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I will not be purchasing this moisturizer again in the future. If they decide to make an unscented version I absolutely would be interested in trying it again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Side Note: One thing I&#x27;ve learned having life long issues with sensitive skin is what doesn&#x27;t work for one person could work fabulous for another and visa versa. So sadly, unless everyone is saying its horrible, you might have to try it out for yourself to find out it if is the right product for you. Everyone&#x27;s skin is different and reacts differently to products.</li>
    <li> Smells like Garnier hairspray. Could not have it on my face :(</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband, who has a problem with itchy and flaky skin on his face.  I can only say that he loves it and has told me to buy more when he runs out.  And this is from a guy who never pays much attention to what he uses on his face, just uses what I buy at the store!</li>
    <li> I have tried countless moisturizers and creams, and never found anything that worked with my very sensitive, very dry skin.  Nearly everything in the past has left my skin both still dry, and broken out (which is insanely frustrating because without a moisturizer, my skin is dry but never breaks out.)  When I found this product I was literally ready to give up on moisturizers all together, but this gel-creme is a miracle!  It dries super quickly and goes on very lightly, leaving no oily feeling.  Since my skin is so dry I like to apply one layer, let it dry, and then add a second.  I use this both at night and in the morning, and I&#x27;m in love, super moisturized skin and absolutely no breakouts or red spots, this stuff is amazing!</li>
    <li> If you don&#x27;t want your skin to become oily this is the one</li>
    <li> I think it works well as a summer moisturizer, as I have combination skin which is usually a little oily during this time. I also have very sensitive, acne prone skin like many others, and this product did not break me out or cause any negative reactions. I don&#x27;t think it is miraculous like some reviewers do, but I like it and will most likely to purchase it again. However, since the season is changing again, and it&#x27;s getting a little chilly at where I live (50~60 degrees), I have noticed that it&#x27;s not enough for my skin. I usually use something heavier in winter anyway, so I&#x27;ll recommend this for summer use.&lt;br /&gt;On the side note, while this product being cheap, I don&#x27;t think it lasts for a long time. I use it with my boyfriend, we each use this gel-cream once a day, and it&#x27;s running out after a month. My boyfriend is telling me to get another jar, and likes how lightweight this moisturizer is. Ha, and he never liked putting anything on his face.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a good, reliable moisturizer that does what it&#x27;s supposed to: lock the moisture into your skin. I have a combo skin so the choice was easy, as it&#x27;s light, absorbs quickly and doesn&#x27;t leave any residue or stickiness. The price was also very attractive as I prefer a simple, refreshing moisturizer over a fancy expensive one.&lt;br /&gt;The reason is because I read in an article that we don&#x27;t really need one of those expensive ones with lots of active ingredients as the moisturizer doesn&#x27;t penetrate deep into the skin, it stays on the surface to keep the moisture in. And we&#x27;re better off spending the money on a good serum instead, with lots of goodies in it. Then use a light moisturizer to lock it in.&lt;br /&gt;I also like the fact that it&#x27;s a gel formula, can&#x27;t get more lightweight than that.&lt;br /&gt;I personally am very pleased with it, so I put it on subscription.&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t see why anybody would dislike it, other than expecting miracles out of a light moisturizer....like making wrinkles disappear- that&#x27;s never gonna happen. It&#x27;s not what it&#x27;s made for.</li>
    <li> Smells really good and a little goes a long way. I have oily skin so I don&#x27;t moisturize too often but when I do, I use this.</li>
    <li> I use this product everyday! It&#x27;s amazing! I bought it a cvs after seeing all the good reviews and it deserves every one of them! In the winter my skin gets very dry so I use the one for dry skin and it moisturizes my skin so well and in the summer I use the one for normal skin. It is my favorite moisturizer and by far the best I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
    <li> One of my favorites. I have combination skin. Cheeks tend to dry out, but my nose stays oily. I actually keep it in the refrigerator to give my skin a cooling treatment each time I use it.</li>
    <li> It gives my skin a spa-like feel, doesn&#x27;t clog pores, and has a nice smell. However, I have combination skin and this actually dried out my skin. I think this would be great for people with oily skin, or it could be an excellent light moisturizer for the summer. However, living in the Midwest it&#x27;s felt like Fall since late August. I&#x27;ve always used lotions, and I thought this gel-cream would give my skin that extra boost, but sadly no.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t say enough about this moisturizer. I have this one (green gel), the one for dry skin (pink gel) and the renew crème (white cream). So far during the summer months this one works just fine, but I do sometimes apply the renew crème at night. And, I&#x27;m guessing the one for dry skin will be my everyday one for the winter months. They all smell wonderful, especially the one for normal skin. I hope Garnier comes out with a body lotion that smells just like it; I will definitely buy it if they do!</li>
    <li> My sensitive combo skin absolutely LOVES this moisturizer! It works all day long and is not greasy nor does it leave a shine.</li>
    <li> love how it moisturizes and cools my face</li>
    <li> My favorite moisturizer. It feels very light and like water but dries great without any oily feeling. Does not seem to exacerbate acne. Each gel lasts me between 2-3 months. I have subscribed to this item for every 5 months and I get 5% off. I have been using this for over 2 years and highly recommend people to try this! It is more of a clear gel than a cream.</li>
    <li> I really like the cream because my skin is hard to find the right one. I have quickly become skin oil and makeup from the face of the slide. This cream does not make the skin oily.</li>
    <li> this is such a lightweight yet such a moisturizing moisturizer!!!!! I really recommend this to those who have oily and acne prone skin, this really moisturizes your face and keeps it dewy and healthy! In the wintertime I went up into the mountains for a retreat with my church and I brought this body shop face moisturizer/primer because I knew that it was going to be dry and my face would be horribly dry and flaky. The body shop moisturizer actually made things worse and dried out my skin, I would literally press my face against some dark colored cloth, and my skin would flake everywhere, it was disgusting and horrible and I just wanted to go home. The dryness caused me to break out 10x more than I would ( i have a big acne problem) I would exfoliate, but it&#x27;d make things worse, because i had nothing to moisturize after with. I looked this up on amazon and saw the good reviews and decided to purchase it at a nearby target. Literally when I applied this, in one night my face was moisturized, not as flaky (it was still healing from when I came down from the mountains) and my face felt good and not dry and rough and nasty blegh. I&#x27;m out of my first one from in December when I bought it, and now ordered and received my second one. I am sooo happy with this moisturizer, it&#x27;s very light and smells nice and feels really cool and refreshing and its just all around amazing!! Definitely recommend for an inexpensive yet really good moisturizer. It&#x27;s GEL not a CREAM so it&#x27;s really good for oily and acne prone skin, cream can clog up pores and make acne worse. The only con..not really a con, is that it&#x27;s surprisingly small ahaha i expected a bigger container, but it holds a lot and I use this on a daily basis morning, noon, night, whenever i wash my face! The container is made of thick glass, so try not to drop it! A definite recommend and definite buy!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m trying to buy more cruelty free items, and some how I mistakenly thought this item/brand was.  But it is a decent cream, I use it at night, it&#x27;s pretty hydrating and comfortable. I like the feel of the gel, very cooling, but doesn&#x27;t dry sticky as some gels do.  I have sensitive skin and this doesn&#x27;t bother me at all.</li>
    <li> This product leaves my face so smooth and soft! I have to restrain myself from putting it on all the time... I may have to repurchase soon.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t really care for this gel-cream. It has a strong fragrance and sometimes irritates my skin. I like the idea of a gel moisturizer but this is not the one for me. I will keep looking.</li>
    <li> By far the best moisturizer I have used. First off this will not clog your pores. It also does not create a greasy layer but rather absorbs in and give a nice amount of moisture to the skin all day long. I love using it. After many years of fighting delicate, acne prone, rosacea skin it is nice to finally have something that doesn&#x27;t aggrevate any of my conditions.</li>
    <li> moisturizing without being too oily. great for summer.</li>
    <li> I like this moisturizer. It has a very light texture, has a pleasant smell and leaves no residue on my skin, which is a huge plus. If in doubt - give it a go, I think this is an all-around winner</li>
    <li> I never liked &amp;#34;Garnier&amp;#34; products but I decided to try this new lotion. This lotion feels like oil. It made me break out and made my skin. I won&#x27;t ever buy a Garnier product again.</li>
    <li> I bought this one because my skin is oily,it&#x27;s worked for me...</li>
    <li> Lots of moisturizing products make me break out or itch. I can use this liberally and my face feels instantly fresh! There is no waiting necessary. You can instantly apply your makeup after and it is 0% oily. I LOVE this product. I typically can not sleep in other moisturizers without waking up with little white heads (gross) and I can apply this morning and night after i wash my face. Even my toddler uses it in the winter on his little cheeks.</li>
    <li> I use this daily. My skin loves it.  Applies on cool and penetrate into your skin without feeling sticky or heavy.  A little goes a long way.  A jar lasts me 2 months and that&#x27;s after using it twice daily.</li>
    <li> This is very good for the money. Keeps my skin moisturized. You do have to use very small amounts and rub it in quite a bit because it is a gel. I recommend it!</li>
    <li> Non greasy moisturizer works perfect!! This gel has a light smell, it is not overwhelming. It absorbs fast. It does not irritate my skin.Love it!</li>
    <li> I have ordered this product seeing good ratings and reviews :) and yeah I am happy with it. Mine is damn sensitive and combo skin..due to severe winter I had to use this and this one seriously rescued my skin..i nvr completed any cream i buy one cream...use it till i buy a new one or other one..but nvr finished it..due to some dissatisfaction...&lt;br /&gt;recently we went to NY, roamed badly in freezing snow..i got red rashes..i was feeling terrible..then i jus gave a chance and applied this cream (large amount on those areas) and slept...wen i got up...my face was clear and free...I gave only 4 bcoz..i m brown skinned..after using this..i look lil tanned..but if u apply any other cream on top of it..that wud be fine...&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend it :) I love it :)</li>
    <li> very light, cooling, and refreshing. Excellent for summer  under makeup. Only negatives would be no spf and has kind of a strong smell - not bad, but if you are sensitive that sort of thing - I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this one for you.</li>
    <li> I use this to moisturize before bed.  It&#x27;s not too heavy and does not cause my skin to break out. Smells nice and I would def buy again.</li>
    <li> I have sensitive skin that gets dry easy.  This is the first product I have found that will not irritate my skin and keeps it moist.</li>
    <li> my previous moisturizers would leave a dry residue feeling on my face all day and since this one is a gell, it&#x27;s actually pretty perfect. And the best part about it,... its travel size!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just wish it had some sunscreen in it or some sort of SP-F that would be an added bonus</li>
    <li> It feels light and refreshing! It&#x27;s a little too light for me so I use it with &amp;#34;Garnier Moisture Rescue Lightweight UV Lotion SPF 15&amp;#34;, applying the gel before the lotion and its perfect. In the summer however I expect that using the gel by itself wold work too!</li>
    <li> This very reasonably priced gel moisture cream is my new go to moisturizer, ESPECIALLY, for UNDER MAKEUP.&lt;br /&gt;I live in tropical South Florida, and it&#x27;s already in the high 80s, with 90 percent humidity. The last thing I want as an under-makeup moisture cream is come super creamy thick or greasy start.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This gel is so cooling, and firming. IT is awesome. It feels good from the minute it&#x27;s on your face, and seems to have a drawing effect when it dries, and it dries relatively quickly. When it does, you still have the clean face, with a cool palate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Makeup seems to go on and stay on better. I have been using it at night, and even through the day. I just love it. Because I am trying to limit my time in the sun, but, still want that sun-kissed tropical glow, I use artificial tanners, and this is great underneath them, as well, because, it does the same thing that it does under makeup, which is to moisturize and create a good conditioned skin. That way, no streaking takes place.</li>
    <li> BEST MOISTURE CREAM IN THE MARKET!&lt;br /&gt;I HAVE USED MORE THAN 10 BOTTLES OF THIS WITH MY SISTERS AT HOME.&lt;br /&gt;THIS IS THE BEST!</li>
    <li> This makes the skin feel great but it still did not stand up to the extremely dry winter air. I was looking for something really great, but it did not do the trick.</li>
    <li> This product is exactly like it would be if I had bought it in stores! This is my third time buying this product in general and I love it. The moisturizer feels very refreshing, I use it after a shower or face wash and it hydrates my skin. The container is a little different than the ones I have previously bought but the product is all the same, I actually like this container more its adorable. (:</li>
    <li> I have oily/combination skin with adult acne that flares with the slightest change to my cleansing routine, so when I needed to find a moisturizer for the summer months, this gel-based Moisture Rescue seemed like a good option. It&#x27;s so light, it absorbs almost immediately with no shine or greasy residue. It has a slightly sweet pear/cucumber smell that disappears soon after applying. Best of all, it hasn&#x27;t made my acne worse and is just the right amount of moisturizing for the hot summers.  I use a little spatula thing to scoop out a pea-sized amount. That&#x27;s enough to cover my entire face and neck and the whole thing lasts me about 3-4 months. I say &amp;#34;little&amp;#34; because it&#x27;s smaller than I expected, about the size of a plum. I am now on my second little tub.</li>
    <li> This is all I have used for the last 8 years .love this cream</li>
    <li> this stuff is amazing!!! It&#x27;s so coola nd refreshing and its a gel so theres no sticky or residue left on your skin; i use it daily! It&#x27;s amazing; gives you such smooth skin!</li>
    <li> This does not moisturize! I have to use it twice in an hour to get rid of dryness. It does not have even temporarily lasting effects.</li>
    <li> Light on the skin with a fresh scent. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this for anyone with dry skin as it isn&#x27;t as moisturizing as a cream style moisturizer. I have combination skin and it works great for me in the summer and fall. In the winter I have to use two coats on my T zone to get enough moisture. My only complaint is that I hate the tub. I miss having moisturizers in tubes that were easy to dispense! With tubs I always end up with too much or too little, and if I dip my fingers in I feel like it&#x27;s getting contaminants in the rest of the product due to having moderately long nails.</li>
    <li> Like this product! I am a 32 yr old female. Normal skin, typical skin issues (blemishes/ sun exposure/life) Easy to use, nice smell, absorbs quick and no remaining residue. Wish the bottle was bigger! Price is very nice too.</li>
    <li> This absorbs into my skin well, leaving me feeling fresh. I use this every day after using the foaming cleanser. Working good so far :)</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t really know what I was expecting of this product.  It&#x27;s okay.  It feels nice on my face but I don&#x27;t really like the smell.  It doesn&#x27;t do much in the way of moisture for me either.  Skin products are hard to rate really.  What works okay for me might be great for you.</li>
    <li> I wanted a moisturizer that I could apply before I put on my foundation which would hydrate my skin and help blend in makeup. Never having tried this before, I bought it at a local store due to the glowing reviews and was excited to try it out. Unlike most moisturizers, this one is a gel as opposed to cream. I washed my face and applied it to my face. I found that it spread easily on skin, however dried a minute or so after putting it on. My skin felt tight and not soft or hydrated. In my experience, not only was this an ineffective product to use before adding makeup for easier blending, but it also just overall fell short in replenishing and hydrating skin. I used the entire jar and saw no changes in it&#x27;s effects. I found another product that I love that I will be using from now on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I liked about this gel was that during the four weeks or so I used it, it did not break me out.</li>
    <li> Moisterizes without greasy feel completely absorbed into skin. But you will need a sunscreen for day time use. I use Etta MD 46spf.</li>
    <li> I LOVE the Garnier Moisture Rescue Gel-cream!  I am a repeat customer &amp; have bought 7 jars of it.  I am 46 years old with oily/dry T-zone problems and this is the ONLY moisturizer that instantly absorbs into my skin (ie does not sit on it for hours like heavier ones). You can use as much of it as you want and it never gets tacky.</li>
    <li> Iw as not impressed by this product.  Thought the consistency was too watery. Did not notice and skin improvement. Would not buy this again</li>
    <li> This is the only product I use on my face. It hydrates without making my skin feel greasy and it doesn&#x27;t have a strong smell. I love it and hope that they never stop making it.</li>
    <li> I bought this moisturizer because it had a nice price and I like some of Garnier&#x27;s other products. But this one is a big disappointment. It feels like rubbing alcohol for your face. I have to use a moisturizer for my face because it is so tight and dry after washing. But this stuff no matter how little or how much I use, goes on and dries leaving my face feeling tighter and uncomfortable. I am not fon dof the smell hence the rubbing alcohol reference as well. I think I will go back to the Loreal moisturizer I was using. The price for this is good but it is not worth it.</li>
    <li> Not very moisturizing at all. Leaves a dull shine on my face in a way that brings out all my flaws.  Thought id just use it as a hand lotion then to not waste it but it dried my hands out. They made this for people who don&#x27;t really need a moisturizer but want one anyways. No benefits from it.</li>
    <li> This is strictly a gel, almost like aloe. It is very watery and did not necessarily moisturize like I thought. I guess it was worth a try because it was cheap. Oh, plus there isn&#x27;t any English on the label</li>
    <li> I love the feeling of freshness this product gives to the skin everywhere.... I love it and will recommend it to anyone..</li>
    <li> in this summertime heat my skin gets so oily&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;this cream helps relieve that oiliness a little bit. it smells very nice too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;unfortunately the cream is not that thick and seems like it doesn&#x27;t really stick to your skin that well...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;it is a cheap product so i guess it is ok for what i paid&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the next time around i will be ordering something a little more expensive.</li>
    <li> This is a great moisture for someone like me who has oily skin.  It is in gel form, is very refreshing and doesn&#x27;t clog the pores.</li>
    <li> My skin is oily/semi-acne prone. I normally use the LaRoche-Posey Effaclar product line. I purchased the Moisture Rescue Refreshing Gel-Cream to use at night. I am pleased with the product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has the consistency of aloe vera gel. It is light-weight and doesn&#x27;t cause breakouts. I give the moisturizer a medium score because it sits on top of the skin; doesn&#x27;t last long.</li>
    <li> Very moderate moisture.</li>
    <li> I should have looked at others reviews of this before buying. Gel creams are moreso intended for oily skin, so this on my super dry skin did nothing. My guy (who has oily skin) tried it and liked it though so it&#x27;s not a complete waste. But if you have dry skin like myself, stick with creams.</li>
    <li> Since I&#x27;ve been pregnant, my skin has been very sensitive and prone to breakouts.  This is one of the only moisturizers I&#x27;ve found that does not irritate my skin.  It leaves my skin feeling very soft and fresh.</li>
    <li> This product is an excellent moisturizer. It is light and has a fresh scent. You can use it anytime during the day.</li>
    <li> Looks like I&#x27;m allergic to this as it made my face itchy.  Looking for a gentler product on my face.</li>
    <li> Seems like the same thing as aloe vera, I will not use this in place of moisturizer but would use it more as an after sun gel. I was hoping for  more of a moisturizer.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff, it has a nice scent to it and leaves my skin looking nice and moisturized instead of getting flaky like it can. Also, it doesn&#x27;t leave the disturbing oily feel that moisturizers tend to leave for me. Glad I tried it out.</li>
    <li> I have oily, acne-prone skin that is also extremely sensitive. Recently, I had a reaction to a tinted sunscreen I tried, and my entire face was red, dry, and itchy. This was the only moisturizer that healed my skin and significantly reduced the redness after I applied it. I could literally see and feel my skin calming after using this gel. It seems unbelievable that a drugstore brand moisturizer could work so well, but it&#x27;s soothing and softening without increasing oil. I use this morning and night and don&#x27;t break out from it. I also add a bit of sunscreen to it in the morning to apply under my makeup. The jar is small and fragile, but a little goes a long way and it lasts for several months. I do occasionally need a dab of a stronger moisturizer if I have a dry spot in the winter, but overall, this is a great moisturizer for regular use. It reminds me of Mary Kay&#x27;s soothing eye gel, as far as the consistency goes, and I don&#x27;t find the smell overpowering at all. It&#x27;s very light and refreshing.</li>
    <li> FEELS GOOD ON FACE BUT JUST OK FOR WHAT IT DOES&lt;br /&gt;DONT THINK I WOULD BUY IT AGAIN UNLESS PRICE WAS RIGHT AS ON SALE</li>
    <li> My face feels less oily with this on under primer. Fast drying, not stinky, Doesn&#x27;t burn my eyes.</li>
    <li> Feels great on your face, but was making me break out. Not recommended if you have sensitive skin, but otherwise I loved the product.</li>
    <li> My wife could not find it in stores. So I went on line. Four jars arrived on time and she likes the gift. Recommended.</li>
    <li> I use this after I finish my swim and in the shower.  The chlorine makes my skin dry and stiff but this cream is terrific as it softens and makes my skin feel moist.  I really do like this cream.  Wish it came in a plastic jar as I am always worried  about dropping it on the tile floor of the shower.</li>
    <li> My skin changes with the seasons - warmer months I&#x27;m more greasy, colder months I&#x27;m more dry.  This cream has a light scent and its great to wear under a dry-touch sunscreen for 6 months out of the year - which is exactly what I wanted.  Makeup looks great on top of it, and it&#x27;s inexpensive.  Great product!</li>
    <li> So thick that when it drys it peals and flacks off the skin.  Nasty stuff.  Won&#x27;t repeat this mistake. There are better choices.</li>
    <li> A great moisturiser for normal but sensitive skin.  I don&#x27;t need a lot of moisture, just a little barrier to hold in my natural moisture, and this is one of the very few that doesn&#x27;t give me pimples.</li>
    <li> I really WANTED to like this after reading the reviews, I bought mine from CVS with a gift card I had. It made my face sticky and I woke up with two huge under the surface pimples the next morning :( I have normal/dry skin and I just didn&#x27;t feel like this entered my skin at all, more like sat on top. Even the next morning the texture of my skin was something I&#x27;m not used to. I&#x27;ll try giving to a friend who hopefully has a better experience.</li>
    <li> I really like this stuff. I have mostly normal skin except for my forehead where it gets really dry and flaky. Regular lotions don&#x27;t last and I wanted something better. When I opened the canister I was a bit put off by the fact that it was way more \\&quot;gel\\&quot; than \\&quot;cream\\&quot; and I thought \\&quot;well how is this going to moisturize my face?\\&quot; but it really does. I would suggest, however, to exfoliate if at all possible prior to use. The first time I used it, I just rubbed it on without cleaning my skin and it barely worked, if at all. I was disappointed. And then I thought well, I obviously have a lot of dead skin on my forehead, lets clean that off first. And now it works wonderfully. I&#x27;m writing this review in mid-winter, and on days where it&#x27;s cold but wet, my skin is good with every 48 hours. But when it drops below 30 and it&#x27;s dry, I have to go every 24 or so. It dries quickly, leaves no residue or \\&quot;oily\\&quot; feeling, and makes my skin feel supple and soft afterwards. I love it!</li>
    <li> I have been using this gel for about three weeks now and this stuff is amazing! It leave my face feeling so soft and moisturized. My face looks like it&#x27;s glowing without the oily feeling and look. The price is not bad either just truly awesome moisturizer. This is definitely a favorite of mine now.</li>
    <li> Cool and refreshing.  There are no ingredients on the &amp;#34;acne ingredients to avoid list&amp;#34; which is the reason I purchased.  It seems to hydrate my skin and makeup glides right over.&lt;br /&gt;I also have the pink version for dry skin.  I save the green for summer.&lt;br /&gt;I enjoy both.&lt;br /&gt;These arrived in the original box and were sealed.  That is of most importance to me</li>
    <li> Really has no active ingredient. It will give you a short burst of hydration, but other than that it&#x27;s a waste of money. Buy this instead:&lt;br /&gt;https://www.scottsmarketplace.com/buy/939/vitamin-c-serum-2oz-advanced-vitamin-c-serum-for-f/</li>
    <li> The gel formula is a little too thick for my liking, and it sat on the surface rather than being absorbed by the skin. I actually think that this product led to my face being more oily and acne prone than other cream moisturizers that I&#x27;ve used, and I wasn&#x27;t impressed with it at all. It did provide some hydration, but the feeling on my face throughout the day was pretty icky.</li>
    <li> This moisturizer is sticky, kinda stings, and doesn&#x27;t moisturize well. After applying a generous amount, my skin is still flaky and dry. Do not recommend.</li>
    <li> Humid New Orleans summer weather + makeup &#x3D; embarrassing greasy look. I searched for an oil-free moisturizer because my makeup slid off my face in the steamy weather. I have combination skin with a seriously oily T-zone. I have some pricy moisturizers, not oil-free, that I put away since I purchased this Garnier Gel-cream.  Using this with a primer, also oil-free, has helped keep my makeup intact. The product is a thin gel with a smell that disappears after applying. It&#x27;s a little sticky upon application, but dries fast and smooth. I didn&#x27;t expect this product to be so good, because of the cheap price, but it goes to show high end products aren&#x27;t always the answer. I gave it four stars because of the packaging.  Kind of a weird surprise upon opening and saw the jar is only as big as the picture, not the box it comes in.</li>
    <li> Like a refreshing drink for my skin! I have oily, acne-prone skin, and this is one of the few products that doesn&#x27;t cause me to breakout. Super happy that I found this! It smells nice and is light and refreshing. If you have super dry skin, I&#x27;m guessing this would not be enough moisture. If you have normal to oily, you will probably like it!</li>
    <li> Awesome cream. Used it mostly as night cream. keep my face well moisturized all night long. also great in the summer because the gel is cool.</li>
    <li> I have a very oily skin in order to that I&#x27;m very careful for what I use for my face. I have been using this for almost a Year and I can say that my Face never looks this amazing until now. Its very refreshing! making my face feel light, fresh and also smooth. I alsohave a clear skin ever since I started using this product.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this especially for those who have a very oily skin.</li>
    <li> Love it...have used this product before and I am always so pleased with how great it makes you face feel!</li>
    <li> I thought it would help moisture but its not for super dry skin like mine. I will use it when my skin is not dry for a little extra moister but I didn&#x27;t see any great results after two weeks using it.It will last a long time though. Woud be good for those who don&#x27;t wear make up.</li>
    <li> I have oily skin with adult acne at age 30. I liked this product when I first applied it, but once it dried it seemed not to moisturize at all. In fact it made my skin look drier.  I will stick to my pricier but favorite moisturizer for oily/clogged skin; sonya dakar natureluxe clear lotion. Its 70 bucks but lasts 3 months, moisturizes and beautifies my skin without breaking me out, and gives me added deweyness without being oily.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t feel healthy for my skin, it smells slightly of alcohol and I just haven&#x27;t seen that it does anything for my skin.</li>
    <li> I have tried Garnier before and was not that happy, but i love serum a lot more than lotions.  But it&#x27;s just okay.  You should try it and see what you think.</li>
    <li> Ladies,are you looking for that one exhilarating moisturizer you&#x27;ve been dying to get? Look no further and reach for this \\&quot;food from the nutrient gods\\&quot; non greasy facial treatment by Garnier. I can tell you in so many words how this tiny jar has saved and spared my face from skin deterioration and other infractions related to unkind outdoor impurities. But to suceed in making this feedback short and simple, I can only confess that this is a first rate oil free antidote and a must have for anyone who needs to treat and cure skin depletions and maintain even levels of moisturizing to conquer dryness and early signs of wrinkles. One single application of this soothing almost liquidfying gel you can feel immediately your unenergised face(skin)is getting an uplift pampering and healing like a therapeutic clay mask. Your inner pores will get the healthy benefits of receiving natural nutrients and your overall facial lines will be barely noticable. In addition your moisturized complexion will show a healthy glow after several days of repeated applications. The cucumber extracts are one of the main ingredients that make this moisturizer special because they cause gentle and cooling effects unlike any other. It&#x27;s as if your entire face is bathed in lucious cucumbers. It&#x27;s also noted that it&#x27;s so safe you can even apply small amounts of gel under your eyes to eliminate puffiness and deep linings. I&#x27;d recommend this exclusive product to anyone who needs extra extra moisturizing and protection plus as a remedy for all skin types suffer from blemished weather beatened and unbalanced skin :-)</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t seem to do anything. It felt &#x27;wet&#x27; when you put it on and didn&#x27;t moisturize at all. Waste of money!</li>
    <li> This moisturizing cream leaves your face refreshed after applying.  A little goes a long way, and my skin is noticeably smoother and no longer dry.</li>
    <li> This product is not for oily skin maybe for dry.The first time I used it looks like I put oil on my face so shiny and the last thing I want for my oily skin is that. Also It doesn&#x27;t leaves your skin smooth it leaves it sticky. About the refreshing only until it dries. Only thing is good is the smell.</li>
    <li> I got this actully a week before it was supposed to arrive, thumbs up from me. It was a tad small but for the price not to shabby especially seeing im going on my second week using this and im barley startin to make a dent. Now the smell (my favorite) is great smells like cucumber melon, yall were right about the sunburn part i was actully burned the first week an this helped me tons. The only downfall for me would be if you apply too much it takes a good minute to dry so your there rubbing till it does but isnt that all moisturizers. Aside from that i&#x27;d recommend</li>
    <li> Not very moisturizing</li>
    <li> I live by this product! So hydrating! I despise any lotion type mpisturizers, as they make me feel oily. About $4 cheaper than average drugstore prices</li>
    <li> This is excellent - very much as-advertised.  I&#x27;m mildly dry and sensitive and this moisturizes well for hours, without sitting on my skin and looking oily.  I live in hot, dry Dallas and this is excellent for our climate; it absorbs quickly. This is pretty strongly fragranced;  if that bothers you this may be an issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;ve tried Clinique&#x27;s Moisture On-Line, this is extremely similar.  I find it to be more moisturizing than that product.  Would highly recommend if you need a moisturizing, gentle product that won&#x27;t sting sensitive (or redness prone) skin and won&#x27;t look oily.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this at night after I wash my face before I go to bed.  It makes the skin on my face feel refreshed and pliable but never sticky.  This surprised me at first because when I dip my fingers in the jar, it feels like the &amp;#34;Dippity-Do&amp;#34; we used on our hair when I was a kid.  But this gel-cream goes on smoothly with a satiny soft finish, and a little dab goes a long way.  The fragrance is very mild and fresh.  I won&#x27;t say it&#x27;s making me look ten years younger, but my face definitely feels clean, moisturized, and healthy!</li>
    <li> Great facial moisturizer following a shave. Doesn&#x27;t sting or have an oily feel, minimal fragrance which is great. A little goes a long way with me just sticking a finger in, rubbing it between my palms, and applying it from forehead to collarbone.</li>
    <li> The description says 6.4 ounces and the price says a little over just one dollar per ounce, which reinforces the impression that we are to receive 6.4 ounces. However, the item I received (from Sam&#x27;s Online via Amazon) only had 1.7 ounces of moisturizer. I feel ripped off.</li>
    <li> i used Mary Kay gel moisturizer in the past, but couldn&#x27;t afford the $30 price tag.  I love this product!  I use it daily and even on my dry winter skin.  It is so lightweight that I can use it in the morning under my spf moisturizer.  It does lock in moisture and makes my skin feel fresh and soft.  I love the smell and the price. It is a GEL don&#x27;t expect anything creamy. I really hope they never discontinue this moisturizer.</li>
    <li> I am quite pleased with this. The gel dries quickly and into a softness (not a stickiness). My skin feels smooth. It is cooling and just the right and slight scent, which does not linger. I do not wear makeup mostly, so am glad I put it on also in the mornings. I cannot speak to how it would do umder makeup, but it does disappear into the skin, and leave it soft and dry. And the biggest reason I like gels as this, is that they have the tad tightening feeling as they dry. A little goes a long way, and don&#x27;t forget the neck! Feels great!</li>
    <li> ... not sure if it is because it is winter right now (Arizona winter so...) but I started using this after I wash my face before bed and it seems like I have to put multiple layers in order for my face to feel moisturized. If it gets better I will come back and edit this review. Otherwise I need to recommend looking for something else if your face is on the dry side.</li>
    <li> This is just wow! wow! I ve been suffering from dry skin with a lot of marks. I tried all moisturizers and they just left my skin looking dry with many breakouts. But this little bottle is just wow! It makes my skin so soft. I wanna pinch my own cheeks! they are so soft and I look young and no more breakouts!</li>
    <li> I fell in love with gel moisturizers as soon as they hit the market!  Garnier&#x27;s Gel-Cream is just perfect for me!  I use it in the morning (under my makeup), and throughout the day to freshen up my makeup.  And, of course, it&#x27;s cheaper on Amazon!!</li>
    <li> I just purchased this a few weeks ago and I love it.  I am in my early 50&#x27;s and have sensitive skin and rosacea.  This stuff has not broken me out at all and my face isn&#x27;t quite as flaming red as it usually is.  It takes very little to glide on over my face and neck and provides a great makeup base for my foundation.  It is not greasy and sinks right in.  This is great for combination or normal/dry skin.  It feels cooling to my skin.  I will definitely buy this again.</li>
    <li> This gel is great. I got it from CVS on sale at 5.99 (I thought for that price you really cant lose), and it turned out to be a really good product. The only problem with it is that its is a little too heavily perfumed that is my ONLY drawback that I can see. I use this in the morning along with [[ASIN:B00I0N24TY NuNutrients Vitamin C Serum - Anti-Aging Serum]] (specifically for around my eyes, which I highly, highly recommend), and i can literally see 5-10 years vanish from my face. I would also recommend getting a cleanser that you can use to exfoliate as well. If you do that you will see lines around your lips, and eyes just disappear.</li>
    <li> It works great on my sensitive skins. I love its light and moist texture. Happy to find this product.&lt;br /&gt;The package is broken when I open the box but fortunately the product is not affected.</li>
    <li> This works great!!! nice and cool and moisturizing!!</li>
    <li> When I moved to Colorado my skin was super dry. I used a clinique face lotion that dries out after a few hours. Since this is gel,it goes on smooth and really moisturizes. It&#x27;s not oily and drys fast. I recommend using this to my friends that go up in the mountains where it&#x27;s even dryer. LOVE this stuff.</li>
    <li> I like this stuff. Small amount but feels nice</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for quite a while now &amp; it leaves my skin soooo smooth. It really does make your skin feel refreshed &amp; you will see results right away. I used to have flaky, dry skin but this moisturizer has helped me so much. I have sensitive skin prone to breakouts &amp; haven&#x27;t had a breakout or anything. My skin loves this stuff. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A friend recommended this moisturizer to me. I used to use one of the Estee Lauder moisturizers &amp; this one gives me just as great (if not better) results than the expensive ones &amp; you save a ton of money. I definitely recommend this to everyone wanting smooth, healthy skin. :)</li>
    <li> Has a momentary cooling effect and hence refreshing. However it is a bit sticky. But does moisturize well. Lasts long as well. I use it occasionally and so I have had it for over a year but the gel looks and feels the same as new, has not changed in color or consistency.</li>
    <li> Hydrates really well! I needed it after winter dryness. I will definitely buy it again- it&#x27;s a great price for product.</li>
    <li> Leaves my face feeling moisturized without feeling greasy or sticky (blends well.) It gives it a nice cool aloe feeling. Great when my face gets really dry during winter months.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t really work on my face because it is a little bit irritating to my skin. However, I used it for my body, feels great. It runs very fast, I guess because I use this for my body. I am 24, asian. My skin gets really dry from oklahoma weather. I would like to get some recommendation for body moisture. I mean things really get absorbed on your skin.</li>
    <li> Pretty disappointed- saw quite a few good reviews on here so I thought I would try this out. Didn&#x27;t even open it yet and noticed that this &amp;#34; rescue refreshing gel&amp;#34; uses alcohol as a main ingredient!!! How could this be used as a moisturizer?! Also, after a little more research this product is also tested on animals!! Ugh!!! So disappointed in garner as I usually like their products!</li>
    <li> I bought a variety of &amp;#34;Garnier&amp;#34; products when I first began experimenting with facial products, and this gel is unique in their line! Oh,I like most of the line well enough, but most seem variations of each other. (not to say that&#x27;s a bad thing!) Anyway, this one is a light, fresh, somewhat tingly gel when first applied that absorbs quickly to a non-greasy, not too shiny finish. Some days I use only it, others I add it last to whatever else I&#x27;ve  applied beforehand, a flexible product in my view! Very attractive price when I bought it too, I try to always have a jar handy whether I&#x27;m currently using it or not. I very unscientifically bounce between products, but I do like this one, more all the time!</li>
    <li> I just got this today, even before looking at any of the reviews (after I purchased it, before I used it), it was love at first sight in the drug store. I have oily skin, and I have yet to find a gel moisturizer I was ready to commit to. I has tried high end samples from everywhere, and nothing did the job.&lt;br /&gt;The scent of this product is very light, I can barely smell it. If you&#x27;re not one for scents, it&#x27;s not overwhelming at all. I don&#x27;t mind my products having a little scent to them, and this one smells \\&quot;fresh\\&quot;, that is the only way I can really describe it.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s VERY refreshing to put on, especially after using my Clarisonic. I use my rose water toner, serum, argan oil, then this! I was so impressed with how it made my face feel. I always struggle with moisturizers making me look too oily, and it feels gross.&lt;br /&gt;After about 5 minutes, it really sinks it and settles nicely. I also don&#x27;t wear a lot of make-up, but if I were to...it would make the perfect canvas for it. It&#x27;s so smooth and radiant.&lt;br /&gt;LOVE LOVE LOVE!</li>
    <li> For context, I&#x27;ve tried a few Garnier products and have found them to be generally very good, with the Skin Renew moisturizer currently a part of my daily morning routine. I picked up this product because my normally combination/oily skin suddenly began developing dryness and pink patches of irritation. I needed something that would be super-hydrating yet gentle on my newly sensitive skin. The descriptions and most of the reviews seemed to indicate that this gel-cream fit the bill, but after about a week of daily a.m./p.m. use I&#x27;m a bit disappointed.    First, the texture was off-putting -- not unpleasant, per se, but when a skin care product is packaged in a jar, you expect it to have a thicker, more viscous consistency (especially when it&#x27;s labeled a gel-CREAM). This product looks and feels almost like un-set jell-o that was taken out of the fridge way, way, WAY too early. Not sure if somehow the jar I received came from an \\&quot;off\\&quot; batch, but my first thought is that it should have been packaged in a bottle with a pump dispenser.    On the plus side, the product absorbs quickly into skin without feeling greasy or leaving a lasting residue. Also, it has a pleasant fragrance, though I wouldn&#x27;t mind a lighter concentration of the scent. It did, however, make my irritated patches sting upon contact. And while my skin did feel refreshed, the hydration certainly didn&#x27;t last 24 hours as the description claims (even with consistent a.m. and p.m. use for a week). At best, I&#x27;d say the feeling of being moisturized lasts a couple hours.    In short, for the purpose of gentle yet intense moisturization (the reason I originally sought this product out), I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;d buy this again. On the other hand, if my skin were to calm down and return to my normal, nonsensitive oily/combo-type complexion, this product might be worth a second look.</li>
    <li> Keeps my face hydrated until I wash it. Has a great refreshing smell.  Doesn&#x27;t break out my skin. A tiny bit covers my whole face. Great product at a fraction of the cost of comparable products.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m really liking this product.  My acne-prone skin did not break out.  I have combo skin and since winter is dry, I sometimes add a bit of jojoba oil, and it&#x27;s perfect, but I usually just leave it as is.  Reminds me a lot of Clinique moisture surge gel I used a while back, but much better price.</li>
    <li> Easy to apply, not sticky, no residue, no rosacea bumps. I love it. I was worried that it would not moisturize well, but I was wrong.</li>
    <li> good product, my wife love it.</li>
    <li> Like it very light feeling on your face not oily at all. Wish I couldve brought a bigger container cause the smaller one doesnt look like it would last past next week</li>
    <li> So soft and comfy! I will buy it again.</li>
    <li> grape seed and vit e are known for anti oxidant properties.  I feel like my skin is cleaner and lighter.  I love that the dark spots  have lightened and my fine lines have decreased.  Really good product.</li>
    <li> I have combination skin. My oily spots are my forehead and chin. This gel is great, it doesn&#x27;t dry out my cheeks, but it keeps my forehead and chin from feeling/looking oily. I&#x27;ve been using this for over a week and don&#x27;t feel that it makes me break out or cause any other negative side effects.</li>
    <li> This gel-cream is sticky and cold. It was not appealing to wipe on my face. I did not think it provided long-lasting moisture. I would not buy it again.</li>
    <li> Bought this at General Dollar on a whim (Amazon is cheaper, will buy it here from now on) and I have to say this stuff is incredible. I have very sensitive skin that breaks out easily and haven&#x27;t had any problems using this gel. I&#x27;m also prone to headaches and stuffiness from most scents, but even though this product has a scent (kind of like Jean Nate) it hasn&#x27;t bothered me. Might have to try Jean Nate next!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for moisturizing, it &#x27;s perfect for me. I&#x27;m 52 and my skin is all over the place, dry,  normal and oil and the gel soothes the dryness and mattifies the oiliness. I have been using Rimmel 25-hour foundation because I love the gel-like qualities it has, filling in those little lines and wrinkles and firming the skin up a bit, but it breaks me out. Nonetheless, I kept using it because I liked what it did for my skin. Now that I&#x27;ve experienced this product, I&#x27;ll be foregoing the Rimmel and using the Garnier gel as a moisturizing primer under my cream foundation (Covergirl and Olay Simply Ageless) ... I love this foundation, but it does not glide on well and can go on heavy if you aren&#x27;t very, very careful. It doesn&#x27;t break me out, either, I can actually sleep in it. But it works and applies oh so perfectly with this Garnier gel under it. The lines, wrinkles fill in and the skin looks tighter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;May try it on my body next.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, buy it and try it. You might be like me who absolutely loves it!</li>
    <li> I like this a lot but it must be used with a light touch or it gets goopy and sort of rolls up on your skin. It sinks in really wll, which is what makes me think I can add another coating. The results of using it for a few months now are good, though not great. but I still use it and recommend it. Great price too!</li>
    <li> cheap and useful for my skin during the summer time. But for fall and winter time, it is not moisture enough. But for the summer time, it is really a good chice for me.</li>
    <li> I really enjoyed using this cream. It truly is refreshing and left no oily residue at all unlike most other facial moisturizers I&#x27;ve tried. It also is not heavily scented like some creams. I apply it once in the morning and it keeps my face from drying in the Northeast cold throughout the day without the need to reapply. One more application before bedtime also keeps your skin feeling refreshed in the morning. I highly recommend this product for anyone who has dry skin or just need protection from the winter cold.</li>
    <li> I just got what I wanted. it is very good for Oily skin. No greasy and very good cream.</li>
    <li> Goes on very light and clean, does indeed feel refreshing. This is my second purchase; have been through a lot of over facial creams that I&#x27;ve only bought one of.</li>
    <li> After cleansing and toning I make sure to use this. I then apply a cream facial mosturizer which seems to be the best combination to lock in moisture all day. I work in a plant where we work under industrial fans. The environment isnt really geared towards skin maintenance.  When I dont use my garnier, my face always seems to feel a little dry after a few hours (even with a cream moisturizer). This helps my skin stay hydrated, and its oil free, doesnt make my makeup clumpy, and helps me maintain my glow. I was actually looking for another product that id used before by searching &amp;#34;gel moisturizer&amp;#34; when I found this. It wasnt what I was looking for but gave me the same effect, as far as I can see.</li>
    <li> i really like this stuff ... very easy to apply on skin ... and smells really good :) i give it 4 stars :) will buy again :)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this cream/gel on mostly my knuckles and it worked fairly well for that part; however I have switched to Neutrogena&#x27;s Norwegian Formula Hand Cream - amazing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I finally used this stuff on my face today, after cleansing my face---and oh my god WTF is in this stuff!?!?!?!?! My face was burning for some time after I applied it---I couldn&#x27;t take it, I had to wipe my face with a towel, as of writing this review it&#x27;s now been about 10 hours-- I just looked in the mirror earlier and noticed my face is significantly RED And my face feels hot without the need to touch it :x--and when I DO touch it, it&#x27;s freaking hot -.-&#x27;&#x27;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff is crap :/ I had high hopes for it--but I will have to look elsewhere. Also if it&#x27;s worth mentioning I bought this at a local drugstore, Walgreens I believe.</li>
    <li> gel like consistency, feels cool when applied and dries/ absorbs quickly, must put very little only otherwise its sort of flaky when it dries, Needs to be applied more than am and pm time if your skin is very dry.</li>
    <li> I like this product. Love the smell and coolness on my skin. Def. helps with keeping moisture with out making your skin oily.</li>
    <li> I wanted to love this product but my skin could not. I have sensitive combo skin and although this product didn&#x27;t make me break out (thank god), my skin did instantly turn red and felt like it was slightly sunburned. Unfortunately something (probably the fragrance or citrus acid) made me have an allergic reaction and I gave it to a friend who loves it! for anyone with sensitive skin looking for a night cream, I highly recommend the Burts Bee&#x27;s Sensitive Night Cream</li>
    <li> it is ok,thick gel with plentiful moisture water. good for summer,but not enough for winter.</li>
    <li> Absolutely LOVE this cream, it&#x27;s probably my third one. Very light, smells awesome, and absorbs super fast. I have very gentle combination skin that tends to be more on the dry side, this cream literary make my skin super soft and so normal. No shine forehead or dry cheeks, my whole face feels just amazing!</li>
    <li> A great product.  I&#x27;m a fan of Garnier&#x27;s shin and hair lines.</li>
    <li> Do not keep creams &amp; makeup sitting on ur skin for 24hrs 😀 I like this moisturizer due to it&#x27;s scent &amp; fast absorbency rate. A little goes a long way. I did have to reapply after 6-8hrs. I have dry, flaky skin on my T-zone. This is not at all greasy. I don&#x27;t know if it would break you out but it didn&#x27;t for me.</li>
    <li> This stuff feels so good when you put it on. It&#x27;s really cooling and I can&#x27;t wait to try it after a good workout. I only use this at night because it doesn&#x27;t keep my skin as matte under makeup as my CereVe AM moisturizer. If it was just a tiny bit more matte on me, i would def. give it 5 stars.</li>
    <li> Ah its got magical powers I tell you! I only use this as a night cream because it doesn&#x27;t have spf. But ever since I started using it my daily breakouts have stopped and my skin is actually starting to look better.</li>
    <li> Cooling, pleasant smell, no messy residue.Quick and easy to use. Makes skin nice and soft. You want more words Amazon? What more can I say?</li>
    <li> I have very dry skin,and yet when I use other moisturizers they make my face feel too greasy or sticky. Some moisturizers even cause acne flare ups. I had no such problems with Garnier Moisture Rescue. This gel-cream hydrates my skin without making me feel greasy,and it&#x27;s very lightly scented whereas other moisturizers are heavily scented and irritate my face. I&#x27;ve tried every lotion and cream available,and this is the only moisturizer that works for me.</li>
    <li> I started using this product about 1 1/2 years ago and haven&#x27;t looked back. It&#x27;s light so I don&#x27;t feel like my skin is coated in gunk and my skin feels great. I keep coming back for more.</li>
    <li> i love this product. its the very first moisturizer that i can use with out it making my skin feel oily. i have acne prone skin so this product does not aggravate my skin at all. the purchase price is fantastic.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m an adult male who is one of the \\&quot;lucky\\&quot; ones to have acne-prone, combination skin along with a mild case of dermatitis.  I use benzoyl peroxide products which tends to leave my face dry and scaly (and the dermatitis doesn&#x27;t help either).  I traditionally used cream-based face lotions which tended to make my face feel greasy and didn&#x27;t always alleviate my dry skin.  I ran out of my existing Neutrogena face lotion and decided to see if I can find something better for my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Garnier product sounded promising being a gel-based form and the great reviews on here convinced me to try it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, I&#x27;m happy to report that this gel has worked wonders for my skin.  First of all, it&#x27;s very light and goes on the skin smooth.  After I put it on, my skin feels refreshed and cool.  Second, it works very well all day to keep my skin hydrated and moisturized.  Lastly, it actually helps calm down my dermatitis and my face does not feel irritated as much as it used to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really hope they keep making this product as I will be a life-long consumer as long as it&#x27;s around.  It works that well for my skin.</li>
    <li> This product has made an amazing difference in my skin. The area under my eyes and around my cheeks looks really smooth and refreshed. I absolutely love this product!</li>
    <li> I have oily skin and somehow it doesn&#x27;t make it oilier. It&#x27;s not oily nor sticky, it smells nice and left my face feeling smooth.</li>
    <li> I have oily skin that is very prone to breakouts, and almost every cream I use to protect my face from New York winters (harsh, cold, awful) just make my skin gross. I use this every morning before heading out and at night if I feel like my face is dry. It works great as a preventative treatment; it won&#x27;t do much to heal skin, but this is the first winter ever where I haven&#x27;t had chaffing on my face from the wind and cold. I have used it consistently and it does protect my skin!</li>
    <li> Like the cleanser/gel, I broke out with this and the other one just like it (pink colored one). I can&#x27;t seem to use these products. Love the gel like lotion, but wasn&#x27;t made for me.</li>
    <li> I have always had oily skin and I since I am 32 now I wanted to help my skin.  I have always hated moisturizing because of my skin being so oily.  This product is perfect!  It is not heavy and it does not make my skin more oily.  I am so glad I found a product to help my skin.  It really softens it.</li>
    <li> I love the smell of this product. I love the way it looks and feels on my skin. However, it made me breakout and must have made my skin too oily. I gave it a chance and used it for a few weeks to see if my skin would adjust but it did not. That doesn&#x27;t mean it will make someone else breakout. I would give it a try and see what happens.</li>
    <li> This moisturizer is great! It is really light, great for neutral skin. My face gets pretty dry during the winter and this works perfectly.</li>
    <li> I have gifted this item to my dad. He loved it. Especially in humid weather, it keep the skin light and smooth. It does not make the skin sticky or dry. I will buy it again.</li>
    <li> is perfect for my skin and it became my favorite cream does not block the pores and moisturizes leaving skin very silky, non-greasy</li>
    <li> This is a very good gel cream. My other moisturizer was kind of heavy and was clogging my pores, so I wanted something light and refreshing. This is just that. I love it! There is a nice scent and a refreshing tingle when you put it on your face. It soaks in immediately. and makes skin soft and smooth. Very nice.</li>
    <li> My skin is extremely dry during the winter months and every year I struggle with the top and bottom of my eye lids cracking. Also my forehead is very dry but it doesn&#x27;t crack, the skin just feels very rough. I was looking for a product that didn&#x27;t break the bank but still helped my issue. The only other product that I&#x27;ve found to heal my dry skin was vaseline, and I didn&#x27;t want to trade dry skin for acne so I started looking for something else. Within the first 3-4 days I noticed a big change in the dry skin on my forehead, and my eye lids were starting to heal. Mind you, for the first day or two as soon as my skin would soak up the gel-cream I would reapply it. The gel-cream is very off putting at first but I don&#x27;t care about how weird it is/feels now because my skin is completely hydrated. This product is awesome and I will continue to buy it!!</li>
    <li> This product is amazing! i have dry skin and my dermatologist told me i need to keep it hydrated. i tried something from clinque but thought it felt to greasy. this is exactly what they say it is, super refreshing! it makes my skin smoother and i feel refreshed.i use 2x a day</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a moisturizer for my slight oily/combo skin. This one is perfect!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried Sephora&#x27;s gel moisturizer and it was NOT worth $20. It did not keep me from getting oily. But this is awesome. It dries very quickly, and you only need a little. I can tell this product is going to last me a long time. Totally worth the money.</li>
    <li> This is a great and very affordable moisturizer. It soaks in easily and smells good, it is perfect for sensitive skin. I saw results within days.</li>
    <li> Leaves skin moisturized and has a nice texture to apply on face. It lasts a long time.&lt;br /&gt;I alternate using it nightly</li>
    <li> It moisturizers well and is fairly cheap compared to other products but this made my skin itch very bad I don&#x27;t know what I&#x27;m allergic to because of the big scientific words used but this is not for me. But I&#x27;m happy for all the other people it worked out for.</li>
    <li> This light gel moisturizer works wonderfully, my skin feels soft and moisturized and even looks clearer! The only downside...no SPF. Which is ok if you use foundation with sunscreen, but I prefer to have SPF in my moisturizer for added sun protection. Overall, great product!</li>
    <li> I would rate it as good as H20 gel cream.  it&#x27;s good to lay this as a base below another type of richer cream.</li>
    <li> cool and comfy...this product is light and makes your skin feel wonderful.have been using this product for a while.really love it</li>
    <li> I love this gel cream! This is my 3rd jar I just bought. I have really noticed my skin looking and feeling better. I really have dry skin and this has helped a lot, plus there is no greasy feeling left on my hands or face. I even use it on my elbows!</li>
    <li> A cool moisturizing lotion that goes deep into the skin and has no fatty or shiny effecton the face.Love it since they brought it on the market.</li>
    <li> it goes on like a gel and dries leaving my face with a shiny finish. i don&#x27;t know how to explain it, but it is not pleasant. i was looking for a light moisturizer to use since i have oily skin, but it makes it appear even shinier than it actually is. this was a waste of money and is going out in the trash. cetaphil moisturizer is a much better product. i&#x27;ve been using it for a while and should have just stuck with it.</li>
    <li> This is the lightest feeling and best-smelling moisturizer I have ever used.  The texture is absolutely perfect, it did not agitate my hyper-sensitive skin, and it felt refreshing and weightless.  It is fantastic for both night and day, and wears beautifully under makeup!</li>
    <li> finally a great face cream that provides great moisture without a greasy feeling like some other products  and  it smells  very good</li>
    <li> Fast shipping,  I added this on because it had great reviews and I loved it, goes on very smooth and smells so nice, like a mini spa in a jar</li>
    <li> not sure if i will buy it again since it doesnt rescue my skin from dryness--i find myself using it a few times every few hours. however, it is light and non-greasy. for the price, it may be worth a try for you</li>
    <li> I love this moisturizer and like I said, it&#x27;s been the only kind I&#x27;ve used consistently for years. I&#x27;m a cosmetic junky and I&#x27;m always trying new products, so it&#x27;s a big deal for me to stick with the same product for a while. I love how it doesn&#x27;t give me an oily sheen like regular lotion moisturizers do. It really takes down redness and irritation if I exfoliate too much or I had a stubborn pimple. It never makes me breakout and it gives me a really smooth feel. Putting powder foundation on after I apply this is a dream, due to the smoothness it gives me. It&#x27;s so lightweight and improves my completion. I&#x27;ll be lost if it ever gets discontinued!</li>
    <li> bought this cream gel at target after reading all the comments here...I used youth code from loreal last month but it clog my pores and gave me millions of acne which I fought like world war 3 goshhhhhhhh then I decided to changed it and got this one, every morning and  b4 bed time I washed my face with Aveeno cleansing bar anti-blemish bar soap then rinse it off then I use cotton balls to clean excess dirt and dries skin then I put proactive treatment cream let it dry then I put this cream I feel so fresh and very light to my skin,i work 8 hours but still my skin feel soft and fresh after work..so far so good...and take note if you are not working 8 hours under the sun do not use sunscreen because it will darken your skin,clog your pores and more oily skin.so I recommend this product to those people that don&#x27;t like oily moisturizer,light and don&#x27;t like clog pores.</li>
    <li> I make sure that my face stays clear but when it comes to a good moisturizer, it is hard to find one that matches with my combination to oily skin. Low and behold, this product works wonderful night and day. You use very little and you skin is smooth and I get compliments about how flawless my skin looks. Rarely get breakouts now as I use this in conjunction with Aveeno Positively Radiant Cleansing Pads and also L&#x27;oreal 360 acne prevention wash. This is a must have, so please try it out</li>
    <li> It goes on great, has to go on a clean just washed face or it doesn&#x27;t feel right. I put it under my face primer and it makes it go on smoother I really like this and it is comparable to more expensive moisturizers I&#x27;ve used in the past. A little bit goes a long way so it should last.</li>
    <li> Non sticky and greasy gel cream gives skin feels fresh and cool. This cream sure let my face feel fresh whole day.</li>
    <li> it doesn&#x27;t feel oily and nasty on your face and I like the smell of it, fresh. I&#x27;ve only used it for a few weeks and so far I like it</li>
    <li> My lips were chapping off the other day, so I put the Gel-cream on. It healed in less than 30 seconds. But of course, it hurts first. I take this as it works like a champ. There is smell that comes with it neither. It just feels nice.</li>
    <li> I have oily combination skin but I still need moisture after striping my face of all the oil and dirt. I read the reviews and decided to give it a try and love it! This is a very good product, high recommend it.</li>
    <li> Garnier is becoming a favorite of mine for beauty products. This gel cream is very light and provides just enough moisture to keep my skin going all day and without breakouts. I love it and recommend it without worry.</li>
    <li> I use this product as my nighttime product after washing.  It feels wonderful when I put it on and the gel soaks in quickly leaving my skin refreshed and soft.  I really do enjoy using it.  Moisture Rescue will be a staple.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This item feels wonderful and makes my skin feel soft . . . yes, I definitely recommend this product!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t usually write reviews for products, but holy softness, Batman!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a 20 year old female, and I have acne on my cheeks/jaw and oily skin everywhere else. I have never used a moisturizer for my face before because I was only ever focused on getting rid of my acne. So, I decided to buy this (along with Garnier&#x27;s Blackhead Eliminating Scrub). I cannot attest to the scrub yet because I just started it today.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But holy cannolis on rye!!!!!!!! This moisturizer makes my skin feel extremely soft. Like BAM BAM! In yo&#x27; face! Literally! It does so without making your face feel like you took a bath in 50 cheeseburgers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Being a girl with acne, to have face products that don&#x27;t contribute to the red devil on my face are a must. And having the product make my skin feel like a hundred bucks (c&#x27;mon a million would be overselling it just a bit, for that you&#x27;d need like a giant diamond to rub your face with. Because when you&#x27;re rich, that&#x27;s all you do), is a giant plus like the Swiss flag!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But don&#x27;t take my word for it. Try it yourself! Thankfully, it isn&#x27;t that expensive. So even ramen-eating college kids, or really anyone that eats ramen for almost every meal (which clearly isn&#x27;t me *nervous laugh*), can afford it! Barely. I&#x27;m just kidding. Seriously, this stuff is fantastic!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I mean, it&#x27;s totally up to you. You don&#x27;t HAVE to have soft skin. But if you want it, this is your product.</li>
    <li> My GO-TO moisturizer...day &amp; night!</li>
    <li> I have sensitive combination skin. I am passionate about skin care. I bought this product because I wanted a light moisturizer with Vitamin E, to use beneath my sunscreen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ingredients in this gel-cream are not very impressive. Vitamin E is pretty low on the list; it seems to be mostly water and silicone. The name, \\&quot;gel-cream\\&quot; is really just a gimmick; it appears to be a translucent, watery lotion. By \\&quot;refreshing\\&quot;, I am guessing they mean \\&quot;cooling\\&quot;; the high amount of alcohol cools the skin as it evaporates. That much alcohol can also be drying over time. I found that the glycerin in this product left my skin feeling kind of tacky, and looking shiny, after use, but did not provide much moisture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall this isn&#x27;t much of a moisturizer. As it has no SPF, I can&#x27;t imagine why someone with oily skin would need it (as a sunscreen would be enough for them) and I can&#x27;t see a person with dry or combination skin liking it either. It is just okay for use under sunscreen; eventually, as the weather became colder and dryer, I began adding a few drops of Vitamin E to make it more moisturizing, so I can use up this jar. I won&#x27;t repurchase.</li>
    <li> I do love this face gel, it feels fantastic on my crazy parched skin.  I have sensitive skin, and I use retinol, which makes my face peel and turn red the next day (not a good look!).  I have tried countless face creams, and they either make my face more irritated, or don&#x27;t help at all with the peeling, even after a few reapplications.  Just one swipe of this makes my skin cool and completely moisturizes it-no more peeling! I can&#x27;t believe it! This is just a fantastic face cream and the price on amazon is several dollars cheaper than in the stores.  I love it! It doesn&#x27;t break me out at all, and almost everything else does! I do use it during the day as well as at night, so I wish it had a sunscreen for the day. That is the only negative thing I can say about it. It&#x27;s still worth it!! If you are on the fence, just try it! You will be so impressed! Use it a few times, and for a crazy burst of freshness, store it in the fridge.  Awesome!</li>
    <li> I was looking for something lightweight, that would still be moisturizing.  This does that nicely, I just wish there wasn&#x27;t so much fragrance in it. Its not overpowering but I prefer my moisturizers to have no scent.  Its not a bad moisturizer.  I&#x27;m also acne prone and so far, no breaking out, thats a plus.</li>
    <li> really great product for my combo skin, but really more for the summer for me. this winter has been a nightmare on my skin. noticeable dry patches on my forehead that this product does nothing for. still my go-to for every other season though.</li>
    <li> I love this lotion! Very light gel with a light smell. Moisturizes perfectly and evenly.</li>
    <li> The smell is great and it only take a little bit on your palm and it goes a long way.  It cools the skin and softens very well.  I use it every night.</li>
    <li> This gel-cream is absolutely wonderful.  my face is left hydrated and makes applying my foundation so much easier.  I&#x27;m glad i found this product.  it keeps my skin moisturised for the whole day.  i apply twice per day - morning and night and a little goes a LONG way!!!</li>
    <li> Wow I can truly say that this product works wonders. When I say that I have tried everything I mean EVERYTHING. I have EXTREMELY oily and sensitive skin to the point where products such as Aveeno, Cetaphil, Olay, Neutrogena....etc have only caused me to break out every time. I&#x27;m allergic to products with nuts in them such as coconut or cocoa or shea so to find something that I can apply daily w/o having to run and immediately wash it off or wake up with bumps all over my face feels so nice.</li>
    <li> Love this product. Use it almost every night.</li>
    <li> It moisturizes my face without making it feel too wet and dried up the extra oils from my t area quite well</li>
    <li> This is by far my favorite face &amp;#34;lotion&amp;#34;. Because really, it isn&#x27;t a lotion. It feels almost like water when you&#x27;re putting it on. No left over residue, just soft skin. If you have severe dry skin on your face, this probably isn&#x27;t the best product. If your dry skin is mild, this does the trick. Plus, it smells good! My husband always says, &amp;#34;you smell really good babe&amp;#34; right after I&#x27;ve applied this stuff. Not after perfume spraying or showering. Go figure.</li>
    <li> I bought this cream 3.&lt;br /&gt;cheap and good.&lt;br /&gt;My husband like too.&lt;br /&gt;My husband like too.&lt;br /&gt;My husband like too.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried so many moisturizers in the past but this one takes the cake for me!! It doesn&#x27;t leave your face feeling heavy or too creamy. It hydrates your face, has a great texture and the smell is just divine. My face feels so smooth and silky after a few minutes of applying it!! The cost is great for a product so great. Try it if you haven&#x27;t, you won&#x27;t regret it!!</li>
    <li> my favorite face lotion ever! feels so good and refreshing :)</li>
    <li> I have always been hesitant to put on moisturizers because I hate the way they feel on my face. But this one instantly absorbs into the skin. Tons of moisture with no sticky feeling afterwards.</li>
    <li> Couldn&#x27;t find this in my local drug store anymore so turned to Amazon. Really like this gel-cream-it feels so cool and soothing going on and makes my skin so soft. Please do not stop selling this product!!</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And it smells great! I have very dry skin, and hate the way lotion feels on my face. I especially hate the way dirt and such sticks on my skin because of lotion.  Even riding over 80 miles in 90 degree weather on my motorcycle after applying this gel in the morning, there was little to no road dirt/dust sticking to my face. Besides that it&#x27;s so lightweight I didn&#x27;t sweat it off either.</li>
    <li> THIS IS AN EXCELLENT PRODUCT. HYDRATE THE FACE WITH NO GREASE AND HEAVY FEELING. BETTER THAN OTHER EXPENSIVE BRANDS AND IS AFFORDABLE.</li>
    <li> i like it. its not sticky</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t like the feel of this on my face as it dried. Too chemical-y and it didn&#x27;t seem like it was doing much by way of moisturizing.</li>
    <li> Quick shipping, it works good for someone like me and my fiance who struggle with dry facial skin.  We both have seen a progress within a few days. I will be buying again but for cheaper with coupons.</li>
    <li> It is gel-cream, literarily. It is not oily, not greasy but it can moisture my skin perfectly. Loved it. I&#x27;m so happy to find a super-market moisture that satisfy my skin.</li>
    <li> I absolutely LOVE this moisturizer given why I have been using it for past 5 years. It&#x27;s of a gel texture hence it&#x27;s extremely lightweight and absorbs super duper fast. I like to use it in the mornings when I wash my face and before applying makeup. It sort of even acts out as a primer with mineral makeup. Love the scent, the texture and how it does not break out my skin. Mind you I have a oily skin which dries out very fast when I wash it. This  jar also lasts me for two months or so when I use it daily in the mornings. Definitely something that has lasted a very very long time on my skin care shelf :)</li>
    <li> Another great Garnier product! This stuff leaves my face feeling hydrated, clean &amp; soft. I have really dry, sensitive &amp; fair skin. I use to use garnier lotion moisturizer which works really well, but this works soooo much better for my skin. Usually after I put on blush or powder my face looks a little bit chalky on some areas. So, I just use a pea size amount to smooth on my hands then dab on the dry areas. I usually use this before I put make up on too and it makes it look much smoother. It feels great when you put it on too. Nice cooling feeling and not sticky or anything. I have used severeal of garniers face products and they all work great on my skin. My husband also uses there products. He use to have horrible, I mean, really bad acne a few years ago. Their face scrub helped him a ton!!! I highly recommend any of their other face products. I have used most of them and loved them all. The only ones I haven&#x27;t tried are their anti-aging products.</li>
    <li> Especially great for oily skin.  Refreshing for skin that is prone to break outs.  Non-oily and makes a perfect makeup base.</li>
    <li> This cream is horrible. It left my skin in rashes and red dots that I never had before. At first I thought maybe I had allergies but once I stopped using it, my face slowly returned to normal ( it still took about 2-3 days!) I wasn&#x27;t completely sure yet though so I kept it and my sister used it and now her face is ruined too. I&#x27;m not completely sure what is in here, but it definitely seems toxic and will never go anywhere near my skin again.</li>
    <li> Extra good to my sensitive skin. Feel the difference and its not even a week. Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> It was definitely a lighter moisturizer than many others I&#x27;ve  found. I ended up subscribing to get some every couple months for almost two years since I  liked it so much.</li>
    <li> I have oily skin and I love this product!! I was told by a dermatologist I needed to find a moisturizing GEL rather than a lotion. After a few times of purchasing a similar product from Shisedo, I decided to look for something a little more budget friendly and this is it. I personally like the smell and my face does not get oily with application. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I use this product all year round because it is a gentle moisture gel that can be used over makeup to freshen up your look..plus I use it on days when I do not want to wear any make and it does just the trick plus it seems to make my skin glow.</li>
    <li> this is the only moisturizer that straddles the line for my daughter in law between moisturizing too much and causing additional breakouts, and not moisturizing enough and her having dry skin.  she&#x27;d tried all the brands out there and lucked into the garnier product and has been very pleased (for reference, she&#x27;s a lightly competed Asian skin tone)</li>
    <li> A really good moisturizer. Don&#x27;t let the amount of it fool you, you can easy just dab a fingertip of this stuff to your entire face and it&#x27;ll work very well. It definitely makes my face feel fresh and smooth after applying it and the problems with skin moisture just go away after putting this on, especially after a shave or a scrub. I honestly have zero complaints about this product.</li>
    <li> Feels amazing on my skin so light and refreshing! I will never stop using this product!</li>
    <li> I have tried so many costly serums, cremes and the list goes on to get rid of my dry, dull looking mature skin.&lt;br /&gt;Finally this is the product&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My daughter uses the Garnier day lotion with SPF , love the smell on it and the texture and use it on occassions , then I saw this for this amazing price on Amazon and ordered it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway you apply this, is it an amazing product.&lt;br /&gt;I can use it under my make up, and it eliminates the PRIMER (I use cinema secrets foundation highly recommend it, for mature, dry skin , acne adult prone skin , anyone who needs buildable coverage or just a little make up, it is so versitile, but being a creme foundation it needs a good moisturizing base) and the garnier moisture resuce gel is amazing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It feels nice fresh, and being a gel it is NOT sticky at all. A little goes such a long way !&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using it as base of my make up ( at times I use a bit of hyaluronic acid, awesome product !under it) , and when finished ( if you want to try the cinema secrets foundation, or actually any other foundation, even liquid, give it a try and us a 1 dollar elf brush(Target) and lightly buff the foundation in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am not sure how it works but the garnier gel cream brings out the best in my make up.&lt;br /&gt;I do have acne scars and yet with the combination of these products and able to apply the products for a natural look yet very nice flawless coverage !&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To freshen up , put a little of the gel cream in a little tiny pot you can carry in your purse and refresh your look - I only use a couple dabs, use very little at first to see how it works with your foundation, especially if you are using a liquid one, and it will just give you a nice fresh look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You know the kind you see on some ladies in their 60th or older that seem to still have a nice fresh look on their cheeks, I think I found out their secret:) Garnier Moisture rescue Gel Cream&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend this product especially for under $ 7!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I finally found my HG in a primer, moisturizer!</li>
    <li> I really like this gel.  It goes on easily and disappears quickly leaving my skin feeling nice and refreshed.  I look forward to using it this summer in the heat.</li>
    <li> I have a super very dry sensitive skin, I always need to put a thick layer of cream to prevent my face getting dry day and night. BUT, Garnier Moisture Rescue Refreshing Gel-Cream is different. All I need is just a very thin layer will be enough, it keeps my face moist and smooth whole day long. I LOVE IT.</li>
    <li> This product is terrific for the price.  Don&#x27;t expect this to take over some $50 product but for what you pay, my face feels a noticeable difference and feels softer and hydrated.  I use this at night prior to bed time.  I&#x27;m tell you the momment you run it into your skin you can feel it giving your skin the much needed hydration.</li>
    <li> Bought this because it had good reviews. I love the smell, I love the light texture, but not the fact that this stuff made my skin break out. No thank you!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t really understand all the good reviews... This didn&#x27;t do anything for me, and it kind of &amp;#34;sits&amp;#34; on top of my skin and feels a little tacky (sticky). It is really an average product! The smell is very atypical of drugstore stuff, just meh. I would give it 2.5 stars.. I have normal to dry skin, and I recommend the Lancome tonique confort toner.</li>
    <li> makes my makeup slip off</li>
    <li> Love the way it feels, light and refreshing!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never tried a gel moisturizer before, but thought I would give this a shot. After using it alone a few times, I decided to apply a lotion to my face first because it just wasn&#x27;t giving me enough moisture. However, my skin is pretty dry these days since it is winter and I will probably use this product without lotion in summer. I feel like the gel definitely &#x27;locks in&#x27; moisture and leaves my skin feeling smooth.</li>
    <li> it just wasn&#x27;t for me it dryed out my face horribly what floats one boat could sink the next so give it a try</li>
    <li> i will swear by this stuff forever.  i have weird combination skin that is also sensitive as hell.  this stuff combined with thayers twice a day has literally made my skin perfection.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure how i feel about this. I guess it&#x27;s a good product but it isn&#x27;t as good for oily skin</li>
    <li> If you are looking for a good moisturizer this one can&#x27;t be beat.  I use it in the evening and it is cooling, not a bad benefit especially with someone going through hot flashes :)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m enjoying this product. It definitely does what it says it does.</li>
    <li> I have tried may facial cream to help with dry skin.  I found that I don&#x27;t like the feel of most of them on my skin.  This is light.  I don&#x27;t notice it, but it helps with the dryness.  Along with this moisturizer, I also use Garnier Ultra-Lift at night.</li>
    <li> My 24 year old daughter loves this product as much as I do. Feels good on the skin; not greasy...but nice and smooth and soaks in very pleasantly.  Light fragrance.  Perfect skin product</li>
    <li> Makes my skin feel soft and comfortable. Erases first signs of aging. Hydrates very well. Oil free, won&#x27;t clog pores. I wish it had SPF, other than that this moisturizer is great!</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. . So light when applied,  I ran out between auto shipping and my face had gone to hell.. will not let this happen again</li>
    <li> Refreshing and light feel in the skin. Not super moisturizing, but I&#x27;d recommend for women who do not wear a lot of makeup and don&#x27;t have dry skin.</li>
    <li> Best moisturizer I have found.</li>
    <li> Love this item. My skin tells me it feels good!!</li>
    <li> Very nice to wear under makeup</li>
    <li> I try other moisturizers and keep coming back to this one.  It only takes a small amount at a time and I use it for both day and night moisturizing.  It is not greasy, has a fresh fragrance and absorbs well.  I still use and eye cream first.  It add the needed hydration to my face and my foundation goes on smoothly.  Please note this is not a wrinkle reducing moisturizer but mostly for hydration which is what I need.  For the price, it is worth a try.  If you don&#x27;t care for it, you can always use it on your hands.</li>
    <li> This is not a cream, more of a gel, that when applied to your face does get absorbed surprisingly well and cleanly. Feels good. That said, its less of a stand-alone daily moisturizer (I think) and more of something to use in conjunction with a cream-based daily moisturizer. Still, great product -- feels nice.</li>
    <li> Thought I bought something to wake up my face. I was not aware it is to be use on my hair I have to try it on my hair now</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve seen this product advertised in many magazines and decided to buy it from Amazon after reading all the amazing reviews, and I was not disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin is extremely sensitive - I&#x27;ve broken out in irritating rashes and acne from using Neutrogena, Clinique, Clean &amp; Clear, and Lancome products before - , and it was super dry before I looked around for a new moisturizer, so it&#x27;s pretty difficult to find a good product for my skin. Not to mention, I also have a tendency for eye irritation to anything with a strong fragrance, so I was apprehensive about this cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This moisturizer completely restored my dry, flaky skin. My skin can now withstand cold, dry winters. I&#x27;ve never had such smooth and clear skin before. It&#x27;s very absorbent and lightweight at the same time, and it wasn&#x27;t damaging in any way to my skin at all. The smell didn&#x27;t bother me at all, and it made me feel very refreshed. The jar might seem small, but it lasts for awhile, considering the quality of it. Moreover, my makeup goes on more smoothly and lasts longer after using this moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I dab it on every morning, and it keeps my skin moisturized for the entire day. You do not need a lot. A little goes a long way. I bought it in February and it lasted me until June, for a total of four months of use - an amazing deal for such a wonderful product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Forget all those expensive moisturizers. This is all you need.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE (4/19/15): I started using this product in 2011, and 4 years later, it’s still my go-to moisturizer. For reference, I have combination skin (used to have dry skin). I started using this moisturizer when I was 18, and I’m 22 now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, protip: Amazon usually has really good prices with the S&amp;S option, and they have the $1/$1.50 off coupon from time to time, to save you even more money. That means that there are times when it’ll only cost you under $5 to buy this moisturizer.</li>
    <li> My skin is very \\&quot;combination\\&quot;- sometimes regular lotion still leaves me skin feeling dry, but throughout the day I can get greasy and need to use pressed powder.  This is by far the best moisturizer I&#x27;ve ever used.  I picked it up randomly when I ran out of my last moisturizer, and I was skeptical when I got home and opened up the package to find that it actually is a gel- it doesn&#x27;t look anything like lotion.  It works SO. DARN. WELL.  After the first time I used it I was really impressed with how it absorbed into my skin and made my skin feel really really soft but not greasy or like I&#x27;d used moisturizer.  After using it for several days, I&#x27;ve noticed that my skin is more even during the day- I feel like my skin is actually producing less oil while still feeling soft and moisturized.  Also, I like that it doesn&#x27;t take much.  I can already tell the jar will last a long time.</li>
    <li> I love this especially for summer!  You need moisture, even if you have oily or combo skin, I keep this in the refrigerator, in the summer, when we have those soupy humid days we get in Baltimore, and it is so soothing, and cooling!</li>
    <li> I love this product.  It moisturizes without leaving a heavy residue or clogging your pores.  It&#x27;s light and very refreshing, good for day or night time applications.  Good to use alone or under foundation make-up.  Have been using for over one year and plan on continuing to use.</li>
    <li> I love the feeling of smooth subtle skin- I find if I make it part of my nightmare routine.  I wouldn&#x27;t hesitate to re-order.</li>
    <li> This product makes you feel too much moisture and sticky. I thought it could dry a little bit but not.</li>
    <li> i have very oily skin and i use this product in combination with sun screen and my skin is not oily when i use it…. i love it soo much</li>
    <li> So cool for skin, quenches dryness and locks moisture. will buy over and over again.&lt;br /&gt;Lali</li>
    <li> Went from a high-end brand to this and am not disappointed! Great purchase and I am sure I will be buying more.</li>
    <li> I bought this at Target for $5.99. I normally use the dry skin formula but they were sold out.&lt;br /&gt;I tried normal/combo skin formula and i love this one better. It has a tingly feeling once you apply it.&lt;br /&gt;I like the scent.it&#x27;s so clean and fresh smelling. The gel formula is light weight and oil free. I can&#x27;t ask for anything more.&lt;br /&gt;I have extremely sensitive skin and this does not irritate my eczema. Great purchase and product.</li>
    <li> love the clear and clean feel, also love the smell of it.&lt;br /&gt;Brand is good too. price is OK so far.</li>
    <li> After reading great reviews, I decided to give this one a shot- I think it&#x27;s fabulous! It definitely makes the sensitive, dry skin around my eyes feel much more hydrated, supple, and refreshed! it provides a great cooling feeling too.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never tried this before I bought it here at walgreens.com because of the high reviews.  I&#x27;m glad I did because it&#x27;s very soothing and makes my face feel very soft.  I put it on, rub it in and then use my other cream after a bit on top of it.  I&#x27;ll be using the all the time now.  I recommend it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for three years. I&#x27;m 23 yrs old and I started noticing little lines around my eyes since I started wearing makeup. I knew I needed to do something. This is full of hydration! It looks like you see on the packaging, like a mint green colored gel thats goes on the face very smooth and even. You dont have to even use a lot, just use your finger tip to dab a bit on and it covers the whole face. I have sensitive/combination skin and this gel cream is cooling, fast absorbing without leaving residue or streaks and great at soothing skin around the eyes. The smell is very light like cucumber/dew melonish. This is my only moisturizer for morning/night and for $7(at walmart) it&#x27;s as good as the $100 stuff. You won&#x27;t be dissapointed.</li>
    <li> I love this moisturizer, it is very light and I can wear it under makeup. It feels cool and refreshing and doesn&#x27;t make me break out. This is definitely more of a day time product. Even with oily skin, you still need to keep your skin well moisturized so I use the one for dry skin at night. I&#x27;m glad I can get this on Amazon, my local pharmacy only sometimes carries this</li>
    <li> Subscribe and SAve....EXCELLENT PRODUCT ....not heavy, hydrates as described....I have used this product for a year and love it.no breakouts, lightweight , hydrates very well.</li>
    <li> I would definitely not recommend this product, unless maybe you have very oily skin. This gel moisturizer made my skin feel so dry, and I have combination normal-oily skin. At first when I started using it I thought it was great and I didn&#x27;t need to apply much product, and then over time I had to apply more and more because my skin was getting flaky and dry in the middle of the summer when skin is supposed to be the most oily. I finally realized it was because of this product when I noticed that one of the main ingredients is alcohol (third ingredient), which is so terrible and drying for your skin among other harmful effects! Skin products should not contain alcohols, PERIOD!</li>
    <li> Loved this, Freshens up my combination skin to the point it soaks up all the product. not sticky at all.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve run across this moisturizer so many times, but never purchased it. Don&#x27;t ask me why I didn&#x27;t because the price is right and it has great ingredients, but I just wasn&#x27;t sure if it was right for my oily, acne-prone skin. I get mostly hormonal acne, yet my skin is sensitive so I have to watch what I use. This has been really wonderful for me! A little goes a long way and it dries quickly. Yes it&#x27;s a gel, but it&#x27;s not too watery. It spreads easily and smells wonderful. I can&#x27;t say enough great things about it! It doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin or hormonal breakouts, and I&#x27;ve actually been breaking out less since using it.</li>
    <li> I was in need for a face moisturizer because this terrible winter weather in Philadelphia was drying out my skin and hitting my face hard. I scoured Amazon and looked at more than 10 different moisturizers within my budget before settling on this one based on the reviews.&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this product for about a month now and ABSOLUTELY LOVE IT!  I have sensitive skin and am of Indian heritage so my skin needs a lot of moisture. I am not one to spend hours on makeup and hair, but this is something that I look forward to using everyday. It is incredibly refreshing and makes me feel energized - the gel texture is so much better than creams. I can really see that my skin has improved -- it is more even, soft, and bright. I&#x27;ve gotten many compliments on my skin since using this too! This product is awesome and affordable! I truly recommend this to everyone!!!!!</li>
    <li> This was a ok moisturizer.  I have had better &amp; I have had worse.  I like the gel-cream part.  I seen no improvements nor any bad side effects, so I guess if you just want a reg moisturizer &amp; nothing more it will do the job.</li>
    <li> I bought this for the great reviews and the first time I thought it was refreshing to try compared to other facial products. Now that I tried it for a second time, it&#x27;s very drying (especially right after shower when I like to put my lotions on) and gets very tight on my skin. I don&#x27;t like the hassle of return. So I guess It will just go to garbage</li>
    <li> This is a very nice lightweight moisturizer and also smells nice. This does not leave me feeling uncomfortable or oily. I only use this at night because it does not contain SPF however, you can always apply this under a SPF product. I just wear a moisturizer with SPF included, alone in the morning.  I have oily to combination skin and I use the green on in the summer time and I use the pink one for dry skin in the winter time. Very good price for the amount that you get in the jar, it will last you through the season.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff, it keeps my face from getting super dried out in the winter months.  Excellent product. Will buy again.</li>
    <li> Great stuff should have purchased more!</li>
    <li> I love this stuff!  I use it all over my face, even on the eyelids, and down my neck every day.  Other moisturizers tend to make my eyes burn as they &amp;#34;melt&#x27; into the eye...but not this!  I signed up for Subscribe and Save on this item for an even better price.  Highly recommended by me.</li>
    <li> This moisturizer has been wonderful! I use it day and night as suggested and leaves my face feeling fresh and soft. It doesnt leave greasy spots and it dries fast (depends how much you put on). Just about a dime size amount works fine with my face (lasts longer too!). I&#x27;ve been using it for almost two weeks and im still very happy with this product!! :)</li>
    <li> Wonderful moisturizer! Non greasy and dries fast.</li>
    <li> I have always used a creamier moisturizer most of my life, until I came across Garnier gel cream, and I used to wait until I travelled to Europe, to buy it because it wasn&#x27;t available in the US. Now I can find it in the US and online, and I wouldn&#x27;t go back to my previous cream!</li>
    <li> I LOVE this moisturizer.  I have rosacea and my skin jumps back &amp; forth between flaky/dry and oily.  The only downside for me is that I go through these jars quick!  For about the same amount I think I buy the St. Ives collagen moisturizer and that stuff lasts forever.  The thing I love about this moisturizer is that it doesn&#x27;t feel greasy &amp; doesn&#x27;t anger my skin.  I think I&#x27;ve used 3-4 jars so far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t really feel like it is greatly hydrating me, which is good for the oily parts, but maybe I need a little more moisture for the dryer parts of my face - this is just a theory &amp; coming at the end of winter.  I just recently went to the mall &amp; tried a toner for the first time in a bajillion years.  I loved it - it felt refreshing &amp; not drying and I think that the moisturizing toner + this moisturizer is the fix that my face needs!  Either way, I will continue to use this product.</li>
    <li> This is my second time to use Garnier Moisture product. I like it . No oil, light scent. smells good</li>
    <li> My favourite moisturiser, ordered it the 2nd time</li>
    <li> I have extremely oily skin thats sensitive. Nice and refreshing this doesnt cause my skin to break out and my skin seems to be less oily when use it. Will be repurchasing!!!</li>
    <li> age: 57&lt;br /&gt;skin: slightly sensitive, combination&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This gel-cream is &amp;#34;refreshing&amp;#34; just as they claim. It&#x27;s a completely different feel from my usual more emollient creams, and I find I particularly like it for hot days, just out of the shower, for day-time use (though I have to put sunscreen over it, but there&#x27;s no problem to do that at all).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wouldn&#x27;t use this at night, when I want a more deeper moisturizing experience, and most probably I would not use it during winter months - though I don&#x27;t want to rule that out until I&#x27;ve tried it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent is fresh and disappears after a few moments. All in all a nice little gel-cream that leave my face feeling fresh/refreshed.</li>
    <li> I am an Asian with a slightly oily skin. I have so far used different moisturizers and creams respective to the seasons.. summers and in winters. But was never satisfied with any of them until today. A very little time after the application of these creams, my skin turns out greasy and oily.. specially in summers. I used to hate them. But can not avoid applying moisturizer since that would leave my skin dull and pale..! I found this Garnier moisture rescue gel-cream at Walgreens recently. Looking at &amp;#34;Oil-free&amp;#34; on the package, I thought I should give it a try. After all, I needed something like this.. a cream which is non oily(since I have a oily skin) and yet, moisturizes my skin. For the first time in my life, I really got that relief of having a smooth and soft skin. Best best best one for the oily skin types. Please go for it without a second thought! I strongly recommend this to all those who have oily skin. For dry skin types, this may not work as they need more oils and moisture.. this is just my opinion. I am just loving this product!</li>
    <li> I love this face lotion because it&#x27;s a cool-feeling gel as opposed to the typical cream. Goes on light and refreshing, and has a light scent that&#x27;s pleasant :) I don&#x27;t have oily skin, just a few spots that get a bit dry, so I apply this once or twice a day (morning and night) and am good to go! Their pink version for drier skin is heavier and I feel like it clogs my pores, so I much prefer this product.</li>
    <li> I usually have combo, sensitive, clear skin. However, this winter, I was getting dry patches and my sunscreen wasn&#x27;t enough(yes, I use sunscreen even in winter). So I needed an extra moisturizer, to put under my sunscreen. This is perfect!! First, the scent is so refreshing. I&#x27;ve used Garnier in the past but never anything like this. I&#x27;ve also never used a gel cream before. It goes on cool and quick absorbs allowing me to immediately put my sunscreen over it. I&#x27;ve been using it for two months and haven&#x27;t had any dry patches on my face, at all! Price was good for the size and I still have half of it left!!</li>
    <li> this product was great! my skin on my face gets really dry, this helped take it all away..my skin is smooth and hydrated! i would recommened this product to anyone.</li>
    <li> Not much of a moisturizer in my opinion, it does feel light when applied and makes your face feels like it breathing and not clogged up.  maybe in the summer it would be Ok, but definately not a winter moisturizer.</li>
    <li> It is definitely refreshing. I&#x27;m not sure about the moisture part, but it has a soothing, cooling feeling when you first put it on. give it a few minutes to settle in, my face feels pretty sticky for a while afterwards.</li>
    <li> Dries nicely and doesn&#x27;t dry out the skin.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m in mid 40s and have pretty good skin but I live in S Cal so the weather can be pretty dry here.&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t even finish using this and threw out the rest.  After using this on my face, it was still dry and felt like it was pulling.  I had to put on my trust Cetaphil so I can move my face again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe ok for teens and 20&#x27;s skin but even in your late 30s you should get more moisture.</li>
    <li> I read a blog saying this was a dupe for Clinique gel moisturizer; not even close.  This has no moisturizing effect at all;  once it dries, it is just gone.  I did find some use for it though.  I mixed it with a way-too-heavy moisturizer I had so two unusable products yielded a decent result.  Still going to be forking over the $$$ for Clinique gel.</li>
    <li> The box was obviously old, damaged, and dirty.  The product was not sealed in any way, apparently had been used, returned, and then shipped to us as new.  With no way of knowing how contaminated this product is, it is not something safe to use.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Clinique Dramatically Different Moisturizing Gel for a little while, then I bought some of this to try. They&#x27;re pretty similar, except I think this product is a little bit more moisturizing, not to mention much more budget-friendly. Like with most gel moisturizers, they&#x27;re not meant for dry skin. This product I think could be used for oily, combination, or normal skin, especially if you&#x27;re like me and lotions and creams on your face make you feel kind of gross. It doesn&#x27;t clog my pores or feel greasy, and it moisturizes all day.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s only 1.7 oz, but it lasts a long time. You only need about a dime size amount for your whole face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A few things to be aware of before you try it though:&lt;br /&gt;The packaging. I prefer products with pumps because they&#x27;re more hygienic. This isn&#x27;t that bad though. Just make sure your hands are clean before you dip your fingers into it and you&#x27;ll be fine.&lt;br /&gt;The scent is fairly potent, but it doesn&#x27;t linger or make you gag or anything. It smells a bit like cucumber perfume and it does have some denatured alcohol and parfum in it.&lt;br /&gt;It also doesn&#x27;t have any SPF, so if you wear it during the day, you&#x27;ll probably want to wear a foundation with SPF or a separate sun protection product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I think it&#x27;s great, though, especially for the low price.</li>
    <li> I normally have adult acne/combination skin and had been using the Clinique moisture surge gel and it was amazing!!!!! However, when I started to run low I purchased this product and let me tell you it FAILS to moisturizer after about 10min! I&#x27;m so disappointed! Time to go back to the department store to stock up on Clinique moisture surge (it&#x27;s in a pink container)</li>
    <li> I started this gel last week. It makes my face sting every time I use it. Is it supposed to do that? Anyone else had this reaction???</li>
    <li> My skin tends to be very oily on the T-Zone and then extremely dry on my cheeks. This moisturizer is light yet moisturizing. I really like it. It&#x27;s not oily so if you have oily skin or combo like me, definitely give this moisturizer a try!</li>
    <li> A little bit goes a long way on this.  Nice summer moisturizer, light, doesn&#x27;t clog up my pores, feels very refreshing and you do not need a lot of it.  Will definitely get another jar for the rest of the summer.</li>
    <li> Nice and light, especially for skin prone to breakouts.  Not quite hydrating enough for me, but I put a small pea-sized amount first, and then a bit of sunscreen, and I&#x27;m good.</li>
    <li> I liked that there are natural ingredients in this Moisture gel.  It&#x27;s a little different to use a gel instead of a cream, &amp; I&#x27;m having to get use to it, however it certainly is cooling in our hot, humid summers, &amp; so far I&#x27;m happy with it.</li>
    <li> Tried applying it at night after washing my face. It felt very greasy and had a VERY strong fragrance.  A couple minutes after applying it my skin started to burn a bit and the scent was too overpowering for me. Felt like it might cause a break out so I ended up washing it off and used my normal moisturizer.  The price was low and I love Garnier face wash but this product was just not for me.</li>
    <li> Very cooling gel, goes on smooth, feels great:) Fast shipping, good pricing, will buy from seller again!</li>
    <li> After finding out that you sent a &#x27;care package&#x27; to the women off the Israeli army so they could &#x27;pamper themselves&#x27; in times of war, I and my family will never buy your products again - you support genocide, the murder of innocent children and glorify war!  No amount of your product could ever cleanse/refresh or make anyone ever look good again.</li>
    <li> good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good</li>
    <li> The fragrance is much heavier than expected, and makes my eyes burn.  I guess I need to hold out for fragrance-free next time.  Otherwise, the texture and moisture is very nice, the price is right, and I really wish they had a fragrance-free version.</li>
    <li> pretty refeshing&lt;br /&gt;not hydraing for oily skin</li>
    <li> Very light and refreshing.</li>
    <li> After reading many good reviews from many sites, I opted to try this moisture out even though I already have a decent Clean &amp; Clear Moisturizer.  This Garnier Moisturizer is just a dollar or so more expensive than the other one.  Unfortunately, this product did not work for me.  I have naturally super oily skin, and it made my face worse, more oil than my natural oil.  I hated it and wanted to return right away, but I finished the whole product to avoid the hassle.  The amount compared to the other is less as well.  It only last me about 2.5 months.  I do not recommend for oily skin.  I only use it night time because it makes my face looks really oily and cakey.</li>
    <li> I have very oily skin that is also dry (you know the type, shiny but sometimes flaky!) and the last thing I need during the day is a moisturizer that is going to leave a shiny film.  After my morning Korean skin care steps, I apply this, and then cc cream and makeup.  The gel goes on and feels cool and refreshing, then immediately sinks in.  No stickiness, but none of that fresh-washed dryness, either.  My skin, during the day, doesn&#x27;t seem as shiny, and I have noticed increased elasticity.  This is a keeper for me.</li>
    <li> Do not like.  Would not buy again.  Unpleasant smell.</li>
    <li> I use it daily and it keeps my skin hydrated. It is a fantastic, simple product and I will continue to buy it. :) If I were to improve one thing, it would be to add SPF protection.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not giving this five stars because there&#x27;s a few products that I ADORE and I don&#x27;t think I adore this one. That said, I&#x27;m already on my second jar and I&#x27;m satisfied with it. It&#x27;s very light (it&#x27;s gel) and I think I had some issues at first when I was using it with breaking out a bit (I have very sensitive skin but no history of acne -- however, my face just doesn&#x27;t like a lot of change) but that went away and now I never break out from it. I think I prefer it over cream moisturizers. That said, I still feel like I&#x27;m on the hunt for the PERFECT moisturizer, but this is a pretty good one for daily use.</li>
    <li> I would recommend this product to anyone who has the least bit oily skin. I have found my complexion to have improved immensley since using this product. Very few if any blemishes and nice and smooth.</li>
    <li> I enjoy using this mostly because I love the scent!  My face feels and looks fresh when I use it.  I plan to purchase again!</li>
    <li> I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of this.  My daughter borrowed my Clinque moisture surge, and I just order this on a lighting deal, and feel it is very similar to the much more expensive product.  Probably not deep moisturizing, but feels nice going on, and relieves facial dryness.</li>
    <li> Really light and refreshing. I use it,day and night as I rarely go outdoor. It is refreshing  and my skin  longs for it&lt;br /&gt;.</li>
    <li> I love this moisturizer. The consistency is a light gel that smooths onto the skin. It soaks in quickly and smells very nice. It has kept my skin from peeling all winter, but I am sure it is light enough that it wouldn&#x27;t feel heavy in the summer. My skin is prone to breaking out, and this has not caused any problems at all.</li>
    <li> I am 35, dry,sensitive, light-freckled skinned girl. I used this product for the first time after exfoliating with Neutrogena&#x27;s Wave. It soaked in immediately. It left the skin soft. However, after it soaked in and approx. 12hrs I could feel a residue on the skin. It did not moisturize well, it didn&#x27;t seem to moisturize at all. My husband also used the Wave and Garnier cream. He has oily, acne prone skin. It soaked into his face and he said that he could not feel it. Which, is a big plus for him.&lt;br /&gt;Alone, this is not a great cream. I could use olive or coconut oil and get more moisture. However, if you use a different moisturizer or sunscreen, let it dry and use the Garnier over the top it might work to keep the moisture of the another product in your skin.... For the dry summer months.&lt;br /&gt;On the upside it didn&#x27;t sting, redden or make me break out. This one will be going to my husband. If he doesn&#x27;t want it, it&#x27;s going to the recycling bin.</li>
    <li> The texture is very nice and it did not irritates my skin like the Bodyshop ones do. I use it everyday and it is pretty good.</li>
    <li> Light &amp; refreshing unlike othergels I have tried&#x3D;doesn&#x27;t feel sticky after application.  Good product for the price. I&#x27;ve never seen product in ANY store.</li>
    <li> love it it really does leave an already clean refreshed face even more so. loved it</li>
    <li> It is good for cheap price. Apply it on your face when it is cold.</li>
    <li> Best moisturizer, even my dermatologist agrees!</li>
    <li> About 3 months ago I upped my skincare routine and bought this moisturizer as part of the product makeover. I had not been using any moisturizer previously. My skin tends to be oily, and my skincare routine started very gentle (just lotion cleanser and toner), so the lighter formula was just what I needed.&lt;br /&gt;When I saw no improvement in my acne, I began to use more intense products, and this moisturizer could not keep up with my skin. It still felt refreshing to apply, like my skin was getting a big drink of water. But after the moisturizer dried, my skin would still feel tight and dry. I tried for a while adding a second application of the moisturizer but it just left a tacky film on my face.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, the product was light and refreshing for when I needed very little moisturizer. However, when my true moisurizing needs arose, this product just didn&#x27;t make the cut. I am going back to a less drying cleanser, but I am also replacing the Garnier moisturizer with a more hydrating formula.</li>
    <li> I have oily skin and this gel-cream moisturizes without making my skin more oily.  I also tend to have very sensitive skin, and this does the trick.  No breakouts and no itchiness or dryness.  You only need a tiny amount to cover your entire face.  I will definitely be buying this again.</li>
    <li> This product is fantastic! Living in Denver, dry skin is a huge problem. This product keeps my skin hydrated all day and helps prevent cracks and breaks. I&#x27;ve used other high end products that cost as much as three times the price and am still more satisfied with Garnier Moisture Rescue. Save your money and buy this instead!</li>
    <li> I have sensitive skin, so many things cause rashes or break outs. this is a light moisterizer that feels great and is not greasy as so many other lotions/moisterizers are.</li>
    <li> Very good product, very comfortable refreshing, highly recommended!</li>
    <li> For me this is just about the perfect moisturizer. The gel formula is amazing!! I live in the hot, sunny, sweaty desert and this moisturizes my skin without making it greasy or shiny. It is perfect for the summer months. The gel absorbs quickly into my skin and leaves it feeling super soft without feeling like an oil slick. Also I have not broken out while using this moisturizer at all. If you have combination or oily skin this is pretty much the perfect product for you. I cannot say enough about how great it is. The best part is costs peanuts compared to all the high end products that do not even work as well. Give this a try...you will love it!!</li>
    <li> This is THE most hydrating moisturizer that has ever touched my skin.  I have sensitive skin, and this does not irritate my skin.  Scent is refreshing and mild.  I purchase this product over and over.  Just wish it came in a pump!</li>
    <li> I have struggled to find d a great face moisturizer that doesn&#x27;t make my skin oily. This product gives a sheer feeling and leaves my skin soft and not oily feeling. Great product!</li>
    <li> Hoestly with all the positive reviews I thought I should say a few things about this. Yes I do use this product but is it really that great? No. In the summer I have very oily skin (mostly in the tzone) If I were to use a heavier moisturizer my makeup would seperate during the day. This is light enough so I can use this during the hotter months and not have to worry about my face turning into an oil slick.  This stuff has a strong scent which just feels wrong. I normally shy away from skincare products with perfumes in them because that usually means there is some form of alcohol and unnecessary chemicals. So yes this is a decent super light moisturizer but if you have dry or severly dry skin this will not benefit you in the least. I do love the way this applies and I like how my skin immidiately soaks this up. It doesnt feel heavy like skin creams that stick with you. I can put this stuff on and immidiately apply my makeup primer and start putting on my makeup.</li>
    <li> The box came opened the jar had clearly been opened and half of the contents are missing</li>
    <li> Works good! Smells natural and fresh.</li>
    <li> Skin broket out. Useless product !</li>
    <li> I like the lightness of the gel. Doesn&#x27;t feel heavy or sticky. I will probably be buying this again when I need it</li>
    <li> I love this stuff -- lightweight, soaks in quickly and doesn&#x27;t make me break out. I also love putting it in the refrigerator when I come in from out of the sun!</li>
    <li> I got this on sale for $5.79 not expecting much, and boy was I surprised. I have sensitive oily skin, so finding a good, reasonably priced night moisturizer that doesn&#x27;t cause breakouts feels like an impossible task. This one feels light going on and doesn&#x27;t turn my face into an oil slick overnight. I tend to avoid gel-based anything I put on my face, but this doesn&#x27;t feel sticky or greasy once I massage it in. Also, I kind of like the medicinal fruity smell.</li>
    <li> I layer this between my skin serum and my cc cream.</li>
    <li> i use this stuff whenever i get out of the shower and my skin is dry. it works really well. super hydrating and refreshing. not sticky or heavy at all.</li>
    <li> As a note, I did not pay for this - my bf bought it for himself(but didn&#x27;t like it) and I would describe myself as having normal/dry skin, not combination. That being said, I think it works ok. I would not buy it for myself, but I found it to be adequately moisturizing, especially if there is a lot of humidity. It&#x27;s generally between 25%-60% humidity here, so on the more humid days, this works just fine. On the less humid ones, it&#x27;s not really moisturizing enough for my drier skin. I was only using it at night, after cleansing. I like that it has no smell though- garnier products often are full of irritating fragrances.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing to note though, if you have sensitive skin- I used this after exfoliating a few times and it burned like crazy. I&#x27;m never doing that again.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff as a moisturizer. It feels so light on my skin and doesn&#x27;t clog my pores at all. I have oily skin so I especially love this for summer because it&#x27;s a gel so it feels much lighter, it absorbs faster than a lotion, and it smells great.</li>
    <li> My skin is very sensitive and breaks out when its looked at wrong. I was looking for a light cream for everyday to help keep my skin healthy. This cream feels good going on but didn&#x27;t react well with my skin. It felt tacky and sticky, not refreshing. I noticed the next days my skin started looking red and irritated. I&#x27;m disappointed and gone back to pure coconut oil.</li>
    <li> This works pretty well, and the fragrance is nice. Don&#x27;t use it right after exfoliating, though. It kind of burns.</li>
    <li> I had really high hopes for this product, as I&#x27;ve had good luck with everything else that Garnier has put out...    This gel moisturizer made my combination skin VERY VERY VERY angry. For nearly 4 months I had nonstop, painful, cystic breakouts while using this product. My zits even had zits. Ugh! The only good thing about this product was the scent. Never again!!</li>
    <li> Very pleasant smelling and makes skin feel refreshed and soft leaves no ashy dry feel but a smooth finish.I love how this product makes my face looks as if it had a professional facial for the fraction of the cost but same great result.Will continue to buy this item in the future and I do have sensitive skin so this is actually a plus for me  .Notice dramatical  difference on first use of this product.  from a very happy camper. Go Ganier</li>
    <li> I originally purchased this to tie me over while my Biotherm Aquapower was shipped to me. However, I prefer the scent of this and it has been just as moisturizing. Add to it the price point of this gel-cream, and I have switched over to this product completely. I buy 3-4 jars at a time and don&#x27;t mind lathering it on as it&#x27;s only $6-7 for an entire jar versus the $30+ I paid for the Biotherm.</li>
    <li> Ever since moving to the US and having to find new beauty products, I was struggling to find a moisturizer which did not lead to my eyes burning terribly after a few hours. Even the ones with no fragrances, no preservative and advertised to be completely hypoallergenic still irritated my eyes. Of course I never even let the product get close to the eye region, however, the irritation still ocurred. Until I found this miracle gel! Not only do my eyes not burn, I can even use it close to and around the eyes, and they actually seem to perk up! I have been using it now for about three weeks and it has changed my life. Dear Garnier people: Please never change or discontinue this product! And did I mention, it also leaves my skin nicely moisturized, refreshed and clear, and is perfect for day as well as night time use as it does not leave any residue on the pillows.</li>
    <li> This cream does what it says. I use it after toners. It moistures your face, makes your face soft, but it is not sticky at all. Good for every season.</li>
    <li> Okay, so. I have bought this product three times now (once in the drugstore, twice on Amazon). I have to say, I love this product. I have oily skin, and this is the only moisturizer that I have used that makes my skin feel hydrated but not oily. The only real disclaimer I have to say is that I noticed when I buy the product on Amazon, it has a different weird smell to it compared to when I buy it at the drugstore...</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s OK. But I still feel a little dry after using it. Plus I don&#x27;t like alcohol denat. in it.</li>
    <li> I am prone to milia so I am always looking for anything gel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the way this feels light and not greasy yet not drying either. It seems to help calm my skin from sensitivity also.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is also cheaper than Ole Henriksen Invigorating Night Gel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am nervous though! I saw it on close out at a store recently. NO! Please don&#x27;t discontinue this!</li>
    <li> My skin became very sensitive and prone to break outs during my pregnancy.  I had to go back to oil-free makeup and moisturizers and had some really frustrating experiences with oil-free products just not doing the job and drying out my skin.  I was so relieved when I stumbled upon this product! It is so light but it really does the job.  I use it during the day under my makeup and at night before I go to bed.  It really does feel refreshing, to steal from the label.  There can be a sticky feeling if you use too much so you have to learn how much you really need for your skin. I don&#x27;t have to use much at all and the jar has lasted me a long time. It can also give a slight wet feeling (for lack of a better term) when you first apply it but it sets in very quickly and that feeling goes away.  I have had much less issues with dry skin since I started using this and it has not irritated my skin at all.</li>
    <li> This is excellent for day time and summer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;moisturising - gentle - smells nice and a great price. I cant find this instores sadly but very glad amazon sells it for such a reasonable price.</li>
    <li> I bought this gel to hope that it would restore the natural oils in my face. Every time I take a shower, my face peels badly everywhere. Chin, cheeks, nose, eyebrows, forehead, and it looks gross having flakes in my beard. I want to love this product as it leaves my skin feeling better, but still does not rid the dead skin, and really does not leave my face feeling less tight and moist. Have been using this for over 4 months now, usually put it on after a shower and before bed. I use NOTHING else on my face besides a very low pressure scrub with cool water and a soft washcloth to try and rid my face of the dry skin. I feel like I need to put something on before this gel, like a lotion or something and let the gel kind of &amp;#34;seal&amp;#34; it in there. But, I really don&#x27;t want clogged pores. Ugh, getting old sucks. So does cold weather, and hard water.</li>
