      <li>The bristle softness from this toothbrush is so much better</li>
      <li>I received this product free in exchange for my honest review.</li>
      <li>and I wasn&#x27;t really sure about them,</li>
      <li>Love the design of the bristles and the comfort during brushing.</li>
      <li>I love my electric toothbrush</li>
      <li>My best guess is that each one of their bristles feel the same as a tuft of the skinny nylon bristles.</li>
      <li>I love that there is two in there</li>
      <li>I feel that they provide a more thorough cleaning.</li>
      <li>Now, I understand the concept of this brush and love the idea of it.</li>
      <li>but then I tried it and fell in love.</li>
      <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure if I would like it or not.</li>
      <li>Softest toothbrush ever, brush longer and better because it doesn&#x27;t hurt my gums.</li>
      <li>after two weeks, this is my favorite toothbrush I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
      <li>This O&#x27;Nano toothbrush elimates that problem and has a much better brushing feel with its innovative bristles.</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t know what to expect but am greatly pleased.  </li>
      <li>The bristles are more like bendy plastic than nylon.  </li>
      <li>The brush does seem to remove more plaque as well, leaves my teeth feeling clean!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a nice pair of tooth brushes and is shipped quickly.</li>
      <li>Its a great feel against my sensitive teeth and gums.</li>
      <li>It is easy to use and feels like it helps reach every place in my mouth.</li>
      <li>Well-shaped and length of handle makes it easy to reach the wisdom teeth area.</li>
      <li>Fabulous tooth brushes.</li>
      <li>It is such a great toothbrush.</li>
      <li>I recommend these to people who enjoy the feel of soft bristles but work good at cleaning your mouth.</li>
      <li>So far, I feel that this toothbrush has delivered my preference which is a bit surprising since it didn&#x27;t appear to have a lot of bristles.</li>
      <li>Have been used it for a week, it&#x27;s soft but good to use.</li>
      <li>It was actually perfect timing as I was about 2 weeks past changing toothbrushes.</li>
      <li>The silicone bristles has more of a give so bends instead of splaying out when you apply greater force, it also pushes itself back out with more spring as you release the pressure.</li>
      <li>If it lasts lasts longer/retains the shape longer than three months, I would say that this product is a better value than my Colgate 360 since the price is pretty comparable.</li>
      <li>The first time we used them, it was a strange sensation, but a very good one.  </li>
      <li>However, my greatest concern was that the head of the toothbrush is removable and could possibly pose a choking hazard to a young child.</li>
      <li>, my teeth are just as clean with this brush.</li>
      <li>I guess it&#x27;s a good indicator of when the toss it out but looks gross.</li>
      <li>Very unique feel, and we really like it.  </li>
      <li>With the valentine&#x27;s coupon the pair is also super cost efficient.</li>
      <li>I won&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s actually the best until I see my dentist in a few months :)</li>
      <li>Very strange feeling in my mouth and was concerned about them not being good for my gums.</li>
      <li>This tooth brush is so gentle that make my gum comfortable.</li>
      <li>Definitely a nice alternative to traditional toothbrushes</li>
      <li>They are just the right amount of firmness to get the job done and not have a sore mouth.</li>
      <li>Well designed and just the right firmness.</li>
      <li>Soft and easy on my teeth and gums.</li>
      <li>Edit: Now that I&#x27;ve had the toothbrushes for about a week, I&#x27;ve been able to recognize a few more things.</li>
      <li>It feels very soft and comfortable.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a very gentle, pleasing brushing experience.  </li>
      <li>would VERY MUCH like to see another size head, for children.</li>
      <li>It gave me the impression that its not as hard on my tooth so does not give it as good of a clean, however, when I examine my teeth afterwards</li>
      <li>I love the cris cross design of the bristles</li>
      <li>if this impression is totally in my head, like, when I see suds in the washing machine, I think it cleans better</li>
      <li>It feels so soft and comfortable when I brush my teeth.</li>
      <li>Love the crisscross design as it encourages brushing in a circular motion, the currently recommended &amp;#34;proper&amp;#34; technique.</li>
      <li>Soft bristles massage gums and clean teeth.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s great, it is neither too hard nor too soft.</li>
      <li>They feel really nice on my gums and the brush is able to get to the hard to reach spots in the back without hurting my jaw.</li>
      <li>It cleans very well.  </li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t enjoy the rubbery texture of the bristles or how they start to turn yellow after a couple months of use.</li>
      <li>O&#x27;nano brushes really well.</li>
      <li>Getting two in a pack is a real bargain too.</li>
      <li>Thanks  </li>
      <li>So I need a gentle toothbrush.</li>
      <li>no matter how much force I put when I brush</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s gentle on the gum.</li>
      <li>If another head becomes available, we will definitely be buying again!</li>
      <li>The first time i used this toothbrush i was surprised by the texture.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t feel exactly like my old bristled 360 any longer.</li>
      <li>My husband and i love these toothbrushes so much, i don&#x27;t think i can go back to regular old bristles!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I got these toothbrushes a couple months ago and saved them to bring to the hospital when I gave birth to my daughter. I love that there is two in there so it was perfect for my boyfriend and I. When I first took my toothbrush out of the paid, I noticed it looked a little different that my current toothbrush. The bristles were different and so was teh overall shape. I wasn&#x27;t sure if I would like it or not. While the bristles are a little soft for me (because these are soft bristles of course and I usually use medium), I really like it. It is easy to use and feels like it helps reach every place in my mouth. I received this product at a reduced rate in exchange for my honest review. All opinions are my own.</li>
    <li> after two weeks, this is my favorite toothbrush I&#x27;ve ever used. I won&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s actually the best until I see my dentist in a few months :)</li>
    <li> different but I think we are going to like these.</li>
    <li> I received this product free in exchange for my honest review.I must I am extremely happy with the O&#x27;nano toothbrushes.The thing is my husband had to have all his teeth removed due to certain health reasons and has never found a tooth brush with bristles soft enough to brush his gums and it not hurt.Well I got these,because I like soft bristles as well..Low and behold these do not hurt at all.They are just the right amount of firmness to get the job done and not have a sore mouth.I am very pleased.He got the green one and I got the pink.The colors are nice,and so is the design.I recommend these to people who enjoy the feel of soft bristles but work good at cleaning your mouth.</li>
    <li> I like this toothbrush! It feels very soft and comfortable. I have very sensitive gum. I will buy again.</li>
    <li> Very good toothbrush! It feels so soft and comfortable when I brush my teeth. You will never regret buying it.</li>
    <li> Love the crisscross design as it encourages brushing in a circular motion, the currently recommended &amp;#34;proper&amp;#34; technique.Well-shaped and length of handle makes it easy to reach the wisdom teeth area. And, much to my surprise, no longer have any bleeding gums which apparently had been caused by too hard/scratchy a toothbrush (even if provided by a dentist).  Getting two in a pack is a real bargain too.</li>
    <li> Looks good! In high quality. I don&#x27;t like to use electronic brush. I used to have serious tooth problem, it will blood when brushing. So I need a gentle toothbrush. I don&#x27;t like to use electronic brush. This brush works good for me.</li>
    <li> The bristles are more like bendy plastic than nylon.  Very strange feeling in my mouth and was concerned about them not being good for my gums. Was looking for very soft bristles. These did not fit the bill.</li>
    <li> I use electric toothbrush with sensitive brush head. Friends suggest me this toothbrush to try since it works so well on sensitive teeth. I love my electric toothbrush but sometimes I can forget about not brushing too hard and make my gum sensitive every once in a while. I have been using this tooth brush for a week now, the bristles are so soft and they cover teeth gently. It is such a great toothbrush. I use it when my gum start feeling sensitive and hurt while I use electric one. It makes brushing teeth a joy, a nice chore. The pack comes with 2 toothbrushes. It is a great buy! great product! I got this product at a discount in exchange for my honest review. The above is my unbiased review for this product.</li>
    <li> This felt a lot different compared to a normal toothbrush.  It cleans very well.  I would be great for travel.  However, my greatest concern was that the head of the toothbrush is removable and could possibly pose a choking hazard to a young child.</li>
    <li> Have been used it for a week, it&#x27;s soft but good to use.</li>
    <li> Great space-age toothbrush! I found this when searching for &amp;#34;anti-bacterial&amp;#34; toothbrushes when it occurred to me that the embedded bristles in a traditional toothbrush would harbor bacteria. This O&#x27;Nano toothbrush elimates that problem and has a much better brushing feel with its innovative bristles.</li>
    <li> Been using these for a while and I think I&#x27;ll be buying more! Well designed and just the right firmness.</li>
    <li> The bristles are to soft for me</li>
    <li> I was skeptical at first but these have grown on me. The plastic bristles are in unison with the tooth brush so you do not have to worry about bacteria growing at the base of the bristles. I love the cris cross design of the bristles I feel that they provide a more thorough cleaning. The tongue scrapper on the back is also another plus. I do feel these were actually a little harder than a regular soft bristle tooth brush though. I received this product at a discounted price for my honest review.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s great, it is neither too hard nor too soft. For me, it is a little bit wide, just a little bit.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t enjoy the rubbery texture of the bristles or how they start to turn yellow after a couple months of use. I guess it&#x27;s a good indicator of when the toss it out but looks gross.</li>
    <li> Very comfortable tooth brush. Bristles are a nice plastic which is a pleasant change for me</li>
    <li> Did not like feel of the plastic urethane bristles and the size of the brush head is too big.</li>
    <li> This brush felt really nice on my teeth and gums; almost like a massaging effect. I tend to brush my teeth fairly hard and this brush didn&#x27;t feel painful or harsh in the slightest. Definitely a nice alternative to traditional toothbrushes</li>
    <li> The first time i used this toothbrush i was surprised by the texture. It&#x27;s not &amp;#34;bristly&amp;#34; like most toothbrushes are. It has flexible plastic (or rubber?) bristles that, after the initial weird feeling, feel pretty great. They feel really nice on my gums and the brush is able to get to the hard to reach spots in the back without hurting my jaw. My husband and i love these toothbrushes so much, i don&#x27;t think i can go back to regular old bristles!</li>
    <li> Like these toothbrushes.</li>
    <li> Very comfortable when I brush. My gums don&#x27;t bleed anymore no matter how much force I put when I brush</li>
    <li> Extremely good and comfortable</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had 2 root canals on my #9 tooth, including a dozen other teeth problems. Dental hygiene is really important to me, so I&#x27;m happy that I now have the O&#x27;Nano toothbrush in the rotation. Its a great feel against my sensitive teeth and gums.</li>
    <li> My friend bought this great Toothbrush and gave me two. My tooth is very sensitive and always bleeding while tooth cleaning. This tooth brush is so gentle that make my gum comfortable. The bristles is relatively thin than usual.</li>
    <li> Superior oral care with a better brush. Soft bristles massage gums and clean teeth. Would purchase again</li>
    <li> Edit: Now that I&#x27;ve had the toothbrushes for about a week, I&#x27;ve been able to recognize a few more things. It doesn&#x27;t feel exactly like my old bristled 360 any longer. The silicone bristles has more of a give so bends instead of splaying out when you apply greater force, it also pushes itself back out with more spring as you release the pressure. It gave me the impression that its not as hard on my tooth so does not give it as good of a clean, however, when I examine my teeth afterwards, my teeth are just as clean with this brush. Now, I understand the concept of this brush and love the idea of it. I&#x27;m not sure if this impression is totally in my head, like, when I see suds in the washing machine, I think it cleans better (total myth btw, read about that in consumer reports), or if its got some merit but I haven&#x27;t had any evidence in my teeth of it not cleaning as well. I&#x27;ll give it another month and update you guys.   I got this toothbrush for a discounted price in return for my honest review. It was actually perfect timing as I was about 2 weeks past changing toothbrushes. When I first got the toothbrush, I actually found the toothbrush very different and a bit weird looking. I brushed it against my finger to try the feel and it appears to feel almost the same as my Colgate 360, albeit a bit smaller. I&#x27;m a bit picky about my toothbrush. I don&#x27;t like it too bulky since I have a small mouth but I like a thick patch of bristles because I feel cleaner after brushing. So far, I feel that this toothbrush has delivered my preference which is a bit surprising since it didn&#x27;t appear to have a lot of bristles. My best guess is that each one of their bristles feel the same as a tuft of the skinny nylon bristles. It feels the same in my mouth as my normal Colgate 360 but since the bristles are not bunched loosely together and are of a silicone like material, I can imagine that it will likely have less buildup and trap  less debris, thus be cleaner in the long run.  I will update this in a few months to see if it has the same or better longevity as my normal toothbrush. But so far, it looks like O&#x27;Nano has got a new customer. If it lasts lasts longer/retains the shape longer than three months, I would say that this product is a better value than my Colgate 360 since the price is pretty comparable.</li>
    <li> The best toothbrush in the market. It cleans deep inside with soft and gentle bristles, others toothbrush keep germs inside, in a week my mouth feels fresher and no bad breath. I recomend this product. 5+</li>
    <li> Fabulous tooth brushes.</li>
    <li> Very unique feel, and we really like it.  The first time we used them, it was a strange sensation, but a very good one.  They rinse extremely easily, and feel great on our gums and teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would VERY MUCH like to see another size head, for children. One of the areas where these brushes would work well is with braces (as stated in the ad).  But these brush heads are way too big for a young mouth (who usually have braces).  I have to help my son to reach all of the areas he needs too because the head is too big for him to maneuver effectively.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please made another brush size for kids around 8-13.  Thanks  If another head becomes available, we will definitely be buying again!</li>
    <li> The bristle softness from this toothbrush is so much better then what I’ve found from other leading brands that I’ve tried.  I have a lot of recession caused by heavy brushing and using this extra soft toothbrush has been a lifesaver on my gums.  Changing my brushing habits has made it better and using this toothbrush has not caused any more recession.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a nice pair of tooth brushes and is shipped quickly. With the valentine&#x27;s coupon the pair is also super cost efficient. Definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> I work for a dental office. And this is the best toothbrush I&#x27;ve seen. It&#x27;s good in quality. O&#x27;nano brushes really well. It&#x27;s not too soft and not too hard. It feels firm. It&#x27;s gentle on the gum. I would recommend this toothbrush to dental offices. I m going to order boxes of toothbrushes to pass out to the patients.</li>
    <li> Softest toothbrush ever, brush longer and better because it doesn&#x27;t hurt my gums.</li>
    <li> I Have very sensitive teeth this toothbrush is great for pain free brushing</li>
    <li> Great product, I like it.</li>
    <li> I was very skeptical about this purchase but I needed new toothbrushes so I took a chance and I couldn&#x27;t be happier! Love the design of the bristles and the comfort during brushing. The brush does seem to remove more plaque as well, leaves my teeth feeling clean!</li>
    <li> This is really a different brushing experience.  I didn&#x27;t know what to expect but am greatly pleased.  I have sensitive gums and what I like about this toothbrush the best is it is so gentle on your gums, it feels like a massage, but it thoroughly cleans your teeth and they feel very clean. It&#x27;s a very gentle, pleasing brushing experience.  I will keep ordering them from now on.</li>
    <li> I received these as a promotion and I wasn&#x27;t really sure about them, but then I tried it and fell in love. So different from any tooth brush I have used before. Soft and easy on my teeth and gums.</li>
    <li> I have terribly sensitive gums, and these work wonders!</li>
