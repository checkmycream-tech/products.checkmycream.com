      <li>It&#x27;s nice to be able to order it online instead of trying to find it in the stores</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t figure out why the cosmetic manufacturers stopped making this beautiful lipstick in this particular color.  </li>
      <li>I love, love, love the colorstay liquid lipsticks.  </li>
      <li>I got my favorite lipstick again</li>
      <li>I love this product.  </li>
      <li>This is my favorite color and has been discontinued.</li>
      <li>I was so pleased to be able to stock</li>
      <li>and it is still on and lovely.  </li>
      <li>I love this color and cannot find it in any of the stores any longer.</li>
      <li>i love this line, and sadly, many of my favorite colors were discontinued.</li>

      <li>This is my favorite brand of lipstick for all day wear.</li>
      <li>I love this color......</li>
      <li>Love this color.  </li>
      <li>Glad I can get this color still on Amazon</li>
      <li>Good color with absolute staying power, can be worn alone, or with a paler gloss over the top.</li>
      <li>I love the lip color it stays true</li>
      <li>Very happy with product all round.</li>
      <li>Color stays on pretty much the whole day, great color.  </li>
      <li>The color (Maximum Mocha) is true - a pumpkin orange.</li>
      <li>it took quite a while to receive these, but it is worth the wait.</li>
      <li>probably because it lasts so long they were losing money on the sale of more tubes!</li>
      <li>Happy I could find on line, purchased several  from different merchandisers.</li>
      <li>would like to subscribe very much for your dear to me</li>
      <li>Evidently my Revlon couldn&#x27;t help themselves and had to change colors and packaging.  </li>
      <li>Love this lipstick, the only one that stays on until you take it off.  </li>
      <li>pretty......</li>
      <li>i now have reason to believe they whole line might have been.</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t found this color any where, thanks to Amazon</li>
      <li>I tell you that my shipment in the very beauty and magnificence</li>
      <li>Thankfully, I get to hold out a little longer by ordering through Amazon and stocking up on my favorite Maximum Mocha...</li>
      <li>It stays on for a very long time, but after eating, I do have to apply more lipstick to my lips, especially if I eat anything made with oil.  </li>
      <li>the new # 080 ain&#x27;t</li>
      <li>I highly recommend it for the busy lady who doesn&#x27;t have time for all day make-up touch-ups.</li>
      <li>This is a pretty color but not really what I wanted.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve even started using them as sort of a lip liner and then placing a complimentary second lip color (any brand of lipstick or gloss works for me) on the rest of my lips to create a slight ombre effect.  </li>
      <li>sometimes I put little shimmer on top but usually it&#x27;s just it.....</li>

<li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a long time, but recently couldn&#x27;t find my color in the store</li>
<li> It does not dry lips like some of the stay on colors by other companies.  </li>
<li> No longer available in Walgreens and CVS, infract unable to find in our stores.  </li>
<li> i put this on in the morning and it stays ALL DAY LONG  </li>
<li> &lt;br /&gt;tube lasts a long time&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
<li> I used to purchase at  the local  walmart and other stores.</li>
<li> Color is long-lasting, but dry.</li>
<li> It stays on all day unless you eat something with a lot of oil in it, and it doesn&#x27;t feel dry.</li>
<li> Someone has a loose screw in their head at Revlon.</li>
<li> other than that</li>
<li> It gives my lips the look of a slight pout, and prevents the secondary, inner color from bleeding.  </li>
<li> This product is sometimes a little drying, but I&#x27;ve learned to combat that problem.  </li>
<li> only disappointment was i ordered three and only got two.</li>
<li> but it is my EVERYDAY lip color.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve read complaints about this products uneven cover</li>
<li> I usually apply lip gloss over it.  </li>
<li> this color is so hard to find.  </li>
<li> This has become hard to find.</li>
<li> unfortunately this color is going out of production.....</li>
<li> so disappointed you can no longer find this color in the store.&lt;br /&gt;exact color for my style.</li>
<li> I just hate that revlon no longer makes this color! :(</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Good color with absolute staying power, can be worn alone, or with a paler gloss over the top. Product arrived in perfect condition. Very happy with product all round.</li>
    <li> Just what was needed.  This color is not made anymore.</li>
    <li> i love this line, and sadly, many of my favorite colors were discontinued. i now have reason to believe they whole line might have been. probably because it lasts so long they were losing money on the sale of more tubes!</li>
    <li> Found this color.  Love this color.  Orangy red.  Now I cant find it in my area.  Amazon is here to save the day!  Thx</li>
    <li> I love, love, love the colorstay liquid lipsticks.  They always stay just were I put them for hours!  This product is sometimes a little drying, but I&#x27;ve learned to combat that problem.  I&#x27;ve even started using them as sort of a lip liner and then placing a complimentary second lip color (any brand of lipstick or gloss works for me) on the rest of my lips to create a slight ombre effect.  This blending technique works great for me.  It gives my lips the look of a slight pout, and prevents the secondary, inner color from bleeding.  This is my go-to product for staying power.</li>
    <li> I chose this rating because I love this color &amp; cannot find it anywhere anymore. Revlon needs to bring it back! I was so happy to find 6 of the tubes so I took all of them And I am Kenneth M&#x27;s. wife---he is not wearing the Maximum Mocha!</li>
    <li> This is a pretty color but not really what I wanted.  I do wear it when dressing up. It would probably be nicer on a younger individual.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve read complaints about this products uneven cover but I always outline my lips and with just a dab of this on my bottom lip and then purse my lips it lasts all day, I think it&#x27;s wonderful.</li>
    <li> Evidently my Revlon couldn&#x27;t help themselves and had to change colors and packaging.  Thankfully, I get to hold out a little longer by ordering through Amazon and stocking up on my favorite Maximum Mocha... the new # 080 ain&#x27;t like it use to be.</li>
    <li> this color is so hard to find.  so excited to find online and for a great price.  only disappointment was i ordered three and only got two. the third one i received was a different color.  but i didnt want to go through the hassle of returning. other than that im happy.</li>
    <li> I love this color and cannot find it in any of the stores any longer. It stays on for a very long time, but after eating, I do have to apply more lipstick to my lips, especially if I eat anything made with oil.  I can&#x27;t figure out why the cosmetic manufacturers stopped making this beautiful lipstick in this particular color.  Someone has a loose screw in their head at Revlon.</li>
    <li> stays on more than 24 hours - GREAT</li>
    <li> Best all day lip color and 080 is my favorite color.  Glad I can get this color still on Amazon</li>
    <li> This is my favorite brand of lipstick for all day wear. i put this on in the morning and it stays ALL DAY LONG  I just hate that revlon no longer makes this color! :( I buy it when and wherever i can The color is a basic brown. but it is my EVERYDAY lip color.</li>
    <li> This Revlon liquid lipstick is the best. It stays on for hours and the color is beautiful. No need to keep reapplying after eating as you will have lipstick still on. How great is that!</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t found this color any where, thanks to Amazon I got my favorite lipstick again, I bought 3 of the Maximum Mocha 080, Revlon Colorstay ultimate liquid Lipstick is a great product, the price and shipping was amazing!!!  I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase,  Thank you!</li>
    <li> I love this color......sometimes I put little shimmer on top but usually it&#x27;s just it.....pretty......last hours on my lips.....unfortunately this color is going out of production.....</li>
    <li> stays put&lt;br /&gt;tube lasts a long time&lt;br /&gt;I wear this daily...put it on once in the morning remove at night with olive oil.</li>
    <li> so disappointed you can no longer find this color in the store.&lt;br /&gt;exact color for my style.</li>
    <li> I like these lipsticks, have used them for YEARS. The only think I don&#x27;t like about them is they react differently with my lips.</li>
    <li> Color is long-lasting, but dry. I usually apply lip gloss over it.  The color (Maximum Mocha) is true - a pumpkin orange.</li>
    <li> Would consider ordering again. Color stays on pretty much the whole day, great color.  Very easy to remove with make-up remover.</li>
    <li> I love this product.  I can put it on in the morning, have lunch, leave work and it is still on and lovely.  It does not dry lips like some of the stay on colors by other companies.  I highly recommend it for the busy lady who doesn&#x27;t have time for all day make-up touch-ups.</li>
    <li> My favorite color and it had been discontinued! I bought five of the thirteen you had in stock and went back the next week to get the rest but they were all gone. Love this lipstick!</li>
    <li> This is my favorite color and has been discontinued. I was so pleased to be able to stock up.&lt;br /&gt;Great find for me.</li>
    <li> No longer available in Walgreens and CVS, infract unable to find in our stores.  Love this lipstick, the only one that stays on until you take it off.  Happy I could find on line, purchased several  from different merchandisers.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this lipstick for awhile.  It&#x27;s nice to be able to order it online instead of trying to find it in the stores</li>
    <li> dear&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would like to subscribe very much for your dear to me and I want to be a client I have you to&lt;br /&gt;And I tell you that my shipment in the very beauty and magnificence</li>
    <li> I love the lip color it stays true I used to purchase at  the local  walmart and other stores. I panicked when I could not find my lip colors .</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a long time, but recently couldn&#x27;t find my color in the store so I ordered it here. It stays on all day unless you eat something with a lot of oil in it, and it doesn&#x27;t feel dry.</li>
    <li> This has become hard to find. it took quite a while to receive these, but it is worth the wait. My wife always looks for this when we are at stores that have cosmetics and it has been a while since we have seen them. She like the way it looks and stays on.</li>
