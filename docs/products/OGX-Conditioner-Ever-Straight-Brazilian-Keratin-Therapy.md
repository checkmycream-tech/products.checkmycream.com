      <li>Fabulous, love it.</li>
      <li>I love this conditioner and when it&#x27;s available as an add on at this price you can&#x27;t beat it.  </li>
      <li>Smells great and leaves my hair soft and smooth.</li>
      <li>Keeps hair smooth and prevents freezing.&lt;br /&gt;Very</li>
      <li>So far so good.</li>
      <li>So, a shower before, allowing hair to dry before bed and going to bed gives me the best result to get straight hair</li>
      <li>It is only good for one application.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this product.</li>
      <li>I love love love this product it make my hair feel so soft and alive I cowash with it</li>
      <li>This moisturizes the hell out of my otherwise dry hair- and smells nice to boot.  </li>
      <li>first and after rinsing the co-wash I will apply this conditioner and see if it still tangles my hair.</li>
      <li>It leaves my hair sticky and less smooth than most conditioners.</li>
      <li>So this product really helps with pulling the curls out from the roots and kept my hair straight all week and still the end of the week continues to be straight, love it hair is really soft</li>
      <li>My new hair soaks up moisture and is super thirsty.</li>

      <li>LIKE SO MUCH</li>
      <li>don&#x27;t expect for it to make your hair bone straight</li>
      <li>I have noticed a real difference in my hair&#x27;s sheen and manageability since I&#x27;ve started using this.</li>
      <li>I would highly recommend it.</li>
      <li>I used to have straight, silky soft hair until I took the medication Depakote.</li>
      <li>if it any straightener than normal</li>
      <li>The conditioner is really thick and smells nice</li>
      <li>it makes my hair very smooth, i&#x27;m not sure</li>
      <li>My hair is shiny, soft, silky and feels wonderful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Makes hair completely soft.</li>
      <li>guess my expectation was that the shampoo and conditioner would make my hair 100% straight and give me back my hold hair texture and straightness.</li>
      <li>I actually have straight hair but this scent was just too irresistible to me</li>
      <li>my hair was really soft and when it was time to blow dry my hair it was straight as if I put a perm in my hair.</li>
      <li>I have extremely thick, coarse, wavy/curly hair and this product is like magic.</li>
      <li>My hair is puffy / fluffy /frizzy and not laying down smooth and straight.</li>
      <li>and it definitely loosens the curl pattern of natural hair</li>
      <li>My new hair is extremely dry.</li>
      <li>This is what happens with only shampoo and conditioner and no other products or a hair straightener applied to my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>When my hair grew back in after stopping Depakote the new hair is a darker color, curly, wavy, frizzy, dry and course in texture.</li>

    <li> Best price that I&#x27;ve found and it definitely loosens the curl pattern of natural hair but I use it with the shampoo as well... don&#x27;t expect for it to make your hair bone straight but I can see that the natural curl isn&#x27;t as tight as before</li>
    <li> Love this conditioner</li>
    <li> Only used once. So far so good.</li>
    <li> I love love love this product it make my hair feel so soft and alive I cowash with it your missing our if you never tried it</li>
    <li> Fabulous, love it. Smells great and leaves my hair soft and smooth.</li>
    <li> I wish they had the shampoo in this size on Amazon...I love this conditioner and when it&#x27;s available as an add on at this price you can&#x27;t beat it.  Now let&#x27;s get the shampoo on here as well!</li>
    <li> I would buy this again when we run out. It doesn&#x27;t seem to dry hair and it seems to help prevent end splitting.  And when straightening, the hair is perfect almost every time.  They do not offer auto ship on this product but they should.</li>
    <li> Really great shampoo One of the best i have ever used. Keeps hair smooth and prevents freezing.&lt;br /&gt;Very good choice. Keeps its promises.</li>
    <li> I love love love this conditioner! I have noticed a real difference in my hair&#x27;s sheen and manageability since I&#x27;ve started using this. My hair also seems to dry straighter on it&#x27;s own. I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this product. If you&#x27;re at all thinking of trying this, it&#x27;s a great choice.</li>
    <li> It leaves my hair sticky and less smooth than most conditioners. I am beginning to think organic products are just not effective when it comes to something like this.</li>

    <li> This is the best conditioner for hair that you are going to use a flat iron on. It shines and your hair is very smooth</li>
    <li> This is the best conditioner! My hair is long and gets very dry and frizzy but this makes it so soft I ordered a couple bottles so I don&#x27;t run out......</li>
    <li> My hair is wavy, curly and frizzy. I used to have straight, silky soft hair until I took the medication Depakote. Depakote made my hair fall out. When my hair grew back in after stopping Depakote the new hair is a darker color, curly, wavy, frizzy, dry and course in texture. I have been on the hunt for products to straighten my hair and provide moisture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Argon Oil helps, but washes out with each washing. It is only good for one application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried this shampoo and conditioner. My hair is softer, silkier, straighter, but not completely straight. There is a little bit of a wave to it. My hair is puffy / fluffy /frizzy and not laying down smooth and straight. However, 95% of the curl and waviness is gone. That is a pretty good reduction in waviness and curls. This is what happens with only shampoo and conditioner and no other products or a hair straightener applied to my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I shampoo, condition my hair and then sleep on it the fluffiness / puffiness is mostly gone in the morning. So, a shower before, allowing hair to dry before bed and going to bed gives me the best result to get straight hair the following morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For giving me moisture this shampoo and conditioner combo is impressive. My new hair soaks up moisture and is super thirsty. My new hair is extremely dry. After one use I could tell the difference. My hair is shiny, soft, silky and feels wonderful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I guess my expectation was that the shampoo and conditioner would make my hair 100% straight and give me back my hold hair texture and straightness. It can&#x27;t do that. No one can. No product can.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am happy with these products. I recommend them.</li>
    <li> My favorite conditioner ever.  I actually have straight hair but this scent was just too irresistible to me so I had to try it.  Makes my hair even smoother and softer, and also seems to add volume and thickness.  No complaints, wish it was cheaper maybe, but I&#x27;ll keep buying it anyways. It is very thick so occasionally I thin it out with water and/or other conditioners provided the smells blend.</li>
    <li> This is one of two conditioners that I use and I have to say this though this product is a bit thick it really does a great job. I would highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I rate this conditioner 4 stars because in using this conditioner I noticed my hair tangled after applying it. The conditioner is really thick and smells nice I love the scent of it. I will use this conditioner again but only before using I will apply a co-wash first and after rinsing the co-wash I will apply this conditioner and see if it still tangles my hair. I will say all in all the Shampoo and Conditioner it did its job my hair was really soft and when it was time to blow dry my hair it was straight as if I put a perm in my hair. I stopped putting perms in my hair because I really didnt need them, my hair is wavy curly type thin not thick at all. So this product really helps with pulling the curls out from the roots and kept my hair straight all week and still the end of the week continues to be straight, love it hair is really soft</li>
    <li> This is the best conditioner I have ever used. I have extremely thick, coarse, wavy/curly hair and this product is like magic. And it smells AMAZING!</li>
    <li> This has got to be the best Keratin product on the market it had a pleasant not to perfume scent I will be buying this again OGX has a great line and so many choices for healthy hair.</li>
    <li> Have always brought this product from the store and it usually cost about $25 for this size. it is definitely a great buy</li>
    <li> I really like the smell of thisand it makes my hair very smooth, i&#x27;m not sure if it any straightener than normal but i still love it.</li>
    <li> Works flawlessly!! Makes hair completely soft. I&#x27;m half Jamaican so I naturally have pincurls; my hair has been chemically relaxed to the point of breakage-- half of my hair is about two inches shorter than the other side. This product is helping to smooth the hair; I can honestly say it&#x27;s helping it grow too!</li>
    <li> Really great conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) Coconut smells great in my hair&lt;br /&gt;2) My hair feels silky&lt;br /&gt;3) I get compliments about how good it smells :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just an FYI, I&#x27;m asian with wavy thick oily/dry hair.</li>
    <li> My children use this and the shampoo.  They have long hair, difficult to manage hair and this makes their hair easier manageable.</li>
    <li> works good and smells great</li>
    <li> Perfect complement to the shampoo, leave your hair amazing and smells delicious!!!!</li>
