      <li>Makes it easy to soak off my nails.</li>
      <li>Finally doing my gel nails and it is a wonderful kit, thanks!</li>
      <li>I would think that a cotton ball/round soaked in remover and placed inside would do the trick nicely and avoid soaking your whole finger in chemicals.</li>
      <li>great especially the foil for removing get effortlessly</li>
      <li>Not bad.</li>
      <li>I have used the acetone pump, much better an secure than my old one.</li>
      <li>Exactly what I wanted!</li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t tried the pump bottle, but the fillable clean up tool works pretty well.</li>
      <li>I wasn&#x27;t thrilled about the foil, but that&#x27;s because it wasn&#x27;t that different from using tin foil with cotton balls.</li>
      <li>WELL WORTH THE PRICE.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s still useful in a away</li>
      <li>but I imagine that if I had a &amp;#34;girls pampering day&amp;#34; or something like that I would use it with my girlfriends for fun.</li>
      <li>nail caps are nice, but I did have a minor issue with them.</li>
      <li>/&gt;The steel cuticle pusher was also nice, but with a minor issue.</li>
      <li>The tiny cups that go on my fingers work ok</li>
      <li>Rubber seal tore with first use.</li>
      <li>I love the foil wraps, I actually prefer them to the caps.</li>
      <li>The second is that filing the top of the gel coat really helps.</li>
      <li>Kind of reminds me of half a citrus juicer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used the foil wraps and they are actually pretty decent.</li>
      <li>Didn&#x27;t really care for the finger tip plastic covers, kind of tight.</li>
      <li>I do think my favorites are the ready to use foil wraps.</li>
      <li>and they all work very well.  </li>
      <li>All items in this kit are very practical and work well for removing the Gel nail polish.</li>
      <li>Very misleading.</li>
      <li>very helpful items.</li>
      <li>The problem I had was that they leaked if I moved my hand around too much.</li>
      <li>This product is more trouble than it is worth.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m pretty new at using gel paints and had the hardest time trying to remove it.</li>
      <li>Will also work great for polish cleanup, since I&#x27;m sloppy when rushing.&lt;br</li>
      <li>The pink finger things leak but other then that the set it great</li>
      <li>They fit my small hands and fingers fine</li>
      <li>Highly recommend for anyone who uses gel/shellac polish.</li>
      <li>My favorite is the little finger tins.</li>
      <li>The cuticle correction pens are a lovely little tool and they come with a bunch of replacement tips.</li>
      <li>The only thing worth it is the tub to soak your nails in.</li>
      <li>The foil wraps around the fingertip securely and stays in place, the attached pad is thin but strong, and it doesn&#x27;t shred when you attempt to remove it.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
      <li>Live it.</li>
      <li>They fit on my fingers, my son&#x27;s tiny fingers, and my husband&#x27;s larger fingers.  </li>
      <li>I love the cuticle scraper for helping me remove the polish, The nail caps do work, although I leave the pink part off for my thumbs because they are too big for them.</li>
      <li>The soaker dish works pretty well, giving you the ability to to soak just the nails with a hump in the middle to rest your palm on.</li>
      <li>Side note the cuticle pusher that it came with is way higher quality than I ever would have expected its very sturdy.</li>
      <li>I really like the individual soakers.</li>
      <li>I got it because I had 3 week old shellac on my fingers.</li>
      <li>Those two items alone were around $8-$12 so for a few more $, I got extra</li>
      <li>The bottle leaks, I had to remove the pump and just turn the bottle over on the swab pad to stop making such a mess and the foil wraps work, but not any more than regular aluminum foil with cotton balls would.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> great especially the foil for removing get effortlessly</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t really care for the finger tip plastic covers, kind of tight. Haven&#x27;t used the soaking dish. The foil wraps are perfect. I use to soak off gel nails.</li>
    <li> Good buy for the price.  My only complaint is with the finger soakers.  They fit my small hands and fingers fine but my 16 year old daughtwr is unable to use them. She couldn&#x27;t fit one on her thumb at all and the other were so tight they left an indention. Otherwise all is as expected!</li>
    <li> The nail polish removal kit was purchased for a gift for my daughter.  She loves this gift and uses it all the time.  All items in this kit are very practical and work well for removing the Gel nail polish.</li>
    <li> Perfect, exactly what I ordered! No holes, no leaks everything works great! Side note the cuticle pusher that it came with is way higher quality than I ever would have expected its very sturdy. I&#x27;m extremely happy with my purchase and highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> so convenient and has everything you could need.  I was a bit concerned because the plastic pieces seemed flimsy.  Not at all and they all work very well.  I do think my favorites are the ready to use foil wraps.</li>
    <li> Not bad. didnt like the pinks tubes one puts on fingers to let it soak in,  it spilled and too tight, mind you my hand is small.</li>
    <li> This product makes taking off gel nails a lot easier.  My only issue was that the bottle you put the nail polish remover in, leaks really bad from around its lid.  Every time I would turn it upside down to use it, it would pour down the sides. I found everything else to be great to use.</li>
    <li> Great and Fast Delivery</li>
    <li> Love this kit!  For the price, you get everything you need to remove a gel manicure.  I&#x27;m not sure about the individual finger tip things, but you don&#x27;t need them.  I&#x27;m saving tons of money doing my own gel manicures at home every week.</li>
    <li> very helpful items. good value</li>
    <li> ***This item was sponsored to me by Bundle Monster in exchange for my honest review***&lt;br /&gt;This gel polish removal kit comes with products that are great for gel polish and glitter polish lovers. I&#x27;m focusing my review on the foil wraps, nail tip caps, and steel cuticle pusher. My favorite part out of the included items were the foil wraps. I honestly couldn&#x27;t find any flaws with them. The foil wraps around the fingertip securely and stays in place, the attached pad is thin but strong, and it doesn&#x27;t shred when you attempt to remove it.&lt;br /&gt;The nail caps are nice, but I did have a minor issue with them. The problem I had was that they leaked if I moved my hand around too much. They did remove my soak off gel polish easily, I just had to keep still while soaking it off.&lt;br /&gt;The steel cuticle pusher was also nice, but with a minor issue. It just felt a little too sharp for me. I had to be extremely careful to only push the gel with it and not accidentally damage my nail.&lt;br /&gt;I did learn some nice tips while testing this kit. The first is to use acetone with glycerin so your cuticles aren&#x27;t a mess when you are done. The second is that filing the top of the gel coat really helps. The last thing is to not force the gel. You will know to look at it when it will come off easily.</li>
    <li> The pump container leaks, the have soaking bowl is unnecessary, and the individual finger soakers cause a mess. The chili abd own correcters were with it.</li>
    <li> Lots of things to close from and like the quality.</li>
    <li> Finally doing my gel nails and it is a wonderful kit, thanks!</li>
    <li> Very cheap stuff&lt;br /&gt;But I kept it&lt;br /&gt;And will start using it sometime later&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s still useful in a away</li>
    <li> Great set for removing my gel manicure!</li>
    <li> Seriously? This showed up with no acetone or instructions. I am not even sure where to start. Very misleading. Bummer.</li>
    <li> The acetone leaks out; they are too deep which is a waste a lot of product. They don&#x27;t fit on toes! Did not like them would not recommend to anyone.</li>
    <li> I love my products! Such a great value! Exactly what I wanted! I was so happy when I received my package! I&#x27;m a happy customer! Thank you!</li>
    <li> I have used almost everything in this kit. I love the cuticle scraper for helping me remove the polish, The nail caps do work, although I leave the pink part off for my thumbs because they are too big for them. I love the foil wraps, I actually prefer them to the caps. I use the pump for my alcohol since I use it like crazy to clean and finish off my nails. I haven&#x27;t tried the pens or the tub yet, but I like the quality of everything else in this kit, so I&#x27;ll say they are probably good as well. Good Buy!</li>
    <li> Great product for the do it yourself manicurist or the professional!</li>
    <li> As described. I ave not used it yet, but it looks very easy to use.</li>
    <li> Fantastic set for doing your own gel nails at home. My friends even have me doing theirs.</li>
    <li> This product is more trouble than it is worth. It is far too much trouble to use and was a waste of my money but not worth the trouble of returning.</li>
    <li> The only thing worth it is the tub to soak your nails in.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not of the greatest quality but it does the job. I love the bowl for doing manicures. I&#x27;ve used the foil wraps and they are actually pretty decent. I haven&#x27;t used the fingertip things but I didn&#x27;t buy the kit for those anyway. I did try the little bottle pump to put my polish remover in like they have at the salon, it doesn&#x27;t work very well. The cuticle correction pens are a lovely little tool and they come with a bunch of replacement tips. This was a great value.</li>
    <li> This was terrible. Sending it back.literally looks like a play kit.</li>
    <li> Every method of shellac/gel polish removal you could hope for. Highly recommend for anyone who uses gel/shellac polish. I especially like the fingertip caps and the acetone markers that help to remove small mistakes while you&#x27;re doing your nails.</li>
    <li> I used this kit the second I got it because I had 3 week old shellac on my fingers. I tested both the foil wrappers and the finger tip soakers. I definitely, recommend and prefer the soakers to the foil. The cotton piece on the foil is small and doesn&#x27;t hold much, so on the nails I tested it on it only removed like one layer of polish. I then switched to soaking all of my fingers.&lt;br /&gt;The soakers themselves are leaky and hard to get the acetone into without spilling.&lt;br /&gt;I really enjoyed the cuticle pusher and thought it worked very nicely. I have not yet used the bottle of the bowl but I imagine that if I had a &amp;#34;girls pampering day&amp;#34; or something like that I would use it with my girlfriends for fun.</li>
    <li> Live it. Makes it easy to soak off my nails.</li>
    <li> The bundle comes with a lot of items. I have used the acetone pump, much better an secure than my old one. I have used the finger tip plastic things (I know you love my description) for removing gel and tips. These work well, however they hurt my fingers around the silicone part. The wraps are nice. I just don&#x27;t want to use them all. I haven&#x27;t used the pens yet either...all in all, a good deal</li>
    <li> They work but....they LEAK ÷  :-( make sure that you have a towel,  bc they make a mess!</li>
    <li> What you see it what you get, I like that! Good quality</li>
    <li> This is a neat little kit for nail polish removal. Tons of things in the package</li>
    <li> I received this item as a gift and it is the best bundle ever! The little scraper to scrape off your polishe or gel cost like $15 by itself I haven&#x27;t tried the the finger things but I like how the foil has the cotton already on it everything came neat in one package but all individually wrapped I&#x27;m not sure what to do with the gell pin I don&#x27;t know if you put polish remover inside of it or if you dip into the polish remover and I gave maybe 10 refills for the pin. WELL WORTH THE PRICE.</li>
    <li> Really good price and i use the foil more then anything plus the acetone dispencer!</li>
    <li> Very disappointed no instructiuons were included for a beginner</li>
    <li> Poor quality but quick shipment! Rubber seal tore with first use. Had to throw it away. Bottle liquid dispenser doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m giving this 4 stars because there are some good pieces in here. I wasn&#x27;t thrilled about the foil, but that&#x27;s because it wasn&#x27;t that different from using tin foil with cotton balls. I actually had to add some extra cotton inside because it wasn&#x27;t big enough to hold enough acetone. The soaker dish works pretty well, giving you the ability to to soak just the nails with a hump in the middle to rest your palm on. I haven&#x27;t tried the pump bottle, but the fillable clean up tool works pretty well. I really like the individual soakers. Yes, the will leak if you try to get up and do stuff with them on. I do one hand at a time and keep my fingers pointed down. No leaking and no smelling acetone throughout the room. It makes removal way easier and keeps me from spending more money at the salon to have them removed!</li>
    <li> I use them every week when I do my nails.</li>
    <li> Would have been handy to have had some instructions on how to use it</li>
    <li> The bottle leaks, I had to remove the pump and just turn the bottle over on the swab pad to stop making such a mess and the foil wraps work, but not any more than regular aluminum foil with cotton balls would. It&#x27;s okay, but I wish I had saved my money. There are also no instructions, so I had to go to other reviews to figure out what to do.</li>
    <li> The pink finger things leak but other then that the set it great</li>
    <li> I purchased this bundle because I wanted the pens and foil.  Those two items alone were around $8-$12 so for a few more $, I got extra stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The manicure bowl, as pictured, is upside down.  When you use it, flip it over so that you have a nice wrist rest and then your hand curves around the inside.  Kind of reminds me of half a citrus juicer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love the foil.  I&#x27;ve found it to be reusable.  Used Onyx blue coconut mixed with acetone in the little pump bottle.  Pump once or twice, wrap my nails tightly, set timer for 15 minutes.  I soaked off one hand, then soaked off the other.  Scraped away residue with orange stick from nails.  I rinsed the foil off and it&#x27;s good for another use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pump bottle works great. There is a small amount of leakage around the pumping mechanism, and is collected by the lip underneath the pump.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did use the metal scraper once, but I&#x27;m afraid of damaging my weak nails.  I didn&#x27;t have any problems using it, but decided an orange stick would be better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Removal pens with extra tips- these are awesome.  I filled (slowly) with acetone.  Push the back on tightly, it should snap into place.  I used it to apply acetone to my nail bed, finding that it dries better than rubbing alcohol. Will also work great for polish cleanup, since I&#x27;m sloppy when rushing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Soakers are the only item I haven&#x27;t used yet.  They fit on my fingers, my son&#x27;s tiny fingers, and my husband&#x27;s larger fingers.  I would think that a cotton ball/round soaked in remover and placed inside would do the trick nicely and avoid soaking your whole finger in chemicals.</li>
    <li> fast shipping and great price</li>
    <li> Works awesome for removing stubborn gel paint. I&#x27;m pretty new at using gel paints and had the hardest time trying to remove it. My favorite is the little finger tins. The tiny cups that go on my fingers work ok but they are a tad messy</li>
