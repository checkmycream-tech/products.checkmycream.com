      <li>This product is great to put emphasis on those waves!  </li>
      <li>This is an excellent waver.</li>
      <li>I would say this is a good product!</li>
      <li>but my hair always looks beautiful when I style it with this product I seen it in Sally&#x27;s for $50</li>
      <li>Great buy.</li>
      <li>and my hair came out great.  </li>
      <li>lol.</li>
      <li>The waves did not look good.  </li>
      <li>If you want a good triple barrel waver... go with Revlon.</li>
      <li>This iron makes the most beautiful waves.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a great product, but maybe it could get better.</li>
      <li>Watch my YouTube video (Beautiful Beachy Waves Tutorial) to see how easy it is to style your hair.  </li>
      <li>Enjoy!</li>
      <li>I really enjoyed using it while it worked.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s nothing more than an updated crimping iron.</li>
      <li>I did not buy this item here, I bought it at Sally&#x27;s for substantially more.</li>
      <li>I believe that is user error!  :-)  </li>
      <li>I absolutely love the beach waves this thing gives my hair.</li>
      <li>but I sure did.  </li>
      <li>the barrels cover more of my hair.  </li>
      <li>I GOT THIS CURLING IRON FOR MY GRAND DAUGHTER</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m glad I found it a lot cheaper</li>
      <li>I absolutely LOVE the waves I get with this waver.</li>
      <li>With patience and practice, you&#x27;ll be able to get beautiful natural beachy waves.  </li>
      <li>My roommate loved my hair so much that she went and bought one too!</li>
      <li>It worked great and got super hot.  </li>
      <li>and the indent is so strong that you don&#x27;t need any hair spray to hold the wave.</li>
      <li>When handle was intact unit worked fine.  </li>
      <li>It heats up quick, is sturdy, and I can get that beachy look in 15 minutes!</li>
      <li>The large barrels allow for a nice wave.</li>
      <li>This cheap plastic piece breaks which causes the handle to no longer work and separates the triple barrels from it&#x27;s backing.  </li>
      <li>there&#x27;s a cheap plastic \\&quot;stopper\\&quot;</li>
      <li>Plus it doesn&#x27;t smooth the hair either.</li>
      <li>It makes distinct and beautiful waves at about the mid heat setting.</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s so worth it!  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tested several wavers but this one is by far the best I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
      <li>Great idea but never seems to get hot enough to curl 100%human hair weave.</li>
      <li>Loved it Yess is big</li>
      <li>I quickly took my hair out of the waver and looked at it to find that in fact it had been melted.</li>
      <li>This gets very hot and works well.</li>
      <li>The handle gets very hot.  </li>
      <li>Stick to one of the Hot n Gold barrel irons instead!</li>
      <li>It gets hot fast and is super easy to use.</li>
      <li>It helps a lot to use a heat protectant, this thing gets hot quick.  </li>
      <li>And there is raised imprinted writing located right on the handle</li>
      <li>perfect S, or ribbon, waves that are shiny, bouncy, and last for days with a few touch</li>
      <li>The unit itself gets hot, and waves the hair reliably</li>
      <li>It is an interesting product and the problems are likely user error.  </li>
      <li>It will start smoking if it gets too hot.</li>
      <li>come on, really!</li>
      <li>I dropped it on myself once while it was hot.</li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t been able to find another jumbo waver designed much differently,</li>
      <li>I bought this item for my daughter for Christmas 2011 and the handle broke the first time she used it.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll never purchase a Gold &#x27;N Hot product again.    </li>
      <li>First, the clamping handle is plastic not metal</li>
      <li>The first time it broke</li>
      <li>I like them both, but the jumbo makes perfect sized \\&quot;S\\&quot; waves in my very long and thick hair.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m sure it was a manufacturing defect based on all the other ratings that were positive.  </li>
      <li>I am very dissapointed, as I just bought this product in April 2013.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another</li>
      <li>It heats up fast and heats the hair evenly with plenty of heat settings to choose from.  </li>
      <li>The smaller waver creates a very fun, but</li>
      <li>It was quick, hot, and the waves stay for a long time.</li>
      <li>The jumbo waves are softer and less prone frizz, and more suitable for wearing everyday.  </li>
      <li>I was given this product for free at Sally&#x27;s Beauty salon after purchasing other things for a certain amount of money.</li>
      <li>There seems to be a high learning curve with this type of hair styler.  </li>
      <li>Next, the handle gets hot!  </li>
      <li>I was testing it out and the first few strands were perfectly fine.</li>
      <li>I figured I received a faulty iron and just \\&quot;ate\\&quot; the price but the second time proved that Gold &#x27;N Hot needs a new engineer!</li>
      <li>Mine has melted on the first day and i m gonna give it back.</li>
      <li>Also the jumbo barrels are not too short, they are plenty long enough to fit larger sections of hair, but it creates a much more defined curl if you work with smaller sections.  </li>
      <li>much tighter / smaller wave.  </li>
      <li>I have naturally wavy hair.  </li>
      <li>Lastly, neither the jumbo or smaller waver has an auto shut off which is a pet peeve of mine, so be careful to make sure its unplugged when you&#x27;re done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I have only used this once so far to try it out</li>
      <li>The first time I used it I was half way through my hair before it broke.  </li>
      <li>it&#x27;s hot, heavy, and the writing digs into my hand.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Despite all these complaints, the end result is exactly what I wanted: soft, bouncy, well defined, ribbon waves that last a few days with minor touch ups.  </li>
      <li>Normally i&#x27;m a big fan of all Hot n Gold products, but this one is a waste of money.</li>
      <li>And if that&#x27;s not bad enough, you may want to wear thick gloves when using this product.</li>
      <li>I now have a huge chunk of hair missing because of the excessive amount of heat this product puts out, I even had to turn it down 50 degrees because it was so hot before i started.</li>
      <li>The jumbo waver is heavy, but what would you expect for 3 large barrels?</li>

<li> You can hold it on your hair longer for a very tight wave, or for a shorter amount of time for a loose wave.</li>
<li> When you pull the clamp down to wave your hair</li>
<li> you have to clamp down to curl.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I did not buy this item here, I bought it at Sally&#x27;s for substantially more. I really enjoyed using it while it worked. It was quick, hot, and the waves stay for a long time. You can hold it on your hair longer for a very tight wave, or for a shorter amount of time for a loose wave. Unfortunately, during regular use this morning, the back part of the barrel snapped away from the two prongs, right at the base where the metal meets the plastic. I am very dissapointed, as I just bought this product in April 2013.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another issue with the product is that it is very heavy, I eventually got used to the weight but when I first started to use it, it was a little difficult. I dropped it on myself once while it was hot. Be careful!</li>
    <li> Purchased this product twice and both broke.  The first time I used it I was half way through my hair before it broke.  I then purchased another and didn&#x27;t even get half way through my hair with the second use.    Very poor design flaw. When you pull the clamp down to wave your hair there&#x27;s a cheap plastic \\&quot;stopper\\&quot; (don&#x27;t know what else to call it) that stops from pushing it down further.  This cheap plastic piece breaks which causes the handle to no longer work and separates the triple barrels from it&#x27;s backing.  The first time it broke I figured I received a faulty iron and just \\&quot;ate\\&quot; the price but the second time proved that Gold &#x27;N Hot needs a new engineer! The box says that there&#x27;s a one year warranty but they do not honor it.    And if that&#x27;s not bad enough, you may want to wear thick gloves when using this product. The boxy design of the handle rubs against the inside of your thumb so bad that it rubs it raw.    Needless to say I&#x27;m VERY DISSAPOINTED and UPSET! $100 down the drain. I&#x27;ll never purchase a Gold &#x27;N Hot product again.    If you want a good triple barrel waver... go with Revlon. I had mine for almost 6 years before the heating element went out. Also, it wont kill your thumb or hand.</li>
    <li> I dont know about the other ppl who didnt like this but I sure did.  It worked great and got super hot.  I have only used this once so far to try it out and my hair came out great.  I would say this is a good product!</li>
    <li> The barrel melted the plastic lining of the rims where wires run.  Unable to use, damaged when plugged in. Unable to return.</li>
    <li> This was one of the worst hot tools I have used! It doesn&#x27;t even crimp my hair! It gave a lousy little minimal wave but nothing that was described in reviews. Disappointed and returning it tomorrow I paid $40 for it 👎🏽</li>
    <li> I bought this item for my daughter for Christmas 2011 and the handle broke the first time she used it. It is a plasic molded handle...come on, really! Poor designing on somebody&#x27;s part but Amazon took it back no questions. Thats why I do business here.</li>
    <li> Loved it Yess is big but my hair always looks beautiful when I style it with this product I seen it in Sally&#x27;s for $50 I&#x27;m glad I found it a lot cheaper (:</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tested several wavers but this one is by far the best I&#x27;ve used.  It&#x27;s a bit heavy but it&#x27;s so worth it!  With patience and practice, you&#x27;ll be able to get beautiful natural beachy waves.  Watch my YouTube video (Beautiful Beachy Waves Tutorial) to see how easy it is to style your hair.  [...]</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s kinda hard for people who have no ability. At first sight, you think it&#x27;s worthless, but then you think you are doing something wrong (and probably you are). It&#x27;s a great product, but maybe it could get better.</li>
    <li> my hair is very long, pass my waist.  the product is very heavy so after doing it for 5 mins, it feels as though that I have a carpal tunnel pain.  Im not recommending this product.</li>
    <li> I was given this product for free at Sally&#x27;s Beauty salon after purchasing other things for a certain amount of money. I was testing it out and the first few strands were perfectly fine. Then I got to about my fourth piece of hair and was counting to 10 when I smelled something burning. I quickly took my hair out of the waver and looked at it to find that in fact it had been melted. I now have a huge chunk of hair missing because of the excessive amount of heat this product puts out, I even had to turn it down 50 degrees because it was so hot before i started. I used heat protected and it still did this to my hair. If you have taken the time to read this thank you and thank yourself because you will be saving yourself from losing chunks of your hair.</li>
    <li> Never never buy it! Mine has melted on the first day and i m gonna give it back. İ ordered it twice and the result is same.</li>
    <li> This iron makes the most beautiful waves. and the indent is so strong that you don&#x27;t need any hair spray to hold the wave. My waves actually stay in for at least three days with no hair spray at all</li>
    <li> I absolutely LOVE the waves I get with this waver. It heats up quick, is sturdy, and I can get that beachy look in 15 minutes! Great buy.</li>
    <li> I GOT THIS CURLING IRON FOR MY GRAND DAUGHTER AND I DO NOT LIKE IT AND NEITHER DOES SHE.. WISH I HAD MY MONEY BACK..IT IS TO HEAVY AND DOSEN&#x27;T DO THE WAVES WELL AT ALL..IT TOOK FOREVER FOR US TO USE IT ONE TIME AND I HAD ENOUGH OF IT..GUESS IT WILL PROBABLY GO IN MY YARD SELL NEXT YEAR..</li>
    <li> I have naturally wavy hair.  This product is great to put emphasis on those waves!  I have also, never burned my face.  I believe that is user error!  :-)  It helps a lot to use a heat protectant, this thing gets hot quick.  I have very thick hair, it may make a difference on how well it waves.  Enjoy!</li>
    <li> Too big and cumbersome.</li>
    <li> This gets very hot and works well. The large barrels allow for a nice wave.</li>
    <li> I have this waver and the small barreled waver from the same manufacturer.  I like them both, but the jumbo makes perfect sized \\&quot;S\\&quot; waves in my very long and thick hair.  The smaller waver creates a very fun, but much tighter / smaller wave.  The jumbo waves are softer and less prone frizz, and more suitable for wearing everyday.  The jumbo waver is heavy, but what would you expect for 3 large barrels? It heats up fast and heats the hair evenly with plenty of heat settings to choose from.  It didn&#x27;t take as long to curl my hair with the jumbo waver as it did with the smaller one, probably bc the barrels cover more of my hair.  Also the jumbo barrels are not too short, they are plenty long enough to fit larger sections of hair, but it creates a much more defined curl if you work with smaller sections.  End result: perfect S, or ribbon, waves that are shiny, bouncy, and last for days with a few touch ups.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since I love the look it creates, it&#x27;s too bad I have to note several complaints about the device.  First, the clamping handle is plastic not metal and it&#x27;s not spring loaded. So you have to clamp down on the hair to curl it and I think the plastic handle will likely break over time. Also, my hand gets pretty tired b/c you have to squeeze the handle and the device is heavy.  Next, the handle gets hot!  Not exactly hot enough to burn, but it&#x27;s enough to be very uncomfortable especially bc you have to clamp down to curl. And there is raised imprinted writing located right on the handle so it hurts after a while of using it - it&#x27;s hot, heavy, and the writing digs into my hand.  Lastly, neither the jumbo or smaller waver has an auto shut off which is a pet peeve of mine, so be careful to make sure its unplugged when you&#x27;re done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Despite all these complaints, the end result is exactly what I wanted: soft, bouncy, well defined, ribbon waves that last a few days with minor touch ups.  I haven&#x27;t been able to find another jumbo waver designed much differently, so I guess I&#x27;ll keep this one, I just hope I can stand using the device over time.ently, so I guess I&#x27;ll keep this one, I just hope I can stand using the device over time.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent waver. It makes distinct and beautiful waves at about the mid heat setting. It will start smoking if it gets too hot. It does get a bit heavy if you have long hair like me. I have extremely thin hair with no body, but you&#x27;d never know it when I use this.</li>
    <li> It is an interesting product and the problems are likely user error.  There seems to be a high learning curve with this type of hair styler.  The unit itself gets hot, and waves the hair reliably, just the outcome has some left to be desired... As previously stated... Likely part of the learning curve.</li>
    <li> The handle gets very hot.  Almost burned my hand. The waves did not look good.  Difficult to use on yourself.</li>
    <li> Way bigger than we thought.</li>
    <li> Normally i&#x27;m a big fan of all Hot n Gold products, but this one is a waste of money. It&#x27;s nothing more than an updated crimping iron. Only not so small. It does not curl your hair at all. Plus it doesn&#x27;t smooth the hair either. It&#x27;s bulky,heavy, and hard to menvor. I have long hair,so it was difficult doing the back of my hair. I even burned myself in the process. By the time I was finished my hair kinda looked like Janis Joplins lol. A frizzy mess. Don&#x27;t waste your money on this iron. Stick to one of the Hot n Gold barrel irons instead!</li>
    <li> When handle was intact unit worked fine.  Handle broke less than a year use by my daughter.  Manufacturer was no help, will not be buying Belson Products again.  I&#x27;m sure it was a manufacturing defect based on all the other ratings that were positive.  I just feel that the manufacturer should stand behind their products.</li>
    <li> Great idea but never seems to get hot enough to curl 100%human hair weave. Maybe I&#x27;m using wrong.....</li>
    <li> One of the best hair heating tools I&#x27;ve purchased. I absolutely love the beach waves this thing gives my hair. It gets hot fast and is super easy to use. My roommate loved my hair so much that she went and bought one too! Goes to show that this is a wonderful product. You can&#x27;t go wrong with this!</li>
