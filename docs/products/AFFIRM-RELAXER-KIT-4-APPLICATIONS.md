      <li>i used all this other stuff, motions,paul mitchell, nexus, and  affirm relaxer and shampoo products {keracare] is the best I am in my 40s now</li>

      <li>It does not dry out my hair, there is no breakage as I have experienced with all the others, and it smooth&#x27;s my hair.</li>

      <li>an it relaxes your to silky smooth strands.</li>
      <li>I have tried numerous perms one&#x27;s that were not lye based and some that were, but with affirm I have always gotten great results.</li>
      <li>now I am forever a customer if you use this the way it says u will have straight, shiny, blowing in the wind sleek hair {mazani} is my second best.</li>
      <li>Apply the Gentle Assurance (to the scalp if you irritated it in any way)!!!</li>
      <li>/&gt;Anyway Affirm is good for coarse hair and it is easy on the scalp.</li>
      <li>After desired straightening is achieved, rinse relaxer completely from hair with warm water.    </li>
      <li>This produce burned areas of my hair even though it says MILD.</li>
      <li>The mild gives me the body and bounce I like.</li>
      <li>I use the mild.</li>
      <li>I used it as directed for mild.  </li>
      <li>Thanks Affirm!!</li>
      <li>BUT IT IS WELL WORTH</li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t over process and leaves hair soft and healthy.</li>
      <li>Well, only for ignorant people with no knowledge of their own hair and hair type.</li>
      <li>I purchased each of the items separately and I will say it was well worth it.  </li>
      <li>Still looks fresh and super straight after 3 weeks.</li>
      <li>Not only does it leave it soft and manageable, it smells good.  </li>
      <li>I followed the \\&quot;normal\\&quot; relaxer strength instructions for the exact amount of time.</li>
      <li>ON HOW PRETTY MY HAIR IS.</li>
      <li>it burns your hair to a crisp</li>
      <li>I have used this before, The results are consistent.</li>
      <li>This relaxer leaves my hair in a totally different, way better condition than store bought home relaxers.</li>
      <li>Step 3 5 in 1 Reconstructor or Positive Link</li>
      <li>(I work out a lot) based my scalp and ear tops with Carol&#x27;s Daughter healthy hair butter twice (making sure not to get too much on my new growth) and covered my ends only with Neutrogena deep conditioner.</li>
      <li>that all of the top/large salons that don&#x27;t have a large clientele who need a hair relaxer use Affirm.  </li>
      <li>I got the same results from my previous relaxer administrator (lol).</li>
      <li>My hair is fine and i always have about 1/4 of tub left, maybe i should start taking some off before adding the activator.&lt;br /&gt;Part</li>
      <li>I REALLY LIKE THE AFFIRM RELAXER.</li>
      <li>I also purchased the gentle assurance scalp protector to apply before relaxing.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t like for my hair to be too straight.</li>
      <li>Have spent more trying to repair it</li>
      <li>after i blew it out; it seemed straight</li>
      <li>and I used this on my daughters, nieces, grandgirls my whole family of women use this on all our hair and people that know us in the town</li>
      <li>After much research I decided to try lye relaxers and affirm one-out because it comes as a kit with 4 steps including conditioners.</li>
      <li>In order to protect the shaft and cuticle, utilization of this protein rich protectant at the proper PRE neutralizing step ensures a healthier feel and strength to the chemically treated hair.</li>
      <li>and I find it better than other relaxer.</li>
      <li>I would highly recommend using the product.</li>
      <li>I high recommend this product.</li>
      <li>It seems like every sensitive scalp relaxer burns certain areas on my head.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried the product once, and thus far do not like the product, my hair feels over conditioned and very lifeless.  </li>
      <li>WHEN I FIRST STARTING USING THIS PRODUCT, I THOUGHT IT WAS A BIT MUCH TO DO,</li>
      <li>Affirm 5 in 1 Reconstructor if hair is fine or limp; Positive Link if hair is medium or coarse; I used the 5 in 1 Reconstructor.  </li>
      <li>(I used the Sensitive Scalp formula)  </li>
      <li>Avoid applying the relaxer directly to the scalp.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Perhaps there is another kit with the complete set</li>
      <li>I looked like my hair was done by a professional</li>
      <li>I was trying to go natural but couldn&#x27;t take it anymore and decided to relax it.</li>
      <li>AS FAR AS THE STEPS,</li>
      <li>I would recommend using the Gentle Assurance prior to applying the Proteco if you scratched or irritated your scalp in any way.  </li>
      <li>MY HAIR IS SO SHINY AND SOFT, AND IT IS ALSO HEALTHY.I GET COMPLIMENTS ON MY HAIR</li>
      <li>I was looking for a sensitive scalp relaxer that wouldn&#x27;t burn my scalp.</li>
      <li>Gently work throughout entire head of hair, especially to the new growth area.     </li>
      <li>For retouches, apply relaxer creme to new growth only.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Very mild. One application is actually enough if not more for people with thick hair. My hair is fine and i always have about 1/4 of tub left, maybe i should start taking some off before adding the activator.&lt;br /&gt;Part of my hair relaxed with it definitely feels different (sleek, stronger, shinny, healthier looking) than the part i relaxed with other relaxers. Greatly recommend!</li>
    <li> I just love this relaxer and would recommend it. I was trying to go natural but couldn&#x27;t take it anymore and decided to relax it.</li>
    <li> It is a chemical be careful  can burn...but it does the job no accidents when done correctly and I find it better than other relaxer.</li>
    <li> My first time using this relaxer, Very good product ,   I will order from this site again</li>
    <li> After using no-lye relaxers for most of my life with terrible results, I did the big chop, grew out my hair natural for 2 years and then decided to try a relaxer again. I have kinky/course 4b-c hair type. After much research I decided to try lye relaxers and affirm one-out because it comes as a kit with 4 steps including conditioners. I did it yesterday and am very happy with the results. I washed and deep conditioned one week before, co-washed and added coconut oil 2 days before (I work out a lot) based my scalp and ear tops with Carol&#x27;s Daughter healthy hair butter twice (making sure not to get too much on my new growth) and covered my ends only with Neutrogena deep conditioner. I followed the \\&quot;normal\\&quot; relaxer strength instructions for the exact amount of time. Lots of smoothing with only a hint and I mean hint of scalp sensitivity. It could&#x27;ve been my imagination because I was so nervous about it. Anyway, after I finished the 4 step system, I conditioned with the Neutrogena deep conditioner then roller set and air dried with Keracare mouse (and a dash of coconut oil). Everything came out perfectly. I&#x27;m happy to answer any questions.</li>
    <li> hi i just have a question for you guys that have bought this product. does it come with the Normalizing Shampoo and the 5 in 1 reconstructor? if so i could save some money. thx for any help with this.</li>
    <li> Awesome  thanks  to  u for  providing  this  product</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried the product once, and thus far do not like the product, my hair feels over conditioned and very lifeless.  I&#x27;m going to try the product again in a couple of months to see if the results are just the same.  Please write me back for another evaluation of my results.</li>
    <li> Great buy if you do your own hair.</li>
    <li> This is a necessary component for the relaxing process.  In order to protect the shaft and cuticle, utilization of this protein rich protectant at the proper PRE neutralizing step ensures a healthier feel and strength to the chemically treated hair.</li>
    <li> Who said that Lye relaxers are dangerous? Well, only for ignorant people with no knowledge of their own hair and hair type. I used to buy no-lye relaxers and there was no justice with using them. Dr. Miracle,Motions,African Pride, and Optimum are all useless!! Use what the professionals are using.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway Affirm is good for coarse hair and it is easy on the scalp. I have read so many bad reviews on affirm, I really don&#x27;t know what they are talking about. My hair is silky,full and bouncy.</li>
    <li> This product works just great for my type of hair!!!&lt;br /&gt;I recommend it because it does not damage the hair like some other relaxers. Very satisfied with the brand Avlon.</li>
    <li> I used it as directed for mild.  Hair is straight but fried, after two weeks of heavy coditioning. Have spent more trying to repair it then I did to straighten it. GO TO A SALON ITS CHEAPER.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a sensitive scalp relaxer that wouldn&#x27;t burn my scalp. It seems like every sensitive scalp relaxer burns certain areas on my head. after reading all these great reviews I decided to try this out. what a mistake. this fried my hair and made it feel hard, even after I deep conditioned. I used all the products with the exception of protecto. the next day, i cowash my hair with roux and deep conditioned again; still was a bit hard. after i blew it out; it seemed straight but i didn&#x27;t like the feel of my hair. Now I&#x27;m stuck with 3 other applications.</li>
    <li> This produce burned areas of my hair even though it says MILD. It&#x27;s not mild and the shampoo and conditioner are atrocious. The conditioner is GREASY!!!!!!!!!!!!! and it doesn&#x27;t come out of your hair. this product is awful and probably the worst on the market. DO NOT USE THIS product if you want your hair on your head. it burns your hair to a crisp</li>
    <li> Great product an it relaxes your to silky smooth strands. Love getting my hair done with these products. Thanks Affirm!!</li>
    <li> Affirm Sensitive Scalp Relaxer System is the BEST!  I purchased each of the items separately and I will say it was well worth it.  I would recommend using the Gentle Assurance prior to applying the Proteco if you scratched or irritated your scalp in any way.  Here are the steps I followed:    ***Apply the Gentle Assurance (to the scalp if you irritated it in any way)!!!*** Then proceed with the following....    Step 1 Protecto Application:  Apply two dime sized drops into palm and rub hands together. Gently work throughout entire head of hair, especially to the new growth area.     Step 2 Creme Relaxer Application: (I used the Sensitive Scalp formula)  Apply ample amount of relaxer to thinly-parted sections of hair using an application brush or back of a rat tail comb. Begin with the back sections, working downwards from the crown area. Proceed to the front sections, working from the crown forward. Apply to the hairline areas last. Avoid applying the relaxer directly to the scalp. For retouches, apply relaxer creme to new growth only. Avoid overlapping onto previously relaxed hair. After application is complete, smooth the relaxer with the back of a rat tail comb, using thin partings and working in the same direction as during application. After desired straightening is achieved, rinse relaxer completely from hair with warm water.    Step 3 5 in 1 Reconstructor or Positive Link Application:  Affirm 5 in 1 Reconstructor if hair is fine or limp; Positive Link if hair is medium or coarse; I used the 5 in 1 Reconstructor.  Wait five minutes and rinse hair well.    Step 4 Normalizing Shampoo:  Shampoo all areas of hair and scalp. Rinse thoroughly and repeat. (Lather will turn pink if relaxer traces remain, and white when hair is completely neutralized.) Rinse until the lather turns white.     Lastly Style and Finish.  I Followed with Kera Care products. Shampoo the hair with KeraCare Hydrating Detangling Shampoo (one wash) and finally deep conditioned with KeraCare Humecto Creme Conditioner (placed a plastic processing cap on head for 30 minutes then rinsed thoroughly.  I didn&#x27;t sit under a heated dryer!      Finally style hair with KeraCare Oil Moisturizer with Jojoba Oil.  I would suggest using a small amount.      My results were marvelous and it beats paying the hairdresser $$$$.  My hair feels marvelous!</li>
    <li> This relaxer leaves my hair in a totally different, way better condition than store bought home relaxers. My hair was chronically dry and brittle, now it&#x27;s straight and healthier.Still looks fresh and super straight after 3 weeks. Unbelievable</li>
    <li> best relaxer ive ever used. absolutely love my hair</li>
    <li> I love my affirm!! At the age of 50 I have used my share of hair care products. I have tried numerous perms one&#x27;s that were not lye based and some that were, but with affirm I have always gotten great results. It does not dry out my hair, there is no breakage as I have experienced with all the others, and it smooth&#x27;s my hair. It is definitely the bomb!! I high recommend this product.</li>
    <li> This product is always on point. I have course hair and I have never had problems with this relaxer straightening my hair.</li>
    <li> I am thrilled to have found the Affirm Relaxer Kit 4 Applications at Amazon because I burn easily.  I had the Affirm relaxer used on my hair in the salon before with great results; so I decided to order this and give it a try at home.  I took my time, followed the instructions, and the results were fantastic.  I will continue to purchase this product and relax my hair at home from now on.  I hate having to sit in a salon all day, and be treated as though the stylist does not value me as a customer.  Now, I only have to visit the salon occasionally when I need a color and cut.  For those who are wondering, you will have to purchase the normalizing shampoo, and the reconstuctor (conditioner) separately.  I also purchased the gentle assurance scalp protector to apply before relaxing.</li>
    <li> As describe and good for my hair thanks!</li>
    <li> This is so good for my hair.  Not only does it leave it soft and manageable, it smells good.  I will keep ordering it.</li>
    <li> Wonderful relaxer at a great price</li>
    <li> Great product. I have used this before, The results are consistent. I use the mild. I don&#x27;t like for my hair to be too straight. The mild gives me the body and bounce I like.</li>
    <li> This product is great I started using this as a teenager in high school when my family could afford to send me to the hairdresser this was and still is the greeatest black hair care product thats on the market when I was a teenager you could not purchase this anywhere only was used by salon to maintaine i used all this other stuff, motions,paul mitchell, nexus, and  affirm relaxer and shampoo products {keracare] is the best I am in my 40s now and I used this on my daughters, nieces, grandgirls my whole family of women use this on all our hair and people that know us in the town were from think that we all have good hair. We all have nice with the help of keracare we have nappy but now its beautiful.  I purchase this from amazon now I am forever a customer if you use this the way it says u will have straight, shiny, blowing in the wind sleek hair {mazani} is my second best. the store bought relaxers are not good for achieving salon results know your hair type like with anything if not done correctly then results can be baldhead  but if you have real kinky nappy hair this is the stuff to use everything an&#x27;t for everybooody this is made for the salon look at the fraction of the price and look good everday N V ME.</li>
    <li> Thank God, I found this product..I no longer have to pay $100 plus for me and my daughters hair.  I worked in a salon so I know how to apply relaxer, trim ends, color etc.  I got the same results from my previous relaxer administrator (lol). I just saved a ton of money. The shipment arrived a day before Mothers Day..what a great gift.  I will be ordering from this company again!</li>
    <li> I actually LOVED this stuff.  This was the first time I have tried a lye relaxer, I&#x27;ve always used the boxed no-lye relaxers u get at beauty stores and always left my hair feeling nasty, super dry for a month or even more &amp; A LOT of breakage but this one was very mild, I didn&#x27;t have any scalp irritation and my hair automatically felt smooth.  I used the scalp protector, the hair protector, after the relaxer I used the 5 in 1 affirm treatment, then I washed my hair with Mizani neutralizing shampoo &amp; then conditioner.  Minimum damage for sure, I was so afraid of relaxing again because of the damage &amp; nasty feel I felt with boxed relaxers... But I loved affirm &amp; will be using it all the time from now on.</li>
    <li> Best relaxer ever! I used ORS for years and switched to Affirm a few years ago and my hair has never been healthier. Doesn&#x27;t over process and leaves hair soft and healthy. My hair is thicker and better than ever.</li>
    <li> Affirm is not very effective during the heat of summer for African American hair.  Relaxers are supposed to cover hair root growth.  After a few weeks Affirm makes all of your hair feel \\&quot;nappy\\&quot;.  I am appalled that all of the top/large salons that don&#x27;t have a large clientele who need a hair relaxer use Affirm.  Other relaxers that I have had from small beauty shops last 9 weeks while Affirm lasts about four weeks.  This is not a product I would recommend even though it is safe.  Affirm , needs to do customer interviews (not just hair stylists) to improve their product for African American hair.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent relaxer....the best in my book!</li>
    <li> The shipping was fast and product work great. I would highly recommend using the product. I looked like my hair was done by a professional</li>
    <li> I will order this perm forever! It looks like I got my hair done in the salon...plus it NEVER BURNS me while I am relaxing my hair.</li>
    <li> I REALLY LIKE THE AFFIRM RELAXER. I WOULD NOT WANT TO USE ANYTHING ELSE. THE RESULTS ARE  AMAZING. MY HAIR IS SO SHINY AND SOFT, AND IT IS ALSO HEALTHY.I GET COMPLIMENTS ON MY HAIR ON HOW PRETTY MY HAIR IS. THIS RELAXER MAKES MY HAIR GROW TOO. IT&#x27;S A LITTLE BIT ON THE EXPENSIVE SIDE BUT IT IS WELL WORTH IT. WHEN I FIRST STARTING USING THIS PRODUCT, I THOUGHT IT WAS A BIT MUCH TO DO, AS FAR AS THE STEPS, BUT ONCE YOU GET USED TO IT,IT&#x27;S A BREEZE.&lt;br /&gt;EVERYBODY&#x27;S HAIR IS DIFFERENT,SO FOR THOSE WHO ARE NOT GETTING THE RESULTS YOU EXPECT, FOLLOW THE INSTRUCTIONS TO THE T. IF YOU ARE THEN MAYBE THIS IS NOT FOR YOU. I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS RELAXER TO ANYONE. I GIVE THIS PRODUCT FIVE STARS.</li>
    <li> It was nice but I wish it came with gloves and the shampoo and conditioner to wash out the relaxer .&lt;br /&gt;Perhaps there is another kit with the complete set</li>
