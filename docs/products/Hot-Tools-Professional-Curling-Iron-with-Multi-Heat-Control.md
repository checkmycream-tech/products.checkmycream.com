<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> The packaging was what drew me to try. Disappointed in the &#x27;engenering&amp;#34;of the curling iron. Too easy to get burned.</li>
    <li> Great price, just what my daughter wanted.</li>
    <li> We have mixed feelings about this iron and did not purchase our unit from Amazon. My wife used this for many years and said she liked it best of all the curling irons she&#x27;s had.  On this one morning, she had it heating up while in an adjacent room. We smelled a synthetic burned odor. She discovered the curling iron overheated and the plastic tip was disfigured as it had melted off, leaving just the screw that holds that plastic tip in place intact.   Fortunately she had not been been curling her hair when this overheating occurred.   Since it appeared beyond saving, I disassembled it to find the reason for the failure. The electrical and mechanical construction show it is well designed. The electronics and switches did not show signs of overheating nor reveal sparks from electrical shorting. So the deduction is that the heating element which is not accessible, must have failed.  Today is December 31st and the day after I wrote the above review. My wife decided she liked the curling iron a lot and got another one by the same manufacturer. It&#x27;s identical in design but is the midi 5/8 inch size. It comes with a one-year warranty. I&#x27;ll post any follow-up that is pertinent to overheating issues.</li>
    <li> Finally--a curling iron that works!!  I just ordered my second one of this model as it works so well.  Other brands don&#x27;t heat up but this one gets plenty hot and actually curls my very fine, straight hair. Well worth the investment!</li>
    <li> I usually don&#x27;t curl my hair because it takes forever. I bought two different sizes in the Conair Satin Finish Ceramic Curling Iron line because the reviews were decent. However, it would not curl my hair. I was very disappointed. I have wavy hair that is neither thin, nor thick. I have the hardest time curling my hair and having the curls stay. I decided to buy Hot Tools after watching a YouTube review. Wow, am I ever glad I did. It heats up very quickly and curls my hair in a matter of seconds. The curls are beautiful and I am so happy with the results! I fell asleep in my curled hair, and the curls were still there in the morning. I am looking forward to buying more Hot Tools curling irons in the future!!</li>
    <li> I have used this exact brand and wanted to purchase a new one to replace my existing curling iron. I was disappointed the first time I turned it on because within 30 seconds at medium heat, the cool tip plastic bubbled and melted against the metal. Unfortunately, I&#x27;ll be returning it and buying a different one.</li>
    <li> i love hot tools products! they really work well, and they are worth the price!</li>
    <li> This curling iron is great!  It has a heat selector that help determine how hot you want it.  This is my second iron. I bought the first one over 8 years ago and it still works.  I bought the new one to take with me on trips because the old one looked so used. Also I bought this one because like so many other products, they are taken off the market and I wanted to make sure I had a backup.</li>
    <li> I purchased this curling iron at a salon.  Almost from the first use, I became aware of an obvious--horrible--design flaw:  the handle for opening the curling iron is mostly made of flexible metal, so that with repeated use, the handle bends down until you can no longer open the iron.  Each time this happens, the handle must be bent back up, which is extremely frustrating.  Obviously, after many repetitions, the handle finally breaks off.  I just duct-taped my broken handle so I don&#x27;t burn myself, and I am now looking for another brand.  Verdict: truly awful design.</li>
    <li> I have used several brands of curling irons and found the &#x27;gold colored&#x27; one does the best job.  I&#x27;ve tried the &#x27;silver ones and the ceramic ones and they don&#x27;t do squat.  I won one of these at a women&#x27;s luncheon a few years ago but it shorted out the beginning of this year.  I went to Ulta and they were in the high $30s and low $40s.  I was exstatic to find a Hot Tool for less than $20.</li>
    <li> I like that I can select an exact temperature for my hair type.  The cord is really long, great for using in hotel room when someone else is in the bathroom.  The cool tip is not as large as my last curling iron, but long enough.  Handle is easy to hold.  So far, I have found nothing to complain about.  It does come with 2 extra springs for the handle, which is where all my previous irons have broken.  Hoping I won&#x27;t need to use them anytime soon, but I appreciate having them handy.</li>
    <li> Just like the one at the local salon but a quarter the price.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this curling iron for about 10 years and it finally gave out. I think that it happened when I was using a voltage converter in Israel, so it wasn&#x27;t due to a malfunction of the iron, even then. So, I ordered this one just like it from Amazon. I hope it lasts as well as the previous one. It has a dial to increase the temperature of the heat, and can get very hot, if you set it for that. It heats up in a minute or less.</li>
    <li> I am so happy with the Hot Tools curling iron that I now have purchased several sizes.  It is the best I&#x27;ve ever used!  Heat settings go from 1 (low) to 10 (hot.)  This iron does run hot - I have fine hair and use heat setting 3.  As with any curling iron, you should start with the coolest setting and work your way up to the one that works for you - never start with the hot settings, and remember that it heats almost instantly, so don&#x27;t be touching it with your finger to see if it is hot yet.  One thing I love about it is that once the heat setting is selected, it doesn&#x27;t change unless I want it to.  The on/off switch is on the opposite side of the handle, so there isn&#x27;t any easy way to accidentally change the heat selection.  The handle is slim and very comfortable to grip. The cord never tangles.  I bought my first Hot Tools curling iron several years ago and it still looks and works like new.  I&#x27;ve used curling irons for many years, and this is far superior to any of the others I&#x27;ve owned.    ADDENDUM: After almost daily use, my 4+year-old curling iron is just beginning to be intermittent.  Not dead yet, but I&#x27;ve ordered another so I won&#x27;t be without when it goes. Not a bad lifetime for a curling iron and it is still the best I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love that this curling iron has adjustable heat. Also, the swivel base is great and works very well. The cord does not get tangled like my previous iron. One thing that does annoy me about this iron is the power switch. It is not a standard on/off switch. It seems like it could accidentally be turned off during use. The power switch is a sliding button on the side of the handle area. Otherwise, this unit works great and I will probably order another one should the need arise. (Maybe even the larger size!)</li>
    <li> Love it! Heats fast. Does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to.</li>
    <li> I CAN NEVER GO BACK.  THIS IRON IS amazing.  My hair now holds curl all day long.  Only wish it was gentler on my hair, but its the price I pay for beautiful hair.  The purple one I use to have chipped so it needs to have a good coating.</li>
    <li> I love the curling capabilities and the rapid heat up time.  However I am disappointed in the cord itself.  It seems very light weight.  I had purchased another Hot Tools curling iron approximately 8 or 9 years ago and the cord on it is very thick and heavy duty..  My old one still works but the spring on it broke.  So over all if this new one is as good as the previous one I will be very satisfied</li>
    <li> [[VIDEOID:moOT2YGHAD0V73]]I received this hair iron yesterday and use in the yesterday evening, guess what..it burn my hair right off.  I feel so upset about it.  http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00176GSAM/ref&#x3D;cm_cr_rev_prod_title</li>
    <li> Love my new curling iron. I now have 3 sizes of this same brand. Great price on them,too!!</li>
    <li> The product works good with multiple heat setting, one missing feature is the automatic turn off.</li>
    <li> This iron gets hot really fast and curls beautifully. I only wish that it had an automatic off mechanism.  I have left this iron on several times for several hours.</li>
    <li> Love this curling iron.  This is my second one.  I lost my first one on a trip.</li>
    <li> First, I meant to order the 1\\&quot; curling iron so I&#x27;m going to give you the approximate circumference of the 3/4\\&quot; one which is 2 7/8\\&quot;.  When I hold the measuring tape up next to the barrel it measures 3/4\\&quot;.  My hairdresser cut my layers a tad too short last time so my mistake worked in my favor. I&#x27;d be burning myself quite often if I was using the 1\\&quot; size.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a 1\\&quot; Hot Tool curing iron, just like this one, that I&#x27;ve been using for over 6 years. My husband replaced the plug once because I had to keep wiggling the cord &amp; plug to get everything in the proper place for the curling iron to stay on. Recently I began having problems with the cord again, but this time it&#x27;s where the cord attaches to the handle &amp; that is why I was ordering another curling iron. This new design is supposed to prevent that problem...only time will tell. I will update my review if necessary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These irons come with two extra springs...I didn&#x27;t have to use the extra springs with my old one, but I&#x27;m very happy the extras are included. (We&#x27;ve had to replace the springs in other curling irons I&#x27;ve owned through the years. It was never easy to find a replacement spring). The temperature settings/numbers eventually wore off of my old one &amp; I&#x27;m expecting this one to do the same because they&#x27;re applied in the same manner. I have a favorite setting.  I marked my old one with a silver permanent marker so I&#x27;d know which setting to use. Although these curling irons get very, very hot I do not &amp; will not use the higher settings. For goodness sakes, my hair isn&#x27;t made from asbestos. FYI: My hairdresser recently burned a section of my hair off when her curling iron was set too hot. Thankfully, it was in a hidden spot, I don&#x27;t have long layers, and I was able to cover the burned off hair until it grew back. Anyway, let that be a warning to you...it can happen. I&#x27;ve used curling irons for years &amp; years &amp; years &amp; that was a first for me &amp; my hairdresser.  I use the #7 temperature. It&#x27;s the first setting on the &#x27;Extra Hot&#x27; category. My baby fine hair is extremely hard to curl. If this curling iron lives up to its predecessor, I can expect many more useful years out of it.  And, soon, I will be placing an order for the 1\\&quot; size.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great curling iron!the &#x27;Extra Hot&#x27; category. My baby fine hair is extremely hard to curl. If this curling iron lives up to its predecessor, I can expect many more useful years out of it.  And, soon, I will be placing an order for the 1\\&quot; size.    Great curling iron!</li>
    <li> He was very cool and has used more than once and liked it a lot   But I need to training on different types of hairstyles to be skilled in the use of</li>
    <li> My wife loves this tool.  She uses it weekly and sometimes more often. She bought her first one from the local hair stylist but found this vendor to be a better price than the one from the stylist.</li>
    <li> As others have said, this thing really does get Hot, and I have the burn marks on my forehead to prove it.  One quickly learns to turn down the setting!  What I miss though, is an automatic turnoff.  I like the peace of mind of knowing something that hot is not on all day with a cat in the house.  My last several curling irons had it, it never occurred to me they&#x27;re still making them without.</li>
    <li> This is my go to brand for iron curlers!  Heats up very fast and my curls last practically for days!  Very light and easy to use as well.  This is a very trusty, handy brand :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have short hair and the 3/4&amp;#34; was the perfect size for my.  I can now style it even more.</li>
    <li> The on-light is not very distinguishable from when the appliance is off.</li>
    <li> just as good as the old one</li>
    <li> Very pleased with the prompt delivery. Very liable and durable curling iron.</li>
    <li> This my second one that I purchased the first lasest 5 years. Good Product.</li>
    <li> The indicator light is very dim, so it&#x27;s hard to tell when it&#x27;s turned on.  Otherwise a great product.  I use it on the lowest setting and it works well.</li>
    <li> Use it all the time. Heats up fast and doesn&#x27;t burn my hair. good price too.</li>
    <li> I have never been able to put a curl in my hair right after it&#x27;s shampooed. My hair just slips off the iron &amp; won&#x27;t take a curl. My hair stylist never seemed to have a problem so I asked her about it. She recommended this iron. Right after my hair was washed &amp; dried yesterday I used some spray gel &amp; this iron. I was amazed! It did a beautiful job and took no time at all. I still have some curl &amp; body in my hair today even after it&#x27;s been slept on. I couldn&#x27;t be happier with this curling iron.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a curling iron and knew from past experience Amazon would have the item I needed and it would be perfect. Exactly as advertised.  Product is easy to handle and has features for advanced settings.  I am very satisfied with the Hot Tool product and wouldn&#x27;t hesistate to recommend. Great product saisfaction.</li>
    <li> This is the best curling iron I have used, ever.  I loved my old curling iron, but this one has a much longer cord and a swivel end so that the cord doesn&#x27;t tangle/curl up.I keep the setting on low (as everyone mentioned, it&#x27;s very hot) and have not had any problem with burning my hair.  Great value.</li>
    <li> I LOVE my new curling iron. It&#x27;s the perfect size for my short hair. It heats up fast and stays super hot. I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> the best curling iron ever!</li>
    <li> Used my curling iron for the first time this morning! Totally wonderful product! Heats quickly, which is a must when in a hurry for work! :)</li>
    <li> works well and has temp control</li>
    <li> I love this curling iron, it really does a great job curling my hair.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t use it more than a couple times a week. Loved it but it just died. It lasted an estimated 200 uses before the cord crapped out.</li>
    <li> I have has this curler for about a year and have used it on my hair, my sister&#x27;s hair and my mom&#x27;s hair. All three of use have thick hair naturally, but my mom and I have our hair treated. Today I used my curler to try to recurl a piece of my hair and the curler melted my hair right off! It&#x27;s not even because I had the curler at full heat (I had the curler at about 380-400 and the max is 430). The curler produces good results but I&#x27;m scared to use it again.</li>
    <li> Have always used this brand and was amazed at how low Amazon&#x27;s price was.</li>
    <li> LOVE IT! I have thick hair down my shoulder blade area and this was a great size for tighter curls.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my mother after visiting her house &amp; seeing that hers was taped up. She really loves it.</li>
    <li> love these products!  great price on Amazon, even better than what my stylist pays with her discount!</li>
    <li> This brand of curling iron is the only one I&#x27;ve found that gets hot enough to curl your hair properly.  Be careful you don&#x27;t touch your bare skin with it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had the same model for about 7 years and it worked great.  The only reason I had to replace it was because I dropped it and broke the plastic tip.</li>
    <li> I LOVE the curling iron. I heats quickly and works great. The cord bends easily and that is a nice feature. Would recommend this to everyone...</li>
    <li> I really like this curling iron.  At the medium setting my hair is curling well and the curls hold.</li>
    <li> My hair would never stay curled for more than 20 minutes even if I used a pound of hairspray, but with this I don&#x27;t even have to use hairspray to keep my curls all day long. I use this personally and professionally, and it has never let me down! I love hot tools!</li>
    <li> GREAT to deal with.  He even took the time to make a phone call to me.    Definately 5-star.  I would buy from him again in a minute.</li>
    <li> I purchased this curling iron back in the very beginning of October of 2013.  The reason I waited so long to write this review is because, even though I have been extremely pleased at how well this curling iron works on my thin, baby-fine hair, something happened this morning that really worried me and also made me upset. I have very, very light blonde hair (colored), which I use Fekkai hair products on. This morning I put on my usual spray on argan oil and spray gel prior to curling my hair. I got all the way through to the fourth curl from being finished. Suddenly I saw a tiny puff of smoke! I thought, well, it might have just gotten some extra product on the iron. So I went ahead and continued curling with it - and then I noticed that my hair had turned a dark orange-brown on the ends I had just curled!!!!!! I immediately checked the thermostat setting and it was at my usual 380 degrees, which I have used forever without problems. Finally, on the next curl, my hair burned almost as soon as I touched it with the iron. So, obviously, we have an issue here. I now have burned hair on one side of my head towards the ends, It looks AWFUL. So I&#x27;m going to have to go have the burned parts cut off, which will necessitate changing my hairstyle just prior to going on vacation. A word of wisdom: if you EVER see smoke, even just a wisp, coming from your hair, turn that curling iron off and don&#x27;t let it touch your hair again! I&#x27;m not blaming the manufacturer - I used it for a year and a half without issues - but when you&#x27;re dealing with a product that gets this hot, there is lots of potential for major hair damage.</li>
    <li> my daughter&#x27;s impossible-to-curl hair actually curled using this curling iron! i&#x27;m sold!</li>
    <li> Not sure why it took me so long to upgrade to this from a cheap iron that took forever to heat up with a tangled knotty cord. This heats up really fast and the swivel cord is perfect. Recommend!</li>
    <li> I have very strait hair that never holds curls.  I take all the time to curl and it falls out in an hour.  This curling iron curled perfectly and the curls held all night with no product.  It is amazing!</li>
    <li> Great curling iron that heats very fast. The medium setting works best.  This is what professional stylists use. I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Good tools and it got pretty hot</li>
    <li> My last Hot Tools iron lasted 15 years.  They are great irons.  I have owned many different irons over the years but Hot Tools is always my favorite that I would buy over and over.</li>
    <li> Great tool. I like the quickness of heating and cord manuverability.</li>
    <li> I set this iron to the LOWEST setting and it burnt a section of my hair off. I have professionally color treated and cut, medium thick, normal hair about shoulder length. I round brush, curl, and straighten my hair all the time, so I am no stranger to styling tools. I twisted a 1 inch section around for a few seconds and when I unrolled the iron, most of that section of hair was burnt onto the iron. Now I have a section of hair that is only a few inches long on my head, luckily it is underneath the rest of my hair so it is less conspicuous. I also noticed that the plastic cap had started to melt, too. The iron had started to smoke a tiny bit before I began to curl, but the directions specifically said this was normal for the first use because of oil on the iron.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I saw the other review with a video of this after it happened and thought that person must have gotten a bad iron or didn&#x27;t know how it worked or even had something weird in her hair. Then I was very careful to use the iron correctly and it happened to me in the exact same manner. I will not buy another Hot Tools Product. I do not understand how anyone can use this iron. It gets way too hot even on the lowest setting.</li>
    <li> Gets very hot fast. nice product. well worth the money.</li>
    <li> I am loving the Hot Tools brand for curling irons. Specifically the gold plated ones.    This 3/4 does tighter curls. I&#x27;d recommend this for shorter hair. For shoulder-length or slightly past shoulders I&#x27;d recommend the 1\\&quot;. I find myself using the 1\\&quot; a lot more for my shoulder length hair. However, I like having both sizes to do different styles and for when my hair is much shorter.</li>
    <li> It does curl my hair, but it&#x27;s not ceramic, I used low heat but it still fries my hair...</li>
    <li> I love this curling iron. When I dropped my previous one on my stone floor I wasn&#x27;t looking forward to paying $40 at the store for a new one but seeing I could get it for nearly half the price at Amazon was awesome. Works great.</li>
    <li> I purchased this in January and it has already quit working.  Hot tools Professiona Curling Iron.  I gave it a 4 because I did like it but it quit way too soon.</li>
    <li> Curling Iron works great!</li>
    <li> Love this iron. Stays hot after an hour of curling my hair. Very durable and the cord doesn&#x27;t get all wound up and annoying, it actually keeps itself pretty straight.</li>
    <li> I bought this one cause I knew what it did ----how fast it  heated up---and nice feel to the hand-- easily controlled.  It was just what I wanted.</li>
    <li> use this product every day.</li>
    <li> Pretty cool curling iron. Good quality.&lt;br /&gt;I bought it because it was recommended by the Glamourai&#x27;s blogger, and I do not regret my purchase!</li>
    <li> Love it! Very smooth...doesn&#x27;t snag your hair. Heats up quickly. The on/off switch is not in your way.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this brand for years and it beats the regular store bought curling irons by far. It has higher heat settings  than other curling irons so it holds the curl longer. It also lasts much longer (I used my previous Hot Tools iron daily and it lasted for about 5 years). One suggestion...if you have medium length hair, you might want to purchase the 1\\&quot; rather than the 3/4\\&quot; iron.</li>
    <li> Bought this as a gift for my grandmother. It is lightweight so it doesn&#x27;t strain her arm and she says it curls good. I was very happy to be able to get it on here for almost half the price it is at my local Ulta.</li>
    <li> This curling iron works really well.  It doesn&#x27;t take too long to heat up and it will curl my hair quickly.  I have thick hair so was concerned about how effective the curling iron would be bit it works great!</li>
    <li> I was first introduced to Hot Tools Curling Irons by my beautician many years ago.  Since then, it&#x27;s the only brand I&#x27;ll use. I need a hotter setting than most commercial irons provide so the ability to set the temperature is the #1 feature I like. Other great features are the long barrel, the comfortable handle, and the tool&#x27;s overall balance and feel. The spring-lever clamps down tighter on the barrel than most curling irons which gives more defined curls. I&#x27;ve only had one of these irons quit working and that was after approximately 15 years of daily use. The springs do tend to break after 5 or 6 years of daily use, however, spring-replacement directions and two free springs are furnished with each new iron.  The difference between this curling iron and the ones featured in drug stores and big box stores is like night and day.  I attribute the many compliments I receive on my hairdo to this one product.  One caveat: On the high heat settings the iron will leave a burn if it touches any bare skin. So start out very carefully if you decide to use the high settings...or practice on lower settings until you&#x27;re comfortable using it.</li>
    <li> My first curling iron and I think it&#x27;s great.  So happy with my purchase. Heats quickly too.</li>
    <li> I love Hot Tools Professional Curling Irons and this is the third one that I now own.  I recently needed to get a smaller barrel curling iron, so I was very happy that this curling iron was available.</li>
    <li> Ordered for my mom and she loves it.</li>
    <li> Best curling iron ever!  I used to buy the 10.00 curling irons, and my best friend is a hair dresser and recommended this one.  I use it on my daughters hair, one has really fine hair and no other curling iron would curl her hair.  My other daughter has wavy thicker hair and works wonders to bring out the curls in her hair.</li>
    <li> I have used this curling iron for years.  I was so happy to find it on Amazon.  The size is good for short hair.  It heats up fast and is very easy to use.</li>
    <li> Wish it had auto shut off like my last iron. Otherwise, seems fine.</li>
    <li> I have use Hot Tools Professional Curling Iron before and I have always found it to be quite good.</li>
    <li> i had no idea what a difference a style of curling iron would make. I actually just recently bought one at a big box store that drove me crazy...I kept hitting the button and turning it off every time I used it. It also didn&#x27;t seem hot enough.&lt;br /&gt;After seeing all of the great reviews, I decided to try this one....only $5.00 more than my other new piece of junk.&lt;br /&gt;Everything everyone is raving about is true. My favorite things about it are....I don&#x27;t keep hitting the off bottom.....the soft grip handle is amazing...equally amazing is the cord that flows with your movements. It gets hot enough, and it is looks like professional craftsmanship.&lt;br /&gt;So glad I purchased it.</li>
    <li> My hair dresser recommended this brand to me.  I absolutely love it.  My curls hold longer and it heats up very fast.</li>
    <li> I have not used the new one yet...but it is the same style I have been using for years...and I love it! thanks</li>
    <li> heats up quick and is half the price on amazon vs ulta!</li>
    <li> Everything it said it would be!</li>
    <li> wife loves it, had one for several years and this was an exact replacement, fast ship and works great.</li>
