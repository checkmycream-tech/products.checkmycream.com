      <li>This is truly a wonderful cream for use on irritated skin or to use as a lip gloss.  </li>
      <li>Best for chapped lips and skin.</li>
      <li>It’s the best cream around for helping all kinds of skin problems.</li>
      <li>I read reviews on this product that weren&#x27;t very good, but I like this product.  </li>

      <li>Works great.</li>
      <li>It is good for putting on sunburns and preventing blistering.  </li>
      <li>I love this product!  </li>
      <li>Love it!  </li>
      <li>And I love the scent!</li>
      <li>Heals every kind of scratch in no time.&lt;br</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s works as  a good cream for around the eyes, and if you use if very, very sparingly it&#x27;s good on the face as well....</li>
      <li>It is a lovely spa treatment and</li>
      <li>Mom my wanted this product and spoke about it many times.  </li>
      <li>I absolutely LOVE the Intensive Body Cream--and if you do not like the way the baum feels on your skin, do try that one</li>
      <li>I love this product.  </li>
      <li>it has many uses.</li>
      <li>everyone was right, this stuff is good, but</li>
      <li>Of all the dry skin products on the market, Elizabeth Arden&#x27;s Eight Hour Cream is the best.</li>
      <li>And incidentally, it glides on your skin MUCH better if you also use any of the Elizabeth Arden Ceramide Capsule products first on clean and toned skin,, another luxury that is so worth the price after you see the amazing results in a week or two...</li>
      <li>--it is much more of a super rich cream.</li>
      <li>I put it on my chapped lips and overnight there was a huge difference.  </li>
      <li>even my Grandmother used this to maintain smooth elbows, lips and cuticles.  </li>
      <li>I agree this cream has a medicinal odor, BUT, if you have a burn (sunburn, cooking burns) it is fantastic.  </li>
      <li>, so I am pretty sure I&#x27;m not allergic.  </li>
      <li>I had read so many good reviews on it and had a number of people recommend it to me as I have very dry skin.  </li>
      <li>I finally gave in and ordered some, and loved the packaging and the color of the product--but was turned off by the smell.</li>
      <li>This is by far the best cream for dry cracked skin and cuticles.  </li>
      <li>It is a classic, made first in Elizabeth Arden&#x27;s own kitchen spa.</li>
      <li>Love the red jar, too :)</li>
      <li>It is also good for dry and chapped skin.  </li>
      <li>well worth the price.</li>
      <li>It is very greasy, does not dissolve very fast in the skin and it has a strong medicine smell.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve never had a problem with chapped lips since I discovered it, but it&#x27;s also a good all-around salve for cuts, rough spots, scrapes, etc.  </li>
      <li>alot like vaseline, but NOT really as it works extrememly well, more so than the v-stuff!  </li>
      <li>but I have not been able to find a larger size in years.</li>
      <li>When I regularly use Eight Hour Cream, my hands heal very quickly.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used this magic formula for years for all kinds of scratches, dry cuticles and anything else that needs healing!</li>
      <li>This product is very versatile</li>
      <li>I really, really, really wanted to like this product.  </li>
      <li>This cream was available in a larger jar</li>
      <li>and this product really helps a lot.  </li>
      <li>It keeps my hand really moist as well as my lips.  </li>
      <li>However, it is very greasy</li>
      <li>Tried it on my cuticles--still too much.  </li>
      <li>I have never broken out in a rash or had any sort of reaction on my skin while using it</li>
      <li>The main use has been for chapped lips.</li>
      <li>Would highly recommend it.</li>
      <li>She has been really pleased with the results and said we should stock-pile the little jars in case \\&quot;they\\&quot; stop making it.</li>
      <li>right now my knuckles and cuticle area are starting to itch and crack</li>
      <li>I usually do not like paying alot for these types of products, but this works so well that it&#x27;s worth the extra price.  </li>
      <li>don&#x27;t want to live without it.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using the Eight-Hour Cream for more than 20 years, and plan to keep on using it for at least another 20.  </li>
      <li>I have never been overly sensitive to smells except in this case.  </li>
      <li>I’m 69 years old.  </li>
      <li>I had read she had this salve developed for her horses split hoofs and it worked.</li>
      <li>It is NOT medicine-ish, it IS a clean herbal reminiscent of lavender and lemon verbena (not what passes for &amp;#34;herbal&amp;#34; today that smells like sour apple candy!)</li>
      <li>Apparently it is a wonder product and miracle cure.  </li>
      <li>I have used this product as far back as I can remember.</li>
      <li>Works well for dry skin anywhere, I would highly recommend this to anyone.</li>
      <li>The formula has not changed but there have been new products added in the line using the same basic formula.</li>

<li> Works well for dry skin anywhere, I would highly recommend this to anyone.</li>
<li> The formula has not changed but there have been new products added in the line using the same basic formula.</li>
<li> If you truly have dry skin and need to use this product you will not be left with a greasy shiny face.</li>
<li> especially in the winter when your skin tends to get very dry.</li>
<li> My hands are very dry and chapped, to the point that the skin splits open.</li>
<li> It’s been around as long as I have</li>
<li> In a matter of a few days I had soft lips again.  </li>
<li> It works on radiation burns from chemo therapy, sun burn and smell of product not loud.</li>
<li> I bought this cream because it had such great reviews, but I have been very disappointed with it.</li>
<li> I have extremely dry skin in the Winter time and</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve been using it on the dry spots on my hands and on my face not just my lips.  </li>
<li> This helps my dry cracked lips and the heels of my feet and elbows.  </li>
<li> I have also used it for dry patches on my face.  </li>
<li> It is not a good \\&quot;face cream\\&quot; as it is too greasy but it really soothes and restores irritated skin.</li>
<li> I suggest you use a wooden popsicle stick and take a small amount out of the jar--about the size of small bean and let it melt in the palm of your hand and then dab it with your fingertips on the problem areas of your face, not pulling the skin but gently smoothing it in.</li>
<li> I have very dry skin</li>
<li> I am really angry - this is an absolute rip off!!</li>
<li> very little jar, but you only need a dab.</li>
<li> While I could feel my lips being moisturized like no other, I was also tearing up so badly that I couldn&#x27;t see--and I didn&#x27;t even put that much on!  </li>
<li> I also used it on my children when they were little when they had diaper rash.</li>
<li> I like to add a little dab around my eyes at night.  </li>
<li> I put a little on my eyelid and it makes my eyes look brighter and softer.</li>
<li> It was pretty bad.  </li>
<li> /&gt;A little miracle jar!</li>
<li> I hope this product is never changed or modified because it would never have the benefits that it does now and has provided for years in the past.</li>
<li> I have been using this on my feet for my cracked heels and covering them with thick socks after a shower and it has been fantastic--but I have to wash it off before I go to sleep or the bed smells like this</li>
<li> It doesn&#x27;t smell bad, just extremely medicinal, and having it anywhere on my face where I could smell it made my eyes water.  </li>
<li> During the drought in the Midwest this year I had really bad chapped lips.  </li>
<li> I don&#x27;t think it smells bad because I don&#x27;t think it has an odor.  </li>
<li> But for those who are disappointed in it--you have to know what you are getting!</li>

    <li> Excellent - have been looking for it for years!!!</li>
    <li> Please do not buy this product - it is just OVERPRICED PETROLEUM JELLY!! I am really angry - this is an absolute rip off!!</li>
    <li> Heals every kind of scratch in no time.&lt;br /&gt;A little miracle jar!</li>
    <li> everyone was right, this stuff is good, but oh so smelly! alot like vaseline, but NOT really as it works extrememly well, more so than the v-stuff!  very little jar, but you only need a dab.</li>
    <li> don&#x27;t want to live without it. literally. it&#x27;s not to use for everything but as a healing balm of sorts, it is unlike anything else.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this magic formula for years for all kinds of scratches, dry cuticles and anything else that needs healing!</li>
    <li> Mom my wanted this product and spoke about it many times.  I remember growing up even my Grandmother used this to maintain smooth elbows, lips and cuticles.  Apparently it is a wonder product and miracle cure.  As soon as my Mom opened the box I purchased for Christmas, her face lit up with surprise as she didn&#x27;t think it was manufactured any longer.  She has been really pleased with the results and said we should stock-pile the little jars in case \\&quot;they\\&quot; stop making it.</li>
    <li> I love this product!  It is good for putting on sunburns and preventing blistering.  It also helps remove the pain. It is also good for dry and chapped skin.  I started using it after my daughter told me about it.  Now I have my daugher-in-law and her mother using it, too.  Great stuff!</li>
    <li> I have rated this product before and I stand by rating now. This product is very versatile it has many uses. I just wish I could get it in a larger jar.</li>
    <li> I read reviews on this product that weren&#x27;t very good, but I like this product.  It&#x27;s works as  a good cream for around the eyes, and if you use if very, very sparingly it&#x27;s good on the face as well....especially in the winter when your skin tends to get very dry.</li>
    <li> I usually do not like paying alot for these types of products, but this works so well that it&#x27;s worth the extra price.  It keeps my hand really moist as well as my lips.  I don&#x27;t think it smells bad because I don&#x27;t think it has an odor.  Would highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Best for chapped lips and skin. Took my awhile to get used to the smell.</li>
    <li> Excellent product, works great.  I&#x27;ve been using it on the dry spots on my hands and on my face not just my lips.  I have extremely dry skin in the Winter time and right now my knuckles and cuticle area are starting to itch and crack, this is stopping that from happening.  I&#x27;ve even been using it underneath my eyes at night.  Works great.</li>
    <li> This is truly a wonderful cream for use on irritated skin or to use as a lip gloss.  During the drought in the Midwest this year I had really bad chapped lips.  They were splitting and cracking.  It was pretty bad.  No amount of chapstick was helping.  I read about this product in the Parisian Chic Style Guide and decided to give it a try.  I put it on my chapped lips and overnight there was a huge difference.  In a matter of a few days I had soft lips again.  I have also used it for dry patches on my face.  It is not a good \\&quot;face cream\\&quot; as it is too greasy but it really soothes and restores irritated skin.</li>
    <li> Love it!  Love the red jar, too :)</li>
    <li> I really, really, really wanted to like this product.  I had read so many good reviews on it and had a number of people recommend it to me as I have very dry skin.  I finally gave in and ordered some, and loved the packaging and the color of the product--but was turned off by the smell. It doesn&#x27;t smell bad, just extremely medicinal, and having it anywhere on my face where I could smell it made my eyes water.  I put some on my bottom lip just to try it--bad idea!  While I could feel my lips being moisturized like no other, I was also tearing up so badly that I couldn&#x27;t see--and I didn&#x27;t even put that much on!  I put some on my hands but had to wash it off because of the smell.  Tried it on my cuticles--still too much.  I have never been overly sensitive to smells except in this case.  I have never broken out in a rash or had any sort of reaction on my skin while using it, so I am pretty sure I&#x27;m not allergic.  I have been using this on my feet for my cracked heels and covering them with thick socks after a shower and it has been fantastic--but I have to wash it off before I go to sleep or the bed smells like this stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this to a friend based on the smell and definitely wouldn&#x27;t repurchase.  I only gave it two stars because the packaging was neat and it has worked on my cracked heels.</li>
    <li> This is a beauty regimen basic and something everyone should have in their makeup kit or medicine cabinet! But for those who are disappointed in it--you have to know what you are getting! It is not a &amp;#34;cream&amp;#34; like the lotions you can find with a pump in any drugstore market. It is a &amp;#34;baume&amp;#34; a baum--this is a totally different texture. If you truly have dry skin and need to use this product you will not be left with a greasy shiny face. Not everyone needs the level of healing moisturizer this product affords. It is a classic, made first in Elizabeth Arden&#x27;s own kitchen spa. The formula has not changed but there have been new products added in the line using the same basic formula. I absolutely LOVE the Intensive Body Cream--and if you do not like the way the baum feels on your skin, do try that one--it is much more of a super rich cream. And I love the scent! It is NOT medicine-ish, it IS a clean herbal reminiscent of lavender and lemon verbena (not what passes for &amp;#34;herbal&amp;#34; today that smells like sour apple candy!) It is a lovely spa treatment and well worth the price. I suggest you use a wooden popsicle stick and take a small amount out of the jar--about the size of small bean and let it melt in the palm of your hand and then dab it with your fingertips on the problem areas of your face, not pulling the skin but gently smoothing it in. Take a couple of minutes to do this, it is a spa product after all. And incidentally, it glides on your skin MUCH better if you also use any of the Elizabeth Arden Ceramide Capsule products first on clean and toned skin,, another luxury that is so worth the price after you see the amazing results in a week or two...</li>
    <li> I have used this product as far back as I can remember. The main use has been for chapped lips. Put it on before bedtime and when you wake up your lips are healed. I also used it on my children when they were little when they had diaper rash. My oldest daughter at one time had a severe case of diaper rash and the doctor had given me a prescription for some cream which did not work at all. So, as a last ditch effort, I used the 8 Hour Cream. It was totally cleared up in just a couple days. I recommend this to anyone.</li>
    <li> I agree this cream has a medicinal odor, BUT, if you have a burn (sunburn, cooking burns) it is fantastic.  My husband is a believer ever since he suffered a sunburn to his face and head! Works well for dry skin anywhere, I would highly recommend this to anyone.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Eight-Hour Cream for more than 20 years, and plan to keep on using it for at least another 20.  I&#x27;ve never had a problem with chapped lips since I discovered it, but it&#x27;s also a good all-around salve for cuts, rough spots, scrapes, etc.  It&#x27;s the WD-40 of beauty tools!  Doesn&#x27;t have an overpowering scent, and one tube lasts a lot longer than you&#x27;d think.</li>
    <li> This is by far the best cream for dry cracked skin and cuticles.  It works on radiation burns from chemo therapy, sun burn and smell of product not loud.</li>
    <li> Of all the dry skin products on the market, Elizabeth Arden&#x27;s Eight Hour Cream is the best. I had read she had this salve developed for her horses split hoofs and it worked. My hands are very dry and chapped, to the point that the skin splits open. When I regularly use Eight Hour Cream, my hands heal very quickly. This cream was available in a larger jar but I have not been able to find a larger size in years. I hope this product is never changed or modified because it would never have the benefits that it does now and has provided for years in the past. I only wish it was packaged in a larger jar again.</li>
    <li> I love this product.  It’s been around as long as I have (maybe) I’m 69 years old.  This helps my dry cracked lips and the heels of my feet and elbows.  I have very dry skin and this product really helps a lot.  I like to add a little dab around my eyes at night.  And during the day when I put my mascara on (which is all I use on my eyes) I put a little on my eyelid and it makes my eyes look brighter and softer. You need just a tiny bit with a  Q-tip.  It’s the best cream around for helping all kinds of skin problems.</li>
    <li> I bought this cream because it had such great reviews, but I have been very disappointed with it. It is very greasy, does not dissolve very fast in the skin and it has a strong medicine smell. I wouldn&#x27;t purchase it again and I still have a bunch left.</li>
    <li> I used this after a needling treatment and my skin felt and looked all healed literally overnight.  However, it is very greasy so plan to shampoo and wash your pillowcase if you use it overnight.</li>
