      <li>I love this soap.</li>
      <li>This soap is great for people with skin conditions or just real sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>doesnt lather or clean!</li>
      <li>/&gt;Though the product was great when it finally arrived.</li>
      <li>Is TRULY free of chemicals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>bought from this seller in the past and it is perfect.</li>
      <li>notice a 1 star review and its comments says the original formula has been changed; there are chemicals.</li>
      <li>I am staying with this seller; they are honest, sell the original clear soap; no itching, no stinging skin.</li>
      <li>I used special liquid face soap for years because a skin specialist said I had to</li>
      <li>Love the idea of glycerine soap as I am very sensitive to fragrances and chemicals.  </li>
      <li>Great present for the chemically, fragrance sensitive folks in your life!</li>
      <li>have to have no scent in anything and not harsh soap works wonderfully for me use everyday</li>
      <li>I have problems with scents and this is very clean and clear with no aroma.</li>
      <li>I like that there are not additives and no fake scents.  </li>
      <li>now my face  too is baby soft and smooth.</li>
      <li>but I want to be sure my body has only pure glycerin on it.</li>
      <li>I was looking for a more natural soap for my sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>This is the true, clear color product.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>One says this true old formula is being sold out.</li>
      <li>It leaves me feeling clean and refreshed without irritation, and lasted for awhile even with daily use.</li>
      <li>For other soaps, a person has to use lots of water to rinse or there&#x27;s a slimy feel; this rinses clean right away.</li>
      <li>I had been using Clearly Natural on all my other skin and it has always been baby soft; but my face was getting more and more rough.  </li>
      <li>Highly recommend it to others</li>
      <li>Really clear with no loud scents, gentle suds and rinses cleanly.  </li>
      <li>So far this seller I am doing this review for has sent the exact product as pictured; clear color, no chemicals, no &#x27;hidden&#x27; chemicals, ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I live in Southern California and this soap rinses off better than any other one I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
      <li>That said this product doesn&#x27;t sud very well (probably due to the lack of additives) which makes it kind of annoying to apply, and there are other high glycerin specialty soaps which would probably be more effective.</li>
      <li>Wow!</li>
      <li>always ask for the clear product before buying.</li>
      <li>/&gt;However, on Amazon the ingredients listed are:&lt;br /&gt;Glycerine (derived from Palm), Palm Stearic Acid, Palm Oleic Acid, Sodium MyrethSulfate (alcohol derived from corn), Sodium Hydroxide, Purified Water, AloeVera, Natural Fragrance Essence.</li>
      <li>But this still does the job very well and for only four dollars</li>
      <li>I buy her several bars every year to last the whole year through.</li>
      <li>I ordered this as a remedy for sensitive areas because generic brand &amp;#34;sensitive skin&amp;#34; soaps were not working.</li>

<li> I buy her several bars every year to last the whole year through.</li>
<li> I ordered this as a remedy for sensitive areas because generic brand &amp;#34;sensitive skin&amp;#34; soaps were not working.</li>
<li> I should also mention there was only about an inch of tape on each cap to keep them closed and the tape was no longer stuck to these</li>
<li> It last alot longer than other glycerine type soaps</li>
<li> This one made my skin sooo dry</li>
<li> or my skin would be dry.  </li>
<li> To make it worse, the bottles had been packed into a box that was JUST big enough to fit them therefore despite the handful of packing peanuts, the caps on both bottles were broken and leaking.</li>
<li> The glycerine soap calmed my dry skin like nothing else I&#x27;ve ever tried!</li>
<li> I don&#x27;t mind if a soap only has a little suds, but this one had none.</li>
<li> As I was only expecting these bars at the time I was baffled as to why the box was so heavy.</li>
<li> I might bring my soap to a lab to find out if it has any other ingredients or evasive list.</li>
<li> It doesn&#x27;t lather much, as other people had mentioned, but it is just as affective as the other soaps I use that do.  </li>
<li> See my video review for that other</li>
<li> On the 11th my husband brought in a quite heavy package.</li>
<li> That&#x27;s because glycerin softens hair and also leaves a slick protective layer on the skin.</li>
<li> And it doesn&#x27;t leave soap scum buildup in my soap dish or on my shower walls.</li>
<li> I finally revived a badly damaged box containing the correct products and the return label.&lt;br</li>
<li> It hardly lathers and it has this weird glassy appearance.</li>
<li> The packing slip even stated that my order was correct and still I received the wrong product.</li>
<li> I was driving myself crazy scratching even after moisturizing.</li>
<li> It was not &amp;#34;unscented&amp;#34; and had a terrible smell</li>

    <li> It is very good if you are washing your hands before you want to put your contact lenses on, because you want your hands free from anything so you can put your contact lenses on without grease them.</li>
    <li> love this soap it doesn&#x27;t sting when I use it, and I know it is good for my skin. Highly recommend it to others</li>
    <li> The glycerine soap calmed my dry skin like nothing else I&#x27;ve ever tried!</li>

    <li> have to have no scent in anything and not harsh soap works wonderfully for me use everyday that&#x27;s all now</li>
    <li> I ordered this as a remedy for sensitive areas because generic brand &amp;#34;sensitive skin&amp;#34; soaps were not working. It leaves me feeling clean and refreshed without irritation, and lasted for awhile even with daily use.</li>
    <li> Perfect. I have a lot of allergies and this is soap is perfect more me. I have problems with scents and this is very clean and clear with no aroma.</li>
    <li> Great price and I use this with my shaving brush and cream for that added comfort while shaving. Everyone should get some.</li>
    <li> This is the true, clear color product.&lt;br /&gt;I bought from this seller in the past and it is perfect. I am staying with this seller; they are honest, sell the original clear soap; no itching, no stinging skin. Is TRULY free of chemicals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A recent (different) seller I chose in July, 2015 advertised this type but sold me a yellow colored one in 3 pack. I don&#x27;t like the yellow one. It burns the skin. See my video review for that other product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I always ask for the clear product before buying. So far this seller I am doing this review for has sent the exact product as pictured; clear color, no chemicals, no &#x27;hidden&#x27; chemicals, ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I notice a 1 star review and its comments says the original formula has been changed; there are chemicals. One says this true old formula is being sold out. Says he checked the MSDS/Label list. My skin is great with the original formula but I want to be sure my body has only pure glycerin on it. I might bring my soap to a lab to find out if it has any other ingredients or evasive list. Or learn to make my own soap.</li>
    <li> Gave this a shot based on the reviews and price, and am very happy with this soap!  It doesn&#x27;t lather much, as other people had mentioned, but it is just as affective as the other soaps I use that do.  Will definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a more natural soap for my sensitive skin. This one made my skin sooo dry I stopped using it after a week. I was driving myself crazy scratching even after moisturizing. Thus ends my journey with glycerin soap.</li>
    <li> This soap makes no suds .</li>
    <li> This soap is great for people with skin conditions or just real sensitive skin. It&#x27;s perfume free and works great.</li>
    <li> This product is a great pre-shave soap. That&#x27;s because glycerin softens hair and also leaves a slick protective layer on the skin. I got noticeably smoother shaves after I started washing my face with this as a prep. That said this product doesn&#x27;t sud very well (probably due to the lack of additives) which makes it kind of annoying to apply, and there are other high glycerin specialty soaps which would probably be more effective. But this still does the job very well and for only four dollars it&#x27;s a GREAT bargain.</li>
    <li> Love the idea of glycerine soap as I am very sensitive to fragrances and chemicals.  I don&#x27;t mind if a soap only has a little suds, but this one had none.</li>
    <li> I like that there are not additives and no fake scents.  It last alot longer than other glycerine type soaps</li>
    <li> It was not &amp;#34;unscented&amp;#34; and had a terrible smell so I threw it out</li>
    <li> What the heck? The ingredients are not as listed. On the soap PACKAGE the ingredients are Glycerine, Sodium Stearate, Decyl Glucoside, Sorbitol, Sodium Oleate, Propanediol, Sodium Citrate&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, on Amazon the ingredients listed are:&lt;br /&gt;Glycerine (derived from Palm), Palm Stearic Acid, Palm Oleic Acid, Sodium MyrethSulfate (alcohol derived from corn), Sodium Hydroxide, Purified Water, AloeVera, Natural Fragrance Essence.</li>
    <li> Really clear with no loud scents, gentle suds and rinses cleanly.  Suggested for use by those who want to pamper and soften skin.</li>
    <li> Great soap that my mama likes because it is truly fragrance free which is all she can handle with her sensitivities. I buy her several bars every year to last the whole year through. Great present for the chemically, fragrance sensitive folks in your life!</li>
    <li> Oh boy... Let me first say that I was happy with the product once I received it. I made bath crayons for my kids for Christmas and 2 of these bars was enough to make 12 crayons for them. They were perfect for what I needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HOWEVER, When I made my order I was told my products would arrive no later than Dec 11th. On the 11th my husband brought in a quite heavy package. As I was only expecting these bars at the time I was baffled as to why the box was so heavy. Upon opening the box my question was answered. Instead of two 4oz bars, I had been sent two 32 oz bottles of hand soap. The packing slip even stated that my order was correct and still I received the wrong product. To make it worse, the bottles had been packed into a box that was JUST big enough to fit them therefore despite the handful of packing peanuts, the caps on both bottles were broken and leaking. I should also mention there was only about an inch of tape on each cap to keep them closed and the tape was no longer stuck to these caps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I contacted the company. and told them I had order 4 oz bars and received 32 oz bottles and was told  by someone at the company that I was shipped 4 oz bars and the bottles must have been from somewhere else. So I shot off another email stating again that though I ordered the bars I received the bottles FROM THEM though I didn&#x27;t order the bottles from anyone at all. this time I was asked if I would like a return label and the correct product sent to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;December 22 I finally revived a badly damaged box containing the correct products and the return label.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Though the product was great when it finally arrived. I would not order through this company again.</li>
    <li> I love this soap. I live in Southern California and this soap rinses off better than any other one I&#x27;ve tried. For other soaps, a person has to use lots of water to rinse or there&#x27;s a slimy feel; this rinses clean right away. And it doesn&#x27;t leave soap scum buildup in my soap dish or on my shower walls.</li>
    <li> This soap is jank as all get up. I&#x27;m only giving it 1 star because 0 isn&#x27;t an option. It hardly lathers and it has this weird glassy appearance. WARNING WARNING - put your money towards something else!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve found that it does the reverse of drying skin.  I used special liquid face soap for years because a skin specialist said I had to or my skin would be dry.  I had been using Clearly Natural on all my other skin and it has always been baby soft; but my face was getting more and more rough.  I tried an experiment two weeks ago.  Wow! now my face  too is baby soft and smooth.</li>
