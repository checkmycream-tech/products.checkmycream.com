      <li>It does de tangle pretty good and leaves your hair frizz-free.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t shampoo more than once or twice a week, but I use this conditioner almost every day, it rinses clean and does not build up.</li>

      <li>Would highly recommend to anyone trying to maintain healthy hair or repair damaged hair.</li>
      <li>This is probably THE most amazing daily conditioner that I stumbled upon a whole ago.  </li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t smell as good as it did when it was still made in Italy, but it still does the trick, the comb glides through my wet hair, no impossible knots.&lt;br</li>
      <li>great everyday conditioner</li>
      <li>And it smells good, too - soft, fresh and natural.</li>
      <li>Which is a let down, because this conditioner is amazing!</li>
      <li>Not the real product - this trashed my hair like I&#x27;ve never seen!  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve gotten many compliements since starting to use this product.  </li>
      <li>I think this is worth the buy if you can find it for a reasonable price.</li>
      <li>I first tried it years ago after reading that Liv Tyler would not leave the house without this product.</li>
      <li>A silicone free conditioner that offers a mega moisture punch to the hair and somehow reduced my frizz, softened hair and gave it some substance.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
      <li>I just use a couple of small/medium sized dabs after shampooing, comb it through with a wide toothed comb, rinse and exit the shower with nicely conditioned hair.</li>
      <li>The old product was amazing - left my hair</li>
      <li>In general I have a lot of fine hair that is darkened and I use heat products onit about 1 of 3 days.</li>
      <li>I think it is pretty good but not outstanding for the price.  </li>
      <li>It smells amazing and leaves my dry, color treated hair soft and moisturized.</li>
      <li>, I have color treated hair that is curly, I blow it straight and this product helps bring out the shine.</li>
      <li>Makes my hair much softer.</li>
      <li>Really should research it</li>
      <li>It really changes the health of your hair.</li>
      <li>Very moisturizing.</li>
      <li>but it really does seem to change the texture of my hair - much softer.</li>
      <li>I love this stuff and my hair isn&#x27;t getting used to it like it does with some other conditioners (I find they don&#x27;t work as well over time).  </li>
      <li>Can&#x27;t live without it!  </li>
      <li>Can&#x27;t live without it!  </li>
      <li>Despite its relatively high price I&#x27;m sticking with Terax forever.</li>

      <li>This is not genuine Terax product for sure.</li>
      <li>This conditioner is nice and thick.  </li>
      <li>In the winter when my hair is more dry, I put it on in the shower, clip my hair up, and then rinse it out 15 minutes later.  </li>
      <li>I have fine hair and have been using this product once a week as a deep conditioner for several years.  </li>
      <li>, it&#x27;s far to heavy for my hair to use more than once a week.</li>
      <li>The conditioner is a thick cream and laquers through my hair very easily.  </li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t weigh my fine hair down but makes it really silky and manageable the next day.  </li>
      <li>It makes your hair soft and manageable to comb through.</li>
      <li>feeling soft, hydrated, and silky.  </li>
      <li>This conditioner makes my hair super soft and cuts down on knots that I used to get all the time.</li>
      <li>I have thick hair and discovered at the age of 35 that my hair is so much healthier and easy to manage if I only wash it a couple of times a week.</li>
      <li>It makes my hair straight as long as I blowdry it</li>
      <li>Love this conditioner on my thick coarse wavy hair.  </li>
      <li>Generally I which this out with my joico reconstructor.</li>
      <li>and I really believe it&#x27;s true that there is a secret ingredient that&#x27;s not listed on the label...</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s thick and rich, and left my hair so soft!</li>
      <li>I have been using Crema for a few years now and like it very much.</li>
      <li>I have fine, thick long hair that tends to tangle and frizz.</li>

<li> I buy the small bottle now because I don&#x27;t like having the same bottle sitting in the shower for so long.</li>
<li> This makes my thick, curly hair soft and shiny.</li>
<li> but this conditioner keeps my hair cleaner between washes than any other I have tried.</li>
<li> I follow up with Terax leave-in gloss if my hair is especially dry.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I have always loved Terax conditioner.  This says for daily use but I use it as a deep conditioner also, by sleeping in it.  It doesn&#x27;t weigh my fine hair down but makes it really silky and manageable the next day.  Great product and I really believe it&#x27;s true that there is a secret ingredient that&#x27;s not listed on the label...</li>
    <li> awesome product. have recommended to loads of friends and family.</li>
    <li> Love terax. This conditioner rocks! Gets out all the tangles, keeps hair smooth, and not over oily. Their Miele shampoo is also great.</li>
    <li> A nice conditioner. Slightly overpriced though.</li>
    <li> My favorite conditioner!!</li>
    <li> I have products that are 3x cheaper than this conditioner and works just as well.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff and my hair isn&#x27;t getting used to it like it does with some other conditioners (I find they don&#x27;t work as well over time).  It makes my hair straight as long as I blowdry it (I have a sloppy wave to it if it dries naturally) and makes it soft and shiny.  I&#x27;ve gotten many compliements since starting to use this product.  Can&#x27;t live without it!  And prior to this I was using It&#x27;s a 10.  Crema is much better.  I also use it on my daughter&#x27;s extremely fine and easily tangled hair.  Her results aren&#x27;t quite as good as mine but it does help with the tangles.</li>
    <li> I have used this stuff on and off for years and it is quite good.  The scent has improved, and while this conditions well, your hair does not feel weighted down or greasy -- and I have thick, naturally curly, color treated, mature, prone to frizz hair.</li>
    <li> I would give the product a 5 star but I&#x27;m a little thrown off by the smell and the fact that it does have quite a bit of alcohol and may be a little drying for my hair. It does de tangle pretty good and leaves your hair frizz-free.</li>
    <li> great everyday conditioner, I have color treated hair that is curly, I blow it straight and this product helps bring out the shine.</li>
    <li> Love this conditioner on my thick coarse wavy hair.  Makes my hair much softer. Happy to find it discount on Amazon.</li>
    <li> This is a great moisturizer and it is not heavy, I have fine hair and wear it puffed out a little works great.</li>
    <li> I have thin, high-lighted hair that easily becomes dry, brittle and straw-like.  Crema smoothes, structures and hydrates my hair without making it too limp.  I use it 2 or 3 times a week.  Can&#x27;t live without it!  And it smells good, too - soft, fresh and natural.</li>
    <li> Love this product!  Great for hair and makes styling much easier...also love the scent.  Would recommend to everybody looking for a great conditioner!</li>
    <li> A hair stylist friend recommended this.  I think it is pretty good but not outstanding for the price.  Don&#x27;t know if I would repurchase.</li>
    <li> I have thick hair and discovered at the age of 35 that my hair is so much healthier and easy to manage if I only wash it a couple of times a week. I don&#x27;t know how or why but this conditioner keeps my hair cleaner between washes than any other I have tried. It is more expensive at the cash register but cheaper in the long run because I use a smaller amount when I condition and use it less frequently. I once bought one of the gigantic bottles and it lasted a year and a half! I buy the small bottle now because I don&#x27;t like having the same bottle sitting in the shower for so long. What a relief to not have to waste money on new products that don&#x27;t work!</li>
    <li> I was quite pleased with this purchase.  A silicone free conditioner that offers a mega moisture punch to the hair and somehow reduced my frizz, softened hair and gave it some substance.&lt;br /&gt;This does contain animal fat (beef tallow) so it is not vegan friendly.</li>
    <li> I love this conditioner! It smells amazing and leaves my dry, color treated hair soft and moisturized.</li>
    <li> This conditioner makes my hair super soft and cuts down on knots that I used to get all the time.</li>
    <li> Been using Terax for years ever since I read way back when that celebrities use it. It used to be imported from Italy, but now comes from Syracuse NY. Still the same quality.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s THE best conditioner out there in my opinion. I won&#x27;t use anything else on my hair from now on.</li>
    <li> This makes my thick, curly hair soft and shiny. Really love it.</li>
    <li> best conditioner ever.</li>
    <li> Love this conditioner. Leaves my hair feeling healthy. Would highly recommend to anyone trying to maintain healthy hair or repair damaged hair.</li>
    <li> I have habitually abused my hair. In general I have a lot of fine hair that is darkened and I use heat products onit about 1 of 3 days. This conditioner is nice and thick.  I shampoo my hair. Put it on. And leve it on till the end of the bath. My hair afterwards remains silky and manageable. It&#x27;s one of the better product that I use. Generally I which this out with my joico reconstructor. I think this is worth the buy if you can find it for a reasonable price.</li>
    <li> I have fine hair and have been using this product once a week as a deep conditioner for several years.  I notice the difference in the shower as soon as I rinse the conditioner out...as my hair is immediately smoother.  The conditioner is a thick cream and laquers through my hair very easily.  In the winter when my hair is more dry, I put it on in the shower, clip my hair up, and then rinse it out 15 minutes later.  In the summer, I just keep it in throughout the length of my shower.  Either way, I notice the difference all day long.  Some reviewers mentioned a bad smell but I&#x27;ve always thought it smells good.</li>
    <li> I have been using Crema for a few years now and like it very much. It was recommended to me by me beautician.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had long hair most of my life, and this product is really great. I can feel the difference, it takes about a week but it really does seem to change the texture of my hair - much softer. I don&#x27;t shampoo more than once or twice a week, but I use this conditioner almost every day, it rinses clean and does not build up.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for year. My hair is thin and dry, curly/wavy. It doe snot make your hair heavy but it leave it silky and full of shine. I first tried it years ago after reading that Liv Tyler would not leave the house without this product. Now I am hooked too.</li>
    <li> My hair is long and thin. Despite this being labeled as a &amp;#34;daily&amp;#34; conditioner, it&#x27;s far to heavy for my hair to use more than once a week. Which is a let down, because this conditioner is amazing! It&#x27;s thick and rich, and left my hair so soft! It also has a wonderful scent... I got compliments all day about how great my hair smelled :)&lt;br /&gt;This is a must have product.</li>
    <li> This is probably THE most amazing daily conditioner that I stumbled upon a whole ago.  It&#x27;s a must.  And doesn&#x27;t weigh hair down at all.</li>
    <li> Excellent value for an item that I have used for many years.</li>
    <li> been buying this for years (and the shampoo). Really should research it al better but I am so satisfied, I am not taking the time to think my hair shampoo and conditioner through any further.</li>
    <li> Not the real product - this trashed my hair like I&#x27;ve never seen!  The old product was amazing - left my hair feeling soft, hydrated, and silky.  This is not genuine Terax product for sure.</li>
    <li> This conditioner is a miracle! It really changes the health of your hair. Like hair nutrition. Very moisturizing. I feel like it enhances my hair&#x27;s natural beauty, helping it look the best it can- brings out my waves and tames the frizz...</li>
    <li> I love this conditioner! It makes your hair soft and manageable to comb through. The smell is amazing! Great product!!</li>
    <li> Nothing makes my mile long hair softer or smell nicer. I just wish I could afford Terax all the time!</li>
    <li> my favorite conditioner... great for thick wavy hair</li>
    <li> I have fine, thick long hair that tends to tangle and frizz. I&#x27;ve tried countless conditioners (Kerastase, Nexxus, Nioxin, etc.) and none of them worked well. I used large globs of those other conditioners and still my hair was a tangled mess after washing. Not so with Texax! I just use a couple of small/medium sized dabs after shampooing, comb it through with a wide toothed comb, rinse and exit the shower with nicely conditioned hair. I follow up with Terax leave-in gloss if my hair is especially dry. Despite its relatively high price I&#x27;m sticking with Terax forever.</li>
    <li> This is the best conditioner for fine hair I have ever used. It is lightweight and helps correct fly aways.</li>
    <li> What I received was NOT the product pictured above. The conditioner I received was in a white tube and DIFFERENT than the one in the blue striped tube. I feel stuck and don&#x27;t like the bait and switch of showing one product and delivering another. I have used the conditioner in the blue tube and it is NOT interchangeable with the white tube product I received.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t smell as good as it did when it was still made in Italy, but it still does the trick, the comb glides through my wet hair, no impossible knots.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this for over a decade, and other Terax products are equally good--try Life Drops leave-in conditioner for a really nice feel, scent, and shine.</li>
