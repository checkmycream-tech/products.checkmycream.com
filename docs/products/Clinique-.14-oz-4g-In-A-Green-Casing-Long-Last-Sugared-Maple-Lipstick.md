<li> This is supposed to be long lasting lipstick.  </li>
<li> I kept searching, and found the exact same shade in the green tube for a LOT less.  </li>
<li> I need to reapply all day long.</li>
<li> but doesn&#x27;t stay on long....</li>
<li> It stays on long.  </li>
<li> One of my wife&#x27;s favorites and not available locally.</li>
<li> I used the last little speck of this lipstick that I previously had in a silver tube.  </li>
<li> Not true to color and just lays on the lips not offering any moisture.  </li>
<li> I usually buy from the Clinique counter and get the silver casing</li>

    <li> Prefect color, great brand. Shipped and arrived on time. I have used Clinique for many years so to find a good price on their products was great.</li>
    <li> perfect color--not too dark or light---better than nude neutral</li>
    <li> The color is too muted for my skin tones and besides that, the lipstick simply does not hold up.  I need to reapply all day long.</li>
    <li> This is supposed to be long lasting lipstick.  However it is sheer and slippery, it never &amp;#34;sets&amp;#34; it remains gooey and you have to use a lot to get noticeable color.  Once you layer enough on, it is a nice color.  But it comes off immediately like a lip gloss.  I was expecting a longer lasting lipstick from one called &amp;#34;Long Last&amp;#34;.  3 Stars for the color, 1 star for the wear.</li>
    <li> Looked great with my tan</li>
    <li> I love the Sugared Maple. It is one of my favorites!  It is such a pretty color and works well for day and evening.  It stays on long.  I would definitely buy this again!</li>
    <li> Not long wearing like MAXFACTOR</li>
    <li> I was afraid I might not be able to find this lipstick and was so pleased to find it on Amazon I bought 2. It arrived within days with a nice note from the merchant. Thanx again Amazon!</li>
    <li> This is a nice color that most anyone could wear, not too dark or too light.</li>
    <li> Excellent product! SUPER FAST DELIVERY! THANKS!</li>
    <li> Love this lipstick! I read in Susan Lucci&#x27;s memoir that she uses this color and I love her so I had to have it! Amazing price and always get this super fast!</li>
    <li> Nice color but doesn&#x27;t stay on long....</li>
    <li> great color. I am pale with dramatic features and this looks great. It is very natural looking, but still has a sparkle. Good for any occasion!</li>
    <li> This has to be the all time best color of lipstick ever!  Every time I wear it I get compliments and people ask me what it is.  I usually buy from the Clinique counter and get the silver casing but I didn&#x27;t see any real difference in this one; it was just as good and much cheaper. This was a great deal and I will buy again!</li>

    <li> Not true to color and just lays on the lips not offering any moisture.  If it wasn&#x27;t for the cost I&#x27;d send it back.</li>
    <li> Great color and long-lasting! Love this lipstick!&lt;br /&gt;Read Ephesians 2:8&amp;9</li>
