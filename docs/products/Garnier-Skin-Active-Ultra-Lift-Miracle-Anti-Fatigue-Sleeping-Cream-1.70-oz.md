<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Love this cream. It isn&#x27;t heavy and I have seen a result after a week. Smoother skin, general healthly looking</li>
    <li> I bought this along with the corresponding eye &amp;#34;cream&amp;#34; at Target at $14.99 ea. Lately my skin has been excessively dry, but breaking out (I attribute the breakouts to Loreal Infallible Pro-Matte Foundation which I stopped using) and all my moisturizers have been exacerbating the breakouts. I&#x27;ve never had much luck with Garnier skincare products, but I heard so many great things about this that I decided to give it a shot anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some reviewers have been saying that this cream is greasy, but it&#x27;s not. The &amp;#34;greasiness&amp;#34; is the dimethicone which is a derritive of silicone, which is also found in primers. So yes, it does have that slick feeling to it, but after about 15 mins the cream is absorbed and is not slick or tacky feeling. It actually leaves my skin incredibly soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cream itself is very heavy and you don&#x27;t really need very much at all. The more you use, the heavier it&#x27;s going to feel, obviously. Used sparingly though, it really makes my skin feel super hydrated and soft. It absorbs into the skin wonderfully. With any product that has acids, you&#x27;re going to experience tingling if your skin is sensitive or if you&#x27;ve just exfoliated. It&#x27;s completely normal. What&#x27;s not normal is if you&#x27;re skin peels or remains red and patchy hours after use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I noticed a difference the morning after my first use. My skin looked smooth and bright, and much firmer. My blackheads even looked less pronounced, less dark, and my pores even look smaller. My fine lines are less noticeable and my makeup applies like a dream, honestly. I think it also delivers on the anti-fatigue aspect because my skin has looked rejuvinated and incredibly glowy and moisturized since I&#x27;ve been using this. My breakouts have cleared up and even my scarring from cystic breakouts from that foundation have become less red and I haven&#x27;t really even needed to use any foundation. I&#x27;ve just been spot concealing and using a powder and my skin looks years younger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m super impressed with this cream and I will continue to use it and see if it continues to perform this well. If it does you can bet that I will definitely repurchase. So far this is the best Garnier skincare product I&#x27;ve ever used. Hands down.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m super impressed with this cream and I will continue to use it and see if it continues to perform this well. If it does you can bet that I will definitely repurchase. So far this is the best Garnier skincare product I&#x27;ve ever used. Hands down.</li>
    <li> nice  works well keeps skin soft</li>
    <li> Smells good, feels good, but actually is slightly drying.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve seen a million commercials for this product lately, so — I&#x27;ll admit it — I&#x27;m a sucker and I immediately had to try it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using it for a few weeks (not every night, but about twice a week), I have to say that I&#x27;m pleasantly surprised. This Miracle Sleeping Cream is quite a MIRACLE, but it&#x27;s a decent product that I&#x27;ll probably repurchase in the future. I have a complicated multi-product anti-wrinkle skincare regimen that I do on most nights, but for lazy nights when I&#x27;m tired and just want to slap something all over with no muss, no fuss, this product is exactly what I reach for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The texture is unique — somehow spongy and creamy at the same time — and it&#x27;s just a very light moisturizer that&#x27;s quick and easy to apply. I rub it all over my face and neck, including my eyes, and I&#x27;m done. Takes about five seconds. Then, in the morning, I wake up with hydrated and very soft skin. I would suggest washing your face in the morning (or at least using a makeup wipe) if you don&#x27;t plan on taking a shower, because I have noticed that it leaves a thin film on my face (nothing gross, but you can definitely still feel it on you if you touch your face).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Basically, it&#x27;s a pretty good product for a cheap price. I don&#x27;t think that this will do anything incredible for me when it comes to its anti-aging claims, but I think it&#x27;s a good option for lazy nights or people who want to do SOMETHING, but not put a whole lot of effort into nighttime skincare.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m quite the beauty addict. I&#x27;ve tried almost every drugstore, department store and designer brands out there and I&#x27;ve never found something that covers all the bases. I&#x27;ve only been trying this for a few nights, so I&#x27;ll have to update later on the long-term effects but I can say I&#x27;m already impressed. It has a luxurious feel and mild scent and when I wake up in the morning my face still feels good. No dry spots, no greasiness, it basically still feels shoddy and clean and like I could skip washing and just get ready for my day, but I don&#x27;t. Great value for a drugstore brand, snag it quick and hopefully you can make use of the Amazon coupon like I did.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product recently, for free. It felt amazing. My face was so soft, any of the wrinkles on my face were reduced, it was amazing. It smells good it feels good and to continue using this product the price is definitely worth it.</li>
    <li> nice smell and love it</li>
    <li> I am 47 years old and have been using for two weeks.  I usually use Olay products and thought I would try something new.  It&#x27;s  a good moisturizer, but I didn&#x27;t notice any subtle of dramatic changes.  I will be going back to Olay</li>
    <li> Much cheaper in stores! I just started using it so it&#x27;s kind of new to tell however I haven&#x27;t experienced the irritation issue that some people say is common and I do have quite sensitive skin. The first morning after I noticed a definite improvement in my skin texture, like the lines in my forehead. But it might have helped that I actually got a lot of sleep for the first time in awhile as well. We&#x27;ll see</li>
    <li> Great I love this cream.</li>
    <li> I love this product very much,, plugss the price is great!  Thank pyou so much, Jenne</li>
    <li> I found this at the drug store. It was five dollars more than here. I&#x27;m over 60 so don&#x27;t expect miracles, but was very happy with the results the first night I used it.Love how my skin feels in the morning  at it&#x27;s got a light pleasant scent. I&#x27;ve been using it a little over a week and do see softening of fine lines. I exfoliate a couple of times a week and have not experienced any burning after apply this lotion. My skin is sensitive so expected some burning after exfoliating, based on others posts, but it felt fine. My skin also tended to get whiteheads but none have popped up since using this. Will buy again</li>
    <li> I have found this product to be effective as a night face cream.  My skin has shown a definite improvement.</li>
    <li> It wasn&#x27;t what I was hoping for.</li>
    <li> It does the job. Unfortunately, I put too much on and I look pre-pubescent, which is sometimes a problem.</li>
    <li> Best product I have used in a long time.</li>
    <li> This cream contains lavender oil which is toxic to skin. &amp;#34;Research indicates that components of lavender, specifically linalool, can be cytotoxic, which means that topical application causes skin-cell death. Lavender leaves contain camphor, which is a known skin irritant. Because the fragrance constituents in lavender oil oxidize when exposed to air, lavender oil is a pro-oxidant, and this enhanced oxidation increases its irritancy on skin. Lavender oil is the most potent form, and even small amounts of it (0.25% or less) are problematic.&amp;#34; Also, because it is in jar packaging, most of the beneficial ingredients begin to deteriorate once they are exposed to air.</li>
    <li> first time using,, and i already love this stuff!</li>
    <li> It was a bit flowery smelling with a hint of something almost citrusy. Maybe grapefruit? The smell is not strong, though. I had a burning sensation on my upper cheeks for 2 - 5 min. It was mild and then I did not notice it anymore. The next morning after sleeping with it on, I do see a change in my skin. It looks more firm. My skin which had been looking pretty dull has more of healthy pink glow. I gave it a 4 instead of 5 for two reasons. The first is the perfumey smell. I usually do not use any kind of fragrances so I am sensitive to even a mild smell. The second is that I thought it was a little too harsh to use daily. I would however use it occasionally because there were noticeable results by the next day.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff....really changing the surface of my face for the better.</li>
    <li> I received this product very quickly.  However the jar is half full, why is that?????</li>
    <li> Still looking for results, smells good, it&#x27;s a little heavy feeling</li>
    <li> This looks like a great face cream. However, when it arrived it smells like it&#x27;s gone rancid. I was sent old product i think.</li>
    <li> I got a sample of this in the mail and was rationing it until I could buy it. I use retin a and this is great to use with it at nighttime. I did experience a mild stinging I think due to retin a but once that stopped it was ok and didn&#x27;t become red. Instead my face is so smooth in the morning. I love the smell of this lotion. I was pleasantly how far this lotion goes. You only need a little as it is pretty thick but not greasy. I have very oily skin and have no experienced any breakouts. I looked forward to putting this on each evening. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> MUST REVIEW.....I am 75...never used anything on my skin but was blessed with decent skin and not too many wrinkles at all.  Lately I started noticing puffiness under my eyes in the morning and not wanting to sit with cucumbers or potatoes on my eyes daily....I purchased this.  I slather it on at night.....AND IT WORKS~!!!  I LOVE THIS PRODUCT....HIGHLY RECOMMEND.</li>
    <li> Smells awful and has a jelly texture. Seems to be working well, but not that well comparing to other night creams out there. Didn&#x27;t like it so much.</li>
    <li> This Garnier product is very good - I did notice a difference and will continue to use it in future.</li>
    <li> I am so glad I did not buy more than one jar.  I have not seen any results.  I also wake up with very dry sky around my eyes.  No, I would not spend money to buy this product again.</li>
    <li> I love everything that is from Garnier!</li>
    <li> The jar is only half full and is very yellow compared to a jar of this I bought from the local drug store previously. Seems odd.</li>
    <li> I bought this at walmary on a whim, I was going to get oil of olay regernerist but it was too high so I got this instead for 15 bucks . I have been using It for about 4 days and I like the results, my skin just looks brighter and more fresh faced. my skin is super oily so when I wake up in the morning I look a greasy mess, but once I wash my face it looks nice.</li>
    <li> Hasn&#x27;t made a bit of difference!  Phony Hype!!</li>
    <li> A little goes a long way. This jar will definitely last me a long time. I use it as the last step in my nightly face care routine. I notice my skin is soft and smooth the next morning. Smell is good too. Smells slightly fruity.</li>
    <li> I bought this cream recently, I thought it would be a good night cream, however the consistency is odd, it&#x27;s not really creamy it seems solid in the jar.  It did arrive quickly and well packed.</li>
    <li> Skin looks very refreshed in the morning</li>
    <li> Love this stuff!  Read about it in Good Housekeeping and thought why not give it a try?  Good product!!!!</li>
    <li> My skin felt different after one use. Surprising results for the price. Moisturizers and smooths face and neck.</li>
    <li> This is a very nice, rich and creamy moisturizer with a light rose scent. It is now part of my daily regimen along with the smoothing cream cleanser and moisture rescue gel cream in the morning. I use this and the ultra lift miracle sleeping cream at night.  I can really see my wrinkles smoothing out. My skin looks years younger. It really is a miracle.</li>
    <li> I think this is a great night moisturizer. I don&#x27;t really see any lift happening and do not notice the brighter skin everyone talks about. I do like the way it makes my skin feel, though.</li>
    <li> It was not any better than the cream I currently use.</li>
    <li> I love this night cream. It&#x27;s so silky and has an indulgent feel against your skin. I can really see the difference in the lines on my face and my skin looks so healthy and energize after several applications. I think this product works well than some of the expensive department store brands I have purchased. Great value for the price too in my opinion. I will continue to purchase and use this and highly recommended it to others. Excellent facial product.</li>
    <li> I have sensitive skin and the first night I used it, I could feel a tingling.  The next day my face was red but thought that maybe that was the &amp;#34;brightness&amp;#34; it was advertised to happen after the first morning.  I put it on again that night. The next day my skin ended up feeling dry and was definitely red and not bright.  I did some heavy moisturizing and stopped using it but my skin was already peeling and I&#x27;ve noticed skin discoloration and swelling.  It says it is gentle to skin and suitable for all skin types but it clearly isn&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> Not a miracle, but moisturizers well at night</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve started using a strong retinol 2-3 nights a week which has made my skin sensitive (hopefully temporarily) and dry. I wanted something to use the other nights that was gentle and very moisturizing. What I got was instant burning for at least a few minutes before calming down. My skin was still a little red the neck morning. Moisturizing was acceptible though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think if my skin was not sensitized I&#x27;d be ok using this to finish off the jar but I would not buy again since they say even trace irritation can be bad for your skin in the long run. Obviously I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to judge long term results.</li>
    <li> very creamy and feels good on my face</li>
    <li> Love it will buy again</li>
    <li> This is the perfect night time cream.  Not to greasy, but adds moisture nicely!!</li>
    <li> Makes my skin feel silky soft.</li>
    <li> This stuff is fantastic. Skin feels so much better. Not greasy and has light pleasant smell.  Finally something that works!</li>
    <li> Wow!  I could feel a difference after the first night- my skin felt softer.  Within a few days, my skin looked brighter.  I&#x27;ve been a loyal Lancome user for years and have never seen this much a difference!</li>
    <li> Strange looking almost like silly puddy but works great</li>
    <li> Excellent cream. Would buy again.</li>
    <li> Goes on smoothly, wonderful fragrance</li>
    <li> Being -- shall we say -- &amp;#34;older,&amp;#34; my skin gets drier every year.  Also, I have a genetic condition which keeps my skin dry -- since birth (doesn&#x27;t every 5-year old have very itchy skin whenever leaving the bathtub or the swimming pool -- I mean REALLY itchy skin?)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product seems to be to be as good as the really expensive ones and works just as well to keep my skin moist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only concern is the amount of product in the jar.  The cream had &amp;#34;settled&amp;#34; such that it was about 2/3 full when I opened it.  This tells me that the manufacturer is whipping a lot of air into it during the manufacturing process and before it is put in the jar.  I am sure there are other explanations, but the bottom line is that there isn&#x27;t as much cream in the jar when opened as one would expect.  I only wish I had some equipment that could give me an accurate measure of the volume.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is still a good product -- it is thick -- unlike some other &amp;#34;watery&amp;#34; products which call themselves creams when they are really lotions.</li>
    <li> THIS is the greatest. My skin felt hydrated after one night</li>
    <li> It giving you acne like a teenager is how this product is supposed to make you look younger, then it has done it&#x27;s job.  Otherwise, it has made my formerly clear skin completely break out. I have combination skin, and where I am dry I have developed cystic acne all over, which went away when I stopped using it.  I am now using it on my neck to finish up the jar.</li>
    <li> smells nice.,..that&#x27;s it</li>
    <li> Very nice feeling on your face.</li>
    <li> I noticed a small difference</li>
    <li> Smells wonderful, feels good and I actually notice a difference in my complexion.  I&#x27;m hooked.</li>
    <li> This is the best night crème that I have found</li>
    <li> I am a 58 years old female and this product work for me.  Will continue to buy.</li>
    <li> Made my face swell and itch.</li>
    <li> Garnier, I have to say this is one of your best products.  My face looks and feels younger, brighter, more vibrant. This is a miracle cream. I will continue to use this for a very long time.  Thank You.</li>
    <li> Very good product. Have not expected that my wrinkles vanish over night or time, guess none of the creams on the market can do that. But this cream vanishes like a dream in your skin. No oily residue and next morning you can feel the softness of your skin with pleasure.</li>
    <li> feels like it is slightly burning my skin. guess i am a bit allergic.</li>
    <li> Love this--works immediately and you can feel and see the results-I won&#x27;t use anything else !</li>
    <li> Not nearly as good as advertised. Not very moisturizing. That was my biggest disappointment, and as far as lifting.... Give me a break. It&#x27;s a mild moisturizer at best. Will not repurchase ever again.</li>
    <li> love smell not greasy for overnight</li>
    <li> I have tried just about everything for my super dry skin. No matter how often I would exfoliate, every day, my face would be dry and peeling. Before trying this product, I was using Eucerin Soothing Repair Creme with mixed results. But it was very thick and greasy--not really something you want to be putting on your face. Then I found this, and thought I&#x27;d give it a try. It&#x27;s been two weeks now, and my skin has never felt better. The constant peeling has stopped. My pores are less noticeable. My skin feels so soft and smooth. A little goes a long way, and the price is right. I&#x27;m in love. :)</li>
    <li> I like it except  it tends to make me feel greasy .  So I have found that if I use it every other night it works better.  My skin is beautiful and dewy in the mornings though!</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t see any real difference.  As usual, these products target older women using teenagers in their advertising!  I&#x27;m giving 3 stars simply because I don&#x27;t want to be mean.</li>
    <li> Love this lotion, makes my skin really soft and smooth and look fresh in the morning!</li>
    <li> Not as good as I had hoped for. A little too heavy.</li>
    <li> Smells too old fashioned. Like Ponds cold cream. Not pleasant.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this cream nightly and really like it. It feels nice and smells great. The small jar lasted 2 months.</li>
    <li> I cannot yet comment on the efficacy of this product, but will say that if you are sensitive to fragrance, this is not for you. In my opinion, this product has way too much fragrance added.  I will still use the product and post an update when possible.</li>
    <li> I was expecting a miracle, didn&#x27;t happen. Lol</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
    <li> Stay away!  This product does not live up to even one claim it makes and it literally burned my skin when I applied it.</li>
    <li> This broke my face broke out in rash.  I contacted Garnier about it and they never responded.  I quit using it and rash cleared in 3 days.  Maybe I was allergic to it but Garnier&#x27;s lack of response is reason for the bad rating.</li>
    <li> If you have sensitive skin don&#x27;t buy them. I had to wind up at the Dermatologist twice. What fun not.</li>
    <li> not good for women with oily / combination skin.  I was using it &amp; it was causing my forehead &amp; nose to break out more.  It&#x27;s a great price, &amp; if my skin were completely dry this would&#x27;ve been a great product.  At the moment, I&#x27;ll just be using it for my cheeks until I finish the jar.  Unfortunately, I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll buy it again.</li>
    <li> After using this for 3 months I have noticed the most difference in my neck. It seems tighter andthe skin has less of that crepey thin look. Also, the fine lines around my eyes aren&#x27;t quite as deep. It is great at moisturizing under my eyes. I can&#x27;t use on my cheeks as I have rosacea and it irritates them. But other than that I love it every where else.</li>
    <li> I love it  I am 79 and looks like 60</li>
    <li> I really like this product.  It isn&#x27;t greasy and makes my skin feel very soft.</li>
    <li> I am in love with this product.I slather it on every night.I enjoy the smell and when I wake up I can feel and see that my face is nourished and looks healthier than it ever did before in the morning.I am on a journey to find the best skincare routine and this product is a keeper,I already added it to my subscribe and save membership!I am very happy with the results!</li>
    <li> The package which I got was opened and I doubt the authenticity of the product. If you read this review  please contact me.</li>
    <li> I like several Garnier products. This one is nice also..... You wake up with a refreshed face.</li>
    <li> This cream has literally taken years off already.  Fabulous stuff.  I use it only a couple of times a week, but I do notice the improvement immediately.</li>
    <li> Love the hydrating effect</li>
    <li> I have been using this cream for about 3 months now ..And this really works ..Even though ..I don&#x27;t get much sleep prior to using this u could tell because my face look tired. .But now u wouldn&#x27;t know unless I tell u ..I love this product cause it my face little cheat cream ..</li>
    <li> Saw this in a magazine ad and I am seeing the &amp;#34;miracle&amp;#34; already!</li>
    <li> Feels and smells nice. I don&#x27;t really see a difference (few weeks) though I&#x27;ll keep trying for a bit longer.</li>
    <li> My skin isn&#x27;t sensitive to much, but this burned the crap out of my face. It stung when I put it on and the next day I was blotchy and peeling. Too bad. I liked the idea, and it smells lovely.</li>
    <li> seems to be pretty good</li>
    <li> I bought this along with the eye cream of the same name.  I love the eye cream, but this was too heavy for my face.  It made my face break out and felt sticky as though it didn&#x27;t fully absorb into my skin and just sat on top.  I didn&#x27;t have any burning or redness, but it did clog my pores.  The smell is nice, not too overpowering.  I didn&#x27;t notice any immediate results like I did with the eye cream.  I will not be buying this again.</li>
    <li> This cream feels good going on and it really is soothing.  Great night cream. I feel pretty in the morning when I use it at bedtime.</li>
    <li> Have used this ever since it came out.  Really like it.  A wonderful moisturizer.Great product.</li>
    <li> I like it okay. It&#x27;s not the fountain of youth that many people claimed it was, nor the miracle cream some of the reviews stated. It goes on light (not heavy as reviewed), doesn&#x27;t have a strong odor...both were complaints of other buyers.  I think, honestly, if you don&#x27;t leave a cleanser on your face for a full 30-60 secs all creams are going to feel heavy and not absorb. I like it well enough to buy it again (if it&#x27;s cheap enough), but not so well that I wouldn&#x27;t experiment with other products with good reviews in the same price range.  I simply did not experience the &amp;#34;miracle lift&amp;#34;. My skin looks good...I give credit for that to my Clarisonic. If it&#x27;s cheap enough and you&#x27;re not sure I think it&#x27;s worth ordering to try. If you&#x27;re like me and have &amp;#34;tried everything&amp;#34; I don&#x27;t think your search will end here.</li>
    <li> I needed something for my face it was very dry due to medication I was an still taking. I use this every day. I noticed improvement with in 4 to 5 days. My skin is soft smooth an 80% dryness is gone. It&#x27;s even made wrinkles look much small an not as visible</li>
    <li> &amp;#62;Love this stuff! Feels great on my skin and I swear I&#x27;m looking  younger</li>
    <li> This doesn&#x27;t take much at all and it is working well on my aged SKIN as well as being a diabetic. Would recommend to all who needs this kind of help I ask use eye cream as well.</li>
    <li> My eyes swell and my face itches &amp; burns. I tried blending a small portion in with my usual rich face cream, but the allergy is already set in place. My neck can handle it a bit better, so I&#x27;ll finish off the product that way.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok smells nice but didn&#x27;t notice any results!</li>
    <li> Can not beat it for the money</li>
    <li> I ordered a sample of this product to try it out. I applied to my clean skin before bed. It felt very greasy and just kind of sat on my skin instead of soaking in. I thought this might be how the product worked, by slowly sinking in overnight. After waking, my skin still feels greasy and I feel like my pores are clogged. The first thing I wanted to do was wash this off of my face. I took before and after pictures as well. I can see more lines and wrinkles the next morning than before using. I don&#x27;t recommend this product at all.</li>
    <li> I love facial products and will fall for nearly any gimmick, but this didn&#x27;t do a thing for me. Boots no. 7&#x27;s overnight cream is way better. I wake up looking like I&#x27;ve take 7-8 years off. I&#x27;m in my mid thirties, so that&#x27;s significant.</li>
    <li> Helps with fine lines and wrinkles. Makes skin look and feel fresh and hydrated. This product has helped with my &amp;#34;scowl line&amp;#34; between my eyebrows, and the fine lines around my lips leftover from years of smoking. I will definitely be purchasing this again.</li>
    <li> i love this cream.  i put on every night before go to bed.</li>
    <li> I am not the type of person that is looking for a wrinkle cream, I am in late forties, I know that at this age you start to develop wrinkles.&lt;br /&gt;I purchased this mainly because of some severely dry skin I have been having. I am glad that I did. I&#x27;ve been using this every night before bed for about 5 days now, and not only has it helped the dry skin issues, but I have also noticed some wrinkles around my mouth and forehead beginning to disappear. I would not only buy this again, I would also recommend this!</li>
    <li> good cream for the money.</li>
    <li> It has a good texture and the cream feels good.  It did not decrease the pores as it said it would.  I stopped using it.</li>
    <li> I saw a definite improvement about 3 weeks after using The Ultra-Lift Miracle Sleeping Cream. It works much better than the cream I had been using for years. The price for the results is fantastic! I  would recommend to all woman but especially woman over 60.</li>
    <li> My skin is dewy and hydrated.</li>
    <li> I thought that I would give this a try, even though the night cream I was using was doing a pretty good job. This stuff felt really greasy on my face. I guess it would be good for extremely dry skin, which I don&#x27;t have. The only miracle about this cream is that it didn&#x27;t ruin my pillowcase. Wouldn&#x27;t purchase it again.</li>
    <li> My skin has become much drier as I&#x27;ve become older.  I&#x27;m always on the lookout for effective skin creams and this product doesn&#x27;t disappoint.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why I love this product:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* It works.  My skin looks noticeably brighter after only a few nights&#x27; use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* The pleasant smell.  I am always happy to find a product that has a nice smell. I find so many creams have a very heavy, cloying and unpleasant scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Only a small amount is needed.  You only need to apply a pearl sized amount and that will cover your whole face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking for a nice effective night cream that won&#x27;t break the bank, you might enjoy this product.</li>
    <li> Although this cream has hyaluronic and hydroxy acids I really didn&#x27;t feel any reaction from my skin as some users report.  It goes on greasy but absorbs fairly fast and my skin feels smoother in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A good night cream but don&#x27;t expect a miracle.</li>
    <li> LOVE this cream!!  The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it a full five stars is because when I put it on at night, it soothes me through the night, but I found that when I wake up to get ready, even if I splash and dry my face, there is still underlying moisture.  Underneath my make up it gives it an exceptionally oily look.  Even when I retouch with a powder compact, it still looks oily.  I will play around a bit and try to find a solution and hopefully come back with a FIVE star review.  Also, please note, I do not apply this cream in excess at all.</li>
    <li> Smells good, but don&#x27;t get if you have a lot of blackheads. I stopped using mine because it was clogging my pores.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t see any major changes.  Smell is okay</li>
    <li> This one is  wonderful!!!</li>
    <li> perfect for nightime application.</li>
    <li> Really saw a difference after a couple days, really like this cream . It is light weight and not at all greasy .</li>
    <li> Guess I&#x27;m looking for a miracle.  Got because dr oz said was  great.  Only have small wrinkles at eyes and still there.</li>
    <li> I actually purchased this at target, but I was so impressed by it I had to look it up here and write a review since I&#x27;m constantly reading them on anything I buy.  To give a little insight to my skin type,  I&#x27;m 30 and have gone from super oily acne prone skin to overly dry,  sensitive skin with hormonal cystic acne.  I&#x27;ve tried everything from high end products and treatments to low end and have spent thousands on my horrible skin.  Almost anything I use to treat the acne will make it too dry and flaky and anything I use to moisturize will break me out horribly.  I am now starting to get wrinkles and fine lines as well which are much more pronounced with my skin so dry.  After looking at the ingredients and seeing that its non-comedogenic and has some beneficial things in it,  I gave it a shot. The first night it did burn and sting putting it on right after  washing.  That went away in a few minutes and there was no redness. When I woke up,  the first thing I noticed was that my face no longer had that tight dry feeling.  when I washed it with my Purity all in one cleanser, I noticed all my dry flaky skin washed away!  I was left with super soft skin and for the first time in months I could put makeup on without seeing flakes.  Not only that,  but many of my blemishes had almost cleared and were far less red. By day seven,  almost all my blemishes were gone!  I was so happy I almost cried. I&#x27;ve been using this for about 6 weeks and the fine lines around my eyes and the weird patches under them are long gone , and I have only had a few minor blemishes around that time of the month that went away quickly.  Also, NO cystic acne since I started using it!  I am beyond thrilled and will continue buying this as long as it keeps working like this!</li>
    <li> I am 31 years old and I have oily acne prone skin with bug pores in my forehead... nose and cheek area. I have freckles... acne marks and uneven skin. I have a lil 3 month old and I go to grad school so I am super tired. My pregnancy glow was fading I away and I was left with dull grayish skin  and i started getting pimples on my cheeks. I bought this due to getting an example on the Walmart beauty box and after 1 use I loved how it left my skin hydrated and glowy. After 2 days my pimples were gone. I have been using it for less than a week and my skin it&#x27;s literally flawless. It&#x27;s making my skin more even ...less redness... my pores are getting smaller and my skin glows.... i literally put only spf and I&#x27;m ready to go. Love it!!! I recommended it to all friends and family.</li>
