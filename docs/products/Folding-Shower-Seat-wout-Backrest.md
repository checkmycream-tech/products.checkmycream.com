      <li>this was nice bath seat</li>
      <li>Use at your own risk.</li>
      <li>My shower seat is very easy to assemble.  </li>
      <li>BEWARE,  while very easy to snap into place</li>
      <li>and I wouldn&#x27;t feel safe.    </li>
      <li>I had hoped to be able to hang it, but that won&#x27;t work.</li>
      <li>Easy to use and fold away.  </li>
      <li>It folds easily.</li>
      <li>Love that it&#x27;s easy to clean and folds up when not in use.  </li>
      <li>Before ordering, don&#x27;t eyeball where it&#x27;s going to go - take accurate shower/tub measurements and account for curvatures.  </li>
      <li>the weight capacity given is accurate</li>
      <li>it is fantastic.</li>
      <li>However, had the bench fit in my tub correctly, I would not have returned it because of this issue alone.    </li>
      <li>Like some of the other reviews say, the legs don&#x27;t quite fit perfectly in our tub, but it is still very steady and had no problems using it in the tub.</li>
      <li>It is sturdy and dries quickly.</li>
      <li>First, it doesn&#x27;t fit in my standard-sized tub.  </li>
      <li>Very durable and fits perfectly in our small walk-in shower.</li>
      <li>This is exactly what I was looking for!  </li>
      <li>This chair was nice but it was too wide to fit my bath tub because of the angle of the legs.</li>
      <li>was expecting to be taller in height, is great folded but is much shorter then expected.</li>
      <li>Price was right</li>
      <li>it gave way right from under me.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know how many I looked at, but I found only 4 that gave any dimensions at all.  </li>
      <li>I used it the first time and it seemed to work until I try to fold it again and had to have my son do it for me</li>
      <li>The price is right and the shipping and handling are reasonable.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very sturdy and fits exactly in our shower.</li>
      <li>It is easy to open and fold.</li>
      <li>Seems very sturdy.  </li>
      <li>Suits my needs very well.</li>
      <li>Regarding the bench itself, it seems to be very sturdy and well-constructed, but mine will be returned for two reasons.  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t really need to fold it up every time.  </li>
      <li>I use this in a 4&#x27; x 4&#x27; stall shower and it fits very well.  </li>
      <li>and there is no way to really get a grip on either the bar or the seat at that spot to help with leverage.  </li>
      <li>This item was delivered only 3 days after ordering, a full 5 days before the first estimated delivery date.  </li>
      <li>For that reason, and because of the very reasonable shipping rate, I highly recommend ordering from this particular store.    </li>
      <li>and I don&#x27;t really trust that one because it specifically says that the \\&quot;footprint\\&quot; of 17.25 inches is measured from front leg to front leg, which is exactly the same as the one I just bought</li>
      <li>Doubt it would fit in a standard tub, too wide.</li>
      <li>this is a replacement for a 20 year old stool</li>
      <li>In general, I would suggest that anyone who is looking for a bench like</li>
      <li>The product was shipped very fast,I recieved it days before I expected it .</li>

<li> Since I received this one and was so disappointed that it did not fit, Ihave looked at every single bath bench on Amazon and placed all available options in my shopping cart in order to compare them to make sure that this doesn&#x27;t happen again.  </li>
<li> It fits in the tub well with room for the legs to rest flat on the tub bottom.</li>
<li> Opening the bench and placing it in the tub would be extremely easy, but folding it afterward is extremely difficult.  </li>
<li> Big help to those with limited flexibility or ability to stand for any length of time.</li>
<li> Minor Assembly required.  </li>
<li> I purchased this item because I have Fibromyalgia and cannot stand for long periods.</li>

<li> Because the rubber suction-cup feet add at least an inch to the necessary clearance, I could probably force the chair into place and it may work, but it would defeat the purpose of the suction cups</li>

<li> Legs could be a little longer</li>
<li> But as it turns out, the chair works well as a little seat in the bathroom when not in the tub.  </li>
<li> Once the cross-bar is snapped into place, it is very hard to pull it back out</li>
<li> I have had trouble with the folding part being too stiff for me to manage.  </li>
<li> (sorry to say that last part!).  </li>
<li> , it is EXTREMELY difficult to fold back up.</li>
<li> Because of the fact that it folds (which is a requirement for me), the rear legs are further apart than the front legs, so you need at least 21 inches clearance in the base of your tub for the bench to be seated properly.  </li>
<li> and he had a hard time folding it as well.</li>
<li> The seat connects at the center front, and you have to pull on one of the legs at either side which is very awkward and makes it very hard to break loose.  </li>
<li> THIS CHAIR WAS A LIFE SAVER FOR MY BAD BACK WHEN SHOWERING.</li>
<li> This may loosen over time, but I don&#x27;t like the idea of needing my husband to fold it every day (and it was even difficult for him).  </li>
<li> The base of my standard-sized tub measures 20 inches at the widest point.  </li>

<ol>
    <li> This is exactly what I was looking for!  I am going to be traveling and needed a folding shower seat.  Thank you!!</li>
    <li> Worked great for me after knee replacement surgery</li>
    <li> THIS CHAIR WAS A LIFE SAVER FOR MY BAD BACK WHEN SHOWERING. THE PRICE WAS GREAT ALSO.</li>
    <li> I purchased this item because I have Fibromyalgia and cannot stand for long periods. I used it the first time and it seemed to work until I try to fold it again and had to have my son do it for me and he had a hard time folding it as well. The third time I used the product I noticed that the legs were getting wider and I was getting lower, yeap it gave way right from under me. The product claims it holds up to 300 pounds NOT TRUE, I&#x27;m only 170 and it buckled. DO NOT BUY. I&#x27;m returning mine.</li>
    <li> This chair was nice but it was too wide to fit my bath tub because of the angle of the legs.</li>
    <li> great chair, sturdy, but didn&#x27;t think to measure the tub or the chair.  It&#x27;s a bit too big for the tub, but I can manage.</li>
    <li> This item was delivered only 3 days after ordering, a full 5 days before the first estimated delivery date.  For that reason, and because of the very reasonable shipping rate, I highly recommend ordering from this particular store.    Regarding the bench itself, it seems to be very sturdy and well-constructed, but mine will be returned for two reasons.  First, it doesn&#x27;t fit in my standard-sized tub.  Because of the fact that it folds (which is a requirement for me), the rear legs are further apart than the front legs, so you need at least 21 inches clearance in the base of your tub for the bench to be seated properly.  The base of my standard-sized tub measures 20 inches at the widest point.  Because the rubber suction-cup feet add at least an inch to the necessary clearance, I could probably force the chair into place and it may work, but it would defeat the purpose of the suction cups and I wouldn&#x27;t feel safe.

However, had the bench fit in my tub correctly, I would not have returned it because of this issue alone.    In general, I would suggest that anyone who is looking for a bench like this measure their tub before going any further, and not even consider ordering one that does not give very specific dimensions in the description.  Since I received this one and was so disappointed that it did not fit, Ihave looked at every single bath bench on Amazon and placed all available options in my shopping cart in order to compare them to make sure that this doesn&#x27;t happen again.  I don&#x27;t know how many I looked at, but I found only 4 that gave any dimensions at all.  Of those 4, only 1 is foldable and I don&#x27;t really trust that one because it specifically says that the \\&quot;footprint\\&quot; of 17.25 inches is measured from front leg to front leg, which is exactly the same as the one I just bought, so I am concerned that the rear legs would be too wide as well.</li>
    <li> This bench is well constructed. It also has adjustable legs and holds up to 300 lbs. It is easy to open and fold. Fits standard size tub without a problem. I am very pleased. Seller was a day late with delivery but no big deal. The price is right and the shipping and handling are reasonable. I am very pleased.</li>
    <li> The product was shipped very fast,I recieved it days before I expected it . this is a replacement for a 20 year old stool</li>
    <li> was expecting to be taller in height, is great folded but is much shorter then expected.</li>
    <li> Product is perfect for our needs. It&#x27;s very sturdy and fits exactly in our shower. It folds up and fits in the closet when not in use.</li>
    <li> We&#x27;d been searching awhile when we came across this shower seat.  Price was right, it fits our shower perfectly and the weight capacity given is accurate (sorry to say that last part!).  Came sooner than expected too.  Before ordering, don&#x27;t eyeball where it&#x27;s going to go - take accurate shower/tub measurements and account for curvatures.  Love that it&#x27;s easy to clean and folds up when not in use.  Big help to those with limited flexibility or ability to stand for any length of time.</li>
    <li> This chair fits nicely into my soaking bathtub.  I have had trouble with the folding part being too stiff for me to manage.  But as it turns out, the chair works well as a little seat in the bathroom when not in the tub.  I don&#x27;t really need to fold it up every time.  I&#x27;m very glad I bought it and it does just what I need it to do.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband who just had bypass surgery...it is fantastic. Very durable and fits perfectly in our small walk-in shower. My husband is 6&#x27;2&amp;#34; and weighs 272lbs and it supports him with no problem.</li>
    <li> Used almost once ended up on the shower floor did not hold up. Use at your own risk. Would not buy.</li>
    <li> It fits in the tub well with room for the legs to rest flat on the tub bottom. It folds easily. I bought some hooks so it can hang on the towel  rack at  the end of the  tub. Good buy.</li>
    <li> This works for when I need an occasional seat in my shower stall. I wish it folded a bit flatter for storage. I had hoped to be able to hang it, but that won&#x27;t work. It is sturdy and dries quickly.</li>
    <li> It works to my wife&#x27;s needs. It fits in our tub. It folds to store in the house or car when going out of town.</li>
    <li> My shower seat is very easy to assemble.  I use it at an aquatic center and have to store it in a locker, therefore I have to put it together and take it apart with each use.  This is very simple to do. It is sturdy and works well, I just wish it was a bit taller.  It is very low to the ground even set a high as it will go and is a little difficult for me to get up off of, but it works and now I don&#x27;t have to try to stand in the shower, something I am simply not capable of doing at this time.</li>
    <li> wider then standard tub, but is sturdy.</li>
    <li> We bought this seat for my mom for when she visits.  It worked great!  It&#x27;s sturdy and folds up to store.  Like some of the other reviews say, the legs don&#x27;t quite fit perfectly in our tub, but it is still very steady and had no problems using it in the tub.</li>
    <li> Minor Assembly required.  Seems very sturdy.  I weigh in at 235 lbs and held my weight with no problem.  Doubt it would fit in a standard tub, too wide. I use this in a 4&#x27; x 4&#x27; stall shower and it fits very well.  BEWARE,  while very easy to snap into place, it is EXTREMELY difficult to fold back up. There may be a trick to it, but I haven&#x27;t found it yet.  Suits my needs very well.</li>
    <li> this was nice bath seat but too  big for our shower.&lt;br /&gt;It was hard to open and close until my hubby took a look and remedied it in seconds</li>
    <li> Excellent value.  Easy to use and fold away.  Legs could be a little longer but I would purchase this item again.</li>
