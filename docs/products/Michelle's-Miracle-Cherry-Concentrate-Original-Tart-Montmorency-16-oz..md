      <li>/&gt;UPDATE, yet again 12/12/12&lt;br /&gt;The first time I ordered the tart cherry juice thru amazon from Vitacost, it was beautifully packaged.  </li>

      <li>Michelle&#x27;s Miracle is the most concentrated cherry juice I have tried.</li>
      <li>It&#x27; s one of the better concentrates out there.</li>
      <li>she is feeling much better...</li>
      <li>it helps me drink more water</li>
      <li>don&#x27;t feel like I can trust vitacost for any reorders of this product although I do love the product itself.</li>
      <li>It is not organic for one thing... who knows how many sprays and pesticides were used... AND the juice is in a toxic aluminum lining.</li>
      <li>Excellent product, but similar products can be found cheaper elsewhere.</li>
      <li>I love the taste of this stuff.  </li>
      <li>I just love this product, it was recommended to me by a co-worker as we both have gout &amp; problems sleeping.  </li>
      <li>Delivered by Amazon on time :)</li>
      <li>It seemed fresh and it tasted good.</li>
      <li>Just getting more water.</li>
      <li>Did i have more energy or anything?</li>
      <li>But I was hydrated :)</li>
      <li>This is a wonderful product that actually works.  </li>
      <li>Still enjoyed the flavor and will use what I bought</li>
      <li>I love this flavor.</li>
      <li>I think it worked, so I expect to purchase more of this item through Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I thought I had found the cure after so many years......</li>
      <li>It does however taste good, but not so sure it was worth the money since I am not getting the benefit I was hoping for.</li>
      <li>and I was able to sleep through the night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I love this concentrate.  </li>
      <li>so I am sure he will continue taking it.  </li>
      <li>Had it the very nect day!!!!</li>
      <li>Michelle&#x27;s Products are Body FRIENDLY!</li>
      <li>I am not kidding when I say after the first day I felt literally 85% better!  </li>
      <li>In the meantime, I have added it to a couple of my smoothies for added flavor and liked it very much.</li>
      <li>A great substitute for soda or juice and not bitter at all.</li>
      <li>rich and full of flavor!  </li>
      <li>It isn&#x27;t cheap though</li>
      <li>The flavor is great, the effect is the same, however the 4 bottles were shipped in a box with 1 air bag; they were dented on arrival but did not leak.</li>
      <li>Great for starting your day or any time just for an additional health supplement.</li>
      <li>I have no bloody clue.</li>
      <li>Ordered 4 bottles thru amazon (provided by vitacost and spending 50+ allowed me to get free shipping from them).  </li>
      <li>So not only do I have the pleasure of enjoying this yummy beverage every morning, but it is also very healthy</li>
      <li>I was sent the Joint Formula instead of the Cherry Concentrate Original which I did not order.  </li>
      <li>My diet is clean</li>
      <li>I have to special order cherry juice.</li>
      <li>This is my absolute favorite drink.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m Healthy and it just feels good when i mix this during the day with water and drink it down.</li>
      <li>Lucky to have found this product.</li>
      <li>She was told that it might help with inflammation, and thought it might be worth trying.  </li>
      <li>She kindly and correctly offered to not only replace the 4 bottles</li>
      <li>Taken consistently over a period of time, your quality of sleeps most definitely improves though not as strong a remedy for the joints, just my opinion.</li>
      <li>Very tasty!</li>
      <li>Was willing to try anything.</li>
      <li>Was using for sleep a while back and stopped using because I wasn&#x27;t really sure it was working.</li>
      <li>If you&#x27;re looking for something healthy, this is definitely something to try.  </li>
      <li>But is pretty pricey.</li>
      <li>While this cherry concentrate DID start helping my sleeping patterns and hot flashes within a week, it has been the continued use over the last two months that I see better results.</li>
      <li>is simply that it encourages you to drink more water.</li>
      <li>My hot flashes</li>
      <li>Health benefits like sleep, and other claims I am undecided, but being all natural is a very healthy alternative to juice.</li>
      <li>You just need a little bit mixed with seltzer water and you have the most refreshing drink ever.</li>
      <li>This really does work.  </li>
      <li>The whole cap will unscrew off the aluminum container without breaking a seal.</li>
      <li>Is this aluminum or stainless steel?</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s so rewarding to help other people.</li>
      <li>I am a retired nurse and when I see how it helps other people I am soooo pleased.</li>
      <li>The Joint Formula actually costs more but it tastes like a watered down version of the original.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend this product.</li>
      <li>i highly recommend any of her Product line for what DOES or DOESN&#x27;T &amp;#34;AIL&amp;#34;</li>
      <li>Maybe my hopes were too high.</li>
      <li>If it were a little more affordable, I would give it 5 stars.</li>
      <li>Overall, I will continue to purchase for my sleeping patterns and hot flashes.</li>
      <li>Simply put, I have far less pain when I take it, and more when I forget to take it.</li>
      <li>Was told it would help me sleep with the natural melatonin,but have not noticed any benefits.  </li>

    <li> I just love this product, it was recommended to me by a co-worker as we both have gout &amp; problems sleeping.  Taken consistently over a period of time, your quality of sleeps most definitely improves though not as strong a remedy for the joints, just my opinion.</li>
    <li> This really does work.  I have osteoarthritis and on a day trip, we stopped by this little restaurant and meat plant.  They told me about it so I bought a few sample packets.  After the 5th day, I was at the a health store where I bought a big bottle.  I have been using it ever since and it is a God send to me.</li>
    <li> It&#x27; s one of the better concentrates out there. Health benefits like sleep, and other claims I am undecided, but being all natural is a very healthy alternative to juice.</li>
    <li> This product mixed with mineral water is a tasty drink, but it also relieves my arthritis symptoms caused by taking Femara.</li>
    <li> Do not know if it will help my husband sleeping pattern, but does taste like eating a bowl of cherries. Do need to be careful not to use too much as it can be overpowering flavor</li>
    <li> steep $.  good product</li>
    <li> This concentrate does help me sleep better &amp; the flavor is delicious! I do recommend this supplement to family &amp; friends</li>
    <li> NEEDS TO BE ORGANIC! And specify the quality of container you choose to house it in! Is this aluminum or stainless steel?</li>
    <li> While this cherry concentrate DID start helping my sleeping patterns and hot flashes within a week, it has been the continued use over the last two months that I see better results. My hot flashes/night sweats are totally gone. I go into a deeper sleep and sleep through the night, waking up refreshed. I did not notice a decrease in inflammation on my baker&#x27;s cyst, but that has underlying issues of it&#x27;s own that I did not expect to solve with cherry concentrate. Overall, I will continue to purchase for my sleeping patterns and hot flashes. Anything else is an added bonus!</li>
    <li> My husband was diagnosed with gout many years ago and was put on meds. He only took them until that bout subsided, and then looked into alternatives. Whenever his symptoms seem to start bothering him, he takes one spoonful (it is kept in the freezer, and is very thick but does not freeze solid). He swears it \\&quot;loosens up\\&quot; his foot.</li>
    <li> Michelle&#x27;s Miracle is the most concentrated cherry juice I have tried. It seems to work the best on my arthritis.</li>
    <li> my mom had a problem on her knee and after she starts using this Cherry Concentrate she is feeling much better...I would recommend this product to my friends and family/...</li>
    <li> Excellent product!  If you&#x27;re looking for something healthy, this is definitely something to try.  Great for starting your day or any time just for an additional health supplement.</li>
    <li> Delivered by Amazon on time :) Product was well packaged, but the aluminum bottle suffered a minor dent :(, still, the content did not suffer. I was testing this natural product, since I read on a medical paper that it might help energize my aging system which also suffers from several herniated discs. I think it worked, so I expect to purchase more of this item through Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a second round of testing I might recommend it to my aging aching prone friends, and my captive audience.</li>
    <li> excellent quality, very tasty and good choice for my needs,will order this product again when i and in need of it</li>
    <li> I am feeling a lot less pain in my hip.  I plan to continue using tart cherry juice.</li>
    <li> This is your answer for inflammation.  Have terrible inflammation of foot due to a car accident. Couldn&#x27;t wear shoes anymore. Was distraught.  Saw an article in a Chicago paper. Was willing to try anything. Was so happy when this worked. So far I have told five people who use this product religiously like I do. It&#x27;s so rewarding to help other people. I am a retired nurse and when I see how it helps other people I am soooo pleased.</li>
    <li> This is my absolute favorite drink. You just need a little bit mixed with seltzer water and you have the most refreshing drink ever.</li>
    <li> It seems to work for us.</li>
    <li> Does it work? I have no bloody clue. Tastes great. But is pretty pricey. Im guessing why this might work is simply that it encourages you to drink more water. Thus you are more hydrated then usual as you&#x27;re probably chugging this one extra glass a day. Sometimes thats all its about. Just getting more water. Did i have more energy or anything? I dont think so. But I was hydrated :)</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful product that actually works.  My sisters and I all swear by it and tell everyone we know about it.</li>
    <li> This is the best product!!  Very tasty!</li>
    <li> This is certainly the best tasting cherry concentrate I&#x27;ve tried. Only issue I had was the \\&quot;sealed\\&quot; container caps don&#x27;t necessarily seal. The whole cap will unscrew off the aluminum container without breaking a seal. I emailed the company twice about this concern. Has been 2 months since I sent my inquiries and concerns. I never received a reply.</li>
    <li> Great!! Had it the very nect day!!!!</li>
    <li> I love this concentrate.  Just add to water and you have a nutritious drink during the day.  Lucky to have found this product.</li>
    <li> It makes a delicious, but expensive&amp;#34;Italian soda&amp;#34;.  It tastes just like yummy Trader Joe&#x27;s dried Montmorency cherries.  However, it doesn&#x27;t have any affect on osteoarthritis pain.</li>
    <li> After a long few years of constant pain and inflammation along with doctors telling me &amp;#34;you&#x27;re too young(46) to be having all these pains, I found a site that suggested this product.  I am not kidding when I say after the first day I felt literally 85% better!  The pain levels went from a 7/8 to a 3/4.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But ...........&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I went to the doctor for a checkup on something else and my blood pressure was 143/90.  Never had a problem with it before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also started noticing my weight jumped up 7 lbs in a week.  My diet is clean/Paleo as I am trying to reduce any outside problems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then the nightly severe heartburn hit while sleeping.  No matter what I did, I could not lay down and sleep without BAD heartburn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I stopped taking the concentrate and 2 days later my heartburn is gone and I was able to sleep through the night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I may search for another brand to help me because this one truly did take away my pain symptoms.  I thought I had found the cure after so many years......</li>
    <li> I love this flavor. I add it to water to get a different taste without the sugars. It also helps for sleep so I use it in evenings prior to going to sleep.</li>
    <li> We buy this product constantly. My husband hasn&#x27;t had gout since we started it. Though some gout sufferers may not get good results, it has helped him tremendously. We put about a tablespoon in a glass of water each morning. Sometimes I have one, too; it tastes GOOD.</li>
    <li> I have used this for some time and each time it is good.</li>
    <li> Excellent product, but similar products can be found cheaper elsewhere. Dr. Oz says it is an anti-imflammatory. Have only been drinking it for a week, too soon to realize effects, i think.</li>
    <li> I know this product helps a lot of people, but for me it had to much acitity in it and it effected my stomach negatively.  I had to stop using it.</li>
    <li> I get violent headaches when I use this juice. It is not organic for one thing... who knows how many sprays and pesticides were used... AND the juice is in a toxic aluminum lining. I contacted the company twice, asking why they will not go organic, and use better packaging... they will not respond. There are other brands of tart cherry juice- organic... less expensive and manufactured in glass. I will never purchase this again.</li>
    <li> excellent it helps me drink more water</li>
    <li> I liked the product but unfortunately it didn&#x27;t help my arthritis pain like I had hoped. I realize everyone is different and what works for some doesn&#x27;t always work for others. Good taste though and easy to take!</li>
    <li> Brought this brand in California this summer it the best to help me sleep. Not sold in Illilnois. I have to special order cherry juice.</li>
    <li> This all-natural non-sweetened 100% cherry juice concentrate is an excellent product that helps promote healthy joints and helps to reduce inflammation.  I notice a difference after using this product for 4 weeks.  It also tastes quite good.  I follow the directions approximately, using 1 tbsp concentrate to 8-10 oz filtered cold water.  That said, the packaging is terrible.  For some reason, it is very hard to keep the outside of the bottle clean.  The concentrate is always dripping down the sides of the bottle and gets messy and sticky.  So just be prepared for messy packaging and to wipe the kitchen counter and refrigerator shelves constantly when using this product.  The bottle lid should be redesigned to prevent the concentrate from running down the side of the bottle.</li>
    <li> Two bottles arrived so damaged that I can&#x27;t use them. I will need to return them. This means I am out of the cherry concentrate unless I can find some locally.&lt;br /&gt;Very disappointing.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband since he had been having bouts of insomnia.  He hasn&#x27;t taken it long enough for any definite results yet but he likes the tastes so I am sure he will continue taking it.  In the meantime, I have added it to a couple of my smoothies for added flavor and liked it very much.</li>
    <li> This is a really good product to help alleviate muscle pain.  A can lasts about a month. We mix it with other fruit juice.</li>
    <li> The product is as advertised although I do not know if it acts as an anti-inflammatory agent.  It seemed fresh and it tasted good.</li>
    <li> I was sent the Joint Formula instead of the Cherry Concentrate Original which I did not order.  This happened on two separate orders.  The Joint Formula actually costs more but it tastes like a watered down version of the original.</li>
    <li> Ordered 4 bottles thru amazon (provided by vitacost and spending 50+ allowed me to get free shipping from them).  It took a little longer than I thought it should but the bottles were packaged beautifully, sealed and wrapped in a way that gave me confidence.  I love the taste of this stuff.  It&#x27;s a concentrate and so, thick.  2 tablespoons into a glass of water or diet lemonade is great.  My favorite part is licking the spoon I used to measure.  Tastes like very tart and wonderful cherry pie to me, despite the fact that there is no added sugar.  I&#x27;m hoping it will help with my arthritis.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE 11/14/12:&lt;br /&gt;Yep, it works. Simply put, I have far less pain when I take it, and more when I forget to take it. Am about to order more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE, yet again 12/12/12&lt;br /&gt;The first time I ordered the tart cherry juice thru amazon from Vitacost, it was beautifully packaged.  Each of the 4 bottles was individually bubble wrapped and then a puff plastic pack large enough to fill the remainder of the space was inserted.  The bottles were perfect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The second order of 4 bottles was terrible.  The bottles arrived badly dented and damaged, as another reviewer had noted. The packaging was so careless!  The metal bottles were thrown into a badly torn ziplock bag and one small and completely deflated puff plastic was uselessly tossed in.  I called vitacost and asked to talk to a supervisor so I could tell her about the horrible packaging.  She kindly and correctly offered to not only replace the 4 bottles but she also assured me she would speak to the warehouse about the packaging.  Unfortunately, again, I received 4 damaged metal bottles (although not a complete loss as the last order) that had been carelessly tossed into a zip lock bag with little extra filler in the box.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t feel like I can trust vitacost for any reorders of this product although I do love the product itself.</li>
    <li> Did not get the relief I was told I would get. Maybe my hopes were too high. Still enjoyed the flavor and will use what I bought</li>
    <li> Was using for sleep a while back and stopped using because I wasn&#x27;t really sure it was working. Was having trouble sleeping so purchased again. Not awake in the middle of the night for a couple of hours any longer. Must be the concentrate that&#x27;s doing it.</li>
    <li> Michelle&#x27;s Products are Body FRIENDLY! This is 100% Natural. i highly recommend any of her Product line for what DOES or DOESN&#x27;T &amp;#34;AIL&amp;#34; you. I&#x27;m Healthy and it just feels good when i mix this during the day with water and drink it down. Very Refreshing. I also drink this at night, it&#x27;s soothing..A+++++</li>
    <li> Tart cherry juice is excellent for arthritis.  So not only do I have the pleasure of enjoying this yummy beverage every morning, but it is also very healthy - how often does that happen?  Highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I actually order this for my mother  She was told that it might help with inflammation, and thought it might be worth trying.  She thinks that it does help in decreasing her pain level, to some degree, and it tastes good, so isn&#x27;t hard to get down.  It also has the added benefit of providing a natural source of melatonin, which helps her sleep.  She did have a little digestive upset after a week or so, but she cut back for a few days, then went back up to her regular dose, with no problems since.  This is the thick, concentrated stuff, not the watered down stuff that some brands are.  If it were a little more affordable, I would give it 5 stars.</li>
    <li> This is a great product and for those that have a taste for the tart cherry, its very full and good.  Unfortunately it seems the product is either in short supply or the company is having time filling their orders. If they ever get the supply chain straighten out, I&#x27;ll continue to buy. It isn&#x27;t cheap though but in this case you pay for what you get</li>
    <li> The tart cherry juice seems to keep my arthritic pain in check, my last subscription was in a plastic bottle, (that did leak), however this other brand was discontinued and I used Michelle&#x27;s as a substitute. The flavor is great, the effect is the same, however the 4 bottles were shipped in a box with 1 air bag; they were dented on arrival but did not leak. My question is about the metal bottle: is there a liner, was the liner damaged in shipping?</li>
    <li> Was told it would help me sleep with the natural melatonin,but have not noticed any benefits.  It does however taste good, but not so sure it was worth the money since I am not getting the benefit I was hoping for.</li>
    <li> rich and full of flavor!  will purchase again.  A great substitute for soda or juice and not bitter at all.</li>
