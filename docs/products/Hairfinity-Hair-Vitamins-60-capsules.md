<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I like Hairfinity Hair Vitamins - it controls breakage and helps to have a nice shine!</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t seen much of a difference in the normal growth I have every month.</li>
    <li> ACNE!!! This pill was helpful with my hair growth but it gave me horrible acne. I purchased this pill because I&#x27;m getting married in the fall and wanted to grow my hair for the wedding.  I found an It Works distributor through Instagram and purchased Hair Skin Nails from her website. The supplement is ALL NATURAL and so far my hair has grown 2 inches in 5 weeks!! I&#x27;M SO EXCITED! My acne is clear and my hair is much thicker too and my nails have never been stronger and longer. Her website is kmstarks.myitworks. com. I only pay $33 for the pills and they&#x27;re so worth it!!</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t notice a difference in hair growth but did notice more acne breakouts.</li>
    <li> Planning to buy itagain</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product off and on for about 6yrs now. I absolutely love it. Put aside the amazing growth rate, and you will see and feel a huge difference. I know I have! This is the softest, longest, very strong, shiniest hair I&#x27;ve had since grade school! I love this product and will continue to use it for years to come! (I just wish it&#x27;d get here faster!). &amp;#34; )</li>
    <li> Love these...already seeing results</li>
    <li> Although the vitamins work for me . It is less expensive if you purchase them from their website . Wish I did The research better.</li>
    <li> Some of the pills were dried up and open but it was still a steal vs getting 30 for 25 on the hairfinity website.</li>
    <li> Item arrived as described and it was shipped quickly!  I am a happy customer!</li>
    <li> I just started using hairfinity,So as of right now,I haven&#x27;t seen any changes in the growth of my hair,but I will keep you posted.As a result,I keep hearing negative things about it,but I keep in mind these vitamins aren&#x27;t for everyone..So just so you know ,I&#x27;m not much of a negative person..The only thing I will say is that water isn&#x27;t my favorite drink,but thats all I been drinking so I will keep healthy skin,and hair... They do seem to  dry out my mouth,but water rejuvenates;-) One star for now,until results of growing my hair is seen..</li>
    <li> I have bought three bottles and still going strong</li>
    <li> It was easy, fast and on time just how I like it.</li>
    <li> Love it, awesome shipping!</li>
    <li> Just like regular vitamins to me</li>
    <li> Have been using it for 30 days.&lt;br /&gt;So far my finger nails have grown.&lt;br /&gt;I see no difference in hair growth yet.</li>
    <li> These vitamins are wonderful,my hair looks and feels great.</li>
    <li> So far, so good. On my second bottle.</li>
    <li> Took for a month, saw no change whatsoever, :(</li>

    <li> Maybe some difference but not much.. I rather use biotin by its self.</li>
    <li> Got it on time and it&#x27;s been working great</li>
    <li> It was for my Girl she love it! I get it fast thank you</li>
    <li> Very easy process to select and to order thank you :)</li>
    <li> No it did not work for me.. I have clear skin then all of a sudden I started taking the vitamins and i started breaking out. I will stick to my normal regimen. I was just being greedy.Ladies the most important regimen for hair growth is patience.</li>
    <li> It gave me horrible acne!!</li>
    <li> Results are not as drastic as the before and after pics i have seen. Note i have not died my hair or cut it since I&#x27;ve used these. I also use a good shampoo and conditioner to help and even still i didn&#x27;t notice a difference in my length. But everyone&#x27;s hair is different. I don&#x27;t think its worth the money so far.</li>
    <li> Hairfinity really works!!</li>
    <li> I noticed hair growth within three weeks of using this product. This is a great  product and I will continue to use it!</li>
    <li> very happy with product</li>
    <li> I love it, it really works!</li>
    <li> they seem to be working so far. almost ready for my second bottle</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t really seen results yet.</li>
    <li> don&#x27;t really know how good or bad it really is because my sister didn&#x27;t want my niece to use it, so that&#x27;s why I sent it back.</li>
    <li> Every time I order these vitamins,  my hair grows immediately.  Strength,  quality, thickness and shine are all the things that Hairfinity provides. I love these pills especially since I tend to cut my hair every year because I change up my look alot.</li>
    <li> No complaints so far with this product. Kind of difficult to tell if it works. Can be a little pricey if used often do a tip would be to find the ingredients and buy elsewhere.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for almost 2 months now I have can say that even my hair dresser said she notice that my hair texture feel thicker ans my hair looks a lot healthier than 2 months ago when she braid it for me ..Am going natural so this is just what I needed ..I can see the difference also ..I pair this up with biotin and castor and garlic oil also</li>
    <li> It works wonders on my hair</li>
    <li> I can see the results already.  My chair is full and thick the way it use to be.</li>
    <li> I really doesn&#x27;t see much of a difference in the length of my hair.  I did notice that while using this product my face was fI&#x27;ll ed with acne.  As soon as I stopped using the product, my face cleared up.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m excited!  It&#x27;s working for me. I&#x27;ve used it before and always gotten good results.</li>
    <li> Not satisfied at all....</li>
    <li> Love my results. I have thicker and fuller hair.</li>
