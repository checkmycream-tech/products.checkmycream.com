    <li> Item as described. Fast ship. Good buy.</li>
    <li> I like the convenient plastic case these replacement rollers are packaged in. It is very easy to open and store the extra rollers.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t last as long as name brand, but then a bit cheaper in price.  I found that a detail sander works much better and is a lot cheaper.</li>
    <li> Thia ia not even close the the quality of the  rollers that came from the manufacturer. They are not coarse but extra fine sandpaper.</li>
    <li> I have had a Emjoi Micro Pedi for about 4 yrs and it is the best product for the feet I have ever owned - the little courser replacements work just wonderful.  Highly recommend this item!!</li>

    <li> Doesn&#x27;t fit the emjoi micro pedi as well as the name brand. It seems to drag when spinning. Also does not have as much texture so it doesn&#x27;t last as long. I will buy the original name brand in the future.</li>
