<li> So Soft by Avon.</li>
<li> Keeps skin soft.</li>
<li> bought insect repellents are so harsh and have such a strong chemical smell.</li>
<li> I faithfully bought the Skin So Soft body lotion product line because of the silky feeling it gives my skin when my natural oils have been washed away from my hands and feet due to showering or getting my hands wet.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve been using this as a bug repellent for these hot Houston nights and so far it&#x27;s been fabulous!</li>
<li> Smell doesn&#x27;t last long</li>
<li> Suggest putting on immediately after patting dry following your shower.</li>
<li> Works as long as I USE it</li>
<li> I&#x27;m only rating it four stars because I still have some bug bites, but it is extremely rainy here</li>
<li> Seems to help dry skin a lot.</li>
<li> Careful using it in the tub or could get slippery.</li>
<li> I use in after my shower when my skin is still wet.</li>
<li> Bought for my daughter because I had heard it was good as a mosquito/bug repellent as the other store</li>
<li> It seems like everytime Avon redesigns the bottle they change the formula a little.</li>
<li> It was too much trouble mixing.</li>
<li> but still get a few bites.</li>
<li> Its missing that silky feeling.</li>
<li> if you are looking for a thick jojoba lotion, this is not it!</li>
<li> This new formula no longer contains citronella so did not work as a bug repellent.</li>
<li> So Soft and worked both as a body lotion and bug repellent.  </li>
<li> Unfortunately this wasn&#x27;t it.  </li>
<li> Disappointed in this.  </li>
<li> I had hoped it was a bug repellent?  </li>
<li> If you are buying this for its mosquito repellent properties, don&#x27;t.  </li>
<li> Fragrance is awful....</li>
<li> I&#x27;m using this as an insect repellent on a trip to Costa Rica on the recommendation of a friend, and it&#x27;s working well!  </li>

    <li> I haven&#x27;t used this in years! it&#x27;s just as I remembered! I like the smell &amp; my skin is super soft! &amp; there&#x27;s always that added plus of it keeping bugs away! that always helps, especially as we approach summer months! I&#x27;m very happy with it!</li>
    <li> Have used this for years.  very good.</li>
    <li> I use it to keep the bugs away...not for body lotion...works great for gnats and mosquitoes</li>
    <li> The smell is light and the lotion itself feels great. Just wish it smelled like the sunscreen I used to use of this brand. Smell doesn&#x27;t last long it seems. But still feels good and does what it&#x27;s made to do.</li>
    <li> goes on smoothly with no greasy feel. absorbs very easily and keeps my skin soft. Added benefit of being an insect repellant is a plus. Sure beats the smell of bug repellant. Will buy again.</li>
    <li> No matter what Avon says, this stuff works against sand flys.</li>
    <li> I had hoped it was a bug repellent?  Avon does make this type of product.  Unfortunately this wasn&#x27;t it.  The product wasn&#x27;t worth it in my opinion</li>
    <li> Repels mosquitoes and is is very soothing for all kinds of bug bites. We must have this on hand always!</li>
    <li> Works well and doesn&#x27;t leave oily residue after application.  Use it on the golf course.  Keep a supply in my golf bag.</li>
    <li> This is NOT the scent of the original Skin So Soft by Avon. Why do they feel they have to change a good thing. I couldn&#x27;t find the original anywhere and I thought this would smell the same but it doesn&#x27;t. It must the Jojoba they added. Avon will not get my business again.</li>
    <li> Great purchase and super-fast shipping.  Would not hesitate to use this seller again.  Thank you.</li>
    <li> A co-worker told me about this and I just had to try it!  It&#x27;s true it really does work! My daughter took it camping and had no run in with mosquitoes!</li>
    <li> I like the original Avon Skin So Soft formula better than this new Jojoba oil formula. I faithfully bought the Skin So Soft body lotion product line because of the silky feeling it gives my skin when my natural oils have been washed away from my hands and feet due to showering or getting my hands wet. Its missing that silky feeling. It seems like everytime Avon redesigns the bottle they change the formula a little. It seems to be the ingredient they use to give your skin that silky feeling.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m using this as an insect repellent on a trip to Costa Rica on the recommendation of a friend, and it&#x27;s working well!  Has a pleasant fragrance that is not overwhelming and of course, much nicer than actual bug spray!  I&#x27;m only rating it four stars because I still have some bug bites, but it is extremely rainy here so I think it is doing the job overall!</li>
    <li> if you are looking for a thick jojoba lotion, this is not it! The up side, it does absorb quickly on the skin.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this as a bug repellent for these hot Houston nights and so far it&#x27;s been fabulous! I hear others whining about bugs but I put this on before I left the house and I&#x27;m doing fine!</li>
    <li> super. would use seller again</li>
    <li> I love this product. The scent is nice but not overwhelming. I use in after my shower when my skin is still wet. Seems to help dry skin a lot.</li>
    <li> I always loved the smell of this lotion.  It has been years since I purchased a bottle and realized the smell is not as good as it use to be.</li>
    <li> Great lotion!  Great with Skin so Soft oil!</li>
    <li> Excellent product to keep the mosquitos away. that&#x27;s what I bought it for.  Works as long as I USE it that is.  Too often I forget.</li>
    <li> Disappointed in this.  I like the body oil better.  Smelled different to me.</li>
    <li> love the product great price</li>
    <li> If you are buying this for its mosquito repellent properties, don&#x27;t.  This is not as strong a scent as regular Skin so Soft and doesn&#x27;t do as good a job driving away mosquitos.  Get the original more oil-like Skin so Soft because that works GREAT.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are using it for body lotion, that&#x27;s an entirely different matter.</li>
    <li> I got this quickly, thank you. I bought it to use on my dog, to help with itching. It was too much trouble mixing. But I will try again next summer.</li>
    <li> Fragrance is awful....</li>
    <li> Excellent product! Bought for my daughter because I had heard it was good as a mosquito/bug repellent as the other store bought insect repellents are so harsh and have such a strong chemical smell. It works great with the body spray! She loves it and is mosquito bite free!</li>
    <li> It seems to work to keep off mosquitos</li>
    <li> Good product.  Keeps bugs off you too</li>
    <li> I purchased this product because years ago I used Avon Skin So Soft and worked both as a body lotion and bug repellent.  Unfortunately they changed the formula, the old SSS contained oil of citronella which was fabulous at keeping the mosquitos away.  This new formula no longer contains citronella so did not work as a bug repellent. It is a nice lotion however if your looking for this to keep the bugs away it does work.</li>
    <li> It is wonderful to have the Avon product so easy to order and to know that it will arrive as quickly as it did. I love this product and will continue to use it every day!</li>
    <li> Smells good and seems to keep the mosquitos away</li>
    <li> Great product especially for the bugs in the Caribbean&#x27;s</li>
    <li> don&#x27;t not buy you will not get your product</li>
    <li> Seems to be ok. . . but I don&#x27;t think I will be buying it again!</li>
    <li> Choose this lotion because heard lots of good things about it......and agree.....it is great....leaves the skin nice and smooth, has a very nice and not overpowering smell...</li>
    <li> I am a mosquito magnet . .they find me . .. this is the only lotion/bug repellant I use.  Highly recommend if you want to avoid bites.</li>
    <li> Have been using this product for years and love it. Keeps skin soft. Suggest putting on immediately after patting dry following your shower. Careful using it in the tub or could get slippery.</li>
    <li> Man, this stuff is great for bod after bathing, and I have bought a lot of lotions during my life.  Don&#x27;t like the price of shipping but it really is great stuff.</li>
    <li> silky smooth and not greasy</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for most of my like and love it! It keeps my skin healthy!</li>
    <li> Love this product, leaves &amp;#34;skin so soft&amp;#34;!</li>
    <li> Purchased as mosquito repellant. Works okay but still get a few bites. Smell is pleasant.</li>
