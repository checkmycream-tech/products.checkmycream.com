      <li>I am so glad I could find it at a great price and buy it in bulk.  </li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t work for &amp;#34;hand sanitizing&amp;#34; since it doesn&#x27;t contain the alcohol needed, but as a moisturizer, it is a very light and smooth moisturizer that leaves your skin feeling great without excess oil or dryness!!</li>
      <li>Love it!</li>

      <li>It cleans your hands but acts like a nice lightweight lotion.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s basically just like applying hand lotion, so feels nice</li>
      <li>I tried this product at a friend&#x27;s house and really liked it.  </li>
      <li>Great thing to have when you have to clean your hands a lot as in patient care, home care etc.</li>
      <li>Also nice to remove crusty patches under their tails without hurting them and while it cleans my hands it also gives my goats soft udders with excellent skin condition.</li>
      <li>The smell is light and pleasant.  </li>
      <li>Just as a reminder though, hand sanitizer should not be used as a substitute for good hand washing unless soap and water aren&#x27;t available.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s the best lotion to keep handy around the house: not only it keeps your hands moist but also sanitized!&lt;br</li>
      <li>This is our favorite hand sanitizer.</li>
      <li>I work in health care and have to sanitize many times (probably hundreds of times) per shift.</li>
      <li>It is especially great for those in the medical field or are caretakers.  </li>
      <li>I love using this product.</li>
      <li>The alcohol in most after shaves dries my skin.</li>
      <li>My favorite hand sanitizer.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Very good moisturizer but best of all a hand sanitizer.</li>
    <li> It feels really great on my hands and this product makes them feel soft for a long time.</li>
    <li> Been looking to gift from a friend. Keep in door panel of the car and use frequently as sanitizer before eating and lotion for dry skin. Also use on leather steering wheel and spot on seats.</li>
    <li> sanitizes and moisturizes at the same time.  No greasy feeling.  Works well on the medication cart, so slippery feeling or dropping of products.</li>
    <li> Not sure if Gold Bond has disontinued this product because I can&#x27;t find it anywhere in town.  I This goes on like a hand moisturizer but is non-greasy.  I have used this product where I work in a warehouse environment for 3 years and have never even had a serious cold which I contribute to this product killing the germs before I touch my work area.  Highly recommended</li>
    <li> Make sure you have this wonderful lotion on hand before school starts and most definitely before cold and flu season returns.</li>
    <li> Amazing moisturizer and antibacterial! I often touch my face after applying lotion and this does not break out my skin! Was a bath and body works handi-bac user until they stopped making it. This is just as good! Love it!</li>
    <li> Most hand sanitizers are very drying but this product feels more like a moisturizing lotion than a sanitizer.  I have always found Gold Bond products to be of highest quality.</li>
    <li> I love this product, I am a nurse and it saves my hands in the winter.</li>
    <li> As a mother of two young children, I have become a total germophobe and try every hand sanitizer I can find.  This one is fantastic and will be the only one I use from now on. First of all, it is not alcohol-based so I don&#x27;t have to worry about using it on the little ones. Secondly, it is like a hand cream!  The texture and scent are light and it really does moisturize. Most hand sanitizers leave my hands so dry and rough all winter long, but this one works like hand cream and leaves my hands so soft. I knit and dry skin snags on yarn...this has alleviated that snagging. I love  it.</li>
    <li> LOVE this product. Can&#x27;t find it in the stores anymore. I bought several bottles on Amazon. It is effective at killing germs and yet gentle on my hands. Cracked, dry winter hands no more!</li>
    <li> I was very please with my order of gold bond hand sanitizer however in search of eclipse 60 pk gum your price in entirely to high.  Purchaseing the  gum out of the stores are cheaper and much cheaper when they are on sell.  I would review your price range</li>
    <li> I INITIALLY BOUGHT THIS PRODUCT FROM ANOTHER SOURCE.  IT CLEANS NICELY WITHOUT WATER AND DOES A GREAT JOB MOISTURIZING.  I HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT.  I USE IT WHEN I&#x27;M UNABLE TO WASH MY HANDS USING SOAP &amp; WATER, IN SUCH SITUATIONS AS SHOPPING, OFFICES, FAST FOOD DRIVE-THROUGH, ETC.  I USED SEVERAL DIFFERENT PRODUCTS OF THIS KIND, AND I LIKE THIS THE MOST.  I&#x27;VE HAD NO TOUCH-RELATED COMMUNICABLE DISEASES SUCH AS COLDS, FLU, OR PNEUMONIA SINCESTARTED USING IT.</li>
    <li> Amazing. Makes your nails grow rapidly too</li>
    <li> I work in the medical field and I am huge on hand washing.  I wash my hands all the time.  Soap is so drying.  I was so pleased to stumble across this product.  It is like putting hand cream on, instead of hand sanitizer.  This is what my four year old also uses in the rest room, instead of washing her hands and running the water for 10 minutes.  Comes with a pack of  3, so these will last you a very long time.  I also felt that one pump was too much, so I took two of my daughters hair binders and wrapped them around the part of the neck that dispenses the amount of lotion that you get, reducing the amount of hand sanitizer that comes out.</li>
    <li> As a medical provider who sees up to 25 sick people each day, getting sick with a viral illness every 4-6 weeks used to be an occupational hazard for me.  I was washing my hands thirty times a day to no avail, all it did was give me dry cracked hands all winter long.  This stuff is terrific-- made a huge difference in my life....</li>
    <li> Love this lotion.  Finally a lotion that is also a hand sanitizer!</li>
    <li> I really love this product!  My elderly mother, who has dementia, lives with us.  She was insulted when we tried to use the regular hand sanitizers, and those seemed to burn her hands.  Now, we just tell her, &amp;#34;Let&#x27;s put lotion on your hands;&amp;#34; and she&#x27;s very agreeable to that.  We use it as well, but put it on Mother&#x27;s hands many times a day.  I&#x27;m so grateful someone came up with this idea.  I prefer this sanitizing lotion over others because it has little or no fragrance.  Fragrance passes onto food, making it far less appetizing.  That&#x27;s not a problem with this Gold Bond lotion.  Also, it is easily absorbed.  I like that it IS moisturizing Mother&#x27;s hands, too.  I can&#x27;t find this product locally anymore, so I&#x27;m very grateful that amazon.com has it; and it&#x27;s cheaper than the price we were paying when we could buy it locally.</li>
    <li> I love this lotion. It&#x27;s hard to believe you&#x27;re getting germ killing along with soft hands. It doesn&#x27;t seem to irritate hands no matter what. As far as hand sanitizers go, this is the cadillac of them all. They make a couple of versions of this sanitizers, and their all wonderful.</li>
    <li> I have had terrible eczema on my hands since childhood - all soaps, including &amp;#34;hypoallergenic&amp;#34; soaps, irritate my hands and just make them worse. This is the only product I&#x27;ve found where I can clean my hands all day long with it and it does not irritate my eczema at all. In fact, my eczema seems better than ever since using this product in place of soap. (Note : I only use it on my hands - not all over!)</li>
    <li> I do dialysis at home and need to have very clean hands.  Gold Bond is easy to use and doesn&#x27;t make my hands red and sore like most sanitizers after frequent use.  In fact, it feels good enough to use as an efficient hand cream even if it were not an antibacterial sanitizer.  As a combination it works wonderfully.  One issue:  The pump container - like many other cream products - does not allow me to use the sanitizer down to the last drop.  I would love to have the cream in a tub container.  Excellent product!</li>
    <li> These are no longer sold in stores and I am so glad I can get it here! I use hand sanitizer a lot as a mom and using this helps me keep my hands clean and soft.</li>
    <li> We keep this everywhere (the kitchen, bathrooms, the car, etc.).  Disinfects and moisturizes, too.  The best/only product that I&#x27;ve found in its class.</li>
    <li> This is the best product for me.  I am so glad I could find it at a great price and buy it in bulk.  I use the bottles at every sink in the house.  The mild fragrance, the 7 moisturizers and the fact that it is Alcohol-Free gives me the peace of mind that I have eliminated most of the germs(kills 99.9% of common germs), have kept my hands from cracking due to overwashing with an antibacterial soap and am not passing alcohol from my hands to the skin of a baby or anyone else.  My hands cannot tolerate the roughness of paper towels in public restrooms so I carry tubes of this product in my purse.  The best price for this product makes me a happy customer.</li>
    <li> First sign of winter means dry, cracking, itchy dry hands. Add the traditional sanitizers to avoid the flu and it&#x27;s disaster. This stuff solves both problem. I can use as much as I want and it doesn&#x27;t dry me out, and it must help with the flu &#x27;cause I never get it.</li>
    <li> Much better than the gel sanitzer&#x27;s. I use them in my classroom and the students like the lotion.  As a lotion, I only need to use it once in the morning and my hands are not dry looking.  As a sanitzer I do not mind using this three or four times a day.  Great product!</li>
    <li> Love it. This is my second bottle.</li>
    <li> Great product....use this at home and in my office at work.</li>
    <li> Many sanitizers say they have vitamin e or other moisturizers...they don&#x27;t seem like a moisturizer when I use them. This is a lotion (that I assume) that sanitizes. My family loves this stuff.</li>
    <li> I have a skin sensitivity problem and cannot tolerate repeated use of most chemical lotions, including almost all deodorants.  This stuff does not bother me, and i actually use it on my pits with some success.</li>
    <li> The sheet grippers were terrible.  They were hard ato attach, did not hold and one of them broke awhile I was trying to attach it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Gold Bond Hand Saniatizer is great.  I have replaced all my lotions with it because it keeps my skin moisterized as well as sanitized.</li>
    <li> When we were awaiting the arrival home of our twins from the NICU, I wanted to make sure we had some sanitizer around the house, but wanted something that was moisturizing since we would be using it frequently.  I love this kind - it feels like lotion and a little goes a long way.  We keep one next to where we change diapers, and one in our living room.  I plan to bring the third one up to work.  Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> This is the best hand sanitizer for my hands.  It does not chew up my skin like regular hand sanitizers do!  Love it!</li>
    <li> This *seemed* like a great idea when we first bought it, and even tried a sample of it, but within a week the smell of it really got on my nerves and we had to give the rest of it away! Sort of a sickly sweet smell, hard to describe . . . we had to give the rest of it away :-(</li>
    <li> This is a very good product.   I assume it is killing as advertised. I work in health care and have to sanitize many times (probably hundreds of times) per shift. While the smell is not my favorite, my hands were much less chapped after a week of work with this product. It is sticky for awhile after application, even after much rubbing into the skin.   A step in the right direction!</li>
    <li> I use in place of after shave. The alcohol in most after shaves dries my skin. This helps moisturize it.</li>
    <li> I really like that this hand sanitizer also has a moisturizer in it.  Our hands do not feel &#x27;dried out&#x27; like when using alcohol based sanitizers.</li>
    <li> Gold Bond Hand Sanitizer and moisturizer is different from other sanitizers.  Never leaves your hands dry and scaly - even in the winter - use and your hands are sanitized and soft.</li>
    <li> This product is the perfect hand sanitizer.  It is creamy and &amp;#34;lotiony&amp;#34; so you don&#x27;t get dry hands after using it.  Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> Let me start by saying Amazon kicks butt in the ordering and shipping department; items arrive on time and in great shape. I began working in a Library about a year ago and immediately noticed the amount of sick folks coming in and out of the building.  Because you never know where a book has been, I quickly decided hand sanitizer was needed.  There was already a bottle, but it contained alcohol which makes my hands peel and crack.  I had a bottle of Gold Bond at home so I purchased another for work.  Just for the heck of it, I put it up on the counter where the patrons place and pick up the books.  It took only 2 weeks for folks to start using it and then with a very surprised look on their face tell me \\&quot;this stuff is great, hand sanitizer and moisturizer all in one, who knew! I need it for home, where do I get it?\\&quot; and a year later, I have patrons who once before never looked at the hand sanitizer in front of them, ask me where the bottle went if I just happen move it from it original counter spot. (I did it as a test once to see if they really liked it) I do advise folks of its cost, but so far, not one has complained when they have purchased it. THANKS GOLD BOND!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PS Believe it or not, the kids like it also, they&#x27;ll sometimes ask for \\&quot;a squirt\\&quot; before their parents do!!!</li>
    <li> As a nurse I appreciate clean hands, but I don&#x27;t appreciate the icky, dry skin that comes with hand sanitizers. This product has managed to do it all! The front of the product says \\&quot;Non-drying\\&quot; which I will attest to. After using this product intermittently for a few weeks (with hand washing before eating, after using bathroom) my hands feel great compared to how they feel with alcohol based sanitizers. My hands don&#x27;t feel gunky like some other moisturizing sanitizers. There is very little residue left, so you can use it 3-5 times before you feel you need to wash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have bought a bunch of the little 1 oz bottles of these for storing in my car, locker, purse, ect. and have a few big bottles for home. Not only is this product great, but I love all the Gold Bond lotion products I have tried. When my hands need a little moisture boost I lather up some Gold Bond Ultimate Skin Therapy Lotion and notice my hands feel much better.</li>
    <li> Great thing to have when you have to clean your hands a lot as in patient care, home care etc. situations.&lt;br /&gt;Your hands do not get dried out by using just sanitizer products alone.</li>
    <li> I normally hate hand sanitizer because it really dries out my skin. I am pregnant and don&#x27;t want to catch anyone&#x27;s viruses this winter so I thought that this would be great on my desk at work, at home in the kitchen and in the baby&#x27;s room. Works like lotion and kills the germs!</li>
    <li> I love that this is a moisturizer and sanitizer in one- I&#x27;m a teacher with a chalkboard, so I need both.  Unfortunately since it is a moisturizer, it doesn&#x27;t evaporate off your skin, so it takes much longer to dry than an alcohol based one.  This leaves your hands sticky and gross for a few minutes.  I suppose if I had slightly drier hands, this would be less of a problem.</li>
    <li> I purchased this after reading reviews and Gold Bond Hand Sanitizer lives up to the claims.  I live in Michigan and this winter has been brutal.  I noticed the lady who delivers my mail had extremely irritated skin.  The cold and handling all the packages are rough on the postmen.  I gave her a bottle and she told me a month later it is the best product she has ever used.  Her skin looks less red and smoother.&lt;br /&gt;So I gave another to my sister (who doesn&#x27;t like anything) and she was dismissive when I asked her how it worked for her.  So I started asking her to give it back.  After a few weeks she had to admit that she loved the product and wouldn&#x27;t give it up. :)&lt;br /&gt;My only reservation is the petrolatum in the formula.  I don&#x27;t know that I believe the bad hype going around about it as Vaseline has been a great protectant forever.  But, as a person who has been exposed to too many bad chemicals, I am cautious, so I mention it so others are aware before they purchase this Gold Bond Hand Sanitizer.</li>
    <li> As new parents who needed a quick sanitizer for diaper changes, my husband and I wanted something other than the alcohol-based hand sanitizers that dry skin, especially bad during Chicago winters.  Luckily, this worked well and definitely moisturized too.  It has a somewhat strong scent, but it&#x27;s not too bad.</li>
    <li> I am pregnant and was constantly washing my hands and using antibacterial gel.  My hands started to crack and bleed because they became so dry.  Instead of the gel, I use the hand sanitizing moisturizer and haven&#x27;t looked back.  Love it!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m super serious when I say that this is a breakthrough product. I was actually really shocked when I got this product, I kept checking over and over again that this hand lotion is actually also sanitizing my hands as well as moisturizing them; it didn&#x27;t make sense to me, but it does that!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m sold; I will continue repurchasing this over and over again, and I recommend you do the same.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a hand sanitizer that didn&#x27;t dry my hands. This product does just that. However, it can be rather greasy.</li>
    <li> It is impossible to find these in any store!  I am an invalid, and I cannot reach the sink.  These clean as well as moisturizer my hands, and, since I have psoriasis, the moisturizer is a must.  Thank you so much for carrying this product.</li>
    <li> It was exactly what I ordered. I love Gold Bond moisturizing hand sanitizer. As a nurse it keeps my hands sanitized and soft.</li>
    <li> Great product, doesn&#x27;t dry hands out,  but it&#x27;s hard to find!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s the best lotion to keep handy around the house: not only it keeps your hands moist but also sanitized!&lt;br /&gt;It absorbs easily leaving no residue nor greasy feeling</li>
    <li> I love this product because it does not dry out your skin and sanitizes at the same time.. Drugstores are always out of it so I had to get it on Amazon. Once you use it once, you will vever use the other alcohol brands again.</li>
    <li> I love this! It&#x27;s different than most sanitizers. It&#x27;s creamy with no noticeable scent.&lt;br /&gt;I get compliments from my guests.  I highly recommend Gold Bond!</li>
    <li> I have just started using this, but it is much better on my hands than the alcohol-based sanitizers that I have been using for some time.  In fact, this seems so soothing, I have a hard time believing that it sanitizes, too.</li>
    <li> I had been searching for this size of the product which I used in the smaller size and was able to find it without too much trouble.  I like to carry the smaller size for two reasons.  It is the only product I have found  which has the dual purpose of moisturizing in addition to sanitizing.  Once I found the home sized one I liked to have it available for the times I don&#x27;t want to take the time to wash my hands thoroughly and then moisturize them, often at night.  I was unable to find the larger size until I tried to find it online.  I bought a backup.</li>
    <li> This is the best hand sanitizer I have ever used.  It really moistens your hands as it sanitizes.  My hands feel much better than when I use other sanitizers.</li>
    <li> This is now my standard hand moisturizer/sanitizer.  It is effective against common viruses, and is an excellent moisturizer.  It absorbs into the skin quickly, and leaves your hand silky smooth.  Another great product from Gold Bond.</li>
    <li> I love this product. I use it after washing my hands and between patients. I love it. Try it for yourself.</li>
    <li> Love this product!! In my line of work I&#x27;m constantly washing my hands and sanitizing my hands throughout the work day. It is hard on my hands to where my hands dry out and crack. This product is wonderful and helps my hands from drying out to the point of cracking. ..</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m using it and it seems to be working as well as the bottle I just finished, but I was dismayed to see that the expiration date on the bottles is over a year old.</li>
    <li> I had a weak immune system, needed chemo and had to be in the hospital a long time. Everything had to be sterile and everyone had to use the hand sterilization a lot. I found the smell of hospital and most commercial sterilization abrasive and extremely nauseating. This smell was light and practically nonexistent. I had everyone who came in my room use it and it helped a lot. It also kept everyone&#x27;s hands smooth instead of drying it out like other sanitizes.</li>
    <li> I use this all the time because I am a sales person who is in and out of doctor&#x27;s offices and hospitals all day long. This is my favorite hand sanitizer, especially in the winter. It cleans your hands but acts like a nice lightweight lotion. Does not dry your hands at all like traditional alcohol gel sanitizers and has a very nice, light fragrance.</li>
    <li> My hands get dry from constant washing and use of sanitizer.  This is the best way to eke my hands clean AND soft.</li>
    <li> I love using this product. It doesn&#x27;t dry out your hands, and feels good on your skin while getting rid of germs. I use it all the time. The one ounce size is perfect for your purse, and very handy when eating out.</li>
    <li> Not alcohol based. Not good for use by parents with newborns. Great as a lotion but not a hand sanitizer.</li>
    <li> microbes be dead&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;don&#x27;t be one of those users that use alcohol&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;use this&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;kill noro, kill ebola, kill the plague!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;happy hands!</li>
    <li> Really is both a hand sanitizer and a good moisturizer.  Made my poor hands much more comfortable during the brutally cold and dry weather my area had this winter</li>
    <li> Excellent product.  Good value.</li>
    <li> Great stuff at a great price</li>
    <li> My hands get dry from constant washing and use of sanitizer.  This is the best way to eke my hands clean AND soft.</li>
    <li> I use this every day on my hands, and frequently my child&#x27;s. We&#x27;ve never had any bad skin reaction to it, and it does not dry your hands out like alcohol-based sanitizers.  Love it!</li>
    <li> Buy this if you want a lotion that sanitizes your hands. Do not buy this for your everyday sanitizing needs. It leaves hand slippery and makes it tricky to open doorknobs after use.</li>
    <li> This product is very moisturizing and can take some time to absorb. You wouldn&#x27;t use this right before eating, for example, because it would stick around on your hands. Thus, this should be considered more of a lotion with sanitizer rather than a sanitizer with moisturizer if that makes sense.</li>
    <li> I keep one bottle in every car.  Sanitizer and moisturizer in one bottle is genius.  Non greasy, penetrating and makes your hands soft.</li>
    <li> Nothing softens hands quicker and better.</li>
    <li> love the product... but it expired too quickly</li>
    <li> Unfortunately, this product did not work for me.  Every time I used it, it would dry out my cuticles to the point of being painful.  I had to wash my hands and then apply a different moisturizer.  I also did not feel that this product moisturized my hands.  It&#x27;s a shame, I really wanted it to work.</li>
    <li> The best if you use lots of sanitizer. Helps cuticles.</li>
    <li> I love this product.  If you have hands that are sensitive to chemicals this is the product to use.  I have an awful reaction to all the alcohol based sanitizers so I tried this product and will never use anything else.  I have shared this with all my co-workers and now they are hooked too.</li>
    <li> With a newborn, 2 year old, and 10 year old we wash our hands a lot in my house which means that our hands are dried out and cracked from so much hand washing. This hand sanitizer keeps hands moisturized while sanitized and it&#x27;s great. No more dry cracked hands!</li>
    <li> The cream was supposed to be citrus. ..it is not. I was disappointed because I paid more for the 2 bottles per each than other sites. Cream is good, but citrus is great!</li>
    <li> I prefer this hand sanitizer over the traditional gel-type for two reasons: 1) it does not dry your skin as badly as the other type, which is especially important if you are often sanitizing; and 2) the active ingredient in this formula (a type of chlorine, if I remember correctly) actually kills more germs than the ingredient in most gel-type sanitizers (alcohol).  In fact, I started using this hand sanitizer when I was living and working in Haiti during the cholera epidemic b/c the active ingredient in this product can combat cholera, whereas alcohol does not.  In short, very effective and far less harsh than traditional hand sanitizers.</li>
    <li> I have hypersensitive skin and I have to be careful around alcohol based hand sanitizer products.  I work in home health and I have a patient that suffered a stroke and as a result coughed up alot of secretions from his lungs.  I was washing my hands none stop and applying hand sanitizer.  It didn&#x27;t take long and my hands dried out and stared to crack and burn.  I then found Gold Bond moisturing hand sanitizer.  I was unsure at first, but I was pleased.  My hand began to soften and the cracks go away.  I still wash my hands, but this lotion allows my hands to stay soft and pain free.  I was so excited to see this on amazon and bought it right away.  All I could find in the retail stores was the 2.7oz bottle and that cost me at least $5.  These large bottles are awesome and last me a long time and the price on Amazon is fantastic.  I use the large bottle to refill my smaller bottle in my purse.  Because of this product I have tried other Gold Bond products and have been so happy.  I hope you have good results also</li>
    <li> Great sanitizer that doesn&#x27;t leave your hands feeling dry!  This is a staple in our home!!</li>
    <li> The smell is light and pleasant.  It&#x27;s so nice to have an alternative to that drying hand sanitizer that I&#x27;ve been using.</li>
    <li> Very smmoth on the hands without being too oily.  The antibacterial componant does not burn at all.  The whole family uses it!</li>
    <li> Good for the house and vactions to use--------------------? in car to. Ill spread the word for the produck. to others and that i now. my dad loves it and the rest of the family. Good job AMAZON???. And all the workers</li>
    <li> Fingers on hands do not crack open as much since using this product.</li>
    <li> This is the second purchase of this Gold Bond Hand sanitizer I made. This product works great. Prior to switching I used alcohol base hand sanitizers and it would dry out my hands and cracks would form during winter. After using this during winter my hands were never cracked and feels very moisturized. I now have a bottle at work, living room and bathroom. This product does not leave a heavy and greasy film on your hands. It dries pretty quickly and does not have a strong scent. I would highly recommend this for people with sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> Bought this only for the fact that it is an awesome moisturizer, not for the &amp;#34;hand sanitizer&amp;#34;. It doesn&#x27;t work for &amp;#34;hand sanitizing&amp;#34; since it doesn&#x27;t contain the alcohol needed, but as a moisturizer, it is a very light and smooth moisturizer that leaves your skin feeling great without excess oil or dryness!! I&#x27;d order another 3 pack just to keep it around.</li>
    <li> This is our favorite hand sanitizer. More like a lotion then a sanitizer. No dry skin.</li>
    <li> My wife is a germ-o-phobe and she insists on me sanitizing my hands all the time.  This sanitizer and moisturizer is THE TRICK!!!  It keeps her happy and also keeps my hands from drying out!  Thank you Gold Bond!</li>
    <li> Great alternative to alcohol based hand santizers. Perfect when you have eczema on your hands!! My fingers crack and bleed all the time so regular hand santizers are not possible. This is the perfect solution.</li>
    <li> Washing your hands constantly dries out your hands. So does just using sanitizing gels. Now this product is the sweets spot.</li>
    <li> This is a great sanitizer and lotion. Would highly say buy this .Don&#x27;t dry your hands out when you use this product.</li>
    <li> I milk goats and use hand sanitizer between milking every goat so needed something gentle because I&#x27;m using it 12 times in the morning and 12 times in the evening (12 goats). Also use it on the mother goats after kidding to clean them up. They love it and it feels cool and gentle and reduces swelling on places that are sore. Also nice to remove crusty patches under their tails without hurting them and while it cleans my hands it also gives my goats soft udders with excellent skin condition. I like clean goats for milking, and clean hands. This does the job.</li>
    <li> This product is not just a wonderful hand lotion, but it is a sanitizer as well.  What could be better?</li>
    <li> There is one problem ... a small one but one that drove me nuts.  It is so thick, it will not let you empty the whole bottle with the attached pump.  Yes, I asked the company for help and this is the reply I received:  &amp;#34;We appreciate you taking the time to contact Chattem, Inc. regarding our Gold Hand Lotion. I’m sorry you have been unable to get all of the lotion out of the&lt;br /&gt;bottle.  Since the lotion is very thick and rich, when it is used down to a certain point, it leaves a hollow (similar to a straw in a milkshake) area around the pump.  The bottom of the lotion bottle must be tapped from each corner on a hard surface while being held upright so that more lotion is moved under the pump.  We apologize for any inconvenience this may cause. We will forward your comments to the appropriate department.  If we can be of further assistance, you may contact us via email at&lt;br /&gt;consumer.affairs@chattem.com.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Guess I am idiotic ... or I guess no one ever had this problem before me ... or I could empty the bottle into a container I can seal, and just stick my fingers in the sealed container whenever I need what it left in the bottle.  Or perhaps, Gold Bond could use my experience and make a larger straw.  Who knows --- just don&#x27;t get frustrated like I did ... the product is good but their customer support needs some help.</li>
    <li> It does the job, but the scent gives me headaches. :(</li>
    <li> I work with the public and I&#x27;m constantly either washing my hands or using hand sanitizer. My hands get so dried out that they itch! I found this and fell in love! My hands look younger and feel 100% better. It isn&#x27;t greasy and the smell is WONDERFUL!</li>
    <li> I love this product.  All other hand sanitizers dry you out, so it is so nice that this moisturizes too!</li>
    <li> Best sanitizer I have found.  I love the lotion!!</li>
    <li> I so highly recommend this item for anyone.  It is especially great for those in the medical field or are caretakers.  It softens the hands while eliminating bacteria and germs.  Even great for those limited with mobility to keep their hands clean and soft.</li>
    <li> Grat price for the package of three ends to be only $8.50 a bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also use the Gold bond ULTIMATE hand cream.</li>
    <li> its the only kind my mom can use it doesn&#x27;t contain alcohol which dries out your skin shes very happy with it im sure she will want me to order again if possible ty</li>
    <li> as a nurse I wash my hands ALOT this is a great alternative to use in between. keeps my hands from drying out so much.  I keep it with me at work and everyone uses it. I tell them where they can get it, but they seem to like mine,hmm go figure.</li>
    <li> Not greasy and leaves the hands silky smooth. Light and somewhat neutral fragrance. Better than liquid sanitizers that dry the skin.</li>
    <li> Perfect to have around the house when you have a baby.  It&#x27;s basically just like applying hand lotion, so feels nice each and every time you put it on and not corrosive like the hand sanitizers with alcohol.</li>
    <li> Finally, someone made a lotion and hand sanitizer.  We had many people come over to visit our newborn a while back and it was perfect to have at the front door for them.</li>
    <li> Perfect for After washing you hards, especially if you have dry skin like mine. I also use it to cut the greasy feeling repair creams give you. Pluse it it sanitizes, so that means it is good for kids hands before they eat.</li>
    <li> I usually buy this at walgreen&#x27;s but they stop keeping it stocked. I needed a hand sanitizer without alcohol in it. The alcohol over time of use, dries my hands. I checked the internet and found it on Amazon.com This was my first purchase on Amazon. The product was excellent. Thank you. Best regards Greg</li>
    <li> It contains Benzethonium Chloride.The little known cure for MRSA skin infections. My family fought MRSA for years. I can&#x27;t even explain the damage it did to us. We tried everything that is out there. As soon as we began using this, the infections stopped. It&#x27;s a pretty good moisturizer too so we continue to use it. Thank you Gold Bond!</li>
    <li> Enormously helpful in sterilizing hands while maintaining skin moisture. I bought THREE packs of three bottles since it apparently is going off the market.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s hard for kids to clean their hands.&lt;br /&gt;When they come from school or wherever&lt;br /&gt;we have them dab and rub in ... it helps&lt;br /&gt;protect them and us.&lt;br /&gt;Paramedic 27 years.</li>
    <li> Really great product, doesn&#x27;t cause any of the skin drying most antibacterial products do.  Great value for a pack of three.</li>
    <li> Excellent feeling sanitizer, doesn&#x27;t dry out your skin.  Does leave somewhat of a sticky feeling residue but better than sucking all the moisture out of your hands like  other sanitizers.</li>
    <li> I have this lotion in my kitchen near the sink. I love it because it moisturizes and disinfects. This lotion is not greasy but it definitely keeps my hands moisturized.</li>
    <li> This is the best hand sanitizer ever made.  Non alcohol so it doesn&#x27;t out your hands.  I use this product at work (grocery store).  My hands tend to get very dry, crack and bleed from handling money, etc.  Using Gold Bond Hand Sanitizer and Moisturizer is a tremendous help.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> This is a good size for kitchen or bath.  Soothing without being greasy or dry.</li>
    <li> Great!  the best sanitizer and moisturizer i have found.  i use it on a daily basis to moisturize my hands with the added benefit of being a sanitizer.</li>
    <li> My wife has fighting skin Mersa for several years.  This product when applied all over her body after showering has all but stopped the skin mersa since she has been using it. Not only has Gold Bond hand sanitizer has been a godsend for her medical problem but she reports it is probably the best moisterizer she has ever used.</li>
    <li> The best - have used this for about 3 years - heads up from my daughter who uses it for my great grandkids.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff for my dry skin in winter and it works wonders on my eczema all while keeping me germ free. I would highly recommend this to everyone looking for a good lotion and a sanitizer as well.</li>
    <li> I used to purchase this item in Wal-mart, they no longer carry the large bottles.  It is easy to use with the pump and it keeps my hands softer than the regular hand sanitizers.  I have a medical condition that requires me to use hand sanitizer several times a day.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t dry out your hands and sanitizes. Love it.</li>
    <li> My students are always asking for moisturizer. In addition, because they are careless and irresponsible we are not allowed to have soap in the girls bathroom so the kids can come and use the sanitizer when they are done.</li>
    <li> Bought this product while working rescue as a Paramedic. Finally after 20+ years of using the normal hand sanitizer that dries out your skin a company incorporated sanitizer and moisturizer together. I use to purchase the item at a local store and have not been able to find it for the last year except in the small travel version. I finally found it here on Amazon and was so happy.</li>
    <li> Great product!  I&#x27;m a constant user of hand sanitizer, which dries the skin.. so this is the perfect solution.  Gold Bond has always earned a good reputation.</li>
    <li> This sanitizer/lotion is great.  When we had our first kid we needed sanitizer and our hands completely dried out - not so with this.  Great product find, and even better product.  We love it.</li>
    <li> My favorite hand sanitizer.  Very moisturizing.  I like the citrus smell better but can&#x27;t find in larger size.</li>
    <li> Alcohol based hand sanitizers work pretty well for colds and flu, but they do not kill norovirus. Plus they smell awful, dry out your hands, and taste bad if you eat later. They also lose effectiveness the more often you use them. This is a far better product. It does not lose effectiveness over time, it does kill norovirus, it moisturizes, it doesn&#x27;t have much of a smell at all, and it doesn&#x27;t taste terrible if you later eat something. I keep a bottle at my desk at all times and carry around the travel sized ones in my purse (along with wet ones). Just as a reminder though, hand sanitizer should not be used as a substitute for good hand washing unless soap and water aren&#x27;t available.</li>
    <li> If you are looking for a sanitizer WITHOUT alcohol, this is it! I have eczema on both hands and this product is just what I needed.</li>
    <li> With reactive skin, I find this hand sanitizer to be especially easy on my hands.  (Only one warning - it can build-up if you use it too many times in a row.)  I really did look for quite a while to find this in the stores.  But was unsuccessful.  Then I decided to check Amazon.com.  The price was the best value than I ever paid in the past.  Highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I have been looking in the stores for.</li>
    <li> I do not use this product as a hand sanitizer, instead I use it religiously on my feet.  Since doing this I have never taken off my shoes and had odors.  It also keeps them moisturized.  I have found that it will minimize and take away the ictch for many bug bites.</li>
    <li> My favorite hand cream. It sanitizes but also makes your hands silky soft. Absorbs quickly. Not greasy.</li>
    <li> With my baby in the NICU, my hands were torn apart. I asked the doctor about non-alcohol based sanitizer and she told me this was the only one approved by the hospital. What a Godsend for the frequent diaper changes and other germ killing situations. Now that the baby is home, we have one on our changing table, one in the bathroom, one in our room, and one in the kitchen. We have 2 older boys (3 and 2) and it is safe for them to use with supervision. Excellent product! We have the travel size for on the go, too!</li>
    <li> I tried this product at a friend&#x27;s house and really liked it.  She was having a hard time finding it in anything but a trial size, so I looked on Amazon and found these 3 large bottles bundled together.  I like the feel of it and the smell - both are very nice - but it is so much like lotion, I have to wonder about the sanitizer part.  Does it really kill germs like it claims to?  I hope so, because I&#x27;m assuming it does.  Otherwise, it&#x27;s just really good lotion, but even that is good enough for me.</li>
    <li> I love this combo hand sanitizer-moisturizer and keep it in my car.  Highly recommend this. It has a fresh fragrance and aborbs quickly.  You will enjoy this.</li>
    <li> I buy this hand sanitizer for my daughter.  She is a special education teacher.  She and her aides use hand sanitizer through out the day.  Most sanitizers are very drying but not Gold Bonds.  It is a great project.</li>
    <li> I have to use lots of hand sanitizer and most all of them contain alcohol and it dries out your skin.  Gold Bond Hand Sanitizer adds moisture to your skin.  People I work with come to me to get the Sanitizer because their hands are dried out.  Works great!!</li>
    <li> My husband uses all types of hand sanitizers in his line of work, this one is the only one we have found so far that does not dry his hands out. We recommend this one to all our friends.</li>
    <li> If you are tired of hand sanitizers that are alcohol-based drying your skin out, this is your answer! This hand sanitizer has 7 moisturizers and will soften your hands rather than dry them out. It is also unscented, so it doesn&#x27;t compete with every other smell or irritate you if you don&#x27;t like over-scented products. I wish this was available in the 12-oz size in retail stores, but it isn&#x27;t easy to find. Thanks Amazon!</li>
    <li> This is the greatest hand sanitizer I&#x27;ve EVER had!  I have psoriasis over 85% of my body, and when I was my hands, having this, doesn&#x27;t make it so dry!  Thank you!</li>
    <li> This product is the best hand lotion I have found.  It somehow balances making my hands feel moisturized, without feeling greasy. I know that others have noted a smell.  I have never found this to be an issue, and plan to continue buying this product once my multiple bottles run out.</li>
    <li> So I am not a big fan of hand sanitizers - I think you should just learn to properly wash your hands and be done with it.  But after fighting a losing battle at my son&#x27;s school where they spend all day pumping alcohol based sanitizers onto the kids hands and watching his hands get dryer and dryer and crack &amp; peel I bought the 3 pack to donate to the room before his hands shredded to nothing.  This is definitely the best compromise solution - non alcohol based with gold bond moisturizer which is my absolute favorite.  His hands are much better and the school still gets to feel like they are doing to right thing to curtail the spreading of germs...</li>
    <li> I love this hand sanitizer.  The other sanitizers tend to dry out my hands and this is the only brand I can find that also moisturizes.  Highly recommend!</li>
</ol>
