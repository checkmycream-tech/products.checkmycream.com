<li> Secondly, the comb looks blackish in the picture on Amazon, but it looks dark gray in real life.</li>
<li> I use this comb every single day, multiple times a day.</li>
<li> Decent comb, but it is too small for my hands.  </li>
<li> I just wish there was a longer version for when separating my hair because it&#x27;s really long and the comb gets stuck toward the ends....</li>
<li> I have three rats, and all have long tails.</li>
<li> Very flimsy, small and a waste of money.</li>
<li> I use this to get out those little tangles that are vexing when my bigger comb dosen&#x27;t work.</li>
<li> Not at all what i expected, was bendable.</li>
<li> The comb teeth are a bit shorter than I expected.  </li>
<li> &quot; long with the comb teeth section stretching a little under 4\\&quot;</li>
<li> The teeth are 3/4 of an inch long, so if you have thick long hair, you&#x27;ll have to comb a little harder.  </li>
<li> It&#x27;s a average comb.  </li>
<li> Is recommend it especially for thick curly hair</li>
<li> and it bangs against my books and other heavy items.</li>
<li> Haven&#x27;t broken a tooth yet and there are no sharp edges to sever your hair.</li>
<li> (By long, I mean your hair not passing your shoulder.)  </li>
<li> I use it everyday.</li>
<li> i thought this comb would be sturdy and help me part my hair, but after 2 days, it broke in half!</li>
<li> So not worth my money!!!</li>
<li> I don&#x27;t see a negative about this comb except for the fact that I&#x27;m scared that the tail will break off one of these days, but</li>
<li> I am African-American and so my hair is quite thick and using the tail of the comb helps when I need to do braids and twists.</li>
<li> Seriously, the quality is what you would expect in a pack of assorted combs for a dollar.</li>
<li> Was seriously repeatedly pestered to write a review.</li>
<li> Hasn&#x27;t broken yet, use it every day....</li>
<li> but I&#x27;m sorry I was lazy on this one!</li>
<li> I am very disappointed, but I&#x27;m not sure if I&#x27;m disappointed in my rats, for not being the hairy tail type, or the comb, for not working on my rats&#x27; hairless</li>
<li> This the worst comb I have ever bought</li>

    <li> I am African-American and so my hair is quite thick and using the tail of the comb helps when I need to do braids and twists. However.  The tail is not that strong and consequently I can use the tail to start the line but not to finish pulling through the hair.</li>
    <li> Not at all what i expected, was bendable. Did not meet my expectations. Was not the sturdy kind of comb that expected.</li>
    <li> Bought another cheaper comb at Walmart. This one is much higher quality. Worth the extra few bucks.</li>
    <li> Good price and got it fast</li>
    <li> I have three rats, and all have long tails. I bought this, wanting to be the best rat owner ever. I then realized my rats&#x27; tails have no hair. This means I can&#x27;t comb their tails. I am very disappointed, but I&#x27;m not sure if I&#x27;m disappointed in my rats, for not being the hairy tail type, or the comb, for not working on my rats&#x27; hairless tails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note - I did try it on my ferret&#x27;s tail and it worked well.</li>
    <li> I was pretty surprised at the flimsy quality of this comb.  Sure it will do what I need it for (home hair cutting)but it really looks and feels like something you would pick up in the dollar store, and for half price at that. Seriously, the quality is what you would expect in a pack of assorted combs for a dollar. My advice is to save your money and stop at the local drug or dollar store on the way home and pick up a comb.  I love on-line shopping but I&#x27;m sorry I was lazy on this one!</li>
    <li> I use this to get out those little tangles that are vexing when my bigger comb dosen&#x27;t work. Haven&#x27;t broken a tooth yet and there are no sharp edges to sever your hair.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t tend to use combs too often, but I love having this around for those times when I&#x27;m trying to style my hair.  Perfect for getting out tangles in hair.</li>
    <li> I use this comb every single day, multiple times a day. It goes through a lot of abuse because I tend to throw my things around and don&#x27;t really take care of it. This comb is still intact and looks like I just bought it which is a miracle since i throw this in my purse and it bangs against my books and other heavy items. The teeth are nicely spaced out and I use this mostly to brush my straight bangs. I don&#x27;t see a negative about this comb except for the fact that I&#x27;m scared that the tail will break off one of these days, but that something that comes with the type of comb in general.</li>
    <li> Great product. Smooth and practical. Love the size and excellent quality of the material... It is so gentle on my scalp!! Thanks to the manufacturer for making sure the material is of top quality!!!</li>
    <li> I love this comb, its simple and does its job and can easily slide itself into your clutch or makeup bag.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a average comb.  Given the price, I didn&#x27;t expect more than that.  It&#x27;s plastic and 8\\&quot; long with the comb teeth section stretching a little under 4\\&quot; long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are a couple things that you should be aware of.  The comb teeth are a bit shorter than I expected.  The teeth are 3/4 of an inch long, so if you have thick long hair, you&#x27;ll have to comb a little harder.  (By long, I mean your hair not passing your shoulder.)  Secondly, the comb looks blackish in the picture on Amazon, but it looks dark gray in real life.</li>
    <li> I like the durability. It doesn&#x27;t flex or bend which is exactly what I wanted</li>
    <li> Great it works going through my tcup yorkies hair</li>
    <li> A good rat tail comb for cutting hair...</li>
    <li> Decent comb, but it is too small for my hands.  If I were smaller it would be fine. As is, I have virtually no control with it because I can&#x27;t get a grip on it.</li>
    <li> This high quality comb is smooth on all surfaces with no jagging protrusions left on the product after manufacturing. The tail part of the comb is very slender, which makes it easy to get a perfect &#x27;part&#x27; on the first try.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a comb. Was seriously repeatedly pestered to write a review. So here it is. It&#x27;s a damn comb. Nothing to write home to Mom about.</li>
    <li> Normally these combs tear out my hair or get stuck in the new growth and break but this comb flows through quite easily and I&#x27;m able to comb out my new growth with little to no problem. Is recommend it especially for thick curly hair</li>
    <li> I use this to braid my daughter&#x27;s hair. It works great and the tip is great for separating hair evenly.</li>
    <li> Great for styling and cutting hair. I use it everyday.</li>
    <li> i thought this comb would be sturdy and help me part my hair, but after 2 days, it broke in half! This the worst comb I have ever bought and I got one at the dollar store that lasted for a year. So not worth my money!!!</li>
    <li> I liked this come. It works well on the thickest of hair. I just wish there was a longer version for when separating my hair because it&#x27;s really long and the comb gets stuck toward the ends....</li>
    <li> Very flimsy, small and a waste of money. Should have gotten a dollar store one instead.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a good rat tail comb that does what you expect rat tail combs to do. Wouldn&#x27;t use it to brush my hair dry or anything but for separating out your layers and touching up here or there what more do you really need?</li>
    <li> Yup, does what it&#x27;s supposed to. Thank goodness for the latest advancements in comb technology. What did we do before combs???</li>
    <li> Hasn&#x27;t broken yet, use it every day....</li>
    <li> Good quality and service was also prompt.</li>
