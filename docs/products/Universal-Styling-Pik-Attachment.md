      <li>so it fits my hairdryer perfect~</li>
      <li>This is a wonderful pik attachment!</li>
      <li>It fits the Conair Silverbird perfectly and doesn&#x27;t pop off.  </li>
      <li>This works great with the Conair Infiiti Pro Dryer http://www.amazon.com/Conair-Infiniti-Performance-Styling-Purple/dp/B00FU574H2/ref&#x3D;sr_1_1?s&#x3D;beauty&amp;ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;qid&#x3D;1433787063&amp;sr&#x3D;1-1&amp;keywords&#x3D;Conair+Infiniti+Pro+Dryer+AC+Motor+%2F+Salon+Performance+Styling+Tool%2C+Purple</li>
      <li>Thank you for a great pick.</li>
      <li>Perfect fit.  </li>
      <li>Kind of stretchy at the opening</li>
      <li>Packed nicely, arrived as scheduled.</li>
      <li>and I love this pick.</li>
      <li>That said, I have not found another similar product that can straighten my hair as perfectly as this does, so I continue to purchase.</li>
      <li>I would have to say that don&#x27;t care it is lasts long, I would order another if the one I have ever breaks because it works so well and the price is GREAT!</li>
      <li>The price is great for such a nice item.  </li>
      <li>so it should fit most blow dryers.</li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t fit most dyers</li>
      <li>I tend to break these easily</li>
      <li>fits fine, but easily breakable</li>
      <li>This attachment has a tighter fit and hasn&#x27;t fallen of yet.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s strange that the first one I bought fit my dryer perfectly.</li>
      <li>So far so good.  </li>
      <li>Welp, have regular comb and great new blow dryer by another company.</li>
      <li>Item stated that it was universal, I own a golden hot blow dryer this product didn&#x27;t fit as stated it would.</li>
      <li>but I just used this and my hair is so straight and smooth.</li>
      <li>I rarely give anything a 5 stars</li>
      <li>This comb is adjustable but it doesn&#x27;t not stay on the dryer; as soon as I started blow drying my hair, It just popped right out.</li>
      <li>the price was right</li>
      <li>I like it, but have to buy a new hair dryer it will fit.</li>
      <li>Make sure your blow dryer has a skinny end, mine was too wide and this didn&#x27;t fit</li>
      <li>I bought this attachment to go with my gold n hot blow dryer and it kept popping off.  </li>
      <li>I tried 3 different model dryers looking for a better \\&quot;fit\\&quot; but this comb attachment just keeps popping off.</li>
      <li>EXACTLY WHAT I NEEDED</li>
      <li>The first brand I got would get to hot and come off.</li>
      <li>All in all still my favorite tool allowing me to skip the flat iron and avoid the damage that causes to my hair.</li>
      <li>I looked everywhere for a replacement comb at a reasonable price and durable quality.</li>
      <li>This one stays on the whole time.</li>
      <li>Some dryers have a fat nozzle or the nozzle is very tapered, which doesn&#x27;t allow the attachment to stay on.</li>
      <li>Despite this pick supposedly fitting most dryers, it definitely does not fit my Babyliss Titanium Pro.</li>
      <li>It beats buying a whole new set.</li>
      <li>I decided to try this one &amp; I am pleasantly surprised.  </li>
      <li>OHH I have 4c natural hair.</li>
      <li>The other ones fly off randomly when I&#x27;m blowdrying.</li>
      <li>I really like this product however the teeth are not very durable</li>
      <li>There are other brands that make an identical one, like Conair, but this brand is the only one I&#x27;ve found that has rubber grips on the inside that really hold on to the blow dryer.</li>
      <li>The first was from a seller who not only sold me the wrong item but did not refund me my full shipping cost.</li>
      <li>I ordered pick attachment and the Gold N Hot hair dryer and the attachment does not fit.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> EXACTLY WHAT I NEEDED</li>
    <li> This was an absolute fail.I bought this comb because my babylicious blow dryer didn&#x27;t come with a comb. This comb is adjustable but it doesn&#x27;t not stay on the dryer; as soon as I started blow drying my hair, It just popped right out. OHH I have 4c natural hair.</li>
    <li> Helps straightening hair .</li>
    <li> It beats buying a whole new set.This is the only place that I found that sells this replacement and the price was right</li>
    <li> Terrible the combs break easily</li>
    <li> This works great with the Conair Infiiti Pro Dryer http://www.amazon.com/Conair-Infiniti-Performance-Styling-Purple/dp/B00FU574H2/ref&#x3D;sr_1_1?s&#x3D;beauty&amp;ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;qid&#x3D;1433787063&amp;sr&#x3D;1-1&amp;keywords&#x3D;Conair+Infiniti+Pro+Dryer+AC+Motor+%2F+Salon+Performance+Styling+Tool%2C+Purple</li>
    <li> It does NOT fit my Revlon 1875W AC Motor Power Dry Hair Dryer. I had to return it</li>
    <li> I rarely give anything a 5 stars but I just used this and my hair is so straight and smooth. It works on my personal hair dryer so yes it is universal and it self adjusts. I would have to say that don&#x27;t care it is lasts long, I would order another if the one I have ever breaks because it works so well and the price is GREAT!</li>
    <li> I looked everywhere for a replacement comb at a reasonable price and durable quality. Well I found it! I will definitely recommend this item to my friends I give it a Five Star Plus!</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t fit most dyers</li>
    <li> I really like this product however the teeth are not very durable and so I find the need to repeatedly purchase this product.  That said, I have not found another similar product that can straighten my hair as perfectly as this does, so I continue to purchase.</li>
    <li> Part did not fit the blow dryer I had by the same company. this was a waste of my money.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using these daily for years. There are other brands that make an identical one, like Conair, but this brand is the only one I&#x27;ve found that has rubber grips on the inside that really hold on to the blow dryer. The other ones fly off randomly when I&#x27;m blowdrying. I definitely find it easier to blow dry my hair straight using this attachment vs. round brush or flat brush since it&#x27;s less awkward for me to have one hand free to hold the hair. One of these attachments lasts me about 6 months before the &amp;#34;teeth&amp;#34; start to break off. I think the heat from the dryer eventually makes the plastic weaker. All in all still my favorite tool allowing me to skip the flat iron and avoid the damage that causes to my hair. Note that this will not fit all dryers. Some dryers have a fat nozzle or the nozzle is very tapered, which doesn&#x27;t allow the attachment to stay on.</li>
    <li> The picks bend and break from the heat of the blow dryer. This is not a good product to purchase because the picks bend which makes the product non-useable.</li>
    <li> This attachment works great on my Revlon Hair Dryer!</li>
    <li> This did not fit my hairdryer and had to return it. I ended up having to order the correct attachment though Sally&#x27;s.</li>
    <li> This was the second time I had to buy this item. The first was from a seller who not only sold me the wrong item but did not refund me my full shipping cost. This seller sent me the item promptly and I love this pick. I wash my hair the night before and detangle in the shower. After detangling, I put about 12 Bantu knots in my hair. 6 on each side. I spray it with bamboo oil and then I go to sleep. The next day. I blow my hair out using this pick and then follow up with a flat iron. I have a baby bliss pro blow dryer. And this fits on that.</li>
    <li> Only styling pik that doesn&#x27;t slide off of my blow dryer</li>
    <li> Make sure your blow dryer has a skinny end, mine was too wide and this didn&#x27;t fit</li>
    <li> I bought this attachment to go with my gold n hot blow dryer and it kept popping off.  I plan on returning it.</li>
    <li> It did not fit my Conair blow dryer,when attached to the dryer and turn on the pick fell to the ground.I have to glue the pick on to the dryer.</li>
    <li> I have been buying replacement picks that only last 3-months or so.  I decided to try this one &amp; I am pleasantly surprised.  It is durable &amp; fits my dryer.  The price is great for such a nice item.  From now on when I need another replacement, this is the only one I will buy.  Thank you for a great pick.</li>
    <li> I ordered pick attachment and the Gold N Hot hair dryer and the attachment does not fit.  What a waste of time and money.  Names are the same and that is all.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not adjustable. I like it, but have to buy a new hair dryer it will fit.</li>
    <li> I tend to break these easily</li>
    <li> Despite this pick supposedly fitting most dryers, it definitely does not fit my Babyliss Titanium Pro. Though inexpensive it was still a total waste of money.</li>
    <li> Item stated that it was universal, I own a golden hot blow dryer this product didn&#x27;t fit as stated it would.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful pik attachment! This is my second one. The first brand I got would get to hot and come off. This one stays on the whole time. I&#x27;ve had it for a couple of months now and it still doesn&#x27;t come off!</li>
    <li> It fits the Conair Silverbird perfectly and doesn&#x27;t pop off.  It has made my life easier at the salon.The teeth are solid and don&#x27;t melt.  So far so good.  If anything goes wrong in the next few months, I&#x27;ll post an update.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s strange that the first one I bought fit my dryer perfectly. This time it won&#x27;t even stay on without even turning on the dryer.</li>
    <li> Perfect fit.  I have a Palladium ceramic 2000 watt hair dryer.  I have had problems with my last adjustable pick falling off and the teeth breaking off.  This attachment has a tighter fit and hasn&#x27;t fallen of yet.</li>
    <li> I does what I need it to do.  Kind of stretchy at the opening so it should fit most blow dryers.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t stay on the blow dryer. I tried 3 different model dryers looking for a better \\&quot;fit\\&quot; but this comb attachment just keeps popping off.</li>
    <li> fits fine, but easily breakable</li>
    <li> Adjustable/flexible so it fits my hairdryer perfect~</li>
    <li> Packed nicely, arrived as scheduled. Opened it the following day. Washed hair, plugged in blow dryer, attached the pick attachment, well tried anyway. Universal, no, it is not. Adjustable, to a fault... Tried holding it and using it, the pick developed what I can only describe as gigantic fault lines (think earthquake) , split down the middle on both sides after 10 minutes of use?!? Promptly returning. Disappointed. Welp, have regular comb and great new blow dryer by another company.</li>
    <li> Was return did not fit</li>
