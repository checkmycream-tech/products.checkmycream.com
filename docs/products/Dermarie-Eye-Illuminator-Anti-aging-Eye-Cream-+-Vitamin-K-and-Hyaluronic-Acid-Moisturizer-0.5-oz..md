      <li>Great product.</li>
      <li>I have been using Dermarie eye cream for about a month with good results.</li>
      <li>Still, it is a good moisturizer, the packaging is good and the container keeps the product in and moist.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve always had good skin, but I don&#x27;t want to take it for granted.</li>

      <li>and I&#x27;m glad I did!</li>
      <li>It is a fantastic buy for the price and great results.</li>
      <li>Could a fair skinned girl ask for anything more?  </li>
      <li>I liked that it was in a bottle with a pump to keep contaminants out.  </li>
      <li>When I pay good money for a cream, I want to be able to get out every drop.</li>
      <li>I did end up returning this product and received a full refund which was great.</li>
      <li>I have since recommended this product to all my friends and they all love it also.</li>
      <li>Some of the creams worked ok and others not so well.</li>
      <li>Sure it smells great and feels soft</li>
      <li>The cream has a nice feel and scent, and absorbs quickly.</li>
      <li>I strongly recommend that you NOT purchase this product if you have skin sensitivity.</li>
      <li>It also has done a wonderful job in treating my dark circles and bags.</li>
      <li>The fine lines around the edges of my eyes diminished almost overnight.</li>
      <li>The results were quick and I couldn&#x27;t ask for more.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a nice cream, but I think nothing probably will help much with my under eye circles.</li>
      <li>Very fine lines diminished (really!)</li>
      <li>After many years of working in the sun, I thought the damage to my skin was permanent, but Dermarie&#x27;s restorative properties have taken years off my appearance - much appreciated!</li>
      <li>the past 6 months with excellent results I decided to give this eye cream a chance.</li>
      <li>The darker circles were significantly reduced around my eyes, as well as the wrinkles almost disappearing.</li>
      <li>I started using this product several months ago and by far it&#x27;s the best eye cream I have ever come across.</li>
      <li>All I have to say is Dermarie takes under eye cream to a whole new amazing level!  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m so happy I did because it has helped get rid of the dark circles and morning puffiness.</li>
      <li>This eye cream works great at eliminating my dark spots and &amp;#34;tired&amp;#34; look.</li>
      <li>I drink a lot of water (when I don&#x27;t I can tell the difference), I don&#x27;t smoke, and I rarely drink.</li>
      <li>I had fun in my 20s</li>
      <li>Love how soft this cream feels.</li>
      <li>The dark circles and discoloration around my eyes have diminished more and more each week and my skin hasn&#x27;t looked this good and felt this soft in a long time.</li>
      <li>Thanks Dermarie!</li>
      <li>I may have finally found a product that works, feels good, and smells nice, but the high price and wasteful dispenser bring the overall review rating down to 3 STARS.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m truly amazed by how much brighter and healthier my skin looks.</li>
      <li>but now I have to really try to maintain what I have.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend to friends, family and coworkers!</li>
      <li>Great eye cream for reviving those tired morning eyes.</li>
      <li>When I put this on I immediately had to wash it off because it burned so much.</li>
      <li>When I was in automotive sales, I spent quiet a fair amount of time on the lot in the Florida sun.</li>
      <li>this product went on so easy and made my eyes feel younger and at 74 years old that a lot</li>
      <li>They explained the eye cream without vitamin K is for individuals with sensitive skin and that vitamin K is a powerful ingredient but it may cause irritation if you have sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend to anyone looking for a quality eye cream.</li>
      <li>Goes on smooth, but I have not noticed any really change in my dark eye circles.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve also started looking around for skin care products to help me preserve the quality of my skin, and keep me as fresh and youthful looking as possible.</li>
      <li>The cream is light, non greasy, and leaves the skin feeling soft all day long.</li>
      <li>, however I didn&#x27;t notice any difference in the fine lines around my eyes or any other improvement.  </li>
      <li>After years of using both high- and low-end eye creams that did absolutely nothing, I simply gave up and stuck to using way too much concealer.</li>
      <li>Blends with makeup perfectly and is clearly a competitor in my mind with other major brands if not superior.  </li>
      <li>After a week and a half of using this product faithfully, I finally started to see some improvement just about when it ran out, otherwise I would have given it a better rating</li>
      <li>This is a terrific product that absolutely lived up to its claims.</li>
      <li>This cream has far exceeded my expectations.</li>
      <li>I used the Dermarie system faithfully over the course of several weeks and had very noticeable benefits.</li>
      <li>but at least I look like it :)</li>
      <li>Cream feels soft, lightweight and non greasy.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend to anyone looking for a quality product that actually works.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s easy to apply and feels soft against the delicate under-eye skin.</li>
      <li>This system truly hydrates the face, which is one of the major enemies of a youthful face.</li>
      <li>It seems like all the reviews were created around the same time and all the purchasers have only 1 other review around the same time for another cheap item.</li>
      <li>This is the only eye cream I can use with my sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>The directions were simple and the cream did not irritate my skin in any fashion (as I have sensitive skin).</li>
      <li>Over my 37 years I have tried various products ranging from prescription dermatological ones to the major brand names.  </li>
      <li>I really like dermarie&#x27;s eye cream for helping to eliminate under eye dark circles and crows feet under my eyes.</li>
      <li>It has worked very well on my dark circles, puffiness and eye wrinkles.</li>
      <li>Over the past several years I have tried many different eye creams that claim to reduce under eye dark circles.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend to anyone with dark circles and discoloration around the eyes.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> After many years of working in the sun, I thought the damage to my skin was permanent, but Dermarie&#x27;s restorative properties have taken years off my appearance - much appreciated!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s hard to decide what to buy when it comes to wrinkle creams. I read a review about the Dermarie system on the Internet. I bought this product specifically to diminish the puffiness and dark circles under my eyes. I have been using it now for about 3 weeks and have noticed less puffiness and the dark circles have faded.</li>
    <li> This is the only eye cream I can use with my sensitive skin. It&#x27;s lightweight and doesn&#x27;t have that oily residue. My skin is tighter and toned. The fine lines around the edges of my eyes diminished almost overnight. The results were quick and I couldn&#x27;t ask for more. This is a great find!</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t take a rocket scientist to figure this out, but in my opinion it would appear that most, if not all, of the reviews are fake.  It seems like all the reviews were created around the same time and all the purchasers have only 1 other review around the same time for another cheap item.</li>
    <li> Overall this product did nothing for my eyes. In fact, it even made the skin under my eyes dryer than they already were. I did end up returning this product and received a full refund which was great.</li>
    <li> this product is good for your skin</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a nice cream, but I think nothing probably will help much with my under eye circles. Still, it is a good moisturizer, the packaging is good and the container keeps the product in and moist.</li>
    <li> I used the Dermarie system faithfully over the course of several weeks and had very noticeable benefits. Very fine lines diminished (really!) and deeper lines softened noticeably. My husband commented on the difference. Also, the skin on my cheeks had been rough as well, and the nighttime cream smoothed my skin. The darker circles were significantly reduced around my eyes, as well as the wrinkles almost disappearing. This system truly hydrates the face, which is one of the major enemies of a youthful face. This is a terrific product that absolutely lived up to its claims.</li>
    <li> this product went on so easy and made my eyes feel younger and at 74 years old that a lot</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very pleased with this eye cream. It has worked wonders on my eyes and really helped with the puffiness and under eye dark circles I&#x27;ve been dealing with lately. The puffiness subsides almost immediately and the dark circles are noticeably less. Very happy!</li>
    <li> One of my go to products for treating dark circles and puffiness around my eyes. I use this cream in the morning and can within minutes see improvement in the dark spots and puffiness around my eyes. Love how soft this cream feels. Great product. No complaints.</li>
    <li> Bought this product to help reduce the crows feet and bags under my eyes. Cream feels soft, lightweight and non greasy. Eyes look and feel rejuvenated. Can’t go a day without it. Great eye cream for reviving those tired morning eyes.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m an actor approaching 40. I drink a lot of water (when I don&#x27;t I can tell the difference), I don&#x27;t smoke, and I rarely drink. I&#x27;ve also started looking around for skin care products to help me preserve the quality of my skin, and keep me as fresh and youthful looking as possible. For me it&#x27;s not an issue of vanity, but of actual livelihood; how my skin looks has actual career and financial implications. I&#x27;ve always had good skin, but I don&#x27;t want to take it for granted. I had fun in my 20s and I don&#x27;t regret it, but now I have to really try to maintain what I have. With Dermarie, I can look in the mirror and see that it&#x27;s working.</li>
    <li> I have used this product multiple times and it reduces under eye dark circles, eye puffiness, fines lines, moisturizes and firms up the delicate eye area skin like no other product I have ever had. I originally bought it based on a recommendation from a friend who had excellent results. It is a fantastic buy for the price and great results. I have since recommended this product to all my friends and they all love it also. I will be buying again and again.</li>
    <li> I bought this eye cream a few months back to treat the dark circles and puffiness under my eyes. Over the last year I&#x27;ve noticed the dark spots under my eyes have become increasingly apparent due to my lack of sleep from having two newborns who like to stay up all night. This eye cream works great at eliminating my dark spots and &amp;#34;tired&amp;#34; look. Highly recommend to anyone looking for a quality product that actually works.</li>
    <li> This is one of the best eye creams i&#x27;ve used in a while. Reduces the bags and dark circles in morning. Gives me a refreshed look in the morning before work. Cant start my day without it like coffee. I highly recommend to friends, family and coworkers!</li>
    <li> After a week and a half of using this product faithfully, I finally started to see some improvement just about when it ran out, otherwise I would have given it a better rating</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been battling insomnia for years. Due to this I have serious dark circles and bags under my eyes. I&#x27;ve tried many products and most wear off by later morning or get stuck in the creases which makes me look terrible. My friend suggested I try this and I&#x27;m glad I did! It&#x27;s easy to apply and feels soft against the delicate under-eye skin. It also has done a wonderful job in treating my dark circles and bags. I am totally happy with the results</li>
    <li> I like it.  Goes on smooth, but I have not noticed any really change in my dark eye circles.  Disappointed that it didn&#x27;t work better.</li>
    <li> If you have not converted yet to the Dermarie product line all I can say is what are you waiting for?  Over my 37 years I have tried various products ranging from prescription dermatological ones to the major brand names.  So, I consider myself quite the product connoisseur.  All I have to say is Dermarie takes under eye cream to a whole new amazing level!  The results are instantaneous, brighter, less dark circles, and firmer skin. Could a fair skinned girl ask for anything more?  Blends with makeup perfectly and is clearly a competitor in my mind with other major brands if not superior.  Thanks Dermarie!</li>
    <li> After using [[ASIN:B00GG0I86Q Dermarie Retinol Wrinkle Repair Anti-aging Night Cream, 1.0 oz. / 30 g]] the past 6 months with excellent results I decided to give this eye cream a chance. I&#x27;m so happy I did because it has helped get rid of the dark circles and morning puffiness. I apply the cream in the morning and within 10 minutes I can see a difference in skin tone and the puffiness has subsided. The cream is light, non greasy, and leaves the skin feeling soft all day long. I&#x27;ve had no issues applying makeup afterward.</li>
    <li> $60 down the drain.  Didn&#x27;t do anything.</li>
    <li> When I was in automotive sales, I spent quiet a fair amount of time on the lot in the Florida sun. That much exposure to the sun did a lot for my farmers tan, which was bad enough, but I eventually noticed that prolonged periods of squinting had left me with crows feet and other wrinkles around the eyes. So after a friend recommended Dermarie, I purchased both the day and night cream. The directions were simple and the cream did not irritate my skin in any fashion (as I have sensitive skin). Loved the results! Dermarie shrank the puffiness and erased the dark circles under my eyes.</li>
    <li> This cream has far exceeded my expectations. After years of using both high- and low-end eye creams that did absolutely nothing, I simply gave up and stuck to using way too much concealer. I later received this as a gift and decided to give it a try. After just 2 weeks, I actually began seeing improvements! I thought that it might juts be the placebo effect coming into play, but then other people started noticing also. The first things to noticeably improve were the wrinkles and puffiness; it took a little bit longer to notice the diminishing dark circles. All in all, I am very happy with the results.</li>
    <li> I have been using Dermarie eye cream for about a month with good results. I&#x27;ve gotten compliments from coworkers about my eyes looking less tired, so I know it&#x27;s working. I may not feel like I got enough sleep but at least I look like it :) The cream has a nice feel and scent, and absorbs quickly. It is not oily, and leaves no greasy residue around my eyes. It doesn&#x27;t interfere with my makeup at all. So, why 3 stars? When I pay good money for a cream, I want to be able to get out every drop. Since the cream comes in a pump, I feel like I&#x27;m wasting product that is in the jar and on the pump, unless a use my finger and a Q-tip to get it out. The price is above average for eye creams, so it&#x27;s hardly a bargain. I may have finally found a product that works, feels good, and smells nice, but the high price and wasteful dispenser bring the overall review rating down to 3 STARS.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product Quality &#x3D; 5 Stars&lt;br /&gt;Packaging &#x3D; 2 Stars&lt;br /&gt;Price &#x3D; 3 Stars&lt;br /&gt;Overall Rating &#x3D; 3 STARS</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive, thin skin. When I put this on I immediately had to wash it off because it burned so much. My skin still burned and was red for 10-20 minutes later. I&#x27;m not sure if I can return it, but I certainly will never buy it again. I strongly recommend that you NOT purchase this product if you have skin sensitivity.</li>
    <li> A friend suggested I use an eye cream with vitamin k to help with the dark circles I&#x27;ve had for years. I came across this vitamin k eye cream a few months ago and I&#x27;m so happy I did! The dark circles and discoloration around my eyes have diminished more and more each week and my skin hasn&#x27;t looked this good and felt this soft in a long time. I&#x27;ve tried numerous eye creams in the past that claim to treat dark circles and none have worked as well is this one. Highly recommend to anyone with dark circles and discoloration around the eyes.</li>
    <li> I tried this vitamin K eye cream after using the [[ASIN:B00GG0I9BK Dermarie Eye Illuminator Anti-aging Eye Cream with Hyaluronic Acid, 0.5 oz. / 15 ml]] for about 3 with no significant improvement in my dark circles. I emailed the company and they responded promptly and suggested I try this eye cream because it contains vitamin K, which is used in hospitols for post operative bruising. They explained the eye cream without vitamin K is for individuals with sensitive skin and that vitamin K is a powerful ingredient but it may cause irritation if you have sensitive skin. I&#x27;m so glad I tried the vitamin k eye cream because it has been working great for me. My raccoon eyes have improved everyday since I&#x27;ve been using the product. I just finished my second bottle and about to buy another. I can&#x27;t say enough about how well this product works for raccoon eyes.</li>
    <li> I used the entire bottle.  I liked that it was in a bottle with a pump to keep contaminants out.  It only bothered my eyes a little (tearing), however I didn&#x27;t notice any difference in the fine lines around my eyes or any other improvement.  I mainly wanted this for eye brightening, but alas I noticed nothing like that.</li>
    <li> Incrdible smell and great texture. I feel like my skin around the eyes loves it!</li>
    <li> I saw no difference on this stuff. I thought it was a waste of money. Sure it smells great and feels soft but it did not make any difference.</li>
    <li> This is an awesome eye cream. I started using this product several months ago and by far it&#x27;s the best eye cream I have ever come across. The dark circles, puffy eyes and crows feet that I&#x27;ve been dealing with for years are now just a thing of the past. I&#x27;m truly amazed by how much brighter and healthier my skin looks. My husband has even said my eyes look 10 years younger! Great product that will give you the results your looking for but it doesn&#x27;t happen overnight.</li>
    <li> excellent products very good delivery time very happy with it thank you</li>
    <li> Over the past several years I have tried many different eye creams that claim to reduce under eye dark circles. Some of the creams worked ok and others not so well. I really like dermarie&#x27;s eye cream for helping to eliminate under eye dark circles and crows feet under my eyes. Highly recommend to anyone looking for a quality eye cream.</li>
    <li> This is the perfect all in one eye cream. It has worked very well on my dark circles, puffiness and eye wrinkles. Love how it applies and feels great on my skin.</li>
