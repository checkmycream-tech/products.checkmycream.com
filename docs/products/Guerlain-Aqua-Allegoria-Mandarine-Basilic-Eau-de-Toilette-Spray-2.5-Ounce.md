      <li>Love the smell.</li>
      <li>This is my favorite all around fragrance for many years.</li>
      <li>I bought it because I love the Aqua Allegoria collection.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t smell like cleaner, but it sure makes me feel as if I am cleaner :)</li>
      <li>and it seems most perfume manufacturers have to add them.</li>
      <li>Love this fresh scent.</li>
      <li>Product was delivered sooner than estimated....packed securely.  </li>
      <li>Very fresh.  </li>
      <li>Light, clean and youthful fragrance.  </li>
      <li>It is fresh and easy to wear.</li>
      <li>Smells like sweet oranges.</li>
      <li>My favorite summer fragrance, and the shipment was fast and hassle-free.</li>
      <li>I love this fragrance, but it doesn&#x60;t last on my skin for more than about 30 minutes.</li>
      <li>But, once you put on your skin, it smells soooo fresh and summery.</li>
      <li>I feel fresh and fruity when I wear it.</li>
      <li>Not for those who don&#x27;t like smelling like fruit, but it&#x27;s very positive and uplifting.</li>

      <li>She also thinks it doesn&#x27;t last long, but both of us love the smell.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s light, not over powering, slight citrus smell,and a very gentle long lasting scent.</li>
      <li>This one is a very soft fragrance, does not last.</li>
      <li>When I first opened the botlle, I found the smell a little overpowering.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m a sucker for orange, lemon and grapefruit scents but do not like sweet or girly smells</li>

    <li> you can&#x27;t go wrong with this eau de toilette. It is fresh and easy to wear. The other scents from Guerlain are not as good as this one. I have been using it for the last 2 years and i have received lots of compliments</li>
    <li> I love it! I feel fresh and fruity when I wear it. Not for those who don&#x27;t like smelling like fruit, but it&#x27;s very positive and uplifting.</li>

    <li> I think this is the perfect scent. This is my second bottle and all I use. Love it. It&#x27;s light, not over powering, slight citrus smell,and a very gentle long lasting scent. When I smell it it just makes me want to take a second breath. My husband gave me my first bottle as a gift. I had told him to go pick out a fragrance HE liked and this is the one he choose. I couldn&#x27;t go wrong with this product.</li>
    <li> My favorite summer fragrance, and the shipment was fast and hassle-free.</li>
    <li> Guerlain&#x27;s Aqua Allegoria Mandarine-Basilic puts me in a good mood the minute I put it on. I&#x27;m a sucker for orange, lemon and grapefruit scents but do not like sweet or girly smells and it seems most perfume manufacturers have to add them.Their perfumes end up smelling like dish soap or shampoo. But there are enough other notes to Guerlain&#x27;s Aqua Allegoria Mandarine-Basilic so it doesn&#x27;t smell like furniture polish either; a failing of some other,unnamed eau de toilette sprays.</li>
    <li> Heaven has knocked at my door.  I mean it.</li>
    <li> Love this fresh scent. I have been wearing this for years and always get complements when ever someone is close enough to smell it. Great for men or women.</li>
    <li> A friend recommended it to me. She also thinks it doesn&#x27;t last long, but both of us love the smell. I don&#x27;t like to use perfume but I use this one everyday</li>
    <li> I love this fragrance, but it doesn&#x60;t last on my skin for more than about 30 minutes. I am very disappointed!</li>
    <li> I really love this fragrance, especially after the Guerlain stopped producing my favorite perfume, a limited edition of mandarin flower.</li>
    <li> It was a request from my wife.  She likes the smell.  As for me I have no need for any such thing .</li>
    <li> I bought it because I love the Aqua Allegoria collection. This one is a very soft fragrance, does not last. Not comparable with other fragrances of the same collection.</li>
