<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> This stuff works great but you should only order them 2 bottles at a time. When you buy the pack of 3 (and you use the first two until they&#x27;re gone or dried out), by the time you get to the the third one, it doesn&#x27;t have the same strength as the first two... it&#x27;s like it loses its strength by sitting too long. That is just my experience with them. Otherwise, great product!</li>
    <li> they said it was best for Asian skin types. works well on americans if you ask me.</li>
    <li> This blemish lotion works better than anything I&#x27;ve ever tried and is easy to use.</li>
    <li> Works great and helps my teenager to control his acne.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work at all!  Don&#x27;t waste your money on this item.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great! It works! We had used other products but this is the best! My daughter would have a blemish come up on her face and put this on it at night. The next morning... NO BLEMISH! WOW! Never seen anything like this. I wish they had it when I was a teenager!</li>
    <li> Bought this when we ran out of ProActiv and couldn&#x27;t get to the mall.  It works but ProActive is better (even though Proactive costs more!)  The Bye Bye Blemish Lotion would be better if it had more of the active ingredient and less of what looks and smells like calamine lotion in it.  It is is a drying cream as the front of the box says though.</li>
    <li> Comparable to Maria Badescu drying lotion, but a bit darker or closer to (my) skin tone. Like it a lot!</li>
    <li> Excellent price!! I have paid more at store. Really does clear up blemishes over night. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I highly recommend this product. I&#x27;ve had tiny breakouts for about 2 years and this quickly helped to dry out the pimples. I want to also recommend something that&#x27;s going to make the skin healthier once the breakouts are calmer. This is what I use:  http://amzn.to/1dy30OA  Many acne sufferers have used it and have seen faster and better results! It&#x27;s important to know how to use it  to achieve the maximum results. You can also try this sulfur soap  :  http://goo.gl/fg3ttb  to help calm the breakouts. make sure you&#x27;re not allergic to sulfur before you use it.&lt;br /&gt;When everything looks calmer, meaning less inflamed, less red, then you can use this:  http://amzn.to/1dy30OA  to help speed up the healing, to exfoliate the dead skin, and to clear up all the blemishes. Good luck and don&#x27;t lose hope! It will be better soon! :)</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. It works. I do not shake it, just because that&#x27;s what the instructions say. I will purchase more when I run out.</li>
    <li> I purchased this after my Mario Badescu product was out and it is definitely a comparable product. There is more of the pink stuff on the bottom in this one.</li>
    <li> Quick remedy!&lt;br /&gt;Love it! I never had acne until i was 24. After the age of 26 I had so many acne on my face and that too all varieties from small to super large. I am allergic to Benzol. My sister who is a doctor told me about this product, I have been using this since 2 years now.&lt;br /&gt;When i first started using it, it tried it daily for 4-6 months during nights. My acne vanished. I still use it when i get any acne. I hardly get an small acne once in 5-6 months now and its small.&lt;br /&gt;It will show you the effect next day itself. Totally worth every penny.</li>
    <li> This has been very helpful. I like that it works as fast as it does..</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! The only stuff that actualy works for my big daddy zits that visit me several times a month. I got my boyfriend to try it also and now he wants one at his place. I will definately start ordering a pack of two at a time.</li>
    <li> Amazing stuff!!  Use when needed, can be drying if over used. But, WOW! It does work overnight..</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve gifted this to many.  It&#x27;s amazing!</li>
    <li> This worked very well on my skin.  I have used another well known brand similar to this, and this works just as good and is much cheaper.  Would purchase again.</li>
    <li> Real good product,does what it states.</li>
    <li> Used 2 bottles up, applying every night before bed. No improvements on blemishes/red spots. Complete disappointment.</li>
    <li> Great blemish control for teens &amp; adults.</li>
    <li> Clears acne over night this is the best stuff on the market for quick quick results. Even for deep cyst acne. LOVE LOVE THIS PRODUCT.</li>
    <li> The one I purchased from the store worked great. This one doesn&#x27;t seem as strong or efficient; and I bought two bottles. I wish I hadn&#x27;t.</li>
