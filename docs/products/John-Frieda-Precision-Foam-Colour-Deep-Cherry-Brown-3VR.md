      <li>The results are nice.</li>
      <li>This stuff is great and there is always plenty of color for full coverage.  </li>
      <li>Didn&#x27;t cover grey well; the texture was great and the ease of use was great.</li>
      <li>What I liked most about this dye was that it was really easy to get off your skin around your hair line and ears.  </li>
      <li>The colors are so beautiful and vibrant.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve had so many compliments on this color asking me where I get my hair done, they never believe that I do it myself at home!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used this dye for more than 5 years now.</li>
      <li>probably 2 years or more.  </li>
      <li>The color is ok.</li>
      <li>Also, with the foam dye I noticed you need a lot more product to fully cover and saturate the hair.</li>
      <li>I love the color on my hair.</li>
      <li>color payoff is stunning.</li>
      <li>It stays shiney and has no horrible odor  </li>
      <li>my hair looks and feels healthy.    </li>
      <li>so I&#x27;m sure that will go away, and you can&#x27;t tell after it dries or anything</li>
      <li>I love foam dyes because of the even-ness of the color and ease of application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>and I like the color even more.</li>
      <li>The color is so cute</li>
      <li>and the color really lasts and my hair gets an amazing shine after every application!</li>
      <li>Easy to use  Easy to follow instruction with pictures  1.6 oz resealable conditioner  </li>
      <li>The foam is really easy to cover your roots with, and tangling is not a problem like with cream hair colors.  </li>
      <li>Overall great  Product.</li>
      <li>so I don&#x27;t stain my sink/countertop, and my trusty hair clip, brush, and the cheap tub of Vaseline.</li>
      <li>hesitate to buy this over the $2-3 cheap drugstore hair dyes.</li>
      <li>So far, so good...</li>
      <li>So far, so good...</li>
      <li>The instructions are super easy, and since its a foam its easy to apply to your hair.</li>
      <li>I would highly recommend this for anyone who does their own hair at home.</li>
      <li>Once it&#x27;s soaked in I&#x27;ll rinse it out generously again with cool water.</li>
      <li>But make sure you use the whole bottle of hair dye.</li>
      <li>like this one though, good coverage and deep color.</li>
      <li>Just started week 6 with this hair color, and it&#x27;s still pretty strong in color.</li>
      <li>The color always comes our super even on me-</li>
      <li>I comb my hair in the shower with a wide tooth comb-I have naturally curly hair and found that this is the best way to preserve the curl.</li>
      <li>John Frieda won out because it looked easy, straight forward</li>
      <li>The foam was really easy to use (much easier than liquid dye) and there was a lot of it in the bottle.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;While the 3VR Radiant Red Deep Cherry Brown is my husband&#x27;s preferred color, and honestly it is mine too, I also enjoy the deep 3N Brilliant Brunette occasionally, although he&#x27;ll pout when I change it to the darker brown.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Easy to  use and not messy.</li>
      <li>The foam is great but hard to use just  At the roots, I wish it came with a tip applicator.  </li>
      <li>I apply it once a week for the first month and works wonders.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Been</li>
      <li>I really like this dye!  </li>
      <li>I bought this product when it first came out.</li>
      <li>using this product in various colors for the past 5 years and my hair is great!</li>
      <li>Love the color just have to re dye every four weeks fades out even using red john Frieda shampoo and conditioner</li>
      <li>This covers the grays pretty well.  </li>
      <li>With other cheaper box dyes it always seemed like my hair felt better after dying it, but my hair feels kind of gross now in the shower.  </li>
      <li>The color is really nice and it looks different in different light which I find really neat.  </li>
      <li>The application is easy however the foam does dry rather quickly.  </li>
      <li>For me this was a very crappy product and very damaging!</li>
      <li>If you get it on your skin you can just rub at it for a bit after its done processing and it will come off which is wonderful unlike my past experiences with other brands.  </li>
      <li>I thought this was a reasonable amount of time.</li>
      <li>The conditioner leaves my hair really shiny.</li>
      <li>I ended up with a very splotchy application, and damaged hair.</li>
      <li>so I&#x27;ll use whatever is left and foam the top of my head until it&#x27;s completely drenched.</li>
      <li>The deep cherry color is not as red as I would have expected, or brassy, so I&#x27;m happy.</li>
      <li>After the 45 min has passed I rinse my hair with cool water until I don&#x27;t see any dye left in the water.</li>
      <li>but i got older and tried to stick to 1 hair color.  </li>
      <li>I used the full box, but I have long hair that&#x27;s really curly</li>
      <li>Highly recommended.</li>
      <li>I love this color, it&#x27;s not overwhelming, it gives off a dark natural brownish red color which is just gorgeous.</li>
      <li>the thing I disliked the most about this color...</li>
      <li>I made sure my hair was as saturated with the color foam as I could get it.&lt;br /&gt;Second...when I rinsed the color off...which by the way, I left on for 30 minutes as was stated in the instructions for grey coverage...</li>
      <li>but not least...</li>
      <li>It wasn&#x27;t as easy to actually work the foam through the ends, so I scrunched the foam into my ends until they were completely saturated and worked as much foam into may hair as possible.</li>
      <li>(i mixed boxes to get the right color</li>
      <li>The color is a little darker than I expected, but I like it, it covered my heavy regrowth perfectly.</li>
      <li>I was mixing various boxes of color at one point until i saw this come out and was interested in trying out the foam form of color.  </li>
      <li>pre-prep my area by putting down a HUGE 50-gallon garbage can bag, the one you&#x27;d use when it&#x27;s time to rake leaves during fall, under my folding chair to protect the carpet.</li>
      <li>I really loved this Deep Cherry Brown color and had been searching for a color like this for a long time since my regular color had been discontinued for a long time now.&lt;br /&gt;First of all this foam is a joke!  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t use the provided conditioner because that scent is overwhelming for me, so it typically gets tossed out in favor of my regular</li>
      <li>When I first dye it&#x27;s a super dark red that looks brown</li>
      <li>Hard to find in stores :).</li>
      <li>It does not wash out as quickly as some of the other at-home hair colors do</li>
      <li>I used to get my hair done professionally</li>
      <li>an old [[ASIN:B01NGTV4J5 Cascade]] container) to put the bottle in</li>
      <li>The package contained one of each: neutralizer, color, conditioner and professional gloves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>The products leaves my hair exceptionally soft, silky, and shiny.</li>
      <li>home color kits tend to contain harsher chemicals than professional grade color kits, like those used in a salon, which is why I was nervous about trying a home color kit.</li>
      <li>The top of my head is extremely dramatic and really shows the color well.</li>
      <li>I am probably not a typical user, let me tell you why.</li>
      <li>This was my first experience using foam color at home, and it was messier than expected...</li>
      <li>I used this product on my natural blonde hair.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Love this color!  It stays shiney and has no horrible odor  Hard to find in stores :). The foam is great but hard to use just  At the roots, I wish it came with a tip applicator.  Overall great  Product.</li>
    <li> This John Frieda Precision foam showed up about a week after the order was placed. I thought this was a reasonable amount of time. I love the color on my hair. I have no complaints about this product. I would highly recommend this for anyone who does their own hair at home. It&#x27;s cheaper than in the store and works great!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t use any other at-home hair dyes. I use John Frieda Precision Foam Color 1-2x a year and the color really lasts and my hair gets an amazing shine after every application! I get compliments about my hair color all the time, even after several months! I love foam dyes because of the even-ness of the color and ease of application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even though I&#x27;m only 22, I do have some grey roots and these cover great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t hesitate to buy this over the $2-3 cheap drugstore hair dyes. Your hair will thank you! The conditioner included is great and seals the color in. I apply it once a week for the first month and works wonders.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Been using this product in various colors for the past 5 years and my hair is great!</li>
    <li> I use 3VR.  I used to get my hair done professionally but i got older and tried to stick to 1 hair color.  I was mixing various boxes of color at one point until i saw this come out and was interested in trying out the foam form of color.  (i mixed boxes to get the right color AND because 1 box was never enough! and i have shoulder length hair or a little longer) This stuff is great and there is always plenty of color for full coverage.  When applying it its really simple and always covers well.  If you get it on your skin you can just rub at it for a bit after its done processing and it will come off which is wonderful unlike my past experiences with other brands.  If you can still see a little shadow of rubbed off color it will be gone by the next hair wash.  The color always comes our super even on me- I start out with the crown and move to the front then kinda squish it into everything else.  I have been using this since it came out- probably 2 years or more.  I have had 1 bad experience with a box where it made my hair smell really weird and the texture was strange but amazon sent me a new box and everything has been fine since.  I wouldnt know what to do if they stopped making it.</li>
    <li> The color is so cute and you dont have to spend 15 dollars on it if you get it from the store</li>
    <li> I love the end result of this color! The products leaves my hair exceptionally soft, silky, and shiny. It does not wash out as quickly as some of the other at-home hair colors do</li>
    <li> I bought this product when it first came out. Thank God that I had coupons so I ended up picking this product up for about $2.  About 20% of my hair has gone gray.  I used this product and within a day all the dye off of my gray hairs was gone. Literally it washed off.  I have used numerous hair dye products and I never had this issue. The application is easy however the foam does dry rather quickly.  I would suggest another dye product if you are looking for grey coverage.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t cover grey well; the texture was great and the ease of use was great.</li>
    <li> This was my first experience using foam color at home, and it was messier than expected...saying that, however, color matched expectations and covered evenly as promised. I will likely purchase this product again</li>
    <li> I really like this dye!  The color is really nice and it looks different in different light which I find really neat.  The foam was really easy to use (much easier than liquid dye) and there was a lot of it in the bottle.  I used the full box, but I have long hair that&#x27;s really curly so you have to have a LOT of hair to require 2 boxes.  What I liked most about this dye was that it was really easy to get off your skin around your hair line and ears.  With some other dyes I&#x27;ve used it would take a LOT of scrubbing and days of washing before it would come off.  With this I literally just wiped it off which was great.  The only reason I&#x27;m not giving it 5 stars is because it left my hair feeling really dried out.  With other cheaper box dyes it always seemed like my hair felt better after dying it, but my hair feels kind of gross now in the shower.  I only dyed it last night though so I&#x27;m sure that will go away, and you can&#x27;t tell after it dries or anything so it&#x27;s not that bad.  I would definitely buy this dye again!</li>
    <li> I purchased this Deep Cherry Brown (3VR) color because I wanted something different than jet black for fall. The side of the box reveals that this color indeed works for black hair, so I was excited because it&#x27;s sometimes hard to lighten black hair. I took the product home and dyed my hair according to instructions and, unexpectedly, it turned my roots a cherry cola color but didn&#x27;t touch the remainder of my black hair. I&#x27;m guessing this is because my roots are virgin hair, while the rest of my hair is the product of another boxed dye. So, I desperately went back to the store and picked up a hair stripping agent/bleach and bleached my entire head of hair and redyed it this Deep Cherry Brown color. The results are nice. The top of my head is extremely dramatic and really shows the color well. The mid sections/ends of my hair are still a bit dark, but the color is revealed well in the sun/light.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, unless your dark brown/black hair is virgin hair, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this color unless you are willing to strip your hair before using it. I don&#x27;t necessarily like to bleach my hair because of the harsh chemicals that bleach contains, but I really wanted this shade of red.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this dye for more than 5 years now. I have a fragrance sensitivity but the smell of the chemicals doesn&#x27;t trigger my asthma or cause headaches/migraines which is almost unheard of for me so it&#x27;s perfect for my needs. I don&#x27;t use the provided conditioner because that scent is overwhelming for me, so it typically gets tossed out in favor of my regular conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I pre-prep my area by putting down a HUGE 50-gallon garbage can bag, the one you&#x27;d use when it&#x27;s time to rake leaves during fall, under my folding chair to protect the carpet. Grab the clothes I typically use when I dye my hair, an old plastic tub (mine&#x27;s an old [[ASIN:B01NGTV4J5 Cascade]] container) to put the bottle in so I don&#x27;t stain my sink/countertop, and my trusty hair clip, brush, and the cheap tub of Vaseline. Typically the tub houses everything when they are not in use, I just leave it in my storage area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I start off by brushing my oily hair out, I don&#x27;t dye with clean hair because I read it&#x27;s bad for your hair. I&#x27;ll put Vaseline on all the areas that I don&#x27;t want to be stained like my forehead, temples, and ears. I admit I don&#x27;t follow the directions provided, I start with at the bottom and work my way up because I tend to miss patches since I can&#x27;t actually see what I&#x27;m doing and feeling through gloves vs feeling with your hands is completely different. I have a hair clip that&#x27;s dedicated to my dye jobs because it&#x27;s been colored time and time again. I&#x27;ll let loose a 1&amp;#34; section at the bottom of my head and foam it up until its completely saturated, then I&#x27;ll keep doing the same thing until I get to the crown. I&#x27;m one of those ladies that got the short straw when it comes to genetics, I started getting stark white hair at age 16 ( it&#x27;s a small-ish amount of hair) so I&#x27;ll use whatever is left and foam the top of my head until it&#x27;s completely drenched. The directions recommend leaving it in for 30 minutes (max) with stubborn white/grey hair, but I go for 45 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll hang out in my pre-prepped area with water and my laptop/iPad so I can watch videos while my dye is soaking in. After the 45 min has passed I rinse my hair with cool water until I don&#x27;t see any dye left in the water. I&#x27;ll then use my regular conditioner and let it soak in for 5 minutes. Once it&#x27;s soaked in I&#x27;ll rinse it out generously again with cool water. I allow it to air dry and leave it alone (avoid washing/styling) for as long as I possibly can, which is about 3 days before I go batty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The color payoff is stunning. It looks like I went to a salon but I&#x27;m paying drugstore/Amazon prices! I typically buy 2 boxes of the 3VR each time I restock and I color every 6 weeks if not more frequently, just because of the white hairs glaring at me. When I first dye it&#x27;s a super dark red that looks brown (indoors) but when you go outside your hair just lights up and shines in the sun with a crimson/burgundy glow that draws in the eyes of those that surround you. I&#x27;ve had so many compliments on this color asking me where I get my hair done, they never believe that I do it myself at home!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While the 3VR Radiant Red Deep Cherry Brown is my husband&#x27;s preferred color, and honestly it is mine too, I also enjoy the deep 3N Brilliant Brunette occasionally, although he&#x27;ll pout when I change it to the darker brown.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I won&#x27;t stop using this product unless, god forbid, it gets discontinued one day. Then at that time I&#x27;ll be crying and pleading on the phone with John Freida begging them to bring it back.</li>
    <li> I love this hair dye! Its a good brand. The instructions are super easy, and since its a foam its easy to apply to your hair. The kit comes with its own bottle, gloves and a conditioner that keeps you hair color in. But make sure you use the whole bottle of hair dye. The colors are so beautiful and vibrant. This is a wonderful brand, I recommend it for everyone!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I really loved this Deep Cherry Brown color and had been searching for a color like this for a long time since my regular color had been discontinued for a long time now.&lt;br /&gt;First of all this foam is a joke!  It does not penetrate into the hair at all...I followed the instructions to the letter and applied it just as recommended on the box/package.  It did not soak into my hair, no matter what I did. I massaged it into the roots that had grown out, then into the rest of my hair plus I combed it through.  I made sure my hair was as saturated with the color foam as I could get it.&lt;br /&gt;Second...when I rinsed the color off...which by the way, I left on for 30 minutes as was stated in the instructions for grey coverage...then I rinsed it and dried as directed....hardly any at all rinsed out of my hair and I rinsed for a long time, then I dried and styled as usual..only to find that this foam product  missed spots completely!  I ended up with polka dot hair and just a slight color on my roots!  This product was definitely not worth the $12 price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Last but not least...the thing I disliked the most about this color...it completely dried out my hair!  I had the worst static from using it and not until I washed my hair again and used a deep conditioner did it go away!  I have never had static that bad in my hair..ever.  And I even colored my hair when it was raining...plus it rained for another 3 days after wards, so the weather was quite humid and I still had the worst static ever!  I complained to the company that it did not cover well at all and of the dryness and all I got was an apology!!  Oh well...live and learn!  I wont use this again!</li>
    <li> I hate that Target has stopped carrying my color. Guess there aren&#x27;t enough redheads out there.&lt;br /&gt;I like this one though, good coverage and deep color.</li>
    <li> covers grays but i find i already need a touch up after 2 weeks.  this is not the case with other permanent hair colors i&#x27;ve tried.</li>
    <li> I love the color, which comes out as a really really dark auburn when you leave it on for a total of 30 minutes and gradually fades to dark auburn with daily shampooing.  The foam is really easy to cover your roots with, and tangling is not a problem like with cream hair colors.  The conditioner leaves my hair really shiny.</li>
    <li> the color did not stay, the price was great but it suck the color did not last in my hair</li>
    <li> I am probably not a typical user, let me tell you why. I have been \\&quot;No Poo\\&quot; [...] for seven months. I&#x27;ve been looking for a way to color my hair without chemicals. My last few color options haven&#x27;t work well, so I decided to try an at home color kit. John Frieda won out because it looked easy, straight forward and I liked their color options. The package contained one of each: neutralizer, color, conditioner and professional gloves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I followed the instructions and tilted the bottle between 4-5 times and allowed it sit for a few minutes while I got ready. There is no way to actually pump the bottle, even though it looks like a pump. The instructions state to squeeze out a golf size ball of foam and begin applying to roots and work through to the end. It wasn&#x27;t as easy to actually work the foam through the ends, so I scrunched the foam into my ends until they were completely saturated and worked as much foam into may hair as possible. I used the entire bottle and concentrated on the areas with heavy regrowth. I had applied conditioner around my hairline prior, in case of minor drips to eliminate staining. I did however need to tilt my head down to apply the color to the back of my head so I didn&#x27;t end up with a big mess. There were not drips, the foam stayed in place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I waited 30 minutes, my head was no longer foamy, but the color stayed put without dripping. I rinsed and conditioned. I comb my hair in the shower with a wide tooth comb-I have naturally curly hair and found that this is the best way to preserve the curl. My hair feels great and looks great. The color is a little darker than I expected, but I like it, it covered my heavy regrowth perfectly. The deep cherry color is not as red as I would have expected, or brassy, so I&#x27;m happy. The depth and dimension to the color are just what I was looking for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At home color kits tend to contain harsher chemicals than professional grade color kits, like those used in a salon, which is why I was nervous about trying a home color kit. I didn&#x27;t want to go to a salon, because I was afraid they&#x27;d insist on shampooing my hair. So far, so good...my hair looks and feels healthy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Easy to use&lt;br /&gt;Easy to follow instruction with pictures&lt;br /&gt;1.6 oz resealable conditioner&lt;br /&gt;Great coverage&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Darker than color on the boxying a home color kit.

    <li> Nothing happened ... I just gave away 20 dollars .... the conditioner in the pack is good .. but that is not the point ... I wanted a good color product ... if I would have wanted a conditioner I would have bought one.</li>
    <li> Love the color just have to re dye every four weeks fades out even using red john Frieda shampoo and conditioner</li>
    <li> I have black hair.  This covers the grays pretty well.  The black hair was not touched.  The color is ok.</li>
    <li> This color lasts as long as my color from a professional lasted and I like the color even more. Easy to  use and not messy. I&#x27;d never colored it myself until I used this product. I&#x27;ve gotten lots of compliments on the color too. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I had heard some great things about this hair dye, so I decided to try it out. I used this product on my natural blonde hair. The application process was terrible. It is a foam dye, but when I applied it, it would disappear. In the instructions it said that it should remain a foam. Also, with the foam dye I noticed you need a lot more product to fully cover and saturate the hair. I ended up with a very splotchy application, and damaged hair. I had to go out and buy more to try and fix what had happened, but it just made my hair worse. I went out and bought some Manic Panic hair dye in Vampire Red to cover everything up and brighten the red. It worked amazingly. I wish I had just used this vegan and non-damaging hair dye from the start! Using this hair dye is one of my biggest regrets. Maybe I didn&#x27;t use it correctly or it was just my hair, but I HATE it. I would never repurchase. Also, it didn&#x27;t even give me the hair color that was shown on the box. For me this was a very crappy product and very damaging! I do know most hair dye will cause damage, but this one was terrible.</li>
    <li> Just started week 6 with this hair color, and it&#x27;s still pretty strong in color. I love this color, it&#x27;s not overwhelming, it gives off a dark natural brownish red color which is just gorgeous. I&#x27;m ordering another box so I can re-do the color in a couple of weeks, only because the grey hairs are poking through.</li>
