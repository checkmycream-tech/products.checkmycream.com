    <li> L&#x27;oreal doesn&#x27;t make this anymore.  It is my 90 year-old mom&#x27;s favorite color.  She still fixes her hair, does her nails, etc.  She looks great, and this  was a thrill for her that you have this in stock.  I bought several of these and she laughs and says she hopes she&#x27;s around long enough to use them all.  THANKS!!!!!</li>
