      <li>I can not say enough good things about Olive Gold 03.</li>

      <li>It absorbs fairly quickly.  </li>
      <li>in generale this product in its original shape it does exactly what it says it do .</li>
      <li>a truly amazing, versatile, and universal product/supplement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Worth the price.</li>
      <li>It was soft and smooth from the mask but adding this oil immediately made my face hydrated, light, and non-oily.</li>
      <li>I love natural products.</li>
      <li>that&#x27;s right where it went...</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t see any benefits or positive changes when using Ozonated Olive Gold Super Oxygen .</li>
      <li>Unless you have to keep applying this stuff for many, many months, I do not know how so many of these other people get such &amp;#34;miraculous&amp;#34; results and healings.  </li>
      <li>and I actually had a plastic surgeon comment on how healthy my skin is.</li>
      <li>I use it on my dogs skin problems that tend to flare up when its hot and humid or if he gets bit by any bugs while laying out on the lawn.</li>
      <li>Tried it as a basic body moisturizer - it wasn&#x27;t any better than any off the shelf moisturizer,  and I used it for some skin &#x27;growths&#x27; twice a day as recommended and it made no difference.</li>
      <li>I know the value of the product so am not afraid to really rub it in my skin.</li>
      <li>One product, with a wide yet effective bunch of applications.</li>
      <li>I have used this product for years, many different uses</li>
      <li>Price is alittle HIGH!!</li>
      <li>I have even brushed my teeth with it more than a handful of times (unscented).</li>
      <li>I mix this with a a quarter sized of pure also gel and use on my face after washing.</li>
      <li>It soothes it and really helps the dryness.  </li>
      <li>But the two of these together is really helping.  </li>
      <li>This product is very thing with an absorbent olive oil</li>
      <li>Two years ago he was constantly at the vet trying a different kind of spray for his skin issues.</li>
      <li>MultiPurpose Super Skin Care Lotion\\&quot; is because its beneficial results are not limited to any one ailment, condition, or dis-ease.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I have used this product previously and I just love it.</li>
      <li>Love this product, I have been using it for several yrs now and will cont to use it in the future!  </li>
      <li>Highly recommended.</li>
      <li>fine lines, bruising, patches of rough skin, acne, etc.</li>
      <li>I could not believe the results of how much younger I looked after my first day of use!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m noticing the fine lines and dark marks diminishing.</li>
      <li>Do Not waste your money!</li>
      <li>My Dr recommended thsi product and he was surprised that it DID NOTHING for me !</li>
      <li>I think it helps de-age the skin and also keep it clear.</li>
      <li>but, it leaves your skin incredibly soft, and looking nourished.  </li>
      <li>I have replaced my facial moisturizer with Olive Gold, which I believe is much healthier to use.</li>
      <li>This was a gift for my 90-year old mother who has lots of aches &amp; pains.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m 51 years old</li>
      <li>In the last 3 to 4 weeks,  I have tested this miracle lotion with success and or relief with the following issues:</li>
      <li>/&gt;Olive Gold 03 can help relieve pain and neutralize harmful pathogens and toxins by providing an abundance of fresh ozone (or oxygen) plus other vital minerals and vitamins.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>you will get a pattern down relatively quick.    </li>
      <li>This has really helped my husbands dry skin . . .</li>
      <li>Although Olive Gold doesn&#x27;t take the pain away completely, it calms the nerves enough that I can get some sleep.  </li>
      <li>And now the health benefits of olive oil are really starting to come alive.</li>
      <li>The ozone part of this product is probably complete hooey, but, and this is a big</li>
      <li>It is a lot less expensive to use good old Kitchen Olive oil!!</li>
      <li>Not a single improvement in any area.  </li>
      <li>product says a little gies a long way, they are right.</li>
      <li>I have spent so much money on trying to find something to help my lines and dry skin.  </li>

    <li> Absolutely wonderful product</li>
    <li> I love this product. It&#x27;s non-greasy formula just soaks right into my skin!!</li>
    <li> My niece introduced me to this item.  Thought I would give it a try.  She suffers from a very painful skin lymphoma.&lt;br /&gt;The item helps some with her skin.  I&#x27;ve used it almost every other night.  After exercise, my skin is sore and red in parts. It soothes it and really helps the dryness.  It&#x27;s a great moisturizer!  It absorbs fairly quickly.  Though, expensive, I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Olive Gold 03 might be one of the best products that I have ever used .. on nearly anything. I have even brushed my teeth with it more than a handful of times (unscented). But anyway, let me go over some benefits of this and why this product makes for a truly amazing, versatile, and universal product/supplement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reason why Olive Gold 03 is the \\&quot;Ultimate MultiPurpose Super Skin Care Lotion\\&quot; is because its beneficial results are not limited to any one ailment, condition, or dis-ease.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Olive Gold 03 can help relieve pain and neutralize harmful pathogens and toxins by providing an abundance of fresh ozone (or oxygen) plus other vital minerals and vitamins.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I even rub OG03 on my temples and forehead before I go to bed as I think it has enriched my brain function like my awareness, alertness, and mental clarity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I rub it on stretch marks and muscle pains (calfs and hamstrings especially) ..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We all know Olive Oil has been touted as one of the most amazing and universal oils to use, whether cooking or skin care .. olives in history have always been valued and looked at as a special \\&quot;entity\\&quot;. And now the health benefits of olive oil are really starting to come alive. OG03 takes olive oil (which is already great by itself) and infuses it with ozone, providing it will plenty of extra oxygen which is your body&#x27;s life line. In addition to the oxygen, it has 72 minerals, super charged vitamins, and alpha-lipoic-acid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I like about Olive Gold is that on top of its detoxifying and cleansing properties, I love the way it energizes my skin and makes it look real nourished and moisturized. Olive Gold never clogs my pores and does not have the traditional oily, greasy, or sticky feel to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For any of you who are interested in more about this product and in specific, one of the best reads on ozone and oxygen in relation to your body and its health status, read Ed McCabe&#x27;s Book - [[ASIN:0962052728 Flood Your Body with Oxygen]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A few other things is:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) The product stays fresh and good for 2 years.&lt;br /&gt;2) A little goes a long way .. it spreads nicely and does not clump or get nasty. Start out with a few squirts per area .. you will get a pattern down relatively quick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line, I dont leave the house without this stuff! Its small enough to put in the car or a purse! Use it on anything, you will be impressed.1) The product stays fresh and good for 2 years.  2) A little goes a long way .. it spreads nicely and does not clump or get nasty.

    <li> The Olive Gold did nothing for me.</li>
    <li> My Dr recommended thsi product and he was surprised that it DID NOTHING for me ! It is a lot less expensive to use good old Kitchen Olive oil!! Do Not waste your money!</li>
    <li> Feels great on this skin. I actually think I&#x27;m seeing my brown spots fade?!</li>
    <li> I mix this with a a quarter sized of pure also gel and use on my face after washing. It leaves the skin in amazing condition and it&#x27;s my best kept secrete. I think it helps de-age the skin and also keep it clear.</li>
    <li> Love this product! Leaves my skin feeling supple and youthful. Recommend it. Worth the price.</li>
    <li> it slowly helps my tracheotamy scar</li>
    <li> I could not believe the results of how much younger I looked after my first day of use! This stuff helps produce more collagen like expensive beauty products advertise. In the last 3 to 4 weeks,  I have tested this miracle lotion with success and or relief with the following issues: Beauty product for face and skin, pain relief for spasmodic muscles and joint pain. Sinus and allergy problems, toenail fungus, anxiety in the chest, migraines, enhanced energy (taken internally), mental clarity has been enhanced. Metabolism is picking up. I can not say enough good things about Olive Gold 03. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Good product! Price is alittle HIGH!!</li>
    <li> This was a gift for my 90-year old mother who has lots of aches &amp; pains. A friend had recommended it to her. She&#x27;s on her second bottle now and swears by it. She says it relieves pain more than anything else she&#x27;s tried.</li>
    <li> Garbage... that&#x27;s right where it went... I have the upmost faith in ozone products but this failed to provide any relief to countless friends I tried it on... sry olive gold... I wanted to believe in you 😟</li>
    <li> This is my third bottle of this stuff.  I put it on scrapes I get on my arms from pruning my roses, on little burns I might get from cooking, little breakouts from nerves, chapped lips, and my husbands uses it on his psoriasis&lt;br /&gt;Great stuff!</li>
    <li> I love natural products. This is one of the best one I ran into. Olive gold O3 does not feel heavy on your skin. It makes your skin glow and look healthier. I enjoy using Olive gold O3!</li>
    <li> This has really helped my husbands dry skin . . . it is easy to use and has made his skin more soft and comfortable for him.</li>
    <li> Got this to get rid of acne and just have healthier skin but didn&#x27;t notice a difference. Waste of $$$</li>
    <li> Excellent product.  Used it for a number of years.  Besides a skin product is excellent for body pains muscle or bone.</li>
    <li> This is the most amazing product I have ever used. I use it for just about everything,including sore muscles, moisturizer, and a circulatory problem my Husband has on his legs. I will never be without this product.</li>
    <li> This oil is great for oil pulling...it works wonders for oral hygiene. This oil is great for the face...after applying/rinsing off mask (Indian healing clay), applied this oil to face and my face felt like a cloud. It was soft and smooth from the mask but adding this oil immediately made my face hydrated, light, and non-oily. With daily use of the oil on face I&#x27;m noticing the fine lines and dark marks diminishing. Happy I stumbled upon this product.</li>
    <li> This removed a wart? or skin cancer? blotch from my face. Don&#x27;t trust allopathic doc&#x27;s and trusted a &#x27;natural&#x27; practitioner that recommended this for other reasons(pain). This reduced some wrinkles too. Non greasy and very pleased w/ this product.</li>
    <li> Helps to smooth out my skin.</li>
    <li> super oil goes on the skin nicely and does not leave after grease feeling used it under makeup.</li>
    <li> Olive Gold is awesome. I use it on my dogs skin problems that tend to flare up when its hot and humid or if he gets bit by any bugs while laying out on the lawn. Two years ago he was constantly at the vet trying a different kind of spray for his skin issues. Since discovering olive gold thru a friend; my dogs skin has been healthier and he has been more compfortable.</li>
    <li> Threw all my other skin care stuff away.  One product, with a wide yet effective bunch of applications.</li>
    <li> I have used this product previously and I just love it. I had purchased it in the past, however, where&lt;br /&gt;I had bought it from went out of business and I was so pleased to see that you sold this product.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent moisturizer, after using for several months have seen some brown &amp;#34;spots&amp;#34; diminished,so will continue to use and monitor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not greasy after the absorption period, which is for any moisturizer best to allow at least  10 min before foundation is applied.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Clean ingredients!</li>
    <li> i could have given this product the full 5 stars but some how this time the product is not having the same effect like the ones i got before may be because their is several producers . in generale this product in its original shape it does exactly what it says it do .</li>
    <li> The ozone part of this product is probably complete hooey, but, and this is a big but, it leaves your skin incredibly soft, and looking nourished.  I&#x27;ve been faithfully using this after every shower on my body for about 2 years now and I really do love it. I find it too heavy for my face, it made me break out.  I&#x27;m 51 years old and I actually had a plastic surgeon comment on how healthy my skin is. Now that&#x27;s an endorsement!!</li>
    <li> Have not used it enough to comment on how I like it.  I have  heard great reports on this product.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for two years. I believe it is healthy for my skin. If you have sunburn, a rash or feel you want a smooth, glowing skin, this is the product. I even mix it into my Shea butter body cream and apply it to my face. I am very pleased with the results I receive from this product.</li>
    <li> Made no difference in my skin. Tried it as a basic body moisturizer - it wasn&#x27;t any better than any off the shelf moisturizer,  and I used it for some skin &#x27;growths&#x27; twice a day as recommended and it made no difference.</li>
    <li> Love this product, I have been using it for several yrs now and will cont to use it in the future!  :)</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t see any benefits or positive changes when using Ozonated Olive Gold Super Oxygen . Nice as a moisturizer .</li>
    <li> I use this every day...helps my back with pain. I use it all over even on my face. I just wish the price is cheaper..its way over priced!</li>
    <li> I use Olive Gold for neuropathy of the lower limbs.  After 5 spine operations, there are days when my feet &amp; lower legs are just &amp;#34;screaming&amp;#34;.  Although Olive Gold doesn&#x27;t take the pain away completely, it calms the nerves enough that I can get some sleep.  I wouldn&#x27;t be without it!  I would highly recommend Olive Gold to anyone dealing with painful neuropathy.</li>
    <li> I have spent so much money on trying to find something to help my lines and dry skin.  I know how oxygen help the skin so I purchased this to see how it works.  I&#x27;m in my 2nd week now and I truly czn see the difference in my facial tone, the creases around my eyes and mouth has lessened and my face feels and looks better.  I have slso been using the lemon flavored hydralonic &amp; Vit C which was slowly working.  But the two of these together is really helping.  I&#x27;m over 60 and to finally see results, we&#x27;ll do I need to say more.&lt;br /&gt;This product says a little gies a long way, they are right. This product is very thing with an absorbent olive oil so it takes very little. You can use it as often during the day as you wish.  I really love this product.</li>
    <li> The Olive Gold 03 is an excellent product.  I have been using it for over a month and have seen a significant reduction is age spots and it keeps your skin from drying out for a long time (days) even with daily showering.</li>
    <li> Great product. I used it for acne. Works great.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t believe the number of 5 star endorsements.  Can&#x27;t help but think they are all fake.  I tried this stuff, twice a day, for several weeks and noticed NOTHING.  My wife and tried it on various skin conditions: scars, acne, moles, skin tags, age spots, etc.  Not a single improvement in any area.  Unless you have to keep applying this stuff for many, many months, I do not know how so many of these other people get such &amp;#34;miraculous&amp;#34; results and healings.  Some of these &amp;#34;buyer&amp;#34; endorsements sound so phoney baloney it makes you think the people are connected to this company in one fashion or another.  Buyer beware.</li>
    <li> I am very happy with the feel of this oil on my skin. I know the value of the product so am not afraid to really rub it in my skin.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Olive Gold for years. Am so happy I found it On Amazon.com. I have replaced my facial moisturizer with Olive Gold, which I believe is much healthier to use. I&#x27;ve also used it to get rid of skin problems.....fine lines, bruising, patches of rough skin, acne, etc. Wish I had known about it years ago.</li>
