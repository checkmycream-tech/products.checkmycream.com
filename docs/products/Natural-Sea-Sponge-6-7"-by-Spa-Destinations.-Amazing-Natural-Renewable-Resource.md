      <li>but you can get rid of the smell with strong scented soap</li>

      <li>these are so fun in the tub.</li>
      <li>I love the natural feeling of this sponge.  </li>

      <li>I did not realize there was such a great difference between sponges labeled as for the same purpose.  </li>
      <li>It is huge and soft.</li>

      <li>Worth every penny, does not fall apart and rices very well.</li>
      <li>It fell apart after first use.</li>
      <li>Fell apart after first use.</li>
      <li>My old one was quite a bit smaller so am happy to have a larger one.</li>
      <li>A little coarser than the normal type,  but good in the bath for cleaning,  also for skin scale removal.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s definitely a large sponge.  </li>
      <li>Too large, irregular shaped and course.</li>
      <li>It was a bit too large for my hand</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a nice sized sponge that foams very well, however it broke into 3 pieces in less than 2 weeks.</li>
      <li>that 2 of them started to fall apart after 1 month,but the 3rd one has been fine.</li>
      <li>I love a natural sponge and this one is large enough to hold</li>
      <li>It is comfortable to use, seems to be very sturdy and should last quite awhile.</li>
      <li>shower gel feel like it is really cleaning .</li>
      <li>, however, it does seem that it will hold up very well</li>
      <li>Arrived product was more than I expected.  </li>
      <li>It rinses out very well after use.  </li>
      <li>Makes taking a bath a real pleasure.</li>
      <li>I use it daily and must say that my only complaint is that I thought it would do a bit of a better job at exfoliating, but if you&#x27;re looking for a good lather from a REAL sponge</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m turning my whole family into natural sponge lovers!!</li>
      <li>Love it really, just wish they wouldn&#x27;t cut it in half</li>
      <li>Keeps very clean and holds up very well if allowed to dry completely between uses.</li>
      <li>A little bit big for my hands but all the more fun to wring out the hot water.</li>
      <li>then I&#x27;d highly recommend it.</li>
      <li>Like the texture, but wouldn&#x27;t mind it a little more exfoliating.</li>
      <li>I think it is worth the extra cost.</li>
      <li>Probably won&#x27;t last long, but it makes showering with gel a lot more fun, and makes the bath gel last longer.  </li>
      <li>To clean it I soak it in hot water with a little tea tree oil added.  </li>
      <li>A NEW ONE STILL HAVE NOT RECEIVED.</li>
      <li>I have an older natural sponge that was just about on</li>
      <li>Not scratchy or stiff and easily rinsed.  </li>
      <li>The sponge itself arrived on time and REALLY is natural sea sponge (which is so hard to find these days since they are mostly all synthetic).</li>
      <li>sea sponge which I bought from store is sooo soft just like having cloud rubbing against skin!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;There&#x27;s also break inbetween  </li>
      <li>wow THERE IS NO COMPARISEN ON THE WALMART YUCK.</li>
      <li>I was looking for one to help gently wash skin that has been under medical dressings.  </li>
      <li>you can nearly use it even on your body.</li>
      <li>I also bought one for my adult daughter and two for my twin baby granddaughters.  </li>
      <li>I have yet to find a natural sea sponge priced accordingly...</li>
      <li>Plus there is a soft side for like your face or an easy clean and a tuff side for a hard dirty clean .</li>
      <li>Big size as described and soft to the skin in the shower.  </li>
      <li>My first natural sponge, I like the rough side on one end and soft on the other.  </li>
      <li>When I first got it there was a little piece barley hanging on and guess what it&#x27;s still there .</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This sponge is great for the shower with bath gel.  The last one I bought lasted over a year.  To clean it I soak it in hot water with a little tea tree oil added.  Would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I threw it out. Waste of money.</li>
    <li> If you want a sponge as an exfoliator, this would be the one for you.  I was looking for one to help gently wash skin that has been under medical dressings.  I got one at a soap shop in FL, but wasn&#x27;t able to find one in Mich.  I did not realize there was such a great difference between sponges labeled as for the same purpose.  I&#x27;d suggest if you have medical needs for a sponge or want to use it on your face. then I would purchase one just for the face.</li>
    <li> It is a perfect sponge and is soft and comfy but no sponges are the same so it is not like the pic but it still rocks I love it but if you haven&#x27;t ordered a sponge before you need to now that this is not like the pic but this is a great company and the sponge is great !!!!!!! When I first got it there was a little piece barley hanging on and guess what it&#x27;s still there . The sponges only problem is that it smells like fish pee but you can get rid of the smell with strong scented soap just make sure you like the smell . Plus there is a soft side for like your face or an easy clean and a tuff side for a hard dirty clean . Over all I love the sponge !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> too rough...you can nearly use it even on your body. DO NOT BUY IT!</li>
    <li> it is not for human skin. it is rough as cleaning sponges. i am returning this.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s amazing how superior natural sponges are to synthetic ones</li>
    <li> Oh My Goodness!!! Love this sponge. It is huge and soft. Definitely would order from Spa Destinations again. They also included a special item for me.</li>
    <li> I love a natural sponge and this one is large enough to hold shower gel feel like it is really cleaning .</li>
    <li> Too large, irregular shaped and course. I ended up not using for showering and will keep for household cleaning. I was disappointed in this product.</li>
    <li> these are so fun in the tub. A little bit big for my hands but all the more fun to wring out the hot water. Thank you</li>
    <li> Worth every penny, does not fall apart and rices very well. Previously purchased a sea sponge from Walmart wow THERE IS NO COMPARISEN ON THE WALMART YUCK. this sponge is just awesome you feel the clean.</li>
    <li> Somewhat uneven shape but generally acceptable, recommended.</li>
    <li> Fell apart after first use. Total waste of money.</li>
    <li> did not like this item,the picture looks very soft,but it was still hard and ruff after wetting</li>
    <li> I have been using &amp;#34;sponges&amp;#34; bought at retail stores and they don&#x27;t match the quality of this sponge. It is comfortable to use, seems to be very sturdy and should last quite awhile. It is just right size for me, easy to hold and maneuver around the body. Cheaper sponges I have bought seem to start falling apart fairly soon and are not as effective at washing as this one. I think it is worth the extra cost. Very well pleased.</li>
    <li> Disappointed in size of product. Only 5.5 inches long a the longest part (the sponge is angled and the shortest is about 4&amp;#34;. Only 4 inches wide.  I would post a photo but can&#x27;t find that option for this product.</li>
    <li> It fell apart after first use.</li>
    <li> Poor quality and small.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a nice sized sponge that foams very well, however it broke into 3 pieces in less than 2 weeks.</li>
    <li> Quite good for it&#x27;s size</li>
    <li> The sponge itself arrived on time and REALLY is natural sea sponge (which is so hard to find these days since they are mostly all synthetic). I&#x27;ve had it a few weeks now and it isn&#x27;t falling apart nor does it harbor any funky smells (a big problem with synthetics). I use it daily and must say that my only complaint is that I thought it would do a bit of a better job at exfoliating, but if you&#x27;re looking for a good lather from a REAL sponge then I&#x27;d highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Fell apart after a couple uses. Company hard to get in touch with for refund.</li>
    <li> i like the feel of these sponges but a liitle disappointed in that 2 of them started to fall apart after 1 month,but the 3rd one has been fine.Dont know if i would buy from this company again,i would have to think about it.</li>
    <li> I will probably be using one of them on my skin and the other for my apothecary jar.  They fit fine in the jar.</li>
    <li> Great Quality! just what I had hoped for.</li>
    <li> It was a bit too large for my hand so I cut it in half, not as soft as I would like but having the list enclosed with the shipment will help me make a different choice next time, however, it does seem that it will hold up very well &amp; that is good.</li>
    <li> Get rid of the washcloths and slippery soap holders.  This soft bath sponge is hand size and works well holding a squirt of soft bath soap or just a few rubs of a hand bar of soap.  Not scratchy or stiff and easily rinsed.  Good price, too.</li>
    <li> Read other reviews on durability, so have been very careful with it. Had if for a few weeks now and only starting to slowly rip at the parts you would expect. Should still be usable for a while after it does, it&#x27;s not like it&#x27;s going to fall apart. Like the texture, but wouldn&#x27;t mind it a little more exfoliating. Keeps very clean and holds up very well if allowed to dry completely between uses. Love it really, just wish they wouldn&#x27;t cut it in half that&#x27;s what is causing the rips. It is a good size, so I can see why but would prefer to have the option of whole unsplit sponges at different sizes.</li>
    <li> This sponge does the job.  A little coarser than the normal type,  but good in the bath for cleaning,  also for skin scale removal.  Not harsh but better than the silkier type.  Good choice.  EK</li>
    <li> I have yet to find a natural sea sponge priced accordingly...that I like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Whole Foods sells something of this quality for $10-$18 based on size.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll buy them from home going forward.</li>
    <li> While price varies in this size, I choose this comfortably priced one.  Arrived product was more than I expected.  Big size as described and soft to the skin in the shower.  I love using this sea sponge.  Thank you very much for this good deal.</li>
    <li> Great for taking baths and showers. Soap rinses out for easily when you&#x27;re done. I hope to buy another one.</li>
    <li> This sponge falls apart after about a month of use. It is not durable but it does feel very nice against skin.</li>
    <li> Not happy !&lt;br /&gt;The sponge was hard and not as soft as i expect. It feels like artifical sponge.&lt;br /&gt;Natural sea sponge which I bought from store is sooo soft just like having cloud rubbing against skin!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;There&#x27;s also break inbetween  and i  think sponge will not last.</li>
    <li> My first natural sponge, I like the rough side on one end and soft on the other.  Probably won&#x27;t last long, but it makes showering with gel a lot more fun, and makes the bath gel last longer.  I ordered the largest size--which I like.  Will probably buy again.</li>
    <li> After a few uses the product rips off in your hand</li>
    <li> Great size natural sponge. Well shaped and good quality.  Makes taking a bath a real pleasure. Very happy with purchase.</li>
    <li> USED 1 TIME CHUNKS CAME OUT. AFTER 3 TIME TORE IN HALF. THEY WERE TO SEND ME A NEW ONE STILL HAVE NOT RECEIVED.</li>
    <li> I have been using sea sponges religiously for years now, and this was the lowest quality sponge I have used.  It was very fragile and fell apart within less than a month.  It also wasn&#x27;t very good at exfoliating my skin, because it was so fragile.  This may be beneficial for a small child or infant (it&#x27;s very soft), but not worth any adult use - it won&#x27;t last.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s definitely a large sponge.  It definitely also fell apart after about a month of daily use in the shower.  Will not buy again.</li>
    <li> I love the natural feeling of this sponge.  It is rough enough to feel that it gives you a nice scrub, but doesn&#x27;t scrub your skin off!!  It rinses out very well after use.  I was using the plastic sponges from Bath and Body Works, but I like this much better.  I bought another one for my travel bag that goes everywhere I go.  I also bought one for my adult daughter and two for my twin baby granddaughters.  I&#x27;m turning my whole family into natural sponge lovers!!</li>
    <li> This is not the type of sponge that will last for more than a month.  My previous sponge lasted for years.</li>
    <li> I have an older natural sponge that was just about on it&#x27;s last leg! They seem to get softer over time and I love to use them in the bath as they hold so much water and squeeze out easily. My old one was quite a bit smaller so am happy to have a larger one.</li>
