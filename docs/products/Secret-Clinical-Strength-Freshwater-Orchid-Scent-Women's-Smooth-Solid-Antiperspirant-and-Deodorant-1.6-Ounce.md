### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Excellent service of Amazon as well!</li>
      <li>I was very impressed then.</li>
      <li>I could say this is the best working deodorant ever, I applied it after I showered immediately because that&#x27;s what the direction said.</li>
      <li>The best deodorant I&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>
      <li>This scent, the Freshwater Orchid is a beautiful scent.</li>
      <li>Great product.  </li>
      <li>Smells great and doesn&#x27;t clump up when you put it on.</li>
      <li>Love the strength and the great scent it gives out.</li>
      <li>and the results are actually pretty great!</li>
      <li>I love this deodorant!  </li>
      <li>I love it!</li>
      <li>This product works amazingly well.  </li>
      <li>Smells nice without being too florally.  </li>
      <li>AND IT WORKED NICELY....</li>
      <li>and I found this to be the most effective when applied 2x a day.</li>
      <li>more oz of product for more money.  </li>
      <li>Love it and you will not regret buying this products.</li>
      <li>Love it.</li>
      <li>Love it, will never use anything else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I love it more when Costco has a 3-pack on special.</li>
      <li>&gt; The most important part is to use this at night after shower before bed…</li>
      <li>Finally a deodorant that works all day and still smells great after 14 hours!&lt;br /</li>
      <li>The smell is sweet but not overpowering...</li>
      <li>The Water Orchid scent is light and not overbearing, although I prefer the powder scent or the fresh scent instead.  </li>
      <li>love it and totally will use it forever. :)</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m glad that they keep coming up with new scents.  </li>
      <li>I have some hormone issues and this keeps me fresh</li>
      <li>Worth the money.  </li>
      <li>I love that Amazon offers the multi-pack.  </li>
      <li>This wasn&#x27;t worth the purchase.  </li>
      <li>I have tried everything inlcuding all the higher end ones at Sephora etc.</li>
      <li>Buying the single stick for $11.47 is a better deal.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin either!  </li>
      <li>The price is pretty high for the soft solid, but online is the only place I can find it where I live.  </li>
      <li>This is a necessity for living out in the middle of the hot desert where I rarely see anything less than 100 degrees during the summer months.  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t think it protects any differently than normal non-clinical deoderant, but I like the soft solid.</li>
      <li>I have major problems sweating</li>
      <li>It barely worked already.</li>
      <li>No white lines and so far no stains on my clothes.</li>
      <li>One hint, is there&#x27;s not as much in the container as other deodorants.</li>
      <li>I bought regular Secret from another store and it worked even better.  </li>
      <li>Ok, so this stuff is more expensive than &amp;#34;regular&amp;#34; deodorant/antiperspirants, but if they don&#x27;t last through the day for you, then Secret Clinical Strength is the solution.</li>

    <li> Ok, so this stuff is more expensive than &amp;#34;regular&amp;#34; deodorant/antiperspirants, but if they don&#x27;t last through the day for you, then Secret Clinical Strength is the solution. This scent, the Freshwater Orchid is a beautiful scent. It&#x27;s floral but not overpowering. One hint, is there&#x27;s not as much in the container as other deodorants. But for people like me who would need to reapply the regular stuff several times a day...it probably ends up coming out the same.</li>
    <li> I love this deodorant!  The smell is sweet but not overpowering... It doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin either!  I love it!</li>
    <li> This product works amazingly well.  No more underarm odor at the end of the day.  Love it, will never use anything else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However - these are 1.6 oz sticks.  The stuff at the grocery/target/walmart is 2.6 oz.  You may be getting 2 sticks of deodorant but you&#x27;re only getting .6 more oz of product for more money.  Today, this product is 14.75.  It&#x27;s 11.47 for 2.6 oz here at Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Doing the math:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;$14.75/3.2 oz &#x3D; 4.60 dollars per ounce.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;11.47/2.6 oz &#x3D; 4.41 per ounce.  Buying the single stick for $11.47 is a better deal.</li>
    <li> It does the job well!  Smells nice without being too florally.  Keep in mind it&#x27;s almost like a cream.  You turn the dial 2 clicks and are supposed to put it on before bedtime (I don&#x27;t, I use it about 20 minutes after my shower).  I have some hormone issues and this keeps me fresh (:</li>
    <li> This wasn&#x27;t worth the purchase.  I bought regular Secret from another store and it worked even better.  Will not purchase again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m glad that they keep coming up with new scents.  Somehow my body seems to build a tolerance and I need to switch up every now and again.</li>
    <li> I could say this is the best working deodorant ever, I applied it after I showered immediately because that&#x27;s what the direction said. I was very impressed then. After I used it for two months, my underarm is just used to this deodorant... It barely worked already. My underarm started to get a little sweaty, and a bad odor was coming out from my underarm. Then, it got worse. So, my advice is to plan another brand after you use this for a few months.</li>
    <li> This is my go to deodorant. For me I find it is the only one that works well. It is really expensive in stores so I like that I can save just a bit online.</li>
    <li> It works even on men. Love the strength and the great scent it gives out. If you like a subtle scent (not perfume like) stick that endures repetitive heat moments throughout the day, this is for you.</li>
    <li> Finally a deodorant that works all day and still smells great after 14 hours!&lt;br /&gt; The most important part is to use this at night after shower before bed…&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise it doesn’t work!</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re into sports, this is a must have!</li>
    <li> I order this deodorant every opportunity I get.</li>
    <li> The best deodorant I&#x27;ve ever used.  Secret Clinical is the only product I&#x27;ve ever found that can keep me dry and smelling fresh from the time I leave the house in the morning until I return late at night.  This is a necessity for living out in the middle of the hot desert where I rarely see anything less than 100 degrees during the summer months.  The Water Orchid scent is light and not overbearing, although I prefer the powder scent or the fresh scent instead.  Great product.  Worth the money.  I love that Amazon offers the multi-pack.  I love it more when Costco has a 3-pack on special.</li>
    <li> I have gone thru over a dozen deoderants to not find any that worked until this one.  It has changed my confidence in how close I hug and what i wear now.  love it and totally will use it forever. :)</li>
    <li> The price is pretty high for the soft solid, but online is the only place I can find it where I live.  I don&#x27;t think it protects any differently than normal non-clinical deoderant, but I like the soft solid.</li>
    <li> Finally found something that works! Smells great and doesn&#x27;t clump up when you put it on. No white lines and so far no stains on my clothes.</li>
    <li> I have major problems sweating and I had tried this in the morning several times with only subpar results. I began putting it on at night before bed and again in the morning and the results are actually pretty great! I have tried everything inlcuding all the higher end ones at Sephora etc. and I found this to be the most effective when applied 2x a day.</li>
    <li> LIVING IN FLORIDA WITH THE HEAT AND HIGH HUMIDITY IS NOT EASY. I WAS SWEATING OFF THE OTHER BRANDS SO I TRIED THIS ONE AND IT WORKED NICELY....IMAGINE A DAY AT DISNEY IN AUGUST-MISERABLE TEMPS BUT IT LASTED!!</li>
    <li> I will never thought of buying other products. Love it and you will not regret buying this products. Love it. Excellent service of Amazon as well!</li>
