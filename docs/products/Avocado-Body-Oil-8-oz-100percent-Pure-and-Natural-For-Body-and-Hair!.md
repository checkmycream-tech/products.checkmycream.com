      <li>This avocado oil feels great on my skin and absorbs quickly with no scent.</li>
      <li>Love avocado oil, and love the pump bottle.!</li>
      <li>and I love the pump top!</li>
      <li>, it does not sit on top of the skin.</li>
      <li>Love this product.</li>
      <li>I would think it would be in a glass pump for better shelf life and to maintain quality.</li>
      <li>love the pump.</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;ve purchased many products, and nothing has worked..</li>
      <li>I use this on my hair and love it.</li>
      <li>Has so many benefits and nutrients in this.</li>
      <li>This stuff is magic, I absolutely love it.</li>
      <li>It is natural moisturizer for skin and best to put on right after shower.</li>
      <li>but I learned from research that is is very moisturzing on the skin and is good for the hair.  </li>
      <li>great to miv with essential oil</li>
      <li>I put it on my legs after I shave to keep them smooth.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t have an odor and absorbs quickly</li>
      <li>It has a pleasing smell and feel, is not greasy and soaks into your skin quickly.</li>
      <li>The bottle is a nice size, it is small but it fits nice on your counter.</li>
      <li>Works best on wet hair instead of dry.</li>
      <li>The pump is very convenient!</li>
      <li>My wife is using it for a month with positive results</li>
      <li>The product feels good; however I am skeptical it is not an over processed oil with zero benefits making its use strictly a good carrier oil that you could add pure essential oils to to add benefit. ???</li>
      <li>No substance like the one I bought from the whole food store would never buy again its just sitting in box not being used</li>
      <li>I then used a comb gently as he was sleeping, to comb put all of the  cradle cap, and that was that.</li>
      <li>and I really like it.  </li>
      <li>Everything that I have read about Avacadoe Oil that is pure &amp; not over refined says it should have a yellow tint &amp; a mild fragrance.</li>
      <li>I love that it is light and dont give that heavy feeling as other oils sometimes do</li>
      <li>I use this in my hair and it keeps it moisturized and soft.</li>
      <li>so it doesnt bother you or anyone near you.</li>
      <li>This product is completely in accordance with the way it is advertised.</li>
      <li>I was also surprised to find it is totally clear.</li>
      <li>My oil arrived &amp; I was surprised to find it had zero smell.</li>
      <li>Once hair is dry can apply little on hair to push down any fly away hairs.</li>
      <li>i highly recommend for natural hair especially locs.</li>
      <li>Based on the instructions that I obtained, this is not for black people&#x27;s daily use because most of us do not wash our hair daily.</li>
      <li>I think this does exactly whats expected of</li>
