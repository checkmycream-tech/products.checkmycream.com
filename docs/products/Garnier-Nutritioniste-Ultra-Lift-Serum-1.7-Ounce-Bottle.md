    <li> I actually thought this was one of the other Garnier wrinkle products. It really doesn&#x27;t seem to have any effect at all. It does smell nice , though</li>
    <li> I actually received this product my mistake...I originally ordered Garnier Nutritioniste Regenerating Serum, and by mistake the seller sent me this...I am impressed with how soft it makes my skin!  My face feels fresh, my skin has a sort of a glow.  This stuff is not oily and doesn&#x27;t leave my skin oily.  I typically get alot of breakouts because of moisturizers leaving my skin so oily, but that isn&#x27;t so with this I like it just as well as the Regenerating Serum, and it helps that it may possibly keep me from getting wrinkles. I haven&#x27;t seen any diminishing lines, but I have only been using it for a week, so who knows.  I have combination skin oily in some spots, really dry in others.  This has left my skin looking and feeling very even!  Garnier products are the only thing that really helps with the evening things out!  I&#x27;m glad I got this, I will continue to use it.</li>
    <li> Tried it from a friend and ordered from Amazon. Excellent product - works well, even in dry climates. Use it day and night for younger looking skin.</li>
    <li> I use this serum under my sunscreen during the day and I really like the fact that it goes on smoothly, provides a good non-sticky base for makeup application, and smells great.  However, I bought this serum to help with laugh lines that are beginning to show up around my mouth area.  I&#x27;m 30-ish so I was quite unhappy when these wrinkles appeared.  Note that these are NOT deep wrinkles - only shallow laugh lines - so I was hoping this serum could help with diminishing their appearance and tightening up the skin a bit.  Didn&#x27;t happen for me, unfortunately.</li>
    <li> Thank you so much for the product I ordered!  It came very quickly and was in perfect condition!  I will definately purchase from you again!  Thank you!</li>
    <li> This product affords a resilience to facial skin.  Used in conjunction with the Ultra Lift Wrinkle Firming Night Cream reflects added benefits.  I am 55 years old and people often remark that my skin looks that of someone in their 30&#x27;s.   I am a very satisfied customer of Garnier Nutrioniste.  Thank you.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed that this product does anything except make my skin break out.  If I use it for more than a couple of days in a row, I get a couple of big zits.  I think wrinkles are preferable.</li>
    <li> Great Product and works like it should have been using it for years now and here on amazon has been the best prices compared to stores..  It really has kept me looking younger..  BTW  use on the back of your hands to tighten your skin there also</li>
    <li> Proven cancer stimulators. Why not choose another Garnier product that doesn&#x27;t have parabens? It seems most of them don&#x27;t have parabens.</li>
    <li> My creams and potions are in heavier jars / bottles, so I went searching on Amazon for good products packaged in lighter weight containers.  I&#x27;ve used Garnier Nutrise hair products and a face cream a few years ago, so decided to give them a try.  Sizes are good for a 2 week trip, weight is lighter, and the products are fine.  I&#x27;m not losing all my fine wrinkles (almost age 71) nor have I noticed any lifting, but my skin is behaving and adequately moisturized. Nothing sticky or oily.</li>
    <li> This used to be a great product, but I either the formula or my skin changed!  I can no longer use Garnier skin-firming products, at all!</li>
    <li> Seems to work ok...just started using it. No iriitation and nice under makeup</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only bought this product once, but it seems as effective as other &amp;#34;Garnier&amp;#34; products WITHOUT the stickiness I associate with some of them. Absorbs quickly and clean with no residual layer. I&#x27;ve only been using such products for a few mos., experimenting mostly with &amp;#34;Garnier&amp;#34;, and with only a couple of exceptions&lt;br /&gt;I like their line, this one is ideal for situations when I really don&#x27;t want my face to feel at all sticky. Bottle has lasted a bit as well, doesn&#x27;t require a whole lot per application, always a consideration when purchasing these type products. (For me anyway!)</li>
    <li> I normally buy okay but they&#x27;re so expensive so I looked for something cheaper. This had good reviews so I decided to rmtry it.  I live how it feels &amp; its super silky soft works great, will buy again!</li>
    <li> Maybe I just need to use it longer but I see no difference in lines/wrinkles after a month.  It goes on fine, feels fine on the face.  Just the results aren&#x27;t there.</li>
    <li> This serum is very soothing to the skin, and does reduce the appearance of wrinkles.&lt;br /&gt;  I use it every day.</li>
    <li> This product seems to be a good moisturiser since it leaves good feeling on the skin, but, as far as wrinkles are concerned, I did not see any changes. The product smells nice, but I received it in a horrible package that looked as if it was used many times. With this in mind, I am doubtful that I would order again from this seller. I would be looking for the same product but from a different seller in the future.</li>
    <li> Arrived fine; as described.</li>
    <li> Of course as usual when something works they discontinue it. I finally found something that doesn&#x27;t make my face look like I burned myself.  No allergic reactions and it works!  I love this stuff and now it is off the mkt and I haven&#x27;t been able to find a replacement.  Why doesn&#x27;t someone make a product for Red heads with really fair skin??  We are allergic to so much and it was so nice to have a product that worked and didnt mess up my skin.</li>
