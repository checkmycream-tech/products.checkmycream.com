    <li> This is an amazing product that I have used since the 60s and it is hard to find.  It really is the best thing for dry skin that there is and I&#x27;ve tried almost everything.  I keep coming back to this.</li>
    <li> I have used Chamberlain&#x27;s Golden Touch lotion since the 60&#x27;s and would hate to have to do without it.  My pharmacist&#x27;s son was in a wheelchair, and Chamberlain&#x27;s cleared up his cracking hands.  It clears up dry skin and makes faded tans look good again.  I love it.  Just wish it was easier to find and buy.</li>
    <li> I have been buying this for years.  Not sure how it works but it is a great moisturizer for body.  Not creamy, more of a liquid, I like the smell.</li>
    <li> I recamended it to my daughter &amp; she bought for herself and her daughter.  It works well on cracked heels</li>
    <li> i have been using this since 3 years and am liking it. Worth buying it. It is helpful in keeping the moisture and can also be used as after shave</li>
    <li> It is OK but not as good as in the past.  Not the same feel, not the same smell, and it looks like some of the ingredients have changed.</li>
    <li> I have loved this lotion for years, but couldn&#x27;t find it. I found it on Amazon, &amp; recommend it to anyone  that has dry, itchy, problem skin. This is an excellent product.</li>
    <li> This is a product that my parents kept on hand.  It has become my go to lotion.  I&#x27;ve tried others but they just cover the dry skin not heal it.  This lotion penetrates, heals, and softens.  It has worked on some very stubborn patches of winter dry skin for me within just days.</li>
    <li> My whole family swears by this stuff and they were raised in the desert. Too bad its so hard to find! All my aunts and uncles live in fear of a discontinuation of this lotion.</li>
    <li> My husband loves this stuff! Not the same smell as the original from years ago, but still really good.</li>
    <li> Best product for my hands.</li>
    <li> This is the best, but it&#x27;s priced pretty high</li>
    <li> I have dry heels that cream or paste lotions do not penetrate enough.  This stuff is watery, so watch out for spilllage. I add tow coats about 5 minutes apart, and then apply a thick creamy lotion.  It works!!</li>
    <li> This product is hard to find but well worth the effort.  It works.It is liquidy rather than a lotion and absorbs well. Great fr problem areas like feet and elbows.</li>
    <li> I am addicted to Chamberlains. It&#x27;s amazing for dry skin and sunburns.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for several years and have not found anything else to compare it to.  It is non oily or greasy and is absorbed into the skin in seconds leaving no residue.  It is perfect for hands, feet, and rough elbows.  I have even used it as an after shave soother on my face.  I would highly recomend this product to anyone with dry skin.</li>

    <li> I used to be able to buy this in some store, but alas, no longer.  I have been using this lotion for over 40 years.  It is the best..not greasy or slippery at all after using.  Soaks right into your skin.</li>
    <li> This lotion has been a part of my family&#x27;s since the 1940s.  It is the best for healing chapped &amp; cracked skin.  Love it!</li>
    <li> Enjoy the Chamberlains!!</li>
    <li> This is the same formula they have made for years. It&#x27;s very helpful in certain situations, as it gives the fingers just a bit of &amp;#34;grip&amp;#34; when the normally dry texture of the skin would &amp;#34;slip&amp;#34;.</li>
