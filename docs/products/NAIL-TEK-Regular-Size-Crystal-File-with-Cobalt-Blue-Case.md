      <li>Nice glass file but the &#x27;supposedly&#x27; protective carrying case is cheap and arrived cracked.</li>
      <li>I have one these files and love it.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m glad they have them now.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s just a cheap piece of plastic that doesn&#x27;t even close up smoothly!</li>

      <li>They are rather pricey, and others reviewers state they break easily.  </li>
      <li>easy to use</li>
      <li>This mothers day gift is a huge hit.</li>
      <li>/&gt;They are easy to clean too--just run the file under a faucet as water will not damage it.</li>
      <li>Also, the file doesn&#x27;t fit snugly inside; it rattles around, consequently</li>
      <li>My nails have never been so smooth from filing alone.    </li>
      <li>smooth..</li>
      <li>Works like a dream and is easy to clean.</li>
      <li>It leaves your nails smooth.</li>
      <li>like I do my cheap reading glasses.  </li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t say enough about how great this file is.</li>
      <li>All are nail files you&#x27;d enjoy using; it&#x27;s just what you&#x27;d prefer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It is smooth, but it&#x27;s also time consuming.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Glass &amp; crystal files are light years beyond metal or emery board files.  </li>
      <li>It is quick and leaves no jagged edges</li>
      <li>Very nice fine file that doesn&#x27;t destroy your nails.</li>
      <li>Of all of the various sizes, I like this long nail file the best.</li>
      <li>what it&#x27;s worth review.\\&quot;</li>
      <li>Nevertheless, the glass nail files are far better in my experience than any emery board or metal file.</li>
      <li>Both are useful.</li>
      <li>The cases, these come with are not very substantial, but I am very glad I bought the files that came with cases.  </li>
      <li>I lost my first one and just missed it</li>
      <li>About the only time I was able to break one was when I was trying to close my console in my vehicle and it would not close.</li>
      <li>The first two didn&#x27;t come in this protective case.</li>
      <li>I broke the first one.  </li>
      <li>I am a satisfied 2nd time buyer.</li>
      <li>love that these nail files, unlike many inexpensive glass/crystal nail files, have nice traction and are rough enough to actually file your nails instead of slip all over the place.</li>
      <li>It gently glides over the tips of my nail and leaves them completely snag-free and smooth.  </li>
      <li>The size, weight and grit are perfect for natural nails, the mini&#x27;s grit feels a little coarser than the regular&#x27;s.  </li>
      <li>But even without the warranty I would certainly buy and repurchased these tools.  </li>
      <li>It was packed in a suitcase on top, which was careless on my part, as I usually make sure it&#x27;s more protected, but I&#x27;m sure it snapped when other luggage was thrown on top.</li>
      <li>Especially for those who get the ebby jeebies from filing their nails this is smooth no scraping feeling.</li>
      <li>They are very durable and shape nails without tearing.  </li>
      <li>Much needed nail file.</li>
      <li>have three of these Nail-Tek Crystal files and really like each one of them.</li>
      <li>I really like this file..........</li>
      <li>which would give it a life span of about 10 years, but I find that it doesn&#x27;t file much on either side, and I&#x27;m convinced that it was meant as a finishing file.</li>
      <li>My actual favorite is the long one with the crystals as it is really fun and bling-y</li>
      <li>The Nail Tek one is okay, but only about half the size of the original one I had.</li>
      <li>so much had to buy a new one.  </li>
      <li>Would recommend highly.</li>
      <li>I was in the market for a new nail file, but didn&#x27;t want a &amp;#34;traditional&amp;#34; emory (sp?)</li>
      <li>I really like the case too, as it is hard and sturdy and will be easy to find in purses and bags, plus keep the file from breaking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>3 inches long, the tip with rounded corners) and the regular (5 inches long, with a rounded pointed tip, lovely for cleaning under nails) crystal files for my natural nails.  </li>
      <li>They are gentle enough though so that your nails won&#x27;t shred or split or peel or flake.</li>
      <li>I really hit it big.</li>
      <li>Also it is nice and thin compared to the last crystal file I had.</li>
      <li>The only reason I give them 4 instead of 5 stars is that the tip is not fine enough to clean under my nails like the old metal files.</li>
      <li>It is nothing short of miraculous for me to buy something a second time when I am so prone to trying new things</li>

    <li> I really hit it big. This mothers day gift is a huge hit. It is still in the pocket book of the wife and is used a lot</li>
    <li> I play classical guitar and bought it to trim my nails for guitar playing. I used to use the metalic revlon file, but was not very happy with it. This one is perfect, does great job, fast and fine.</li>
    <li> *****&lt;br /&gt;I have three of these Nail-Tek Crystal files and really like each one of them. Of all of the various sizes, I like this long nail file the best. I prefer making longer strokes when I file my nails. The long one is 5 inches and the shorter one 3 inches (it&#x27;s called a \\&quot;mini\\&quot; in some places). Both are useful. My actual favorite is the long one with the crystals as it is really fun and bling-y (but it costs more, too). All are nail files you&#x27;d enjoy using; it&#x27;s just what you&#x27;d prefer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love that these nail files, unlike many inexpensive glass/crystal nail files, have nice traction and are rough enough to actually file your nails instead of slip all over the place. They are gentle enough though so that your nails won&#x27;t shred or split or peel or flake. I really like the case too, as it is hard and sturdy and will be easy to find in purses and bags, plus keep the file from breaking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They are easy to clean too--just run the file under a faucet as water will not damage it. It can be sterilized with heat (up to 483F), boiling water, alcohol and UVB lighting. They can even be put in the dishwasher to sterilize it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You just have to be careful not to drop them on a hard surface (like the floor), as they are glass and it could break. I did drop one once on a hardwood floor and it didn&#x27;t break, but I think I was just lucky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They have a Lifetime Replacement Guarantee. Who could ask for more than this?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended.&lt;br /&gt;*****</li>
    <li> This is the second Nail Tek crystal file I have owned.  They are very durable and shape nails without tearing.  The case is perfect for ensuring that the file does not break.</li>
    <li> I have purchased two sizes of the Nail Tek Crystal Files.  The mini (3 inches long, the tip with rounded corners) and the regular (5 inches long, with a rounded pointed tip, lovely for cleaning under nails) crystal files for my natural nails.  These are just marvelous!  The size, weight and grit are perfect for natural nails, the mini&#x27;s grit feels a little coarser than the regular&#x27;s.  They both do a remarkable amount of filing quickly.  My nails have never been so smooth from filing alone.    The cases, these come with are not very substantial, but I am very glad I bought the files that came with cases.  I worked a very small piece of foam into each end of both cases; so, the files do not rattle about and have slight cushioning while in their cases.      I previously used stone files, usually using the \\&quot;Ruby\\&quot; stone and a \\&quot;Hindu\\&quot; stone.  Both were okay, when that was the best that was available.  But they simply do not match the speed, control and finesse of the Nail Tek Crystal files.      They are rather pricey, and others reviewers state they break easily.  They do come with a lifetime warranty.  But even without the warranty I would certainly buy and repurchased these tools.  These are now a \\&quot;must have\\&quot; for me.</li>
    <li> Was a gift for my daughter who lives in London and is an actor - including a hand model.  She has tons of nail files, but raved about this one.</li>
    <li> It takes about twice as long to file my nails (I&#x27;ve never used a clipper) than when I used my wife&#x27;s Diamond Deb. I suppose that this will last 5 times longer ... which would give it a life span of about 10 years, but I find that it doesn&#x27;t file much on either side, and I&#x27;m convinced that it was meant as a finishing file. In other words, there&#x27;s no \\&quot;rasp\\&quot; for shaping. Further, the point is extremely sharp, It could actually be used as a weapon. It&#x27;s even designed with tapering on both sides, and I assume that&#x27;s for cuticles. I advise against using it in a car (as a passenger).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m no expert even though I&#x27;ve been using rasps and files for the better part of 4o years. It&#x27;s better than an emery board, not as good as the diamond deb metal. It is smooth, but it&#x27;s also time consuming.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, this is another \\&quot;for what it&#x27;s worth review.\\&quot;</li>
    <li> I had purchased a similar nail file a few years back at a presentation and have used nothing else since, but it recently broke when I was traveling and I hoped to replace it with the Nail Tek &amp;#34;regular size&amp;#34; one. The Nail Tek one is okay, but only about half the size of the original one I had. It was difficult to tell the actual size from the descriptions. I do like that it has a case, which is why I purchased it, as that will protect it from breaking as my previous one did. It was packed in a suitcase on top, which was careless on my part, as I usually make sure it&#x27;s more protected, but I&#x27;m sure it snapped when other luggage was thrown on top. Nevertheless, the glass nail files are far better in my experience than any emery board or metal file. I still use the broken one as it&#x27;s only snapped in half.</li>
    <li> I really like this file..........I lost my first one and just missed it so much had to buy a new one.  I know that I will come across it one of these days but just couldn&#x27;t wait.</li>
    <li> Nice glass file but the &#x27;supposedly&#x27; protective carrying case is cheap and arrived cracked. Also, the file doesn&#x27;t fit snugly inside; it rattles around, consequently, I do not carry it in my purse.</li>
    <li> I have one these files and love it. The case is a \\&quot;must have\\&quot; as it protects the file from being broken. The file isn&#x27;t fragile, but it is glass. I bought a replacement file for a girlfriend whose file broke in her purse, and another for my daughter-in-law, which unfortunately arrived broken. Even though I bought the one with the case for my daughter-in-law, the file doesn&#x27;t ship inside the case (Doh!).   The issue I have is with the seller. I bought one of these as a gift and the item shipped was a different style and arrived broken. Seller (Nail Beauty 4U) has refused to ship out a replacement.</li>
    <li> I keep these around the house like I do my cheap reading glasses.  They work well on my super thin nails.  The only reason I give them 4 instead of 5 stars is that the tip is not fine enough to clean under my nails like the old metal files.</li>
    <li> I was in the market for a new nail file, but didn&#x27;t want a &amp;#34;traditional&amp;#34; emory (sp?) board because they tend to leave my nail tips shredded (I have soft, weak nails.)  This file is perfect!  It gently glides over the tips of my nail and leaves them completely snag-free and smooth.  If you get a glass/crystal file, be sure to get one with a case -- and USE the case!  If you just throw things in the bottom of your purse (like I usually do), it&#x27;s likely to snap in half unless protected by the case.</li>
    <li> I have used these files for years but then suddenly the place I got them did not carry them any longer. I was thrilled to see that I could get them on Amazon! They are the strongest files I have ever used. About the only time I was able to break one was when I was trying to close my console in my vehicle and it would not close. I kept slamming over &amp; over and finally it closed and that is when the file broke. That was a ton of pressure to put it through before it broke.</li>
    <li> Works like a dream and is easy to clean. Has not dulled after several uses. I am very happy with this file. Also it is nice and thin compared to the last crystal file I had.</li>
    <li> This is my third file. The first two didn&#x27;t come in this protective case. I&#x27;m glad they have them now. Once you&#x27;ve used this nail file you&#x27;ll never go back to the sandpaper ones again. Its hard to explain but it&#x27;s the best. Especially for those who get the ebby jeebies from filing their nails this is smooth no scraping feeling. It leaves your nails smooth. I can&#x27;t say enough about how great this file is.</li>
    <li> It is nothing short of miraculous for me to buy something a second time when I am so prone to trying new things but I don&#x27;t want to mess with a  winner.  I broke the first one.  Yep they break when you sit on them; after all, they are glass.  But this is just about the best nail file ever. It is quick and leaves no jagged edges and you can wash it or sterilize it.  Perfect.</li>
    <li> The file itself is wonderful!  The Cobalt Blue Case is not at all what it looks like in the picture.  It&#x27;s just a cheap piece of plastic that doesn&#x27;t even close up smoothly!</li>
    <li> I play classical and need to keep my nails in playing shape. I bought one and it was perfect. I bought another for another guitar case and it had extra pink and girly stuff glued to the top...bedazzled? I used gue gone and scraped that stuff off. The case is nice and one of the reasons I purchased them.  Otherwise they work as well as the glass files from GSI guitar salon international.</li>
    <li> They LAST FOREVER (unless u drop it &#x3D;/ )  Bought one for all the ladies in my life.  they all LOVE it.</li>
    <li> Glass &amp; crystal files are light years beyond metal or emery board files.  They have the perfect amount of abrasiveness and the result is a perfectly smooth surface on your nail.  A nice protective case tops it all off.</li>
    <li> Best file....smooth..easy to use..beats standard emory boards. Already had the mini file; ordered this for me and another for a friend.</li>
    <li> Everyone was satisfied with the crystal nail files.</li>
    <li> Very nice fine file that doesn&#x27;t destroy your nails. Comes in a very attractive case.  Would recommend highly. Did have a problem removing the glue from the case that attached it to the packaging.  It required quite a bit of elbow grease to remove.  At one point I thought the case was ruined because the glue started smearing and was difficult to remove. I used some dish detergent to help degrease. If it wasn&#x27;t for this incident. I would have given a 5 star rating.</li>
    <li> Much needed nail file. Nail Tek makes the best. Delivery was punctual.</li>
    <li> Excellent! And the case is wonderful!</li>
    <li> Love this file!  It is the onlyone that really works with my thin, peeling nails.  I had one for nearly ten years and recently broke it.  Was so glad to be able to find another!</li>
    <li> Excellent nail file!  Love the file and the case is great!</li>
    <li> Elegant, beautiful, works well and seems to be durable. Pricey though.</li>
    <li> Best crystal nail file out there</li>
    <li> I have used these for years and they last a long time. The last one lasted for 7 years and this one has a prettier case!</li>
    <li> Nail tek makes the best nail files.  The grain is very fine and it doesnt matter which way you file.  I brought it on a beach vaca with the family and all the ladies stole it from me to use it.  Guess I better buy some more for christmas presents this year!</li>
    <li> Shipping was fast an product arrived in good condition.  This is a good quality product.  You can use both sides, whereas some others have only one useable side for filing. I am a satisfied 2nd time buyer.</li>
    <li> Prompt delivery.  Nice product.</li>
