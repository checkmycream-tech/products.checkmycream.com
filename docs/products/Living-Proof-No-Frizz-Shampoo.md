<ol>
      <li>Works incredibly well on summertime frizz!</li>
      <li>And it smells good too!!!</li>
      <li>So I tried the Perfect Hair Day formula instead</li>
      <li>, I style my hair and it stays perfect for 3 days.</li>
      <li>The best part is that I can&#x27;t feel any product in my hair at all, so it&#x27;s perfect for even baby fine hair.  </li>
      <li>but now my hair looks great all day.  </li>
      <li>great shampoo.</li>
      <li>The smell isn&#x27;t great, but its not a deal breaker.</li>
      <li>I am amazed--it works great.</li>
      <li>Great hair care line.  </li>
      <li>All are great.</li>
      <li>This is a great shampoo.</li>
      <li>I think this product would be great for someone with oily hair or who is trying to get volume.</li>
      <li>Perfect Hair Day is a perfect fit for me.  </li>
      <li>I love this product!!  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s completely amazing!</li>

      <li>Good price.</li>
      <li>Even my sister who has frizzy hair asked where to get it as she loved the shampoo and CONDITIONER too.</li>
      <li>good shampoo, but nothing miraculous.</li>
      <li>I thought I loved it</li>
      <li>This is exceptionally good shampoo-</li>
      <li>smells great and feels so clean!!</li>
      <li>My hair is color treated so the fact that this shampoo is sulfate free is a very good thing for me.  </li>
      <li>and I could tell, within the first couple of shampoos, that this was the perfect formula for me.  </li>
      <li>I love this product!</li>
      <li>Love this product!</li>
      <li>Love this shampoo!</li>
      <li>I have fine, frizzy hair, especially on top, and this shampoo and conditioner work better than any others that I&#x27;ve bought over many years.</li>
      <li>The shine is amazing too.</li>
      <li>and he&#x27;s some kind of genius.</li>
      <li>While I do love the shampoo and conditioner and think the line works best when you use all the steps, I will say that it&#x27;s more important to invest in the Leave-In Conditioner, Nourishing Styling Creme, No Frizz Spray, and the Prime Style Extender.</li>
      <li>My hair is now effortless and holds a nice shiny curl.  </li>
      <li>So nice to know Amazon.com is carrying the brand now.  </li>
      <li>Great product and delivered right on time.</li>
      <li>My hair looked great the first time I used this.  </li>
      <li>and I don&#x27;t see many reviews for anti frizz products for girls with FINE hair!  </li>
      <li>Love the way it makes my hair feel.  </li>
      <li>I wanted to try something sulfate-free and that is mostly what I was banking on, but either way the results are nonexistent.</li>
      <li>My favorite shampoo.  </li>
      <li>This line is magic, though!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>/&gt;After two uses, I love this shampoo and conditioner.</li>
      <li>The shampoo is ok.</li>
      <li>I purchased the product from a salon that is reputable and swears by this brand.</li>
      <li>Freida&#x27;s frizz ease products work better on my hair.&lt;br /&gt;What</li>
      <li>I would love to get the conditioner as well.</li>
      <li>I absolutely love this shampoo.  </li>
      <li>This is even better than Hemp.  </li>
      <li>And the wave is more pronounced.  </li>
      <li>and I do love it.  </li>
      <li>Well I&#x27;m still glad I didn&#x27;t, because this stuff just doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s definitely better than anything else I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
      <li>Bought the sample of No Frizz by Living Proof and after one use am so glad I did.</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t tell the difference between this and most shampoos that are sold in drugstores and grocery stores.  </li>
      <li>I do use the No Frizz Weightless Styling Spray and really love it.  </li>
      <li>bothers me most, however, is the packaging.</li>
      <li>What more can you ask?  </li>
      <li>I am 51 years old, and I have never used a shampoo that was this good!</li>
      <li>I have hair that always has frizzed easily, even more so since it turned gray (haircolor notwithstanding).</li>
      <li>I love it and it also smell clean fresh too!!</li>
      <li>, it spills easily.</li>
      <li>The products came very quickly.  </li>
      <li>I have shoulder length fine straight-ish hair - think Cate Blanchett hair -  </li>
      <li>The tops stay on fine and I like the design.  </li>
      <li>I have curly frizzy yet fine hair</li>
      <li>and it has made a huge difference, along with the hairspray.  </li>
      <li>This stuff is fantastic.  </li>
      <li>When I received what was offered as a 30 day free trial, I saw that &amp;#34;free&amp;#34; meant that the company would charge my credit card $189.00 in two month implements for allowing me the trial use of the product.</li>
      <li>Makes the great cut I got finally gets its break without the frizz and fluffiness muddling it up.</li>
      <li>While it does have a nice scent, it did absolutely nothing for my hair.  </li>
      <li>But they actually did a great job, even in the Florida humidity</li>
      <li>It leaves your hair soft and full with a pleasant muted fragrance.    </li>
      <li>PHD is a fantastic formula and the two styling products I use help give me a great hair day every single day.  </li>
      <li>It is definitely worth the money!</li>
      <li>None of the above has been my experience with Living Proof, recommended to me by a friend who had a friend that  had successful results with LP.</li>
      <li>This is the only product that has calmed my frizzies and added super shine to my out-of-control hair - I love it!!</li>
      <li>It is a great choice for a person with kinky hair or overly curly or dry.</li>
      <li>As someone with coarse, colored hair for whom shiny and smooth hair is the holy grail--I was lured in by a press release I read about Jennifer Aniston, who is known for her gorgeous hair, buying into the company.</li>
      <li>I love it so much, that I&#x27;m buying the 24 oz size.  </li>
      <li>You need to use the shampoo, conditioner and styling cream to realize the full benefits.  </li>
      <li>I have my hair done at good salons and regularly use high-end products (Kerastase, Rene Furterer, Bumble and Bumble, Crema,  etc.)</li>
      <li>I really love this whole series.</li>
      <li>is since the tab is not highlighted or raised, and if you drop the top-heavy full bottle in the shower (as I did)</li>
      <li>Been looking for the trifecta of Living Proof shampoo / conditioner / styling creme for years and years, spent so much money on so many products that don&#x27;t work or kind of work but never been satisfied.</li>
      <li>sometimes I think it is great and other times</li>
      <li>quick shipment</li>
      <li>I love this line of product and highly recommend</li>
      <li>The No Frizz formula is more for normal to oily hair</li>
      <li>For this reason, and the fact that I live in Texas, my hair is a nightmare most days out of the year.</li>
      <li>It hydrates my hair really well and leaves it just as frizz free as the No Frizz formula.  </li>
      <li>My hair was really sleek and smooth, but the dryness made it way too &amp;#34;fluffy&amp;#34;.  </li>
      <li>Love the shampoo, no harsh chemicals.</li>
      <li>I think it isn&#x27;t worth it.  </li>
      <li>So far I am pleased.</li>
      <li>definitely worth a try</li>
      <li>I am not feeling the value is right.</li>
      <li>I am a Caucasian female with lots of fine, chemically straightened hair, damaged by years of too much heat and too many chemicals.  </li>
      <li>thats left in hair) and makes your hair much more manageable .</li>
      <li>Does exactly what it says.</li>
      <li>I thought I&#x27;d give the shampoo and conditioner a try, but I made sure to only buy the smallest bottles because I didn&#x27;t want to shell out $50 for a product I was taking a chance on.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I wasn&#x27;t expecting this shampoo (along with the No Frizz conditioner) to actually control my resistant frizziness.  But they actually did a great job, even in the Florida humidity (we&#x27;re in the middle of a spring heat wave, not a good time for hair, lol!).  My hair is color treated so the fact that this shampoo is sulfate free is a very good thing for me.  The last thing I want is to watch my precious color go down the drain, frizz or no frizz!  I used this shampoo (and the No Frizz conditioner) for the recommended two weeks.  And while my frizz was most definitely controlled, they left my hair dry, which didn&#x27;t make for easy styling.  My hair is already dry from coloring and heated styling so I don&#x27;t need something that will exacerbate that issue.  My hair was really sleek and smooth, but the dryness made it way too &amp;#34;fluffy&amp;#34;.  There&#x27;s just not enough moisture in the LP formula for my needs.  So I tried the Perfect Hair Day formula instead and I could tell, within the first couple of shampoos, that this was the perfect formula for me.  It hydrates my hair really well and leaves it just as frizz free as the No Frizz formula.  It&#x27;s soft and supple and shiny.  What more can you ask?  The No Frizz formula is more for normal to oily hair I think.  And while it did keep my hair clean for a longer period of time than my previous s/c, it left my hair feeling a bit frazzled.  Perfect Hair Day is a perfect fit for me.  I do use the No Frizz Weightless Styling Spray and really love it.  It also controls every last bit of frizz and it holds my hair all day.  The best part is that I can&#x27;t feel any product in my hair at all, so it&#x27;s perfect for even baby fine hair.  I also use the Prime Style Extender, roots to ends, which increases the effectiveness of styling products and helps my style last into the 2nd day (and sometimes beyond that).  If you can&#x27;t tell already, I&#x27;m a Living Proof convert.  PHD is a fantastic formula and the two styling products I use help give me a great hair day every single day.  Don&#x27;t get me wrong, I think the No Frizz formula is magical, it&#x27;s just too drying for me.  But for those with normal to oily or really fine hair, it would be a godsend, especially because they wouldn&#x27;t have to shampoo as often.  I definitely recommend this formula for those people who don&#x27;t have any dryness but have a problem with frizz.  It works!reat hair day every single day.

    <li> I love this product!!  I have been looking for something to replace Alterna Hemp Straight, since it went out of production and tried several expensive alternatives.  This is even better than Hemp.  It fights the frizz, but doesn&#x27;t feel heavy or greasy.  You need to use the shampoo, conditioner and styling cream to realize the full benefits.  It is definitely worth the money!</li>
    <li> This is a great shampoo. Love the way it makes my hair feel.  I also purchased the conditioner and the leave-in conditioner.  All are great.</li>
    <li> I am disappointed in this product.  It does not meet my expectations nor does it perform any better than much less expensive shampoos and conditioners.  My hair is very frizzy with the least bit of humidity and I had expected these products to at least reduce the amount of frizz.  I see no difference after several weeks of use.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t tell the difference between this and most shampoos that are sold in drugstores and grocery stores.  It was no help taming my fine but thick hair.</li>
    <li> Buy this shampoo! I live in Texas where the weather is dry and this seemed to help the feeling of dry hair go moisturize. I have thick highlighted blonde hair so as you can noticed having those two combinations it is hard to find a shampoo and conditioner that works. Feeling my after one use there is a big difference. The shine is amazing too. I did let the conditioner sit in my hair for about 10 mins to deeply nourish the hair because my hair was very dry from not using the right products and using heating tools with that. Go out and buy it!! I love it and it also smell clean fresh too!! Two thumbs after only one use!</li>
    <li> So I admit I do not have typical \\&quot;problem hair.\\&quot; I have hair that is slightly wavy and fine-stranded (just a lot of it). I recently moved to Minnesota where the weather is so dry (having come from Chicago, it&#x27;s been a big adjustment). My normally well-behaved hair was often frizzy with flyaways and looked like a hot mess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After two uses, I love this shampoo and conditioner. It really does smooth down my hair and despite some pretty humid days, stays flat, soft, and touchable. My boyfriend also remarked that my hair is not frizzy like it used to be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note that I do not have curly hair, so I can&#x27;t testify that this works for curly haired girls (whether naturally so or permed). I have fine hair that is wavy to straight (depending on the moisture in the air) with an oily scalp, so the fact that this shampoo smooths without oils is a big plus for me. I can actually get my scalp clean. I tried Loreal&#x27;s sulfate-free shampoo, and it left my hair and scalp an oily, icky mess. The result was totally different with this shampoo/conditioner combo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had bought the trial package, so I also tried the cream to straighten hair. This kept my wavy hair straight. I have used the cream for curls on curled hair to tame the frizz, and it worked well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not a miracle worker for the most troublesome of hair, but if you have slightly annoying frizz for mostly straight hair, want a good shampoo to clean and not strip your scalp, this does the job. Yes, it is expensive, but so is the Bumble and Bumble conditioner I use, and this conditioner smooths better than that.</li>
    <li> What this product does well is block humidity. I have thick wavy/curly hair and normally when I straighten it, it will curl or frizz back up in a matter of hours. With this product line, I don&#x27;t have to worry about my hair getting to big again after I go to all the work of straightening it. It&#x27;s definitely better than anything else I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
    <li> This stuff is fantastic.  My sister bought this for me as a gift, when I complained that my expensive salon shampoo &amp; conditoner felt like they wouldn&#x27;t rinse out any more.  My hair looked great the first time I used this.  And my hair looked better and better as I continued to use it!!!  I love it so much, that I&#x27;m buying the 24 oz size.  I have fine-medium hair, and I use this and the no frizz conditioner.  I like to blow dry &amp; flat iron my hair, and this product rinses out well, and doesn&#x27;t leave any residue.  Buy the straight styling cream too for hair that&#x27;s got that salon look and that baby feel.  And it smells good too!!!</li>
    <li> I love this product! It takes away the frizz and doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down at all - and my hair is very fine.</li>
    <li> The products came very quickly.  I cannot decide how much it works for me.  sometimes I think it is great and other times I think it isn&#x27;t worth it.  Maybe I am doing something wrong.</li>
    <li> Works incredibly well on summertime frizz!</li>
    <li> This is exceptionally good shampoo- the guy who invented it was on Nova and he&#x27;s some kind of genius. It leaves your hair soft and full with a pleasant muted fragrance.    But I dinged it one star for the awful packaging. You can&#x27;t tell where to open the top is since the tab is not highlighted or raised, and if you drop the top-heavy full bottle in the shower (as I did) the entire cap will pop off and the expensive buff-colored shampoo will pour out the large opening before you know what happened.     Such a stupid oversight to make this fine product user-unfriendly by spoiling it with trendy impractical packaging esthetics. And it&#x27;s not as though you can transfer the contents to a an easier dispenser either- you&#x27;re stuck fighting with that damn awkward opening every shampoo!</li>
    <li> This product makes a real difference with my hair. Expensive, but through Amazon much more reasonable and affordable to use on a regular basis... my hair is soft, curls with no frizz.</li>
    <li> this product left my hair dry, even after using a leave in it was still dry. I have curly frizzy yet fine hair and i am always looking for something to reduce the frizz and yet still keep it moisturized. This product did not make the cut. I didnt even notice a reduction in frizz. .... Also it was very expensive, it is not concentrated and the bottles are much smaller than the usual shampoo bottle size. .... I think this product would be great for someone with oily hair or who is trying to get volume.</li>
    <li> I started with the no frizz styling cream for coarse hair.  I didn&#x27;t try the no frizz shampoo and conditioner until recently and it has made a huge difference, along with the hairspray.  My hair is now effortless and holds a nice shiny curl.  I used to give up on my hair and just put it in a ponytail on rainy days because of the frizz but now my hair looks great all day.  I&#x27;ve been getting constant compliments.  I highly recommend these products.</li>
    <li> great shampoo. quick shipment</li>
    <li> Truly no frizz! It foams a bit too much for my curls, so if I use it all the time, my hair starts to misbehave. It doesn&#x27;t frizz, but it becomes difficult. I love this line of product and highly recommend</li>
    <li> I purchased the Frizz Free shampoo and conditioner, the styling spray, the restore, tried them a few times and I felt it was not worth my hard earned money. I don&#x27;t know what I was expecting. My general feeling was I couldn&#x27;t wait to use them up. They are right, the caps are so hard to open and the shampoo and conditioner did seem to last forever. I finally put them out of my misery and stored them away for times when I run out of shampoo or conditioner. I would not discourage anyone from trying these products, but I would comment it&#x27;s a commited relationship.</li>
    <li> Love the shampoo, no harsh chemicals. smells great and feels so clean!! A little pricey but definitely worth it!</li>
    <li> I bought this shampoo and the anti frizz conditioner in a store, so I am not verified for this review.  However, I have decided to leave a review because I think so highly of this shampoo and conditioner and I don&#x27;t see many reviews for anti frizz products for girls with FINE hair!  I have shoulder length fine straight-ish hair - think Cate Blanchett hair -  but in humid weather it develops a curl at the ends and goes a bit frizzy.  I&#x27;ve tried other anti frizz shampoo/conditioners but they always weigh my hair down and after a day or so looks oily or waxy.  I used a US quarter size amount of this shampoo and conditioner and I cannot tell you enough how it transformed my hair - shiny, sleek and baby soft.  I washed it on a rainy day, so putting it to the test. However, I don&#x27;t live in a humid area. I usually wash my hair every couple of days and after 3 days my hair still felt clean, soft and sleek.  Before I tried this shampoo/conditioner I thought I would have to buy a styling cream to make it even smoother, but just using these two products seems to do the trick.  Another reviewer mentioned having trouble with the tops of the bottles - I haven&#x27;t had the same problem.  The tops stay on fine and I like the design.  With some other tops, you break your nails trying to open the product!  Expensive but definitely worth a try if you break it down to per shampoo/conditioner use.  I&#x27;m now a fan of this brand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: I recently took a trip to the east coast of South Africa where 95 percent humidity is common.  If I had to rate the shampoo and conditioner from that experience, I would give it three stars.  My hair wasn&#x27;t frizzy but definitely curled into ringlets.  Perhaps a smoothing product in addition to the shampoo and conditioner would have helped. Actually perhaps only a brazilian blow out would have been effective in that humidity!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this shampoo.  My hair is so soft and manageable after using.  I would love to get the conditioner as well.</li>
    <li> Got this for my daughter.  She says it&#x27;s better than regular shampoos.</li>
    <li> I would rate this even lower than a one star if possible.  they have no business to put the words &amp;#34;no frizz&#x27; on their product</li>
    <li> Stay far far away from this product and the others in the no frizz line.  The smell is horrendous and after using it for 3 days it began burning my scalp and eyes while giving me a massive headache. After washing several times with clarifying shampoo the symptoms subsided, but now my scalp is flaking and still a little sore and itchy. I emailed the company asking for a refund, and I have never heard back from them. I have used probably hundreds of products in my hair and I have never had an experience like this.</li>
    <li> This is great shampoo for dry, frizzy hair,  especially when used with the conditioner. The smell isn&#x27;t great, but its not a deal breaker.</li>
    <li> I have been using Living Proof No Frizz Shampoo and conditioner for about a year. I thought I loved it but now I am not sure that it is not this shampoo that is making my hair dry. It does have alchohol in it.  I have very thick hair that is prone to frizzing and this shampoo has not helped a bit. I purchased the product from a salon that is reputable and swears by this brand. I am going back to my old, more natural brands  without alcohol and see if this makes a difference.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d like to start by saying that my hair is especially prone to frizz--more so than others--because it is very fine and therefore not heavy enough to outweigh moisture, and it is also very curly/wavy when it dries naturally. For this reason, and the fact that I live in Texas, my hair is a nightmare most days out of the year. I&#x27;d straighten my hair in the morning, use tons of Biosilk and Alterna serum, and within 5 minutes of being outdoors, my hair was ruined for the day. I literally used to wrap my head in a silk scarf 1950s-style just to battle frizz from my car to the office.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My life has changed completely since I started using the NoFrizz products. While I do love the shampoo and conditioner and think the line works best when you use all the steps, I will say that it&#x27;s more important to invest in the Leave-In Conditioner, Nourishing Styling Creme, No Frizz Spray, and the Prime Style Extender. That way, you can get away with using any shampoo and conditioner of your choice (I still stick with a sulfate-free shampoo and use high-end products). Honestly, if you only have money for either the shampoo and conditioner or the styling products, you might not get the same result from just washing your hair, so I&#x27;d lean towards the styling products rather than the shampoo and conditioner. This line is magic, though!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, I style my hair and it stays perfect for 3 days. I no longer have to cover my head to fight frizz, and my hair doesn&#x27;t get fluffy or kink up when I go outside. It stays smooth, soft, straight and shiny. It&#x27;s completely amazing! I use Klorane dry shampoo in between washing my hair so I don&#x27;t have to style too often and damage my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend the No Frizz products to anyone who has battled frizz all their lives. It is on the pricier side, but it&#x27;s not that much more expensive than regular high-end products, and it *really* does the job! Try it, you will NOT be disappointed!</li>
    <li> This wasn&#x27;t for me. While lathering my hair felt crunchy. Used the conditioner too and it all left my fine, prone to greasy hair too dried out and frizzy.</li>
    <li> Great product and delivered right on time.</li>
    <li> Great hair care line.  It does stop the frizz and makes your hair thick and luxurious. So nice to know Amazon.com is carrying the brand now.  Why shop anywhere else?</li>
    <li> Not so crazy about this shampoo.  It just doesn&#x27;t work to keep the frizz out in this Texas heat!</li>
    <li> Love this shampoo! Keeps hair soft and manageable for a few days! Even my sister who has frizzy hair asked where to get it as she loved the shampoo and CONDITIONER too.</li>
    <li> I use the conditioner (and the leave in conditioner when I can get it) as well. I really love this whole series. The shampoo still lathers very well even though it doesn&#x27;t have any SLS, and I don&#x27;t break out like I do with some of the &amp;#34;natural shampoos&amp;#34;. It leaves my hair soft.</li>
    <li> My hair is very damaged and is frizzy ALL the time. I thought I&#x27;d give the shampoo and conditioner a try, but I made sure to only buy the smallest bottles because I didn&#x27;t want to shell out $50 for a product I was taking a chance on. Well I&#x27;m still glad I didn&#x27;t, because this stuff just doesn&#x27;t work. My hair continues to frizz as it starts to dry, and like I said it doesn&#x27;t matter what the weather is like. I just have bad hair, and this product is not revolutionary or special in any way. I wanted to try something sulfate-free and that is mostly what I was banking on, but either way the results are nonexistent. I suppose I&#x27;ll have to try fixing my hair with natural ingredients and do a home recipe or something, because I&#x27;m sick of being disappointed by all these fancy, overpriced products on the market.</li>
    <li> The shampoo is ok. My hair is still frizzy when I use it.&lt;br /&gt;John Freida&#x27;s frizz ease products work better on my hair.&lt;br /&gt;What bothers me most, however, is the packaging. The cap&lt;br /&gt;is very hard to open in the shower and if you don&#x27;t cap it up&lt;br /&gt;perfectly, it spills easily. After the bottle tipped in the shower&lt;br /&gt;and spilled the entire contents of a new bottle very quickly,&lt;br /&gt;I decided to stop buying this product.</li>
    <li> I am 51 years old, and I have never used a shampoo that was this good! I have hair that always has frizzed easily, even more so since it turned gray (haircolor notwithstanding). After using this shampoo, I have no frizz at all. I almost look as if I had a chemical process to remove frizz, yet my hair does not look flat or greasy. This product is a real winner!</li>
    <li> I have fine, frizzy hair, especially on top, and this shampoo and conditioner work better than any others that I&#x27;ve bought over many years. They also last a very long time and have no sulfates.  I have both wavy and curly hair and I can go longer without washing also, which is helpful as I color my hair. I knocked off a star however because of the terrible tops which constantly pop off.  I see another user said the same thing. Most of the time the bottles sit in my shower without them because putting them back on is not easy.  They look messy and I have to be careful not to spill the contents.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not paying for this product again because of the price... If it was a miracle worker then I&#x27;d reconsider but it&#x27;s not and so I&#x27;m done..</li>
    <li> Makes my air feel dry.</li>
    <li> What a huge disappointment both the Living Proof shampoo AND conditioner turned out to be. As someone with coarse, colored hair for whom shiny and smooth hair is the holy grail--I was lured in by a press release I read about Jennifer Aniston, who is known for her gorgeous hair, buying into the company. The story stated, \\&quot;The brand hopes the one-two punch of celebrity and science -- the products are based on MIT research -- can help to crack a crowded field.\\&quot; Well, I have to tell you while all of the MIT research SOUNDED impressive, these expensive products not only didn&#x27;t do what the description stated, my hair lost ALL shine and looked as if it were \\&quot;day-three\\&quot; hair. It was an enormous disappointment. I do see some variation in the reviews and absolutely need to side with the ones that had issues with the product(s), as I would not buy a product from this range again especially at a price this high. The quest in that \\&quot;crowded field\\&quot; Aniston and her colleagues are seeking to \\&quot;crack\\&quot; continues!  : - (</li>
    <li> I really like Living proofshampoo w/no frizz. Sometimes there is tail tell end of perm in your hair this shampoo actually helped that, at least it did for me. I have tried Living proofs other products (conditioner  thats left in hair) and makes your hair much more manageable . So far I give thumbs up for the Brand.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for a while and I do love it.  I thought I would go online and see if I could get it for a little cheaper.  Um....  I buy this shampoo for 23$ at Ulta.  Not sure why some would buy from amazon at 29.  Even some of the other amazon affiliates were 21$ with 7$ shipping.  Doesn&#x27;t make sense to me.  Especially now that Amazon charges tax.  Just a thought!!</li>
    <li> My favorite shampoo.  Leaves hair smooth and shiny and doesn&#x27;t weigh it down.  Good price.</li>
    <li> Love this product! I hope they never stop making it!!</li>
    <li> Just tried this shampoo  on my very frizzy hair, after returning from a vacation where it really got out of hand with swimming in the ocean and sunning.I had ordered a sample packet that was waiting for me upon my return.  I am amazed--it works great. I have tried every shampoo imaginable but this one is the only one I have tried that makes a difference. My hair is soft, shiny and has a nice curl to it--it hasn&#x27;t behaved this well in a long, long time.</li>
    <li> Does exactly what it says. Great!!!&lt;br /&gt;I am blown away. Been looking for the trifecta of Living Proof shampoo / conditioner / styling creme for years and years, spent so much money on so many products that don&#x27;t work or kind of work but never been satisfied. Bought the sample of No Frizz by Living Proof and after one use am so glad I did. Got a compliment on my hair for the first time in forever. Makes the great cut I got finally gets its break without the frizz and fluffiness muddling it up. Thank you!!!</li>
    <li> My stylist introduced me to this product. Then he quit carrying it because it was available other places. It is a great choice for a person with kinky hair or overly curly or dry. Seems to correct a miriad of problems</li>
    <li> Based on my horrible experience with the No Frizz shampoo, conditioner and styling cream, I’m calling out the glowing reviews of Living Prof as shams.  Some background first:  I am a Caucasian female with lots of fine, chemically straightened hair, damaged by years of too much heat and too many chemicals.  I have my hair done at good salons and regularly use high-end products (Kerastase, Rene Furterer, Bumble and Bumble, Crema,  etc.) and a few low-end products that perform above average (E.g., Tres Semme heat protectant).  I have also tried the infomercial products (e.g., Coolway Transform, Ovation, Wen).  Before Living Proof No Frizz, Wen was the biggest fail:  While it made my hair soft, it also made it fall out in large masses.  Put simply though, I will take shiny soft hair that falls out over the dry, unruly, frizzy mess Living Proof No Frizz produced.  This is supposed to be a no-frizz line, but my hair is literally frizzier than it has ever been, and this includes the time I had my bags stolen at JFK in the middle of summer and had to use hotel products on my hair and style with a hotel blow-dryer with no flat iron, then go out in the high humidity.  That was bad – this is WORSE!! In addition to being frizzy, my hair is dry, which makes it poufy.  And it looks filthy.  And the wave is more pronounced.  My hair is literally defying my Sedu Revolution flat iron. Finally, although I can’t swear to it, it looks to me like the products stripped my demi-permanent hair color.  It has been three weeks since I had my hair colored, then treated separately with Sebastian Cellophanes.  My hair was still dark and shiny.  After two uses of the no-frizz line (shampoo, conditioner, and styling lotion), my hair looks noticeably lighter, with no shine.  Seriously – this product is so bad I don’t have a clue how Jennifer Aniston – or anyone who cares about a reputation -- lends her name to it.  I was ready to ditch it after the first use, but thought that perhaps I used too much of the styling product (instructions say to use liberally), so I cut way back the second time – same results though.  BEWARE.  If you are still tempted to give Living Proof a try, buy where you can return it.  I am taking it back tomorrow.  Those of you who say it works – I am calling you out as fakes!!!!!  I will post this everywhere I can, to give us ladies a heads up!used too much of the styling product (instructions say to use liberally), so I cut way back the second time – same results though.

    <li> I just received my sample travel packet and used it for the first time this morning. So far I am pleased. But the purpose of this review is to recommend this product for trial rather than some others that are offered online. I had a bad experience from another product with a familiar name in this field. When I received what was offered as a 30 day free trial, I saw that &amp;#34;free&amp;#34; meant that the company would charge my credit card $189.00 in two month implements for allowing me the trial use of the product. Before the package arrived in the mail I received an extremely high powered sales pitch over the phone. When I told the caller I was not interested in anything beyond what I had requested, I was then turned over to a male salesman who talked over me, refused to listen to my comments and insisted that I could not cancel my order.  The order arrived 3 days later, I called to let them know I was returning it and would not be responsible for any further payments. With that I was literally assaulted for being cheap, wanting something for free, referenced my type of person who shops only at a big box store, refused to get my questions answered for properly returning the package. After 20 minutes of rudeness, I finally received the return package number. None of the above has been my experience with Living Proof, recommended to me by a friend who had a friend that  had successful results with LP. I am looking forward to the same. Thank you for your trust and honesty in your advertising.  People can trust your company. I am sure I will be ordering from you on a regular basis.</li>
    <li> good shampoo, but nothing miraculous. Very small packaging for the price &#x3D; I am not feeling the value is right.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m using it and other Living Proof No Frizz products.</li>
    <li> Wife changed products....</li>
    <li> This is the only product that has calmed my frizzies and added super shine to my out-of-control hair - I love it!!</li>
    <li> I tried the No Frizz shampoo, conditioner and styling products from their travel pack for a month now and see no difference in my hair.  I have to say I am extremely disappointed with the product.  While it does have a nice scent, it did absolutely nothing for my hair.  The products are expensive and I have tried many other products for my hair that are a fraction of the cost and they work better than this. At least now I will not waste my money on this horrible product.</li>
    <li> I was hopeful about the MIT technology and who doesn&#x27;t want hair like Jennifer Aniston but my hair is still just as frizzy as ever. It even feels drier than when I use my usual Pureology. I&#x27;m glad I only bought the travel size bottles to try it out. I won&#x27;t be buying it again.</li>
