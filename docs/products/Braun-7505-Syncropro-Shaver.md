      <li>Good shaver -</li>
      <li>I had been looking and looking for a good razor</li>

      <li>It provides a great shave catching all the hairs the Remington missed.</li>

      <li>I&#x27;m very pleased.</li>
      <li>and I have to say I am very pleased with the performance of this shaver.&lt;BR&gt;3.</li>
      <li>Very pleased with the results</li>
      <li>Now I am the most popular wife on the planet!</li>
      <li>I am enjoying the Braun 7505 Syncropro shaver!  </li>
      <li>The idea of a self cleaning razor seemed nice</li>
      <li>(No I don&#x27;t own stock in the company)</li>
      <li>cleaner is a nice addition.</li>
      <li>I already own a Syncopro Shaver</li>
      <li>I am very picky and demand a lot of my shaver, and this one is perfect.  </li>
      <li>A couple hours of charge and it was good to go for another 10 days or more.</li>
      <li>The idea of a self cleaning razor seemed nice</li>
      <li>Just keep it clean and buy the replacement parts when needed and you&#x27;ll be ib great shape.</li>
      <li>great way to clean the shaver.&lt;br /&gt;Conclusion:</li>
      <li>I like that it doesn&#x27;t require cleaning solution + conditioning solution + a special happy dance to get it to just shave.</li>
      <li>Also, I have a mustache and the built-in trimmer comes in handy and does a very accurate job.    </li>
      <li>This is just coolness overriding good design, in my opinion.&lt;br /&gt;Finally, the case is somewhat cheap, though still functional.</li>
      <li>So far, this has been the perfect electric shaver for me.</li>
      <li>&lt;br /&gt;Since I travel abroad occasionally for work and leisure, it&#x27;s incredibly helpful to have a charge cord that is \\&quot;universal.\\&quot; Good thinking.</li>
      <li>Otherwise, I like it, been getting nice close shaves, smooth operation, good trimmer edge, comfortable.</li>
      <li>I decided to come back to Braun and purchased this model with which I am very happy.</li>
      <li>Sooo much better than what he had before.</li>
      <li>The reason I choose Braun is because I love my shaver and have never had any problems.</li>
      <li>I have tried several brands of electrics, but the Braun shavers work best for me.    </li>
      <li>/&gt;Could use better grade plastics for the body parts.</li>
      <li>Ergonomically, the 7505 is a tad lighter and feels better in the hand than the 6520.  </li>
      <li>the most part, the inside of the razor head and cutter blocks look as if they just came out of the box.  </li>
      <li>I purchased one of these as a replacement for a Braun 6520 that has served me faithfully for many years.  </li>
      <li>, it has a better trimmer and</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used it on and off for 3 months and am totally satisfied.</li>
      <li>my neck is healthy again.  </li>
      <li>The 7526, 7570, and 7680 models are all better but no longer made.</li>
      <li>the most part, the inside of the razor head and cutter blocks look as if they just came out of the box.  </li>
      <li>If you buy this unit (or any electric shaver), make sure you know what direction your hair grows.</li>
      <li>Maybe I&#x27;ll try to be more disciplined about charging it correctly.</li>
      <li>When plugged in the shaving head moves faster and delivers a better shave then when cordless.</li>
      <li>again, a razor will be a better shave, but, you cant beat the convenience of an electric shaver.</li>
      <li>Because of the User Reviews I was confident this shaver would appeal to my husband&#x27;s no frills, no nonsense, rate on performance and price, mentality.  </li>
      <li>To better understand my rating, I use both safety and electric razors.</li>
      <li>When it&#x27;s running out of charge, it starts out OK, then dies during the shave.  </li>
      <li>After using a Remington for many years, I burnt out the charger in Europe.</li>
      <li>the next best thing.&lt;br /&gt;1</li>
      <li>use Amazon for most of my purchases and update my reviews if anything changes with the products.</li>
      <li>The design is pretty good as well.</li>
      <li>It hurt a lot.&lt;br /&gt;The Syncro UltraSpeed is pretty good.</li>
      <li>I considered rotary shavers, but in the end am glad I stuck with a foil shaver, because it lets me shave accurately around my sideburns, nose and chin dimple.</li>
      <li>I got the Braun and was very pleased from my first shave on.  </li>
      <li>I wouldn&#x27;t want to take it on a trip because of it&#x27;s heft, but it&#x27;s keeping the razor feeling fresh and leaves a nice smell.</li>
      <li>Charge remains strong for about 2 weeks.</li>
      <li>Update October 10, 2009  Still going strong with the 7505.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> The Braun gives a good shave, but I found that this model  doesn&#x27;t have the red low-charge light my old model had.  Not a major problem, but I miss it.</li>
    <li> My previous shaver, the Braun 6520, worked a alot better than this toy. &lt;BR&gt;With this Shaver:&lt;BR&gt;The &amp;quot;automatic lock&amp;quot; doesn&#x27;t work. It tends to &amp;quot;unlock&amp;quot; all of a sudden on you.&lt;BR&gt;The shave is &amp;quot;o.k&amp;quot;&lt;BR&gt;The Plastic cover is always taking off the entire shaver head.&lt;BR&gt;The travel case is flimsy &lt;BR&gt;Unless you clean you shaver everyday, expect it to be a dirty shave the next time.&lt;BR&gt;Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> This is my second Braun top of the line shaver. To better understand my rating, I use both safety and electric razors. For beards more than a day old I use the safety razor because I can get a smooth shave faster than with the Braun. For a really close shave, I finish with the Braun, usually in the morning after shaving in the evening with a safety razor . I have used many electric shavers this way and rate the 7505 as the best. The 7505 has an excellent trimmer that I would not do without. Because of the way I use an electric razor, I did not purchase the 7526 with the Clean and Change base which is a convenience for those that use only an electric shaver. The extra cost is for the base, since the razors are the same. Manual cleaning is easy and eliminates the requirement to have refill cartridges for the base</li>
    <li> I already own a Syncopro Shaver so I decided to get one for my dad. He had been asking about electric shavers for a couple of weeks prior to me purhasing one for him. The reason I choose Braun is because I love my shaver and have never had any problems. Just keep it clean and buy the replacement parts when needed and you&#x27;ll be ib great shape. I love the way it shaves nice and clean!!!! I trully recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Great shaver -- I have been using this model for 6 years.  Don&#x27;t bother with the silly cleaning system you can optionally get, and not sure why the LCD display version would help me in any way.  The cleaning system uses up the extremely expensive cleaning solution in a week or two and looks butt-ugly, to boot.  Save your money. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is the battery: I know about issues with rechargeable batteries -- you have to completely discharge them before recharging them.  I didn&#x27;t do that on my first shaver, and eventually resigned myself to just leaving it plugged in, which worked fine for the last 5 years.  Then it just gave out all together.  Too bad you can&#x27;t replace the battery, as far as I know.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;With the new one, I&#x27;m still on my first charge for 10 days.  Maybe I&#x27;ll try to be more disciplined about charging it correctly.</li>
    <li> This is the second Braun shaver that I&#x27;ve owned. The first one lasted about eight years until the battery finally gave up.  I then decided to buy a Remington which turned out to be a big mistake as the battery lasted only three years before it died.    I decided to come back to Braun and purchased this model with which I am very happy. I get about eight or nine shaves to a charge and the shave is always close and comfortable. Also, I have a mustache and the built-in trimmer comes in handy and does a very accurate job.    Braun makes a solid, reliable product and I would highly recommend this model to anyone in the market for a new electric shaver.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using electric shavers for over 20 years.  I had been using the same Braun electric shaver (model 5065 or 5605 I think) with satisfying results since 1985 or so until late August, 2002 when the battery was unable to take a recharge and it would not function even when I plugged it in to an outlet with the AC cord.     I considered repairing it, however, the repair cost did not offer enough value to me.  I tried using shaving cream and a blade again, but found that I still tend to nick myself on the chin area.  So, I did my research and elected to get the Braun 7505.    Some uncertainty remained when I made the purchase given some comments I had read about the durability of the foil, the inability to purchase a new foil alone, as well as some differences in the shaver head.  I know from experience, however, that the foils are sensitive and I have learned that the secret to their durability is to keep them out of harms way when not in use; my experience has been to purchase a new foil every 2 years or so -- and I did not have to buy the cutter block with it.    After 30+ days of experience with the 7505, I am very pleased with it.  It glides easily and provides a terrific shave for me.  I have been cleaning the foil and cutter with hot water myself once a week -- I did not get the automatic cleaning base -- and find it easier to clean than the earlier model I had used.  I use a childsize toothbrush to clean the cutter and find that it does a terrific job and lasts much longer than the Braun cleaning brush.     I can&#x27;t forecast how it will be performing in 6 months to a year.  If I can, however, I&#x27;ll provide an updated review.  Based on initial performance, I highly recommend this electric shaver.    Update October 10, 2009  Still going strong with the 7505. I just bought my third foil and block -- not bad for about 7 years of experience. It continues to offer me a wonderful shave. Charge remains strong for about 2 weeks. And, for any bike racers out there whomight care, it does a great job on the legs! I continue to highly recommend this electric shaver, although, I&#x27;m not sure whether it is still in production. This model may have been replaced with something more current.</li>
    <li> Pro: &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Good old solid shaver, looks like one, and works like one. Get the job done well. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Con: &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Could use better grade plastics for the body parts. The plastic parts in the shaving head feels scarily fragile, looks very un-German to me. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Quite loud. Coming from Norelco 6886XL, it takes me a while to get used to the Braun&#x27;s high pitch noise. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Did I say it&#x27;s loud? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But after tried the new and flimsy Norelcos, I have no choice but to switch to this Braun - it costs more to service my old Norelco 6886XL.</li>
    <li> After using a Remington for many years, I burnt out the charger in Europe. So, I decided to look for a product that could handle multi-voltages. I wish I had looked earlier. This Braun is wonderful. It provides a great shave catching all the hairs the Remington missed. The charge lasts at least two weeks and it charges quickly. The only negative thing to say is that it&#x27;s a little heavy.</li>
    <li> More gadgets than it is worth. After using the new 7505, I used my 11 year old Braun shaver that no longer holds a charge (still works plugged in). I used the old Braun to see if would shave any more than the 7505. IT DID! Totally suprised me, because the old Braun is a single dome shape head that doesn&#x27;t swivel and oscillate like the new and I have never changed anything on it either. It is hard to beat the old Braun. Too bad the batteries don&#x27;t last forever.</li>
    <li> This is my third Braun.  My last was a Flex Integral Ultra Speed which I loved.  It was one of the few electric razors I&#x27;ve used which was tough enough to handle thick facial hair (thickness)and not trash my face in the process.  However, tough as it was, I&#x27;d dropped it one time too many and a Syncro said happy birthday to me.&lt;br /&gt;Had it not been a gift, I&#x27;m not sure I would have bought it.  The idea of a self cleaning razor seemed nice but I wondered how much of the price was going towards the &amp;quot;gadget factor&amp;quot; and how much was building a solid razor.  I also would not have spent the money to get the LCD display model but I&#x27;m glad to have it now having used it.&lt;br /&gt;Compared to the Flex Integral Ultra Speed, the Syncro doesn&#x27;t seem as tough and strong.  However, it makes the difference in the design of the head.  Aside from an extra 1000 or so passes per minute, its real advantage comes from the side to side pivot of the shaver head.  I still find myself surprised how much the small degree of side to side pivoting can make.  Its a bit hard to describe the result except that the head just grips better.  &lt;br /&gt;The end result is a shave that is definitely closer and longer lasting than the Integral&#x27;s, though I wish it had a bit more power behind it for cutting through second day facial hair.&lt;br /&gt;The Syncro also maintains its improvements with the self cleaning system.  (check models).  When you finish shaving each day, you place the razor into the cleaning / charging / storage cradle which then proceeds to clean and sterilize the razor.  The process takes about 15 minutes for cleaning, 60 minutes for cleaning and charging.  It requires special cleaning fluid refils which will run you about $9.99 each.  They last about 30 cleaning cycles.  The fluid acts as a cleaner and as a lubricant and is surprisingly effective...at cleaning...though I wish they would have left the fragrance out.  Unfortunately the fluid is very flamible which limits where the cradle cango.  The fluid refil cartridges don&#x27;t lock in to the cradle and can spill if the cradle is knocked over...The cradle uses the razors power cord and also charges the razor as needed.&lt;br /&gt;For the most part, the inside of the razor head and cutter blocks look as if they just came out of the box.  However, there is a residue build up that requires a quick brushing (included with case) every now and then. Usually the LCD will display Clean! or Oil! during your shave if this builds up.  &lt;br /&gt;Overall I&#x27;m really impressed.  What I would have passed off as gadget is really quite nice.  It&#x27;s nice to pick up a fresh, clean razor in the morning.</li>
    <li> I had an old Braun electric that couldn&#x27;t hold a charge anymore, so it was time buy a new one. I went to a little shaver shop where the guy let me try a wide variety of shavers. Most were like my old Braun, though the Norelco Quadra really chewed up my face. Blood and red bumps all over my neck. It hurt a lot.&lt;br /&gt;The Syncro UltraSpeed is pretty good. When plugged in the shaving head moves faster and delivers a better shave then when cordless. I have a thin, angular face, and the Braun can&#x27;t seem to get the corners of my jaw line or chin very well. It also can&#x27;t deliver a close shave on some portions of my cheeks. On the salesman&#x27;s suggestion, I used a \\&quot;pre-shave gel\\&quot; for electric shaver. It seemed to really improve the shave for me (though Afta is terrible). &lt;br /&gt;Compared to a razor, the Braun delivers a shave equivalent to 1.5 days after shaving with a razor (your beard growth will vary). That is, it&#x27;s not a \\&quot;close\\&quot; shave, but it&#x27;s good enough. If I could use a razor without cutting myself, I would. If you use a razor now, definitely stick to it.  &lt;br /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;m happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> After much reluctance in switching from a long history with Norelco razors, the issue was forced when my Quadra shaver died. I read the reviews and decided to give the Braun a try. The instructions say to allow several weeks to adjust to the new razor, but from the first try on, this thing has been giving me the closest shave I&#x27;ve had. The Norelco did a fine job as well, but I had a constant irritation on my neck (which is also why blades never worked for me). While I still have to work a little harder on the neck, the irritation and skin break out has gone away since switching to the Braun.&lt;br /&gt;The cleaner is a nice addition. I wouldn&#x27;t want to take it on a trip because of it&#x27;s heft, but it&#x27;s keeping the razor feeling fresh and leaves a nice smell. I&#x27;&#x27;m only using the cleaner once every 3 or 4 shaves. Battery life is excellent with a charge lasting close to two weeks (average 6 minutes per shave). &lt;br /&gt;Great shave, great value, ..... Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> The 7505 is great.  It&#x27;s a close shave and cuts through a 2 day growth remarkably well.  This is the 3rd Braun shaver I&#x27;ve had and by far the best.  The charge lasts almost 2 weeks with everyday use.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not very happy with this shaver....I had an 8+ year old Norelco that worked much better than this one..... &lt;br /&gt;I have to go over alot of areas several times to get all the hair, and sometimes I still miss areas around my jawline. &lt;br /&gt;As a rule of thumb, I like to buy German products, but this time it didn&#x27;t work out so well....eventually I&#x27;ll buy another Norelco most likely.</li>
    <li> THe 7505 Syncropro Shaver is a great choice. I have owned several Braun shavers and all have been damaged during travel. Each one I get seems better then the last. Although the plug is a bit bulky, the shaver shaves closer and better then the past three and does a good job getting the course hairs laying flat on my face. I reccomend it highly.</li>
    <li> Good shaver - I have tough spots on my neck that all electric shavers have problems with.....this one is better than other Norelcos and Remingtons that I have owned. I also like the power that I feel when using this razor - it is loud, manly, and I feel like I am accomplishing something! :)</li>
    <li> So far, this has been the perfect electric shaver for me. I give it 4 stars instead of 5 only because it&#x27;s still not as good as a blade and it takes some persistence to really get some of the flat-lying hairs on my neck. It is definitely better than other electrics I have used, although I swore them off for poor performance and haven&#x27;t used one regularly for probably 10 years.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I bought this shaver since I do a fair amount of travel, and it&#x27;s easier to carry on an electric with all the restrictions these days. The unit is pretty lightweight -- none of the fancy charging bases and cleaning solutions to weigh you down. The non-rigid carrying case is easy to pack in amongst other stuff. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;For me, the razor held a charge for about 10 days of pretty extensive use, working well for me right up to the time the battery died a quick death. A couple hours of charge and it was good to go for another 10 days or more. My first charge was done in India, and as advertised the shaver dealt well with the higher voltage electricity. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;If you want a good, reliable, no frills shaver, this seems like a good bet.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;</li>
    <li> I damaged my old Syncro, and since it was beyond the warranty, I decided to get a new one after a long period of shaving with blade razors (and getting sick of them). I did a fair amount of research to find the \\&quot;best\\&quot; razor based on user comments/ratings, online reviews, etc. and the Syncro kept coming up again and again.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Although the instructions from Braun tell you that it may take up to 30 days for your beard to fully adjust to an electric razor/Syncro specifically, I was impressed after the first few days! It maintains a strong charge (based on the amount of time I use it each morning) for at least a week.  &lt;br /&gt;Since I travel abroad occasionally for work and leisure, it&#x27;s incredibly helpful to have a charge cord that is \\&quot;universal.\\&quot; Good thinking. &lt;br /&gt;Compared to the last Syncro, I noticed that the actual shaving head is more tightly attached to the razor itself. The screen looks (and feels) more durable and comfortable, and the raised ridges along the side of the razor seem to be a bit more pronounced and therefore much easier to grip. &lt;br /&gt;The shaver is very easy to clean, and the various settings and adjustments make it incredibly versatile and useful for edging around sideburns and getting those tough spots under your nose and on your neck. A great product - I&#x27;ll be recommending this to everyone.</li>
    <li> I ordered this for my husband who is very prone to razor burn.  He really likes it.</li>
    <li> I am enjoying the Braun 7505 Syncropro shaver!  The shaving head is very well designed, with an option for the head to pivot to fit my face or lock in place as I work a problem spot.    The trimmer is very nicely designed, with the cutting edge at a right angle to the shaver instead of straight like my older shaver.  This angle of the trimmer makes it much easier to trim my mustache and beard.    As I would expect, the battery charges quickly. I&#x27;m getting more than a week on a charge, maybe a couple of weeks--as I&#x27;m writing, I can&#x27;t remember when I charged it last!    All in all, this shaver does everything I need it to do well, without the options that would have driven the cost higher.  It is not a cheap shaver, but I consider it very well worth the cost.</li>
    <li> I know a shaver may not sound very romantic but my wonderful husband could not have been happier when he received this Braun 7505 Syncropro Shaver as a present for our 22nd Anniversary! This shaver was a replacement for another Braun that was lost in a house fire in 2005. He has been using a blade razor for the past two years and he really missed the excellent performance of the Braun he used to own.  I knew I wanted to buy a Braun but the User Reviews were what sold me on this model. Something to note for the people who refer to the user reviews while trying to decide: Unlike other shavers, the reviews on this model were consistently 4&#x27;s and 5&#x27;s! Many products will have a few really good, highly rated reviews, and then a completely negative; this shaver sucks type of review. Because of the User Reviews I was confident this shaver would appeal to my husband&#x27;s no frills, no nonsense, rate on performance and price, mentality.  Sincere thanks to everyone who took time to rate this product because without your input, I would have been lost as to what model of Braun to purchase! Now I am the most popular wife on the planet! It was wonderful to surprise my husband of 22 years with a product I am unfamiliar with! It felt great to do something nice for my best friend who has been so loving, generous and supportive to me for all these years! My husband has commented over-and-over about the closeness of the shave and has thanked me several times for his new toy! I knew this model was a bull&#x27;s eye hit when he told me this is exactly the one he would have purchased for himself!  Additionally: After reading a review from a woman who uses this shaver on her legs I have now decided to buy one for myself and I am not an electric shaver person!</li>
    <li> Based on reviews, I purchased this for my husband. He really likes the close shave from this shaver.</li>
    <li> I never reviewed an item before. But let me tell you.. I bought this thing based on the reviews. I had been looking and looking for a good razor and I said, what the heck, everyone gave it 5 stars. For someone who thought electric razors were supposed to [be bad] , I&#x27;m a changed man. After one week of using this thing I am convinced it is an superb piece of equipment and, I feel, excellently priced. I&#x27;ve bought others that cost more and did less. You have a tough beard? You want a good shaver? BUY THIS THING.. you will not be disappointed! (No I don&#x27;t own stock in the company)</li>
    <li> Very pleased with the results and it is convenient for daily use.</li>
    <li> The Braun 7505 is a great shaver! I recently purchased one to replace my 10 yr old Braun 5520. The rechargeable battery went on the 5520 after 10 yrs of use. The cost of replacing the battery, new blades and foil would have been more expensive than the purchase of the new 7505. Still, I was reluctant to let the old 5520 go because I was so very satisfied with it. &lt;br /&gt;I made the right choice, however, as the new 7505 is even better! No complaints. Buy a 7505 and you won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
    <li> I happily shaved with a Panasonic wet/dry shaver for years, but it finally gave up the ghost.  I ordered what appeared to be the direct successor, but it did a horrible job.  Lots of hairs left behind, really bad at picking up slightly long hairs.  Took me many passes to get everything, finally having to use the beard trimmer on some parts. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I then got this Braun, and it&#x27;s exactly what I wanted.  Good, smooth, fast shave, no real shortcomings.</li>
    <li> My husband says it works very well. We are very pleased with the product, but disappointed with the crappy carrying case. We are just using the case from his previous shaver instead.</li>
    <li> this is the best electric shaver i have ever owned.  it gives a nice close shave with minimal skin irritation.  it is quiet and has an amazing battery life.  no electric shaver shaves like a razor, but this comes close and is light years ahead of any other electric i have ever owned.  in researching this, it appears that this has the same shaving head as some of the more expensive braun products, the main difference being it does not have the built in cleaning mechanism (and the associated cost of buying the supplies for this on an ongoing basis from braun).  it is easy to clean this shaver manually.</li>
    <li> My old Braun shaver died on me, so I purchased this as a replacement.  It gives a really close shave, and I especially like the pivoting head.  This is a great improvement over my previous shaver, and I would highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> My old Braun stopped working after about 8 years.  After buying a Norelco Synchro and trying it out for almost a month, I returned it -- it was awkward to use, did not give a close shave and it would always leave a few short hairs that it refused to cut.  Also, I had trouble cutting close to my sideburns and mustache without cutting into them.  &lt;br /&gt;I bought the Braun 7505.  What a huge difference.  Even before the Braun was broken in, it was easier to hold, caused less irritation, and shaved closer and more efficiently than a broken-in Norelco.  It really was no contest.</li>
    <li> For the past few years, I stopped using electric shavers because I was disappointed with the results. While I still believe the closest shave is with a razor, (Mach 3 is awesome), for an electric shaver, the Braun 7505 is the next best thing.&lt;br /&gt;1. price: I have absolutely no regrets about purchasing the  Braun. &lt;BR&gt;2. shave: shaves great. again, a razor will be a better shave, but, you cant beat the convenience of an electric shaver. No mess, no fuss, and takes less time. technology has come a long way and I have to say I am very pleased with the performance of this shaver.&lt;BR&gt;3. battery power: still relatively new, but this thing seems to last forever in between charges. I have charged it once and have been able to use it everyday for several weeks without recharging it. (i have moderate facial hair).&lt;BR&gt;4. clean up: a cinch. If you run out of the cleaning solution, don&#x27;t worry. I just blast compressed air to clean the shaver. great way to clean the shaver.&lt;br /&gt;Conclusion: Excellent price, great shave, easy clean up and great battery power makes this shaver a standout.</li>
    <li> I have had my Braun 7505 for six months and am very satisfied.  I bought it to replace a older Braun.  What I like most about the 7505, in addition to the close shave - and I have a heavy beard, is it keeps its charge at a consistent high power level throughout its ~ two week charge.  At the end of about two weeks, the shaver will - almost all at once - lose its charge.  If I am in the middle of a shave when this happens, I just plug in the unit to finish the shave.  I greatly prefer this discharging  profile over my earlier Braun and other rotary shavers which lost power bit-by-bit over the discharging cycle of the unit.</li>
    <li> When my Braun 7505 broke earlier this year (after several years of use) I switched to a Norelco Spectra 8894XL for several months.  Despite all the positive reviews, I have given up on the Spectra and gone back to the Braun 7505.  The main problem with the Spectra is that it irritates your neck.  The first time I shaved, my neck was actually all bloody.  Even after trying every sensitivity setting, it still tends to cause red marks and irritation on the neck.  After switching back to the Braun 7505 my neck is healthy again.  The 7505 has many other advantages over the Spectra -- it is cheaper, smaller, it has a better trimmer and its single cutter is more accurate (especially for side burns) than the Spectra 3 head design.  On the negative side, the Braun tends to get stuck and pull hairs, if you go too long without shaving.  Also the Braun does take a little longer to shave with because you usually have to go over the same areas several times.  The cutters and screen do need to be replaced every few months for around $25.  I waited too long once, and the screen broke off into my chin giving me a nasty cut.  One other problem is the switch is rather flimsy.  After a year the blue automatic lock on the switch broke and fell off.</li>
    <li> I purchased one of these as a replacement for a Braun 6520 that has served me faithfully for many years.  Shaving performance is about the same as for the 6520, although the foil screen design has been \\&quot;modernized\\&quot; ... perhaps nominally more gentle for the skin.  Ergonomically, the 7505 is a tad lighter and feels better in the hand than the 6520.  I am happy to see that Braun has maintained product quality with improvements in both design and performance.  Followup: I&#x27;ve been using this for over a month now and am happy to report it is bigger advance over the 6520 model than I initially thought.  The new foil screen design permits a closer shave with less razor burn.  I am very pleased.</li>
    <li> I purchased this razor for my son who is in the military on an Aircraft Carrier.  He likes the compact design and the fact that it came with a small storage case,... perfect for stowing it his limited space.  He says it shaves as close as a regular blade razor once he got used to using it.</li>
    <li> I have had (and been disappointed) in less expensive Braun foil shavers.  This one however is a great improvement and theoretically will be a better buy in the long run because it is possible to replace the parts which wear.  A bit bulky but worth the extra cost.  I needed the sideburn/mustache/beard trimmer which seems to work perfectly (once one acquires the steady hand which is needed to avoid quaint gouges in the beard/mustache).  It you are looking for a foil electric with pop up trimmer- get this one.</li>
    <li> Great product, but is louder then other shavers. My husband loves it and is very happy with the close clean shave he gets.</li>
    <li> Bought this shaver as a Christmas gift for my son and he loves it! &lt;br /&gt;I would recommend it to anyone. &lt;br /&gt;</li>
    <li> I bought this shaver to replace a 15 year old Braun that I was having trouble finding a new foil and blades for.  I really liked my old shaver, but this one is even better.  The dual screen design is much better at catching and trimming hairs that I let get too long. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;This shaver is fairly big and heavy, which is actually a good thing because it is comfortable to hold.  Much of the weight must be batteries, because it holds a charge for a long time. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;One thing to remember is that this shaver is not waterproof, so you can&#x27;t clean it under the faucet.  This is not a problem for me, but some people might like that feature.</li>
    <li> I had been dissatisfied with several shavers, so I did some research.  I wanted to know the difference between men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s razors.  I read that men&#x27;s are better-suited to coarser hair.  Well, my leg hair is coarse enough to be a man&#x27;s beard, so I got a men&#x27;s shaver.  This thing works!  If I shave my legs right after I get out of the shower (after drying off), my legs are just as smooth for just as long as with a standard razor.  And even completely dry, I get a smooth shave.  It&#x27;s a great legs razor.</li>
    <li> This is my third Braun.  My last was a Flex Integral Ultra Speed which I loved.  It was one of the few electric razors I&#x27;ve used which was tough enough to handle thick facial hair (thickness)and not trash my face in the process.  However, tough as it was, I&#x27;d dropped it one time too many and a Syncro said happy birthday to me.&lt;br /&gt;Had it not been a gift, I&#x27;m not sure I would have bought it.  The idea of a self cleaning razor seemed nice but I wondered how much of the price was going towards the &amp;quot;gadget factor&amp;quot; and how much was building a solid razor.  I also would not have spent the money to get the LCD display model but I&#x27;m glad to have it now having used it.&lt;br /&gt;Compared to the Flex Integral Ultra Speed, the Syncro doesn&#x27;t seem as tough and strong.  However, it makes the difference in the design of the head.  Aside from an extra 1000 or so passes per minute, its real advantage comes from the side to side pivot of the shaver head.  I still find myself surprised how much the small degree of side to side pivoting can make.  Its a bit hard to describe the result except that the head just grips better.  &lt;br /&gt;The end result is a shave that is definitely closer and longer lasting than the Integral&#x27;s, though I wish it had a bit more power behind it for cutting through second day facial hair.&lt;br /&gt;The Syncro also maintains its improvements with the self cleaning system.  (check models).  When you finish shaving each day, you place the razor into the cleaning / charging / storage cradle which then proceeds to clean and sterilize the razor.  The process takes about 15 minutes for cleaning, 60 minutes for cleaning and charging.  It requires special cleaning fluid refils which will run you about $9.99 each.  They last about 30 cleaning cycles.  The fluid acts as a cleaner and as a lubricant and is surprisingly effective...at cleaning...though I wish they would have left the fragrance out.  Unfortunately the fluid is very flamible which limits where the cradle cango.  The fluid refil cartridges don&#x27;t lock in to the cradle and can spill if the cradle is knocked over...The cradle uses the razors power cord and also charges the razor as needed.&lt;br /&gt;For the most part, the inside of the razor head and cutter blocks look as if they just came out of the box.  However, there is a residue build up that requires a quick brushing (included with case) every now and then. Usually the LCD will display Clean! or Oil! during your shave if this builds up.  &lt;br /&gt;Overall I&#x27;m really impressed.  What I would have passed off as gadget is really quite nice.  It&#x27;s nice to pick up a fresh, clean razor in the morning.</li>
    <li> I bought this razor based on the reviews that were posted. It came the other day and my husband thinks he has gone to shaving heaven. He absoultely loves the razor and I cannot believe what a close shave he gets. Sooo much better than what he had before. Highly recommend this product</li>
    <li> I first purchased a Norelco Spectra 8825 XL based on reviews.  It worked OK but left some whiskers behind and shave wasn&#x27;t all that close-within the course of a day, I had very noticeable stubble and I don&#x27;t have what I consider a fast or thick growing beard.&lt;br /&gt;So I got the Braun and was very pleased from my first shave on.  I chews through my stubble quickly and gives me a smooth shave; mind you, not a perfect shave (as with a razor), but a perfectly adequate shave.  The 3 o&#x27;clock shadow, late afternoon stubble problem I had with the Norelco is gone.&lt;br /&gt;I like this shaver enough that after only two weeks of use I had to come here to review it.  I&#x27;m very pleased.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used just about every brand of electric razor over the years: Sunbeam, Norelco, Remington, Braun etc... and I always keep coming back to Braun. Over the last six months, the 7505 has not been a disappointment.  The foil and blades are heavy duty.  Recommended foil changes are every 18 months, not every 3-6 months with other brands (Remington foils seldom held up that long). The shave is pretty close, and most importantly, it is comfortable.  It recharges quickly and battery life is long. I can go two weeks without recharging. If the battery is dead, you have the option of plugging it in and it&#x27;ll work (not like my last Remington Razor).  It&#x27;s a simple, no frills razor that works.  My previous Braun razors all worked for more than 5 years before the batteries died, and I suspect this Braun will be no different.</li>
    <li> I have used The Braun 7505 Syncro for over a month now. I switched from a wet shave to a dry shave because I have very sensitive skin and am prone to breakouts easily. I purchased the unit at the local Macy&#x27;s for about $100. I have a soft beard, and foil shavers work well with it. I really like this shaver a lot. It shaves fairly fast and cuts just about as close as any electric shaver that I have ever used, especially under my nose and along my jawline. It also gives a consistent, even shave when used correctly and is easy on my skin. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I give this product a four-star rating because of one thing: Braun advertises on TV that its \\&quot;smartfoil technology\\&quot; catches hair at any angle. For me, it does not. I was originally frustrated with this product because it always left a patch of stubble just below the right side of my chin. After feeling that area for the direction of growth, I discovered that the hair actually grew towards my right ear, unlike the rest of my hairs which grow downward. The solution is to simply turn the shaver head and shave into the direction of growth. If you buy this unit (or any electric shaver), make sure you know what direction your hair grows. It may save you time and frustration.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Overall, it&#x27;s a great unit. I would rebuy the unit if it were broken, lost, or stolen.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been a &#x27;blade guy&#x27; since I started shaving in the 60&#x27;s.  I switched to this shaver and I like it.  I have a light beard but need to shave daily, this shaver gives a close shave in less time than the blade.  Also, it&#x27;s not nearly as tough on my dry skin.  Not quite as close as the blade but good enough.  The sideburn trimmer is a plus.  I do find that if I skip a couple of days it&#x27;s harder to trim the longer hairs - daily is best.  I shave 4 - 5 times between charges and give it a good cleaning with every charge.  Most important, shave while the skin is dry - before the shower.</li>
    <li> This is my third Braun shaver. They seem to be lasting about ten years. I have tried several brands of electrics, but the Braun shavers work best for me.    For my beard, the Braun gives a closer, longer-lasting shave than a blade (even the three and four blade vibrating razors). Of course, different beards may have different results.    The new 7505 is quiet, powerful, and the best shaver I&#x27;ve owned. It is worthy successor to my venerable 4504. I don&#x27;t see the need for the \\&quot;bells and whistles\\&quot; on more expensive Brauns.</li>
    <li> After the usual 5-7 years, it was time to replace my razor.  The battery was beginning to need charging in a decreasing number of days each week.  I know I&#x27;ve been using them for at least 36 years.  My skin has become thinner and more fragile as I&#x27;ve aged.  Each new Braun has been better than it&#x27;s ancestor and this one is no exception.  It is quieter, faster, and less abrasive than its predecessors.  I want to completely discharge it a third time before I measure the exact charge lifespan but it&#x27;s already usable for almost two weeks without a charge. It&#x27;s a great razor and again, I love it!</li>
    <li> bought this 5 years ago for $116 thinking this cant be a piece of crap because its braun. Suffered until I used something different which was 10x better . I am angry and think a refund is in order. I noticed it is no longer available. Braun and crap means the same now.</li>
    <li> I am very picky and demand a lot of my shaver, and this one is perfect.  Replace the cutter every 2 years or so and it will work like a charm.  Well worth the $.</li>
    <li> This shaver was given to me when I was 15-16 and just began getting some facial hair. I&#x27;m 26 now and I still use this shaver. I had a Norelco before this one, and I like the Braun design the best. It hasn&#x27;t failed me yet, and I have no reason to upgrade. I&#x27;m surprised the internal battery is still kicking. I would imagine there is no reason to buy a shaver like this because it is so old, but I wanted to write a review anyway to get testimony to the quality of Braun shavers. Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> ...well, almost. Twenty-four hours after shaving, I have less beard than I did immediately after shaving with a model in the Braun 5000 series. And the self-cleaning system is truly remarkable. Less than two years later: the motor vibrated so much that the side clips fell off. The 7526, 7570, and 7680 models are all better but no longer made. Syncro has yielded to Pulsonic.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t say anything bad about the shaver. Everything works as expected.</li>
    <li> After using a razor for a few years, I decided to clean up my mornings and go with an electric.  I did my homework and bought one of the best.  I like the efficiency; my girlfriend likes my smoother face.</li>
    <li> This was a replacement for my old Braun foil shaver, and I&#x27;ve been quite happy with it, though with some minor quibbles. I&#x27;d purchase this shaver again if I had to make the same decision. &lt;br /&gt;The shave is quite good; better than my last foil (5550), and didn&#x27;t bother my skin a bit. The design is pretty good as well. Basically, it gives me a quick, close, clean shave every morning, and everything else ranks below that.&lt;br /&gt;One reviewer had a problem with the foil cover, where removing that would also remove the foil head. I&#x27;ve found that removing this clear plastic cover by the end tabs is the way to do it (earlier Braun covers were removed by gripping the flat sides, which can catch the foil cover on this model). No biggie, just a user re-education thing.&lt;br /&gt;Another small quibble is that the LEDs are under fluorescent-tinted plastic, so you&#x27;d swear an LED was lit until you walked into a dark closet to discover that it was just the fluorescent tint against the black body. This is just coolness overriding good design, in my opinion.&lt;br /&gt;Finally, the case is somewhat cheap, though still functional. Fortunately, I can still use my old Braun fully-closed zipper case for travel.&lt;br /&gt;All in all, this is a great shaver for the price. I like that it doesn&#x27;t require cleaning solution + conditioning solution + a special happy dance to get it to just shave. I considered rotary shavers, but in the end am glad I stuck with a foil shaver, because it lets me shave accurately around my sideburns, nose and chin dimple. All in all, I&#x27;ve been pretty happy for past 30 days, and enjoy using the 7505.</li>
    <li> The shaver is excellent.  Was very disappointed, however, in the extremely cheap travel case that now comes with these expensive Braun products.  This is my third Braun shaver, and the quality of the case has deteriorated steadily over the past decade or so.  My first in 1991 came with a very nice hard case for travel.  By 1998 the case had deteriorated to a soft cover zip close case, but still was compartmentalized and adequate for travel.  This new shaver came with a garbage case that I was too embarrased to even give to the Salvation Army, and threw it away (it&#x27;s useless) and am continuing to use the 1998 case which although not the greatest quality, is infinitely better than the junk that came with this shaver.  Hopefully the shaver itself doesn&#x27;t turn out to be constructed as inferiorily compared to the previous models as the case.</li>
    <li> This is the first electric shaver I bought so I can&#x27;t compare it to others or past experience. I bought the shaver because of the change in FAA flying rules and the need to eliminate liquids (shaving cream). I&#x27;ve used it on and off for 3 months and am totally satisfied. Doesn&#x27;t shave as close as a razor, but does an adequet job and holds a charge for a long time. I use it everyday as well as traveling and it does everything I expected.</li>
    <li> and that&#x27;s a low-power or charge-level indicator.  When it&#x27;s running out of charge, it starts out OK, then dies during the shave.  That&#x27;s annoying.  My old Braun had an LCD charge level display.  I&#x27;ve been getting about 5 shaves per charge, so I just have to remember to charge it periodically.  Oh, and when removing the protective cover, it tends to pop up the shaving head, and drop shavings.  Otherwise, I like it, been getting nice close shaves, smooth operation, good trimmer edge, comfortable.</li>
    <li> I bought my first syncro shaver in 2001.  It was working great for me until I got my luggage stolen at the Red Roof Inn in SeaTac, Washington.  I had to get a replacement shaver after that and since I liked this one so much I replaced it with the same thing.  I think it shaves closer than the gillette mach 3 and it doesn&#x27;t cause me to get zits or ingrown hairs.</li>
    <li> I keep this shaver in my truck for those rare times I missed a spot or I didn&#x27;t have time to shave or I just want to look my very best.  I use a small inverter to run it off my lighter socket.  When I do charge it up the charge lasts a long time.  The shave is close, but not uncomfortably so, even with a very tough beard like mine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use Amazon for most of my purchases and update my reviews if anything changes with the products. I do this so other Amazon users can get a real feel for the life of the product. You can look at my review which will be close to my purchase date and tell how the product is doing as time passes.  I am not associated with any company and all opinions are my very own.</li>
    <li> Still works great 6 years later.  This is the longest running shaver I&#x27;ve have found.</li>
