      <li>You can never be to sure when buying makeup online how it will be when you get it, but this was a nice surprise.</li>
      <li>Translucent Matte powder is sure to be a fit for most!</li>
      <li>It helps to blot out the oil on my face to give a more finish look,</li>

      <li>I love using this matifying powder.  </li>
      <li>love this product.</li>
      <li>I love this line of makeup.</li>
      <li>rather pay more for better quality.</li>
      <li>A swipe of this with a powder brush in the morning does a phenomenal job of keeping that in check.</li>
      <li>This is an okay product for me.</li>
      <li>price gone up though but love it.</li>
      <li>I picked this product because my skin tone is fair and it was the right matched.&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
      <li>Great matifier so far.</li>
      <li>A good translucent mattifying powder that&#x27;s really affordable as well.</li>
      <li>This setting powder doesn&#x27;t have fine texture, you can see clumps after using it for couple times.</li>
      <li>which is a huge plus.</li>
      <li>this powder is great for the price the white thing is a sponge in it</li>
      <li>it is silky and light.</li>
      <li>Cheap and has a quality.</li>
      <li>Our regular temps of 106 ect - it does a great job.</li>
      <li>My skin is staying matte and shine free</li>
      <li>It is great for a final brush over of the face.</li>
      <li>It makes my face look very nice and usually only reapply once during the day if needed in problem areas.</li>
      <li>But especially for the price, it&#x27;s very nice.  </li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t really like using the sponge applicator, goes on better with make-up brush.</li>
      <li>it works good, just smaller than what I expected.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>Not bad for the price.</li>
      <li>I liked it because it was a small container and fit nicely in my purse.  </li>
      <li>They were quick to ship as well.</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m enjoying it so far!</li>
      <li>The powder isn&#x27;t heavy, it&#x27;s perfect for days you want to look natural...</li>
      <li>and I rarely if ever wear foundation,</li>
      <li>The powder isn&#x27;t cakey and it disappears after you apply, leaving your skin matte and fresh.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s super small and the quality of this product is not that great..</li>
      <li>: I&#x27;m caucasian, naturally dark blond, but not porcelain or freckled; very light, almost neutral but more on the cool-toned side.</li>
      <li>But in general it&#x27;s an OK product, you get what you pay for.</li>
      <li>I use the puff to press in a little then use a nice brush to distribute and smooth.</li>
      <li>I bought this product at my local Wal-Mart for $3.00 based off of some Youtube videos I had watched and the lady&#x27;s really recommended this product for a nice matte finish</li>
      <li>Very light on your face would definitely recommend this product!! .</li>
      <li>Honestly, I don&#x27;t know whose skin is this color, but it&#x27;s easy to imagine a bunch of otherwise cute girls walking around looking like they got a weird spray tan mask that didn&#x27;t wipe off.</li>
      <li>If I used the applicator that came with it I have to be very careful with my blending to make sure I don&#x27;t leave a light brown streak anywhere.</li>
      <li>I really enjoy e.l.f products because you are buying a decent product at a reasonable price.</li>
      <li>Would work good for people who want to avoid using a base/primer and all that stuff and who want an everyday make up for on the go.</li>
      <li>So far, I am not disappointed in this product.</li>
      <li>It definitely cuts down on shine and is in a nice sleek case that could easily slip into any purse pocket.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend this and its works as well as much higher priced items.</li>
      <li>mattifies for hours and as someone with combination skin I really value that.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>It really does wonders if you use liquid cover up because it makes it matte without changing the color</li>
      <li>I have combination skin and this really helps with oil in my T zone.</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t realize how much my face was shining until I found this powder to apply over my foundation.  </li>
      <li>works very well to take shine away.</li>
      <li>very handle for people with oily face.</li>
      <li>But for the price I can&#x27;t really complain.</li>
      <li>and I noticed it really helps the eyeliner stay put as well.</li>
      <li>I had to learn to be very sparing</li>
      <li>However, using a powder brush instead really helps with the application</li>
      <li>The brand is reasonably priced.</li>
      <li>Now, it did run a bit in 110 - but really, what doesnt?</li>
      <li>Overall not bad for the money, and maybe only for light oil control.</li>
      <li>Great price, and a little goes a long way!  </li>
      <li>I barely use this product, it&#x27;s used more for its mirror than the actual powder.  </li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s more effective than other compacts of pressed powder I&#x27;ve used in the past.</li>
      <li>I use a lot of high end makeup, but I really like this setting powder.</li>
      <li>Looks natural and blends pretty well with the skin tone.</li>
      <li>But overall not bad.</li>
      <li>or it did settle in my wrinkles and make me look older</li>
      <li>I would highly recommend this powder.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this product and will buy again.</li>
      <li>, price is right; small compact is easy to manage and take with you, comes with mirror and application pad&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
      <li>Not all e.l.f. products are created equal, but for the price, this powder is worth checking out.</li>
      <li>Is this normal with pressed powders?</li>
      <li>I love this, I have been wearing this over the ELF mineral primer [green], and the ELF acne fighting foundation.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s okay, but really quite a small amount--and it&#x27;s darker than I would like.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I have oily skin but gets dry if I don&#x27;t moisturize.  Eyeliner, mascara and eye shadow looks like crap by the middle of the day.  This solved all of those problems plus no more shiny face. Walmart sells this for $3.00.  Love it!</li>
    <li> this powder is great for the price the white thing is a sponge in it</li>
    <li> This isn&#x27;t a bad powder, but that is all it is, a translucent powder.  The coverage is what you would expect from a translucent powder.</li>
    <li> Great matifying powder. It doesn&#x27;t feel heavy on the face and glides on smooth. A little goes a long way! Makes my makeup look good altogether.</li>
    <li> The brand is reasonably priced. The powder isn&#x27;t heavy, it&#x27;s perfect for days you want to look natural...but with a little help.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s super small and the quality of this product is not that great.. the powder to me wipes off my other makeup.. not impressed. will probably use only if I run out of my other powder..</li>
    <li> So far, I am not disappointed in this product. I read reviews from other websites before purchasing it. My skin is staying matte and shine free but it hasn&#x27;t hit that horrible New York City unbearable heat as of yet although it is warm. I hope it continues to keep the oil at bay and allow me to not worry about shiny skin this summer. Have a great day!!!</li>
    <li> Purchased as a Christmas present for my teen.  Translucent Matte powder is sure to be a fit for most!</li>
    <li> You get what you pay for, may be better for teens, but I am in my late 40&#x27;s...rather pay more for better quality.</li>
    <li> I love this, I have been wearing this over the ELF mineral primer [green], and the ELF acne fighting foundation. I have combination skin and this really helps with oil in my T zone. It makes my face look very nice and usually only reapply once during the day if needed in problem areas.</li>
    <li> Great bargain for what it does. It&#x27;s a great matifying powder without also adding color to your face. I used it throughout my wedding</li>
    <li> This has turned out to be an incredible product which is also a great value.  Highly recommend this and its works as well as much higher priced items.</li>
    <li> So worth the money really good quality.</li>
    <li> Very loose; falls off brush.  But overall not bad.</li>
    <li> Great to keep in my purse. The color is great and it does help mattify my skin. Great for touchups during the day. I&#x27;d recommend it!</li>
    <li> Read about this product in Redbook. They stated it was good for keeping your face makeup from melting off in the heat. Since I live in Las Vegas, NV - this was a must and it&#x27;s been hard to find something that works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product is great. I put it on under my daily face cream and then over my makeup (on my eyelids as well, prior to eyeshadow) and it works very well. Even in 110 degree heat. Now, it did run a bit in 110 - but really, what doesnt? Our regular temps of 106 ect - it does a great job. I actually have to scrub my eyes to get the eyeshadow off - and before it never stayed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: works great, price is right; small compact is easy to manage and take with you, comes with mirror and application pad&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: not enough product - I&#x27;ve used it every day for 3 weeks and I&#x27;m almost out. But for the price I can&#x27;t really complain.</li>
    <li> Love this brand! Not made w/ crushed beatles for color!  They were quick to ship as well.</li>
    <li> idk why but for me, it makes me look cakey. I like it, don&#x27;t get me wrong, but its for those days that are hot that I will use it. since its getting to the colder season, I might use it on its own. there&#x27;s no sun in Washington. no one will notice lol.</li>
    <li> Ever try a foundation that you could instantly tell it was too pink? You think you must be imagining things, so you do a new spot on your face or hand...nope, too pink, better throw it in that one makeup box you have full of crap you can&#x27;t use. Well, this is supposed to be a powder -- and this is supposed to be translucent -- and yet, it&#x27;s thick and it&#x27;s got an OBVIOUS pink pigment to it! What the...! Honestly, I don&#x27;t know whose skin is this color, but it&#x27;s easy to imagine a bunch of otherwise cute girls walking around looking like they got a weird spray tan mask that didn&#x27;t wipe off. If you&#x27;re looking for something to dust on, like one of the HD or PhotoReady or Set powders, this is not it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(Note: I&#x27;m caucasian, naturally dark blond, but not porcelain or freckled; very light, almost neutral but more on the cool-toned side. Usually makeup will look too orange-y on me, or too tan. If you have the same experiences, DO NOT BUY THIS!)</li>
    <li> Great price, and a little goes a long way!  I had to learn to be very sparing or it did settle in my wrinkles and make me look older (I&#x27;m 50).  But especially for the price, it&#x27;s very nice.  I use the puff to press in a little then use a nice brush to distribute and smooth.</li>
    <li> Dark girls please don&#x27;t buy this. Its not for our skin tones. On us it is not translucent just makes us look like we are ghost. If you are white then proceed.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s okay, but really quite a small amount--and it&#x27;s darker than I would like.</li>
    <li> I like the powder, it is just so small. I&#x27;ve had mine for about 2 weeks and its almost gone. I only wear makeup to work so its not like im calling it on everyday. Also, its probably cheaper at your local Wal-Mart.</li>
    <li> I use this every day and I like it. Very light on your face would definitely recommend this product!! .</li>
    <li> I have been the Mac&#x27;s blot powder for years. The powder is very similar. It helps to blot out the oil on my face to give a more finish look,</li>
    <li> Was looking for this to match my foundation, but it was not as much lighter as I expected..</li>
    <li> I recommend applying this with the e.l.f. mineral powder brush.</li>
    <li> While I assumed &amp;#34;translucent&amp;#34; would mean it bordered on colorless, I was wrong.&lt;br /&gt;I have very fair skin and this was actually darker than my skin tone. If I used the applicator that came with it I have to be very careful with my blending to make sure I don&#x27;t leave a light brown streak anywhere. However, using a powder brush instead really helps with the application so I opt to do that instead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will say though that this product WORKS. Its why I&#x27;ve kept it and bother with alternative application methods.&lt;br /&gt;Its mattifies for hours and as someone with combination skin I really value that.&lt;br /&gt;I also have eyelids that are oil-prone and I don&#x27;t often wear eyeshadow. A swipe of this with a powder brush in the morning does a phenomenal job of keeping that in check.</li>
    <li> love this product. price gone up though but love it. works very well to take shine away. i use it as my touch up make during the day or when i am out. very handle for people with oily face. days i do not want to bother with make, i just apply this alone. it does not make you ashy even for a dark skin like me.</li>
    <li> I would highly recommend this powder. I have oily skin and it&#x27;s more effective than other compacts of pressed powder I&#x27;ve used in the past.</li>
    <li> I use a lot of high end makeup, but I really like this setting powder. I have olive toned skin and it still blends well.</li>
    <li> This setting powder doesn&#x27;t have fine texture, you can see clumps after using it for couple times. But in general it&#x27;s an OK product, you get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> f*cking terrible the makeup is half gone and all over the place</li>
    <li> Not bad for the price. Keep in my purse to freshen my face as the day goes on. Don&#x27;t really like using the sponge applicator, goes on better with make-up brush.</li>
    <li> A good translucent mattifying powder that&#x27;s really affordable as well. It arrived in perfect condition.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I tend to throw stuff like this into a little pouch, which I then carry around with me as I go about my day, and after just one night out, the powder cracked and now, it&#x27;s in tiny bits and pieces. Is this normal with pressed powders? Anyway, I would purchase it again, but I am just now trying out e.l.f.&#x27;s HD powder.</li>
    <li> beware.  You are getting about a tablespoon of powder in this compact.  I thought it was slightly chalky as well.</li>
    <li> I love using this matifying powder.  I didn&#x27;t realize how much my face was shining until I found this powder to apply over my foundation.  The price is very reasonable and I&#x27;ve gone through several orders now.</li>
    <li> I am a makeup artist so I tend to buy a lot of different brands of makeup for my kit. Mainly because not everyone&#x27;s skin is the same and does not react the same to certain brands of make up. I really liked this it is silky and light. It is great for a final brush over of the face. It brightens and is not heavy which is a huge plus. You can never be to sure when buying makeup online how it will be when you get it, but this was a nice surprise. Deff recommend this.</li>
    <li> This is an okay product for me. It does the job, but it also make my makeup look darker after applied. However, I&#x27;ll stick with this until I find something better.</li>
    <li> I just had one layer with the sponge and all shine dissapeared. Would work good for people who want to avoid using a base/primer and all that stuff and who want an everyday make up for on the go. Looks natural and blends pretty well with the skin tone.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about 2 weeks now and I&#x27;m enjoying it so far! It definitely cuts down on shine and is in a nice sleek case that could easily slip into any purse pocket. The sponge on the inside in handy too, but I&#x27;ve been using a brush to apply the makeup. I&#x27;m curious to see how it&#x27;ll do during the summer months when I have to worry about shine!</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! One of my favorite powders out there. But you can get it for 3 bucks at Walmart.</li>
    <li> I bought this twice, but won&#x27;t buy again.  I liked it because it was a small container and fit nicely in my purse.  However, with the first one, the powder broke apart when it was only 1/2 used.  I ordered another one &amp; it arrived with all the powder broken.</li>
    <li> It is non-carcinogenic and it is powder!  The case is pretty big, and I use a brush rather than the sponge.</li>
    <li> I love this line of makeup. I will only buy E.L.F. from now on!!!</li>
    <li> Works great as a matte powder. removes the shine without making my skin look too cakey. the only problem that I notice is that It says transculent, but after putting it on I notice a slightly darker tint to my skin</li>
    <li> I really enjoy e.l.f products because you are buying a decent product at a reasonable price. The Translucent Matifying Powder was the color I expected it to be and matched my skin tone well once blended. However, blending the powder was a little difficult at first because the provided sponge lays it on thick. I have found it easier to use a blush brush instead because of how dense the powder is. There is also not a large amount provided, so if you only use the provided sponge you will find that you run out quickly, but if you use a brush it will last slightly longer. Unfortunately I am on the fence on whether or not I would buy this product again. Again the color blended with my skin tone well, but it is a small quantity of a dense product.</li>
    <li> Great matifier so far. I have not yet used it in the winter. I do have to use more blush/bronzer because of the pale powder.</li>
    <li> This matifying powder is wonderful! I have very oily skin and e.l.f.&#x27;s powder goes a long way in helping to keep it under control. I typically use this to touch up my makeup throughout the day. Not all e.l.f. products are created equal, but for the price, this powder is worth checking out. I&#x27;ve used more expensive matifying powders, and I really can&#x27;t tell the difference.</li>
    <li> I always had a problem with my mascara smearing underneath my eyes after an hour or two. I watched a youtube video that said to put translucent powder under your eyes to stop the smearing. Now I hate face powders and I rarely if ever wear foundation, but I hated smeared mascara more. So I bought this cheapie for $3 at Walmart just to try out this suggestion. And it works, no more smear marks! The powder isn&#x27;t cakey and it disappears after you apply, leaving your skin matte and fresh. i&#x27;ve started applying this to my eyelids before putting on my liquid eyeliner and I noticed it really helps the eyeliner stay put as well. I do have a problem with redness around my nose so just to bring the redness down I&#x27;ll apply this which helps. I highly recommend this product and will buy again.</li>
    <li> Ok product for the money. Needs to be applied with another brush and is a little thicker than I thought.</li>
    <li> I picked this product because my skin tone is fair and it was the right matched.&lt;br /&gt;Also found out that this product is also, not tested on ANIMALS.</li>
    <li> it works good, just smaller than what I expected.&lt;br /&gt;I ordered a shade whiter than should but it does it porpouse.</li>
    <li> Cheap and has a quality.</li>
    <li> I barely use this product, it&#x27;s used more for its mirror than the actual powder.  I&#x27;ve used it in situations where I forgot my powder at home, but sparingly because the color is a bit strange, doesn&#x27;t look bad on my Mac NW 25 skin but I can&#x27;t imagine a darker person using this.  Overall not bad for the money, and maybe only for light oil control.</li>
    <li> For the price and the quality I can not complain. Have been using Estee Lauder and Lancome for a long time ready to try something new for a change.</li>
    <li> I was buying this at my local Target store for $3. It really does wonders if you use liquid cover up because it makes it matte without changing the color BUT, it is SO SMALL. I get maybe a few weeks out of this if that.</li>
    <li> I like e.l.f. products and will continue to buy</li>
    <li> I bought this product at my local Wal-Mart for $3.00 based off of some Youtube videos I had watched and the lady&#x27;s really recommended this product for a nice matte finish and I was very satisfied with it. I think this a a terrific product and extremely affordable. I am a new fan of E.L.F product.</li>
