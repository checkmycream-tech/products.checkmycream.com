### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Battery Life - The best feature of this unit, works as advertised!!</li>
      <li>Push up mini-foil - Great feature!!</li>
      <li>/&gt;In conclusion, I have to give it 4 stars because it doesn&#x27;t tear my neck up, and I&#x27;m very happy about that.</li>
      <li>On the plus side, the cleaning/charging station works great.  </li>
      <li>Remington took a great 3-head shaver in the MS3 series and made a 2-1/4 head version in this model.  </li>
      <li>I have owned this shaver for about five months now, so I feel qualified to provide an experienced review.</li>
      <li>batteries are protected from over-charging, a very nice feature.  </li>
      <li>It also helps sanitize the screens and blades and lubricates the face with a pleasant smelling oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>If they&#x27;d pop a Panasonic Linear motor in, and made the screen and blades more durable, this thing would be ideal.</li>
      <li>I have to say that the battery life was good</li>
      <li>Shaver arrives in good timing.  </li>
      <li>good motor, no pulling or tugging.</li>
      <li>I first used this shaver, I was impressed with how well and how close of a shave I received.  </li>
      <li>I love it!</li>
      <li>Remington promptly and courteously replaced my unit under warranty.  </li>
      <li>This is handy when traveling.</li>
      <li>I also tried a nice Braun.</li>
      <li>However please note this is purely my own speculation.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Always keep the charging cord handy.</li>
      <li>This is handy when traveling.</li>
      <li>Contacted manufacter, they exchanged for brand new one, works great!  </li>
      <li>; cleaning solution leaves a soft, smooth, pleasant scent after shaving; cleaning system is actually effective and not a gimmick; superb customer support!     </li>
      <li>gave it 1 star because the shaver is good and works well when it is clean.</li>
      <li>When I buy a product, I do not care how great their customer service is, because I would hope to have bought a good enough product that I would not have to deal with them ever.  </li>
      <li>On top of this, the shaver heads (which cost $40) run out about every 3 months.</li>
      <li>I have had many foil shavers, including the Braun model with a cleaning system as well.</li>
      <li>When I called Remington to ask what I could do to make it work better, they decided a foil shaver wasn&#x27;t for me.  </li>
      <li>It is much better than the Braun Activator.</li>
      <li>Bought to save time from razor and spending more time with this.</li>
      <li>On top of that, the TRIMMER DOESN&#x27;T WORK.</li>
      <li>top</li>
      <li>a long-time Remington shaver user and have tried many of the models over the years.  </li>
      <li>There is also built-in reserve power in case you run out of power before you&#x27;re done shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: Very close and clean shave; cleaning solution leaves a soft, smooth, pleasant scent after shaving; cleaning system is actually effective and not a gimmick; superb customer support!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
      <li>I have loved the way it shaves,  but in the first three months the battery died.  </li>
      <li>Like many others I was a huge fan of the 3700 series shaver.  </li>
      <li>Mine lasts easily for 4-5 shaves after two years of use.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Lastly, the battery life is really strong.</li>
      <li>I took VERY good care of the razors, but it&#x27;s pretty clear to me that these are not well-manufactured.  </li>
      <li>Shaver works fine</li>
      <li>I exchanged it for a rotary at the store, and it works fine.  </li>
      <li>They cheerfully offered to exchange it for a rotary razor which they said would work fine.  </li>
      <li>The third blade is great for shaving around the nostrils.</li>
      <li>&quot; They provided the part for free and paid for the shipping, even after I told them I damaged the part.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>MS-5500 gives a comparable, GREAT, shave in only 4 minutes.</li>
      <li>and they apologized for the error, refunded my money, and sent one out immediately, free of charge.</li>
      <li>to people who complain about the cleaning system, you don&#x27;t have to use it--the shaver is washable and a light spray of shaver lubricant once a week is all that you need.</li>
      <li>A leather travel bag is included and a week or two without the cleaning system will be fine, but you will need to manually remove the screen assembly and use the brush to clean out the hair and debris that collects between the blades.</li>
      <li>Reviews prior to the purchase were excellent and it received high marks.  </li>
      <li>unique aspect of this shaver is the use of Titanium.</li>
      <li>When I would push the clean button, the solution sprayed all over my bathroom.  </li>
      <li>yes i did clean them after every shave</li>
      <li>Styling was attractive (compact and light - albeit flimsy compared to other brands in my opinion).  </li>
      <li>I am very impressed with this company for standing behind their product and for their fine customer service.</li>
      <li>Irrespective of other reviews, I bought this shaver to replace my Remington Intercept which has given me years and years of great shaves.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m lucky to get 15 minutes, 3 shaves at 5 minutes.</li>
      <li>I was impressed enough with it that I decided to grab this more expensive Remington MS-5500 because I liked the idea of not having to clean the thing by hand, or running it under the faucet every day.</li>
      <li>Yes, although this was great of the customer service, you should never have to go through this with a $100 shaver you have had less than a year.  </li>
      <li>Well, first, this thing vibrates like a mother!  </li>
      <li>To disassemble the foil from the unit to expose the blades was easy but putting it back took a bit more time to do</li>
      <li>a month, I noticed it was not cutting as close</li>
      <li>I buy six months worth at a time.</li>
      <li>The razor never performed as well as did the Remingtons of old, all of which were (then) made in the good old USA.</li>
      <li>trimmer is quite effective and one of the only features to stand the test of time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>The MS3-3700 has a useful \\&quot;turbo\\&quot; mode which increases the motor/blade speed, and I just leave it in this mode all the time.  </li>
      <li>I find this to be the least effective methods of cleaning (nice concept and in theory).  </li>
      <li>First, you can effectively use the razor without the cleaning unit, but I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it as a general form of usage.</li>
      <li>Add to that the extreme noise this thing puts out and not to good a shave you get</li>
      <li>Pros: Very close and clean shave</li>
      <li>I have a very soft, and fine beard.  </li>
      <li>Wow, that was easy.</li>
      <li>This is my very first electric shaver, it does the job very well.  </li>
      <li>you do purchase this razor, especially if this is the first electric razor you&#x27;ve owned, it will take a few weeks to determine the technique that works best for you.</li>
      <li>If you do purchase this razor, especially if this is the first electric razor you&#x27;ve owned, it will take a few weeks to determine the technique that works best for you.</li>
      <li>The shaver performs exactly like I thought it should.</li>
      <li>my first razor IS a Remington R 845.   </li>
      <li>a grand total of 280 dollars just to keep your shaver running.  </li>
      <li>Remington has replaced mine three times -- the first time, the trimmer stopped working.  </li>
      <li>, the motor of the MS-5500 seems to run slower than the MS3-3700, reducing the effectiveness of the shave as a result and requiring about 50% more time to achieve the same close shave.  </li>
      <li>and I completed the fluid once more.</li>
      <li>First of all it is noticeably quieter.</li>
      <li>I thought, \\&quot;Wow... what fantastic customer</li>
      <li>Many multiple passes required to shave everything.</li>
      <li>My first foil shaver.</li>
      <li>The cleaning heads started to fall apart after the first week of use.</li>
      <li>It holds a charge for a very long time, the cleaning system is fantastic, it gives a good shave, and finally the customer support is absolutely unbeatable.</li>
      <li>The power indicator was good although I really never depended upon it on a frequent basis (it was always being charged except for one 7 day trip).  </li>
      <li>I would have expected a more quiet operation, better shave and docking system.</li>
      <li>Other positive points include worldwide voltage compatibility, very quick recharge(60 minutes for full, 5 min for 1 shave) and a battery level</li>
      <li>the snazzy new self-cleaning feature of the MS-5500 looks useful, it&#x27;s utility</li>
      <li>Lastly, the battery life is really strong.</li>
      <li>I whole heartedly recommend this product and services.</li>
      <li>So, you really get a two-head shaver with a corresponding loss in shaving surface area.</li>
      <li>I am ready to toss it in the trash.</li>
      <li>Shaving gently will extend the life of your screens and blades.</li>
      <li>I used it in conjunction with the Remington FaceSaver, a powder pre-shave (also sold on Amazon), which really works well.</li>
      <li>I tried the Panasonic Linear system and that was much quieter.</li>
      <li>Remington customer service has always been very gracious about replacements, but I&#x27;m done with Remington.</li>
      <li>Thanks Amazon.</li>
      <li>/&gt;There is also a cutter attached to the razor that is really handyfor trimming around sideburns, moustache, beard, etc.</li>
      <li>It was truly as close as a real blade.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This company is very very horrible at contacting people about there products. I will never order from them again.</li>
    <li> It it were not such a problem to return it, I would.  Shaver works fine but the battery will not hold a charge. After having been plugged in for days, as  soon as you unplug it, it dies in less then 5 seconds.    I am thoroughly disappointed in this product but don&#x27;t want to go through the hassle of returning it.</li>
    <li> Disappointed in quality considering price tag. I would have expected a more quiet operation, better shave and docking system. Many multiple passes required to shave everything. Bought to save time from razor and spending more time with this. Wouldn&#x27;t mind if around the $30 range.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this shaver for a total of 10 months. I would rate the shave it gives as about average. It is not a bad shave by any means, but for the price it will not give you a better shave then some much less expensive razors. However the cleaning system does work extremely well, and once you use a razor with a system like this you will never go back to using one without it. I never even wanted a self cleaning system because I considered it a &#x27;gimmick&#x27; in order to make you as a customer have to frequently buy refills. However I was given this as a gift and so I reluctantly tried it and now I am definitely a believer. Other positive points include worldwide voltage compatibility, very quick recharge(60 minutes for full, 5 min for 1 shave) and a battery level indicator.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far it seems like a pretty average review, so why 5 stars? Let me tell you, about 2 weeks ago I had a problem with the razor involving the pop up trimmer not retracting, so I called up customer support for warranty service (this model comes with a 2 year warranty). I was on the phone for literally less then 1 minute before they told me just to ship it back and I would be sent an entirely new razor. Wow, that was easy. Very well, so I sent &#x27;just&#x27; the razor back for service, and a week later they sent me not only a razor but an entirely new retail package including cleaning/charging station and refill kit. This type of customer service is utterly first rate, and when a company stands behind thier product like this they deserve every bit of the 5 star rating I am giving them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will also note that the razor I received back from them actually works better then my original in a few ways. First of all it is noticeably quieter. Secondly the trimmer seems to work better then my old one ever did. I would venture to guess that perhaps they&#x27;ve made a few subttle improvements over the initial design over time. However please note this is purely my own speculation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall Ido highly recomed this shaver. It holds a charge for a very long time, the cleaning system is fantastic, it gives a good shave, and finally the customer support is absolutely unbeatable.</li>
    <li> I purchased this razor in December 2006.  The good news is that it shaves well -- the bad news is that it falls apart pretty quickly.  Remington has replaced mine three times -- the first time, the trimmer stopped working.  The second time, the cleaning base started spewing fluid all over.  The third time, the little clips that hold the head in place broke -- one broke OFF completely, and one disappeared into the body of the razor.  I took VERY good care of the razors, but it&#x27;s pretty clear to me that these are not well-manufactured.  Remington customer service has always been very gracious about replacements, but I&#x27;m done with Remington.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t disagree with any of the other reviews here, though I have so far been fortunate not to brake the screen, which I found easy to do with a previous titanium model.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, this thing is noisy, and it takes multiple passes. I tried the Panasonic Linear system and that was much quieter. I also tried a nice Braun. But they both kept tearing my neck up. I could choose either not have a close shave, or live with horrendous red marks for the next 4 hours if I did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I then tried the MS3-2700 by Remington and was pleasantly surprised. I used it in conjunction with the Remington FaceSaver, a powder pre-shave (also sold on Amazon), which really works well. Finally I had a system that didn&#x27;t tear up my neck. I was impressed enough with it that I decided to grab this more expensive Remington MS-5500 because I liked the idea of not having to clean the thing by hand, or running it under the faucet every day. (With the powder the MS3-2700 had to be cleaned all the time.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So the noise bothers me and it is not a perfect shave. But the cleaning solution works well, and adds a mild lubricant that enables the same shave as the MS3-2700 without having to use the FaceSaver powder. You have to replace the solution about every 3 weeks, but this is easier than having to run it under the faucet each day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, the cleaner does have a typical male cologne smell, and though it doesn&#x27;t bother much, I would prefer it to be odorless. I don&#x27;t really notice the smell on my face after shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In conclusion, I have to give it 4 stars because it doesn&#x27;t tear my neck up, and I&#x27;m very happy about that. If they&#x27;d pop a Panasonic Linear motor in, and made the screen and blades more durable, this thing would be ideal.</li>
    <li> From having to  replace the screens every 6 months, to fluid every month, this is an expensive shaver. Add to that the extreme noise this thing puts out and not to good a shave you get I am ready to toss it in the trash.</li>
    <li> I got this as a gift.  On the plus side, the cleaning/charging station works great.  Customer support was friendly, and seemed very knowledgable, and actually could speak English. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;On the downside, this thing sounds like a Mac truck.  You can forget a very early or very late shave while your wife is asleep.  It runs on and off in the cleaning station too, so plan your cleanings for during the day. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;This shaver did not work well at all for me.  I have a very soft, and fine beard.  When I called Remington to ask what I could do to make it work better, they decided a foil shaver wasn&#x27;t for me.  They cheerfully offered to exchange it for a rotary razor which they said would work fine.  I exchanged it for a rotary at the store, and it works fine.  So chalk one up for customer service. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The batteries are protected from over-charging, a very nice feature.  I had no splashing or mess from the cleaning station at all.  The travel bag is decent quality, and plenty roomy.</li>
    <li> good motor, no pulling or tugging. the cleaner deal though is unnecessary, just brush out the whiskers</li>
    <li> I only had the shaver a few months before starting to have problems with the cleaning base.  It started with a leak that would soak my sink.  Then after a while it got progressively worse.  When I would push the clean button, the solution sprayed all over my bathroom.  It sprayed several feet out!  When I opened the cleaning base, it was all rusted inside.  Mind you, I have had this product less than a year.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;After calling Remington Customer Service, they sent me a new cleaning base no questions asked.  Yes, although this was great of the customer service, you should never have to go through this with a $100 shaver you have had less than a year.  I am sure customer service was only so good about it, because they have been hearing the same thing from several other customers.  When I buy a product, I do not care how great their customer service is, because I would hope to have bought a good enough product that I would not have to deal with them ever.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I gave it 1 star because the shaver is good and works well when it is clean.</li>
    <li> I see that the last review on the MS-5500 is about a year old, so I thought I would add a new one.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a long-time Remington shaver user and have tried many of the models over the years.  To make a long story short, I would purchase the MS3-3700 (or similar MS3 models) over this newer version.  I used the MS3-3700 for two years, and then switched to the MS-5500 about four months ago.  I have enough experience now to recommend the right one for you. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Although the snazzy new self-cleaning feature of the MS-5500 looks useful, it&#x27;s utility does not outweigh the fact that this model just does not shave as well as the previous MS3 series.  The reason?  Remington took a great 3-head shaver in the MS3 series and made a 2-1/4 head version in this model.  They shortened the third screen and made it pop-up, reducing its usefulness to almost zero.  So, you really get a two-head shaver with a corresponding loss in shaving surface area. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;In addition, the motor of the MS-5500 seems to run slower than the MS3-3700, reducing the effectiveness of the shave as a result and requiring about 50% more time to achieve the same close shave.  The MS3-3700 has a useful \\&quot;turbo\\&quot; mode which increases the motor/blade speed, and I just leave it in this mode all the time.  The difference is noticeable. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Save your money and buy a MS3-3700, if you can still find them.  I have not had any problems with battery life, as mentioned in previous reviews.  Mine lasts easily for 4-5 shaves after two years of use.</li>
    <li> This is my very first electric shaver, it does the job very well.  I opt for an electric shaver due to bumps when regular razors are used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, today, the base system started to leak.  I wasted two refills trying to find out what was causing the leak.  I thought I failed to properly seal/close the base.  Until I read this review.  It seems like this is a known problem.  I sent an email to Remington to request for a replacement. I hope I get the replacement within a week :D&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDIT:&lt;br /&gt;I thought Remington was only going to send a cleaning base.  To my surprise, new complete system arrived 5-days after I send them an email.</li>
    <li> I bought into the \\&quot;Titanium\\&quot; hype of this model and have regretted it.  I think Remington was shooting for a performance shave and it is possible with this razor.  The reality is the foils are so thin they are not practical to maintain.  I&#x27;ve had an MS-5500 for a few months and I&#x27;m ordering my third set of foils already.  I ordered a MS3-3700 as an alternative and am happier with that model (though the battery does not perform as well as the MS-5500&#x27;s).  The MS-5500 is the loudest razor I have ever owned.  When I do use this unit, I go into another room in the house and close the door so I don&#x27;t disturb my wife.  I shave my head and face so I need to wear earplugs when I use this unit (not the case with the MS3-3700).  The bottom line for the MS-5500 is this... &lt;br /&gt;1) Noise - Horrendous!!  WHAT WERE THEY THINKING?!!!!! &lt;br /&gt;2) Foils - Too thin, while cleaning the unit when a brush hair gets caught in a foil hole most times the foil will be warped and you and your coworkers will know it by the fine scar lines left on your head and face. &lt;br /&gt;3) Battery Life - The best feature of this unit, works as advertised!! &lt;br /&gt;4) Push up mini-foil - Great feature!! Foil is as thin as larger foils, same warp problem which ruins the foil. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Remington needs to retool this product line and address the problems that hamper this unit from reaching its true potential.</li>
    <li> I have always purchased Remington&#x27;s for shaving and always will.  Like many others I was a huge fan of the 3700 series shaver.  I&#x27;ve never paid $90+ for a shaver before so I had great expectations, but sadly was very disappointed.  For some reason, this razor just plain ol doesn&#x27;t shave like the other Remingtons.  The most disappointing functions are the pop up trimmer and the pop up foil in that neither seem to actually cut.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;In fact, I tried the pop up trimmer on my hand just to see what the problem was and I swear it took 5+ passes to notice hair being cut.  I also found that it snags in thicker hair (around mustache and goattee).  So I actually just reordered the 3700 series again.  Older model, but it performs like a Remington at least.</li>
    <li> i bought the ms5500 last week on amazon. it is a peace of crap!! it was charged as directed before use, the charge lasted less than a minute, charged it again and the same results!! I have an older remington model i was replacing but will send this piece of garbage back and get a refund. Will try another brand... tired of replacing the screens and blades on remington shavers.. they do not last !!!! yes i did clean them after every shave but it did not matter..i give this shaver minus 5 stars!!!</li>
    <li> My wife got me this razor for christmas 2004.  I have loved the way it shaves,  but in the first three months the battery died.  It would accept a charge.  Remington promptly and courteously replaced my unit under warranty.  Over the last few months the charge has lasted less and less time.  This weekend, we went out of town and the razor was dead as a doorknob the first morning when I tried to turn it on.  This morning I plugged it in to charge it, it got too hot to touch and the display turned black.  I&#x27;m assuming that it is now deceased.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;While I love the way the razor works, I am very disappointed with the reliability, given the price.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had my razor with the cleaning station for a year now. The cleaning station failed in July, and they said they would replace it under warranty. They didn&#x27;t. So I called them. They said - and, yes, I have this right - that the cleaner base was such a trouble-prone device, they stopped selling it, and now only sell the razor alone. And, they told me, since they no longer make the cleaning base, they no longer honor the two-year warranty. This is akin to buying a 2010 Ford, and Ford disallows all claims once they start selling the 2011 model, because \\&quot;they don&#x27;t make that model anymore.\\&quot; Yes, I&#x27;m unhappy. The razor never performed as well as did the Remingtons of old, all of which were (then) made in the good old USA.</li>
    <li> This shaver replaces a Braun low end model. The shaver performs exactly like I thought it should. However, the cleaning system began to leak very badly after only 6 mos of use. I contacted the customer service department via email and told them about the problem. Apparently, they have had similar messages because they told me \\&quot; A new unit will be shipped to you as soon as possible\\&quot;. They didn&#x27;t ask me for anything. Not even the age of the unit. The new cleaning unit arrived a few days later and has been operating fine ever since. I am very impressed with this company for standing behind their product and for their fine customer service. I whole heartedly recommend this product and services.</li>
    <li> I chose this razor due to its self cleaning feature and guarantee to cut very close.  Reviews prior to the purchase were excellent and it received high marks.  Styling was attractive (compact and light - albeit flimsy compared to other brands in my opinion).  It had plastic chrome with a rubber feel wrap/trim.  To disassemble the foil from the unit to expose the blades was easy but putting it back took a bit more time to do correctly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The unit could be charged in a docking station or through a plug.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It comes with a case, foil cover and brush.  The power indicator was good although I really never depended upon it on a frequent basis (it was always being charged except for one 7 day trip).  I have to say that the battery life was good (lasting 7 days without a charge).  When the energy runs low, it doesn&#x27;t have enough juice like the Panasonic Linear that it replaced.  Operation is simple and the buttons are responsive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The trimmer is quite effective and one of the only features to stand the test of time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This was not a wet/dry shaver to my dismay (despite the &#x27;wet cleaning solution&#x27;).  You also had to be careful not to tip the base over or you would spill the solution on the vanity (not safe).  I was shocked at how loud the &#x27;cleaning process&#x27; was and how long it took (it must take 5-10 minutes which is excessive - and ineffective).  It also tended to drop beard clippings all over the place (sink, vanity and floor) - messy...messy thing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The case is big - a bit too big and the compartments are too confusing to see what goes where (the plug on one side and the shaver in the other?).  It is a bit bulky for a &#x27;travel&#x27; shaver, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THE HONEYMOON:&lt;br /&gt;When I first used this shaver, I was impressed with how well and how close of a shave I received.  It was truly as close as a real blade.  It was one of the noisiest shavers I have ever used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THE BATTLES:&lt;br /&gt;After a month, I noticed it was not cutting as close but I put up with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, despite the refilling of cleaning solutions and daily &#x27;cleaning&#x27;, I found that it was not cutting very close, at all, towards the 8-9 months of use.  I never bothered to replace the blades since I had used Norelco&#x27;s (2), 1 Braun and Panasonics (2 Linear) with no problems like this.  Was this a function of rapidly deteriorating blades or an ineffective cleaning system?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Given the price, I would have expected this to be a wet/dry shaver which limited its versatility (it was replacing a 2nd generation Panasonic Linear).  This was my 5th electric razor since I started shaving - and sadly one of the worst.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The &#x27;cleaning system&#x27; consists of a small filter and volatile/oily cleaning solution that needs to be replaced monthly.  Cleaning this unit is quite messy and I found that the blades still had lots of stubble despite cycling through a cleaning cycle.  I find this to be the least effective methods of cleaning (nice concept and in theory).  I hope this &#x27;fad of self contained cleaning solutions&#x27; fades away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;IN THE END:&lt;br /&gt;I even resorted to 2 months of using a disposable razor because of it.  However, after two months of using a disposable, I bought a Panasonic Arc Shaver, exclusively from Sharper Image (look in the near future for a review on this model).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SUMMARY:&lt;br /&gt;As for now, this shaver gets 2 thumbs up (out of 5 thumbs).  I do not recommend this unit, at all.  It is a poor value (for cost and maintenance) and a product of poor engineering.  The thing that really sold me at the beginning (in addition to such poorly earned stellar reviews) was the name (to which it did not live up to - Titanium).  It should have been named iron (to parallel rust) or silver (to parallel the tarnishing).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do not recommend a &#x27;self cleaning unit&#x27; that uses solution like this (especially, if you have pets or small children or careless cleaning ladies) from ANY manufacturer. Theeffectiveness of a close shave was short-lived.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOT RECOMMENDED.</li>
    <li> This razor cost me $99, and it&#x27;s a piece of junk. &lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s VERY NOISY, the foils are so thin that they have to be replaced a lot (and they&#x27;re expensive), and the cleaning solution needs to be replaced every few weeks (more wasted money). On top of that, the TRIMMER DOESN&#x27;T WORK. &lt;br /&gt;Whoever designed this razor for Remington should be FIRED! &lt;br /&gt;On the other hand, maybe it was poorly designed on purpose, so Remington could rake in the bucks -- between the high initial purchase price and all the money us suckers have to spend on new foils and cleaning solution... &lt;br /&gt;DON&#x27;T WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS ONE.</li>
    <li> Ok, this was only me second razor, so you might want to say \\&quot;You know nothing yet boy!\\&quot;    Ya, I would understand that, but it&#x27;s only my second because I have been using my first for almost a !DECADE! (27 now) and my first razor IS a Remington R 845.   And the battery still lasts for over a week.  So I said, DAMN I am gonna get another one of those.    I had seen a lot of adds for the self cleaning foil shavers and said, what the hell, $100 for half that time, nooo problem.    Well, first, this thing vibrates like a mother!  My hand is numb after using it.  And to top it off, sure, it does cut a bit closer, well, if you can call it cutting.  I call it YANKING it out.    After three months of trying to get used to it, I gave up and have gone back to my R 845 (now super glued in multiple places) and am looking for another razor.</li>
    <li> Shaver arrives in good timing.  Discovered the battery would not keep a charge.  Contacted manufacter, they exchanged for brand new one, works great!  I love it!</li>
    <li> Stay away from buying this shaver. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The cleaning system unit broke within a month.  Read a similar review of another buyer.  The toxic cleaning fluid leaked from the system and spilled all over onto the sink on numerous occasions.  The cleaning fluid is not cheap which you need to buy separately. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The care guide does not provide address for me to ship the defect cleaner.  I called the 800 number which took me a long time but was unable to connect. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The shaver itself cannot shave closely along my jaw line and leaves a stubble which I need to shave with my separate blade shaver.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;DON&#x27;T BUY THIS PRODUCT. &lt;br /&gt;</li>
    <li> After a few weeks of using and enjoying the Remington MS-5200 Titanium 700,I do recommend it.  I ordered one Wednesday and next Tuesday I received the parcel at home in Barcelona Spain.  Thanks Amazon.</li>
    <li> This shaver costs you about $10 per month for the cleaning solution.  On top of this, the shaver heads (which cost $40) run out about every 3 months. I almost killed myself while using the shaver as well because the heads actually popped off when they broke, exposing the blade.  Let&#x27;s do the math 10x12&#x3D;120, + 40x4&#x3D;160 &#x3D; a grand total of 280 dollars just to keep your shaver running.  I could buy a lot of shavers for that money, but frankly I&#x27;d rather buy sushi.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOT RECOMMENDED.</li>
    <li> Irrespective of other reviews, I bought this shaver to replace my Remington Intercept which has given me years and years of great shaves. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The MS-5500 gives a comparable, GREAT, shave in only 4 minutes. The third blade is great for shaving around the nostrils. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;For people used to a foil razor, this is a terific deal. It is much better than the Braun Activator. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;As to people who complain about the cleaning system, you don&#x27;t have to use it--the shaver is washable and a light spray of shaver lubricant once a week is all that you need. If you want to use the cleaning system, it is expensive but still cheaper than the comparable Braun system.</li>
    <li> My first foil shaver. I last had a Norelco rotary-type, after decades of cutting myself with blades. Even after replacing the heads in the Norelco, it performed weakly, missed a lot of whiskers, too slow. The Remington is way faster and closer, but much noisier, and the battery life stinks. They claimed 50 minutes of operation, I believe. I&#x27;m lucky to get 15 minutes, 3 shaves at 5 minutes. As soon as the charge indicator reaches 60% it dies and the reserve never worked. Always keep the charging cord handy.</li>
    <li> This is a rechargeable cordless razor with linear cutting heads. It has a popup trimmer and a popup small screen for tight places. I have owned this for four months. It is the worst electric razor I have ever owned because it is noisy, expensive to use, does a poor job shaving, and the cutting heads are already worn out after 4 months of use. &lt;br /&gt;The razor is noisy in use and even noisier in the cleaning mode. The cleaning mode lasts about 20 minutes and is loud enough to wake up other people in my house. It is expensive to use because you are supposed to use the proprietary cleaning solution. This will cost you ten dollars a month alone. The cleaning heads started to fall apart after the first week of use. The cutting discs on either end of the linear cutting heads fell off. The cutting heads after four months of use are so worn that the shaver is almost worthless. I blame this on the cleaning system which runs the shaver for about 20 minutes, or about ten times longer than I usually spend shaving. This makes it wear out ten times faster.  &lt;br /&gt;I have owned other Remington shavers, both linear microscreen and rotary, and they have been fine. Shame on Remington for releasing such a bad product.</li>
    <li> I have owned this shaver for about five months now, so I feel qualified to provide an experienced review. And, no, it&#x27;s not because my last name is Remington.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The unique aspect of this shaver is the use of Titanium. Titanium allows the screens to be made of a thinner physical construction, which results in a closer shave. The cleaning system increases the efficiency of shaving. It also helps sanitize the screens and blades and lubricates the face with a pleasant smelling oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;During the last five months I&#x27;ve learned how to work with the shaver and some do&#x27;s and don&#x27;ts. First, you can effectively use the razor without the cleaning unit, but I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it as a general form of usage. Going on a trip or traveling for business, no problem. A leather travel bag is included and a week or two without the cleaning system will be fine, but you will need to manually remove the screen assembly and use the brush to clean out the hair and debris that collects between the blades. Not doing this will diminish the quality of shave you get, over time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a test, I tried not using the cleaning system for a while just to see what benefit it provides. I found not using it increased the amount of time it took to shave because the blades clog with hair, skin, body oil, and debris. This required me to take the time to manually clean the blades every few days. I learned I could remove and tap the screen assembly in the sink and the loose hair would fall out. Also, with the screen assembly removed, I could tap the razor body on the edge of the sink and hair would fall from the blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bad idea... don&#x27;t do it! I broke a portion of the screen assembly. It looks like metal -- it&#x27;s not! Also, tapping the side of the razor body caused the smallest blade to dislodge and disappear down the drain. At that point, I decided this little experimental excursion was not worth the trouble. It became obvious that the cleaning station is a definite asset and time saver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This brings up something else to consider when deciding whether to purchase this razor or any Remington product: Customer Service. When I called about the head assembly, which they call a \\&quot;hair pocket,\\&quot; they immediately routed me to the proper department that handles non-standard parts. The individual took my name and address and said it will ship today. I asked if he wanted my Visa number and was told, \\&quot;Don&#x27;t worry about it; we&#x27;re sorry for the inconvenience.\\&quot; They provided the part for free and paid for the shipping, even after I told them I damaged the part.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only problem I had with this razor was with the cleaning system. The plastic fan blade that whisks the liquid around broke. I called and ordered another for $19.99. It never arrived, so I called again a few weeks later and they apologized for the error, refunded my money, and sent one out immediately, free of charge. I thought, \\&quot;Wow... what fantastic customer service!\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You will need to consider the expense of maintaining the razor. Cleaning solution can be purchased [...] They have the cheapest price I can find. I buy six months worth at a time. The solution should be changed every four weeks. Tip: Buy a cheap bottle of isopropyl alcohol and pour a little in the base once a week. A lot of alcohol evaporates, especially in the winter when the air is dry. You can stretch out the four-week interval to about six weeks by doing this. That way you use less product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Screens: Screens run $19.99 and they are delicate. Don&#x27;t press hard on your face when shaving. Shaving gently will extend the life of your screens and blades. They are very thin and will tear/wear. Screens last about four to six months, depending on your shaving habits.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Blades: I have not needed to replace the blades yet. I believe they recommend once a year and my guess is the blades will cost about $20.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is also a cutter attached to the razor that is really handyfor trimming around sideburns, moustache, beard, etc. Over time, the cutter will need to be replaced. Both the cutter and screens can be purchased together for $27.99.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lastly, the battery life is really strong. I used it for a week and didn&#x27;t need to recharge it. When you insert it into the cleaning system, it automatically plugs into a powered holder that charges it, so losing power is a non-issue. The AC adapter on the cleaning system unplugs from the system base and can be plugged directly into the shaver. This is handy when traveling. There is also built-in reserve power in case you run out of power before you&#x27;re done shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: Very close and clean shave; cleaning solution leaves a soft, smooth, pleasant scent after shaving; cleaning system is actually effective and not a gimmick; superb customer support!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: The shaver is quite loud; getting a good shave takes 5 to 10 minutes, depending on hair thickness and length; some of the parts are delicate so don&#x27;t do what I did and be less than gentle with them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you do purchase this razor, especially if this is the first electric razor you&#x27;ve owned, it will take a few weeks to determine the technique that works best for you. It may feel a little awkward at first, but after a few weeks, you&#x27;ll develop a technique that speeds your shaving time and increases the overall quality of shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall assessment: Recommended!cutter will need to be replaced.

    <li> I have had many foil shavers, including the Braun model with a cleaning system as well. This Remington definitely shaves closer than any other I know. Yet the cleaning system worked well for less than 60 days, being on every other day. &lt;br /&gt;At a certain time the low fluid light started to flash, and I completed the volume. A week later, it happened again and I decided to clean the base, replace fluid and filter &lt;br /&gt;Two days later the red LED started to flash again and I completed the fluid once more. This time I ran a cleaning cycle just to realize that, 30 seconds after starting, there was fluid all over the sink top &lt;br /&gt;A clear design flaw and I through the shaver away, since it would not worth the trouble repairing it</li>
