<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I use all 5 bags. I&#x27;ll explain how I use them. Other than telling you they are well made, which they are. But why buying 5 for free shipping is so great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. is for my everyday makeup I use.&lt;br /&gt;2. Is for makeup touch up items like lipstick, brush, toothbrush etc. I keep in my purse.&lt;br /&gt;3. Is my nail polish and manicure/pedicure items.&lt;br /&gt;4. Is for all my hair accessories like combs, elastics, barrettes, donuts, bobby pins, etc.&lt;br /&gt;5. Is my little medicine bag. Decongestant, my inhaler, Tylenol, Chapstick, a few band-aids, and a tiny antiseptic bottle, and ointment. I have 2 kids this bag goes everywhere in my purse and is always great to have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I sometimes think I want to order 5 more. I could find tons of other uses for these great bags. None are the same! So you will learn which bag is which by the material patterns of each bag. Can&#x27;t go wrong with these!</li>
    <li> this bag is extremely sturdy, you can tell is nice and durable. I didn&#x27;t care for the design i got but I was aware that it was a possibility I would get one I didn&#x27;t like. The bag is bigger than i expected which was definitely a plus, also the material is somewhat stretchy and the lining is fantastic. I&#x27;d definitely recommend this product. I use mine as a makeup bag :)</li>
    <li> So happy with this make-up bag, quality is excellent (bonus- MADE IN THE USA), shipped quickly and price is just as perfect too. I went to purchase more of these, they would make great gifts - but they were none available? PLEASE get more of these, I want to purchase quite a few.</li>
    <li> Love the size, the fabric and the price. I&#x27;m planning to buy a bunch of these to have on hand as last-minute gifts.</li>
    <li> This is a nice little bag.  I like surprises, so not getting to choose the fabric was fun.  They sent one in a very nice color/pattern.  I plan to order a couple more as gifts.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love the design on my bag as well as the colors and I will definitely buy again :).</li>
    <li> I have never reviewed anything on Amazon before, but I couldn&#x27;t keep quiet about these little bags. I was skeptical because of their low price but needed a smallish bag for some medical supplies, saw the good reviews and decided to give it a try. The bag is perfect! The outside is a fun, durable yet soft upholstery fabric (one that I would never have thought to pick out) and the inside is lined with a windbreaker-type nylon. The zipper is smooth and works well. The workmanship appears faultless. I want to order more.</li>
    <li> I ordered two cosmetic bags and received them in the mail today.  Not only were my items shipped very quickly, but I was also very satisfied with the quality of the cosmetic bags!!  They are the perfect size and are made well!!  I was worried about not being able to select the color of the bags, but was extremely happy with the two I received.  They are perfect!!</li>
    <li> I loved these little bags and wish I had ordered more! The fabrics are beautiful and high quality, and the finishing details are also excellent quality. I wish I had ordered the 5 and received the free shipping! They are a great size and hold a lot without being bulky, and the lining makes it possible to store cosmetics and toiletries without worrying they will be ruined.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These would make a great gift filled with travel-size toiletries or goodies and treats. I will definitely be ordering more. They are also a great value compared to similar items I have seen locally, and they were shipped and arrived quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love &#x27;em!!!!!</li>
    <li> Not really nice as i expect..i dont like the color and when i order it i cant choose a color</li>
    <li> Bag was great, but the print was not what I expected. Beware when you buy. You may get a print you dislike.</li>
    <li> Very cute little makeup bags.  Made in the USA and not China!  Good seller - fast shipping and fair price.</li>
    <li> The size is just perfect to fit in my purse.  One holds pens, calculater, date book and address book, one hold Tylenol etc and comb, lipstick and the like.  They&#x27;re durable, and well made and something I could not find at my local Target or drugstore.  I&#x27;m very pleased.</li>
    <li> LOve the flexibility on the material and some of the patterns  ..EH, other patters ad fabric too thin...don&#x27;t get me wrong i love my  pouches</li>
    <li> These are very nice bags.  They are well-made, and ideal for carrying make-up and other items in my work bag.  The seller is very nice and helpful.</li>
    <li> The bag is cute (I received a red one) but very thin. I wish it were lined but at the cost it&#x27;s a great product.</li>
    <li> Really good product, fast shipping - the colors vary but I love them all! I highly recommend if you need cute little bags for anything - look them up!</li>
    <li> I really loved this bag. Such a great buy for the price. Nice quality, great size for storing makeup and really pretty design. Would definitely buy it again.</li>
    <li> Great bag &amp; good for many uses. I just ordered another.</li>
    <li> very good for the price.Works well with my handbag and needs. Would buy more as presents.Would recommend for any one</li>
    <li> I purchased this bag quite a while ago, and it is still holding up!  The pattern was cute, and I am going to order another one soon.  Excellent for the price.</li>
    <li> This is a good little bag to put items like your lip balm, glasses, and cosmetics, so they don&#x27;t get lost all over your handbag. The material its made from is of good quality, like that which is used on upholstery. The inside is indeed lined with nylon which is supposed to make it waterproof. Its about the length of a new pencil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The company is the one who chooses the color to send you, so I emailed them to tell them I didn&#x27;t want a solid color, and they were quick to reply. They told me what they would be sending and ship the bag very fast. Good purchase!</li>
    <li> I was very happy with my purchase.  This quality of this make-up bag is excellent.  I was happy with the fabric that was chosen for the 2 bags that I purchased.  If I need more or would like to purchase some as gifts, I will likely purchase them from this company.  Thank you also for prompt shipping.</li>
    <li> perfect size and delightful variety of colors</li>
    <li> l like the quality of this bag, but of course they send me the ugliest one that&#x27;s not even shown in this picture! But in the end i don&#x27;t mind... its really a great bag!</li>
    <li> They sent me the color I asked for and I liked it. I&#x27;m planning to order more for myself and my sister. Thanks!</li>
    <li> Product delivered accordingly as promised. Bag was actually larger than anticipated and I admit I was excited about not knowing the design,  however,  I was also disappointed in the \\&quot;design\\&quot; I received. Part of not knowing, means that it probably isn&#x27;t worth returning either. My 6-year-old now uses it for her change and chapstick...</li>
    <li> I recieved these bags in the mail within just a few days and was impressed and totally happy with the quality and look of them. They have held up so well and are the perfect size for my make-up that I carry with me daily. It can hold 2 mascaras, 4-5 eyeliners, blush, and blush brush, foundation, powder, concealer, multiple chapsticks and lipsticks and an eyelash curler! So impressed and might just purchase a few more. A steal for the cost :)</li>
    <li> Make-up bags (or other uses) made in USA from recycled material. Zipper strong, seams strong &amp;neat, liners can be wiped out. Can&#x27;t pick material, but variety is really good &amp; varied. I had free shipping that was fast! These cases are very well made &amp; I recommend them highly. I am using as holiday gifts for my staff. Saving some for me, of cours!</li>
    <li> My bags are excellent quality, beautiful, were delivered promptly, and are made in the USA! I am extremely satisfied with the value I got for such a low price.</li>
    <li> I got the tan design and I love it. I don&#x27;t think the design is ugly and I also can fit my essential makeup in it.</li>
    <li> Love these!  They are sturdy and well made and can be used for all kind of things.  I have used them for the glovebox in each car for small things such as an extra pair of reading glasses, extra pair of sunglasses, small note paper, pen, etc.  Can be used for small electronics, make up, all kinds of things.  Would buy again!</li>
    <li> Great idea and handy bags for a great price. However, zipper seams don&#x27;t lay flat and curl up into the zipper when used.</li>
    <li> Very nice little makeup bag and for such a nice price. My design isn&#x27;t ugly at all, and it holds everything I need it to.  I would totally buy another one if the need ever arises.</li>
    <li> While I am very pleased at the speed of service and am always looking for a good product made in the USA I am disappointed in the fabric. My impression from the pictures in the ad was that the material would be fun and more modern. THe fabric used on my bag is quite ugly and I am considering sending it back. I would simply encourage anyone purchasing this bag to contact the seller and request a particular color/print to ensure satisfaction.</li>
    <li> Just your basic make up bag. Nothing fancy, but well made. I liked the idea of receiving a random fabric selection and love that they are made in Lowell, MA. Buy local!</li>
    <li> the bag is very pretty. Nicely made. zipper works great. Had a personal note from the lady n we I still like that. Had it a few weeks now. Would recommend. Great value. Good materials.</li>
    <li> I ordered 5 of these little bags. The seller does not give you a choice of fabric, but that is fine with me. The 5 I received are a variety of upholstery fabric designs (remnants). They are well sewn, with nylon fabric linings. I will use 1 or 2 of them to carry personal items in my fairly large shopper-style handbag (where small things tend to get buried). I purchased 5 for future use or to give as gifts. At $3.95 each, they are a real bargain! I also love that they are \\&quot;made in USA.\\&quot;</li>
    <li> I bought this bag because I was looking for a bag for makeup for my purse.  This bag was just too big.  Instead I use it for manicure products and it works great!  I would definitely purchase more for other purposes.</li>
    <li> Workmanship good. Material good. Would have liked for them to be a little larger for larger purses. Would recommend but would suggest, make sure to notice size.</li>
    <li> I purchased this bag for my knitting.  I use it for my needles, counter, measuring tape, etc.  It is perfect for my &amp;#34;stuff&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> I specified this was a gift for my bridesmaids as did another reviewer here and they mailed me only feminine bags in just a few days! it was very quick. They even left me a nice note congratulating me. My bridesmaids all liked the bags and put them to use immediately!</li>
    <li> and well made! I will be buying more in the future! I even got a color that I LOVE!!! Thanks so much!</li>
    <li> I knew I was taking a chance with not knowing what the item was going to look like but looking at the picture they all look pretty decent. I HATE the one I got. The quality is good for the price and I can&#x27;t give it a bad review because I knew I was taking a chance. If you are okay with that then I recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Girlfriend needed new bags. For the price - had plenty of choice &amp; she is very happy. Gave a couple to her daughters too.</li>
    <li> Bought 6 of these to put my bridesmaids gifts in. I contacted the seller w/a special request, to pick &#x27;cute, feminine ones&#x27; :) Didn&#x27;t want one out of the six girls stuck w/an ugly one!! Heard back right away asking me if I&#x27;d like any specific colors. They just arrived today and they&#x27;re all great!! See picture. Excited to fill them and give them to my girls.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love my bag!!!!  Exquisite material.</li>
    <li> Depends on your purpose for buying these. It is odd, isn&#x27; t it that you may not choose the designs or colors? The price is right though, correct?  Ahh, you get what you pay for.  I ended up pitching them in the trash.  No lining - they never said there was a lining, and I just simply did not like the colors or designs. So, depending on what you need them for, might be great, but being very visual - I wasted my money because for me, they were ugly. Dull colors, weird cordoroy material type stuff, 1970&#x27;s or 1980&#x27;s ugliness to them - not chic retro.</li>
    <li> Some of the other comments have stated that theirs didnt have linings. I have ordered 10 of these and all have great linings!  The fabrics are very durable and the zippers are great!  I Love Love Love these bags.  I keep one in my toiletry bag for all those little bottles of things and one on my vanity. I have found all sorts of uses for these wonderful bags!  I will also be giving away some for Christmas gifts. What girl wouldnt want a nice little bag? :)  The fact that you dont know what fabrics you will get are kinda fun. Most of mine have a nice purple lining, which just happens to be my favorite color.  :)</li>
    <li> Liked the bag... It&#x27;s a surprise the color you get... But they are nice and colorful...</li>
    <li> Just the fact that this product was made in the USA gives it 5 stars and then it from recyclable materials gives it 5 more stars in my book. It looks very nice and is just the right size unless you want to travel with it and have tons of makeup. For everyday use it does the job. Nice product all and all and I would recommend it.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t like they advertisied as they could pick your color out, I will next time buy one that I can pick my color out because the one that I received was ugly and the person I bought it for didn&#x27;t like it.</li>
    <li> This bag is as described and useful. I did not get a very attractive color/print, but it was clearly stated that it was their choice so I cannot complain about it. It was delivered quickly and trouble free.</li>
    <li> When I bought this Makeup Bag, I did not think it would be so roomy; there is sufficient room to keep two inhalers, a pill case as well as some light makeup.  The bag I received was red with a cute textile design.  Zipper has not malfunctioned; product works quite well.</li>
    <li> Just what I need to use for my makeup bag. Would&#x27;ve given an extra star to have been able to choose the design, even from a random pile, but otherwise happy with my purchase. Really needed something that would help keep my makeup in one place but not weigh down my choice of purse either. Zipper works, no fraying. If I happen to need more I will definitely buy more in the future!</li>
    <li> They are handy, sturdy, made in the US, and if you have no aesthetic opinions, you&#x27;ll love them. Just be prepare for fugly, though.</li>
    <li> These have a very natural, beautiful look and feel. You can fit a good amount in them but they are small enough to put in your backpack or purse.</li>
    <li> These bags are well-made and serve many purposes. I will probably buy more of them, they are well worth the money!</li>
    <li> For the past few months I have been looking for a make-up bag that has plenty of room without being a handbag itself and without having to spend $15-$20. I thought I was never going to find one until I looked on amazon.com. Plenty of selections, styles, colors and materials to choose from and when I saw these little beauties my search was over! I purchased five of them thinking that even if I could not pick the fabric at least one or two surely would be nice. All five of them are beautiful. I was going to give a few of them away, but I do believe I will keep them all for myself, and the &amp;#34;made in the U.S.A&amp;#34; is always a plus in my book.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks amazon.com</li>
    <li> Use this bag to tote my glad rags. Works well, discreet. Easy to clean. Definitely recommend. Could be a nice mini travel bag or makeup bag.</li>
