      <li>Using the best natural products for your skin is the way to go.  </li>
      <li>will mention it has more of an oil smell than a rose smell</li>
      <li>When I was growing up in Eastern Europe, rose hips were used for a refreshing tea.</li>
      <li>Rose hip oil contains pro-vitamin A (mostly Beta Carotene).</li>
      <li>The oil  is golden colored and is of great consistency and does not have a foul smell to it.</li>
      <li>This was my first time trying Rosehip Oil, I think this product is great for use at night.</li>
      <li>It has a very light smell, sort of like...</li>
      <li>Very smooth and healing.</li>
      <li>I found the organic rosehip oil to be very light and non-greasy</li>
      <li>I found that it was a very light oil, and that it was not greasy at all</li>
      <li>that good idea, was super oily the morning after BUT</li>
      <li>What amazing changes, my fine lines are not as noticeable.</li>

      <li>I definitely recommend this, it works wonderfully.</li>
      <li>Rosehip Oil also contains many vitamins and nutrients that provide anti-aging and anti-inflammatory benefits.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I have been mostly using on my stretch marks</li>
      <li>I have found that most rosehip oils I have seen are cold-pressed so that they keep all of their benefits.  </li>
      <li>So, I prefer to add a drop here or there - mainly in my favorite daytime</li>
      <li>This oil is FANTASTIC!</li>
      <li>I love</li>
      <li>This can help with acne and many more skin issues.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Ultimately it helped nourish and rehydrate my skin no matter how many times I used it, where I used it.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>Last year I used Valentia&#x27;s Vitamin C serum and found the best part was</li>
      <li>Interesting to note that rosehips were used as a dietary supplement during World War II because there was a shortage of citrus</li>
      <li>biggest improvement that I have noticed is a more even skin tone after using this product for about two weeks.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know why I bought this oil thinking I was going to be able to use it in my diffuser.</li>
      <li>Since I have been moisturizing my face with the rosehip oil, I noticed the smell for quite some time (more than one hour) after applying.</li>
      <li>: I got this product for testing purposes for free in exchange for an honest review and does not affect my opinion on it.</li>
      <li>My skin looks so much better, I can&#x27;t believe the results.</li>
      <li>I think the item description should be better explained.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I have been using this over a month now, and I can honestly say this has been working so great for me!!! I love this product I recommend it to my friends and family. This is great for your hair , nail, and skin. I have been mostly using on my stretch marks and it&#x27;s working they are getting lighter!!! My nails grow fast and my air feels good.  For your skin you have to use morning and night and let it soak in ur skin so it can benefit from this product. I love it will keep using this is my 3rd Oder I will be getting more I&#x27;m so addicted to this!!!!</li>
    <li> There are many different uses for this product. I decided to use it mainly to moisturize. I found that it was a very light oil, and that it was not greasy at all so it was able to absorb into my skin/hair quickly which i liked. I thought that it worked great to moisturize my hair, skin, and even nails! I used in on my hair by just warming up a bit of the oil in the microwave, and then smoothed it onto my hair. It really made my hair shine! I loved the effect that it gave. I used in on my skin to moisturize, simply by dropping a few drops onto my hands and then massaging it onto my skin. While researching this product, i found out that it can have great anti aging benefits and also can help with scars and acne! More on that later in this post. The final way i use this product is just to moisturize my cuticles/nails. All i do for this is drop a tiny bit onto my fingertips and then i just massaged it into each nail. It seemed to help my cuticles from being dry, and over time i hope it will help my nails become stronger and less likely to break!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another quick random thought: To me, it kinda smells like tea! The scent didnt bother me though, it isnt overpowering.</li>
    <li> I am pretty impressed with this product!! I have been using Valentia&#x27;s Rosehip oil for about 3 weeks now and i have noticed a significant difference! I have been using it as my moisturizer after washing my face and applying Hyaluronic Acid (which helps amplify the benifits of the Rosehip oil) and my skin is much softer and smoother and has a nice glow to it now. I have also noticed that it&#x27;s helping with my fine lines under my eyes. What i love most is that after i apply the Rosehip Oil my face isn&#x27;t greasey at all! It soaks in very quickly too which is great! I am very happy that i have added Valentia&#x27;s Rosehip Oil to my anti aging regimen!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a few weeks &amp; my skin feels amazing!! It absorbs well &amp; brightens my skin. People keep asking me if I have recently gone to a medical.spa for a fancy chemical peel and nope!! It&#x27;s this bottle of fabulousness!!! I will definitely be re ordering this product.</li>
    <li> I received the Valentia Rose Hip Oil free and for review.  I was surprised that it is actually an absorbable oil, in the sense that it goes on the skin as an oil, yet is absorbed evenly into the skin.  I did expect a nice rose scent, but it has hardly any to no scent at all.  I have used this on my hands which get extremely dry and cracked in the winter.  I have also used it on my elbows and other dry skin areas.  It provides relief as it keeps the skin hydrated and feeling subtle.  It also help the pain felt with dry cracking skin subside.  This is the perfect time of year for using tis with dry skin.  In the summer, I would like it try it in my hair after being out in the sun.  I am sure I will be just as pleased.</li>
    <li> Since it is winter and I&#x27;m in the house a lot my skin gets dry and flaky. I&#x27;ve used it on my face and hands so far and love the consistency of this oil. It is a rather amber color and has a natural scent to it with no flowery smell. The Valentia Organic Rosehip Oil penetrates deeply into my skin and doesn&#x27;t leave an oily residue on my face. I&#x27;ve used it for a few days and love how my facial skin feels replenished with a nice healthy glow. My hands feel softer and not rough or dry anymore either. I&#x27;m really happy with this product and plan on seeing more great results with other uses. I receive free product for review purposes.</li>
    <li> This was my first time trying Rosehip Oil, I think this product is great for use at night. It has many uses including anti aging, dry skin, scars, wrinkles, and hiper pigmented tissue.</li>
    <li> I have been using Valentia Skin Care’s Organic Rosehip Oil on my face for a few weeks now and I’ve come to really like it. I’ve tried their Even Glow Serum in the past and really loved it, so I had high hopes for their Rosehip Oil as well! Rosehip Oil is supposed to help with a lot of stuff including but not limited to improving fine lines and wrinkles, reducing the appearance of scars and burns, reduces sun damage, re-hydrating skin and evening skin tone and it also helps strengthen your hair and nails. I’ve been using this on my face in the evening, just a couple of drops! It moisturizes really well but doesn’t leave my skin oily and it doesn’t clog my pores, I haven’t had any issues with increasing white heads with this. It helps even my skin tone and my skin just looks plump and smooth after I use it. I don’t have any wrinkles or fine lines, so I’m not sure how it works on them. It has however lightened some of the scars on my jawline from the cystic acne I’ve been getting this past year, which is a relief for me. I definitely recommend this, it works wonderfully.</li>
    <li> I love Organic Rosehip oil 100% natural anti-aging serum. I&#x27;ve been using this serum for the past few weeks and i can honestly say that my skin feels so soft! I use this product once a day after cleaning my face. I will continue to use this product as part of my daily beauty routine.</li>
    <li> Really nice rosehip oil, good as a facial moisturizer. Great for eye makeup remover.</li>
    <li> Last year I used Valentia&#x27;s Vitamin C serum and found the best part was it&#x27;s addition of healing rosehip oil. It was really soothing and moisturizing so when they approached me to send a sample for review of their organic rosehip oil with Vitamin C and E I was happy to test it out. The bottle I received was very fresh and the oil, very concentrated with a golden color. If you smell it it has the faint scent of roses and the hips. It&#x27;s relatively viscous but you only need one or two drops to cover your entire face. I like to gently tap it into the skin and then apply sunblock and foundation on top for a flake free face all day. That&#x27;s a real feat when you&#x27;re on retinols and facing harsh winter winds with dry skin. This is really healing and soothing on the the lips and cuticles too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really love rosehip oil for how multi-purpose it is and love how this one is both organic and concentrated which it will probably last as long as 6 months. It&#x27;s made a huge difference to my skin without any signs of irritation ever.</li>
    <li> Wow!  This is a surberb top-quality product.  I have been using this for only 5 days, at night prior to bed and have already noticed a difference in my skin ... tone and texture.  Using the best natural products for your skin is the way to go.  No more &amp;#34;magical&amp;#34; creams that promise everything.  And, the personal touch and customer service was a pleasent surprise!  Thank you</li>
    <li> I think this works if you don&#x27;t mind the smell.  I do use it on my neck since I feel it makes my skin softer and younger looking.</li>
    <li> Organic Rosehip Oil by Valentia Skincare is made from rose hip seeds. This oil is made from organic rosa canina, commonly known as the dog rose, a variable climbing wild rose species native to Europe, northwest Africa and western Asia. Roses mature into a red orange fruit called a rose hip. When I was growing up in Eastern Europe, rose hips were used for a refreshing tea. Rose hip oil contains pro-vitamin A (mostly Beta Carotene). Rosehip Oil also contains many vitamins and nutrients that provide anti-aging and anti-inflammatory benefits.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rosehip Oil is a great natural treatment for the following skin conditions:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dermatitis&lt;br /&gt;Acne&lt;br /&gt;Eczema&lt;br /&gt;Mature skin&lt;br /&gt;Sunburned skin&lt;br /&gt;Brittle nails&lt;br /&gt;Wrinkles&lt;br /&gt;Scar healing&lt;br /&gt;Photo-aging reduction&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The rosehip oil comes in a dark amber bottle to preserve the qualities of the oil. Oils are sensitive to light and must be stored in dark bottles to prevent oxidation. Oils that are not stored in dark bottles will oxidize, lose potency and become ineffective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The rosehip oil is light to medium amber color. The oil feels very thick, but absorbs quickly. I was worried that the rosehip oil would be heavy on my skin, leaving it greasy, but it absorbed quickly because it is a &amp;#34;dry&amp;#34; oil. I have been using the rosehip oil daily to moisturize my face. The skin on my face immediately feels more supple and looks more moisturized. Dry skin has been a problem this winter and rosehip oil has helped to relieve the dryness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let&#x27;s talk about the smell. Rose hips themselves have a unique and prominent smell. Therefore, rosehip oil has the same prominent smell. The smell is not overpowering, but it does linger. Since I have been moisturizing my face with the rosehip oil, I noticed the smell for quite some time (more than one hour) after applying. To reduce the smell, I added about 10 drops of lavender essential oil. Any essential oil would be a great addition to the rosehip oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend Valentia Skin Care 100% organic Rosehip Oil. Rosehip Oil is a great natural treatment for skin conditions and a great daily anti-aging moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure: I received the product to facilitate this review.

    <li> I use this on my face every night and I&#x27;ve noticed that my skin is clearer. I love it!</li>
    <li> I was a bit disappointed in this product. I have no idea how Rose hips smell but this smelled very much like linseed oil. It is a light oil and does absorb with some rubbing, but I noticed no difference in my skin after using it daily for several weeks.</li>
    <li> I just started to use this product, I have already noticed a smoothness to my skin.&lt;br /&gt;The smell is a little earthy, but all is good!</li>
    <li> My skin soaked up this rosehip oil like a sponge soaking in water. I didn&#x27;t love the smell of it, but it dissipated quickly. It was nothing to worry about compared to the benefit. After a few days the difference was visible to me and other people. I used only the rosehip oil so the benefit could be experienced alone. The crows feet around my eyes began to minimize and the general health of my skin is better. It is clearer and more robust, and looks healthy and younger. It feels hydrated. Another benefit is that I don&#x27;t need any other moisturizer - this one application does it all.</li>
    <li> Not a great smell but so what! FABULOUS PRODUCT! Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Meets my expectations</li>
    <li> I love using rosehip oil in my moisturizer.</li>
    <li> Such high quality oil, I use it every day it just made such a huge difference in my skin and hair!</li>
    <li> Gives off a grate glow. Smooth clear skin&lt;br /&gt; A little goes a long way. Apply to face and neck</li>
    <li> Was looking for a product that would help fade the acne scars on my face. I have noticed the difference by just using this product for over a month. I added this product to my daily routine, I apply it the mornings and then again in the evenings after removing my makeup and washing my face. I will continue to purchase this product in the future.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this product so far. It leaves my skin moisturized and with glow. Its a must to have and to save your bucks.</li>
    <li> This product is really great! I am very satisfied with this purchase. My husband and I really love it. I bought 2 bottles and am going to buy one more. It makes my skin really healthy.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff! I&#x27;ve been using it on my stretch marks and it had made a huge difference. I also use it in my face a few times a week when it feels a little dry. Definitely love this stuff paired with the serum!</li>
    <li> I really love this product because I feel like in the long run it will be beneficial, but I give it 3 stars because it seems like it will take awhile to see actual improvement in the skin discoloration, tone, and texture</li>
    <li> I have been using the Valentia Organic Rosehip Oil for many reasons, and because of this dry weather, I have been getting more irritation on my legs after shaving.  I decided to use the Valentia Organic Rosehip Oil all over my legs, and the irritation subsided instantly after application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Valentia Organic Rosehip Oil is an orange/brownish color, with a distinct scent.  Even though I am not a fan of the scent, I have also been using it on my face right after I cleanse.  One drop is all I need for my entire face.  I have also been using it as an overnight treatment by massaging 2 drops before bed.  When I wake up in the morning, my face does not get itchy nor feel dry at all, but feels very moisturized.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another trick I have been doing with this is mixing one drop with my favorite moisturizer and mixing them both and then applying the mixture on my face, and that has definitely given me maximum benefits.  I have noticed brighter-looking skin, as well as less discoloration around my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Valentia Organic Rosehip Oil has definitely helped me with replacing moisture all over my skin, and not just on my face.  It is not greasy, and does not leave an oily residue after it&#x27;s been absorbed.  I highly recommend this for it&#x27;s many benefits to the skin.</li>
    <li> I like the product, waiting to see benefits, but skin seems to be much more hydrated then normal.</li>
    <li> Rosehip oil is quickly becoming one of my favorite facial moisturizers. It adds just the right amount of moisturization without being greasy. It really absorbs so quickly and easily into your skin. It can be used along or mixed with your favorite daytime and/or nighttime moisturizer. Best of all, a little goes a very long way. So even though the bottle may only be 1 - 2 ounces, it will easily last you 4-5 months if you’re just using a drop or two at a time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have oily skin, so I find that if I use too much Rosehip oil or use it alone, my skin seems to be really oily by the end of the day. So, I prefer to add a drop here or there - mainly in my favorite daytime moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I find that this Rosehip oil even works great on hair. I add just a few drops to the palm of my hand and then rubbed it on my ends. It made my hair feel really soft and added a little shine. It can also be used as a hot oil treatment, which I plan to dry next. It’s always promoted as a skin care miracle product, but it’s just as helpful for your hair! I received this product complimentary in exchange for my honest, unbiased review. All opinions are 100% mine.</li>
    <li> Like many other reviews, the smell is a bit strong, but it does make the skin under my eyes appear lighter and smoother. Just be sure to hold your breath.</li>
    <li> I received this for a review and I liked it a lot.  I drink rosehip tea all the time so I was worried it might be itchy since rosehips can be irritating but it wasn&#x27;t.  It soaked right in and it felt as moisturizing as when I use my coconut oil right out of the shower.  I also used it on my elbows as during winter they become very dry even with my coconut oil.  Using this and then adding the C.O. seemed to be the trick I needed for getting rid of the alligator skin elbows.</li>
    <li> I use this on my face after I use my Derma needle. It smells amazing and has no irritating vitamins or acid based ingredients. Very smooth and healing.</li>
    <li> Good product. I have scars from my teenager years due to acne, and this product actually is reducing the effects of all those years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sincerely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sonia Millere</li>
    <li> My skin looks amazing thanks to this. Apply every night with my moisturizer. My skin looks so much better, I can&#x27;t believe the results.</li>
    <li> I never thought I&#x27;d be applying oil onto my face in order to improve it! I was a little hesitant to use this Organic Rosehip Oil, which is a 100% Natural Anti-Aging Facial Treatment with Vitamin C + A from Valentia Skin Care, but I&#x27;m very happy with my results!&lt;br /&gt;I have these two little pock marks on my jaw from when I had Chicken Pox as a kid that I&#x27;ve always been a little self conscious of, so when I heard that this Rosehip Oil could help &amp;#34;heal and improve scar tissue&amp;#34;, I knew the first test I&#x27;d put it through. After washing my face in the morning and evening, I applied the Rosehip Oil (still so weird saying that) all over my face while it was still a little damp. After about two weeks I realized my scars were much less noticeable which I love!&lt;br /&gt;Not only did my Chicken Pox scars fade, but my skin tone has evened out as well. I wouldn&#x27;t say I have bad skin, but it&#x27;s troublesome enough, and with all the hormones from pregnancy and postpartum, this Organic Rosehip Oil has helped brighten and smooth my facial skin.&lt;br /&gt;Another way I used this Organic Rosehip Oil from Valentia was for my dry winter feet! Before bed, I warmed up some big fluffy socks in my drier while applying a few drops of of the Rosehip Oil to each foot and rubbed it in. After the oil was massaged in, I put my warm socks on and went to bed. When I woke up in the morning, my feet felt super hydrated and my toenails looked really healthy! This is definitely something I&#x27;ll do a few times a month during these cold and dry winter months to maintain my now gorgeous looking tootsies.&lt;br /&gt;I also used the Oil on my split ends and was surprised at how little I needed. It was very similar to the Moroccan Oil I&#x27;ve used in the past, with how fast I noticed it was moisturizing, and I liked that it didn&#x27;t leave a lingering scent.&lt;br /&gt;I eceived the product mentioned above for free. Regardless, my opinions are my own.</li>
    <li> Organic Rosehip Oil is a natural moisturizer composed by essential fatty acids, antioxidants and vitamins, which makes it a powerful skin regenerator. Highly recommended as natural remedy , the continious use smooths, improves, prevents and tones wrinkles, dark spots, uneven skin tone, eczema, psoriasis, dry skin, sun burns, insect bites, stretch marks and more. Leaves no oily residue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am so glad that I had the opportunity to review this product. I have used it for a few weeks now and can really tell a big difference in how my face looks and feels. My wrinkles don&#x27;t seem so vivid and I have a few dark spots on my face and hands and they have faded some. I will definitely purchase this in the future.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t dabbled much in Rosehip Oil before, but I have been an avid collector of Rosehips in the past. This is a PERFECT formulation and works exactly as described. I look years younger and sometimes have to do a double take in the mirror!</li>
    <li> Not greasy, great multiple use product.  Works well on hair, face, nails/cuticles.  Seems to help even out my skin tone too, it&#x27;s great.  Love the dropper on this as well, helps to easily apply the product and get just the right amount.</li>
    <li> Valentia Skin Care offers the best of the best products. I own their Even Glow Serum and fell in love with it because it did wonders with my face and now they have come out with this Rosehip oil which is amazing in rejuvenating your skin and making it appear more youthful! I have been using this oil for a month now and I can honestly say that I am pretty pleased with the results. My face has a certain glow to it and not one that is greasy either. The oil absorbs quickly into your skin and moisturizes it to the point that it feels much softer. I use this oil at night and wake up with a hydrated face. I also use it as a cuticle oil and apply it to dry patches on my skin and so far so good. This particular Rosehip oil contains 100% organic Rosa Canina (Rosehip) Seed oil and is rich in vitamins A and C, antioxidants and essential fatty acids and is known to correct dark spots and hydrate dry, itchy, skin while also reducing the appearance of scars, fine lines and wrinkles. The oil  is golden colored and is of great consistency and does not have a foul smell to it. It goes on evenly and with consistent use helps even out your skin tone. I love this formula and I am certain that you will too!</li>
    <li> I love love love this product!! The high quality and great product were amazing!! I use it for facial scrubs and the oil is pure gold!! I can&#x27;t say enough about how surprised I was in how the quality surpasses anything can imagine getting. You will NOT be disappointed if you order from this company!! Really and truly!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am an average person who happens to be extremely passionate about Tom, My Kids, and life in general.

    <li> Absorbed quickly into the skin and left it feeling very moisturized.  The scent wan&#x27;t very strong when I first opened the bottle, but it seems to have gotten much stronger.  The scent fades quickly on the skin though!</li>
    <li> Received In 2 days, good quality .</li>
    <li> The seller sent me a sample of this oil to test for my fashion and beauty blog. I love this stuff! I use it at night after I apply my face serum. I put three drops into the palm of my hand, rub my hands together and smooth the oil over my face. It doesn&#x27;t clog my pores and does not leave my skin greasy. If you find a good night serum to use along with this your skin&#x27;s texture will improve in appearance. Since using it I&#x27;ve had friends compliment me on how good my skin looks. I don&#x27;t recommend using too much oil 2 to 4 drops should do it.  I have a large face and 3 drops do me just fine.</li>
    <li> Gotta admit that when I first tried it I noticed it strong smell, I don’t like it to be honest, smells kinda weird.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Leaving that aside I decided to give it a shot. I have oily skin, I tried it on my face, not that good idea, was super oily the morning after BUT then&lt;br /&gt;I remembered reading that it nourished your nails and cuticles to prevent hangnails and breakage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This intrigued me, I was like let’s give thaaat a shot! I have super fragile nails, they always break, which is really sad. In my case I like long nails so I had nothing to lose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Long story short, this actually works!!! Not on my face, but I could see a great improvement on my nails health and look. They don’t break that much and my cuticles have never looked any better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I’m using it on my hair also and it seems to help too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will keep this on my side always!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please give this a try, maybe it wont work on you face like in my case, but made a huge change on my nails and hair. I don’t regret it at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;** Disclosure: I got this product for testing purposes for free in exchange for an honest review and does not affect my opinion on it.</li>
    <li> Awesome product! Doesn&#x27;t leave my face feeling oily and has helped with the redness in my face.</li>
    <li> It sounds like it would be a part of the flower, but it&#x27;s not.  It has a fragrance all it&#x27;s own and is great for so many things.  I love the fragrance, and it is so light and fresh on your skin.  It is packed with antioxidants and works for a lot of skin issues including discoloration, and it absorbs quickly and easily.  Also works as a great moisturizer for your skin and contains plumpers to give your skin that wonderful healthy glow.  This can help with acne and many more skin issues.  It contains Vitamin C and Lycopene, both of which are superb ingredients for your skin. I am in love with Rosehip oil and the wonderful fresh feeling it gives your skin, and the benefits.  This product comes with a dropper so that you can take just a few drops which is really all you need to use this oil.  It goes on smooth and absorbs pretty quickly - I didn&#x27;t find that it had a residue and it didn&#x27;t leave an oily feeling on my skin which was great - I have enough oil on my face normally.  And you get 1.18 oz so it will last you a long time.  I have found that most rosehip oils I have seen are cold-pressed so that they keep all of their benefits.  I received a complimentary product to test.</li>
    <li> Could not get past the smell!</li>
    <li> After one week of using the Valentia Organic Rosehip Oil I see a huge difference! I had a couple of pimples on the side of my mouth around my laugh lines, and they reduced in size. I wish I took a picture to show you, but I didn’t I just hope you trust me enough to believe me. I’m so serious about this because I’m so impressed that the Valentia Organic Rosehip Oil worked! I still have some brown spots due to acne scarring, but I’m super happy that the pimples are not noticeable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also love that each morning I wake up my skin looks rejuvenated, and feels supple. Of course this is also used with a Vitamin C Serum, but the only parts of my face I use Valentia Organic Rosehip Oil is on my acne scars that are around my cheeks, mouth area, and I also like using it on my forehead because I have a couple of dry patches. I haven’t experienced additional breakouts while using Valentia’s Organic Rosehip Oil, and I really love that!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing I would like to see changed about the Valentia Organic Rosehip Oil is the scent. I know it’s an oil, but I think a feminine natural/organic fragrance would be great, but I completely understand that it may ruin it’s purpose if a fragrance is added.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Valentia Organic Rosehip Oil is one of the skin care items I can’t live without now, and I think you are going to love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure: I received the Valentia Organic Rosehip Oil for review purposes. However the opinions expressed are honest and my own.</li>
    <li> This oil is FANTASTIC! You can use it on your face, in your hair, on your nails... Wherever it is needed! It has a very light smell, sort of like...tea, I&#x27;d say. I&#x27;ve tried other rose hip oil formula&#x27;s, and I&#x27;ve noticed that I come back just REEKING of roses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That is the LAST thing I want. When I&#x27;m doing my beauty regimen, I want my product to have a light smell. This smells like they didn&#x27;t add extra fragrance. It absorbs very quickly, and moisturizes really well. I put it on and within a minute or two, it has absorbed. Usually even less!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Everything in this oil will help fade scars, and wrinkles. I think I&#x27;m already seeing results but I might not be all that objective. ;) I received this for testing purposes but I&#x27;m in love.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks Valentia! I&#x27;m so glad to have a Rosehip Oil that doesn&#x27;t make me feel like I need to be hosed off after I put it on!</li>
    <li> **I received this product in return for an honest review. All opinions are my own**&lt;br /&gt;  I have just recently started trying out various oils as part of my beauty routine, since before I used to think that oils would make my face oilier. How wrong I was! This oil is wonderful and has SO many uses and a little goes a long way. I apply a couple of drops to my face both in the morning and at night and I have started to notice a difference. My combination skin looks healthier and has more of a lovely glow. The oil isn&#x27;t heavy and doesn&#x27;t have an overpowering smell. It absorbs quickly so when I apply it in the morning, I don&#x27;t have to worry about it ruining my makeup. I have also used it as well on my feet since winter is never very kind to my feet. I apply a few drops and working them into my feet and then place socks on my feet and go. My feet are much smoother and softer! My hands also suffer a lot during the winter months so my cuticles look like a disaster. I have been moisturizing them with this and it is working wonders and even my husband has been using it on a few dry patches on his skin. I am really pleased with this product and I look forward to seeing the results after I have finished the bottle.</li>
    <li> followed the directions for the oil and applied this at night just before going to bed. It has a pleasant odor and absorbed very quickly into my skin. I also liked the fact that it really does only take a few drops to completely cover your face. I found the organic rosehip oil to be very light and non-greasy which was a plus because I still suffer from break outs from time to time. I was worried that it might cause my skin to break out but this didn’t happen. I loved how soft and smooth my skin felt every morning after using this product! I haven’t had to deal with itchy, dry, scaly skin during the day either. My skin seems to stay soft and moisturized all day long which is a wonderful feeling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The biggest improvement that I have noticed is a more even skin tone after using this product for about two weeks. I have some mild acne scars and some uneven areas on my face and this oil has actually improved that! I am very impressed with my results so far and will continue to use this oil for months to come. If you’re looking for a quick and easy way to relieve dry skin and improve the way your skin looks and feels, give Valentia Organic Rosehip Oil a try.</li>
    <li> There is tons of vitamin C &amp; A in the oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I mainly used it on my on my cuticles which made them super soft and helped for them not to get hangnails and tear off which happened alot when I work in healthcare and the continuous amounts of me washing my hands really takes a toll of my hands.&lt;br /&gt;You may also use this on your hair as well to help bring life back to your hair, reduce the brittleness of it and increase utter smoothness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is also great for wrinkles, the antioxidants in it help diminish the early signs of aging and help reduce what you may already have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also did use this on my scar that I got ages ago just below my knee from a car accident at 16yrs old, this not only softened the skin their but helped get rid of the dryness of it, especially during the winter. It also kind of helped change the color to a white more then the redness that it&#x27;s always been.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ultimately it helped nourish and rehydrate my skin no matter how many times I used it, where I used it.&lt;br /&gt;I will mention it has more of an oil smell than a rose smell but once you rub it into your skin you really won&#x27;t notice.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m slightly confused. The picture of this Bottle says it is Rosehip Oil with Vitamin C and A. I specifically bought it because of the A. I noticed on some reviewers pictures that the bottle would say either with Vitamin C and A...OR... With Vitamin C and E. I received the vitamin E bottle. What&#x27;s up with that? Seems fishy.</li>
    <li> I reviewed this oil recently. My package arrived on time and in perfect condition.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I loved this oil because I have a lot of scars and it works great at fading them. I have been using this product for weeks now and have seen my scars turn shades lighter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very happy with my results as well as the pleasant scent of the oil itself. I would recommend this oil to anyone with scars they would like lightened.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You just rub a small amount of oil into the scars a couple times a day and you will start to see a difference. There are other uses for this oil as well such as reducing fine lines and wrinkles, rehydrating skin, evening skin tone, and strenghtening nails and hair.</li>
    <li> I am in the process of using the rosehip oil on my hands to heal my skin from burns caused from cleaning hot peppers nothing else has helped for the last 6 months and now they are healing I&#x27;m impressed. The cracks are healing and the skin is pink, softer and not tingley. I also use it on my face and am trying it on spider veins.</li>
    <li> I never knew roses actually made stuff that was good for skin! I received a bottle of Valentia Rosehip Oil to review and it has come in handy for keeping my hands moisturized against the cold winter temperatures we have had. I can&#x27;t imagine what it must be like for those that have been hit with one snowstorm after another! The cold and wind combine to torture skin.&lt;br /&gt;I have seen it mentioned that rosehip oil had an odor so I was a little apprehensive about that. This does have a slight scent and I don&#x27;t advise taking a big sniff of the open bottle. BUT, it takes so very little when I massage it into my hands that the odor is scant and actually dissipates pretty quickly.&lt;br /&gt;I bet getting roses brightens your day! This can brighten and rejuvenate your skin. Rosehip Oil is derived from a species of rose called &amp;#34;Rosa rubiginosa&amp;#34;. Rosehip oil is packed with antioxidants, fatty oils and other anti-aging ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;It contains a derivative of vitamin A that invigorates and regenerates skin, firming it as well as fighting fine lines. It also helps treat sun-damaged skin by lightening it. Rosehips also contain C, E, B and K. They also contain citric acid, flavonoids, fatty oils, tannin, pectin, and more vitamin C than citrus fruits. Interesting to note that rosehips were used as a dietary supplement during World War II because there was a shortage of citrus fruits.&lt;br /&gt;You skin needs lipids to form and sustain membranes and to prevent transepidermal water loss. Rosehip oil is a natural lipid as all oils are. It helps with the flexibility and permeability of skin and helps keep necessary moisture in and harmful bacteria out.&lt;br /&gt;Rosehip oils retains a higher amount of its natural antioxident Vitamin C after processing than other essential oils. The healing properties are often used to minimize scars and treat skin conditions such as eczema and burns. It has also been used for rheumatoid arthritis, urinary bladder infections and headaches.&lt;br /&gt;It takes only a few drops for each of my hands to be fully moisturized so this 1.8 ounce bottle will have some lasting power. It offers you great control with a dropper dispenser so you can use as little or and much as you like. I like how it makes my skin softer, absorbs quickly and doesn&#x27;t leave my skin greasy.nly a few drops for each of my hands to be fully moisturized so this 1.8 ounce bottle will have some lasting power.

    <li> A nice anti-aging serum treatment that deeply hydrated my skin. It was easy to use and my skin felt soft and smooth. I was provided with a free sample for review courtesy of Tomoson and Valentia.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know why I bought this oil thinking I was going to be able to use it in my diffuser. I think the item description should be better explained. It smells like vegetable oil and I would never put it in my diffuser. I did not return it because I did not want to go to the hassled but I&#x27;m sorry I bought it.</li>
    <li> I really like valentia products and use quite a few of them. They all are great and this too is none less.&lt;br /&gt;I love their sweet little packing and bottle. The packaging is good and the dropper style is particularly handy as it makes application easy and less messy.&lt;br /&gt;This product reduces fine lines and wrinkles, it helps is removing scars. It even the skin tone and also helps in removing burns marks.&lt;br /&gt;A very good product. Only wish it was a little bigger in size. But it does the job well. I was lucky to receive this product under promotion but my opinions are unbiased.</li>
    <li> Gave me a rash and smelled weird.</li>
    <li> My face has never looked better.  I am on week two of using about 4 drops in the evening.  What amazing changes, my fine lines are not as noticeable.</li>
    <li> I was excited to review this oil for a number of reasons.  Firstly,  I reviewed the Valentia Even Glow Vitamin C Serum &amp; really loved the product.  It worked very well and smelled amazing, so I was excited to try a different product from a brand I had such good of an experience with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Secondly, I have very dry skin and the last time I was at Sephora the consultant recommend that I try an oil to moisturize my face, or in addition to my regular moisturizer. I was excited to get to try this. This Valentia Organic Rosehip Oil didn&#x27;t clog my pores or leave my skin looking greasy.  It gave me a healthy glow and made my skin moisturized.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Rosehip Oil comes in a sturdy glass bottle &amp; is applied with a dripper so you can use as much or as little as you need.  I use about 3 drops after serum, but before my nighttime moisturizer.  If it were summer I would probably only use this oil, but my skin really needs layers of protection right now.  The oil is yellow and has an earthy scent. It absorbs very quickly into the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another trick I learned is to add a drop of oil to your foundation.  It will add a little moisturizer &amp; leave you with a subtle glow without breaking your makeup down!  This also saves a step in the morning when you are in a rush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This oil claims to reduce lines, wrinkles, scars, as well as evens skintone and rehydrates the skin.  I definitely feel this has helped my face so far this winter.  It doesn&#x27;t seem as dry or flaky.  My skin will actually get chapped &amp; bleed and so far none of that.  I have really been making sure I use moisturizer/oil day &amp; night to help my skin.  Very pleased with it&#x27;s condition.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have never tried a facial oil this would be an nice product &amp; an economical oil to start with (the oil at Sephora was $50 &amp; you didn&#x27;t get much more! I would have loved to purchase it but it wasn&#x27;t in my beauty budget at that time).  Overall I&#x27;ve been very happy with this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;#sponsored For more product reviews go to my blog SurveysByStephanie.tumblr.comg SurveysByStephanie.tumblr.com</li>
    <li> I was excited when I was asked to review this product because I had heard it does wonders on scars. I recently had wrist surgery and had 3 small incisions. I knew that I wanted the scars to not be too visible. I have been using this product for about 1 week and a half and love the results. I use 1 drop on each incision and rub it it daily. The oil absorbs quickly without leaving a greasy or tacky residue. It does have a strong scent but that&#x27;s just rose hip for you. What I do is after the oil has absorbed I put lotion on my hands and the scent is gone.</li>
    <li> I use this product as my nightly routine along with my other moisturizers.  I put a few drops (3-4) on my fingers and blend into my face paying close attention to under my eyes, and other fine lines on my face.  Then I apply my other nightly moisturizers on top.  In the morning my face feels so smooth and fresh looking.  Just those 3 to 4 drops really goes a long way.  It feels light, and is quickly absorbed into the skin giving it the hydration that it needs</li>
    <li> really loving this stuff.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s okay just super oily . Smells like fish oil . I probably won&#x27;t order it again . It didn&#x27;t do a dramatic change in my face</li>
