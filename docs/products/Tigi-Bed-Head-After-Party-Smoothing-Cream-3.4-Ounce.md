      <li>I use just a dime size on my finger tips ( I have short hair but a little goes a long way) and mostly first rub in on my ends and work towards the roots.</li>

    <li> This is my favorite hair product! You only need a little and so it lasts forever. A small amount works through my medium long (but somewhat thin) hair and it works great! It seems to just make my hair look healthier and fall into place somehow. Wouldn&#x27;t be without it and my Chi.</li>
    <li> Great hair product, my daughter has this on her wish list for the holidays.  Good price and prompt delivery.</li>
    <li> Love this product! Price is awesome!</li>
    <li> Awesome price and received my order in lightning speed!</li>
    <li> This is a great product if you have straight/wavy hair and are looking to eliminate frizz and flyaways. Smooth it onto your hair before or after flat ironing, like i do, and you get a great shine as well! Theres no alcohol in it, which PREVENTS damage to your hair. (alcohol dries out your hair and in humid air causes static) Its very lightweight, not oily or greasy at all which is why i love it. On the plus side its got a great smell! Dont judge the product by its cover its a fantastic hair product!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not high end or upscale but I love how it smooths my hair out and takes that little bit of frizziness out without being too weighty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the spray version too.</li>
    <li> Feels heavy on my hair. I used it only a few times and had to get another product.</li>
    <li> stuff works great to give the bed head look. Just need a dab and it goes a long way.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a long time...and love it! Makes my hair feeling soft and smooth. Gets rid of frizzy hair and smells good too! I use it after I blow dry my hair and it works great even on days I don&#x27;t wash my hair. Totally recommend this product! Try it, you won&#x27;t be disappointed :)</li>
    <li> I use this product before I blow out my hair as it protects your hair from the dryness the blow dryer creates. I use just a dime size on my finger tips ( I have short hair but a little goes a long way) and mostly first rub in on my ends and work towards the roots. Smells great and your hair feels wonderful after it dried. I love TIGI Bed head products. I use quite a few of them.</li>
    <li> Must have product for silky soft hair. Amazed with the price and speed of delivery. I will never purchase this at a salon or store again.</li>
    <li> Parece q o produto atende ao prop&amp;oacute;sito. Foi uma compra q minha irmã pediu e muitas mulheres usam. Pode ser um bom presente.</li>
    <li> Best price I could find on this.</li>
    <li> Love, love, love this product. It is the finishing touch after styling. Leaves my hair very soft, shiny and no frizzes or flyaways. I would recommend this product to anyone especially if you heat style your hair.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s good to use any time, after shower, after party, after a hard working day, morning, night. I realy like because it is not ticky.</li>
    <li> Love this on my hair!  Controls the frizzies and makes my hair soft.</li>

I don&#x27;t know if they added something to this that made it this way, or if its just a cheap knock off placed inside a Bed Head bottle or what, but I definitely wont be ordering this one again.</li>
    <li> Highly recommend this product.  It smells great and makes my hair very shiny.</li>
    <li> My stylist uses this every time she does my hair, but the product was too pricey for me.  Thank you for great pricing and quick delivery</li>
    <li> Especially good on the frizz of naturally wavy or curly hair, without a heavy product build-up.  Perfect for giving a little help to calm down wayward hair.</li>

    <li> Love it!  Delivered quickly and does a great job! Smells wonderful!  If you have coarse or unruly hair, this really works to tame fly-aways and smooth hair.</li>
    <li> I use it on the very ends of my hair so they don&#x27;t split</li>
    <li> Love it! I call it hair lotion. Great smell and always makes my hair silky smooth and soft. I normally use after I straighten my hair to smooth things over and recondition. After years of using this product I do believe my hair has benefited greatly.</li>
    <li> I meant to do the 5 star,  because I love that stuff! I use it all of the time!</li>
