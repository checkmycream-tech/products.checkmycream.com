<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I have used Braun Shavers for over fifteen years and have never been disappointed with the close shave I get.  I chose the 320s-4 over a more expensive model for the sole reason it will continue to work when plugged in to the A/C outlet if the battery dies.  The higher end 3 Series models do not work with the A/C cord when the battery dies.  I do not like the pop up trimmer on this model compared to an older model I have.  It works, but I am used to the older style trimmer which I feel gives me more control.  The shaver is good and is very quiet.  Being a lower end model it does not come with a travel pouch but does come with a clear plastic snap on cover.  The shave is  the same.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:  11-22-2015&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;AFTER HAVING THIS RAZOR FOR 1 YEAR  AND 5 MONTHS IT SUDDENLY WITHOUT ANY SYMPTOMS STOPPED IN MID SHAVE.  THE POWER BUTTON  DOES NOT  RESPOND TO BEING PRESSED.  THE RAZOR NOW TURNS ITSELF ON AND OFF RANDOMLY. I GUESS THE  CIRCUITRY HAS GONE BAD.  I WILL CALL CUSTOMER SERVICE ON MONDAY WHEN THEY ARE OPEN.  I HOPE THEY HONOR THE  2 YEAR  WARRANTY.  I WILL REMOVE TWO STARS FROM MY ORIGINAL RATING OF  FOUR STARS BECAUSE OF THIS  EVENT.</li>
    <li> I to buy his family, it looks very strong, very good.</li>
    <li> What can I say, Braun is the best...</li>
    <li> This is a great product and fit all of my needs</li>
    <li> Bought this one for my dad and will update it once get his feedback.</li>
    <li> This shaver really surprised me. I&#x27;m old now so I don&#x27;t like anything new or different. I had replaced the batteries in my old Braun 3 times and finally had to let it go. This is such a better shaver. It&#x27;s very light, with a nice rubbery grip. Also, the head tilt helps with the ergonomics. The cutting block and foil are one assembly-which is great from a maintenance standpoint. Plus-I don&#x27;t have to make as many passes as I did with the old razor, even when it had a new foil and cutting block. I highly recommend the 320S-4.</li>
    <li> Quiet, faster, sharp. Great tool. Longer lasting battery. It&#x27;s a pleasure to use and easy to clean. Much better than my previous electric shaver.</li>
    <li> It is easy to handle, shaves smoothly without skin irritation, and leaves me with a close shave.  I am very satisfied.</li>
    <li> Had a German Braun product for almost 15 years (1995 -  2008) until a traveling accident broke it beyond repair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Razor Burn. The worst razor burn I&#x27;ve had from shaving ever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;M90 Mobile &#x3D; 18$ (additional cutterblock 15$) &#x3D; no razor burn + hair trimmer that works&lt;br /&gt;3Series 320S-4 &#x3D; 65$ (additional cutterblock &#x3D; 23$) &#x3D; intense razor burn + useless hair trimmer&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hair Trimmer only works for some side burn hair, not all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As with all products, perhaps a small percentage are defective. I wish I had bought two, tried them out, and returned the defect(s) or just stuck with the Braun M90 Mobile &amp; replaced the cutterblock (15$) or got a new M90 entirely (18$).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good luck</li>
    <li> I have been using the Braun cordless razor for three months now. I find that it gives a good close shave. I shave everyday, and, I like the feel I get from using an automatic razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This model provides a close shave.  Not as close a feeling that you get from a manual razor, but it still gives my face a good feel. If Iskip  a day or two of shaving or I just want the feel of a close shave, I use a manual razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is still difficult for me to get some of the whiskers on my neck, but the time it saves in the morning is well worth it. Again if I want that &amp;#34;refreshing&amp;#34; feeling, I use a manual.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For me, it is not worth it to pay $150-200 for an automatic shaver, so I recommmend this model as more than adequate razor for most people.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been a Braun electric shaver user for more than 20 years and during that time have had at least a half dozen of their lower-priced models. No serious complaints even though there were differences among them as to speed, noise, number of uses per charge, etc. One thing in common, though, was that while the shaving results were OK, they could be better. Finally, this is a model that produces that desired close shave, good all day long. Remarkably, it&#x27;s sold at a price well below the more deluxe models. The cleaning routine is simple and the multiple head design is such that it will have a longer life than the more conventional design on other models.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent shaver. For my type of beard (medium), it gives a smooth, close shave with just a few passes (as long as you clean out the shavings after every shave or two). I don&#x27;t know about the durability because I&#x27;ve only used it for a short time.</li>
    <li> quiet and efficient. doesn&#x27;t feel as solid as the Brauns from a few years ago, but still a satisfying razor.  close shave and done quickly</li>
    <li> Most impressed with the long battery life. I have had the shaver for almost 3 weeks and have shaved daily on the iniital charge! Still going. Incredible. Far superior compared with my 6 year old Braun it replaced. Shaves faster and closer too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Braun group of shavers is simply the best electric razor in all categories. I always try others when I need to buy a new one but always return to Braun. For 30 years.</li>
    <li> Although this razor shaves pretty well the head design is so poor that attempting to clean it is a nightmare. I have rated it a one becuse there was no zero.I would return it if I could but since it is not defective...just poorly designed...I guess that is out.I have put it in a drawer and gone back to my old Panasonic which is a little dull but at least you can clean the head without little pieces coming apart in your hand. For us older fellows with poor close up vision this razor is a \\&quot;no no\\&quot;! Don&#x27;t buy it!</li>
    <li> I am a long time user of Braun electric shavers, and decided to replace my old 7500 series with a 3 cutter Philips Norelco to see how well it would work for me.  My son has a Philips Norelco, and loves it.  From the beginning, I was unhappy with the quality of the shave with the Philips Norelco, and after several months of use, I threw in the towel and purchased this Braun 3 Series shaver.  I am extremely pleased with the performance of the Braun 3 Series, and get a much closer and smoother shave than with the Philips Norelco.  Braun obviously makes a product that works best for my beard, and will stay with their design and product line.</li>
    <li> Love it.  Works well. Wish it came with a car charger because I use it there most. The battery lasts so it&#x27;s not a big deal. I do wish it were waterproof but for the money you can&#x27;t get a better shave.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not much of an electric shaver fan, but this is probably the best one I have used. I have bought two of these because they work better than any other electric shaver, but a real blade is still the best.</li>
    <li> Very happy with this product!</li>
    <li> gives a fair shave  (not close) for the first 2-3 weeks,  thereafter just &amp;#34;useful&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> Not my first Braun shaver but it lives up to its writeup and is a comfortable, easy to use and maintain shaver. I would recommend it to all.</li>
    <li> Great razor and snagged it at an even better price. The charge holds decently well even after years of use and the blades haven&#x27;t dulled enough to notice a significant difference.</li>
    <li> I have always been a fan of Braun and this certainly has not let me down. Close, comfortable cut right out of the box. Pretty expensive but that is the going rate for these things now a day</li>
    <li> Good product. Got one 2 months ago on Amazon for 40.</li>
    <li> I am seventy years old and I have been using Remington shavers all my life.  After using a Braum shaver for about a month, I must say, &amp;#34;I will never go back to Remington.&amp;#34;  I have sensitive skin and there is no razor burn and I get a good close shave. What more can I say?</li>
    <li> A much better shaver than my Phillips/Norelco of equal price.  Still not as good as a wet shave, but good.</li>
    <li> Smooth and convenient way to shave!</li>
    <li> I bought this braun razor and have been using it for about three weeks now and so far its been working good. It shaves very close and has a good battery life so I don&#x27;t have to be constantly recharging it like my old braun. The only problem I&#x27;ve had so far with is the cleaning part. The instructions say you can rinse the foil under water and lubricate it once a week. I prefer to dry clean it with a soft brush everyday. That&#x27;s how I used to clean my old braun, and lasted me 4 years. The foil on the new braun has many parts that come apart while dry cleaning it and if not careful, you can lose the small parts. Also, it&#x27;s a little difficult to reassemble and if you&#x27;re not detail inclined, it can be frustrating to reassemble it. On my old braun, the foil would come off easily. The cutting blades came right off too, and I could easily brush them off, snap them back together again and you&#x27;re done. Other than that, its a good electric razor for the low price.</li>
    <li> Only two shaves into this Braun, but think that&#x27;s enough time for some early comments.  By way of hirsute background . . . have been shaving for over five decades now and have owned a number of shavers, electric and safety.  Still, have found myself locked into blade-shaving for about the past 5 years. That&#x27;s because since retirement, I&#x27;ve lately been getting lazy about taking the time for the daily ritual of a good, complete blade shave.  But the wife let me know more than once that she didn&#x27;t appreciate smoozing against a 2 or 3 day growth of sharp, facial hair. So, about 2 years ago I bought a Panasonic shaver that took accolades from Consumer Reports. I gave it a fair trial, but after breaking in my face to an electric shaver, I found I was spending an inordinate amount of time \\&quot;rowing\\&quot; the Panasonic back and forth across my moderate growth, just to get a reasonable shave . . . never mind a \\&quot;good\\&quot; one. So, I went back to my non-daily blade shave routine, suffering the wife&#x27;s adversity to close-up contact on my hairier days.&lt;br /&gt;  But still, I wanted to give electric shavers another whack, so -- skipping CR reviews this time -- I started researching both the foil &amp; rotary offerings. An early case of sticker shock pretty much told me I would be condemned to return to a blade-shave if I couldn&#x27;t locate a winner at a moderate price. It almost came down to a coin flip between offerings from Norelco and Braun. The deciding factor was I remembered being happy with a couple of Braun&#x27;s from years back, and unhappy with my one rotary shaver purchase, several decades ago.  So, Braun it was.&lt;br /&gt;  Thirty seconds into my first shave, I wondered why some users had complained about the noise. Yes, I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s louder than a rotary, but it&#x27;s also much more quite than the highly rated Panasonic I&#x27;d put out to pasture, and definitely doesn&#x27;t assault my ear drums like I&#x27;d expected, based on some reviews. I did take the trouble to set-up my first shave with a pre-shave lotion (Lectric Shave), so that likely helped out a bit.  But, without exaggeration, I was very, very happy with the results.  Not only did I walk away with a baby-butt smooth face, but it hadn&#x27;t taken that much time or swipes across the face to do it.  Also, it cleanly took out a hairy trouble patch on the neck that I&#x27;d always had to attack with a blade from 3 or 4 different angles. While I&#x27;m happy I chose a shaver that can be quickly rinse-cleaned under tap water, I&#x27;m equally glad I skipped the higher price of a \\&quot;total soak\\&quot; model, frankly because I&#x27;m just not a big fan of shower shaving. (I always thought a guy has enough to do in a shower, without worrying about drop-smashing expensive electronics!) Haven&#x27;t yet gotten into stuff like, # of shaves per charge, side trimmer effectiveness or any of that. But unlike the first few shaves on my last electric, I am genuinely happy with this puppy and would suggest anyone wanting a truly good, close shave -- if willing to skip the more costly bells &amp; whistles of other models -- will not be disappointed. Enjoy!</li>
    <li> I like it.... battery charges for a about a week of normal use</li>
    <li> I just bought a Braun 320S-4 to replace a 5-yr-old Braun 5614. I really like the 320S-4. The grip is non-slip and well-designed. The new head design where the cutters can float independently really follows the contours of your face. I have some tough spots that usually needed 4-5 passes; now 2-3 passes will get them. My shaving time is reduced by about 1/3. The side trimmer is well positioned and accurate. I think Braun did a great job with this model.</li>
    <li> I had been thinking about switching back to a foil shaver for quite a while, growing progressively more dissatisfied with the results from my series of Norelco shavers despite them being mid-high expensive (about the 100 - 120 dollar range).  I had gotten to the point where I was needing to shave twice a day, or three times if I went out in the evening - morning, after work and before bed. Even with a fresh cutter pack.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s been about a week now and the shave is definitely much better with the Braun shaver; once a day, with a quick and optional touch up before bed for maximum comfort.  There is a significant, noticeable reduction in the amount of stubble in the morning and in the evening as well as feeling smoother immediately after shaving (which is more subjective and harder to judge).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I notice the foil cutter system has been improved with horizontally aligned cutter blades instead of the older vertical arrangement.  I am expecting that this will mean the foils are less prone to damage, a problem I had with foils shavers years ago when I switched away from them - but only time will tell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cleaning this shaver is much quicker and easier than my Norelco Speed XL. As well, I had a continual problem with lint getting wound around the hub of the cutters with my Norelco, periodically requiring the cutters to be taken out and manually cleaning them out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lastly, the lifetime for foils is better than rotary cutters, and they a less expensive than the extortionate prices Norelco charges, so this shaver not only cost less to buy, but should cost less over time to own. So, a lower TCO (total cost of ownership).</li>
    <li> Overall a very good purchase.  Bought to replace an aging Norelco rotary, and if definitely shaves a LOT smoother.  Shaver is a bit on the heavy side, but not so it is bothersome.  Very easy clean up and looks great.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only had a remington \\&quot;rotary\\&quot; razor prior to this which always caused irritation especially in the neck area. The braun 320s is the \\&quot;foil\\&quot; technology which has the blades running back and forth horizontaly under the perforated foil contacts. This provides a much, much smoother, closer, and less irritating shave. After I used my remington I would always have to go back with a normal blade razor to \\&quot;finish\\&quot; what the electric didn&#x27;t get. The braun 320s does an almost perfect shave every time. I would definitely suggest this razor to anyone who needs to shave daily or every other day. Its almost effortless.</li>
    <li> The razor seems to work just fine, but because of the picture of the cleaning base attachment, I thought I would have a different product than I recieved in the box.  Please remove the picture of the base!  It does not come with the razor!</li>
    <li> I replaced My old Braun model 500 something with this one. Since I didn&#x27;t need to shave under water I chose this model. The old Braun&#x27;s battery was going bad but I had no other gripes with the razor. Altho I did try a Remington foil razor but it didn&#x27;t shave me as well as the Braun. Almost as if the holes in the Remington&#x27;s foil were too small. So back to the Braun for me. I get great shaves with it and am real happy with my purchase. and this battery lasts way longer than the one in my old razor did.</li>
    <li> I bought this razor about a month ago to replace a fairly new Remington Rotary (their cheapest) that went from bad to worse in just a few months.  The Braun is quite quiet for an electric razor.  It shaves me fairly smoothly, but not the best I have ever had.  If it keeps up this performance level for a good while, I will be satisfied with it.  The batteries run down about as fast as on any shaver I have seen in several years, but, since they recharge quite quickly, this is a minor inconvenience.  Since the razor can also be used as a corded razor, there really isn&#x27;t a problem.  I do think, however, when one pays nearly $70 for a razor, they could at least put some sort of protective case with it.</li>
    <li> He absolutely love this gift</li>
    <li> The best electric shaver I&#x27;ve ever used in my life!. Just know that they show a cleaning station which isn&#x27;t included OR recommended for this model.</li>
    <li> doesn&#x27;t work very well, battery doesn&#x27;t last very long.  not a great buy. I was very disappointed in this product.</li>
    <li> Overall great shaver!  I was a little reluctant to buy a Braun in the &lt;$100 price range, but decided to go with the purchase anyway.  It&#x27;s basically the same shaver in any $150 Braun complete package with the cleaning station, without the station of course.  Same great Braun mechanics with a super close shave and no irritation. Charges very quickly and is a breeze to clean.  I absolutely suggest this shaver for anyone looking for a budget-friendly quality shaver.  Braun does it again and never disappoints!</li>
    <li> Gave it to my dad (93 years old). He lost pieces out of the first one. I was glad I bought cheap. He is still using the 2nd one.</li>
    <li> The picture shows that the shaver has a base for cleaning and storage, however there is no such thing.  It&#x27;s just a cord that plugs in.  This is upsetting because the base is specifically  my girlfriend picked this one for me for Christmas.  Now we have to go through the hassle of exchanging it.  As Amazon grows they are making more and more mistakes like this.  I was thinking of getting an Amazon Prime account but why should I pay more for misrepresented products?Also the shave itself wasn&#x27;t great.  I made probably 10 passes and she said I still missed some spots.  By then my skin felt like it was on fire so I had to stop.Thanks for screwing me again Amazon, that&#x27;s the third time for 2011, but don&#x27;t worry, 2012 will be different ;)</li>
    <li> Best shaver ive owned</li>
    <li> I am very impressed with this razor. It gives a very smooth shave. This one replaced an old Braun and there is a difference.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve owned and used this razor for three months after having done extensive research on the quality due to Braun now being owned by Procter &amp; Gamble, and manufacturing it in China (goodbye Frankfurt).  I&#x27;m very impressed with the quality, so far.  I had a small problem with the shaver head jamming, but P&amp;G provided excellent customer service and a quick replacement.  From my experience, I sugggest a dry clean by tapping the head on the counter (per the manual) and blowing clean both that and the shaver top with a computer-air spray bottle.  The amazing change in technology is that this razor turns the whiskers into a micro-fine powder which simply blows away.  So far, as a long time former Braun user, I highly recommend this razor.</li>
    <li> One of my favorite gifts of all time was a Braun shaver that I received from my wife. I am a cheapskate when it comes to electric shavers, and have never sprung for the much more expensive Brauns, but I must say I have been satisfied with the bargain models.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This was my third or fourth Braun, and my favorite of all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a hard to shave sparse beard that this shaver cuts through like butter. What I miss on the first pass is easily handled by the trimmer. Past models have done the same job, but not as well as this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the shape and feel of the unit. And if I let the battery run down, I can use this shaver while it charges- something that I could not do on the last Braun I owned. And the charging time should be significantly less. I really can&#x27;t say, as I have plugged it in for several hours and forgotten about it on both occasions I have charged.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This unit is a great hit with me, and a pure plesure to use.</li>
    <li> I am very satisfied with this razor. It does a great job.</li>
    <li> I replaced my old Braun with a Remington and that was a costly mistake. After six months of having to purchase screens every couple months I went back to this model of Braun. I am very satisfied with it. It works even better than my old Braun. It remains to be seen how well the screens will hold up but the old one did real well. This one is quieter than my older Braun and shaves even better. Just a good decent value.</li>
    <li> I have used both blade and electric over the years, but for the past 10 years, I have mainly been an electric shaver guy. I had been using a Remington Titanium model for probably all of those past 10 years. My current Titanium was now in need of replacing. Searching for it, made me discover it was no longer available. It was time to move on to a new shaver. I continued my research. One thing I did not like at all about the Remington Titanium was that it was loud - super loud, approaching jet engine loud. I always wondered if I lost my hearing, could I sue Remington? Maybe, but I wasn&#x27;t going to waste time dwelling on it. Either way, I was hoping that if I bought a new shaver, it wouldn&#x27;t be as loud as my Remington. I came upon this Braun model, and most reviews were favorable. I gave it a shot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re looking for a new shaver, like I was, search no more. This Braun model is excellent in so many ways: 1) It&#x27;s light 2) you can shave with the unit plugged in, or using the internal rechargeable battery power 3) It is quiet, very quiet 4) it gives a great close shave, with no skin irritation 5) the sideburn/mustache trimmer is effective, and works like it should. Personally, I think that this is a great shaver, and was designed well.</li>
    <li> I have had many Braun Shavers and other products - always satisfied but this shaver I absolutely the WORST electric shaver I have ever owned. And Braun customer service - A complete waste of time. This shaver is a good reason to NEVER purchase a Braun product.</li>
    <li> Produtos Braun são ótimos, esse também.  Levei alguns dias para me adaptar, já que usava outro tipo de barbeador, mas agora está ótimo, ele faz uma barba mais rente que o meu antigo philips.  A bateria também é muito boa, recarreguei já tem uma semana que ainda está funcionando bem.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t had this shaver for 2 months and it is pretty much useless. It refuses to shave any part of my face... I turn it on and I can sit there for 2 hours going back and forth over the same spot and it still won&#x27;t remove the hair. The trimmer works amazing and I&#x27;ve taken to shaving with the trimmer because I have no other choice. For the 60$ I paid, it shouldn&#x27;t be broke. It pulls on my hair and it&#x27;s a disgrace to shavers.</li>
    <li> A very good shaver for the price. My complaints: the long hair trimmer is not in a handy position, the cutter is impossible to clean.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve owned a few Braun shavers in the past and they have given me great results.&lt;br /&gt;The new one I chose is very quiet and gives a very smooth shave. I would recommend it to anyone who may have to shave twice a day sometimes.</li>
    <li> Very nice basic shaver.  No bells and whistles, but that&#x27;s just what I need.</li>
    <li> I bought this model because I felt that if I didn&#x27;t really like it I could send it back to Amazon and get a better model, if needed.  Well..., this little guy is probably the best electric shaver I&#x27;ve ever used in my life!  I&#x27;ve used Norelco shavers for years and when it finally died I started to shop around.  Apparently not to many people have purchased this model feeling the need to through down a lot more money to get a good product.  This presumption is way, way off since it shaves extremly fast and with great comfort.  With my Norelco&#x27;s I had to \\&quot;scrub\\&quot; my face to get it to do a good job but with the Braun 3 Series Shaver it does the job in a single pass.  I&#x27;ve only had it for a week but I would give it a 100% rating for what it does and the cost point.  Just know that they show a cleaning station which isn&#x27;t included OR recommended for this model, FYI.</li>
    <li> This is the first electric shaver I ever owned that cuts even the hard to get whiskers and does it comfortably. My face feels like it has been shaved by a blade. It simply does the job well for a very reasonable price.</li>
    <li> I purchased this Braun shaver because I had one that has worked very well for several years. The battery finally gave out in my old one. I contacted their tech department and they told me they do not sell batteries the customers. Disappointed I was so I purchased a Braun 3Series 320S-4 shaver. The shaver ran well but I could not get a close shave. I emailed the company regarding my dilemma and was sent instructions on how to shave. I&#x27;m 70 years old and I have shaved a few times, instructions is not what I needed. I needed and expected a close shave from this expensive shaver. Therefore, I would not recommend this shaver if you want to impress the ladies or you just want to look good with a close shave.</li>
    <li> ergonomic designed,easy to use, great fit fo cuts close ,long battery life and the price is right, great value for a good product</li>
    <li> -great price (just over 60 dollars)&lt;br /&gt;-as someone with sensitive skin who gets cut easily when shaving, it was nice that this shaver immediately adapted to the contours of my face and I emerged with no cuts.&lt;br /&gt;-I have had electric shavers that shaved a tad closer, but overall I am extremely happy with this shaver&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only real negative I can think of is that it doesn&#x27;t come with a travelling case. Luckily most shavers do, and most are of similar size, so if you have an old one case lying around there&#x27;s a good chance this will fit into it. ( it did for me at least)</li>
    <li> I can highly recommend this shaver, it is the best one I have had in my life so far, recommend it</li>
    <li> I received this shaver from my wife as a Christmas gift.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve only had rotary electric shavers in the past, Remington brand, because of their affordability.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I decided I&#x27;d like to try a foil shaver, and the Braun name is legendary.&lt;br /&gt;I chose this model because it doesn&#x27;t have any extra frills. There is no cleaning base station, or expensive cleaning solution required. Just use the supplied brush and rinse the cutter head under the faucet. Let it air dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is a charging cord included, which this will work cordless or corded. I really like this feature because the battery is dead on my old Remington, but I could continue to use it with the cord. Shavers that will only charge on a base don&#x27;t have as much as a useful life, IMO.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shave is great. It&#x27;s considerably closer than my previous shaver. Granted, I&#x27;m comparing an old rotary head to this brand new foil head, but it&#x27;s closer than the rotary ever was, even brand new. I have to include that I&#x27;ve been following Braun&#x27;s recommendation of shaving before washing my face. I&#x27;ve previously shaved after washing my face, as this always seemed to help with my sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t suffer any skin irritation from the new shaver. I seem to have slightly sensitive skin on my neck and was anticipating a bit of razor burn before my skin adapted to the new shaver, but I haven&#x27;t experienced any.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pop up trimmer is on the back of the shaver, and just slides up when you need to even out sideburns, etc.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a little awkward at first, to get used to, but it works great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The initial charge was pretty quick. It has an LED indicator light on the front to tell you when it needs charged.&lt;br /&gt;It also has a quick charge that lets you get 1 shave in, but then you&#x27;ll need to let it charge for several hours to receive a full charge.&lt;br /&gt;So far I&#x27;ve gotten 3 shaves out of it, and no signs of diminishing quality of shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does come with a plastic blade cover/guard, but no travel bag. You shouldn&#x27;t have a problem getting this to fit in another travel bag,or a toiletry bag.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It comes with a 2 year warranty, which I hope I don&#x27;t need to use. But it is reassuring that the company will stand behind their product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I&#x27;d recommend this to anyone looking for a high quality budget shaver. If you can forego the cleaning base station, grab this shaver!this to fit in another travel bag,or a toiletry bag.   It comes with a 2 year warranty, which I hope I don&#x27;t need to use. But it is reassuring that the company will stand behind their product.   Overall I&#x27;d recommend this to anyone looking for a high quality budget shaver. If you can forego the cleaning base station, grab this shaver!</li>
    <li> Initially i did not know how i felt as this was my first foil shaver.  Overtime it has become easier to use and I am glad I went with a Braun.  Highly recommended.  Just remember it needs to be broken in and it shaves better with each use!</li>
    <li> Was never a electric razer fan, and have tried a couple of different rotory razers. None of them did a very good job, seamed like I would be using it for a half hour or so to get a desent shave and by then I&#x27;d rubbed my face bare. Thought I would try a different style. Have had Braun products before and found them to be satisfacty. I didn&#x27;t need all the bells and whistles just a razer that did a good job. Braun has some other more expensive razer but they didn&#x27;t have any better ratings than this middle of the road one... I&#x27;ve been very happy with it. They one thing that is missing is some type of small travel case to store it in. The plastic head protector keeps coming off. So I went to Walmart and bought a point an shoot camera case for 8.00 bucks.....thats why I din&#x27;t give it another star. Come on most guys through there razer around like a tennis ball and the last thing I wanted was for the heads to get damaged.</li>
    <li> This shaver is solidly built and so far (3months) has held charge very well. Removable head is one integrated piece that is easy to remove/clean/attach. Have to shake the water out of it though. Shave is very good on my cheeks; better than my previous electric Remington razor but performance on my neck is still not great.I would recommend this razor.</li>
    <li> This is the best Braun shaver I have owned. It is light weight. The foil moves easily and the three cutters are great.</li>
    <li> I was disappointed. It didn&#x27;t work well on my legs. I used to always find that men&#x27;s razors shaved closer than women&#x27;s, and Braun is a good brand, but this model must be very low end. I will be returning it.</li>
    <li> Did not work right. The shaver would turn on all by itself &amp; if not discovered the battery would be dead the next morning</li>
    <li> I cannot get a close shave with this shaver. I used a Norelco for years and had great luck but this had good reviews for a good price so I tried it. I&#x27;m not using it and it&#x27;s sitting a drawer. Braun customer was good and sent me a new head but it still is not a good shaver.</li>
    <li> the shaver did not have a shift position on the shaver head for one row higher  for  above mustache  and under nose shaving</li>
    <li> this is the best electric razor I ever found for my husbands tuff beard</li>
    <li> The 3 series (320S-4) doesn&#x27;t have some bells and whistles (e.g. wet shave, cleaning stand) - however it&#x27;s a good value.  It does what I want - give me a quick, clean shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve owned an older Braun and like some reviewers have stated - the newer models don&#x27;t seem to be built as well (sturdy).  I&#x27;m not rough with mine so I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;ll be a problem.  My last Braun lasted about 10 years.  (actually I don&#x27;t have as high hopes for this one - but we&#x27;ll see)</li>
    <li> Does a better job than the Norelco brand type razors.  Bought originally for my son and am using it more than him.  Thank you for the transaction</li>
    <li> I have been shaving with razor blades and foam for over forty years and to my surprise this razor is as close and comfortable as my blade.  I use Williams Lectric Shave before shaving then after: Neutrogena Razor Defense Post Shave Lotion.  This is a perfect combination for me.  In the Braun instruction manual they tell you not to use a pre shave because it will &#x27;clog&#x27; up the nickel foil, I called cust service and was told since the Lectric Shave was alcohol base it would not effect the foil.</li>
    <li> First time using an electric and it works like a charm! Easy to clean and holds charge for a long time. Sometimes a bit tough to maneuver and getting rid of the tiny hair that stick out. But overall, a very good product!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using manual razors all of my shaving-life (about 15 years).  Five years or so of that was spent with a beard on and off because I could not stand shaving.  I would always get intense razor burn, ingrown hairs, and I would bleed for a good 15-20 minutes after every shave (I&#x27;ve tried every major brand of blade, shaving cream, even a safety razor at one point).  Shaving was easily a 30-45 minute ordeal *every day*.  So, logically, a beard was the way to go.  And then I joined the military!  After 2.5 years in the military shaving and noticing shaving with manual razors was getting worse, I could take it no longer.  Hearing some co-workers say some great things about foil shavers, I went ahead and picked up the Braun Series 3 today.  I used it after giving it the initial charge and it was immediately worthy of the five-star review I&#x27;m giving it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shave from start to finish, including clean-up was about 5-6 minutes.  Just the improvement in time to me is enough for five-stars.  Now my morning can be spent relaxing, going for a run, getting more sleep, or helping to take care of my son.  45 minutes down to 5-6 minutes is worth more to me than the price of this product.  The shave itself was amazing.  The shave wasn&#x27;t as smooth as a manual razor, but it was smooth enough for military standards.  I also experienced zero razor burn, no bleeding, and it handled the area under my nose without any difficulty whatsoever.  From here on out I&#x27;m only expecting things to get better over the next two to three weeks as I understand the shave will improve as my skin and hair adjusts to the new razor.  I have no cause for complaint regarding the build/feel of the razor.  You hold it and think \\&quot;quality\\&quot;.  It is solid, has a good weight, and is more quiet than I expected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If needed, I will modify this review.  But for an initial impression, this razor has changed my life.  I got an extra 3.75 hours a week back in my life - that&#x27;s HUGE!  I also don&#x27;t feel like I&#x27;m ripping my skin off anymore when I shave, and I&#x27;m not risking hemorrhagic shock either.l like I&#x27;m ripping my skin off anymore when I shave, and I&#x27;m not risking hemorrhagic shock either.</li>
    <li> I have been using the three head razors for quite a while, and wanted to give this style of electric razor a try.  It is less expensive than my last three headed razor, but it shaves my whiskers more closely.  It has very solid &amp;#34;German feel&amp;#34; to it when you hold it in your hand.  The only question  I will have would be to its longevity.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my nephew. He is 13 yo, first shave and he loves it plus I was impressed too. The pop up trimmer is excellent and Braun has always been reputable for us!</li>
    <li> Used a Braun well over a decade ago and then went to a rotary style I was never too happy with so I went back to what I thought would work much better. I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s equally as good/bad as my old rotary. It shaves decent, but takes FOREVER to get a smooth shave. It&#x27;s quicker to use a razor.</li>
    <li> So far it works fine, and seems reliable.  However I do not find the shaving performance to be outstanding.  It takes about the same pressure and number of passes as my much older Remingtons to get an acceptably close shave.  I guess I was hoping for a bit more.</li>
    <li> So, I had a 7526 7-Series from a few years ago. Unfortunately, it won&#x27;t hold a charge and it over-heats during charging. Also, the beard trimmer does not always work anymore. I use it ALL the time. Never used a straight razor for 30 years as my skin is too sensitive. I read the reviews on the new 7-series, and passed because the 3 series had such great reviews. This is not a bad razor for the money, but probably not much better than a cheaper Remington. I used it today and found it just did not perform as well as my old one. I am returning this 3 Series and going to pony up for the 7. Also note: if you are buying this 3 Series, this one is an older model. You should probably skip this one and get the newer one.</li>
    <li> I tried out the Series 5 and 7 but decided to buy this one ... very happy with it.  Much closer shave than my Braun 7505 (which finally died - the on/off button popped out) ... I used to have to follow-up with a dry razor but not any longer.  BEFORE YOU BUY, consider the price of REPLACEMENT heads ... those for the Series 3 are much cheaper than for the new Series 7.  My opinion of the version with the builtin cleaner is that they are a GIMMICK ... these are wet-dry shavers and you can easily wash them.  The cleaner-stands are clunky, and it&#x27;s just a trick to get you to buy refills every three months ... the fluid is water, alcohol, a little lubricant, and scent.  Just save the extra $120-$180 and buy this one!</li>
    <li> I have had every brand and type of electric shaver made.  The Norelco rotary shavers don&#x27;t shave close enough, requiring me to \\&quot;scrub\\&quot; my face over and over trying to get a closer shave.  The Remington screen shavers shave too close and always burn and/or nick my skin.  I found the Braun shavers years ago and fell in love with them.  They shave perfect without having to \\&quot;scrub\\&quot; and without nicks and burning.  Now the new style is even better.  Previously, the \\&quot;blades\\&quot; were vertical, rubbing against a horizontal screen.  This is the way ALL screen shavers shaved.  The new ones have a horizontal sheet sliding back and forth against a horizontal screen.  It works better than the vertical blades.  It&#x27;s also easier to clean.  The vertical blades required physical brushing to get rid of the whisker-mulch... hot water alone wouldn&#x27;t clean them.  The new heads drop the \\&quot;mulch\\&quot; into the bottom of the head and there is nothing to gum-up like the vertical blades.  A rinse under the faucet cleans it entirely, even without taking the head off.  It&#x27;s a perfect design from an engineering standpoint.</li>
    <li> Count me among the minority who found this shaver to be a waste of money and time. Nowhere near as close a shave as my other two single cutter Brauns, both series 1s.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t have a heavy beard, but still had to go over and over, and over, chin, upper lip, cheeks, everywhere. By the time I thought I was done, at least 10 minutes, the shaving heads were hot and my face was starting to get irritated. I had to finish shaving with an older Braun that was still more comfortable and close, despite that it needs a new cutter!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very, very disappointed in this 320. Pass on this one and keep shopping!</li>
    <li> A basic, well-made shaver that runs on either the rechargeable batteries or AC. Good design and has a head protector that easly slips over the top. Purchased several months ago. A charge lasts a long time too.</li>
    <li> Have been using this shaver for over 6 mos.  Takes many minutes and many passes to get a close shave.  Seems the best way is to use a very light touch and move it in more than one direction.  I have heavy whiskers.  The battery has about a weeks worth of shaving and will fully charge in 1 hour.  Would have been nice if Braun had thrown in an inexpensive carrying case.  A good choice for a quick 90% shave.  Since I am now retired, that meets my needs 6 out of 7 days.</li>
    <li> After 3 weeks of looking on amazon for electric razor and finely decided to go with Braun 3 320 series and it was the best decision I ever made and I will tell you why. 1. I just received it today, I took it out of the box read the directions and went and used it not fully charged and it cut every single piece of hair on my face and neck 2. I have tried Panasonic,Remington,Phillips,and Norelco and they can&#x27;t even touch this razor hands down when I tried it their wasn&#x27;t any brush burns or irration to my face which was great and the Quility of the razor is great not this cheap crap it really gave me a clean shave this is the best razor out there by far. And 3 of all when my sons are ready to shave this is what I am getting Braun razors for the both of them no other brand. And by the why this reveiw is honest and I wasn&#x27;t paid for this reveiw I speak the truth and not bull crap like some people do. One other thing it has a 2 yr warrenty which is awesome If anyone out their is looking for a good razor try this one you will love it Thank You Jimbo</li>
    <li> Cuts well if you shave everyday but I&#x27;m one of those guys who only shaves every few days because razors irritate my skin. With that being said, it doesn&#x27;t get the hairs that have grown to long and are at weird angles (every guys face has a patch that grows opposite all the other hairs, sort of like a cowlick) without passing over several times or having to extend the trimmer. The razor has a nice weight to it and is fairly long with rubber sides so control feels good. I was apprehensive about the packaging though because it didn&#x27;t come in nice and tight cellphone packaging like you see in the pictures or what it would be in if bought from a store, it and all the parts came loose in a white box without any secure filler so the razor just banged around in the box during shipping and was slightly scuffed up upon arrival. I turned it on and the motor sounded alright so hopefully the damage was just cosmetic. The Amazon ad said &amp;#34;new&amp;#34; but the packaging suggests refurbished but for the price I&#x27;m willing to overlook the packaging and possibility that it&#x27;s refurbished as long as it stays working. Braun has been a good product in the past and so far the razor works well, I just have to shave more often.</li>
    <li> Shave is fair.  It is ok for the price</li>
    <li> Great product which arrived promptly. This product meets or exceeds all my expectations. This is my second Braun product and Braun continues to produce a great product. I would definately recommend this product to others.</li>
    <li> Shaves seems closer than my last Braun shaver that lasted about 5 yrs.  Plenty of power, charges fast, easy to clean.</li>
    <li> My second Braun. It works great and if it last as long as the first one did it will be super.</li>
    <li> Unfortuantely it does not seem to work for my husband as well as the reviews claimed. Works great on his face, but cant get the hairs in the middle of his neck.</li>
    <li> Had a Braun 7526, (still running after nine years) and believed it was time for new. Could not afford the high-dollar models, so went for this 320S which I have used with good results for one month. Tried a competitor&#x27;s model with the three cutting heads and was unable to adapt to my beard. Believe this is a good product for the money.</li>
    <li> Easy to use and maintains a charge for quite a while. Easy to clean, easy to charge. Try it, you&#x27;ll like it.</li>
    <li> This is the best shaver I have ever used, it has no problem with a 2-3 day beard and it does a pretty decent job of getting longer hairs, although it does miss some you can easily get them with the trimmer. I think this model 320s-4 is particularly great at shaving wet, you don&#x27;t have to pay more for the 340-s to shave wet as it has a fully sealed body as it mentions on the product page but probably not under shower(I think that a man has enough to do in the shower than shave)therefore it is either marketing on Braun&#x27;s part for advertising the 340s as wet/dry or that model it has a better sealed body that can be used under shower. Anyways I have used this with Kiss My Face Moisture Shave shaving cream wet and it works beautifully,charges quickly with no irritation, brilliant.</li>
    <li> I bought this product because of the reviews that I read on Amazon and noteing that Amazon is a first class seller as I have bought there before with no problem. The Braun razor works very nice and better I think than the rotor blade razor I had before. It cuts real good and has a long battery life before needing charging.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Braun shavers for many years.  The 3 series replaces the 5000 series and is an excellent product and not overpriced like so many shavers today.  This is also quieter than the 5000 series and very quick to charge.</li>
    <li> Works even better than my old one it replaced, which was exactly the same model. I guess you stay with a good product.</li>
    <li> I purchased this shaver about 18 months ago as a second &amp;#34;in my life&amp;#34;  attempt at an electric razor. I thought the price point would be a good place to begin as I was uncertain if I could even use it, my beard is pretty tough!&lt;br /&gt;It was  my first of  three electric shavers over 18 months and it was good enough to make me pay attention. After acclimating to the shaver for about six months I decided to try a Braun 790cc with the cleaning station at home and keep the simple 320 S4 for travel.&lt;br /&gt;The difference between these two shavers is amazing! Try a high end shaver some time and see for yourself. I kept the 320 as I thought it would spare the better Braun from the rigors of travel. As the shaver aged the differences between the two became more apparent. In the end, I replaced the 320 with a Panasonic ES LV-81 Shaver and I am simply astounded at the difference. The 320 was not exactly a highly used tool, after the initial six months it was used infrequently. I believe the difference is simply the quality of the blades and foils and in the motors of the more expensive shavers. Whatever the differences the results speak for themselves. Buy the better shaver, Panasonic is my choice now but the 7 series is very good too.</li>
    <li> I ordered this to replace an older model Norelco rotary that has served me well for years.  I had tried a Braun foil shaver back in the early 1990s, and it didn&#x27;t work for me.  I figured this wouldn&#x27;t either, so I didn&#x27;t go all out and order the most expensive model with the cleaning stand.  Well, these foil shavers have changed over the years or my face has.  This is the best shaver I&#x27;ve owned, and for only $62. It&#x27;s easy to clean and holds a charge well. It didn&#x27;t irritate my face at all even from day one.</li>
    <li> Superb Shaving Product with a great foil that needs not to be replaced like the Remington Shavers. I have been looking for a great electric shaver and tried both Braun and Remington. The Remington Shaver has been designed for the Foils to wear out in weeks and cost more to replace them than the Shavers. The Braun Shaver Foils last a very long time and are easy to clean. I cannot even give away my Remington Shavers to Charity because the foils gets holes in them in two weeks. Braun should buyout Remington and just fire the Management and remove their inferior and poorly designed shavers from the Marketplace and do the world a favor.</li>
    <li> Great Product.  Never write reviews but wanted to this time.  I was nursing an older braun shaver, not wanted to buy another.  Finally broke down and ordered the 3 Series.  It is great. Definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m happy with this razor, which I&#x27;ve had for several months now. It shaves and trims well. As with any razor I&#x27;ve owned, you have to go over a some spots more than once. For me it seems to have a bit more trouble on my gray hairs, which maybe are a bit tougher. I recently started to use the razor to shave my head as well as my beard, and it&#x27;s done that well.</li>
    <li> I feel like I can finally give it a review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After two years I can say this shaver was a quality purchase and one of the best I&#x27;ve ever made. It still does a great job with the original foil and cutter. That result is probably unrealistic for most people as I use several electric and not just this one but it&#x27;s still impressive to say the least. It doesn&#x27;t cut as close as my Series 7, Panasonic Arc 4, or my Norelco 3D...but why should it? It was a fraction of the cost compared to them and I feel like for the $90 I paid(remember, I bought two years ago), the results are exceptional. Visibly it gives a skin close shave everywhere but the neck/jawline. It does pretty good there too but has cause slight irritation before in those areas. I won&#x27;t get that razor smooth feel when rubbing my hand over my face like with the three top end shavers mentioned above but unless you&#x27;re in a line of work where people touch your face everyday to inspect your shave, it shouldn&#x27;t really matter. What I&#x27;m getting at is it&#x27;s more than a suitable shaver for anyone who needs to be able to get a clean shaven look on the fly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When it comes to build quality it&#x27;s exceptional! The thing is built like a tank. I know you&#x27;re not supposed to but I&#x27;ve used it in the shower several time(I&#x27;ll explain why in a bit) and have never had any problems. It&#x27;s made out of thick durable rubber and has a very heavy, quality feel to it. Even compared to the high end shavers the build quality is unmatched.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now to the reason why I use it in the shower quite often. First I would like to mention that it is not meant to be used in the shower as far as I know and do so at your own risk. It has the best trimmer I&#x27;ve ever used! I have bought several body and beard trimmers but none can compare to this! The thing cuts through even the thickest hairs(guys, you know where I&#x27;m going) like a hot knife through butter. It trims at the speed of a shaver, but is built with the quality of a high end trimmer. The surface area is large enough to get a lot of hair at once, and small enough to get around those tight areas. You know what, I&#x27;ll just go out and say it. I USE THIS ON MY JOHNSON AND HIS TWO FELLAS. Call it gross, unsanitary, unnatural...whatever you want but while your at it, go ahead and call it a job well done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would I recommend this product? Of course I would! Who would I recommend it two? Well that depends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You want a good clean shave on the fly at an affordable price? YES&lt;br /&gt;You want a trimmer that can complete even the most demanding tasks with great results? YES&lt;br /&gt;You want a quality made backup shaver in case your main one fails? YES&lt;br /&gt;You want a top of the line skin close shave with an electric shaver? NO&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At the end of the day it gets the job done but if you wanna completely trade in your double edged for similar results with an electric, you&#x27;ll simply have to fork over a bit more. I recommend the Braun Series 7, Panasonic Arc 4/5, or my personal favorite, the Philips Norelco 3D.</li>
    <li> Braun 3Series 320S-4 Electric Shaver - I have been using Braun shavers for years now and what I really like about the 320S-4 is that it somehow manages to keep all the whiskers inside the shaver head while shaving instead of allowing them to fall out and getting all over the counter/sink surface. The shaver head is noticeably wider than my previous Braun (Model SmartControl3 4775) and does make shaving under my nose a little more difficult but is really no big deal given the other positives this shaver has. The trimmer portion of the shaver works ok but of all the Braun shavers I&#x27;v had over the years, my favorite for trimming sideburns etc is the Braun model 255 of which I still use for most of my trimming. I don&#x27;t use the 255 for regular shaving as it just doesn&#x27;t give a close shave like the newer models do. I can go about two weeks between charges with the 320S-4 but given that this model works corded/cordless I can just plug it in if the charge falls too low. I have tried other shavers of all types but my favorite by far is Braun.</li>
    <li> very cheap spring mechanisms just under the shaver heads. Tapped to clean the whisker receptacle and spring let loose and plastic housing on it broke. I&#x27;ve been very satisfied with Braun products in the past - they&#x27;ve been my go to shaver for over 10 years - this was very disappointing.</li>
    <li> works fairly well for everyday use but tends to grab and irritate when 2-3 days go by between uses, battery life is impressive. easy to clean.</li>
    <li> I have always been pleased with Braun shavers. The only drawback is the rechargeable feature that is done immediately when the power runs out rather than just running low. Keep it on charge!</li>
    <li> The brand is the best and the product is pretty good. I&#x27;ve had better models but for the price is worthy.</li>
    <li> Best razor I have ever used.  It shaves close and is comfortable to use.  If you need an electric razor this one is for you.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had a series Braun series 3 shaver in my inventory of grooming products for several years now and swear by them. I keep one at home, one at my significant others home and one in my travel bag. They are light, deliver a close, clean shave on the top of my head and enable precise trimming around the lips, under the chin and sideburns.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I learned early on that cleaning them under running water works just fine so I never buy the cleaning tower nor do I pay for the cleaning solution which can be a considerable expense if one shaves often.  Overall this shaver is a best buy in my opinion especially if multiple units are to be had as in my case. I recommend it without hesitation and be not afraid to try a first time vendor/shipper as well.  My experience went 100% without a hitch.</li>
    <li> doesn&#x27;t shave well, very disappointed, expected much better quality but Braun changed for the worse. Don&#x27;t waste your money.on this.</li>
    <li> I FIND IT AN EXCELLENT PRODUCT.</li>
    <li> Although the description states: 100% waterproof, this shaver is somehow not capable of wet use in a shower.  One must go into the fine print to discover that this is for DRY use only.  A waste of delivery time for anyone looking for a wet shaver.&lt;br /&gt;The shaver may be fine for dry use, but I gave it one star for the poor information.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always liked Braun shavers but none of the ones that I have owned have shaved this close right out of the box.  I really hate shaving but this thing makes it not so bad.  I hope the battery lasts a nice long time but if it doesn&#x27;t the shaver can be used plugged in so I&#x27;ll still be able to use it.</li>
    <li> Had previous Braun shaver before a much older model. This one is much quieter , longer battery power and nice close shave. I don&#x27;t like the rotary models so Braun does the job very well including in the hard spots like under your nose and neck. I would recommend this to anyone looking for a great everyday shaver</li>
    <li> I bought this shaver because I broke the foil on my Braun Smart Control 190s. Instead of paying 10 dollars to replace the foil, I decided to upgrade the unit by getting the 3 series. I always like my Braun Smart Control because I have used it for 7 years!! Needless to say how sturdy the shaver is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After months of using, here are some pros and cons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;1. Battery life is just so long. After two weeks of daily using, I still don&#x27;t have to recharge it yet!!!&lt;br /&gt;2. It is just comfortable and the blades do not cut my skin at all.&lt;br /&gt;3. Cool design with pretty colors and LED battery light. (Kind of reminds me of the BMW 3 series, lol)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Maybe its just me but sometimes it can take a while for me to shave my chin. Especially when my chin hair is too long but otherwise it gets the job done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Conclusion:&lt;br /&gt;Get this shaver if you are looking to buy a new one. It is easily the most comfortable shaver I have used.</li>
    <li> It works; leave it at that. But better than the competition.</li>
    <li> 2 use and it broke!! i wont buy this again</li>
    <li> The shaver gives you a close shave, granted; however, it does have its problems. It&#x27;s head can pop off while you&#x27;re shaving. Basically, you&#x27;d be running the thing along your face and the head would pop off, which is not very pleasant, and then you&#x27;ll be poking your face with the vibrating internal mechanism. You can correct this to a certain extant by holding the head in place while shaving. Still, the whole problem is a real pain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With my shaver, just today the damn thing popped off five times in one shaving session. Pathetic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Moreover, it&#x27;s also a drag sometimes to drag it over your face. The shaver doesn&#x27;t glide very well at all at times. Sometimes you have to push it harder than what you&#x27;d expect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, be aware that if the head does pop off while you&#x27;re using it, there&#x27;s always the chance that some of the inner mechanism will fly off as well, rendering the shaver useless. This happened to me, but I did eventually find the piece that flew off and was able to mount it back into the shaver.</li>
    <li> After 15 years of using electric razors, I have gotten shave ever from this Braun product. Really good battery life between charges. Two thumbs up!</li>
    <li> I have had this razor for a year now and am very satisfied with its performance.  It replaced a Braun 8595 (which died) _and_ a Norelco 905RX.  The reason it replaced both razors is that I had to use them both to get a good shave.  The Braun shaved close, but didn&#x27;t seem to do as well on non-flat areas (like the neck) or with longer hairs.  The Norelco did fine on these difficult areas, but just wasn&#x27;t that close of a shave.  The 320-S4 does what each these prior razors did best - shaves close and shaves well in all areas while  handling longer hairs.&lt;br /&gt;The prior Braun was their highest-end model  and used a cleaning system.  The cleaning system worked fine, but it was quite expensive paying for the solution that had to be replaced frequently.  After about 3 years or so, the cleaning system stopped working, which actually was fine, because it really was a bit of overkill.  Not requiring a cleaning system for this razor is good.  And being able to just clean it with water is a plus (couldn&#x27;t do that with the 8595).&lt;br /&gt;Another good thing about this razor is that it can run using the electric cord, in case the battery runs out.  Couldn&#x27;t do that with the prior Braun.  And it seems to charge up fairly quickly, as well.&lt;br /&gt;A couple negatives, though.  The replacement head (foil and blade) costs about 45% of what was paid for the complete razor.  The other negative is that the battery seems to hold about 20-30% less charge than when it was new.  (I  run the razor longer than normal, since I also shave my entire head daily.  So my 1 year of use probably compares to what most folks would use in 1 1/2 or 2.)  It&#x27;s possible this might have resulted from recharging the razor as soon as the low-battery light came on.  I have since discovered that the warning light comes on with about 10 minutes of charge left, so I am now using it until it stops and then finishing while plugged in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros&lt;br /&gt;1) Shaves all contours well&lt;br /&gt;2) Can handle longer hairs (withouthaving to use trimmer)&lt;br /&gt;3) Can be rinse-cleaned with water&lt;br /&gt;4) Charges up quickly&lt;br /&gt;5) Can run on power cord when discharged&lt;br /&gt;6) Great price point&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons&lt;br /&gt;1) Cost of replacement cutters&lt;br /&gt;2) Possible battery life issue&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line - I&#x27;d buy this razor again if I needed a new one.</li>
    <li> Great Shaver!! Very Close Shave, long battery life, all you ask for in a shaver for this low price range. Highly recomended. You will be very satisified.</li>
    <li> This shaver is great! I wanted to give it a 4 1/2 star rating but I couldn&#x27;t. It&#x27;s priced good, works really good, charges fast, maintains battery life, and shaves fast! Some spots it has a little hard time getting but if I use the trimmer and go in different directions, it will shave all of my hair or just about every spot and if it does miss a spot, it&#x27;s usually small or just a few pieces of hair you can&#x27;t see easily! I use to have a Panasonic shaver and it was bad! It would not shave good and it would pull my hair! It would hurt and take so long for me to shave! I don&#x27;t think I will buy a Panasonic shaver again! Sometimes this shaver does pull my hair but not often, doesn&#x27;t hurt that much, and only does it if my hair is really long! Braun has great German quality! I think it could shave a little better but overall it&#x27;s great and they make many other shaves! Another thing I like about this shaver is you can use it while its plugged in! You can&#x27;t do that with many new shavers! I hope it lasts awhile! Everything about this shaver is great and I would recommend it and many other Brauns!</li>
    <li> This was my replacement. It is working great so far. Pros - easy to clean; inexpensive; does the job great; pretty quiet to operate; don&#x27;t overheat. Cons - didn&#x27;t come with the base (don&#x27;t fool by the picture. You have to purchase it separately); a bit heavy to travel with; no travel/protected bag included. Overall ... it is okay to invest this model. You can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
    <li> the product quality is the same what you pay for!  yes, it leaves beards on the neck, and i need more time for shaving but it doesn&#x27;t remove all of them, however i like this stuff. what you are expecting for 59$ product?</li>
    <li> This shaver did not provide a smooth shave. I tried it every day as my sole shaver for about 30 days. It removed the main stubble to a degree, but the softer hairs under my chin would not be cut no matter how many times I went over them. I also had to go over my face several times to get an adequate shave. I think in part the trouble might be due to the rectangular shape of the blade surface. I replaced this with a Phillips PT730/41 model, with the three round floating heads. It provided an effortlessly smooth shave with no break in period.  Amazon accepted the return of the Braun, even though I did not have the original packaging (I had everything else). Way to go Amazon!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t understand why there are so many rave reviews for this product. Sure, it is cheap, it is also made by a respectable company, but when I bought this product off of a slickdeal, it was the worst purchase I have made at Amazon. And that&#x27;s saying something.&lt;br /&gt;This is because the shaver doesn&#x27;t even work very well. I charged it, turned it on and tried to shave my chin/upper lip (I&#x27;m asian) and it missed almost 50% of the hairs. For some reason I would go over certain areas of my neck over and over again and it just wouldn&#x27;t cut. I used the attached sideburn trimmer to try to trim my sideburns and neck and that didn&#x27;t work very well either.&lt;br /&gt;It does feel like it&#x27;s solidly built, however, it&#x27;s very wide and bulky compared to my old Panasonic shaver, which I used before for 3 years and had no problem with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Honestly, not worth your money or time. I told Amazon about my experience and they gave me a full refund, so props to their customer service. It may have been a defective product that I received, so take this with a grain of salt, but in my honest opinion this is a terrible product.</li>
    <li> Just purchased the Braun 320S-4 shaver about one month ago. Was very please with ease that it was to use with the floating heads. Also, the cleaning is much easier than my previous Braun which I have had for many years but was needing a new head and blade. I bought this shaver for $44.00 we surprised me because they wanted over $20.00 for a replacement head and blade for the old one that I had. Time will tell about how long this will last. If it last many years like the other Braun I will be happy. Charging is simple, when the red light comes on, recharge it. I usually get about four days of shaves before needing to be recharged. Excellent shaving head protector when not in use.</li>
    <li> not bad for the price I paid. Still evaluating because I do not use it daily so too soon to say more</li>
    <li> Every guy out there just needs to put down those disposable razors and &amp;#34;invest&amp;#34; in one of these. I put invest in quotes, because for this price I wouldn&#x27;t even consider it an investment.  It just makes the morning so much easier.  What really puts it over the top is the little pop-up hair trimmer that really comes in handy for those.... sideburns.</li>
    <li> I find it wonderful cause my old one was broken and I need a new one. But for elektrzity you nedd an adapter</li>
    <li> Context: I am primarily a safety razor guy. I use an electric as a backup if in a rush, to touch up from time to time and for trips where I don&#x27;t want to bring a full on shave kit.  I had a Panasonic shaver in this exact style (horizontal and not spinning round blades) and I loved it. After several blade and foil replacements, the battery finally bit the dust.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I picked this up on the cheap, but expected so much more. It takes several passes to achieve an even moderately close shave and it seems like it completely misses spots. I do not expect the same performance out of an electric as I do a safety razor, but I was disappointed with how this product comparatively performed versus my old Panasonic. Maybe others have had better luck, but I would hesitate to buy this again if I had to do it over.</li>
    <li> I have always have had good luck with Braun products and this shaver is no exception. The shave is clean and I like that it can be used with the cord if you find yourself with low batteries.</li>
    <li> His tried and true old  shaver gave up so he got this one for Christmas.  Says it is fine, but not exceptional.</li>
    <li> I was using a very old Braun electric shaver that still works well, but read about this new model.  It is terrific.  The shave is much closer and more comfortable than the older shaver.</li>
    <li> I have shaved for 55 years using only a blade or a Norelco. Decided to try Braun based on&lt;br /&gt;others&#x27; recommendations. I would rate this one as slightly better than any Norelco I have had.&lt;br /&gt;It seems to get closer with less grinding. But my beard is very tough. Nothing matches a good&lt;br /&gt;blade shave.</li>
    <li> The shaver came quickly and works as expected.  Good value for the money spent.  Not as good a shave as the previous Braun but certainly more economical.</li>
    <li> This Braun was a replacement for a Braun 8995 which was a much more expensive shaver.  I bought this unit for under $50 here and am happy enough because of the price.  It doesn&#x27;t perform as well as the other shaver.  The old Braun had a swivel head which is very helpful.  The trimmer on the old unit was also much better.  But for the price I can&#x27;t complain.  I&#x27;ll probably buy a higher end Braun  at some point and use this one as a backup. Edit 9/17/15: I&#x27;m downgrading from 4 to 3 stars because the shaver broke after a year and a half.</li>
    <li> While not so \\&quot;deluxe\\&quot; perhaps as compared to the 7 series Braun shaver that I received as a gift, The 320-S is a great shaver. This unit is one of the more basic featured models of the higher performing series in the line. The shave is also closer and more comfortable than any rotary type electric I have owned. The functions and features not included at this price point (compared to the upper series Brauns) are such luxuries as a pivoting head, charge status display panel and a cleaning/charging station. For those who prefer simple \\&quot;no frills, just get the job done\\&quot; equipment, this model is an excellent choice. Unlike some affordable shavers, the Braun 320-S can be used either cordless or with the cord if out of charge and the head can be rinsed under a running faucet to help maintain cleanliness. If you have been considering Remington or Panasonic foil head electric shavers because of price, I would encourage you to add the Braun 3 Series to your list</li>
    <li> This is a solidly-built and reasonably priced electric  shaver.  It works well and has an effective long hair trimmer. A surprise feature of this shaver is a light that comes on letting the owner know that it is time to replace the cutters. It also has a low battery warning light. It is solid in the Braun tradition.</li>
    <li> Got the deal of the day for $30.  Had an older Braun ten years ago that still works but the battery needs replacement.&lt;br /&gt;This served me well so far. Will continue to support Braun&#x27;s product.</li>
    <li> slow running motor - doesnt shave as well as the more expensive shavers made by Braun.  I bought it so I would have an extra razor if my 700 series razor breaks down.</li>
    <li> I love it, great product!, leaves a smooth skin, the battery last a lot so you can use it 4 a long time</li>
    <li> I had a Braun Series 1 that was my first foil type shaver and it was passable, since it was faster than a traditional razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought my Series 3 after dropping and damaging my Series 1, because it was more cost effective to upgrade than to repair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am glad that I upgraded. The Series 3 takes no effort to achieve a close shave in a short time. The Series 3 is surprisingly quiet and easy to clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do have to shave daily with the Series 3 to avoid a shadow, while I can skip a day if using a traditional razor, but the Series 3 is efficient enough that I still save time and effort.</li>
    <li> REMINGTON I used for 14 years but this 320 is superior in every way!!!&lt;br /&gt;I recommend it. do not hesitate to buy it.</li>
    <li> I&#x60;ve been using the 320 S-4 for over a year.  I&#x27;m still on the original screen.  I am getting as good a shave as from any of the electric razors I&#x27;ve ever used over the past 50 years.  The Brauns I&#x27;ve used seem to go about 1.5 years on screens.  So the fact that they are a bit more expensive than cheap ones is sort of irrelevant.  It is a great shaver.  I&#x27;ve gotten good shaves from Remingtons, but lately the screens are expensive. When my latest Remington went through 2 screens in 6 months, I ordered this Braun based on the recommendations.  I like the fact that the head goes on either way, so one side is not used more on the right or left, that should increase screen life.  It consistently runs 7 shaves for me on a charge.  Right now I&#x27;m charging it on Sunday.  I think it will run with the cord, but I&#x27;d have to hold the cord in or tape the cord in to do that. I have never timed the charge.  It seems like a full charge is about 45 minutes.  I don&#x27;t remember ever running out the battery and trying a quick charge.  Mine has done 1.5 shaves with the red light on. I&#x27;ve never used it wet, and do not use water to clean it.  I guess either is ok, but that is not my style. I thought it was German, but mine said \\&quot;made in the US.\\&quot; The previous Brauns I&#x27;ve had ran till couldn&#x27;t get a good screen for them. My only concern is this one is getting a bit hard to get the side burn trimmer out.  I guess I&#x27;ll spray it with silicon and see if that helps. Thanks for taking the time to read this.  God bless your decision!</li>
    <li> The problems for me:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- This shaver pulls hairs if I haven&#x27;t shaved for a few days (I&#x27;m a guy)&lt;br /&gt;- It&#x27;s curved so that there&#x27;s only one way to hold it: with the trimmer away from you.  That doesn&#x27;t work well for me because I&#x27;m a one-handed shaver and like to flip up the trimmer with my thumb and continue using it.  With this shaver I have to flip the shaver over.  While that doesn&#x27;t sound hard, it&#x27;s awkward and I don&#x27;t like it.&lt;br /&gt;- The shaver&#x27;s light indicates when it&#x27;s low on charge, which is good, but I&#x27;m used to noticing a lower tone to the razor when the juice is low.  If you don&#x27;t notice the light, this one suddenly quits in the middle of a shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All of these items were fine on the 2 previous models I owned, both Braun.  They were not curved so I could have the trimmer side toward me and switch to using it with a flip of my thumb.  Nice.  They also didn&#x27;t pull hairs and had a lower tone when they were running low on power (in addition to the light).  They also had a better, sturdier feel in the hand, although they were also much more expensive with self-cleaning bases.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It depends upon what features you want, but I like the previous Braun shavers better.</li>
    <li> I had an old Braun electric shaver that wore out, so I got this one. Really impressed. I have a heavy beard yet I get a close shave with this. And it has a nice trimmer for sideburns, mustache, etc.  What else could I look for in a razor?</li>
    <li> Not as good as my old Braun</li>
    <li> I bought this shaver for my husband for Christmas. He opened it and used it right away. He loves it! It shaves close without any pulling.</li>
    <li> The Braun 3 series is a bargain at the price.  It gets as close as you would expect with an electric shaver, and the removable head, makes it very easy to clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you hate shaving with a razor, this makes life a whole lot easier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The charger is a little bit large/clunky, but that shouldn&#x27;t be an issue for people.</li>
    <li> This replaced a much older Braun model.  This gives a much closer shave and powers through longer hair.  Also holds a charge for surprisingly long time.  I am very pleased with this shaver.</li>
    <li> I use this razor everyday and have no problems with it and would recommend it to anyone looking for a new electric razor.</li>
    <li> was a replacement for an earlier model that I&#x27;d had for years, that the battery died.  This works much better and lots quieter.  If you&#x27;re thinking of getting one, do it, you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never owned an electric razor before. I bought it for my teen sons who have little bits of long fuzz on their faces. Our daughter uses it on her legs and likes it a lot. It looks like a close shave but doesn&#x27;t feel as close as a blade shave. It works well for what we need.</li>
    <li> This is a very good shaver, especially for the price. I have used a Norelco for the past 25 years and this gives a closer shave. Easy to use, easy to clean and I like the fact that you shave before you shower. It does not clean in one pass as some reviews stated, but maybe I just have a tough beard because I&#x27;ve never had any razor that would. But it definitely does the job with a few passes. I&#x27;d recommend the purchase.</li>
    <li> I wish Braun made its electric razors like they used to ten years ago. The quality has dropped a bit but I have tried a more expensive Panasonic and a Norelco. No electric razor works as well as Braun.</li>
    <li> It is not an expensive (if you think that $65 is inexpensive) purchase, as shavers go, but it does the job.</li>
    <li> No better and no worse than other electric shavers I&#x27;ve had in the past; does an ok job for me and cleans us easy.</li>
    <li> I bought this based on the brand name, and was not disappointed. The razor gets all the spots on my rubbery face. Upper lip, wattle under the chin, all of it. Recharge last a very long time! Solid feel and weight.</li>
    <li> HAVE BEEN USING BRAUN FOR AT LEAST THIRTY YEARS, IF YOU WANT THE BEST, GET THE BEST, BRAUN. I AM NOT A BRAUN EMPLOYEE, JUST A HAPPY CUSTOMER.</li>
    <li> (I&#x27;ve been using the Braun Series 320s-4 Shaver I purchased here at Amazon.com back in July of 2013 and here&#x27;s my updated review:)&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m sorry but I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this shaver!&lt;br /&gt;After shaving for 48 years and using this bronze the last two years all I can say is there is no good reason to use a blade again, there is no wet shave that compares to this Braun!&lt;br /&gt;No cuts,no nicks,no irritation,baby butt smooth face every time,long-lasting, durable, with a seven-year warranty the company stands behind: what else could a man ask for!&lt;br /&gt;You would have to pay three times as much for a Panasonic as good as is Braun!&lt;br /&gt;Divide the cost of this razor by the number seven and that&#x27;s how much does razor will cost you to operate for seven years. Compare that to a razor blades shaving cream aftershave neck and cut stuff… It&#x27;s just not worth it, buy this damn-near perfect shaver and I promise you: you will never look back in a razor blade again!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m still using my now 2 year old Braun 320s-4 and love it more now than ever!  Still shaves like it did its first shave, still a better shave than any blade razor I&#x27;ve used in 45 years; closer, smoother and less irritation! Absolutely no stubble left behind; none! I have a full face, med/heavy very coarse beard and the blade heads lasted 18 months but I barely noticed any difference in my shave. I highly recommend is raised to anybody especially people like me on blood thinners you&#x27;re really appreciate the quality of the shave you can still get. You can spend more but you won&#x27;t get better!&lt;br /&gt;At 60 years old I&#x27;ve tried to make the switch to electric shavers more than once and could never find a model that could give me the quality of shave soap and a blade could...until now. When my Doctor put me on blood thinners and a minor nick turned into a gusher I knew I had to make the switch and almost decided to just grow a full face beard rather than suffer going through several weak shaving electrics until I found one that was &#x27;good enough&#x27;. Then I read about the Braun Series 320s-4 and just had to give it a try! Boy, am I glad I did. Weather 1 day or a 3 day beard my 320s-4 plows through everything in at least half the time a quick once over or a traditional 4-way wet shave would with no cuts, no razor burn, no discomfort and a shave that is as close and smooth or even more close and smooth than I ever got with soap and blade! I&#x27;ll never switch back again! I also like that I can sit in my recliner and watch the news while shaving now:) Cleaning is easy and the ability to literally run the head under the sink to flush out the derbies is great for when the razor is really getting impacted with derbies. While very powerful not too loud, and like wet shaving you have to remember the grain of your beard and how it lays, and do mulch-directional shaving like the old 4-way wet shave and after a little practice you&#x27;ll be amazed at how much better a Braun is to any other style or brand of shaving! Don&#x27;t hesitate: Buy the 320s-4 today! Definitely not the &#x27;flat-head&#x27; underpowered hair pulling electric shaver or the 1970&#x27;s and unless your beard grows mulch-directionally over your entire face a rotary just don&#x27;t &amp;#34;cut-it&amp;#34;! This Braun sure will!&lt;br /&gt;[...]nough&#x27;. Then I read about the Braun Series 320s-4 and just had to give it a try! Boy, am I glad I did.

    <li> my old Braun that would not hold a charge for more than two days and did not have much power, the new razor shaves better, has a lot of power and holds a charge</li>
    <li> My husbands favorite shaver!</li>
    <li> Never try a Braun before i purchase it form Amazon, and it&#x27;s great! Once i try it and i can tell Braun really has a very good quality. Totally it&#x27;s Make in China, Yup i just can NOT believe that. I feel comfortable and fit my face well.</li>
    <li> I previously had a Braun Series 1 shaver, and decided to upgrade after reading reviews for this particular model.  This model shaves a little closer than series 1, has 2 heads instead of just one, seems to have more power also.  All in all, I am happy with purchase - good value for the money.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know that I&#x27;ve bought a shaver for my husband that actually holds a charge after a few months - this one does.  A year and a half later and it&#x27;s still going strong.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used cheaper shavers and I&#x27;ve used better shavers but I&#x27;ve never used a better shaver that was less expensive than this. It does the job well, holds a charge forever and doesn&#x27;t break down. I usually need a shave every 1.5 days so I use this shaver every 1-2 days depending on my mood. If you&#x27;re Grizzly Adams or tend to grow a 5 o&#x27;clock shadow by noon then this shaver is probably not for you.</li>
    <li> The new one does a better job than the old one.  The sprung heads maintain contact better, and the redesign of the trimmer is much easier to use.</li>
    <li> Takes for ever to get a close shave and not very good if you skip a day. Best to keep at work for an emergency shave.</li>
    <li> Works alright. Does give a close shave but misses hairs when they are longer.</li>
    <li> I am not picky about my shaver. As long as it does a decent job. That being said, this is a terrible shaver that is a pretend product in my opinion. I will charge it fully and it still will not provide a close shave. I almost always have to use a manual razor to finish the job. Not sure how this shaver gets 5 stars from other folks.</li>
    <li> Prior to purchasing this shaver, I&#x27;ve only used Norelco brand shavers, all corded too.  I have the Norelco 6940 which I purchased earlier last year and still have a Norelco 4401LC (which is at least 10 years old but still kicking).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got this because the deal was too good to pass up.  I paid only $35 for it here.  Although, I reviewed the Norelco 6940 and gave it 4 stars, I think it actually deserves 3 after a second look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With all shavers, I never seem to get all the hair follicles on the first pass by.  But with this shaver, it takes less strokes and the cut is definitely much closer than any of my previous shavers.  I&#x27;m not a gorilla, so I don&#x27;t spend a lot of time shaving.  I can shave my face in about 1-2 minutes top and be done.  The battery seems to hold well and can go weeks at a time without needing to recharge the device.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, this has more to do with cosmetic and less with actual functionality but I do love the look and feel of the shaver.  The gray areas on the shaver are composed of some type of rubbery material and the weight is spot on.  The blade head removes easily and cleans easily too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is my new favorite razor.  Easily 5 stars for this item.</li>
    <li> very good product i bought............ explain why you liked or disliked this product.&lt;br /&gt; •Do compare to similar products and share how long you&#x27;ve used this product.&lt;br /&gt; •Do identify specific attributes</li>
    <li> Overall I like it, but it has major issues getting the hairs around my lower neck and Adam&#x27;s apple. Still not convinced an electric can beat a regular razor (at least in this price range and blade type). The included trimmer is convenient.</li>
    <li> It does a fine job. Very smooth. Have to work hard not to miss a spot because it&#x27;s so smooth, but it works well!</li>
    <li> does all I need, travels well internationally, holds a charge a long time, and gives the best shave I&#x27;ve had in years.</li>
    <li> I bought my last Braun in 2007, it has served me well. I replaced the cutter and foil a few times over the years, let me say, I really got my moneys worth, and it is still running well. I figured it was time for a new one, so I ordered this unit, not so much for the price, but more for the fact that it is the only one that will run on AC, as well as the battery. Another nice feature, that is slowly dying out.&lt;br /&gt;Without exaggeration, this shaver surprised me with how cleanly it shaved me, with only one pass. I thought the original was great, I guess the technology just keeps improving, as this did just as good as a blade.</li>
    <li> While this shaver does a good job, it does not match up to my older Braun, It gets the job done, but it takes a few more passes to get there. It seems like the motor is less powerful, which may explain its excellent run time between charges. Guys with heavy beards may want to look elsewhere. Overall quality and feature/price ratio is good - 4 stars.</li>
    <li> This shaver is exactly what I wanted and needed... Basic... No waterproof shaving in the shower needed. Close shaves and long battery life.</li>
    <li> I bought this mostly to trim my moustache and sideburns, and for the occasional quick shave. Unfortunately, at least for my beard, it really doesn&#x27;t do a close shave. But it is great for trimming.</li>
    <li> Smooth shave always. I have a goatee and I can maneuver around and keep a perfect shape. Battery lasts a long time.</li>
    <li> Yeah its the kittens mittens, that means its a good shaver, beats my panasonic, but then it was made in China, they don&#x27;t  have facial hair anyway do they?</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t bother buying the costly shaver this one will do the job just right. The features on the costly shavers are mostly useless.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a shaver that could do all the things the big shavers do. I found it with the Braun 320S-4 Wet Dry, Pop Up Trimer ect.</li>
    <li> Works pretty well. Must charge every 4-5 days. Wished it gave a smoother shave but it&#x27;s good.</li>
    <li> Great shave and easy to clean.</li>
    <li> I purchased this shaver after using an older model Braun for the last 4 years. I opted for this model since I didn&#x27;t want the cleaning system that some of the other models use. All I can say is I really like this shaver - significant improvement over my older model - I think Braun is the best out there. Close shave, great battery life - no complaints.</li>
    <li> product as described, but does not come with the cleaner as shown in the picture. came in 1 day earlier than expected.</li>
    <li> well. I don&#x27;t know&lt;br /&gt;it&#x27;s hard to say good or bad. but&lt;br /&gt;it&#x27;s not working good.</li>
    <li> I had an old Braun 5614 that lasted for 10 years.  The battery died some time ago but I used it corded for the last 4 or so years, until finally the contacts got too corroded to charge.  This one is such a huge improvement that I can&#x27;t believe it took me this long to get a new one.  The biggest thing is that it&#x27;s quiet - I can shave now without waking the whole neighborhood.  It also works much faster; I think the flexible foils allow it to actually use both of them at the same time, whereas the fixed ones on my old one didn&#x27;t.  Even on longer growth it just burns through.  I was a little worried that those might also not be able to get as close, but they do.  One final thing is that the debris stays almost entirely within the head.  My old one would spray chopped up whiskers all over, so you pretty much had to shave over the sink or a piece of newspaper.  This one drops almost nothing, so you can shave anywhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had a Remington before, and tried other people&#x27;s Panasonic and Norelco shavers.  None are anywhere close to this one in combination of noise, closeness, and neatness.  I&#x27;ve only had it for three weeks, but I still haven&#x27;t run down the battery, so it&#x27;s winning on that front as well.</li>
    <li> I love this shaver. I&#x27;ve had Norelco rotary shavers and Remington foil shavers. Foil shavers definitely will give you a closer shaver.&lt;br /&gt;The problem with the Remington, after a while if you don&#x27;t inspect the foil, it has a tendency to tear and will cut your face. This Braun has warning light that will come on letting you know when to change the head, hopefully the foil will not tear before then if at all. This is my first Braun shaver and so far it has been great and completely satisfied.</li>
    <li> This shaver gives nce close and comfortable shaves. I like the fact that i can still use it while it&#x27;s charging.</li>
    <li> Great shaver, charge lasts longer than my old shaver.  I actually bought a second one to keep at our condo.</li>
    <li> Works well for a quick shave.  I do have to go back and clean up strays with a razor though.</li>
    <li> I like the shaver.  Only reason for less than 5 stars is this:  the electrical cord does not fit tight in the shaver.  I wrapped black electrical tape around the end of cord, and now it fits tight. Without the tape fix, it was impossible to use the shaver when it was plugged in and the charging operation was unreliable.  Amusing to find the special insert that says &amp;#34;WARNING:  only use the special cord set provided with the appliance&amp;#34;.  Heck - I could use the cord from my old Braun shaver, and it fits perfectly!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always have good luck with Braun shavers but was disappointed that the plastic dust cap would not stay in place.  Since I planned to travel with it some, I&#x27;m returning it.</li>
    <li> I decided to try a Braun Series 3 shaver after seeing a TV ad. Prior to that, I had always used a Reningtom MS-2 type shaver and been satisfied. After a long comparison, I believe that the Braun is over-rated and I encourage you to give both a try. You&#x27;ll probably come to the same conclusion.</li>
    <li> Last Braun purchased in 1988. This new one is much quiter and shaves equally as the old. A great buy for the money. No case included with this model. Would definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> High quality unit. Takes more passes than rotary to get consistent shave.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a good razor if you are looking for a basic inexpensive electric razor with no frills.  The battery life seems real good.</li>
    <li> Have had this shaver for two years now and never felt it did as good a job as my old Braun 1775.....until now. Despite the instructions to the contrary,one day I washed my face first and kept it wet during shaving. WOW, what a difference. Instead of pushing the skin it simply slid across my face and took the whiskers with it. If you haven&#x27;t tried it wet, give it a shot. No more 5 o&#x27;clock shadow and shaving time has been cut in half. Definitely a 5 star performer.</li>
    <li> I bought it for my husband, he loves it so much.</li>
    <li> Wonderful, close shave!  Very pleased with this razor, it is everything one would want in a razor with a very good price!</li>
    <li> I used to get razer burn every time I shaved and now I have a nice smooth face and it doesn&#x27;t sting or burn.</li>
    <li> I have been using the older 1 series for the past 7 years without any problem. Felt that it&#x27;s time for me to change a new shaver and found this shaver which is able to charge and shave at the same time. The shave is way better than my old brain and much quieter.</li>
    <li> Close, comfortable shave.  Works as advertised.  I&#x27;ve seen some reviews stating that it worked well for a few shaves and then didn&#x27;t shave closely.  That has not been my experience.  I bought one years and years ago and was so satisfied, having given it hard use and a lot of international traveling, that I bought another one.</li>
    <li> This 3 series shaver is a big improvement over  the older ones. I like the floating heads, the blinking status light to let you know the state of the battery, and when it needs recharged. Another great feature is the ability to use the charge unit with the cord to shave in case you forgot to charge the unit, and the battery has run down. Great shaver for the money!</li>
    <li> Wow, this was a shocker.  I had the &amp;#34;better&amp;#34; Braun unit with more features for 10 years (it has a cleaner/docking station) and it finally just needed to be replaced.  I took a chance with this one.  The first time I used it I thought it wasn&#x27;t working...because I could hardly hear the loud buzz I was accustomed to over the last 10 years and the feel to the skin was so soft, how could anything actually be happening?  It shaves better than my craziest imagination - buy this little gem, charge lasts forever and it&#x27;s super lite!  Well done Braun!</li>
    <li> My son is very pleased with his razor.</li>
    <li> Christmas gift for husband.  What can I say? It&#x27;s a guy thing.</li>
    <li> I have been a Braun customer for more than 20 years and find the quality exceptional. My current 7 Series  shaver is bulky for travel and this 3 Series compliments it for that purpose. The 320S-4 is a very good light weight product, delivers a close comfortable shave and can be used with an AC electrical plug if the battery dies while on the road. Great shaver and rivals my 7 Series,</li>
    <li> gift for son...well-received, close, comfortable shave w/o irritation.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never had closer shaves than I get from Braun products. The problem with them is they have to be replaced before they should because they fall apart. This particular model hasn&#x27;t fallen apart on me yet, but the head does pop off at times (during normal operation) and end up on the floor, so I fully expect it to break beyond repair fairly soon. I&#x27;ve had similar experiences with at least 3-4 other Braun shavers. They&#x27;re very reasonably prices, but I&#x27;d rather pay double for products that work as well, but last.</li>
    <li> This is a darn fine razor, especially for the price... mine came with a charge, which surprised me a little, but plugged it in for a few hours to make sure it was topped off... I have had good luck going from a full charge to dead battery before the first re-charge...  the first shave, I was very impressed... this is a close have with no irritation... seems to work best after dampening my skin, I don&#x27;t lather up, if I did, I would use a regular razor... I looked all over and based on the reviews bought this one... and it IS a winner... for around $60, you can&#x27;t go wrong!</li>
    <li> I would say that the Braun 320s-4 was about what I expected - a basic entry level shaver with the quality reputation of a Braun.</li>
    <li> I love this shaver. I bought it as a second unit to have at work and I think it works better than my 5 series Braun, which I use at home.</li>
    <li> This was a replacement for my norelco which started to act up after blade change. It shaves me closer then the Norelco ever did and using a little of the Joe Black gel makes for a close smooth shave.</li>
    <li> A great Brauns Deal! I looked every where, but bought it here!  Braun is the only shaver that works for me, i highly recamend it !</li>
    <li> great product but deceptive advertising, should not show cleaning station if not included or state it clearly it is not included</li>
    <li> Works great! Nice close shave.</li>
    <li> It says in the instructions to use a 90 degree angle while shaving. It doesn&#x27;t matter what angle your using it does not shave well. And on top of that it cuts your face!</li>
    <li> Bought this at Target after my old Norelco quit running.  Looked at several shavers.  Some were very cool looking but I&#x27;m an old guy and I like simple.  This one is simple, very simple.  Built very solid with form flollowing function.  The motor runs strong.  Gives me a good dry shave in less then 2 minutes. No mess.  Has a plastic snap on shield for travel to protect the head.  A simple cord for charging (don&#x27;t want another stand on the counter or in the travel bag}. It looks like an electric shaver tank and I suspect over the long  haul it will perform like one.</li>
    <li> I recently purchased this razor at [A STORE] because I wanted it the same day and it happened to be the same price.  This razor is an excellent item for me because I have sensitive skin and its much easier on my face than the razor blades were.  On some of the longer hair there is some pulling but not too crazy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;Cuts as close, if not closer than a razor&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t cut my skin or leave razor burn&lt;br /&gt;Light weight and easy to clean&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;Not perfect on the under-chin/neck area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As much as I would like to have given this razor a 5 star review, unfortunately, no matter how many directions I use this razor, it doesn&#x27;t get all the hair on my neck or under my chin.  Because of this, I will typically use a razor lightly just to touch up any spots that the razor couldn&#x27;t get.  Hopefully it gets better.</li>
    <li> This is a very good shaver for the price.  I would much rather use a 5 of 7 series braun, but can&#x27;t justify paying 2 to 3 times more for one of those.  This one does the job well but a 5 series gives a slightly closer shave.  Also, I have tried a Norelco for a month, and it never gave me as good of a shave as this braun shaver.  I know everyone is different, but I don&#x27;t see how the 3 rotating blades on a Norelco system can ever give as good of a shave as the Braun system, especially around the chin and near the sideburns.</li>
    <li> shaves close. way better than my norelco. charges fast&lt;br /&gt;it also works with the power cord if batter is dead.</li>
    <li> Totally not acceptable. It has been returned for refund.  Too many flaws to list.</li>
    <li> Works very well.  Quiet, close shave.  No problem so far.</li>
    <li> I got this shaver 2 years ago to replace an older model braun. This model is similar to my previous one and I am equally satisfied with it. I appreciate the waterproof design, it makes cleaning much easier.</li>
    <li> This is my 4th Braun shaver in 25 years, and all have been fantastic, Braun continues to innovate with each generation of shaver, and this one is no different.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: EXCELLENT shave, noticeable from the moment it touched my face. Quiet, close, and no stubble dust afterward. Box says wet/dry, but I already have a shower mirror, so will only be using this dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shaver feels great in the hand, the power button seems logical, with an indicator for charging/power levels.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: The plastic cover is absolutely cheap, and pops off. Sub-standard for a Braun product. I was really surprised (and my lone reason for not rating a 5-star product).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, a great shaver, if you are a Braun fan, you will not be disappointed.</li>
    <li> My husband loves this razor.  He has been using it for over 6 months now and it is still going strong.  His only complaint was he wishes the cord was longer, he can&#x27;t really shave if it is plugged in at the time.</li>
    <li> I have bought this shaver elsewhere and had to pay significantly more as I needed it the same day; they price on Amazon is really good. The shaver itself works well by providing a smooth, close shave without leaving the skin irritated. I recommend this product!</li>
    <li> many years ago I used an electric razor and I gave up due to burning. I came back to the electric when I heard good things about the Braun line. This shaver provides a comfortable, close shave at an affordable price.</li>
    <li> Had to use multiple times &amp; still did NOT get a clean shave or cut all facial hair!!! Not to mention my neck break out, due to having going over it over and over again... Tried to use it twice doing everything I could, but it just did \\&quot;NOT CUT IT\\&quot;!</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t like, sent it back. Could not get this shaver to shave well at all, had to go over and over again, still didn&#x27;t get close shave. Have old Panasonic single shaves better and closer.</li>
    <li> I have used a number of Braun electric shavers.  The 3 Series, is larger and heaver than my favorite the 1 Series. The #3 is quieter, but being larger and heaver, I may not use it for travel.  The plastic head guard does not remain on and this adds to the travel disadvantage-maybe I just received a defective one.</li>
    <li> I have used many electric shavers over the years.  I have always had to use shave cream and a blade at least once per week because no matter how hard I tried, the other electric razors just wouldn&#x27;t shave the hard to reach areas.  The first time I used this razor I knew it was different.  It gives a clean, close shave and is the easiest to clean of all the razors I have owned.  I think each person&#x27;s beard is different, but this one works for me and I no longer use a blade to \\&quot;clean up\\&quot; what the electric has missed.</li>
    <li> I replaced my last Braun with another brand,,,,,,,,,, bad mistake! Tried to save a little money. After six months of tearing the beard out of my face with the other inferior brand, I bought another Braun. From now on, it&#x27;s Braun or nothing!!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> While slightly more expensive than other shavers in the bottom pricing tier of shavers, it is clearly superior.  I had tried lower end Remington and Pansonic shavers and found both brands to deliver poor shaves (took a long time of shaving to deliver what certainly was not a close shave of one-day&#x27;s growth of an admittedly heavy beard).  In marked contrast, the Braun 3 Series 320S-4 delivers a more than satisfactory shave.  The shave is slightly less close than a blade, but certainly faster and more convenient.  The weight in the hand is good.  The total shaving time per full charge is as advertised.  It shaves fairly closely on curving surfaces.  The edger blade is good with stray hairs.  Well worth the extra bucks compared to the low-end competitors and a good value in and of itself.</li>
    <li> Braun makes excellent products. I have several, from coffee makers to   this razor. They all work very well and are an excellent value. The heads on this do a much better  job than my previous Norelco and Remington.</li>
    <li> Fast delivery, exactly as advertised.&lt;br /&gt;Have used this shaver for a few months now, holds a charge for a long time, recharges quickly.&lt;br /&gt;Shave quality is good,comfortable.</li>
    <li> I previously used a more expensive Panasonic. I feel this is better quality and easier to clean.  I no longer support Japan, the nation that slaughters whales.</li>
    <li> I bought a 1150 for my father and it was cost me about $60, and I bought the Braun shaver for myself and its only $35, and I compared them, I found the Braun is much better than 1150. Great I recommended Everone to buy it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had several Braun shavers.  This is by far the worst I&#x27;ve had.  The first one quit working and you had to replace it, the new one is exactly the same as the first when it still worked, not worth the price and does not honor the brand at all.  Noisy, harsh, does not shave well, a real loser, for me at least</li>
    <li> It is fast and working well after 2 months. Charges well and way better than the Panasonic models I tried.</li>
    <li> most comfortable shaver I have ever owned. this was a replacement for the Norelco shaver that I had used previously. The comfort of this shaver is fantastic.</li>
    <li> Good shaver. Replaces an old Braun.</li>
    <li> I like the idea of the middle cutter to easily cut some of the longer hair. I would definitely recommend this razor to anyone looking for a well balanced razor and that is really pretty quiet.</li>
    <li> The long hair trimmer on this Braun shaver is amazing! I had used a dif. brand name shaver that had a long hair trimmer as well, but it was awful! it was not pleasant when it kept snagging/pulling on my hairs and did a poor job shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Braun, however, is the best I have ever used and I love the long hair trimmer has on it! it is shaves with ease. trimmer is pain free and quickly removes long hairs</li>
    <li> If you are well care taker of your personal items and want to buy affordable shaver this is right choice..it maintains the reputation of the company and gives near to perfect shave...</li>
    <li> I liked the razor, it did not cut the hairs on my neck very well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would say it was average.</li>
    <li> I thought I would try an electric razor after using a blade for the last twenty years. After a month of using I am going back to a blade as it gives a much closer shave.</li>
    <li> #1 son loves his. #1 husband (80 yrs old) likes it, he has a tought grey (white) beard and must shave more often. I say they (the shavers, ok...the Brauns are great!)</li>
    <li> I have been a  Braun user for years and with the purchase of this razor I see no reason to change my mind. I&#x27;m 83 years old and have used Braun razors for probably close to 50 years. The last 2 razors I&#x27;ve had were model 3612 and I have 2 to dispose of now since they are no longer available. The model 320S 4 I have now gives a very comfortable close shave and I&#x27;m sure I will continue to  be very pleased.  Bill Willis</li>
    <li> After using rotary shavers like Norelco, for a number of years, I was frustrated with the marginal shave they provide, due to a fairly stiff beard. I switched to a Braun 4600 about 10 years ago and it worked wonderfully. Although I had to replace the shaving foil (screen) and blade assembly about every 18 months, due to wear, it had been very reliable. So 10 years is pretty impressive. Well, it finally went out on me. The battery would no longer hold a charge and when it gets to that state, the direct current by cord will not power it up. Took it to Interstate batteries who can generally change rechargeable batteries in just about anything, but they said due to the closed nature of this system (being able to submerse in water to clean the head) they can&#x27;t access and change the battery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So it was time to trash it, and after that impressive time frame, and the fact that it gives a much closer shave than rotaries, there was no doubt that I would replace it with another Braun in the low price end of their line up. Checked Wally World (WM) for this model and they wanted 20 dollars more than direct purchase from Amazon. No brainer. Done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Took my first shave with it yesterday and it is smooth as glass, sliding over the face. Although I must admit that I topped off the shave with a single dry stroke of a double blade razor against the grain, to get the glass smooth finish on my skin. By the way, the it is best to shave with the Braun, before hitting the shower or cleaning the face. That is recommended by Braun, probaby because the oils on your skin, kind of lubricate the skin surface and the stiffer whiskers tend to stand up better for the screen and cutters to catch them, than they do when softened in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only negative on this model is no hard clamshell style case like my earlier Braun to protect it in transit. Although there is a clear plastic snap-on guard to protect the shaver head. But the same snap on guard on my first Braun, clipped over the sides of the head and in fairly short order failed (one of the snap edges cracked through stress of use, rendering the guard inoperable) so I was glad I had the hard case for suitcase and travel, because the micro screen that catches whiskers and protects the skin from blade abrasion, is by nature and design, very thin and delicate. Hitting it against anything will chip a hole in the screen and make it useless.  And that was the cause of 3 or 4 screen replacements over 10 years, so I learned to be very careful with the screen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is a good idea when purchasing a Braun, to always have a backup screen and blade set for those unpredictable moments. I always keep a spare on hand so I don&#x27;t have to wait for online replenishment, to get back into action. In the past I have purchased those parts on Amazon from Goodman&#x27;s who were fairly priced. But I see now that Amazon has direct fulfillment of same.

    <li> Never leaves ingrown hairs, never misses spots, but doesn&#x27;t get as close as the Remington Microscreens.  The Remingtons were the closest shavers ever, but were painful &amp; very time consuming to get every missed spot.  It took 30 minutes to get every spot smooth with the Remington.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Braun whacks off every last hair in 15 minutes.  It always leaves a slight roughness, no matter how hard you try, but it never leaves hairs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The improvement in speed &amp; efficiency has outweighed the loss in closeness.  Waking up with rough cheeks has been more bearable than discovering ingrown hairs.</li>
    <li> After years of using a Panasonic, decided to switch to Braun.  It&#x27;s new, so for now it holds the charge o&#x27;k.  As for a close shave, I still think that a Panasonic does a better job. When this one goes, I&#x27;ll switch back.</li>
    <li> After opening the box to see whether I need to charge the shaver for tomorrow, I have to say that the device looks and feels solid.  It also hums convincingly.  On the other hand, there is no manual.  To my mind, that omission is somewhere between unfortunate and ridiculous.  Certainly there may not be a great deal to fathom about a razor, but basic customer service would seem to suggest inclusion of a manual in all but a throw-away razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, I did read the various announcements of the box; they tend to be advertisements.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also have checked the Braun website, but have not found this model listed.  Now that&#x27;s puzzling.  I guess I will need to write Braun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Having obtained a manual and used the razor a couple of times, I am ready to write my initial impressions of the product:  in short, it has brawn!!! It more than meets what I expected from it, based on the glowing reviews I found here on Amazon.  Now, I do not have anything close to a lumberjack&#x27;s beard.  That said, the old whiskers still somehow seemed to escape the electric I was using at times.  (Though, to tell the truth, it is a corded model I bought locally during the last \\&quot;boil water\\&quot; situation, which was occasioned by a tropical storm.  It seemed to work okay, but the cord kept escaping -- poor product design on a very elemental level.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, I have never previously seen a shaver that reduced whiskers to something like powder.  Great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shaver seems to be built around a fairly substantial motor, and the cutting parts are modular, making changing them easy I hope.  Certainly cleaning is easy.  The shave is extremely close without pinching.  Right now the thing is new; the shave is like that from a blade.  I imagine it will become less close over time, since that&#x27;s a given of electrics.  Also, since my toothbrush is a Braun and has held up for years, I&#x27;m looking forward to having this razor for quite some time.  All in all, pretty amazing.  Needlessto say, I&#x27;ve raised my rating a wee bit.</li>
    <li> This unit works significantly better for me than my previous Braun 1-head shaver - much gentler and quieter, though its greater bulk and weight took some getting used to.  Fairly easy to clean.  The trimmer works OK but isn&#x27;t quite as effective as others I&#x27;ve used.  This shaver runs on AC power if the battery is low, unlike otherwise comparable Panasonic models I considered, and the compact universal power supply requires only a plug adapter to use in other countries.</li>
    <li> This shaver provides a very close and comfortable shave. It quickly removes hair without pulling or irritation. It&#x27;s easy to clean and a red indicator tells you when to recharge. Great shave at a reasonable price.</li>
    <li> My friend loves this product.  It works with the cord plugged in which is a nice feature if you need it.  Gives a great shave.</li>
    <li> For over thirty years I have owned and used a Braun 5422 Electric Razor.  Only once during this time did it require service.  Well it finally stopped working.  I called Braun and asked them for a suitable replacement and they recommended the 3 Series 320S.  I took their recommendation and bought it.  First thing I noticed is that it is no longer made in Germany but like most everything else it&#x27;s made in China.  It has the look and feel of something cheap that you&#x27;d expect from China.  As far as operationally speaking it&#x27;s average and that&#x27;s being kind.  How does it shave - so, so.  Even my original Braun shaved better as it was on it&#x27;s last legs then the new one.  I have to go over my beard several times to get the smaller hairs that this new Braun misses.  It has a 60 day return policy and I&#x27;m sure I will take advantage of it.  Sad how things have fallen from quality to inferior products.</li>
    <li> I use it to shave my head and it works great. Really does a good job even if I&#x27;ve not shaved for several days, gets the longer hairs with no problem. Much better than my previous 2 blade razor which would just passover longer hairs and never cut them.. It is also very comfortable to use and seems to hold a charge forever. i was a little skeptical because of the low price but couldn&#x27;t be happier with the performance. Glad I made the purchase.</li>
    <li> it is good, only the pakage is so simple that it is something like a cheap one, they should pay more attention on it</li>
    <li> Replaced my older Braun, and worried that it wouldn&#x27;t give as good of a shave as the entire shaver head swivels on my old one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But, on this one, the shaver stays stationary and the head itself swivel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Works great.  Much better than my old Braun, even with a new replacement head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I doubt any shaver will get every single hear on the neck.  This comes very close, but I keep a regular rasor blade for those few hairs that refuse to be shaved.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They had such great pricing (only $20 more than the replacement head cost), so ... I bought another as a spare.</li>
    <li> Fairly good razor for the price. Bought it because my very expensive Norelco  has a trimmer that is too small. I have a thick mustache and can not get a straight line using the smaller trimmers. My previous Braun shavers all had a wide mustache trimmer. This razor&#x27;s trimmer is wider than the other brands but still narrower than the older Braun models.</li>
    <li> Look and feel of this shaver is nice. Holds charge very good. When it comes to performance, I&#x27;ll say okay. It cuts, but sometimes misses and needs few iterations.</li>
    <li> My wife bought me a 1-Series shaver as a gift.  Unfortunately, it was junk.  I returned it for a 3-Series.  The difference is night and day.  The 3-Series has a dual-head with a center trimmer that cuts the long hairs as you shave.  This is essential, and was missing on the 1-Series.  The 3-Series also has much less vibration, and feels hefty and solid in your hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sure you can spend a lot more for a Braun, but I have found this to be all I need and a great replacement for my 10 year old Braun 5328.</li>
    <li> This was a replacement for my trusty Braun 209, by far the best shaver I&#x27;ve ever owned. The flash sale made the 320S very attractive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not all faces are the same: my own beard is medium, skin sensitive. A typical shave is once over with the electric, then clean up (especially jowls and neck) with a blade. I&#x27;ve never gotten a satisfactory shave with electric alone, but find starting with the blade leads to irritation and cuts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The 320S is a fully satisfactory shaver. The shave is closer than others (Norelco, Panasonic, Remington) I&#x27;ve tried, with no irritation. The shaver recharges quickly. The trimmer is effective on sideburns. The shaver feels solid and substantial.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: not as close a shave as the 209; the placement of the on-off button requires I grip oddly high on the shaver to avoid unexpectedly turning off in mid-shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t owned the 320S long enough to know how long the shaving head and foil last. Those of the 209 lasted for years.&lt;br /&gt;In sum, I&#x27;m happy with the 320S, but &amp;#34;you never forget your first love.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> It is a big improvement over my old Norelco!</li>
    <li> Had this about 11 months now.  It was a decent replacement for my old Braun shaver (5412) for the most part.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The closeness of the shave is good.  For the last six months, though, the &amp;#34;triple action&amp;#34; cutting system gives sharp tugs on longer hairs that are present after a weekend.  This is quite painful!  I think the cutter that is between the two foils is dull or something else is going on.  All I know is that I have to shave with the grain to get my hairs short enough so that center cutter isn&#x27;t used.  This is not as good as the previous shaver I had, which was something like a 5412, which had a similar cutting device that worked for many years without issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As of this month, the &amp;#34;precision&amp;#34; cutting tool for sideburns and mustaches seems to have something loose inside the shaver - it rattles loudly unless I hold it in place.  If it continues, I may have to take advantage of the warranty - which I never would have expected from Braun.</li>
    <li> Braun has always had an excellent reputation for making&lt;br /&gt;quality product, especially shavers. However, I was a disappointed&lt;br /&gt;that it&#x27;s no longer made in Germany......China, where else!!</li>
    <li> Been using Braun razors for a long time and love them. It is nice that the replacement blades are only 29 bucks.</li>
    <li> I have been a Braun series 5000 user for almost a decade and bought a series 3 shaver from Woot as a replacement. It malfunctioned after three uses - not from a broken part but from bad design. Instead of the prior designs that exposed the razor blades when the head/foils were removed, the series 3 has an integrated head that includes foils and razors. Unfortunately, the friction fit that holds this head on is quite weak. All it took for me to pop it off (each of the three times I used it) was to have slightly wet skin. That&#x27;s enough to increase the friction to pop off the head. That&#x27;s an annoyance but not a deal killer. The problem I had is that on the third shave, the head popped off and I lost one of the small black spring retainers on the main unit. Now, only one of the razors in the unit works - the other one drags on my hair and pulls them out (painful). It now gives the worst shave I&#x27;ve ever gotten and I can&#x27;t seem to find any way to replace that small black plastic piece. In my opinion, the easy pop-off head is a bad idea. But even worse is using a small plastic spring retainer that can be lost so easily. Probably my last Braun purchase. Buyer beware...</li>
    <li> I like the razor. Itt is high quality. It replaced a higher priced Braun that had a cleaning station and charging unit. This razor is the same physical shape and configuration as the higher level Braun model and the charging station works but the cleaning portion of the razor station will not work.</li>
    <li> Does not give you a close shave. I have owned several Brauns over the years and was disappointed with this model.</li>
    <li> Decent enough shaver however not quite as efficient as the much less expensive Remington shaver it replaced. I have to go over and over the same spot just to get a fair amount of smoothness. I get about 6 to 7 shaves off of a full charge which is not unacceptable but less than I&#x27;m accustomed to. I&#x27;ve owned several Braun shavers in the past and they have been excellent, however the 320S has been below my moderate expectations.</li>
    <li> Best shaver I ever had</li>
    <li> Just great. Holds a charge for long time. Quality shave from a well built razor. Thought my old Braun was good but this is an improved product.</li>
    <li> Eisenhower was in the White House and a new &#x27;59 Galaxie was in the driveway when a Braun shaver first touched my cheeks and I haven&#x27;t strayed since.  Actually, that&#x27;s a little misleading.  Braun shavers in those days were sold in the US as Ronsons.  Ronson was a company better known for its cigarette lighters.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even though I was but a little shaver myself when I first began the daily mowing ritual, I appreciated the Braun&#x27;s functional design and thought that it would provide a closer shave than my father&#x27;s rotary Norelco.  I was right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; About ten years ago, though, I felt that Braun and I were beginning to take each other for granted - not uncommon in long-term relationships.  The Braun I bought then seemed cheapened and didn&#x27;t perform like I&#x27;d come to expect.  I felt strangely attracted to Norelco or even Panasonic.  But then I thought better and decided to give Braun another chance with the 320S-4, and I&#x27;m glad I did.  This model is very good and I think our relationship is permanently repaired.  Its goodness is somewhat surprising given its lowly status in the Braun hierarchy with 500 and 700 series models costing multiples of its price - not to mention that this part of Braun was wooed and won by Gillette and then swallowed up by Procter and Gamble.  Nonetheless, the 320 looks and feels like a quality product, shaves well, and has the best trimmer I&#x27;ve experienced.  I would&#x27;ve happily paid a little more if it had come with a case, however.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Four-and-a-half stars, but in view of the good times we&#x27;ve shared, I&#x27;ll round up to five.</li>
    <li> Having tried out other brands, I finally came back to the brand I used for my very first shavings. Braun was and is the leading brand in shavers, I can&#x27;t write more! Compared price and performance it&#x27;s the best shaver I ever bought.</li>
    <li> Bought this to replace a ten year old shaver and has lived up to all my expectations. Haven&#x27;t tried the wet function yet because I just use it to trim around my beard right now.</li>
    <li> I have only been use my Braun for about 3 weeks so far.  It gives a very close shave, with no iritation, it is easy to clean and only takes about an hour to recharge.  I don&#x27;t see how anyone could go wrong with this shaver for the price.</li>
    <li> So far it is working great. I am a female who bought it for bikini area. Works just as I wanted. Fast and nice close shave so I don&#x27;t have to use a razor. No shave bumps or nicks. Very quiet as well. And easy to clean. I love it.</li>
    <li> As expected from Braun, a very good shaver with attractive price (thank you Amazon), I recommend it for smart people who are looking for optimum price/performance products.</li>
    <li> I used to have a Braun shaver.  When I needed a new one I bought a Panasonic.  Within two years the Panasonic was holding a charge for only 2-3 days.  So I decided to give up on it and buy a new one.  I decided to go back to Braun with the 320s.  I have not regretted it for a moment.  It is a great shaver: very close and lasting shaves.  The first time I used it I got 11 shaves before I had to recharge.  I don&#x27;t particularly like the angle of the sideburn trimmer but it does the job and I will get used to that.  Excellent all around.</li>
    <li> I have purchased several Braun shavers over the years and most of them have been more than adequate.  This one also does the trick, but the blades seem to dull more quickly than others, and replacement parts are expensive.</li>
    <li> Bought Panasonic ES8103 instead.  This is cheapest model and rightly so.  At one time the price of both were almost the same because of instant coupon clipper.  Don&#x27;t usually leave review, too lazy but this one I&#x27;d have the passion to leave my mark.  This shaver does not irritate but I have used razor for many years and felt this shaver after shaving still ask me to revisiting many places that it was unable to provide clean shaved.  So I had to go back to a few places with my razor, I am wondering why then do I need this shaver.</li>
    <li> ...and I really liked my last one but it was 12+ years old and the battery was getting weak and&lt;br /&gt; the foil head was dull.  This one is head and shoulders above my old one.  My favorite things:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*The grip is rubberized and holds firmly in hand.  No more dropsies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Each cutting head and the center long hair cutter pivot completely independently rather than one big unit.  It follows my face and neck contours with ease.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*It holds a charge for a really long time.  I haven&#x27;t logged it exactly but for my shaving it lasts a week to ten days before the charge light starts blinking (and would still probably shave for a few more days).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*The sideburn/moustache trimmer is angled 90 degrees away from the shaver and works SO much better than the one that points straight up.  It cuts long hairs to the skin and then a quick breeze over with the foil head and done.  It also works perfectly when I do my wife&#x27;s swimsuit line with no pulling or ouching.  She loves it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*It comes with a plastic protector that snaps over the foil cutting head even though it&#x27;s not listed as \\&quot;in the box\\&quot;.  I almost bought the 380s for $35 more to get the travel pouch since the foil head is susceptible to luggage/travel damage.  With the money I saved, I bought a spare cutting head and still spent 15 bucks less.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I can see that the 320 doesn&#x27;t do that the more expensive models do is allow wet shaving.  I&#x27;ve never tried it or felt the need since my reason for a shaver vs blade was to get away from the morning mess.  Dry shaving is a breeze.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If this one lasts anywhere near as long as my previous one, I&#x27;d rate it one of my best purchases ever.  Happy as can be with it!</li>
    <li> Holds good charge, gives a smooth shave, and is easy to clean.</li>
    <li> this shaver is easy to use, don&#x27;t be in a big hurry while shaving , I was trying to shave to fast when I started to use it. Then I slowed down and my results got better. works very well...</li>
    <li> This is clearly the best shaver and the best price.  It shaves so smoothly and quickly I&#x27;m ready to order again for a gift to a friend.  Highly recommended and fast delivery</li>
    <li> Threw away my Norelco.This is a great razor for the price. Not as close as a razor and shave cream, but close..</li>
    <li> Perhaps I&#x27;m doing something wrong, but after using this shaver for several months now I&#x27;m starting to dread my shaves, which typically are 4-5 days apart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even when applying lighter pressure to avoid this, it tends to pull on the hairs and/or pinch the skin in the process. Shaving the neck area is also impossible with this razor alone, as it leaves plenty of hair behind, so I still have to combine with a manual razor hybrid approach.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would love to hear if anyone else is having similar issues and what they&#x27;ve done to deal with it. I clean it mostly manually, though sometimes rinse under water and oil.</li>
    <li> Please help me. I dont know very well english and i have a problem with this machine. I bought it from this web site. But i couldnt take charge machine from electric razor. I am using both always .</li>
    <li> I have been using the shaver for 3 weeks now. It performs fine. The shave is not as close as an older single foil Braun shaver I had many years ago, but no shaver burns either. I&#x27;d recommend it to anyone who does not grow a jungle on their face.</li>
    <li> This is the third Braun shaver I&#x27;ve purchased.  I also own a Norelco.  The Braun 3Series give a much closer shave than the Norelco (and previous Brauns).  It is also much quieter than previous Brauns. I have been pleasently surprised by the performence of the Braun 3Series 320S.</li>
    <li> The Braun 320S-4 is the simplest (and cheapest) version of the Series 3 shavers. It can be used as a corded shaver, a plus when the battery is rundown and you need to use it. It&#x27;s simple to clean manually and doesn&#x27;t require a clunky charging or cleaning stand. The shaver gives a good, close shave and seems durable. Not much more you can ask for.</li>
    <li> LOOKED IN SEVERAL STORES IN MY AREA.  COULDN&#x27;T FIND THE SHAVER, OUT OF STOCK ETC.&lt;br /&gt;ORDERED IT ON LINE AND HAD IT DELIVERED TO MY HOME IN FOUR DAYS.&lt;br /&gt;SHOULD HAVE DONE THAT IN THE FIRST PLACE AND SAVED THE GAS.</li>
    <li> Shaver is ok. Caused major razor burn on the neck area. Not expected from a mechanical shaver. However on a good note the side clipper worked pretty decent.</li>
    <li> I got it for my husband, he likes it. I have used other Braun products as well. Braun never fails me and they keep up thier brand name.</li>
    <li> As all Braun products this one is again very good and the price was even better. My husband really likes it.</li>
    <li> Isn&#x27;t as good as the older models (what is?) Good price and a good starter razor. Probably wont work good on tough beards.</li>
    <li> This was a Christmas gift for my husband. He loves it and because it is lightweight, he will take it with him when he travels.</li>
    <li> The Braun 320S-4 is a really excellent product.  I don&#x27;t shave in the shower so I didn&#x27;t need the more expensive 3Series 340S.  The 320S is the basic model.  It is quiet, shaves very close, and can be used plugged into a socket or on battery only, a big plus if you take cross country tent camping trips as I do.  The pop up trimmer on the back is very convenient and works well.  I&#x27;m very pleased and would certainly recommend this shaver to others.</li>
    <li> I am very happy with my new razor but I cannot believe why the replacement blade should cost about 75% as much as awhole new razor. The blades for my old Braun cost $28 dollars and the new one was shipped to me for $39 total by Amazon. My old one still works fine but the choice was simple. I guess we do live in a throw away society.</li>
    <li> the item arrived on time,good quality ,it was the one just what I want to give a present for my husband</li>
    <li> This Braun provides a good, close shave. Best electric razor I&#x27;ve used since my Braun 5405 (made in West Germany) slowed down. And, less than I could buy it for locally....thanks Amazon.</li>
    <li> Sort of disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;Been using another Brown shaver [1750, I believe] which apparently is no longer available -&lt;br /&gt;it was quick and easily used.&lt;br /&gt;This 320S has a huge square head, is difficult to manipulate and &amp;#34;strange&amp;#34; to clean.&lt;br /&gt;It takes &amp;#34;forever&amp;#34; to get my shave finished.  Well, I&#x27;ll keep trying, hoping to get better used to it.&lt;br /&gt;Disappointed.</li>
    <li> oh,it&#x27;s very good!!! it&#x27;s very good!!!it&#x27;s very good!!!it&#x27;s very good!!!it&#x27;s very good!!!it&#x27;s very good!!!it&#x27;s very good!!!it&#x27;s very good!!!thanks a lot</li>
    <li> I used Norelco triple-headers for years and years.  I decided to try something new when the battery wouldn&#x27;t hold a charge anymore, and I chose this Braun largely based on the positive reviews.  I was disappointed at the beginning and am still disappointed after six months.  I would have returned it if I hadn&#x27;t purchased it just before a long trip.&lt;br /&gt;The shaver doesn&#x27;t shave as well as a triple-header.  It&#x27;s a close shave but it takes me much longer to get all the whiskers.  I have to shave all parts of my beard over and over.  It&#x27;s even worse if I wait two days before shaving.  This shaver is also significantly noisier than the Norelcos, and the plug into the shaver doesn&#x27;t stay in very well.  I don&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
    <li> So far, this is an excellent razor, shaves much closer and much more smoothly than my 5 year old Braun.  The razor is very precisely and solidly built; I am a little concerned about the reliability and life of the trimmer, but it doesn&#x27;t require much pressure and trims well - I just have to remember to use a light touch.&lt;br /&gt;Have been using &#x27;lectric razors for several decades and this one is far and away the best so far.</li>
    <li> Meh. Pretty mediocre performance and have got closer shaves from other electrics. Certainly no substitute for a wet shave with a razor. Disappointing for this brand which used to have a good name.</li>
    <li> so after using this for a few months, i would recommend this shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;it only took a week for my skin to adjust to this razor.  only had to charge it twice in three months.  (yes i use it daily)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;comfortable in hand.  pretty close shave.  was on sale!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;very happy with buy!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-minus one star for expensive replacement head.</li>
    <li> bought for my Dad (95 years old) first one he has ever had and finds it easy to use - nice close shave also - great buy</li>
    <li> It does awesome job!  I&#x27;m really happy!</li>
    <li> This thing works great.  Close, comfortable, excellent shave.  I&#x27;ve only had it for a few weeks, but it&#x27;s clear it&#x27;s a great item.  My beard is full but fine (meaning not particularly course).  This shaver took care of six days&#x27; growth with no problem.  On a coarser beard it might only cut it (pun intended) for three/four days&#x27; worth.    We&#x27;ll have to see how long it lasts, though.  I say that because this is the fourth Braun foil shaver I&#x27;ve owned... and each has had a shorter lifespan than the one before it.    Granted, the first one was from 1987 or &#x27;88.  Wish I could remember what that model was called.  It was old-school Braun: simple foil (one) that was rounded across the top and didn&#x27;t move or flex to follow your face, cutter block beneath.  Had the pop-up trimmer also (I guess they all do).  Came with a nice case that had little fitted spaces inside for the shaver and the folded-up cord.  One side of the case had a mirror mounted in it.  It was about $80 (1987 or &#x27;88 dollars, of course).  The outside of the unit was actually thin metal (appeared to be brushed aluminum) and had rubber grippy dots on the lower two-thirds.  \\&quot;Made in Germany\\&quot; prominently noted upon it under the top third that snaps off (where the cutter block resides).    It worked really well and lasted for I think 13 years.  Made two trips to an appliance-service joint to have the battery replaced during that time.  I am sharing all this only as illustration that NOTHING is made like it used to be.  Such a shame.  Yet we all have little choice but to accommodate it as best we can.    So, the motor on that one finally died, like I said, after quite a long time.  Braun still made the same thing, only in a \\&quot;newer\\&quot; version (i.e., more cheaply made and not quite as nice).  It was essentially the same thing, although now all black plastic.  No more metal outer skin or rubbery grippy dots, still came with a fitted case (no more mirror though).  Still made in Germany anyway, about the same price as the first one (though I guess actually more, given inflation).  After about eight years and one battery change, it died as well.  At this point I was told by two different appliance-repair joints that the battery is no longer available or even replaceable; the motor and battery are a single unit in the current models.  \\&quot;What can I do?\\&quot; I asked.  \\&quot;Nothing,\\&quot; was the answer.  \\&quot;You just have to buy a whole new shaver.\\&quot;  Great.    Third one was where Braun started making everything both MORE cheaply and MORE complicated.  Excellent!  Not.  This is the one that bit it about a month ago.  It lasted five years, tops.  Cost about $100 at Target, seemed to be a middle-range unit.  Can&#x27;t recall what the model was, but it introduced the \\&quot;dual floating foils with longer-hair trimmer in between\\&quot; scene.  Fine, fine.  Didn&#x27;t seem to work any better than the earlier, single non-moving foil.  Plus replacement foils/blocks were awfully pricey (about $30, whereas foil and block for each of the older ones were less than half that).  The case was now a formless and cheesy zippered pouch (still on hand though, with a pair of small binoculars in it).  Anyway, again, good-performing item, no doubt.  One day it refused to shut off, though.  Somehow or other the switch had broken.  No amount of gentle anything would turn it off.  At length I tried pushing the power button with the corner of the counter in my bathroom.  This ended up just breaking it completely.  But at least it was off.  Into the trash it went.    So, given how each Braun shaver I&#x27;ve owned has lasted LESS time... I figured there was no good reason to go with any of the models above this one.  Those $200 ones with the cleaner-tank thing?  Why on earth?  I have a friend who owns one of those; he&#x27;s convinced that the high-tech cleaner tank doesn&#x27;t do anything to justify its price.  I think there are some that are even more expensive.    I chose the 320-S based on a few things: It&#x27;s washable (though a good blowing out after each use and that plus using the little brush every few uses seems fine, just as with the older ones).  It&#x27;ll work corded or cordless, so if you run out of battery after doing half your face you don&#x27;t have to wait around for a bit charging (not all Brauns will work corded, and why that is is a huge mystery), the power cord adjusts to international voltages by itself (not that I spend a lot of time out of the country, but this will be useful at some point I bet).  Doesn&#x27;t come with a case at all (need to go up a few models for that).  And as some others have noted, the weird and elaborate plastoid \\&quot;cap\\&quot; thingie is junk.  Look at it the wrong way and it will fall off.    One thing that was frustrating was the amount of time I had to spend on the Braun website, figuring out that not all models have the same features here.  It should be easier than it was to figure out.    Bottom line (finally): This shaver works great, and unless you&#x27;re into pricey things for their own sake there seems to be very little reason to spend any more on one of the higher models, especially in that these don&#x27;t seem to last as long as they did a bunch of years ago (but then, what does).  The only exception I can think of is if you prefer to use it wet (this one doesn&#x27;t do that).  The 320-S says \\&quot;Made in China\\&quot; under where the pop-up trimmer slides out.  Well, not everything from China is junky, necessarily, but it&#x27;s still another good reason to assume that this one will not last as long as the others... each of which died sooner, after all.  So we&#x27;ll see.</li>
    <li> My hubby likes it, says it shaves smoothly enough, and it doesn&#x27;t sound like a lawn mower! Great for the price.</li>
    <li> Braun makes the best mens electric shavers hands down. I&#x27;ve never had a problem with this shaver. I get an excellent shave from it.</li>
    <li> I used a Remington MS2-390 razor for the past few years. It was ok, but over time it became less and less effective. This Braun product is infinitely superior. It shaves closer, faster, and much more quietly than the Remington ever did. The battery is good for more than a week on one charge. It&#x27;s comfortable to hold. The cap is well designed and prevents accidental turn on in a suitcase. I really like it. Good value for the money. Highly recommended. ADDENDUM: I&#x27;ve now used it for 6 months. It still shaves very well. I&#x27;ve gotten more than 3 weeks between charges, meaning you can travel without taking the charger. Again, good value for the money.</li>
    <li> I started shaving with a foil razor 50 yrs ago. I went to a Norelco for 40 yrs., and now I wonder why I ever changed. This Braun is the best razor I ever had! Thanks Amazon for the great service!!</li>
    <li> The cord would not stay attached to the base of the charger unless they were really really close together. The cord doesn&#x27;t snap on or stay connected, and if there is any pull at all on the cord, it will detach. Also, after using for a few days, I started getting terrible razor bumps! My regular razor doesn&#x27;t do that to me. Lastly, the shave is not as close as a regular razor, so I always felt like I needed to shave again. And on areas of skin that are curved or I didn&#x27;t stretch the skin tight enough, it would leave stubble. Not cool! This razor went right back to Amazon, who thankfully has the best return policy in the world.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had a lot of razors; this one is ok - cuts nice and close, holds a charge well.  Not amazing, but decent.    Update - it&#x27;s a year later, and the beard trimmer (cheap plastic) failed and eventually fell off.  And this w/ pretty careful handling.    Doesn&#x27;t anyone make a decent shaver anymore?  The plastic construction just doesn&#x27;t hold up.</li>
    <li> I sold it, as I just never was able to get a close shave with it.  Braun used to be my shaver of choice, buy I have been disappointed in newer models.</li>
    <li> I think it is more valve than other expensive shavers,&lt;br /&gt;I like it very much, high quality, good looking,&lt;br /&gt;it is worthy of every coins that you spend.</li>
    <li> I have been using Braun shavers most of my adult life.  They seem to get better and batter; these guys at Braun design a winning shaver, and then they must sit down and plot how they can make it even better.&lt;br /&gt;  This gives a close shave without excoriating even my sensitive skin, I mean so close that one could not tell by feel that I have whiskers at all.  It&#x27;s quieter than any Braun I&#x27;ve had before.  The design is great, easy to use, easy to clean.&lt;br /&gt;  Of course, I cannot comment on the durability of the screen or cutter bar yet; but if they are comparable to other Braun shavers, no complaints here either.  Even the Germans haven&#x27;t figured out how to eliminate metal fatigue!&lt;br /&gt;  Finally, the price of this shaver was downright nostalgic, about what I was paying for the latest Braun shaver a decade or more ago.  What a welcome surprise!</li>
    <li> I  have nothing but good to say about this shaver. All you have to do is ask if I would buy this product again - without hesitation, the answer is YES!!!</li>
    <li> Attached to the body by two tiny plastic hooks are three plastic/spring shafts that drive the replaceable head.  If one of these plastic/spring shafts comes off you are out of luck - buy a new razor.  My new razor will not be a Braun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also - The replaceable head itself is not locally available.  At local stores there are &amp;#34;Series 3&amp;#34; replacement heads sold right next to this same razor.  Not seeing any other series 3 razors, it seemed the right choice.  They look similar but when you get them home it becomes evident they are the wrong ones.</li>
    <li> Bad product (CHEAP). James</li>
    <li> Not as close a shave as some I&#x27;ve had, but a good razor for the price.</li>
    <li> I have been through a series of different trimmers and shavers before I settled on this one. I&#x27;ve tried a few rotary shavers and haven&#x27;t had great success, so I decided to switch to a foil design. My first impression was that it didn&#x27;t pull any hairs, a problem I had with numerous rotary designs. It also was the closest shave other than my conventional razor, granted I primarily use this product on my neck, where I do not want to use my razor. Here&#x27;s my quick pros and cons list:&lt;br /&gt;Pros - Long battery life&lt;br /&gt;  Cuts well after extended use (not sure when I&#x27;ll have to replace the blades)&lt;br /&gt;  Close, smooth shave&lt;br /&gt;  The back trimmer works as designed&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons - Can&#x27;t get it wet&lt;br /&gt;  Although it cuts very close, many times in areas on my neck I had to continuously alternate between the shaver and the&lt;br /&gt;  trimmer portion in order to cut a few hairs.&lt;br /&gt;  The back trimmer is obviously designed for small areas of longer hair, so I wouldn&#x27;t stray to far from the front and back of&lt;br /&gt;  the neck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will continue to use this product until it fails me, hopefully not within a few years. I plan on eventually upgrading, maybe to a Braun 7-series.</li>
    <li> First time out of the box, charged overnight. Next morning I started shaving and I ended up using the precision trimmer for almost the entire shave because the foil could not shave at all. Thought maybe it was because my hair was a little too long for it. Irritating but I could get over that. Few days later, shave again; this time with much less hair. Still had to shave with the trimmer because the foil could not shave at all. But the trimmer works well, preventing me from hating the product.</li>
    <li> These used to be the best electric shavers in the world in my opinion.....until they weren&#x27;t made in Germany. Made in China. Still better than a rotary shaver in my opinion.</li>
    <li> This shaver works perfectly as a replacement for my old Braun Cruzer shaver.  It feels smoother with the 3 blade system, and doesn&#x27;t miss as much hair.  The only downside is the trimmer is awkwardly placed when being used, being pushed out, as opposed to slid up with my old Cruzer razor.  The battery seems to last more than enough time between charges.  All in all, this is a great razor for everyday shaving.</li>
    <li> This was a replacement for a 10 yr old Braun shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It works perfect  and is a great replacement  for my old shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I rate it five stars.</li>
    <li> I have been using the Braun brand razors for many years.  They are simply the best that I have found.  This is a fine razor at a good price.</li>
    <li> This is a great razor.  I love it and it is a snap to clean.  I would not buy anything but Braun.</li>
    <li> Shaver works great for me I wouldn&#x27;t hesitate to buy this model again. Battery last a long time on a charge and shaver shaves close.</li>
    <li> I used it for the first time today and really liked the way it shaved.  I got a nice close shave, though with several passes over the same area.  The cord, however, kept coming unhooked from the shaver.  Maybe with more use it will stretch out a bit, but it seems the connection is rather loose anyway.</li>
    <li> This is second one so you know it works.  My dog ate the plasctic off the top/inside of my first razor.  I also had to buy two new screens in the past because of the same razor-eating canine.  Braun five stars.  Dog.... four.  Ok five but if you have pets beware some eat these things.</li>
    <li> Absolutely worth the price.  Will never buy another brand....what a difference it made in shaving.</li>
    <li> Awesome shaver! Best I&#x27;ve had yet. Sticking with Braun products!</li>
    <li> EDIT:    After a year of using it, I&#x27;ve lowered the rating down to one star.  This is just an awful shaver.    The design of the head is inherently defective.  It depends on a pair of cutters to slide back and forth in their channels, which inherently have a lot of friction, and accumulate gunk.  It&#x27;s extremely hard to clean properly.    It&#x27;s been giving me lousy shaves from the beginning, and has progressively been getting worse as the friction of the cutters sliding in their channels began to wear down the cheap plastic posts that vibrate to wriggle the cutters.    Last night, while doing routine cleaning, the cutter head fell apart in my hands.  Very cheap, crappy design.  What made matters worse, is that tons of gunk came out. In spite of regular, careful cleaning with hot water and the included brush, the cutting head was full of old gunk that normal cleaning cannot remove.    Since it is not obvious how to put the cutter head back together (I don&#x27;t think it is meant to come apart), I just went back to my old Braun 5775, that I had not touched in a year.  Wow, what a better shave!  And a sensible, robust design.    This Series 3 is garbage by comparison.    &#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;    Original Review from 11 months ago:    My trusty Braun 5775 needed a new set of blades and foil, and rather than spring for paying for new parts for an older shaver, I decided to spring for a new shaver.    Big mistake.  This shaver is not serious about shaving.    It has an over-complicated shaving head, which does not shave effectively.  It takes a really long time, and a lot of passes over the same area on my face, to get the whiskers shaved down as well as my older 5775 did with a much smaller amouint of passes and time.    This is probably a good shaver for people with sensitive skin, but I do not have sensitive skin.  I just want a fast, effective shave.    Another victim, I suspect, of the \\&quot;race to the bottom\\&quot; that we are seeing in all manufactured goods.Hang to your old Braun shavers...</li>
    <li> Overall a good shaver. Shaves quiet and doesn&#x27;t pull. I don&#x27;t find it to be too much closer of a shave than other razors at half the price though. Battery life could be better</li>
    <li> i dislike this shaver, it takes many passes to actually shave the hair, plus the head is quite small. I would return it if it wasn&#x27;t too late.</li>
    <li> I have several electric shavers and Braun is my favorite. It shaves close and new cutting heads are available and easy to install.</li>
    <li> Great shaver. I have used mine for a year now and it has given great service - close shaves and NO pulling or &amp;#34;snags&amp;#34;.  This unit will not come with a travel case.  You can buy a very good Braun travel case (Part Number 67030721) that will accept any of the Series three hundred shavers.This&lt;br /&gt;is a &amp;#34;semi-hard&amp;#34; case that you will have to obtain from a store that sells shaver parts and related shaver supplies. This is a zippered case that holds the shaver but does not also accept the electric plug cord.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my wife so she can do her legs and she just loves it. It&#x27;s basically the same shaver in any $150 Braun complete package with the cleaning station, without the station of course. Same great Braun mechanics with a super close shave and no irritation. Charges very quickly and is a breeze to clean. She absolutely suggests this shaver for anyone looking for a budget-friendly quality shaver. Braun does it again and never disappoints!</li>
    <li> Had it for 3 months, and works great! I&#x27;m not sure what else to say, other than it&#x27;s so worth the money I paid. It&#x27;s powerful, the trimmer faces outward rather than in the same direction as the shaver, and allows you to trimmer without bettering the actual shaver in the way. It&#x27;s bulky enough to fit nicely in your hand, but small enough to stow away or leave out on your bathroom counter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also love that you can literally purchase a new head for the shaver, so if the old one ever gets too gunned up, or simply wears away, I can buy a new one and snap it on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OH, and it&#x27;s super easy to clean. I also got it in Red, one of my favorite colors. That&#x27;s have a few choices for color if you prefer others.</li>
    <li> I love my new Braun shaver.  It runs like a dream, it smoothly shaves my whole face is less than 5 minutes.  It gives me a very close shave.  It comes with all necessary attachments to plug it in and recharge it, plus a brush and an oil kit.  This is what a men&#x27;s shaver is supposed to be!  And the price is only $52.</li>
    <li> Good basic electric foil shaver.</li>
    <li> Braun&#x27;s $60 shaver used to last 3 years. Now they last 6 months. I thought I got a bad one, so I ordered another. It seems they all suck.</li>
    <li> I liked all of its features from ad and it looks good quality. Only been used once, so not much testing. Be aware, however, that it is quite large</li>
    <li> This is my second Braun--the first one lasted 7 years, before it went kaput.  I actually think that the shave from this new one is slightly better than the old one.  This is the best electric shaver I have ever used (out of five), and, of course, that means the closeness of the shave. This one is Type 5415--it uses cutter replacement part 32B (black).  The housing is slightly cheaper in that it is all plastic with a rubber grip--with no metal or chrome--but who cares, it is supposed to shave good, not be shiny and pretty.  It weighs a little less compared to the others I have used.  My one and only real criticism is that it would be better if the pop-up trimmer were on the opposite side.  Despite the trimmer&#x27;s placement, if I had it to do all over, again, I would still buy it.</li>
    <li> This replacement head appeared to be better made than the original.&lt;br /&gt;The cutting performance is equally as good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you for your on going efficiency.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kind Regards&lt;br /&gt;Anthony Venn.</li>
    <li> The unit feels heavy and solid. It shaves ok. My last electric shaver was Norelco. I wanted to try a new band this time. Braun has a good reputation. I typically electric shave then finish off with a razor. This model does the job for a decent shave. I am still looking for a razor quality electric shaver.</li>
    <li> I have taken this all over Europe (and the US naturally) and it has worked everywhere.&lt;br /&gt;I would highly recommend this shaver to someone who is looking for a budget shaver but still wants quality shaves without the use of a razor.</li>
    <li> As with all Braun shavers I have tried, it is easy on the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is fairly quiet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Decent shave.  Not the closest or quickest, but good enough.  Works best on beard that is short.  If you haven&#x27;t shaved for a three-day weekend or a camping trip, use the sideburn trimmer first to shorten the stubble.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t like the fat curved handle.  A straight handle is better - I can tip the head when necessary.  Rubberized grip is good in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Biggest annoyance is that there is no way to stand the shaver on its head or tail.  So, you have to waste sink top space with the shaver horizontal, or stuff it in a drawer.  That&#x27;s bad industrial design, and Braun knows better than to deliver a product that won&#x27;t stand up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Runtime on battery is the best of any shaver I&#x27;ve owned.  Probably close to the advertised 45 minutes.  Note that the AC power converter is a part of the cord assembly, not the shaver.  So, remember to take the cordset when you travel.  An ordinary shaver cord likely will fry the internals.</li>
    <li> Great product for shaving my head and face.  I had a good braun shaver that was about 4 years old and it worked well but was extremely noisy.  This shaver is really a much improved product.  Shaves very close even on hard to shave neck area.  Much improved quiet technology so you don&#x27;t hear the loud disruptive sounds of the old shavers.  Everything that you need in a high quality shaver.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this shaver for a bit over 3 months now.  It gives a good, close shave.  It charges fast, holds a charge for a respectable number of shaves and is easy to use and clean.  I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> This is my third Braun cordless shaver, and it&#x27;s by far the best design so far.  I didn&#x27;t want the high end model with the auto cleaning bath. This one is economical but works great. I have had a mustache for decades, and recently grew a chin beard, and this shaver has a pop-up trimmer that works great for trimming sideburns, mustache, beard, and any longer whiskers on the neck that you&#x27;ve missed a few times before. Battery life is excellent, only needing a recharge after about 2 weeks, and it has an indicator light that tells you when it needs charging.</li>
    <li> Purchased the shaver for a Christmas present for my husband.  He simply loves it and says it is the best shaver he has owned.</li>
    <li> Since they get better &amp; better (but the last one is still great) I give the old ones to young relatives, and treat myself!  This one has a touch control that&#x27;s a wow.  Completely safe in water. Much lighter, and if possible, it shaves even closer.  Foil is the only way to go with ultra-sensitive facial skin. Loyal for life.</li>
    <li> this razor was a gift, and from what i&#x27;m told, works very well.  no problems, and amazon even gives you a link for what replacement heads to get.  way better than from the store.</li>
    <li> Great shaver love it and it gives a close shave, and got it for a great price, would buy another one or recommend to friends</li>
    <li> This is an awsome shaver!</li>
    <li> This razor shaves close and does not burn or pull. Works great!I like the convenience of cordless and it is rechargeable.</li>
    <li> Shaver feels heavy in the hand,is quiet and does it&#x27;s job. Nine more words are required so here are nine more words.</li>
    <li> Really soft on my face &amp; does a great job with those whiskers that lay close to the skin.  The trimmer also works very well.</li>
    <li> Good razor as expected from Braun.  Unfortunately time and technology changes a lot.  There will never be one as good as the original 1-2-3 silver razor with the rubberized grip.  Have never found a razor with as close a shave as that one.  This one does hold a great charge for multiple shaves and shaves fairly close.  I have extremely sensitive skin and does not agitate.</li>
    <li> Works great and for the price what a bargain. I would not buy another razor, have paid 100.00 for some and this one work just as well as the high dollar razors.</li>
    <li> You get what you pay for, $60 is too much for this item. The series 7 Is Far superior. Lol</li>
    <li> I have to agree with other negative reviews on this item.  The unit simply does not shave well.  I expected more.  I once bought a Braun travel shaver from a grocery store.  It was only $30 and it was hanging from a hook near the razors next to other low cost items, in other words, it wasn&#x27;t high dollar stuff.  That Braun shaved MUCH better than this one.  I think I might try to sell mine on eBay and find another travel shaver.</li>
    <li> I bought this model to replace an older similar model that would no longer hold a charge. It had served me well.  This newer model actually shaves a little closer with the same comfort.  However, this newer model has plastic latches that easily come undone while shaving so that the head pops off, especially when your face is clean and dry. I suppose this is why Braun recommends shaving before you wash your face (hoping you have oily skin?). I am 64, so my beard is fairly tough, though not especially heavy, which may be part of the problem.  Maybe this is a good model for younger men.</li>
    <li> I bought this razor because my previous unit was a Braun. Boy...not all Braun razors are created equal! This one is poorly designed and makes cleaning near impossible. In addition, I have to shave the same spot on my face over and over because this razor will NOT cut the hairs on the first or second pass.&lt;br /&gt;Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had a beard for 41 years but lost it to chemotherapy. I needed a razor to cut the new growth and didn&#x27;t want to cut myself with a blade. After reading all the reviews this seemed like the best deal. It is O.K. I don&#x27;t have a tough or heavy beard but I have to go over areas repeatedly which I don&#x27;t think that I should. W/o doing side-by-side comparisons it&#x27;s really hard to assess its capabilities.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The sideburn trimmer works well.</li>
    <li> I have been using Braun razors for quite a few years.  This new razor certainly lives up to my expectations that they make great electric razors. They last almost 10 years and I only replace the cutter blades about once a year.  It&#x27;s the closest shave I have received and I have tried a lot of different electric razors...It&#x27;s the best!</li>
    <li> Works well and good value but plastic head cover not good. Would never use anything other than Braun.&lt;br /&gt;Just find accessories expensive.</li>
    <li> Met my expectations, even better!</li>
    <li> I bought this shaver month or so ago to replace an old Remington. I didn&#x27;t want the cumbersome pivoting heads and large size that seems to be standard on shavers these days. The Braun is much more streamlined, cuts close, and travels well. I used to have to resort to a side trimmer for long hairs with my old Remington, but the Braun has a middle trimmer between the 2 standard cutters that seems to work great in concert with the other 2 cutters to trim the longer hairs. This is good since the Braun&#x27;s side popup trimmer on the side is kind of inconvenient to use. Good shaver for the price.</li>
    <li> Bought for weekend use at vacation home when I didn&#x27;t want to have to use a razor. Gives a good clean shave. Seems to get even better with usage.</li>
    <li> I have experienced better performance than this one in some, but not very many, of the other foil style shavers.  I will probably switch back to the 3 head rotary style version after this one since after trying several different styles, I am pretty much convinced that the 3 head rotary versions are the way to go. Norelco appears to be the favorite.</li>
    <li> Very close and clean shave.  Less irritation and shaver burn.  Seems to clean up easily.  Stays charged for a long time....</li>
    <li> It provides a closer shave than my previous two electric razors. The only downside is the lack of a case to protect it during a trip.</li>
    <li> Bought this as a gift and he loves it.  Holds a good charge and shaves close and clean which is a bonus for me!</li>
    <li> No problems with delivery or use of the shaver.  Cuts very close and I&#x27;m fairly happy with the unit. I would recommend to others.</li>
    <li> I used a Braun shaver for over twenty years.  When I had to replace it I felt safe in staying with Braun.  I was wrong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My old shaver would give me a close shave in under fifteen minutes.  With this shaver it takes me twice as long and I still don&#x27;t have a close shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How is it possible a company could regress so much?</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always been a fan of Braun products.  I went through my stock of razors (8) and their accessories.  I cleaned them all up and donated them to Goodwill, then immediately purchased this Braun electric shaver.  I&#x27;ve never been disappointed with previous Braun items, and have not been with this purchase.  Buy with confidence.</li>
    <li> In my 20+ years of shaving, I&#x27;ve never used a non-Braun product. I&#x27;ve been on the 4000 series for several years, but finally had to retire my last unit because the battery wouldn&#x27;t keep a charge. (It served me well.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was a bit concerned by a number of reviews for this unit, but decided to give Braun the benefit of the doubt. As it turns out, I have to agree with several of the folks who were unimpressed with this shaver. My biggest complaints, relative to the 4000 series, is that this one isn&#x27;t as precise and doesn&#x27;t shave as close. Frankly, I wouldn&#x27;t have thought it possible for there to be such a downgrade from what I used in the past. But I&#x27;ve given this shaver a few months of regular use now, and it&#x27;s clearly not as high performing as the Brauns I&#x27;ve used in the past.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one thing I do like about this one is being able to rinse it with water. I&#x27;d not had that feature with my old shavers, and it makes it a heck of a lot easier to keep the shaver clean. That said, I&#x27;d gladly give up the feature if I could get a Braun that shaved as well as the ones I&#x27;ve had in the past.</li>
    <li> This replaced an older Braun.  This one is much quieter and also gets some neck hairs that the older one would not without using the slide up trimmer.  And it will shave about 2 weeks on a charge.  The only fault I found is the plastic head cover will not stay on securely,  needs a rubber band to hold it in place when in a travel case.</li>
    <li> Almost ripped my face off, there was nothing smooth about it.  Sent it back immediately. x x x x x x</li>
    <li> 1&#x27;ve used Braun shavers for most of my life.Yes more plastic, less features on the 320S-4 but it does a good job and I&#x27;m happy with the shaving results.</li>
    <li> The Braun 3 Series is definitely a step up from their previous lines of foil shavers. You really cannot get anything better for the price. But please know that although this shaver works very well for an electric shaver, it will not give you as close a shave as if you used a razor, especially if you use it without first applying a pre-shave product like Lectric-Shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking for the closest shave possible from an electric shaver I would recommend Braun&#x27;s 7 Series shavers. But if ultra-closeness is not of utmost importance, the Braun 3 Series is a very solid option. You might also consider buying the model that comes with the cleaning system, which saves time and ensures your shaver is in good working order, but does require purchasing the cleaning/lubrication pods that must be inserted into the station each time you clean the unit.</li>
    <li> clearly an improvement over my last razor -- close shave &amp; very quiet -- holds charge well &amp; recharges in a reasonable amount of time</li>
    <li> Not as comfortable as their more expensive line-up, but a very good shave.</li>
    <li> been using this for a year now. I really like it a lot. does a great job and holds a charge for a long time.</li>
    <li> this shaver is ok, not great</li>
    <li> Exactly what I needed. But I think I actually ordered the wrong item because I thought I was getting a travel case/bag with it. Oh well</li>
    <li> Works well even a year later</li>
    <li> Great shaver for a good price.  Close shave and easy to clean.  Shaves as close as my old remington 2700.</li>
    <li> My husband is very happy with this. Due to health issues presently he must use an electric razor,  he says &amp;#34; this razor does a better job&amp;#34;. Extremely pleased.</li>
    <li> Very comfortable shave. I feel it is as good as a blade and shaving cream. In fact, it does a better and faster job on the neck, in particular. I use it with Williams Lectric Shave. It seems to be well built. I can&#x27;t imagine spending more on a fancier shaver. I have never tried a wet electric shaver with cream, but my present experience has been very, very good.</li>
    <li> I had used a rotary blade shaver for years, and had to choose a replacement when it finally kicked the bucket. I did some research and read somewhere that oscillating blade shavers cut closer than rotary, presumably because the foil can be thinner. I have a thick and fast-growing beard, so I thought this model would work well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The problem is that it doesn&#x27;t cut close at all - I can feel a stubble in some areas right after using it, which doesn&#x27;t go away no matter how many times I go over the area. It&#x27;s also difficult to get an even cut, because the cutting heads only rock back and forth; they don&#x27;t conform to the face&#x27;s curves. On top of that, it&#x27;s obscenely loud.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the plus side, it&#x27;s very easy to clean - much easier than a rotating blade type, and the fine shaping cutter on the back works well. Overall, not recommended.</li>
    <li> I have been wanting an electric razor for sometime. I have had Norelco razors and was not satisfied. This is a game changer. Love this razor. You get many shaves on a charge.</li>
    <li> I have used Braun shavers for years and when I needed to replace I went with them again and am quite satisfied.</li>
    <li> Overall I like the shaver. It gives a close shave and it&#x27;s really worth the money. Although, I have thick coarse hair. Sometimes it doesn&#x27;t get it on my neck. If you have normal hair then it&#x27;ll work perfectly. Otherwise if you have thick hair, try to get a better model.</li>
    <li> I downgraded from an old Series 5 to this and was a little concerned. This gives a smooth shave that is better then the 5. I think it has to do with the heads move around, my other one just pushed in. So far so good. It does not come with the cleaner, though running it under water, has done the trick. I am happy with my purchase. Just saw the red light for the first time in 2 weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I saw other comments about the replace blades came on too early. If you read the instructions it tells you that the light to replace the blades will come on after a few weeks or few uses, forgot exactly what it says. Then it says reset it and it will be good for the next 18 months i think it is. So don&#x27;t get worried that it is a POS and you need to get new blades because it told you so..RTM.</li>
    <li> My previous razor was always irritating my neck, but this one does not! I wish I would have switched sooner. It works quite a while without charging, and cuts very close.</li>
    <li> I have used Braun shavers now for perhaps 6 or 7 years and I liked each one of them.  This one leaves me with 1 Question about the making of it, namely the cutter guard.  It is so poorly designed that I have to use a rubber band to keep it in place.  Now that doesn&#x27;t seem like Braun quality, but that is the way that it is.  The cutter guards on the other razors have been well designed, but this one isn&#x27;t.  Other than that, I think that it is a very good razor.  I also like the longer hair cutter in the middle of the main two shavers.  It doesn&#x27;t miss much with this type of setup.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my dad for Christmas and he loves it. Better than the Remington ones he has been using in the past. I would recomend this to anyone. He also has a course beard and it works good on it.</li>
    <li> Gives a good close shave. Easy to clean. The only problem with the shaver is that the charger plug is very loose on the shaver. It keeps falling out whether you&#x27;re trying to use the shaver or not. Except for that, I&#x27;d recommend this shaver to everyone.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t give as close a shave as i would like it to.  I do like the rechargable battery and it is easy to clean.</li>
    <li> Bought this because I am a Police Officer and have to be clean shaven. My skin was always irritated from shaving with a bladed razor daily. I was skeptical on how well this thing would work and if it would give me a sufficient shave and clear up the irritation. I am happy to report that it does a much better job than I expected. It leaves a very minimal amount of stubble on the neck area but other than that it&#x27;s a clean shave and has cured my skin irritation problem. Well worth the price.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a replacement for a rotary shaver. It provides a nice close shave. My minor complaint is that this razor seems to drop wiskers on your clothing when shaving. I didn&#x27;t notice this with the rotary shaver this much. Not a big deal just mention it for individuals who might shave after getting dressed, like on the way to work, etc. All in all nice razor.</li>
    <li> I bought this shaver during holiday promotion. My husband feels fine with it. So, compare with the price I got it, I think this is a valuable shaver in the market.</li>
    <li> The build quality is very good. I have owned it for little over a month. It shaves very close to the skin without giving the burning sensation.</li>
    <li> Bought for my husband to replace an old shaver that finally bit the dust. He is a very frugal man and didn&#x27;t want to spend too much for a razor. I told him that you want to get a quality shaver so it will last a long time. He was happy I purchased, especially when I told him there was a $10 off when I bought it :)</li>
    <li> Great close shave.  High quality feel to it.  Battery life is great.  Washability is nice.  Only thing that lacks is the pop up trimmer.  The quality of the trimmer is pretty low.</li>
    <li> I bought this Braun based on positive Amazon reviews.  I am sorry I read them.  This type of shaver can&#x27;t compete with Norelco or Remington rotary shavers I have owned.  I have used electric shavers for more than 40 years so it isn&#x27;t my lack of familiarity with these shavers.  It didn&#x27;t cut my daily beard growth properly from the very beginning, and required way more time to accomplish a shave than any equivalently priced Norelco or Remington rotary.  It leaves stubble no matter how many times you press the shaver over area.  It doesn&#x27;t burn or pinch, but it just doesn&#x27;t cut close and leaves many hairs behind on a daily shave.  Thank goodness I kept the older Norelco with the old blades that doesn&#x27;t exhibit these awful flaws.  I would never buy a Braun shaver again, and no I don&#x27;t work for Norelco.  If you buy this shaver I am sure you will be disappointed as I am.</li>
    <li> Does the best job on my beard I have had in a long time!</li>
    <li> This Braun shaver replaced a older model 5770 which I have used for several years.I have used it for a week and I&#x27;m totally satisfied.</li>
    <li> I got this razor about four weeks ago, charged it, and began using it.  I&#x27;m waiting for the red charge light to indicate it has discharged sufficiently to recharge it. Still waiting.  The razor itself works very well and the battery has satisfied my expectations.</li>
    <li> Have a 15 year old Braun which was very good, but this new Braun even beats the old one for smoothness, quiet running, and reliable grip.</li>
    <li> If your looking for a close shave and you&#x27;ve had trouble with long neck hairs look elsewhere...This is a dud....I  never seen or used a razor made in china that shaved well.....This is no exception..Not all that close on any part of the face..PS..I&#x27;m not Rosemary....Her son in case you wondered!!</li>
    <li> This shaver has two things important to me. It works with the cord when the battery is dead, and the battery life is long. I was frustrated with my last razor, when the battery needed charging and I didn&#x27;t have time to wait for it to charge, but wouldn&#x27;t work with the cord plugged into the wall! Not the case here. The shave it gives is okay, the trimmer portion a little subpar, but overall it&#x27;s a nice unit, and for the price does the job just fine.</li>
    <li> Here&#x27;s what you need to know:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Battery Life:&lt;br /&gt;This little guy holds a charge for quite a while.  I&#x27;ve been using it every other day for about a month now, and it hasn&#x27;t indicated that it needs another charge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall Build Quality:&lt;br /&gt;It feels... solid.  It&#x27;s not heavy, but it feels durable &amp; built to last.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Features:&lt;br /&gt;Not many.  The thing has two functions: off and on.  There&#x27;s a hair trimmer on the back that works just as well as any other hair trimmer I&#x27;ve used.  There aren&#x27;t many bells and whistles, which is more than OK if you ask me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ALSO: This one CAN&#x27;T go in the shower, as it&#x27;s not a wet/dry shaver.  I don&#x27;t see an issue with that, but if you&#x27;re some productivity freak who can&#x27;t take the time to shave and shower separately, you might want to consider the wet/dry option: [[ASIN:B004UQ6Q62 Braun 3Series 340S-4 Wet &amp; Dry Shaver]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Quite a few of the shavers here seem more like spaceships than shavers.  This one seemed simple enough for my tastes, and it was.&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re looking for a solid, well-built and reasonably priced shaver, look no further.</li>
    <li> Very satisfied with the razor and the price</li>
    <li> using last 2 years every day works perfectly, does not allergy my skin!</li>
    <li> great razor for the price&lt;br /&gt;love it so far</li>
    <li> This shaved is worthless it cuts about half the whiskers with a lot of effort. I&#x27;m going back to the Norleco rotary. Don&#x27;t waste your time and money on this.</li>
    <li> This shaver replaced a 35 year old Braun shaver that I dropped and broke. I usually shave with a razor but occasionally I used the electric one and have for the last 60+ yrs. I can not believe how good this electric shaver works and there&#x27;s a chance I&#x27;ll never use the razor again.</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with this razor.  I have sensitive skin, and this razor does a great job, and cuts almost as good as a blade.  I get several shaves with out recharging.  After two months, I am still very pleased with this razor.</li>
    <li> My husband is enjoying the shaver. It&#x27;s easy to use and gets beard close and smooth. Good product and nice price.</li>
    <li> I have a braun 8 series and Norelco arcitec series. i have been using both these for quite a while and I am happy with both of them but they are expensive in a $100 dollar range. Braun Series 3 on the other hand should not be your first and only shaver. You can use it as a secondary shaver for your car or office just in case you need it. It feels cheap. Internal plastic parts look and feel flimsy.</li>
    <li> This razor is our new best friend!&lt;br /&gt;It is a little bit fragile, do not rub or press down hard, as pieces may come off.&lt;br /&gt;Everything we wanted though! Thanks!</li>
    <li> Not enough power if you&#x27;ve been shaving for a while. Can&#x27;t push on it to hard or the motor stops. The shave is not close enough. The higher models like the series 5 and 7 are much better. A lot more power and closer shave. I returned this to Braun and got the series 5. Much better but more money of course. You get what you pay for!</li>
    <li> I have tried many different shavers over the years and I always go back to Braun. I don&#x27;t think I will ever try another brand. They offer the best batteries and the best shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I still wont buy a $100 model because these offer all that I need. Plus when its time to buy a new blade, I just replace the whole thing. Since blades are normally 70% of the cost.</li>
    <li> With a bit more attention, it shaves about as well as my old Norelco.  I made the change to this because the Norelco batteries wore out, and changing them required a dismanteling, and soldering leads to a printed circuit board.  I am somewhat adept at soldering, but the connections were to small for my soldering iron.  After wasting time and money in a failed effort to make the change, I decided not to waste a bunch more money on a new Norelco.  Besides, for traveling, this Braun fits in a bag much easier.</li>
    <li> hello, got his shaver 8 months ago and really liked it until I started cutting my face and neck... did not know why, so I decided to check the head and to my surprise,the foils were already worn out on the ends and there was a hole which lifted up small pieces of wire from the mesh which was the cause of the scatches on my face... The specification says you need to change the heads every 18 months to maintain a 100% clean shave, but this was not my case... I may have been the unlucky guy that got a faulty shaver. Now I will have to invest another $22,00 + shipping to continue using the saver....</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t have a lot to shave.  So after first charge, I used it for more than 30 days.  Seems it is not as easy to use as the rounded three cutters type.  But it is very minor difference.  Maybe I just not use to it yet.</li>
    <li> Best shaver ever! No more blade facial slice and dice, Braun is really the best, thank you.</li>
    <li> not very travel friendly and the plug into the body of the shaver is hard to pull off after you put it on. I was just looking for a small and light one. anyways, it is a good shaver.</li>
    <li> I purchased this shaver wanting to try something different after having a Norelco for five years. The performance of the Braun is okay, although with some grisly areas on my face, there are struggles trying to get a clean shave. If two days go by, I cannot get a fully clean shave. But, this razor wasn&#x27;t expensive, so I have to keep that in mind.</li>
    <li> Att the price this is a great razor. I have owned different brands at different prices and for the money this is a great deal!</li>
    <li> Braun always have good quality shavers.  This one 320S-4 is no exception.  My last Braun lasted for more than 10 years and still works like new. I am very pleased with it.</li>
    <li> I used my other German made Braun shaver for about 17 years and parts were no where to be found, so I gave this one a shot and I was really suprised how good it was made for the price.  I have light facial hair so this is perfect for me...no fancy stuff just plain will do just fine.  If you have thicker facial hair I would recommend a higher series.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great price&lt;br /&gt;good size&lt;br /&gt;very nice triple action cutting&lt;br /&gt;very quiet&lt;br /&gt;last long with one charge</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always thought Braun gave the closest shaves, and this one does. Easy to clean, good battery life as well.</li>
    <li> The mid priced Braun is the best electric I have found.  The close shave and comfort are both better than the rotary type.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Braun system and blade construction are the improvement.</li>
    <li> Not worth the money. The Panasonic ES-LA63-S Arc4 Electric Shaver will give you much closer shave.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work out for me, I prefer another style with enhanced trimmer</li>
    <li> Replaced old shaver at great savings, provides great shave.</li>
    <li> First electric razor in years. Last one was a Norelco rotary. The Braun is quick and smooth, but doesn&#x27;t match a blade shave. That said, I like it and find it a welcome option when I am in hurry or want to do a last minute clean up. Its hefty, so it takes up some room in a travel kit. Also, the plastic guard tends to come off.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had five or six electric razors over a 30-year span. This is one of the best because it features the long-hair cutters with the regular cutting blades. Without the long-hair cutters (featured 25 years ago, then went out of fashion, then returned), the longer hairs don&#x27;t get cut reliably. This razor is comfortable, performs much better than razors without the long-hair cutters, and is a good value. My only complaint is the position and style of the on-off switch. It is easy to accidentally depress when shaving, and took some getting used to. I would have made it a slide switch or moved the location. Nevertheless, I give the razor 4.5 stars for value and performance.</li>
    <li> This is a great shaver!  It is quiet and the shave is very close and there is no skin irritation.</li>
    <li> Love my new shaver. Very easy to use and very easy to keep clean. Fits nicely in my hand and is nice looking.</li>
    <li> I gave this to my son for Christmas so he would quit using mine.  He loves it!  He can&#x27;t wait to shave everyday because he likes a smooth face.  Excellent machine!</li>
    <li> Looked for a new razor to replace my old Braun 3614. Found the best one for me on Amazon with a great price. I really like Braun razors. I have tried other brands but they never seem to work as well as a Braun on my face.</li>
    <li> I wore out my ancient Norelco rotary, tried a Remington rotary for a while, it just didn&#x27;t do the job. This Braun does a very nice job, close shave and fast, with the rotary shavers I&#x27;ve used in the past I had to spend nearly twice as long to get a good shave as this guy does in 2 or 3 passes!.</li>
    <li> Well worth the money.  My previous Braun shaver lasted nearly 10 years, without new blades or service.  This is a great product.</li>
    <li> this is my third Braun shaver. They always makes good product. I love it, because it is easy to shave and the battery is long lasting.&lt;br /&gt;thanks!</li>
    <li> I used Norelco shavers for all my life before switching to the Braun.  The Braun gives a much closer shave, faster, with less irritation, at a much cheaper price.  The Braun chews hair off your face with a few strokes and can handle longer scruff way more effectively.  I have a very angular face, and irregular facial hair pattern and growth.  I do not have thick, full facial hair.  Rather sharp and dispersed facial hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For me. the hardest shaving point is my neck.  The Norelcos NEVER shaved that hair even with repeat strokes, different angles, different grips, and varied pressure.  However, they would succeed at chaffing and irritating the skin quite well.  The ONLY way the Norelcos would shave my neck hair was if I used the pop out trimmer and tediously and skillfully attacked small patches of hair and then went over with the circular blades once the hair was short enough, and even then the shave was mediocre at best.  The Braun, removes much more neck hair, much faster, with significantly less irritation.  It doesn&#x27;t magically remove ALL the neck hair.  I still have to target a few difficult hairs with the pop out trimmer to make them short enough before the shaver will get them.  The pop out trimmer on the Braun lacks trimming power, which is why I gave the Braun 4 stars and not 5.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another HUGE plus for the Braun, is that you can use the shaver while it is plugged into a power source.  This may sound trivial, but it is actually quite important.  If your shaver discharges mid shave, you simply plug the Braun in and finish the job.  The Norelco lithium battery shaver I had, would NOT function while it was charging.  So, if you only got through half your shave before discharge, sorry but you will have to wait an hour before you have enough charge to finish the job.  What&#x27;s that? Its 10PM and you want to go to bed for work tomorrow?  Excuse me?  Its 7AM and you have half a shave and you need to catch your 730AM bus?  Sorry you&#x27;re out luck buddy.  Enjoy going to work with half your facial hair.  I really hope Norelco fixed that problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Braun&#x27;s battery is strong and the shaver functions with an equal amount of power whether its plugged into the wall or its functioning on battery.  Again, this my sound trivial, but it is actually VERY important.  You want an electric shaver to rotate as quickly as possible because that gives it shaving power which translates to less strokes, faster shave, and less irritation.  The Norelcos I used in the past that COULD shave while plugged into the outlet, would have maximum shaving power while plugged in, but as soon as the cord was removed and the shaver switched over to battery, the Norelco would drop power and function with 10-20% less gusto.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I am very pleased with the Braun.  Its nice to finish off a shave, and not have super chaffed and irritated skin.  I can shave with the Braun in the morning and not suffer significant chaffing or irritation, and then go about the rest of my day feeling good about my skin.  I would NEVER, attempt that with a Norelco.  A Norelco shave always had to be be a night affair for me, so that my skin had the night to recover from the chaffing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this introduction level shaver because I was not sure if the Braun would be effective and I didn&#x27;t want to spend alot of money finding out.  After my experience with this Braun, I have no hesitation about purchasing this shaver or one of their higher level, more expensive shavers in the future.</li>
    <li> After years of using of my old Braun 3-Series (side trimmer went kaput), I replaced it with this 3-Series 320S-4, and can&#x27;t imagine a better shaver.  The side trimmer has been redesigned, the three independently floating heads reduces the shaving time to half, it&#x27;s water cleanable, and quiet.  It just doesn&#x27;t get much better.</li>
    <li> Sideburn trimmer was broken from the beginning</li>
    <li> A good reliable razor. Shaves great, battery lasts a long time.</li>
    <li> This is my first shaver and I couldn&#x27;t be happier. I used to have some pimples but since I bought this shaver, they are all gone and my skin is been clear for 3 months. (i bought the shaver 3 months ago).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just bought second one as a birthday gift for my brother.</li>
    <li> This is my first Braun, so I didn&#x27;t have any expectations other than its reputation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Closeness of shave (C): Very disappointed.  Takes many, many passes and still doesn&#x27;t shave as close as my previous $30 Remingtons.  My skin feels good afterward, but it better if the blades are going close to my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Trimmer (D): Terrible.  Does not trim close at all.  The length of the trimmer is tiny so it takes a while.  Also you have to hold a button and push up the trimmer attachment to extend it, which is very awkward.  Have you ever accidentally expelled the trimmer on your shaver before?  I haven&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Battery life (A): Very good, goes for weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Noise (A): Quietest shaver I&#x27;ve ever owned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I would not recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m in my 70&#x27;s and shaving gets harder each year. I thought I&#x27;d try a change. The only regret I have is that I didn&#x27;t do it years ago. Honest this is the best shave I&#x27;ve ever had. Thanks so much to Braun and Amazon.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a Braun shaver w/o having to spend too much.  Always happy with Braun products, and I prefer the block shaver instead of the rotating heads like some other shavers.  This one seemed to be a good value for the money.  I&#x27;ve used it for several months already with no issues at all.  Haven&#x27;t even had to replace the foil or the cutter yet.</li>
    <li> Works as well as expected.  Good shave, an upgrade over the Remington rotary I replaced. Would recommend purchase to another.</li>
    <li> Truly the most comfortable electric shaver I&#x27;ve used and I can&#x27;t believe how close it shaves. I&#x27;m no longer using the old disposable razor in the shower, &#x27;cause this is much more convenient. Build quality is good and it holds a charge well. And it was inexpensive to boot.</li>
    <li> Best shaver I have ever used</li>
    <li> Best electric razor on the market.  This is my 4th Braun razor and I love them.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent shaver for the price. I&#x27;ve had it for a year and half and just purchased a replacement foil / blade combo. The original foil and blade combo lasted right up until the recommended replacement time. At that point, it became much more difficult to get a close shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Originally, I spent a while looking for shavers that I could use both plugged in and unplugged. Unfortunately, most electric shavers seem to have a shut-off feature when the device is plugged in. I just didn&#x27;t like the thought of traveling with this a shaver, running out of battery power, finding an outlet to charge it, then having to wait to use it. This 3Series shaver, therefore, does what other shavers at 2x the price point can&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s comfortable to hold, easy to clean (as opposed to old rotary head shavers I used to use), doesn&#x27;t tug at my hair, looks great and has exceeded expectations.</li>
    <li> I have been looking and looking for the shaver to replace the Braun shaver I was using for many years and went to many stores to touch, read about and make a decision.  I finally decided the 3Series was my choice.  I have a trimmed beard that I don&#x27;t want to shave off so the head of the shaver was the main concern.  While the 3Series didn&#x27;t have the smallest head, because it had a 60 day period in which I could return it, I chose to go with it.  I am relatively happy with it and as I get more used to the size I am liking it better and better.  It&#x27;s a keeper.</li>
    <li> It really holds a charge.  My husband says it holds a charge longer than any razor he has ever had.  It gives a clean shave.</li>
    <li> Great shaver that easy on the face, smooth running and the ability to clean with water is a great feature</li>
    <li> First, a bit about me:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Beard Thickness - Average&lt;br /&gt;Whisker Coarseness - Average&lt;br /&gt;Skin Sensitivity - Slightly Above Average&lt;br /&gt;Laziness - Greatly Above Average&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It seems like the price on refills for the Gillette Mach 3 Turbo go up every month. In frustration, I decided to shop around for an electric razor--something I&#x27;d never tried before. I basically wanted the shave of a Mach 3 in as little time as possible without the foamy mess. The Braun Series 3 was nearly 50% off list price for a couple of days so I decided to give it a go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Series 3 has exceeded my expectations. I was skeptical of the closeness of the shave an electric razor could deliver but I believe it to be just shy of what a traditional razor can do. What&#x27;s more, my skin isn&#x27;t irritated at all so I actually find the shave more satisfying overall. The speed is great--without the foaming and rinsing steps, I think I&#x27;ve cut my shave time in half.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So on to my rating. I gave this product 4 stars because I feel that it struggles with the recesses of the neck around the throat area. I find myself making 6 or 7 passes in various directions in order to shave stray whiskers.  This is probably an area that traditional razors will always excel vs. electric razors and I don&#x27;t consider it a design flaw. But making a few extra passes is a small compromise to make to save me from buying overpriced Gillette refill cartridges. I&#x27;m completely satisfied.</li>
    <li> Very pleased with overall closeness of the shave.  It extremely easy to keep clean.  No reason to buy the cheaper brands</li>
    <li> For the value it is a great razor. If you can get it for a great price it is DEFINITELY worth picking up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It looks slick and stylish. Manly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s quick to charge and a pretty consistent shave.</li>
    <li> I purchased this in January of 2013 and have used it for about a month now. It cuts the hair fine but only after multiple and repeated strokes - there are certain areas that it just does not like and I have to go over them over-and-over. Also, it struggles to remove hair from the neck area and I have to resort to use my razor blades. Overall, I like the product but it&#x27;s not the best or certainly not what you&#x27;d expect from Braun!</li>
    <li> I was considering a new electric razor since my Norelco was really starting to irritate my face and was not cutting very close.  This Braun is fantastic compared to the Norelco in that it cuts my beard as close as a straight razor.  Plus the Braun is not irritating at all when shaving.  I bought this 3 series for $35 shipped on a special which made it a no brainer considering how many people really like it.</li>
    <li> Even the least expensive Braun gives a five star shave.  So far, the battery seem to go forever without recharging (be sure to follow directions regarding the initial charge).</li>
    <li> Good close shave for an electric. Easy to use and holds a charge very well too. Had a Braun 6 for many years and this gives and even closer shave.</li>
    <li> made in China, German product was better</li>
    <li> Very happy with this shaver. It is much quieter than my previous Braun and gives a good easy shave. I have been using Braun shavers for many years and I highly recommend this one. I chose it because I wanted the option to use a cord should the battery not hold its charge as happened with my previous Braun razors. I like simple and this one has the basics (cord and trimmer) and does a nice job. Braun please don&#x27;t stop making the simple cord models.</li>
    <li> A very good product--quiet, efficient, close shave, very comfortable.  The cord is a problem, but since I owned an older Braun with the same cord configuration that fit much tighter I worked around the issue.  However, I think the cord that comes with the shaver is so useless since it pulls out of the shaver with the slightest tug that Braun should voluntarily offer to replace it.  If I had no choice as to the cord, I would be very unhappy with an otherwise great product.</li>
    <li> Lot better than the Norelco shaver that was replaced by this Braun shaver. As the battery life is longer and no problem getting it wet.</li>
    <li> This product works very well.  The Braun products are made well and have plenty of years behind them of experience with making a great product.  The design is sleek and easy to handle.  My son says he like the easy of use and it take the hair off of his face wonderfully.  Braun make it easy to get replacement pieces too.</li>
    <li> I had a Braun 4775 before, which I replaced when the side trimmer broke.&lt;br /&gt;Second Braun that did that, but it lasted a few years and I replaced the&lt;br /&gt;foil once, so no biggie for an $80 shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have the 320-s4 which is the cheapest series 3 and costs a little less than my 4775.&lt;br /&gt;I do recommend getting this one over the series 1, I had the bottom level braun for many years,&lt;br /&gt;and the main advantage is the motor turns quicker, so it shaves faster, worth going from $30&lt;br /&gt;to $60 for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At least for me, it shaves closer than the 4700.  And a little quicker,&lt;br /&gt;course it has a new battery, and they shave slower when the battery gets old.&lt;br /&gt;It is quieter than the old 4700, nice if you have to worry about waking people up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like all foil shavers, it takes me many passes to get a close shave.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know how people can do it in a single pass, foils don&#x27;t do that for me.&lt;br /&gt;I shave after I shower however, I know you are supposed to shave with a dirty face,&lt;br /&gt;but then all that skin oil gets into the mechanism and you have to wash it out,&lt;br /&gt;no thanks.  I can just pull off the foil, tap it to get the stuff out, and once in a long&lt;br /&gt;while use the brush, so I never have to mess with icky cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like that it has a Lithium Ion battery, if the trimmer doesn&#x27;t break,&lt;br /&gt;the battery should last longer than the NiCD&#x27;s of the previous model.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A downside compared to the 4700 is it is a little thicker.&lt;br /&gt;The two foils are farther apart, so it takes a bit of getting used to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like that it came with a plastic foil guard, the 4700 had no guard that I recall.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also don&#x27;t want to waste time with the fancier self cleaning versions,&lt;br /&gt;why would I want to carry a shaver, a base, replacement cleaning packs - useless junk for suckers&lt;br /&gt;if you ask me.  It totally defeats the idea of a simple, low-maintenance, electric shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This guys hits the sweet spot foran electric shaver IMHO.</li>
    <li> This shaver has been everything I had hoped for.  My past experience with electric shavers had not been very positive.  This Braun shaver has far exceeded my expectations.</li>
    <li> Completely satisfied. Love the smooth shave. Especially on the neck area.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend.&lt;br /&gt;I also like the international voltage capability.</li>
    <li> Best electric razor I&#x27;ve used but doesn&#x27;t come close to a blade shave. I use the Braun first and then follow it up with a disposable razor for a really close shave.</li>
    <li> I had a Braun 5610 that shaved OK, but it eventually wore out.  So, a few months ago, I bought a new Braun 320s-4.  It runs, but it doesn&#x27;t shave.  I suspect the holes in the screen are too tiny to admit anything but peach fuzz.</li>
    <li> Got this one to replace an old Braun that was difficult to get parts for.  The 320S-4 works great.  It is fast, charges fast, and keeps a charge for almost a week.  If you want a good electric shaver at an economical price, this is the one.</li>
    <li> This shaver performs well. It holds a charge for a lot of shaves. It has only one setting &amp; no carrying case.</li>
    <li> I recently purchased the 320S-4 to replace a model 5790 which I had used for several years.  The trimmer blade had come off and I decided it was time to get a new one anyway.  I switched from Norelco razors to Braun 15  to 20 years or so ago and have never been disappointed with any Braun razor.  I would say I have a medium beard and find that the Braun always gives me a close shave.  This one seems to run much quieter than my previous one and is easier to clean than previous models. I particularly like the improved plastic protective cap design for the shaver head as previous ones were prone to fall off easily.  The lack of a pouch was not a problem as I still had my old one which I seldom used.</li>
    <li> Broke after less than two months. The extending beard trimmer doesn&#x27;t work at all. Braun wants me to wait 6-8 weeks under the warranty. Last time I&#x27;ll buy from one of their worthless lines.</li>
</ol>
