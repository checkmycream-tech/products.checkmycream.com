      <li>Just ordered some to give as gifts...because a really good girlfriend   shares her secrets!</li>
      <li>And you&#x27;ll be proud to suggest it to others, as I am doing.</li>
      <li>smells wonderful but to be honest</li>
      <li>AMAZING!</li>
      <li>The product smells nicely tropical but that&#x27;s all I can say that&#x27;s good about it.  </li>
      <li>This Oil is AMAZING.  </li>
      <li>Kind of like coconut.</li>

      <li>split end-mender on top of this product and I am very pleased the results.</li>
      <li>I have tried so many</li>
      <li>It is nice smelling, leaving a wiff of light coconut-like fragrance.</li>
      <li>I bought the Couture Colour Hair Colour (which Im in love with) and it came with a sample Pequi oil.  </li>
      <li>I have color-treated hair that is relatively healthy</li>
      <li>I am sure when used over time (I have been using this for about 3 months)</li>
      <li>Love the way my hair turned out.</li>
      <li>i mix it with hair creme because i have really curly hair its great then</li>
      <li>This product is an excellent choice..leaves hair shining without weight of other oils.</li>
      <li>First I noticed the scent, which is nice and fruity.</li>
      <li>It does not make my hair oily, but does make it manageable and smooth.  </li>
      <li>It is amazing and makes my hair much softer and not as frizzy.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Despite being an &#x27;oil&#x27;, Pequi oil treatment is light and non-greasy.</li>
      <li>My hair was so smooth and felt so healthy after the first application.</li>
      <li>For the non-steep price, it is rather worth the investment!</li>
      <li>and have finally found something that tames my naturally curly hair, and brings out the best in every strand!  </li>
      <li>Who knew all it took was the right product!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m really picky, but the Pequi Oli Treatment was even better than I had hoped it would be.</li>
      <li>It has a very nice, subtle scent too which is nice..</li>
      <li>With Couture Colour Pequi Oil Treatment my hair is so soft, shiny, strong, and smooth all in one!</li>
      <li>On top of that, the smell is absolutely divine- like fresh coconuts.</li>
      <li>, let me say that I&#x27;m super, super picky about my hair products</li>
      <li>I highly recommend it :)</li>
      <li>i have fine hair and 2 pumps is more than enough</li>
      <li>It is soft and sleek and smooth!</li>
      <li>Macadamia Natural Oil isn&#x27;t that much better...</li>
      <li>I love the way it smells, and it really has made my hair feel much silkier and smoother.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a bit over priced, but for now, seems worth it.</li>
      <li>I think the price is very reasonable, too.  </li>
      <li>I tried this for the first time last night and already love it.</li>
      <li>I was even able to flat iron it after blow drying</li>
      <li>My message is to every woman who wants better results in self-styling on a daily basis.  </li>
      <li>About a quarter size amount helps me comb through my tangled long hair, and keeps the frizzies away for most of the day.</li>
      <li>Then, I noticed that using about a nickel sized amount made my wet hair feel very smooth and tangle-free.</li>
      <li>It can be used pre-shampoo or post, or for heat styling, making it a very versatile product.</li>
      <li>I washed my hair like normal and then used the oil and let my hair mostly air dry before finishing it with the dryer.</li>
      <li>and I still did not get a shine even after lightly applying a flat iron.</li>
      <li>this product works better, but for now I need to supplement it with other products.   </li>
      <li>but this is the ONLY one I ever bought a full size of after trying the sample.</li>
      <li>It may work with someone with dry smooth hair but on my wiry hair it did not help at all.  </li>
      <li>I give it a four star and not a five because the results are not very dramatic on my hair.</li>
      <li>Straight, shiny, wow!  </li>
      <li>Normally i have to blow dry then set my hair with Velcro rollers to get it to be smooth and shiny.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend it to your shoppers.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
      <li>Lightened but not color treated, fine shaft, long and easily tangled, dried and frizzy with a greasy scalp.</li>
      <li>Also, I tried it on a whim, because I do not, and never have, colored my hair, but it sounded like it was worth a try anyway, and one big problem I have is living in a humid climate.  </li>
      <li>I was too lazy last night to deal with it and thought it would be a good test for this oil.</li>
      <li>This stuff has pequi oil in it, but it has a lot of other ingredients to make it the non-greasy smoothing product it is with the light,</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s been a while since I&#x27;ve tried a new product that my stylist hasn&#x27;t recommended, but I wasn&#x27;t having any luck with just using conditioner alone.</li>
      <li>It felt so smooth and maybe looked a little shinier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Frizzy tresses will become markedly softer and shinier.</li>
      <li>and it is soft as can be.  </li>
      <li>It feels luxurious, soft and shiny.  </li>
      <li>It comes out so silky and shiny and soft.  </li>
      <li>If you want an oil treatment that is not going to weigh your hair down, smell fantastic, and actually do what it claims to do then</li>
      <li>I try to avoid combing my wet hair--but the difference after using this was that I really felt like I didn&#x27;t even need to).</li>
      <li>It made my hair SO soft and Shiny that I ordered a bottle the next day - AllI get is compliments on my hair!    </li>
      <li>I always end up using too much and having that unattractive \\&quot;wet hair\\</li>
      <li>I have invested so much time and money into over-hyped oil treatments that leave me less than enthused about the results.</li>
      <li>I blow dry my hair and my hair feels soft, looks shiny but not greasy.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not the biggest fan of moroccan oil or coconut oil in my hair because I feel like my hair doesn&#x27;t absorb it very well, wet or dry.</li>

<li> I&#x27;m not the biggest fan of moroccan oil or coconut oil in my hair because I feel like my hair doesn&#x27;t absorb it very well, wet or dry.</li>
<li> I tend to use this on wet hair, and I usually do not use heated styling tools (eg blow dryer, curling iron, flat iron).</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve used it a few times now and am pleasantly surprised at how much smoother my hair looked after I blow dried it and used the curling iron.</li>
<li> I definitely recommend this product, especially if you have color-treated or frizzy, dry hair!</li>
<li> And the other day, I had to rush and didn&#x27;t have time to use the curling iron (which usually means that it looks extra frizzy the whole day.)</li>
<li> I forgot I had used it until I got quite a few unexpected compliments.    </li>
<li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve spent lots of money on products, recently bring a fan of Kerastase, but nothing has ever managed my hair like this without being greasy.  </li>
<li> My hair is turning grey and wiry.  </li>
<li> I am a caucasian with color treated, thin, white and grey hair with some wiry hairs that I thought this product would help smooth and tame.  </li>
<li> /&gt;After using this product a few times on wet hair out of the shower, I was pleasantly surprised.</li>
<li> and I was super skeptical.</li>
<li> only reason I give it four instead of five stars is that I feel it&#x27;s a bit expensive for being labelled as \\&quot;pequi\\&quot; oil, and I find it really hasn&#x27;t helped with the health of my hair.</li>
<li> This product has helped immensely with my frizzy dried hair, and it does not add a ton of oil to my scalp.</li>
<li> then I rub my hands together before applying to my wet hair.</li>
<li> It adds shine and not greasy and works well with other products.</li>
<li> My hair is also breaking less, although this may be because I am using other products as well.   </li>
<li> For the price it is not worth it</li>
<li> This is a reliable product that won&#x27;t let you down.  </li>
<li> I would buy again if the price goes down.</li>
<li> Did little to curb the frizz.</li>
<li> And ..but a little amount lasts...</li>
<li> it can be a little oily</li>
<li> I have dry and thin hair and ever since I have used Couture Colour&#x27;s Pequi Oil   on my wet hair before I blow it out.  </li>
<li> Seriously, you just run it through your hair and blow dry.  </li>
<li> I spray on a few drops before blow drying my hair.  </li>
<li> And then when it dried, my hair didn&#x27;t look greasy at all.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Love the product, but I think it&#x27;s too expensive for what it is.  I would buy again if the price goes down.</li>
    <li> A friend who knew I was frustrated with my frizzy hair told me to try this product. It&#x27;s been a while since I&#x27;ve tried a new product that my stylist hasn&#x27;t recommended, but I wasn&#x27;t having any luck with just using conditioner alone. I checked into Pequi Oil Treatment online, and thought that if it did what it said, it was just what I was looking for.    I&#x27;ve used it a few times now and am pleasantly surprised at how much smoother my hair looked after I blow dried it and used the curling iron. And the other day, I had to rush and didn&#x27;t have time to use the curling iron (which usually means that it looks extra frizzy the whole day.) I forgot I had used it until I got quite a few unexpected compliments.    I&#x27;m really picky, but the Pequi Oli Treatment was even better than I had hoped it would be. I think the price is very reasonable, too.  I definitely recommend this product, especially if you have color-treated or frizzy, dry hair!</li>
    <li> Pequi oil is one of the best hair products I have ever used.  I spray on a few drops before blow drying my hair.  It does not make my hair oily, but does make it manageable and smooth.  I highly recommend it to your shoppers.</li>
    <li> I have dry and thin hair and ever since I have used Couture Colour&#x27;s Pequi Oil   on my wet hair before I blow it out.  It feels luxurious, soft and shiny.  Just ordered some to give as gifts...because a really good girlfriend   shares her secrets!</li>
    <li> I do not use the Couture Colour hair dying systems, but I do use lightening products from time to time that can be drying. This product has helped immensely with my frizzy dried hair, and it does not add a ton of oil to my scalp. About a quarter size amount helps me comb through my tangled long hair, and keeps the frizzies away for most of the day. My hair is also breaking less, although this may be because I am using other products as well.   I tend to use this on wet hair, and I usually do not use heated styling tools (eg blow dryer, curling iron, flat iron). It adds shine and not greasy and works well with other products. I usually layer Pureology or John Frieda split end-mender on top of this product and I am very pleased the results. Additionally, I use LOTS of hair conditioner which seems to make the product stay in my hair longer.   I give it a four star and not a five because the results are not very dramatic on my hair. I am sure when used over time (I have been using this for about 3 months) this product works better, but for now I need to supplement it with other products.   Hair type: Lightened but not color treated, fine shaft, long and easily tangled, dried and frizzy with a greasy scalp.</li>
    <li> All it takes is just two to three squirts into my hands then I rub my hands together before applying to my wet hair. I blow dry my hair and my hair feels soft, looks shiny but not greasy. Great product!</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B004P2JGW2 Couture Colour Pequi Oil Treatment 2 oz]]  I&#x27;m not a youngster, (over 75!) and have finally found something that tames my naturally curly hair, and brings out the best in every strand!  Also, I tried it on a whim, because I do not, and never have, colored my hair, but it sounded like it was worth a try anyway, and one big problem I have is living in a humid climate.  My message is to every woman who wants better results in self-styling on a daily basis.  This is a reliable product that won&#x27;t let you down.  And you&#x27;ll be proud to suggest it to others, as I am doing.</li>
    <li> Despite being an &#x27;oil&#x27;, Pequi oil treatment is light and non-greasy. It can be used pre-shampoo or post, or for heat styling, making it a very versatile product. It is nice smelling, leaving a wiff of light coconut-like fragrance. Frizzy tresses will become markedly softer and shinier. For the non-steep price, it is rather worth the investment!</li>
    <li> This is a miracle product!  I have very thick and curly hair and have never found a product which tamed my beast like this.  I was even able to flat iron it after blow drying and it is soft as can be.  Straight, shiny, wow!  It has a very nice, subtle scent too which is nice..it&#x27;s not overpowering.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve spent lots of money on products, recently bring a fan of Kerastase, but nothing has ever managed my hair like this without being greasy.  After shampooing, I rub two pumps between my fingers and then throughout my hair, concentrating on the wildest spots.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I love the way it smells, and it really has made my hair feel much silkier and smoother. It&#x27;s a bit over priced, but for now, seems worth it.</li>
    <li> I have invested so much time and money into over-hyped oil treatments that leave me less than enthused about the results. My issue with Moroccanoil is the artificial color added to the product. Macadamia Natural Oil isn&#x27;t that much better...the smell is too overpowering and over all it doesn&#x27;t add strength to my hair. With Couture Colour Pequi Oil Treatment my hair is so soft, shiny, strong, and smooth all in one! It&#x27;s incredible. On top of that, the smell is absolutely divine- like fresh coconuts. When it says it makes your hair 600% stronger and 250% shinier it&#x27;s not lying. My hair was so smooth and felt so healthy after the first application. Several bottles later I can attest to this oil&#x27;s healing properties. If you want an oil treatment that is not going to weigh your hair down, smell fantastic, and actually do what it claims to do then this is the oil for you.</li>
    <li> I would give this product no stars if possible. The product smells nicely tropical but that&#x27;s all I can say that&#x27;s good about it.  I am a caucasian with color treated, thin, white and grey hair with some wiry hairs that I thought this product would help smooth and tame.  Unfortunately it seems the only thing that is going to work is a flat-iron.&lt;br /&gt;  It may work with someone with dry smooth hair but on my wiry hair it did not help at all.  I used about 15 drops for my shoulder length hair and I still did not get a shine even after lightly applying a flat iron. For the price it is not worth it so I have given it 1 star.</li>
    <li> I tried this for the first time last night and already love it. Normally i have to blow dry then set my hair with Velcro rollers to get it to be smooth and shiny. I was too lazy last night to deal with it and thought it would be a good test for this oil. I washed my hair like normal and then used the oil and let my hair mostly air dry before finishing it with the dryer. Love the way my hair turned out. It is soft and sleek and smooth!</li>
    <li> I have curly hair that frizzes in the slightest humidity.  Hoped this product would help.  Did little to curb the frizz.</li>
    <li> My hair is turning grey and wiry.  This product is very expensive, but the only product that smooths my hair out and adds some shine.</li>
    <li> This Oil is AMAZING.  Seriously, you just run it through your hair and blow dry.  It comes out so silky and shiny and soft.  I truly could not believe it.  AMAZING!</li>
    <li> So it turns out that pequi oil itself is derived from a Brazillian nut and they use it in cooking, so if you find \\&quot;pequi oil\\&quot; a lot cheaper, that&#x27;s probably what you&#x27;ve found. This stuff has pequi oil in it, but it has a lot of other ingredients to make it the non-greasy smoothing product it is with the light, yummy scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a deluxe sample of this oil from one of those monthly sample box services and I was super skeptical. I&#x27;m not the biggest fan of moroccan oil or coconut oil in my hair because I feel like my hair doesn&#x27;t absorb it very well, wet or dry. I always end up using too much and having that unattractive \\&quot;wet hair\\&quot; look. Gross.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using this product a few times on wet hair out of the shower, I was pleasantly surprised. First I noticed the scent, which is nice and fruity. Then, I noticed that using about a nickel sized amount made my wet hair feel very smooth and tangle-free. I didn&#x27;t even comb it (which isn&#x27;t abnormal for me--I try to avoid combing my wet hair--but the difference after using this was that I really felt like I didn&#x27;t even need to). And then when it dried, my hair didn&#x27;t look greasy at all. It felt so smooth and maybe looked a little shinier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, let me say that I&#x27;m super, super picky about my hair products and I&#x27;m a bit of a product junkie. I&#x27;m what you&#x27;d call a goo-hoarder. I have tried so many and I currently have probably about ten different hair products and countless samples but this is the ONLY one I ever bought a full size of after trying the sample. I have color-treated hair that is relatively healthy and I have a small issue with frizz on the day that I&#x27;ve washed my hair, but with this stuff I don&#x27;t have to worry about the frizz once it dries.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only reason I give it four instead of five stars is that I feel it&#x27;s a bit expensive for being labelled as \\&quot;pequi\\&quot; oil, and I find it really hasn&#x27;t helped with the health of my hair. I still have split ends and my hair breaks occasionally. But I will definitely repurchase.ionally. But I will definitely repurchase.</li>
    <li> I bought the Couture Colour Hair Colour (which Im in love with) and it came with a sample Pequi oil.  It made my hair SO soft and Shiny that I ordered a bottle the next day - AllI get is compliments on my hair!    Who knew all it took was the right product!</li>
    <li> This product is an excellent choice..leaves hair shining without weight of other oils. But it is not easily available. And ..but a little amount lasts...</li>
    <li> I use this on my hair after i straighten it. It is amazing and makes my hair much softer and not as frizzy.&lt;br /&gt;It also smells absolutely amazing!! Kind of like coconut. It&#x27;s great!! I will use this the rest of my life! I highly recommend it :)</li>
    <li> smells wonderful but to be honest it can be a little oily i have fine hair and 2 pumps is more than enough i mix it with hair creme because i have really curly hair its great then</li>
