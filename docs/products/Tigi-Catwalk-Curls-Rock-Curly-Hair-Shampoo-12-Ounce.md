    <li> lasts  forever, kind to hair</li>
    <li> It might not be a bad shampoo, but it is not for curly hair! Makes my crazy curls frizzy and dry.</li>
    <li> I used it several years ago and Finley found it on your site. Before I thought it maid my hu currier this time it made my hair softer  thanks</li>
    <li> This shampoo cleanses the hair thoroughly on the first attempt.  Massage into scalp as you would any other shampoo, however the difference is felt in the tingling clean sensation.  The curls are nurtured not stripped and frizzy after shampooing.</li>
    <li> This stuff does what it says it will. My hair is fine, thin, and with a natural curl that usually straightens right out when dry and brushed. This shampoo, along with the leave in conditioner, hold the curl, intensifies it, and still leaves my hair soft, manageable, and with plenty of curl that stays in. I like it.</li>
    <li> Love the curls rock line of hair products.</li>
    <li> My favorite shampoo for fine hair. It seems to help my perm to last longer too!</li>
    <li> Leaves hair soft, curly and manageable. Does tend to tangle right out of the shower.</li>
    <li> I ordered it for my wife and she was excited about the product. After using this shampoo, she complained that her hair is getting more tangled and frizzy rather than natural curls. She could not smell any fragrance. She is totally disappointed with the product .</li>
    <li> Having just this year embraced the curl of my hair, this is the product that I prefer over all the shampoos I have purchased to enhance my curls.  It is great!  Will eventually purchase other Curls Rock products!  I do prefer this one the best!</li>
    <li> I order this off amazon for 13 dollars. That is a great price when you consider how much a little goes a long way. I have very long thick curly hair and I have been using it for a month and I still have more then half the bottle. It does define my curls and leave volume in my hair. I use the catwalk curls rock conditioned,amplifier, leave in conditioners and defining serum. Ive been using the line for a month and I have been getting compliments on how shiny it is.one girl thought I had been to the salon.....nope! Just catwalk products. I highly recommend</li>
    <li> I bought like three bottles of shampoo from amazon (availed free shipping because my order total was more than $35). I happened to visit target recently and saw the price of this shampoo there. It actually retailed for $11.99. I know 2 bucks are not a big deal but I could have saved around 6 bucks against my bulk order of three bottles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shampoo is great though. I have curly/wavy but very frizzy hair and have been using the shampoo and conditioner for many years. I get a lot of compliments for my curls always, so much so that I am recognized by my curls. People love my curls.</li>
    <li> love this shampoo it is great for my hair it came to me quickly and i was very satisfied with the whole process.</li>
    <li> Use the combination of the shampoo and conditioner when using this product. I have natural curly hair and found that just using the conditioner still left my hair limp. The shampoo alone left my hair dry. The combination of the shampoo and conditioner work together to crete a more manageable curl, with additional products to apply.</li>
    <li> Have always used TIGI for my natural curly hair.  love it still</li>
    <li> I originally found this shampoo on clearance at Wgreens and fell in love with it.  I am an Afro-American with grade 4d (which really should be 4z because it&#x27;s a very harsh grade of hair) natural hair and have not used any products with harsh chemicals in it but decided to give this a try to see if it would help my hair&#x27;s curl.  BOY DID IT EVER!!!  After the first use, my curls formed what seemed like instantly!!! I was excited when I found it online at Amazon for this price.  I don&#x27;t use it as an all the time wash, just every three washes or so.  I always follow the wash with deep conditioner so it doesnt dry out.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know what the other reviewer is talking about, sounds like you just need to put a larger quantity in your hair? If you don&#x27;t know what to do with your other bottles, I&#x27;ll buy them from you!...Have been using Curls Rock shampoo and conditioner for years. I actually like these products much better than their newer \\&quot;curlesque\\&quot; line. This brings out the curl even when I don&#x27;t use with curly conditioner. I have wavy hair that can go straight or curly. I have tried several high-end \\&quot;curl\\&quot; shampoos bought from my salon and this one without a doubt brings out my curls, makes hair shiny soft and leaves my hair smelling sweet.</li>
    <li> I bought this after reading all the positive reviews. While it is REALLY sudsy stuff so a little goes a long way, it leaves my hair LESS curly and limp. I&#x27;ve been using it daily for over a month now. So sad I bought multiple bottles, don&#x27;t know what to do with them.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent shampoo to use along with the conditioner. If you have permed or naturally curly hair then this is the shampoo for you!</li>
    <li> I shampoo my short, curly hair daily.  Other expensive, salon shampoo&#x27;s left my hair heavy and straight.  Catwalk &amp;#34;ROCKED&amp;#34; my natural curls.  Combined with the Catwalk conditioner, it added even more curl.  I take my products with me now when I visit my stylist.  He agrees, there is definately more body and curls when using these products.</li>
    <li> Love this shampoo for my curly hair!</li>
    <li> This is great shampoo for curly hair. It works great.</li>
    <li> This is a great shampoo if you like the curl in your hair, which I do.  I can style my hair with a tiny bit of styling cream (Bumble and Bumble) while it&#x27;s wet, and then just damp fingers.  NO CURLERS, EVER!</li>
    <li> This made my curls tighter and had an odd smell</li>
