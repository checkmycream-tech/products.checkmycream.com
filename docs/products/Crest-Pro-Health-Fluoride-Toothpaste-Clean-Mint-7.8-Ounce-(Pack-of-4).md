      <li>How awesome is the internet!</li>
      <li>I have excellent oral hygiene and take very good care of my teeth.  </li>
      <li>great product.</li>
      <li>A couple of days after discontinuing use of this toothpaste, the intensity of their rashes has lessened greatly.  </li>
      <li>My mouth was great until I used this for 1 week.</li>
      <li>many people are happy with the product.</li>
      <li>Would wake up during the night choking on my own spit.  </li>
      <li>I take good care of my teeth and have them cleaned every 4 months since I get gingivitis easily.</li>
      <li>The consistency of the toothpaste is more of a runny gel than a paste.  </li>
      <li>and I have pieces of my cheeks falling off with many sores inside my mouth.  </li>
      <li>Well, I kept brushing and was making sure I was using this toothpaste as I just knew it would help.  </li>
      <li>I love Crest toothpaste but refuse to buy Pro Health.</li>
      <li>I went to my dentist to confirm this, and she told me to STOP using this toothpaste IMMEDIATELY, and that she had seen many patients who were experiencing problems with this product.</li>
      <li>, I wish I had paid more attention to that before.</li>
      <li>I just visited my sister and used her Oral B toothpaste and came home with the same incredibly sore mouth!</li>
      <li>I started to think the toothpaste may not be safe.  </li>
      <li>I tried brushing more and more.  </li>
      <li>the sodium fluoride is better.  </li>
      <li>But since there are so many complaints, if you haven&#x27;t tried it yet-- why not pick a product that doesn&#x27;t have so many complaints?</li>
      <li>and we all know how famous China is for it&#x27;s poisonous products.  </li>
      <li>and I think the people using the rinse suffered from brown spots more..</li>
      <li>I see that many people have listed this review as &#x27;unhelpful&#x27;.</li>
      <li>She suppected it was a stannous fluoride rinse, but my rinse was ok, it was the toothpaste.</li>
      <li>and I woke up every morning with THE most HORRID taste in my mouth.  </li>
      <li>There&#x27;s also a cinnamon flavor that really isn&#x27;t what you&#x27;d expect from a toothpaste, but is kind of nice.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Summary :::&lt;br /&gt;Crest makes some fine products.  </li>
      <li>It was a free sample from the dentist.  </li>
      <li>a light brown tint to them.  </li>
      <li>and I was yeast free.</li>
      <li>Much to my relief my dentist was able to remove most of it.</li>
      <li>I am simply giving of my own time to write this review to spare others the anxiety that I went through!</li>
      <li>It felt like a cluster of canker sores at first, but after four days of it not getting better, I realized it was a reaction to this toothpaste.</li>
      <li>and I would rather not brush my teeth until I get a new kind than brush with this ever again..</li>
      <li>B000FUIPVG Crest Pro Health Toothpaste, Clean Mint]]  </li>
      <li>Can&#x27;t say much about what it does for the teeth because most of it winds up on the counter.  </li>
      <li>Mild whitening.</li>
      <li>Sure enough, after I stopped use of the toothpaste, the insides of my cheeks stopping coming off and there weren&#x27;t any more stains.</li>
      <li>I was 21 weeks pregnant at the time, so I was worried it was thrush brought on by pregnancy, but no, my doctors tested me for that</li>
      <li>I&#x27;d been brushing my teeth more frequently, because they seemed coffee-stained and never felt clean.  </li>
      <li>Honestly, I was constantly finding this turquoise goo all over the bathroom.  </li>
      <li>I see that many other people experienced the same thing.</li>
      <li>I am just thankful I bumped into the right place on the internet.  </li>
      <li>Funny thing is now I notice a warning about stains right on the tube.</li>
      <li>Then I started getting white strings of &#x27;whatever&#x27; from the insides of my top and bottom lips, the inside of my cheeks and even my lips themselves.  </li>
      <li>One would think that the P&amp;G product manager for this product would have tested it better prior to launch.</li>
      <li>This is the first stannous flouride option on the market that I&#x27;m aware of in years.    </li>
      <li>This toothpaste leaked all over my travel bag, as the top would not close properly.</li>
      <li>First of all, it makes brown stains in your teeth.</li>
      <li>You&#x27;ll see MANY people who&#x27;ve had similar horror stories.</li>
      <li>, I started getting these strands of a thick white mucous type of &#x27;glob&#x27; (best I can describe it) along the sides of my tongue that would goop up</li>
      <li>It caused the skin inside my mouth to peel after I brush my teeth - big stringy globs of skin - this can&#x27;t be good for my mouth  - isn&#x27;t mouth cancer caused by constant irritation of the tissue?   </li>
      <li>If not for the blogs and reviews about the products - who knows how long I may have suffered along with many others.</li>
      <li>I developed a super ichy rash on my forearms.  </li>
      <li>because while this toothpaste worked fine for us tooth-wise, it was a utter disaster bathroom-wise.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Also, I honestly was noticing that my teeth were starting to look more dull and</li>
      <li>I really wish this product would be ripped off of every shelf...</li>
      <li>Not spots of staining but my whole tooth.  </li>
      <li>--I really don&#x27;t know what&#x27;s going on there, but if anything like that happens to anyone I guess they should see their dentist ASAP.    </li>
      <li>This was unusual for me.</li>
      <li>Please sign the petition at [...] and let&#x27;s get Proctor and Gamble to admit the problems and take action!!!</li>
      <li>There are so many other toothpastes to choose from.</li>
      <li>I went back to my old toothpaste and everything is fine now.     </li>
      <li>The main advantage of Crest Pro-Health is that it uses stannous flouride instead of sodium flouride.  </li>
      <li>Hmmm, somehow this one must have slipped through quality control because it&#x27;s obvious that the goop inside easily finds its way out of the tube and onto your bathroom counters and from there it gets on everything else in the general area!  </li>
      <li>It was from the highly promoted \\&quot;alcohol-free\\&quot; mouthwash.  </li>
      <li>Stannous flouride is better for your teeth, but sodium flouride has a longer shelf life and is a little cheaper.  </li>
      <li>This is not a common allergy, but nonetheless, should be considered if someone is experiencing a rash.  </li>
      <li>Third, my gums are burning and have red blisters and it feels like my mouth is full of canker sores!</li>
      <li>so this was new to me that a toothpaste could cause this.</li>
      <li>I just moved and started a new job that I can&#x27;t go to because my lips are triple the size with cuts and bleeding.  </li>
      <li>By Feb I had developed a pronounced discoloration on my teeth, particularly between teeth.</li>
      <li>After using this product for only one week, the inside of my mouth has sores and my tongue feels like it has been burnt on hot soup.  </li>
      <li>I immediately went back to the regular Crest Clean Mint Toothpaste I used before</li>
      <li>My gums are so sensitive they bleed when brushing</li>
      <li>I have an extra tongue underneath my real tongue made up of sores.  </li>
      <li>I have never had a problem with sensitive teeth before</li>
      <li>Sometimes I think it must be alive...  </li>
      <li>After 3 days of use, my teeth became extremely sensitive.</li>
      <li>so naturally I thought that my stomach was having some gastritis problems as sometimes a coating on the tongue will be a result of that.  </li>
      <li>Kind of like that morning slime, except far worse, and it did it all the time.  </li>
      <li>Rather than assuming that my story is too far fetched to actually be true, why not simply do a quick google search on Crest Pro Health stains?</li>
      <li>Also, many other customers have written about the &#x27;mouth-slime&#x27; skin-peeling effect on the other Crest Pro Health product page here at Amazon:</li>
      <li>I went right out and bought a different tube (different brand and everything, no way I am trusting Crest any longer) and my mouth STOPPED PEELING the very next DAY.</li>
      <li>I originally used this to stop a sensitive tooth, but a few days after I started to use it on a regular basis</li>
      <li>(he apparently just thought his teeth needed to be cleaned!), and I have had some others.</li>
      <li>I was very concerned when I noticed after brushing that the inside of my mouth felt shriveled and very dry.  </li>
      <li>Going back to my old toothpaste.    </li>
      <li>This is finally clearing up after stopping the product and using cortisone cream on my lips to calm down the irritation.    </li>
      <li>About a week ago, I noticed that my white tongue started turning a light grey color and it burned a little</li>
      <li>And reading all the other much scarier comments about it just reinforces that decision.</li>
      <li>As a young woman, I didn&#x27;t know what had just happened,... as my teeth went from pearly white to mottled brown in a short time.</li>
      <li>So I started using it more frequently, only to find that the problem was worse.  </li>
      <li>Apparently they are allergic to the stannous fluoride (versus sodium fluoride which is found in regular Crest).  </li>
      <li>It tastes a little different the first couple times, but I&#x27;ve been using it for months now and have no issues there.  </li>
      <li>So much so that I threw half a tube away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This is a terrible product.  After three days of use, yes three days,my lower front teeth were so sensitive that I could hardly eat.  If I touched the teeth, I was in horrible pain.  I also ended up with blood blisters inside my mouth.  The pain stopped after I stopped using the mouth wash, but I wondered and still wonder what the product did to my teeth.</li>
    <li> I finally got sick and tired of the goopy mess this product made as it constantly oozed out of the tube because the lid doesn&#x27;t close properly.  I called CREST and complained and the customer representative assured me their products go through \\&quot;extensive testing\\&quot;.  Hmmm, somehow this one must have slipped through quality control because it&#x27;s obvious that the goop inside easily finds its way out of the tube and onto your bathroom counters and from there it gets on everything else in the general area!  Sometimes I think it must be alive...  What a horrible mess this product by CREST makes.  Can&#x27;t say much about what it does for the teeth because most of it winds up on the counter.  Sorry CREST, but this product is horrible.</li>
    <li> My husband and I had barely used half a tube of this awful stuff when he complained to me that it left a \\&quot;film\\&quot; in his mouth.  I&#x27;d been brushing my teeth more frequently, because they seemed coffee-stained and never felt clean.  It never occurred to me for a minute that my toothpaste could be the CAUSE of it!  I went online and found all these complaints!  I&#x27;m writing here to offset that phony 5-star rating that was probably submitted by somebody who works for Proctor &amp; Gamble.  There&#x27;s no other explanation for that \\&quot;review,\\&quot; because this stuff is awful on every level.</li>
    <li> I originally used this to stop a sensitive tooth, but a few days after I started to use it on a regular basis I developed a super ichy rash on my forearms.  The rash went away as soon as I stopped using the toothpaste.  I am allergic to the type of floride they use in this product.  The tooth sensitivity did go away, but the rash was really unpleasant.</li>
    <li> I initially bought Crest Pro-Health for my husband in December 2007.  A few weeks after, he began to experience a rash and itching on his legs and arms.  We didn&#x27;t link it to the change in toothpaste, not realizing that a product as common as toothpaste could cause a rash elsewhere on your body.  Therefore, he had continued to use this toothpaste, with the rash persisting, until recently.   In July of 2008, I bought the same toothpaste for my teenage daughter.  A few weeks after, she also began to experience a rash and itching on her legs and arms.  After consulting the doctor and reviewing any recent changes that may be causing this rash, Crest Pro-Health was the only change that occurred.  A couple of days after discontinuing use of this toothpaste, the intensity of their rashes has lessened greatly.  Apparently they are allergic to the stannous fluoride (versus sodium fluoride which is found in regular Crest).  This is not a common allergy, but nonetheless, should be considered if someone is experiencing a rash.  I will not be buying this product again, nor will I buy any other products with stannous flouride.</li>
    <li> This is an absolutely horrible product. I cannot believe I got suckered into buying a 4-pack of this garbage. After 3 days of use, my teeth became extremely sensitive. My gums and teeth had this dull pain all the time and anything hot or cold was agony. I have never had a problem with sensitive teeth before so this was new to me that a toothpaste could cause this. Very odd considering it \\&quot;claims\\&quot; to help with sensitivity, if helping means give you sensitive teeth then mission completed. I immediately stopped using the toothpaste and threw all 4 packs in the garbage. I went back to my old toothpaste and everything is fine now.     I can also agree about the lousy cap that doesnt close and the runny paste that leaks out.    Crest should be ashamed for putting out such a horrible product. Customers should avoid this toothpaste.</li>
    <li> I take good care of my teeth and have them cleaned every 4 months since I get gingivitis easily. I decided to try this toothpaste. I have been using it for about 2 months with no problems but last night I noticed my teeth had some brown stains on them. I looked at the back of the tube and it said it could stain teeth, I wish I had paid more attention to that before. The last thing I want from a toothpaste is stains so I have to give this toothpaste a poor rating.</li>
    <li> I just have to write a review on this product for other moms (dads, aunts, grandfathers...) because while this toothpaste worked fine for us tooth-wise, it was a utter disaster bathroom-wise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For whatever reason, Crest Pro-Health is less viscous than Crest&#x27;s other toothpastes.  This means that if you have children who don&#x27;t put the cap back on the tube that you can expect a big pool of sticky fluid waiting for you in the morning.  Honestly, I was constantly finding this turquoise goo all over the bathroom.  So much so that I threw half a tube away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Summary :::&lt;br /&gt;Crest makes some fine products.  I didn&#x27;t find anything wrong with Pro-Health except that it&#x27;s messy.  Consequently I&#x27;d advise people with small children in the house (or absent minded partners) to buy something else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pam T~</li>
    <li> The consistency of the toothpaste is more of a runny gel than a paste.  If you don&#x27;t close the cap all the way, it will leak out.  Leaves an odd chemical aftertaste.</li>
    <li> I was having a terrible problem with the inside of my gums around my mouth becoming inflammed and sore and then chapped lips that I could not get relief from. I thought of everything and finally it occurred to me that it started when I began using the toothpaste. This is finally clearing up after stopping the product and using cortisone cream on my lips to calm down the irritation.    Beware of this product..........and it leaves a horrible after taste, not like freshly brushed teeth should feel.</li>
    <li> I concur with the other negative reviews and I only wish I had read them before I bought the toothpaste. Yes it does leave your teeth cleaner and whiter, but at what risk? You have a gross sticky film in your mouth that needs to be cleaned off or it can be embarassing. I also experience increased sensitivity in my teeth and gums. My tongue hurts and the area beneath my gums is very painful now. My mouth is a mess after 1 week of using this toothpaste. Another things it that this is the runniest, messiest toothpaste I&#x27;ve ever seen. The toothpaste keeps running out long after you stop squeezing. It gets stuck on the cap making it hard for the cap to close. It&#x27;s just a mess. Research this product on google before you buy it. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> After using this product for only one week, the inside of my mouth has sores and my tongue feels like it has been burnt on hot soup.  I thought I had an infection in my mouth.  After reading about this product online, I realize it is the crest pro health products.  My dentist recommended these products.  I am discontinuing use of these products immediately and hope the pain and irritation subside.</li>
    <li> I never thought I&#x27;d have to write a negative review of a toothpaste...I mean, you think it&#x27;s a toothpaste after all from a reputable company, how bad could it really be?    Initially when I was using it, I completely freaked out looking in the mirror after rinsing my mouth and saw terrible brown stains all over my teeth. As a young woman, I didn&#x27;t know what had just happened,... as my teeth went from pearly white to mottled brown in a short time. I didn&#x27;t know initially where the stains came from, but I was horrified, and thought an emergency visit to the dentist was needed (as I couldn&#x27;t go out of the house otherwise). I know this all sounds dramatic-- but I&#x27;m not exaggerating-- it&#x27;s just that it was THAT bad. If you don&#x27;t believe this... Google &#x27;Crest Pro-Health toothpaste and stains&#x27; and see the numerous customer complaints.    For the next few days, as I continued to use the paste (not knowing what was happening), I also noticed that some slimy rubbery stuff was all over my lips and inside my mouth. I kept having to pick it out of my mouth throughout the day, and I didn&#x27;t know what the heck that was. I started realizing shortly later that the white slimy/rubbery stuff was actually the insides of my cheek coming off in layers. Panicking, I told my mother about this (who is a physician). I told her I thought I might have gotten some disease in my mouth. She told me \\&quot;It&#x27;s the toothpaste!\\&quot; She was having similar problems after using Crest Pro-Health toothpaste, which cleared up after she stopped.     Sure enough, after I stopped use of the toothpaste, the insides of my cheeks stopping coming off and there weren&#x27;t any more stains. Thank goodness! I can&#x27;t believe this product isn&#x27;t revoked from the market entirely, and the company doesn&#x27;t make amends to people who have used this product.    UPDATE (Feb 2008): I see that many people have listed this review as &#x27;unhelpful&#x27;. I&#x27;m surprised, because I put a lot of effort into my reviews to help other people. Rather than assuming that my story is too far fetched to actually be true, why not simply do a quick google search on Crest Pro Health stains? You&#x27;ll see MANY people who&#x27;ve had similar horror stories. Obviously not everyone has problems... many people are happy with the product. But since there are so many complaints, if you haven&#x27;t tried it yet-- why not pick a product that doesn&#x27;t have so many complaints? There are so many other toothpastes to choose from. Also, many other customers have written about the &#x27;mouth-slime&#x27; skin-peeling effect on the other Crest Pro Health product page here at Amazon: [[ASIN:B000FUIPVG Crest Pro Health Toothpaste, Clean Mint]]  I have nothing to gain from sharing my story, as it&#x27;s not like I am the CEO of a competitor toothpaste company. I am simply giving of my own time to write this review to spare others the anxiety that I went through!</li>
    <li> To me, toothpaste is toothpaste, but my dentist recommended this one. I have tried it several times and every tube I&#x27;ve purchased leaks all over the place. Until they fix this I am not buying it anymore. I&#x27;m tired of cleaning the sink and wasting my money by having the toothpaste leak out of the tube - down the drain (literally!)</li>
    <li> I started using Crest Pro-Health night toothpaste in January. By Feb I had developed a pronounced discoloration on my teeth, particularly between teeth. It looked like I chewed tobacco. I tried brushing harder, flossing more and mouthwashes, but it continued to get worse. I went to my regular dentist appt expecting to be told my teeth were rotting away. Much to my relief my dentist was able to remove most of it. It has be be scrapped off. She suppected it was a stannous fluoride rinse, but my rinse was ok, it was the toothpaste. This is a horribe product.</li>
    <li> great product. My teeth are much less sensitive after using this product. No adverse reactions. Mild whitening.</li>
    <li> Purchased from Costco in a four pack.  Started having gunk build up in my mouth.  Kind of like that morning slime, except far worse, and it did it all the time.  I&#x27;ve had excessive salivation because of it too.  Would wake up during the night choking on my own spit.  Finally put two and two together, quit using it for a few days, and saw an improvement.  Decided to Google it today, reviews here, reviews elsewhere, this is an awful product.  My husband has been complaining about mouth sores, found another site with reviews and mouth sores complaints.  He&#x27;s been using their mouthwash for quite some time with no issues.  Can&#x27;t believe Crest put this stuff out there.</li>
    <li> Warning!!!! Don&#x27;t buy this toothpaste - I have NEVER had any problems with  toothpaste until I started using the Crest Pro-Health.  It caused the skin inside my mouth to peel after I brush my teeth - big stringy globs of skin - this can&#x27;t be good for my mouth  - isn&#x27;t mouth cancer caused by constant irritation of the tissue?   There should be a lawsuit against this company - it&#x27;s probably made in China and we all know how famous China is for it&#x27;s poisonous products.  I&#x27;m going back to using Biotene.</li>
    <li> I cannot believe this crap.  I am in-between jobs and have excellent health except for using crest pro-health toothpaste.  I just moved and started a new job that I can&#x27;t go to because my lips are triple the size with cuts and bleeding.  My gums are so sensitive they bleed when brushing and I have pieces of my cheeks falling off with many sores inside my mouth.  I have an extra tongue underneath my real tongue made up of sores.  I cannot eat or drink without severe pain. It started with a film in my mouth followed by blood blisters and then came the rest of hell&#x27;s angels. I will never buy crest again and feel they owe me and other a LOT of $.  False advertising, pain and suffering, medical bills, and loss of work.  I wish this feeling on no one and hope Crest will do the right thing and take this crap off the market and admit their wrongs.</li>
    <li> I got my teeth cleaned two weeks ago, after which I purchased this product.  I usually use natural products, but have been having some increased sensitivity so I decided to get this for the fluoride.  I have excellent oral hygiene and take very good care of my teeth.  I was very concerned when I noticed after brushing that the inside of my mouth felt shriveled and very dry.  A few days later, I noticed terrible dark brown stains all over the bases and contacts of my teeth.  I tried brushing more and more.  It got worse and worse.  And the product left a bad tasted in my mouth - my breath was not fresh.  Also, a few hours after brushing my teeth, I felt a terrible film all over my teeth - as if I hadn&#x27;t brushed at all.  I started to think the toothpaste may not be safe.  So I google \\&quot;brown stains on teeth\\&quot; and this product flooded my search results as the culprit.  I was shocked - and yet vindicated - I knew it.  So disappointed in Crest.  Had been using them since I was a kid - now never again.  Now I&#x27;m going to have to spend $200 to get my teeth cleaned.  And I see now the warnings all over the tube for staining.  Why in the hell would I buy a whitening tooth paste that turns my teeth brown??!!  The funny thing is that if you search the product on Crest&#x27;s website, it has very poor ratings, but only due to packaging complaints.  It seems Crest must have deleted every comment regarding staining.  So disappointing.  Shame on Crest.</li>
    <li> This toothpaste has a horrible lingering artificial-sweet aftertaste that lasted hours after I used it.  It made my coffee and bagel taste horrible even a couple hours later.  I won&#x27;t use it again.  It was a free sample from the dentist.  And reading all the other much scarier comments about it just reinforces that decision.</li>
    <li> I am only giving one star as it won&#x27;t let me give a &#x27;zero&#x27; rating.  I started using this thinking that I would be doing my gums and mouth a favor.  NOT!  I used it for awhile and noticed that my tongue started getting a white coating on it.  I have gastro tummy issues so naturally I thought that my stomach was having some gastritis problems as sometimes a coating on the tongue will be a result of that.  So, naively I used this toothpaste night and day thinking that it would help my problem.  After awhile, it was instantaneous, I started getting these strands of a thick white mucous type of &#x27;glob&#x27; (best I can describe it) along the sides of my tongue that would goop up and I would literally have to grab it and take it off of my tongue.  It was GROSS!  Then I started getting white strings of &#x27;whatever&#x27; from the insides of my top and bottom lips, the inside of my cheeks and even my lips themselves.  Well, I kept brushing and was making sure I was using this toothpaste as I just knew it would help.  About a week ago, I noticed that my white tongue started turning a light grey color and it burned a little and I woke up every morning with THE most HORRID taste in my mouth.  It was indescribable, it was that bad.  Severe dry mouth; horrid taste; grey tongue.  THEN, just when I thought it couldn&#x27;t get any worse, my teeth looked really dingy and like a taupe color...a light brown tint to them.  Not spots of staining but my whole tooth.  I didn&#x27;t know what was going on...it was starting to freak me out.  I don&#x27;t have the money to go to the dentist!  So I started &#x27;searching&#x27; and everything started coming up with Crest Pro Health Toothpaste.  I have seen site after site; page upon page of people having the same experience.  I searched the active ingredient in Pro Health and it is Stannous Fluoride.  This chemical causes all of the above side effects...all of them!  I immediately went back to the regular Crest Clean Mint Toothpaste I used before and I IMMEDIATELY felt and saw a difference.  I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this to anyone!!!!  For the life of me, I do NOT understand how this toothpaste can even be on the market!  It should be removed immediately!!  DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT - trust me, it may take awhile, but you, too, will be sorry.difference.  I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this to anyone!!!!

    <li> This toothpaste leaked all over my travel bag, as the top would not close properly. I threw it out and went back to colgate. One would think that the P&amp;G product manager for this product would have tested it better prior to launch.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Crest Pro-Health toothpaste for a few weeks now. I&#x27;ve never had issues with brown spots like some people seem to have, but my husband has (he apparently just thought his teeth needed to be cleaned!), and I have had some others. For a while now I&#x27;ve been having a throbbing sensation in my gums and teeth that I thought was due to unknowingly clenching my teeth... on a whim today I decided to do some research to see if it could possibly be related to the toothpaste, and to my surprise, quite a few other people are having a similar experience. I&#x27;ve also had the nasty stringy/mucousy stuff, though that&#x27;s not as bad when I rinse my mouth well with water afterward. I&#x27;m throwing this stuff away tonight... they ought to take it off the market.</li>
    <li> After just a day or so of use, I woke up in the morning and pulled out about 10 globs of white gunky slime from my mouth.. I was so terrified that I was getting moderate gingivitis or some other disease.  So I started using it more frequently, only to find that the problem was worse.  Mind you, I always have hated this toothpaste because of it&#x27;s consistency and taste because it also leaves a HORRID aftertaste that will stay with you all day long.. but anyways, since I&#x27;ve never had numerous globs of white goo coming out of my mouth before, I was starting to freak out because they are nasty.  I am just thankful I bumped into the right place on the internet.  Some forum discussed a girl that had the same problem and someone asked if she was using Crest Pro Health toothpaste.. and she sure was, as well as many other people on the board that were shocked to find out the culprit!  Needless to say, I immediately threw out the tube and I would rather not brush my teeth until I get a new kind than brush with this ever again.. Also, I honestly was noticing that my teeth were starting to look more dull and ..well.. nasty for a lack of a better word.  I don&#x27;t have brown spots to my knowledge yet, but I wasn&#x27;t using the mouthwash and I think the people using the rinse suffered from brown spots more.. but anyways, I was apalled to find this out.  I really wish this product would be ripped off of every shelf...</li>
    <li> I too experienced the horrible brown staining by the gumline.  My dentist was appalled and coudn&#x27;t get it all off.  It was from the highly promoted \\&quot;alcohol-free\\&quot; mouthwash.  It is disgusting that this is allowed to be pushed to the public with no warning.  Beware!</li>
    <li> I started using the Crest Pro-Health toothpast a couple weeks ago and have too began experiencing the gross, slimy film substance in my mouth.  I suspected the Crest toothpaste, did an internet search and see I am not alone.  I hope I haven&#x27;t done any permanent damage to my mouth by using this product. I have tossed it in the trash and will never use that product again.</li>
    <li> I purchased this toothpaste because I had a coupon for it, in a three pack, from a bulk store where I shop. About a week after using it, I noticed that my mouth felt odd after brushing... My mouth felt slimy. Not unclean dirty-slimy... but slippery slimy. My throat would feel almost clogged as well. Then I realized what was happening: The insides of my cheeks and lips were peeling off! My throat felt clogged because there were clumps of mouth skin collecting on the back of my tongue. I was 21 weeks pregnant at the time, so I was worried it was thrush brought on by pregnancy, but no, my doctors tested me for that and I was yeast free. I happened to Google search the peeling mouth problem, combined with extreme sensitivity and sore gums that I was also experiencing and came across HUNDREDS of complaints about this toothpaste.     I went to my dentist to confirm this, and she told me to STOP using this toothpaste IMMEDIATELY, and that she had seen many patients who were experiencing problems with this product. I went right out and bought a different tube (different brand and everything, no way I am trusting Crest any longer) and my mouth STOPPED PEELING the very next DAY. I was relieved of my gum pain and my tooth sensitivity in almost three days.  I have never in my 27 years of life in America had such an experience with a product that is expressly made to go INTO your mouth!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t understand how this is for sale. First of all, it makes brown stains in your teeth. Second of all, it leaves a slimy stringy residue in your mouth. Third, my gums are burning and have red blisters and it feels like my mouth is full of canker sores! My mouth was great until I used this for 1 week. That&#x27;s all it took to turn my mouth into a painful mess. I&#x27;m very upset about this waste of money and how uncomfortable I feel as a result of brushing my teeth. I couldn&#x27;t figure out what was happening until I googled it.</li>
    <li> Please do not buy this product. The cap design and the consistency of the toothpaste make for a mess in your bathroom and a waste of the toothpase. Even if you close the cap the toothpaste leaks and gets wasted. I would hate to think Crest purposly trying to get people to buy more toothpaste sooner. I love Crest toothpaste but refuse to buy Pro Health. It wouldn&#x27;t get even one star if I had a choice.</li>
    <li> Horrible scary symptoms!!!  Terrible experience with Pro-Health. If not for the blogs and reviews about the products - who knows how long I may have suffered along with many others. Please sign the petition at [...] and let&#x27;s get Proctor and Gamble to admit the problems and take action!!!</li>
    <li> After two days of using this product, I developed a painful rash in my lower lip and under my tongue. It felt like a cluster of canker sores at first, but after four days of it not getting better, I realized it was a reaction to this toothpaste. What trash!</li>
    <li> I got this toothpaste because it was clinically proven to improve gum health. After about two weeks, however, I noticed some brown discoloration starting between my bottom teeth. I also notice a weird film sometimes in my mouth that seems like sloughed off layers of cheek. Finding all that odd, I googled it and landed here. I see that many other people experienced the same thing. How awesome is the internet! It democratizes clinical research. Going back to my old toothpaste.    Funny thing is now I notice a warning about stains right on the tube.</li>
    <li> The main advantage of Crest Pro-Health is that it uses stannous flouride instead of sodium flouride.  Stannous flouride is better for your teeth, but sodium flouride has a longer shelf life and is a little cheaper.  This is the first stannous flouride option on the market that I&#x27;m aware of in years.    It tastes a little different the first couple times, but I&#x27;ve been using it for months now and have no issues there.  The review with the lady with the teeth issues--I really don&#x27;t know what&#x27;s going on there, but if anything like that happens to anyone I guess they should see their dentist ASAP.    There&#x27;s also a cinnamon flavor that really isn&#x27;t what you&#x27;d expect from a toothpaste, but is kind of nice.</li>
    <li> Terrible product. It has stanasfluoride in it which stains teeth. I went to the dentist today and the hygienist asked me, have you been using Crest Pro Health? I about fell off my chair because I have been using it.  She told me they are recommending all patients to not use toothpaste with this type of fluoride as it stains teeth and the sodium fluoride is better.  I had to endure a solid hour of teeth scraping and I brush with an electric toothbrush, flosh and use a waterpik every day!  This was unusual for me. DON&#x27;T USE THIS PRODUCT!</li>
    <li> I tried the Crest Pro-Health and didn&#x27;t have any staining just the horrible bumps on my gums and under my tongue. I never bought it again. I just visited my sister and used her Oral B toothpaste and came home with the same incredibly sore mouth! I compared ingredients and they both have stannous fluoride! Be sure to read the labels of any toothpaste if you have a bad reaction to Crest Pro-Health.</li>
