      <li>Overall, a nice appearance.  </li>
      <li>It came quickly and exactly as ordered, I would order again.</li>
      <li>Thank you very much, lots of compliments</li>
      <li>This claw clasp was pretty, but it was heavier than I thought would be.</li>
      <li>It looks expensive and is a great accessory for an updo!</li>
      <li>This is a pretty metal butterfly hair clip.  </li>
      <li>how pretty it is.  </li>
      <li>Exactly the size I wanted.</li>
      <li>Pretty.  </li>
      <li>I bought this clip because it was a metal clip and it is pretty.  </li>
      <li>this was smaller then expected, my own fault for not reading more closely.</li>
      <li>The clip is really cute, but man, it is TINY!</li>
      <li>It has lasted a long time and the teeth are very strong, but I don&#x27;t wear it much.</li>
      <li>It hold hair very well and goes with many different styles.</li>
      <li>--It&#x27;s a pretty clip with the rhinestone but pretty tiny for most adult hair.</li>
      <li>It would be great if it was bigger, but it is completely made if a strong metal, is pretty, and stays in my thick hair.</li>
      <li>Not a waste of money , a real bargain !!</li>
      <li>Much nicer than a plastic clip.</li>
      <li>It is very durable and I have had compliments on this.  </li>
      <li>so they work very well for me.</li>
      <li>I was excited to receive this in the mail since my current (plastic) one broke.  </li>
      <li>Love these little clips.</li>
      <li>I have long hair and use this for a quick updo when getting dressed up to go out.</li>
      <li>The two stars I gave it were for it&#x27;s pretty style only.</li>
      <li>May not be suitable for those with very fine or thin hair as it is a heavy clip.</li>
      <li>Really cute, a little small for my head full of hair, but I knew that..</li>
      <li>It is of heavy metal construction which is great for my thick hair.</li>
      <li>I was pleasantly surprised at the quality too.  </li>
      <li>I would give it more stars , but just for me it was to heavy and slipped out of my hair enough to tell me to move on .</li>
      <li>I will be uploading a picture with this review, of the clip next to a pen, so you can get a sense of how tiny it really is.&lt;br /&gt;If</li>
      <li>Very pretty and hold well, but a tad heavy.  </li>
      <li>I have SUPER thick hair, and this holds a substantial amount very well, and is fairly low profile.</li>
      <li>I would only recommend it for someone with VERY thick hair that is not too fine or straight.</li>
      <li>This clip is really pretty but much smaller than expected.  </li>
      <li>Even though I have a lot of hair,  this heavy clip just fell right out.  </li>
      <li>This hair clip is very pretty and decorative, but it is made entirely of metal and is extremely heavy.</li>
      <li>A little large, but works!</li>
      <li>that&#x27;s why I&#x27;m giving it four stars, it tends not to hold my hair tight unless I put it in a ponytail first.</li>
      <li>It looks very pretty and would probably work for someone with thick curly hair.</li>

<li> This is only for a small portion of hair, not for the whole head of hair...</li>
<li> I normally like the metal clips because they are sturdy and can handle the abuse of everyday use (plus kids).  </li>
<li> The product is well made and should last a very long time.</li>
<li> Because of the color and sparkles, the hinge is far less noticeable, too.  </li>
<li> but it is so small I am not sure it will even fit over a pony tail rubber band.  </li>
<li> The clip is pretty but very small.</li>
<li> It is about 1.5 inches long, and about 1 inch in depth and width.  </li>
<li> I&#x27;m trying to find a very pretty clip to use in summer to pull all my hair up and back, and sadly this just isn&#x27;t it.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s a really pretty clip... but waaaay too small for me!!</li>
<li> I come from a long line of HAIR!!</li>
<li> I imagine, when I actually use it, it will only go around a small pony tail or side clip.</li>
<li> The weight of it makes it very uncomfortable to wear, and also pulls it right out of my rather fine, thin hair.</li>
<li> Pretty little clip but is very small</li>
<li> This was a little smaller than I thought it would be</li>
<li> THE ITEM WAS NOT AS I EXPECTED IT TO BE.</li>
<li> I don&#x27;t think it will hold a full bun for thick hair, possibly thin.</li>
<li> then I expected!  </li>
<li> wont break like other flimsy clips.</li>
<li> Again, I should have paid attention to the other reviews.</li>
<li> The last one I purchased was missing a few of the decorative stones.</li>
<li> I was going to return it, but have decided that I am going to gift it to a friend who has thick, coarse wavy hair, and see if it works for her.</li>
<li> It is very small, it only will go around, say your index finger.</li>
<li> I got is a few weeks ago and have been using it every day/every other day.  </li>
<li> You can actually tell the size of this clip by looking at the rhinestones which are approximately 3mm in diameter.</li>
<li> I cannot give them to my granddaughter because they are way to heavy.  </li>

    <li> This Is A Beautiful  clip and will&lt;br /&gt; purchase again .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THANK YOU! !!!</li>
    <li> This hair clip is very pretty and decorative, but it is made entirely of metal and is extremely heavy. The weight of it makes it very uncomfortable to wear, and also pulls it right out of my rather fine, thin hair. I would only recommend it for someone with VERY thick hair that is not too fine or straight. The two stars I gave it were for it&#x27;s pretty style only. I was going to return it, but have decided that I am going to gift it to a friend who has thick, coarse wavy hair, and see if it works for her.</li>
    <li> I bought this clip because it was a metal clip and it is pretty.  I normally like the metal clips because they are sturdy and can handle the abuse of everyday use (plus kids).  This was a little smaller than I thought it would be but that is great because my hair is shorter.  I got is a few weeks ago and have been using it every day/every other day.  I picked it up on Friday and one of the circles that hold it together was broken!!  I was annoyed but it was still usuable so I just kept using it, until this morning that is.  I tried to use it this morning and the hole thing fell apart on me.  I am disappointed about the clip and wouldn&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
    <li> This claw clasp was pretty, but it was heavier than I thought would be. Also it was smaller than I wished it had been. I&#x27;m trying to find a very pretty clip to use in summer to pull all my hair up and back, and sadly this just isn&#x27;t it.</li>
    <li> When I found this clip I didn&#x27;t  know from the picture how pretty it is.  I was pleasantly surprised at the quality too.  Being used to the cheap plastic claw clips, the weight of this one is a wonderful change.  I have to find more of these clips - to give my friends before one of them \\&quot;borrows\\&quot; mine!</li>
    <li> I come from a long line of HAIR!! Me being, Arabian and Mexican i have POW in your face curly thick black hair that goes to my belly button!!  It can hold about a fourth of my hair and that is it, it was a lot smaller then I expected!  It is very lovely though.  It has lasted a long time and the teeth are very strong, but I don&#x27;t wear it much.</li>
    <li> I love these things, light weight and beautiful, I&#x27;ve been buying them for years.</li>
    <li> Again, I should have paid attention to the other reviews. The size is completely wrong. It is very small, it only will go around, say your index finger. I imagine, when I actually use it, it will only go around a small pony tail or side clip. It did arrive with all the stones in it. I did expect it to be much larger by the looks of the picture and the written description.</li>
    <li> My cousin had this clip and lost it bought it for her as a replacement her last one she had for 3 years.</li>
    <li> Love these little clips. Wanted something that would look nice with my now grey/silver hair and these are perfect. Small but I like to pin my curly hair up in sections so they work very well for me.</li>
    <li> A lot smaller than it looks</li>
    <li> I was excited to receive this in the mail since my current (plastic) one broke.  I just got it and while the rest of the description is correct and I like the way it looks, the dimensions are completely wrong just like the other reviewer stated before me.  This is way way too small.  I should have paid closer attention to her review.</li>
    <li> It would be great if it was bigger, but it is completely made if a strong metal, is pretty, and stays in my thick hair. Would love to find a full size version.</li>
    <li> This Karina Sonnet Rhinestone Claw Clip makes your hair style look so dressy. I have long hair and use this for a quick updo when getting dressed up to go out. The product is well made and should last a very long time.</li>
    <li> Pretty but too small. Dimensions are not as described at all! Thought could be used as pony tail holder....lucky to hold a child&#x27;s hair that&#x27;s thin.</li>
    <li> A little large, but works! Again, love the bling! Husband loves the girlie look too! Thank you very much, lots of compliments</li>
    <li> Much nicer than a plastic clip. I have SUPER thick hair, and this holds a substantial amount very well, and is fairly low profile. I&#x27;ve replaced it a couple of times now, as I always like to have one around. I get compliments on it alot.</li>
    <li> The clip is really cute, but man, it is TINY! You can actually tell the size of this clip by looking at the rhinestones which are approximately 3mm in diameter. Despite the size, the clip is sturdy and fairly well made.</li>
    <li> Pretty little clip but is very small</li>
    <li> This clip is really pretty but much smaller than expected.  I will keep but wish that it had been a regular sized clip.</li>
    <li> I was a little disappointed this was smaller then expected, my own fault for not reading more closely. I don&#x27;t think it will hold a full bun for thick hair, possibly thin.</li>
    <li> For a extra added effect, this is a very nice claw clip.</li>
    <li> This is a pretty metal butterfly hair clip.  It&#x27;s dressier than the plain plastic clips, and the silver color and sparkly rhinestones make it seem like jewelry for your hair.  It&#x27;s much prettier than the plastic clips, and the sparkles make it much more fun to wear.  Because of the color and sparkles, the hinge is far less noticeable, too.  The product dimensions listed on Amazon are not correct.  It is about 1.5 inches long, and about 1 inch in depth and width.  I&#x27;d call it a medium to small clip - small for people with thick hair, and medium for finer locks.  The teeth don&#x27;t interlock all the way.  That doesn&#x27;t seem to affect it&#x27;s holding power, although I can&#x27;t say how it would perform on everyone&#x27;s hair.</li>
    <li> I have ordered this twice.  I love it!  It is very durable and I have had compliments on this.  The last one I purchased was missing a few of the decorative stones.</li>
    <li> This is much smaller than I thought it was going to be and it is very heavy so it tends to fall out of my hair.</li>
    <li> The clip is pretty but very small. I was not expecting it to be so tiny. I can only use it to clip a portion of my hair</li>
    <li> Lovely hair clip. Keeps unruly hair controlled.</li>
    <li> This clip is beautiful, easy to use, and stays in well.  It looks expensive and is a great accessory for an updo!</li>
    <li> This was a Christmas present and my daughter loves it.  It came quickly and exactly as ordered, I would order again.</li>
    <li> Received this as a birthday gift. It is of heavy metal construction which is great for my thick hair. The clip is very pretty and sturdy. May not be suitable for those with very fine or thin hair as it is a heavy clip.</li>
    <li> I would give it more stars , but just for me it was to heavy and slipped out of my hair enough to tell me to move on . I&#x27;ll probably give it to my granddaughter . However , the quality is great , and the bling is great also . No defects that I could tell . So it&#x27;s just my personal preference !! So anyone else , go for it !! Not a waste of money , a real bargain !!</li>
    <li> Very pretty and hold well, but a tad heavy.  Tends to slip after a couple of hours.</li>
    <li> Nice clip. Durable...wont break like other flimsy clips. However I was hoping for a larger clip. This is only for a small portion of hair, not for the whole head of hair...</li>
    <li> Had a large one before like this and was great for years but this one was like one 3 its  size and the spring broke one the 3 time I used it. Won&#x27;t be buying again</li>
    <li> I thought I was ordering a strong clip but it is so small I am not sure it will even fit over a pony tail rubber band.  It definitely will not hold any hair back.</li>
    <li> I should have read the reviews. I have very fine very straight hair.  Even though I have a lot of hair,  this heavy clip just fell right out.  It looks very pretty and would probably work for someone with thick curly hair.</li>
    <li> Pretty.  Exactly the size I wanted.</li>
    <li> Really cute, a little small for my head full of hair, but I knew that..</li>
    <li> I get so many compliments on this.  It sparkles with every light that hits it. I have shared the link with many friends.</li>
    <li> THE ITEM WAS NOT AS I EXPECTED IT TO BE. THE ITEM WAS VERY TINY. ITS 2 INCHES IN LENGTH AND 2 INCHES IN WIDTH.&lt;br /&gt;I RECOMMEND EVERYONE TO DOUBLE CHECK THE SIZE OF ALL ITEMS  BECAUSE THEY MAY LOOK THE PERFECT SIZE BUT THEY ARE NOT.</li>
    <li> This clip is a really nice bit of glittery hair jewelry that goes with everything from jeans to a cocktail dress.  It&#x27;s nice to have a pair of them.</li>
    <li> the clip is beautiful although a lot smaller than I thought it was going to be. It works alright that&#x27;s why I&#x27;m giving it four stars, it tends not to hold my hair tight unless I put it in a ponytail first.</li>
    <li> Great product and price!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a really pretty clip... but waaaay too small for me!! I regret not having read the reviews others posted. I will be uploading a picture with this review, of the clip next to a pen, so you can get a sense of how tiny it really is.&lt;br /&gt;If tiny is what you want, this is a very nice clip! But if you want something to actually help hold your hair, you should keep looking...</li>
    <li> This product is really small.  But pretty!  I wish there was some indication of size in the photos.</li>
    <li> I guess my measurement system is way off since I thought this claw clip would be larger than it turned out to be--It&#x27;s a pretty clip with the rhinestone but pretty tiny for most adult hair.</li>
    <li> This product is excellent, I´m very satisfied with this product that´s why I recomended to all of you, many thanks,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;with king regards,</li>
    <li> Overall, a nice appearance.  This size would be more appropriate to pull up part of your hair or for a young girl.  I cannot give them to my granddaughter because they are way to heavy.  I tried them out in my hair and it felt like rock was on my head.</li>
    <li> Great clip, looks good and great tension.  It hold hair very well and goes with many different styles. I would recommend</li>
    <li> I had bough this product before and lost so I had to buy AGAIN. Love this hair clip. Must have</li>
</ol>
