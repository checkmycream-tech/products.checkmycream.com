      <li>great product and better than pricier brands.</li>

      <li>I was so glad to find my favorite colors online, as this product is no longer available in the stores.  </li>
      <li>other than that it was a nice color and had a very nice scent to it.</li>
      <li>I love how this looks and feels when I first put it on.</li>
      <li>After about 45 minutes the glossy look is gone and I am left with just the color which still looks good.</li>
      <li>This is a unique product  -- a nice sheen and long-lasting stain that never feels dry.  </li>
      <li>I like this stain, fast shipping, and excited to keep using it.</li>
      <li>This product is nice and the color is pretty, but it does NOT last 10 hours.</li>

      <li>It didn&#x27;t last the full 10 hours</li>
      <li>but for such a blissful stain gloss, its worth reapplying.</li>
      <li>A really light weight gloss, not even a little sticky that lasts quite some time.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t last as long as the other kind I use.  </li>
      <li>Overall I really like this and use it frequently.</li>
      <li>I really don&#x27;t understand why they seem to be going away and pray that they are just going to re-package and bring them back.  </li>
      <li>This color is lovely and does stain the lips but only lasts maybe a few hours before another application is needed.</li>
      <li>A really pretty light/medium pink.  </li>
      <li>I would change it to have a little more pigment if possible so less layering is needed though (for faster application).  </li>
      <li>This particular color was too orange for me - I was expecting pink</li>

<li> This particular color was too orange for me - I was expecting pink</li>
<li> The colors are vibrant and not sticky like other long lasting glosses I have tried.</li>
<li> When you unscrew the top globs of lip gloss are completely covering the applicator, making it impossible to apply the gloss.</li>
<li> I haven&#x27;t timed how long it stays on but</li>
<li> not cake or flake or dry your lips.</li>
<li> I ues this as a lip liner -- I agree with Ms. Regina - that this make my lips dry --</li>
<li> Does not last long as expected the taste is a little off as well.  </li>
<li> It is vibrant but not bright.  </li>
<li> I like the Pink Plush color.  </li>
<li> Not pretty.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s better than usual, but I hate reapplying, so if you&#x27;re only looking to be covered half the day, this is what you&#x27;re looking for!</li>
<li> but it goes on flat and looks dull.</li>
<li> Typically, it&#x27;s gone within about three hours.</li>
<li> I had to throw it away because it was so messy.</li>
<li> but this is a major fail.</li>
<li> It does have an odd smell but not in a bad way.</li>
<li> I&#x27;m not a fan of reapplying all day, so I&#x27;m disappointed that it doesn&#x27;t last longer. :(</li>
<li> Flat boring color.</li>
<li> I&#x27;m quite disappointed.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Very goopy and messy. DId not like.</li>
    <li> I  fell for the 10 hr. claim. I applied it after dinner and watched tv &amp; read. No food, no drink, no kissing after 2 hrs. no stain. I would have been happy with 5 hrs. but this is a major fail.</li>
    <li> I love love love love love love love love love love these! Super pigmented, great staying power and ultra cheap.  What else could you ask for from a lip product.</li>
    <li> Such a shame these are getting discontinued!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Does not cake or flake or dry your lips. A really light weight gloss, not even a little sticky that lasts quite some time. Definnitely not 10 hours... but for such a blissful stain gloss, its worth reapplying. It tastes pleasant, too!!</li>
    <li> I ues this as a lip liner -- I agree with Ms. Regina - that this make my lips dry -- but when i used this as a lip liner and mix this with my favorite lipstick, not only it make a new color but to me it last longer --i order three more of this but as a lipliner -- try it and see if you like what i did&lt;br /&gt;Reena</li>
    <li> Flat boring color. It&#x27;s supposed to be gloss but it goes on flat and looks dull. This particular color was too orange for me - I was expecting pink but it has an orange color to it. Not pretty.</li>
    <li> I love all of Maybelline product  but this does not last for 10 hours, the most it last on for me was 2-3 hours. other than that it was a nice color and had a very nice scent to it.</li>
    <li> I was so glad to find my favorite colors online, as this product is no longer available in the stores.  This is a unique product  -- a nice sheen and long-lasting stain that never feels dry.  I really don&#x27;t understand why they seem to be going away and pray that they are just going to re-package and bring them back.  I have not found anything at any price, even in the high-end department stores, that compares.  I like the Pink Plush color.  It is fairly neutral and not too bright.</li>
    <li> This product is nice and the color is pretty, but it does NOT last 10 hours. I&#x27;d give it 2 hours tops. I&#x27;m not a fan of reapplying all day, so I&#x27;m disappointed that it doesn&#x27;t last longer. :(</li>
    <li> This lip gloss had no stopper at the top - a feature that is so necessary for any lip gloss! I had to throw it away because it was so messy.

    <li> This color is lovely and does stain the lips but only lasts maybe a few hours before another application is needed. Does not bleed at all but is a bit watery. For the money it is great and if you don&#x27;t mind a lot of reapplication it will work!</li>
    <li> I like this stain, fast shipping, and excited to keep using it. It does have an odd smell but not in a bad way. I think it&#x27;s just from the stain.</li>
    <li> The colors are vibrant and not sticky like other long lasting glosses I have tried. It didn&#x27;t last the full 10 hours but it&#x27;s still a good product. Lots of color choices.</li>
    <li> Love it - ordered several before they run out, for myself and sisters.</li>
    <li> I love how this looks and feels when I first put it on. After about 45 minutes the glossy look is gone and I am left with just the color which still looks good. After about 3 or 4 hours there is just a hint of color left. Doesn&#x27;t last 10 hours for me .</li>
    <li> Even prepping my lip (exfoliating) I can&#x27;t seem to get it to stay on longer than 4 hours. It&#x27;s better than usual, but I hate reapplying, so if you&#x27;re only looking to be covered half the day, this is what you&#x27;re looking for!</li>
    <li> It does not have a duration of 10 hours. I used and in 3 hours I was without gloss.</li>
    <li> I love the color of this lipstick.  It is vibrant but not bright.  It&lt;br /&gt;feel good on your lips.  I haven&#x27;t timed how long it stays on but&lt;br /&gt;I am very happy with this lipstick.</li>
    <li> Really great, long-lasting color. Can&#x27;t find this in stores anymore.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this lip stain for a couple weeks now, and it goes on smooth, has a pleasant odor/taste, and looks great.  It doesn&#x27;t last as long as the other kind I use.  Typically, it&#x27;s gone within about three hours.</li>
    <li> Does not last long as expected the taste is a little off as well.  Guess that is why they are no longer making them,  I use them over anohter produce that does stay on for a moist look</li>
    <li> A really pretty light/medium pink.  Lasts pretty well on lips if you layer it on.  I would change it to have a little more pigment if possible so less layering is needed though (for faster application).  Overall I really like this and use it frequently.</li>
    <li> great product and better than pricier brands. stays moist for hours, no waxy feel and easy application wand love it</li>
    <li> Never buying again. I bought 2-3 different shade but they looked the same.</li>
