      <li>This product does contain some shea butter, and it does moisturize my body fairly well, but I just don&#x27;t like the scent; it&#x27;s more old lady or medicinal than it is attractive.</li>

      <li>I was not as pleased as I could have been, the texture was not to my liking.</li>
      <li>I love this product.</li>
      <li>As for the fragrance, it has that shea butter scent , alittle strong but not awful.</li>
      <li>This does an excellent job at moisturizing even dry skin.</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;ve continued to use this lotion as an aftershave as it makes my face so soft and it feels great.</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t stand the strong scent, though.</li>
      <li>i like the light scent this has.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s like a pudding texture , smooth, creamy.</li>
      <li>this moisturizer is amazing and worked VERY well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>/&gt;I am a lace knitter &amp; use very fine yarns, so I need a cream that works fast (1st application) &amp; is Not greasy.</li>
      <li>and I feel so clean after I shower and put this on.</li>
      <li>/&gt;-It is super think and creamy</li>
      <li>I have three bathrooms to keep clean , a very large birdcage needing regular cleaning , plus I do my own nails.</li>
      <li>This product is good for skin that chaps easily during colder months and although a cream it&#x27;s not greasy or heavy.  </li>
      <li>The hot water habit stuck with me after retiring.</li>
      <li>The first thing is the smell.  </li>
      <li>first tried this when I ripped out a sample from a magazine; I was sold instantly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>and it seemed to last for many hours</li>
      <li>I did find it greasy at first</li>
      <li>Overall this is my favorite lotion and it has turned a man who never uses lotion to one that does.</li>
      <li>I used to clean banks &amp; professional buildings , always using hot water.</li>
      <li>- Two months later - I ended up using up the whole jar of cream - and buying more of it.</li>
      <li>Great thick, rich cream for dry skin, clean scent and reasonably priced.</li>
      <li>It glides nicely, coats the skin, but doesn&#x27;t really feel greasy, as it is absorbed after a few minutes.</li>
      <li>No cracks on the tips of my fingers or on my feet for the first time in decades - thanks to this cream.</li>
      <li>Not only does it moisturize well, it lasts all day and smells pretty darn fabulous.</li>
      <li>--I purchased a large bottle.  </li>
      <li>did not help a whole lot.</li>
      <li>I also use it on my hands and it works very well.</li>
      <li>Much to my surprise</li>
      <li>THANKS FOR READING</li>
      <li>It coats and you really do feel softer after application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>i would feel being coated and ready to go into a skillet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>Can&#x27;t really describe it...</li>
      <li>I purchased an OXO wide mouth soap dispenser from amazon for my face cleanser, i know one will work for my favorite hand cream.  </li>
      <li>This isn&#x27;t something that bugs me because it really does moisturize so well</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m giving it 4 stars because I really wish this came with a pump lid on this jar.</li>
      <li>I asked the pharmacist and she said to give it a try since the aloe isn&#x27;t helping a whole lot.</li>
      <li>It really doesn&#x27;t take much.</li>
      <li>I also didn&#x27;t notice that it made any real visible difference in my skin...kind of slimy and didn&#x27;t sink in well.  </li>
      <li>I tried so many creams &amp; lotions , balms , ointments with really no satisfaction or noticeable results.</li>
      <li>I find it really keeps hands and elbows</li>
      <li>~ I&#x27;ve got it all where I live.</li>
      <li>I couldn&#x27;t find it in  stores as it is new.  </li>
      <li>New product for me its so creamy not greasy</li>
      <li>/&gt;-It has a faint, pleasant fragrance.&lt;br</li>
      <li>So I have tried many products on my rough, cracked, dry hands.</li>
      <li>The scent is absolutely overpowering, and it&#x27;s bothersome enough to make me discontinue the use of this</li>
      <li>Makes your skin simply soft.  </li>
      <li>but I can see Jergen&#x27;s extra healing lotion doing the exact same job.</li>
      <li>It is a bit thick, but goes on well and is easy to blend into your skin.</li>

<li> /&gt;-It is affordable, Rite Aid has frequent \\&quot;buy one get one half off</li>
<li> but yum!&lt;br /&gt;Lasts a long time.  </li>
<li> I get rough patches on my upper arms and cheeks.  </li>
<li> Too long.  </li>
<li> Amazon even sent me an alert to contact the seller because the product had been taking a long time to process and ship.  </li>
<li> Then doing same on the other hand .</li>
<li> dry skin cleared up in two days using this cream</li>
<li> But I can not use it when my skin is dry because it leaves my skin greasy and because of the thickness it takes a while to work in.</li>
<li> I have had incredibly dry skin since my pregnancy.  </li>

<li> I am taking some medication that is causing my skin to stay very dry.  </li>
<li> my skin is very dry, so I need to use creams not lotions.</li>
<li> A few days later my face was EXTREMELY dry since the dead skin was starting to peel and it was winter</li>
<li> /&gt;It is of a thick consistency, yet not heavy on your skin.</li>
<li> , a little goes a long way.&lt;br</li>
<li> little goes a long way.  </li>
<li> also like all other Jergen lotion too.  </li>
<li> and I think that is due to the thickness.  </li>
<li> I used the small bottle and before it ran out I wanted to replace with a larger jar.  </li>
<li> Even if I&#x27;ve been doing something that&#x27;s hard on my hands, I can use this cream &amp; start knitting with the finest silk yarn in two minutes with no worry about rough hands snagging &amp; ruining  the delicate fiber..</li>

    <li> i like the light scent this has. The cream is too thick for me though. I can only use it when I get out of the shower. It absorbs well and moisturizes well. But I can not use it when my skin is dry because it leaves my skin greasy and because of the thickness it takes a while to work in. I wouldn&#x27;t get this again.</li>
    <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Smells amazing.  Not too powerful but great mix of the Jergens smell and oatmeal.  Can&#x27;t really describe it...but yum!&lt;br /&gt;Lasts a long time.  I coat my hands and arms in this and it seemed to last for many hours after.&lt;br /&gt;A little goes a long way.  You don&#x27;t have to use a ton to get the job done.&lt;br /&gt;Very moisturizing.  It coats and you really do feel softer after application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Con:&lt;br /&gt;It is a little thick.  This isn&#x27;t something that bugs me because it really does moisturize so well and I think that is due to the thickness.  But it can take a minute to get it all rubbed in.  (that is what she said)</li>
    <li> I use jergens conditioning crema once  or twice a day. I have three bathrooms to keep clean , a very large birdcage needing regular cleaning , plus I do my own nails. My hands are always in water . I used to clean banks &amp; professional buildings , always using hot water. The hot water habit stuck with me after retiring. I tried so many creams &amp; lotions , balms , ointments with really no satisfaction or noticeable results. I received a sample of this jergens in the mail about two years ago and I cannot be without it. I use it so much because my hands are constantly in hot water ( a bad habit I really need to stop). On days  I&#x27;m not cleaning or my hands aren&#x27;t submerged in water all day ,I don&#x27;t have to rub any on. I find it really keeps hands and elbows moisturized.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is of a thick consistency, yet not heavy on your skin. It&#x27;s like a pudding texture , smooth, creamy. As for the fragrance, it has that shea butter scent , alittle strong but not awful. I did find it greasy at first because I used so much at once, my hands were bad. Now I use a dime size on the back of each hand , rubbing it into the back of my hand , at the same time putting that same dime size on the palm of the hand I&#x27;m rubbing it in. Then doing same on the other hand . It really doesn&#x27;t take much. I&#x27;m giving it 4 stars because I really wish this came with a pump lid on this jar. I purchased an OXO wide mouth soap dispenser from amazon for my face cleanser, i know one will work for my favorite hand cream.  👐THANKS FOR READING, BYE👐</li>
    <li> very thick cream, and its not greasy when rubbed in. my skin is very dry, so I need to use creams not lotions. and this is a great cream :)</li>
    <li> I swear by this Jergens product.  Somewhere I received a sample in a very small jar.  I found the smell to be quite nice--akin to vanilla musk and oatmeal.  I used the small bottle and before it ran out I wanted to replace with a larger jar.  This product is good for skin that chaps easily during colder months and although a cream it&#x27;s not greasy or heavy.  Moisturizes perfectly.  I could not find the product in retail stores but Amazon sold it--I purchased a large bottle.  The downside was it took a very long time not to just receive but to ship!  Amazon even sent me an alert to contact the seller because the product had been taking a long time to process and ship.  I received the cream some 2 almost 3 weeks later.  Too long.  I will use a different &amp;#34;seller&amp;#34; but will continue to buy the product.  You&#x27;ll love!</li>
    <li> I recently went snowboarding on the rocky mountains and idiot east-coaster me did not think I needed sunblock. Well I definitely did as I got scorched! A few days later my face was EXTREMELY dry since the dead skin was starting to peel and it was winter so the humidity was very low. I stopped in Duane Reade looking for something to moisturize since the Aloe I had been using did not help a whole lot. I found had been reading about how good oatmeal is for your skin and came across this Jergens Creama Oatmeal. I asked the pharmacist and she said to give it a try since the aloe isn&#x27;t helping a whole lot. Much to my surprise this moisturizer is amazing and worked VERY well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My dry skin cleared up in two days using this cream and I&#x27;ve continued to use this lotion as an aftershave as it makes my face so soft and it feels great. I also use it on my hands and it works very well. Overall this is my favorite lotion and it has turned a man who never uses lotion to one that does.</li>
    <li> This is the best cream for dryness!!!! Can&#x27;t find it at any stores out here yet! about the same cost.</li>
    <li> I am taking some medication that is causing my skin to stay very dry.  This cream goes on and soaks into my skin and gives it the moisture that it is craving.  It dries not sticky and will continue to use it in my daily routine. It has also done wonders on my cracked feet.</li>
    <li> This cream is thick.  I use it on my hands and feet before going to bed.  I can&#x27;t imagine rubbing it all over my body.... i would feel being coated and ready to go into a skillet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also like all other Jergen lotion too.  That&#x27;s why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5.  This cost more but I can see Jergen&#x27;s extra healing lotion doing the exact same job.</li>
    <li> This is a great cream.  It has oatmeal in it just like it says, but it is also rich with shea butter which gives it a very pleasant smell.</li>
    <li> The three worst things for your skin ~ low humidity, high altitude, &amp;  wind ~ I&#x27;ve got it all where I live. So I have tried many products on my rough, cracked, dry hands. Now that I&#x27;ve found this I don&#x27;t have to look any more. It is THE BEST.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a lace knitter &amp; use very fine yarns, so I need a cream that works fast (1st application) &amp; is Not greasy. This Jergens product is perfect. Even if I&#x27;ve been doing something that&#x27;s hard on my hands, I can use this cream &amp; start knitting with the finest silk yarn in two minutes with no worry about rough hands snagging &amp; ruining  the delicate fiber..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I LOVE IT!!</li>
    <li> I love Jergens. While I like the original scent in this cream, this scent is very nice as well. I use this as my daily moisturizer on my skin, from head to toe. Love it!!</li>
    <li> I thought I was ordering Jergens Crema Shea Butter cream, which I had seem well-reviewed in a fashion magazine. This product does contain some shea butter, and it does moisturize my body fairly well, but I just don&#x27;t like the scent; it&#x27;s more old lady or medicinal than it is attractive. I&#x27;ll use it, but I won&#x27;t re-order.</li>
    <li> I tried this cream after reading great reviews in many magazines about it. I was excited...until I tried to use it.  The first thing is the smell.  Oh.  It&#x27;s awful!  Completely fake and doesn&#x27;t fade so you&#x27;re stuck with the terrible, cloying tropical fragrance.  I also didn&#x27;t notice that it made any real visible difference in my skin...kind of slimy and didn&#x27;t sink in well.  Maybe if it didn&#x27;t smell so bad I would continue to use it, but I completely wasted my money here.</li>
    <li> I like the way this product works on my skin. It glides nicely, coats the skin, but doesn&#x27;t really feel greasy, as it is absorbed after a few minutes. I can&#x27;t stand the strong scent, though. I was expecting a scent similar to its companion Jergens Shea Butter lotion, but it&#x27;s completely different. The scent is absolutely overpowering, and it&#x27;s bothersome enough to make me discontinue the use of this cream.&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE - Two months later - I ended up using up the whole jar of cream - and buying more of it. After applying it and letting a few minutes pass, the stronger part of the scent dissipates. The cream itself has been marvelous for my skin this winter. No cracks on the tips of my fingers or on my feet for the first time in decades - thanks to this cream. I will actually continue buying, and upgraded the rating to 5 stars.</li>
    <li> This does an excellent job at moisturizing even dry skin. It is a bit thick, but goes on well and is easy to blend into your skin. It has a slight scent, nothing unpleasant.</li>
    <li> This is the greatest cream.  Makes your skin simply soft.  I couldn&#x27;t find it in  stores as it is new.  Amazon comes thru again.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s o.k.  Not what I was hoping for.  Nice fragrance.  I&#x27;ll use all of it, but I probably won&#x27;t re-order.  Not a good value for the price.</li>
    <li> The perfect lotion for after swimming and after a shower. My favorite and a great price.</li>
    <li> Great thick, rich cream for dry skin, clean scent and reasonably priced.</li>
    <li> I bought this cream to try out.  I was not as pleased as I could have been, the texture was not to my liking.</li>
    <li> I love this product. Not only does it moisturize well, it lasts all day and smells pretty darn fabulous.Give it a try - you won&#x27;t be sorry.</li>
    <li> New product for me its so creamy not greasy and it feels so nice and make my skin feel silky...Luv it.</li>
    <li> So happy I found this stuff... It isn&#x27;t sticky at all and I feel so clean after I shower and put this on. Also smells very good and makes me feel so soft and my skin stays hydrated.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t hesitate too buy my skin feels amazing  I&#x27;ve only used this cream on my hands BUT I can tell its gonna leave my whole body feeling great!!!!</li>
    <li> I have had incredibly dry skin since my pregnancy.  I get rough patches on my upper arms and cheeks.  I have since been searching for a moisturizer that seals in moisture and that lasts all day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I first tried this when I ripped out a sample from a magazine; I was sold instantly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-It has a faint, pleasant fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;-It is super think and creamy, a little goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;-It is affordable, Rite Aid has frequent \\&quot;buy one get one half off sales\\&quot; - couple that with a coupon or two and stock up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this on my face and neck twice a day and I have not had any problems with break outs or excessive oiliness.</li>
