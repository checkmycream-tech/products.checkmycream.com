      <li>I love opi  items.  </li>

      <li>I loved the scents of this lotion, but it just wasn&#x27;t moisturizing enough for me.  </li>
      <li>Nice smell to them and super soft.</li>
      <li>It is subtle and wonderful</li>
      <li>so I was lucky to get this from&lt;br /&gt;Amazon.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Very lite and soft lotion.   Scents are very lite also.   Would recommend.  Adorable in the little six pack case.</li>
    <li> Was VERY pleased with this order as you cannot purchase these in my city anymore.  My wife was SOO happy to receive them in her stocking at Christmas.  She loves carrying the small bottle in her purse.  Great price and fast shipping!  Individual bottles had fallen out of the box during shipping, but no damage...was able to put the package back together to be wrapped!</li>
    <li> I had been given a couple small bottles of Avojuice years ago by a friend. I loved them and hardly used them because I wanted them to last. I&#x27;m glad to have found this 6-pack because it&#x27;s a great way to sample several fragrances without a big commitment. Now I know which ones I would like to have MORE of and can get them in the larger bottles.    This lotion is one of the very BEST I have tried. It keeps my hands super soft and smooth, absorbs quickly and smells delicious (not too overpowering though). Keep one at your desk, bedside, car, purse ... they are the perfect size to carry around.    Excellent product!</li>
    <li> Great TA gift or emergency gift or stocking stuffer.  Good way to check out the different scents before splurging on a scent I might not like.</li>
    <li> Perfect size to allow you to try each scent.  Everyone in my family who received a set for Christmas loved it &amp; said they loved the way it was so lite and made their hands feel smooth as silk.  Great product.</li>
    <li> Very silky.  Absorbs quickly.</li>
    <li> Very small bottles, hence mini. Nice smell to them and super soft. I had purchased as stocker stuffers. They were great!</li>
    <li> Great scents, perfectly light and non greasy. This is also a perfect gift item for practically any lady in your life.</li>
    <li> I love this pack because I always keep one small bottle in my handbag without adding too much weight or volume to it.  Besides its great practicality, the smell of each pack is so unique and delicious you&#x27;d feel you wanna eat it.  You can also refill it when it is empty with the bigger pack if you have it.</li>
    <li> These are perfect for keeping your hands and nails hydrated, since they&#x27;re non-greasy. They&#x27;re good only if you don&#x27;t have very dry hands, which is why I gave them 4 out of 5. I will buy more Avojuices in the future, but not a great many because they&#x27;re kinda expensive. :/</li>
    <li> Love the moisturizers! They smell super nice (stronger scented than what I expected) and feel really nice on your hands! Very happy customer.</li>
    <li> I love it. Nice to have for carrying in your purse. Also, it lets you try the other scents before you would order the bigger bottle.</li>
    <li> This did not come in the 6 pack carry as shown in the picture. It came in a mangled, square plastic box with the OPI name printed in the corner. The scents are nice, but do not last long. The first time I tried the lotion on my hands, I added small amounts at a time, and it still felt greasy. Once it absorbed however, it did make my hands silky soft, but not for long. I will not be ordering again. Too bad, because the little six pack pictured would make cute stocking stuffers for Christmas.</li>
    <li> There&#x27;s only one place that carries this lotion and don&#x27;t get to that part of town often so was great to find it online!</li>
    <li> I intended to use these for small teacher baskets (socks, lotion, hot cocoa, mug)...I ended up buying too many and one by one added them to my purse, my camera bag, my car...I love these, the smells are wonderful and they are not at all &#x27;sticky&#x27;...great buy!</li>
    <li> This lotion is awesome--very light but softens my hands and makes them feel very silky, not at all greasy like so many other lotions.  My favorite scent is Sweet Tea, but they all smell great.  I bought the mini 6-pack so that I could try them out and I will definitely be buying a large bottle of the Sweet Tea scent.  It&#x27;s a little pricey, but in my opinion it&#x27;s worth it.  I have very dry skin (especially my hands), and with winter coming up, I think this is going to be my go-to lotion.</li>
    <li> This is so soft and silky.I love it.I would definitely recommend it.I plan on buying more. Noy greasy at all..</li>
    <li> My hands have become increasingly dry over the past few years: getting older, typing more, desk sits right under the air vent; I could go on for days. But I would rather have dry, cracking skin than use most lotions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried Eucerine, Dove, Aveeno, Burts Bees (and probably more) but I usually wound up washing my hands after using because of the TERRIBLE feel they left on my hands. Some greasy, some dry, some just plain heavy on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found AVOJUICE at my salon and it smelled good so I picked up a mini for 2 bucks. It was the first time I&#x27;d actually emptied a bottle of lotion.&lt;br /&gt;The light scents last just long enough so that you smell them without being overwhelmed. The lotion itself sinks immediately into your skin leaving it silky smooth and COMPLETELY dry. No grease, no heavy lotion sticking to everything, just soft hands. Since I work on a computer, it helps to not have your fingers sticking to the keys all day. This lotion is amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you aren&#x27;t sure if you&#x27;ll like it, at least spend a couple of bucks and get a couple of the mini bottles. You will not be disappointed.</li>
    <li> The lotion was cheap, but the bottles fit into the palm of my hand, they were small. That makes it easy to put into my bag, and I prefer it that way, but I wanted to notify all consumers of this product. The scents were very appealing, except for two that I thought were pretty gross. Generally, I like this product and would recommend it to people who are looking for a light but helpful moisturizer.</li>
    <li> Good way to try different scents.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff.  I get dry and cracked fingers, this is the best lotion I have ever used.</li>
    <li> I like this product because I have extremely dry hands.&lt;br /&gt;They crack and bleed because I wash them at least 50 times a day (I&#x27;m not kidding).&lt;br /&gt;This lotion provides instant relief and really does make my hands feel soft and soothed.&lt;br /&gt;Applying to legs after shaving...legs feel incredibly soft and smooth!&lt;br /&gt;Every flavor is amazing! I have these little bottles stashed everywhere....purse, bedside, bathroom, kitchen, vehicle&lt;br /&gt;and even the cocktail table by the sofa!</li>
    <li> Love these products.  Thank you for quick processing and good condition.</li>
    <li> Perfect for travel or to fit in your purse. Love all the fabulous scents! They make your skin feel nice also. If you have severely dry skin, this product probably is to thin. I like that it absorbed quickly and does not leave your skin feeling greasy.</li>
    <li> These are amazing moisturizers. They&#x27;re very soothing to the skin. They feel like a juice, only much thicker. Like they don&#x27;t feel too liquid-like or runny! They all have amazing, delicious-smelling scents. I love that it comes in a pack of 6.</li>
    <li> I ordered as a gift but kept for my self, I like having these everywhere, purse, nightstand etc. great scents give you a little fragrant pick me up</li>
    <li> I love avojuice.  I have very dry skin, and I struggle with finding the right product to combat that.  I bought this so I could sample the different scents, so I knew which larger bottle I wanted to buy.  I did give a couple away as gifts, and the recipients were thrilled!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve ordered the Mini 6 pack for some of my family and friends for Christmas. All the \\&quot;OPI Avojuice Skin Quenchers\\&quot; are terrific.  They have a nice fragrence, have a smooth feel, and are well absorbed with no tacky or greasy feeling.  But, my very favorite (\\&quot;LOVE\\&quot;) is Sugar Cookies, which I have not been able to find.  It&#x27;s the most wonderful of all.  I ordered about ten of the Minies in this fragrence several years ago for Christmas....now, being the selfish person I am, I wish I had kept them for myself.  LOL  Evidently they no longer make the Avojuice in this fragrence.  By all means, give them a try!</li>
    <li> This pack is just awesome, the smells are lovely, The size is perfect to put in you purse, And it leaves the hands really soft without sticking</li>
    <li> Love this lotion. I have shared some of these with friends.  I will most likely order more at some point.</li>
    <li> I ordered this for my wife. She is trying to find out which scent she likes best. She likes them all. I think this is the only lotion that doesn&#x27;t dull fingernail polish. It also makes her hands softer and smoother than standard hand lotions sold in stores. I wish local retail store would start selling this lotion, but they don&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> Avojuice is great and their cents are nice.  The little bottles are great for transporting, and a little lotion goes a long way.</li>
    <li> One of my friends favorite gifts.</li>
    <li> This is a very nice lotion which absorbs quickly and doesn&#x27;t feel sticky afterwards.  I ordered this mini pack so I could decide which scent I wanted in a larger bottle which I&#x27;ve already ordered so I have lots on hand.</li>
    <li> I love opi  items.  Scent  really smells  like the flavors that it was made from .  I wish that they had larger bottles.</li>
    <li> I loved the scents of this lotion, but it just wasn&#x27;t moisturizing enough for me.  I liked that it wasn&#x27;t greasy, but after an hour, my hands felt dry again.</li>
    <li> Love the soft and smooth feel after using</li>
    <li> this opi lotion is so great it makes your body so soft its a great size to put in your purse it makes your hands so soft.</li>
    <li> Not the scents I expected. It was as if the lotion was old. And had lost its scent with time.</li>
    <li> very nice lotion, love it</li>
    <li> I would encourage anyone who hasn&#x27;t tried this product to give it a try.  It is truly the best hand cream I have ever pruchased.  Never greasy and a small amount goes a long way.</li>
    <li> ooo good! I love this sweets</li>
    <li> I have used many many lotions in the past and the fragrance of these is incredible.  Long lasting with a non gresy feel.  Absorbs quickly and leaves the skin soft and silky.</li>
    <li> Wanted to try all the flavors. This was perfect. Good size for purses. Great gift too. The best lotion ever.</li>
    <li> Awesome, love the smells great for travel...</li>
    <li> This product is incredible.  I get very dry hands and lotion them on a regular basis, but I cant stand how they feel after.  Even after the lotion is &amp;#34;absorbed&amp;#34; they still feel...icky.  I&#x27;ve encountered products that I like, but none that I absolutely love until now!  Even the products that I have liked in the past still leave my hands feeling sort of heavy, or oily and I don&#x27;t want to touch my face, hair, cat, or my IPhone. A friend of mine gave me a mini bottle of OPI Avojuice and my life was changed!  A small dab will completely cover your hands plus some and once it absorbs, you wouldn&#x27;t even know it was ever there if it weren&#x27;t for your skin being so darn soft! To be honest, I wasn&#x27;t even fond of the scent that I was given...it wasn&#x27;t bad, just not very good (in MY opinion), but the product feels so great that I don&#x27;t even care! The one mini bottle I had lasted about 4 months and was applied to my hands 3-4 times a day...pretty darn good, I&#x27;d say!!  I am buying this 6 pack to get a feel for multiple smells so that eventually I can buy a larger bottle in my favorite!

    <li> Love OPI Avojuice, Always have always will!  So glad to find in on line.  Sad that I was only able to find it in the past at licensed hair salon supply stores.  Thanks~ !</li>
    <li> but I am now a firm believer. I have been a loyal customer of VS and B&amp;BW lotions for 20 years. One thing I got tired of was the fact that they kept discontinuing favorites that I knew were best sellers. For a few of the scents, there have even been online petitions that were signed by the thousands-to no avail. Another thing is the prices. They both have these sales that make you think you are getting your money&#x27;s worth. But in the last few years, both of their lotions not only get an extreme dust-like smell after a short time of wear, but they do not moisturize well at all any longer. I was having to add quite a bit of coconut oil to get anything from them as far as that goes. Which didn&#x27;t help the fact that they already had issues with actually soaking into the skin. Enter OPI&#x27;s Avojuices. I had seen them before, but kinda figured that they would just be more promises unkempt. I am 40 years old, and many say I look much younger than I am. Most place me in my mid-twenties. I have pretty good skin, but it needs moisture just as much as the next chica. A friend told me that she had started using it, and that she was impressed. She is as picky as I, so I came to Amazon to check it out and read the reviews. With so many high rankings, I at the very least wanted to try the sample size bottles. Upon receiving them (which was VERY FAST), I was out-of-my-skull excited to literally feel the lotion sink into my skin. No laying on top, no over-rubbing trying to get some of the moisture to work into me. It took ONE drop that was at the most the size of two peas to cover my entire arm. No sticky residue left over. I work on computers all day, and am an avid smartphone user. Anyone who uses a keyboard or swipes a screen will fall head over heels with this lotion, as your fingers won&#x27;t stick or leave a milky print. This lotion literally makes my hands and skin feel like silk. Also, my 12 year old daughter is excited that I found her a moisturizer that her sensitive skin can use. She has atopic dermatitis, and this doesn&#x27;t flare it up and sinks in, helping with her itchiness. We are both digging the pleasant scents, as well. All in all, we are very happy-and will be placing orders for the large bottles :)She has atopic dermatitis, and this doesn&#x27;t flare it up and sinks in, helping with her itchiness.

    <li> This skin lotion is very nice.  I understand you can&#x27;t purchase this product at just any store so I was lucky to get this from&lt;br /&gt;Amazon.  I would have preferred this company to have used more natural ingredients but the lotion feels and smells&lt;br /&gt;good, so you can&#x27;t have everything.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t say enough how much I love this lotion. It works and smells fantastic and doesn&#x27;t leave my hands greasy at all. I have never had a lotion leave my hands so soft before. The bottles are all over the apartment and I always make sure there is one in my purse before I leave.</li>
    <li> These were for my girlfriend and she loves them.</li>
    <li> Lotion fine but the scent is perfect clean light size very portable  This would be perfect party gift or a one at a time.. thank you</li>
    <li> This pack had only amazing smelling lotions in it.  the only drawback was the package was not what is shown here- it was a promo package like they&#x27;d have in a salon, with artwork advertising the sale price (not stickers either, the actual box).  Since I bought it for a gift for our babysitter, i thought that was pretty awful to give as a gift.</li>
    <li> It is a nice pack to be able to sample the scents and then order the larger size of the favorites.</li>
    <li> I have used this lotion for several years and I love it!&lt;br /&gt;I picked this item specifically because it had two ot the fragrances I was looking for.&lt;br /&gt;However, the fragrances I received are not the ones that were listed in the description.</li>
    <li> Wait a few minutes for the product to absorb and your hands feel like velvet!</li>
    <li> I had tried the mango flavor one time, loved it, and was curious about the other choices.  Well now I&#x27;m hooked.  All of them are simply delicious and make my skin feel like butta.  The other bonus is that even though the scent goes on strong, it doesn&#x27;t stay that way and make you sick of yourself after a while. It is subtle and wonderful which is absolutely perfect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These bottles don&#x27;t go very far, but they&#x27;re not intended to. They&#x27;re merely an introduction to a fabulous product for your skin. Now I&#x27;m gonna go out and buy the big girl bottle!</li>
    <li> its not heavy or greasy mositure just the right amount.the smells are just amazing my fav is the sweet tea</li>
