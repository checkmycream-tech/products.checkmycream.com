      <li>When I got this hair pin in the mail, I was very excited!</li>

      <li>I wanted something cute that reminded me of the beach, I did NOT want part of the beach.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s okay.</li>
      <li>Whenever my husband leaned over to kiss me, I&#x27;m SURE he smelled this thing since it was clipped to the side of my head.</li>
      <li>We had to soak it in ammonia to get the smell to go away, which broke off some of the knobs on top.</li>
      <li>However, I am amazed at how many people do not read product descriptions.  </li>
      <li>The clip is cute but you can smell the fish through all of the packaging.</li>
      <li>the starfish look better with more than one...</li>

      <li>I guess it&#x27;s ok</li>
      <li>These smell like they came right from the sea, but they are gorgeous.</li>
      <li>Super cute accessory!</li>
      <li>Way cool!</li>
      <li>with that being said, let&#x27;s hope the barrettes don&#x27;t fall off the starfish as easily as one reviewer said.</li>
      <li>Beautiful in my red hair feels like a mermaid</li>
      <li>However I bought the clip from another company and its super cute.</li>
      <li>Super cute, but there is no way this thing is going in my hair.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s super cute mermaid look too.</li>
      <li>Super cute hair clip.</li>
      <li>This product was a huge dissapointment.</li>
      <li>Fun :-)</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very unique and pretty!</li>
      <li>Looks really cheaply made.</li>
      <li>But if you can cover the clip part with your hair just right, it&#x27;s actually really cute.</li>
      <li>and I love it so much!</li>
      <li>I was really excited when this came in the mail.</li>
      <li>pretty and cool and mermaidy i love and wear it quite a bit</li>
      <li>Super cheap  </li>
      <li>Nothing special.</li>
      <li>so thats cool</li>
      <li>I love it so much</li>
      <li>But besides the smell it is cute plus the shipping was super fast.</li>
      <li>I love the fact that they are natural sea stars and unique.  </li>
      <li>Very pretty and NO smell.</li>
      <li>I overlooked the sadness that is poaching, because I have a new and absolutely adorable hair clip.</li>
      <li>Well first off it wasn&#x27;t &amp;#34;flakey&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;huge&amp;#34; it was appropriate sized, and looked really nice!(about the size that the picture showed compared to that girl)</li>
      <li>I finally just let it air out for a week or two and it smells fine now, and looks super cute.</li>
      <li>Product exactly as described!</li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t buy this in the first place!</li>
      <li>They seem pretty durable too!</li>
      <li>Once it is fully aired out, I will use it more often.</li>
      <li>I have it set out so it can air out in fresh air.</li>
      <li>They do not smell at all now and are well worth the purchase</li>
      <li>I think the would&#x27;ve been awesome if they weren&#x27;t broken</li>
      <li>not even the fresh air could fix this problem.</li>
      <li>But the price was right.</li>
      <li>Great size, not too small.</li>
      <li>The only thing is I have very fine hair</li>
      <li>I really didn&#x27;t like having to make a stop for super glue on my wedding day.</li>
      <li>Very fast shipping.</li>
      <li>This was a real starfish!</li>
      <li>&lt;br /&gt;PS; the provided picture is misleading, its only one clip per, not two, though I do think two looks better.</li>
      <li>IF YOU PUT IT OUTSIDE FOR AROUND A WEEK, SPRAY IT WITH YOUR FAVORITE PERFUME, IT WILL GO AWAY!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s really cute but the only problem is it does stink a lot.</li>
      <li>All different sizes love it</li>
      <li>Smaller than expected but holding up quite nicely:)</li>
      <li>Thanks !</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I should have paid more attention to the reviews that warned against the HORRIBLE SMELL!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Literally here&#x27;s what I did to try to fix the awful stench:&lt;br /&gt;- Covered in gold lacquer (the kind used on band instruments, because that&#x27;s what I had handy)&lt;br /&gt;- Second coat of lacquer&lt;br /&gt;- Third coat of lacquer&lt;br /&gt;- Literally poured clear nail polish in the crevices in the back&lt;br /&gt;- Painted the entire back with top coat nail polish&lt;br /&gt;- Left in a paper bag with two orange peels for 2 days in the Arizona sun&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;... and it still stinks.</li>
    <li> I had not read the other reviews before I had purchased and the starfish did smell pretty bad when I got them. I googled how to fix it and soaked them in alcohol for the required time then let them dry in sea salt. They do not smell at all now and are well worth the purchase just be prepared to preserve them before wear. http://m.wikihow.com/Preserve-a-Starfish-for-a-Decoration</li>
    <li> Great Clip .. came after I wanted it.</li>
    <li> If I could I would give this 0 stars.  I will give them one because it came before expected.  It was broken before they even shipped it.  I know this because the broken piece wasn&#x27;t even in the package.  This product was worthless to me.  Don&#x27;t waste your money, get one from Michaels and glue a hair clip to it. Too much trouble to send back. Needless to say, I&#x27;m highly disappointed!</li>
    <li> Good for a Halloween costume. Must use little hair for it to stay in clip.</li>
    <li> I got mine way earlier than expected and was super excited! It doesn&#x27;t smell bad at all and I love it so much! Hello people your buying a real dead starfish you really need to put more thought into your purchases. I recommend this 100% ! :) :D</li>
    <li> Yeah, yeah it stinks!  BUT!  I PROMISE YOU IF YOU PUT IT OUTSIDE FOR AROUND A WEEK, SPRAY IT WITH YOUR FAVORITE PERFUME, IT WILL GO AWAY!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What is aggravating is the LITTLE clip!  My hair is around as long as the girl in the pic and it&#x27;s silky straight and average type bulk.  Hope I&#x27;m making sense.  It&#x27;s just not gonna hold unless you stick something else in your hair and clip it to that something else.&lt;br /&gt;Or I&#x27;m thinking about taking that clip off (it&#x27;s glued to the starfish) and adding another one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How could they have such a beautiful piece of hair design with a small clip like that beats me. Had to be a man that made it, don&#x27;t you think so.</li>
    <li> As soon as I opened the bag I almost vomited by the smell of these. They looked nice but smelt like they and just got picked for the beach after sitting and rotting for a week. I couldn&#x27;t handle the smell so I tossed the em in the bed of my truck. A week latter I had forgot about them and put my dog in the back of my truck to find that they had such a terrible smell my dog had ripped the bag open and ate 3 of them like dogs do when they smell rotting carcuses... It was horrible!</li>
    <li> I hate the smell, and it was broken when I received it</li>
    <li> Is cute, but I have two problems, one this is HUGE!!!! I mean how can I put in my hair ? Is Pretty bigger, and smell so bad, like dead fish, well is real dead fish.</li>
    <li> My granddaughter loves this. mermaid hairclip :)</li>
    <li> Ugh...I should have read the reviews closer. THE STENCH.....my god! It&#x27;s over powering. I&#x27;m just going to throw it away.</li>
    <li> Really liked these cute starfish clips. They seem pretty durable too! I can&#x27;t wait to wear these this summer! It&#x27;s super cute mermaid look too. For the price you just can&#x27;t beat them!!</li>
    <li> Super cute hair clip. Great price, but it smells awful. Smells like nasty rotting beach. I have it set out so it can air out in fresh air. Once it is fully aired out, I will use it more often. Great to go with any beachy outfit!</li>
    <li> horrible!  we only received 1 and they smell!!!!!!!  they literally glued a starfish to a clip</li>
    <li> I guess you get what you pay for....&lt;br /&gt;Gonna throw it in bleach and see if it helps.</li>
    <li> These smell like they came right from the sea, but they are gorgeous.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s okay. Nothing special. I thought it was 2 but its just one. It&#x27;s about the size of a silver dollar.</li>
    <li> Very cute but smells horrible. I would have thought it would be cleaned before made. Smells like it was just pulled out of the ocean and glued on a clip</li>
    <li> Very pretty and NO smell. I was worried when I read the reviews, but I took the risk anyway and I&#x27;m thrilled I did! :-) I love this. It&#x27;s very unique and pretty! Great quality! Amazing price! Shipping was like 3 weeks ahead of the estimated delivery date. And no smell!</li>
    <li> Way cool! Thought it was a set cause of the pic but im ok with one. Fun :-)</li>
    <li> These still smelled like fish...</li>
    <li> Disgusting it smelled as if the creature died inside!!!!! DO NOT ORDER THIS ITEM!!!!</li>
    <li> I bought this because I thought it would be so cute in the summer but no.  Despite what the other reviews said this is most definitely not &amp;#34;so cute.&amp;#34;  First of all, it&#x27;s huge.  Second there is no shine whatsoever to it.  It&#x27;s not attractive.  Not only does it look like a real dried up starfish with some sand dumped on it, but I&#x27;m fairly certain it&#x27;s an actual dried up starfish glued to a barrette.  I&#x27;m not kidding when I say this either, it smelled like the ocean.  I wanted something cute that reminded me of the beach, I did NOT want part of the beach.  Something about wearing a dead starfish in my hair is just not appealing.</li>
    <li> The product smell so bad</li>
    <li> Smells repulsive because this at one was a live star fish so now it smells rotten no matter how much perfume you wear</li>
    <li> Love the look of the clip! But the smell it not a &amp;#34;little&amp;#34; as the discribe! It smell very nasty. I am hoping it will eventually go away! I can&#x27;t wear it with the current smell!!</li>
    <li> I read all the reviews &amp; was prepared for the nasty smell. Boy was it terrible. They&#x27;re really cute though, but one of them came broken. &amp; the piece wasn&#x27;t even in the bag, so i know it was broken before it was shipped. I&#x27;ll keep the other one, hopefully spraying it &amp; airing it out will help with the smell. The one that&#x27;s broken I&#x27;ll have to throw away.</li>
    <li> the small one was missing a chunk. Not worth the hassle of returning.</li>
    <li> When I got this hair pin in the mail, I was very excited! I unwrapped it from the plastic and lo and behold; a dead starfish! I overlooked the sadness that is poaching, because I have a new and absolutely adorable hair clip. BUT. If you are not familiar with the scent of death, maybe you should look for an acrylic option. This starfish clip smelled so overwhelmingly of decay, that I held off on wearing it, until I was able to soak it in bleach. I hope this helps you in your decision making! xx&lt;br /&gt;PS; the provided picture is misleading, its only one clip per, not two, though I do think two looks better.</li>
    <li> Thought it came with 2 and was flimsy</li>
    <li> The clip shows under the star. Looks really cheaply made. Which it is, so that&#x27;s understandable. But if you can cover the clip part with your hair just right, it&#x27;s actually really cute.</li>
    <li> Broken when I got them, which was so long after I ordered them that I actually forgot I ordered them!  Which is a shame cause I think the would&#x27;ve been awesome if they weren&#x27;t broken</li>
    <li> Cute but SMELLS LIKE FISH!!! I waited for the smell to go away but it just doesn&#x27;t do it.</li>
    <li> Very nice , very good quality for the sea themed wedding but it filled the room with a very bad smell&lt;br /&gt;I am not sure if u am gonna use for hair design of flower girl</li>
    <li> So it only came with one starfish barrette. Not great.</li>
    <li> This was a real starfish! Smell HORRIBLE... I am still in sock I purchased a dead animal ...</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s really cute but the only problem is it does stink a lot. But besides the smell it is cute plus the shipping was super fast.</li>
    <li> The product was okay. It smelled really bad because its a real starfish. That is to be expected. I realized this after i purchased it. Otherwise I would have gone with another product. After a few hours of spraying hairspray over the item, I was able to conceal the smell. I haven&#x27;t smelled it since. (I used a soft dove hairspray though i would recommend a harder hold spray)</li>
    <li> It shows TWO starfish clips, therefore I thought I would RECEIVE Two Starfish clips. Cheaply made... and only have One.</li>
    <li> As much as I want a cute and beachy hair clip, we really shouldn&#x27;t be purchasing DEAD animals to put them in our hair. These are REAL sea stars that used to be alive and were killed under a drying light to make your hair clip. As a lover of nature and a marine biologist, I can assure you that this is not &amp;#34;cute&amp;#34; or humane in any way. Please don&#x27;t buy this or maybe someday someone will be wearing you in their hair too.</li>
    <li> All different sizes love it</li>
    <li> It smells cow cow manure... I&#x27;m not sure that is spelled correctly but there you have it. Don&#x27;t buy it unless you kniw how to get rid of the smell and/or have money to spare.</li>
    <li> I love it so much but it smells like dirty sea water.</li>
    <li> Basically what everyone else has already said but it does in fact smell like the ocean and it&#x27;s not appealing in that sense.  And second it does not stay in your hair as easily as I thought it would, it kept slipping off.  Would not recommend.  It was also very bulky.</li>
    <li> DO NOT BUY!!!!!! SMELLS SOOOOOOOO BAD! Doesn&#x27;t matter how long you air it out for or how much you spray Febreze on it, the smell doesn&#x27;t go away or can make it even smell worse!</li>
    <li> I was really excited when this came in the mail. It took so long I was surprised when I looked in my mail box. The clip is cute but you can smell the fish through all of the packaging. I opened this while I was outside and not even the fresh air could fix this problem. Who want to walk around with a smelly dead star fish on their head. I do not reccomend this product and would like my money back or sent something new and better, not a dead fish &amp;#62;&amp;#60;))),&amp;#62;</li>
    <li> Smaller than expected but holding up quite nicely:)</li>
    <li> I was really impressed with this when I got it, it looks very realistic, I think they actually used real starfish.  The only thing is I have very fine hair so the clip doesn&#x27;t always stay in very well.</li>
    <li> This starfish hair clip was so stinky, it smells up the entire room that it is in. I assumed that if it was made to wear in your hair that it would have been processed and the rotten fish smell would have been taken care of. That is not the case with this starfish hair clip. I just threw it away, gross!!</li>
    <li> Beautiful and very fashionable</li>
    <li> Very pretty, however they have an awful smell....but it is a dead sea creature after all! I aired them out in a container of baking soda and that helped greatly!</li>
    <li> Its rral starfish so thats cool but the clip is so hard to open im afraid ill crush the starfish if I try to open it. The clip is about 3 inches.</li>
    <li> So cute! Arrived before my estimated arrival time. Which was until after the third of November</li>
    <li> I love this but it smells so bad, I thought people were exaggerating but I had it open in the car and the car had to be aired out it smelt so bad, my fingers smaller bag from touching it so I had to use hand sanitizer and lotion to get the smell away, Idk what to do with it, it stinks too much to wear @+@</li>
    <li> product was alright, felt quite strange. however, I will not be using this. the smell was OVERWHELMINGLY awful. it smelled as if a dog had slobbered all over it. we soaked it inside of bleach and then rinsed it off, and it still smelled horrid.</li>
    <li> it smelt horrible when i got it</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t wait to wear these with a sundress this Summer!  They are just beautiful! Well made, flawless and well worth the price!  I love the fact that they are natural sea stars and unique.  I thought they would be very delicate and easily breakable, but they seem sturdy and will be able to handle my thick, wavy hair.  I will feel like a beautiful mermaid in these!! Super cute accessory!</li>
    <li> Cute. Good size. Very bad smell.</li>
    <li> Smells fishy, and my hair gets caught in the clip.</li>
    <li> It arrived broken and I&#x27;m not sure it can be fixed</li>
    <li> I bought two of these for my beach wedding. I had only been wearing them for a couple hours and was in the middle of getting my pictures taken when one suddenly fell off the clip for absolutely NO reason. Also, they smell HORRIBLE. Obviously it&#x27;s gonna have an odor because it&#x27;s a dead sea creature, but I&#x27;ve brought home a few things from the beach that I&#x27;ve given a bleach bath and they don&#x27;t smell nearly as bad. Whenever my husband leaned over to kiss me, I&#x27;m SURE he smelled this thing since it was clipped to the side of my head. I could smell it on my own head whenever I was in a closed space like a bathroom stall or elevator...I&#x27;m sure I wasn&#x27;t the only one who could smell it.&lt;br /&gt;Although the smell was quite annoying, my biggest complaint is only that it fell off the clip a couple hours into wearing it. I really didn&#x27;t like having to make a stop for super glue on my wedding day.</li>
    <li> SMELLS yucky arived broken I have to glue mine back together Ummmm for the price I guess it&#x27;s ok</li>
    <li> This product was a huge dissapointment. It comes from China and after it finally arrived it was damaged, the clip was not attached to the star some of the tips on top of the star were broken. The star reaks of chemicals it&#x27;s a terrible smell so even if it wasn&#x27;t damaged I would still recomment not buying it since we have no way of knowing whether it has been treated with toxic chemicals.</li>
    <li> Beautiful in my red hair feels like a mermaid</li>
    <li> Oh my god the smell! Super cute, but there is no way this thing is going in my hair. I guess it would be good if I wanted to get swarmed by seagulls or something...&lt;br /&gt;Do yourself a favor and just buy a craft ready starfish from Michael&#x27;s and hot glue it to a clip.</li>
    <li> Pretty but cheaply made, only using for decorating, it seems like it could be easily broken</li>
    <li> Not what I expected at all the package smelled horrific. It was like I had ordered rotten fish. Not pleased with this product at all. How could I wear this in my hair with such a pungent Oder, And it took forever to come in the mail.</li>
    <li> Adorable for my little mermaid!!</li>
    <li> Use bleach to kill the smell.</li>
    <li> Had an awful smell. Smells like it was taken from the ocean and never cleaned correctly</li>
    <li> The picture kinda fooled me. I thought there were two coming in the mail but only 1 did. Looks great</li>
    <li> Smaller than what I thought. Does smell bad. I painted it with fingernail polish to give sparkle and mask the smell.</li>
    <li> I ordered two of these and one came in perfect condition but the other came with one leg hanging off and when I picked it up some pieces fell off the top, not sure if I can glue it back together but I&#x27;m not too worried because the other one is just fine! Also I didn&#x27;t have any issues with smell that some people mentioned</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t complain about the smell when you buy a dead animal. Don&#x27;t buy this in the first place! It&#x27;s a Dead Sea creature. What do you expect</li>
    <li> Smelled horrible. It is an ACTUAL star fish.</li>
    <li> hate it it has a weird smell, if I can get my money back I would gladly appreciate it.. ugly</li>
    <li> I bought this for a Halloween costume and from the moment I opened the package, I knew I was going to have to post a review...&lt;br /&gt;Pros: the starfish is beautiful and realistic. Great size, not too small. It was what I was expecting to see.&lt;br /&gt;Cons: the starfish is definitely real because when I opened the package, a rotten stench came from it. It was as if the starfish was still decomposing when it was packaged. ABSOLUTELY disgusting. I had to air it out (still airing out) and spray it with fragrances.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m still iffy about putting it in my hair and I&#x27;m afraid that flies or some other bugs will surround it.Hopefully the smell goes away for sure or I will not be wearing this at all.</li>
    <li> Only comes with one and it smells awful</li>
    <li> It came on time, and was what I expected, however, it smelled awful. We had to soak it in ammonia to get the smell to go away, which broke off some of the knobs on top. I only bought it for a halloween costume, I probably won&#x27;t wear it again.</li>
    <li> only comes with one starfish, not two as shown in the picture. Misleading advertisement.</li>
    <li> SMELL LIKE COMPLETE ASS! NOT A LIE! I sprayed bleach on several times and I gag when I am around  them! EWWWWWW!!!!!DON&#x27;T WASTE YOUR TIME OR $$$$</li>
    <li> super adorable and worked perfectly for my mermaid costume. my only problem, the smell. they smelled like a mixture of a boardwalk chachki store and artificial fish, therefore; I have to give this three stars</li>
    <li> Sent broken. Been having troubles with another product I wanted to return to china so I will not waste me time sending this one back. However I bought the clip from another company and its super cute.</li>
    <li> It does smell terrible, and i tried various things to make it smell better, but none really worked. I finally just let it air out for a week or two and it smells fine now, and looks super cute.</li>
    <li> Smaller than expected and took to long to receive it</li>
    <li> Super cheap  ( obviously )</li>
    <li> Broke as soon as I took it out</li>
    <li> The starfish clip looks great, but it smells so bad I can&#x27;t use it.  Tried to air it out but the smell won&#x27;t go away.</li>
    <li> pretty and cool and mermaidy i love and wear it quite a bit</li>
    <li> I love it. Very fast shipping. Was here within a week and a half. Thanks !</li>
    <li> My girlfriend loves mermaids and these hair clips complement her style so well. They smell like fish out of the package. Air out required.</li>
    <li> I wear this all the time!</li>
    <li> looks nice, but has terrible smell. if you put it on your hair, nobody will stand beside you. I don&#x27;t advice</li>
    <li> My sons girlfriend loved this</li>
    <li> I guess I should have read further because I thought I came with two but it&#x27;s only one. Sad.</li>
    <li> Looks amazing, just what i wanted for a perfect mermaid look!!! Only problem is it smells REALLY bad. Really bad</li>
    <li> Item came wrapped in bubble wrap but was broken. The material used to make this item was very poor as it felt flakey and very fragile. Not satisfied with this product.</li>
    <li> These smelt so bad that i never got to use them!!! Barf!</li>
    <li> It was awful. I took it out the pack and it smelt like death like they just took it out the ocean and glued a clip to it. I will not be wearing it at all.</li>
    <li> Smelled horrible !! I tried every thing the smell didn&#x27;t go away!</li>
    <li> Well first off it wasn&#x27;t &amp;#34;flakey&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;huge&amp;#34; it was appropriate sized, and looked really nice!(about the size that the picture showed compared to that girl) it doesn&#x27;t smell as bad as the other reviews claimed. it wasn&#x27;t insanely strong and didn&#x27;t smell that horrible, but it didn&#x27;t smell great either; nothing that a spray or two of febreeze couldn&#x27;t fix. I would buy again!</li>
    <li> I have not published this product yet...but, intend on it.  However, I am amazed at how many people do not read product descriptions.  In the description it clearly states 1per quantity and for warns the consumer about product having a halobios smell.  Read product descriptions before you purchase, and you won&#x27;t be so surprised!  Like me for example: I&#x27;m ordering 3, because I read product description and saw it only comes as 1 (even though the image shows 2, that&#x27;s advertising in the fashion world).  How often does a dress come with every accessory the model is wearing...NEVER!! Unless you order the accessories, you only get the dress.  Think about it... the starfish look better with more than one...advertising!!&lt;br /&gt;Also, I&#x27;m fully expecting the starfish to have a halobios smell to them...they are from the ocean...not cast in plastic from a mold in a factory.&lt;br /&gt;Now with that being said, let&#x27;s hope the barrettes don&#x27;t fall off the starfish as easily as one reviewer said. Guess I&#x27;ll just have to keep superglue with me.&lt;br /&gt;As soon as I receive my starfish barrettes, I&#x27;ll leave an updated version of my critique.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Peace</li>
    <li> Still somewhat raw. Very stinky.</li>
    <li> Smells a little funny and seems very fragile. But the price was right.</li>
    <li> It smells like it used to be real</li>
    <li> Looks just like picture, but smells absolutely awful.</li>
    <li> I ordered this product for my daughter, received it, and when she opened it it smelled revolting. I&#x27;m wondering if this was real?? And why hadn&#x27;t anyone made it so it wouldn&#x27;t smell? Or at least put it as a real starfish under the information.</li>
    <li> Fantastic transaction! Product exactly as described! Love it! Thank you! Very professional! I did think I would get two though. Its only one.</li>
    <li> Beautiful and on time</li>
    <li> Love it, very beautiful but smaller than I thought.</li>
    <li> It stinks!!! Literally is smells bad! I had to throw it away!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know why but when I received the item and o</li>
