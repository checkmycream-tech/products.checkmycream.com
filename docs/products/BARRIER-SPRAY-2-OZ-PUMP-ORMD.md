      <li>My review is honest and unbiased.</li>
      <li>a nice seal over your finished makeup.</li>
      <li>My review is honest and unbiased.</li>
      <li>bought this product with my own money and of my own volition.</li>
      <li>BUT... I asked my wife how she liked it, she said \\&quot;OH</li>
      <li>Found this originally to seal a &amp;#34;sugar skull&amp;#34; full-face makeup, for which it worked great.</li>
      <li>Very easy to wash off with soap and water.</li>
      <li>It smells very strongly of alcohol.</li>
      <li>Better than wearing nothing though.</li>
      <li>My makeup looks better and lasts better if I don&#x27;t use Mehron Barrier Spray.</li>
      <li>so I just pat on more powder and all is a-okay.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Not for sure</li>
      <li>I think that is more the makeup&#x27;s fault than the spray.</li>
      <li>Sure, this stuff will make your makeup stay in place.. until it makes your face CRACK.</li>
      <li>Thanks for the great product.</li>
      <li>so make sure</li>
      <li>and I love it.</li>
      <li>I have to newer ones and not found anything better.</li>
      <li>Wasn&#x27;t sure if this would make I difference, but I wanted to give it a try.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s phenomenal.</li>
      <li>Love this barrier spray.</li>
      <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m sure for cosplay and theater</li>
      <li>Mehron body paint is pretty good anyway, I guess, but I don&#x27;t think this spray will make it stay on better.</li>
      <li>Was good , exactly as described .</li>
      <li>Works as stated reduces smudging and the ablility for make up to be rubbed off easily.</li>
      <li>didn&#x27;t rub off and also cleaned off fairly easily</li>
      <li>It works fine to keep you makeup smudge proof</li>
      <li>it makes me look like super model !</li>
      <li>I have super oily skin &amp;  my makeup stays put!</li>
      <li>* is great, but ladies, DO NOT TRUST THIS for your daily looks!!!</li>
      <li>ONE IMPORTANT TIP:</li>
      <li>and on top was pretty effective even with a bunch of activity on a hot day.  </li>
      <li>This barrier spray may not be quite as good as a different brand I&#x27;ve gotten, but it is so much cheaper, and no shipping charge, so I can very easily afford to use more of it, if needed.  </li>
      <li>The smell does have a strong alcohol note but quickly diminishes within seconds.</li>
      <li>It does have a strong hairspray-like smell, but it dissipates quickly.</li>
      <li>Smelled like very strong hairspray but worked well, setting makeup application through very active/sweaty performances.</li>
      <li>my makeup stays looking fresh and on point for up to 12 hours!</li>
      <li>a must have for and full body paint cosplayers.</li>
      <li>and I wear full face coverage</li>
      <li>Product arrived quick.</li>
      <li>but it dries quickly.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve ordered it a couple of times and will order it many more times in the future.</li>
      <li>but because I have super oily skin</li>
      <li>Works well for keeping makeup looking fresh for special events, but doesn&#x27;t perform as well as I&#x27;d like when worn onstage for theatre performances.</li>
      <li>It keeps my foundation perfectly in place, all day long, in 100 degree humid southern heat.</li>
      <li>the spray comes out very quickly, and because I have eyelash extensions on, I was very nervous.</li>
      <li>The tingly feeling prior to putting the make up is refreshing!</li>
      <li>Trust me, I know now that it&#x27;s worth</li>
      <li>I just tried this yesterday, and my makeup stayed fresh from 5:30 in the morning until about 5:30 in the evening.</li>
      <li>Not as good as expected.</li>
      <li>I needed something to keep my makeup looking fresh for extended periods of time.</li>
      <li>so worth it and</li>
      <li>I had a very positive experience using it with Kryolan Aquacolor body paints.</li>
      <li>It comes off easily with a makeup remover (or coconut oil), but it keeps your makeup pretty much water</li>
      <li>I tried this underneath my airbrush makeup yesterday in class-- after 3.5hrs of intense, super sweaty rehearsal</li>
      <li>I got this in search of a more economical replacement for my urban decay all nighter spray, and boy does it work.</li>
      <li>Spending a bit more on a higher quality spray nozzle would be worth the extra money.</li>
      <li>Would absolutely buy again!</li>
      <li>It feels sticky when you first apply it</li>
      <li>At that time all I had to do was put some more setting powder on my nose and forehead to get it to last the rest of the night.</li>
      <li>spray this lightly on my face before my primer and also once my makeup is complete.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This is the best primer I&#x27;ve ever used and I&#x27;ve used it every day since I purchased it. My recommendation is to apply lotion, let it dry completely, apply the spray all over face, use makeup sponge to pat into pours quickly after application, wait until it&#x27;s completely dry before applying foundation. My make up stays on all day even after playing tennis or bike riding.</li>
    <li> I just tried this yesterday, and my makeup stayed fresh from 5:30 in the morning until about 5:30 in the evening. At that time all I had to do was put some more setting powder on my nose and forehead to get it to last the rest of the night. Amazing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As an FYI - the spray comes out very quickly, and because I have eyelash extensions on, I was very nervous. I sprayed it on my left cheek and it felt like I would have had to spay again in multiple places because it doesn&#x27;t come out &amp;#34;misty&amp;#34;. So what I did was sprayed it again on my forehead and then used a brush to blot the rest of my face. Next time I am going to spray it onto a tray that I use and then use a brush to apply all over.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a must have for me.  It prevents my makeup from melting or rubbing off.  Also seems to help block the shine.</li>
    <li> I had high hopes for this to replace my Urban Decay All Nighter Spray. Unfortunately it was a horrible mistake to buy this. I tried this every day for a week to really give it a chance and I just can&#x27;t do it anymore. It smells very strongly of alcohol. The spray mist isn&#x27;t fine enough and so you get too much spray and can&#x27;t cover your whole face in one go. The real deal breaker for me though is that I found that it separates my foundation. UD All Nighter never did that. My makeup looks better and lasts better if I don&#x27;t use Mehron Barrier Spray. It has been very disappointing, but at least it was relatively cheap.</li>
    <li> Found this originally to seal a &amp;#34;sugar skull&amp;#34; full-face makeup, for which it worked great. Continued using it for general use, since my skin tends to eat makeup. It does smell fishy, but only at the instance of spraying it. ONE IMPORTANT TIP: I spray BEFORE mascara, because with my eyes closed, it will &amp;#34;glue&amp;#34; my eyelashes to my face, if I&#x27;m wearing mascara. So, foundation/blush/shadow/liner then spray, THEN mascara.</li>
    <li> This has been around long before the current crop of makeup setting sprays became available and I love it. I have to newer ones and not found anything better.</li>
    <li> I got this in search of a more economical replacement for my urban decay all nighter spray, and boy does it work. I will say unlike my UD spray it does go on sticky at first but once it dries I find it actually works better and making my make up last through the day and heat. One con is that I noticed is if it gets on my hair it does not do well with heat styling so make sure you put on like a towel, shower cap or pull your hair back to avoid that.</li>
    <li> Great people to purchase from.</li>
    <li> Used this on my daughter during a play.  She was painted at 6 pm and didn&#x27;t go on until 7:15.  She cried before and during from nervousness and only a little of her makeup smeared.  We used quality face paints, so it could have been the 2 combined.  I use this on my face now after applying makeup.  I sweat a lot around my eyes and usually by the day, my eyes have disappeared from my face because there is no makeup left.  Not now.  My liner and shadow look almost like they did at the beginning of the day.  Would recommend.  4 stars because the spray is not as well dispersed as I think it could be.  Spending a bit more on a higher quality spray nozzle would be worth the extra money.</li>
    <li> Bottle arrived damaged. Does not miss rather squirt.</li>
    <li> My skin is oily/combination, acne prone, dehydrated, sensitive, and I have scarring... so i basically have horrible skin.&lt;br /&gt;I spray this lightly on my face before my primer and also once my makeup is complete. It doesn&#x27;t smell weird and doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin, which is good. I use this on a daily basis. It definitely helps my makeup stay on for longer as well as keep the oils from seeping through, HOWEVER, it does NOT prevent my skin from absorbing the water from my foundation and causing it to break up. (When you have dehydrated skin, your face will absorb the moisture from your makeup causing it to look spotty and blotchy and gross.) With that being said, my skin is only dehydrated in my nose/chin/mouth area... everywhere else on my face is fairly normal skin... and in THOSE areas... my makeup stays looking fresh and on point for up to 12 hours! I was out and about in the hot sun yesterday, sweating and being gross... and my face never got sweaty and my makeup (in the not dehydrated areas) looked flawless all day. It comes off easily with a makeup remover (or coconut oil), but it keeps your makeup pretty much water proof.&lt;br /&gt;So, if you are looking for something to keep your makeup on and your skin is not dehydrated, I totally recommend this.&lt;br /&gt;I bought this product with my own money and of my own volition. My review is honest and unbiased. All opinions are my own.&lt;br /&gt;I bought this product with my own money and of my own volition. My review is honest and unbiased. All opinions are my own.</li>
    <li> Was good , exactly as described . Fast shipping , revived on date stated . Will purchase again . Thanks</li>
    <li> Wasn&#x27;t sure if this would make I difference, but I wanted to give it a try. Was pleasantly surprised. Light, doesn&#x27;t leave a heavy barrier feeling</li>
    <li> DOES NOT WORK. It simply washes away all the makeup that you spend 25 minutes applying. Too watery.</li>
    <li> I use other makeup setters.  This one makes my face tight and gives me an unnatural plastic shine especially on my forehead.</li>
    <li> This is an amazing product! I have facial hyperhydrosis and this product has changed my life! My makeup stays set ALL DAY LONG and no more greasy T-zone!! No worries about facial sweating ruining my makeup. Will order again, I think I&#x27;m a user for life!</li>
    <li> Still makes my face shinny.  Not for sure if i&#x27;m going to continue to use it.</li>
    <li> Yuck! This product did not work the way it was supposed to work. When I tried to spritz it over the clown make up and powder, it gushed out in a huge wet spray and completely ruined my make up. Very disappointing!</li>
    <li> Works as stated reduces smudging and the ablility for make up to be rubbed off easily.</li>
    <li> The spray definitely helped. Be sure to allow enough time to let it dry before putting on clothing and wigs. Product arrived quick.</li>
    <li> Great product. Living in the caribbean the humidity can be a bit much especially for makeuo wearers and I wear makeup daily. This helped my make up stay on even through sweat.</li>
    <li> I was disappointed because my Makeup transfered to my clothes. It didn&#x27;t set my my makeup.</li>
    <li> This didn&#x27;t seem to do what I wanted.  It smelled strongly of alcohol, and it seemed to make my body paint look strange, like wet and clumped, rather than preserving it.  Mehron body paint is pretty good anyway, I guess, but I don&#x27;t think this spray will make it stay on better.</li>
    <li> Great product for body paint. Dries quickly, doesn&#x27;t leave an unpleasant feeling on skin, and can be used between layers of paint (for works in progress). Very easy to wash off with soap and water. I can&#x27;t compare it to any other similar products, since this is the only product like this that I&#x27;ve used. 2 oz isn&#x27;t much if you&#x27;re using it often. BTW, if you&#x27;re using it with acrylic paint pens on skin, be aware that the paint may bleed when spray is applied. I had a very positive experience using it with Kryolan Aquacolor body paints.</li>
    <li> I tried using this as an alternative to Skindinavia&#x27;s Bridal and Oil Control makeup setting sprays after reading some reviews here that they basically work the same as this Mehron spray.. NOPE! Sure, this stuff will make your makeup stay in place.. until it makes your face CRACK. You&#x27;ll end up with DEEP WRINKLES in your face that you don&#x27;t even really have (yet) bc the spray does not allow flexibility and elasticity. Imagine smearing a thin layer of Elmer&#x27;s glue on your hand, like when you were little. And when the glue dried, it pulled your skin into wrinkles when you flexed your hand.. The same concept goes for this stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wore this out on a date one night, and when I looked in the bathroom mirror, I had hard creased smile wrinkles etched underneath my eyes, running down my cheekbones! I LOOKED JUST LIKE MY 60 YEAR OLD MOTHER. I literally effing *screamed* when I saw this. I came home and scrubbed my face until I looked 20-something again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m sure for cosplay and theater this s*** is great, but ladies, DO NOT TRUST THIS for your daily looks!!! You&#x27;ll look at least 30 years older!!! Trust me, I know now that it&#x27;s worth the splurge to buy the real stuff.</li>
    <li> Like to use this after i apply my makeup. Close your eyes first before spraying. Does have slight alcohol smell, but it goes away. I like the way it sets my everyday makeup. Just started using it. A little goes a long way. Good price. Small enough to put in my makeup bag.</li>
    <li> It holds really well dries in seconds and comes off with soap and water.</li>
    <li> Great product. I used it in conjunction with Mehron Paradise Pro Face Paint. Definitely will use it again.</li>
    <li> This barrier spray may not be quite as good as a different brand I&#x27;ve gotten, but it is so much cheaper, and no shipping charge, so I can very easily afford to use more of it, if needed.  I&#x27;ve ordered it a couple of times and will order it many more times in the future.</li>
    <li> Worked well with my white face clown (9 yr old) to help stop all the smudges!</li>
    <li> a must have for and full body paint cosplayers. I went as science!Prince Gumball and there was no pink on my white lab coat. so worth it and a little really goes a long way. I didnt use it all for an entire day of marshall lee and gumball paint sealing</li>
    <li> This stuff is awesome! I spend hours on hours outside in the heat and Georgia humidity for my job and I used this over the summer and my makeup stayed in place. It&#x27;s phenomenal. I also used it on a 15+ hour flight over the summer and my makeup looked perfect when I arrived. I was beyond shocked. I usually look like a train wreck when I get off of international flights. I would highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> It works fine to keep you makeup smudge proof</li>
    <li> (Doesn&#x27;t say I purchased because I bought this product on my moms account, since she has amazon prime.)&lt;br /&gt;I love this stuff, BUT there is one small issue. This stuff burns my face a little bit when I put it on ): I still use it though, I just can&#x27;t spray it on after eye makeup because even if I shut my eyes as tight as possible and wait a minute, it burns my eyes and makes them water. I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin so if you do, steer clear of this product. Other than that, I love this stuff, it makes my foundation last all day long in this hot weather (:</li>
    <li> Excellent product!! Really holds make up in place. Stings a little at first and you definitely have to close your eyes. But it works very well.</li>
    <li> As a professional makeup artist,  this is a MUST for my brides. Keeps the moisture off of skin, helping makeup stay put as long as possible!</li>
    <li> I bought this product to help stop sweat on my face and to keep my makeup in place. I like this product. It helps your makeup stay in place and you only need 3 -4 sprays of it to cover the entire face. It&#x27;s suppose to help stop sweat if sprayed on face before applying makeup. It didn&#x27;t stop the sweat. But the makeup did stay mainly in place only a little makeup came off. To me this product is good and I rate it a 7.</li>
    <li> it kept my makeup (mostly) intact during my mudrun, so props!</li>
    <li> I tried this project thanks to Amazon and I love it!!  I use Dermablend cover cream and the spray works great sealing my coverage.  I wish the bottle was bigger or I need to order more.  I spray once a day and my make up lasts all day!!  Thanks for the great product.</li>
    <li> I have a competitive outdoor and indoor guard that wears a lot of makeup for their performances.  They perform outside in all kinds of weather, extreme heat, rain, cold, wind you name it.  This barrier is the best at keeping their makeup looking fresh.  During the indoor season they sweat during the performance and I know they will not finish the routine with makeup running down their faces.  This is the best barrier spray.</li>
    <li> Love this barrier spray. Made the mistake of painting my bestie a pop art zombie and the paint tinted her skin Aqua.... Took us quite a while to get it off, not to mention the stress of her being tinted Aqua and having to go to work LOL. Buy the spray... Trust me. No more tinted skin.</li>
    <li> I wish it was less expensive but then again other setting sprays are double the price! I have read reviews that only use three or so sprays but because I have super oily skin and I wear full face coverage, daily, I spray my chin/nose, both cheeks, and forehead. I never have to reapply. My makeup still transfers, but not as much without this! I am re-ordering soon because it is now a permanent product in my bag. I have tried to use it over lipstick but it doesn&#x27;t work unless the lipcolor is matte. It feels sticky when you first apply it but it dries quickly. Even if you think its dry, give it a couple of more minutes before you put your clothes on. I use this after my setting powder.</li>
    <li> Here&#x27;s why I love this: I made a living statue costume and the paint fumes were just incredible. We had this spray to set the body powder. On impulse I sprayed it over the costumes, too, and bam! Way less smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as setting the body powder on our skin, this worked well. I got brushed up against a lot and the color stayed much better than I expected. Don&#x27;t use it on your eyelids though- it made my mascara hard to take off.</li>
    <li> Great product a little bit goes a long way don&#x27;t overdo when putting on .kept makeup fresh all day</li>
    <li> Really helps keep body makeup on your body and not on the couch. Make sure you wait for it to dry, otherwise you will have to reapply your makeup.</li>
    <li> Works well for keeping makeup looking fresh for special events, but doesn&#x27;t perform as well as I&#x27;d like when worn onstage for theatre performances. Those lights still make me sweat thru my makeup. Better than wearing nothing though.</li>
    <li> I needed something to keep my makeup looking fresh for extended periods of time. My job requires different activities in different humidity settings throughout the day. Often I don&#x27;t have time to touch up my makeup. I am a big fan of the Urban Decay All Nighter Long Lasting makeup spray but priced at over $30 4oz bottle I had to find something easier on my budget. I think the Mehtron Barrier Spray is exactly the same thing as Urban Decays product minus all the added perfumes. The smell does have a strong alcohol note but quickly diminishes within seconds.</li>
    <li> Great price and worked well. Shipped on time.</li>
    <li> Love this setting spray and Ben Nye&#x27;s Final Seal Matte setting spray!  I have super oily skin &amp;  my makeup stays put! No sticky feeling and some that I&#x27;ve tried burns a bit when applied.  I would give it five stars but spraying it is a pain.  Sprays out too much.</li>
    <li> Um. It said i can use it on makeup buuttt idk how im confused.</li>
    <li> Awesome stuff! Works great with both Mehron and drug store brands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Provides a nice seal over your finished makeup. When applying multiple layers, I tend to use a coat every so often just in case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When used in conjunction with Mehron&#x27;s Starblend Cake Makeup, this aids in creating a waterproof/sweat proof seal to make your makeup last. It also protects your makeup from rubbing off on clothing/costumes/cosplay.</li>
    <li> Smelled like very strong hairspray but worked well, setting makeup application through very active/sweaty performances. Don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;d use it on a client for a normal makeup application, but theatrical performances are definitely a good use for it as far as I&#x27;m concerned.</li>
    <li> makes makeup look cakey</li>
    <li> It seems like a good spray, but it did not work well with the makeup that I have. I think that is more the makeup&#x27;s fault than the spray.</li>
    <li> Not 100% sweat-proof, but using it both underneath and on top was pretty effective even with a bunch of activity on a hot day.  If you use it under your chin and on your neck, you&#x27;re going to want some setting powder to keep it from sticking to itself when you lower your chin.</li>
    <li> Not as good as expected.</li>
    <li> if you&#x27;re having problem with facial sweat... THIS IS YOUR LIFESAVER! just close your eyes when you spray it!!</li>
    <li> Love this! I sweat alot and this helps my make up stay on a great deal!!</li>
    <li> Excellent product! Used to seal my full upper body paint, and it stayed for over ten hours without fading got sweating off at all. Would absolutely buy again!</li>
    <li> Hoooooooly crap this stuff is incredible.  I purchased this for an upcoming ballet performance that will last about 3 hours.  I tend to get super sweaty and red in the face, and makeup basically melts off under the harsh stage lights.  I tried this underneath my airbrush makeup yesterday in class-- after 3.5hrs of intense, super sweaty rehearsal my makeup was perfectly in place.  Pic attached is after my rehearsal, you&#x27;d never know!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Use under your makeup as a primer and base.  I have some crazy waterproof bright blue makeup that I&#x27;ll need to airbrush on most of my face for my performance, and this will stop my face from becoming completely blue for the next 2 weeks!</li>
    <li> I have a very oily/greasy/sweaty face and usually when I take my face makeup off with those towelettes, my makeup already sweated off earlier in the day because the towelette will appear clean. I needed something to keep my foundation ON. I have tried Urban Decay&#x27;s De-Slick setting spray and it just made my face greasier. Also, its a rip-off for a $30 4 oz bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this because of the great reviews and use it with the [[ASIN:B008ND0RZY Mehron Ultrafine Makeup Setting Powder - Neutral/Translucent (0.6 Oz)]] and it&#x27;s a great combo! I have read tips to spray it on after foundation and then again when your face is all done, but it reacts with my water-based/oil-free foundation and creates \\&quot;cracks\\&quot; in the foundation so you can see my skin in the \\&quot;open areas\\&quot;. As long as I have a powder-finished face, this spray works just fine. This spray is like a glue, it&#x27;s not sticky, however if you spray it on your face, eyes closed with false eyelashes on, you will not be able to open your eyes without pulling your falsies off. I made this mistake several times when first using it and had to reapply my lashes. Because you&#x27;re spraying your face with a liquid, it leaves a shine, mainly on my forehead so I just pat on more powder and all is a-okay.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once you spray, your makeup is SET so make sure its exactly how you want it. The combo with this spray and their powder combats my greasy face but at the end of the day, I still get a shine on my t-zone, but it&#x27;s not wet so I don&#x27;t have to use blotting papers anymore, I just pat my face with translucent powder and everything looks as good as it did in the morning.</li>
    <li> I used this product in New Orleans in July and my makeup stayed on ALL DAY.  I slept in it... well I should say &amp;#34;rested&amp;#34; my eyes in it and when I got up my makeup was still in tact. It gave me a very dewy look.  Even thought it seals your makeup in it is not 100 proof. Sticky when first sprayed on your face but once it dries that goes away</li>
    <li> Hard to write an honest review when I have not actually used it. BUT... I asked my wife how she liked it, she said \\&quot;OH MY GOSH! It works great it makes me look like super model !\\&quot; well, I have to agree with her on that! She has people asking what makeup she is using after using this...she says same makeup... just added this Barrier spray! She said \\&quot;Well worth this price and then some!!!! \\&quot;</li>
    <li> Used it when I had grey body paint on my legs. didn&#x27;t rub off and also cleaned off fairly easily</li>
    <li> Keeps stage makeup on for ages - but mascara is impossible to get off afterwards. Works just like it&#x27;s meant to! A charm!</li>
    <li> I love this spray! The tingly feeling prior to putting the make up is refreshing! I spray my face before and after and the makeup stays intact all day and makes my face look flawless! I have received many compliments lately.</li>
    <li> I know this is for theater, but I actually ordered it for my upcoming wedding. I&#x27;ve used it several times as I&#x27;ve experimented with how I&#x27;d like my makeup to look, and I have to say, this stuff is awesome. It keeps my foundation perfectly in place, all day long, in 100 degree humid southern heat. I only wish it worked on my eyeshadow, but I&#x27;m not trying to spray this stuff in my eyes. It does have a strong hairspray-like smell, but it dissipates quickly. Just spritz spritz spritz, hold still with your eyes closed for a few seconds, and your makeup is set! The best stuff I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
    <li> Didnt really ever dry, but it came highly recommended so I tried it. Now I know.</li>
    <li> Makes makeup look blotchy</li>
