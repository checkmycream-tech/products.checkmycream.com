      <li>I love this product and always have!</li>
      <li>Everyone thinks I am a great cook, they just don&#x27;t know the amazing resources I have available.</li>
      <li>Honestly I give it one star because your hair won&#x27;t move.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t work any kind of wonders for my hair and isn&#x27;t work the headache of trying to wash out.</li>
      <li>This stuff works you just have to warm it up with water or by rubbing your hands together to warm the pomade so it spreads even.</li>
      <li>This pomade is great though, it has a very high hold and a nice medium shine, and i love it</li>
      <li>You&#x27;ve changed my life for the better and for that, I thank you.</li>
      <li>It is firmer and more tachy (stickier) than I had hoped.  </li>
      <li>There&#x27;s much better pomade around, though it will cost more.</li>
      <li>the only thing that i can use to control it is this Pomade, and its the best ever!</li>
      <li>you are looking for a pomade to get a nice clean cut</li>
      <li>If you grease your hair in a pomp like I do it works, if your going for a more clean combover it works.</li>
      <li>but if you have generally unruly hair, as I do, this will surely do quite nicely.</li>
      <li>My hair looks and feels ten times more fabulous than before with Murray&#x27;s pomade!</li>
      <li>about Mary\\&quot; and look for the swoop hair, seriously I&#x27;m not kidding you will not be able to run your fingers through your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Okay i love this product, but since its not a water based pomade it is kind of hard to get out of your hair.</li>
      <li>And the design is so old school, I feel like I&#x27;m a rockabilly star :)</li>
      <li>I do have to say it held very very well.</li>
      <li>hot glue</li>
      <li>Murray&#x27;s is exactly what I have been looking for.</li>
      <li>My first pomade</li>
      <li>Its perfect and a little goes a very long way!</li>
      <li>Mixed this with some basil and served it up on some gluten free whole wheat crackers for my albino youth group.</li>
      <li>pomade is very waxy.</li>
      <li>Its just very oily.</li>
      <li>Curly or straight</li>
      <li>/&gt;It holds very well, keeps my pompadour up, doesn&#x27;t break out my forehead, and lasts!&lt;br</li>
      <li>Although this product is primarily for African Americans the person using it is not.  </li>
      <li>My hair is very frizzy and rediculous.</li>
      <li>and it is very affordable.</li>
      <li>Finally, A vegan wax that really glue your hair!</li>
      <li>What everyone says is true this stuff is second only to Gorilla Glue.</li>
      <li>What everyone says is true this stuff is second only to Gorilla Glue.</li>
      <li>I just know if you have straight asian hair like myself, this pomade is not for you.</li>
      <li>I had to really rub it in my hands to get it to melt enough to apply.</li>
      <li>Great hold very very faint smell like a baby doll.</li>
      <li>Just remember one can is a lifetime supply so only use a little at a time and spread even, don&#x27;t take a huge chunck out unless you intend on having it in your hair for the next week or so!</li>
      <li>that is complete and utter bull.</li>
      <li>look(I have thick straight hair that I part on the left side and comb to the right, Blonde)</li>
      <li>It made most of my hair flat, and some little spikes that formed around my cowlick did not stay down.</li>

<li> It made most of my hair flat, and some little spikes that formed around my cowlick did not stay down.</li>
<li> That right there should be enough to at least try it.</li>
<li> This stuff will make your hair flat and</li>
<li> Now all of this stuff is forgivable, what really did it in for me is how hard this stuff is to wash out.</li>
<li> /&gt;It does take a little work to wash it out of your hair if you use a lot... but still, no other pomade even comes close!</li>
<li> I used about a quarter size glob of it, I put my index finger in and stuck it in about half a nail deep and scooped it up.</li>
<li> Not very shiny.</li>
<li> I never could seem to tame my hair properly.</li>
<li> But it does seem to take very little product to give the effect, so it goes a long way.  </li>
<li> After seeing that I was going to be late I grudgingly left for work.</li>
<li> This pomade is extremely thick and actually creates a waxy coating on your hands when you attempt to apply it.</li>
<li> is it stays on all day and doesn&#x27;t leave a hair out of place but the down side is that it wouldn&#x27;t wash out even when I had put dish washer soap on my hair</li>
<li> this lays the edges down.</li>
<li> What I mean by flexibility is I can put the pomade in my hair at 8AM, and at 8PM after working out, I can recomb my hair into a completely different style, and it will form perfectly.&lt;br</li>
<li> you cant lay your head down on anything without making a mess.</li>
<li> and I have thick long hair.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s a little messy</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve been using this for years started in late 1990&#x27;s and still use it to this day, if I need the extra hold it does make your pillow Oily and need to use a face cleaner at least once a week.</li>
<li> I applied it on a towel dried hair.</li>
<li> I was working on my hair for 30 min this morning because this Pomade was too heavy</li>
<li> Not smooth like Crew and Suave.  </li>
<li> but let me tell you exactly how bad it is.</li>
<li> It is inexpensive and has been used for the past century.</li>
<li> I have been trying different products for years, and they have always been mediocre.</li>
<li> However it is near impossible to comb through and takes like 3 showers to wash it out of your hair.</li>
<li> To remove product, lather olive oil and rinse, then get grease cutting dishwasher detergent (dawn) and lather, repeat the detergent step about 4 times, comb hair and do a final rinse with shampoo and conditioner.</li>
<li> would definitely at least try this product.</li>
<li> Yeah this stuff is thick to say the least, However.</li>
<li> seriously look elsewhere.</li>
<li> It was very thick and not at all what I was looking for...</li>
<li> What is worse the Murrays that DID wash out ended up on my face, so even after washing my face 2 times with a scrub I still have a waxy layer on my cheek and forehead</li>
<li> I am not sure why anyone would want a product that is so bloody hard to remove I dont look forward to putting my greasy waxy hair on my pillow.</li>
<li> This has to be the worst hair product that I&#x27;ve personally ever used.</li>
<li> The product would not come out of my hair which was very frustrating for myself and my hairstylist.</li>
<li> I got this thick, nasty, curly Guido hair and nothing would ever work on it.</li>
<li> If someone runs their hand through your hair, they will feel the waxy texture, but it isn&#x27;t as bad as some gels can be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> I know you all hear of how bad Murray&#x27;s is to wash</li>
<li> This pomade does not work for me, the experience was terrible.</li>

    <li> Okay i love this product, but since its not a water based pomade it is kind of hard to get out of your hair. This pomade is great though, it has a very high hold and a nice medium shine, and i love it and it is very affordable.</li>
    <li> Finally, A vegan wax that really glue your hair! And the design is so old school, I feel like I&#x27;m a rockabilly star :)</li>
    <li> I have been trying different products for years, and they have always been mediocre. I have very coarse and wavey hair. I never could seem to tame my hair properly. Murray&#x27;s is exactly what I have been looking for. It tames your hair with great flexibility. What I mean by flexibility is I can put the pomade in my hair at 8AM, and at 8PM after working out, I can recomb my hair into a completely different style, and it will form perfectly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pomade is very waxy. It will stick to your hand after applying, but that&#x27;s nothing soap and water can&#x27;t resolve. If someone runs their hand through your hair, they will feel the waxy texture, but it isn&#x27;t as bad as some gels can be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely at least try this product. It is inexpensive and has been used for the past century. That right there should be enough to at least try it. It is the only product I&#x27;ll personally use from now on.</li>
    <li> Holds hair really good</li>
    <li> My first pomade but I&#x27;ll admit I&#x27;m a big fan</li>
    <li> Mixed this with some basil and served it up on some gluten free whole wheat crackers for my albino youth group. The kids couldn&#x27;t get enough!! Very satisfied. Everyone thinks I am a great cook, they just don&#x27;t know the amazing resources I have available.</li>
    <li> I love this product and always have! This is the only product that works for me no matter what state my hair is in. Curly or straight this lays the edges down. I am a woman who uses this product only for edge control. Its perfect and a little goes a very long way!</li>
    <li> Honestly I give it one star because your hair won&#x27;t move. However it is near impossible to comb through and takes like 3 showers to wash it out of your hair.</li>
    <li> To remove product, lather olive oil and rinse, then get grease cutting dishwasher detergent (dawn) and lather, repeat the detergent step about 4 times, comb hair and do a final rinse with shampoo and conditioner. You&#x27;re welcome in advance btw this took like 30 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking for a pomade to get a nice clean cut look(I have thick straight hair that I part on the left side and comb to the right, Blonde) seriously look elsewhere. I heard Jon Hamm and Dicaprio wear this, that is complete and utter bull. This stuff will make your hair flat and spiky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wonder what this stuff looks like? google image search Cameron Diaz in \\&quot;There&#x27;s something about Mary\\&quot; and look for the swoop hair, seriously I&#x27;m not kidding you will not be able to run your fingers through your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It sticks to EVERYTHING.</li>
    <li> Im going to keep this short. This pomade does not work for me, the experience was terrible. I was working on my hair for 30 min this morning because this Pomade was too heavy and it flattened my hair. After seeing that I was going to be late I grudgingly left for work. I used about a quarter size glob of it, I put my index finger in and stuck it in about half a nail deep and scooped it up. The consistence is like uh...hot glue I guess. I had to really rub it in my hands to get it to melt enough to apply. I applied it on a towel dried hair. It made most of my hair flat, and some little spikes that formed around my cowlick did not stay down. I do have to say it held very very well. But its over kill in my opinion. Heres a example, today I went to cardio kickboxing class and sweated like a mule. I came out of there with my hair still the same looking. All that sweat did nothing to phase my hairdo. Now all of this stuff is forgivable, what really did it in for me is how hard this stuff is to wash out. I know you all hear of how bad Murray&#x27;s is to wash but let me tell you exactly how bad it is. The internet downplays it in a joking manner, I am not amused. I washed my hair 5 times in the shower with 2 Shampoo&#x27;s scrubbing and massaging vigorously; to no avail. So I took my soap bar and tried that, did not work. I then tried conditioner thinking maybe it would soften my hair but that didnt work either. After towel drying my hair, I can still sculpt it, like if I just applied hair spray. I am not sure why anyone would want a product that is so bloody hard to remove I dont look forward to putting my greasy waxy hair on my pillow. What is worse the Murrays that DID wash out ended up on my face, so even after washing my face 2 times with a scrub I still have a waxy layer on my cheek and forehead area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So in conclusion, yeah this stuff is not for me. I think I might try Vitali&#x27;s or Groom&amp;Clean next as they are water based and easier to wash out. I give it 3 stars because the product works. What everyone says is true this stuff is second only to Gorilla Glue. Its just not for me, if I rated on personal experience I would give it a 1 star. I plan on giving the remaining Murray&#x27;s to a co worker as a gag joke. If I am going to have this crud in my hair for a week I might as well have someone to share my agony with.ause the product works. What everyone says is true this stuff is second only to Gorilla Glue. Its just not for me, if I rated on personal experience I would give it a 1 star. I plan on giving the remaining Murray&#x27;s to a co worker as a gag joke. If I am going to have this crud in my hair for a week I might as well have someone to share my agony with.</li>
    <li> When I purchased this I didn&#x27;t realize it was for people of color and of no use to me. It was very thick and not at all what I was looking for...so into the trash it went.</li>
    <li> My hair is very frizzy and rediculous. the only thing that i can use to control it is this Pomade, and its the best ever!</li>
    <li> Murrays is one of a kind! Just love it!</li>
    <li> They should call this stuff hair cement. I got this thick, nasty, curly Guido hair and nothing would ever work on it. Until I found you, Murray. You&#x27;ve changed my life for the better and for that, I thank you. This stuff is like 4 bucks and it lasted me about 4 years. I wish I could meet Murray and personally thank him</li>
    <li> Product came as promised without any problems.  It is firmer and more tachy (stickier) than I had hoped.  It has a similar consisteny to the royal crown type of pomade.  Not smooth like Crew and Suave.  Therefore, it holds really well but doesn&#x27;t run through your hair as well and is harder to wash out and even harder to get off your hands.  But it does seem to take very little product to give the effect, so it goes a long way.  Good bargain for price</li>
    <li> This stuff is not so great. Its just very oily. There&#x27;s much better pomade around, though it will cost more.</li>
    <li> This has to be the worst hair product that I&#x27;ve personally ever used. The product would not come out of my hair which was very frustrating for myself and my hairstylist. It doesn&#x27;t work any kind of wonders for my hair and isn&#x27;t work the headache of trying to wash out.</li>
    <li> This pomade is extremely thick and actually creates a waxy coating on your hands when you attempt to apply it. It actually feels like waterproofing wax, that you might apply to canvas bags. I actually think this pomade is designed for African Americans, just based on the packaging, but I&#x27;m no expert! I just know if you have straight asian hair like myself, this pomade is not for you.</li>
    <li> What a worthwhile and fulfilling purchase! My hair looks and feels ten times more fabulous than before with Murray&#x27;s pomade!</li>
    <li> This is the only pomade I&#x27;ll use now!&lt;br /&gt;It holds very well, keeps my pompadour up, doesn&#x27;t break out my forehead, and lasts!&lt;br /&gt;It does take a little work to wash it out of your hair if you use a lot... but still, no other pomade even comes close!</li>
    <li> Great hold very very faint smell like a baby doll. Not very shiny. This is a great pomade and for the price it can&#x27;t be beat.</li>
    <li> Yeah this stuff is thick to say the least, However. All you need to do is heat it up. I use a blow dryer and heat the can for about a min. I use about a dime size dollop and its plenty for me and I have thick long hair. Anyone can use this stuff, you just need to learn how.</li>
    <li> This might look like a great product but its not, yes it does have one perk whitch is it stays on all day and doesn&#x27;t leave a hair out of place but the down side is that it wouldn&#x27;t wash out even when I had put dish washer soap on my hair I ended up having to cut my hair.</li>
    <li> This stuff works you just have to warm it up with water or by rubbing your hands together to warm the pomade so it spreads even. I&#x27;ve been using this for years started in late 1990&#x27;s and still use it to this day, if I need the extra hold it does make your pillow Oily and need to use a face cleaner at least once a week. If you grease your hair in a pomp like I do it works, if your going for a more clean combover it works. Just remember one can is a lifetime supply so only use a little at a time and spread even, don&#x27;t take a huge chunck out unless you intend on having it in your hair for the next week or so!</li>
    <li> you cant lay your head down on anything without making a mess. im using another name brand that works great, but figured i would try a cheaper brand.</li>
    <li> Someone asked me to bring this product to them.  Although this product is primarily for African Americans the person using it is not.  It holds his blond hair in place.  Ironically iot was cheaper on Amazon.com then in the store.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a little messy but if you have generally unruly hair, as I do, this will surely do quite nicely.</li>
