      <li>Love love love this stuff!  </li>
      <li>I used her oil and totally loved it, this scent is really unique and catches lots of attention.</li>
      <li>It smelled great at first, and now there&#x27;s not even a fragrance.  </li>
      <li>Am very loyal to this product and as always I am always happy with how quick it arrives.</li>
      <li>a side note I will say this oil is very light</li>
      <li>The bottle I purchased on Amazon was visibly more liquidy.</li>
      <li>Guys love it</li>
      <li>I hope the seller is listening and stops buying amber oil from Nemat until it is a better product again.</li>
      <li>This is the perfect oil  to wear daily.</li>
      <li>Store bought versions are way more potent.</li>
      <li>I have purchased from this seller several times and am so happy with the Amber oil!  </li>
      <li>Love the smell</li>
      <li>My sister hates it, but my mother and I love it-</li>
      <li>If it is a matter of making money, I would pay more for it.</li>
      <li>Nemat needs to add more fragrance to the oil.</li>
      <li>I bought my girlfriend one, and she love it</li>
      <li>Not to mention, my name is Amber :)</li>
      <li>I love this as a perfume oil.  </li>
      <li>Love this scent, I&#x27;ve used it before.</li>
      <li>I Love this oil.</li>
      <li>love doing business here.</li>
      <li>and I couldn&#x27;t have described it better myself.  </li>
      <li>and it was not as potent.</li>
      <li>so I went to put more on and to my surprise when I opened the bottle . . .</li>
      <li>Smells so clean!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s such a beautiful, sweet, woodsy scent that you cannot overdo, in my honest opinion.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Contact Nemat: toll free from USA or Canada :  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very powerful and lasts all day.</li>
      <li>Very clean and fresh</li>
      <li>In it&#x27;s original form, two drops or finger dabs of amber scent FILLED a room but never overpowered.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s original glory.&lt;br</li>
      <li>i usually have to find it at the grocery store that is way across town, so it&#x27;s awesome to find it it online.  </li>
      <li>I love the scent because it is great throughout the year and is never too heavy or musky.  </li>
      <li>BUT, I have purchased this directly from the manufacturer before and it was more potent.</li>
      <li>a full 5/5.</li>
      <li>I have never owned such a wonderful perfume and will probably never buy a different one for a looong time if ever.</li>
      <li>The classic amber scent (my favorite in the world) is just a hint of what it used to be.</li>
      <li>My relative who is super sensitive to perfumes and never wore perfumes or oils, loved it!</li>
      <li>/&gt;Totally worth buying</li>
      <li>bc its a soft smell and kinda sexy before bed.</li>
      <li>Worth the risk of trying.</li>
      <li>Yep, that&#x27;s right --</li>
      <li>so it is the same smell, but requires many more applications throughout the day and doesn&#x27;t pack the same punch as before.</li>
      <li>(First smelled it on someone at a grocery store and she showed me her bottle.</li>
      <li>Should have checked the reviews first.</li>
      <li>Got it fast!</li>
      <li>Wish the smell wasnt so faint, but otherwise great!</li>
      <li>This perfume is exactly what I bought at Whole Foods years ago (and can no longer find at the whole foods in DC).</li>
      <li>I wanted this Amber White oil in the bottle available in this particular bottle and am very pleased with it.&lt;br /&gt;Despite reviews of the oil being diluted, etc, I find it to be the same strength as the Nemat Amber White</li>
      <li>Thanks for the FAST</li>
      <li>She got hers in Whole Foods store in Austin, TX.</li>
      <li>Tried to by this at whole foods in Austin, Texas</li>
      <li>couldn&#x27;t smell it on me, my coworker said it wasn&#x27;t the real product</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve asked if  it is too much</li>
      <li>The whole house has a beatiful calming feel to it when there is amber mist in the air.  </li>
      <li>and I can&#x27;t really smell it on myself</li>
      <li>Like other reviewers, I smelled this on a friend fell in love with the fragrance and ordered it.  </li>
      <li>live in New York and checked a couple of the Whole Food Stores</li>
      <li>I absolutely ADORE this scent, the problem is as most of the other customers described, older/other batches seem stronger than this one, and would last much longer.</li>
      <li>When I do purchase I normally purchase 5 at a time.  </li>
      <li>I also love to put a few drops into water in a teakettle on the stove and let it waft through the house.  </li>
      <li>The smell is of the same intensity so this seller (Nemat) is not cutting corners or lowering quality.  </li>
      <li>this has probably been my favorite small that Nemat makes for EVVVVER.  </li>
      <li>the scent was COMPLETELY gone!  </li>
      <li>Which sucks, because this is my favorite oil...</li>
      <li>My husband is sensitive to perfume and says this does not bother him.</li>
      <li>Love how this fragrance is subtle and not heavy.</li>
      <li>I bought two other bottles, just to see if I had not correctly sealed the first.  </li>
      <li>In the mean time I had kept coming back to read customer reviews to see if they got any better.</li>
      <li>There is barely a scent.</li>
      <li>I showed the bottle to someone who had never heard of it and she could barely even smell it when she put it on herself.</li>
      <li>but apparently they are not participating in Nemat products distribution.</li>
      <li>This is the only fragrance I receive compliments on frequently.</li>
      <li>I will only trust ordering from this particular stellar though because I have ordered from others in the past and theirs was a diluted version</li>
      <li>I emailed the reseller and they flat out lied to me and said if I had a problem to contact Nemat directly.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very liquidish, as a result not economical at all.</li>
      <li>You really can&#x27;t water the stuff down as it is oil!  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I Love this oil. It&#x27;s my daily fragrance. I constantly  get people asking me about what I&#x27;m wearing and I get compliments on it daily!</li>
    <li> can buy it at a local store however the store was on back order. compared it to the one in the store and it was not as potent. was very disappointed. will not return and will not recommend to others. hope the sellers learns from this.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite oil!! BUT, I have purchased this directly from the manufacturer before and it was more potent. The bottle I purchased on Amazon was visibly more liquidy. I compared them together as I still had some left. So disappointed.</li>
    <li> Love the smell but it&#x27;s way too diluted. Nemat needs to add more fragrance to the oil. Very disappointed...</li>
    <li> I bought my girlfriend one, and she love it</li>
    <li> I have been ordering or purchasing this scent for years. I had heard there were some issues, and finally I found out why. The classic amber scent (my favorite in the world) is just a hint of what it used to be. I would say it smells like it has been diluted by half, I was very disappointed.</li>
    <li> I wanted this Amber White oil in the bottle available in this particular bottle and am very pleased with it.&lt;br /&gt;Despite reviews of the oil being diluted, etc, I find it to be the same strength as the Nemat Amber White&lt;br /&gt;which I ordered from another vendor in smaller roll on bottles.&lt;br /&gt;The oil is very subtle but lasts quite a long time after being applied.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend both the seller and the Amber White I ordered.&lt;br /&gt;Am a repeat customer.</li>
    <li> It has absolutely no scent whatsoever!  I am so disappointed and spent less money on another amber product and received more oil that was absolutely fabulous...I was so disappointed in this product!</li>
    <li> this perfume is one of the best I&#x27;ve ever bought.</li>
    <li> This is the same oil that I but at Central Market. It&#x27;s getting hard to find as it gains popularity, so I&#x27;m thankful that Quality Goods has it in stock!</li>
    <li> After smelling this on a friend a few times I asked her what perfume she was wearing and she told me it was this Amber oil.  Oh my goodness, it smells so good!  She said she loved it because it &amp;#34;smelled like a hug&amp;#34; and I couldn&#x27;t have described it better myself.  This brand is great too, very authentic and pure.  Love it!</li>
    <li> 27 +7 &#x3D; 34% that is ONE THIRD of customers gave amber oil from Nemat 2 stars or less! I hope the seller is listening and stops buying amber oil from Nemat until it is a better product again. I bought from this seller in 2013 but waited this long because I had started buying from Nemat International themselves. In the mean time I had kept coming back to read customer reviews to see if they got any better. What I found out:&lt;br /&gt; The fragrance is STILL weakened, but same scent. It even had an underlying scent of vegetable oil that I could point out because the amber scent was faded or non-existent. In it&#x27;s original form, two drops or finger dabs of amber scent FILLED a room but never overpowered. My relative who is super sensitive to perfumes and never wore perfumes or oils, loved it! Despite the aromatic strength of the amber oil it did not bother her nose and could smell it through a crowd of people. No matter what size bottle, or how long the operator at Nemat tells you to wait for it to get stronger, it doesn&#x27;t. I even asked the operator to forward a message to people in charge, to raise the price but not weaken the scent. If it is a matter of making money, I would pay more for it. I could buy one of their other scents but it&#x27;s not amber and I don&#x27;t want to invest in other scents I may not like or may also be weak. Don&#x27;t blame the seller but Do not support this product. Only because almost one third of customers who knew about Nemat&#x27;s amber oil are waiting for it to come back to it&#x27;s original glory.&lt;br /&gt;Contact Nemat: toll free from USA or Canada :  1-800-936-3628&lt;br /&gt;From outside USA and Canada please call : 1-510-445-0300&lt;br /&gt;and their website: http://www.nematinternational.com/products/fragrances_essential_oils_absolute_retail/kohinoor_fragrances.php</li>
    <li> This perfume is exactly what I bought at Whole Foods years ago (and can no longer find at the whole foods in DC). The smell is of the same intensity so this seller (Nemat) is not cutting corners or lowering quality.  Love this perfume, so elegant!</li>
    <li> Tried to by this at whole foods in Austin, Texas but it was sold out.  Ordered it on amazon.  Wore it one day and it lasted over 24 hours.  Two days later I put it on again...no scent at all.  How does that happen?!  I am very disappointed and I am going to attempt to return it. We&#x27;ll see how that goes.</li>
    <li> couldn&#x27;t smell it on me, my coworker said it wasn&#x27;t the real product</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this!! It is a sublet yet intoxicating fragrance that smells different on each person.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t purchase this from this seller, but wanted to review the product from anyone who is considering buying this. I have smelled/sampled other scents by Nemat in the Taj Mahal series that they have, but have only purchased Amber as it totally stood out to me. The store I purchased it from closed and I waited years to actually buy it again but thought about it all the time. It&#x27;s such a beautiful, sweet, woodsy scent that you cannot overdo, in my honest opinion. As a woman, I feel feminine wearing this scent but it&#x27;s not girly-girly-knock-you-down-with-my-alcohol-flowers... yet I think a man could wear this as well. My husband is sensitive to perfume and says this does not bother him. My sister hates it, but my mother and I love it- so it&#x27;s possible to not like the smell and I believe it doesn&#x27;t work well with my sister&#x27;s body chemistry and it smells a bit different. I have never owned such a wonderful perfume and will probably never buy a different one for a looong time if ever. So I rate this stuff a full 5/5. Worth the risk of trying.</li>
    <li> I purchased this at central market in Austin. (First smelled it on someone at a grocery store and she showed me her bottle. Very small bottle)  Day after I purchased, I let both my husband and stepson take a whiff from bottle bc I couldn&#x27;t smell it...they said they couldn&#x27;t smell anything... Eh?? However, someone stopped me in store to ask me what I was wearing... Thinking about trying the smallest bottle, but they were out. Perhaps it&#x27;s not as watered down. So disappointed!</li>
    <li> I might as well use water.  It smelled great at first, and now there&#x27;s not even a fragrance.  I bought two other bottles, just to see if I had not correctly sealed the first.  This was a scent I&#x27;d been looking for.  I might as well use tap water.  NOT worth the trouble!</li>
    <li> Am very loyal to this product and as always I am always happy with how quick it arrives. I will only trust ordering from this particular stellar though because I have ordered from others in the past and theirs was a diluted version</li>
    <li> Smells so clean! However, as other comments have said, the scent is very subtle, but it &amp;#34;activates&amp;#34; at the strangest times, like when you come in contact with hot water or your body heat rises. Wish the smell wasnt so faint, but otherwise great!</li>
    <li> Little to no smell.  I&#x27;ve been purchasing this item for several years and do realize different strengths, however these were the weakest smelling amber oils I have ever purchased.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Respectfully&lt;br /&gt;Crickett</li>
    <li> my dear friend, kept commenting on how good i smelled. After 4 days of hearing this,&lt;br /&gt;I caved, I gave it to her.  Now I got to get me another one.  they are hard to keep in&lt;br /&gt;stock, but i will keep checking back with your store. Thanks for the FAST shipping.&lt;br /&gt;I love doing business here.</li>
    <li> Love love love this stuff!  Great shipper and everyone loves this smell!  I have purchased from this seller several times and am so happy with the Amber oil!  You really can&#x27;t water the stuff down as it is oil!  I get complimented on this oil literally EVERY time I wear it!!  When I do purchase I normally purchase 5 at a time.  So honestly try it the buyer is great and the oil is truly AMAZING!  You will not regret this purchase!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a side note I will say this oil is very light and I can&#x27;t really smell it on myself but Everyone else can!</li>
    <li> Love how this fragrance is subtle and not heavy. Not to mention, my name is Amber :).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I only wish it came with an applicator (I hate using my finger).</li>
    <li> I love this as a perfume oil.  I also love to put a few drops into water in a teakettle on the stove and let it waft through the house.  The whole house has a beatiful calming feel to it when there is amber mist in the air.  GREAT SERVICE too!  Got it fast!</li>
    <li> Great scent, I get tons of compliments on it.</li>
    <li> This is the only fragrance I receive compliments on frequently. Very clean and fresh</li>
    <li> Was very disappointed. There is barely a scent. I agree w/ the others who say this must have been watered down. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> I discovered the Nemat Amber fragrance oil through a friend. She got hers in Whole Foods store in Austin, TX. I used her oil and totally loved it, this scent is really unique and catches lots of attention. My friend&#x27;s Nemat Amber oil I used was very thick and lasted for two days even after shower!&lt;br /&gt;I live in New York and checked a couple of the Whole Food Stores but apparently they are not participating in Nemat products distribution. So the only way to get it was online.&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunatly the scent of the same Amber oil i got fades away in less than an hour. It&#x27;s very liquidish, as a result not economical at all. Looks like the manufacturer or distributor decided so save itself some money by generously diluting the oil with water... :( Not the best sales stragedy. Will never order from this distributor again... :/</li>
    <li> I used to buy this at Whole Foods all the time and was sad when my local store no longer carried it. I love the scent because it is great throughout the year and is never too heavy or musky.  If you&#x27;ve never smelled it, it is unlike other Amber scents out there.</li>
    <li> Like other reviewers, I smelled this on a friend fell in love with the fragrance and ordered it.  I received it yesterday, immediately opened the bottle and put some on and the fragrance lasted all night!  I put some on the very next day and noticed that the scent was much more faint than it was the day before.  About an hour later, I could hardly smell any of the fragrance on my skin so I went to put more on and to my surprise when I opened the bottle . . . the scent was COMPLETELY gone!  Yep, that&#x27;s right -- no smell at all! I don&#x27;t even know how that happens????  I  will never buy from this supplier again and Amazon needs to discontinue carrying their products.  I would give this product a negative star if I could!</li>
    <li> This is the perfect oil  to wear daily. Add it to any unscented lotion to last all day. My husband loves it!!</li>
    <li> I love the scent! People still ask me what I am wearing 10 hours into my shift, and I have not reapplied!</li>
    <li> Love this scent, I&#x27;ve used it before. It&#x27;s very powerful and lasts all day. I could sit down on a couch at a friend&#x27;s home and leave and they&#x27;ll comment that they could still smell it.  But this reseller sold me this scent twice and it either did not smell or was very very weak. I emailed the reseller and they flat out lied to me and said if I had a problem to contact Nemat directly. Boo!</li>
    <li> I would never wear anything else.  Apparently it last all day because at the end of my 10 hr shift the cleaning crew knows I&#x27;m there.  I&#x27;ve asked if  it is too much the answer is always no it&#x27;s perfect balance of fresh and just damn good!</li>
    <li> my favorite scent EVER!!!! lasts forever!</li>
    <li> I got introduced to this by a friend who would buy it at whole foods all the time, but online it is $4 less expensive and its 100% the same scent. Guys love it bc its a soft smell and kinda sexy before bed.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m allergic to perfumes and the smells give my migraines.&lt;br /&gt;This stuff smells amazing and doesn&#x27;t make me sick.&lt;br /&gt;Totally worth buying</li>
    <li> Should have checked the reviews first. Smell has dramatically decreased within a few days. I showed the bottle to someone who had never heard of it and she could barely even smell it when she put it on herself. Store bought versions are way more potent.</li>
    <li> this has probably been my favorite small that Nemat makes for EVVVVER.  people recognize me for this smell.  i usually have to find it at the grocery store that is way across town, so it&#x27;s awesome to find it it online.  i&#x27;ve kept it forever and it never goes rancid!</li>
    <li> I absolutely ADORE this scent, the problem is as most of the other customers described, older/other batches seem stronger than this one, and would last much longer. From what I understand, it was Nemat that decided to water down the scent, not the distributor. Which sucks, because this is my favorite oil... so it is the same smell, but requires many more applications throughout the day and doesn&#x27;t pack the same punch as before.</li>
