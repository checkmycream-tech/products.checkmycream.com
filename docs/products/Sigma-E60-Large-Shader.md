      <li>I like this brush because it is very soft.  </li>
      <li>, it is so easy to apply the eyeshadow now and it lets you do it fast, because it is big enough to cover your whole eyelid in a sec, thumbs up!!</li>
      <li>I wanted to use this brush with loose eyeshadow pigments and to wet the brush for more intensity of eyeshadow.</li>
      <li>Not only it was too large but there was a difference in length on the bristles.</li>
      <li>I compared it to my actual real ones I have from the actual sigma store.</li>
      <li>The cheap brush I used to use had a tendency to lay product on too thickly and inconsistently, so I&#x27;d have to spend a while blending out the areas that had picked up clumps.</li>

<li> I mean they are still pricey but not as bad and work amazing.</li>
<li> The picture is not accurate at all.</li>
<li> So upset this brush ended up being fake.</li>
<li> The paint pot is a creamy shadow base, that I use all over the lid.</li>
<li> blends cream eyeshadow base or primer onto lids.</li>
<li> So disappointed!</li>

    <li> So upset this brush ended up being fake. The picture is not accurate at all. You can feel it in the weight. I compared it to my actual real ones I have from the actual sigma store. So disappointed!</li>
    <li> very easy for quick one shade eyeshadow or other glam up dos</li>
    <li> I love this brush! I am able to put on quite a bit of my mac eye  shadows.  I will be purchasing more. In different sizes.</li>
    <li> The sigma brushes are wonderful, the finishes of the shadows and application of blush and powder is fantastic. The brushes are very soft and fluffy. I love all the brushes from Sigma and would not trade for any other brand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Whoever brushes good, the best is even Sigma.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Sigma brushes are very practical, lightweight, soft, and with a disgner very beautiful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recomendos all the girls that buy the products of Sigma, are very good and last a long time. What is fantastic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m in love for the products of Sigma.</li>
    <li> Love Sigma but I really love Amazon price!!!!!</li>
    <li> I wonder why I did not order this sigma brush before!, it is so easy to apply the eyeshadow now and it lets you do it fast, because it is big enough to cover your whole eyelid in a sec, thumbs up!!</li>
    <li> my daughter likes this</li>
    <li> Great brush.  Can be used for multiple application.</li>
    <li> I am using my husbands account. I love sigma brushes and I would recommend them to anyone. I have several!! I like them better then mac brushes.</li>
    <li> I like this brush because it is very soft.  I wanted to use this brush with loose eyeshadow pigments and to wet the brush for more intensity of eyeshadow. it picks up regular eyeshadow as well.</li>
    <li> I only give this brush 4 stars because I cannot speak what it does with powder shadow. I use it with the MAC paint pot and it applies this product wonderfully. The paint pot is a creamy shadow base, that I use all over the lid. This is a great brush and feel it will perform just as well with a powder base as well.</li>
    <li> I can honestly say that this brush is amazing! Its very versatile too! I use it to apply my eye primer, eye shadow bases, cream eye shadows, and pat on my eye pigments. The brush is just firm enough to apply my primers and bases, but soft enough not to scratch my eye lids! I can&#x27;t believe I waited this long to buy it!</li>
    <li> I love all my sigma brushes. This one is great for putting shadow all over the lid. Smooth application. Love it. Worth the price!!!</li>
    <li> What a huge difference a quality brush makes! I only use cream eye shadow and don&#x27;t do any elaborate looks, so I didn&#x27;t think I needed anything fancier than my cheap-ass e.l.f. eyeshadow brush, but I bought this one on a whim and fell in love with it at first use. The cheap brush I used to use had a tendency to lay product on too thickly and inconsistently, so I&#x27;d have to spend a while blending out the areas that had picked up clumps. With the Sigma brush, cream eyeshadow goes on perfectly smoothly and lightly. The finish is like skin with the softest wash of color. Perfect.</li>
    <li> its a little bigger than i wanted but it works</li>
    <li> Love this product but came damaged &#x3D;(</li>
    <li> This is the best shader brush in the whole wide world. That is all I have to say about it.</li>
    <li> This brush is awesome!!! It packs on alot of eye shadow!!! which is great!! It gives a great definition to the eyes!! Your eyes will definently pop!</li>
    <li> I love Sigma, always have and always will. The quality is good and it&#x27;s a cheaper alternative to MAC. Plus, the fur is much softer and it comes in many varieties of colors. I love how this eye shading brush is soft and it picks up a lot of color pigment. Definitely going to purchase more of Sigma products.</li>
    <li> I use it alot it help me to put eyeshadow in all my lid. and if you put some vasilene in the brush and than put eyeshadow and draw it in u face. it will be perfect. I recommeded for daily use</li>
    <li> Awesome brush! Soft bristles and applies the shadow nicely without flicking shadow all over.&lt;br /&gt;I have a few Sigma brushes and all them are worth the money!!!</li>
    <li> I use this brush to put on my eyelid shadows. Works well. Packs on the color and quickly. Must have from Sigma!</li>
    <li> I am a huge MAC person and I needed some new brushes and heard about this brand and so far I love it and will be buying more and the great thing is they are not as expensive as MAC I mean they are still pricey but not as bad and work amazing.</li>
    <li> JUST BUY ANY SIGMA BRUSH, YOU WONT REGRET IT. THEY ALL WORK GUD. I AM A HAPPY CUSTOMER AND I WILL BUY THESE AGAIN!!!!</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t like this brush at all. Not only it was too large but there was a difference in length on the bristles. Something about it was off and this brush did not look at all like the one I have seen on youtube or google. I am returning it.</li>
    <li> Amazing shadow brush for applying shadow all over the lid. It picks up a lot of pigment. Beautifully crafted brush and the bristles are very soft.</li>
    <li> blends cream eyeshadow base or primer onto lids. also works well for under eyebrow highlighting and application of primer onto the lower lash line.</li>
