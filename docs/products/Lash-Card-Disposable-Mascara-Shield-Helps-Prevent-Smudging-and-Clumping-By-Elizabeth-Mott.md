      <li>but it brings a lot more..</li>
      <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Removed 1 star because I wish they were a more plastic material.</li>
      <li>I love using Lash Card</li>
      <li>mascara looked so much better then without the card.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s me or the product, but I got more on both me and the card when using it than alone.  </li>
      <li>I love these.</li>
      <li>I had a habit of making on my lash lines AND my lashes even looked longer and more</li>
      <li>so* much better than what I was using</li>
      <li>pretty good product.  </li>
      <li>The lash card is easy to use and exceeded my expectations.  </li>
      <li>They work just fine</li>
      <li>I just think it would probably be more economical and earth friendly if I bought a plastic lash guard instead.</li>
      <li>this is very useful as a artist.</li>
      <li>I wipe clean with a wipe.</li>
      <li>Sturdy and nicely shaped, however I&#x27;m still trying to figure out how to use it, my eyes are very deep set, works on the bottom lashes just need to practice more.</li>
      <li>The lash card is a wish come true.  </li>
      <li>, it&#x27;s easy and convenient, and really helps!</li>
      <li>As I get older, it was harder to put mascara on and this just works great</li>
      <li>now theyre easy to use especially for someone like me who is bad at mascara application, great at keeping my eyelids clean of makeup residue and great at seperating my eyelashes and avoiding clmping when applying mascara.&lt;br</li>
      <li>this is a good product for avoiding a smear of black on the skin.</li>
      <li>Thanks Elizabeth Mott!</li>
      <li>I will definitely purchase more of these</li>
      <li>With it, I don&#x27;t need an eyelash curler--it really curls and separates lashes with no smudges!</li>
      <li>I can easily put on my mascara without getting any on my upper eyelids.</li>
      <li>The carboard bends easily and can be used daily for about 2 to 3 weeks before needing to replace it.</li>
      <li>I couldn&#x27;t be happier with this product and will certainly buy from Elizabeth Mott again.</li>
      <li>Makes putting on mascara and separating lashes so much easier.</li>
      <li>Thanks</li>
      <li>I found these to be very helpful.  </li>
      <li>really love using the plastic mascara guard compared to these because it&#x27;s a pain in the butt to hold a lash card in place above your eye with your left hand while you use your right hand to apply mascara.</li>
      <li>Handy little product!</li>
      <li>love these cards, they cut down my mascara application time</li>
      <li>She has been using them for almost a year now and had high praises for them.  </li>
      <li>My daughter and I both highly recommend these lash cars.</li>
      <li>but once you get the hang of it....very easy to use and helps cut down on the mascara that gets on eye lid and under eye.  </li>
      <li>This is a new staple in my make up bag.</li>
      <li>But I have to say that you can get pretty much the same results just using any old business card which is what I actually do when I&#x27;m doing someones makeup.</li>
      <li>I was a little unsure at first, but after using it, Lash Card really does make a difference!</li>
      <li>If it was a plastic type material that could be  cleaned regularly I would be much happier</li>
      <li>The thinness and white color of the cards is a real plus when applying mascara.  </li>
      <li>This product is pretty cool, I tried it on myself, my eyelashes are very small, it helped to stop mascara on my eyelid.  </li>
      <li>these are handy little gadgets; they are a tiny bit stiff, but I still will order them again...</li>
      <li>Like the other reviewer it also took me a little while to figure out how to use the card, like where exactly to put it on your eyelid, how much pressure to put, etc, but once I got the hang of it, it&#x27;s so easy.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I bought these because certain mascaras can be a little runny when applied.</li>

<li> I can have long thick under lashes without a mess.  </li>
<li> It was not comfortable and it didn&#x27;t work for the lower eyelashes.</li>
<li> The cards are thin enough to be used on your bottom lashes.</li>
<li> my plastic mascara guard gets gunked up with dried mascara and needs to be cleaned ever couple of weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> I received a few of these as part of an Ipsy glam bag subscription.</li>
<li> It is a little hard to get used to</li>
<li> no more having to wipe every time with a tissue.</li>
<li> No more clumps or ugly little black marks</li>
<li> I use to hate putting mascara on, and wouldn&#x27;t because I was so horrible at it....</li>
<li> The card fits at the base of my eyelashes and aids in separating each lash, no clumping!!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I like the lash card.  It is a little hard to get used to but once you get the hang of it....very easy to use and helps cut down on the mascara that gets on eye lid and under eye.  Would recommend.  I use the same one until it looses it shape.  I wipe clean with a wipe.</li>
    <li> Keeps me from getting mascara on my eyeshadow.</li>
    <li> I saw these cards on a make up artists YouTube channel and figured I&#x27;d give them a shot. Like the other reviewer it also took me a little while to figure out how to use the card, like where exactly to put it on your eyelid, how much pressure to put, etc, but once I got the hang of it, it&#x27;s so easy.&lt;br /&gt;My mascara looked so much better then without the card. No more clumps or ugly little black marks I had a habit of making on my lash lines AND my lashes even looked longer and more defined.&lt;br /&gt;I love these cards, they cut down my mascara application time and I don&#x27;t have to fiddle around with q-tips anymore and mess up my eye make up due to mascara marks. This is a new staple in my make up bag.</li>
    <li> I love these. Have been using them for some time now theyre easy to use especially for someone like me who is bad at mascara application, great at keeping my eyelids clean of makeup residue and great at seperating my eyelashes and avoiding clmping when applying mascara.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Removed 1 star because I wish they were a more plastic material. The carboard bends easily and can be used daily for about 2 to 3 weeks before needing to replace it. If it was a plastic type material that could be  cleaned regularly I would be much happier</li>
    <li> pretty good product.  If you hold the card BEHIND the lashes and push slightly back against the lid, it will cause the lashes to go straight against the card and you can brush the mascara wand onto the lashes without getting it on you skin.  The only negative is that the lashes don&#x27;t pick up as much product, so they don&#x27;t look as thick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But this is a good product for avoiding a smear of black on the skin.</li>
    <li> what a great item, so much better than a business card!!</li>
    <li> My only issue is I wish it didn&#x27;t feel like a board against my cheek or eye. I have a tendency to push but tape works best for side shadowing but for lashes to keep mascara off is good for this. It&#x27;s strategic but can be done. I could see especially for beginners or clients. Could find multiple uses for this.</li>
    <li> this is very useful as a artist. it helps prevent mascara getting on your work and speed up mascara application because your not worried about getting it on the eyeshadow... also i thought it brng one but it brings a lot more..</li>
    <li> i love this product because it helps to give me the look that i want for my lashes without any smudges.  i don&#x27;t have to worry about having to worry about any of my mascara smudging all over my eyes.</li>
    <li> These are handy to get mascara on all the way to the end of my eyelashes. The downside is that the curve is narrower than the whole width of my eye and it would be expensive if you used only one then threw it away as intended because they are thick paper.</li>
    <li> Work *so* much better than what I was using (piece of cardboard). I can easily put on my mascara without getting any on my upper eyelids.</li>
    <li> The lash card is easy to use and exceeded my expectations.  The thinness and white color of the cards is a real plus when applying mascara.  The card fits at the base of my eyelashes and aids in separating each lash, no clumping!!</li>
    <li> Handy little product!</li>
    <li> Sturdy and nicely shaped, however I&#x27;m still trying to figure out how to use it, my eyes are very deep set, works on the bottom lashes just need to practice more.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t believe I fell for these. It looks like they should work great, but in reality, they just don&#x27;t. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend them to anyone.</li>
    <li> I bought these because certain mascaras can be a little runny when applied. They work just fine and I can use one a number of times before having to grab another. I just think it would probably be more economical and earth friendly if I bought a plastic lash guard instead. But I do not regret the purchase.</li>
    <li> I thought this was a reusuable plastic card, it&#x27;s not. Save your money and just use business cards or make your own.</li>
    <li> Great purchase. Place the card under or above your lid, let the card get the over flow of mascara rather than the master piece you just finished.</li>
    <li> I have tried using these several times. I did not find it very easy to maneuver the card and the mascara together.</li>
    <li> these are handy little gadgets; they are a tiny bit stiff, but I still will order them again... numerous uses per card, and numerous uses FOR the cards in various eye makeup applications!&lt;br /&gt;received VERY promptly and in perfect condition.</li>
    <li> Great product. Keeps mascara from getting on eyelid. This is now a morning staple. I will definitely purchase more of these</li>
    <li> My daughter actually recommended these lash cards to me.  She has been using them for almost a year now and had high praises for them.  I agree, they are great to use when applying mascara to both the top and bottom lashes. It keeps the mascara from smearing onto your eye lids and under your eyes. My daughter and I both highly recommend these lash cars.</li>
    <li> these cards are a wonderful idea, and they do exactly what they&#x27;re supposed to do. But I have to say that you can get pretty much the same results just using any old business card which is what I actually do when I&#x27;m doing someones makeup.</li>
    <li> This product is pretty cool, I tried it on myself, my eyelashes are very small, it helped to stop mascara on my eyelid.  would purchase again.</li>
    <li> This is okay for what it is used for. The cards are thin enough to be used on your bottom lashes.</li>
    <li> Item came on time, n it&#x27;s great keeps any smudges out of you lids etc. no more having to wipe every time with a tissue. Thanks</li>
    <li> This is great in concept, but in actuality, it did not work that well for me.  I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s me or the product, but I got more on both me and the card when using it than alone.  The other thing that I didn&#x27;t like is that these are supposed to be single use-- I&#x27;d rather have something that I could wipe off with makeup remover or otherwise wash than just a one time use product that is meant to be thrown away.</li>
    <li> Very satisfied with the Lash Card.  Makes a big difference in my lashes.  Makes them thicker and longer looking!</li>
    <li> I use to hate putting mascara on, and wouldn&#x27;t because I was so horrible at it....then I was a Screen Actors Guild and saw this product in one of the SAG swag bags. Love it!!</li>
    <li> I love these! Makes putting on mascara and separating lashes so much easier. I tried making my own, but the homemade card doesn&#x27;t work as well as these.</li>
    <li> I do believe this is a great product, but I have not, as yet, had time to experiment with it.</li>
    <li> As I get older, it was harder to put mascara on and this just works great&lt;br /&gt;For me, I love it!</li>
    <li> This is great! I love using Lash Card, it&#x27;s easy and convenient, and really helps! I was a little unsure at first, but after using it, Lash Card really does make a difference! Love love love it!</li>
    <li> HOW did I make it 33 years with OUT these?! I love them! gives you full, beautiful lashes with zero clumps and zero getting it on your eyelids and then having to try to smudge it off without messing up your mascara!</li>
    <li> I have never heard of or used a &amp;#34;lash card&amp;#34; before, but this one is great! With it, I don&#x27;t need an eyelash curler--it really curls and separates lashes with no smudges! Thanks Elizabeth Mott!</li>
    <li> All this time I have been q-tipping under my bottom lashes because the mascara gets all over the place.  I found these to be very helpful.  I can have long thick under lashes without a mess.  I would buy them again and I would recommend</li>
    <li> The lash card is a wish come true.  I couldn&#x27;t be happier with this product and will certainly buy from Elizabeth Mott again.</li>
    <li> I received a few of these as part of an Ipsy glam bag subscription. At the time I had just purchased a plastic mascara guard that has a handle that you hold below your eye while the guard part reaches around your eyelid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really love using the plastic mascara guard compared to these because it&#x27;s a pain in the butt to hold a lash card in place above your eye with your left hand while you use your right hand to apply mascara. I ended up giving these cards away and stick with using my plastic guard. The only advantage of these cards is they are disposable so you don&#x27;t have to worry about cleaning-- my plastic mascara guard gets gunked up with dried mascara and needs to be cleaned ever couple of weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend the plastic guard over this. I bought one on Amazon for $1.45 shipped. Search for &amp;#34;Upper Lower Lash Mascara Applicator Guide Eyelash Comb&amp;#34; by a seller named uxcell.</li>
    <li> I tried this product and I didn&#x27;t like it.  It was not comfortable and it didn&#x27;t work for the lower eyelashes.</li>
    <li> I am using these while dying lashes.  Only helps a little bit.  I still have &amp;#34;clean up&amp;#34; with q tip to avoid staining.</li>
