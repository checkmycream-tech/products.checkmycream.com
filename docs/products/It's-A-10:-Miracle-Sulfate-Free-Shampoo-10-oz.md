      <li>There&#x27;s NO sulfates in it which translates into a much better product for your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I have used before and found on amazon for a much better price than at walgreen&#x27;s or salons - love how it works with my hair....</li>
      <li>Price is right too!!</li>
      <li>I was excited to get this product because I love all their conditioners.</li>
      <li>love this shampoo, it makes your hair feel clean and light.</li>
      <li>I have fine hair and it makes it shiny.  </li>
      <li>I had first heard about it before from my best friends stylist and he highly recommended it, but I didn&#x27;t think much about purchasing it.&lt;br</li>
      <li>My hairstylist suggested I use a sulfate free shampoo to try to control frizz.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I went to walmart salon thinking it was just a cheap product...</li>
      <li>Leaves hair so soft and smells so good</li>
      <li>It made my hair feel clean</li>
      <li>becuase the salons are so far away, but I wasn&#x27;t pleased with the Shampoo or Conditioner.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s my new favorite and beats out Pureology (which is pretty awesome).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
      <li>I like the results, but I don&#x27;t care for how much I have to use to feel like my hair is clean.</li>
      <li>I like my shampoo to lather (I know that not all shampoos need to lather, but I&#x27;m &amp;#34;old-school.&amp;#34;).  </li>
      <li>and that&#x27;s it exactly.  </li>
      <li>It is a real 10!.</li>
      <li>It makes my hair super soft and silky.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m a big fan of Pureology with Enjoy as a backup.</li>
      <li>It also smelled really nice!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Thanks</li>
      <li>Ironic that directions say &#x27;massage into a rich lather&#x27; because this shampoo barely lathers at all and doesn&#x27;t really feel as if it&#x27;s getting your hair clean, although it actually does.  </li>
      <li>However, it does not work any better on my hair than many previous products that were less than 1/2 the price of this.  </li>
      <li>I had high hopes for the shampoo.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this product.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m giving it 4 star because though it is making my hair shiny and beautiful, the bottle&#x27;s small and not exactly inexpensive.</li>
      <li>and I have super long hair.</li>
      <li>and it had a warning about sun exposure (I live in a sunny city).</li>
      <li>My local beauty store didn&#x27;t carry Enjoy anymore, and I asked for something different.  </li>
      <li>When I first got this, I was prepared to say that &#x27;It&#x27;s a 10&#x27; should be called &#x27;It&#x27;s a 2&#x27;, but I decided to keep using it - especially after what I paid for this stuff!  </li>
      <li>First wash, hair was left so soft, that&#x27;s before conditioning!</li>
      <li>I kept adding more to my hair, but it had a slick, brassy feel, rather than a soft, smoothy silky feel.  </li>
      <li>I really believe that this isn&#x27;t even the same product.  </li>
      <li>after a month of using this shampoo and conditioner... wow...</li>
      <li>just wow.</li>
      <li>Cause it leaves it soft.</li>
      <li>My hair, just finished this bottle, is now COMPLETELY back to normal and restored all moisture back to my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

<li> The shampoo was a let down as it barely lathers, and doesn&#x27;t feel like it cleans my hair.</li>
<li> Just remember this shampoo will not lather like a normal shampoo because it is missing the ingredients that causes other shampoos to lather since those ingredients can damage your hair.</li>
<li> It is no different than any other shampoo.  </li>
<li> I suffer from dry itchy scalp</li>
<li> My complaint, besides the high price is that it makes my scalp itch.  </li>
<li> hair is 5 inches bellow my shoulder, black, mixed thickness with frizz.</li>
<li> There&#x27;s no way any of you guys had worse hair than I did, I really thought about shaving my head so to save me to stress and time of my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> When I first used it, I thought I&#x27;d received a bad bottle, but after checking online, I saw that it doesn&#x27;t lather.  </li>
<li> My hair is long and thin and does not seem to shampoo my hair evenly.  </li>
<li> it helped me drastically be able to comb my hair after i did that terrible straightening system.</li>
<li> so I&#x27;m not absolutely sure</li>
<li> Not too heavy!</li>
<li> it&#x27;s mediocre performance and inflated price, I will definitely NOT be purchasing it again.</li>
<li> i have really thick and a lot of hair.....</li>
<li> This product isn&#x27;t so bad that I threw it out, but it is a product I use only when I need to because I&#x27;ve run out of my preferred shampoo (It&#x27;s a 10 Miracle Silk Shampoo).</li>
<li> so it seems like i gotta use 1/2 the bottle which is not good for the wallet.  </li>
<li> it&#x27;s just never a good look for</li>
<li> /&gt;Recently, I got tired of the Seborrheic Dermatitis on my scalp and started doing some research on shampoos to help my scalp.</li>

    <li> Makes my hair sooo happy!</li>
    <li> It is a real 10!. You won&#x27;t regret to turn into these products. My hair is so healthy and shiny now.</li>
    <li> Still on the fence on thing one.</li>
    <li> My hairstylist suggested I use a sulfate free shampoo to try to control frizz.  I do see some difference using this product.  It has an nice smell.  Just remember this shampoo will not lather like a normal shampoo because it is missing the ingredients that causes other shampoos to lather since those ingredients can damage your hair.</li>
    <li> I was excited to get this product because I love all their conditioners. The shampoo was a let down as it barely lathers, and doesn&#x27;t feel like it cleans my hair.</li>
    <li> great he do me good one like nobody else do good ones. maybe he can gve more a good deals !</li>
    <li> For those who say that it doesn&#x27;t lather...so what? Who said shampoo has to lather in order to do a great job cleaning your hair? I suffer from dry itchy scalp and I have super long hair. I just starting using this shampoo two weeks ago and I love it! It makes my hair super soft and silky.</li>
    <li> i have really thick and a lot of hair.....so it seems like i gotta use 1/2 the bottle which is not good for the wallet.  however i love the smell and the lightness it adds to my hair</li>
    <li> First wash, hair was left so soft, that&#x27;s before conditioning! Love it&#x27;s a 10 ten products! Will definitely buy again!</li>
    <li> I bought this a salon because i tried a straightening system by  bio ionic.. what u can image the WORST hair possible was my results. my hair was falling out. 6 inches were chopped off so i didnt have to go BALD.  I was angry and sad because I hate short hair on me. it&#x27;s just never a good look for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I went to walmart salon thinking it was just a cheap product...nope.. I was desperate and looking for ANY sort of improvement. after a month of using this shampoo and conditioner... wow...just wow. My hair stopped falling out and It started to feel like HAIR again and not hay. My hair, just finished this bottle, is now COMPLETELY back to normal and restored all moisture back to my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;GET THE LEAVE-IN PRODUCT!!! it was AMAZING. it helped me drastically be able to comb my hair after i did that terrible straightening system. seriously!! There&#x27;s no way any of you guys had worse hair than I did, I really thought about shaving my head so to save me to stress and time of my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;this product is a 10!!!</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t like it. Shampoo didn&#x27;t make no bubbles felt like I was washing hair with just water. Never again. :(</li>
    <li> It makes your hair nice and soft - and it looks healthy!!!  I would def buy again!! Price is right too!!</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t suds, but that is OK, just an observation.  My complaint, besides the high price is that it makes my scalp itch.  My teenage granddaughter likes it, however.</li>
    <li> When I first got this, I was prepared to say that &#x27;It&#x27;s a 10&#x27; should be called &#x27;It&#x27;s a 2&#x27;, but I decided to keep using it - especially after what I paid for this stuff!  Now several weeks later I am prepared to say &#x27;It&#x27;s a 5&#x27;.  Ironic that directions say &#x27;massage into a rich lather&#x27; because this shampoo barely lathers at all and doesn&#x27;t really feel as if it&#x27;s getting your hair clean, although it actually does.  However, it does not work any better on my hair than many previous products that were less than 1/2 the price of this.  Given it&#x27;s mediocre performance and inflated price, I will definitely NOT be purchasing it again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a big fan of Pureology with Enjoy as a backup. My local beauty store didn&#x27;t carry Enjoy anymore, and I asked for something different.  She recommended It&#x27;s a 10 and that&#x27;s it exactly.  It&#x27;s my new favorite and beats out Pureology (which is pretty awesome).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those that like a lather, you won&#x27;t get it with this product. You&#x27;re not supposed to.  There&#x27;s NO sulfates in it which translates into a much better product for your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe It&#x27;s a 10 isn&#x27;t for everyone, but it&#x27;s a 10 is for me!</li>
    <li> Great! Love this product. Keeps hair healthy and shiny.. Such a great feeling for my hair! Thanks it&#x27;s a 10!</li>
    <li> best shampoo for fine, gray hair.  gives it shine, texture and has a pleasant smell.</li>
    <li> Works great!  Love It&#x27;s a 10 products.</li>
    <li> I have used before and found on amazon for a much better price than at walgreen&#x27;s or salons - love how it works with my hair....and my hair is color treated so I can go a good tnree months using this shampoo before having to get color again.</li>
    <li> My hair is long and thin and does not seem to shampoo my hair evenly.  Although I know detergents are harmful to your hair, I like a shampoo that suds up somewhat.  This does not.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t even tell you why but this product has improved the condition of my hair and made it more manageable.&lt;br /&gt;Love this product and the leave in spray made by It&#x27;s a 10.</li>
    <li> A very good shampoo but nothing earth shattering. I would not recommend this, it is slightly above a 5 in ascale of 1-10</li>
    <li> I work in a nursing  home and my patient is a hair dresser and she told me about miracle 10 and it works</li>
    <li> I highly recommend this product.  I have fine hair and it makes it shiny.  I use the daily spray in conditioner which is a perfect combination.  Not too heavy!</li>
    <li> An excellent shampoo very good for your hair.  I also like the &amp;#34;It&#x27;s a 10&amp;#34; conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been a devoted user of these products for several years now.</li>
    <li> Nice, now gotta get more products like these</li>
    <li> I love It&#x27;s a 10 shampoo and conditioner.  I&#x27;ve always bought them from the Salon and the fragrance is awesome and the feel on the hair is soft and silky.  I decided to buy the product online this tiime becuase the salons are so far away, but I wasn&#x27;t pleased with the Shampoo or Conditioner.  They had no smell or fragrance at all.  The product just smelled like plastic.  Also, the feel of it wasn&#x27;t pleasant.  I kept adding more to my hair, but it had a slick, brassy feel, rather than a soft, smoothy silky feel.  I really believe that this isn&#x27;t even the same product.  I won&#x27;t buy online again!  I there&#x27;s a reason why brands will only guarantee their product if bought in a salon!</li>
    <li> I like the results, but I don&#x27;t care for how much I have to use to feel like my hair is clean. But! It is clean, and it looks great!</li>
    <li> I bought this product about a week ago (not from Amazon). I had first heard about it before from my best friends stylist and he highly recommended it, but I didn&#x27;t think much about purchasing it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recently, I got tired of the Seborrheic Dermatitis on my scalp and started doing some research on shampoos to help my scalp. I have used T-Gel before (Walgreen&#x27;s brand) and it worked awesomely, though I thought the smell was a bit chemically and it had a warning about sun exposure (I live in a sunny city). I saw a YouTube review on this shampoo by someone with Seborrheic and it seemed to be working well for them, so I figured why not give it a try?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair is 5 inches bellow my shoulder, black, mixed thickness with frizz. I&#x27;ve only used it twice so I&#x27;m not absolutely sure how well it is helping my scalp, but I have gotten  compliments from my friends! They described my hair as shiny and smooth--I was quite pleased that someone can see the difference! This shampoo does not lather, but I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve tried a sulfate-free shampoo that does. It also smelled really nice!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m giving it 4 star because though it is making my hair shiny and beautiful, the bottle&#x27;s small and not exactly inexpensive. I know there&#x27;s a bigger bottle, so if I decided to buy this again, I will try and invest my money in that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;--adds moisture&lt;br /&gt;--adds shine&lt;br /&gt;--smell fantastic&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;--small bottle&lt;br /&gt;--pricey for bottle size&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this product!</li>
    <li> I loved this product and would recommend it to everyone.  It made my hair feel clean and it is sulfate free which is amazing.</li>
    <li> Just okay.  I had high hopes for the shampoo. It is no different than any other shampoo.  My hair reacts the same.  Mildly disappointed.  I will not buy again.</li>
    <li> This was counterfeit. It had something that smelled like house cleaning chemicals in it and was completely watered down. The pump was broken. The price was too good to be true. Never again. ZERO STARS</li>
    <li> Love it !! Leaves hair so soft and smells so good and I always have to have conditioner but with this shampoo you don&#x27;t  even have to use some! Cause it leaves it soft.</li>
    <li> love this shampoo, it makes your hair feel clean and light.</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo and Amazon has a great price on it.  My hair feels and looks healthy and beautiful and it smells wonderful.</li>
    <li> I love most of the It&#x27;s a 10 products I&#x27;ve tried or use, but sad to say... not this one.  I like my shampoo to lather (I know that not all shampoos need to lather, but I&#x27;m &amp;#34;old-school.&amp;#34;).  When I first used it, I thought I&#x27;d received a bad bottle, but after checking online, I saw that it doesn&#x27;t lather.  Also, I love the smells of It&#x27;s a 10 products, but this one does not appeal to me.  It almost has a plastic smell to it.  This product isn&#x27;t so bad that I threw it out, but it is a product I use only when I need to because I&#x27;ve run out of my preferred shampoo (It&#x27;s a 10 Miracle Silk Shampoo).</li>
    <li> i use the shampoo and when i got my hair cut i ask for them to use the its a 10 shampoo and i loved it so know i have both and i love it</li>
