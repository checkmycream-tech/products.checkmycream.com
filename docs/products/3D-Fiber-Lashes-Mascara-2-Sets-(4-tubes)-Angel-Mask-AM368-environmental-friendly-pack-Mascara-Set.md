    <li> I purchased this item because I cant put on fake eye lashes to save my life. I saw my co worker demo Younique 3D fiber lashes and I loved the product but did not want to spend that much $$. I found this as an alternate and it works just as well.</li>
    <li> I have tried the younique brand and liked how they made my eyes look, however the price wasn&#x27;t favorable for my budget. After searching for a bit I thought I&#x27;d give these a try.  Very impressed.  Last all day. Wash off easily.  Will definitely be purchasing again.</li>
    <li> DOESNT OWN UP TO WHAT IT SAYS, DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s pretty good, not as good as the Younique brand, but it is so much cheaper and I&#x27;m happy with it.</li>
    <li> Worked better than my normal mascara, but not CRAZY good. shipping was very fast for me, but just make sure to follow the instructions amazon gives so fiber doesn&#x27;t get in your eye! In the picture the left is normal mascara the right is the fiber mascara.</li>
    <li> i don&#x27;t understand why this product has no reviews</li>
    <li> I  am very disappointed in this product. the fibers in the second tube were so dry I couldn&#x27;t use it. my sister bought this same product and hers worked great.  I was so impressed with the way hers looked I had to buy it myself.</li>
    <li> Love it! will purchase again!</li>
    <li> Works great. Haven&#x27;t used any other 3D mascara to compare it. The only problem I have is some of the lash fibers fall under my eyes and I have to make sure I wipe them off before going anywhere.</li>
    <li> NOPE... Save your money.</li>
    <li> I tried to like this product. Followed the instructional videos for all the Fiber Lashes/ This product actually does weird things to the very tips of my lashes. It makes a little FAN on the tip of each lash, like the eyelash has fingers on the top. I have tried this on two separate days and it it did it both of the times.</li>
    <li> Loved it and thanks for such fast shipping. Wokeup with my eyelashes fulllllllll to the max. I love this product.</li>
    <li> I received this it had big chunks in it got it in my eye took about 4 days for my eye to get better threw all of it away.</li>
    <li> Added volume and length. Was pleased with purchase.</li>
    <li> This product worked wonders!  It really does make you look like you&#x27;re wearing false lashes!  Love it!  Well worth the money!</li>
    <li> burnt my eyes and fibers were all over my face.</li>
    <li> You get what you pay for.  Fiber to extend lashes flakes off &amp; gets into my eyes.</li>
    <li> I was expecting a lot more volume and length. It does add a little bit of length, but my eyelashes look very &amp;#34;stringy&amp;#34; and thin :( i was expecting &amp;#34;false eye lashes, DANG GIRL! amazingness...&amp;#34; but unfortunantly, i received, an &amp;#34;ehhhh, nothing special&amp;#34; experience. -</li>
    <li> Works good.  Gave 3 stars because shipping took FOREVER</li>
    <li> Fast shipping love them, very easy to apply which is good because they came with no instructions I liked them so much I ordered some for a friend. You have the look of transplants or fakes, I had to lady&#x27;s at a salon look and they both couldn&#x27;t believe it was so easy,</li>
    <li> Great product, makes my eyelashes seem fuller and longer.</li>
