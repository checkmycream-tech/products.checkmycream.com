      <li>This is a very good product made by L&#x27;Oreal.  </li>
      <li>great product.</li>
      <li>Might still be a good color combi for me.  </li>
      <li>Even the cheapy $1 Elf brushes give good color payoff with this shadow.  </li>
      <li>I use them on my brides and they look good on ANY complexion.</li>
      <li>very pretty its very easy to use on my eyes and directions how to apply thats great and its awesome</li>

      <li>So nice and good service</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t take very much product to achieve the perfect look.  </li>
      <li>I love them!</li>
      <li>I would also recommend ditching the applicator in the compact and using your own brushes.  </li>
      <li>But, for the most bang for your buck, use a good shadow primer.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s velvety soft and applies perfectly, yet blends exceptionally well.  </li>
      <li>This is my favorite eye shadow, and I was so glad to find it here when they stopped selling it at the WalMart I use!  </li>
      <li>price was too good to be true..</li>
      <li>apart that the product is ok</li>
      <li>I had to buy two of these just to make sure that I never run out</li>
      <li>Love it.</li>
      <li>The magic have returned to my eyes.</li>
      <li>Its a must buy. :-)</li>
      <li>The colors go on a bit subdued and more neutral for a day look if applied alone</li>
      <li>I recommend it 100% for all those who are willing to look stunning!</li>
      <li>All four shades play perfectly off each other and create a fabulous look.  </li>
      <li>so I know what a good product this is very soft feeling on and</li>
      <li>Others might find that important, though.</li>
      <li>This Item is excellent in terms of quality raw materials and</li>
      <li>This shadow makes your eyes stand out in a very peculiar way, any woman can be sure that if you are using the shadows of L&#x27;Oreal will have a fresh look at the most comfortable price.</li>
      <li>getting it at my local store would have been a couple of more dollars more, so its cheaper on here.</li>
      <li>The colors really come alive and they wear like iron for a good 16 hours with no fading or creasing.  </li>
      <li>It also stays very well!</li>
      <li>lol gland its small enough to fit in my mailbox or</li>
      <li>I saw rich, vibrant, un-cracked colors in a brand new package.</li>
      <li>Real</li>
      <li>(Fy1, if you have brown eyes, it really makes them POP)</li>
      <li>I am not convinced I received the real product..</li>
      <li>and they last a good 6 to 8 hours before they begin to fade on my oily lids with minimal creasing.  </li>
      <li>I have used all four MAC shades, but I have to say that the colors in the L&#x27;Oreal quad actually blend a bit better and apply equally as rich as the more expensive MAC shades.  </li>
      <li>A tad bit lighter but pretty much the same</li>
      <li>the colors are pretty much the same color when you apply it to your skin.</li>
      <li>the pinkish color on the bottom is a plumy mauve, and the dark color is a deep, rich blackened plum full of red and purple shimmery flecks.  </li>
      <li>&#x27;n Wild trio.  </li>
      <li>I recieved the product like it was used and old.</li>
      <li>Beauty Marked,</li>
      <li>All four colors are richly pigmented and are dead on dupes for MAC shadows in the shades</li>
      <li>This product cam early it still says I will receive it next week on Tuesday</li>
      <li>I managed to snag this product for $3, so it really was about the same price as a Wet</li>

    <li> This is a very good product made by L&#x27;Oreal.  Was very pleased with the combination of colors.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure what the pigmentation is like on the other colors of this shadow line, but the Lavender Smokes shadow quad has excellent pigmentation.  It&#x27;s velvety soft and applies perfectly, yet blends exceptionally well.  The product picture is a little off and depicts it as darker than it truly is.  In reality, the lightest color is a creamy gold, the shadow beside it is a coppery taupe, the pinkish color on the bottom is a plumy mauve, and the dark color is a deep, rich blackened plum full of red and purple shimmery flecks.  All four are shimmery finishes.  All four colors are richly pigmented and are dead on dupes for MAC shadows in the shades Beauty Marked, All That Glitters, Wood Winked, and Pink Venus.  I have used all four MAC shades, but I have to say that the colors in the L&#x27;Oreal quad actually blend a bit better and apply equally as rich as the more expensive MAC shades.  It doesn&#x27;t take very much product to achieve the perfect look.  All four shades play perfectly off each other and create a fabulous look.  The colors go on a bit subdued and more neutral for a day look if applied alone and they last a good 6 to 8 hours before they begin to fade on my oily lids with minimal creasing.  But, for the most bang for your buck, use a good shadow primer.  The colors really come alive and they wear like iron for a good 16 hours with no fading or creasing.  I would also recommend ditching the applicator in the compact and using your own brushes.  Even the cheapy $1 Elf brushes give good color payoff with this shadow.  I managed to snag this product for $3, so it really was about the same price as a Wet &#x27;n Wild trio.  However, the quality difference is worlds apart.  I&#x27;m beyond pleased with this product, but the applicator is horrible and the packaging itself could be better.  But, I&#x27;m not buying it for the packaging or applicator, so it&#x27;s irrelevant to me.  Others might find that important, though.</li>
    <li> shimmery despite appearances in pics</li>
    <li> A tad bit lighter but pretty much the same so this product will not disappoint, I bought this brand plenty of times at my local store so I know what a good product this is very soft feeling on and the colors are pretty much the same color when you apply it to your skin. getting it at my local store would have been a couple of more dollars more, so its cheaper on here. This product cam early it still says I will receive it next week on Tuesday but I got it Friday and today&#x27;s Saturday. lol gland its small enough to fit in my mailbox or else I would of been mad if I seen this package outside my door especially because I live in an apartment complex and people steal.</li>
    <li> very pretty its very easy to use on my eyes and directions how to apply thats great and its awesome</li>
    <li> I thought the darker color was black. But it is a deep violet.  Might still be a good color combi for me.  Will update when I use.</li>
    <li> I am not convinced I received the real product..colors are not as shown on the picture..I applied it and it just came up all dark..like midnight smoky eyeshadow!!!..price was too good to be true..Beware!!</li>
    <li> I had to buy two of these just to make sure that I never run out (Loreal doesn&#x27;t seem to make them anymore). I use them on my brides and they look good on ANY complexion. Being from Barbados where the heat fades EVERYTHING, this eyeshadow stands up to humidity, heat,... great product. PLEASE DO NOT STOP MAKING IT!</li>
    <li> The colors were darker on the skin than shown in the picture and were not in the same places as in the picture. I still like the colors though.</li>
    <li> I received it all ruined and somehow broke and would be more expensive retorn it than to keep it. apart that the product is ok</li>
    <li> I love them! This shadow makes your eyes stand out in a very peculiar way, any woman can be sure that if you are using the shadows of L&#x27;Oreal will have a fresh look at the most comfortable price. Thank you Central Beauty! The magic have returned to my eyes. I recommend it 100% for all those who are willing to look stunning!</li>
    <li> So nice and good service</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t match the picture at all, but I purchased this once before at Walgreens so I already knew what the colors looked like. When I received it in the mail, I was expected to see faded, cracked colors, boy was I wrong. I saw rich, vibrant, un-cracked colors in a brand new package. I always get compliments on my when I where this. (Fy1, if you have brown eyes, it really makes them POP) Its a must buy. :-)</li>
    <li> Love it. Wish it was still sold at Walgreens</li>
    <li> This is my favorite eye shadow, and I was so glad to find it here when they stopped selling it at the WalMart I use!  Perfect for my smokey eyes. It also stays very well!</li>
    <li> I recieved the product like it was used and old.</li>
    <li> This Item is excellent in terms of quality raw materials and Real I&#x27;m very happy to buy that commodity</li>
