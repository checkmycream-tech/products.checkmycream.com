      <li>It seems to offend no one and delight many.</li>
      <li>Amazon is the only place i have been able to find this awesome smelling cologne!</li>
      <li>This product has a refreshing smell and it is not perfumy at all.</li>
      <li>I started using it perhaps 8 years ago when I was assisting a Japanese company in their efforts to distribute a magnificent line of skin care products to the U.S.  A very good chum of mine who was credited with startilng the car stereo business in this country asked me to assist him in helping a Japanese cosmetic company introduce their line here in the states</li>
      <li>It is an excellent cologne for the active man.</li>
      <li>It just smells like strong cheap cologne.</li>
      <li>It smells clean, but it doesn&#x27;t smell like the rest of their products, which is what I was hoping for.</li>
      <li>2 stars because it would be good for a middle school boy trying to pick up chicks.</li>
      <li>Shipped quickly.  </li>
      <li>Hard to find item at a great price.  </li>
      <li>Exactly what I wanted.</li>
      <li>I have missed it so much!</li>
      <li>Smells great but very muted and doesn&#x27;t last long at all.</li>
      <li>Spry on bottle could be a little more user friendly but not a deal breaker at any price....</li>
      <li>Had a smaller bottle of this and loved it so much I bought the bigger bottle.&lt;br /&gt;Smells just like Lazarro Chrome</li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t really smell like the hair care products at all.</li>
      <li>and I really like it.  </li>
      <li>I would highly recommend it.</li>
      <li>I  was hoping it was the original since it is hard to find now...</li>

    <li> I blindly bought this cologne because I use many American Crew products and figured I&#x27;d give it shot. To say the least, I was disappointed.    The longevity in this is terrible, the scent doesn&#x27;t even last an hour.   It doesn&#x27;t project well either, I can&#x27;t even smell it on myself sometimes.  The scent is woody, a very common scent.    There are way better fragrances out there!</li>
    <li> Hard to find item at a great price.  This is all my boyfriend will wear.  Shipped quickly.  A+++</li>
    <li> This product has a refreshing smell and it is not perfumy at all. It is an excellent cologne for the active man.</li>
    <li> The product must be bad.  It smells terrible.</li>
    <li> Great scent and good price!  compared to department store prices!  Spry on bottle could be a little more user friendly but not a deal breaker at any price....</li>
    <li> Smells good, and meets my budget.</li>
    <li> Had a smaller bottle of this and loved it so much I bought the bigger bottle.&lt;br /&gt;Smells just like Lazarro Chrome</li>
    <li> I started using it perhaps 8 years ago when I was assisting a Japanese company in their efforts to distribute a magnificent line of skin care products to the U.S.  A very good chum of mine who was credited with startilng the car stereo business in this country asked me to assist him in helping a Japanese cosmetic company introduce their line here in the states and I accidently tried this fragrance while calling on a company and that was it. I was hooked. It seems to offend no one and delight many. My wife and her friends all delight when I come strolling up at a party and give them a whiff. It&#x27;s well priced and the packaging is rilght on. So that said, I like it and will continue dazzling my wife and her friends..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Raul Balderas</li>
    <li> Smells great but very muted and doesn&#x27;t last long at all. Bought it for my husband and had to put my nose all the way to his neck to smell it.</li>

It&#x27;s my everyday \\&quot;go to\\&quot; cologne because its not too expensive and the scent is not overwhelming or overpowering.  Most important my girlfriend loves the scent on me! I would highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t really smell like the hair care products at all. It just smells like strong cheap cologne. 2 stars because it would be good for a middle school boy trying to pick up chicks.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for over 7 years... This is not the same... It is watered down...does not Last... It is a fake and stupid me I bought two.  I  was hoping it was the original since it is hard to find now... Lesson learned... Don&#x27;t buy...de...X</li>

    <li> Smell Great on my Husband!</li>
