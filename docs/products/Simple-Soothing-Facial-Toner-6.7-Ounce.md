      <li>/&gt;Overall, I really enjoy this product.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I was hesitant about trying this product and bought it as a last ditch effort since my normal toner was sold out at 3 stores and I was not going to look at a 4th! Just as other reviewers have stated, the cotton ball is as clean as when I first put this product on it.  I feel nothing on my skin, not even the slightest tingle. I have oily skin and this has not only made my skin appear oilier but it has also caused me to break out! I have what looks like tiny white heads on my face and shoulders, which are the areas in which I have used this product. Completely disappointed and a complete waste of my money. Don&#x27;t even bother purchasing, unless you want to break out and have the reverse effects what was its purpose is.</li>
    <li> I only used one toner, which came with ProActiv and it really didn&#x27;t do much. This toner, from Simple, helped me out A LOT.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My face is really clearing up thanks to Simple, and this toner is doing it&#x27;s job without hurting my skin at all. And it does take away anything else that you may have missed when washing your face, and it leaves it fresh and clean. I can even feel my skin breathe in relief.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;GET IT! I recommend it!</li>
    <li> You regret buying this.This is the best Toner i have ever used.It does&#x27;nt burn the skin,it takes out the residual make up and soap,and it just leaves your face soft and refreshed.I don&#x27;t regret buying this and will stick to this product for a very long long long time</li>
    <li> To be honest, I&#x27;m not entirely sure why we need to use toners, or what it&#x27;s supposed to accomplish. Pore tightening? Extra cleaning? I guess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Whatever toners are supposed to do, this seems to be a really good one. It makes my skin feel good, it smells nice without any extra fragrance. It just all around makes for a pleasant experience with good effects. If you&#x27;re looking for a toner, this is the one to pick.</li>
    <li> This Soothing Toner is very refreshing.  However, the only setback to purchasing this product is that you have to buy cotton balls or pads to use it.  This is why I prefer to buy the pre-moistened towelettes by Simple so there is no additional purchases of any sort to enjoy the products.</li>
    <li> I love these products. I have just recently started using the scrub, toner and both night and day cream. My skin has never looked or felt better!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always been looking for a non-sticky toner, because I likes to keep my face clear and smooth. I bought this toner together with light moisturizer, they work like a charm! PS: My skin type is combination to oil.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t have particularly sensitive skin, more so sensitive than regular though, and I&#x27;ve really loved this toner from first use! It is \\&quot;simple\\&quot; and doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin (so much that the Simple lotion wont re-balance it) or irritate it whatsoever. The ingredients seem to be a blend that I particularly love - it combines a few key toner-types that I&#x27;ve used in the past that singularly didn&#x27;t work all that well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course, it&#x27;s not a end-all-cure-all but it&#x27;s one step in the right direction. I&#x27;ve tried a lot of products to help my mild adult acne and this just works best, along with a healthy diet / lifestyle. The Simple line works best for me with twice daily usage and again - healthy diet!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because everyone is different: I live in denver, slightly sensitive skin, medium dryness, I am rarely without at least one blemish, and I try to eat healthy (not always successful) and wash my face twice daily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good luck!</li>
    <li> Love this product. I have very sensitive skin. The procuct did not csuse any skin issues at all. This same review applies to the othet Simple products I purchased.</li>
    <li> I am 44 and seem to have teenage skin...  I started using Simple and I am finally getting clearer skin...  I have had no allergic reaction at all, this is great for sensitive skin!</li>
    <li> Simple Soothing Facial Toner gave my face a nice soothing feel that I enjoyed, but after I enjoy using this toner when I come out of the shower. I had high expectations for this product but the next day I noticed my complexion had these very fine bumps that are similar to a rash. I wanted to be sure that it was this product that was doing this to my skin so the next day I only used this product and again my face had this fine but rash like irritation on my face. I really wasn&#x27;t pleased with the results and I immediately discontinued my use of the Simple Soothing Facial Toner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love Simple Facial products and have used them before because of my sensitive skin but something in this particular product didn&#x27;t agree with my skin. I will use Simple Facial products again but just not this toner.</li>
    <li> This toner is very simple and works ok for the most part.  I have sensitive skin and sometimes my skin can get irritated with witch hazel.  This toner has simple ingredients but I can&#x27;t use it very frequently (like every day) or my skin reacts to it.  I have a mild sensitivity to parabens and though this toner has only one type of parabens (and it&#x27;s the last ingredient) my skin can get a bit itchy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not too bad if I remember to use it sparingly but not a product that will be part of my skin care routine.</li>
    <li> My wife and I have been using a few \\&quot;Simple\\&quot; products recently--the facial scrub, the \\&quot;refreshing\\&quot; gel, and this facial toner.  Of them all, the scrub has been my favorite and the gel my least-favorite. This facial toner falls smack in the middle. It does what it is supposed to do, and comes in at a price point that is cheaper than more high-end toners that do roughly the same thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like other \\&quot;Simple\\&quot; products, this toner is a victim of its own advertising. There is nothing particularly \\&quot;soothing\\&quot; about it, and if you glance at the ingredients list it isn&#x27;t very \\&quot;natural\\&quot; either. I&#x27;ve come to expect that from \\&quot;Simple.\\&quot; They make good products, but can&#x27;t resist slapping extra adjectives on their bottles that don&#x27;t really mean anything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a toner, neither my wife nor I have any complaints. We don&#x27;t really have sensitive skin or any skin allergies to speak of, so that isn&#x27;t a worry. The toner is a nice finishing touch to a daily shower routine, with a scent that isn&#x27;t overpowering and leaves your face feeling clean and smooth.</li>
    <li> I have dry skin and many toners I&#x27;ve tried leave my skin feeling more dry and too tight. It feels as if my skin will crack if I smile. This Simple Soothing Toner does not leave my skin feeling as if all the moisture has been sucked out of it. It doesn&#x27;t have any strong, annoying fragrance or wreak of alcohol like some toners. Like its name, it&#x27;s just a simple cleansing aid for the face. It wipes on smoothly and cleans my pores a bit more than washing alone. It hasn&#x27;t been a fix-all to give me an even complexion, but it&#x27;s one of the better of the toners I&#x27;ve tried over the years. I&#x27;ve used expensive department store toners as well as inexpensive ones I found at Target. For the price, I think this Simple toner is worth it.</li>
    <li> This product, in my opinion, is the best made by this company.  It cleanses and refreshes the skin without any stinging and is not weighed down by fragrances of any kind.  This is a product great to have on camp-outs or backpacking trips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now that the summer heat is coming to the Southwest, I have been using this more to stay refreshed.  This toner also helps remove the dust we get so prevalently this time of year in Arizona.  My skin likes this product.</li>
    <li> I have tried many expensive and less expensive facial cleaners and this is definitely the best.  Would recommend to all whom want clean skin at a not breaking the bank price.</li>
    <li> This toner has the consistency of water, there is no body to it at all. To apply it to the face it is necessary to lower the face to one&#x27;s open palms, otherwise the liquid will just roll off your hands onto the floor. Yes it&#x27;s not supposed to be a cream but the application process really isn&#x27;t very soothing either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Using it has the same effect on one&#x27;s face as rubbing alcohol in that it dries instantly leaving a sense of skin dryness. As others have noted, the manufacturer doesn&#x27;t describe in any detail what benefit comes from using this and at about $18 for a package of two I agree that it&#x27;s true, it really doesn&#x27;t seem to do very much.</li>
    <li> While I wasn&#x27;t thrilled with the other products in this line that I&#x27;ve used, I really like this toner. I love that it is extremely gentle for my sensitive face. It doesn&#x27;t dry my skin out, and it hasn&#x27;t irritated it so far. It&#x27;s also less expensive than many of the other toners on the market.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, if you have sensitive skin, it&#x27;s worth a try!</li>
    <li> I enjoy using this toner when I come out of the shower. I waan&#x27;t sure what to expect from this one, which is probably for the best as it doesn&#x27;t really do a whole lot. I wasn&#x27;t exactly pleased, but I didn&#x27;t feel like it did a whole lot either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The toner feels nice on my face, but that&#x27;s about it. I&#x27;m not even sure I&#x27;d go as far as to call it soothing. It does leave something to be desired.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The toner lost a star because of the price. At eighteen dollars for a pack of two, I can&#x27;t exactly rave about this toner that doesn&#x27;t really wow in any way, shape, or form. It feels nice, but that doesn&#x27;t quite cut it.</li>
    <li> My skin is quite sensitive to anything I put on it.  While I already have a toner that I like, I wanted to give this one a try since it is free of dyes and perfumes and is specifically made for sensitive skin.  It leaves my face feeling and looking smooth, but I don&#x27;t find it quite as deep cleaning as my go-to toner [[ASIN:B002DPUY6A Burt&#x27;s Bees Garden Tomato Toner]].  Even after washing my face, the Burt&#x27;s Bees toner still pulls a good deal of dirt off my skin and onto the cotton ball.  But this toner doesn&#x27;t grab as much of the dirt as the Burt&#x27;s Bees toner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking for a gentle toner that is free of dyes and perfumes, this is a good choice.  But if you like your toner to also do a bit of deep cleaning, this may not be the best choice.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been wanting to replace my expensive spa-purchased toner with something more affordable, and this is it. It contains witch hazel and chamomile, the perfect ingredients for my extremely sensitive skin. Unscented; makes my skin feel tight and tingly. Love it.</li>
    <li> This alcohol free toner is the best thing that ever touched my face. Its all natural and it smells so good. I really cleared my complexion and gave me a healthy, rosy glow.  The benefits of witch-hazel are detailed in many books and websites. This particular brand feels good going on, leaves my face feeling clean but not dry or tight.  It removes anything that is left over from my cleanser (usually nothing) and preps my skin for the next step in my regimen. I also love the scrub in this line.</li>
    <li> I have to be very careful with what I use on my face as I have very sensitive skin.  I have used the same toner for years and been very happy with it.  Since I have to go on line to get it I decided to give The Simple Soothing Facial Toner a try as I can buy at a store near me.  I have used it for several weeks now and it does a very good job.  I use it every morning.  It leaves my skin feeling refreshed and smooth.  I have had no adverse reaction so it is appropriate for sensitive skin.  The price is also very reasonable.  I would recommend it for any skin type.</li>
    <li> This toner is very soft, gentle, and soothing. It is not even the least bit harsh or irritating, which is a refreshing change compared to other toner.&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this in the evening and love it. It feels so nice after using a harsher acne scrub on my face. However, this toner is a bit \\&quot;oily\\&quot; feeling, and my skin tends to be oily anyways, so I don&#x27;t use it in the morning when my skin is more oily.&lt;br /&gt;I would think that if you have very dry or irritated skin this would be the right toner for you.</li>
    <li> Feels nice going on.  It does leave your face feeling a bit refreshed for a couple of minutes after application.  I don&#x27;t get any adverse reaction after using it.  However, I&#x27;m not sure what else it does.  I don&#x27;t notice any difference in my skin after about a month of use.  Honestly, after reading the package and online ads for this toner, I am still unsure what it is supposed to do.</li>
    <li> My husband and son both like this product and use it as their main facial cleanser in the evening. It is gentle enough that it doesn&#x27;t dry out the skin, but strong enough to really provide a good cleanse. I think their purity standards are a bit misleading, read the ingredient label carefully, it still contains ingredients that are on my \\&quot;do not use\\&quot; list, like parabens. So if you are a real purist, skip this product. It is better than most commercial brands, but there are products out there that can do the same thing for your skin with absolutely no parabens or sulfates.</li>
    <li> I like this toner. It really is simple, soothing, and nice. I like that it is not full of chemicals and toxins.</li>
    <li> Sometimes my skin is very oily and I use a Toner to help. However Simple Soothing Facial Toner can be used on oily, normal or dry sking without any adverse effects. Leaves skin smooth and soft. There are no alchols or perfumes so it does not dry skin out like a lot of tones do. This tones goes great with the other products in this line.</li>
    <li> not sure I see a lot of changes in my skin but I like the fact it is a clean product free of all Chemicals</li>
    <li> My wife and I both enjoy using this toner at night.  I have sensitive skin and it works fine for me.  It doesn&#x27;t have any over powering smells, and leaves my skin feeling clean and refreshed.  I would consider purchasing this in the future.  Give it a try.</li>
    <li> I like this toner. It&#x27;s inexpensive (especially here on Amazon) and effective. It has reduced the look of some of my stubborn acne blemishes and scars - probably because it contains Witch Hazel, a gentle, natural astringent - without drying out my face. A great product.</li>
    <li> It has very little soothing effects on the skin rash on the back of my neck.</li>
    <li> Davreat&#x27;s Wife speaking (Pls be kind RE: Typos; I have arthritis) For under $20, this is an amazing product.  It out-performs Department store brands three times the price and leaves no film or tightness behind.  It&#x27;s safe enough to use several times a day even on the most sensitive skin.  I began using the [[ASIN:B0073GO01E Simple Refreshing Facial Wash Gel, 5 oz]] about a year ago after gettings some sample sizes and I just fell in love with the line.  The two of these paired together do just as much for my skin as my entire drawer full of Lancome, Dior, Clinique and Este Lauder \\&quot;cosmeceutical\\&quot; creams, cleansers and toners.  No matter how much I love the rose scented Lancome toner, I prefer this new Simple Soothing toner because it leaves me with a deeper clean, softer face and absolutely NO SCENT on my skin.  That makes it perfect to use anywhere, anytime and especially nice at night when all you want is to lay your clean face on your clean pillowcase.  I do still use overnight serums to repair sun damage but no more with the heavy creams.  I don&#x27;t need them becuase Simple&#x27;s toner isn&#x27;t stripping the moisture from my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have sensitive skin and some toners and make-up removers make my face red. Others just make your face feel on fire even if they don&#x27;t redden your face.  Think Sea Breeze.  I used to use natural witchazel but that has such a medicinal odor to it. Simple&#x27;s Toner does everything you want it to and nothing else.  it leaves your face clean and soft so you can either put on some light make-up or apply some renewal serums and go to bed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I keep my bottle in the refrigerator for extra soothing coolness. If you get red in the face on hot days, this stuff is for YOU.  if you&#x27;re at an age where you only wear tinted moisturizers or BB and CC creams because liquid or cream foundation looks like paint, this stuff&#x27;s for YOU.  It&#x27;s as much a healing product as it is a cleansing and toning product.  Stick in the fridge like I do and it will calm your skin down in 5 minutes!  If it&#x27;s morning, I do still put on a light moisturizer gel and then dot a little BB cream here and there, both Clinique.  But that&#x27;s it except for a swipe of mascara and a neutral shade of eye shadow and lip stain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one thing  Simple&#x27;s wash and Toner doesn&#x27;t replace for me , however, is a good mascara remover.  For that I still tend to rely on [[ASIN:B000RO83AS Lancome BI-FACIL Non-Oily Instant Cleanser Sensitive Eyes 125ml/4.2oz]] or the very similar product, [[ASIN:B004GHGA8O L&#x27;Oreal Paris Eye Makeup Remover, 100% Oil-Free, 4 Fluid Ounce]].  The two companies are owned by the same conglomerate and often you can find a cheaper version of the same thing Lancome sells under a slightly different name with loreal but smell them, use them and look at the list of ingredients and they&#x27;ll be nearly the same.  Only difference?  Price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Simple comes out with a better eye make-up remover than they currently sell, one  I can use with a Q-tip for quick fixes very close to my eye and then to completely remove my make-up in one swipe, they&#x27;ll have me at \\&quot;Hello\\&quot;.  I have tried their [[ASIN:B005TI7NRG Simple MakeUp Remover, 4.2 Ounce (Pack of 2)]] and even their [[ASIN:B00AO4EKSU Simple Eye Make-Up Remover Pad, 30 Count]] products but they just don&#x27;t quite do the job for me yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I have faith that this is a Skincare Line that is quickly filling a need and I hope they thrive for many years to come.  I love having unscented, hypo-allergenic products that cost far less and do much more than their fancy counterparts from the big companies!  I&#x27;m  sure they&#x27;ll soon meet many more of my needs and will yank much more of my business away.  SImple is expanding and that is only GOOD NEWS for us ladies.ll calm your skin down in 5 minutes!

    <li> Having sensitive skin present problems that are so often exacerbated by skin care products, even those sold as hypo-allergenic, etc.  The \\&quot;Simple\\&quot; products have all worked for me with no problems and I have re-purchased them several times.  They are pleasantly scented and very gentle.  I would recommend trying these \\&quot;Simple\\&quot; skin care products to anyone who has sensitive skin issues.</li>
    <li> Living in the city, my skin gets clogged and feels dirty at the end of the day. I like to use a toner after washing my face to really clean out my pores but many are full of alcohol and other harsh chemicals. This product however is incredibly gentle, fragrance free and easy on sensitive skin. It feels good and my face feels refreshed and clean after using this product.</li>
    <li> Better than my other more expensive one. feels natural and the smell is not bad. I bought two more for my family</li>
    <li> This toner is incredibly gentle on the skin and cleans up excess dirt really well. I usually have fewer pimples after using it. I also recommend the eye make up remover from Simple as well.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t think I ever heard of toner until I was twenty or twenty one.  But adding toner to my morning routine did make a difference in my skin - it&#x27;s less dry and softer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But I&#x27;m not sold on the Simple Soothing Facial Toner.  It&#x27;s not awful.  It doesn&#x27;t smell and it hasn&#x27;t irritated my skin.  It&#x27;s just not as effective as other toners I&#x27;ve used.  (I like Estee Lauder and TESS both.)  It soaks into the cotton ball very fast - I have to add more toner to the cotton a couple of times to do my entire face.  I&#x27;ve never had that problem before.  I also feel like I don&#x27;t see much of a difference in my skin with this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Simple is cheaper than a lot of other toners available, but in this case I&#x27;d be willing to pay a little more for a better product.</li>
    <li> This toner is pretty awesome; its formulation works well with my skin. It does a great job and leaves me feeling great when I opt for this completely residue-free solution. Little will go a long way using this incredible facial toner.</li>
    <li> Simple Soothing Facial Toner has a neutral odor and has a light, non-stinging astringent effect on the skin.  It works well on a mixed facial complexion because it is non-irritating and not overly-drying.</li>
    <li> The Simple Soothing Facial Toner is a light, soothing toner, that works great on my SENSITIVE skin!  It provides a nice, calming and soothing wetness in the form of toner, and soothes as it goes on.  I enjoyed the feel and smoothness of this toner, which is a nice, light and works well: I ran into no issues with this toner, and felt that it went very well on and soothed as it did ~ I would definitely recommend this product, especially for those with sensitive skin!</li>
    <li> This gentle astringent closes my pores without overly drying my skin.  It prepares my face for moisturizer and cosmetics by tightening the skin and removing any residues from cleansing.  Yes, it dries a little, as any toner does, but it does not feel harsh.  I like to use it in the morning after cleansing or for a touchup later in the day.  It does not contain alcohol and instead uses witch hazel as the astringent.  Witch hazel not only closes pores, but it is used (when full strength) to soothe swelling and bruising, to treat eczema, and to relieve discomfort from insect bites.  While it make not seem to make sense at first to use it on a normal face, it does act as a skin soother and tightener.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyone with oily or large-pore skin will probably find this toner insufficient because its formulation for sensitive skin keeps the astringency lower than with many other brands.  This toner is best for delicate/sensitive skin that does not require a lot of oil removal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-- Debbie Lee Wesselmann</li>
    <li> I like the Simple brand products because they do not have harsh ingredients and are good for my sensitive skin.  I am always a bit cautious when trying new products, but this has turned out to be a good brand for me.  The toner slightly tightens my skin and it does not irritate.</li>
    <li> 1) It works...even during that time of the month that wreaks havoc on my skin (when bills are due ;p).&lt;br /&gt;2) It doesn&#x27;t have that antiseptic smell that a lot of the facial cleansers have, which is nice when I use this before bedtime - I don&#x27;t smell like a medicine cabinet, and it doesn&#x27;t leave an after-scent on my pillowcase.&lt;br /&gt;3) No irritation of any kind. A lot of facial products are adding so many \\&quot;herbal\\&quot; extracts, I&#x27;m wary of putting any of them on my face when I know so little about the ingredients. With the Simpe facial products, I don&#x27;t have to \\&quot;investigate.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this with [[ASIN:B0073GO0SC Simple Smoothing Facial Scrub]] and [[ASIN:B0073GO01E Simple Refreshing Facial Wash Gel]], and I&#x27;ve been very happy with all of them.</li>
    <li> I like to use this in the morning and in the evening.&lt;br /&gt;After toweling off in the morning after a shower - even if it is to just jump in, wake up, wash my face.... - I like to apply this toner. It probably is best described as a means to wash up any residual gunkies and just give my face a nice clean, fresh start to the day. At the end, before going to bed, whether I decide I have the energy to wash my face or not, I like to use this to do a little \\&quot;last minute cleaning\\&quot; before going to bed. It really, and oddly, feels rather refreshing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as using it, I don&#x27;t know what I was reading or where I got the idea, but somehow I was under the impression that the user was to apply the \\&quot;upward\\&quot; technique of small circles, but this wasn&#x27;t effective. I had tried this for about two weeks, and it was just getting awkward. :(&lt;br /&gt;So, I re-read the instructions and it just said \\&quot;upward\\&quot; movement/strokes (sorry, I don&#x27;t have the bottle on hand). Perfect! I could use shorter or longer depending on if I was in a hurry or if I just felt like one or the other.... And, when the directions say \\&quot;apply generously,\\&quot; unless your cotton ball(s) or square(s) are sopping wet/dripping, you can&#x27;t apply too much. The first few times I tried it, I thought I had poured too much, but in all reality, I had poured too LITTLE! Even still now, having used it almost every day for about two months (here and there have been a night or two when I&#x27;ve traveled that, to me, it isn&#x27;t worth bringing along when I can just use it the following day/the day following) to TRY to go through it, and I still have some left. My guess, if used twice a day everyday....easy two months, maybe three. For me, it feels as if this bottle lasts forever and will \\&quot;never\\&quot; run out, which, in my opinion, is a good thing, especially if you like the product, and I definitely like this one. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cotton Balls&lt;br /&gt;If you are using large/huge: you only really need one, unless your face is SUPER huge, or is SUPER dirty (if you haven&#x27;t washed your face with something already).&lt;br /&gt;If you are using small: you will want/need at LEAST 3 or 4. I try to stick with 3, but sometimes use 4.&lt;br /&gt;If you are using cotton squares (like for makeup removing): I tend to stack 2 to 3 thick. Two usually does the trick. But, on days when my skin is drier and likes to absorb just about anything/everything non-water, I use three.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I really enjoy this product. Would I buy it again? Yes. A definite, no hesitation: yes.&lt;br /&gt;Do I rave about it? No. Is it the next best thing to sliced bread? For me, no. But it helps. I&#x27;ve had no negative repercussions from using this (having sensitive skin and the like) and to me, if it helps or works enough that I&#x27;d want to use it again, I&#x27;ll recommend it if someone asks. :)dirty (if you haven&#x27;t washed your face with something already).&lt;br /&gt;If you are using small: you will want/need at LEAST 3 or 4.

    <li> Pretty good toner, has a nice zing to it, and refreshing. Smell is nice, Chamomile as described, follows up nicely to scrubs.</li>
    <li> There&#x27;s good news and bad news about this toner. The good news is that it IS a good option for those with sensitive skin, or at least it has been for me and I have very sensitive skin. Additionally, I&#x27;ve noticed that it actually works, tightening up pores and leaving skin feel deep-down refreshed. Previously I had been using Pro-Activ toner which is incredibly harsh on the skin and could only be used very sparingly. This toner can be used every day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bad news is that those who have even more sensitive than me may find the Witch Hazel active ingredient to disagree with their skin and cause redness. It&#x27;s a balance act, where you want a toner that will actually DO something but you don&#x27;t want it to be so harsh that it leaves folks with burnt skin. Whether or not it works for you may depend on your skin type.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I am sold. No more pro-active toner for me, I&#x27;m sticking with Simple. I really like their gel face cleanser and moisturizer. They&#x27;re a touch above Cetaphil in cleansing power but still very gentle, in my opinion. Cetaphil is great, but I need something a little stronger - Simple products seem to provide that.</li>
    <li> Bought online, now readily available in stores. I like this to swipe my face when I havn&#x27;t worn any makeup. Nice simple and refreshing.</li>
    <li> I have extremely sensitive skin that reacts to weather changes. Often it is just irritated from changes in humidity.  I find this so soothing and good if not better than more expensive department store brands.  I think a good deal on Amazon.</li>
