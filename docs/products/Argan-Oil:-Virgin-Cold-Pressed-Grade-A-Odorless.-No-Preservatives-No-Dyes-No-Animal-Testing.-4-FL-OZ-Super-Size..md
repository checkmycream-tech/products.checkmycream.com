      <li>that it&#x27;s fair trade, supporting Moroccan women union; as a woman, it&#x27;s important to me</li>
      <li>I’ll just cut to the chase and say that Argan oil is great for feeding the skin, keeping it young while protecting it from environmental damage.</li>
      <li>so she started telling me about this great natural oil she found on Amazon.</li>
      <li>Now I completely understand why it&#x27;s so popular!</li>
      <li>part about this seller is the HUGE bottle you get.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s an awesome product with quite a few benefits.</li>
      <li>for this big size it truly is a great price, comparing to Josie Mehran and it looks and feels</li>
      <li>It makes my complection look smooth and not blotchy.</li>
      <li>dry.don&#x27;t put it on my face because I can only use water based products on it.other than that the prize is good compared to what&#x27;s out there.planning on buying more when this one is</li>
      <li>After that I figure out the right amount to put on my hair, and I really love the result every time.</li>
      <li>From a guy’s point of view; the price is right and she looks better than ever.</li>
      <li>As I&#x27;ve gotten older, the weather&#x27;s been taking more and more of a toll on my skin, drying out my hands and face.  </li>
      <li>I liked this particular product because the vendor gives a lot of information about the benefits of argan oil, and the product doesn&#x27;t contain chemicals.</li>
      <li>No other product makes my hair look as good as when I use this argan oil.</li>
      <li>:) I was convinced to buy it because of all the great reviews I had seen from the news and from quite a few celebrities, like Eva Mendez.</li>
      <li>She stumbled across argan oil a while back and has been using it with great success.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Finally, as a social justice issue, this product benefits the women&#x27;s unions of Morocco and it is fair trade.</li>
      <li>and I would gladly recommend this product to anyone who wants help for their skin.</li>
      <li>well she has a habit of buying a lot of skin care products, and most of the time they don&#x27;t work very well.</li>
      <li>Being a money pincher like I am (When it comes to things I don&#x27;t want) I want to make sure I&#x27;m not going to get ripped off, so I started doing research on Argan Oil and it turns out that it works very well.</li>
      <li>read a lot of technical details surrounding how this oil works and how good it is for skin maintenance.</li>
      <li>I was wondering if she was pregnant or something, so I asked.</li>
      <li>Helps with winter skin issues...dry skin, mild eczema has seen improvement.</li>
      <li>I love that it&#x27;s odorless, particularly when used on the face.</li>
      <li>I normally get hair cuts much more often</li>
      <li>Great product and highly recommend and would definitely buy from this seller again.</li>
      <li>It feels good on my skin and helps prevent my dry skin from returning.</li>
      <li>It is absorbed by the skin quickly so my hands don&#x27;t feel slippery.  </li>
      <li>all these dry and itchy feeling.4 FL oz is quite good size for the price.  </li>
      <li>She really liked that it is odorless because other products she has used can be really strong.</li>
      <li>So far, the callouses seem to be much better</li>
      <li>And I absolutely love the fact that it is completely natural and organic with no preservatives.</li>
      <li>My hands are so soft and I feel so much better.</li>
      <li>I found it useful right away as it tamed my frizzy hair.  </li>
      <li>The package came right away.</li>
      <li>once I finish the one I have right now.</li>
      <li>Absorbs very well and quickly if you don&#x27;t over do with the application.  </li>
      <li>I like the fact that it&#x27;s 100% organic, natural and paraben free, which gives me a peace of mind using on myself and on my kids.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m adjusting the amount I apply to my face until I get the exact amount to prevent me from having a glistening face every day.</li>
      <li>but I must tell you that it has managed to keep my skin from looking gray and seems to last longer than most applications.</li>
      <li>At first, this didn&#x27;t help the issues, but her skin did appear healthier and fresher.  </li>
      <li>She was astonished that I even noticed, (we’ve been married forever)</li>
      <li>/&gt;Argan Oil contains Tocopherols which is basically a form of Vitamin E, it functions as an antioxidant which helps provide anti-aging effects such as preventing skin deterioration by helping produce more elastin &amp; collagen which improves the moisture content of the skin.</li>
      <li>It makes my beauty routine simple and enjoyable.</li>
      <li>, it is highly effective on wrinkles &amp; fine lines, it is all natural, organic, and pure, it prevents skin pores from clogging, and it is capable of repairing dry brittle nails, frizzy hair and split</li>
      <li>I noticed that her face seemed more radiant than usual and that her hair seemed healthy and vibrant as well.</li>
      <li>And even my dry hands get better.</li>
      <li>This Argan Oil might be 100% pure</li>
      <li>I chose this brand because it comes in large 4 oz bottles and the purchase comes with a guarantee.  </li>
      <li>I read a lot of great reviews and recently decided to purchase this Argan Oil by Vitaville and assembled a little skin care package in a basket for her birthday.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m typically very picky about what beauty products I use, so I was hesitant when ordering this.</li>
      <li>I have been on a search for years looking for something to bring back my smooth skin.</li>
      <li>But none is really working .</li>
      <li>I purchased this for my wife who really takes care of her skin.  </li>
      <li>and it helps soften skin very well.</li>
      <li>My hair got very oily and too shiny, and I decide it to wash it off.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This product is absolutely amazing. I love that it&#x27;s odorless, particularly when used on the face. Some of prior argan oil purchased had quite a pungent smell. The price is not cheap, but reasonable when compared to Josie Mehran and it feels and looks the same. I like the fact that it&#x27;s 100% organic, natural and paraben free, which gives me a peace of mind using on myself and on my kids. I use it on dry patches on neck. hands, elbows and feet. I also use it as hair treatment over night once a month, after shampooing out the next morning, leaves the hair shiny and smooth. I like it that it&#x27;s fair trade, supporting Moroccan women union; as a woman, it&#x27;s important to me so support companies that support other women.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Check out this product!</li>
    <li> This oil really helped me out. It feels good on my skin and helps prevent my dry skin from returning. Have only been using for a week, and my dry elbows are now smooth and look normal.  Great product and highly recommend and would definitely buy from this seller again. I am a Definitely Satisfied Purchaser (DSP) !!!!!!</li>
    <li> This is a very nice Argan Oil - high quality.  It has a flip top for easy control and is a manageable size at 4 ounces!  I like that it is cold-pressed and scentless as well.  Argan oil is a great oil for skin but also for hair.  It is perfect to use in the cold drying winter air.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> I really love this oil product. It is odorless and unlike the other brand I tried with pungent smell. Believe me you would enjoy using it under your lips and face, it is scentless! Plus, since it is 100% organic and all nature ingredients, I have no worries to use it on my children. When it comes to my skin and things like that, I am very picky. I also tried to use it to massage my scalp, as I always have the dandruff problems for quite a while. Quite tired from trying all kind of anti dandruff products in the market. But none is really working . But after I tried to massage my scalp with it a few times. It seems to be better, less itchy and quite like my hair shinny. And even my dry hands get better. I applied them on myself just like using other lotion. It helped to stop all these dry and itchy feeling.4 FL oz is quite good size for the price.  Loving it!</li>
    <li> I am a nurse and I am constantly washing my hands. I have been on a search for years looking for something to bring back my smooth skin. I am very sensitive to a lot of products, but argan oil worked for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the idea of no preservatives, no added fragrances, no dyes or other oils added. With the weather getting cold my hands crack because of dry weather. I am looking forward to this winter because I am using argan oil. I know I will not have any problems!</li>
    <li> Got this product as a gift from a friend.  It&#x27;s an awesome product with quite a few benefits. First and foremost, this product is all natural, which is something that&#x27;s so hard to find nowadays.  With all the researches that have been done showing the correlation of the amount of preservatives used to a product&#x27;s carcinogenicity, one can hardly imagine the people that are using preservative-full products.  The argan oil is definitely an escape from that as it does not contain preservatives like benzoic acid and particularly parabens, which is commonly linked to breast cancer.&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, as I said, this was a gift. I found it useful right away as it tamed my frizzy hair.  Just a few drops was all it took.  I&#x27;ve also recently found out that if I apply it at night before sleeping and wash it off in the morning, it makes my hair silky smooth.  I&#x27;m definitely buying a bottle of this once I finish the one I have right now.</li>
    <li> I love this product!  A friend of mine used an argan oil for stretch marks during her pregnancy, so I thought I would give it a try as well.  I liked this particular product because the vendor gives a lot of information about the benefits of argan oil, and the product doesn&#x27;t contain chemicals. It worked fantastically for me!  Not only did the pregnancy stretch marks get lighter with time, but the argan oil also relieved the itchy skin that also comes with pregnancy.  I also used it on my hands and elbows where I had dry patches of skin, and the argan oil provided relief for those areas as well.  This product would make a great gift for a baby shower or for a new mom!</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my wife who really takes care of her skin.  She found&lt;br /&gt;it very easy to use and the results were amazing.  Her skin looks healthier&lt;br /&gt;than ever.  She has used a lot of skin care products in the past but none seem&lt;br /&gt;to get rid of the wrinkles like this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She also likes the fact it is all natural with no preservatives.  If my wife is happy,&lt;br /&gt;I am happy!</li>
    <li> I have been interested in argan oil since I saw TV program talking about it several weeks ago, and I finally decided to give it a try.  I chose this brand because it comes in large 4 oz bottles and the purchase comes with a guarantee.  At the beginning, I had no idea how much oil I should put on my hair and I ended up putting too much oil on it. My hair got very oily and too shiny, and I decide it to wash it off.  After shampooing my hair, I noticed that my hair was soft and a little shiny, and it all looked very healthy. That was just the way I liked it.  After that I figure out the right amount to put on my hair, and I really love the result every time.</li>
    <li> This Argan Oil might be 100% pure however it comes in a plastic container.  Doing a Google search for Argan Oil glass or plastic packaging, it appears a darkened glass bottle is much better than plastic.&lt;br /&gt;I returned it unopened.</li>
    <li> As Bette Davis said once &amp;#34;getting old ain&#x27;t for sissies&amp;#34;. I have been fighting the battle of youth by dying my hair. I went almost completely grey very young (at age 32) and so have been dying it consistently for  over 20 years. This takes its toll. I ran across this product by accident. I use it on my hair at night about 2 times per month. Wow...it repairs dry and brittle hair well so that it takes dye even better than it used to. I could probably use it more often, but 2 times per month seems to be enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have also used it on my feet overnight and it helps soften skin very well. If I can remember (old age again), then I try to use it overnight before I get a pedicure. It makes everyone&#x27;s job easier and I get more bang for my buck!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The  other good thing about this particular product is that it does not have any parabens, While the jury is still out about whether these are as bad for us as some say, I do not like to take any chances. And since I used so much make up when I was younger that had these preservatives, I figure I have had enough exposure for one life...LOL. This is a totally natural product that is 100%  organic and so I do not have to worry about any bizarre study coming out later about it being carcinogenic..LOL.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, as a social justice issue, this product benefits the women&#x27;s unions of Morocco and it is fair trade. I like knowing that my vanity has not made some other guy in the world sell his/her products at a pittance, and women worldwide need to support each other.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, I think everyone will love this product. It works.</li>
    <li> My fiancee suffers from psoriasis and, like me, tends to avoid the doctor whenever possible.  She stumbled across argan oil a while back and has been using it with great success.  Her patches of red, flaky skin would disappear within a day or so.  As I&#x27;ve gotten older, the weather&#x27;s been taking more and more of a toll on my skin, drying out my hands and face.  She would try to get me to use it and I tried to avoid it, but I gave it a shot eventually.  I was surprised!  A month later, my skin&#x27;s no longer chapped and flaky.  And I don&#x27;t smell like a vanilla candle, which is a major plus.</li>
    <li> I was looking at my wife recently while we were taking in some Law &amp; Order on the TV and she caught me staring at her. I noticed that her face seemed more radiant than usual and that her hair seemed healthy and vibrant as well. I was wondering if she was pregnant or something, so I asked. She was astonished that I even noticed, (we’ve been married forever) so she started telling me about this great natural oil she found on Amazon. It’s called Argan oil and it is 100% organic and cold-pressed. She really liked that it is odorless because other products she has used can be really strong. Anyway, she said she puts it on her face about once a week and in her hair once a month. What was most important to her was that I NOTICED! This was money well spent in my opinion and I know she has probably told all of her friends about it. From a guy’s point of view; the price is right and she looks better than ever.</li>
    <li> One of the drawbacks of living in the desert - combatting dry skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product does the trick, a drop here, a drop there, a little in the bath...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Best part about this seller is the HUGE bottle you get.  I thought the last seller I tried sent me a sample or trial bottle by mistake.</li>
    <li> I bought this oil to help with dry,winter skin and have since had several compliments about my complexion and makeup.  Since that didn&#x27;t happen so much before then I would say it is because of the Argan Oil.  Absorbs very well and quickly if you don&#x27;t over do with the application.  Start with just a little and if you need more then reapply.</li>
    <li> Okay so my wife really works hard to keep a good complexion, and I work really hard to keep my wallet full lol. well she has a habit of buying a lot of skin care products, and most of the time they don&#x27;t work very well. Being a money pincher like I am (When it comes to things I don&#x27;t want) I want to make sure I&#x27;m not going to get ripped off, so I started doing research on Argan Oil and it turns out that it works very well. Here are some of the facts about this oil.&lt;br /&gt;______________________________________________&lt;br /&gt;Argan Oil contains Tocopherols which is basically a form of Vitamin E, it functions as an antioxidant which helps provide anti-aging effects such as preventing skin deterioration by helping produce more elastin &amp; collagen which improves the moisture content of the skin. This also helps heal damaged skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;This oil works on Stretch marks, it is highly effective on wrinkles &amp; fine lines, it is all natural, organic, and pure, it prevents skin pores from clogging, and it is capable of repairing dry brittle nails, frizzy hair and split ends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;You may not see real noticeable results for about 3 weeks, but in the long run you will definitely see a difference. There is no fragrance, just plain odorless oil, and some people may have an allergic reaction to the natural oils in this so you should see a doctor first.&lt;br /&gt;___________________________________&lt;br /&gt;Now, after doing my research I showed my wife everything and let her decide what to do, she bought a bottle and within a month of getting her first bottle she started really seeing some serious results. I was very pleased to see that this worked so well and I would gladly recommend this product to anyone who wants help for their skin.</li>
    <li> Just bought this and Iove it!  I have tried a ton of Argan oil products and by far this one is the best. Makes my hair really soft and shiny.</li>
    <li> Ever since I was a little kid my mother has been trying to get me to take care of my body. My skin gets very ashy especially in the winter time. Over the years I’ve tried a few products to stay moisturized with varying degrees of success. One of the things I found that works well is Argan oil. My mother initially purchased this product for me after being exasperated with my gray callused hands and feet.&lt;br /&gt;I wouldn’t go so far as to call it a miracle product but I must tell you that it has managed to keep my skin from looking gray and seems to last longer than most applications. Back in the day, most of the stuff I was given to use smelled horrible, were very sticky and left greasy residue everywhere.&lt;br /&gt;I’m no longer young but I’m still youthful, therefore I’d like to take care of my skin in order to maintain its elasticity while protecting it from the environment. One of the things I really appreciate about this product is that a little goes a long way. It’s not necessary to lather myself up after a shower with gunk.&lt;br /&gt;Another area of benefit is the ease of keeping my feet well moisturized for the removal of calluses. I stand on my feet all day long while working which can lead to rapid buildup of calluses around the balls of my feet as well as my heels. Argan oil allows my skin to breathe while maintaining moisture each weekend I then apply a small amount to the trouble spots before exfoliating. This is definitely one of the best products I’ve come across for easy skin maintenance.&lt;br /&gt;I’ve read a lot of technical details surrounding how this oil works and how good it is for skin maintenance. I’ll just cut to the chase and say that Argan oil is great for feeding the skin, keeping it young while protecting it from environmental damage. I’m not interested in why it works, I’m just glad it works as well as it does.</li>
    <li> I like this Argan Oil for my face and hair. Although, I find it to be oilier than the Josie Maran brand I&#x27;ve been using and it takes longer to absorb into my skin. I&#x27;m adjusting the amount I apply to my face until I get the exact amount to prevent me from having a glistening face every day. A tiny drop of this rubbed between my hands and through my hair after I wash it, leaves my hair shiny and soft. It does have a very very faint scent, but one can barely notice it. I&#x27;ve used Argan oil for my skin, hair, feet and hands ever since I was introduced to it by a woman friend. This is a good oil for the price I paid which was $20. It&#x27;s now $35. I would recommend it at the $20 price, but for $35, I&#x27;d continue to look around for other options. There are other quality Argan oils for anyone looking for a less expensive, but still high quality Argan oil. I will be looking for a less expensive alternative as they sure got greedy quickly.</li>
    <li> I was having trouble with a small area of my scalp and after a month the scalp issue has subdue. It&#x27;s no longer as itchy as before. I would apply a little in the area and it has worked wonders!!! Thank you!</li>
    <li> This is a GREAT product. I use it on my face, on my nails and on my hair. It makes my complection look smooth and not blotchy. My hair looks shiny and not frizzy. No other product makes my hair look as good as when I use this argan oil. This item is much less expensive than the same exact item at another website - it is the same argan oil, just a different package. I would purchase this again and again, especially in the winter.</li>
    <li> This Argan Oil is ordorless and as a man I like using this on my face unlike some of the other argain oils which has quite a pungent smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing that is great is that it&#x27;s 100% natural and fair trade, as it feels good to be a part to support Moroccan women union.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also for this big size it truly is a great price, comparing to Josie Mehran and it looks and feels the same!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend it those who are looking for Argan Oil</li>
    <li> Helps with winter skin issues...dry skin, mild eczema has seen improvement. Bottle&lt;br /&gt;spout works to control the amount coming out. I don&#x27;t feel like it&#x27;s being wasted with&lt;br /&gt;too heavy a pourspout.</li>
    <li> really love this product.only use it on my neck and it&#x27;s no longer dry.don&#x27;t put it on my face because I can only use water based products on it.other than that the prize is good compared to what&#x27;s out there.planning on buying more when this one is gone.thank you amazon for bringing us great produts at a reasonable prize.</li>
    <li> My girlfriend has extremely sensitive skin and, as a result, is prone to breakouts when the humidity is too low and when she wears certain brands of make up or wears make up often.  She had also been getting rashes on her face due to an ingredient in Crest toothpaste.  I read a lot of great reviews and recently decided to purchase this Argan Oil by Vitaville and assembled a little skin care package in a basket for her birthday.  She began using this product at night on her face to try to restore her skins health so that she may wear make up without her breakouts and rashes.  At first, this didn&#x27;t help the issues, but her skin did appear healthier and fresher.  After about 2 weeks though the results began to speak for themselves.  She fell in love with this product so I ordered her another bottle in case they would sell out for the Holidays.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because I workout a lot, my hands are extremely calloused where the weights sit during sets.  She doesn&#x27;t like it because when I touch her, it feels like I am scratching her.  After she noticed results with this product, she decided to try it on my hands.  I hate using lotions and oils, but this product is quite good.  It is absorbed by the skin quickly so my hands don&#x27;t feel slippery.  As stated in the product description, this is completely odorless and organic.  I don&#x27;t have to worry about an irritating smell and I don&#x27;t have to worry about exposing my skin or my girlfriends skin to carcinogenic chemicals.  So far, the callouses seem to be much better and she seems to complain less about the scratchy feeling!  This is a great product at a great price!</li>
    <li> I have a really bad problem with my hands drying out and cracking because I am a waitress at Waffle House and we constantly have to be washing dishes and washing our hands. With the weather getting cold, and my hands already fragile, i&#x27;ve been searching for a product that actually works on my skin. I researched a bit and found out about argan oil, so I decided to give it a try. The results were amazing! My hands are so soft and I feel so much better. And I absolutely love the fact that it is completely natural and organic with no preservatives. I highly recommend this for anyone looking for a way to take care of their skin.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this argan oil! I&#x27;m typically very picky about what beauty products I use, so I was hesitant when ordering this. However, the fact that it was 100% natural and has absolutely no preservatives convinced me to try it out. After using this product, I refuse to use anything else! :) I was convinced to buy it because of all the great reviews I had seen from the news and from quite a few celebrities, like Eva Mendez. Now I completely understand why it&#x27;s so popular! It makes my beauty routine simple and enjoyable. Although the price is a little high, it&#x27;s a great deal for the size of the product that you get and it eliminates the need for multiple products because you can use it on your face, lips, hair, and body. Overall, I would recommend this product to absolutely anybody, especially people that care about what they use on their bodies and hair.</li>
    <li> I really liked this product. So good on the skin and hair. I always look for products that multi task. The package came right away.The service was good.Enjoying it!!!</li>
    <li> I always use argan oil to repair my split ends and to keep my hair healthy.  This product is great and I haven&#x27;t had to get a hair cut in over 6 months because the ends of my hair still look and feel great.  I normally get hair cuts much more often and this is probably because I use a lot of styling tools and heat on my hair.  This product has saved my hair and has saved me trips to the salon as well. I love this product!</li>
    <li> Got it in 2 days with Prime, which I highly recommend to everyone.&lt;br /&gt;I hate waiting for my purchases to arrive, thus this Prime membership is so cool!&lt;br /&gt;My wife has been using Argan oil for the past 10 years and swears by it.&lt;br /&gt;In the past she used the Josie Mehran brand, which was much higher priced than this one.&lt;br /&gt;Because it&#x27;s not cheap, she mixes the Argan oil with her body moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;Particularly this winter, it&#x27;s been so cold, adding argan oil makes a huge difference and calmed down the itchy and dry skin.&lt;br /&gt;Also, it&#x27;s a great plus that it&#x27;s odorless, even I use it on my hands when it gets super dry.</li>
