      <li>MyChelle clears up fast.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m very picky about not having parabens in my skin care products.  </li>
      <li>I highly recommend this product!</li>
      <li>Highly recommend</li>
      <li>I really like this moisturizer for my sensitive combination skin.</li>
      <li>When this arrived at my house, the product was separated, oily and had a different smell than if it were purchased fresh.  </li>
      <li>This is a very rich, heavy cream as you might expect.</li>
      <li>Even better- my skin wasn&#x27;t clogged up as usual.  </li>
      <li>I thought to myself, wow - that&#x27;s a new one for me.</li>
      <li>I have really sensitive skin and everything bothers it.  </li>
      <li>This also does not irritate my sensitive skin.</li>

      <li>It is a little heavy for daytime use in humid, warm weather</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m a 29 year old male and have had acne since I was 13 years old.</li>
      <li>In the future, I will be buying MyChelle products directly from [...].  </li>
      <li>I have only used it once so far, but like the way it feels.</li>
      <li>ok - makes face feel a little tight.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s worth a little extra money to ensure quality.</li>
      <li>It had clearly been sitting around for a long period of time before it was shipped.  </li>
      <li>Because MyChelle products are natural, their shelf life is not quite as long as a chemical product.  </li>

<li> And in fact, the product has diminished some of my sun spots, as well as cleared my face of minor acne.</li>
<li> Flying and traveling will dry out skin.  </li>
<li> It does feel a tad greasy for my t zone, but in the dry cold winter, it is just fine.</li>
<li> I have very dry skin that is also acne prone.</li>
<li> It is dry as can be due to chronic health issues and a genetic skin disorder.</li>
<li> Noxzema dried, I apply between a standard #2 pencil eraser-tip-sized and dime-sized amount to my C-Zones and Mid-Forehead, and work this beneath and between my eyebrows, the C-Zones, and forehead, until it disappears.</li>
<li> As with other MyChelle products, this one delivers as promised.</li>
<li> As with the other MyChelle products I&#x27;ve reviewed, I can&#x27;t overstate my excitement that I&#x27;ve had no adverse reactions.</li>
<li> As for the oil separating like the other reviewer was mentioning...</li>
<li> That seems to be the purpose of moisturizer, but other brands don&#x27;t seem to do it as well.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s a little pricey, but I know it will work well</li>
<li> I think it might just be too heavy for my skin.</li>
<li> Secondly, it&#x27;s so heavy</li>
<li> Before then, I used this product for a few years, but not unscented.</li>
<li> Out of the shower and dried, Noxzema pads are applied.</li>
<li> I especially like this cream in the winter when the home heat and cold weather can make skin dry.  </li>
<li> I am surprised bad reviews.</li>
<li> This cream is not so bad, but it is definitely not scent-free.</li>
<li> but I would run out of it quick...and bottle was frustrating to use when you get to the bottom of the bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> Probably not good for oily faces!</li>
<li> I have had the acne issue with ALL of Mychelle&#x27;s products sadly.</li>
<li> I am also allergic to propylene glycol, which makes finding skin care items difficult.</li>
<li> I have horrible skin.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I used this throughout the winter this year and it&#x27;s great. I look for something with sunscreen for summer, so I use this only three seasons of the year. Before then, I used this product for a few years, but not unscented. I was happy with it but thought the unscented would be healthier. I give it 4 stars because I&#x27;d prefer it thinner, as a lotion. But it&#x27;s a cream, and it keeps my skin moist and soaks into my skin so it never feels oily. That seems to be the purpose of moisturizer, but other brands don&#x27;t seem to do it as well. It gets a good healthy product rating at Skin Deep, a part of the Environmental Working Group website, and that&#x27;s important to me.</li>
    <li> Perfect for dry skin. I used it as a night cream. I am surprised bad reviews. It is natural, great ingredients, there is smell but it does not bother me at all. Highly recommend</li>
    <li> I used this forever and didn&#x27;t link it to my acne outbreaks until I stopped using it and the acne disappeared. I think it might just be too heavy for my skin. I have had the acne issue with ALL of Mychelle&#x27;s products sadly. I wanted to support a somewhat local company but not if I get acne outbreaks each time!</li>
    <li> This is a very rich, heavy cream as you might expect. I have only used it once so far, but like the way it feels. The directions say apply a quarter size blob twice a day--no way. First of all the jar is small so you&#x27;d have about 5 days worth. Secondly, it&#x27;s so heavy you&#x27;d feel like greased livestock! I used about a dime size for face and neck and that was plenty. This is too greasy for me to use during he day so I will apply it at night only and after micro needling.</li>
    <li> I have really sensitive skin and everything bothers it.  I have been using this for over  year now and no problems.  It&#x27;s a little pricey, but I know it will work well and I won&#x27;t have any problems.</li>
    <li> Because MyChelle products are natural, their shelf life is not quite as long as a chemical product.  When this arrived at my house, the product was separated, oily and had a different smell than if it were purchased fresh.  It had clearly been sitting around for a long period of time before it was shipped.  In the future, I will be buying MyChelle products directly from [...].  It&#x27;s worth a little extra money to ensure quality.</li>
    <li> The moment I applied this product to my face, I felt absorption and renewal taking place. I thought to myself, wow - that&#x27;s a new one for me. In trusting my instincts, I allowed myself to accept this fact. And in fact, the product has diminished some of my sun spots, as well as cleared my face of minor acne. I&#x27;m moving on to the MyChelle Apple Brightening Mist product - it got rave reviews. As for the oil separating like the other reviewer was mentioning... that did not happen to me but it is an oily product. Probably not good for oily faces!</li>
    <li> I love the MyChelle anti-aging skin care product line.  I especially like this cream in the winter when the home heat and cold weather can make skin dry.  I like the fact that many of the products come in a scented and non-scented option.</li>
    <li> This cream does not work at all.It doesn&#x27;t even moisturize the skin, more like using vaseline. It just stays on top of the skin &amp; makes your face shinny.</li>
    <li> It works great for me, 40 with dry skin and also acne.  It is a little heavy for daytime use in humid, warm weather but I still use it as a night moisturizer in the summer and love the results.</li>
    <li> I have combination skin with an oily t-zone.  As I age, I had to use thicker night creams over the years.  Some were too oily and some didn&#x27;t do the job.  A friend of mine, who works for a skin care company, told me that the key to good skin is all about what you use for night treatment.  Before trying this one, I used Acure&#x27;s night cream.  I&#x27;m very picky about not having parabens in my skin care products.  Acure&#x27;s was great but I would run out of it quick...and bottle was frustrating to use when you get to the bottom of the bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before I went traveling, I picked this up.  Flying and traveling will dry out skin.  So it totally worked and my esthetician was amazed on how moisturized my skin was after my 2.5 wk trip.  Even better- my skin wasn&#x27;t clogged up as usual.  This works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is thicker than most moisturizer but it doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy film on top of your skin.  My skin absorbs it nicely.  I&#x27;m very happy with this cream.</li>
    <li> This cream is not so bad, but it is definitely not scent-free. They might have not added any scents, but jojoba (one of the ingredients) has a very strong scent. Made my eyes water every time. Not scent-free.</li>
    <li> As with other MyChelle products, this one delivers as promised. This skin cream is cool, light, and refreshing but also helps with dry skin. Non- greasy yet moisturizing.</li>
    <li> ok - makes face feel a little tight.  won&#x27;t know how it really works until after a few weeks.</li>
    <li> MyChelle products are amazing. my skin is looking nicer! The redness and sun damage is disappearing! I highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> I have horrible skin. It is dry as can be due to chronic health issues and a genetic skin disorder. I am also allergic to propylene glycol, which makes finding skin care items difficult. So far this cream has been wonderful. My skin stays visibly hydrated for 24 hours after using, and so far no rashes or reactions. I am quite pleased and have ordered more MyChelle products in response.</li>
    <li> As with the other MyChelle products I&#x27;ve reviewed, I can&#x27;t overstate my excitement that I&#x27;ve had no adverse reactions. Not even the tropical scrub or fiesta peel have irritated my skin. Soo pleased.</li>
    <li> I really like this moisturizer for my sensitive combination skin. It does feel a tad greasy for my t zone, but in the dry cold winter, it is just fine. It doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin, and helps to hydrate again. It does list as in scented, but there is still a light fragrance, it&#x27;s very pleasant and not overpowering, so I don&#x27;t mind. I will look for a lighter version for the summer.</li>
    <li> I have very dry skin that is also acne prone. This is an excellent moisturizer and doesn&#x27;t break me out. This also does not irritate my sensitive skin. Just wish it was not in a tub for sanitary reasons.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a 29 year old male and have had acne since I was 13 years old. After rinsing showering, I use Cetaphil Daily Facial Cleanser on my face, followed by body-wide pouf application of Caresse Tahitian Renewal body wash. Out of the shower and dried, Noxzema pads are applied. Noxzema dried, I apply between a standard #2 pencil eraser-tip-sized and dime-sized amount to my C-Zones and Mid-Forehead, and work this beneath and between my eyebrows, the C-Zones, and forehead, until it disappears. Two dime-sized portions are applied to my cheeks, and I work this over and under my nose, around my mouth, and chin-line. Another approximately equal size is worked under my chin and on my neck, and I move any excess up to, on, and around my ear lobes, until all has vanished. Basically, I get total facial coverage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The addition of MyChelle has realized clearly evident skin color balance, reduction of redness and fine lines, and a youthful complexion. MyChelle also seems to accelerate wound healing introduced by shaving cuts. I bought some after researching Epidermal Growth Factor, and am extremely pleased with the results. It works much better for me than Olay Regenerist. MyChelle clears up fast. I&#x27;m totally sold on this product.</li>
