### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>This is by no means the best electric razor out there, but it gets the job done for me.</li>
      <li>This thing is awesome.</li>
      <li>So I don&#x27;t need \\&quot;The Best In The World\\&quot; electric shaver.</li>

      <li>Gets the job done but not the greatest.</li>
      <li>This shaver is not the best but for the price it is a very good shaver.</li>
      <li>While the \\&quot;pop-out\\&quot; trimmer works wonderfully, the foil shaver is incredibly ineffective.  </li>
      <li>I used a low-cost Remington electric shaver for a number of years (it was discontinued) with very good results.  </li>
      <li>i bought the Braun 130-S which is very good.  </li>

      <li>For the price, this shaver works great.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;The skin feels clean-shaven after using it.&lt;br /&gt;The stubbles get cut off without any pulling of the hairs.&lt;br /&gt;The pop-up trimmer works great when pulled across longer hairs at a 90 degree angle to the skin.</li>
      <li>I have used this razor for three years without replacing the foil and consider it a great razor.</li>
      <li>If you aren&#x27;t happy it can always be returned.</li>
      <li>I used it for about 4 years and it worked great.</li>

      <li>I have used many shavers and this one is one of the best.</li>

      <li>To each his own, though.</li>
      <li>This is a nice razor for the price.</li>
      <li>He couldn&#x27;t find one elsewhere and was thrilled when I found it here.</li>
      <li>Good looking product, easy to handle, but not for my beard.</li>
      <li>Good for men with light beards.</li>
      <li>gives a good clean shave.  </li>
      <li>EI find them easy to clean and holds a great charge.  </li>
      <li>At first it seemed like it did a great job, getting 99% of the whiskers.  </li>
      <li>I would suggest buying it instead because it is a much better shaver, even though it is Factory Reconditioned.</li>
      <li>Much better.</li>
      <li>Yes, probably as well as most electric shavers.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Better than the Norelco I was using before.</li>
      <li>It is lighter and ergonomically better, easier to handle.</li>
      <li>A rotary blade may work better?</li>
      <li>Great value for a reasonable price.</li>
      <li>This may be the best of my razors yet especially at the price.</li>
      <li>The shaving head could be made a lot better.</li>
      <li>Shaving took a bit longer, but I was surprisingly pleased with the closeness of the resulting shave.</li>
      <li>You don&#x27;t need to spend 100.00 or more on an electric shaver.</li>
      <li>This is an OK razor.</li>
      <li>the top falls off.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s even better when you consider how cheap it is!</li>
      <li>My husband was pleased.</li>
      <li>its okay.</li>
      <li>I have been using this model for many years, and know how to use it to get the closest shave.</li>
      <li>I know Remington can do better.  </li>
      <li>Have been using electric shavers for over 50 years, mostly Remingtons.</li>
      <li>okay</li>
      <li>A MUCH BETTER RESULT</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used Remington shavers for many years and like them.  </li>
      <li>in all, it&#x27;s better than I</li>
      <li>Have had this model for more than a year with no complaints.</li>
      <li>Glad we found you web site.  </li>
      <li>Happens with most things.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It is basically a cheap and noisy razor that kind of works</li>
      <li>I used to have an older xlr3000 which was great.</li>
      <li>This thing is great for the price, I buy a new one every 1-2 years.</li>
      <li>A great buy for great but not a fantastic shaver.</li>
      <li>fine for me and glad they keep including a trimmer.</li>
      <li>It still shaves very good, though it doesn&#x27;t quite use the entire width of the foil, which is a shame.  </li>
      <li>I have used an electric razor for over 50 years and have tried most all of the brands from cheap to $250.</li>
      <li>You can use the original cutter in this F3790, and it will give a slightly better shave too I&#x27;ve found.  </li>
      <li>It is easy to hold and maneuver, and the shave is close.</li>
      <li>For the price this really is a good shaver, and I like it better than any I&#x27;ve used so far.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;But if the cover falls off the foil can easily be damaged and the shaver will be useless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
      <li>Great battery life, charges fast, and super easy to clean with the brush that comes with it.</li>
      <li>It was competitively priced, arrived as scheduled, and works just fine.  </li>
      <li>For now it is fine.</li>
      <li>He said it works fine.</li>
      <li>Everything works fine, except at times</li>
      <li>works fine ,but doesn&#x27;t cut too well</li>
      <li>The flip up thing on the back is very handy, and the top quickly removes stubble.</li>
      <li>Does not give me a smooth shave and the pop-up trimmer is inefficient.</li>
      <li>I HAVE RETURNED IT FOR A NORELCO THAT LEAVES MY FACE ULTRA SMOOTH AND WELL GROOMED.</li>
      <li>Still, this F3790 was free...</li>
      <li>Cheap, works.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> a good shaver for the money Had a triple but was hard to clean. Seems like foil works for me. Somewhat noisy motor,&lt;br /&gt;But all in all, rates four stars.</li>
    <li> This is the worst Remington shaver I&#x27;ve ever bought.  After using it 2 or three times, I did not get a clean shave.  Tried using it with many strokes, in every direction and with various pressure ... still rough chin, neck and mustache area!!  Too bad I had already tossed box and wrapping: so I can&#x27;t return it.  Foil electric shavers are the only ones I use to rely on; rotating heads (like Norelcos) are useless.  Beware of the Remington F3790!!</li>
    <li> I have used many Remington shavers in 60 years of shaving electrically, and this one gives the worst results of any.  It leaves many hairs behind even when making 2 or 3 passes in various directions.  On the positive side, the areas it does cut are very close.  Sometimes I will shave with my old DA307 model and shave again with this one, which provides a close shave.  I suppose if I shaved 2 or 3 times a day with this one I would be clean shaven all the time, but I&#x27;m not up for that much shaving.</li>
    <li> It does the trick for me.  The only minus is the on/off switch&#x27;s slippery chrome finish.  Although it&#x27;s a different model that may be out of production, my previous Remington DA-307&#x27;s switch had synthetic rubber that gripped wet or dry.</li>
    <li> I bought this razor for my husband. He and I like it a lot. I like a clean shaven face and he likes to shave with it.&lt;br /&gt;  Thank you,&lt;br /&gt;  Sarah Boston</li>
    <li> the shaver works well enough - doesn&#x27;t give as close a shave as my husband would like but its okay.</li>
    <li> great product....works great</li>
    <li> I purchased this shaver not quite a year ago, in fact I have only had it about  nine months. At eight months, the pop-up trimmer broke and I had to use duct tape to hold it down so I could use the rest of the shaver. I have a Remington DA-307 which I have had for three or four years. It is a much better quality shaver and is built much more solidly than this cheap piece of c***! Amazon still sells the Da-307 in a Factory Reconditioned model. I would suggest buying it instead because it is a much better shaver, even though it is Factory Reconditioned. Apparently Remington has begun building lower quality shavers, at least in the cheaper models, so I would suggest not buying this one! Thanks.</li>
    <li> The shaver I received was the noisiest one I ever owned.  It vibrated so much that I could not get any kind of a shave completed.</li>
    <li> Shipping box not strong enough . It was taped up with parts loose in side although not damaged.  I tried  shaving and was disappointed. It not as good as my old one.  It left stubs. had to use my old one that&#x27;s ten years old. Also a remington</li>
    <li> I did not find it at all effective. The only electric shavers used previously was the 3 rotor type. Much better.</li>
    <li> This is the second one we bought . My older son has had one for about 3 years and it has worked well . So now my younger son got the same one .  He did his frist shave the other day and it went well .</li>
    <li> For inexpensive razor does a great job.</li>
    <li> This thing is awesome. My 3rd one. I buy new one instead of replacement foil and blade. 25 bucks, not the clsest of shaves, but is great to get the nubs off. I have a more expensive Panasonic  i use late in day to get the closer shave. Very durable. a Great 2ndary razor or for travel. You cant kill this thing. Remington hit a homerun with this model.</li>
    <li> I have used many shavers and this one is one of the best. it is small enough to fit in a small carry bag and strong enough to get 5 or more shaves on one charge.</li>
    <li> I used this shaver a couple times, the foil is easy fall off, it is very dangerous. Adapter is old style, it can&#x27;t be wire shaver. Voltage is 110V only. I don&#x27;t like it.</li>
    <li> I bought the Remington F3790 for my husband.  He had two Norelcos which not longer worked and suggested the Remington.  He said it works fine. Had it for almost a month.</li>
    <li> Gives a great shave and does not irritate my skin.</li>
    <li> Was looking for a low cost alternative to my old Remington razor and found this one.  It was competitively priced, arrived as scheduled, and works just fine.  Would buy from this vendor again.</li>
    <li> After a few weeks it failed to shave properly . Now, it is useless. It does not even shave the lightest beard.</li>
    <li> I used it for about 4 years and it worked great. However the back part that pops out had fallen off a few times. Overall it&#x27;s a great product, just keep it clean and be gentle with it.</li>
    <li> UPDATE 7/22/12&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve upgraded this from 3 to 4 stars because it&#x27;s been so usefull on those days when I need a quick shave, and because the battery lasts a L O N G time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, it&#x27;s better than I expected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I normally use disposable razors. When they start to dull I just toss them away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But a sudden hot water heater problem (needs to be replaced) caused me to look for an electric shaver. So I don&#x27;t need \\&quot;The Best In The World\\&quot; electric shaver. Just one that works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So from that perspective, does it work? Yes, probably as well as most electric shavers.&lt;br /&gt;The skin feels clean-shaven after using it.&lt;br /&gt;The stubbles get cut off without any pulling of the hairs.&lt;br /&gt;The pop-up trimmer works great when pulled across longer hairs at a 90 degree angle to the skin. Almost as well as the shaver itself!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BUT;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not as close as a razorblade.&lt;br /&gt;If the hairs are even slightly long this electric shaver will pass right over it. It works by having the stubble pass thru the holes in the screen where they get cut off. A rotary blade may work better? Haven&#x27;t a clue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would give this shaver a higher score except for one thing, the plastic cover/screen protector. It&#x27;s held on by good will and little else. Look at it and it&#x27;ll fall off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some may say that you should rate a product only by how well it does its job. In that vain I&#x27;d, maybe, give it four stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But if the cover falls off the foil can easily be damaged and the shaver will be useless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the low price, and with no intention of trying to travel with it, I can definitely recommend it. But not as a preferred way to shave. To each his own, though.</li>
    <li> very nice razor, works great and the price is right.  would certainly recommend this razor for everyone and will probably purchase in the future for my sons as gifts.</li>
    <li> It is cheap.  Works fine and last longer than many other cutters and foil.  Would and will purchase again if needed.</li>
    <li> Top of the line appliance, great price!  Highly recommended for those that want a good razor and a reasonable price.</li>
    <li> Great shaver.  It gives a close shave and never a problem.&lt;br /&gt;Lite weight, great for travel, heads last a long time.</li>
    <li> 2nd identical electric shaver my husband has owned.  He left a cord in a hotel room and it was about as cheap to buy a new electric shaver.  He use it nearly daily as he does a good job trimming his beard.</li>
    <li> Good shaver for the money. Was delivered early! Plastic construction is bit cheap though.Very powerful for a small razor. Good for men with light beards.</li>
    <li> I have been using Remington shavers for years.  EI find them easy to clean and holds a great charge.  Highly recommended</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve gone through a couple of these (lasted for years and years). I&#x27;ve always been satisfied, they&#x27;re very affordable. It may be individual, works for some, others may have an easier time using a different shaver type.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the price they&#x27;ve always been a great bargain for me. They are a little louder than some but I certainly don&#x27;t expect super expensive shaver features at this price. When new they seem quiet, after a year or so dust and hair works its way inside I guess. Happens with most things.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Work fine for me and glad they keep including a trimmer.</li>
    <li> Owned the same one years ago where I paid $100. Needed a new one as the foil had a hole in yet and decided to look for the same razor. Paid $28 for it now and worth every penny. Long battery life too.</li>
    <li> I ordered this as part of a Christmas gift bundle for a senior , since I was picking up several items I tried to keep costs down and went for a lower quality razor, the metal that is over the blades is very thin, when it was shipped it was loose in the box, so by the time it got to my house the metal was damaged from rolling around in the box.</li>
    <li> Flexing foil had a hole in it making it unusable! Great shaver but the replacement foil and razors are more expensive then the new shaver.</li>
    <li> My 93 yr old dad loved this razor so much he wore it out.  He couldn&#x27;t find one elsewhere and was thrilled when I found it here. Fast service and what he wanted!</li>
    <li> I broke it as soon as I got it cuz i dropped it but fixed it and now it works perfect. Great for trimming.</li>
    <li> This Shaving razor is for my 94-year-old father., he has essential tremor. This is similar to Parkinson&#x27;s and the shaking of the hands. He has used  this particular razor for years. However the new one seems to be superior to the previous models that he purchased to the past. The price is an excellent value for the model purchased.</li>
    <li> It did not give a close shave like advertised and it irritated my skin. It took me forever to get the whiskers cut and after all that time my shave was not close.</li>
    <li> This was a Father&#x27;s Day gift.  My husband was pleased.</li>
    <li> Everything works fine, except at times the top falls off. As if it doesn&#x27;t fit right.</li>
    <li> works fine ,but doesn&#x27;t cut too well--you get what you pay for-but the other more expensive shavers are no better-very disappointed in remington!</li>
    <li> Great razor, low price</li>
    <li> This replaced an older F3790, which broke. I can go 3 or 4 days without shaving and then I use the F3790 to get my whiskers short enough to do a painless wet shave afterwards.</li>
    <li> It was not the one i wanted but close to it.</li>
    <li> This was a present for my husband.  He is a Remington man.  He just loves the Remington shavers and won&#x27;t use any other.</li>
    <li> Cheap, works.  Almost cheaper than buy replacement cutters.  Second one I&#x27;ve had in 5 years.  I&#x27;d buy this from these guys again.</li>
    <li> It is light and charges normally. I bought because of the price. If it lasts 2 years, I can write another review. For now it is fine.</li>
    <li> It is lighter and ergonomically better, easier to handle. Better than the Norelco I was using before. Less costly also</li>
    <li> Just what we were looking for Thank you. This is just perfect. Glad we found you web site.  Thanks again.</li>
    <li> This is the 2nd F3790 shaver I have had and I like the product. There are a lot of shavers out there but a lot don&#x27;t work for me. Price was reasonable.</li>
    <li> For the price this really is a good shaver, and I like it better than any I&#x27;ve used so far.  Once allowed the initial 12 hour charge it runs for a good 40 minutes or more.  It&#x27;s easy to clean as these types generally are, but be careful when removing the shaver head as the cutter sits on a post under spring tension;  it can fly off if it gets rotated while the head is being removed, and might end up going down the sink drain unless there&#x27;s a drain screen or something to catch it.  Replacing the cutter back on the spring post is a bit tricky as it needs to first be seated 90 degrees, then turned to line up with the shaver, at which point it stays on.</li>
    <li> For many years I have been happily shaving with a safety razor, sort of anti-electric. Then I had a stroke, and the first time I tried to shave in the rehab hospital I about cut my face off. The therapist informed me that I would have to buy an electric razor. So I bought this Remington after reading some of the reviews, and it saved my face. Shaving took a bit longer, but I was surprisingly pleased with the closeness of the resulting shave. I have made a tremendous recovery from my stroke of 8 months ago, but I am still using my Remington about 3 times a week.</li>
    <li> The shaving head could be made a lot better. The blades on the razor don&#x27;t hold a sharp edge very long.</li>
    <li> This product does a great job at a great price.  The shave is as close as I have gotten with any electric, the battery holds its charge for a more than adequate length of time, it is easy to clean and, to top it all off, it is very compact and light for travel.  The features are basic--two-head shaver and trimmer--but that is all I require.</li>
    <li> that was the worst mistake i ever made ordering that it stop working all of a sudden what a waist of twenty dollar</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried a few different electric shavers and this is the best! It&#x27;s even better when you consider how cheap it is! I originally shaved with Gillette Sensor XL disposable razor blades and tried a few others, but the blades almost always cut my face up.  I have a thick, dark beard and a pale complexion, so I have to shave against the grain. If I don&#x27;t, my wife says it looks like I still have stubble.  But doing that always left my face red as a tomato, and sometimes bleeding.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried an expensive $90.00 Norelco electric shaver and a $150.00 Braun shaver. They both left some stubble on my face. I bought the Remington F3 on a whim when I saw it in CVS, and it turned out better than those expensive shavers. Sure, it feels like a slightly cheaper construction when you hold it and it is a little loud, but it works 99% as close as a razor if you go over a few times against the grain!!!</li>
    <li> Remington F3790&lt;br /&gt;Worst shaver I ever used.  It was inexpensive, but a waste of money.  Shave is terrible, better to use a butter knife.  Why would Remington put thier name on such a poor product.</li>
    <li> DID NOT WORK, AT ALL, HAD TO RETURN IT. VERY BAD EXPERIANCE! THIS WAS THE FIRST TIME THIS HAS HAPPENED ,HOPE IT IS THE LAST.</li>
    <li> Great, it was a gifth to my son. He loves it!</li>
    <li> I had to return the razor to Remington because the on and off switch stuck and the blades were not working.</li>
    <li> The batteries in these things don&#x27;t last very long.</li>
    <li> Gets the job done but not the greatest.</li>
    <li> I have had this model of shaver for years.  It gives a nice close shave.</li>
    <li> I depend on the reviews of others when making a purchase so here is mine. I have used it for about a month now.  I have used an electric razor for over 50 years and have tried most all of the brands from cheap to $250. Foil and rotary. My beard is light enough to maybe miss a day without looking as though I really needed a shave.  At 76 my skin is not tight.  Now I bought this razor for $18 new and factory packaged so shop around Amazon. It is amazing. The cons are that it is a bit loud but not enough to wake the household and remember it is only three or four inches from your ears.  It has no low battery indicator so when you hear it run down you have about 10 seconds before it stops.  Charging it overnight once a week keeps it charged for me.  For some reason it does have a LED light to tell you it is charging and goes out only when you unplug it.  If it is plugged in to the wall it seems to me that is enough indication to tell you it is charging! The plastic protection cap clips on okay but if you travel it needs a band aid or piece of tape to keep it in place.  It does not come with a travel kit.  It does have a brush.  I get a very close shave in 4 maybe 5 minutes.  The popup trimmer works well for longer hairs that do not make it through the foil openings.  Using light slow strokes so as to not mash down the facial hairs works well on any electric razor.  It has a one or two year guarantee and I think they recommend replacing the blades and foil once a year.  At my purchase price of $18 I imaging that&#x27;s cheaper then buying the replacement parts.  This may be the best of my razors yet especially at the price.</li>
    <li> Works well replaced a similar model.  They should put the plastic guard over the screen for shipping to prevent it from being damaged.  Mine was located in  plastic parts bag.  Screen was dented but not broken  Unit works well gives a good clean shave.  Price is very reasonable compared to just buying a replacement screen</li>
    <li> I bought this shave to replace a 10 year old Remington Titanium 5100 and it does what I need. I use it to shave me head. This shaver cost about the same as replacement heads for my old 5100 and is much smaller, lighter and quieter than the 5100.</li>
    <li> This razor carries a low price, but it shaves quickly and well. It is easy to hold and maneuver, and the shave is close. The trimmer is efficient, almost too efficient.  Great value for a reasonable price.</li>
    <li> Due to a medical problem, I decided to give up blade-shaving and try an electric.  Since I thought this would be temporary, I bought the Remington F3790 because it was so inexpensive.  Having used it now for about 7 months, I find that it is actually a good little shaver and more than worth the price.  It does take a few weeks for your beard to adapt to it and for the shaver to work more effectively.  I now like it so much that I will probably not go back to blade-shaving and went on Amazon to look into the blade replacement kit for the Remington.  The shaver holds its charge for a good long time - maybe two weeks.  I run mine until it stops, then charge it for 24 hours.  This product is much better than expected.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s lightweight and the battery lasts a long time.  The blades cut a lot closer than my previous electric razor.</li>
    <li> Have been using electric shavers for over 50 years, mostly Remingtons. Have had this model for more than a year with no complaints. Had to replace the screen/blade once but that is all. Battery lasts for a week for me. I charge it every Saturday. Cuts close enough that my face feels smooth.</li>
    <li> I have used Braun,Panasonic,Norelco and Wahl and this inexpensive shaver does a very good job. I have a heavy beard and I admit it takes longer than 3 minutes for a shave but so did its expensive competition.I have seen it sale at some big box stores for $19.97. A great buy for great but not a fantastic shaver. If you aren&#x27;t happy it can always be returned.</li>
    <li> It cuts the hair...eventually.  I have to pass over the same areas over and over to get all the hairs.  I bought the item to try to save time on mornings when time is short, but it actually takes longer.  It will now only serve as a convenience when I don&#x27;t want to take shaving cream with me somewhere.  Shaving with my razor is both faster, and gives me a better shave with a less frustrating experience.</li>
    <li> Trying to replace an older model, MS290, this is no where near comparable.  Will have to look to another brand.  Remington really messed up when they discontinued that style.</li>
    <li> This shaver is not the best but for the price it is a very good shaver. I recommended this shaver</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t come close to giving a smooth shave.  I used to have an older xlr3000 which was great. I&#x27;m sorry I bought the F3970 and have lost all confidence in the newer Remington product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My older Norelco rotary shaver does a much better job.  About the only good thing about the F3970 is the side burn trimmer.</li>
    <li> The shaver repeatedly failed to take and hold a charge and the cutter head tended to tear rather than to cut cleanly.  I know Remington can do better.  Sorry they didn&#x27;t this time.</li>
    <li> I have used this razor for three years without replacing the foil and consider it a great razor. Bought another August 2013 from Amazon, and the trimmer broke off yesterday when opening. Just bought another Remington of similar type (an F3) at Walmart for $29.00 as the price of this one has almost doubled since last August. Would not recommend this particular model again.</li>
    <li> PURCHASED MAY 2113 AND POP UP TRIMMED JUST BROKE OFF AND IT NEVER DID A GOOD JOB ON SLIGHTLY LONGER HAIRS HAD TO USE THE TRIMMER FOR THESE BECAUSE THE FOIL RAZOR FAILED TO CUT THESE ON ANY PART OF THE SHAVING AREAS FOR THIS REASON GOING BACK TO THE NORELCO BRAND WHICH I FEEL PROVIDES A MUCH BETTER RESULT</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Remington shavers for many years and like them.  This purchase was a replacement for the same model that broke after a few short months.  The plastic trimmer retainer hinges broke making the trimmer useless.  So far the new one is doing fine.</li>
    <li> this was a gift for my dad.  his quit working and he wanted the same kinds he had before.  he was very happy to get this.</li>
    <li> The product was received earlier than expected.  It however was not the razor I needed with a thick and course beard..the razor would not cut through it at all.  Good looking product, easy to handle, but not for my beard.</li>
    <li> Great for the price and free shipping.  I wish I could have waited and saved for a better shaver, a closer shave--like the wet-dry model I bought last year--from the same company.  I needed something now, and bought this model.</li>
    <li> Considering it was only $25, It&#x27;s a good shaver. I used it for 6 months, and it worked well. The foil broke in 2 spots over 6 months, although I have no idea how. I just went out today to replace it, and got the same one. It&#x27;s way less than half the price of just about any other shaver in stores. The flip up thing on the back is very handy, and the top quickly removes stubble. Takes about 5 minutes to shave if you haven&#x27;t in awhile. Also, the battery lasts FOREVER. I usually left it plugged in while I wasn&#x27;t using it, but if I chose not to, I could probably go a month or two without charging it. So here are my thoughts in list form.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;-Least expensive electric shaver available ($25)&lt;br /&gt;-Gets the job done in reasonable time&lt;br /&gt;-Battery life lasts a very long time&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;-Foils break easily and replacements are expensive ($18)&lt;br /&gt;-It&#x27;s rather noisy compared to other shavers, but not a big deal</li>
    <li> I bought this razor to leave at my week end place. It shaves well is lightweight and fit my needs perfectly. About the 4th use a hole appeared in one of the screens, having used Remington&#x27;s for years I realize a burr or any litle bump can damage the screen and cause this to happen. I wasn&#x27;t prepared for the price of a new screen. The razor cost $23 and a new screen cost $18 to $25 depending on who you want to source from. I will probably throw it away and buy a new one even though there&#x27;s nothing else wrong with it. I will look at other mfgr&#x27;s reviews to see if a more reasonable product is available.</li>
    <li> Understandably, this is a very low cost electric shaver and you generally get what you pay for.  In this case, you don’t even get that.  This device is nearly useless as a shaver (it is impossible to get a close shave) and it is difficult to use as a trimmer.  I used a low-cost Remington electric shaver for a number of years (it was discontinued) with very good results.  I thought this might be its replacement.  Avoid making my mistake and stay away from this one.</li>
    <li> shaves VERY POORLY.  therefore, i don&#x27;t use it. hardly cuts the  minimum. i reverted to basic razor  or my 25 yr old norelco</li>
    <li> Hard to find in stores these days and was looking for this type of Remington electric shaver.  I am very pleased with it.</li>
    <li> I got this to cut my shorter hairs.  This did not accomplish that task.  I can still use the trimmer on it, but I already had a trimmer.</li>
    <li> This thing is great for the price, I buy a new one every 1-2 years. My skin hates real razors and this works for sensitive skin,  the pop out part is good for longer hairs. You don&#x27;t need to spend 100.00 or more on an electric shaver.</li>
    <li> I find these shavers to be better than any other, MUCH more expensive shavers.  It works for a LONG time, it is rechargable, and it is FAR less money than those more expensive shavers that do not work as well.  You cannot go wrong with these.</li>
    <li> Great battery life, charges fast, and super easy to clean with the brush that comes with it. Overall, a simple, awesome shaver.</li>
    <li> Unless you&#x27;re looking for an electric razor which gives you a look similar to that worn by Don Johnson during his \\&quot;Miami Vice\\&quot; days, I recommend you consider an alternative to this product.  While the \\&quot;pop-out\\&quot; trimmer works wonderfully, the foil shaver is incredibly ineffective.  Instead of a close, smooth shave, in five uses of this product I&#x27;ve had the aforementioned \\&quot;Miami Vice\\&quot; stubble - not at all the quality shave I&#x27;d hoped for.</li>
    <li> Does not give me a smooth shave and the pop-up trimmer is inefficient.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve shaved with everything from a straight razor through all manner of bladed razors and even inclufing electric razors 30-40 years ago. Now, I have a full beard - I don&#x27;t even trim the shape of the beard on my face - but I do shave my neck. About a year ago, I tried switching from a current 5 bladed razor to a Remington rotary type electric. It shave closely, but left my neck somewhat irritated in a few hypersensitive spot. So, I decided to try the Remington Foil razor - even lest expensive. With this razor, I don&#x27;t shave quite as closely, but no trace of irritation!! I am delighted!</li>
    <li> I wanted only the blade and accidentaly ordered the razor. I&#x27;d have gotten a different one had I realized what I was doing.</li>
    <li> THIS IS A HUNK OF JUNK.  IT LEAVES LOADS OF STUBBLE--EVEN IF YOU FOLLOW THE TIPS AND IDEAS IN THE INSTRUCTIONS.  I HAVE RETURNED IT FOR A NORELCO THAT LEAVES MY FACE ULTRA SMOOTH AND WELL GROOMED.</li>
    <li> This is a nice razor for the price. Quickly charges and cleans up very fast. Great gift item for upcoming Father&#x27;s Day.</li>
    <li> is a good product but the razor is very small, a very thick beards for, must be changed to serve in that case</li>
    <li> This inexpensive shaver was free because my previous Remington rechargeable quit running.  It is not as good as previous Remingtons but still uses the dual foil so it cuts quite close.  But as these rechargeable battery-operated shavers die, I want a corded electric.  Remington only makes one and it is a rotary, so i bought the Braun 130-S which is very good.  But this is good and it does vibrate quite a bit in your hand.  Update 4/3/15:  I returned the inexpensive Brauns as they were taking about 8 minutes to shave and the motors sounded very strained.  This F3790 shaver is a rechargeable so it is not a long life shaver.  But I was able, through Amazon, to buy two brand new, factory sealed Remington Microscreen 2, CORD ONLY shavers.  Since my dying rechargeable shavers parts fit these new ones, I&#x27;ll keep those parts as the rechargeables die which they are now doing.  Now, with these new corded Remington Microscreens, I never have to worry about batteries or waiting 12 hours to charge my shaver.  Plus, these cord only Remingtons are quiet and don&#x27;t vibrate.  Still, this F3790 was free...it cuts well but is noisy and vibrates a lot through my fingers.  Very important, this shaver has the smaller cutter.  Remington shrunk the normal cutter for its Microscreens by about one-fourth of an inch.  It still shaves very good, though it doesn&#x27;t quite use the entire width of the foil, which is a shame.  I was able to get the original size cutters in my corded Remingtons, but most cutters you buy will be the new smaller one.  You can use the original cutter in this F3790, and it will give a slightly better shave too I&#x27;ve found.  Overall, this is a very good shaver; not great, but very good and decently priced.</li>
    <li> This is by no means the best electric razor out there, but it gets the job done for me. I have sensitive skin and I can use this razor without breaking out, and that&#x27;s pretty much all I&#x27;m looking for.</li>
    <li> This was a gift!! He loved it.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks!!</li>
    <li> This F3790 shaver is a good value. It does not cut as close as a safety blade, but doesn&#x27;t nick my face like a safety blade. I have been using this model for many years, and know how to use it to get the closest shave. Some complain about it not easily cutting 3 day old beards, but if you use the trimmer to shorten the 3 day&#x27;s growth hair first, then use the foil cutters, you can get a close cut.</li>
    <li> This is an OK razor. If I go over and over my face long enough it gets the job done. I just didn&#x27;t want to spend a lot of money. I guess you get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> Great for the price, not super close of a shave, but it does the trick if you have the time to take a close meticulous amount of time to shave.  it is not for someone in a hurry who needs a great clean shave in less than 2 minutes.</li>
    <li> charged as told tried to shave 3 times never shaved we tried over and over again still looked like he needed a shave</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this razor for 2 weeks.  At first it seemed like it did a great job, getting 99% of the whiskers.  Now it consistently leaves whiskers that for some reason it can&#x27;t cut despite trying all kinds of up/down/left/right/circular motions on the area.  So at that point I get out my 3 year old razor and try to finish off these areas.  It is basically a cheap and noisy razor that kind of works but if you don&#x27;t want to waste a lot of extra time trying to get all the whiskers then spend more money.  Of course spending more money may just mean you will be more frustrated when that one doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
    <li> I brought my first one 5-7 years ago and still works but foil is worn and decided to just buy a whole new unit and keep the old one for when I travel.  The new shaver is identical to the one I brought years ago.  For the price, this shaver works great.  I highly recommend this shaver.</li>
    <li> I HAVE HAD THIS MODEL # BEFORE AND THIS ONE DOESN&#x27;T SEEM TO CUT AS WELL AS THE PREVIOUS ONES.</li>
    <li> This inexpensive shaver does a good job - especially for the price.  I would recommend this razor for anyone, especially with a heavy beard!</li>
</ol>
