    <li> Had a bad reaction. The serum caused a chemical burn around my eyes</li>
    <li> I see no difference in this product they suggested to be used with Beau Cream which I ordered as well and it was old and I would not recommend either of these products.</li>
    <li> SCAM!!!!!!!!! Don&#x27;t buy this garbage!!  Had a horrible reaction...made me look OLDER not younger and then the company charged me after I cancelled it....  Shame on Dr Oz for recommending it!</li>
    <li> I received trail of eye serum it caused a bad  red,itchy eye irritation my eyes have not felt right since   It feels like a layer of my skin ,around the eyes were burned by the eye cream   anyone who is thinking of ordering DO NOT  It has something in it  that is not good for the shin around your eyes. trust me  !! Paula from Ohio</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know about the reseller, but Revita Eye is a total scam. I purchased a sample size, somehow I&#x27;m enrolled in a monthly program at 90/bucks a month.  Could only cancel by paying 50pct off the 90 dollar regular price.</li>
    <li> People have been asking me what I&#x27;ve been doing...that my eyes don&#x27;t have any lines under them like before (l used this product). I love it!!!</li>
    <li> I was just like all of you, it burned the minute I put it on, then it was like a chemical burn, but I noticed that my skin started feeling tight.  My face did peel in places and even the sun damage spots started flaking off and I had several red spots, but all of that is going away.  I have used for a month and I feel like my face is better than before.  I am 66 years old and I will continue to use this.  You just have to be patient and it will get better. Rita</li>
    <li> My face became very dry and itchy and started peeling.  I also got red patches so I was allergic to it!</li>
    <li> work&#x27;s great!! looking better</li>
    <li> I suffer from very dry skin--especially around eyes. This product works great!</li>
    <li> This serum burned my skin.</li>
    <li> This product burned my skin and my eyes swelled up. I looked like a different person. I was embarrassed to leave the house. I got charged 89.00 too.  What a scam!!!  I guess I learned a really good lesson. Don&#x27;t trust these products advertised on line.</li>
    <li> After 4 weeks I have noticed no difference.</li>
    <li> very harsh product  it burned all around my eyes gave me leathery look which took about a week to get rid of plus the company is a scam just like their sister product beau derma  stay away from both of them</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t use this product, It burned as soon as I applied it the first time. Then when I went to clean it off, it was like glue, it took me days to get the skin under my eyes to get soft again.</li>
    <li> This is the worst product I have  ever tried, they charged me $600 for a free trial!!!! it is a total scam!!!!</li>
    <li> The biggest Scam! Don&#x27;t be another victim!</li>
    <li> This is a scam. The product didn&#x27;t even come with any paperwork or instructions. Luckily I used a prepaid card that only has 6 dollars on it because when you order from an ad It might nott work out and they charge your card anyway. The joke is on them this time!LOL  This stuff is no better than a dollar store eye cream!</li>
    <li> This is the worse eye serum I have ever tried.  As the other person reported it burns the skin.  I have returned to my previous serum and am trying to get my under eye area back to normal.  I didn&#x27;t buy this from Amazon but online through an ad.  Don&#x27;t do it.</li>
    <li> I hate it.  This was a total scam.  Somewhere it stated it was a 14 day trial and then they charged me $89.00.  The product gave me wrinkles!  Their sister product Beau Derma did absolutely nothing.  Total rip off - don&#x27;t fall for it.</li>
    <li> This product  works well.</li>
