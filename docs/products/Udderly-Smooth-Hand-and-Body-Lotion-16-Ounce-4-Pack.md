      <li>IT MIGHT NOT BE BEST FOR YOU BUT ITS GREAT FOR EVERYDAY USE....</li>
      <li>The cream one is better all the way around.</li>
      <li>I have found that the jars and the pump bottle mixtures hold up much better than the tubes.  </li>
      <li>After discovering this lotion many years ago I&#x27;m never without it.  </li>
      <li>I have to unscrew the top and poke at it to get some out.</li>
      <li>It has a nice light fragrance,not offensive.</li>
      <li>Shorts &amp; tank top???  </li>
      <li>I love this lotion for my hands.  </li>
      <li>I loved the original Udderly Smooth lotion, and thought it helped my hands.</li>
      <li>ThiS MOISTURIZER IS PRETTY GOOD...</li>
      <li>I can attest that it&#x27;s wonderful for extremely dry skin (even eczema)!</li>
      <li>OMG this smells fabulous and love the pump bottle.</li>
      <li>I would only use this as a hand lotion...not great as a body lotion.</li>
      <li>They furnished the lotion - Udderly Smooth.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried the Udderly Smooth Cream in the tubs</li>
      <li>I bought this because the label is so cute and the price was right.</li>
      <li>Dries quickly and without strong odor.</li>
      <li>I do love the jars and can&#x27;t imagine having to live without Udderly Smooth in my life!</li>
      <li>A nice lotion, quick absorbing and doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy feeling on your hands.  </li>
      <li>I like the way it goes on your skin,not greasy and really makes my skin feel more comfortable.</li>
      <li>The waving of the shipping cost for spending a certain amount was a plus because I was able to also purchase a book that I&#x27;ve been wanting.  </li>
      <li>Recently purchased this product and was happy to find an old standby that I have not been able to find for some time.</li>
      <li>It absorbs quickly.</li>
      <li>I found out about this after trying other  products and this is the best for daily use.</li>
      <li>this is nothing like the original udderly smooth utter butter.</li>
      <li>So far the bottles have been fine and if I find they go watery on me</li>
      <li>If you crochet or knit or sew, it&#x27;s great for keeping hands soft and not getting lotion on your material or yarn!</li>
      <li>This stuff keeps my hands, face and body smooth and soft.  </li>
      <li>Thanks, Amazon!</li>
      <li>Imagine what the result would be if you are younger and more beautiful/handsome to start with.  </li>
      <li>I am glad I discovered them for my kids and my dry skin.</li>
      <li>Since it isn&#x27;t particularly moisturizing or great smelling, I slather it on after each shower so that don&#x27;t waste my nicer lotions on frequent applications.</li>
      <li>It was very watered down, no one that used it liked it.</li>
      <li>It is very watery and the container does not pump well.</li>
      <li>Really like this lotion.</li>
      <li>I prefer this above every other skin product I have tried and there have been very many.  </li>
      <li>So much better than any lotion I have previously used.  </li>
      <li>The water percentage in this product is a bit high for my use, it&#x27;s almost like using nothing at all.  </li>
      <li>It is non greasy and really works to keep your hands soft.</li>
      <li>Nice lotion but too thick for a pump</li>
      <li>I bought it because I liked Udderly Smooth Cream, but this lotion has been disappointing.  </li>
      <li>Vanity isn&#x27;t one of my vices, but it&#x27;s nice to look at myself and not think UGLY.  :))))))))))</li>
      <li>Although the price is a little higher than drugstore and supermarket brands, it is well worth the price for me.  </li>
      <li>My old skin loves it.</li>
      <li>My favorite is the cream but for my youngest one who does not like the feel of thick cream on her skin, this is just the answer.</li>
      <li>The lotion is actually more like a cream and does not want to travel through the pump, as it is too thick.  </li>
      <li>This is the best lotion I have found, and I have used some very expensive lotions!</li>
      <li>It does smell a little more feminine than other lotions.</li>
      <li>I have pretty sensitive skin and can&#x27;t tolerate a heavy or greasy product.  </li>
      <li>you start to get empty pumps when the container is still half full</li>

<li> but that&#x27;s a little heavy.  </li>
<li> The lotion is not as thick as other body lotions which I like.</li>
<li> Of course, this is the watered down version of the cream -- this is the LOTION, it&#x27;s supposed to be not as thick as the cream.</li>
<li> There is no better product.</li>
<li> so I&#x27;ve shifted away from the tubes to carry in my purse - sad, so I only buy the jars and now the pump bottles.  </li>
<li> I bought this and it seemed to irritate my hands, although I&#x27;m not sure why.</li>
<li> I wash my hands on work days at least 60 times per day.  </li>

    <li> This lotion smells amazing! I took it to the Keys last week, anticipating heavy usage. OMG this smells fabulous and love the pump bottle. Smells like Roses!</li>

    <li> The only cream I could use with my psoriasis</li>
    <li> I do not like the scent. The lotion is not as thick as other body lotions which I like. It absorbs quickly.</li>
    <li> Udderly smooth products are just great! I am glad I discovered them for my kids and my dry skin.

    <li> After discovering this lotion many years ago I&#x27;m never without it.  I have found that the jars and the pump bottle mixtures hold up much better than the tubes.  The tubes tend to go watery for some reason so I&#x27;ve shifted away from the tubes to carry in my purse - sad, so I only buy the jars and now the pump bottles.  I now carry a small plastic container of the lotion that I transfer from my big jars into the smaller container.  So far the bottles have been fine and if I find they go watery on me I&#x27;ll add an adjustment to my review.  I do love the jars and can&#x27;t imagine having to live without Udderly Smooth in my life!</li>
    <li> I love this lotion for my hands.  I wash my hands on work days at least 60 times per day.  This lotion I can use on my hands, palms and all and it doesn&#x27;t feel greasy.  Dries quickly and without strong odor.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a good summer lotion, because it&#x27;s light and airy.  The water percentage in this product is a bit high for my use, it&#x27;s almost like using nothing at all.  I bought it because I liked Udderly Smooth Cream, but this lotion has been disappointing.  The pump doesn&#x27;t work well either.  I had to take a knife and cut the bottle into halves to get to the rest.</li>
    <li> have given it as gifts------receivers impressed</li>
    <li> Really like this lotion.</li>
    <li> When I was having radiation after breast cancer, the Cancer Center said it was imperative to use a moister lotion daily because radiation dries out the skin.  They furnished the lotion - Udderly Smooth.  This lotion in wonderful!  So much better than any lotion I have previously used.  It has no greasy feel at all.After using all that I was given I found this lotion was not sold anywhere locally.  So, to the computer I went and to my surprise found it on Amazon.  Although the price is a little higher than drugstore and supermarket brands, it is well worth the price for me.  I will use it for life.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this lotion for years and it is great lotion. It is non greasy and really works to keep your hands soft. There is no odor either. If you crochet or knit or sew, it&#x27;s great for keeping hands soft and not getting lotion on your material or yarn!</li>
    <li> I like the way it goes on your skin,not greasy and really makes my skin feel more comfortable. It has a nice light fragrance,not offensive. I would recommend it to all.</li>
    <li> Neighbors .... There&#x27;s not much that can be done with 74 yo sun fried skin, or so I thought.  The sun burn spots are still there, as are the wrinkles.  But now it&#x27;s not alligator skin.  After seven days, my arms actually feel like skin, and look like skin.  Imagine what the result would be if you are younger and more beautiful/handsome to start with.  Bikini???  Shorts &amp; tank top???  Vanity isn&#x27;t one of my vices, but it&#x27;s nice to look at myself and not think UGLY.  :))))))))))</li>
    <li> The lotion is actually more like a cream and does not want to travel through the pump, as it is too thick.  I have to unscrew the top and poke at it to get some out.</li>
    <li> It was very watered down, no one that used it liked it.</li>
    <li> this is nothing like the original udderly smooth utter butter. It is very watery and the container does not pump well. you start to get empty pumps when the container is still half full</li>
