      <li>Works ok.  </li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t say enough about this awesome D.O.!</li>
      <li>and they love it too.</li>
      <li>I have tried and thrown away many brands before discovering Island deodorant.</li>
      <li>She felt safe using this deodorant</li>
      <li>The product goes on smoothly while still giving the same protection as the best antiperspirant.</li>
      <li>Well worth the cost for aluminum-free, effective odor blocking.</li>
      <li>It works on odor and dryness for much longer than most deodorants (like for 24+ hours!).</li>
      <li>This is a great product if you&#x27;re done poisoning yourself with traditional toxic deodorants.</li>
      <li>Best if you use a hair dryer to heat it to soften for a few seconds before using.</li>

      <li>Once I did that, it went on quite smoothly.</li>
      <li>Fantastic product</li>
      <li>Only good if you don&#x27;t mind removing all the hair and skin from under your arms.</li>
      <li>Still, to be fair, I deducted one star since I personally couldn&#x27;t keep using it.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s great, I&#x27;ll never buy any other one.</li>
      <li>I love this one because it is so smooth and soft on my skin.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Be warned: if you get it hot, it changes its consistency and may leave a mark on clothing; however, I have been able to get these marks out with hot water and baking soda scrubbed in with a brush.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this product!!!</li>
      <li>I feel like I want to melt the whole thing and whip it up to make it smooth.</li>
      <li>Instead, I put the stick under my arm and held it there for several seconds, giving it time to warm up a bit.</li>
      <li>The store-bought product that I purchased after this does a far better job for a fraction of the cost.</li>
      <li>No other natural deodorant comes close to being as good as this.</li>
      <li>It is the first deodorant I&#x27;ve ever used that doesn&#x27;t sting when I apply it right after shaving.</li>

      <li>and she absolutely loves it!  </li>
      <li>We get hot humid days during the summer</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried five or six different natural deodorants and none of them were effective at keeping away the stink...except this</li>
      <li>I love that this product has the look, feel , texture and light scent of firm Shea butter.</li>
      <li>I live in Texas and it gets HOT!</li>
      <li>When I&#x27;m ready to apply the deodarant, I just put a little bit of the coconut oil on the top of the stick and it goes on like a charm!</li>
      <li>The same goes for Tom&#x27;s deodorants and so many others I&#x27;ve tried - they barely work and either smell funny or leave your armpits feeling funny.</li>
      <li>A little gritty but works great</li>
      <li>I really want to like this product, but I can&#x27;t get over the smell.</li>
      <li>Would highly recommend this!</li>
      <li>Organic island deodorant really works.</li>

      <li>I work in construction and this product really works</li>
      <li>I really like the feel of it as I apply it -</li>
      <li>I tried so many different natural deodorants that never worked to mask BO smell.</li>
      <li>i remain odor free all day long.</li>
      <li>it is deodorant not antiperspirant) but even after sweating outside all day today in pretty intense heat, no odor.  </li>
      <li>Other than that it works great, and like others, it keeps me dry all day with only natural ingredients.</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t live without this deodorant.</li>
      <li>This deoderant stays fresh and clean all day long, unlike other natural deoderants I&#x27;ve tried in the past.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s the first natural deodorant I&#x27;ve ever used in the Keys that doesn&#x27;t peter out two hours later.</li>
      <li>Make sure the baking soda does not give you any problem, my armpits got a little red while using it.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried lots of natural deodorants with no luck.  </li>
      <li>I tried some natural ones before but they either didnt work  or i smelled like citronella...</li>
      <li>If I don&#x27;t apply my natural Shea butter on for moisture the deodorant sometimes pulls the hairs from my armpits.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been searching for a natural deoderant for awhile now</li>

      <li>I live in Florida and need odor control all year long.  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t really hold this against the product because I have extremely sensitive skin and probably had a reaction to the baking soda (a common irritant in natural deodorants).  </li>

<li> I&#x27;m surprised only one other person commented on the roughness.</li>

<li> Looked for a long time for a deodorant without scent that works.  </li>
<li> Out of habit, I will reapply at least once throughout the day, as the keys are notoriously hot and humid and I have had to do this with other products.  </li>
<li> It works for a full day of work, 10 hours at least!!</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve tried about 8 different natural, aluminum free deodorants recently and this is by far the worst.  </li>
<li> For those of you thinking about purchasing for the first time, but are wary of the price: One stick last me  about 6 months.</li>
<li> My only issue is that it goes on a little rough under my arms.</li>
<li> Not &amp;#34;goopy&amp;#34; or slimy or wet.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s feels rough, like sand paper as another reviewer stated.</li>
<li> it mean it&#x27;ll work better than thin watery ones!</li>
<li> In either case, it&#x27;s a small price to pay to have great protection without all of the nasty ingredients found in commercial deoderants!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> The best so far,I love the smell, day, night but you do have to re-apply it 8 hours later. Make sure the baking soda does not give you any problem, my armpits got a little red while using it.</li>
    <li> Works all day. Best if you use a hair dryer to heat it to soften for a few seconds before using. Fantastic product</li>
    <li> works well, neutral smell nnot perfumed witch is what i wanted, best goes on when damped</li>
    <li> I really wanted to like this deodorant based on how much I spent on it. I did end up finishing the entire stick but my armpits are definitely happier now that they aren&#x27;t getting extreme exfoliation every time I don&#x27;t wanna smell bad. The store-bought product that I purchased after this does a far better job for a fraction of the cost. Lasts way longer too.</li>
    <li> Looked for a long time for a deodorant without scent that works.  My search is over!!  A positive is it also lasts longer than any other.</li>
    <li> Love it! It works for a full day of work, 10 hours at least!! It is a bit stiff. I zapped it for 10 seconds in microwave. Goes on smooth and comfortably.</li>
    <li> This is a good deodorant that lasts all day. My only issue is that it goes on a little rough under my arms. If I don&#x27;t apply my natural Shea butter on for moisture the deodorant sometimes pulls the hairs from my armpits.</li>
    <li> This is the best all natural deodorant on market!  I have tried and thrown away many brands before discovering Island deodorant.</li>
    <li> This deodorant works really well!  Unfortunately, I had some irritation from the deodorant so I had to discontinue use.  I was so bummed because it was working great otherwise.  I don&#x27;t really hold this against the product because I have extremely sensitive skin and probably had a reaction to the baking soda (a common irritant in natural deodorants).  Still, to be fair, I deducted one star since I personally couldn&#x27;t keep using it.  I&#x27;ve tried five or six different natural deodorants and none of them were effective at keeping away the stink...except this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because I couldn&#x27;t continue using it, I ended up giving it to my sister who doesn&#x27;t wear deodorant due to concerns over ingredients.  She felt safe using this deodorant and she absolutely loves it!  No more stinky pits &amp; no irritation whatsoever.  Great product!</li>
    <li> Amazing product. I&#x27;ve tried lots of natural deodorants with no luck.  This one gets the job done.  I still sweat (of course.  it is deodorant not antiperspirant) but even after sweating outside all day today in pretty intense heat, no odor.  So happy I tried this product.</li>
    <li> I have gone through all the brands and nothing works! This one does! I am super impressed. It has no lingering odor either. Would highly recommend this!</li>
    <li> I work in construction and this product really works</li>
    <li> I was skeptical about using a natural deodorant since I&#x27;ve tried others in the past but this one actually works and keeps me from being stinky! :-)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been searching for a natural deoderant for awhile now and I&#x27;m so happy to have found this one! I&#x27;ve tried the vegan and regular types and they are both great! I live in Texas and it gets HOT! This deoderant stays fresh and clean all day long, unlike other natural deoderants I&#x27;ve tried in the past.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The deoderant can be a little &amp;#34;dry&amp;#34; when you apply it. I&#x27;ve found two ways to deal with this. I always keep a jar of coconut oil in my bathroom. When I&#x27;m ready to apply the deodarant, I just put a little bit of the coconut oil on the top of the stick and it goes on like a charm! However, last week, I was traveling and didn&#x27;t have any coconut oil with me. Instead, I put the stick under my arm and held it there for several seconds, giving it time to warm up a bit. Once I did that, it went on quite smoothly. In either case, it&#x27;s a small price to pay to have great protection without all of the nasty ingredients found in commercial deoderants!</li>
    <li> Best natural deodorant that I&#x27;ve tried and I&#x27;ve tried a lot!</li>
    <li> This is great! Not &amp;#34;goopy&amp;#34; or slimy or wet. This is a great product if you&#x27;re done poisoning yourself with traditional toxic deodorants.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s feels rough, like sand paper as another reviewer stated. I feel like I want to melt the whole thing and whip it up to make it smooth. The product actually works well for me but I just don&#x27;t like how it feels when it&#x27;s applied.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried about 8 different natural, aluminum free deodorants recently and this is by far the worst.  If you like rubbing sand paper on your arm pit, this may be the one for you.</li>
    <li> I had used it now for almost a month and my armpits had turned black...odor wise it did help to prevent odor but definitely need to reapply every day. Maybe I&#x27;m allergic to the baking soda i.e. it burns my skin and makes it ugly and black. Sorry I had to throw this one out.</li>
    <li> It definitely works. But I seem to be allergic to it. I broke out in a horrible rash.</li>
    <li> Works ok.  A bit gritty, and I have to apply 2-3 times per day.  Better than most organic deodorants, but not as good as some.</li>
    <li> See my review for the organic version of this stuff.  Save your money and your wardrobe and don&#x27;t buy this.</li>
    <li> Been using natural deodorants for 3 months a this one disappointed me. Not only did it not work but it goes on rough. The texture of this is &amp;#34;crumbly&amp;#34; .</li>
    <li> I wanted to like it, but it feels like coarse sandpaper being applied.  The coarseness turned my arms red, and I&#x27;m not sensitive to products.  White chunks crumbled off as I rubbed it on.  It has no smell at all.  That may be some people&#x27;s preference, so I thought I&#x27;d mention that as well.</li>
    <li> This deodorant kicks ass. No other natural deodorant comes close to being as good as this.</li>
    <li> I really want to like this product, but I can&#x27;t get over the smell. It just doesn&#x27;t react well to me. The texture is great, and it goes on easily. I wish I could wear it.</li>
    <li> I am a runner. I use deodorant every day. This one is so far the best one I have ever tried. I tried some natural ones before but they either didnt work  or i smelled like citronella... Organic island deodorant really works. I love the pleasant smell of coconut. It&#x27;s great, I&#x27;ll never buy any other one. I finally found one that works and is organic, so I don&#x27;t have to worry about absorbing and inhaling bad chemicals on my run. I really really love it!</li>
    <li> This deodorant is perfect.  I live in Florida and need odor control all year long.  I have tried all of the Island Deodorant products.  I love this one because it is so smooth and soft on my skin.  and I get the total odor control that I need.  I have not had an issue with odor at all, surely due to the probiotic ingredients that prevent odor causing bacteria - it&#x27;s the perfect plan.  Build up your good bacteria that fight off odor causing bacteria.  ANd it works!!! I have not had an issue with it damaging clothes either.  I highly recommend this product!!!</li>
    <li> I live in the Florida Keys and obtained this product locally.  I was so pleased to see it offered online! I love that this product has the look, feel , texture and light scent of firm Shea butter. This is not an antiperspirant, so while I still sweat, I do not find that I have any noticable odor to speak of.  Out of habit, I will reapply at least once throughout the day, as the keys are notoriously hot and humid and I have had to do this with other products.  I would just rather not risk it, and it is nice to just freshen up!</li>
    <li> I LOVE Island deodorant! I&#x27;ve tried many &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; deodorants only to be disappointed in them, but this really truly DOES work. We get hot humid days during the summer and i have to say, i remain odor free all day long. I even have my husband and daughter using it and they love it too.</li>
    <li> A little gritty but works great</li>
    <li> Works really well in the desert climate as a deodorant.  It stops body odor without a masking fragrance.</li>
    <li> I gave this three stars only because it feels like sandpaper going on.  I&#x27;m surprised only one other person commented on the roughness. I feel like it is going to take my skin off.  I may use one person&#x27;s trick of warming it in the microwave. Other than that it works great, and like others, it keeps me dry all day with only natural ingredients.</li>
    <li> This product has been one of the best I&#x27;ve ever used. It works on odor and dryness for much longer than most deodorants (like for 24+ hours!). The product goes on smoothly while still giving the same protection as the best antiperspirant.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t live without this deodorant. I can&#x27;t wear--and won&#x27;t wear---antiperspirant. I tried so many different natural deodorants that never worked to mask BO smell. Then I found this stuff!&lt;br /&gt;This stuff always masks the smell, without any reapplications. It has no scent, which is important, because I am sensitive to smells.&lt;br /&gt;Be warned: if you get it hot, it changes its consistency and may leave a mark on clothing; however, I have been able to get these marks out with hot water and baking soda scrubbed in with a brush. For those of you thinking about purchasing for the first time, but are wary of the price: One stick last me  about 6 months. Well worth the cost for aluminum-free, effective odor blocking.</li>
    <li> Only good if you don&#x27;t mind removing all the hair and skin from under your arms.</li>
    <li> I got this product locally in the Keys and was amazed at how well it worked. I used the thai stone for years and was never really stoked about it and thought maybe it&#x27;s the sacrifice you make for using natural deodorant. The same goes for Tom&#x27;s deodorants and so many others I&#x27;ve tried - they barely work and either smell funny or leave your armpits feeling funny. And then Jennifer (the amazing woman who makes this deodorant) introduced me to her stick. It is the first deodorant I&#x27;ve ever used that doesn&#x27;t sting when I apply it right after shaving. It&#x27;s the first natural deodorant I&#x27;ve ever used in the Keys that doesn&#x27;t peter out two hours later. I really like the feel of it as I apply it - it goes on a little thicker than other sticks and to me it mean it&#x27;ll work better than thin watery ones! I can&#x27;t say enough about this awesome D.O.!</li>
