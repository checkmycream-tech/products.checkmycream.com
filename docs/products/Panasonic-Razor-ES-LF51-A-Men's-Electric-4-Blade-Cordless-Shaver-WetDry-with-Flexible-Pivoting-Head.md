      <li>It gives a very  good shave with no irritation of the skin.</li>
      <li>And since the price has dropped to $90 it is a very good deal as well.</li>
      <li>, I will continue to use it, and I feel that the price I paid was very fair.</li>
      <li>This thing is absolutely INCREDIBLE...</li>
      <li>The shaver should be ideal for head shaving versus razors for baldies.</li>
      <li>Incredible.</li>
      <li>Everyone reviewing this said this was the best shaver they ever had, and damn, it&#x27;s is good as they said.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Great Shaver !!  Shaves really close , quicker shaves than my older Panasonic.  Also recharges faster !  I&#x27;m&lt;br /&gt;glad I bought it.  I really think that a little shaver cleaning brush should have accompanied it.  Panasonic makes&lt;br /&gt;the very Best  electric shaver on the market !!!</li>
    <li> This product works ok. The shave is not as close as a razor. Panasonic products are usually outstanding, so I was somewhat disappointed with this shaver.</li>
    <li> This is by far the best shaver I have ever owned. Very powerful and durable.</li>
    <li> Smoothest electric shave I&#x27;ve ever had.</li>
    <li> Best razor I&#x27;ve ever own. Highest rating.</li>
    <li> I purchased for my husband after his Braun broke.  He loves it!!</li>
    <li> I have used electric razors from Norelco, Braun and Panasonic.  Never had the quality of a close shave like that received from a Gillette Fusion 4 blade razor.  I have sensitive skin and most electrics and hand razors created a rash.  The Fusion plus Gillette shave cream for sensitive skin, has been perfect.... until I tried the LF51.  I have used this for a week wet shaving, and it is wonderful.  Shaves as close as the Fusion,  but much more pleasant and smooth while shaving.  This razor is totally superior to any other shave I have had over 40 years of shaving.</li>
    <li> I have always bought cheap razors and this is a significant improvement! Longer charge, better shaving and less effort, comfortable.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used rotary type Norelco shavers for about 20 years now and finally bought a foil type shaver.  I will never buy another rotary shaver after using this one.  I love how quickly it shaves and how efficient it is.  I have a thick tough stubble and it grows fast.  My last shaver only lasted me two years and it was the Sensotouch 3d Norelco.  Before I bought that shaver I was really looking at the foil type shaver and decided to stay with what I knew.  I love my new Panasonic shaver.  The only complaint, it is LOUD.</li>
    <li> This is a tremendous razor.  I use it of my head and face.  I get an amazingly close shave despite &amp;#34;dry shaving&amp;#34; daily.</li>
    <li> Panasonic makes the best shavers</li>
    <li> I love this shaver!  Its worth every penny.</li>
    <li> Excellent shaver! Fast and comfortable with a shave equivalent to or better than a blade.</li>
    <li> Utterly hopeless; well not utterly, but not that good. I really like using my shaver in the shower. 2 years ago I switched from a Braun foiled shaver like this to a Norelco 3D wet/dry shaver. And it is a world of difference. The Norelco provides a great close shave and its charge lasts for 3 - 4 weeks. So when i needed to get new blades for the Norelco and found out they changed their blade system for the worse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found a deal on the Panasonic Arc4 with glowing reviews and decided to give it a try. Unfortunately the end result is a shave that takes much longer, leaves patches, and most confusing of all, the battery lasts many 1.5 weeks at best.</li>
    <li> Great for cleaning under the faucet between shaves.</li>
    <li> It is taking a little time to get used to the larger 4 head vs my old Braun 7 and Complete which were 3 heads but all in all it seems to be shaving as close or closer with less strokes, less noise and less irritation. The real difference is on a 2 day or longer growth it shaves closer with way fewer passes then the Braun ever did. It also seems to hold a charge for more shaves and I love the meter that changes every 20% instead of full, 1/2 and dead like my others. I still have not tried shaving in the shower or using shaving cream instead of Lectra Shave but I would have to recommend this over a Braun 7 and it is less expensive.</li>
    <li> This razor replaced another Panasonic that I had for several years. I just wore it out! This cuts a little better and faster than my old one and it&#x27;s not as loud. What else can I say, it works for me. As one of the other reviewers said, \\&quot;Just Buy It!\\&quot;</li>
    <li> LOVE THIS WET/DRY PANASONIC ELECTRIC RAZOR! ....&lt;br /&gt;FAST!&lt;br /&gt;SHARP!&lt;br /&gt;CLEANS EASY!&lt;br /&gt;CHARGES FAST!&lt;br /&gt;BATTERY HOLDS CHARGE VERY WELL!&lt;br /&gt;HECK ... EVEN THE COLOR IS AMAZING!&lt;br /&gt;AMAZON NEEDS TO ADD A SIXTH STAR CHOICE TO THIS RAZORS REVIEWS!</li>
    <li> This is certainly one of the best electric razors I have ever used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First off, it looks great.  It&#x27;s comfortable in the hand, it&#x27;s easy to use.  It doesn&#x27;t pinch or pull or create discomfort.  I like the blue LED display on it, and love the fact it has a &#x27;safety catch&#x27; on the start button so that when I&#x27;m traveling it doesn&#x27;t go off and freak out the TSA.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s been less than a week, and it can take a few to get used to a new shaver.  It&#x27;s nothing like a blade, but I&#x27;ve yet to find any electric that truly is.  Ultimately an electric shaver is always going to have some kind of barrier between blade and skin which reduces the efficiency a little.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In any case, I really like it, I will continue to use it, and I feel that the price I paid was very fair.</li>
    <li> This thing is absolutely INCREDIBLE...&lt;br /&gt;First things FIRST! I (for YEARS) used a Mach 3 blade, and a couple of years later I converted to the Mach 3 Turbo when it was released. There was no electric razor that could take care of my facial hair. Not one. I got very sick at 23, and by the time I was 28, I couldn&#x27;t hold my arms up to shave anymore without my heart going crazy (I&#x27;m almost completely well now, at 32...). So, I had to do something. I decided to get an electric razor, because it was better than nothing. I was given a Panasonic ES8109 around 4 years ago, and it was as if I used a blade. There was virtually no irritation, but sometimes the blades would get just warm enough to cause a bit on my neck, sometimes. The thing was amazing, but one of my 3 dogs got ahold of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FAST FORWARD: I tried to get a replacement for mine, because I already have the charging/cleaning station, but I couldnt find neither the newer model (which fits in the same cradle), or my ES8109. If you look, the 8109 is running $300+, only because it is out of production.&lt;br /&gt;I began to research, and I &amp;#34;Was&amp;#34; going to buy the upgrade to mine, which is currently 105 on Amazon, but I only need the razor and it comes with the same station I have, and so I looked at one model above, which is blue like this model, but silver up top. I was iffy with it, because it had the same motor as the lower end, was more expensive, and had no station.&lt;br /&gt;I decided I would check the price on this model here (ES-LF51-A), and then see what the differences were besides the motor being 1,000 Revolutions faster.&lt;br /&gt;I read the reviews and decided to purchase it, AND LET ME TELL YOU... It looks like I genuinely used a Mach 3 TURBO, and this thing puts out 0 razor burn. Its hard for me to comprehend how well this thing works since it really only has 2 blades like my old supposed 3 blade, which I assumed was including the trimmer on the side.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS: It has 2 Blades. Of course I&#x27;m sure there is a simple explanation, but it is not described properly. It has 2 blades just like the lower models, and I&#x27;m sorry, but the extra guards are not &amp;#34;Extra Blades&amp;#34;. This is false advertising with a twist.&lt;br /&gt;EXAMPLE: Pioneer was the 1st Plasma company to introduce &amp;#34;White Flash Technology&amp;#34;, so that when the plasma would burn in, you could go into the menu, and run White Flash, but it kills 40-60% of the back-light in order to do so. What Pioneer claimed was no possible burn in, and then you had to read the really really fine print to see that it does in fact burn, they shipped them knowing they had the problem, and told everyone it couldn&#x27;t burn in because they can flash it to get the burn off of the screen, while killing the entire quality of the TV.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BACK TO THE RAZOR: Panasonic is doing the same business trickery as everyone else, and there are only the 2 blades, and the trimmer that flips out on the side.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS: The 4 Guards keep the entire process smoother than my 3 Guard ES8109. The motor runs just fast enough to make a difference over my other razor to not tug or pull on any hairs. It melts them babies down like they&#x27;re nothing. The blades...they don&#x27;t get hot, not yet anyway, not at all. I&#x27;m running a stronger motor, but the heat is not traveling into the blades, and into the guard, and it took me almost the exact same amount of time to shave with this new model than it did my old. So, something is a bit special about this one. I look like an absolute baby. I take care of my skin like crazy anyway, and look mid 20&#x27;s at 32, but this things left my face looking almost as if I don&#x27;t even grow facial hair, but I do, like mad. I&#x27;m already told that I look a little over 10 years younger than my girlfriend, but now it&#x27;s just insane. I look like a child sitting next to her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BUY THIS THING. If you have the money to buy a 5 Blade (If another blade even exists...), go for it, because if it gets better than this, them things must melt a lions facial hair off in a 5 minute process. Hmhm ;-)&lt;br /&gt;This model REALLY is that incredible, and I will keep testing &amp; update this in the future, because my skin is ultra sensitive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OH! If you guys want to know something that will stop possible razor burn better than anything I have ever used, including Neutrogenas post shave lotions, try some &amp;#34;ASAP Colloidal Silver Gel&amp;#34;, and see how it does. It seems to go in and heal everything, even if razor burn begins to show up, Ive not yet found anything to rid of razor burn better, and it sanitizes so that whatever may go into any open pours will be disinfected and you shouldnt have any irritation.&lt;br /&gt;BUT! I don&#x27;t think you will EVER have to use that gel with this device. It is absolutely sublime. I wish I could shake the team of peoples hands that designed this device. All this time I was using blades, and going through a Turbo blade every few days, and that gets EXPENSIVE. Having this electric Razor is like have a house fully cover in solar panels. You never have to pay a power bill if you are running enough solar, and that &amp;#34;Bill&amp;#34; is eliminated, forever.&lt;br /&gt;With this Razor, it is very similar in concept. You wont be going to the store to buy $20 worth of blades every month of your life, and you will not be putting on lotion, and you will not be spending so much time with a blade. This will save you time to get to work, time from going to the store to get replacement razors, the gas money to get to the store, no more lotion, and no more swapping blades all of the time. The other razor still had the original blades. So, I imagine this one will give me 5 years before I really have to change the blades. I will probably swap them every 18 months just to keep it in full function, but it will not be fully necessary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Excellent product, the best I&#x27;ve ever had, and man....A MASSIVE thumbs UP to Panasonic. They are the SONY of Electric Razors. Read every review in here you want, and they will tell you the same when comparing to every single other brand and style in existence. If you&#x27;re using a Rotary, you&#x27;re still using &amp;#34;just a a plain ole electric razor&amp;#34; that is just not even functional in comparison to Panasonics design. I&#x27;ll stop typing now. This thing is amazing.</li>
    <li> Keeps my head smooth and can be used wet or dry. I have been very happy with this razor the last few months. Has held up very well, easy to clean, and gets a close shave.</li>
    <li> Battery lasts for about 2 weeks between charging, and is the closest shave with electric I have ever had.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had my razor for about a month now and am very happy with it&#x27;s performance. I particularly like the soft feel of the pivoting head as it follows the contours of my face. It&#x27;s also very easy to clean - just turn it on and rinse under the tap and it will turn itself off when done.</li>
    <li> I have tried all the electric shavers and the Panasonic brand has been the best for me.  This one has more rpms that seems to do a better job.</li>
    <li> I have a problem getting a close shave on my neck. I need to go against the grain because after shaving with my 4 blade Gillette I still get the 5 o&#x27;clock shadow very fast. If I do go against the grain I get terrible shaving rash and bumps that are bleeding and red. Very unsightly. This Panasonic allows for me to get a super close shave and I go against the grain without any redness or drama. It is also good on pubic areas and much safer then using a blade down there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a beard and it is not very good at getting around it. So I mainly use it on my neck. But if I had a totally shaved face I would use it all over instead of just neck areas. It&#x27;s a good buy.</li>
    <li> Exceptional razor.  Previously had a competitor&#x27;s electric razor that did not shave well along the neck line.  Not a problem with this Panasonic model.  Also, easy to clean and charges within hours.  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Have been using Norelco for almost 10 years..wanted to try out the Panasonic foil shaver for a change... My first experience was not a very pleasant one 1: Shaver was too loud to my liking 2: My skin became very sensitive and rash below my neck ,with hair still left to be shaved off.  It was too sensitive to carry on..so I had to complete my shave with my existing Norelco(Wet &amp; Dry).  The only plus for me was the build quality and the remnant charge feedback.  I wanted to like it ..but looks like this foil shaver just doesn&#x27;t suit my skin(Note :I only shave once or max twice a week).</li>
    <li> All my life I had issues with shaving. Usual story I am not a white red cheeks person, lots of Mediterranean blood, hence a crazy manly facial hair ... I was not able to shave daily unless I wanted to mutilate myself daily. Oh and summers, sweat on your nicely mutilated blotchy face ... A mazohist&#x27;s dream comes true.  No more,I said no more. After trying bunch of dingy Philips Norelcos, dumping how-much-hard-earned-money who knows into bazaar quality shavers.  And here comes Panasonic.  My god, it is magic, it is the best widget I got this year for myself, better than an iphone 5, better than a second gen keyboarded 3G kindle, better than chocolate, sex, and science fiction all together. I look like a decent American now, not a weird-looking-creepy immigrant. Now I am gonna run back and join the American society with my sweet sweet über clean face.</li>
    <li> Works great and is easy to maintain.</li>
    <li> Did&#x27;t do good job as described. Not worth for $100</li>
    <li> Panasonic is a reliable brand for electronic razor. This razor gives you very smooth chin. You won&#x27;t regret.</li>
    <li> I read the reviews. I bought it. It works. I still have problems with swirls of whiskers that even this shaver has trouble with but by far, this is the best electric shaver I have ever owned. I have had Norelco and Braun&#x27;s best. If you&#x27;re going to buy an electric shaver this is the ONE.</li>
    <li> For me, it is too hard working... but i think that the product is good</li>
    <li> Quieter and better shave.</li>
    <li> If more accessories can be accompanied with this razor when I bought it, that would be great. By the way, I&#x27;m quite impressive to have this razor. It&#x27;s good and has done what I expected.</li>
    <li> Very good quality product shaves better than rotary Philips</li>
    <li> Skin on my upper lip and around the jawline is quite sensitive to shave with a blade every day and as I don&#x27;t particularly enjoy being unshaven at work, the electric razor i thought will do the trick. I saw this one and after reading good reviews on other dedicated websites, i decided to get it. I&#x27;ve had the shaver for two weeks now and i am very happy with my purchase. I&#x27;ve tried the shaver with and without shaving foam and it works quite well with both. It is easy to clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do find that in some instances i need to go over one area couple of times to get that smooth finish and find that my face is irritable after that. So I don&#x27;t press so hard and get rid of about 95% of stubble and then go over the rest with the razor for that baby-butt finish less irritation. And that works for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Features wise, the are no gimmicks. There is the switch to lock the head movement, a beard trimmer and a on/off switch lock which is useful to prevent the shaver being switched on accidentally in the luggage. It recharges to 100% quite quickly and the charge display is easy to see.</li>
    <li> My Dad is elderly and was having a tough time shaving so I got this Panasonic because I like the name brand and I liked the reviews for the product. He is now shaving again. He didn&#x27;t even shave his hair off before using it and his facial hair was long. I thought he would cut or shave some off before using the shaving system, but he didn&#x27;t and the darn thing shaved off his long hair. Now he uses it every day. It is a great shaver.</li>
    <li> This shaver works.  It is that simple.  Very high quality.</li>
    <li> Great great machine, it takes a bit more time to shave with Panasonic but I used to get blade bumps on my neck thanks for Phillips, absolutely recommend it it&#x27;s great</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had the LF51 for about a week now.  This is a switch from rotary to regular in electric shavers for me.  I have to say that so far, I can find very little to complain about.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shaver does an excellent job on my beard.  I&#x27;ve even let the stubble grow out for two days, and this thing tackled it like it was nothing.  The &amp;#34;lock&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;soft&amp;#34; don&#x27;t seem to have a lot of effect, I&#x27;m still experimenting with that, but it doesn&#x27;t detract from the shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pop-up trimmer works extremely well, and after I get the sideburns where I want them, the shaver part takes care of the stubble that&#x27;s left with no problems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cleaning couldn&#x27;t be easier.  I followed the directions, used hand soap, and the faster cleaning speed and that did the trick.  The only thing the shaver is missing is a cleaning brush, but since I have a couple lying around, that&#x27;s about it for the cons as far as I&#x27;m concerned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Replacement foils and blades seem straightforward, and relatively reasonably priced, as opposed to the Norelco which this replaced.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The travel case seems sturdy enough.  The travel lock is extremely simple to use, you just rotate a sort of ring that surrounds the on-off button.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The battery indicator seems to work well, although I have trouble seeing the color blue due to an astigmatism, but I can manage and so can you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t hesitate, don&#x27;t dither.  You&#x27;ve done enough research.  Order this shaver and be done with it, you&#x27;ll be pleased.</li>
    <li> Wow! Powerful, smooth , close cutting razor. Best I&#x27;ve ever had. Love the swivel head and charge meter display. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I had an Arc3 Wet/Dry that I have used for years, and bought this to replace.  It is even better than the Arc3.  If you have never used a wet/dry electric, it is worth the jump.  Being able to use it in the shower with shaving cream not only saves precious sleep time, but results in an excellent shave.  The only complaint I have is that a new blade/foil costs about the same as a new razor.</li>
    <li> Does what it should though never as close as a blade. Not disappointed.</li>
    <li> Hubby was happy with his Christmas gift, quite a step up from his old basic Norelco.</li>
    <li> Wish I would of purchased Panasonic razors years ago.  I have owned at least five makes and this razor blows everything out of the water.</li>
    <li> This razor performs head and shoulders above my old Braun Cruzer 3 razor I had prior (which I hated from day one).  It is very efficient and doesn&#x27;t pull hairs one bit.  I use to dread shaving as it would take so much time and was fairly uncomfortable but now it takes only about 4-5 minutes and I&#x27;m done.  I saw a few reviews that mentioned the trimmer doesn&#x27;t work so well and that had me a little concerned since I use the trimmer often on my beard and side burns but I was pleasantly surprised to find that it too works infinitely better than my old shaver.  The battery also lasts a very long time, I&#x27;m able to shave for at least a week and a half to two weeks before needing a charge.  Also the digital battery gauge is a nice touch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very impressed, highly recommend especially for the money.</li>
    <li> I purchased this after reading a number of &amp;#34;Best Electric Razor&amp;#34; shootouts on tech and electronic blogs.  It frequently came in the runner up position, but hear me out - this deserves the number on position.  But first, let me tell you the good:&lt;br /&gt;-Great close shave, no pulling or irritation&lt;br /&gt;-Shave dry OR wet; this also means cleaning is a breeze: run under the faucet and it&#x27;s clean!&lt;br /&gt;-LED display shows shave time remaining&lt;br /&gt;-Standards are there: pivot or locked head options, trimmer&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, one of the things that is supposedly in the &amp;#34;CONS&amp;#34; column is that it doesn&#x27;t have a base stand/charger/auto cleaner.  One &amp;#34;Gizmo&amp;#34; blog says that your razor deserves more than just laying on the counter - I say this is absurd!  I don&#x27;t need an extra piece of plastic and overpriced cleaning solution.  The Arc 4 is a true wet/dry and allows you to clean by turning it to the ultrasonic setting and running under water.  It is as simple as can be and then it goes right back in the drawer or cabinet.  Supposedly others have better charge times, but 45 mins per charge is plenty.  Most shaves are only a couple of minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In summation: Great value, close shave, wet/dry and easy cleaning put it over the edge.  Buy and enjoy.</li>
    <li> Shaves very well...probably the closest shave I&#x27;ve had with an electric shaver.  It runs much louder then the Norelco that it replaced.  Surprised me how loud it was when I turned it on.  You do get used to it.  Travel case is pretty minimal...thin plastic.  Norelco case was much more substantial.  But...it&#x27;s the shave that counts and no complaints there.  Also, an attractive looking shaver.</li>
    <li> i think it is a little narrow.</li>
    <li> 71 years old, and have had many razors. This is one of the best.</li>
    <li> very good. it&#x27;s better than braun 720c.</li>
    <li> This is a good quality shaver.</li>
    <li> The first time I used this, I was amazed at how much better it shaved than every other electric shaver I have used. It shaves close and smooth and in half the time of other expensive shavers I have used such as the Braun 790. I am excited to have finally found a shaver I like.</li>
    <li> I was sorely disappointed with this product. I&#x27;ve been a safety razor shaver for about two years now and a few weeks ago, I decided that I would give electric razors a try. I looked on the internet countless of hours on the best electric razors and I decided on this one based on user experiences. Boy was I disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;The weight of the head is good&lt;br /&gt;The unit is easy to clean&lt;br /&gt;Nice looking&lt;br /&gt;Never cuts you up even if you push it hard against your skin&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Leaves stubble&lt;br /&gt;Leaves patches of hair (sometimes I had to go over an area over 10 times using multiple angles to get some hairs)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Perhaps I was using it the wrong way. This unit is useful at trimming a mustache or a beard, Unfortunately, in my sad experience this unit did not deliver what I was expecting - a shorter, more efficient, and effective way of shaving. I think I will go back to my safety razor - it&#x27;s more fun and manly that way.</li>
    <li> swopped this from a ES-RF31 (10,000 revs head) which I found performed poorly due to slow speed - this one is fast (14,000 revs) and performs extremely well and very satisfied.  Delivered ahead of predicted date too..</li>
    <li> Shaves closer than expected. Easy to clean.  Holds a charge for at least three weeks.  Articulating head can be locked, if user prefers. All in all -- excellent.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Norelco for 35 years, because I couldn&#x27;t find a foil shaver that would work for me. Read the reviews on this one, and decided to give it a try. Wow! Much closer, smoother shave than the Norelco. Even better wet with gel, but don&#x27;t usually bother with that. Only drawback is the cost of replacement blades and foil, much more than Norelco. Still, highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Gives closest shave of any electric razor I have ever had.  Unfortunately the battery only lasts about a year.  Then when I replaced the battery the shaver quit working.  Put old battery back in and shaver still would not work.  Panasonic must have a failsafe to disable razor if anyone but their techs work on them.  New battery was good.  Took shaver apart and checked for any damage or loose parts, found nothing.  I used to be an electronics tech so I know what I was doing.  Good razor but too expensive to replace foil and battery every year.</li>
    <li> Bought for hubby after his ancient electric shaver wouldn&#x27;t take a charge anymore.  This new one is so quiet and smooth. I love that it indicates how much charge is left, easy to clean, a winner!!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s simple and gets u a close shave, battery last me a full week with normal use… about 10 min each use.&lt;br /&gt;I like the feel and the grip of the shaver, the lock button is a nice feature. very happy.</li>
    <li> Does a better and quicker job shaving above my upper lip. Neck area is still a little difficult to get smooth even with Electric Shave. I shaved my neck up and down and then left and right. Very smooth but got ingrown hairs the next day. That&#x27;s why I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars. Still a very nice shave.</li>
    <li> The best shaver out there. This was my first electric shaver and boy, what a clean shave it gives. It is ever better than Gillette fusion, which to date was my best shaver.</li>
    <li> I bought this shaver for my elderly father-in law who was bed ridden. It was virtually useless. I had to shave him with the sideburn trimmer. He passed away with a beard.</li>
    <li> This is the best electric shaver on the market period. It is built for professionals.&lt;br /&gt;It is light, less noisy, easy to use with outstanding shaving capability due to very high rpm.&lt;br /&gt;It is far superior to anything available at a very reasonable price.&lt;br /&gt;Go ahead an purchase one for yourself with no hesitation. You will see the difference.</li>
    <li> I got this because I have a soft little baby face and hoped that this would take care of the rashes I get every day from shaving with a Shick Hydro 5. My face personally got a little worse compared to the Shick Hydro but it was an overall nice shaver. Did well dry and wet and felt very good shaving with it. I would recommend this to people that are looking to use something electric but don&#x27;t have a little baby face like me.</li>
    <li> Excellent shaver. I have been using electric shavers for 30+ years including top models from Braun, Phillishave, Norelco and Remington and this unit has by far the best cutting blades and motor I have ever used. The shaver can quickly take care of my morning duties because of its high speed motor and even works well on my stubborn neck hairs. Overall, I am extremely happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> Read the reviews that raved about this razor. Must have been written by people paid by Panasonic.  The razor comes with a notice in the box that it takes a month for your skin to adjust to the razor.  I have had it and used it daily for a month and all I can say is not that impressed.  It has trouble with cutting hairs on my neck. It takes longer to use than my disposable razor and does a worse job. I would not recommend this product to a friend.</li>
    <li> Had it for a few months:&lt;br /&gt;Tough beard, especially neck.&lt;br /&gt;Shaving dry not so good&lt;br /&gt;Shaving in shower with shave gel, just okay. Still have to shave my neck with a blade razor to get close shave.&lt;br /&gt;Shaving in shower, wet face, no gel, EXCELLENTE! Don&#x27;t have to use blade razor anywhere.&lt;br /&gt;Three 15 minute shaves from one charge.</li>
    <li> A great razor, the only complaint I have is the battery life, too short! Other than that it works real good.</li>
    <li> I was hesitant since I&#x27;ve never really used a foil shaver before and this one isn&#x27;t cheap. However, the reviews don&#x27;t lie, it really is awesome.</li>
    <li> I purchased this razor on 1/31/14 and loved the shave it gave me.  I had tried a few other electrics and they all tore up my face pretty badly.  This one was comfortable and gave a great shave (given that I would use it daily).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Reverted back to a blade razor for a bit when I wasn&#x27;t shaving everyday and when I tried to use the electric the other day, it seemingly had died.  The battery still had juice, but when I turned it on, it had an irregular motor pattern (as if it was designed to indicate a specific problem, but I didn&#x27;t care enough to look into it further and tossed it).</li>
    <li> A Short Story:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Been using Gillete Mach 3s and 4s since I first started shaving during my teenage years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enter 20s: Tired of expensive refill cartridges and time-consuming shaves that feel like using a machete in the jungle when I let my stubble grow out for more than a week or two.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do my research and see Amazon&#x27;s most recommended razor is this one. Order it with middling expectations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Arrives on my doorstep. Try it. Shocked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Smooth shave. No resistance. Simple to use. No refill cartridges. Many shaves per charge. Easy on the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;New convert! Post 5* Amazon review. Hope others can discover the joy of this razor.</li>
    <li> A bit rougher on my skin than my 8 year old Panasonic with 3 lines.  I would put on a new foil on my old razor every 4 to 6 months and throughout it was nicer on my skin, but the old guy broke.</li>
    <li> I just got this and plan to write a more detailed review when I&#x27;ve used it more, but I immediately have to knock it down to 4 stars because it came with two completely different sets of cleaning instructions.  The instruction manual tells you to do something completely different than what the fancy insert with pictures tells you to do, which resulted in me doing some random mixture of the two which may or may not have cleaned it safely.  This really isn&#x27;t a dealbreaker since cleaning a razor is truly not that difficult, but it makes one wonder what&#x27;s going on at Panasonic that they would ship something without checking it first.</li>
    <li> I purchased this shaver after spending weeks reviewing every men&#x27;s shaver available on the market and coming to the conclusion that according to the entirety of the internet this should be the best men&#x27;s shaver available.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I began using it about 2 months ago and it has lived up to my expectations. It is made in Japan, not in China like most Panasonic shavers. The build quality feels solid and well designed, a solid step up from every other electric shaver that I have seen. The shave that it provides is by far the best shave I have ever gotten out of an electric shaver too, and I have tried models from Braun, Phillips, Remington and Panasonic before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ES-LF51-A deserves a 10/10, not only does it provide the best shave but it outperforms models costing twice as much or more. I hope that they don&#x27;t discontinue manufacturing this shaver anytime soon, they definitely hit the price to performance ratio sweet spot.</li>
    <li> I bought this product based on a number of favourable reviews and the price point. It is a good quality product and made in Japan. I have used the shaver twice now and it offers a clean shave with no skin irritation. It can be quite loud but this is not a problem for me. I&#x27;m not sure on how many shaves you could get out of a single charge, but I don&#x27;t think it would be too many, but again not an issue for me. Would recommend without hesitation, given the price and quality of the product.</li>
    <li> I bought other shavers but this by far is the best for a real shave feeling for sensitive skin.. I recommend this to anyone looking for a great shaver...</li>
    <li> Extremely sharp and smooth cutting also less burning sensation.The battery seem to last around two weeks. Probably the best  4 blade electric razor from panasonic.</li>
    <li> Excellent razor.  He is extremely happy with it.</li>
    <li> This is my second Panasonic shaver - loved them both but the new one is quêter and smoother. Great product!</li>
    <li> I got this for my husband for fathers day and returned it.  He didn&#x27;t like it as much as his Norelco that he has been using for years. He didn&#x27;t get many break outs after using this but it doesn&#x27;t get close enough or doesn&#x27;t compare to his Norelco.</li>
    <li> I have gone through a few shavers and this is by far the best. Rotary shavers would really irritate my skin especially at the neck area where it&#x27;s toughest to shave and requires frequent passes with an electric shaver. This panasonic barely irritates my skin around the neck area and outperforms the others shaving trouble spots quicker. I shaved last night a week old beard and it did a great job. I have a tough beard and grows in different directions but was really impressed with this last test for a week old beard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m glad this shaver worked out for me because it was my last shot and if it didn&#x27;t perform well I was going back to a razor. My previous shaver was a Phillips Norelco AT810 power touch and man did that burn the hell out of my face. Not bad if you have a weak beard but for me a foil shaver is the way to go and this one did not disappoint.Also have in mind that with electric razors it&#x27;s better to aim for one in a higher price range than the cheaper ones. If you are like me who was almost ready to give up on electric shavers then please give this one a chance. Between amazon&#x27;s return policies and Panasonics money back guarantee I saw no reason to not at least try it. Panasonic seems to have it right and I&#x27;m sure you will not be disappointed. Go ahead and give it a shot!!!</li>
    <li> After reading so many reviews I thought this would be a great buy. I switched from a dry electric shaver to this one and use it in the shower. Unfortunately after a few months of adjusting to the shaver, it just does not shave as close as my other much cheaper electric panasonic shaver. It also seems to be impossible to get close shaves on my neck region under my jawline and chin. No matter how many times I run it over and in different positions, the foils wont get close enough and leaves some stubble that ends up requiring a hand razor to finish the job. Not sure if it is the contours of my face and neck but I did not have this issue with my other past shavers. I shave everyday and a full charge lasts for about a 8 days. It does everything it says in its product description decently though so it is not a bad product, just not a great one.</li>
    <li> I bought this for a vacation trip to avoid needing a razor shave in parts unknown.  Now I use it at home, travel, and for all but the finest trims.  Great product, works well, good shave, easy to use, easy to clean, no complaints.  It needs charging a bit more often than they advertise, like every couple of days or so, but it charges quickly.  I didn&#x27;t order the replacement heads at the start but I would have done so if I knew how happy I would be with the product.</li>
    <li> I replaced a 7-year old Braun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros&lt;br /&gt;- Good pivoting and face contouring for close shave. Seems to perform better than when my Braun was new.&lt;br /&gt;- Fast charging with charge indicator. Convenient to know when to charge vs basing on reduced performance.&lt;br /&gt;- Decent battery life. I shave nearly every day and charge about once a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons&lt;br /&gt;- No upright storage base like my Braun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I would recommend. I&#x27;m traveling soon so looking forward to using power lock feature and carry case.</li>
    <li> This is my fifth Panasonic..simply the best electric razor built...waterproof, easy to maintain and clean, close, smooth shave with long battery life..this is the one to own!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s the best shaver I have owned.</li>
    <li> Great looks, balance. Feels good in the hand. Rapid recharge. Easy and thorough head cleaning process. Previously-owned Braun and Norelco razors don&#x27;t compare. Glad I moved on to this Panasonic.</li>
    <li> I bought this shaver for my elderly father. He just loves it. The shave is easy, the head flexes or it can be locked, and it gives a nice close shave with little effort compared to the Remington he once had.</li>
    <li> 14,000 opms make for a much smoother shave.</li>
    <li> Superb handling, closer than a razor and much more comfortable. This replaced a 4 year old similar Panasonic model, and I&#x27;ve been delighted with both.</li>
    <li> I got sick of going through expensive cartradge razor heads (plus they&#x27;re not recyclable). This thing shaves great with my sensitive skin once i got the hang of it. Make sure you read through the directions. I got great results once i lightened up on the pressure (it doesn&#x27;t take much if any). Battery stays strong for 3 or 4 shaves, could do a lot more shaves but I notice it takes a minute longer once the battery is at 60%. It has a very handy and easy to read battery gauge. The lockable swivel head works like a charm, it works great in the shower too. I would definately recommend this shaver. I bought it with a spare inner blade six months ago and havent had to change it yet.</li>
    <li> This is the best razor that I have used so far. I can get a nice clean shave without irritation. I highly recommend this shaver for your grooming needs.</li>
    <li> I got this 2 weeks ago and use it in the shower. It gives a very good shave but I have a beard that is like wire so it does not yet give me a shave like a triple edge razor with shave cream. I hear it takes a month for your face to get used to an electric if you have not used one so we will see. When I get out of the shower I use a 10X magnification mirror to see if the cut is close. I did this with my razor also so I know how a close shave looks. The shave with this is pretty good but sometimes I have to touch up a bit with the Panasonic after shaving with it in the shower so I gave it 4 stars, but I think it will be 5 stars after more shaves. I like the way it cleans and the size of the head. It is nice and quiet and I like the pop-out edger for sideburns. I would recommend it. Best electric shaver yet for the money for my wire-faced beard!</li>
    <li> First electric razor in 50 years. Very skeptical turns out it is a joy to use. Close shave , smooth face, easy to clean. Worth every penny.</li>
    <li> I use this to shave my face and my head. It really does the trick and I absolutely love the ability to clean it with water and regular soap. The only real negative that causes an star to be removed is the amount of battery that it says remains is not accurate at all. 7 minutes of use from a full charge drops it down two levels (40 minutes)</li>
    <li> I like Panasonic razors. They shave clean and close. This one is very quiet and comfortable. Shaves close and keeps its charge</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been a Norelco customer for over 15 years and have lost faith in the latest Norelco shavers. The last one I purchased, the 3D one, was expensive and didn&#x27;t do the job. I had to resort to \\&quot;closing\\&quot; the shave with my Norelco Nivea dispensing shaver, which is by far the best Norelco shaver even though it was on $59.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I state the above to let you know where my loyalties have been. I bought this particular model because of the price, the fact that it has 1,000 rpms more than the other model that had higher ratings, and that it is a dual wet and dry shaver. It shaves really well in dry and wet conditions. I have yet to use a Gel shaving cream but have used the Nivea cream dispensed out of my Norelco shaver and it was amazing. As opposed to the Norelco shavers, my neck area is not red at all. I was surprised and shocked. It must just be my neck but I can&#x27;t get clean shaves in the neck area as I have little stubs left and I end up using the trimmer to get these. I think once I use the shaving gel I just bought, this should take care of it. I am also impressed by the the foils as I had tried these many years ago on some other brand and it was useless and ended up back to Norelco. I like the cleaning suggestion of put some liquid soap and running it for 20 seconds. Quick and simple. I also like the digital display showing the percentage left. It charges quickly too. It also has a lock mechanism for traveling which is a plus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really wanted a 5 blade system but that was way too expensive and I just couldn&#x27;t justify paying $100 more for 1 more blade. Also, I believe the speed was not as much as this 4 blade system. I gave it a 4 star for not getting 100% of the neck and the price about $20 more than what I think it should be valued at. I do recommend this shaver and will update my review once I use shaving cream.</li>
    <li> This is my second one of this model, the new one having been changed in what seem to be cosmetic and not substantive ways.  I loved my first one but it needed a new cutter and foil, and an entirely new razor cost just $40 more, so now I have a spare.  This razor is quiet, cuts as closely as any electric I am aware of, and the flexible head really does make a difference.  And though I don&#x27;t use it in the shower, this razor really is waterproof, which some may find a plus.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t clean shave as it suppose to.</li>
    <li> Does not irritate like Norelco, but is not nearly as good as a razor, I still have stuble after the shave.</li>
    <li> This surprisingly good shaver seems to be flying under the radar since it is currently ranked #28 on Amazon&#x27;s list of best-selling foil shavers while the model it is intended to replace, the 8243A, is #5 and only costs a few dollars less.&lt;br /&gt;The LF51 has  reduced the  power source LED readout from 10 stages to 5 but adds a faster motor at 14000 CPU (up from 13000) and a new foil screen with a presumably improved fourth blade. Although the two main cutter blocks remain the same, the result is a terrific shave that rivals that of the much more expensive LV61 5- blade. I use both on a rotational basis and, honestly, on some days I can&#x27;t tell which shave is better. Whereas the LV61 is more comfortable on my face, the LF51&lt;br /&gt;has a much narrower head which can maneuver into hard to get places. On the other hand, the LF51 doesn&#x27;t pivot from front to back like the LV61. It only pivots from side to side and the foils move up and down as more or less pressure is applied. The head can be locked in place for no movement by engaging a button. Battery life is excellent; I get considerably more than the advertised 45 minutes of usage per charge. The unit is handsome, compact and feels good in the hand. My only complaint is a nit-pick-- the head once removed is rather difficult to snap back on, which is unusual for Panasonic.&lt;br /&gt;I have a pretty tough beard and have tried all of the higher-end foil shavers on the market. For me,&lt;br /&gt;the LF51 is absolutely one of the best and I would recommend it for beards of all kinds.</li>
    <li> If this style shaver is what works for you, this one will be great. Its high frequency blades are really quick and it shaves well. Its as good as any I have ever had for much more money. Charge lasts a week as far as I have used it, has a good battery meter on the front. Buy this over the more expensive ones. I have lived in Japan and this looks like it was made there and for their market, I really like it and its easy to clean or use in the shower.</li>
    <li> This shaver replaced my older panasonic wet/dry shaver 8092, which I liked a lot.  The new model looks flashy, and its sideburns shaver has been improved, but otherwise it is a few steps down from the older.  First, the head is so big that it is hard to reach under the nose, at least for me :).  Second, the removable head doesn&#x27;t fit on easily, it requires fiddling.  Third, the old shaver had a nice contact-free inductive charging system whereas this one has a standard plug hole in the bottom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had it for a few weeks now, and it gets the job done, but it is really no Improvement over the old one.</li>
    <li> Purchased the shaver January of 2013. Twenty-six months later (and two months after the expiration of the warranty) I am shopping for a new shaver. The problems are these:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) Rapid deterioration of the battery life, to the point where it now only manages 2.5 shaves per charge.&lt;br /&gt;2) SMELLY! The shaver has various nooks and crannies where hair settles (especially the pivot point)  and it is very difficult to clean.&lt;br /&gt;3) The angle of the sideburn trimmer/auxiliary cutter makes it useless for neck hair and other quick trimming.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was initially happy with this purchase but view the rapid decline at the time of the warranty&#x27;s expiration as unacceptable. It will be a long time before I consider another Panasonic product.</li>
    <li> Great shave with a nice electric razor.  First time I wasn&#x27;t super impressed, but after a few cuts I won&#x27;t use anything else.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t used a shaver in over 20 years and was quite reluctant to buy another one.  My past experiences involved the shaver grabbing/pulling hair - never shaving close enough etc.  I did a lot of research on this one before I bought it.  I was actually thinking of getting another with the three rotating heads but - read a review indicating shaving the upper lip under the nose would be a challenge (which makes sense when you think about it).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So - the good...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s competitively priced in comparison to other quality shavers.  It doesn&#x27;t require a charging stand to charge (cord plugs right into it).  It cleans up extremely easy.  Simple/easy to understand display for charging.  Holds a charge for days of shaving.  And, most importantly - shaves very close - usually with one pass.  It&#x27;s important though that you shave AGAINST the grain to get the closest shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bad...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nothing is really &amp;#34;bad&amp;#34;.  However - the trimmer that flips out on the side isn&#x27;t entirely effective.  It works but, it&#x27;s use would be limited to sideburn trimming... nothing heavy.  That&#x27;s about it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all - I&#x27;m glad I got this shaver.  I was tired of kicking out $25 for blades replacements... and they were irritating my face and making shaving a real PITA.  Now - with this - I have no irritation/close shave.  Couldn&#x27;t ask for more in a shaver I don&#x27;t think (especially for the price).</li>
    <li> I have had several electric shavers over the past 35 years. I&#x27;ve ended up throwing them all away. I thought I&#x27;d try one last time and purchased the Panasonic ES-LF51-A Electric Wet/Dry Shaver. It easily provides as close a shave as my razor ever did; and, it takes only about 3-4 minutes to shave my face/neck. I have a beard that grows in multiple directions but this razor makes getting a close shave in those areas so easy it really surprised me. Also, I&#x27;ve always had one problem area: in the crease under the nose. With a manual razor I have to go through all kinds of gyrations to get a smooth shave in that area. The Panasonic shaver has no problem reaching that area and shaving it smoothly. In addition, it provides a very comfortable shave. Finally, clean-up is a snap! Wish I could find something to complain about but I can&#x27;t. I would definitely buy it again.</li>
    <li> This product works ok.  The shave is not as close as a razor and requires two or three passovers to get even a mediocre shave. Charge lasts about a week shaving once a day.  Panasonic products are usually outstanding, so I was somewhat disappointed with this shaver, especially at the price (about $100).</li>
    <li> When I first used it, I didn&#x27;t know what to expect. Due to a skin condition I can&#x27;t use razor blades so I&#x27;ve been shopping, buying and returning shavers that just haven&#x27;t done the job for me in a satisfactory manner. But along came Panasonic with its ES-LF51-A and not only has it given me the smoothest shave I have ever had, but it&#x27;s made me  (and my partner) a happier man.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are only two drawbacks that I find with this machine:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. It&#x27;s pretty noisy. I mean it sounds like a mobile phone vibrating next to a microphone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. It takes almost an hour to shave. And I don&#x27;t have a huge face. But you do have to go over your face a couple of times to get the smoothest effect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than that, I&#x27;m pretty happy and a satisfied customer.</li>
    <li> I got this hoping I could get a nice clean shave like my razor blade. If your inbetween and thinking of trying one of these from a regular razor.. the razor blade gives a muuuch much cleaner shave.</li>
    <li> This razor far exceeded my expectations as well as the performance of all previously owned razors.  Works great in the shower and holds a charge well.  Only used a short while (Christmas gift),but am pleased with performance.</li>
    <li> Bought the razor for my husband for Christmas.  He has a tough beard and has never been able to find a razor that works for him.  This one is fabulous and you truly don&#x27;t even need to use shaving cream.  The expensive shavers and blades we were buying are gone forever as this replacement is a keeper.  For my husband to say he loves something, means it&#x27;s a great product.</li>
    <li> This electric razor delivers like a fresh disposable one. Complete satisfaction! Wonderful product! After purchasing a Phillips-Norelco and sending it back to the manufacturer, I found a fabulous product just as I was about to throw in the towel.</li>
    <li> Horrible shaver.  Doesn&#x27;t shave close at all.  I returned it.</li>
    <li> I got this for Father&#x27;s day so I did not buy this on AMAZON but from what I see the price on AMAZON is close to the lowest price when on sale. I went back MUCH later and reduce it to 3 from 5 stars. Before you read my original review, here is why I took off two  stars.  1.It is MUCH louder than a rotary electric razor. 2. The screen (the part that touches your face) is a part that wears out (as it is part of the cutting system) and has to replaced like every 6 months, the inner blades every year. 3. Replacement blade and screen are less available than a Noreclo rotary blade set. They cost more, and sometimes there are shortages which then results in those with stock selling at a high price.  It was almost the same money to buy a new good Noreclo rotary blade razor than to buy a blade and screen set, so I went back to Noreclo. The new Norelcos no longer need a lot of cleaning, just washing in water, so no longer is that any issue.   I am comparing this to three Norelcos I have owned. First off, you do not need to buy any Razor lubricant and cleaner to maintain this as I need for my Norelcos and I am not spending time taking apart and cleaning the thing (NO LONGER TRUE, CLEANS EASY IN WATER). So I save time and money. This cleans just with regular liquid soap!. The other brand works by spinning around little blades, this works by vibrating back and forth inside which appears to me works way better. Two vibrating sections beneath a four section top screen act and are called 4 blades rows parallel to each other. The other brand is actually quieter, this one the vibration is louder and higher pitched (slightly higher than A#) but is fine - it is not annoying but  it is more noticeable if you are trying to be very quiet in the morning (in that case just use a blade if you need to be very quiet). I feel that the shave is closer and take less time when comparing them side-by-side. I think this is partially because the entire top are blades not three small circles with spacein between.  This model has the nice Nanotech blades that often are not mentioned in descriptions. It also has a lockout so it does not go on in your luggage so the TSA is less likely to pin you to the floor because of that.  It can quickly charge enough to get you going in 5 minutes if need be. The two-year warranty parts and labor is nice. It works great with cream like gel creams (for a wet shave) if that is your preference.  The bottom line is that it makes  for a close painless,smooth and quick shave.  And guess what it still in Made in Japan not in China. But sorry, I went back to Norelco,</li>
    <li> BLUF (Bottom Line Up Front):&lt;br /&gt;After a fair amount of research, I chose this razor over the more expensive Braun razors because of the higher motor speed.  I was immediately glad that I did.  After one month of use, I highly recommend this razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- It is loud.  In large part due to the high motor speed.  It&#x27;s a fairly high pitched whine.  But it&#x27;s not deafening.&lt;br /&gt;- With 4 blades, the razor is rather deep.  I have a beard, but still shave my neck and cheek bone areas.  I like to get the beard in a nice straight line.  On my neck, that means using the razor to shave side to side as opposed to up and down.  Even then, I still need to tidy up the beard lines with a regular razor about once a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- Shave wet or dry.  I personally use an electric shaver lotion.  You can buy that here: http://amzn.com/B003LZXOXQ&lt;br /&gt;- The high motor speed means it doesn&#x27;t pull hairs.  My old Braun was constantly yanking hairs out by the roots.  I thought it was just a necessary evil of electric razors.  Now I realize it&#x27;s the motor speed that makes the difference.&lt;br /&gt;- The charge indicator.  It tells you both when you start the razor and when you stop the razor, what the charge level is in 20% increments.  Makes it easy to know when you should recharge it.&lt;br /&gt;- The travel lock.  Flick the ring around the power button to lock it in the off mode so it won&#x27;t run when in your luggage.  Why don&#x27;t all electric razors have a lock?&lt;br /&gt;- Easy clean, just pop off the screen and run it under a running faucet.  No mess, no problem.  This beats the self cleaning stations the Braun&#x27;s use.  The problem with the self cleaning station is that it runs the razor for long periods of time.  This wears out both the screen and the blades.  I&#x27;m convinced the self cleaning stations are just a gimmick to get you to buy their cleaning chemicals and more razors/screens.  This one is easier and faster to clean!</li>
    <li> Best electric I have ever owned... Was an impulse buy I actually don&#x27;t regret!</li>
    <li> Unreal shave. I am coming from a double edge razor which until now I thought was the only way to achieve a superior shave. My issue was the nasty cuts and nicks I got occasionally using it. Well I decided to give the Panasonic Arc4 a try and I am sold. Used a little shave lather in the shower with this thing and after I was done it looked and felt just like the double edge razor minus the cuts. Definitely a believer in this one. I actually find my shave lasts longer than other razors. Definite buy.</li>
    <li> The shaver works very well.&lt;br /&gt;It shaves closer than a blade!&lt;br /&gt;I love it!</li>
    <li> es8243 is better. I found the blades on the eslf51 to not be as close and the shaver caused more irritation. Wait for the es8243 to go on sale &amp;#60;$100 and you will have the best shaver for your money. Some improvements are a step back not a step forward.</li>
    <li> if you are looking for an electric razor, buy this one. This is the Best razor I have ever had. No regrets.</li>
    <li> This shaver, with a little effort, will shave as close as a blade and the battery will last close to two weeks of shaving. I&#x27;ve only had it for month, so I can&#x27;t comment on how long it will continue to be this effective.</li>
    <li> Not so smooth and delicate, and also not so clean</li>
    <li> Works great, wet or dry. Does a great job on my armpits, legs and bikini area without pulling or nicking. The battery seems to last for a long time; longer than I expected, anyway. Well made little gadget.</li>
    <li> Used the Panasonic ES-LF51-A Arc 4 elec. shaver for 30 consecutive days as Panasonic recommends, to  ostensibly allow the skin to get used to elec. shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had primarily bought the shaver because my skin is sensitive but hair is coarse and curly and I wanted to avoid the nicks, cuts, and blood from using Gillette blades. This elec. shaver is a piece of junk. I have to press the shaver really hard against my skin to even get even a decent shave on my face and all the time it feels as if my face is pressed against a grinder. It doesn&#x27;t even give a half-decent shave on the neck area, leaving most hair as-is. From the shaving (grinding) experience on my face, I have as much blood on my face as from a regular shave and I have to bear the additional aggravation of shaving my neck using the Gillette.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Panasonic product is dysfunctional and doesn&#x27;t even come close to giving a semi-decent shaving experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since I was now past the 30 days return period, Panasonic and Amazon refuse to take it back. This is a scam perpetrated by Panasonic which recommends customers use the shavers for at least 30 days to condition the skin to elec. shaving and then refuse to take it back after the 30 day return period is over.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Panasonic is deceptive and disingenuous corporation and will I will never buy another Panasonic personal care product again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This money is wasted.</li>
    <li> My last 3 shavers have been from Panasonic - and they did a very good job on the shave. But they all had a leaky LCD problems and battery life was as long as the 2 yr warranty. But this Arc 4 is really MUCH better, shaves even closer than a blade, my wife even noticed (married 15 yrs if you catch my drift) And since the price has dropped to $90 it is a very good deal as well. The battery lasts about 6 shaves b4 needs recharging. Not too heavy, much improved gripping surface. I&#x27;d buy it again.</li>
    <li> This is a great little shaver, the trimmer feature works well and the fact you can clean it with soap and water after each use is very nice.  Charges up quickly is light weight and easy to hold for someone with disabilities....</li>
    <li> After reviewing many electric razors, I settled on the Panasonic Arc4 and the Philips Norelco SensoTouch 3D. After trying both, I prefer the Panasonic Arc4 because it is much faster and involves somewhat less skin irritation. Clean up is very easy as well. The Panasonic Arc4 handles longer hairs better than the Norelco. The Norelco was a very close second and is a great razor. Overall the Panasonic Arc4 holds a slight advantage over the Norelco SensoTouch 3D.</li>
    <li> I have used Panasonic shavers in the past with good success but this one makes your face sore while only providing an average shave.  Two stars is being generous.</li>
    <li> I used several shavers but really the Arc IV from panasonic is in the top of the quality of shavers (I used a braun top of the line, didn&#x27;t last more than two years, and never gave the smooth and closed shaved that this). I used it directly: no foams or other products and the shave is really good. Thanks and hope you continue with the same quality. Leo</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m happy with my recently purchased  razor,it&#x27;s quick and easy to use and gives a reasonably close shave.</li>
    <li> Excellent buy. Very satisfied with quality...best ever!</li>
    <li> Now for the disclaimer: I have very sensitive skin. If I sleep on one side of my face for too long, I will get a zit the next day. Guaranteed. Contact dermatitis. So it&#x27;s no exaggeration to say that shaving is a daily nuisance, a very challenging aspect of personal care, especially as my facial hair grows in all sorts of directions. Razor burns are common but in a case of penny-wise, pound-foolish for too long, I put up with manual razors for decades (although I did buy a pricey rechargeable shaver once, back in the Grunge-filled days that was the 1990s), never mind that I had cut my lips more than a few times. And I&#x27;m a bleeder. Thankfully, I rediscovered common sense and made the decision to purchase this product yesterday after evaluating about 20 other models over the last few days. And bless you, Amazon, for making Same-Day Delivery available to my side of the Golden State; I was able to use it last night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now for the review. I come from a marketing background. I was a suit at an ad agency for many years before I became a client. Every time I come across a new product, I pay close attention to the packaging and what&#x27;s printed there - layout, visual, copy and all. I know marketing verbiage from actual product benefit. In the case of the Panasonic ES-LF51-A, the packaging is pretty straightforward and it makes a compelling case for purchase based on the following features it sells:&lt;br /&gt;a) Flexible Pivoting Head (which you can disable via a lock switch on the right side of the handle)&lt;br /&gt;b) Nanotech Blades (and in a relatively compact form factor to allow a closer shave of every nook and cranny of your face)&lt;br /&gt;c) Fast, Linear Motor Drive (at an impressive 14,000 cycles per minute; it&#x27;s like Dyson for your face)&lt;br /&gt;d) Wet/Dry Washable&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What Panasonic ommited to include on the packaging - and this can be a deal breaker for many - is the WEIGHT (Sorry for the caps, that was just for emphasis). This is not your dad&#x27;s old school (read: heavy) shaver. The use of soft-touch rubber on a well-constructed product allows you to hold it securely but without your hand and forearm thinking that you were lifting a mini kettlebell. Other benefits aside, the weight factor convinced me that this would make a great birthday or Christmas gift to my dad and other male friends and relatives of a certain age.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So did the product deliver? Absolutely. I got a fast, gentle and close shave - and on a dry shave. (Sorry Barbasol and Schick, I will have to retire you both.) With no razor burn and cuts this time. Plus, one gets a full charge within an hour. According to the packaging, a full charge gives you 45 minutes of shaving, estimated at two weeks of real-world use. Other winning features: a five-minute quick charge to allow one shave, automatic universal voltage, a travel lock switch  and a pleather travel case. For those of us who live in the US, a two-year limited warranty applies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Did I mention the price? Unbeatable. Excellent value for money. Not even a tinge of buyer&#x27;s remorse from me. Buy it and enjoy it.y) shaver.

    <li> Good shave, great battery. Sometimes you have to take off the top just to use the back trimmer though</li>
    <li> Panasonic is name I&#x27;ve always been able to trust. Their products are dependable &amp; function as they&#x27;re supposed to-- even better. This shaver is no exception. It provides a fast, close shave; about as close as a blade. It&#x27;s relatively quiet, easy to use, versatile, stays charged longer than necessary, easy to clean, comfortable, sturdy, and hard to find fault with. In fact, I can&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t used a blade for over 25 years. I stopped using them because I&#x27;m able to do things while shaving; read, use the computer, etc. The last electric shaver I had was also a Panasonic. I paid around $85 for it when my daughter was born. She&#x27;s now in college &amp; I last used it only this morning. I think that I&#x27;ve only changed the cutter about 4 or 5 times. It stills gives me a shave as close as the Bush/Gore election.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this new shaver because it&#x27;s time to move on to something a bit more advanced. This one will probably last until I&#x27;m no longer able to shave. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nelson Donley, author of LIFE AIN&#x27;T KIND&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[...]</li>
    <li> I REALLY wish I could like this razor. Why? Because on the face it really does do a great job of trimming down to just about as smooth as you can get with a manual razor, but on my neck - it&#x27;s a different story... This thing simply CANNOT shave my neck smooth. It&#x27;s just not possible. I have gone every direction with it, stretching my skin, going at every angle, and it simply won&#x27;t do a good job. Don&#x27;t even get me started about any hairs that you may have missed from a day or two ago and try to shave off, might as well go straight to the trimmer to knock those down because you&#x27;ll spend all day trying to get the foil to cut it off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used Lectric Shave pre-shave which helps but doesn&#x27;t solve the problem and shaved with shaving cream wet which also helps but doesn&#x27;t solve the problem. In fact I got terrible razor burn last week in desperation trying to get one area to shave smooth, this all while using only moderate pressure and high quality shave cream. At this point I don&#x27;t know what else to do, I followed the directions on the slip it came with to give it 30 days to allow my face to get used to it and it&#x27;s been 40 and have had no luck with it getting any better. Of course I&#x27;m passed the return window waiting as long as it told me to (clever trick?) and my wife threw the box away anyhow so I guess I&#x27;m stuck with it... I can&#x27;t believe I spent as much as I did and was let down so badly. Don&#x27;t really know what to do with it know, I&#x27;m back to using my junky $30 Norelco rotary shaver I&#x27;ve had for 3 years with better results...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I rarely write reviews because usually my experience with highly reviewed products is in line with other reviewers, but this time I just had to write something in hopes that I will save one person the disappointment I had with this.</li>
    <li> Amazing razor! I haven&#x27;t used an electric razor in years. The last one i used was a norelco rotary. I was skeptical about a foil razor but this one did not disappoint.</li>
    <li> I am a long time Panasonic shaver user.&lt;br /&gt;This shaver is the best I have ever used and compares&lt;br /&gt;to blade shaving.  I dont think you need&lt;br /&gt;to spend another $100 to get the 5 blade vibrating&lt;br /&gt;model since this one is so good and looks cool&lt;br /&gt;as well.</li>
    <li> If you like things that work surprisingly well you will like this shaver.  I have owned many an expensive electric shaver and this one amazed me.</li>
    <li> Works well, battery life is good.  For the price I wish I didn&#x27;t have to go over the same spot on my neck so many times.  Works well if you shave every single day.  Not as well if you let your hair grow for three days or more.</li>
    <li> First I used traditional razors, and I was happy with those.  Then I got a Braun electric razor, and I liked that even more than the traditional razors.  I used it for several years.  I don&#x27;t remember what model it was but my recollection is that it was roughly $100 in 2005.  Then when it started wearing down in 2011 (an acceptable lifespan, in my opinion) I got a Philips Norelco 6100 2D.  I liked it even better than the Braun.  I ordered the Philips on Amazon, and when I got it out of the box and held it in my hand, I was not impressed with the materials quality.  But, it worked very well from 2011-2015.  Because it worked so well, I was fully intending to get an identical one to replace it.  But I saw the reviews for this Panasonic and decided to give it a shot.  I&#x27;m glad I did.  The Panasonic is better than the Philips in every way.  If you have any opportunity to hold both shavers in your hand, you will see the difference between the two.    The Panasonic shaves me very well.  I can go with the grain, against the grain, or sideways and it works.  I can move the shaver forward and back like you would expect, but you can also slide it sideways to get sideburns, mustache, etc.  It is very easy to clean and it gets very clean.  The battery stays charged for an eternity.  I keep losing the charging cable because I&#x27;m using it less than once a week.    I recommend this shaver to anyone, period.</li>
    <li> I have been using a standard blade / non-electric razor for years, but decided to make the switch to electric. I got tired of paying for the blades, and figured I would use less water with an electric (we have a drought out here in CA). This Panasonic met and exceeded my expectations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have had it for 3 weeks now and have charged it twice. So it seems to last around 9 days on a single charge. Nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am using it dry- without any lotion or shaving cream. It works great on my face, although I do typically have to hit the neck hairs a few times to get that area totally clean. The pop-out razor works well for trimming sideburns. It is super easy to clean as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The overall look &amp; feel of the razor is nice. You can lock the power button which will be nice when traveling. The soft vinyl carrying pouch will be handy too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not much else to say, other than I&#x27;m happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> The most awesome electric razor I have ever purchased. This razor is easy on sensitive skin. It took about two weeks to adjust to the razor. This razor shaves as close or closer than my traditional triple blade razor. Do not press down but allow the razor to do it&#x27;s work. I would definitely purchase this razor again due to the fact it is awesome for sensitive skin and it is a wet\dry Electric razor.</li>
    <li> couldn&#x27;t wait to use it, fully charged it, will take a little getting used to, but I look forward to many years of quality use.</li>
    <li> Well satisfied:&lt;br /&gt;Very easy to use, clean and charge.  Works very well wet or dry.&lt;br /&gt;Other razors I have used give me a rash on my neck, I have used the Panasonic ES-LF51-A for two weeks daily and it leaves my skin&lt;br /&gt;smooth and very comfortable. Very impressed.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a brand new owner to this shaver - but I&#x27;ve tried the wet / dry shaving methods, paired with a nice shaving cream and brush, and this thing gives a quick, close shave. If you pull the skin pretty taught, it gives a shave that&#x27;s nearly as close as my razors. Not QUITE as close, but the trade-off of minimal burning and no nicks or cuts for a shave that&#x27;s quick and easy and nearly as close? I&#x27;ll take that. After doing some basic math, this should pay itself off within the first 5-8 months of use as opposed to the disposables.</li>
    <li> I was using a safety razor before I tried electric. I thought this would be fast and easy. It is not faster or easier. Safety razors are WAY more efficient.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had to pass this over my face back and forth, very slowly, again, and again, and again... until it finally cut most of my hairs in triple the amount of time it takes with a safety razor. When shaving my neck, I was never able to get all of the hairs, and it ended up cutting me in several areas. It left my face fairly smooth, but the amount of time and effort required was extremely tedious, and it left me with cuts and random hairs left behind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am returning this item. It costs WAY too much for how inefficient it is compared to a 10 cent blade in a safety razor. I thought the cost of this razor would suggest a superior shave beyond anything I could achieve with a blade. I was wrong. if you want a quick clean shave, GET A SAFETY RAZOR.</li>
    <li> Best razor I ever had! I have used Norelco and Remington razors in the past. This by far is the closest dry shave and at a very reasonable price. Cleaning it with water is awesome! Much better than using the little brush as on my other razors. I highly recommend buying this one! Thanks Panasonic!</li>
    <li> I had been using a Phillips Norelco Arcitec shaver since 2008. The Arcitec shaver still works, still takes a charge and still provides a pretty good shave. However, the blades are getting a bit dull and the Arcitec itself was getting close to 8 years old.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While looking for a new shaving head, I found that the design had been changed and that many people were not happy with the change. Shave heads with the original design were selling for almost $200.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I decided rather than to buy a new and maybe not so good replacement head for the 8 year old Arcitec that I would look for a different shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found the Panasonic ES-LF51-A Arc 4 wet or dry electric shaver. The reviews were mostly good and the total cost was about twice that of new design replacement heads for my Phillips Arcitec shaver. So, new shaver, new shaving head at a relatively low cost – did not seem too bad so I ordered one from Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First impressions were that it had a good solid feel and finish. The rubberized portions of the shaver body provide for a solid grip and were a nice addition.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shaving head can be locked into  position or can be set to articulate as you shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I plugged it in to charge the battery before I started it. Charging took about an hour. The shaver has LED’s that indicate the level of charge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On starting the shaver, I noticed that it operated with a high frequency buzz. This was not a surprise since the description from the manufacturer says that it operates at 14,000 RPM.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The high frequency buzz is especially noticeable when the shaver is close to the ear. Fortunately, time spent with the shaver close to the ear is minimal in most cases so the noise is not a big problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried it on my beard but could not do a good test since I had shaved that morning with a blade. I decided to allow my beard to grow for a couple of days so that I could do a fair test.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A couple dayslater, I tried the shaver again. The first thing I noticed was that the Panasonic seems to be a “linear” shaver. By “linear” I mean that I found that I was more or less required to shave using parallel strokes. I had been shaving with a rotary shaver for the past eight years so became accustomed to using a circular shaving pattern. When I tried using a circular shaving pattern with the Panasonic, it just did not feel right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know that Panasonic says that one should use the shaver for 30 days before making a judgment but it seemed that the parallel shaving pattern caused me to miss places. I changed the direction of the parallel strokes to be sure to catch all of my beard. I used the shaver for two weeks before making the decision to return it&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The quality of the shave is good. There were only a few places (as with the Arcitec) where I had to repeatedly make passes to remove the stubble.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Instructions say to apply liquid soap to the shaver head and enter cleaning mode on the shaver to clean it. To enter cleaning mode, hold the power button in for a couple of seconds. The shaver goes into really high frequency operation on a timer. Once cleaning mode has finished, the shaver turns off. The heads can then be rinsed with cold water and you are ready to go again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Panasonic is a wet or dry shaver but I never used it as a wet shaver. I think that as long as I am going to put shaving cream on my face, I might as well use a blade. A fresh blade provides a better shave than any electric shaver I have ever used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I guess that I could have tried the Panasonic while in the shower but then I would need a mirror.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shaving without a mirror is OK for a “rough in” shave that might be adequate for weekends but if one is going to work or on a date then a mirror is required to be sure that sideburns are trimmed neatly and that no paces have been missed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Having a mirror in the shower is problematicbecause it gets steamed up or wet so that details are hard to see. Besides, how much time can one afford to spend in the shower?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did not use the trimmer on the Panasonic and I do not use the trimmer on my Arcitec.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I figure that I have to go into the bathroom eventually so while there, I trim sideburns with a blade – much more accurate. Using a blade allows for a “surgical” trim because the blade does not obstruct my view of where I want to trim and it is light in weight and easier – in my opinion – to manipulate than a shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you ever go to a “real” old time barber, they will trim your sideburns, neck and hairline with a straight razor and not clippers. Having a razor sharp blade in the hands of a relative stranger so close to your carotid artery provides for a bit of apprehension but it adds to the over all barber experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am retired now but when I worked each day, I used the electric shaver as part of morning preparation multitasking. With an electric shaver, I could shave while checking the news, weather or traffic on TV and while having morning coffee.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Additionally, with a shaver that allows a circular shaving pattern, shaving can be a more or less absent minded procedure that is not available if I need to pay attention to the direction of parallel shaving strokes and checking for missed spots.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a final test before I decided to return the Panasonic, I shaved and then took notice of the quality of the shave with the Panasonic. I waited a couple of days for my beard to grow again and then shaved with the 8 year old Arcitec with the year old shaving head and again took notice of the quality of the shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The comparison of shave quality between the Panasonic and Arcitec did not show enough difference in to warrant keeping the Panasonic shaver with its parallel shaving requirement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line: The Panasonic shaver provides a very close shave. However,the fact that it is in my opinion a parallel device causes it not to be acceptable for my purposes.</li>
    <li> I have bought and used, or tried to use, many shavers over the past 50 years.This one out performs them all. It is well worth a little extra money.When it wears out I&#x27;ll buy another just like it.You have heard the ads for other shavers claiming they shave as close as a blade?They don&#x27;t,but this one does,</li>
    <li> great!&lt;br /&gt;Funziona benissimo sia a pelle secca che a pelle umida.&lt;br /&gt;Rade velocemente e molto bene.&lt;br /&gt;L&#x27;unica pecca è che è un po&#x27; rumoroso ma ci stà.</li>
    <li> Reviews are spot on. Best razor I&#x27;ve ever had!</li>
    <li> I bought this and sent it to my husband overseas, he hasn&#x27;t complained yet and he received it in his father&#x27;s day care package...so here we are a few months later and he hasn&#x27;t said a word of negativity</li>
    <li> I had been shaving my head and face with a Gillette fusion for 5 plus years when I decided to try an electric. I bought a norelco pt720 at Walmart for $40. It always sounded like it was about to run out of batteries but it did an okay job. For the first three weeks it didn&#x27;t come close to the closeness of a razor but, on the advice of a friend, I stuck it out to \\&quot;let my hair get used to it.\\&quot;. (PLEASE NOTE!!! Before you slam an electric razor on here, you absolutely HAVE to do this step. If you dont, you&#x27;ll NEVER get the results you are hoping for). It did improve and came close but I could always feel a tiny amount of stubble when I ran my hand against the grain. Based on other reviews I decided to invest in this more expensive shaver. This is the one! After my first shave, I was amazed that I felt NO stubble, no matter how hard I rubbed my hand against the grain. I couldn&#x27;t tell the difference between this and my $4-a-blade fusion. This thing&#x27;s motor sounds like a Dremel tool on 10 (ie. It&#x27;s Super fast) I wont miss the mess, inconvenience, and nicks of a razor. This thing will pay for itself. You wont be disappointed.</li>
    <li> Let me make this simple for you. Buy this Razor. It is hands-down this is the best electric shaver that I have ever owned. I&#x27;ve had Norelco, Remington and Braun. None of them ever came close to the quality, comfort and most of all, actual razor-close shave that this shaver gives me. Not only is it a close shave, but I&#x27;m able to comfortably, and completely get to the difficult-to-shave areas around my Adam&#x27;s apple, something that the other companies never could do, and again a completely smooth shaving experience, never any pinching, even if I let the stubble grow for a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It cleans up easily, has a natural grip/feel in your hand, and also works great as a wet shaver (but with my skin I prefer a dry shave). I can&#x27;t speak to the long-range quality as I&#x27;ve only had this for a few months (a Christmas gift from the wife) but I&#x27;ll be absolutely shocked if it gives me problems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re looking to replace your old shaver, stop searching and buy this one, you won&#x27;t regret it!</li>
    <li> Best electric razor I have owned.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a gift and I was told that it worked really well and that it was a good shaver.</li>
    <li> It gives me a very close shave on most of my face but it has some difficulty on my neck.  I&#x27;ve been forced to keep using a regular razor on my neck and I just use this for the rest of my face.</li>
    <li> I would recommend this.It only takes  one hour to charge up.It is verygood value and small compact design.&lt;br /&gt;Very efficient delivery from USA to Spain.</li>
    <li> By far the best razor I have every used or owned!!!  I had an older model panasonic razor for about 5 years.  I also loved it but it was getting time to get a new one.  I read reviews for a month before finally deciding on the ES-LF51-A.  It is amazing!!  It is much much quieter than my previous model and cuts the hair like something out of the future.  I have a very thick beard and a 5:00 shadow.  This razor did not pull my hair at all, even when I let it grow out 2 days.  Take my word for it and just buy the Razor, you will be impressed!!</li>
    <li> Gives a nice, smooth shave.  Would definitely recommend to a friend as well as a total stranger :) Great  A+</li>
    <li> You should know that I&#x27;m a life long Braun guy.  Here is a histology:  the Braun Activator razor became my razor hero 15 years ago.  When it finally died, I delved into my piggy for the mack daddy $250 Pulsonic or what not.  What a piece of crap that was.  A lotharian of a razor and only about 60% of the shave that I receive with my beloved Activator (which was also $100 cheaper).  Luckily, the airline destroyed that Pulsonic razor and I got a check to pay for a new razor.  I bought the 5 series Braun for $129 and it was like driving a Honda Fit after years of driving a Lexus SC430.  It weighed nothing and the blade seemed to be powered by 3 ants on a treadmill.  I was so depressed.  I finally found an Activator (refurbished)on ebay for $99 and I bought it.  I was happy again.  But over time -- even with blade replacement -- the motor started to die.  I went to amazon in hopes of finding salvation in some review.  I happened upon these reviews and I ordered this razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This razor arrived earlier this week.  I got it out of the box and felt it.  It felt almost as lightweight as the Braun 5 series and I thought, \\&quot;Crap.  Another piece of poo in this pile of blue plastic.\\&quot;  But, I let it charge for a while and then tried it out: WOW.  Just WOW.  I&#x27;m stunned by how well this shaver works.  Not even my precious Activator can match this razor.  It is without a doubt the closest shave I&#x27;ve ever had with an electric shaver.  Bravo, Panasonic.  Bravo.</li>
    <li> This is by far the closest shaving electric razor I have ever owned. Granted it takes some time to do a complete shave (head and face),but it is well worth the time. I switched to Fusion for a week on vacation and regretted taking  my Panasonic,the hand razor was no match for the electric. I highly recommend this item and it works great with Bald Guyz clear shaving gel. Almost forgot,the battery life is very poor on this device.</li>
    <li> A very effective shave, quiet and pleasant to hold.</li>
    <li> In my opinion, the best electric shaver - bar none!</li>
    <li> Item as described. Very happy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Slightly slower than expected delivery from US to Singapore but this was expected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall very happy with description, product and service overall</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this a couple of months now and am really happy with it. A great shave. Easy to clean. I had used Braun shavers for years, but I like the Panasonic better. The end result is the same but I think the Panasonic is a little faster and it deals much better with having skipped a day or two shaving. Also no special cleaning/charging stand and cleaning solution; all it needs is rinsing under the faucet. I use it mostly dry, occasionally wet, but either way a close comfortable shave.</li>
    <li> This is a great razor. Close shave, quick charge, long lasting battery, not much for the trimmer but I don&#x27;t use it</li>
    <li> having used a blade for 50 years and now the panasonic for about one month, I am more than happy with the closeness of the shave.&lt;br /&gt;The shaver has exceeded my expectations. it takes me a little longer to shave with the panasonic but i expect this will improve as i get used to a new way of shaving.</li>
    <li> I have a soft face. I thought my self relegated to manual razors forever. However, I got determined that I wanted to try another electric razor even after failures in the past. I am glad I did. This Panasonic Razor actually works on my face! I am quite pleased. I haven&#x27;t noticed any razor burn at all. My only regret is that I didn&#x27;t spend a bit more to get the self cleaning station. Regardless, if you have had problems in the past finding a razor that worked well on your face, I highly recommend you try this one.</li>
    <li> This shaver does very well with the ease and comfort of shaving with an electric shaver. The cleanup though is rough due to a lack of mini brush.</li>
    <li> This is my 3rd attempt at trying out electric razors, and I believe the old saying &amp;#34;You get what you pay for&amp;#34; is as applicable to this as any product.  In my previous two tries, I went with economically safe choices.  The first was a Norelco rotary razor, and a few years later tried a Braun foil shaver.  Both were about $30.  Both had a tendency to just yank longer whiskers off my face, and the blades got dull in a really short time, making shaving extremely uncomfortable.  The blades were very expensive, so eventually I just shoved the razors in a drawer and went back to blades.  This time, I decided to try a higher-end razor, and it has definitely made a difference.  The key to buying a good razor is RPM&#x27;s, RPM&#x27;s, and RPM&#x27;s!  The higher, the better!  This foil razor was about $140, and is by far the best one I&#x27;ve ever used.  Plus this one is a wet-dry razor, so I can use it in the shower for a warm, wet shave, which I prefer far more than a dry shave.  But if I&#x27;m in a hurry, it also provides a good close shave using it dry and on the go, too.  The blades are also a good quality, as I&#x27;ve had the razor for over a year now, and the blades still shave closely and comfortably.  The only negative I see is that water does seem to get inside.  I can see water when I tap the razor on the bathroom counter, so I know there&#x27;s water trapped inside somewhere.  This can&#x27;t be a good thing for the internal components.  But, so far so good.</li>
    <li> I like this so much I may buy another as a bakcup.</li>
    <li> I have been shaving using electric shavers for 35 years now. I have used Braun, Remington and Philips Norelco. This is my first Panasonic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- Ergonomic shape that easily fit in your hand.&lt;br /&gt;- Close shave, accomplished by 4 blades. The urge to use after-shave or face lotion is less than other shavers.&lt;br /&gt;- The foil perforated pattern seems more robust to breakage unlike Braun that uses honeycomb style that breaks on thick whiskers costing you 40 box a pop!&lt;br /&gt;- Lock button to avoid accidental power-on, beneficial in traveling.&lt;br /&gt;- Can clean the head (foil and cutters) with running water and soap versus blowing and brushing.&lt;br /&gt;- Sonic vibration cleaning. This feature is useful for soap and water cleaning only.&lt;br /&gt;- Independent spring action for each foil.&lt;br /&gt;- Can purchase the cutters and the foil head separately versus Braun that sells them together!&lt;br /&gt;- Charging level indicator.&lt;br /&gt;- The shaver should be ideal for head shaving versus razors for baldies. More cutters the better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- Not usable when it is plugged-in! The technology is there, but Panasonic opted not to include it for liability reasons. The shaver is wet/dry and you may electrocute yourself! Personally I do not shave in the shower so the wet side of wet/dry feature is useless to me.&lt;br /&gt;- The head is too wide for shaving some contour of face effectively such as the upper lip area. The rest of the face should be fine.&lt;br /&gt;- The power cord plugging into and unplugging from the shaver is difficult. Panasonic should have included a docking or wireless charging station.&lt;br /&gt;- Soft traveling case does not protect the shaver when you pack it for traveling. A hard case should have been provided.&lt;br /&gt;- The head does not pivot perpendicular to the foils.&lt;br /&gt;- The lowest charge level of 20% does not correspond to the actual charge in the shaver battery. It is actually higher...close to 35%.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This shaver works well for a 3-day old beard.For shaving the face with longer than 3 days expect some roughness after the shave even if you do not apply a lot of pressure on your face. Overall, I would recommend this shaver. Wish hard case and docking station were included or available even as accessories.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this, along with Taylor of Old Bond Street shaving cream, for 5 months and am completely satisfied.  Pros: (1) No more razor burn.  It handles my 3-4 day beard growth, with a little patience.  (2) Cleanup is easy using the higher speed vibration mode.  I leave the outer foil section off for drying.  The end result is far more clean and sanitary than with my old Norelco.  (3) It charges fast, around an hour or so for me.  (4) The 20-40-60-80-100 remaining charge display is useful.  Cons: (1) Loud.  If your bathroom is right next to where your significant other is sleeping, you might want to think twice about this shaver.  (2) The manual says you get 14 shaves of 3 minutes each on a single charge.  If you look at it as total shaving time per charge that&#x27;s about 42 minutes, which is maybe a little overstated, but it&#x27;s not greatly so.</li>
    <li> Been using electric shavers for 30 years. This is the closest yet.</li>
    <li> My husband will only use THIS SHAVER and they last for YEARS.</li>
    <li> bought for my son who was on crutches and he loves it</li>
    <li> So far very nice shaver.  Only shaver I bought that does not pull or hurt.  Does take a little extra work to get thick hairs, but it does the job well, very smooth shave.  No complaints, happy I choose this one.</li>
    <li> I replaced my ten year old Panasonic razor with this one. I hope it last as long as that amazing razor. After research and experience, I think Panasonic makes the best electric razors anywhere.  This gives me a very close and comfortable shave. I would have given it 5 stars, except for the only two drawbacks, which are:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) No charging stand. My last Panasonic had a nice stand that kept my counter top nice and neat. It is just sloppy to have my razor and cords junking up my sink area. Me no like and it bugs me every day.&lt;br /&gt;2) The trimmer is small... much smaller than my last razor. This is not a big deal since it is still functional, but the narrow trimmer takes longer if I am just trying to trim down my scruff a bit that is too link for the foil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise, great razor. Cool looking and a great shave.</li>
    <li> this devise I have never ever use before , i love it so much and i enjoy what i get.</li>
    <li> I bought this primarily because I can use it in the shower after my pores opened up and I could let the shaving cream sit for a few minutes and soften the hair.  I&#x27;ve noticed that it just doesn&#x27;t shave as closely while wet (though that may be indicative of all electric shavers) but it&#x27;s very close while dry.  It seems to be high quality construction and thus far no gunk has gotten trapped in or underneath the blades.</li>
    <li> Excellent razor that gets as close to a blade shave as you can get.  Works well wet or dry.  It holds it&#x27;s charge for a full work week for me.  I am happy I purchased this product.</li>
    <li> replaced my old braun. nice update. easy to clean without needing to buy special solution. easy to understand power meter</li>
    <li> I used to use an electric shaver but finally quit after too many ingrown whiskers. Now after years of shaving with a blade I had enough of the cuts &amp; gouges on my face. I&#x27;ve had this for about two weeks &amp; so far am very pleased. I&#x27;ve only had to charge it once &amp; no ingrown whiskers. Reviews say it takes a month or so for your face to get used to a shaver. Hopefully that&#x27;s the case because so far I haven&#x27;t been able to get that close a shave on my neck. Satisfied so far though.</li>
    <li> This is the best razor I have ever owned. I didn&#x27;t know you could get this comfortable and close a shave with an electric razor.</li>
    <li> Works great and a smooth shave with very little friction....</li>
    <li> I got this for my boyfriend a year ago and he loves it. He still uses his razor for the shower before work but he uses this in between.</li>
    <li> I believe I am getting a closer shave with this shaver than my last few Norelcos.  It is kind of loud, but it doesn&#x27;t bother me.  It doesn&#x27;t seem to yank out my hairs when I go a couple days between shaving.  So far so good!</li>
    <li> I was not satisfied. I tried this razor dry, wet, dry with cream and wet with cream. It would take me 3 rounds before I was done and I would still need to trim the edges and burns with a razor so I just went back to razor and cream. Nothing beats simplicity.</li>
    <li> What can I say? This thing is the beast! Smoothest blade I have ever used.&lt;br /&gt;My skin also likes it. I have tired my roommate&#x27;s pricy philips norelco 1250x, I would like&lt;br /&gt;to say that this razor is way better and cheaper. Also, I bought it on late night Friday and the package was delivered&lt;br /&gt;on Sunday! Amazing...</li>
    <li> Great razor I have tried others but panasonic makes the best ones my beard is thick my skin cant tolerate regular razor blades so I use wet dry electric razors by far this is the best one yet a fast smooth clean painless shave every time love it.</li>
    <li> This is the best razor I have ever owned.  You can use it dry, wet or in the shower with soap.  Does an excellent job of picking up random &amp;#34;escape hairs&amp;#34; and gives a clean, smooth shave.  My dad has been looking for the &amp;#34;ultimate razor&amp;#34; for many years.  I sent him one of these and he is totally delighted.  Easy to clean, great battery life and easy to hold, even in the shower.  Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> WOW!! For years I have always preferred the rotary style razors over the foil, but this has really changed my mind. It provides an incredibly comfortable shave and the closest to a standard razor that I have found. Cleaning is extremely easy, it literally takes 10-15 seconds and keeps it shaving like new. For those who have tried electric razor after electric razor to find one that you really like I would suggest giving this a try, I&#x27;m confident you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> This product works well whether dry shaving or wet shaving. It does a good job when you use it dry, but will do a closer shave when you use it in wet shaving. It is so easy to clean if you follow the instructions. I have been using this for little over a month and I love it. Would recommend it to anyone else who wants to buy a nice electric razor.</li>
    <li> This is the 4th electric shaver I have owned in the past ten years. I have owned a braun and two norelco&#x27;s that have ranged in price from $50 to $125. I can honestly say that nothing shaves like this Panasonic. The shave is the closest I&#x27;ve seen to a blade.  It shaves on the first pass, literally cutting shaving time in half.  I&#x27;m completely blown away with the way this product performs. Incredible. Two downsides that maybe you need to know. One, the trimmer is not great. It works but trim is a bit uneven. It works fine with sideburns. Second, this little thing is loud.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Summary: This electric shaver is amazing, the best I&#x27;ve ever own. Would buy it again and again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m coming from a Panasonic ES-8807 and that I&#x27;ve had for 8 years. I really liked that shaver but the ES-LF51-A is a much better shaver. Shaves closer easier with less pressure and quicker. Just a all around more comfortable and better shave. The positive reviews are correct. This is a great razor. Don&#x27;t let the very few negative reviews keep you from buying this it&#x27;s one of the best rated shavers on Amazon.</li>
    <li> I have used Braun electric shavers for many years. A true testament to how good this Panasonic shaver is could be reduced to one sentence: this is the best shaver that I ever had!</li>
    <li> To avoid bruises, do not press down too hard.</li>
    <li> Awesome and exceptional shaver.</li>
    <li> this was my first electric razor after years of the 4/5 blade systems and I was not disappointed. I get a closer shave without any irritation and it is great to be able to do a quick shave without lathering up your face - saves time in the morning.</li>
    <li> I bought this to replace my old Panasonic whose battery finally gave up the ghost. What a difference in the shave! This is a great razor, no ifs, ands, or buts.</li>
    <li> My husband likes it a lot ,,he said this is the best Shaver he has ever had.. :)</li>
    <li> Finally I shaved off my beard, and gone back to shaving.  Everyone reviewing this said this was the best shaver they ever had, and damn, it&#x27;s is good as they said.  I shaved with a $54 dollar norelco before, and this cost $139, so it had better be good, right?  Yep - no stubble.  Closer than any razor I&#x27;ve ever used including a 4 bland hand razor, I would say.  A pleasure to use.  I can recommend, but unless you&#x27;re printing or weaving money, you are going to be out of the pocket on this one.  Can&#x27;t say it&#x27;s the best there is, but if there&#x27;s a better one I haven&#x27;t used it and can&#x27;t imagined it.  The only disadvantage I can think of is that it won&#x27;t make your ice cream for you, but then neither will any of the others.  And by the way - it won&#x27;t irritate your skin.  Works right out of the package without charging.</li>
    <li> Purchase for my husband who is well pleased with it as an electric razor. He says it doesn&#x27;t give as close a shave as a manual razor.</li>
    <li> Very close shave, smooth in all directions (unlike a blade, which normally leaves a &amp;#34;knap&amp;#34;). Relatively quiet, Good ergonomics. Only slight negative is you have to clean the heads every other day. If not, it shakes very fine cuttings over your clothes and sink. The rotary Norelcos (which do not cut as closely), are a bit neater.</li>
    <li> its not perfect but it does and excellent job once you know how to use it. i have to shave everyday for work and when i used my trusty old razor i would sometimes cut myself, with this machine  its never happened. my shave is always close and fast. i would buy this again in a heartbeat.</li>
    <li> There was another review I read here before deciding to purchase this razor that said &amp;#34;BUY IT&amp;#34; so I did and holy cow am I glad I did.  Always had a problem with irritation and occasional bumps from regular traditional razors/blades ... I tried them all.  Then I used a Norelco rotary for years (started with the cheaper one and graduated to the best they made hoping for a great shave that was both effortless AND didn&#x27;t carve me up too bad).  Then I decided to break my own paradigm of shaving and think about a foil razor (my dad had one in the stone age and hated it).  So after much research I decided on the Panasonics and the ARC titanium series ... then ultimately on this one.  My very first shave was AWESOME!  Like butter ... with minimal effort and pressure, in half the time of the rotary with no work and no irritation ... ZERO ... NONE.  I have now not had ANY razor irritation about 5 months (since I bought this bad boy) - I cannot recoomend this razor more to anyone on the fence.  I clean it after every use (very easy and takes only a minute with some hand soap and hot running water) in ultra-sonic mode and it still shaves as good today as it did that first day.  To repeat what another wrote ... JUST BUY IT.</li>
    <li> I have had Braun el shaver for decades but I had noticed the 2 last ones didn&#x27;t really do the job well. Somewhere I recalled I had tried another brand many years ago that had worked well. So I gambled and went with Panasonic. What a difference! I have had tis for a couple of months now and it&#x27;s much more efficient. It did cut my shaving time with at least half.&lt;br /&gt; I&#x27;m really pleased.</li>
    <li> This is actuallyThe first time I&#x27;ve taken the time to write a review I recently switched double edge shaving which I really think is the preferred method and the best method however I wanted electric razor I did a lot of research and this is what I went with and I could not be happier with the choice</li>
    <li> And what he learned that is with sensitive skin the is the best razor for a &#x27;NO BURN&#x27; shave.  He tryed it out at our house Christmas morning and loved the results.</li>
    <li> Update:  Now had shaver for 6 days and I continue to be stunned at how much better this is than any shaver I have ever used.  I have used every brand out there so save your time and just buy this one.  They have a 5 blade model which I am sure is even faster but this 4 blade model is great.  They also go down in price as you go to three blades and then two.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is really about the new Panasonic I have now and only used 3 times and it is amazing.  So much closer, easier and quicker.&lt;br /&gt;It is a little noisy compared to the Norelco but shave is so much closer.  I have never really understood the manufacturers claim that your face has to adjust but it seems to be true.  The first shave was good but took some time.  The second shave startled me in how much easier it was and close.  They say 30 days trial to adjust and I think that is true, but this time it just seemed to work so much easier for me in a very short time.  The third time which just happened was great so I saw no need to wait for days to review.  If things change I will update this.</li>
    <li> This razor irritates my skin, I went back to shaving with a manual razor.</li>
    <li> Ok shaver for the price. What I really like is that the trimmings stay in device until cleaned.</li>
    <li> I am a long-time (30+ years) Braun user who was looking for a replacement for my venerable 8975.  After reading both positive and negative reviews of newer Braun models, I concluded that, in light of the many negative comments and high prices, it was time to try a different brand.  I settled on the Panasonic ES-LFI-A Arc 4.  (Why can&#x27;t they come up with simpler model names?)  This model was consistently rated high within the Amazon community and carried a lower price tag.  Hence it was worth a try.  I was pleased with the shaver from the get-go.  Obviously, electric shaver technology has changed a lot since I bought the 8975, so technology advances (such as much faster oscillation) explain a big part of the improved performance.  This razor caused no skin irritation yet gave a much closer shave.  Moreover, unlike the Braun cleaning system, the Panasonic just requires a little liquid soap and water--cheap and effective cleaning.  The soft carrying case will work well for most trips, and the razor is said to be good for 14 daily shaves.  The one-hour recharge is a plus, and the 5-minute quick charge for one shave obviates the need for a corded shaving option.  Finally, this razor is much lighter a easier to handle than my Braun 8975.  I did not give this five stars because I never give five stars unless a product exceeds my expectations.</li>
    <li> I had the Norelco  senso 3d which was good until the changed the h ad to cheaper version. I bought this although it&#x27;s still not as close a shave as a blade it&#x27;s really good for an electric. Holds its charge for a week and recharging take like 60min also easy to clean was other electrics I have had. For this price I this it beats Norelco and Braun.</li>
    <li> Excellent product and worth the money.  Shaves close, not as close as I can get with a razor blade but still very good. None of my electric shavers get that close and I have owned several different major brands. It holds a charge that allows several shaves before recharging.  I have no regrets buying this shaver and would recommend it.</li>
    <li> Have used for about a week now. Fairly impressive. My old Braun 7502 lost the ability to hold a charge, so instead of just replacing the batteries, I decided it was time for a new razor. Looked at the Panasonic&#x27;s back when I bought the 7502, but the nice ones seemed to be stupid expensive.&lt;br /&gt;Fast forward to today, and well Panasonic still has some stupid expensive razors. I was pretty much resigned to spending more for &amp;#34;features&amp;#34; I didn&#x27;t want in the new Braun line ( I don&#x27;t want a cleaning station ).&lt;br /&gt;The Panasonic LA63 looked interesting, but the two motors made it unappealing, as a number of reviews stated it makes it top heavy. I have joint problems, an unbalanced razor is something I can&#x27;t suffer with. The 63 also seems to have a small but worrisome reliability issue.&lt;br /&gt;The LV61 seemed to have none of these issues, but even though the price has come way down, still very expensive.&lt;br /&gt;Then I found this little gem.&lt;br /&gt;Single motor, well balanced.&lt;br /&gt;4-blades, head not to large.&lt;br /&gt;nice ring lock/button like the LV61.&lt;br /&gt;Not stupid expensive.&lt;br /&gt;After a week of use, best dry shave I have ever had. Used it wet once during the week before going out to dinner, exceptional shave, did not have to go over the area with a blade to &amp;#34;touch it up&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;overall I consider this shaver to be an exceptional value.&lt;br /&gt;Battery charge has lasted a full week with it says 40% left.&lt;br /&gt;The only pick I have is the trimmer is hidden by the head, if using it with a hand mirror to trim the hairs on the back of your neck, it&#x27;s next to impossible to see what damage your doing.</li>
    <li> I was very skeptical that a shaving experience could be worth the money for this razor, but making this purchase has shifted my perspective. This device provides a powerful, comfortable shave beyond what I&#x27;ve experienced before. I usually go for razors in the $70 to $90 range and have been happy with them. I&#x27;m more than happy with this item for the few months I&#x27;ve had it, I&#x27;m on the verge of ecstatic.</li>
    <li> The item is good enough to shave for my sensitive skin. thanks for a good deal.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing. I have an autistic son who hates to be touched - much less shaved each morning. It&#x27;s quiet and works well with shaving cream. Our mornings are much easier now. Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> Close shave, long battery life, gives me baby face smoothness. No complaints with this shaver. Had older panasonic before dog got hold of it and didn&#x27;t think it could get any better and this one is.</li>
    <li> I have been a Norelco shaver user for many years.  I have not been satisfied with the closeness of the shave so I thought I&#x27;d give the Panasonic a try.  As the song says, Night and day.  The Panasonic gives a closer, smoother shave in half the time.  Although I had one of the high end Norelco&#x27;s it could not perform close to the Panasonic.  I like the ease in cleaning the shaver.  The replacement parts are much cheaper than the Norelco.  If I had to find a fault with the Panasonic it would be the short time it keeps a charge.  Four to five days is the best I can get from this shaver.  Not a big deal, I plug it in and it&#x27;s ready by time I need it.  I would recommend this shaver and for those that have difficult beards to shave this shaver will do the job.</li>
    <li> I have used many different brands of shavers over the years.  I thought my old Remington gave a good shave but it finally gave up the ghost, so I bought this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a truly great shaver.  It shaves closer than anything I have tried.  It is solid and well made and I anticipate that it will last a good, long while.  No electric will match a blade shave but this one comes very close (no pun intended).  Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Outstanding shaving experience!  I actually look forward to shaving now.  Had a Braun but this one is quieter and quicker.</li>
    <li> This is the shaver I am looking for and would recommend to other people. Perfect design and quiet. This is a replace of a 23 year old Panasonic Shaver with trimmer.</li>
    <li> Battery life is excellent but quality of the shave is not as clean as I thought it would be. Still superior than the lowest tier electric razors though.</li>
    <li> I have been shaving with a blade for a long time and decided to try an electric shaver. It gives a close shave and cleans up very fast and easy.</li>
    <li> Worst electric shaver I&#x27;ve used. It did not work for my hair (too thick perhaps?) I followed the directions and the shave would generally give me a &#x27;trim&#x27; but took 10 or 12 passes plush pushing with considerable force to get even a remotely close shave. I won&#x27;t say there&#x27;s no possibility of user error, but after using it for a month with various techniques and methods, it&#x27;s still always come up short to my old cheap electric razor... which is disappointing. Guess I will stick with manual razors for now.</li>
    <li> Not as close of a shave as a fixed blade razor gives, but darn close, and easy clean-up. I&#x27;m not generally a fan of electric razors, but this one has changed my mind. I recommended it to my Mom as a gift to my Dad...</li>
    <li> I own and have used the Panasonic ES8243A for the past two years. This shaver has a similar profile but does a better job. It leaves less stubble and requires fewer passes over the same area. The trimmer is more robust and easier to use in either direction. After two weeks of every other day use I have had to charge it only once. The plastic cover comes off easily and does not take the head with it as it does on the ES8243A. Though this is suggested as a face shaver I have used it on my shoulders and upper back to great effect - better then devices designed for this purpose.  I cannot imagine a better more efficient shaver.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband for Christmas. He really loves it. He says it is the best one he has ever used!</li>
    <li> This works very well, is easy to clean and has a little extra trimmer that pops out for sideburns or eyebrows. It does not fall apart like some of the rotary razors I have purchased in the past.</li>
    <li> My husband said this is the best shaver he ever had. Very easy and comfortable to use. Great product. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I have owned 6 or 7 Norelco razors over the last 25 years and thought nothing could beat it. I have owned the most expensive down to the least expensive Norelco.  It is funny the least expensive always did better shaving.  My wife purchased a Braun foil razor for her dad and one day I gave it a try and was amazed how much better it was.  I started doing research and the Panasonic ES-LF51-A was always highly rated.  My Norelco blades needed replacing so I thought I would try the Panasonic. I purchased it a little over a month ago and am still amazed.  I waited a full month to give this review to be sure and I can confidently state this foil razor runs circles around the rotary Norelco&#x27;s.  I cannot comment on life of blades or anything like that but if you want a shaver that will do the job on the first pass this is the one.</li>
    <li> By far the best shave I have had with an electric shaver.  I have used Norelco and Braun and the Panasonic gives me a close shave without irritating my skin.  I do use a cream/gel to shave and this allows a very close shave.</li>
    <li> I got the unit complete as listed and the finish quality is awesome. Except for the noise (ok for linear motor), too good design. I am happy to recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I bought this Panasonic shaver because I thought it would work great, would be good quality, and would not leave razer burn.  It does not leave razer burn but the quality if poor.  It does not leave a close shave, the power is not good, and the trim peace on the back of the back of the shaver hurts. I have bought $30 shavers from Walmart that work better than this one.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t like it and returned it after the first use.</li>
    <li> Really close shave, works amazing.  Little to no irritation.  The pop up trimmer isn&#x27;t very good though.  Highly recommend this razor.  Love the easy cleaning function.</li>
    <li> I bought this shaver because I wasn&#x27;t satisfied with the shave or comfort of a Braun I had owned and this shaver had the highest user rating on Amazon of any shaver sold at any price.  Without going into great detail, let me say that this is not only the best shaver I have ever owned (I&#x27;m 64) but probably the best you can buy.  First and foremost, it gives an incredibly close shave.  There is absolutely no pinching or pulling of hairs.  It handles the jawline very effectively.  It handles long hairs reasonably well.  The side trimmer is great.  Finally, it is very comfortable to hold and the charge lasts forever.  I just love it.</li>
    <li> I have tried every and I mean every wet-dry electric made.  This one is quiet and smooth and very sharp.  Bought it tried it shave daily with it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:  good value/very quiet/extremely sharp without biting or nicking/never have worn one out/easy to clean/easy to hold/charge last for one week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:  replacement charger difficult to replace online.  Don&#x27;t lose it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My top recommendation.  Panasonic customer service is excellent. Get this razor, you won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
    <li> Purchased this for my 94 year old neighbor. As most elderly people he doesn&#x27;t like change or anything different. But he really likes this shaver.  It is much quieter than his older shavers.  It gives him a wonderfully close shave, and he&#x27;s extremely particular being a retired watch repairman.  It doesn&#x27;t come with a cleaning brush. I explained to him that it&#x27;s to be cleaned by water. But we kept cleaning brushes from old shavers which help with cleaning.</li>
    <li> A fantastic electric shaver. I could not ask for more.</li>
    <li> High Quality Product! Fantastic Shave! Quiet motor, the battery holds a good and long charge.  Easy to clean! Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> I had read all the reviews and was a little skeptical overall. But after the razor arrived and I gave it a few tries, I have been extremely pleased with the build of it and the performance. Definitely the best electric razor I have purchased.</li>
    <li> I am completely satisfied. It gives a very  good shave with no irritation of the skin. The price is decent, I would recommend this item to all users who want a good razor.</li>
    <li> I replaced a braun shaver which I considered high maintenance. I have owned this panasonic shaver for 10 months and it is so easy to up keep and I get a closer shave than I ever did with the braun, plus I am saving money not having to buy solution and occasionally parts. I would buy this shaver again in a heart beat...</li>
    <li> Comparable to a wet razor. I&#x27;m impressed, I really am.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also like the readout that shows how far the recharge has progressed.</li>
    <li> This product is great for my sensitive neck.  I had a rotary shaver before and it destroyed my neck, after a lot of research I decided on this shaver. Best shaver ever! It shaves very close and my skin hardly ever gets irritated.</li>
    <li> 11/27/2013: I&#x27;ve come back to add this to my review. Soon after I had written the below, my face started to bleed in spots, 3-4+ hours after I had shaved. So although this was a great shaver, I suppose my skin was too sensitive to it, so I had to return it. I&#x27;ve returned to my rotary (1260X) and bought new blades for it, couldn&#x27;t be happier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had the latest Philips / Norelco rotary shaver, and have been using rotary shavers all my life. It was a big question on weather or not to go to linear style. I can say that this shaver gives a closer shave without a doubt, and the sound is not as bad as it is in some review videos. I thought the sound would really bother me, but I don&#x27;t even pay attention to it anymore, doesn&#x27;t bother me in the least.&lt;br /&gt;Again, great shave, feels of quality, looks good, and to me seems like the entry level of the higher end models.&lt;br /&gt;My negatives are that the case included is not that great, you could get any bag and throw the shaver in and it would offer the same protection (or lack thereof!) and its not really a cool looking bag/pouch. Also, there is no stand, which again, I think would make it look cooler, but not a big deal.&lt;br /&gt;Lastly, battery. I notice that it seems to be going down the battery meter pretty quick. I think perhaps a lot of people haven&#x27;t used or charged the battery enough to get it to its max. Many times batteries in electronics need to be cycled a few times to reach full capacity. Even still, charge time is only 1 hour so its not a huge deal. If you found it dead, charge it while you take a shower and it should be ready for a shave when you come out!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love it.  Great Product</li>
    <li> Previously I had the Arc3, which I also gave 4 stars...I knocked off a star for battery life, otherwise it was frigging amazing.  Lo and behold, I lost that one...don&#x27;t ask me how...and I replaced it with this Arc4 from Best Buy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Whoah!  This Shaver is bitchin&#x27;.  Battery life is excellent, and it shaves so damned quickly...and the shave is even closer than the Arc3.  Prior to these, I had Norelcos for years, and never really found the shave very comfortable.  This thing us more comfortable than a Norelco, and it does a better job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Chuck Norris likely used this Shaver to trim his manly beard.</li>
    <li> The Panasonic ES-LF51-A is the best electric shaver I have ever had.  I have owned Remington rotary, Braun series 5 and other lower-end Panasonic electric shavers in the past. Shaving with the LF51 gave me a pretty close shave even better than the Braun series 5 which I really liked.  Using the LF51 with shaving gel (I use King of Shaves Alphagel) gives me an even closer shave (it still isn&#x27;t closer than a razor though).  I think shavers are very personal and what works for one person may not work for another since each person&#x27;s face and beard are different.  Here are some good things about the shaver: Easy cleanup, just run a little liquid soap rinse and its clean;Gives a pretty close shave for electric; Only takes one hour to fully charge; Has a quick charge feature; It&#x27;s a wet/dry shaver.  Here are some negatives: You can hear the power decrease as you run the battery down each day (I takes a little more time to shave as the battery power decreases); The blades vibrate very fast and the foil surface gets hot. As long as I keep the shaver moving its not a problem;  The instructions say you can get about 14 shaves at 3 min per shave. It takes me at least 5 min. to get a decent shave not 3 min.; You have to wait for the shaver to dry before recharging if you use it wet; The side burn feature could be better;  Needs a stand so it can be dried on the sink;  For me it doesn&#x27;t make sense to use the wet/dry feature, you can shave closer, faster and cleanup faster with a razor.  Despite all my negatives I still like this shaver.  I just hope it will last as long as the Braun did.</li>
    <li> Great--smooth as a sharp edge razor!</li>
    <li> With all my bad luck using my last Norelco razor I was about to just grow a beard.  After reading several reviews on different razors I jumped in and ordered this Panasonic.  Not that shaving will ever be my favorite thing to do, but this razor takes all the anxiety of shaving away, saves me time and gives me a great shave.  I&#x27;ve never used shaving cream with an electric razor before but this razor works perfect with the cream.  I highy recommend this product.</li>
    <li> good luck spending $50~60 on the replacement foil.</li>
    <li> Razor work very well for my husband, he uses it mainly for shaving his head and just loves it but does brake out when he shaves his face</li>
    <li> Have used it for almost a year works fine.</li>
    <li> I bought elsewhere, but thought I would help folks with a review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I began shaving with an electric over 20 years ago.  Upgraded to my first higher-end shaver with a Braun several years ago.  Was a major step up, as the technology had so improved.  The problem then - the foil was so delicate - and a fortune to replace (and it would eat my face, literally, if not replaced).  Bought another Braun that lasted a couple of years, and it was somewhat better - as it was among the first with &amp;#34;sonic&amp;#34; technology - aka, the super-fast blade oscillation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then, on the suggestion of a family member, bought my first Panasonic shaver. It too had the fast blade movement, and it shaved a bit better than the previous Braun.  And recently, that razor has finally reached a point it is no longer doing its job well - needs foils and blades replaced - and the battery doesn&#x27;t hold a charge as long, nor is it as &amp;#34;powerful&amp;#34; as it once was... so it was time to shop again.  WOW have prices gone up!  So doing my diligence, I settled on this Panasonic ES-LF51-A.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All I can say is WOW!!!!!!  Boy has technology moved forward!  This razor is louder than my previous Panasonic, but it shaves FAR better than the old one.  Indeed, I have shaved one side with a traditional razor, the other with my new Panasonic - then had my wife try to guess which side was which.  She only guessed correctly because of a small nick on my neck from the traditional razor!!!  Both sides felt the same - nice and smooth!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great Razor!</li>
    <li> I tried many top-model razors a couple of months ago and then got tired of returning them. My Norelco was still hanging in there but really wasn&#x27;t doing a good job... so I went back for a last try and fell upon this model: best electric razor I&#x27;ve ever owned, by far. No burn, fast shave, easy to clean, great to travel with. This is the way to go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 2 months after purchase:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just got back from a trip to the rain forest in Latin America. Hot and humid conditions have always made shaving feel like hell (I have very sensitive skin). I know, you might wonder why one would shave in the middle of the rain forest. That&#x27;s another story (and it&#x27;s not that Panasonic paid for my trip down there to test their product. Shame on them.) Well... even in the jungle I felt no burn (putting aside mosquito bites...) The 5 stars still hold. Let&#x27;s hope the shaver does too!</li>
    <li> I love using this razor! It seems like i have the most sensitive skin and I&#x27;ve always needed to use Afta or some other gel to keep from feeling razor burn all morning. With this i don&#x27;t even need to bother. Get&#x27;s as close a shave as you&#x27;re going to get with a electric razor. Takes me about 5 mins to shave in the morning. Cleans up the neck really well and leaves no irritation for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This razor cleans so easily and I don&#x27;t have to worry about getting the wrong parts wet. The beard trimmer is adequate and gets the job done. I&#x27;ve used it to trim down my whole face to make it easier for the razor to finish up when I&#x27;ve let my beard grow out for about a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The battery lasts a lot longer than I thought it would! I get about a week or more out of it when shaving about every other day.</li>
    <li> Bought this for a person with a disability, but tried it first.  Was it ever smooth!  No &amp;#34;pull&amp;#34; or nicks. I have been buying Remington and Norelco for years.  No comparison!  Am anxious for him to use it.</li>
    <li> Works great but there will be occasions where I have to run it through the same spot over and over again just to cut the missed facial hair.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been sold on Panasonic shavers for years.&lt;br /&gt;After many years had to replace my old one.&lt;br /&gt;This ES-LF51a  provides a very quick shave&lt;br /&gt;though it doesn&#x27;t work while plugged in.&lt;br /&gt;Also very quiet.&lt;br /&gt;Recommended highly.&lt;br /&gt;Amazon delivered promptly.</li>
    <li> I have used about 6 electric shavers over some 25 years.  I have tried Norelco and returned it immediately.  I have had several Braun shavers, all of which were very good products.  Braun is super reliable.  My opinion of electric shavers before I bought this Panasonic was they could never match a manual multi-blade razor for closeness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have had this for about a week.  I have shaved with it dry and wet.  I am impressed with how fast I could finish and incredibly impressed with how close it got on all areas of my face.  It does better when I wet shave.  Only I could tell the difference between this and my 5 blade manual razor.  I used to only use an electric when I needed to quickly mow down the stubble and the closeness wasn&#x27;t as important.  I&#x27;m rethinking that idea.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cleanup is easy. My last Braun electric had a cleaning stand with smelly cleaning fluid.  The self cleaning process didn&#x27;t take any of my time, but I thought it was a waste of electricity and money to buy more cleaning fluid.  I also couldn&#x27;t travel with that.  Now I just take off the head, hold down the power button for 2 seconds so it goes into sonic cleaning mode, and rinse it under water.  Ta Da!  Shake it off, pat it with a towel, put the head back on and it&#x27;s ready for next time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The head is not too large.  The razor is easy to hold and maneuver.  I haven&#x27;t used the trimmer and probably won&#x27;t. Dedicated beard trimmers have better tools for that job.  I have a goatee and sometimes with my older Braun electric it would grab and pull my whiskers when I shaved close to them.  This razor has not done that once.  I don&#x27;t worry about a mirror in the shower because I can shave right up to the goatee without issues.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The locking power button is a nice touch.  The travel case is too small to carry both the razor and the power plug.  Definitely not a deal breaker.  I have enough little travel cases left over from other products or I can find one at a thrift store if I really need to carry them both in the same case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I charged it fully when I got it. I have shaved about 5 times.  It still flashes 80% power level. I tried the Kiss My Face product that other users suggested.  It works well with an electric wet shaver.  I guess I&#x27;m a convert from foamy shaving cream too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave it 4 stars for now.  I&#x27;m holding out for awhile until I can get a better idea of how long the battery lasts and durability of the razor and blades.if I really need to carry them both in the same case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I charged it fully when I got it.

    <li> Let me start by saying that I am  reviewing this against the terrible $50 women&#x27;s electric razors I have bought in the past.  I should also clarify that I don&#x27;t have a beard and use this mainly on my legs, underarms, etc.  That being said, this thing is amazing.  It&#x27;s not quite as close of a shave as using a razor in the shower, but definitely close.  So far I&#x27;ve only used it dry, but the results are fantastic.  Very happy with the purchase!</li>
    <li> So far so good.  Much better than my cheap Phillips/Norelco rotary shaver, which never cut close enough.  This Panasonic cuts close, but not as close as a regular razor, but it&#x27;s the next best thing.  I&#x27;ve experimented using it in the shower, and it does a pretty good job.  It has a problem with longer hairs on my neck, but I have never seen an electric that can get those.  I have not yet tried it with lotion yet, but I will.  When you turn it on, it&#x27;s kinda loud and feels like it has some power.  Much more power than a rotary razor.  Cleaning is simple, it has an ultra sonic cleaning function, and not a lot of complex parts like a rotary shaver.  Can you tell I now hate rotary shavers?  Overall, I&#x27;d give it an excellent rating so far.  I&#x27;ll update if there&#x27;s any more.  Great razor.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this shaver once and based on that, it is excellent. The shave was close and painless. If it continues to work this well over time I will consider it one of the best products I have ever bought from Amazon. UPDATE: I&#x27;ve had this shaver for about three months. My recommendation: It&#x27;s excellent. Keep in mind: I do not shave every day. I do not have a heavy beard. But I still can compare it to all other shavers I&#x27;ve used, mostly three-head rotary. This is far superior, in my opinion.</li>
    <li> This thing cuts through a tough beard easily and is easy on the skin.  The head is a bit large, but you get used to it.  Lasts about 45 minutes on a charge.  Panasonic quality.</li>
    <li> I used to own a Braun shaver and decided to purchase this one because of the good reviews and price. One of the best decisions, I&#x27;ve made. I love it.</li>
    <li> This panasonic eslf51-a is one of the best razors on the market. I got mine last week and couldnt wait to try it. It is so light ,i couldnt belive it.&lt;br /&gt;I have mostly used Braun shavers all my shaveing life and i have been shaveing for fifty five years. Tryed norelco and remington once ,not good razors.&lt;br /&gt;Braun is a good razor, but i heard abought this Panasonic and after reading all the good reviews,I had to try it. Well so far im glad I did it is begining to be nice to shave again. It is really a remarkable razor,I pluged it in and less&lt;br /&gt;than an hour it was fully charged. After I started to shave (dry) it glided over my face and neck and in about five to ten minutes I was done and my face was smooth,no stubble. Opened the top ran water through it turned it on for a few min and put the top back on. I love it,hope it stays running good for a long time to come.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t even think about it, just buy this razor!  I have used Braun and many other brand name electric razors in the past but Panasonic has them all beat hands down.  This is my second Panasonic electric razor and the only reason I purchased a second was to hand down the first razor to my son.  The battey seams to last forever and the blades are second to none.  Closest, most comfortable shave available with out using a razor blade and no bloody cuts to worry about.  No, I am NOT affiliated with Panasonic at all.  I am just an older gent that thinks they make an excellent electric razor so I am giving them a big thumbs up!  I am the type of man that would tell the world about a crappy item so I also have to tell it like it is when I find a excellent product.  By the way the cheapest place I found it was at Amazon.com</li>
    <li> The best I&#x27;ve ever had, both wet and dry. Clearly beats Remington and Braun.</li>
    <li> Works as I expected use to clean up when I&#x27;m at work.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using electric shavers for 25 years and have tried several brands and models....cheap ones, expensive ones, you name it.  This shaver is the best I&#x27;ve ever owned.  It&#x27;s very quiet, shaves super fast and smooth and is easy to clean up since it&#x27;s waterproof.  I can shave in about 2-3 minutes, compared to 8-10 minutes with my old shaver and get a much better shave.  Do yourself a favor and buy this shaver.  You can probably spend more money, but I don&#x27;t think you can get a better shaver.  Definitely don&#x27;t waste your money on the $50 ones.  You&#x27;ll be glad you spent the extra money for this one.</li>
    <li> 2nd panasonic razor for me.....better than any others I&#x27;ve tried....and I&#x27;ve tried a lot of brands....these have beat them all handily</li>
    <li> I use Trader Joe&#x27;s shave cream and it works great.  Took a month for my sin to adapt. Still the occasional neck hair that gets missed, but the flip up attachment gets the stragglers easily.  Powerful, quick, close shave.  And I have sensitive skin.  Suggestion...don&#x27;t press hard, better to do multiple passes from different angles.</li>
    <li> I have owned a number of electric razors and have never been happy with how they work and end up going back to a blade for a closer shave. This razor was a gift and I was ready to be disappointed yet again but to my surprise it shaved better than any blade or electric razor I have ever used. A great clean close shave that will not disappoint.</li>
    <li> All I can say is... holy crap. This thing is amazing. I&#x27;ve tried multiple razors throughout my life and they all leave my neck raw and burning. I have very sensitive skin, normally if I don&#x27;t shave everyday with my fusion proglides I have to wait till day 4, anything earlier eats me alive. I jumped in on day two, a really close shave, not quite as smooth as the proglide, but I expected that, still really close for electric. I have no burn, which is awesome.</li>
    <li> Best Shaver I have ever had.</li>
    <li> best electric shaver I&#x27;ve evey had. easy to clean. fast recharge. excellent product. would recommend it to anyone.&lt;br /&gt;a best buy.</li>
    <li> Great razor!  Switched from Braun to Panasonic with ease - no skin irritation.  This razor shaves very well and charges quickly.</li>
    <li> I bought this based upon the reviews here and elsewhere. I am coming from a rotary shaver (Norelco SmartTouch 9160 XL), but I normally have not been keeping a close shave over the past several years (by choice). When I did have to shave, I found the results a little below expectations and rather uncomfortable. I have recently decided to keep a closer shave more regularly and that razor was just not working out for me. After a lot of research, I decided on the ES-LF51-A.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Out of the package I was a little surprised by how compact the unit was, both the body and the head(s).  It fits comfortably in my hand and is well balanced. The sound of the unit is along the lines of a high pitched squeal, but it&#x27;s not very loud and doesn&#x27;t bother me at all. I tested it out with a dry shave on 3.5 days of growth. It gave me a much more closer shave than my previous unit (which admittedly had older blades in need of replacement) in slightly less time than my normal shave time over the past week. My face feels significantly less irritated, but not irritant free, as I have sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The unit was very easy to clean and I like that it has special cleaning settings. The locking features are a great addition as well.  I&#x27;ll update this after a couple weeks in regards to the closeness, irritation level and shaving time that this unit provides. If it can do this well on 3+ days growth, I&#x27;m curious to see how it does with 2 or 1. Very pleased with my purchase so far. Thanks to everyone else for providing their reviews.</li>
    <li> It is a great shaver.  Easy to clean.</li>
    <li> Keeping this short - everyone&#x27;s already said enough - this is the best electric shaver I&#x27;ve ever used. It&#x27;s quality, it cuts so nice, and I love that it&#x27;s wet/dry and easily cleanable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh, and yes, I&#x27;ve gone through quite a few electric shavers in my time while I was in the military.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t leave many reviews but after using this shaver I just had to say how amazing it is.  This thing is worth every penny and I am so glad I bought it. My old $100 razor went straight in the trash after using this one time.  If you need a razor buy this one!</li>
    <li> What can I say, this shaver really does the job. It takes a little time, but the results are great. I have sensitive skin between my lower lip and my chin. I always breakout with a rash and bumps when I use other elec. shavers or razers. But to my surprise this shaver has done the job and I have not had any rashes or breakouts of bumps using it. I&#x27;ve used it several times now with pleasing results. I&#x27;m truly satisfied with it, so I would highly recommend it to anyone who has sensitive skin with thick facial hair. Panasonic you&#x27;ve made my shaving experience a pleasure, Thank you.</li>
    <li> This is an awesome razor.  I had been reading reviews about electric razors for weeks before deciding on this one.  Of course, everyone knows about the Braun line and how good they are.  I had a Braun 3 series and it was good but it was a budget razor, I think I paid $40 for it 3 years ago so it wouldn&#x27;t be fair to compare this Panasonic to a $40 Braun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It basically came down to Braun versus Panasonic.  To me, I felt the Panasonic gave me more razor for my money since I did not need the cleaning system for the razor, I can clean my own razor.  This gives a nice close shave, just about as close as a razor.  I&#x27;m in the military so I shave each day.  The battery life has been nice, I especially like the 20-40-60-80-100% meter on the front, it gives me an idea of when I&#x27;ll need to charge.  I like the tilting head, it enables me to hit spots that a non-tilting head would miss.  Yes it is noisy but you&#x27;re only shaving for 60-90 seconds so it shouldn&#x27;t be a big enough factor to keep someone from buying this.</li>
    <li> It was not without remorse that I decided to retire my Panasonic ES8086 but considering it&#x27;s old enough to vote and I was only getting 3 shaves per charge (still not bad for an original battery) I made the leap to the ESLF51A. My new razor is wonderful! I don&#x27;t have a monster beard but can definitely get blade close with shaving cream. Nice ergonomics. The 14,000 rpm gives lovely smooth shave even dry. At a great amazon price, this is the king of electric shavers and I can only look forward to Panasonic&#x27;s quality delivering another 20 years.</li>
    <li> First of all, I have to say that I am comparing this to my old Remington Titanium shaver that is more than ten years old. It didn&#x27;t shave all that well in the first place so this one is a dream in comparison. It took a long time and was hard on my skin. I always had to follow-up with a blade razor to get what it missed. Oh, and did I say it was loud?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are the good points with the Panasonic that really make it a winner for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. The first thing I appreciated when I first turned it on was how quiet it was. It makes more of a buzzing sound that is not obnoxious. It does get a little loud close to your ear but nothing like the Remington.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. I decided to try my first shave with shaving cream and it worked like a charm through the suds. I had quit trying to shave that way with the Remington because it got bogged down and slid over the whiskers. The Panasonic wasn&#x27;t fazed and mowed down everything in its path....even on my neck. After washing off the soap I did have to follow-up in a couple of spots that I missed seeing because of the soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. The next thing I noticed was that this shaver gave me a shave rivaling a blade razor.....my face was that smooth. No hairs on the neck to deal with or other hard to shave spots like around the nose and ears.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4. This one was the best. My skin felt great! No razor burns, cuts or abrasions. A little lotion and I was good to go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5. Finally, this shaver is very fast. I decided to see how well it shaved if I was in a hurry. So, with one day of growth, I shaved dry with no preparation. It took me all of two minutes and came out almost as well as shaving with soap. The skin felt almost as good....just a very slight irritation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only ding I would give it is the trimmer. It will do sideburns just fine but if you are as old as I am there is hair on the ears that need to be taken care of. The trimmer is lower down and the head gets in the way at certain anglesbut that is a minor point for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a very good shaver here on Amazon that no one else comes close to for price per my PriceBlink toolbar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One final thing I would like to add is my beard, I would guess, is about average so you can gauge how it would do on your beard. I have a feeling this shaver would handle a heavy beard really well.</li>
    <li> I bought this shaver because of product loyalty.  I&#x27;ve had a similar model for the past 3 years and it has held up extremely well.  I felt it was time to upgrade so I bought this one to replace it.  This model is equally if not more impressive.  I get a terrific shave each and every time.  It is definitely one of the best shavers on the market and the quality that you are getting for the price is unbeatable.</li>
    <li> It is really good. It is better and cheaper than my old shaver, Braun 550cc. The noise could have been quieter. If you buy it you&#x27;ll have no regrets.</li>
    <li> Great product, it provides a good shave compared to regular razors.  The only downside is the trimmer doesn&#x27;t work very well.</li>
    <li> very good shave and doesn&#x27;t hurt your skin, so my boyfriend would say. He also keeps thanking me for it, so it has to be good.</li>
    <li> Used Norelco shavers for many Years and tried this one since the Norelco ones look great now but are not  good anymore.&lt;br /&gt;From the first shave this is the best shaver I ever owned. Only issue is the sound. Quiet noisy and sounds like a dentist drill..</li>
    <li> This is a comfortable way to shave if using an electric shaver. It does not pull at your hair and cuts reasonably close for an electric. There is no electric shaver on this planet or any adjoining planet that can shave as close as a Gillette Atra or some similar type of razor. But there are times when a close shave is not a necessity and in those instances this Panasonic will do an adequate job. It is comfortable to hold and is fairly quiet. It charges up quickly and holds its charge for plenty of time to do a complete shave. I have had numerous electric shavers and this is among the top of the line.</li>
    <li> My last 3 shavers were Braun&#x27;s and this is clearly the best I have had.  Quicker and closer shave than I have had with any of the others.  I found it because it stands out in the ratings - and I see why.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had Norelco and Braun electric as well as years using a blade - and, this Panasonic is the best ever.  Very rapid blades, easy to clean and hold charge forever.  I&#x27;ve used it for two months and recommended it to several friends.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used a few different brands/styles over the years.  This one works great compared to the rest.  Battery life is pretty strong too.</li>
    <li> This does a much better job and quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Guys, if you&#x27;re over 50 you&#x27;ll still want a blade shave once or twice a week to get those fine hairs on the lower neck line.&lt;br /&gt;The reason you miss them is that you&#x27;re not wearing your reading glasses while shaving.</li>
    <li> This did not meet our expectations. After doing extensive reviews on razors this appeared to be the best.  However, it is not cutting hair.</li>
    <li> Works extremely well! As other reviewers (and the instructions in the box) have mentioned, it takes a couple of weeks for your skin to get used to it but once it does, it shaves just as close as a razor. This was my first venture into the electric shaver world and I&#x27;m very glad I chose this one. For me, it seems to work better when wet shaving than dry shaving.</li>
    <li> My dad gave me a Norelco Shave in the early sixties and I was very loyal to Norelco for 15-20 years and then switched to foil shavers for a cleaner shave especially on tuff areas on the neck and jaw. I bought the best Panasonic  and Braun had to offer a few of which were over $300.00 dollars and none of them are even close to the LF51 which I have only had for a couple weeks but has cut my shaving time in have.</li>
    <li> I thought it would be better,,,i shave my head and I wished I had waited and got the 5 blade,,,it just takes a while to shave</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had a few electric shavers in my lifetime, and this one is the best I&#x27;ve used by far.  In every day use over about a month, I&#x27;ve found that it provides a great shave wet or dry.  I prefer to use it with a shave soap most mornings, and the easy clean up is so much better than the messy and expensive self cleaning system my previous shaver employed.  I just pop the head off the shaver, put it in cleaning mode, and run it under warm water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tend to use this method of shaving during the week before work, and a double-edge safety razor on the weekends as I have the time and enjoy pampering myself a little.  Who doesn&#x27;t, right?  I&#x27;d use the DE every day if I had the time as nothing shaves closer, but the Panasonic shaver works great for me and gets me out the door on those early mornings.  I&#x27;m sure everyone&#x27;s results will vary with these kinds of things, but if you&#x27;re in the market for a good electric shaver, I&#x27;d recommend considering this Panasonic.</li>
    <li> My husband loves it. Lightweight and keeps a good charge for an extended period of time. Just wish it had a brush.</li>
    <li> Very unimpressed... I had high hopes based on the excellent reviews. I have a thick beard, but it misses spots on the neck that no amount of stretching or contorting of the skin or razor can rectify. Takes entirely too long as well if you don&#x27;t shave daily. I didn&#x27;t realize an electric shaver can&#x27;t handle a few days scruff. Still pulls longer hairs also despite the 14000 rpm&#x27;s. Very tough to use around a goatee or mustache as well as the head is larger than the cutting surface. The trimmer is weak and cuts unevenly, not to mention it is occluded by the razor itself due to it&#x27;s positioning. You&#x27;re essentially trimming blind in most positions.&lt;br /&gt;The Pros- It did a decent job on the cheeks and jawbones. Almost as close as a razor. Doesn&#x27;t come close to making up for having to finish your neck with a manual razor.</li>
    <li> The quest to find a great shaver is a frustrating one. Here are a few of the negatives of this shaver:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;--It cannot be used while it is recharging, unlike all previous shavers I have had. This means I need to keep my old shaver as a backup so that I can shave for work when this unit poops out.&lt;br /&gt;-- It is really loud. I don&#x27;t mind, but the dogs start barking when they hear it.&lt;br /&gt;-- It does not shave all that close. I am not a hairy guy, but I can look unshaven by the afternoon, well before 5 o&#x27;clock.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one upside is that it is relatively fast. The shaving surface area is relatively broad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This review is after shaving with it (dry, by the way) for about two months.</li>
    <li> Light weight , works well. Shave is smooth and charge lasts a week . Recommend it. Better than the braun i raplaced</li>
    <li> I love it. If you are thinking of buying this shaver, look no further. The charge lasts at least 6 days, probably more. The machine feels nice in your hand, and the buttons are great. I love that its immersible. I love how easy to clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two things I don&#x27;t love - I don&#x27;t love that you can&#x27;t use it while it charges. I also don&#x27;t love that it’s a little loud. But I get over those pretty quick because when I am through shaving I look like a million bucks.</li>
    <li> Happy with the purchase.</li>
    <li> Completely satisfied - relatively expensive but it appears, in this case at least, you get what you pay for. Very smooth shave - a pleasure to use.</li>
    <li> I was given this as a present to replace my 11 year old Panasonic! That&#x27;s  why I got this model again. Great shave and battery lasts a long time. Love the &amp;#34;percentage of charge left&amp;#34; meter on this model!! No surprises.</li>
    <li> More work to get a close shave than I expected but easy to use and durable</li>
    <li> The Arc 4 is a linear shave, with four blades and cycle rate of 14000 times per minute, and the difference compared with cheaper razors is noticeable.  There&#x27;s virtually no hair, even with several days of stubble.  The Arc 4 does require more passes as stubble increases, but for daily use, it&#x27;s performance is fantastic.  In addition, the Arc 4 can be used wet or dry, with or without shaving cream.  The shave is close and quick, including around my neck and jawline.  An hour of charge provides a slightly shorter length of run time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In comparison to [[ASIN:B001DKMY9Q Panasonic ES8243A Men&#x27;s Arc 4 Rechargeable Electric Shaver]], this model has a slightly faster cycle rate and loses the somewhat gimmicky LCD screen with a simple charge indicator.  I mean, it&#x27;s a razor, right?  There is no need for any fancy gadgetry on it; a simple charge indicator will suffice.  Is the marginal increase in cycle rate and a year&#x27;s worth of improvements worth the extra expense?  I feel so.</li>
    <li> This is the third electric razor I have owned and is by far the best ever.  My previous shavers were Braun but the reviews of this item won me over to Panasonic.  This item has proven to be everything it was promised after two months of daily use.  It really does shave as close as a blade.</li>
    <li> Love it, cuts great!!</li>
    <li> This thing is a dream come true.  It has a card in the box telling you to give it time while your skin gets used to it, but I loved it from day one.  It works well wet or dry, very easy to clean, incredibly gentle, and surprisingly close shave.  It works best for shorter stubbles, but you can probably go 5-7 days between shaves and it will still work well, and won&#x27;t irritate your skin if you have to go over some areas a few times.  Say goodbye to razor burns, rash, cuts, and wasteful razors.</li>
    <li> A very close comfortable shave.  Best I have owned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Eleven ten nine eight seven six five four three two one</li>
    <li> My husband said it&#x27;s the best shaver he&#x27;s ever had. GREAT!</li>
    <li> Shaver was quiet and gave a good shave when used with shaving soap but I wasn&#x27;t happy with a dry shave. After 20 days of using it with soap I was not able to get all of the stubble on my neck so I returned it. Haven&#x27;t rec&#x27;d refund yet, so I don&#x27;t know if they honor the 30 day trial.</li>
    <li> Gets the job done. It&#x27;s a bit loud but no big deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Battery lasts me easily a week and a half.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I get the best shave with a SMALL amount of shaving cream immediately after shower. Don&#x27;t overdo the shaving cream. Wastes it, and doesn&#x27;t help the shaver, if you goop it on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shaving is quicker than most other razors but not quite as quick as it was with my old Norelco that I had 15 years ago. But this Panasonic gives me a much cleaner shave.</li>
    <li> I have rough hair and this one seems like a trimmer vs a shaver.  I&#x27;m used to using the Braun 7.o series which just died after 6 years of service.  I&#x27;m considering buying another Braun 7 series and retuning this one back</li>
    <li> Picks up with more blades, and more coverage, where the utterly brilliant ES 8228 left off (which I loved for all the 7years it lasted me until the charging prongs started to corrode - which is weird). Need to aware of that with this one.....this unit is made in Japan (as was the ES 8228, and that is IMPORTANT). I had a spare lower end, lower speed Panasonic Linear unit (made in China); and that is worthless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ES 8228 was a wee bit aggressive on the face despite that it had less blades. Perhaps this one with it better design and hypo - allergenic is too much of a good thing (this is nit picking really). In efficacy terms, this thing is ALL one could ask for, The shave takes the same time, and you need to be thorough as it will leave microscopic hairs which are not an issue but you CAN feel them. It wont be an issue to most, it isn&#x27;t for me. Here, its important to note that this unit is not a big jump in performance over the ES 8228 (which I did expect it to be). The only difference seems to be that, its even more benign to the skin than the previous generation 14,000RPM linear motors  (foils and blades on the ES 8228 lasted about 1.5yrs on average).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some people may ask why chose this at all if not for performance. Especially considering that the replacements foils for this maybe a little bit more expensive than ES 8228 twin blade types. And the answer may only be that these shavers have gotten a lot cheaper than the top of the line linear models from 10years ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The charge holds a week with a 8-10 minute shave each day, and I love that like the ES 8228 it does not burn one&#x27;s skin, which leaves your skin looking better and better the more you use it. One can damage the foil or blade by putting it face down hard or on jagged surfaces, so a little care will go a long way&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, it could be better in performance, but the baseline established by good 14,000rpm linear models is already very high and none other manufacturer comes even close. Thumbs up.</li>
    <li> this was a gift for my husband who has very sensitive skin. He really like the multiple blades on the head and the close shave he gets. He uses it dry and sometime in the shower.</li>
    <li> I think that this is the third or fourth Panasonic shaver that I have owned. I like the fact that this razor can be used with soap and water to get a fantastic close shave. Also the shaver can be rinsed out under the tap. I feel that this razor gives me the best shave.</li>
    <li> Quiet. Close shave. Great handle grip. Cleans easily and fast. Average battery charge life.</li>
    <li> Good product. Rushed, quality without claims. Very pleased with the purchase. I think that I will be ordering more. So see you :)</li>
    <li> Fantastic shaver. Almost every shaver I&#x27;ve tried iratated my skin, not this one.</li>
    <li> I was very well surprised how close this ES-LF51-A razor shaved.  There very well may be others just as good, but I am sticking to this one.  I got a good deal on it too.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried electric razors in the past, and I could never get a close shave like with a hand razor (blade). Unfortunately, I&#x27;m on blood thinners now for a heart condition so I can&#x27;t use a hand razor for fear of nicking my face and having to deal with a slow clotting cut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this razor for the last two weeks and it seems to work pretty well. It won&#x27;t give me as close of a shave as a hand razor, but it&#x27;s pretty darn close. I&#x27;ve used it in the shower once and it worked fine, but I&#x27;m now shaving in front of a sink with some shaving gel and it works great. Seems to have a long battery life, so I don&#x27;t need to charge it very much. Well constructed and feels good in the hand. I&#x27;ve had no issues getting to tight locations (e.g., under the nose). I highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> A good product.&lt;br /&gt;Recommended.</li>
    <li> good quality, rapid delivery and cheap</li>
    <li> WOW. Best electric shave I&#x27;ve ever had.</li>
    <li> Very pleased with overall performance</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this razor for about two months now. Honestly I like everything about this razor but the shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s easy to clean. It holds a charge well and charges fast. It&#x27;s comfortable to hold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But for me there are a considerable number of hairs it just refuses to cut. Maybe I&#x27;m expecting too much, but sadly my 25 year old Norelco did a better job.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this for over 8 months now. It&#x27;s lightweight and smooth on my face. Cuts close. I still have a challenge under my chin and have to go over it several times, but I think that&#x27;s fairly normal. I like the lock to keep it from coming on in my suitcase. It&#x27;s much quieter than my last razor, which is nice. It feels like if I dropped it on the floor it would shatter, but I&#x27;m not planning to test that.</li>
    <li> This is the closest shave I&#x27;ve ever gotten form an electric shaver, even from day 1, with no skin irritation at all. After using this unit for several weeks, I&#x27;ve found my facial hair and skin have &amp;#34;adjusted&amp;#34; to it and the shaving time has been cut way down to around 3 minutes. I would recommend this shaving system to anyone.</li>
    <li> My husband desperately needed a new razor and chose this one.  His face is much smoother and it works very well.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s really good for shaving. Especially moving head makes cutting better.</li>
    <li> I bought one of these razors for myself but it kept &amp;#34;disappearing&amp;#34; only to be found in my son&#x27;s bathroom.  Well, now he has his own - a great birthday present - now I can find mine!  Would recommend!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve needed a new electric razor for months since my old Norelco Arcitec started dying on me.  A few reviews of this one got me interested and one day Amazon had a special on this that fortunately put me in the right place at the right time so I bought it.  I will say right up front that I am not a believer anytime a manufacturer starts advertising an electric as being &amp;#34;close as a blade&amp;#34;.  It sounds nice, but for me that has never been the case.  I like the convenience and ease of the electric on days when I don&#x27;t feel like shaving properly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After having this for close to 60 days, this is clearly the best electric I&#x27;ve owned.  Does it shave as close as a blade?  No it doesn&#x27;t.  There are still some areas in my neck area that no matter how hard I try this device does not get to.  But overall it does a good job.  I&#x27;ve used it as a wet shaver a few times and while it works I didn&#x27;t buy it for that purpose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like that you get a lot of shaves on a single charge (and it only takes an hour to recharge).  It cleans easily and I didn&#x27;t have to buy any solutions or extra products like I did with my Norelco.  I&#x27;m not sure what this retails for but I probably paid about $125 and I think it was worth it.  I don&#x27;t think I would recommend paying full price for it though</li>
    <li> This is a very good shaver.  I was using a Braun Series 7 and it started doing a  horrible job a couple of months ago.  Replacing the blades was no help.  This shaver cost less than that one and it is the best I have every used.</li>
    <li> for the price it&#x27;s very competitive to the 300 dollar braun shavers. Ive had the highest end braun shaver and they both have ups and downs. Between the two it&#x27;s a toss up. A lot of it has to do with the user. I would recommend buying the Panasonic over the braun price wise hands down. Drop test...I broke my old 300 dollar braun from dropping it from about 4.5 feet on accident of course. The thing is totalled. I dropped the Panasonic from the same height and it&#x27;s still fine. It chipped it a tiny bit but nothing major. But its not bomb proof. Blades haven&#x27;t dulled yet. Had for like 8 months.</li>
    <li> This is by far the best shaver I&#x27;ve ever bought.  The closest shave you can get with out cutting your skin.  It charges easily plug in the chord for one hour and it lasts a week.  The other awesome thing is cleaning it, just put some soap on the top turn it on and rinse.  I bought this at best-buy with a price match.  Also has a travel kit for overseas.  I also have never been cut with it ever for how close it shaves.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had numerous electric shavers and this one definately cuts very nice.  However, I&#x27;ve only had it for 7 months and I have to return it to Panasonic for warranty repairs which is a first unfortunately.  Other comments stated short battery life and they were correct.  When new you get about 4-5 shaves before a recharge is necessary.  That greatly diminished to the point of about 2-3.  Now the battery indicator % stays on constantly further draining the battery so i barely get 2 shaves with a full charge.  Other than this the shave is nice.</li>
    <li> seems to be impossible to get close shaves on my neck region under my jawline and chin. No matter how many times I run it over and in different positions, the foils wont get close enough and leaves some stubble that ends up requiring a hand razor to finish the job...disapointed</li>
    <li> it only take 5 days to get it , and it work so good  when take off out the box</li>
    <li> Fast, comfortable, close, really smooth shave.  HIGHLY recommended.  That&#x27;s it - if like me you&#x27;ve tried many shavers through the years then this is a revelation.</li>
    <li> Have used it for a couple of years now. Bought a second for my second home.</li>
    <li> Gave this to my dad a a gift and he loves it!  It give a really close shave without leaving behind any stubble or rash.</li>
    <li> It does a decent job, but does not give the baby smooth shave I was hoping for.  I have given it a month to allow my beard to adjust.  Oh well, I will give it another month.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband because he has to shave every day before work. I was honestly tired of buying razors every week to satisfy his need to have a &#x27;clean, fresh shave.&#x27;  Well I bought this in hope that it would work for him, except he hated it.  He used it for all of five days and will never willingly pick it up again.  He broke out like he was a teenager again, and frankly i&#x27;m not going to force him to keep using it even though it says to &#x27;give it a month for skin to adjust.&#x27;</li>
    <li> Switched to this from a rotary electric shaver. This provides a closer shave, and I won&#x27;t be switching back. It seems a little challenged getting the neck area as smooth as my jawline. Also getting close in the mustache area is a little tricky. Overall, I&#x27;m satisfied.</li>
    <li> I saved much time in morning by using it i like it</li>
