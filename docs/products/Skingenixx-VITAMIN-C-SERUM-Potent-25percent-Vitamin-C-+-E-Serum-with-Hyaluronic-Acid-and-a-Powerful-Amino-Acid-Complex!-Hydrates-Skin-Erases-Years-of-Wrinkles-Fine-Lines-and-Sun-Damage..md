<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I love the texture, non greasy even in summer. I use other products by Skingenixx too, but this is one of my very favorite.</li>
    <li> This non greasy product feels good on my face. I must say I&#x27;ve seen results in just 2 weeks of use. It put the glow and firmness back into my skin.</li>
    <li> I am a women of color and had several dark spots from former acne. This product is magic- it completely faded my spots &amp; will prevent them from coming back. Be sure to use, it twice a day but within a month your spots will be gone.</li>
    <li> I love this anti-aging serum and highly recommend anyone who is looking for a change in vit C creams to try this! I have been very pleased with all Skingenixx skin care products and I recommend them highly, as my skin feels incredible after application.</li>
    <li> I am very pale(irish). I always use sunscreen but somehow about 2 years ago developed a red freckle on my nose. My dermatologist said it was sun damage and froze it off but the area was still very red after the fact. hydroquinone does nothing and never has for me. So i tried this out. I just started using this last week.wow.. it is almost gone... Thank you Skingenixx.</li>
    <li> Very refreshing and light. Better than many that are much more expensive. Great value. Hyaluronic Acid is one of the view ingredients in facial treatments that are scientifically proven to actually help keep skin younger looking (according to my dermatologist). No need for other skin products when you have this one. Great buy and would recommend it to others.</li>
    <li> I am not sure about Skingenixx the company.  Their email info@skingenixx does not work so is not valid. The phone number to call is not even valid with answering message about diet plan.  (nothing to do with skin care products). I read most of the reviews by they are by people who got the product for FREE and does reviews for a living reviewing all kinds of FREE products.  (female reviewers for male hormone supplements saying is great for the same seller, etc ???)  I did order one bottle for 5 dollars to try out.  I will write a true review on it once I have tried it.  I won&#x27;t order more until I see what the product looks like first and actually have tried it.  Does not even say if the product is made in USA or China?  I don&#x27;t trust products from China. Sorry but just be cautions and honest here.</li>
    <li> I live in Alaska in very harsh conditions, which can cause skin damage. I am in my late forties and have struggled to hydrate my skin in the past few years, but since finding Skingenixx VITAMIN C SERUM and using it for the last 3 months, the difference is amazing. I no longer have flaky dry skin, but smooth, plumped skin, that looks and feels amazing. I use this product in conjunction with the day cream, night cream,  cleanser and toner. All fabulous products, that do make a difference IF used correctly, I saw a significant difference in my sun damaged skin after a month, try it, you&#x27;ll love it :)</li>
    <li> My mom recommended this product to me after she saw her wrinkles taken out and fine lines smoothened. We have the same kind of skin and I am happy to report that it has reduced my pores and my skin is very smooth. I love the price despite it having HA. Thanks Skingenixx!</li>
    <li> Color me very underwhelmed.  I LIKE the sting of vitamin C serums,  so since this does not have that,  I suspect that either it is not the right pH,  or it is hindered by the other ingredients.  Thus &amp;#34;potent&amp;#34;  is actually a very misleading term.  I will be returning most likely since I think this is no different than slathering a dollar cream from Walmart -- like cocoa butter or the like -- on my face and neck.  I really would not advise someone to look at this as helpful since for vitamin c to work it must first sting a bit,  like an acid,  indicating the pH is the right pH,  and also,  hyaluronic acid will just SIT on top of your skin.  Are people aware of this fact?  This is a LARGE molecule  (hyaluronic acid that is)  that merely sits on top of skin,  does not penetrate,  thus utterly useless imo.  Yes moisturizing,  but again,  for moisture,  the best ones are like a dollar.  So this is useless to me.</li>
    <li> I feel that the product works every time I look at myself in the mirror but the best part is when I get together with my friends and they always compliment me on my skins great look!</li>
    <li> Thank you Skingenixx, it will be great if you can add more products with hyaluronic acid to your line. Keep it up.</li>
    <li> It absorbs nicely, its not greasy.</li>
    <li> I have been using other products for months and I saw absolutely no results. then a month later I use this and after 4-6 uses I could see the acne scars and dark spots fading! I&#x27;m very happy with this product and would highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Ok, I started with this 1year ago. Then being seduced away by claims of other brand I left my serum. I tried Peter Thomas Roth, Algenist, dr. Densest, dr. Pericone, etc. spent lots of money.....and guess what, I&#x27; m back. Nothing worked as well as this serum.</li>
    <li> Totally love. I&#x27;ve reached the age of needing stuff like this and it really works!rrc</li>
    <li> This serum has helped reverse years of skin damage from me living and sunbathing at the beach.&lt;br /&gt;I never thought I would find a product that helped and I have tried many.&lt;br /&gt;I was given a chance to get a discount for my honest unbiased opinion not influenced in any way.&lt;br /&gt;I give this serum a 5 star rating.</li>
    <li> About me: Just turned 25, decided it was time to use a serum. I basically have good skin, with a few relatively minor issues: I&#x27;m somewhat prone to clogged pores, I have faint discoloration on my cheeks from before I got my acne in check. I don&#x27;t have smile lines, but I do want to minimize the lines that sometimes form when I smile.This works. I have been using it for a month. It&#x27;s the only change I made to my regimen, and my facial skin is softer, tighter, and the lines that form when I smile are much diminished! There&#x27;s a glow there that I didn&#x27;t have before. I like it. I&#x27;m going to stick with this. It doesn&#x27;t irritate my clogged pores, if anything, that&#x27;s gotten better over the past few weeks.</li>
    <li> I mix a few drops of this with my moisturizer and I am happy to report that my skin looks and feels younger. After nearly two months of use, my wrinkles have decreased significantly so will continue to use. Thanks!</li>
    <li> This is an amazing product, great for your skin, doesn&#x27;t leave it oily and is not only great for wrinkles but as a sun screen too! Love it! Your skin will thank you...</li>
    <li> It is absorbed into face nicely and quickly. Do not notice any difference yet after 2 weeks use.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for 4 days now and my 11 lines have vanished. Goes on smooth and soaks in fast. I am looking forward to seeing the results after I use the whole bottle. I will buy again.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product to diminish sunspots on my forehead and cheekbones after a trip to Aruba. After a week, the spotting started fading and eventually went away after approximately six weeks. You must regularly apply it day and night and give it time, but it does work. I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I not only recommend it but purchase it for family. One pump of serum ( a tiny amount) covers both eyes, plus other wrinkles and my lips. It is absorbed quickly and I see improvement immediately. It does NOT contain Parabens.</li>
    <li> Awesome skin product!</li>
    <li> I was skeptical about this serum, because I have terrible allergies to chemical and synthetic fragrances and sadly even some natural scents bother me if they&#x27;re too overpowering. I ordered this serum regardless because the label doesn&#x27;t list synthetic/chemical scents and the ingredients are exactly what I was looking for - clean, natural, good for you, seemingly potent skincare. Let me tell you how this serum is a dream! The scent for me is very faint and once I&#x27;ve smoothed the product into my skin, the fragrance dissipates entirely - I&#x27;ve had absolutely no issues with it :) And the product itself is a soothing wonder - has reduced my wrinkles and fully hydrates my skin.</li>
    <li> have been using this product for about 3 weeks. It feels wonderful going on. It absorbs quickly and doesn&#x27;t feel greasy. My skin is much softer , hydrated and the fine wrinkles seem to be less. I hope they never stop making this product because it is now my go to product!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a month now and I think my skin looks great. It&#x27;s smooth and soft. The serum is not sticky, it goes on smooth and dries well. I love that it has a good amount of hyaluronic acid and Vitamin C which are good for reversing age on the skn Love this stuff!</li>
    <li> Very helpful and responsive! Plan on returning soon!</li>
    <li> Recently I attended a friend&#x27;s 70th birthday party. Later her daughter told me that all the ladies were talking about how great I looked, especially my hair  and my skin.</li>
    <li> I love this vitamin c serum its really worked in a short period of time. it has my made my skin feel tighter and firm!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 33 and my skin looks amazing, it&#x27;s smooth and clear.</li>
    <li> Being skeptical of all skin care promises i have to say this one seems to deliver. So far it is helping with my 60+ skins issues. My face has had a dry patch of unhealable flaking skin that this product in just a few days has shrunk and healing. Its been there for years. Plus an upper lip discoloration is fading and healing. Dont ask me how it does it but it is a big help. I am impressed.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m in my mid-twenties and have naturally combo/oily sensitive skin, and have recently come down with adult acne.  I decided to try this again and it&#x27;s saved my skin. My skin is now clear from my medication, but it&#x27;s moisturized, elastic, and my pores are shrinking.</li>
    <li> This product has higher % of HA than others. It works for me. Noticeable slight more tightening of the skin &amp; healthy skin look. It has increased moisture in my skin and my  age spots are disappearing. I will order another bottle. I tried another (weaker) brand but am going back to this one. It&#x27;s the least expensive for HA.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this serum for less than one week and I am already seeing huge benefits. For years I&#x27;ve had large pores on my nose and in the last few years, on the skin of my face. This wonderful serum has shrunk them down. I am so glad I decided to try this product.Thank you Skingenixx.</li>
    <li> Take a look at all the reviews. They are fake. I looked at the past history of at least 15 reviews and they all have given 5 stars on every single review and most of them reviewed the same exact products. I hate it when companies do this.</li>
    <li> I use this on my face and throat and my skin feels and looks great all day. I&#x27;m 61 and my skin is sometimes sensitive. This always feels soothing.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;e been using this for a couple of months,it is phenomenal! All those little wrinkles around the mouth and lips love this stuff. Makes me look years younger and Im not kidding you at all...no one can believe I&#x27;m  going to be on Medicare in less then a year. I owe it all to Skingenixx&#x27;s products...but this is my all time favorite product. Don&#x27;t hesitate if you are over 55...that&#x27;s when you can really tell how good the product is. :)</li>
    <li> Significantly less lines and skin feels softer. The best so far.</li>
    <li> I saw this product on Dr. Oz and had to try it. I am so happy with the results. My skin looks and feels better. Hyaluronic acid is said to minimize wrinkles. Yes, I have had compliments on my skin and it does look younger. I give this a 5 rating because it does work!</li>
    <li> This serum is full of hyaluronic acid and vitamin c which  leaves my face looking and feeling youthful. It goes on silky and dries instantly without leaving any oily residue. I&#x27;ve noticed how well it reduces fine lines and improves the texture of my face. I am hooked on it and hope they make this forever!</li>
    <li> Add me to the list of people who love this product. I am in my late 40s, and still have to use proactive (not the cleanser, but steps 2 &amp; 3). My skin breaks out so fast with so many products. I waited a long time before deciding to try this because I was afraid, but it does NOT break me out--in fact it makes my skin better. I have to say though that I don&#x27;t use one or two drops, I slather this stuff on. My pores seem smaller, and my skin loves the moisture. I had to go and buy the super-size bottle. I highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I am so glad I ordered this serum. This is my first skin care product from Skingenixx , and I intend to order more. I use the serum in the morning, before my moisturizer , and it makes my skin feel so smooth.</li>
    <li> I use this product every morning under my makeup, of which I wear very little, and it absorbs quickly and leaves my skin feeling very smooth. I love this product.</li>
    <li> This product is worth every penny &amp; is definitely a keeper.</li>
    <li> Not sure why this brand is targeted to women. I am a man and love using Skingenixx&#x27;s products. I use this serum and my face has never looked better. Thank you !</li>
    <li> I love all Skingenixx products because they work and are all natural. I have stopped buying high end Department Store brands, as they cannot hold a candle to Skingenixx&#x27;s product line. I am 46 with wrinkles, large pores and uneven skin. I have found this serum works great on my skin to look it&#x27;s best without any chemicals. I love the ingredients in this product and the price is great too!</li>
    <li> Vitamin C is the newest treatment for aging skin. It is popular because it works, you will see results and you will love them! Using this in combination with other Skingenixx products I have seen so much better results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product at a discount in exchange for an honest and unbiased review. The discount in no way influenced my review, the words and opinions are my own.</li>
    <li> My skin is looking much better and it&#x27;s a great base for my double wear foundation.</li>
    <li> What I like most about this product is that the texture is light and applies nicely to my skin. Kudos Skingenixx.</li>
    <li> My skin is much more vibrant since I began using this product.</li>
    <li> This is a great, gentle, non-greasy formula that absorbs instantly. I use a drop on my forehead, chin and each cheek and rub it in that way. It lasts months as long as my boyfriend doesn&#x27;t get into it.</li>
    <li> I am a mature woman who has very dry skin. This serum is fantastic, it keeps my skin soft and supple.</li>
    <li> Been using twice daily for 3 weeks now and I&#x27;m definitely seeing some whitening on my spots. Good stuff.</li>
    <li> I love this skin cream</li>
    <li> This is the perfect anti-aging product for women everywhere! It contains an amazing Amino Acid Complex that greatly magnifies the Anti-Aging effects by completely reducing free radicals in the skin. The vitamin C serum significantly inhibits UVA light induced oxidation, moisturizes and hydrates the skin, stimulates collagen synthesis, and can even help lighten age spots! I have noticed a big improvement in my facial appearance and am completely thrilled with the results!</li>
    <li> This product helps keep facial skin moisturized and happy. Glides on and instantly the skin feels better.Use right after cleansing skin, it absorbs quickly, then use a moisturizer with sun protection for day time use. Use at night along with Skingenixx  facial cream. You and your face will like the results.</li>
    <li> I wanted to wait awhile before I wrote a review to make sure that I had given this product a fair chance. I&#x27;m a 49 year old African American woman with sensitive, oily, acne prone skin. I don&#x27;t have any wrinkles, just the folds that develop from your nose to your mouth. My skin had begun to look dull and lifeless but most products for aging skin don&#x27;t take into account the other issues that you might have. Now I look in the mirror every morning and think, WOW, my skin looks beautiful! Unfortunately, sometimes 30 days isn&#x27;t enough time to really determine the lasting impact of a product on your skin.  I say give it a try, what do you have to lose other than beautiful skin.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite serum. I feel naked and unprotected without it. I use this twice a day and panic when the regular bottle gets to the halfway mark.</li>
    <li> Amazon,com approached me with certain skin care products I might like. Everyone knows that there are a million products available. I almost went with &amp;#34;the best&amp;#34; until I noticed a somewhat new product. It has the highest % now legal for Vit. C and Hyaluronic Acid and Amino Acid Complex. THEN I noticed it is being provided by the WOUNDED WARRIORS. Wounded Warrios (seen on TV) is an Organization that assists our Injured Soldiers that come back from the wars injured. That fact put my decision in their hands! The product arrived exactly on time. NOW here&#x27;s the BEST PART: I have used it twice a day for 10 days and there is a Noticeable smoothing of lines and wrinkles; also my skin is creamier looking. I am a relatively young lookinv woman. But I am 56!! If I can get help at 56, you younger Women and Men will be even luckier! 5 STARS!!!</li>
    <li> Been using a a long time. Use it every day. I like to exfoliate my skin at night. In the morning I use this. It always feel so good and it does firm my skin. My skin instantly pulls it in and tightens my pores. It is simply amazing!! Thanks Skingenixx!</li>
    <li> I purchased Skingenixx Vitamin C by Skingenixx several months ago and am very pleased. My skin is looking and feeling better. I will be buying this product again.</li>
    <li> It has effectively lightened my dark spots.</li>
    <li> I use this once a day everyday and my acne scars have diminished a lot. I will Definitely be going to buy another to see if it makes the marks even lighter.</li>
    <li> I will never have anything other than this, my skin looks years younger and feels less and less like leather everyday!</li>
    <li> I practically live under the AC so this product really gives my skin the smoothness and shine it so desperately needs. I never run out of a bottle.</li>
    <li> This Vitamin C Serum has transformed my skin .Enjoy your results and share the wonders of Skingenixx&#x27;s products with everyone! No, I don&#x27;t work for the company, I am an educator!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for a month now and bought it because of other online reviewers that said they had seen positive results. It works and my skin has never looked better. It really hydrates the skin and plumps out the wrinkles, fine lines and laugh lines. I would recommend it to others</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m sold on Skingenixx skin care. I believe it has helped me maintain younger looking skin.</li>
    <li> I am a huge fan of Skingenixx products. I use both Skingenixx Vitamin C and eye serum. This is lighter than the resilience lift and smells good. My skin type is normal/ combination.</li>
    <li> I bought this to use as a mist on top of my make up, primarily during trans atlantic flights. I always feel awful after long flights and thought of trying this after watching expert flyer tips. I am MORE than happy. Love it, and it doesn&#x27;t destroy my make up but leaves the skin with a dewy finish. And feeling so wonderfully quenched! I&#x27;m addicted to that fresh rush now. It will be my number one travel companion from now on!</li>
    <li> I am an Esthetician and have been using Hyaluronic Acid for many years. Over the years I&#x27;ve purchased many expensive brands and sure I&#x27;ve been satisfied, but not with the price! I finally decided to look for one that wasn&#x27;t obscenely priced and still did the job without being sticky, an issue I&#x27;ve found with less expensive hyaluronic acids. This brand is not sticky and it included vitamin C! It&#x27;s two products for the price of one and it works very well! I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> This product works beautifully and when you use this before you moisturize? omg...it feels like you can instantly feel the improvement of your skin.love love love</li>
    <li> I was a little skeptical about purchasing this product. A week after I started using it I noticed a difference, some light wrinkles that were starting to form looked like they had started fading.</li>
    <li> This product was more than I expected! I got it for a couple of spots on my forehead. I saw so many little marks disappear that I didn&#x27;t even realize I had. I feel like my skin looks so much younger. It is a miracle.</li>
