      <li>about bought 2, greatest decision ever!!</li>
      <li>This product is a great shampoo AND conditioner</li>
      <li>the one I&#x27;ve liked the best is Dove&#x27;s) to keep my hair from looking oily between washes.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t work that great for my type of hair.</li>
      <li>The product smells great.</li>
      <li>This brand leaves no visible dust or residue and smells amazing!  </li>
      <li>After I spray it in my hair and I rub it in really good, it gives my hair a greasy look.</li>
      <li>Smells really good and very light.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t help the look of the hair, but it does smell good:)</li>
      <li>, I like this product the best so far.</li>
      <li>but the cheaper brand that I buy is much more effective.</li>
      <li>If all you&#x27;re interested in is perfume for your hair, this is a great option.</li>
      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>it was okay</li>
      <li>The product is ok.  </li>
      <li>The product is just okay to me.</li>
      <li>so I thought I&#x27;d love this product as well</li>
      <li>Just not one of their better products.</li>
      <li>This is the best dry shampoo I have found to date.  </li>
      <li>Not the best out of the dry shampoo and conditioner in ONE.</li>
      <li>Love it.&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t have a strong smell and it works</li>
      <li>the best dry shampoo !!  </li>
      <li>I am a huge fan of</li>
      <li>These 2 steps are important.  </li>
      <li>I have tried the cheap Tresemme brand, and have purchased the Rockstar brand from the salon for around $20.  </li>
      <li>Although the fragrance smells really good, when I go to spray this in my hair at bed time, it sprays kind of wet on my scalp.</li>
      <li>This product did make my hair look or feel clean.</li>
      <li>The smell is nice and light, which seems to always be an issue with dry shampoo products.</li>
      <li>It smells great and definitely removes any odor the hair might have absorbed, but what most people want a dry shampoo for is to get rid of greasy hair and this sucked at that.</li>
      <li>smells great, leaves my hair slightly limp</li>
      <li>I found myself using more and more trying to make it work with little effect.</li>
      <li>As someone who is learning that sometimes it&#x27;s okay to pay a little more</li>
      <li>I wish I returned it after the first test didn&#x27;t work because now too much time has passed to get a full refund.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll stick with Big Sexy Hair instead.  </li>
      <li>Just be aware that it may not work for everyone.</li>
      <li>I would have been better off not using a dry shampoo and just leaving my hair as is rather than using this.</li>
      <li>Smells amazing and kinda makes my hair feel a little softer.</li>
      <li>With the Tresemme, you get what you pay for and it doesn&#x27;t do much to help your hair.  </li>
      <li>This doesn&#x27;t absorb the oil very well.</li>
      <li>I use this after hot yoga and if you have done hot yoga you know how sweaty and gross your hair when you finish.</li>
      <li>I had high hopes for this one, but it seemed to do nothing to freshen up my hair.</li>
      <li>I was really excited when I saw It&#x27;s a 10 had a dry shampoo.</li>
      <li>It leaves my hair clean, soft and fresh smelling as if I had just washed and air dried it.</li>
      <li>I liked the Rockstar dry shampoo, but like the Tresemme it leaves a white dust/residue on your hair even after brushing it out, which worked fine when I had blonde hair, but it doesn&#x27;t work so well on dark hair.  </li>
      <li>it was better than nothing at all, but in no way does it compare to the hair play product that I usually use.</li>
      <li>Usually I have better results with</li>
      <li>I was especially excited that it was both a shampoo and conditioner, and as someone who tries to wash my hair every other day, I always use dry shampoo.</li>
      <li>Which is disappointing because It&#x27;s a 10 products are typically great products.</li>
      <li>The dry shampoos I have used previously have more of a powdery feel, but this felt and looked greasier than the hair I was putting it on.</li>
      <li>It also works really well, especially for the second day</li>
      <li>Does not leave a white residue behind and has a nice smell.</li>
      <li>I purchased the regular shampoo and conditioner, and decided to purchase this dry shampoo to &amp;#34;match&amp;#34; the whole product line.</li>
      <li>With this dry shampoo I can usually skip a day between washing my hair, and it keeps it feeling clean and not oily.</li>

<li> There is none of that crusty white reside or sticky film that other dry shampoos leave behind :)</li>

<li> Well I have tried a lot of dry shampoo&#x27;s, they are supposed to add volume and make your hair last longer between shampoos.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> It doesn&#x27;t help the look of the hair, but it does smell good:)</li>
    <li> If all you&#x27;re interested in is perfume for your hair, this is a great option. If you actually want to fix an oily appearance, no-go. It smells great and definitely removes any odor the hair might have absorbed, but what most people want a dry shampoo for is to get rid of greasy hair and this sucked at that. I tried using it before bed to stave off overnight grease; didn&#x27;t work. I tried using it on already greasy hair in the morning; also didn&#x27;t work. I wish I returned it after the first test didn&#x27;t work because now too much time has passed to get a full refund. No miracles with this one...</li>
    <li> The product is just okay to me. Which is disappointing because It&#x27;s a 10 products are typically great products. Although the fragrance smells really good, when I go to spray this in my hair at bed time, it sprays kind of wet on my scalp. It doesn&#x27;t spray a powder residue as you would expect with dry shampoo. After I spray it in my hair and I rub it in really good, it gives my hair a greasy look. Not a big fan of this product.</li>
    <li> As someone who is learning that sometimes it&#x27;s okay to pay a little more if you want quality results, I was actually disappointed in this product. I was especially excited that it was both a shampoo and conditioner, and as someone who tries to wash my hair every other day, I always use dry shampoo. I purchased the regular shampoo and conditioner, and decided to purchase this dry shampoo to &amp;#34;match&amp;#34; the whole product line. I won&#x27;t be purchasing this again. It was almost &amp;#34;wet,&amp;#34; if that makes any sense. The dry shampoos I have used previously have more of a powdery feel, but this felt and looked greasier than the hair I was putting it on. It also weighed down my roots. It may work for some, but it didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
    <li> Took my fianc&amp;eacute; an hour to wash her hair after using this.</li>
    <li> Well I have tried a lot of dry shampoo&#x27;s, they are supposed to add volume and make your hair last longer between shampoos.  I have tried a lot of products, and seemed to have landed on this one, I like this product the best so far.</li>
    <li> Love it.&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t have a strong smell and it works</li>
    <li> The product smells great. It doesn&#x27;t work that great for my type of hair. Usually I have better results with It&#x27;s a 10 products. I would still recommend it.</li>
    <li> smells great, leaves my hair slightly limp</li>
    <li> I am a huge fan of It&#x27;s a 10 products but this is by far the least that I like.  I tried it and feel as though it doesn&#x27;t absorb anything.  Just not one of their better products.</li>
    <li> I was really excited when I saw It&#x27;s a 10 had a dry shampoo. The smell is nice and light, which seems to always be an issue with dry shampoo products. Unfortunately it doesn&#x27;t seem to do a whole lot. My hair looks maybe a tiny bit fresher than before I used the dry shampoo, but not enough to matter.</li>
    <li> This product did make my hair look or feel clean. However, it did smell wonderful but that is about it.</li>
    <li> This doesn&#x27;t absorb the oil very well. I found myself using more and more trying to make it work with little effect. Also it doesn&#x27;t give any added volume or texture (which can be good or bad, depending on if you like that feature of dry shampoos). I loooove their leave in conditioner so I thought I&#x27;d love this product as well but the cheaper brand that I buy is much more effective.</li>
    <li> This is the best dry shampoo I have found to date.  I have tried the cheap Tresemme brand, and have purchased the Rockstar brand from the salon for around $20.  With the Tresemme, you get what you pay for and it doesn&#x27;t do much to help your hair.  I liked the Rockstar dry shampoo, but like the Tresemme it leaves a white dust/residue on your hair even after brushing it out, which worked fine when I had blonde hair, but it doesn&#x27;t work so well on dark hair.  This brand leaves no visible dust or residue and smells amazing!  It also works really well, especially for the second day so you don&#x27;t have to shower.  My typical style after washing my hair with shampoo and conditioner is to put in leave in conditioner, blow dry, straighten, and put in It&#x27;s a 10 smoothing serum.  My hair usually feels dirty the next day and most times I will wash it every day. With this dry shampoo I can usually skip a day between washing my hair, and it keeps it feeling clean and not oily.</li>
    <li> Smells really good and very light. Still feel like my hair is greasy.</li>
    <li> I usually use KMS hair play dry shampoo, but decided to try this one. I don&#x27;t have the time to wash and style my hair everyday anymore, so I use a dry shampoo between washes. This one did not do much to fluff or refresh my hair...it was better than nothing at all, but in no way does it compare to the hair play product that I usually use. I was disappointed in this product.</li>
    <li> This product is awesome! I flip my hair upside down and spray evenly. Then run fingers through hair. These 2 steps are important.  My hair looks like I just washed it!</li>
    <li> Because I had used another product from this company, I was hopeful it would work well.  However, it did not do as well as other dry shampoos I have tried. My search continues!!</li>
    <li> The product is ok.  I have trouble with dry shampoos to begin with but this product isn&#x27;t better or worse than any I&#x27;ve tried.  Does not leave a white residue behind and has a nice smell.</li>
    <li> This product is a great shampoo AND conditioner but it is not a thickening/volumizing spray. I use this after hot yoga and if you have done hot yoga you know how sweaty and gross your hair when you finish. It leaves my hair clean, soft and fresh smelling as if I had just washed and air dried it. There is none of that crusty white reside or sticky film that other dry shampoos leave behind :)</li>
    <li> This is the first dry shampoo I&#x27;ve ever tried and I was so disappointed.  I couldn&#x27;t understand why people would use something so greasy to take care of the grease.  I almost gave up on my pursuit of not needing to wash my hair daily after this.  Don&#x27;t try it.  I would have been better off not using a dry shampoo and just leaving my hair as is rather than using this.</li>
    <li> I usually swear by It&#x27;s a 10 products, but the dry shampoo &amp; conditioner just didn&#x27;t work for me. I have used dry shampoos in the past (the one I&#x27;ve liked the best is Dove&#x27;s) to keep my hair from looking oily between washes. I had high hopes for this one, but it seemed to do nothing to freshen up my hair. It looked like I hadn&#x27;t used anything. This may be due to my hair type, though, so I don&#x27;t want to tell someone else not to try it. Just be aware that it may not work for everyone.</li>
    <li> Made my hair wet and didn&#x27;t make it any fresher. I gave it to a friend. Maybe she will like it.</li>
    <li> Makes hair greasy. Not the best out of the dry shampoo and conditioner in ONE.</li>
    <li> the best dry shampoo !!  no residue</li>
    <li> I like this brand of hair care so I trusted it was okay about bought 2, greatest decision ever!! I love it. Smells amazing and kinda makes my hair feel a little softer. No white residue and gives it slight volume</li>
    <li> Worst dry shampoo I&#x27;ve used.  I&#x27;ll stick with Big Sexy Hair instead.  highly disappointed, especially for the price.</li>
