<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I had to stop using sun block and sunscreen with high spf (50 plus) a few years ago, as I developed hives.  After that, I only wore sunscreens for sensitive skin.  For some reason, I am not having an allergic reaction to this particular product, even though it is not for sensitive skin.  I like it because it goes on dry, not greasy.  So as long as it keeps working for me and I don&#x27;t break out in hives, I will continue using.</li>
    <li> This is the best sunscreen lotion for me.  There is none better that I know about!  Nothing else compares.</li>
    <li> Hi there,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;today when I went to use the Neutrogena Clear Face Sunblock Lotion that I ordered back in February i realized it smelt funny and when i looked at the expiration date it had expired in 2007. This was very disturbing as now the window to return it is gone. Please take a look at your products and make sure they are not expired!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always hated sunscreen: the smell, the cakey feeling it leaves, etc. But then I started to care about wrinkles and scarring that the sun can exacerbate, so I knew I had to give in and start using sunscreen regularly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m so glad I found this sunscreen/sunblock because it is awesome! I use it multiple times a week, whenever I plan on spending time in the sun, and it doesn&#x27;t make me break out. It&#x27;s a super light, thin liquid and soaks in right away. I can apply it multiple times throughout the day if necessary and it never makes my face feel oily or cakey. The best part, though, is the smell (or lack thereof)! It is very subtle and doesn&#x27;t smell like normal sunscreen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Five stars for making me want to wear sunscreen and effectively protecting my skin!</li>
    <li> This lotion applies very white. I bought it for daily use but the color stays on top of my skin instead of blending in. It causes my makeup to look cakey and the wrong color. Now, I only use this before going out where there is a lot of sun. It is way too thick to wear for everyday use.</li>
    <li> I tried this after seeing tons of recommendations and positive reviews. It turns out that was a mistake. Only after I had problems did I find the other side of the story - people like me with severe eye and skin irritation who never reacted to other skincare products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My eyes and eyelids burned for several minutes every time I used this sunscreen. I should&#x27;ve stopped using it immediately, but stupidly, I didn&#x27;t, thinking I just needed to get used to it. Within a week I had red, scaly, flaking, raised patches on my eyelids. My entire face stung like it was chapped or had a chemical burn, and my skin began peeling off in dime-sized patches. I stopped using the sunscreen and my face cleared up and went back to normal within three days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have almost no contact allergies and had only reacted badly to one cosmetic product prior to this. My skin is the opposite of sensitive - it&#x27;s so unlikely that I&#x27;ll have a problem with anything that I don&#x27;t even patch test. I guess I learned my lesson. Now I have a huge bottle of liquid pain and wasted money sitting in my bathroom, and I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> This sunscreen did what it says it&#x27;ll do: it protected my face from the sun and didn&#x27;t break me out. That being said, I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s holy grail status. It&#x27;s easy to rub in (no white cast), feels very light on the skin, and dries to a surprisingly matte finish. It might be too matte for those with dry skin. It doesn&#x27;t have any added fragrance and a little goes a long way, meaning the bottle will likely last a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My issues with it is that some of the ingredients are a little suspect. Not crazy about the chemical suncreens (oxybenzone, homosalate, etc.) used, as well as a few ingredients that are possibly mildly comedogenic. It&#x27;s also packed full of silicones, about which there&#x27;s a lot of conflicting information when it comes to acne. I just use a good cleanser every night to make sure I&#x27;m not leaving any buildup on my skin that could be a problem down the road.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know why I thought this was a moisturizer too, it&#x27;s not.  It&#x27;s just straight sunblock.  That being said, it works well, not greasy, no acne outbreaks, and it&#x27;s easy to apply.  It&#x27;s just not what I needed.</li>
    <li> This works great for general use. No complaints. Long trip in a convertible, this is the sunscreen for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, it&#x27;s no substitute for a &amp;#34;Sport&amp;#34; sunscreen if you&#x27;re about to do something wet/sweaty. Learned that one the hard way. That&#x27;s my fault not the product&#x27;s though.</li>
    <li> I WOULD give it 5 stars, but the one thing that would make it perfect would be if it mattified. It doesn&#x27;t mattify. My face is oily and this doesn&#x27;t control it. But my face doesn&#x27;t breakout so that&#x27;s what I care about!</li>
    <li> with all of the wwarning about the sun-we must take care of our skin.&lt;br /&gt;This produce is not greasy and applies easily.&lt;br /&gt;No offensive odor.</li>
    <li> It makes me feel oily... but it works great. I used to have really bad cystic acne and I was paranoid of the UV rays causing them to leave darker marks (hyperpigmentation) so if I&#x27;m expecting to be outdoors for long periods of time, I use this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This does not work well under make up for me... make up easily melts off. I use both powder and liquid foundation, and sometimes BB cream.</li>
    <li> I have sensitive skin and when I use this sunblock my face feels like it&#x27;s on fire and becomes an angry red for 5 - 10 minutes after application. While it remains true to its word that it hasn&#x27;t caused any breakouts, I can&#x27;t use this product without physical pain. So I&#x27;ve abandoned this and am trying out other brands geared towards sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> I quit using this product after a few days because my face started to break out. Read about Neutrogena before purchasing.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t cause breakouts and I am 100% prone to breaking out esp with sunscreens. highly recommend this!</li>
    <li> Not Sun Block as immage shows. Received Sun Screen.</li>
    <li> Used daily on a 5 days beach vacation to Gulf Shores. Never got burned on my face at all and no break out</li>
    <li> This sun screen chemically burned my face very badly and caused it to blister for weeks. Never use this or any neutrogena product. They are the worst type of money grubbing company that pumps there products full of cheap sludge.</li>
    <li> This is the only sunscreen my husband can wear on his face because of his sensitive skin. It covers well, doesn&#x27;t burn, and isn&#x27;t greasy.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t have acne, am over 50, and think this sunscreen is Neutrogena&#x27;s best yet (and I&#x27;ve tried them all including the baby versions).  Within seconds of applying, you have a smooth, matte finish that&#x27;s either ready-to-go or ready for make-up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The texture of this sunscreen leans towards that of a liquid but it is not as runny as their Ultra Sheer Liquid Sunblock which I thought was very runny and messy (and shiny!)  I have only used the Clear Face spf 30 so far but have the Clear Face spf 50 to try now that summer is here.  I&#x27;m wondering if the higher spf might translate into a shinier finish...</li>
    <li> Did not like it, made my face super oily. I have acne prone skin.</li>
    <li> as described, no surprises</li>
    <li> I have spent hundreds upon hundreds of dollars trying to find an SPF for my face that would not cause my severe acne to flair up. My dermatologist told me this was great and should try it.&lt;br /&gt;I LOVE IT!! That you neutrogena!</li>
    <li> I just got mine today, it was the last one in the store. It must be popular? idk anyways the other sunscreens by neutrogena stung my sensitive acne prone face a bit, but this one barely tingled :) I love how it has such a high spf but has such a light texture! such a breeze to apply and it doesn&#x27;t feel heavy either! I almost can&#x27;t believe its really spf 50! I think this may be the best sunscreen I&#x27;ve ever used!!! oh and the flip top cap is really convenient. BUT i&#x27;d like a pump...</li>
    <li> Every time I use this sunscreen, I am usually at the pool. I run it on my face and it works great. But then after I get out of the pool to reapply after about 2 hours, it burns VERY bad. I have read many articles on how Neutrogena sunscreens have lots of chemicals and toxins in them, and the pool I go to is chlorine. I am just assuming that after having the chlorine on your face, and putting this sunblock on, somehow the sunscreen reacts with the chlorine in the water and burns REALLY bad for about 30-45 minutes. My 2 sisters and 1 friend have used this and complained about how it burns them too, so I don&#x27;t think the problem is my skin. I have used this sunblock for about 2 months and threw it out 2 days ago. I hope this review is helpful to you. :)</li>
    <li> Does not cause breakouts and gives great coverage! I would highly recommend this alone or with makeup as a daily sunblock.</li>
    <li> While I loved the liquidy texture of this spf and the feel of it on my skin, after an hour of use my skin had rough itchy patches of red for a couple of days. My skin is sensitive and this unfortunately is not a good formula for it.</li>
    <li> This has been my favorite for three years now. Doesn&#x27;t break me out and it stays completely matte through out the day</li>
    <li> You need to wear this stuff and this is a  good one.  Not too thick.</li>
    <li> I have ridiculously awful skin, in that everything I apply to my face tends to break me out. Lotions, makeup, sunscreens, etc. I bought this, sure that it would break me out, but desperate to protect my face from the sun (I decided acne and possible acne scars would be better than skin cancer)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well after over a year of use, I can confidently say that it definitely doesn&#x27;t make my acne any worse! And that is a huge plus for me!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I usually just apply it once in the morning and I&#x27;m good to go for the day. I&#x27;ll reapply if I am spending more time in the sun, or if I happen to get wet or sweaty&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It goes on smooth. It only feels a little greasy at first, but my combination skin is quick to absorb it. Just make sure you run the product in all the way as it is white until you rub enough!</li>
    <li> While it does protect from the sun, it still makes my skin break out :(</li>
    <li> Am early 50&#x27;s.  Skin is drying out and wrinkling due to age, but also has breakouts (how lame is that!?).  Have tried many sunscreens for my face and neck, and even end up using kid&#x27;s, heavy-greasy, SPF30 when I have nothing else.  BUT!  I stumbled across Neutrogena Clear Face SPF 30 sunblock, and now I&#x27;ll use nothing else for my face and neck.  The lotion is lightweight and spreads easily, and is not greasy, oily, or shiny.  Dries into my skin quickly.  Has the standard \\&quot;sunscreen\\&quot; smell (which they probably could do better on... which is why it got only 4stars) - but is not bad.  Package is small (for my purse and car glove box).  Cap lid closes tightsly (no sunscreen explosions!).  And after months of use, NO BREAKOUTS.  Love this product!</li>
    <li> I like it, but it is a little thick for my liking.</li>
    <li> This is the first sunblock that I want to use everyday, even multiple times a day.  It doesn&#x27;t have that immediate matte feeling, but it soaks in and doesn&#x27;t look shiny.  It doesn&#x27;t make my skin sting in any way.  And best of all, NO BREAK OUTS.  No other sunblock has accomplished this!  I put it on at least two times a day, everyday during the summer, and my skin is perfectly clear.  With other sunblocks, I would end up with pimples by day three at the beach, every time.  So glad this product is available!</li>
    <li> I read the reviews for the lotion online and I bought this from my local Duane Reade in my area. Not a fan of the price cause it runs like 12 bucks, but it&#x27;s definitely 12 bucks well spent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have terrible oily skin, especially on my nose. My nose is the most shiny even without applying anything to my face. I&#x27;ve tried aveeno, st. Ives, olay, clean and clear, dove, cetaphil, biore, and so many more face lotions but THIS, I can say for the first time in my life, I&#x27;ve found something that does not leave that greasy, shiny residue look. Not right after I apply, not 30 mins after I apply, and not 5 hours later either. Finally I have a matte look w/ a moisturized feel and the protection to boot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very happy I found this and I would recommend it for oily skin types.</li>
    <li> I bought this after reading good reviews on amazon. It doesnt leave those nasty looking white stuff on your face once you apply it on or makes your face looking greasy afterwards. It&#x27;s like a light moisturizer. This also didnt break out my sensitive face like it claimed to be but the only downside is that stings my face a bit right after I put in on my face.</li>
    <li> I usually have clear skin, but anytime I wear sunscreen I break out in little bumps all over my face.  Using this product, I get no bumps or irritation.  I am very fair skinned and prone to burn, but this works as advertised.  I wore it in the Bahamas, on a day when it was hotter than Hades and was walking around outside for several hours on a tour.  It stayed on despite the sweating.  Neutrogena sunscreen is the best and this is no exception.</li>
    <li> I have been using this sunscreen since last year but somehow it always irritates my face and my eyes. I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s because I put on too much. But it definitely doesn&#x27;t break me out, I&#x27;ll give it that.</li>
    <li> I do not like the feel of most sunscreens on my face. Even ones that are marketed as non greasy or oil free still leave me with a shiny face and a texture that I can feel. Even the Neutrogena Ultra Sheer leaves a bit of a sheen, stings my eyes a bit, and has a fragrance. Not this Clear Face product though. It is transparent, light feeling, doesn&#x27;t clog my pores, and is water resistant. The ONLY thing I wish is that it was a mineral sunscreen (zinc oxide) instead of a chemical one, but I have tried many mineral sunscreens for the face and none have been as transparent and non oily as this one. Highly recommended!!!</li>
    <li> Neutrogena Clear Face Sunblock Lotion offered a variety of benefits:&lt;br /&gt;1. The lotion went on smooth and rubbed in quickly&lt;br /&gt;2. The smell was not overwhelming, and the consistency was slightly watery&lt;br /&gt;3. When I got product in my eyes it did not burn with a voracity as other such products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Certain shortcomings included:&lt;br /&gt;1. Difficulty rubbing the product into my beard&lt;br /&gt;2. Noticed the occurrence of more acne than when I use a similar Cetaphil product&lt;br /&gt;3. I cannot let the lotion sit on my face and pretend I am a ghost&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In all I would recommend this product, however I will continue to purchase the comparable version of the Cetaphil lotion and sunscreen for my UV protection needs!</li>
    <li> Worst product ever! My skin literally peeled offffff from this sunscreen! I have acne prone skin and am currently using the proactiv which dries out my skin but once i put this on my skin was peeling and this broke me out. The texture feels like water, the smell is horrible and you can still smell it once it&#x27;s on. I don&#x27;t like this sunscreen at all.</li>
    <li> I love this product so much. Doesn&#x27;t leave your skin looking shiny or greasy. Great for acne prone skin like mine, long lasting. Great for wearing under makeup. Wouldn&#x27;t buy any other brand.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful moisturizer, as well as sunscreen. It doesn&#x27;t cause any breakouts and I have tried many creams.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this all-chemical sunscreen the whole summer and keep using it every day. I&#x27;ve tried many sunscreens, chemical or physical, and kept none of those, except this Neutrogena.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does not burn or irritate my ultra-sensitive skin like other all-chemical sunscreens, perhaps because the silicone in it encapsulates the sunscreens and they do not absorb in skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has a consistency between milk and yogurt, spreads easily even over hairy areas like beard. Initially it looks slightly white but in a few minutes disappears into an invisible matte finish as if you are wearing nothing. The sunscreen does not add any additional oiliness, but if your skin is naturally very oily, do not expect the matte finish to cover that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At the end of the day, I remove the sunscreen with a milky calming face-wash. I use the Hydrating Facial Cleanser by LACURA that I buy from ALDI for a few dollars. It is another amazing cheap find and is very compatible with the Neutrogena sunscreen.</li>
    <li> This is advertised as SunBLOCK, not sunscreen. Actually when I bought it, the picture showed it saying Sunblock, although I see now the picture has been changed but not the title of the product. Sunblock and sunscreen are very different and this is not what I bought.</li>
    <li> This does not leave my skin feeling greasy and doesn&#x27;t make me reek of sunscreen.</li>
    <li> I wear sunscreen with zinc oxide and titanium dioxide when I&#x27;m going to be in the sun more than just a quick jaunt to and from work. But, on office days, I wear this chemical sunscreen under my makeup. This is the least expensive sunscreen I&#x27;ve found that doesn&#x27;t eventually give me a shiny face.</li>
    <li> I just got it today, but when I look at the expire day, its 6months later. And!!!it looks like it had been used before....the seal is gone, and there is some lotion seep. I won&#x27;t buy it from you again.</li>
    <li> Finally, a sunscreen for the face that feels clean and doesn&#x27;t leave a sticky mess!! It feels a little sticky at first, but it absorbs into the skin nicely, but after about 5 minutes, you forget that you put anything on!</li>
    <li> Completely non-greasy and makes my face feeling very soft.</li>
    <li> I love this sunscreen for my face.  It&#x27;s the first one I&#x27;ve ever tried that doesn&#x27;t feel greasy or look shiny.  I can even put it under my eyes with no irritation.</li>
    <li> I struggle to keep my skin clear and have had NO issues whatsoever with this product.  I am really happy to have found something that works!</li>
    <li> Its not oily at all and keeps my face from getting sunburns. I will definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> This sunscreen does not make me break out and I have very acne-prone skin. It feels very light on my face too and my face doesn&#x27;t look like an oily mess.</li>
    <li> Its amazing,a clear,not heavy cover on your skin,with no smell.&lt;br /&gt;skin care is very important to me so im so(!!) glad i bought it. :)</li>
    <li> Great sunscreen, doesn&#x27;t make you oily or breakout at all. Hurts a bit if you get it in your eyes but that is to be expected. Will buy again!</li>
    <li> nice lotion for the face</li>
    <li> The only sunscreen I use on my face. No breakouts!</li>
    <li> Great sunscreen - not oily.  However, it stings if you get it in your eyes.</li>
    <li> Feels great, non-oily.  Easy application.  No zits afterwards!</li>
    <li> Love this. Not thick or greasy. Does well protecting from sun. Great for my oily acne prone skin.</li>
    <li> Great stuff!  Soaks right into your face and does not cause breakouts.  I use this every day.  Light but pleasant smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only thing that can be improved is the slightly-chalking texture.  I don&#x27;t notice this at all on my face, just on my hands after application.</li>
    <li> Upon application, this made my skin burn. It also feels greasy but I find that all products with sunscreen do.</li>
    <li> This stuff wears great under makeup. It also helps stave off sunglasses tan lines. It also makes me feel like I&#x27;m not going to wind up with skin cancer on my face.</li>
    <li> Nice sunblock for face! Very light without smell.  Good product!</li>
    <li> Very good, light and easy to spread I wear on my face daily. It lasts a while too, so get it! :)</li>
    <li> This is a very thin runny lotion. It&#x27;s easy to spread and absorbs quickly. It leaves no white residue on your skin like traditional Zinc Oxide lotions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I apply this in the morning every day and don&#x27;t see new pimples forming during the day. Although not advertised, this lotion actually reduced the redness of existing acne. When I have dead skin, I can see it slightly moisturizing, but definitely not as well as a normal lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The quantity is substantial. I&#x27;ve been using it for more than a month and I still have half left.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the sun blocking abilities, I haven&#x27;t gotten burned once. Just be careful about placing it near your eyes and playing strenuous sports. This lotion stings like crazy when you sweat and the sweat carries the lotion into your eyes. Your eyes will be watering for a good 10 minutes.</li>
    <li> I like this sunblock because it isn&#x27;t thick or greasy. It is perfect to use under makeup or as a mix in to foundation. It absorbs very quickly and doesn&#x27;t have a fragrance. I would recommend this to people who want a face sunblock. I would even use this on my body since it isn&#x27;t greasy and won&#x27;t get all over your clothes.</li>
    <li> I really like this sunblock because it is almost watery. I recommend applying sunblock BEFORE moisturizer because the watery consistency is more easily absorbed when you apply it prior to the (assumedly) thicker moisturizer. No breakouts.</li>
    <li> Blocks the sun and doesn&#x27;t clog my pores. This lotion is exactly as they describe it. It&#x27;s good for the long days outside without having to worry about getting pimples!</li>
    <li> Since I hit my 30&#x27;s I&#x27;ve had issues with breakouts and I have to be very careful with what products I use on my face. I have tried many facial sunscreens bad this is my current favorite.  It&#x27;s lightweight and wears well under my makeup. The best part is that it doesn&#x27;t cause my face to breakout any more. Great find!</li>
    <li> excellent, doesn&#x27;t run or get in your eyes.... works well in medium sunshine</li>
    <li> I purchased this product in August of 2014 and now it is January 2015. I&#x27;ve used this product every single day since. My problem is that my face gets tan really easily and it is uneven and just not pleasant. This product has helped me a lot! I now use it every day after applying moisturizer (you could even skip the moisturizer. It is pretty hydrating) without worrying about breakouts. It really is breakout free and it feels very light. There&#x27;s a reason I use it every day :)</li>
    <li> I have pcos and have had acne problems for a long time.... I was nervous about putting any lotion on my face but this worked well. Didn&#x27;t notice it causing any problems at all!</li>
    <li> A little oily, but seems effective.</li>
    <li> I have tried several different types of sunblock. However, I have not found one that does not cause acne . Unfortunately, this one also caused me to have a break out.  I&#x27;m not too sure if it&#x27;s because the product is oily but this sunblock has not worked for me.  I have not gotten a sunburn but I am still looking for a sunblock that willl protect my skin and not cause me to have a break out.</li>
    <li> This is great for people who have oily skin and do not want to feel like they are wearing anything on their face.  It absorbs so well and feels so light that you will not want to put another sunscreen on your face ever again!  This just feels great and light and has great protection.  I am glad I tried this one!</li>
    <li> Great sunblock for your face. My husband uses it on his lips and bald head too. Non greasy, too</li>
    <li> Most sunscreens cause my face to break out and they feel greasy to boot. This stuff keeps my skin clear, doesn&#x27;t dry my skin but feels powder dry to the touch.  Great alone or under make-up. I keep a tube in my purse all the time.</li>
    <li> I bought this after contemplating making my own sunscreen, but after further research, I decided against it. I&#x27;ve always been a fan of Neutrogena and this doesn&#x27;t disappoint. Leaves the skin soft, protected, and in its natural skin tone (no whitening effect). I would buy it again!</li>
    <li> i think this does a good job of protecting my face from the sun. it does leave an oily finish but that&#x27;s okay with me because i use a pressed powder to mattify my face. it didn&#x27;t cause me to break out which is good because my face is acne prone. there&#x27;s no scent; i like how it doesn&#x27;t smell like a sunblock. i will buy this product again.</li>
    <li> i searched for a higher level SPF sunscreen that would not cause my skin to break out. I used it on my recent vacation and it did not disappoint. I came home without sunburn and skin that was blemish free!</li>
    <li> This is product amazing. I&#x27;ve struggled with terrible acne due to my really dry skin for years. I tried different products, face washes, and spent way too much on dermatology visits for crap that didn&#x27;t work. I gave this sunscreen a shot, and it has worked wonders. I use it twice a day, and I have the occasional pimple like once a month now, mostly because I&#x27;ll forget to apply it for a couple of days. I can&#x27;t promote this product more.</li>
    <li> Good if you&#x27;re pale, not good if you&#x27;re not. Leaves a whitish cast on the face and I cannot use it as a woman of color.</li>
    <li> work good with me , no acne outbreak</li>
    <li> I use this every morning on my face and neck. It is nice and light and non greasy. Love it.</li>
    <li> This is the best sunscreen I&#x27;ve found to use on my face. My skin is already naturally oily, and this product is perfect.</li>
    <li> my foundation only had spf 6, not enough. tried several different moisturizers with higher spf and they all made my face too oily, causing makeup to wear off faster and causing me to break out. then i came across this awesome product and now i have found what i have been looking for for so long! Perfect consistency, non-greasy. DOES NOT MAKE MY FACE PRODUCE OIL AND PROTECTS ME FROM SUN!!! thanks neutrogena for an awesome product!! the advertisement is true: you finally dont have to choose between clear skin and sun protection!</li>
    <li> I strongly recommend it.</li>
    <li> The lotion feels so good,really dries matte which is important for my oily skin.</li>
    <li> The only sunblock that won&#x27;t cause me breakouts.</li>
    <li> Very light texture, not greasy. Easy to apply under makeup.</li>
    <li> Fragrance-free, oil-free, super gentle and amazingly matte. I dare anyone to apply this to their face and try to detect it by sight or touch once it&#x27;s dry (which is very quick). It truly is as if NOTHING is on your skin, but the protection is there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My dermatologist is always telling me to use a good sunscreen everyday, but where to find one that isn&#x27;t oily and heavy for my face? I can&#x27;t wear it if it slides off. What to do? I have been looking for so long, like many, for a non-irritating, non-greasy sunscreen for my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally....Bingo! :)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m used to SPF15 Oil of Olay for daily facial use, so using Neutrogena&#x27;s product at SPF 30 was a bit thicker than I was used to. It goes on more like a sunblock than a lotion, but I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s more effective as well.</li>
    <li> Worst crap I have ever put on my face. I broke out immediately after one use and this was the worst break out I&#x27;ve had since I was teenager. So bad that coworkers asked me if what was wrong with my face!  I threw this stuff in the trash. If you have sensitive or acne prone skin don&#x27;t believe the lie on the label. You will NOT have a clear face of you go anywhere near this product. Awful awful awful. Negative 5 stars is more accurate than 1. Amazon needs to implement a 0 star rating at least.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t get a burn on my skin while wearing this, but OUCH my eyes burned!! The slightest sweat or seaspray made my eyes burn for hours. Tried 3 different times and all 3 times I wore it my eyes burned!! OUCH!</li>
    <li> Only sunscreen my husband will use. I prefer a mineral based product, which in my mind is the only true sun block.</li>
    <li> This is a light sunblock lotion that does not ball up under makeup. It feels a little greasy at first, but after a minute or so it dries to a soft, almost powdery finish. Does not break me out. Love it!</li>
    <li> I really like it.  Not shiny, doesn&#x27;t irritate my eyes.</li>
    <li> Protects from sunburn, good consistency, not greasy and doesn&#x27;t make my face shiny, works good under makeup.  You&#x27;ll be happy with your purchase.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Neutrogena Ultra Sheer Dry-Touch Sunblock on my face for a few years; it is really good.  But when I saw this \\&quot;Clear Face\\&quot; version, I decided to try it.  I actually prefer this Clear Face because it is so sheer feeling &amp; oil-free.  They are NOT the same product and feel different when applied.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like it because it disappears in to my skin, leaving it matte, not shiny at all.  The Ultra Sheer is a bit more like a lotion. It&#x27;s not greasy but does leave a feeling of lotion on my face.  This Clear Face is so light, I hardly know I&#x27;m wearing it.  Even my husband likes it &amp; that is saying something because he is not a lotion-on-the-face kind of guy.  And there is virtually no scent which is great since it&#x27;s on your face where you really notice scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When you first put this on, it&#x27;s quite white/watery &amp; you may think it&#x27;s a disaster but... just lightly smooth it in &amp; it disappears quickly.  And it does block the sun.  I have no burning when I wear this sunscreen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have sensitive skin, this may not be the product for you.  I felt a slight \\&quot;burning\\&quot; sensation when I applied it.  It went away quickly but I could see that being a problem for some people.  I also got a little on my lips &amp; they still felt slightly irritated the next day.  The ingredient list is interesting &amp; includes \\&quot;cinnamomum zeylanicum bark extract\\&quot; which is from the cinnamon tree and \\&quot;cedrus atlantica bark extract\\&quot; which is from a cedar tree.  Both have antiseptic properties which is probably why they are in this \\&quot;clear face\\&quot; lotion.  But they can also cause irritation so if you have very sensitive skin, beware. The Neutrogena Ultra Sheer Dry-Touch Sunblock does not contain either of those ingredients and may be a better choice for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B004D2DR0Q Neutrogena Ultra Sheer SPF 45 Twin Pack 3.0  Ounce]]</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t have bad adult acne, but I do have triggers (some random, some predictable). It seems using this triggers little ones. Not horrible, but I was looking for something that didn&#x27;t cause any blemishes. I can use it one day and be fine, but 2 in a row and I&#x27;m guaranteed to see unwanted results. I tried an Aveeno product with the same results. I&#x27;m now trying an Olay sensitive skin product to see if that&#x27;s any better.</li>
    <li> Not oily, definitely didn&#x27;t cause breakouts. I feel better using this on my face than traditional sunscreen</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know what it is about this sunscreen but it really stings my face when I put it on. Not good for sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> I was so scared to try an everyday face sunscreen because my skin is so oily and prone to breakouts, along with being sensitive. However, this stuff is great. It doesn&#x27;t make me shiny, even under a full face of makeup. I wore it on a trip where I got more sun in a week than I&#x27;ve had in the last year. I didn&#x27;t get a bit of sunburn, or any color at all. I will buy this sunscreen again and again.</li>
    <li> I was a little skeptical at first about getting sunscreen even after reading how good it is to use sunscreen over at skincareaddiction on Reddit because I just don&#x27;t get enough sun. I ended up getting this because the research says it helps with the acne marks you get from ripping off the pimples and I just have to say my face is getting clearer.&lt;br /&gt;I use CeraVe Foaming, CeraVe Moisturizing, Stridex(red box), and Neutrogena Clear Face Sunblock Lotion SPF 30&lt;br /&gt;I am already seeing results and have only been using these product for 2 weeks.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my son who has very fair skin and severe acne.  He said that it is a bit on the watery side as far as consistency.  But overall, he is pretty happy with it!</li>
    <li> I have very fair and freckled skin, but don&#x27;t want a greasy face. Use this every day, rain or shine, and it works well!</li>
    <li> I did not buy this at Amazon but I love it so much I had to write a review and my recommendations. First:  I have had very oily/acne-prone skin all my life. My skin is also very fair, and sensitive, and I live in South Florida. Non-chemical sunscreens are too thick and make me break out. Most chemical sunscreens are too oily AND they burn my sensitive skin, especially at high SPFs. I find that with care (using a very mild cleanser) this product protects my skin from the sun, while making it matte and oil-free for hours and hours without causing any breakouts. It&#x27;s great under foundation and I don&#x27;t have to blot or touchup all day, while a lot of other primers and sunscreens (even so-called matte ones) cause a major grease-attack. I love to experiment with new products, but I am sold on this one. The appearance on your skin is natural, smooth, and looking a just-washed matte.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To recap:  is your skin oily yet sensitive? BUY THIS IN SPF 30. Wear it every day. Even if you have darker skin or live in a less-than-tropical climate. Skin cancer is no fun. I have had small pre-cancers removed - with either freezing it or cauterizing. Yes, it hurts as much as it sounds. The freezing left me with white scars and the cauterizing with pink marks which lasted for months. Skin cancer hurts, skin cancer is ugly, and skin cancer kills. Don&#x27;t be a victim.</li>
    <li> I finally found a sunscreen I like! I needed a sunscreen I could wear while attending a three-day outdoor event. I wanted to be able to wear make-up over it, and be able to reapply it without making a mess or feeling sticky. I also have very sensitive skin. This sunscreen was perfect! I skipped my regular (non-sunscreen) moisturizer and used the Neutrogena Clear Face instead. It rubbed in easily, didn&#x27;t leave my skin looking white and ghostly, and dried to a matte finish. After a few minutes, I could put my face powder right over it and I never felt like I was wearing sunscreen. Hardly any scent at all, no skin irritation, no shine. This is the one to buy if you&#x27;ve been frustrated with greasy-feeling or smelly sunscreens.</li>
    <li> I really like the fact that this is a sunblock designed for acne prone skin...HOWEVER, I find that it doesn&#x27;t really mattify skin or keep oil at bay, which are two major things for me. Usually after I apply it my skin looks pretty shiny and feels a little sticky-ish. This sunscreen is more on the runny-ish side and does have a stronger &#x27;sunscreen&#x27; scent when it first goes on, but it dissipates fairly quickly. I don&#x27;t consider myself to be someone who has sensitive skin, but this sometimes stings my face a bit when I apply it. I&#x27;m not quite sure why this is, but it could be that I exfoliated too much or my skin is on the drier side in some areas. This sunblock does make good on its promise not to break you out, and it does have a light feel for a sunscreen. I usually wait ten minutes before I apply any makeup, just to make sure it&#x27;s fully absorbed. It doesn&#x27;t pill up when I accidentally rub or itch my face, which is also nice. I probably won&#x27;t repurchase this, I bought this as a cheaper alternative to the Elta MD sunscreen, but I&#x27;m thinking I should have just shelled out the ten extra bucks for the better product.</li>
    <li> My derm suggested I switch from the popular, less expensive suntan lotions to Neutrogena. I love the sun, but was looking for a way to protect my face, neck, upper chest and back without breaking out. WINNING PRODUCT! The breakouts have stopped. Stocking up on this product for my face and using another brand for body...</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a greaseball which is gonna pay when I get older but I am tired tired tired of alternately slimey or too dry irritating sunscreen. Excellent for mineral makeup as it&#x27;s dry and actually collects your T-zone oil all day long. In conjunction with clinical stress Secret your anxious, greasy self might be able to hide the outward appearance of fear, nervousness and sweating. Another lifechanger that my skin will thank me for later.</li>
    <li> I tried another top rates sunscreen from Amazon and my skin broke out immediately. Neutrogena is always the best! My skin looks great and I feel my makeup goes on really well over it.</li>
    <li> Best sunblock around. Not greasy, no sunburn.</li>
    <li> Loved this sunblock! Used it throughout southeast Asia and didn&#x27;t get burned at all - despite being outside all day. It didn&#x27;t make me breakout and didn&#x27;t have the weird odor that so many sunblocks have. I didn&#x27;t even just use it on my face - since it was so effective and non-greasy, I used it everywhere. Love it.</li>
    <li> I should have read the ingredients before purchasing. I do not like to use chemical sunscreens. If you don&#x27;t mind using them then this should be fine for acne prone skin.</li>
    <li> When I use this in the morning before heading outside this sunblock works amazing and doesn&#x27;t make me break out at all, which I love.  However if I need to reapply while I&#x27;m out at the pool it irritates the skin horribly and burns when I apply it.  As an everyday usage it works fantastic though, I just do not recommend for sensitive skin for thorough usage outside.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m so broke out from this product!  Once again, I tried a sunblock that is supposed to not cause zits.  Now I look like pizza face.  Seriously, I want to cry, scream, hide in my house, etc.  I can&#x27;t believe this...but I&#x27;m going to get the Qing Outdoor Flap Hat sold in sporting goods on Amazon.  You have to look at this.  It&#x27;s crazy AND I&#x27;m going to look crazy while mowing the lawn, but l am at the end of my rope.</li>
    <li> After loving the Ultra Sheer version of this product for my arms, neck, back, etc., I thought I&#x27;d give the Clear Face version of this a try. Much to my dismay, my husband and I both felt a lot of strong stinging sensation on our faces. We had no obvious face irritation (he hadn&#x27;t just shaved, and I hadn&#x27;t washed/exfoliated my face that day) and were shocked at how much discomfort this sunscreen caused! We had to reapply a couple of times since we were at a long baseball game, and we experienced the same stinging sensation every time. My husband does admittedly have sensitive skin, but mine has never had any problems. I&#x27;m not sure what ingredient could be causing the irritation, especially since I have never had trouble with Neutrogena products before. I will be sticking to the regular Ultra Sheer for my body and look for something gentler for my face.</li>
    <li> I have fair skin and burn very easily in the sun, so sunscreen is a necessity for me. However, I hate the smell and the greasy feel of sunscreen. So I went on a hunt to&lt;br /&gt;find a non-greasy, little to no scent sunscreen that still protected me. This product does all of that. I put it on and it soaked in within 5 minutes. I was able to wear a full face of makeup over it (Bare Minerals original powder makeup) with no smell, no greasy feel, no sunburn, and my makeup stayed put all day in the sun! It really is a great product! I&#x27;m so happy I found it!</li>
    <li> I found out it still made my face break out then I found out I was allergic to one of the ingredience and I cannot use it anymore. When I read clear face I assumed it would work obviously its not as great as I thought. So now I have almost a full tube that I don&#x27;t know what to do with.</li>
    <li> First sunblock I use that I can honestly say does not make me break out...finally!!! I&#x27;ve gone trough countless sunscreens but they all made me break out. This one goes on smooth, not greasy and best of all no breakouts</li>
    <li> Worked great.  Not greasy and stayed on after being in the water.</li>
    <li> Non-greasy, great on my sensitive skin!</li>
    <li> I have been looking for a sun block like this for some time. Shiseido has a similar sun block but it is $30 per ounce. Goes on like a liquid but is not oily like other products. Dries to a nice matte finish. Not sure how effective it is blocking sun yet but at least it looks good once it is on.</li>
    <li> I used to believe I had a hormonal problem until I went to a dermatologist, who told me I have a very sensitive skin. I am born and raised in NYC, my skin is always exposed to pollution. After spending thousands of dollars, my dermatologist recommended I stop using everything all together and stick with this product-only. I was told to give it six weeks and on the sixth week, miracle happened. I trust this product fully and went on to recommend it to others who has acne problems. I&#x27;m going for a chemical peeling, now that my skin has been acne controlled for the past six months, to rid of my scars!</li>
    <li> Love the 30 SPF block, Hard to go wrong with Neutrogena, have other products, but the SPF isn&#x27;t the 30...(less). Shipped quickly. Would buy again.</li>
    <li> Let&#x27;s just say that normal sunscreen burns, breaks me out, makes me feel like my skin is under attack. Gone for really expensive, aggressive Sunscreens in the past to protect face, and I&#x27;ve tried......really tried for 4/5yrs - and one day, I walk into walmart, look @ this product, remember that growing up, I never had a single problem with Neutrogena, even with my oily t-zone, and dry \\&quot;rest of the face\\&quot; - I picked this product.&lt;br /&gt;Its been 3 weeks now, no spots, no break outs. Hell, I don&#x27;t even remember I have it on. Even sleep with it on........  You don&#x27;t know how bad I&#x27;ve wanted this - so it&#x27;s great \\&quot;finally\\&quot; to have something for protection.&lt;br /&gt;As a side effect, it finishes with a \\&quot;matte\\&quot; feel, so the oil production is reduced.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So acne prone, sensitive faced people like me, be happy. Be very happy.</li>
    <li> Neutrogena&#x27;s Clear Face Sunblock is a great product.  It is one of the few that does not make me break out.</li>
    <li> Works great!  Soaks right into the skin, doesn&#x27;t leave any white residue.</li>
    <li> Light smell, not whitening and very light.</li>
    <li> As advertised, this did not clog my pores and cause acne.</li>
    <li> I spend a lot of time in the sun, so sun protection is a must.  I also have historically sensitive, acne-prone skin, so I can&#x27;t just put anything on my face.  For a while I have been using another product by neutrogena that costs twice as much as this product (and it&#x27;s smaller), and it leaves my pores feeling clogged and my skin greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not this product!  It&#x27;s oil-free, has a high SPF (my dermatologist recommends at least 20), and leaves your skin feeling fresh with a matte finish. I have had no breakouts as a result of this product.  I recommend it to anyone with sensitive skin who needs protection from the sun.</li>
    <li> My wife and I decided to try this as it is a light weight sunscreen.  This much is true, it is not as oily as other sunscreens.  We tried it at the beach in Wildwood New Jersey and we both got sunburn.  Im a pro at not getting sunburn and I reappplied after going in the ocean and after sitting out for hours.  Did not help.  We switched back to our old brand the following day and we did not get sunburn.</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with this sunblock.  It did exactly what it promised.  It is not greasy and I used it on my face - some days without makeup and other days under my liquid foundation.  I will definitely order this product again.</li>
    <li> Not enough to moisturize dry skin, sometimes it becomes flaky + don&#x27;t use if you already have acne.. use only to prevent acne.</li>
    <li> I have sensitive skin and this sun block is scent free, moisturizing and really works well.</li>
    <li> This works great as a daily application for sunblock on the face and neck.  It works the exact way the product is described.</li>
    <li> This really does not break me out so I have finally found a facial sunscreen&lt;br /&gt;that does what it says. I just had a BCC removed on my forehead so I am taking&lt;br /&gt;this serious now.</li>
    <li> I find that this product will burn your eyes if you sweat or get into the water.  Perhaps if neither is a concern for you it wouldn&#x27;t be a problem.  It is true to its labeling and it didn&#x27;t break me out, but the burning was a deal breaker.</li>
