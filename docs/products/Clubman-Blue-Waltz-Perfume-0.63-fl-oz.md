      <li>This is such a delightful throwback to my youth</li>
      <li>I was quite pleased.</li>
      <li>lol....when she opened it,,,,,and got a whiff of it, she said it brought back the good old days, and I was very happy about that.  </li>
      <li>I love this, so clean and sweet without being sticky!</li>
      <li>Brings back so many happy memories.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s the same wonderful, sweet scent that I so loved as a young girl.</li>
      <li>Quick shipment!</li>
      <li>When she opened it and got all excited to smell it...</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a wonderful remembrance of years past.</li>
      <li>dosent  smell  like the  original</li>
      <li>but you bought what you could afford, and the bottles were pretty, so you just knew your mother was going to love getting this.</li>
      <li>Worth the money!</li>
      <li>Wonderful ... Brings back sweet memories of an old sweetheart</li>
      <li>and she was so surprised and pleased!</li>
      <li>I used this perfume back in 1974 and loved it.</li>
      <li>she was quickly turned off.</li>
      <li>My favorite scent as a young girl!</li>
      <li>She wrapped it back up and sent it to her friend - maybe she will like it better!</li>
      <li>brought back so many memories of my childhood in the 50&#x27;s!</li>
      <li>I bought this as a gift for someone who grew up in the 50&#x27;s/60&#x27;s that said this smelled amazing back then.</li>
      <li>I was thrilled to find that Blue Waltz Perfume was still being made - I cannot estimate how many gallons of the stuff were given to mothers on Mothers&#x27; Day, the old ladies&#x27; birthday, and Christmas.</li>
      <li>It was such a nice scent when I wore as child.</li>
      <li>A few years ago I was able to purchase 2 bottles from a company online and was thrilled that it was the identical fragrance I remembered.  </li>
      <li>She remembered it from when she was a little girl, and it still smells wonderfully the same.</li>
      <li>Thank you very much.</li>
      <li>Sure enough, I found it</li>
      <li>so glad they brought it back</li>
      <li>Smells exactly as I remember it smelled when grandma gave me my first bottle.</li>
      <li>This brought back so many memories for my sister and I</li>
      <li>So glad it&#x27;s back.</li>
      <li>Thanks!</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s from the 50&#x27;s and couldn&#x27;t find it for a longgg time nor could my grandmother she used to buy it at her favorite five &amp; dime store but not for a long&#x27;g time</li>
      <li>As a young girl I often wore Blue Waltz Perfume and loved the soft, powdery scent.  </li>
      <li>My little granddaughter loves to dab on this perfume that sits on my dresser, so I wanted to get her her own bottle and another for myself.</li>
      <li>I won&#x27;t be using as much as I thought.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s reasonably priced as well.</li>
      <li>Fast delivery.</li>
      <li>,It came in really fast after I ordered it, no problem,I will order from this person again.</li>
      <li>&amp;#34;0MG&amp;#34; what an AWEsome find, I remember this back when I was a ill&#x27;girl</li>
      <li>Amazon which I wasn&#x27;t thinking I&#x27;d be lucky enough to find</li>
      <li>My mother wore this in high school.</li>
      <li>I love this perfume, I can remember going to The Ben Franklin store  when I was a little girl  with my Mom and buying this perfume</li>
      <li>I gave one as a gift to a childhood friend, as one of our favorite memories was buying these little 25 cent bottles of perfume at Woolworths when we were kids in the 1960&#x27;s.  </li>
      <li>It bought back good memories, but I&#x27;m not sure I still like the aroma.</li>
      <li>Right off I could see that the perfume is darker and the label different.  </li>
      <li>This was back in the 1950&#x27;s when we had a Ben Franklin Five and Dime in our town (Vineyard Haven), and, if Blue Waltz wasn&#x27;t available, there was always Evening in Paris, which came in a cobalt-blue bottle.     </li>
      <li>Very soft and lingering fragrance</li>
      <li>but wow I put in in search an woo&#x27;la</li>
      <li>She was so surprised when I gave it to her</li>
      <li>my 15 year old girlfriend&#x27;s sister give her this for her birthday.</li>
      <li>&amp;#34;Blue Waltz&amp;#34; was the perfume my mother used when she was young.</li>
      <li>like it did when I was young.</li>
      <li>old.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s nice being transported  to the past by a single fragrance.</li>
      <li>Wearing this was like going back to my High school Dance.  </li>
      <li>The scent brings me back, to those days when Ma smelled like BW for a few days after her special occasion, and then she&#x27;d go back to Tabu, a much stronger blend.    </li>
      <li>took a chance, but it was way too old to even resemble the old \\&quot;Blue Waltz\\</li>
      <li>this was originally given to my mom when she was very little, so when i found it and found it didnt change-</li>
      <li>The Blue Waltz Perfume has clearly been diluted.  </li>
      <li>I bought this for my mother, as she recalled that she wore blue waltz perfume when she was young, so im talking over 50 yrs ago,</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t wear perfume, not even patchouli (even though I am an old hippy), but I do appreciate the evocative power of Blue Waltz Perfume.    </li>
      <li>The bottles look pretty, but that soft, powdery smell is missing.</li>
      <li>Blue Waltz Perfume still comes in a heart-shaped, clear glass bottle, with the characteristic light blue cap that reminds me of an artichoke or those odd shapes on the Chrysler Building.</li>
      <li>Blue Waltz is a perfume that my wife used to wear when she was young was recently looking for it and couldn&#x27;t find.</li>
      <li>I keep my BWP right on my kitchen table, near the pile of mail and other stuff that seems to accumulate, and I give it a little sniff now and then.</li>

    <li> As a young girl I often wore Blue Waltz Perfume and loved the soft, powdery scent.  A few years ago I was able to purchase 2 bottles from a company online and was thrilled that it was the identical fragrance I remembered.  I gave one as a gift to a childhood friend, as one of our favorite memories was buying these little 25 cent bottles of perfume at Woolworths when we were kids in the 1960&#x27;s.  My little granddaughter loves to dab on this perfume that sits on my dresser, so I wanted to get her her own bottle and another for myself. I could not have been happier with the ease of purchasing it through Amazon and the speedy delivery, but am disappointed in the product itself. Right off I could see that the perfume is darker and the label different.  The fragrance is similar but much stronger, so I was disappointed.  It was inexpensive, so just didn&#x27;t want the hassle of returning it, but I don&#x27;t wear it.  The bottles look pretty, but that soft, powdery smell is missing.</li>
    <li> this was originally given to my mom when she was very little, so when i found it and found it didnt change- i got it for her for her 70th birthday.... boy was she surprised...and very happy...</li>
    <li> I was thrilled to find that Blue Waltz Perfume was still being made - I cannot estimate how many gallons of the stuff were given to mothers on Mothers&#x27; Day, the old ladies&#x27; birthday, and Christmas. This was back in the 1950&#x27;s when we had a Ben Franklin Five and Dime in our town (Vineyard Haven), and, if Blue Waltz wasn&#x27;t available, there was always Evening in Paris, which came in a cobalt-blue bottle.

I don&#x27;t wear perfume, not even patchouli (even though I am an old hippy), but I do appreciate the evocative power of Blue Waltz Perfume.    Thank you, Amazon!!!</li>
    <li> This brought back so many memories for my sister and I so glad they brought it back</li>
    <li> My favorite scent as a young girl! Still love it! Glad it&#x27;s still available for purchase today! Worth the money!</li>
    <li> After being disappointed by the Evening in Paris, I was prepared to be disappointed again. Surpirse! This scent smells fresh and delightfully like it did when I was young. Will probably purchase again. Thanks!</li>
    <li> Wonderful ... Brings back sweet memories of an old sweetheart</li>
    <li> Way back when I used to buy this for mom at Christmas....been looking for it a long time.....takes me back and it&#x27;s just wonderful.</li>
    <li> I remember this as a little girl....it cost 39 cents.&lt;br /&gt;As an adult, my friends and I used to pass a bottle around on each other&#x27;s birthday.</li>
    <li> EeWw[...]  took a chance, but it was way too old to even resemble the old \\&quot;Blue Waltz\\&quot; we used to put on in our school library, instead of studying!</li>
    <li> Beautiful fragrance on this perfume, a must have for any collector of perfumes. A perfect gift for nieces or granddaughters too.</li>
    <li> loved it.  brought back so many memories of my childhood in the 50&#x27;s!</li>
    <li> I used this perfume back in 1974 and loved it.So glad it&#x27;s back. It&#x27;s reasonably priced as well. Love it!</li>
    <li> The Blue Waltz Perfume has clearly been diluted.  One of the two bottles I bought had been opened and some was gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(Having purchased Blue Waltz Perfume in the past, and still having some of the previous left, I know how this perfume should be in terms of scent and color.</li>
    <li> Promptly received the above item in perfect condition and it smelled as wonderful as it did when I was a child and buying it for my mother for Christmas! every year!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve loved it for years and years.  My grandmother used to wear it.</li>
    <li> Great seller! Quick shipment! I was very pleased with my purchase. &amp;#34;Blue Waltz&amp;#34; was the perfume my mother used when she was young. She was feeling nostalgic about the smell and heart-shaped bottle one day so I figured I should try to find some to buy for her. Sure enough, I found it and she was so surprised and pleased!</li>
    <li> If you are my age, 65 and needed or wanted to buy your mother a present, and just happened to have a couple of bucks, then, you might have bought her a bottle of this. I&#x27;ve been told that it IS the worlds cheapest perfume! Maybe so, but you bought what you could afford, and the bottles were pretty, so you just knew your mother was going to love getting this. I&#x27;ve also been told that it&#x27;s the worlds worst smelling perfume. I beg to differ, it&#x27;s not the worst, might not be for every one, but so far, no one has gagged when I&#x27;ve shoved it under their noses. I bought this for nostalgic reasons, for some reason, my mother never managed to keep any around. Not even the empty bottles. I like it though, and was very happy to find it again, being as how Woolworth is  no longer here. Brings back so many happy memories.</li>
    <li> dosent  smell  like the  original</li>
    <li> This is such a delightful throwback to my youth and I just had to buy a bottle. It&#x27;s the same wonderful, sweet scent that I so loved as a young girl. So glad to see that it&#x27;s still around.</li>
    <li> Very soft and lingering fragrance</li>
    <li> Got it for a gift for my mom. She remembered it from when she was a little girl, and it still smells wonderfully the same.</li>
    <li> When I was 17 (1959) my 15 year old girlfriend&#x27;s sister give her this for her birthday. The scent made me crazy. It is just a nostalgic scent for me and keeps the memories alive. I still love her to this day.</li>
    <li> Grandma could not find this anywhere but I did.  She is reliving her past while using it.</li>
    <li> I love this perfume, I can remember going to The Ben Franklin store  when I was a little girl  with my Mom and buying this perfume,I didn&#x27;t think I could buy it anywhere any more,It came in really fast after I ordered it, no problem,I will order from this person again.Thank you very much. Sincerely, June Johnson</li>
    <li> Not as good smelling as I remember it being. I loved this when I was a teenager.I won&#x27;t be using as much as I thought.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s just like the one I had when I was a child, late 40&#x27;s and early 50&#x27;s. I didn&#x27;t realize they still made it and I wanted it to add to my perfume bottle collection which I&#x27;ve had for many years. It&#x27;s a wonderful remembrance of years past. It was mentioned in a recent book I read, My One Square Inch of Alaska, and brought back memories of my time in the 1950&#x27;s.</li>
    <li> Wearing this was like going back to my High school Dance.  Loved it then, still love it now..</li>
    <li> I was so disappointed. Why did U makethescent stronger. Wanted to give to my Great grand daughter but to strong for 11 yr. old. It was such a nice scent when I wore as child.</li>
    <li> Bought this because I wore it as a teenager in the 50&#x27;s.  It bought back good memories, but I&#x27;m not sure I still like the aroma.</li>
    <li> Blue Waltz is a perfume that my wife used to wear when she was young was recently looking for it and couldn&#x27;t find. She found it somewhere that she could order it from. I somehow talked here out of the order and secretly ordered it from amazon. She was so surprised when I gave it to her and I still haven&#x27;t told here where I got it from, so I can reorder it when she runs out.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my mother, as she recalled that she wore blue waltz perfume when she was young, so im talking over 50 yrs ago, lol....when she opened it,,,,,and got a whiff of it, she said it brought back the good old days, and I was very happy about that.  the seller was prompt with delivery, it even arrived ahead of time.  I was quite pleased.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a gift for someone who grew up in the 50&#x27;s/60&#x27;s that said this smelled amazing back then. When she opened it and got all excited to smell it... she was quickly turned off. She wrapped it back up and sent it to her friend - maybe she will like it better!</li>
    <li> My mother wore this in high school. I sent her a bottle and she really enjoyed it. We talked about the memories it brought back.</li>
    <li> This perfume was something my wife and her sister remembered from their childhood.  We couldn&#x27;t find it anywhere else, and you had it and they are very happy with it!  Thank You!</li>
    <li> I love this, so clean and sweet without being sticky!</li>
    <li> This was a gift for a friend who loves it!</li>
    <li> Smells exactly as I remember it smelled when grandma gave me my first bottle. I only wish the label looked the same.</li>
    <li> Fast delivery. I appreciate that. It brought happy memories from the 50&#x27;s! Perfume from Doll, Music from Dad. It&#x27;s nice being transported  to the past by a single fragrance.</li>
