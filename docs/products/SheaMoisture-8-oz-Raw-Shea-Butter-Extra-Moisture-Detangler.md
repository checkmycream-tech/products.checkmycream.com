      <li>I was worried it would make my hair greasy, but it just makes it amazing.  </li>

      <li>Detangles ok but leaves my hair greasy</li>
      <li>I love the scent/fragrence of this detangler.  </li>
      <li>Much better than Kinky Curly Knot</li>

      <li>Much better that the KCKT as</li>
      <li>Love it.</li>
      <li>This is the best moisturizer / detangler for the SUMMERTIME only....</li>
      <li>Its ok but sticky</li>
      <li>would ask for everyone to try it, you too will love it.</li>
      <li>I was hesitent at first but my strands loved it, and it didn&#x27;t leave a greasy residue.  </li>
      <li>I cannot believe how easy it was to part and comb her hair with EASE.  </li>
      <li>I have curly fine hair.  </li>
      <li>I bought this on eBay 2 for $18 free shipping!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>but it wasn&#x27;t it was soft and glossy (in a good way).</li>
      <li>Today was buy one get one half off at Walgreen&#x27;s, however, this price is ok for a great product with quality ingredients.</li>
      <li>Texture is odd at first when you put it on, but after you comb it once, you can tell this is a great product!  </li>
      <li>This concoction is natural and amazing.  </li>
      <li>Now I will say that when I put it on, my hair felt coated and and kind of yucky, but once it dries, my hair is so soft and moisturized.  </li>
      <li>I find that Glycerin (the first ingredient) is better for summer, hot humid climates.</li>
      <li>I also mix it with water and have it in a spray bottle for quick frizz reducer.</li>
      <li>I used it on her last night and was able to pick apart the knots easier than ever!</li>
      <li>This product is absolutely UNREAL!!</li>
      <li>I have fine, medium thickness, very wavy/curly caucasion hair</li>
      <li>but if I let some sun hit it the greasiness gets absorbed.  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know if the product just doesn&#x27;t work for me anymore, or if it&#x27;s just something with my hair right now.  </li>
      <li>haven&#x27;t used it right after a wash yet.  </li>
      <li>I love all of the Shea moisture product and this is no different, it give me so much moisture and easy to detangle my hair</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m very sensitive to scents and it&#x27;s fairly strong.  </li>
      <li>We live in colorado so keeping her hair moisturized is also a huge challenge.</li>
      <li>the whole shea moisture raw shea butter line is great</li>
      <li>and it only cost 11 or 12 dollars at most.</li>
      <li>No real smell to it which is nice too.</li>
      <li>I was able to untangle my entire uncombed for a month hair in about 1/2 an hour.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I was using another similar leave-in detangler and while I really like it, this one is so much better.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m caucasian with fine wavy/frizzy hair that is super dry.</li>
      <li>Both of those ingredients from what I have observed in using detangling products takes away from the \\&quot;slip\\&quot; and \\&quot;slippery\\&quot; element/feel that is necessary for hair to be easily detangled.  </li>
      <li>I wash and condition my hair in the shower with shea moisture shampoo and conditioner, towel dry hair, and then put a good quarter sized amount of this stuff on the length of my armpit length hair starting at the tips working up towards about my ears.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t like combing my hair too much, and using this product, my hair stays moist and shiny for days without adding anything.  </li>
      <li>This has made bedtime much easier.  </li>
      <li>It made her hair soft and slippery and it didn&#x27;t feel dry and brittle like after most products I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
      <li>I mainly use it on dry hair, primarily because I just wash it a couple times a week.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using Shea Moisture products on her hair because it&#x27;s natural and has a nice long lasting scent.  </li>
      <li>I put a little dab on my hand, rub my palms together and rub this through, repeating if I want more moisture.</li>
      <li>( i have low porosity hair hence the steam room) and it is easy to come out without losing a handful of hair, the only problem i see is the price on here</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s part of the new ingredients that were added to Kinky Curly&#x27;s Knot</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m almost done with my first bottle seven months later -</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t consider this light weight through so people with thinner hair might be weighted down from this.</li>
      <li>I used a little more than I probably needed to and thought her hair would actually be greasy in the morning</li>
      <li>Now with the tangles gone, the pick slides through his hair easily and he can actually concentrate on other things while I comb his hair.  </li>
      <li>The red in my hair is very course</li>
      <li>My 4a low porosity coils really reacted well to this product.</li>
      <li>I was surprised by this product.</li>
      <li>It super-moisturizes my hair but completely absorbs.  </li>
      <li>Makes your hair soft and manageable.  </li>
      <li>I am natural  </li>
      <li>My hair was butter, so soft and shiny.  </li>
      <li>However, I am five months post my last relaxer, and was searching for a product that would moisturize my hair without it becoming oily and without oil dripping down from my scalp- or ruining my sheets.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used it several times after shampooing and conditioning with other products in the line (which I love overall), but it just dries out my 4a/b hair.</li>
      <li>so i stick to 4 main products on a daily basis, this one, the shea moisture conditioner, grape seed oil and chi&#x27;s lily hair tonic.</li>
      <li>Most of their products make my 4a/4b/4c coils feel dry or have no effect at all, and were a complete waste of $10-15 each time.</li>
      <li>I just used this particular product tonight, after realizing I ran out of her regular conditioner.  </li>
      <li>I used the raw shea butter conditioner with this for my wash and go my hair was defined soft and full of body</li>
      <li>This is the only thing that I changed up since my last haircut so crediting it for the change seems reasonable.  </li>
      <li>If you have fine or limp hair this will probably leave your hair a little greasy - if I put too much in or don&#x27;t use a clarifying conditioner about once a week</li>
      <li>It has similar key detangling ingredients that the Kinky Curly Knot Today detangler has, but the main ingredient that I can observe in the ingredients of both this Shea Moisture Detangler and Kinky Curly&#x27;s Knot Today Detangler is the Panthenol and Cetyl Alcohol.  </li>
      <li>Have stopped using it and gone back to my old product that detangles &amp; protects against damaging heating tools.</li>
      <li>So, i decided to apply some to my coarse, natural roots, I was wonderfully surprised to see my naturally coarse roots, tamed, moisturized, with defined curls.</li>
      <li>the other unfortunate blondies out there - natural, not bottle since I can&#x27;t speak to how this effects chemical color - this seems like something that would darken your natural haircolor, but my natural highlights are actually whiter than ever, and healthy to boot!  </li>
      <li>Took about 45 mins to dry my hair with a dryer, normally takes about 10 mins!&lt;br</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t tell you how much money I have spent on product for my daughter&#x27;s hair over the years, including $60 shampoo/conditioner from my stylist!</li>
      <li>it is never dry</li>
      <li>I put it on my hair dry and left my hair very soft and moisturized.  </li>
      <li>African american, natural, uncolored hair was dry and constantly knotting at the ends.&lt;br</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Detangles ok but leaves my hair greasy</li>
    <li> I have a combination of 3C and 4A hair.  I usually like Shea Moisture products.  I bought this one because I was looking for a good detangler and moisturizer for my hair.  I love the scent/fragrence of this detangler.  It moisturizes okay.  However, it does not really detangle my hair all that well.  I used to use Kinky Curly&#x27;s Knot Today leave in conditioner detangler, however with their recent forumla changes it doesn&#x27;t detangle my hair anymore either so that is why I decided to give this Shea Moisture Detangler a try.  It has similar key detangling ingredients that the Kinky Curly Knot Today detangler has, but the main ingredient that I can observe in the ingredients of both this Shea Moisture Detangler and Kinky Curly&#x27;s Knot Today Detangler is the Panthenol and Cetyl Alcohol.  Both of those ingredients from what I have observed in using detangling products takes away from the \\&quot;slip\\&quot; and \\&quot;slippery\\&quot; element/feel that is necessary for hair to be easily detangled.  It&#x27;s part of the new ingredients that were added to Kinky Curly&#x27;s Knot Today updated/new forumula, and I see that Shea Moisture has made the same mistake.  I&#x27;ll keep using this product until it runs out as it makes a nice oil based product to add to my hair for help with moisture.  But it doesn&#x27;t serve the purpose as a detangler which is disappointing.  I do like the fragrance though and for my hair to smell nice.</li>
    <li> It did add moisture to my hair but I did not get any de-tangling help from this at all. I would recommend this if you just want some nice moisture, but for moisture and detangling power, I recommend Kinky Curly Knot Today. Leaves my hair moisturized, tight 3c-4a curls defined, and the tangles MELT in my hand practically.</li>
    <li> This was way too greasy and heavy. It says that you can lave it in, but please do not! It will way the hair down. Use it as a conditioner and wash this product out! Or else...</li>
    <li> Makes your hair soft and manageable.  I have curly fine hair.  It goes on thick, but the next day your hair is soft and manageable.  I don&#x27;t like combing my hair too much, and using this product, my hair stays moist and shiny for days without adding anything.  I love it!</li>
    <li> Love it, perfect for my natural hair</li>
    <li> I bought this on eBay 2 for $18 free shipping!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THIS STUFF IS SILKENING!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have 4b low porosity hair that&#x27;s HARD to moisturize, I apply this on drenched/soaking wet hair &amp; it ABSORBS so well ,it makes detangling a breeze along with a lot of moisturization!</li>
    <li> If you are looking for a detangling moisturizer, this is IT!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My African american, natural, uncolored hair was dry and constantly knotting at the ends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I kept having to cut the end of my hair because of the fairy knots (tiny knots) and split ends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In an attempt to retain length I kept my braids in too long and my hair became matted. almost a dread lock in the middle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I thought I was going to have to cut my hair out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then I used this product. I was able to untangle my entire uncombed for a month hair in about 1/2 an hour.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now it is really thick. you can put it in your hand and turn it upside down and it wont fall to the ground.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; It also feels sticky. Like someone mixed honey and gel together.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I used it after I sprayed my hair with some water and when it dried it wasn&#x27;t sticky. I think the stickiness breaks down after exposure to the air or when mixed with water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know this bottle is pricey but a little bit goes a LONG way. It will probably outlast two other cheaper, watered down products.</li>
    <li> i didnt buy this from amazon, i bought this from the store. I followed the directions as it says and for some reason after a while, my hair became extremely dry and crinkly. Never again, such a waste of money.</li>
    <li> This stuff is awesome but you can get it at Walgreen for 11.99 the whole shea moisture raw shea butter line is great I used the raw shea butter conditioner with this for my wash and go my hair was defined soft and full of body I am natural  I have all hair types on my head and all of them loves the Shea moisture raw shea butter line</li>
    <li> I love all of the Shea moisture product and this is no different, it give me so much moisture and easy to detangle my hair and I&#x27;m mix with different race so I&#x27;m a woman of color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would ask for everyone to try it, you too will love it.</li>
    <li> I was surprised by this product. I purchased this product when my hair was fully relaxed, and did not like the result at all. I felt it was too heavy for my relaxed hair. However, I am five months post my last relaxer, and was searching for a product that would moisturize my hair without it becoming oily and without oil dripping down from my scalp- or ruining my sheets. I happened to watch someone&#x27;s video review of this product, who had ethnic, coarse, unrelaxed hair. She raved about this product. So, i decided to apply some to my coarse, natural roots, I was wonderfully surprised to see my naturally coarse roots, tamed, moisturized, with defined curls. This product does not leak on to my pillows or run down my neck, thank God! And the results are long lasting. I have found my key, go to moisturizer! For reference and comparison, my hair texture is 4b.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;October 12, 2013&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been going through a dry spell with my hair, where nothing seems to moisturize it.  Not even this product.  I don&#x27;t know if the product just doesn&#x27;t work for me anymore, or if it&#x27;s just something with my hair right now.  I will see how this product continues to work in my transitioning hair. I am over 6 months post my last relaxer. So we&#x27;ll see.</li>
    <li> I think I have 2b hair - about half red, half blonde - and I live in the desert.  I get massive amounts of split ends after just a couple of months and have to keep cutting my hair all the time.  I found this product at a CVS and I&#x27;m almost done with my first bottle seven months later - and I still don&#x27;t have enough split ends to merit a trim!  This is the only thing that I changed up since my last haircut so crediting it for the change seems reasonable.  If you have fine or limp hair this will probably leave your hair a little greasy - if I put too much in or don&#x27;t use a clarifying conditioner about once a week it will start to weigh it down a little.  I usually put about a nickel-sized dollop through my hair, focusing on the ends, and then twist the remaining water out.  Sometimes it looks a little greasy as it dries but if I let some sun hit it the greasiness gets absorbed.  The red in my hair is very course and I would definitely say that I have dry hair, and skin, in general.  So again, if you&#x27;re more on the oily side of things....you might not like this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the other unfortunate blondies out there - natural, not bottle since I can&#x27;t speak to how this effects chemical color - this seems like something that would darken your natural haircolor, but my natural highlights are actually whiter than ever, and healthy to boot!  I&#x27;m going to try the shampoo next I think....</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not often that I post reviews, but I have only used this once and it already blew my mind! I have a 3 year old half black daughter with thick tight curls that HATES to have her hair brushed every day (bribery required) and rubs her head on her pillow while she sleeps/naps so she gets some horribly messy and nappy knots/tangles. We live in colorado so keeping her hair moisturized is also a huge challenge. Her knots were getting so big and bad that I was worried I was going to have to cut them out, until someone recommended I try this! I used it on her last night and was able to pick apart the knots easier than ever! It made her hair soft and slippery and it didn&#x27;t feel dry and brittle like after most products I&#x27;ve tried. It has amazing slip! I used a little more than I probably needed to and thought her hair would actually be greasy in the morning but it wasn&#x27;t it was soft and glossy (in a good way). It also smells great too, like a tropical vacation! I am going to buy the shampoo and conditioner too! I can&#x27;t tell you how much money I have spent on product for my daughter&#x27;s hair over the years, including $60 shampoo/conditioner from my stylist! I think we have finally found a winner! Thank you!!</li>
    <li> I use this in place of conditioner. A little goes a long way. My hair stays moisturized, but never greasy. Love it.</li>
    <li> This concoction is natural and amazing.  It super-moisturizes my hair but completely absorbs.  I was worried it would make my hair greasy, but it just makes it amazing.  I have long, curly hair and this product tames it, adds shine, and makes it manageable without weighing it down.</li>
    <li> Its ok but sticky i use it while my hair is really wet.</li>
    <li> Finally, a detangler that works!  I have thick curly/wavey hair, and have always had bad tangles- this prevents a lot of hair loss during combing.  Texture is odd at first when you put it on, but after you comb it once, you can tell this is a great product!  No real smell to it which is nice too.</li>
    <li> My baby (14 mo.) has really thick, long, curly hair and I dread the weekly fight to comb and style her hair.  I&#x27;ve been using Shea Moisture products on her hair because it&#x27;s natural and has a nice long lasting scent.  I just used this particular product tonight, after realizing I ran out of her regular conditioner.  This product is absolutely UNREAL!! I cannot believe how easy it was to part and comb her hair with EASE.  She&#x27;s happy and so am I.</li>
    <li> Once I put this stuff on my hair, the tangles just melt.  Now I will say that when I put it on, my hair felt coated and and kind of yucky, but once it dries, my hair is so soft and moisturized.  I cannot keep my hands out of my hair.  I seriously love this stuff.</li>
    <li> Where has this been for the last few years that I have been growing my hair?! I love this stuff! I have fine, medium thickness, very wavy/curly caucasion hair and I have been avoiding this stuff for awhile now fearing that it will weigh my hair down. Boy was I sadly mistaken. I wash and condition my hair in the shower with shea moisture shampoo and conditioner, towel dry hair, and then put a good quarter sized amount of this stuff on the length of my armpit length hair starting at the tips working up towards about my ears. Then I use my &#x27;Wet Brush&#x27; to detangle (starting at the ends of course). After I&#x27;m done, and my hair dries, my roots are not greasy from brushing the product through my entire head of hair. It&#x27;s just moisturized with not build up. Also, as other reviewers have said you can get this stuff a lot cheaper at walgreens, CVS, and Target.</li>
    <li> Sorry, usually like Shea&#x27;s organic products (hence the 2 stars instead of 1) must have misread the description.&lt;br /&gt;Was looking for an organic detangler for my hair after shampoo &amp; conditioning, since i was ditching my old &#x27;sulphate&#x27; containing products,&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s what I found with this one:&lt;br /&gt;- Quite heavy and sticky on application&lt;br /&gt;- Took about 45 mins to dry my hair with a dryer, normally takes about 10 mins!&lt;br /&gt;- Have stopped using it and gone back to my old product that detangles &amp; protects against damaging heating tools.</li>
    <li> Great product for my fine 3C spiral curls.</li>
    <li> This has made bedtime much easier.  Combing my toddler&#x27;s hair was tears and misery until we got this.  Now with the tangles gone, the pick slides through his hair easily and he can actually concentrate on other things while I comb his hair.  The only reason this isn&#x27;t five stars is because of the scent.  I&#x27;m very sensitive to scents and it&#x27;s fairly strong.  Please, please, please make an unscented version and I&#x27;ll buy it in bulk.</li>
    <li> I am a stay at home my mom so i can&#x27;t buy a lot of products so i stick to 4 main products on a daily basis, this one, the shea moisture conditioner, grape seed oil and chi&#x27;s lily hair tonic. I use this product everyday ( just a little) after i leave my gym&#x27;s steam room. i wear two strand twist in my hair, so i go to the gym 4 to 5 times a week and the other days i don&#x27;t even have to moisturize i use this product, then the conditioner then the grape seed oil ( i use the conditioner and the lily hair tonic in the steam room) and i swear when i take my hair out every 5 to 6 days my hair doesn&#x27;t break off it is never dry ( i have low porosity hair hence the steam room) and it is easy to come out without losing a handful of hair, the only problem i see is the price on here, i go to my stores here and it only cost 11 or 12 dollars at most.</li>
    <li> I just purchased this product at my local CVS.  I put it on my hair dry and left my hair very soft and moisturized.  It looks like a dupe for Kinky Curly Knot Today.  I was expecting the same type of texture as the KCKT, however, when I felt the product it reminded me of petroleam jelly or vaseling.  I was hesitent at first but my strands loved it, and it didn&#x27;t leave a greasy residue.  My hair was butter, so soft and shiny.  Much better that the KCKT as that left a whitish dull residue on my hair after it dried.&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t used it right after a wash yet.  I will write an addendum when I do.</li>
    <li> This works great for curly hair, doesn&#x27;t leave any residue. I also mix it with water and have it in a spray bottle for quick frizz reducer.</li>
    <li> The best Shea Moisture product I&#x27;ve ever used. Most of their products make my 4a/4b/4c coils feel dry or have no effect at all, and were a complete waste of $10-15 each time. However, I came across this product on BOGO sale at Walgreen&#x27;s and decided to pick it up along with the African Black Soap Deep Conditioner. OMG is all I can say! This product makes my hair sooooo unbelievably soft, manageable and easier to finger detangle (even days past wash day). I&#x27;ll definitely buy this again.</li>
    <li> I spilled a little of the product although they tried to protect it with adhesive tape ....</li>
    <li> I purchased this today and it works great. Yes, it is thick and feels sticky however once applied to wet hair it absorbs and leaves your hair very soft. My 4a low porosity coils really reacted well to this product. Today was buy one get one half off at Walgreen&#x27;s, however, this price is ok for a great product with quality ingredients.</li>
    <li> I initially saw this detangler on a video.  I was using another similar leave-in detangler and while I really like it, this one is so much better.  It is a thick consistency, but it helps shape my curls and give it shine and bounce.  I use this after I wash my hair and before I put any other curl product.  Honestly, sometimes I&#x27;ve only used this and my hair still came out great!  I love Shea Moisture products and they work great with my super curly hair.</li>
    <li> This is the best moisturizer / detangler for the SUMMERTIME only....I find that Glycerin (the first ingredient) is better for summer, hot humid climates. Much better than Kinky Curly Knot Today. I have 3b / 3c low posterity hair. I don&#x27;t consider this light weight through so people with thinner hair might be weighted down from this. But if you are looking for moisture, than this is it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve heard a few youtubers with natural, curly hair recommend this before, and when I couldn&#x27;t find my staple Kinky Curly Knot Today at CVS, I just picked this up. It was about $12, so it is kinda overpriced on here. But it definitely did the job. It was kinda thick, which I didn&#x27;t like since my hair is easily weighed down, so I added some water to it, which did the trick. It moisturizes my hair wonderfully, as well as detangles it. My curls hella pop when I use it! I seriously recommend this!</li>
    <li> Unfortunately, this product does not work for me. I&#x27;ve used it several times after shampooing and conditioning with other products in the line (which I love overall), but it just dries out my 4a/b hair. My quest continues.</li>
    <li> This is a great leave-in conditioner. I mainly use it on dry hair, primarily because I just wash it a couple times a week. I put a little dab on my hand, rub my palms together and rub this through, repeating if I want more moisture. I&#x27;m caucasian with fine wavy/frizzy hair that is super dry. (As in, I could probably go two weeks without washing it if I used no product and it would still be dry.) Shea Moisture&#x27;s products, especially the shea butter line, has been a godsend. Without the shampoo and conditioner and now this, I swear I would have shaved my head by now and just given up. This keeps the frizz and the dry breakoffs at bay, and gives it some life.</li>
