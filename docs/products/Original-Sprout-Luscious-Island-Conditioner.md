      <li>It has a wonderful scent, leaves my hair silky and tangle free.  </li>
      <li>Great conditioner, I love coconut and all</li>
      <li>I love this brand of products and this conditioner smells so good</li>
      <li>but I can smell my hair when I&#x27;m in the sun or in the car on a warm day</li>
      <li>I love this conditioner and shampoo.</li>
      <li>My favorite along with the shampoo.</li>
      <li>As a conditioner it worked okay,</li>
      <li>this is one of the best ones i have tried, it actually conditions instead of feeling like it all rinsed out of my hair, not tangles with this.</li>
      <li>I love the smell</li>
      <li>Scent aside, it&#x27;s a fairly rich conditioner, but I would have to say it&#x27;s not as effective at smoothing my somewhat coarse/prone to frizz hair as some others I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
      <li>That&#x27;s what we bought it for great scent and very very very child friendly.  </li>
      <li>Best conditioner ever-smells great and leaves hair extra soft.</li>
      <li>I love using free and clean products because then I am not harming my hair and body!</li>
      <li>This is a great natural conditioner.</li>
      <li>I was using the Original Sprouts&#x27; leave-in conditioner for my toddler, but this product works better on his hair.</li>
      <li>smells great, but no big difference in my curly, at times frizzy, hair...</li>
      <li>Does a great job at adding moisture to my hair without making it oily and helps my hair actually look thicker.</li>
      <li>Very pleased with this and will be ordering more in the future!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very moisturizing, The cost is better on Amazon that their website.</li>
      <li>I have really long hair and needed a good conditioner.</li>
      <li>I am extremely sensitive to gluten, and finding gluten free personal products that compare with popular brands is not always easy.  </li>
      <li>I have made the switched to chemical free all natural products.</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t really describe the scent...</li>
      <li>This conditioner is one I would highly recommend for ANYONE, regardless of gluten issues.  </li>
      <li>Left my hair soft and silky easy to manage without using any other products.</li>
      <li>WOW.  </li>
      <li>Leaves my problem hair soft and manageable.</li>
      <li>A tube goes a long way, as you don&#x27;t need much!  </li>
      <li>It will make your hair feel silky and soft without adding weight.</li>
      <li>Also, the product is leaving a residue near my scalp even though I only focus the application on my ends.</li>

<li> i am trying to get away from synthetics, which is hard.</li>
<li> What a letdown. :(</li>
<li> but my hair feels disgusting and straw-like.</li>

    <li> I am extremely sensitive to gluten, and finding gluten free personal products that compare with popular brands is not always easy.  This conditioner is one I would highly recommend for ANYONE, regardless of gluten issues.  It has a wonderful scent, leaves my hair silky and tangle free.  A tube goes a long way, as you don&#x27;t need much!  It&#x27;s an excellent value from every perspective!</li>
    <li> smells good but makes my head break out like crazy :(</li>
    <li> My favorite along with the shampoo. Leaves my problem hair soft and manageable.</li>
    <li> Amazing conditioner! It will make your hair feel silky and soft without adding weight. I will definitely purchase this again.</li>
    <li> This is a great natural conditioner. Does a great job at adding moisture to my hair without making it oily and helps my hair actually look thicker.</li>
    <li> That&#x27;s what we bought it for great scent and very very very child friendly.  Great price for what you get.</li>
    <li> WOW.  Doesn&#x27;t take away the curl but keeps the frizz at bay.  My granddaughter loves it!!!</li>
    <li> this conditioner works well. i am trying to get away from synthetics, which is hard. this is one of the best ones i have tried, it actually conditions instead of feeling like it all rinsed out of my hair, not tangles with this.</li>
    <li> This is awesome conditioner, works great and smells so good.</li>
    <li> this is a great product that I grabbed just on product loyalty.&lt;br /&gt;smells great and is a great detangler as well</li>
    <li> I tried this after getting a sample of the Tahitian hair oil.  As a conditioner it worked okay, but I was so sad it didn&#x27;t smell the same as the oil.  What a letdown. :(</li>
    <li> I have really long hair and needed a good conditioner. I have made the switched to chemical free all natural products. Sprout conditioner leaves hair manageable and smells good.</li>
    <li> Thought it was great! Smelled great and worked great!</li>
    <li> I love this conditioner and shampoo. It&#x27;s very moisturizing, The cost is better on Amazon that their website.</li>
    <li> Over priced and does not make hair fuller.</li>
    <li> I love this brand of products and this conditioner smells so good, I feel like I&#x27;m on vacation everyday! I was using the Original Sprouts&#x27; leave-in conditioner for my toddler, but this product works better on his hair. He doesn&#x27;t like his hair to be brushed or combed and his hair is knotted when he wakes up in the mornings, but this conditioner helps a lot.</li>
    <li> I love the smell but my hair feels disgusting and straw-like. Also, the product is leaving a residue near my scalp even though I only focus the application on my ends. Overall I am left feeling like my hair is starting to look like Amanda Bynes&#x27; wig.</li>
    <li> If you want a conditioner without all the garbage this is it! Left my hair soft and silky easy to manage without using any other products. Very pleased with this and will be ordering more in the future!</li>
    <li> I love using free and clean products because then I am not harming my hair and body! This stuff conditions well and doesn&#x27;t leave my hair gross! Will be buying again!</li>
    <li> Great conditioner, I love coconut and all but the smell is a bit obnoxious if I don&#x27;t like smelling like you are on vacation everyday...</li>
    <li> Best conditioner ever-smells great and leaves hair extra soft.</li>
    <li> smells great, but no big difference in my curly, at times frizzy, hair...</li>
    <li> This stuff smells so yummy I almost (almost!) don&#x27;t care if it actually works! I can&#x27;t really describe the scent...but I can smell my hair when I&#x27;m in the sun or in the car on a warm day and it&#x27;s delightful. Scent aside, it&#x27;s a fairly rich conditioner, but I would have to say it&#x27;s not as effective at smoothing my somewhat coarse/prone to frizz hair as some others I&#x27;ve tried. I do use the Luscious Island oil too, which helps. This is a pricey product so I may start interspersing it with other brands, but I can&#x27;t give it up!</li>
    <li> No chemicals and wonderful fragrance ! Awesome conditioner!</li>
