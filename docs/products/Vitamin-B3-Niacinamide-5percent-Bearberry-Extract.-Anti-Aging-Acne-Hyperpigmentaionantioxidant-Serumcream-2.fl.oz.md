      <li>Super results.  </li>
      <li>Package arrived quickly.</li>
      <li>My boyfriend bought this for me a week ago after I saw that the Dr. Oz show talked about B3 and Bearberry being good for wrinkles and dark spots.</li>
      <li>I was searching for a new light lotion.</li>
      <li>The overall skin tone is healthy, without being shinny.  </li>
      <li>The &amp;#34;bags&amp;#34; are smaller and more toned.</li>
      <li>Thanks for the prompt service!</li>
      <li>it really is a wrinkle reducer!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been applying in certain areas where I have acne scars.</li>
      <li>It is a shame, because I really like the product</li>
      <li>don&#x27;t see much of a difference.</li>
      <li>Those expression lines around my mouth are much softer and almost gone.  </li>
      <li>But I really like the cream</li>
      <li>I have  Tried many other products.</li>
      <li>It is light but moisturing and my wrinkles and fine lines are slowly disappearing.</li>
      <li>She&#x27;s used it a few times, so I&#x27;m not quite sure if it&#x27;s really made a difference yet.</li>
      <li>I watched Dr. Oz and he highly recommends Niacinamide B3 cream for wrinkles, age spots and acne.  </li>
      <li>I highly recommend this product....</li>
      <li>/&gt;so far &amp; would recommend it to anyone who wants to take care of their skin,</li>
      <li>So far I haven&#x27;t seen much difference in my skin</li>
      <li>I love that they offer a small 1.oz jar for $18.95</li>
      <li>and it has lightened the circles and my fine lines are less noticeable.</li>
      <li>The age spots are exactly the same.</li>
      <li>on smooth and absorbs quickly.&lt;br /&gt;Haven&#x27;t used it long enough to supply benefits to face.</li>
      <li>wow.  </li>
      <li>I am 50 years old</li>
      <li>I bought this for my 17 year old daughter who has some acne scars on her face.</li>
      <li>But it does seem to benefit my skin so far.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for nearly 2 weeks</li>
      <li>I give this product 4 stars, but I paid $18.95 for my first order, same product same merchant.</li>
      <li>I have not noticed much difference on my entire face, but I have noticed a big difference on my lower eyes.</li>
      <li>I have used the expensive creams, lasers, potions and lotions, and my skin looks better now after using this product than it has in 25 years!  </li>
      <li>I have been struggling on and off with acne for the past ten years and as a teen, I&#x27;ve tried so many products to try and lighten the scars</li>
      <li>Within 1 week, my acne scars I&#x27;ve had for years were barely noticeable.  </li>
      <li>But I must also note that at the same time I started to use this product I also started to take Neocell Super Powder Collagen type 1 and 3, a few times a week.  </li>
      <li>I noticed a new softness within the first 2 weeks, then the smoothing effect slowly began appearing.  </li>

<li> She probably needs to use it consistently, but getting a 17 year old to be consistent is tough!!</li>
<li> BECAUSE I HAVE NOT USED IT LONG ENOUGH.  </li>
<li> I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to know if it will do what I want</li>
<li> I apply at night just under my eyes since I have incredibly dry skin there</li>
<li> It only takes less than a pea size to cover all of my spots.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve used this product for almost 2 months, applying 2x daily on face, neck, chest - and do see a slight improvement to my skin texture.  </li>
<li> I began using it three days ago, and my skin looks smoother, is softer, my dark spots and scars are fading away</li>
<li> and there is no change in my dark spots.</li>
<li> I put it on morning and night, and no more dry patches for me!</li>
<li> I was shocked at the price and little really goes a long way with this product.</li>
<li> Not a huge difference</li>
<li> I can see results on his face after just a few days!  </li>
<li> so you can test out first before you buy this 2.oz jar, but trust me you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
<li> I am starting to think these reviews are fake.</li>
<li> and it does not smell stinky like some products I have used in the past.</li>
<li> So far, I can say, that it has &amp;#34;helped&amp;#34; to heal some of my nasty recent hyper-pigmentation and acne scars.</li>
<li> Of course, I was a little wary, but for the price...</li>
<li> Just after one use of it..my skin turned from a dull winter face to a radiant one!</li>
<li> Also, I have very delicate skin.</li>
<li> not happy at all boo hoo</li>
<li> Sad product.</li>
<li> and it doesn&#x27;t smell bad.</li>
<li> but i haven&#x27;t seen any results... :(</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I&#x27;m loving this product so far. I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to know if it will do what I want but I do like how it goes on my face and it doesn&#x27;t smell bad. It soaks into the skin nicely. Thanks for the prompt service!</li>
    <li> I have used the expensive creams, lasers, potions and lotions, and my skin looks better now after using this product than it has in 25 years!  I now do not have to even wear foundation makeup, just a touch of concealer and powder and I am out the door.  You have to try this!!  Super results.  I&#x27;m stocking up on more right now!</li>
    <li> I am giving it 4 star for now because I have to see if it helps with dark/brown spots or not. I will amend my rating once improvement is see. But I really like the cream so far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Liliam.. $18.95 price is for the 1oz bottle. You are getting 2 ozs for $32 price tag.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my 17 year old daughter who has some acne scars on her face. She&#x27;s used it a few times, so I&#x27;m not quite sure if it&#x27;s really made a difference yet. She probably needs to use it consistently, but getting a 17 year old to be consistent is tough!!</li>
    <li> So far I haven&#x27;t seen much difference in my skin maybe it will take more time I did order 2 bottles</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for almost 2 months, applying 2x daily on face, neck, chest - and do see a slight improvement to my skin texture.  I noticed a new softness within the first 2 weeks, then the smoothing effect slowly began appearing.  I accept that this type of skin treatment is a nourishing, renewing process so don&#x27;t expect overnight wow.  Will continue with it.  Package arrived quickly.</li>
    <li> Although I&#x27;ve only been using this product for 2 weeks, I already see a difference in the lines on my face and even those \\&quot;sleep creases\\&quot; on my chest. Also taking Collagen-C tablets with niacinamide, so that could be one reason it&#x27;s so effective. So far, so good!</li>
    <li> found this product to be true to it&#x27;s description, liked the effects it has produce&lt;br /&gt;so far &amp; would recommend it to anyone who wants to take care of their skin,</li>
    <li> I watched Dr. Oz and he highly recommends Niacinamide B3 cream for wrinkles, age spots and acne.  I just received the cream about 3 days ago SO I CAN NOT GIVE A REVIEW YET BECAUSE I HAVE NOT USED IT LONG ENOUGH.  BUT I WAS READING THE REVIEWS AND IT HAS GOOD REVIEWS WRITTEN ON IT.</li>
    <li> Nastiness...had this for about a month and it discolored and got a foul smell. Did nothing to get rid of pigment issues on my face.</li>
    <li> Love it! It is light but moisturing and my wrinkles and fine lines are slowly disappearing. Will definitely purchase this cream again. This product does many things... Moisturizes, fades spotty complexion, tightens skin.. All around, I have recommended this product to all my friends. I have  Tried many other products. This is the best for wrinkles. Also, I have very delicate skin. Breakout very easily. No problem with this product.</li>
    <li> My boyfriend bought this for me a week ago after I saw that the Dr. Oz show talked about B3 and Bearberry being good for wrinkles and dark spots. I love that they offer a small 1.oz jar for $18.95 so you can test out first before you buy this 2.oz jar, but trust me you won&#x27;t be disappointed.I have been struggling on and off with acne for the past ten years and as a teen, I&#x27;ve tried so many products to try and lighten the scars but I never got the results I wanted. This moisturizer is meant for all over your face but I only use it as a spot treatment for my problem areas and I have to say, it&#x27;s worked amazingly. Within 1 week, my acne scars I&#x27;ve had for years were barely noticeable.  I will be ordering this 2.oz bottle next . It only takes less than a pea size to cover all of my spots. I apply at night just under my eyes since I have incredibly dry skin there and it has lightened the circles and my fine lines are less noticeable. I&#x27;ve been applying in certain areas where I have acne scars. Its a great, inexpensive product! I love how silky this creamy serum is and it does not smell stinky like some products I have used in the past. I will not be without this one. Worth every penny!</li>
    <li> I chose this because it had good reviews but i haven&#x27;t seen any results... :( not happy at all boo hoo</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s too soon to tell how well this will work; it&#x27;s a cumulative process.  But it does seem to benefit my skin so far.</li>
    <li> I waited the full 4 weeks to use this product before giving my opinion. I have not noticed much difference on my entire face, but I have noticed a big difference on my lower eyes. The &amp;#34;bags&amp;#34; are smaller and more toned. Not a huge difference but it has only been one skin cycle of 28 days. My eye lashes are thicker and longer as well as my eye brows. I will continue to use this product for another month before I purchase again. I use this product every am and pm. I have noticed no difference in my neck skin. I am 50 years old and I have always taken care of my skin. But I must also note that at the same time I started to use this product I also started to take Neocell Super Powder Collagen type 1 and 3, a few times a week.  I will update next month.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know what has been so good about this product. I brought this product based on reviews, like a dummy! I am starting to think these reviews are fake. I have been applying this product for almost 3 wks now, day/night and there is no change in my dark spots. I would not recommend it at all. If something changes, i will than update my review, til than, 1 star!&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> This product was lost in the mail.  I contacted the supplier and they immediately reshipped.  I received the replacement within two days.  Excellent customer service.  I haven&#x27;t seen big changes yet but I do think that my skin is tighter in good way.  Only time well tell.</li>
    <li> I bought this product after seeing the Dr. Oz endorsement.  Of course, I was a little wary, but for the price... I thought why not.  I&#x27;ve been using it for nearly 2 weeks and I can&#x27;t believe the difference.  Those expression lines around my mouth are much softer and almost gone.  It&#x27;s made my face feel/look fuller with reduced pores around my nose.  The overall skin tone is healthy, without being shinny.  I wear it under my morning moisturizer and under my makeup.  I also put it on before bed.  It works so well that I&#x27;ve started sharing it with my husband.  I can see results on his face after just a few days!  I highly recommend this product.... it really is a wrinkle reducer!</li>
    <li> After 3 weeks I see no difference in my skin. The age spots are exactly the same. I realize that it takes time so I will continue to use and finish the bottle. Hopefully I will see some improvement.maybe some plumping, to improve the fine lines. Sincerely, Pat</li>
    <li> I use this every day before using moisturizers.&lt;br /&gt;Goes on smooth and absorbs quickly.&lt;br /&gt;Haven&#x27;t used it long enough to supply benefits to face.</li>
    <li> Just after one use of it..my skin turned from a dull winter face to a radiant one! I was searching for a new light lotion. I was shocked at the price and little really goes a long way with this product. When I got home, I washed off all my make-up and put this cream on. It felt absolutely amazing. I have very oily/dry patch acne prone skin, but surprisingly this has not made me break-out at all. I seen an immediate improvement in my skin just after one use! I put it on morning and night, and no more dry patches for me! It has been great for winter weather . So far, I can say, that it has &amp;#34;helped&amp;#34; to heal some of my nasty recent hyper-pigmentation and acne scars.</li>
    <li> I give this product 4 stars, but I paid $18.95 for my first order, same product same merchant. The price is now $32.  This does not make sense. I will look for similar from different company.  It is a shame, because I really like the product but I feel the merchant is taking the customers  for granted.</li>
    <li> My mom ordered this for me to see if it would help my acne. Surprisingly this has helped my acne! I began using it three days ago, and my skin looks smoother, is softer, my dark spots and scars are fading away and I am not breaking out! I recommend this to everyone! It&#x27;s amazing!</li>
    <li> I saw the product advertised on the Dr. Oz show and after conducting some research I decided to try it.  I also purchased this product along with Phytoceramides w/lipowheat and collegan2.  I have seen a difference in my skin but can&#x27;t say if it is just one product or a combination of all three.  Satisfied with the results.</li>
    <li> learned about this on Dr Oz. Sad product. Would never buy it again. My face broke out like a teenager.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using it, day and nite, exfoliating etc. don&#x27;t see much of a difference. Don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll be purchasing it again. I will give it another 3 weeks, because some shin types take longer then others to respond to products. I&#x27;ve also been in the beauty industry for 35 years and have always taking care of my skin. In other words I&#x27;ve use great products and don&#x27;t look my age but nothing is getting rid of these spots....................stay tune.......</li>
