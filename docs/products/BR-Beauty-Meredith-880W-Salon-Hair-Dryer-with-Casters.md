      <li>ON TOP OF THAT</li>
      <li>Yes, you need to have room for the dryer, but if you do, you&#x27;ll love it.</li>
      <li>I love this dryer.  </li>
      <li>Note: when assemblying the castor arms, you need to screw the castors into one end of the arms, but they won&#x27;t tighten more than 2 or 3 rotations, which is fine.</li>
      <li>I really did have a good experience with the dryer.</li>
      <li>I quick trip to the hardware store to buy some better fitting screws seemed to do the trick nicely.&lt;br /&gt;Other</li>
      <li>, coasters are convent and easily moves where you want it.  </li>
      <li>It is adjustable and easy to get in and out of.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s easy to assemble and easy to move around.  </li>
      <li>This dryer was easy to assemble and I am not at all mechanically inclined.  </li>
      <li>It is also easy to put together</li>
      <li>This was easy to assemble.</li>
      <li>Even distribution of air and easy to adjust.</li>
      <li>Quality made and easy assemble.</li>
      <li>I bought this item from 2012 and it is still going strong.</li>
      <li>But the dryer hood works fine</li>
      <li>the timer has a slight ticking sound, and the bell rings when time is up awesome</li>
      <li>After I put it together the adjustable rod didn&#x27;t move up and down as smoothly as I would have liked but for the price everything was great.</li>
      <li>There was no air flow, no power light-</li>
      <li>Enjoy your dryer...</li>
      <li>head, knobs feel cheap also</li>
      <li>They&#x27;re still secure.</li>
      <li>Now I am comfortable drying my hair while I sit in a chair opposed to trying to hold the table dryer up</li>
      <li>Yes, I could have purchased a cheaper dryer and even got free shipping</li>
      <li>Overall a great product</li>
      <li>They were fantastic and very helpful!!!</li>
      <li>It is also very spacious I was able to comfortably sit under with my two packs (140)</li>
      <li>It is quite large so make sure you have the space to store it if you do purchase it.</li>
      <li>I am a spa owner and i purchased this dryer for my establishment,it works great has an excellent hood, i prefer a base with 5 legs rather than 4 but other than that its works great has a quiet cycle and the temperature is great.....</li>
      <li>heats very well, doesn&#x27;t make noise, comfortable to sit under and easy to move around</li>
      <li>Once the plastic tabs are removed, the holes in the arms will align with the holes in the metal plate (you&#x27;ll see what I mean) perfectly.</li>
      <li>Now I sit under my salon dryer with a book or magazine and enjoy my hair drying experience far more.  </li>
      <li>It got here super fast too!!</li>
      <li>very efficient and easy to use.</li>
      <li>thank you so much!!,,</li>
      <li>Although I had some trouble assembling the stand for the dryer, the dryer itself works great.</li>
      <li>The dryer looks and feels so professional, and I love walking by it in my home because of how it looks.</li>
      <li>Worth the investment.  </li>
      <li>It is well worth the money.</li>
      <li>It was worth every penny.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I absolutely love this dryer.  I am AA and I do a very good job at doing my own hair. I have longer than shoulder length hair and it dries my hair in 45 minutes or less.  The timer does tick but I am usually reading and can&#x27;t even hear it. Now I am comfortable drying my hair while I sit in a chair opposed to trying to hold the table dryer up high enough so my neck doesn&#x27;t hurt.</li>
    <li> This dryer is wonderful it is even better than I expected&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
    <li> Great product ! The only bad thing was that the wheels didn&#x27;t fit .</li>
    <li> This dryer is so convenient. I work at my desktop doing drying time. Worth the investment.  Other reviewers say that it dries hair quickly and it does.</li>
    <li> Even when a small problem arose, customer service was so accommodating. Very nice dryer. Excellent customer service and very prompt responses.</li>
    <li> I am very happy with the dryer so far. It fits in the limited space I have in my salon. I love the way the controls work and I was very surprised how much heat it generates. I am very pleased that it works on a 110 plug as opposed to a 220. I do feel that this is one thing you need to add in the description of this item. I almost did not purchase it because I did not know this piece of information.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been drying my hair with a hand-held dryer and diffuser and circular brush for a half-hour every morning.  Now I sit under my salon dryer with a book or magazine and enjoy my hair drying experience far more.  It&#x27;s easy to assemble and easy to move around.  This product is very reasonably priced for what it delivers - adjustable temperature, timer, adjustable height and a satisfactory result.</li>
    <li> I am a pro and wanted one to use at home. Has many different temp and blower settings and looks super. It is also easy to put together so yay.</li>
    <li> This is a great product for the price. It was very easy to put together too. I would order it again.</li>
    <li> This hair dryer works great and the cost is affordable.  I like to put my hair in rollers and as a result, the hand held dryer will not work for me.</li>
    <li> this is a great product! very efficient and easy to use.</li>
    <li> I needed a dryer to process permanent color faster (spritz inside of processing cap with water, cover hair completely with cap, set heat to med with low airflow for 20 mins, water turns to steam, reds are WAY more vivid, gray is completely covered, hair turns out glossy and moisturized) and to dry wavy extensions with low heat. My salon is attached to my home and I have a small clientele so I didn&#x27;t want to spend a lot of money. This dryer is powerful enough without blowing a breaker and has lots of temp settings with a high/low airflow setting. This dryer does \\&quot;blow\\&quot;, obviously, so if you don&#x27;t want to wear a net while drying a roller set, use an infrared orbiting processor that works without a fan.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this dryer. It&#x27;s on wheels so I can dry at home in any room, it&#x27;s quick drying, makes very little noise so it doesn&#x27;t disturb my family. I get the perfect roller set</li>
    <li> 1 year and still works great!  Excellent buy</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s been almost a year with this dryer and it is still working like new. I use it once a week for about an hour each time. It is also very spacious I was able to comfortably sit under with my two packs (140) curlformers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In my opinion it is not very noisy I usually have on my headsets watching a movie and am never disturbed by it. If you can&#x27;t afford a pibbs or don&#x27;t want to invest so much in just a dryer I would definitely recommend this one. It was a breeze to put together and not at all complicated to use.</li>
    <li> I bought this dryer because I wanted to deep condition my hair and also do roller sets (for reference I have hair to my tail bone with curly 3c type texture). Anyways… This dryer didnt even work!! I opened the package and all the parts were there. I put it together according to the instructions…. but then when I plugged it in and turned it on, NOTHING happened. The timer worked (it sounds like a cooking timer), but nothing else did. There was no air flow, no power light- NOTHING!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will be returning this, but I am yet to hear from the seller (this just happened today). I will come back on here to write an update and let you ladies know how/if they resolve the issue. I expect I will have to pay return shipping- but thats not fair given that I was shipped a defective item! (If I do- I will leave negative feedback).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall the appearance of this dryer was &amp;#34;cheap&amp;#34;. The stickers surrounding the dials were peeling off once I opened the box, and the dryer hood wasn&#x27;t very sturdy on the pole. Don&#x27;t get me wrong- I wasn&#x27;t expecting this to be a &amp;#34;Mr. Pibbs&amp;#34; by any means, but good grief- I at least expected it to turn on!! I must&#x27;ve gotten a bad dryer b/c the other reviews on here are decent (hence my deciding to purchase one). But ladies take my advice…. if you want a &amp;#34;risk free&amp;#34; piece of equipment then just save up and get a Mr. Pibbs. Otherwise you run the risk of being in my situation with a bum dryer and the possibility of having to pay return.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m glad I bought this. heats very well, doesn&#x27;t make noise, comfortable to sit under and easy to move around</li>
    <li> Excellent customer service and products....thank you so much!!,,</li>
    <li> The stand might be the only ineffective part. I am still having a hard time screwing in the wheels to the stand as I feel they are not compatible. I cant tell you how the rest works because I am still having issues with the stand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Okay so I finally fixed the wheels (\\&quot;my way\\&quot;) and was able to use it with no difficulty. The product worked very well and heats well. I would recommend if this is a starter dryer for someone.</li>
    <li> What I really hate is the strong bell when the timer is over..right in your ears, not fun at all.</li>
    <li> Very prompt delivery. Fed ex, works better than I thought it would. Got a little help with the assembling, but still pretty easy. Only thing I would say is the ding when the timer is loud, it went off scared the h*** out of me the first time I heard it. I dropped my remote and jumped up. Don&#x27;t know what I was thinking. Guess I must of thought it was a fire alarm. Lol. Should of been on funniest home video.  So now I just try not to let it ding, by setting it for extra time and manually turning it off. But great product.</li>
    <li> I recommend it ,is a very good product.i only work with the best ,it worth the money ,I&#x27;m going to buy three more.</li>
    <li> Turned out to be an awesome product and delivery. Use it everyday!</li>
    <li> I am a spa owner and i purchased this dryer for my establishment,it works great has an excellent hood, i prefer a base with 5 legs rather than 4 but other than that its works great has a quiet cycle and the temperature is great.....its perfectfor salon use and has an attractive look,i contacted the seller with a small issue i had and they offered an apology and discount which i believe is a plus....would definitely purchase more items from this seller because the customer service was great....i advise anyone to do buisiness with them</li>
    <li> I bought this item from 2012 and it is still going strong. It is well worth the money. The only downside to it is that just before the timer goes off, you gotta get up from underneath it because it has a loud sound when the time runs out.</li>
    <li> Got this for my mother in law and she loves it.</li>
    <li> When it arrived I had to call the sender to ask some questions about putting it together. They were fantastic and very helpful!!! My new dryer is wonderful!!!!</li>
    <li> My wife loved! The first shipment was defective bu a soon we call they send me a new one ..perfect fit and high.. No complaints. Great! I recomende 100%</li>
    <li> love it! very good quality for the price / easy to assemble/ the temperature levels are great dries quickly/ silent makes no loud sounds except for the timer button when ready is very loud . over all a great dryer to have at home with salon quality .</li>
    <li> My wife picked this out for Christmas. Easy enough to assemble, 5 screws and a bolt. My wife loves the dryer hood method and says it works great, dries her hair in a lot less time, very powerful with variable fan speed and heat temps, no more achy arms holding a hand held hair dryer, can read, work on computer for self or for work while drying hair. However the stand had some flaws, the knob you tighten to adjust the height of the dryer fell out because the plastic casing around the top of the bottom pole shattered around the hole due to being plastic (that looks like metal) and was unable screw the knob back in to adjust the hight. Called the company and they promptly sent, in 2 days, a replacement bottom pole, all I had to was remove the bolt to replace. Then I could not get the top pole to go down into the new bottom pole. Found some thick plastic blocking the hole, was wedged around the spring mechanism (packing material not removed at factory??) and was unable remove the plastic. Called the company again, sent some pics and with no hassle they promptly sent another pole, arrived in 2 days. Now the adjustable pole works fine, except you have to really tighten the knob hard to avoid the pole from slipping up, my wife has difficulty turning it tight enough. But the dryer hood works fine (although you have to be careful moving it, it makes the unit top heavy) and my wife loves it! Great company to deal with, they were friendly, called me back in less then a half hour when the very helpful customer service rep was not at her desk and handled the problem in less then a half hour with a call back that a new pole would be sent the next morning, it was too late in the afternoon to send it that day, or they would have. My wife recommends it highly. I do too since the company handled the problems with great speed and it was easy to assemble. However they should look into the design of the pole, maybe use metal instead of plastic would have solved the first problem. It wasa great value too.</li>
    <li> You can&#x27;t use this dryer without a net or curlers. Will not dry natural hair styles because it sucks air from the bottom through the top and if your hair isn&#x27;t kept down the fan will suck it upwards? And yes the dingger is loud.</li>
    <li> As a professional cosmetologist I have been looking for a dryer for home use. I did my homework and lots of research and decided on the Meredith dryer. It was worth every penny. Quality made and easy assemble. Even distribution of air and easy to adjust. I would have this in my salon. Yes, I could have purchased a cheaper dryer and even got free shipping but I feel this dryer will outlast most other dryers I looked at. Item arrived in 3 days of purchased which shocked me because I thought it would be atleast a week to 10 days. Very happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> This item is wonderful. I have dried my own hair, dried my wigs, and did a deep conditioning in this dryer. It is very powerful and not loud. It is adjustable and easy to get in and out of. If you are fond of doing your own hair. Get this dryer. Its a steal for the price.</li>
    <li> I got tired of paying $50 per week to get my hair washed, so I decided to do it myself and purchase a dryer.  Of course,this dryer is not going to have the same power as the one at the salon, but it does the job.  The only thing I didn&#x27;t like was the wheels were so hard to place into the unit.  I had to get someone to help me hammer the wheels in because the holes were too small.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a dryer that wasn&#x27;t a tabletop disaster, yet one the gives the same results as the one at the salon. This dryer does it for you, all I can say it works very well. I have had it a fer months and it as not been a disappointment.</li>
    <li> Excellent dryer easy to put together, controls are awesome,all you need is one tool included with the dryer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Roy, Woodbridge, VA</li>
    <li> The dryer is quiet and calm running, the bonnet is is just the right fit with or without rollers . it has a nice handsome look.  It is sturdy and strong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great temper control the timer has a slight ticking sound, and the bell rings when time is up awesome, coasters are convent and easily moves where you want it.  Perfect for a home beauty aid. Would recommend to all looking for a home style salon look.</li>
    <li> this does what you think it will, dries hair. My wife likes it and she and her sisters use it all the time.</li>
    <li> This product is just amazing! I love the fact that I can set the temperature, timer, adjust the height, and most importantly do my hair in any room, in the comfort of my own home all while achieving the look of having been to the salon! I hope to enjoy it for years to come!</li>
    <li> I love this dryer.  It is convenient and can go anywhere in my home.  I recommend this product for those who like convenience.</li>
    <li> This was easy to assemble. It feels sturdy. Everything works as it should. The only drawback is that all the air blows from the top, not the sides, so my hair dries unevenly. Also, the hood is rather long and skinny, so there isn&#x27;t much room to move or use curlers, if you ever wanted to.</li>
    <li> BEWARE  PRODUCT CAME INCOMPLETE. LOOKED LIKE SOMEONE  ELS  RETURNED THIS CRAP. THEY CHARGE ME A 20% RESTOCKING FEE. ON TOP OF THAT IT COAST ME $33.06 TO SHIP IT BACK I GOT $92.00 BACK YOU DO THE MATH. IM PISSED</li>
    <li> The dryer works great. Bought this as a present for my wife. Had a rough time assembling it b/c the screws supplied didn&#x27;t fit or screw nicely in the holes provided for the base. I quick trip to the hardware store to buy some better fitting screws seemed to do the trick nicely.&lt;br /&gt;Other than that everything was as expected.</li>
    <li> This is for my personal use and I recommended to everyone. Its worst the money because you save time and it quickly dry your hair and you don&#x27;t have to spend so much time under it. My old dryer (regular dryer) I will spent 2 hours in it so my hair could be completely dry. Not a lot of noise and you don&#x27;t feel like burning up under there. So I completely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Just got my dryer last night!!! I immediately asked my husband to assemble it and he was done in about 15 minutes... he did not have any of the assembly issues that were mentioned in previous reviews. I haven&#x27;t actually used the dryer yet but I hooked it up played with the settings and I just KNOW I am going to be the happiest girl ever! It got here super fast too!! I ordered it Friday and it got here the following Monday :) If I come into any issued I will add to this review but I do not anticipate that happening!!</li>
    <li> The top doesn&#x27;t move that well so it&#x27;s a little crazy trying to get it adjusted on your clients head, knobs feel cheap also</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s nice. I usually use it for deep conditions or if i&#x27;m doing dreads on someone else I will put them under when I&#x27;m done re-twisting. It&#x27;s handy to have in the house for situations like that. I&#x27;ve never had issues with it and I&#x27;ve had it about 5 months. I wish I had time to use it for different styles on myself but i&#x27;m sure it would work for a plethora of different things.</li>
    <li> I received this last week and I love it. The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it five stars is because assembling it was a little more time consuming than I anticipated. After I put it together the adjustable rod didn&#x27;t move up and down as smoothly as I would have liked but for the price everything was great. I would recommend this to anyone who is looking for a dryer. It gets hot enough and it is very quiet compared to most hair dryers that I have had in the past which is a plus. It is quite large so make sure you have the space to store it if you do purchase it. Overall a great product and I&#x27;m very happy with it!</li>
    <li> Motor went out after only a couple uses.</li>
    <li> Good dryer worked fine. I had this dryer for about 2 years. Only downside is that the timer knob broke and the dryer won&#x27;t work with out it. I would purchase again tho. For the money it did serve it&#x27;s purpose.</li>
    <li> Although I had some trouble assembling the stand for the dryer, the dryer itself works great. I have very curly hair and have had little success replicating the lovely, formed curls that the professionals create in the salon. Until now, air drying has been the only other way to preserve any ringlets at all, and I&#x27;m getting way too old to show up in public with wet hair. Blow drying? Takes forever and the curls separate even with the diffuser. My hair lady recommended finding an at-home hair dryer, one similar to the kind used in salons. I started looking and found this Meredith Professional here on Amazon, and it&#x27;s everything I&#x27;d hoped for. I spend about 10-15 minutes under the hood, reading or thinking or playing games on my phone, and my curls are set. Yes, you need to have room for the dryer, but if you do, you&#x27;ll love it.</li>
    <li> Great used this for my aunts salon, cheap but works like its an expensive dyer</li>
    <li> I LOVE IT!!! IT IS JUST PERFECT. MY DAUGHTER AND I ARE IN LOVE WITH IT. I RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT 100%</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m pretty new at taking care of my hair without a stylist (too  many bad experiences in the salon), and I thought it&#x27;d be great to have a free-standing dryer to help air-dry my hair neatly. Also, I didn&#x27;t want to buy a cheapie hooded dryer, nor pay $300 as an initial investment in one. The Meredith is a great value, and along with the reviews, this was an easy purchase for me. So far, I&#x27;ve only used it once and I do like it. The dryer looks and feels so professional, and I love walking by it in my home because of how it looks. It makes me feel proud. Since the dryer assembly, I&#x27;ve only used it once, as I don&#x27;t wash my hair more than once a week. I really did have a good experience with the dryer. It can dry hair on a cool setting or hot, which I like. My hair felt neat, soft, and I was proud of myself! Once I have used the dryer more, I&#x27;m sure my &amp;#34;like it&amp;#34; rating will be upgraded to a &amp;#34;love it&amp;#34;. **Note: when assemblying the castor arms, you need to screw the castors into one end of the arms, but they won&#x27;t tighten more than 2 or 3 rotations, which is fine. They&#x27;re still secure. The opposite end of the castor arms must be open, so you will need to take out the plastic tabs that are in them. They just pop out, so you shouldn&#x27;t have any problems doing that. Once the plastic tabs are removed, the holes in the arms will align with the holes in the metal plate (you&#x27;ll see what I mean) perfectly. This is a must, which I learned after fooling with this step for several minutes. All in all, it took me about 25mins to put this together, which wouldn&#x27;t have taken that long if I had figured out the deal about the plastic tabs. ALSO, the bell on the timer dings very loudly, which can be a shock in the beginning, since you&#x27;re not exactly sure how many minutes you have left under the dryer because you can&#x27;t see the timer. Enjoy your dryer... I know I will.</li>
    <li> I love my hair dryer. It&#x27;s quiet, hot, and just plain ole convenient. I would have given it 5 stars but it was not the one that&#x27;s posted in the picture. I was going to send it back until I used it. Works like a charm.</li>
    <li> I was pleasantly surprised by the performance of this dryer.  I  bought it to replace a Hot Tools hard bonnet dryer I also bought at Amazon which was of extremely poor quality.  This dryer was easy to assemble and I am not at all mechanically inclined.  It has lots of settings, an excellent timer, and is convenient to move with the included caster wheels.  I am a naturally curly haired lady with long hair halfway down my back and my hair is dry within 20 minutes on a lukewarm setting plus I get to relax with a good book and a cup of tea.  My hair has never looked or felt better!  Don&#x27;t know about ladies who use rollers in their hair but there seems to be plenty of room for that and I highly recommend the \\&quot;Meredith\\&quot; for all the curly girls out there. I&#x27;d give it more than five stars if I could! :-)</li>
