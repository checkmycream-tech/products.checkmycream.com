      <li>This product is amazing.</li>
      <li>they came out amazing.</li>
      <li>have to say, the powder does an amazing job.</li>
      <li>But if you don&#x27;t want to pay their over-over-inflated price for the refill, just make your own.  </li>
      <li>My wife said she liked this item.  </li>
      <li>I wondered why people were doing this  since Soncibrite machine comes with it&#x27;s own cleaning</li>
      <li>This effectively removes buildup in record time just like described.</li>
      <li>The container is handy on the counter, and not unattractive.</li>
      <li>The price was excellent and much cheaper than the one offered by the Invisilgn company.</li>
      <li>Now they are great and always clean feeling in my mouth.  </li>
      <li>Works great and gives your mouth that soooooooo clean feeling.</li>
      <li>Great way to keep the teeth clean.  </li>
      <li>Not as good as a full sized unit, but effective and handy for traveling or visiting.  </li>
      <li>As far as the product working for my mouth guard, it works great!!</li>
      <li>Would recommend this product to anyone and everyone who likes their teeth to look bright and feel clean.  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know how helpful the \\&quot;ultrasonic waves\\&quot; are for cleaning out the retainer, but this is just a good container to clean the retainer</li>
      <li>Product does a good job keeping invisalign clean.</li>
      <li>I was happy at first...</li>
      <li>It is very efficient and I am very happy that I don&#x27;t have to manually clean my night guard anymore.  </li>
      <li>The cleaner junk seems to strong to trust on anything I own, but it came with the container.</li>
      <li>I also read on  the blogs that many orthodontists had recommended it to their invisalign patients.  </li>
      <li>Be sure to flip the power switch to avoid burning through batteries like it&#x27;s your job.</li>
      <li>and it got most of the junk off my retainers</li>
      <li>I was still able to find plaque on it after using this machine.</li>
      <li>There is NO WAY that this refill costs more than a couple of dollars for SonicBrite to manufacture.  </li>
      <li>I love that the product works.</li>
      <li>use the vibrating jar with another cleaner better suited to my retainers</li>
      <li>If it did not dance around on my counter top I&#x27;d have given if 5</li>
      <li>I wrote a great review for the retainer brite tablets and have been using them with the ultrasonic sonic brite cleaner for a year, and really like them.  </li>
      <li>Would purchase this for many on our gift list.</li>
      <li>I tried this a couple different ways, and the best results for me ended up being putting my dentures in at night using the SonicBrite cleaner along with the Polident tablet of your choice, run machine for a cycle, then run it again in the morning while I am in the shower.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m so glad that it&#x27;s description wasn&#x27;t just built-up hype.</li>
      <li>I combed the web, I kept seeing this pairing of Sonicbrite plus Retainer Brite Tablets in many of the blogs and on Amazon too.  </li>
      <li>I find the device does the intended job of cleaning my dental device and am greatly pleased with the customer service.  </li>
      <li>I had avoided using it because the tablets were more convenient.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Use it every day and love the way it works.  </li>
      <li>it is better ...</li>
      <li>Particularly pleased with NON-walking character of the device, don&#x27;t know why others are having problems here--the plastic feet on mine don&#x27;t walk.</li>
      <li>I would love a unit that plugs into an outlet.  </li>
      <li>so there you go :)</li>
      <li>The company says that you can use it with  \\&quot;invisible braces\\&quot;,  but the powder is an all-in-one product and they seem to be more geared towards denture cleaning.  </li>
      <li>Now I am satisfied with it and will continue using it.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> does not work at all,  dental brace still gross.  better to use hot water and toothbrush dipped in baking soda works much better</li>
    <li> I like the product as it seems to get my mouthguard clean. The machine itself is very noisy, and while it stops after 15 minutes, why doesn&#x27;t it automatically shut itself off?</li>
    <li> Used it a couple of times since receiving it, and my dentures are now clean. Once the chewing gum comes off no problems at all</li>
    <li> I bought this product for my Invisalign braces.  It works great!  I highly recommend it!  Took off weeks worth of coffee stains, too.</li>
    <li> I purchased this unit for my invisalign braces.  It works very well.  If you use this system to clean daily you will avoid stains and unwanted odors on the invisalign trays.  You can tell the trays get really clean when you use this.  Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> I have worn a night guard for 20 years and always struggled to keep it clear and clean-looking. I tried denture cleaners and all sorts of other things, including things you&#x27;re really not supposed to do, like boil it in vinegar or use bleach, etc. Bad, bad, I know, but over time, it always got a disgusting buildup, even though it was sanitary. I ended up taking it to the dentist to have it cleaned there every year. After a week of using SonicBrite, my night guard is beautifully clear, and has remained so since then. Using it couldn&#x27;t be much easier. Just pop the retainer in it, add water up to the line, add the granules, and turn it on! Set your phone timer to remind you to remove and rinse it after 15 minutes, when it automatically turns off.</li>
    <li> May have to clean twice once in a while.</li>
    <li> WOW works great, coffee stains disappear, a light brushing after wards removes everything else. The dish is big enough to hold my dentures covered with water. I bought this one mainly because of the auto shut off feature, worth every penny.</li>
    <li> This system is simply a veneer.  Yes it does whiten the dentures but it is purely cosmetic.  Once you soak them again, the stains return!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing Invisalign for a few months now and I was hoping that this product would help cut my morning/evening routine down by reducing the number of times I&#x27;m required to brush my aligners (which is every time they come out of my mouth).  Because the aligners are clear, I can clearly see the amount of plaque and other debris that has accumulated on the plastic.  After a 15 minute sonic bath, this debris is reduced but by no means eliminated.  I&#x27;ve tried doubling the bath time to 30 minutes and I&#x27;ve adjusted the amount of powder that I add to the bath.  Regardless of what I try, I still find myself brushing my aligners at least twice a day.    Additionally, I find that the bath likes to \\&quot;walk\\&quot; around while it&#x27;s vibrating.  We&#x27;ve tried it on multiple surfaces and with a few barricades and can&#x27;t seem to find a solution that doesn&#x27;t result in a horribly loud vibrating noise or a reduction in the vibrations traveling thought the water.    The SonicBrite cleaning system may adequately disinfect and deodorize your oral appliance but it has failed at cleaning my Invisalign aligners.  I can do the same thing with a glass and a $6 box of denture tablets and don&#x27;t have to worry about that walking off the counter.    ********************  EDIT - May 23, 2011    Even though my experience was not what I was hoping for and I may have had a defective appliance, I would like to comment on the fact that Michelle at Sonic Brite was more than happy to accommodate me by offering to send a replacement unit.  I&#x27;ve added a star to this rating for the positive customer service offered.</li>
    <li> You are better off using simple denture capsules like Efferdent to clean plastic retainers. The shaking, noisy Sonic Brite doesn&#x27;t do anything to get rid of the smell of my retainers after a night of wearing them, nor did it remove any of the stains on them. It just vibrated all over my counter and practically fell off if I didn&#x27;t surround it with things.</li>
    <li> I purchased the SonicBrite for my son to use every morning to clean his Invisalign trays. It did a great job cleaning the trays, and we compensated for the vibration it made by setting it on a washcloth. I wish it offered a cord instead of requiring batteries. My son used it almost every day for nearly four months, until it quit working 5 minutes into the cleaning cycle. Replacing the batteries did not solve the problem. Hoping to hear back from SonicBrite on what we can do to either fix or replace it.  Update:  1-6-2012  SonicBrite advised banging the unit on a padded surface or forcing the on-off switch back hard a few times to try to coax it to work again. Tried both, and it didn&#x27;t help. Since the product only offers a 30-day warranty, they won&#x27;t replace it and recommended that I buy a new one. I&#x27;ll be looking into products that cost less.  I allowed my son to take the SonicBrite apart, and we found one possible cause why it stopped working - a wire came loose running from the power source to the motor. Then my son attempted to run the motor from another powersource, and could not get it to run. He suggested that the poor design that allows the unit to vibrate itself around the countertop contributed to the wire coming loose.</li>
    <li> Although I&#x27;ve been diligent in cleaning my dentures several times a day, they  accumulated a lot of placque and discolored a lot.  There was a vast improvement  in these areas the first time I used my SonicBrite.  Now they are great and always clean feeling in my mouth.  Smartest purchase I&#x27;ve made!</li>
    <li> to sum up, this is a great solution for cleaning plastic retainers.  hands down.    i was in need of a good retainer cleaner after i had been soaking my all-plastic retainers in denture solutions for the past two and a half years.  i recently noticed a hairline crack on one of the retainers and read that the chemicals in denture solutions (the fizzy tablets) are too strong for the plastic and can dry them out, causing them to crack.  i needed something that was made FOR retainers and actually worked.  let me tell you -- this WORKS!    before my first use of the sonic brite cleaner, my retainers had buildup on them so they were cloudy and the buildup in the indentions of the molars would not come out, no matter how much i brushed or soaked.  the night the sonic brite arrived, i was skeptical that it would take all of this grossness that had accumulated off in one cleaning, which was fine -- i could always soak it again later or the next day to finish the job.  well, after that first cleaning, i checked the retainers and literally only said one word: \\&quot;WOW\\&quot;.  they were clear and clean of the cloudy buildup, and what buildup was left in the molar indentions brushed away with ease and running water.  i don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s the cleaner / powder or the vibrating sensations or a combination, but this thing really works.  to the people who said it didn&#x27;t get as clean as they&#x27;d hoped, i am not sure how dirty your appliances were, but the sonic brite did wonders for me.  :-)</li>
    <li> I order the SonicBrite Cleansing system for my upper dentures and a lower partial.  I just got my dentures 3 weeks ago, so I wanted to make sure I could do everything possible to clean my dentures, and keep them as new as possible because I am a tea drinker and a smoker. I got this system today and I couldn&#x27;t wait to use it.  I instantly put it together and loaded my dentures and partial into the tray.  Unfortunately, I received a system that the timer did not go off automaticaly. It stayed stationary, didn&#x27;t move all over my table as other reviewers have mentioned.  When I took out my dentures and partial they were beautiful!!  I noticed a faint smell of bleach though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I called SonicBrite&#x27;s company, received the BEST customer service of my LIFE!!!  The lady I spoke with answered my questions.  It DOES have a faint bleach smell but she guaranteed me there was NO BLEACH used in the powder.  The smell was due to mixing of chemicals that they use. The reason my unit did not vibrate all over the place is because they have added rubber feet to the system fixing that problem. And at last I told her that my unit&#x27;s automatic shut down didn&#x27;t work, it would go MUCH longer than the 15 minutes that was the MAXIMUM time.  She simply said to me that they were very sorry for that, and they immediately took down my address to ship me out another unit.  She told me to use the one that&#x27;s timer doesn&#x27;t work to clean my jewelry!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This company&#x27;s amazing!!  There INSTANT fix of my problem. The fact that when I called I actually got a LIVE PERSON right away. And the time she took with me on the phone to answer all of my questions.  GREAT CUSTOMER SERVICE!!!</li>
    <li> The SonicBrite makes my coffee and wine stained invisalign braces look like new! It has worked consistently for a year and half. Easy to clean and travels well. I&#x27;ve even set a container of jewelry cleaner in it and used the motion to clean jewelry!</li>
    <li> After trying so many methods to remove those white stains on my retainer, I have found a solution with SonicBrite! There is an obvious change from the very first use! I have a lot of buildup on my retainer, so it required several cycles to remove the stains. But it works!</li>
    <li> I use this bath for my newly acquired retainer. It does the job keeping my retainer clean and fresh very well.</li>
    <li> The first one I got was defective...the switch was loose and wouldn&#x27;t stay on.  I called SonicBrite directly.  They replaced it no questions asked.  Very nice people.  Awesome service.  They shipped a new one to me very quickly.  I use this on my retainers and it works great!  All the white bulked up gunk was gone after a few times.  I brushed mine with my Sonicare after the first few times and that seems to help get it a little cleaner.  I know it is not recommended but, I&#x27;ve left my retainer in there for a whole day and I didn&#x27;t notice any issues.    Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> When I first looked at this product I was very skeptical about how well it worked for various reasons. My initial fear was its price, a relatively cheap product in comparison to others like it, so I questioned its quality. I also was very nervous about the unit being battery powered, my retainers were old and difficult to clean at this point and I didn&#x27;t think batteries would be powerful enough to do the job. I ended up purchasing this product because it had such great reviews, and ignored my gut feelings. In the end I made the right choice. The first cleaning showed a significant decrease in the amount of white buildup on the clear invisalign retainers. I was very surprised to see how well this product actually worked after all the wear and tear the retainers had been through over the past few years. I recommend this product to anyone who is sick of spending to much time cleaning retainers and getting sub par results.</li>
    <li> The vibration shuts off after 20min, which I dont&#x27; think is sufficient to get my retainer clean. The powder stuff that comes with it doesn&#x27;t do anything but make it dirtier. Basically I still have to brush my retainer to get all the buildup off.</li>
    <li> As far as cleaning my retainers it does an amazing job. With daily use I see no white calcium build up on my retainers. They smell clean, look clean, and feel very clean after I use the SonicBrite. However, after a few months it gets very noisy and even MOVES across the counter top. I sometimes have to pick it up and put it back where it was because it loves to vibrate it&#x27;s way from one spot to another spot on the counter. Other than that, it works great. If it did not dance around on my counter top I&#x27;d have given if 5 stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I should also add that I am a dental hygiene student who will be graduating very soon from college. While the instructions do not say it is necessary, I ALWAYS scrub my retainers with a tooth brush prior to putting them into the Sonic Brite. The reason for this is to ensure I get the heavier amount first, while the Sonic Brite removes the remaining that can&#x27;t be removed with my tooth brush alone. Again, the instructions do not say you have to, but I do it anyway to ensure I get a very thorough cleaning of my retainers.</li>
    <li> The device was inoperative when received.  I called customer service and was advised to try a quick fix while on the call.  It didn&#x27;t work, so a replacement unit was shipped and received within days, with no obligation to return the failed unit.  The new unit worked.  I disassembled the failed unit and found a wire which was not properly soldered at the chinese factory and so advised customer service.  I find the device does the intended job of cleaning my dental device and am greatly pleased with the customer service.  This is a reliable company and a great product.</li>
    <li> I was using the tablets from SonicBrite for a long time and I decided to upgrade to the professional cleansing system. I use the clear retainers and the top one has a dark stain in it that I could not remove. After reading the product description I decided to give it a try. This system did not remove the stain, but I&#x27;m not disappointed enough to give it a negative review.  CONS: It&#x27;s another gadget that you have to store or let sit on your bathroom sink.  Even though I use a sonic toothbrush, in the back of my mind I wonder if this is really working.  The instructions warn you not to leave your retainers in the solution for more than the 15 minute cycle or it could create black stains; so you really have to stay on top of it.  PROS: Easy to use. Sonic technology. Battery operated (no plug to worry about)  All in all, the tablets were much easier to use, but if you&#x27;re looking for a more thorough cleaning, then you might give this a try if you don&#x27;t mind the cons I mentioned above.</li>
    <li> When I got my braces off, I thought I could just use denture cleaner to keep them clean but after waking up a couple of times with slime in my mouth I knew the denture cleaner wasn&#x27;t working, so I researched and found this product. The first time I used it, my essix retainer came out a little cloudy looking. I almost stopped using the product but decided to give it one more chance that night to see how it worked, and it was AMAZING! My retainers came out so clean (after a little brushing) and the next morning, there was no slime build up in my retainer. The machine does \\&quot;dance\\&quot; across the counter when being used, I just took the bubble wrap that it came wrapped in and stick it underneath while using it. I have been using this product for a month now, and my retainers are fresh and as clean as the day I got them! I will definitely be using this product for as long as I use my retainers (the rest of my life!)</li>
    <li> Quick and Easy to use! My younger brother can do it for me when asked :)&lt;br /&gt;Of course, don&#x27;t put it on the counter edge! Who would be so silly? lol.&lt;br /&gt;You MUST run water over your retainer for a few moments. Otherwise it taste like grossness, lol. I run water for 3-5 minutes and rub it with my fingers, but that&#x27;s just me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enjoy</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s larger than I expected, so it takes up more counter space that I&#x27;d like.  BUT!  It has a built in timer, the removable cup is very easy to work with, and the lid comes off the removable cup without you have to hold the base and cup with one hand.  I have not used the cleaning powder yet, so no comment there.</li>
    <li> I have a lot of plaque on my plastic retainers after a few years of use.  The cleaner I&#x27;ve been using daily does a fair job, but the SonicBrite system is well on its way to removing all of the plaque.  I&#x27;m amazed at how clear the retainers look after only 2 uses.  I like that the machine is set for a specific time to operate (15 minutes) and turns off automatically.</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B0014ST5Y4 SonicBrite Professional Cleansing System]]  I did a lot of research into sonic cleaners and settled on this one.  I seemed to do what I needed (clean my dentures) at a reasonable price.  This has been borne out in practice.</li>
    <li> found this elsewhere and put it on the Remember this link for Amazon...when it showed up on the Amazon site I bought it and it is a great, great product!  So worth the money spent.</li>
    <li> My mom needed something to clean her dentures.  Brushing with a stiff brush wasn&#x27;t doing it, using Efferdent twice or thrice in a row didn&#x27;t do it, another weaker cleaner didn&#x27;t do it.  This cleaned very well, fit both her uppers and lowers at once, and wasn&#x27;t very noisy.  I&#x27;m going to buy one for my jewelry!</li>
    <li> NOT IMPRESSED AMAZON! The whole machine decided to die exactly one month after I bought it. Yes I did put new batteries in, the light comes on but no motor. According to Amazon&#x27;s rules I am 2 days late to get a refund (shame about the 2 day weekend we have just had when I decided to relax!). This machine did not clean my mouth guard at all well, despite the fact that I used the cleaner enclosed and also tried another cleaner that was suggested.  I purchase a huge amount of things from Amazon in both the USA and in England for family and friends and this is the first time I have ever had to complain. I am NOT a happy customer! Your customer service right now for me rates -10*</li>
    <li> The SonicBrite definitely cleans retainers better than simple denture cleaners or other products like that.  However, it still does not get them as clean as I had hoped.  Worth the money, though.</li>
    <li> I just got this yesterday and did a 15 minute treatment. WOW!! I noticed a big difference after just 1 treatment. I will do a treatment once a week and I will recommend this product to others!</li>
    <li> I gave this 4 stars rather than 5 because of the shipping box. The shipping box was about 9x18, and inside was the cleaner box; about 5x5. Seems like it could have shipped in a much smaller carton and knock a few bucks off the shipping charges. The cleaner itself works great, both my upper and lower dentures fit inside it.</li>
    <li> Read reviews before purchase, as I generally do. Unit performs better than expected. Particularly pleased with NON-walking character of the device, don&#x27;t know why others are having problems here--the plastic feet on mine don&#x27;t walk. The clock timer seems right on to the minute, and switches off automatically after 15 minutes. When it runs it&#x27;s almost silent--to me anyway, but my hearing is poor. The dentures I&#x27;ve been using are more than four months with no cleaning except for a brush, and so were badly calcified. Three days into cleaning with the Sonic Brite has greatly improved them and I think another two or three days should restore them to new. I&#x27;m a happy customer.</li>
    <li> I had the full set of plastic retainers for 20+ years.  After that length of time they were getting pretty difficult to keep clean.  Really I had tried everything:  denture cleaning products, effervescent tablets, baking soda, you name it.  After 2 - 3 cleanings with the Sonic Brite machine and powder, my retainers are good as new.  I am able to maintain their condition by using the cleaner once or twice a week.  Would highly recommend!</li>
    <li> I bought this to clean a night guard that had a couple years of buildup... gross.  After less than a week of once a day cleanings, the deposits are mostly gone and the appliance looks great!  I&#x27;m very satisfied.  Would have been 5 starts if it had an AC cord, and wasn&#x27;t battery only.</li>
    <li> Does a great job of cleaning those expensive partials.  powder is very expensive and will look for alternative to use when gone.</li>
    <li> I put my retainers in this product and clean them twice a day!  It works really well for me and vibrates off the crud!</li>
    <li> I chose this system on the recommendation of a family member and it has so far stood up to its recommendation. It is quick and very easy to use and only takes 10 minutes.I have only been using this for about a month so I can&#x27;t comment on what lifespan it will have, but so far it works just as good as described.</li>
    <li> This machine was recommended by my dentist, and her demonstration cleaned the tray, but I thought \\&quot;why bother?\\&quot;  In about 30 seconds my electric toothbrush removes any accumulated plaque from the inside of the trays (for free).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Plus they get thrown-away, and  I get a shiny new tray every two weeks.  Bottom line: I&#x27;m saving about fifty dollars and a lot of hassle/complication.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know how helpful the \\&quot;ultrasonic waves\\&quot; are for cleaning out the retainer, but this is just a good container to clean the retainer, that doesn&#x27;t look to unaesthetic in the bathroom. Also, the lid of mine doesn&#x27;t work, whenever I turn the unit on with the lid on, the lid slips off and starts knocking, making a horrible noise.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product less than a year ago and it has stopped working.  It did clean OK but it is very loud. I am very disappointed with the longevity!</li>
    <li> The sonic cleaner system is great.  Quiet and does a great job.  The Sonic Brite cleaning powder is not so good.  The powder left a hazy film on the clear braces after only a few weeks.  Also, regardless of how much or how little powder used, the taste of clorine was always a factor.  I use Retainer Brite tablets and it works fantastic.</li>
    <li> This product does not work as advertised. Did not clean my invisilign trays at all. Very disappointed after all the marketing hype.</li>
    <li> I use the RB tabs b/c of prior reviews that I&#x27;ve read that used it to clean their retainers. I deducted 1 star for the simple fact that I&#x27;ve used it before bed every night and I still see small calcium deposits on my retainers. I gave it 4 stars because if I did not use it every night I would most likely have a tremendous amount of calcium on my retainers.</li>
    <li> Product is good so far.  Wish it didn&#x27;t have to be wiped down every day so the batteries don&#x27;t get wet.  As far as the product working for my mouth guard, it works great!!</li>
    <li> This was a disaster from the start. As an invisalign wearer, this cleaning system was absolutely useless. It did not clean my invisalign as thoroughly as I would have wished for. I was still able to find plaque on it after using this machine. For about $50 for a device that produces a weak vibration, you are better off using a toothbrush and brushing your invisaligns. I threw this thing out after a month of using it. I would not recommend anyone to buy it.</li>
    <li> I have been buying this product for a while for my Invisalign from the makers of the product. When I went to go buy it recently the sonicbrite website was gone come to find out it&#x27;s now sold my Amazon. I now have to wait for an email from Amazon for the product to be available. I&#x27;m done with it!</li>
    <li> The powder does contain some chlorine bleach, so be careful you don&#x27;t use it with any dental prosthetics that ban the use of it. Also be careful not to splash the liquid on your clothing since it can discolor it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use the vibrating jar with another cleaner better suited to my retainers and I use the Sonic Brite powder with things like bite guards.</li>
    <li> Not as good as a full sized unit, but effective and handy for traveling or visiting.  It does what I needed it to do.</li>
    <li> Does a good job when directions are followed. Still runs on alkaline batteries. Would purchase this for many on our gift list.</li>
    <li> Bought this product to clean my invisalign braces, the item arrived at my door very quickly.  Product does a good job keeping invisalign clean.</li>
    <li> I use this with another cleaning tab called Retainer Brite. FANTASTIC results. I use my plastic retainer trays to bleach my teach and this with the tabs keeps them from getting cloudy.</li>
    <li> My invisalign trays were becoming a pain to clean.  White deposits forming.  The invisalign \\&quot;Cleaning Crystals\\&quot;  are horrendously expensive... as much as 50 cents a day.  My invisalign guide book said to never use denture cleaner so all of those tablets that are advertised during the national news hour are a no go for invisalign.  Many bloggers said not to use tooth paste because it would make little scratches on the surface of the invisalign trays making breeding ground for bacteria. So there I was,  scrubbing away with just my bare toothbrush for 3 to 5 minutes each day.  Oh, and then there&#x27;s these little control bumps in the aligners that the brush can&#x27;t really reach.  What a pain!  I started looking for a solution.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As I combed the web, I kept seeing this pairing of Sonicbrite plus Retainer Brite Tablets in many of the blogs and on Amazon too.  I wondered why people were doing this  since Soncibrite machine comes with it&#x27;s own cleaning powder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ordered the machine and the Retainerbrite tablets....and did some experimenting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Sonicbrite powder that comes with the machine smells like it has chlorine in it and they do say it can bleach clothing.  The company says that you can use it with  \\&quot;invisible braces\\&quot;,  but the powder is an all-in-one product and they seem to be more geared towards denture cleaning.  I did run my Invisalign trays for the first time in the machine with the Sonicbrite powder.  I opened the lid and saw how the water had a cool pattern in it from the vibrations,  but I also smelled the chlorine.  This was somewhat disconcerting.  My trays came out clean and sparkly, which was very cool,  but I worried about the effects of the chlorine on my invisaligns.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I then I tried the RetainerBrite tablets.  I reasoned (rightly or wrongly)  that Retainerbrite might be safer because retainers are much more similar in construction to invisalign trays than dentures.  I also read on  the blogs that many orthodontists had recommended it to their invisalign patients.  I have yet to tell my orthodontist that I&#x27;m doing this, but I will at my next visit..... I&#x27;ll give an update to this review if he tells me I am  wrong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Retainerbrite is meant to be a standalone product.  So I thought I&#x27;d do a little experimenting.  First,  I tried the Retainerbrite alone.  Then I tried the Retainerbrite in the Sonicbrite machine.  The tablets alone cleaned away 75 percent and loosened the remaining buildup so that it could brushed off with a few light strokes of the toothbrush.  Retainerbrite  tablets plus Sonicbrite machine cleaned them 100 percent.  Very cool!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m guessing each person&#x27;s mouth is different and makes deposits at different rates.  So if you have invisalign you might just want to try the Retainerbrite tablets by themselves first.  They might work perfectly for you without the machine.  Or if you don&#x27;t mind a little light brushing afterwards,  stick with the tablets alone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For me however,  the Sonicbrite machine  means I so not have to brush them at all... which was my goal.  This has now become my daily regime.  Each morning I put my invisalign  trays in the machine, fill with water,  drop in a Retainerbrite tablet and turn on the machine.  It runs for about 15 minutes.  I let them sit in the solution for an additional 5 to 10 minutes.  Meanwhile I&#x27;m doing all my morning stuff which no longer includes standing at the sink scrubbing my invisalign trays.  At the end,  I rinse and I&#x27;m ready to go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I knocked a star off Sonicbrite not because the machine disappointed me, I am very very pleased with it.  I knocked a star off for the consternation I had over the sonicbrite cleaning powder.  I little firmer assurance from the company might help.  If Invisalign will not endorse them,  then they should find another way.  We  Invisalign wearers are quite protective of our trays.  If we break one midway through.... they&#x27;ve got to jump to the next onewhich is painful,  or order a replacement which is painful to the wallet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update  9/06/11******&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I now have tried the Sonicbrite cleaning power on my invisalign trays..... a lot.  Have not had a problem with it at all... Trays don&#x27;t seem to be damaged by the stuff....and it does clean them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some reviewers have complained about the unit vibrating itself across the counter.... yep it can.  Simple fix,  set it on a wash cloth or towel... problem solved.</li>
    <li> Complete junk.  It works for the first few weeks and then the power switch ceases to function unless you fiddle with it for a few minutes.</li>
    <li> This product does a wonderful job of cleaning stained dentures.  I used the cleaning product that came with it and am extremely happy with the results.</li>
    <li> Have tried just about everything on the market, to no avail. after just one cleansing with my new ultra sonic cleanser they came out amazing. If you have stained dentures from smoking this is a must have. definetly a 5 star product.</li>
    <li> This is not bad, it came with one of the rubber feet missing.  Too much trouble to return it since it was not distributed from Amazon.  I just stick something under it when I run it to keep it level.  Use it daily for about 1 month now and still working fine.  I will say that the cleaner that comes in this package is awful.  It works well but the terrible taste remains on the mouthguard.  No mount of rinsing takes care of that.  I will use a different brand I have used in the past when this runs out.</li>
    <li> I use this with my night guard. I like that it just does what it should without fuss. It won&#x27;t work miracles but over a week or so it has gradually removed a lot of discoloration.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;+ Cordless and runs fine on rechargeable AA batteries (not included).&lt;br /&gt;+ Simple design is easy to clean and looks neutral.&lt;br /&gt;+ Light enough to pack for an extended trip.&lt;br /&gt;+ Very quiet as long as the pieces are assembled tightly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- Battery compartment requires stacking the batteries; awkward to do and easy to get wrong.&lt;br /&gt;- The instructions discuss keeping water out of the switch to prevent corrosion. Seems to me a device designed to contain water should have a waterproof switch.</li>
    <li> A gift for my husband who just loves it!  He says that it cleans well and without mess in a short period of time.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve just used the Sonic Brite for the first time to clean my retainers and so far I am very impressed as they came out looking really clean.  It was a pleasant surprise to find it nicely packaged and that batteries were included.  I stuck to using a Retainer Brite tablet because I was a bit worried about a previous review that said the Sonic Brite powder had a bit of &#x27;bleachy&#x27; smell.  The automatic shut-off is a good feature too.The only negative was that the instructions show that there is a water level indicator on the side of the inner container but if they were there, I couldn&#x27;t see them.  However, I only filled it about half to three quarters full and it worked fine.</li>
    <li> I love this machine! No more white residue, and they even feel cleaner. I tried this a couple different ways, and the best results for me ended up being putting my dentures in at night using the SonicBrite cleaner along with the Polident tablet of your choice, run machine for a cycle, then run it again in the morning while I am in the shower. This removes all plaque, stains, white stuff, and most important, any denture adhesive residue is gone using this method. I don&#x27;t know how long the batteries will last in it using it twice a day, but I don&#x27;t care. I love having clean dentures and not having to brush them.</li>
    <li> Product performance is very good. This removes build up that ordinary cleaners cannot remove. Glad I spent the money on this product</li>
    <li> The SonicBrite has worked great.  It cleans night guards well.  Easy to use and gets rid of built up plaque.</li>
    <li> This is the best product out on the market,it cleaned my dentures so well that I would not use anything else. I do wish I had known about this product sometime ago.Just before I run out,I will order directly from the Company</li>
    <li> I just now got some batteries for my new denture cleaning unit.  So, I ran a cleaning test for the first time with this unit.  Followed the directions for cleaning a denture and exactly 15 minutes later, the unit turned off just like the directions indicated it would.  Removed the denture.  Took a look and it is CLEAN!  All the hard to remove stains are gone now.  I love this machine and I&#x27;m very glad I bought it.  I would recommend it to anyone who wears a denture.  Amazing little machine.</li>
    <li> I would recommend this cleaning system to everyone. :) I wish that I had known about this product sooner! It makes the retainer brite tablets look like a joke. I&#x27;m so glad that it&#x27;s description wasn&#x27;t just built-up hype. This effectively removes buildup in record time just like described. It isn&#x27;t every day that something exceeds expectation. I love it! It&#x27;s easy to use and cleans fantastically . A+ cleaning system!</li>
    <li> I bought this for cleaning my invisalign aligners.  I had been using just retainer brite and was tired of brushing them after using the cleaner.  I thought this would help with that.  There is no difference between this and just soaking them in retainer brite.  Save your money, and stick to the Retainer Brite alone.</li>
    <li> Works as advertised. I was surprised. I treat myself by placing my dentures in this system once or twice a week when I don&#x27;t feel like brushing them and sure enough - they come out cleaner than if I would have taken the time to brush them. Good deal. Good price.</li>
    <li> I gave it 4 stars but I don&#x27;t have anything to compare it too as this is the first cleanings system I bought. I wanted to buy something to clean my invisaline retainers. I&#x27;ve been cleaning with a toothbrush and toothpaste for the last six months.  First day I got it in I cleaned for the first time and it got 90% of the stuff out but not all of it as other reviews has suggested. I cleaned it two more times after that and it got most of the junk off my retainers but I still had to use a toothbrush for some areas. I use it once a day now and it&#x27;s much better then using a toothbrush but not perfect. So don&#x27;t expect to have it clean 100% as some of the others reviews suggest.</li>
    <li> I bought the SonicBrite machine and the Retainerbrite tablets to keep my snoreguard mouthpiece clean.  This thing has worked perfectly for over a year now!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only concerns I have had are with noise and vibration.  I found that the machine will make a lot of noise if there is water between the basin and the lid. If that is kept dry, there will be no noise. I have also found that the washcloth trick under the machine will keep it from &amp;#34;walking&amp;#34; across he counter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The timer works perfectly.  The batteries last a long time.  This machine has done just what I wanted it to do!</li>
    <li> I have had mine for about two years. Battery life is great and it cleans great. I use it every day. I have not read the other reviews (What is the point? I already have one). It runs for about 15 minutes. It can be a little chattery but I just put a wash cloth underneath it (squared) and it is better ... it also does not walk away ... however ...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do not like the cleaner they reccomend. There is something funny about it (maybe too aggressive) and I found that the cleaner made my retainers \\&quot;age\\&quot; faster. I use Efferdent in the cleaner with warm water and occasionally (not always, as it is not needed and adds to wear and tear) use a baby toothbrush to lightly brush them.(Brushing invisalign is not reccomended as it wears on the invisibility of them)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Result? My invisalign retainers are always clean, always fresh and stain free, and last a VERY long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I sat listening to my cleaner run this morning and realized ... I have had this thing for just over two years and I use it every day and never wrote a review of this great little product ... so there you go :)</li>
    <li> Awesome system.  Have used it for over 2 years, and it still works like brand new.  Great product.</li>
    <li> My father was experiencing tea staining on his partial plate.  The overnight soaking of commercial denture soaks were nit removing the stains.  I purchased this product for him and after two uses the tea stains were removed.  Excellent product!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m using the Sonic Brite Dental Cleaning System to clean my Invisalign and retainer to get them thoroughly disinfected. It works great!</li>
    <li> I was happy at first...cleaned as promised, then it just totally stopped working. Light comes on, but no vibration anymore just like another reviewer said. And there&#x27;s no excuse for a product that sells for over $40 to come with a 30 day warranty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh, and take a look at [...] looks like they&#x27;ve stopped selling this product.</li>
    <li> Just like several others reported mine helped to clean my Invisalign trays great for two months then stopped working. The unit was never dropped or abused and I wiped it dry after every use.  The problem is also not the batteries, and the power light still comes on but nobody is home....Customer Service was a complete waste of time, their solution was \\&quot;Buy Another One.\\&quot;  Would one star if possible, Don&#x27;t Buy.</li>
    <li> I wrote a great review for the retainer brite tablets and have been using them with the ultrasonic sonic brite cleaner for a year, and really like them.  But I started using the sonicbrite powder this month.  I had avoided using it because the tablets were more convenient.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to say, the powder does an amazing job. It bleaches out all the stains and grunge, especially when used with the sonic machine.  I am on the third month of wearing one of my trays, at the end of my treatment, the the other tray on a two week rotation.  I have had them in when drinking coffee and red wine, and gotten lipstick stains on them.  The powder gets all these stains out and returns the long-term tray to a sparkling clean appearance rivaling the new trays with minimal brushing.  I have not noticed any damage to my plastic trays yet after leaving them soaking for over thirty minutes.  The only negative is the strong chlorine flavor, but that resolves after wearing the tray again for a few minutes.  And somehow, no matter what I do, the powder gets all over my sink.  Need to figure that one out :-).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think the retainerbrite tablets are best for travel etc, but the powder is definitely superior for removing stains.</li>
    <li> I use the SonicBrite for my night time mouth guard.  It was just not getting clean by brushing alone.  I had also tried denture tablets, but it still did not feel clean.  The SonicBrite gets my mouth guard very clean and fresh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do have a few negatives.  The unit is quite loud and if not completing on a level surface will bump its way around the counter.  I was really shocked by how loud it is.  It also takes 15 minutes to clean.  This is fine, but you cannot allow the appliance to sit in the solution.  This is somewhat of a pain as you need to make sure you set a timer and promptly remove the appliance. I have forgotten it for up to an hour and the appliance takes on a whitish film.  You then must soak it in plain water for hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So bottom line is that is sanitizes my mouth guard wonderfully.  Yet, it is noisy and I do not like the 15 minutes and must remove.  I think it was more efficient to just brush and soak.</li>
    <li> Great product!  Easy to use.  Plenty of room for upper &amp; lower dentures. Have not tried any other cleaners yet, but will, just out of curiosity.  Seems like it would be easy &amp; compact enough to travel with.  Glad I ordered it!</li>
    <li> Although noisy, the product worked well during its short life. After three weeks, it stopped dead. New batteries made no difference: fini. \\&quot;Made in China\\&quot; seems no guarantee of a good product. If I had known in advance, I certainly would have saved my money. The reviews on Amazon seemed generally positive.</li>
    <li> I got this item for my Invisalign braces. I love that the product works. I hate that while the unit does automatically shut off, the batteries stay in use. Be sure to flip the power switch to avoid burning through batteries like it&#x27;s your job.</li>
    <li> I got my dentures in late December (full upper, partial lower). Aside from all the issues of getting used to the detures themselves, I had to deal with cleaning. As a coffee drinker and smoker I noticed stains building up in the crevices around the teeth. Soaking and brushing with a denture cream didn&#x27;t get rid of all the stains. After reading the other reviews of this machine, I ordered it. Awesome. First use the dentures came out clean and, after just a little brushing, stain free. Plenty of room in the tray for both plates. The SonicBrite cleaning powder does seem a bit expensive but, it works and I will reorder.</li>
    <li> After reading some of the reviews, I didn&#x27;t know what to expect. Units works great and cleans my retainers better than the dentist office can. Just don&#x27;t slop water all over it as the instructions state that water entry into the switch area could ruin it. So far so good...</li>
    <li> Great way to keep the teeth clean.  Worked wonders on mine.  Would recommend this product to anyone and everyone who likes their teeth to look bright and feel clean.  To have them professionally cleaned gets expensive and this system does a very good job for less money.</li>
    <li> Annoying to use and it also made my invisalign yellow. DO NOT USE.</li>
    <li> I really like this machine...it helps a lot with cleaning the invisalign type retainers.  Do wish it had an adaptor, not sure how long the batteries hold up for.  I&#x27;ve run it about 10 times..still at full strength. Also it says runs for 15 minutes and then shuts off.  Set a timer for 15 min b/c it&#x27;s hit or miss if it will shut off by itself.</li>
    <li> This is a very good cleaner for my night guard.  Unlike some users&#x27; experiences, my SonicBrite is very quiet.  The only times I have noticed it being unduly noisy is if the lid is not properly seated.  In the nine months I have been using it, I have only been through one set of batteries.  It is very efficient and I am very happy that I don&#x27;t have to manually clean my night guard anymore.  I like that it shuts off by itself.  I would definitely recommend this product.    I have ONE issue and that is the EGREGIOUS price of $16.99 that SonicBrite charges for their refill, which is almost HALF of what the entire system costs.  Rather than purchasing the refill, you&#x27;d be better off buying the entire system again and reselling only the machine on an auction site to someone who only needs the machine and make up some of your money.  There is NO WAY that this refill costs more than a couple of dollars for SonicBrite to manufacture.  It is a persulfate cleanser.  Ingredients are sodium thiosulfate and ammonium sulfate--NOT expensive ingredients.  If you&#x27;d like the MSDS report, you can find it here:  (...)    There are many alternatives to supporting SonicBrite&#x27;s greedy up-charging.  Google this and you&#x27;ll find many simple recipes for cleaning your mouthpiece (night guard) with household items you probably already have.  Do yourself a favor and save the money.  Yeah, everyone has to make a buck, right?  But if you don&#x27;t want to pay their over-over-inflated price for the refill, just make your own.  Let SonicBrite stick to making these little machines.  Don&#x27;t support the greedy inflated prices on the refill.    By the way, Sonicbrite charges $12.95 for their refill if you purchase from their site directly.</li>
    <li> My wife said she liked this item.  It works real well and I see her use it all the time to clean her retainer.  Well worth whatever I paid for it.  I would definitely recommend it.  Came on time and as stated by seller.  No Problems.</li>
    <li> We use it for our daughter&#x27;s retainer.&lt;br /&gt;Very convenient since it runs on batteries, the sonic cleaning does a great job.&lt;br /&gt;My only recommendation is that the water level mark inside the container be a dark color, it&#x27;s hard to see white on white.</li>
    <li> Use it every day and love the way it works.  I contacted their customer service because one of the little foot pads on the bottom was missing.  They mailed it out immediately and were very pleasant.  The cleaning product that is included works great, but it is slightly expensive.  I have been using it for several months and I believe the expense may be worth it, because I am not sure other brands do as good a job.  I may try a less expensive brand when I run out, and see if I can tell if there is a difference then make a decision.  All in all , I am very please with this product, and would absolutely deal with this company again.</li>
    <li> I have had this unit for a couple years now, it&#x27;s traveled with me internationally countless times and still functions.  When it eventually does give out, I&#x27;ll definitely get another one.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing. Cleaned my retainers great where other products did not. Would most definitely recommend this product to anyone.</li>
    <li> Works great and gives your mouth that soooooooo clean feeling.</li>
    <li> Product came quickly, well packed and is working as described, though only time will tell if it really has an impact on cleaning the mouth guard...or is just a gimmick</li>
    <li> It does what they said it would do.  Does not move around on counter, fairly quite. Would recommend to anyone.</li>
    <li> The container is handy on the counter, and not unattractive. The cleaner junk seems to strong to trust on anything I own, but it came with the container. Won&#x27;t use that, but will use the container.</li>
    <li> I have been using SonicBright for about 5 months now. The cleanser that comes with the unit is useless. It doesn&#x27;t clean my invisalign retainers at all. I decided to take others advice here and tried using Retainer Bright instead. This combined with the SonicBrite does a great job of cleaning my retainers. Now I am satisfied with it and will continue using it. However, if something happens and it stops working, I will probably not purchase it again, nor will I recommend it to others. There is one major design flaw, in my opinion. The cup in which the retainers sit in is very difficult to remove. In order to remove it, I need to grasp it tightly and twist it firmly get it out. For people who have poor dexterity or limited grip in their hands, this is not a good purchase.</li>
    <li> stuff is not that good,smell like clorine,does not clean ,clear night guards as stated,probably will us the machine for cleaning jewelry..it really sucks...</li>
    <li> was on theverge of throwing my mouth gaurd out when I came across this product. I gave it a try an cannot belive the difference it made! My mouth gaurd is like new! It does move across the counter from the vibration; a simple wash clothplaced underneath that fixed that problem. My biggest problem with it is that I forget to turn if &amp;#34;off&amp;#34; once it is done. It will automatically shut off but you are supposed to come back and switch the power button to off. This runs on batteriesonly wich makes it easy yo travel with but I would have preffered a plug in option.</li>
    <li> I recently got Invisilign braces.  This machine cleans them very nicely.  The price was excellent and much cheaper than the one offered by the Invisilgn company.</li>
    <li> I bought the cleaning system for daily use.  I love the product in general.  It kept my new retainer looking new.  It is always fresh tasting after I clean it.  My only complaint Is the battery life of the wash component.  I replace the batteries 1-2 times a week. The cost is outrageous.  I would love a unit that plugs into an outlet.  I wrote a review for the Sonic Brite website and it said it would post pending approval. I gave it 4/5 stars but the review never posted.  I guess the company only posts 5/5 star ratings.</li>
    <li> When I first bought this and tried it out, it didn&#x27;t really help remove the years of build-up on my plastic (?) retainers. So I thought, maybe if I use this daily, it will help. It didn&#x27;t clean up much... it wasn&#x27;t until one day I accidentally forgot to take out the retainers (you&#x27;re only supposed to keep them in there for 15 minutes, but I forgot for about an hour) that I actually noticed a difference. The difference was not immediate until you rinse the retainers with water and leave them alone for the rest of the day or night. After purposely repeating this &amp;#34;mistake&amp;#34; five or six times, it finally removed all the buildup (which is really saying something because I couldn&#x27;t even remove these years of buildup with a knife!). So basically, this is a really nice way to clean your extremely dirty plastic retainers... if you break the rules.</li>
    <li> The timer has never worked! 15 minutes heck, I have run this thing for a solid hour before I had to shut it off myself.  It is very bulky and takes up a lot of room on your bathroom counter-top and it does NOT look good on your counter-top as advertised.  Typical Chinese made cheap junk! This thing should retail for about 10 bucks, then it might be a decent buy, but for almost $ 40.00 I am very unhappy.</li>
    <li> Only downside (I didn&#x27;t read the specifications completely) is that there is not an AC option, batteries only.  The unit does have an auto shutoff feature.</li>
    <li> This product is worth buying if you use dentures or retainers.  I had heavy deposits on my plastic retainers after 3 years of daily cleaning with only a toothbrush.  I put my retainers in hoping that everything would disappear like some of the other reviews claimed.  I did get noticeable reduction in the deposits over the first week, and even one month of use.  As of now, the deposits have not disappeared completely, but seem to be decreasing over time.  I also don&#x27;t use the cleaner solution everyday now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cleaner solution has a bleach smell to it, and I&#x27;d recommend being very careful to not over-soak your retainer/denture.  The surface of your dental device can get damaged and cloudy from the cleaner solution.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Takes 4 AA batteries.  The instructions say to make sure you turn the switch to off after use.  Make sure you do that! Otherwise the batteries will run out quickly.</li>
    <li> I purchased this cleaning system for my 2 year old night guard.  I had cleaned the night guard nearly everyday using a $7.95 sonic (vibrating) device and Retainer Brite. In spite of using the other system on a regular basis, the night guard was stained and had plaque build up.&lt;br /&gt; The SomicBrite system is much more expensive, but it is also more efficient.  I have been using the SonicBrite system for a week.  The night guard does not get magically clean after one or two uses.  After a week, I can see a less staining and much less plaque.  I have been brushing the night guard after the SonicBrite has loosened the plaque.  I am sure the plaque will be completely gone in another few days.&lt;br /&gt; I like that the cleaner has a timed shut off.  It shuts off at about 9 minutes, rather than the stated 15 minutes. It is quieter than the $7.95 unit I previously used.  The rubber feet keep it firmly in place on my vanity counter.  As it is made in China, I do wonder how long it will be until the timer or motor will fail.&lt;br /&gt; The SonicBrite powder that is included definitely smells of bleach.  The instructions warn it can put a bleach spot on clothes.  I have been very careful not to spill any or splash the mix onto anything.  I am also very careful to rinse the solution off the night guard.  I do wish this came in tablet form, so it would be easier to use.&lt;br /&gt; Would I purchase this system again? Yes.  Definitely less expensive than ordering another night guard from the dentist.</li>
