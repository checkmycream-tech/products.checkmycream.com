      <li>I was a little worried by the words &amp;#34;tinted moisturizer&amp;#34; hoping that there would be good enough coverage.  </li>

      <li>I like that it has broad spectrum SPF, as well, to protect my face from sun damage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> It&#x27;s a very good tinted moisturizer.</li>
    <li> I bought this one based on all the glowing reviews, and it&#x27;s actually the most I&#x27;ve ever paid for a concealer. But I was really interested in... not so much concealing as smoothing out a bit. This stuff is everything everyone is saying about it. I&#x27;ll probably buy it forever. No crazy neck lines or cakey-look. Very natural and is just a bit of subtle smoothing out of the complexion. It&#x27;s also not overly shiny which has been a problem for me and liquid creams like this in the past. Love it.</li>
    <li> I absolutely Love this Product, My skin looks smoother, and Younger, Hides my acne very well as if I didn&#x27;t have any AMAZING,and at the same time Give moisture to those dead skin cells, I&#x27;m in love .I was able to get this during a promotion for my honest and unbiased review</li>
    <li> This tinted moisturizer works great on my skin. It goes on smooth and no creases or dry marks.</li>
    <li> There is many benifits to using this Tars tinted moisturizer. First let me start off by saying it is for medium to dark skin tones. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this is you are pale toned as it will come out looking dark. So make sure of your shade. Using the tinted moisturizer It will visibly smooth out lines and wrinkles -Provides natural looking sheer coverage giving skin an instant healthy radiant and youthful appearance - Best flawless cover with long term anti aging active ingredients and vitamins Luxurious foundation with medium to full coverege the tinted moisturizer is great for all skin types. I have sensative skin and experianced no reaction. It makes my Skin look air brushed and gives it an immediate lifted effect.  It Will not clog pores and safe for sensitive skin. I like the way it makes my skin feel hydrated and the moisturizer don&#x27;t clump up. It contains the vitamins A and E Which are beneficial to our face and gives it the proper care that it needs. I use this as my regular foundation sometimes if I don&#x27;t feel like putting on my everyday foundation. I apply it ontop of my bb cream.</li>
    <li> It looks a lot darker than it actually is after applying it. I am fair or light skinned so I did not want anything too dark. This blended into my skin very nicely and had the perfect amount of color. In fact, it looked quite natural. I&#x27;m not sure if this is a tinted moisturizer or a foundation because the description says it&#x27;s both. However, you definitely do not need to put on foundation if you’re going to use this. I like that it has broad spectrum SPF, as well, to protect my face from sun damage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When you first squeeze, be careful that too much does not come out. You need very little or it will be too much for your face. It will also look thick when it comes out but do not worry it doesn&#x27;t look like that on your face. I use a small pea size and that is all I need for my entire face. It did not dry out my skin either. I was able to blend it easily into my skin and it left no lines. This tinted moisturizer or foundation looks quite natural on my skin. However, this product doesn&#x27;t say whether it&#x27;s non-comedogenic or not. I try to use only products that are non-comedogenic so it won&#x27;t clog my pores. That is the only thing that bothers me about this product. This product was received for the purpose of inspection and testing for unbiased review. This review is a reflection of my own personal experience with this product.</li>
    <li> I have been using the Tinted Moisturizer Best Anti Aging Foundation for the past month.  This is an absolutely amazing product and I will never buy traditional foundation ever again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This tinted moisturizer is a daily routine for me now.  I use it everyday and it leaves my skin literally looking flawless.  It also contains an spf 30 which helps with of course damaging uv rays from the sun.  Im in my 40&#x27;s and this has really helped with my fine lines.  The moisturizer is not greasy and goes on easily and blends well into your skin leaving it feeling hydrated and healthy!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was given the Tinted Moisturizer by Tars Cosmetica to test for an honest and unbiased review.  I can&#x27;t say enough about this product except they have gained a customer for life, because when mine runs out Im buying more.  Ladies if you want a quality tinted Moisturizer and your debating on whether to try this product, dont be buy it you wont be disappointed and Tars Cosmetica stands behind their products with a 100% Unconditional Money Back Guarantee so your know your buying a quality product!!!</li>
    <li> This product isn&#x27;t for me. It seems like you need to shake it because it has an oily consistency. People with dry skin will appreciate it.</li>
    <li> It seems really dark straight out of the tube, but is definitely lighter on the skin. Very very light coverage. Also is very... Sunblock-y... Kinda greasy feeling all day. I don&#x27;t use/like conventional sunblock, so wasn&#x27;t a fan.</li>
    <li> Love the sheer coverage does not look so heavy.</li>
    <li> Really like the coverage and texture of this product.  Definitely an all in one face cream.</li>
    <li> Very greasy&lt;br /&gt;Waste of money</li>
    <li> I love how well this Tars Cosmetica foundation moisturizes.  It feels like silk going on my skin.  I was a little worried by the words &amp;#34;tinted moisturizer&amp;#34; hoping that there would be good enough coverage.  This tinted moisturizer works as well as any of my more expensive foundations.  It has great coverage, blends easily and looks so natural on my face.  There&#x27;s just enough moisture yet not too much to give an oily appearance.  I scored a great deal on this foundation for an honest, unbiased review and I am very pleased with it.</li>
    <li> I hate to see old women with make up on. They look like clowns (I think.) I don&#x27;t want to be one. So I stopped wearing makeup a few years ago. But I still use moisturizer. When I saw this product I wanted to try it because I thought it might be nice to have a little color on my face.  I LOVE THIS!  It&#x27;s a lovely moisturizer, adds just a hint of color so it looks natural and it doesn&#x27;t take any longer to apply than the moisturizer I was already using.  I like that it has a sunscreen in it too.</li>
    <li> Age 61, sun damaged, dry, and extremely sensitive skin.... I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased. This is the fourth tinted moisturizer I have tried in a year and this is the only one that  does not break my face out.  You have no idea how happy I am to still be using Tars Tinted Moisturizer instead of tossing it in with my collection of  &amp;#34;I will never use this again... but it was too expensive to throw away&#x27; drawer.  It glides on smoothly and does not settle in my wrinkles.  For those who find it to be too dark, try mixing with a bit of your regular moisturizer before applying to your face.  It does go on a bit shiny and moist, so I use my blow dryer on my face, on the cool setting for about 20 seconds before apply blush.  I have no problem with the few extra seconds it takes after going out to dinner with my girlfriends, and they commented on how pretty my complexion is and that I look younger. (Insert happy dance here)  A complexion that looks healthy and slightly dewy is so much more attractive than a complexion that looks dry.  And no one, especially a woman my age looks good with heavily applied makeup.  This tinted moisturizer is complete, but light coverage, with a healthy glow.</li>
    <li> Color appears too dark for light skin before applying, but it blends in with natural skin tone and not dark at all after application. Good product.</li>
    <li> I bought this based on it&#x27;s good reviews.Live it and will order it again. I love how it looks on my skin. I&#x27;m 60 and don&#x27;t want something that cakes in the wrinkles. This doesn&#x27;t. I love it and will order some before I run out. A little goes a long way. You can apply more for additional coverage after first application.</li>
    <li> liked it so much, bought another - just to have on hand for an overnight bag.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure if this is actually TARS since it doesnt even say it in the bottle I received.</li>
    <li> the moisturizer was a bit dark on me. But that&#x27;s what I get for trying to match my skin tone online. I actually am not too pale, in the world of makeup I am considered a &amp;#34;beige&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;light/medium&amp;#34;. However the product could possibly be considered full &amp;#34;medium&amp;#34;. Very nice product though! Just trying it on, my face felt amazing. I am going to keep, because I think once summer rolls around and I get a good tan, it will be perfect.</li>
    <li> The color is perfect and feels so nice on my skin.</li>
