      <li>I don&#x27;t think the quality is as good as others I have used.</li>
      <li>Good quality product and servicw</li>

      <li>The diamond grit does not go all the way to the edges.&lt;br /&gt;Other than that, it is a nice file.</li>
      <li>Files nails nicely but doesn&#x27;t seem like it will hold up well.  </li>
      <li>I own two of these; one to keep at work (or while traveling), and one at home.</li>
      <li>As most women, I&#x27;ve owned many nail files in my life.</li>
      <li>Yet this one stands apart and is my favorite out of all I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
      <li>All of them are top notch</li>
      <li>My favorite nail file.</li>
      <li>and I have been pleased with all three.</li>
      <li>They all love it.</li>
      <li>It has the perfect texture to shape the nails without extensive filing; it works quickly!</li>
      <li>She was impressed that it only took one stroke to smooth the edges of her nails -</li>
      <li>I use this #2 for my toe nails, it does fine for toes, although many might need something stronger, I don&#x27;t know.  </li>
      <li>From the description and reviews, I expected it to be wonderful.  </li>
      <li>I love the fact that it is long-lasting and easy to clean.</li>
      <li>Just like my review of the number 1, fine file, this doesn&#x27;t work for it&#x27;s intended purpose.  </li>
      <li>It provides a smooth surface, so in that it meets my needs.  </li>
      <li>I am a guitar player and so the condition of my nails has become important.</li>
      <li>I am not as impressed with this file after using it a few times.</li>
      <li>and I have smoothly rounded nails.  </li>
      <li>This is a very useful tool.</li>
      <li>I had originally purchased a #1 and a #2 based on another review, but the #2 was adequate</li>
      <li>I do not find it superior to the emery boards I bought at the local beauty supply store.</li>
      <li>I found this product adequate.  </li>
      <li>Works very well, easy to clean, lasts a decade.</li>
      <li>It takes off a lot of nail quickly.</li>
      <li>file is perfect, and is also very thin so its easy to slide it around nail corners, and for doing toenails.</li>
      <li>Well worth the price.  </li>
      <li>Well worth the price.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s perfect for my thick real nails.</li>
      <li>Just doesn&#x27;t seem worth the price tag.</li>
      <li>this was certainly worth the money.</li>
      <li>Bliss Diamancel Diamond files are worth every penny.  </li>
      <li>Either file, #1 or #2, in my opinion, are well worth the investment.  </li>
      <li>That&#x27;s right.  </li>
      <li>The metal has just the right amount of bend to be forgiving during \\&quot;sanding operations\\&quot;.</li>
      <li>It seems like a lot to pay for a file but this file is well worth the money; cleans up chips and splits easily and professionally.</li>
      <li>Both the No.1 and No. 2 file are very gentle on my nails.  </li>
      <li>the first lasted me 11 years.  </li>
      <li>first one lasted 6 months</li>
      <li>My experience with Diamancel files is positive.</li>
      <li>It is too wide to be tucked easily into a purse, so I keep it by my bedside for quick touchups.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;The #2 nail file is course enough to reduce length of nails and fine enough to file them smooth.</li>
      <li>This file works really well.  </li>
      <li>I recommend highly.</li>
      <li>I doubt I will collect a drawer full of nail files to be the trashed in the near future!</li>
      <li>Just make sure you use it on dry nails, and moisturize the nails and cuticles with oil or cream after (any emolient substance works well for this- even extra virgin olive oil!).</li>
      <li>I&#x27;d rather invest a little more money upfront in a durable product than spend more over time on disposal products that wear out after very few uses.</li>
      <li>I have very fast growing, strong hard nails, and must file them weekly.</li>
      <li>These files use crushed diamonds that never seem to wear out and a quick run under tap water seems to restore them to like-new condition.</li>
      <li>After clipping, it only takes a couple of gentle runs with the file to get things ship-shape.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I realized I had spent more $$ over the years, on useless products than the cost of all three of the &amp;#34;Diamancel Diamond files offered through Amazon (free shipping from the maker).</li>
      <li>I use the number 1 for my finger nails, they are delicate and these files work very well, #1 is good for delicate nails.  </li>
      <li>I spent so much money on every other kind of file, thinking these would be just money down the drain, same old same old</li>
      <li>Metal nail files are rarely fine enough grade to prevent catching and tearing if there are any imperfections in the nail edge (happens a lot when your nails grow stupidly</li>

<li> It should last a long time.</li>
<li> I bought the one for the heels and thought I would try this one for my cuticles because I have such dry skin.  </li>
<li> Several packs of files that were sandpaper-like (glued to card stock or plastic tongue depressor-shapes),  an array of all metal nail files and some with plastic handles—all of which were useless and poorly made—the kind found on display at the supermarket checkout, Big-Lots, T-J Max, Sallies Beauty Supply, and the dollar store.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> I purchased this for my mother-in-law, and she has replaced all of her other files with this one alone.  </li>

<li> Unfortunately, the new Diamond Debs are inferior, so I tried this one.  </li>
<li> My nails destroy emory boards in one use, and plastic files in 3 uses.</li>
<li> Just a few swipes</li>
<li> A few weeks ago, I was freaking out, because my finger nails were splitting, flaking, and cracking.</li>
<li> I&#x27;m not sure you&#x27;d need the #1.</li>
<li> I think my problem is that I remember the unbelievable Diamond Deb of the 70&#x27;s.  </li>
<li> /&gt;Highly recommended versus the cheesy steel file on your $3 nail clipper, the unpleasant sandpaper on disposable files, and even the not bad nail file on your Swiss Army knife.</li>
<li> nail clippers make them split as they are so thick and hard, so I have to have a file.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s thin, flexible, and durable.</li>
<li> So, as I searched for a nail file to remedy the problem, I discarded from my nightstand, all that effectually made worse the nail problem.</li>
<li> And my husbands toe nails are real thick and</li>
<li> but i was wrong.  </li>
<li> I can&#x27;t imagine I&#x27;m doing it wrong.</li>
<li> Sorry I didn&#x27;t buy it sooner.</li>
<li> I&#x27;m sorry I ordered it.</li>
<li> This looks like a stick on file stuck on very thin piece of metal.</li>
<li> This is incredibly disappointing.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Just like my review of the number 1, fine file, this doesn&#x27;t work for it&#x27;s intended purpose.  The ridges do not go all the way to the edge where (in my opinion) it&#x27;s needed.  I&#x27;m sorry I ordered it.</li>
    <li> My experience with Diamancel files is positive. I&#x27;d rather invest a little more money upfront in a durable product than spend more over time on disposal products that wear out after very few uses. I have a #2 and a #1 nail file as well as a foot file and I have been pleased with all three.</li>
    <li> I am in the process of growing out nails after wearing acrylic for twenty-five years.  Both the No.1 and No. 2 file are very gentle on my nails.  A very good product.</li>
    <li> Bought one for a friend, my mom, and my wife.  They all love it.</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my mother-in-law, and she has replaced all of her other files with this one alone.  She was impressed that it only took one stroke to smooth the edges of her nails - this was certainly worth the money.</li>
    <li> This is the best nail file I have had.&lt;br /&gt;The first one lasted 6 months then my wife lost it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The second one she confiscated.&lt;br /&gt;I guess I&#x27;ll have to order another one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;and I am a dude.</li>
    <li> Best nail file I have ever purchased. I will never go back to regular emery boards.&lt;br /&gt;I have brittle nails. However with Bliss Diamancel Diamond Nail file - no problems whatsoever.&lt;br /&gt;Yes, it is pricey - but you will only buy this nail file - once. It is also durable and washable.</li>
    <li> I own two of these; one to keep at work (or while traveling), and one at home. As most women, I&#x27;ve owned many nail files in my life. Yet this one stands apart and is my favorite out of all I&#x27;ve tried. I love the fact that it is long-lasting and easy to clean. It does what it supposed to do, and does it well. Filing your nails, no matter how you do it or with what, wears your nail structure down to some degree. I get the impression that this file minimizes that effect. It has the perfect texture to shape the nails without extensive filing; it works quickly! Just make sure you use it on dry nails, and moisturize the nails and cuticles with oil or cream after (any emolient substance works well for this- even extra virgin olive oil!). This will minimize cracking or breakage. I know the price of this file can be a drawback for some, but this one will outlast any paper emery board or file of lesser quality, thereby sparing you the need to purchase another.</li>
    <li> My favorite nail file. I have very fast growing, strong hard nails, and must file them weekly. nail clippers make them split as they are so thick and hard, so I have to have a file. My nails destroy emory boards in one use, and plastic files in 3 uses. Metal nail files are rarely fine enough grade to prevent catching and tearing if there are any imperfections in the nail edge (happens a lot when your nails grow stupidly fast).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This file is perfect, and is also very thin so its easy to slide it around nail corners, and for doing toenails. I have had one for about 5 years, and just got a second file to keep in my purse.</li>
    <li> I found this product adequate.  From the description and reviews, I expected it to be wonderful.  It provides a smooth surface, so in that it meets my needs.  I think my problem is that I remember the unbelievable Diamond Deb of the 70&#x27;s.  It still was providing great service when I lost it five years ago.  Unfortunately, the new Diamond Debs are inferior, so I tried this one.  It is too wide to be tucked easily into a purse, so I keep it by my bedside for quick touchups.  I do not find it superior to the emery boards I bought at the local beauty supply store.</li>
    <li> This file works really well.  Just a few swipes and I have smoothly rounded nails.  I keep my nails short so I trim them often.  It works on toe nails too.</li>
    <li> A few weeks ago, I was freaking out, because my finger nails were splitting, flaking, and cracking. So, as I searched for a nail file to remedy the problem, I discarded from my nightstand, all that effectually made worse the nail problem. I tried, then tossed nail file after nail file into the trash! Several packs of files that were sandpaper-like (glued to card stock or plastic tongue depressor-shapes),  an array of all metal nail files and some with plastic handles—all of which were useless and poorly made—the kind found on display at the supermarket checkout, Big-Lots, T-J Max, Sallies Beauty Supply, and the dollar store.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did the math. I realized I had spent more $$ over the years, on useless products than the cost of all three of the &amp;#34;Diamancel Diamond files offered through Amazon (free shipping from the maker). However, I purchased just the NO.-2 Medium grain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What a delight!  In seconds, I rough-cut and shaped my nails. Only one side to this flexible, all metal tool. When finished, I washed the &amp;#34;dust residue&amp;#34; from the tool and it is good to go. Well worth the price. I doubt I will collect a drawer full of nail files to be the trashed in the near future!</li>
    <li> This is not a metal file.  This is sand paper glued to a plastic backing.  The sand paper does not reach the edge of the plastic backing.  For the price, I was expecting a quality product.  This is incredibly disappointing.</li>
    <li> I am not as impressed with this file after using it a few times. I don&#x27;t think the quality is as good as others I have used.</li>
    <li> Awesome!! Sorry I didn&#x27;t buy it sooner. I would buy another without hesitation. I&#x27;m not sure you&#x27;d need the #1. As I think #2 is good and versatile</li>
    <li> I got this because I had read that diamond files are so much better for your nails and that they work so great and honestly, I couldn&#x27;t tell a difference. I can&#x27;t imagine I&#x27;m doing it wrong. Just doesn&#x27;t seem worth the price tag.</li>
    <li> Works well. Flexier than I anticipated.</li>
    <li> Files nails nicely but doesn&#x27;t seem like it will hold up well.  This looks like a stick on file stuck on very thin piece of metal.</li>
    <li> I just ordered my 2nd file...the first lasted me 11 years.  That&#x27;s right.  After 11 years, I am just now replacing this file.  Exceeded expectations.  Works very well, easy to clean, lasts a decade.</li>
    <li> It seems like a lot to pay for a file but this file is well worth the money; cleans up chips and splits easily and professionally.</li>
    <li> I bought the one for the heels and thought I would try this one for my cuticles because I have such dry skin.  It works great.  And my husbands toe nails are real thick and this works great for that.</li>
    <li> This file is the best I&#x27;ve owned! It&#x27;s thin, flexible, and durable. It is washable. It&#x27;s perfect for my thick real nails. It should last a long time.</li>
    <li> I have 3 different Diamancel products: a foot buffer #20, a callous rasp #5, and this #2 nail file. All of them are top notch and I recomend Diamncel products highly!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The #2 nail file is course enough to reduce length of nails and fine enough to file them smooth. I had originally purchased a #1 and a #2 based on another review, but the #2 was adequate and I returned the #1 unused.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a very good product and finishes quickly to polish the nails perfectly.</li>
    <li> Well worth the price.  I use the number 1 for my finger nails, they are delicate and these files work very well, #1 is good for delicate nails.  I use this #2 for my toe nails, it does fine for toes, although many might need something stronger, I don&#x27;t know.  Either file, #1 or #2, in my opinion, are well worth the investment.  I spent so much money on every other kind of file, thinking these would be just money down the drain, same old same old just more expensive - but i was wrong.  Bliss Diamancel Diamond files are worth every penny.  I recommend highly.</li>
    <li> The diamond grit does not go all the way to the edges.&lt;br /&gt;Other than that, it is a nice file.</li>
    <li> Good quality product and servicw</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not big on personal grooming. I got written up for \\&quot;slovenly work habits\\&quot; back in the 70s when I was just starting out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But I am a guitar player and so the condition of my nails has become important. These files use crushed diamonds that never seem to wear out and a quick run under tap water seems to restore them to like-new condition. The metal has just the right amount of bend to be forgiving during \\&quot;sanding operations\\&quot;. After clipping, it only takes a couple of gentle runs with the file to get things ship-shape.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended versus the cheesy steel file on your $3 nail clipper, the unpleasant sandpaper on disposable files, and even the not bad nail file on your Swiss Army knife.</li>
    <li> If you don&#x27;t lose it will last a long time. This is a very useful tool. Would recommend it as it has already outlasted several disposable files. It takes off a lot of nail quickly.</li>
