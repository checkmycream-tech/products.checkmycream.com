      <li>I can&#x27;t say enough how great this creme is</li>
      <li>Since Glytone Nail and Cuticle cream is no longer available, I tried this Creme Abricot Fortifying Cream for Nails.  </li>
      <li>I was excited to receive the creme Abricot cream.  </li>
      <li>This is pure magic in a container</li>
      <li>This is a true luxury.</li>
      <li>really works!,height of luxury and effectiveness!!</li>
      <li>Hope you enjoy this product as much as I have.</li>
      <li>, I am here to tell you it is worth it.</li>
      <li>Well worth the money.</li>
      <li>Well worth the price.</li>
      <li>My nails are strong with soft cuticles.  </li>
      <li>but this cream has really helped my nails to grow!</li>
      <li>Tried the Burts Bees one first because I wanted to save money.  </li>
      <li>The peach creamy lotion turns to a different texture over time and gets more orange as time passes</li>
      <li>And I find the scent pleasing (strong in the container, barely noticeable on the fingers).</li>
      <li>read about this crème in a lifestyles book -suffered a toe injury at a social gathering (someone stepped on my foot) and my nail was extremely injured-I have been using this as described and my nail is recovering-- healthy growth with no sign of nail damage-worth every cent!!</li>
      <li>Did not have any positive effect on my nails or cuticles.</li>
      <li>BUT it does last for many many months for a little</li>
      <li>I have had a hard time finding this product in stores recently and was thrilled to be able to order it online.  </li>
      <li>nothing really worked.</li>
      <li>I have used creme abricot for years and owe the smooth and pearl-like quality of my nails to this Christian Dior product.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
      <li>Did absolutely nothing.  </li>
      <li>really like it ！</li>
      <li>So far, I&#x27;m pleased--my cuticles look better than they did prior to my using it.  </li>
      <li>New acquaintances cannot believe that my nails are real.  </li>
      <li>Almond oil seems to work much better, and costs less.</li>
      <li>But now that I&#x27;m older, age is taking it&#x27;s toll</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s sticky initially, but gets absorbed into the nails.  </li>
      <li>My wife is a very high opinion of this cream and will certainly be buying it in the future.</li>
      <li>It lasts a long time and is worth the price.</li>
      <li>The only product that really works for me!  </li>
      <li>I have used this product for nearly 13 years and always have three on hand.</li>
      <li>This product really works for those of us whose nails seem to split or break constantly.  </li>
      <li>The only one that really worked for me was Christian Dior&#x27;s Creme Abricot Fortifying Cream for Nails.  </li>

<li> I had used this same product decades ago &amp; it really saved my cuticles when dog grooming was tough on my hands.  </li>

<li> My cuticles are very dry, sometimes cracked and always ragged, UNTIL NOW!</li>
<li> nourishing creme moisterizes the nail itself, and smoothes ridges that form on nails due to dryness.  </li>
<li> For such a small container, it lasts for months.</li>
<li> Then I tried some other 10 dollar brand.</li>
<li> It leaves a slight stickiness, but soon melts in to the nailbeds.</li>

<li> From 5 dollar to 30 dollar with no success, UNTIL NOW!  </li>
<li> My nails are always dry and brittle and the cuticles even worse.  </li>
<li> Used to put this on my grandmothers nails when I was a little girl in the sixties!</li>
<li> Not sure it did anything.</li>
<li> It might work, but can&#x27;t get past the sticky texture.</li>
<li> The small container lasts forever</li>
<li> it is da small miracle-maker.</li>
<li> If you want to reduce cuticle dryness and slow the growth of culicles, this product does wonders.</li>
<li> Today&#x27;s price is ridiculous</li>
<li> I was disappointed with the return procedure at Sephora store, they only wanted to give me a credit for my item, so I ended up pick up something else in the store.  </li>
<li> I have really bad nails due to thyroid issue (believe my grandma did too) and this cream works miracles.</li>
<li> But the difference is dramatic &amp; almost immediate.  </li>
<li> Will it cure every ill?  </li>
<li> Expensive.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Sticky but great for my cuticles.</li>
    <li> I tried several products before, also vitamins but nothing really worked. I have been using this for almost two months together with nail conditioner. The nail conditioning system works because my nails are not sppliting anymore but this cream has really helped my nails to grow!</li>
    <li> My nails are always dry and brittle and the cuticles even worse.  This is pure magic in a container and I&#x27;m hooked for life.</li>
    <li> This product is great for restoring moist nice looking cuticles.  I have had a hard time finding this product in stores recently and was thrilled to be able to order it online.  I use it three times daily and in just three days I have noticed an improvement.</li>
    <li> I had used this same product decades ago &amp; it really saved my cuticles when dog grooming was tough on my hands.  I guess at some point I ran out, got out of the habit &amp; didn&#x27;t reorder as my work changed &amp; my hands didn&#x27;t take such a beating.  But now that I&#x27;m older, age is taking it&#x27;s toll &amp; I thought of it.  It is again working it&#x27;s magic.  Will it cure every ill?  No.  But the difference is dramatic &amp; almost immediate.  Since you only need the barest film over the cuticle area each night, it goes an extraordinarily long way &amp; so is cost effective for the results.  And I find the scent pleasing (strong in the container, barely noticeable on the fingers).</li>
    <li> read about this crème in a lifestyles book -suffered a toe injury at a social gathering (someone stepped on my foot) and my nail was extremely injured-I have been using this as described and my nail is recovering-- healthy growth with no sign of nail damage-worth every cent!!</li>
    <li> This product really works for those of us whose nails seem to split or break constantly.  I&#x27;ve tried everything and this is it!  Works!&lt;br /&gt;You do need to use it daily sometimes twice daily in the winter months. You won&#x27;t regret the cost!</li>
    <li> I have used this product, Dior Creme Abricot, for over 30 years.  It is the absolute best.  My nails are strong with soft cuticles.  New acquaintances cannot believe that my nails are real.  I use it at night after I take my nail polish off and the next morning my nails and cuticles feel like a miracle occurred.  The small container lasts forever so it is a really good value for a wonderful product.  Hope you enjoy this product as much as I have.</li>
    <li> I have used creme abricot for years and owe the smooth and pearl-like quality of my nails to this Christian Dior product.&lt;br /&gt;This nourishing creme moisterizes the nail itself, and smoothes ridges that form on nails due to dryness.  Beautiful nails are very important.</li>
    <li> This cream is great for softening my cuticles and nourishing my nails.  My hands look great and feel even better.  Fantastic product!!</li>
    <li> This leaves your nails and cuticles looking moisterized and healthy.  It leaves a slight stickiness, but soon melts in to the nailbeds.</li>
    <li> This is icky-sticky stuff. It might work, but can&#x27;t get past the sticky texture.</li>
    <li> Excellent!!  The only product that really works for me!  Wish it wasn&#x27;t so pricey.</li>
    <li> Used to put this on my grandmothers nails when I was a little girl in the sixties! Best out there and I love the apricot scent! I do remember purchasing it in my twenties for 6 or 8 bucks. Today&#x27;s price is ridiculous BUT it does last for many many months for a little dap goes a long way. I have really bad nails due to thyroid issue (believe my grandma did too) and this cream works miracles. Thank you CD!</li>
    <li> I love this product.  The cream stays put around the cuticles.  You can tissue off the excess.  I have used oils in the past, but it is messy and doesn&#x27;t stay very long.&lt;br /&gt;You have to have the discipline to do this every night, both fingernails and toenails.  You will be very happy with the result as you will have healthy nails because the cream nourishes the cuticle.</li>
    <li> This is a true luxury. The scent is transporting. The texture silky. And there isn&#x27;t a more effective product for this purpose. There are lots of apricot wannabees in this category. But they bear no resemblance to this.</li>
    <li> I love this cream!  My nails feel much stronger and my cuticles are the best they have been in years!</li>
    <li> I have used this nail creme before and I think it is the best of its kind. I recomend it glady to everyone.</li>
    <li> the best nail cream around.</li>
    <li> Great product.  Keeps my cuticles soft especially in the winter.  Fewer hang nails.  I&#x27;ve been using Creme Abricot for 4 years and absolutely love it.  I even have my husband using it.  LOL</li>
    <li> Best nutrition for nails!</li>
    <li> Excellent product - have been using for many - many years..</li>
    <li> really great product..has probably been around for 50 years...what a classic..just love it,,something i&#x27;d pack to take to a desert island! really works!,height of luxury and effectiveness!!</li>
    <li> Since Glytone Nail and Cuticle cream is no longer available, I tried this Creme Abricot Fortifying Cream for Nails.  I apply it at night before bed and rub it in well to the cuticles.  It&#x27;s sticky initially, but gets absorbed into the nails.  So far, I&#x27;m pleased--my cuticles look better than they did prior to my using it.  I&#x27;m not sure about my problematic finger nails, in general, but time will tell.</li>
    <li> I have had brittle nails and a terrible time with my cuticles for years.  Tried at least ten to fifteen different products.  The only one that really worked for me was Christian Dior&#x27;s Creme Abricot Fortifying Cream for Nails.  Within two weeks my nails were stronger and my cuticles looked so much better!</li>
    <li> I love this product! I just received this last week and can already tell a difference.  The moisture lasts all day through hand washing and everything!  I have to tell you:  I HAVE TRIED EVERY PRODUCT KNOWN TO MAN FOR CUTICLES!  From 5 dollar to 30 dollar with no success, UNTIL NOW!  I was very skeptical, I am here to tell you it is worth it. My cuticles are very dry, sometimes cracked and always ragged, UNTIL NOW!</li>
    <li> I have used this product for nearly 13 years and always have three on hand. One for home, one for handbag, and one for the office. If you want to reduce cuticle dryness and slow the growth of culicles, this product does wonders. I have found the creme greatly strenghtens nails. For such a small container, it lasts for months. Well worth the price.</li>
    <li> Not sure it did anything. Expensive. Smells good. My sister uses it and likes it.  Would not buy it again.</li>
    <li> really like it ！smells perfect</li>
    <li> I was excited to receive the creme Abricot cream.  I was disappointed with the smell, it was a fragrance I could not get use to.  I had to return it.  I know others say they get pass the smell, but I just couln&#x27;t.  I was disappointed with the return procedure at Sephora store, they only wanted to give me a credit for my item, so I ended up pick up something else in the store.  Long store short I will never be ordering anything from Amazon that sephora is the one that ships.</li>
    <li> Best for cuticles I have found.</li>
    <li> Best product ever to condition cuticles and  nails.</li>
    <li> Did not have any positive effect on my nails or cuticles. Almond oil seems to work much better, and costs less.</li>
    <li> This is the best product to use if you want strong healthy nails.  It lasts a long time and is worth the price.</li>
    <li> hsve previously I hsve usedthis product.  it is da small miracle-maker.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this cuticle creme for 20 years. No joke, This lasts for years. The peach creamy lotion turns to a different texture over time and gets more orange as time passes but it still works. I can&#x27;t say enough how great this creme is</li>
    <li> My wife is a very high opinion of this cream and will certainly be buying it in the future.</li>
    <li> Excellent. Use daily.</li>
    <li> Tried the Burts Bees one first because I wanted to save money.  Then I tried some other 10 dollar brand. Did absolutely nothing.  Three days using this and it is already showing better results than 2 weeks with Burts.  Will definitely repurchase. Well worth the money.</li>
