    <li> Super helpful. They are fantastic, no more wasted drops and makes my loading capsules much easier and faster!!! I highly recommend them for regularly used bottles and loading veggie caps.</li>
    <li> Just what I needed.  Some essential oils come with a plastic drip controller in the neck of the 10 ml bottle.  Sometimes the oil still drips out too much for my needs, like when I want just a dab for a blemish.  I remove the drip controller and replace the original screw on cap with one of these glass droppers from Plant Therapy.  Perfect fit.  Perfect control  with dispensing.</li>
