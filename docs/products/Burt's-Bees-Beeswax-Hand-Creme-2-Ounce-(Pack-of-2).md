<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> My knuckles had become very dry this winter.  This hand cream is very soothing and has a nice smell...my hands are nice and smooth again...great product!</li>
    <li> Great for my hands that get super dry from washing dishes. I love the almond smell, which goes away after a while so it&#x27;s not overpowering. The cream does not leave my skin oily if I use a small amount.</li>
    <li> Nice natural scent and great for winter weather.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing for your feet, hands, anywhere you need to make your skin feel better.  Especially good for dry skin and calloused hands and feet.</li>
    <li> I live in Wisconsin and have two dogs that I walk most every day - no matter the weather.  Needless to say, my hands get very, very dry and chapped.  This product is the only thing that I&#x27;ve found that really helps and the smell is absolute  heaven!!</li>
    <li> I love this lotion.  I have really terrible skin (excema, psoriasis, other allergies) and it&#x27;s one of the only brands that moisturizes well enough and doesn&#x27;t bother me.  Was a little disappointed that one of the jars came busted, but it was too much trouble to return it.</li>
    <li> I was having itchy, red dry hands and the dermatologist tried me on a bunch of medicines.  Nothing worked. Within days of using this handcreme, my hands smoothed out and soothed out.  I use it every night and have for years.  I write a review so that more people will buy it and Burt&#x27;s Bees won&#x27;t even consider ever taking this product off the market!</li>
    <li> I use this product everyday and it is great for my hands.  It keeps the wrinkles that come from hand sanitizer and washing my hands repeatedly away.  It is very creamy so just a little will work but I make it a bedtime ritual and some don&#x27;t like the smell.  I do.  Enjoy.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff, I&#x27;ve been using it for years. Its the only non steroidal product that actually helps to control the hereditary eczema that I have on my hands. When I&#x27;m not using it I always have bumps and itchy skin, when I do my bumps are gone and my hands are silky soft. That said, this is probably not the cream for everyone. Some may find it greasy as it does take a little while to soak in and during that time period you cannot touch anything. The smell is also very strong, the almond smell is so strong and sweet smelling that it reminds me of cherry candy. It is a very thick cream so may be best suited for those with very dry hands or eczema problems like mine. None of the cons bother me enough to stop using it.</li>
    <li> My family has used Burt&#x27;s Bees products for many years and have been satisfied with them, and we decided to try the hand creme and so far we are pleased with this product from Burt&#x27;s Bees.</li>
    <li> Love Bert&#x27;s Bees products.  This one is great for my dry-skinned face.</li>
    <li> I love this hand cream for my cracked fingertip during winter season.</li>
    <li> I have very dry skin in general and I use this on my face. This is by far the best thing I&#x27;ve found for a youthful glow. I put it on twice a day and dab away the greasy layer after applying, leaving a beautiful glow. I&#x27;m 36 and people always think I&#x27;m in my 20&#x27;s. This will be my go-to until they stop making it.</li>
    <li> I first found out about this wonderful product when I received a sample gift box for Christmas. I loved it since the first time I have used it, and ended up ordering two full 2oz sizes. It is a thick cream that is delicately scented like sweet almonds and feels so great on dry hands. It literally feels like the dry cracks are being filled. I find that taking a pinky swipe through it works nicely because as it warms up on your skin it melts and spreads more easily, thus needing less than you think. This is a fabulous hand cream. Works great on elbows, too! You won&#x27;t be sorry for your purchase!</li>
    <li> This stuff works great, takes very little and is not greasy like most lotions.&lt;br /&gt;Also one application is usually good for a couple days..least for me.</li>
    <li> I buy this to use as part of my first aid kit. A family friend that has been an RN for many years suggested this to many. I burnt my hand severely. I tried putting it in a pitcher of ice water for 3 hours. Every time I lifted my hand out of the pitcher it felt like it was on FIRE. After the 3 hours I called her up to see what she recommended. She told me to put this on generously and this put a clean sock over my hand. WOW as soon as I put the sock on I got instant, and I do mean INSTANT relief. Ever since I have recommended and know several people now who use it as part of their first aid kit also.</li>
    <li> The little bee is really good, such as propaganda and introduce the same aroma, very good</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a huge Burt&#x27;s Bees fan and this hand creme is one of the reasons why.  I love the sweet smell of it and enjoy putting it on before I go to bed along with my Burt&#x27;s Bees cotton gloves.  I am a compulsive hand washer so my hands are always dry and cracking.  This creme helps me wake up with baby soft hands.  I always keep this on hand (ha ha) to keep my hands looking and smelling nice.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite hand cream but it is hard to find in stores. It has a nice smell to me but not everyone likes the smell of almonds.</li>
    <li> Love the scent, love the feel, love the quality! Could not recommend this more!</li>
    <li> All natural, best moisturizer I&#x27;ve ever used.  I am diabetic and my hands dry out quickly.  This hand crème is great.</li>
    <li> Contains milk.  Description and ingredients on amazon do not list this.  My husband is deathly allergic so the product is useless. Would not have purchased if I had known.</li>
    <li> Wonderful product to use before retiring.  It is concentrated and your hands will remain a little greasy....NOT BADLY.  It is just a product that I would not recommend to use if you&#x27;re going out or after washing your hands throughout the day.  But at night...I was really impressed with the results.  Really great for cuticles.</li>
    <li> Amazing- like all Burts Bees products. Smells soo good, very almondy.</li>
    <li> Gives the pampering that my tired hands need.</li>
    <li> I think this one of the best hand creams I&#x27;ve used. My hands get really dry from doing daily chores and such and this cream the stuff my hands thirst for! It smells good, feels great going on and once it&#x27;s rubbed in leaves no greasy feeling. I have even used it on my feet and it&#x27;s wonderful! Takes care of all the roughness and makes my skin feel great! Wonderful product!!</li>
    <li> For my mother.She loved it</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had itching and this is the only thing that helps.  A great product.</li>
    <li> I love this hand cream. It lasts forever and it has a subtle dreamy smell. I love going to sleep each night with the smell of this cream on my hands. I also gave this item as teacher&#x27;s gift during the Minnesota winter and it was a hit! Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> I LOVE Burt&#x27;s Bees products, and when I was looking for a heavy duty hand cream for my chapped hands I decided to give this a try.  I was VERY disappointed.  The worst part is the smell.  I swear it smells like gasoline with a hint of almond, but whatever it is I did not find it pleasant.  I also found it very greasy, thick, and slow to absorb.  It worked OK for my cracked cuticles, but it felt gross on my fingers and palms.  So far this sounds like a one star review, but I have found a second life for this two pack has a heavy duty foot cream.  I put a thinner lotion on first that absorbs quickly, and then use this as additional moisture and as a sealant before going to bed, and it has worked really well - just wear a pair of socks or you will get your sheets greasy.  Not good enough for me to buy again, but at least good enough to get through this purchase.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this in the past but this batch (I got the two pack) was terrible!  The sweet, pleasant scent it&#x27;s suppose to have was definitely not there this time.  In fact, I put some on at work and soon after someone sat beside me and said, &amp;#34;Why does it smell like wet weeds in here?&amp;#34;  It was this hand creme!!!  It was also hard on the top and full of liquid on the bottom...as if the ingredients separated.  Stirring it did not help.  Very disappointed with this purchase.</li>
    <li> Burt&#x27;s Bees Almond Milk Beeswax Hand Creme is by far and above the best product for dry hands. Winter is always tough on skin, and this winter has been especially rough on my poor hands. I purchased this last month when my hands were extremely dry. I liked the fact that it wasn&#x27;t heavily scented...the fresh, almond fragrance is not overwhelming at all. I also liked the fact that the first ingredient listed is &amp;#34;sweet almond oil&amp;#34; and not water. For me, lotions that are made predominantly of water just don&#x27;t do the trick. I was looking for something more substantial, and I found it in the Almond Milk Beeswax Hand Creme.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It comes in a small pot, but there tons of uses packed in that small container, since you need just the tiniest bit. It&#x27;s very dense, but spreads very easily once it hits the warmth of your hands. And it doesn&#x27;t leave your hands sticky, which is important to me. I&#x27;m not leaving gooey fingerprints all over my keyboard or my phone. This creme disappears smoothly into your skin, leaving a layer of protection, and your hands feel much softer immediately. Lo and behold, my annoying, dry hands of winter are gone! You&#x27;ll pay a bit more for this product, but for me, if it works well, I don&#x27;t mind spending the money. This one works very well and I can&#x27;t say enough good things about it.</li>
    <li> I love this product. I use it at night while I sleep to make my hands soft. I like the almond smell and I appreciate the social justice issues addressed by the company.</li>
    <li> Same size as the one I bought in the store.actually it might look tiny but only a little quantity of the cream ,u can soften ur hands over a night.</li>
    <li> I love this cream.  It lasts and really works well.  Unfortunately, I couldn&#x27;t get through one whole jar because the scent is just too overwhelming.  I love the scent but if I put it on my hands, I have to avoid my face -- it&#x27;s really, really strong.  Even my husband complains!</li>
    <li> New favorite hand cream!  Has a creamy rather than greasy consistency and works very well.  It has a light fairly neutral smell.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for several years, especially in the winter. This was reasonably priced and great that it comes in packs of two!</li>
    <li> Love this product! One of the best hand creams you can find. It smells good too!</li>
    <li> This stuff works wonders on my dry, chapped hands and smells great too!  I smooth some on before going to bed, slip a pair of socks over my hands, and in the morning my hands are soft and smooth again.</li>
    <li> This makes your hands feel good, but use it before bed, or when you have 15 minutes to rub it in. I put it in the microwave to soften it. It is quite hard. But it does make your hands feel nice once you get it rubbed in. I don&#x27;t think I would buy it again.</li>
    <li> I work in a hospital and my hands are usually raw and cracked, especially during the winter. I started using this creme at night about 2 weeks ago, and my hands have healed so much! They don&#x27;t hurt like they used to. The product is made from natural oils and has a neutral scent. Would definitely recommend it!</li>
    <li> Hands feel soft and smooth in the morning. Have very dry hands so after a week of using this hand cream at night peeling skin was gone!</li>
    <li> It has a nice smell and spreads on easily. It is great for treating dry skin. It only takes a very small dab to apply to each hand.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing!  I use it daily as a lip moisturizer and I buy some for my dad because he gets really dry skin on his face.  This stuff is AMAZING! It works SO good at remoisturizing!</li>
    <li> I have very dry hands.  Actually, right around wherever I put my rings, it gets so dry it gets cracked and is very painful.  I used this hand creme (after trying other products that did not work) and my cracked fingers aren&#x27;t cracked anymore and my hands are actually beginning to feel smooth!  Great product.  Yes it&#x27;s greasy, but I&#x27;ll take that over having cracked hands any day.  Plus, it smells fantastic!!</li>
    <li> A little too tacky for my taste. Smells great and works fairly well, but is a bit expensive to not be the &amp;#34;perfect&amp;#34; cream for my hands.</li>
    <li> I like it!  I&#x27;ve been using this hand creme two or three times a day for about three weeks, and it has a very noticeable effect.  My hands get pretty abused from rock climbing (and rock climbing chalk,) and this stuff works wonders for healing and re-hydration.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, it does have some issue absorbing into my skin (and leaves my hands greasy for a while) unless I wash my hands immediately before applying, which makes it a little impractical.  For that purpose, I prefer Burt&#x27;s Bees Hand Salve, which seems to soak right in without the greasy residue, no matter how dirty my hands are.  I use the Almond Milk Hand Creme at home, after showers and before bed.  This is more of an every day creme, while I consider the Hand Salve an emergency or on-the-go solution.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also smells amazing, and by amazing, I mean... like cherries?  Weird.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At the risk of sounding like a Burt&#x27;s Bees shill, I&#x27;ll stop here...</li>
    <li> I love this handcream.  I was getting very dried out hands from constant handwashing that even my intensive hand creams that I had wouldn&#x27;t touch - rough, raised spots that were cracking and painful.  I bought this on a whim, since I&#x27;ve liked most things Burt&#x27;s Bees has done, but I was a bit nervous about the &#x27;beeswax&#x27; part, thinking it might be a more solid jar of cream like some cocoa butter formulations I&#x27;ve had from other companies.  Not this, this is smooth as silk, and a little dab will do you, so the jar goes a long way!  A few days later and my rough spots are almost gone and I love the sweet scent.  I am thinking of buying some for my mom for Christmas.</li>
    <li> I bought the 2-pack thinking I would love Burt&#x27;s Bee&#x27;s beeswax hand creme, but alas, unlike the other raving reviewers, I found the creme to leave too much residue on my hands. it&#x27;s impossible to DO anything after applying it, as it wipes off on everything (smudges on keyboard and everything else you choose to touch). I guess I just am too busy to wait while the stuff absorbs. Also, I don&#x27;t have any medical condition, just dry hands. Maybe it&#x27;s \\&quot;too much\\&quot; for a little winter dry hand.  On the upside, it does have a nice smell and I like the jar it comes in, easy to grab as much or as little of the stuff as you want. If you apply it right before you go to bed it works well overnight, but beware of rubbing it off onto your sheets.</li>
    <li> This is a very nice, rich hand cream. Wonderful for the winter. My only complaint is that it leaves my hands a bit greasy for a while after use.</li>
    <li> A Lilttle goes a long way, makes your skin soft .  i will be ordering some more</li>
    <li> I love the product. It&#x27;s at my local pharmacy infrequently. I work with my hands and the creme is great for dry hands.</li>
    <li> The effect this &amp;#34;creme&amp;#34; has on my hands, is unmistakable, but it is greasy.  It takes a while for it to absorb into my skin.  If your room temp is cooler, this product is more like a balm than a creme.  It also has a different smell, it&#x27;s not just the smell of almond.  The honey smell from the beeswax comes through, as well as the &amp;#34;fragrance&amp;#34; they add, and the grapefruit extract.  So if you are expecting the soothing smell of almond, be forewarned, the scent it has is a little more energizing.  It&#x27;s a nice smell, just not what I was expecting.  And a little goes a very long way.  Good for scratchy elbows too.</li>
    <li> I love Burt&#x27;s Bees products and think they work very well. I ordered this cream based on customer reviews-- plus I usually like almond-scented products; however, I felt this one was overpowering. My husband commented on the smell (not in a good way) and even my golden retriever, who usually goes nuts when anyone uses hand cream or body lotion, turned away from this one. I thought that was funny-- but I completely understood because I couldn&#x27;t stand smelling it myself. The product itself works well to soothe dry skin, although it remains a bit greasier than the Shea Hand Repair Cream. So, even though I&#x27;m keeping it, I really prefer several other products by Burt&#x27;s Bees and will NOT be buying this one again.</li>
    <li> This stuff is absolutely GREAT for dry hands.  Absorbs well, and it smells so good!!  A little goes a long way though, so use wisely, or you may have greasy hands!</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! Smells good and makes my hands so soft.</li>
    <li> This is an wonderful night time, super thick, hydrating, oily hand and cuticle treatment.  I use it every night at bedtime with cotton gloves and in the morning my hands are super soft and my cuticles look hydrated.  This cream is not for day time use because you will be leaving greasy finger prints everywhere but it is outstanding for overnight hydrating hand/cuticle treatment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, the smell is so off putting to me, I can&#x27;t stand it!  I &amp;#34;deal&amp;#34; with the smell because the product is really good for my hands and cuticles but I will not be repurchasing it purely because of the way it smells.  I can&#x27;t describe it, it does not &amp;#34;stink&amp;#34; but it does not smell nice either.  I&#x27;ve had my jar for well over a year and I use it every night and a little bit goes a long way.  I wish they would somehow change the smell or even make it scentless.  Then I would for sure repurchase it in a heart beat!</li>
    <li> I love this product. I work with money all day and my hands are constantly dry. This hand cream leaves my hand moist without oily film.</li>
    <li> My husband has sensitive skin so many moisturizers and balms do not work. This is the first product he has been able to use without  his skin stinging afterwards. It smells similar to frosting so it doesn&#x27;t have a bad after scent. It does leave a slight greasy residue on your skin. Overall, we like it.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite hand cream.  I have eczema and use this on my face too, and it&#x27;s the first product that has really relieved the dryness in my face and hands.  It absorbs well in minutes so I&#x27;m able to use my touch pad kindle minutes after applying this without a greasy residue.  I keep one in the bathroom, by the kitchen sink, on my bed shelf, at my desk, and in my purse.  Try it for your really dry skin and it should help you too.</li>
    <li> The best, but greasy so I only use at night.</li>
    <li> I love all Burts Bees products but this one is great. It smells wonderful and is thick and creamy without being greasy and it absorbs very well. I would defintitely recommend this product :)</li>
    <li> Almond smell is wonderful!! Cream is a little thicker than I&#x27;m used to, but it lasts a long time and repairs dry hands.</li>
    <li> Excellent&lt;br /&gt;Product design humane, quality and price amount, suitable for children. Beautifully packaged, safe to use.  like it very much.</li>
    <li> Thick, creamy, really works and my skin doesn&#x27;t break out for once. It can leave a little grease but it absorbs relatively quickly.</li>
    <li> I have super dry hands, and this is the first cream I&#x27;ve found that REALLY feels like it does the trick. It has a wonderful almond scent. Bee-ware of the scent if you&#x27;re outdoors though - it did actually attract bees! (I&#x27;m not kidding)</li>
    <li> I have sweaty hands and I need to use hand cream a lot to prevent cracks created from dry to wet so often. This is so far the best handcream I found. It is thick, all natural, and not greasy.</li>
    <li> I purchased one jar and absolutely loved it. I work in health care so I&#x27;m constantly washing my hands and it&#x27;s very hard for me to find a product that moisturizes well.  This product does the job quite nicely. At first it&#x27;s a little greasy, but soon absorbs. A little goes a long way! The smell is also wonderful. Smells exactly like Jergens original cherry almond except has way better results. I was excited to see two jars for $14 considering I paid $10 for one at a local store. These two jars won&#x27;t go to waste. Complete happiness!</li>
    <li> This is a very nice product.  It does soften your hands.  I find it heavy so I use it sparingly during the day. I take a small amount and rub it into my cuticles first.  The heat from my hands starts to \\&quot;liquify\\&quot; the cream and then I rub it all over my hands until it&#x27;s absorbed.  It&#x27;s not the fastest absorbing hand cream so be patient and don&#x27;t use too much.  If I use it at night before going to bed I&#x27;m a little more liberal with the amount I apply. It does have an almond scent but not a \\&quot;sweet\\&quot; almond fragrance. If you don&#x27;t over apply a 2 oz. jar will last long enough to justify the price.</li>
    <li> I like the scent and does a good job moisturizing my skin. My only complaint is that it can leave your skin greasy if you put on too much.</li>
    <li> Love the product.  The price was right.  The product is of high quality.  Will reorder when my supply is exhausted</li>
    <li> Will stay same consistency when stored in the car or pocket book and works and smells great!</li>
    <li> I used to love this cream, especially the banana scented one. Recently I learned that the small, much loved company sold out to Clorox(that&#x27;s right, the bleach manufacturers). I&#x27;m very disappointed, and I think the quality has gone down since then.</li>
    <li> I use this on my feet &amp; it makes them SO SOFT. Great for someone who stands all day. Love!</li>
    <li> I swear by this stuff. It smells amazing, is natural, and isn&#x27;t greasy. I highly recommend this if you&#x27;ve never tried it before.</li>
    <li> I was thinking this product would be a thick moisturizer perhaps replacing petrolium jelly. But this seems to suck the moisture out</li>
    <li> smells very strongly and unfortunately I do not care for the scent.</li>
    <li> I decided that I&#x27;m not a fan.  It&#x27;s too heavy and I don&#x27;t care for the smell.</li>
    <li> I have purchased this creme at the local store for the first time after trying other Burt&#x27;s Bees products. I have an extremely dry skin in wintertime. My hands have that pumice stone rough surface and it really hurts when the skin cracks from dryness. At first, the smell bothered me, but after some time I got used to it and now I even like it. When one smells carefully, the creme does smell really nice like almonds. Some reviewers have complained about the greasiness of this creme. Yes, it is greasy. However, I do not use it during the day, but only at night. I put a lot of this creme on both of my hands and put my hands into loose socks. Yes, socks, not gloves. I have found the gloves to be too tight and absorbing the creme instead of allowing my skin to absorb it. If one does have a very dry skin, try this method for at least a couple of nights. You will notice a difference.&lt;br /&gt;What I also like about Burt&#x27;s Bees products is that they do not contain any sulfates, parabens, phthalates, or petrochemicals, and NO animal testing.&lt;br /&gt;I am running out of my originally purchased creme, so I have ordered 2 Almond Milk Beeswax and 2 Beeswax banana cremes from Amazon for the best price I could possibly find online. I can&#x27;t wait for my order to arrive.</li>
    <li> Keeps my hands soft and moisturized during the long, harsh New England winter. The beeswax is awesome stuff. The almond smell is, well, bad. But the banana version is much, much worse. I use it regularly, and keep buying it, becuase I&#x27;ve never found anything better for my dry, cracked winter hands. But pleasant smelling its not.</li>
    <li> My most favorite ever! Helps to my horribly-too-many-times-a-day-washed hands!!!</li>
    <li> To be honest, I HATED this the first time that I tried it.  I thought it was WAY TOO GREASY.  But after giving it a second chance, I realized that a little goes a long way, and massaging it in is very necessary.  After I slowed down and took the time to rub this in and use less it is AMAZING stuff!  I even bought some for Christmas presents!</li>
    <li> I ordered the two pack for my wife as a stocking stuffer. One of the two jars has a very clear fingerprint and indent; someone obviously used a little of this hand creme before it was sold to me -- gross.</li>
    <li> This lotion was shown to me by someone at work.  Now it has spread and a bunch of us use it.  It has a strange smell but I like it.  It feels very nice and creamy when you are rubbing it on and is only slightly greasy.  Works good on my knuckles when they get dry.</li>
    <li> It has a strange smell ，but feel very comfortable when i used it.Do not use too much. Just a tiny amount on the back of each hand is all you need.</li>
    <li> Love this! And I hardly cheat on Lush. But this is heaven for your hands.</li>
    <li> I had terribly dry hands and no other hand lotion or oil did anything, then I decided to try this one and I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll ever stop using it. it does feel somewhat oily when you first apply it (remember also to use it on damp skin for better results) but it absorbs relatively fast and you wake up with soft moisturized hands.</li>
    <li> This is the best hand creme I&#x27;ve found so far. It definitely is a bit slippery right after you put it on but just make sure you don&#x27;t use too much (probably a dime size amount is plenty, if not less) and rub it in really well. I use this as a night creme for my hands - I only put it on once a day right before bed and I never have to moisturize besides that - it works that well! I hate putting on lotion during the day for some reason... the sticky feeling it gives your hands annoys me, I think. Even though this is definitely a bit of an oilier option I usually just do it right before I go to sleep so it doesn&#x27;t have a chance to bother me much and it works great!&lt;br /&gt;This stuff does come in a pretty small container and it is a bit pricey but it will seriously last you for months because you only need to use a bit each time. It&#x27;s especially great for the winter!</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. It smells divine. Absorbs quickly. Doesnt leave skin feeling or looking greasy.</li>
    <li> I work in stained glass a lot, my hands get pretty ragged.  This stuff is great. I also had some rashy spots on my upper arms that just wouldn&#x27;t heal and I tried this hand creme on that as well.  Within ten nightly applications the spots faded and are going away.  The ancients used honey and beeswax for antiseptic purposes and there was a reason: it works.&lt;br /&gt;Excellent product, great service from vendor and Amazon.</li>
    <li> Very nice.I bought them for my mom,she really happy after use them.</li>
    <li> loved this creme, light almond like scent and made hands very sofy without being greasy! Would recomend and plan to buy again especially in the dry winter months :)</li>
    <li> I love this product, it is great for dry hands.  my daughter used it for dry patches on skin due to harsh winter we had and her skin was relieved quickly...love this product!</li>
    <li> I live in a very dry area, Fairbanks, AK, and this is the best product I have found in my 9 years here for dry cuticles. Works instantly and lasts all day and then some. Couldn&#x27;t live without it.</li>
    <li> The hand crème is wonderful for very dry hands.  It smells nice and a little goes a long way.  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Full of moisture and the scent lasts for hours.</li>
    <li> This hand cream is the very very best for dry winter hands.</li>
    <li> This is the best hand cream I&#x27;ve found.  It keeps my fingertips from cracking during dry months (winter) as long as I apply it regularly.  It also does not have a long list of suspect chemical ingredients that can absorb into one&#x27;s skin.</li>
    <li> This is a good quality product but I am a bit sensitive to the smell so I will not buy it again.</li>
    <li> The hand creme very good and smells well.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a hand cream that would condition my hands but not have that greasy feel so I can continue on the computer and working without leaving grease marks.&lt;br /&gt;This was not that product. Hands felt greasy. And the smell is odd. Probably won&#x27;t buy again. Amazon service/delivery was excellent.</li>
    <li> Great for the extreme cold winter when hands get dry like raisins. Apply it overnight or after a shower and your hands will feel as good as a baby skin!</li>
    <li> my mom loves it. the smell of almond is strong, which is okay with us, but if you dont like that smell, then may not work for you.</li>
    <li> it is nice ,and I like it, don&#x27;t hesitate to buy it .</li>
    <li> This is a heavier mixture, but not overly sticky.  Rich and creamy, it has a pleasant light fragrance.  I like to use it before turning in for the night.</li>
    <li> My sisters have very dry and cracked skin from constantly working with water (they manage a healthy smoothie shop).  They swear by the quality of this hand cream.  I think it forms a thin layer of barrier over the skin, so that&#x27;s why it is good for the hands that constantly touch water.  The smell could be improved.</li>
    <li> Burt&#x27;s Bees Almond Milk Beeswax Hand Crème, 2 Ounces (Pack of 2)  it&#x27;s a little oil,it&#x27;s ok,not as good as i expected</li>
    <li> This creme is excellent for helping skin to heal when it is extremely dry. I have severe eczema on my hands and it does a good job in relieving the dryness and helping the skin heal during the different stages. It is very thick but will absorb in to the skin if massaged for a while. It is not as greasy as ointments but you do have to give it time to soak in to the skin.</li>
    <li> Awesome product for dry skin, especially in the winter.</li>
    <li> Effective Hand Moisturizer.  Love the slight fragrance.</li>
    <li> my mother like it, it has very strong almoond and mile flavor.</li>
    <li> I have been using this nightly for a few months now and I have noticed a nice softening from where I had developed small calluses from a rowing machine in addition to my eczema. My cuticles are still a little rough so it hasn&#x27;t done much for them but it has been golden for the rest of my hands and I just love the natural scent. I absolutely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Got a compliment on the fragrance. Sweet almond. Thick and moisturizing.</li>
    <li> My mother swears by Burts Bees. I buy her some every so often and she is thrilled.  She swears it is the only thing that works well with her sensitve skin.  The scent is nice.</li>
    <li> The best hand moisturizer I have used - and smells delicious.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this stuff! It smells amazing and does wonders. It can be a little bit greasy when first applied but absorbs after a few minutes. Without it my knuckles crack from the cold winter weather.</li>
    <li> This hand creme is alcohol-free, smells great and for the price you can&#x27;t beat this deal.  Burts Bees products speak for themselves!</li>
    <li> An awesome moisturizing cream w/ a great smell.</li>
    <li> I bought this because my hands have been very dry due to the cold winter weather.  I used it today for the first time, and I agree with the reviews that say it is greasy when first applied.  Problem being, it still has not fully absorbed after about 45 minutes and my hands are still fairly greasy and i only used a very, very small amount on my hands.  It has definitely helped with the dry skin issue, but since I work in an office at a computer, unfortunately the greasiness has now transferred to my computer mouse and keyboard since the greasiness didn&#x27;t absorb.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Perhaps this would be good for others in other professions, but unfortunately I will likely have to look for another product for use when I am at work.</li>
    <li> bought for my sister along with the Burt&#x27;s Bees Lemon Butter Cuticle Creme, 0.6-Ounce Tin. her hands looked and felt so much softer then they&#x27;ve ever been before. totally recommend this.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t believe this is real Burt&#x27;s Bees Almond Milk Hand Creme.  Its greasier, the scent is not right, and the texture and consistency is very different from the product I buy at local grocery store.  Either this is a bad knock off, its old, its been submitted to extreme conditions, or a combination of all.  Everything about the real Burt&#x27;s Bees Almond Milk Hand Creme is irresistible, especially the scent which is completely lacking in the product I received.  I can see why some said they couldn&#x27;t stand to be around this scent!</li>
    <li> I usually like BB products but I&#x27;ve been disappointed in this.  The creme itself wont completely absorb and stays on the top of my skin.  The moisturizing effect doesn&#x27;t seem to last as long compared with other brands.  The smell of this creme is also a turn off.</li>
    <li> It has very bad smell, and people around can&#x27;t stand this. I don&#x27;t know if it works or not, but I stopped using it due to the somplains of my son..</li>
    <li> this is so nice with hands. At first it is sticky but later my hands are very comfort. FYI, loving the natural almond scent.</li>
    <li> Pungent aroma.I don&#x27;t like its smell.</li>
    <li> Great, especially for winter. For summer it is too greasy.&lt;br /&gt;My husband and I love to use it after doing the dishes or cleaning the house.&lt;br /&gt;I must say I also use on my feet to soft the cuticles and works super!</li>
    <li> My hands are VERY dry from cleaning and the dry winter.  This creme is a little greasy when first applied.  It does keep my hands moisturized better than many, many lotions I&#x27;ve tried.  I love the almond scent - reminds me a bit of the old Jergens hand lotions from days gone by.  I would recommend.  Four stars due to the greasy feel when first applying.</li>
    <li> I use it every winter !</li>
    <li> This will leave your hands smooth and soft.  It seems to moisturize my cuticles but weakens my nails.  It is too greasy so I have to use a napkin to wipe the excess and everything I touch afterwards gets greased up.  I don&#x27;t like products that remain on the surface of my skin and grease up everything.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff.  It did wonders on my winter-dried hands.  They&#x27;re so smooth now.  The smell is amazing.  Got many compliments.  Some reviews mention that this product is greasy and I wouldn&#x27;t agree with that, per se, but it is... Thick.  Typically when I use it during the day, I only put it in the backs of my hands.  At night I put it all over and rub it in well.  A little goes a long way.  Also, it&#x27;s great for feet!  My heels are so soft and smooth after using this cream.</li>
    <li> I put a small amount on my face and hands, and the scent lingered, irritating me, for some time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had tried regular lotion on an extremely dry spot on my face before ordering this product, and that hadn&#x27;t worked.  I HAD been having success using Blistex Renewal chapstick on my face, but that was never absorbed and was a bit irritating having chapstick sitting on my cheek all day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I decided to try Burt&#x27;s Bees.  Before I began, I had significantly reduced the size of the dry spot on my face.  After 2 days of using this, where I put cream on the extremely dry area SEVERAL times each day, the spot got even drier.  I applied a facial scrub to remove all of the peeling skin, and once more applied Burt&#x27;s Bees.  I will try this product for 2 more days before switching to another product to see if I get faster results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After all, this is a spot on my FACE, not a hidden spot on my arm or leg.  My goal is to get the problem cleared up as quickly as possible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had been under the impression that Burt&#x27;s Bees was all natural, then when I got this jar, was disappointed to read \\&quot;stearic acid\\&quot;.  It may be just me, but I don&#x27;t want anything acid on my face!</li>
    <li> My go to hand and foot cream during the dry winter.</li>
    <li> I am a firm believer in this product.  It is about the only thing that works for all the cracks I get on my hands.</li>
    <li> An amazing product. In the nursing field,  it really holds up. keeps my hands moisturized when frequently washed. Smells good too.</li>
    <li> Have been using it for a short time.  Seems okay, absorbs well without feeling greasy.  Need more time for in-depth review.</li>
    <li> i bought it for my mother for she has hand problem,and she was very happy</li>
    <li> This product has a funny smell after it is rubbed in.  Almost smells like lard or maybe an oil that is going rancid. I Don&#x27;t care for it much.  My husband uses it on his feet.</li>
    <li> I love this lotion, but eventhough they said it was new, I was not. I was able to see that someone used it before, so be aware that even if it said new and it is two dollars off from the one in the store, you can get someone else&#x27;s finger on your lotion &#x3D;(</li>
    <li> Smells a special taste Like the taste of rubber？？？</li>
    <li> High quality cream with a delightful scent.  A little goes a long way and it soaks in without leaving a watery layer like cheaper lotions can.  The scent is superior and almost makes me want to dip a spoon in and eat it :)</li>
    <li> Great on bug bites and skin irritation. Relieves itching!</li>
    <li> It moisturizes really well, but leaves a sticky residue behind. Also, it&#x27;s not great to bring to work, because the almond oil tends to separate from the cream, and mixing it together sounds like... I don&#x27;t want to say what it sounds like.</li>
    <li> I use this cream every night and my hands feel great.  No stickiness, no odor.  I love it.  2/20  Actually, this is a slightly different label and product than I was using.  My original jar had the word &amp;#34;Beeswax&amp;#34; - the new one doesn&#x27;t.  it&#x27;s not as thick or yummy feeling as the original.  :((</li>
    <li> to me it has a strong rubbery smell but my husband thinks it is alright. also this product is not 100% natural as listed since FRAGRANCE is in the very front of ingredient list.</li>
    <li> I love this hand cream, I bought the 2-pack, one for my desk and one by my bed... very good stuff...I also bought the Burt&#x27;s Bees eye cream &amp; love it too!</li>
    <li> Very good smell! I like the small from almond.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Used this creme 1 weeks , Smells wonderful and is soothing,  although a little greasy&lt;br /&gt;Already share to my friends!</li>
    <li> I, too, have had great results with this hand cream, and I love the scent. This stuff works MUCH better than their Honey &amp; Grapeseed Oil hand creme. Smells nicer, too. The trick is to not use too much. Just a tiny amount on the back of each hand is all you need. Rub it in and you&#x27;re done. I&#x27;ve experienced absolutely NO greasy residue as an earlier commenter mentioned. None at all, in fact. If you&#x27;re having that problem, you&#x27;re probably using too much! If there&#x27;s a little left over on my fingertips when I&#x27;m done, I usually apply it right around my eyes or cheeks as it seems to work well on my face, too. I love it. I just wish I could find it in stock at my local drug store. Every time I go there to get some, they&#x27;re out!</li>
    <li> And I love, love, love the smell of this stuff.  I feel good about it being all natural too.  Burt&#x27;s Bees products are a consistent favorite.</li>
    <li> For your baby to use.</li>
    <li> love this stuff, I&#x27;ve been using it for years.The smell is OK for me.</li>
    <li> If you have dry skin, try this hand creme! It works great! I use it on my feet too!</li>
    <li> The best at great price.</li>
    <li> I found this hand creme at Walgreen&#x27;s (!) a couple of years ago, and decided I liked the natural aspect of it and would try it, as other lotions sometimes left me feeling slick or slathered and I needed a tissue to wipe off the residue on my hands. First off, the smell is heavenly - a slight almond, milky, good-for-you smell helps put you right at ease. Then you apply to your hands and...my first time, I was like: WOW. This is AWESOME. My hands actually FELT good; I mean g-o-o-d; after using this product. It seemed to melt into my hands like bread soaking up butter. My skin WANTED this stuff, I could tell. Instead of that slick feeling afterward, I could still tell something had been applied, but it was because my hands felt moisturized and not coated. The landscaper came in one day complaining his hands were so dry - got my jar out and said &amp;#34;give this a try&amp;#34;. He was loving it: it went into the callouses, into his weather-roughened skin and made it feel better. He came back and asked to borrow it again. I gave him a whole jar. He now swears by the stuff and his hands are in much better shape, not as cracked and split and dry as they once were. He still looks like he works with his hands, but there&#x27;s a definite difference in the quality of his skin - even I can tell without him pointing it out. For me, I have a pot in my bag, one in my office, one by my bedside, one downstairs by the TV - whenever I&#x27;m feeling uncomfortable, I just add a little of this into my palm and work over my hands and through my fingers and I instantly feel 100x better. Working with paper a lot (tellers, cashiers, office workers) can really suck the moisture from your hands: I&#x27;m telling you, you cannot beat this stuff, it&#x27;s magic in a jar. I even use some on the callouses I get on my elbows occasionally, and within a few days, my skin is healed and and longer chafing. No residue, just moisture. it&#x27;s &amp;#34;AWESOME&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> I have had trouble with eczema on my hands since I was a child. Nothing ever seemed to help including prescriptions. my husband got me this and I couldn&#x27;t be more happy with the results. This protects my hands from the harsh cold weather and actually has a healing affect on them. I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased!</li>
    <li> I work in the tech world and get dried out, cut up hands regularly. This stuff was recommended to me by a potter at a school we support. It helps keep your hands from drying out cracking, without smelling like perfume. Perfect for a guy.</li>
    <li> love this hand cream, the texture, the fragance, and it really works! You&#x27;ll see the morning after your hands soft and attractive.  iti sia blessing cream!</li>
    <li> It solves numerous problems related to dry and chapped skin in a soothing and pleasant way.  Try it on a nose red and sore from a cold.</li>
    <li> I had horrendously chapped hands this winter.  None of my other lotions seemed to do much good, so I went for the gold.  This beeswax hand creme is super thick and really hydrates.  However, because I need to use it all over my hands, I can&#x27;t put it on during the day--otherwise, I get greasy finger prints over everything and worry about staining.  It&#x27;s great to use at night before going to bed.  You&#x27;ll wake up with super soft skin!</li>
    <li> Burt&#x27;s Bees Almond Milk Beeswax Hand Creme is great stuff. I first found it at a local store and bought it because it was on clearance. At first I was put off by the cloying sweet smell and let it sit, unused. I broke it out again when I needed something to put on a painful, dry crack on my heel. I applied it and went to bed. The next morning, the painful crack was gone. I have small spots of psoriasis on my shin and temple; a little dab of Burt&#x27;s Bees relieves the redness, dryness and itching like it was designed to treat the condition. After that jar was gone, I turned to Amazon and found a great deal for two containers. As for the odor, I either got used to it or it faded over time, because now I enjoy the smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the real deal. It works as advertised and is more than worth the money, as far as I&#x27;m concerned. I heartily recommend Burt&#x27;s Bees Almond Milk Beeswax Hand Creme.</li>
    <li> Good hand cream, fragrance!</li>
    <li> My favorite hand cream bar none. It&#x27;s got a waxy consistency at first and takes a few moments to settle into your skin, but then it disappears, leaving your hands moisturized and feeling protected. Has a very pleasant almond smell -- not overpowering, but you have to like the smell of almonds, which I do. I usually use this at bedtme on hands and, often, on my feet, too. I also REALLY like the packaging -- a little glass jar with screw top lid -- it&#x27;s easy to get the last little bit of hand cream out, and  you can either use the jar for something else or recycle it easily. Much easier and better than a squeeze tube (which you always have to cut open to get to the last 1/4 of the lotion or cream).</li>
    <li> Wonderful stuff!  My little one started developing cradle cap at 2 months.  It was starting to spread to his eyebrows/cheeks, and it was starting to become troublesome. I tried head and shoulders, baby/mineral oil... nothing was making it go away.  Then my sister got this as a Christmas gift.  Super awesome.  Obviously if you have nut allergies run in your family, it probably isn&#x27;t a good idea to try it out on your l.o., but if not- super awesome.  There&#x27;s also the banana variety to consider!  Love, love, love this stuff.</li>
    <li> Great for Summer or Winter, cracked, chapped Man hands!</li>
    <li> This is the only hand lotion that seems to work for me for dry skin during the winter.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a staple!</li>
    <li> I LOVE this stuff!  I put it on my feet before bed at night and then put socks on.  In the morning my feet are soft and my free of dry cracked heels.  In CA we wear a lot of flip flops and sandals and your feet suffer with being really dry with cracked heels...not mine!</li>
    <li> This product has made a tremendous difference in the softness of my hands. Using a light moisturizer first, the beeswax formula holds in the moisture for several hours. The outcome is a healing effect. In addition, this product has a lovely scent. Because the light moisturizer first was necessary, my rating was only four stars -- but highly recommended!</li>
    <li> I love this product. A little goes a long way. It is very thick and stays on your hands without being overly greasy.</li>
    <li> For mom. She likes it. I bought this beeswax hand cream, because I heard some surgeons(wash their hands very frequently) use beeswax to protect hands from dehydration.</li>
    <li> This cream leaves my hands feeling wonderfully soft and I love it&#x27;s Almond smell.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a thick cream with a somewhat waxy feel, it takes a bit of time to soak completely in&lt;br /&gt;but it&#x27;s so worth using. It&#x27;s turns chapped knuckles and ruff elbows to smooth skin over night.&lt;br /&gt;A great product for soft skin, I&#x27;ve been using this for years with satisfaction.</li>
    <li> Wonderful creme that I use on my hands and feet to keep soft.  Scent is soft and gentle, not over powering.  It&#x27;s all natural, gentle on dry irritated skin.  Since using my cuticles no longer split or crack.  Highly recommend 😉</li>
    <li> This hand creme comes in a little glass jar with a metal, screw on lid. I love glass because it can be forever recycled. The container holds 2 oz of creme. The label is almost white, as is the color of the creme.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first, most noticeable thing about the Burt’s Bees Almond Milk Beewax hand creme is the almond scent. I absolutely love the smell of the almond extract. The great thing about the hand creme is that the scent lingers when you first apply it, but the strength of the scent quickly wears off. Therefore, by no means is it overpowering or overwhelming.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The texture is thick and creamy. You have to press your fingers into it to get a little out. If you left this container on it’s side or upside down, the creme would remain where it is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is 98% natural, and that’s why I love it so much. The majority of beauty products have chemicals in them, and Burt’s Bees leaves me with nothing to be worried about. Plus, they don&#x27;t test on animals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Normally, I get a lotion that I use all over my body, whether it is hands, legs, or arms. I use this hand creme just on my hands, because it seems so concentrated. What I like to do is rub this into my hands before bed, so that I have time to rub it in, and that it has all night to be absorbed. Instead of it wearing off by touching things or washing my hands, the creme can work overnight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It smells great and keeps my hands soft, and I don&#x27;t think it is too greasy. I try to work it in as much as I can. We use it on our elbows as well, or any particularly dry spots. The cr&amp;egrave;me is soothing and gentle.  Great for the winter when my hands need the extra moisture, but also great in the summer when my hands get so beat up from gardening and yard work.</li>
    <li> My hands get unbearably dry in the winter.  This is one of the few lotions that work.  It does have a strong smell but I mostly use it before bed and not during the day.</li>
    <li> I love this lotion.  It smells so good too.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. It takes awhile to absorb, so I keep it on my bed stand and use it at night. I wash my hands constantly at work and during the winter my knuckles become raw and cracked. No more! It has a pleasant smell, feels good, and comes in attractive container.</li>
    <li> Thick rich moisture rich cream, great for super dry skin. Though I use it head to toe for baby smooth soft skin!!</li>
    <li> This stuff smells soo good and keeps my feet soft.  I bought it on subscription.  I definitely recommend it!</li>
    <li> My hands must be the driest in the world.  Nothing works....until now.  Have been cooking more, so washing more dishes which means more cracking.  I use before I wash dishes and after.  Use just before bed.  Since it absorbs quickly, no greasy hands only soft hands.  So glad I found this product.  Not ashamed of my hands.</li>
    <li> This product is a little on the expensive side, but it does the trick! It even helps heal small cuts and abrasions on my hands!</li>
    <li> a little grainy.......</li>
    <li> Very moist, not greasy, specials when purchased as a daily moisturizing is a very good choice</li>
    <li> I have purchased expensive hand creams that have been just okay.  But this product is very, very good.  It is thick, penetrates well and smells great.  I also use on my feet.  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> This is a good product.  I use it at night time.  It does have a strong almond aroma at first, but dissipates once you rub into skin.  It is also a bit greasy, but okay for me at night.  By morning, my hands feel smooth and the cracks on my fingers are healing. I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Like all other Burt&#x27;s Bees products this one is great! I use it after rock climbing where the chalk sucks all the moisture from your hands. The 2oz jar goes a long way also. Smells so great. Great from anyone working in cold, dry areas. I rub it dry and cracking cuticles as well.</li>
    <li> Works wonders for winter chapped hands. It is especially good to use at night when you can wear gloves and let it work for several hours.</li>
    <li> what is with the ingredient list? very greasy. I will not buy again.</li>
    <li> It is a gift.My friend like it very much.</li>
    <li> This helped when nothing else would or could.</li>
    <li> Of late, my hands have been drier than usual and my usual creams did not help tackle the dry skin around my nails. This cream worked like a charm after I slathered it on my hands overnight. I do not care much for the smell though which is why one star is docked.</li>
    <li> Great product. Love the smell, feel.</li>
    <li> I am not sure if the product was spoiled/defective, but fact remains that the smell was not pleasant and the texture was \\&quot;waxy\\&quot;, I also ended up with a skin reaction.  I have very sensitive skin.  I have read a lot of rave reviews about this product, but my experience was certainly nothing to rave about.  I haven&#x27;t given up on the brand, just on this particular product.</li>
    <li> I like it but it causes a lil irritation</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t live without! Very strong in smell but I love almond scent so I love it! Very thick and soft. It keeps the applied area very soft and feeling brand new ( such as hands, elbows, &amp; I have dry skin here and there ) it definitely keeps areas moist and soft. Definitely will recommend!</li>
    <li> The smell somehow disgusting</li>
    <li> Since we live in a colder climate during the winters, my husband and I are prone to dry skin/hands during these dry months.  I had tried pretty much everything, but still had hands that were so dry, they cracked and bled sometimes.  Finally, I had found this amazing lotion at a local health food store and tried it. We both loved it! It&#x27;s the only thing that works for us!  Eventually we couldn&#x27;t find it anywhere, so are now ordering it through Amazon for a cheaper price.  It really does work.</li>
    <li> I ran out of hand cream at work and randomly picked this product up at the store (obviously not on amazon) and am really disappointed. it is REALLY greasy and doesnt smell very good. my keyboard is shinny and covered in grossness after one use. my hands dont feel like they&#x27;ve been moisturized. I&#x27;m really unhappy with the product. not the hand cream for me . . .</li>
    <li> My favorite and my friends too.  I order double because I always give one away to make the people that I love happy!  Excellent to massage to hand and keep them silky.  However, if do not like a very creamy hand cream and more like a lotion is not for you.  Good ingredients too!</li>
    <li> Burt&#x27;s Bees is good stuff.  The hand creme smells nice and just a dab will do you unless your hands are very dry.  I have not used it as often in the spring and summer because I am saving for times I need more moisture.  As you would suspect it is a little oily after initial application but soon is absorbed.</li>
    <li> This is a must use before bed every night. Goes on thick but absorbs quickly and in the morning your hands are like new again. The almond smell is pleasant.</li>
    <li> No bad stuff.  Excellent hand, foot and elbow cream</li>
    <li> Daughter uses this so I got her some for a gift!</li>
    <li> Smells amazing. Feels great on hands and feet.  It does take a little time to absorb but worth it.</li>
    <li> Love it, smells great and did wonders for my boyfriend&#x27;s scaly feet!</li>
    <li> Love this hand cream! I was my hands so often with my newborn that I have a tub at every sink.</li>
    <li> bought for the wife she loves it</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t penetrate as well as I would like. It stays greasy feeling.</li>
    <li> Amazing stuff. Great smell and protects hands for hours. It must be the bees wax that makes it stick so well.</li>
    <li> My go to creme when my hands get rough/cracked in the cold Michigan winters.</li>
    <li> Smells great! Non greasy, absorbs quickly.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my wife and now find myself using it.  It&#x27;s a great product that helps repair your dry skin quickly and isn&#x27;t greasy.  Awesome!</li>
    <li> This is the best hand creme!  I have been searching for something for years to help with dry and cracked hands/fingers.  This stuff is great!  This is the only stuff I have found that helps mend my dry/cracked hands and the smell is great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got this item through the subscribe and save.  I ordered 2 jars of the creme.  One of the jars was broken when it arrived to my home.  I contacted Amazon and they immediately replaced the jar!  Once again, Amazons service was amazing!</li>
    <li> If you have dry hands and/or feet, this is a great smelling, non greasy cream.  I give it 5 stars happily.</li>
    <li> I live in upstate New York (practically Canada) so winters are pretty brutal. I spend a lot of time outside on my days off and my job requires me to wear rubber gloves and wash my hands ALL the time. The backs of my hands usually get dry and cracked between the cold, hand washing and hand sanitizer. This lotion is SPECTACULAR. I use it every morning and again before bed. It keeps my hands nice and soft.</li>
