    <li> Great curling iron.  Boy does it do the job.  It heats up fast and curls nicely without damaging the hair.  Luv it.</li>
    <li> The curling iron is very light with one heat setting.  It got very hot and not able to use without glove.  Unfortunately, the glove comes with the iron is worthless and my fingers got burn after first use.</li>
    <li> Best curling ever. On a positive, the curls last for days, no kidding. I was told that it has some kind of ionic charge that actually change the molecular structure of the hair, thus the curls last for days. Whether that is true or not they DO last for a few days.. Usually my hair goes limp after a few hours with a regular iron. It is fairly easy to use too, once you get the hang of it. They sell them at kiosks in malls for double the price. But if you want to see how it works on your hair first,, go to a mall. (I bought mine at Fashion Show Mall in Las Vegas) for $$$ 1/2 off on Amazon. Just be warned that they will push you to buy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the negative.  You must use the glove otherwise you will burn your wrist. I did use it and still burned my arm a couple of times getting use to the iron. The glove really should be a little longer. But it does keep&lt;br /&gt;the heat off you if the iron touches it. All in all great product, highly recommend .</li>
    <li> Works fine for the price! My curls tend to fall flatter than I would like by the end of the night, but I have notoriously hard-to-curl hair. Be wary that this tool gets incredibly hot - for both your skin, and for your hair (drying). USE THE GLOVE that comes with the product. I had a burn on my arm that lasted about two weeks with just a second or two of misplacement of the wand.</li>
    <li> I have owned two of these and the one I purchased from Amazon was a better price than the one I purchased at a mall kiosk. Creates fabulous hair and has a smooth swivel cord--which is a must.</li>
    <li> wish I could return it</li>
    <li> Wonderful, helpful for new hairstyles</li>
    <li> holding strong and makes my hair look hot! easy to use for the non-hairstylist person that I am</li>
    <li> It really work!! This is my second one, I bought it as a gift for my sister and she loves it so much.</li>
    <li> Very nice curling iron it works so well.</li>
    <li> Please do not buy! This is imitation wand .. In addition, I received a wand that does bot even say pro series like in the picture they are showing as the product. That means, they took a picture to an original Jose Eber wand and are sending an imitation. I know is an imitation since My friend has the ORIGinal and this nowhere close to hers... Buy your product somewhere else... I waisted my money...</li>
    <li> Luv it!! Celebrity Hairsytle!!</li>
    <li> I really love my curling wand. The only complaint I have is that I wish it would get just a little hotter. I have to leave the wand in the hair longer than my other curling iron. But besides that, works great! Came pretty quick too! I recommend this tool!</li>
    <li> Good quality....Love It :)</li>
    <li> I got this as a present for my birthday.It is amazing value and works perfectly. creates big curls for that classic hollywood look.</li>
    <li> Easy for anyone to use for fool proof curls that last and last. Heats up quickly. Best one I have used thus far. Perfect curls.  So glad I decided on this one instead of the chi.</li>
    <li> It was EXACTLY what I wanted for so much cheaper! Amazon is my favorite place to shop for anything. You always get an amazing deal!</li>
    <li> If I had a chance to, I would send my product back in and exchange it for the size that&#x27;s smaller than this one. The wand is thicker than what the pictures depicted, but I can&#x27;t complain too too much considering the results. Curls well, heats up rather fast. Only thing I can really complain about is how long it took to ship. I placed my order for this on June 30th, 2012 and didn&#x27;t recieve it until July 10th, 2012.</li>
    <li> it does what it says :)</li>
    <li> Good&lt;br /&gt; it  becoms hot fastly&lt;br /&gt;I love it</li>
    <li> Nice curler, worth trying .... But I was looking for bigger curls. I think I&#x27;ll go for the bigger size.</li>
    <li> Excellent product and thank you for conduction velocity</li>
    <li> Love it!!! curls last for 2-3 days!</li>
    <li> Arrived quick and item was just as described. Was a gift and my daughter loves it. Curls ur hair in literally like 5 seconds. Comes with full size hand glove which she loves.</li>
