### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Excellent replacement battery; great idea including the screwdriver!</li>
      <li>Batteries needed to be soldered in and the  razor 6863xl is working perfectly</li>
      <li>fits perfectly saved the cost of replacing my electric razor</li>
      <li>Charges perfectly.</li>
      <li>Including the specialized driver for disassembling the razor was a great idea--</li>
      <li>Works great.  </li>
      <li>Otherwise, it&#x27;s a great way to keep your razor going longer.</li>
      <li>it was good</li>
      <li>i took it apart and found out the wires were soider on good thing for me</li>
      <li>Works fine, but you&#x27;ll need very good soldering skills to install it.</li>
      <li>i do those kind of things any every day joe might not have the tools to do this</li>
      <li>It is nice not to be plugging in to shave again.</li>
      <li>thank you very easy fitting</li>
      <li>but i found that by removing the original battery tabs at the battery i folded them over and the also the tabs on the new battery and made perfect contact with no soldering.</li>
      <li>I LOVE the fact that these replacement batteries exist!&lt;br</li>
      <li>Bought this to extend the life of my favorite razor.  </li>
      <li>Received the right item that I ordered at a good price and delivery was quick with no damage, will shop again.</li>
      <li>No problems, easy to install.  </li>
      <li>Easy, peasy,</li>
      <li>First of all the screwdriver they give you fits and works perfectly, I liked that part not having to fish around in the garage for star bit</li>
      <li>The battery works just fine</li>
      <li>and you&#x27;ll be fine.  </li>
      <li>the batery fit my electric shaver just fine...</li>
      <li>also blame Philips Norelco for making a product that will likely head to a landfill when the battery dies because most people don&#x27;t have the know-how to replace it on their own.  </li>
      <li>Other than that, and once installed you got yourself great battery.</li>
      <li>I expect at some point to have to go back in and shim the batteries up from the bottom to maintain a good connection, since the folded tabs aren&#x27;t spring steel, but probably not for a good long while.</li>
      <li>It charged up quickly.  </li>
      <li>Even if someone decides to go the environmentally-friendly route, it&#x27;s probably easier and more cost-effective to purchase a new electric razor, than to take it to a repair shop to replace the battery.  </li>
      <li>After the first full charge the razor lasted two full weeks.  </li>
      <li>ok the battery is fine the only problem was it looked as if all you had to do was take apart</li>
      <li>it still holding charge after the first full charge.</li>
      <li>So, instead, I folded the solder tabs back and forth twice into a fan fold, effectively making a spring connector out of the tabs.  </li>
      <li>But I eventually got the new batteries in, and they work fine.</li>
      <li>take the blame for purchasing my current Philips electric razor that does NOT allow most people to replace the re-chargable batteries.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>Thanks!</li>
      <li>Check out on how to install batteries without soldering, you will be happy with the batteries - and the small torx screwdriver!</li>
      <li>I had to completely remove the card from the razor and then de-solder the tabs from the original batteries.  </li>
      <li>I wouldn&#x27;t recommend you try replacing them unless you are good with small tools and a soldering iron.</li>
      <li>The tabs on the batteries should have made it easy, but there was simply no access on the razor side, even with my smallest soldering pencil.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Second you really don&#x27;t need to solder anything.</li>
      <li>THANKS</li>
      <li>Just buy these reasonably priced batteries and keep your still-working electric razor out of the landfill.</li>
      <li>Does not appear to be a genuine Phillips product should be yellow in colour</li>
      <li>Now take your new battery and bend the long contacts into a U or S shape, make sure they make contact with the metal on the shaver.</li>
      <li>The only trick to doing this is that the original battery unit is soldered into the unit, requiring you to cut or break the connection.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Buy a new razor!</li>
      <li>It beats buying a whole new product.</li>
      <li>The HQRP supplied square socket screwdriver is nice but not necessary, previously a jeweler&#x27;s straight blade screwdriver was adequate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s like having a new shaver.  </li>
      <li>you shaver and the new battery would just clip in</li>
      <li>The shaver works like new , again.  </li>
      <li>Now my shaver holds a charge like new again.</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t have my soldering gun with me, but I cut the old battery out, leaving as much of the old metal ribbon contacts in place.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Be aware that once you&#x27;ve opened the electric razor, the water resistance of the unit is likely compromised.  </li>
      <li>The first charge went a total of 4 months before needing to be charged again.  </li>
      <li>Use the tape from the old battery and place it on the new one.</li>
      <li>Then I crimped on the new contacts onto the old ones like an accordian and shoved in the battery.  </li>
      <li>My old battery would not hold a complete recharge, neither does the new one.</li>
      <li>/&gt;As explained in other reviews, the first time replacement batteries are installed the original batteries have to be cut out, being careful to leave the metal contact tabs and using paper shims to ensure the tabs stay in contact with the terminals of the replaced batteries.</li>
      <li>We are 70 and 80 years old and had no indication from the writeup that soldering was a requirement.  </li>
      <li>In service one month thus far.</li>
      <li>Subsequently, the old battery pack comes out and a new one is installed just as in any replaceable battery device.</li>
      <li>little tricky soldering in, but there are YouTube videos that show you exactly how to do it....</li>
      <li>You just have to take some long and thin wire cutters cut those contacts and leave a bit on top so cut as close to the old battery as possible.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It really is poor form for Philips/Norelco to not have designed this shaver for the easy use of replacement batteries, and yet to expect the consumer to extract the battery pack before throwing away the otherwise usable shaver.</li>

    <li> the batery fit my electric shaver just fine... it still holding charge after the first full charge.</li>
    <li> little tricky soldering in, but there are YouTube videos that show you exactly how to do it....</li>
    <li> Received on time. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend you try replacing them unless you are good with small tools and a soldering iron. Also, they don&#x27;t hold a charge very long.</li>
    <li> Norelco should not advise to change this battery. By the time it needs changing the flimsy terminal strip has corroded and the battery cannot be removed. Wasted my time and money on this product. Absurd battery terminal strip is made for easy destruction.</li>
    <li> Check out on how to install batteries without soldering, you will be happy with the batteries - and the small torx screwdriver!</li>
    <li> Does not appear to be a genuine Phillips product should be yellow in colour&lt;br /&gt;Poor imitation&lt;br /&gt;I would not recommend it to anyone</li>
    <li> In service one month thus far. Batteries charged in under an hour and are holding the charge for the expected period. May it so continue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The previous replacement batteries, from another supplier, after just two years could no longer hold a charge; correct charging and use practices were followed. Those batteries indicate 600mAh 1.2V, while these indicate 700mAh 2.4V. Perhaps the prior batteries were incorrect, but just like the current batteries they were ordered through Amazon for the same shaver model.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As explained in other reviews, the first time replacement batteries are installed the original batteries have to be cut out, being careful to leave the metal contact tabs and using paper shims to ensure the tabs stay in contact with the terminals of the replaced batteries. Subsequently, the old battery pack comes out and a new one is installed just as in any replaceable battery device. The HQRP supplied square socket screwdriver is nice but not necessary, previously a jeweler&#x27;s straight blade screwdriver was adequate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It really is poor form for Philips/Norelco to not have designed this shaver for the easy use of replacement batteries, and yet to expect the consumer to extract the battery pack before throwing away the otherwise usable shaver.</li>
    <li> just go online and you can see a youtube video on how to replace your razor&#x27;s batteries. This kit had everything needed and my husband did his in 20 minutes. Charges perfectly.</li>
    <li> No problems, easy to install.  It charged up quickly.  The first charge went a total of 4 months before needing to be charged again.  It is nice not to be plugging in to shave again.</li>
    <li> No where did I see battery requires a soldering gun and very hard removal of old battery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buy a new razor!</li>
    <li> it was good but it takes time to install them</li>
    <li> We are 70 and 80 years old and had no indication from the writeup that soldering was a requirement.  Our eyesight and lack of soldering paraphernalia made the battery switch impossible.</li>
    <li> Works fine, but you&#x27;ll need very good soldering skills to install it. The pads are hard to get to, very hard to clear, and have other components nearby, so be careful of overheating. But I eventually got the new batteries in, and they work fine.</li>
    <li> fits perfectly saved the cost of replacing my electric razor thank you very easy fitting say it has to be soldered but i found that by removing the original battery tabs at the battery i folded them over and the also the tabs on the new battery and made perfect contact with no soldering.</li>
    <li> In order to install you need the proper tools, no just the screwdriver. Other than that, and once installed you got yourself great battery.</li>
    <li> Received the right item that I ordered at a good price and delivery was quick with no damage, will shop again. THANKS</li>
    <li> Excellent replacement battery; great idea including the screwdriver!</li>
    <li> I LOVE the fact that these replacement batteries exist!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I take the blame for purchasing my current Philips electric razor that does NOT allow most people to replace the re-chargable batteries.&lt;br /&gt;I also blame Philips Norelco for making a product that will likely head to a landfill when the battery dies because most people don&#x27;t have the know-how to replace it on their own.  Even if someone decides to go the environmentally-friendly route, it&#x27;s probably easier and more cost-effective to purchase a new electric razor, than to take it to a repair shop to replace the battery.  Such is life in this disposable goods world...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t mind tinkering, and replacing the batteries on an electric razor is about as simple as you can get.  The only trick to doing this is that the original battery unit is soldered into the unit, requiring you to cut or break the connection.  Just use a sharp blade and you&#x27;ll be fine.  If you&#x27;re not comfortable with soldering, just tape in these replacement batteries to the connections with some electrical tape like I did.  Easy, peasy, lemon-squeezie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be aware that once you&#x27;ve opened the electric razor, the water resistance of the unit is likely compromised.  For me, that was no big deal as I never used my razor in the shower anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So whadday waiting for?  Just buy these reasonably priced batteries and keep your still-working electric razor out of the landfill.</li>
    <li> Bought this to extend the life of my favorite razor.  After the first full charge the razor lasted two full weeks.  It does take some expertise to install/solder the batteries on to the circuit card.  I had to completely remove the card from the razor and then de-solder the tabs from the original batteries.  So, this is not for the soldering novice.  Otherwise, it&#x27;s a great way to keep your razor going longer.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t keep a charge once and a while</li>
    <li> Works great.  I didn&#x27;t have my soldering gun with me, but I cut the old battery out, leaving as much of the old metal ribbon contacts in place.  Then I crimped on the new contacts onto the old ones like an accordian and shoved in the battery.  Now my shaver holds a charge like new again.</li>
    <li> The battery works just fine and it&#x27;s like having a new shaver.  It beats buying a whole new product. Thanks!</li>
    <li> These brought my Norelco back to life!  Including the specialized driver for disassembling the razor was a great idea--I&#x27;ve got a LOT of tools, but nothing that would have worked to open the case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was not able to solder these in as the directions directed.  The tabs on the batteries should have made it easy, but there was simply no access on the razor side, even with my smallest soldering pencil.  So, instead, I folded the solder tabs back and forth twice into a fan fold, effectively making a spring connector out of the tabs.  I popped the batteries in, they made contact with the tabs left behind from the old batteries, and the system has been working fine for the past month.  I expect at some point to have to go back in and shim the batteries up from the bottom to maintain a good connection, since the folded tabs aren&#x27;t spring steel, but probably not for a good long while.</li>
    <li> ok the battery is fine the only problem was it looked as if all you had to do was take apart you shaver and the new battery would just clip in no so i did not take my shaver apart before i ordered so when it came i took it apart and found out the wires were soider on good thing for me i do those kind of things any every day joe might not have the tools to do this i would just say maybe they should say something about this in the add still for me it was less then buying a new one .</li>
    <li> First of all the screwdriver they give you fits and works perfectly, I liked that part not having to fish around in the garage for star bit piece.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second you really don&#x27;t need to solder anything. All you have to do is open the shaver and you&#x27;ll see the battery is indeed soldered on. You just have to take some long and thin wire cutters cut those contacts and leave a bit on top so cut as close to the old battery as possible. Flatten the contacts out or make them a little bendy out towards the battery. Now take your new battery and bend the long contacts into a U or S shape, make sure they make contact with the metal on the shaver. Use the tape from the old battery and place it on the new one. Close the shaver screw in your screws and done, works like a charm!</li>
    <li> The shaver works like new , again.  Easy to install and much less expensive than buying a new shaver.  Thnaks</li>
    <li> Batteries needed to be soldered in and the  razor 6863xl is working perfectly</li>
    <li> My old battery would not hold a complete recharge, neither does the new one. Something should be done about it.</li>
