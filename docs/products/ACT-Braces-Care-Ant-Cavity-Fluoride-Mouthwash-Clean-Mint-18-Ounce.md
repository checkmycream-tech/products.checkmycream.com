### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>The best tasting mouthwash for people with braces.</li>
      <li>Best tasting mouthwash I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
      <li>Nice to know amazon sells this also.</li>
      <li>Love this mouth wash.</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t seem to find this in the store, but I&#x27;m glad Amazon has it, as it&#x27;s the recommended mouthwash from my orthodontist.</li>
      <li>Plus, in my opinion; it taste better.</li>
      <li>Read the fine print</li>
      <li>In addition, my teeth feel really clean.</li>
      <li>I gave it 2 stars because ACT products are good products overall; however, I would have preferred receiving the correct product.  </li>
      <li>This stuff claims right on the front of the label to be alcohol free, but it isn&#x27;t according to the ingredient list that includes benzyl alcohol.  </li>
      <li>Besides the aloe ingredient, I&#x27;m sure the regular Act Mint will work just fine for those with braces.</li>
      <li>Sometimes returning items just isn&#x27;t worth the hassle.</li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t been able to find the ACT Braces Care in stores locally.  </li>
      <li>Flavor is less intense than some mouthwashes, which is nice because it makes it easier to swish for longer.</li>
      <li>Really helped the gums of my son with braces.</li>
      <li>The aloe really helps.</li>
      <li>The flavor is really good--mold, not abrasive some brands.</li>
      <li>could not find anywhere in home town - orthodontist recommended and it really helps</li>
      <li>I can actually swish it for a full minute without getting teary-eyed.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t believe it loosens food particles as it claims, because there was no foaming action.</li>
      <li>So far, it seems to be doing its job.</li>

    <li> Every other brand&#x27;s alcohol-free mouthwashes burn to some degree, but this one does not burn at all. I can actually swish it for a full minute without getting teary-eyed. It tastes better than any mouthwash I&#x27;ve ever used, and it doesn&#x27;t leave an unpleasant film in your mouth like some other brands do. However, it is a lot cheaper to buy it from a drugstore than from here.</li>
    <li> My son uses this daily since getting his braces with no complaints re. taste.</li>
    <li> Love this mouth wash. I carry a travel size in my purse.</li>
    <li> I recently had my bottom braces placed; therefore, my mouth has felt agitated for a few days. The aloe in this product did help somewhat with the discomfort. In addition, my teeth feel really clean. However, it left me with a bad aftertaste; which subsided after approx 5 minutes. I don&#x27;t believe it loosens food particles as it claims, because there was no foaming action. All in all, I&#x27;m not sure if I will purchase again. Besides the aloe ingredient, I&#x27;m sure the regular Act Mint will work just fine for those with braces. Plus, in my opinion; it taste better.</li>

    <li> could not find anywhere in home town - orthodontist recommended and it really helps</li>
    <li> Best tasting mouthwash I&#x27;ve ever used. The aloe really helps. I&#x27;m 30 and have braces and this did seem to loosen particles like it claimed. Nice to know amazon sells this also.</li>
    <li> I recommend this flosser to anyone who is wearing braces.</li>
    <li> The best tasting mouthwash for people with braces.</li>
    <li> Our dentist said to get ACT mouthwash w/no alcohol because there is a link to alcohol in mouthwash causing cancer.  This stuff claims right on the front of the label to be alcohol free, but it isn&#x27;t according to the ingredient list that includes benzyl alcohol.  This gives my child dry mouth &amp; headaches!</li>
    <li> My daughter likes this product.</li>
    <li> The product received was not Braces Care.  The color of the wash was similar,  but it was ACT Total Care.  I haven&#x27;t been able to find the ACT Braces Care in stores locally.  I gave it 2 stars because ACT products are good products overall; however, I would have preferred receiving the correct product.  Sometimes returning items just isn&#x27;t worth the hassle.</li>
    <li> My son is on his third day of braces.  Swishing with this has helped ease discomfort to some degree and keep his braces clean during this period that brushing is painful.</li>
    <li> Really helped the gums of my son with braces.</li>

    <li> I am the stupid one who paid over $ for mouthwash! I could have got the same thing a the drugstore for $5 or less. Read the fine print so you don&#x27;t get ripped off too!</li>
