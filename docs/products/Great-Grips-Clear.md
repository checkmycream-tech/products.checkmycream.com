      <li>These plastic grips slide easily over the knobs, and now I can open the door with almost no effort.  </li>
      <li>I now open the door with ease and the bonus was that it glows in the dark...not all that useful, but it just looks cool when it glows.  </li>
      <li>They don&#x27;t fit any of my knobs well enough to make it easier.  </li>
      <li>much easier now to turn door knobs</li>

      <li>/&gt;a real problem solver.</li>
      <li>I am not associated with any company and all opinions are my very</li>
      <li>Thanks</li>
      <li>But, they don&#x27;t stay on very well and tend to slip off.</li>
      <li>but these grips seemed like they would be a much easier, cheaper solution.  </li>
      <li>makes it much easier to grasp and turn the door knob now.</li>
      <li>I love anything that makes my life even a little bit easier, and these were exactly what I wanted.</li>
      <li>Grips shiped quickly, they are easy to install soft and grip your hands with little hand pressure my mother-in-law really likes these</li>
      <li>The glow in the dark part works ok, but the tabs fall out.</li>
      <li>Friends come over and ask where I got them, because their Grandparents or older parents or someone with arthritis needs help turning a door knob.  </li>
      <li>highly recommended.</li>
      <li>HIGHLY recommend.</li>
      <li>/&gt;i highly recommend these</li>
      <li>so it is easy enough to turn through the hole in the middle of the grip.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know if they all do this, but mine glow in the dark, easily seen at night.</li>
      <li>Of course changing it was an option, but this was also another option, avoiding getting new keys and all of that.</li>
      <li>This item is represented as an assistance to people with arthritis and while it does actually provide assistance in turning the door knob, I purchased it to diffuse the heat generated from the hot sun.</li>
      <li>Very easy to install as they simply slip over the existing round knob.</li>
      <li>Love it &amp; makes it easy to open door now but hole in center where you lock &amp; unlock is too small.  </li>
      <li>Easy to install, and after a few months they seems durable.</li>
      <li>These have helped me open doors better than any other product ever!</li>
      <li>One thing about them, however: they are a tight fit.</li>
      <li>My wife had a hard time gripping and opening the door to the laundry room.</li>
      <li>the grips are clear in color, they do not look out of place on the door</li>
      <li>Wow they surly ease te pressure of opeing a door when it becomes a problem....</li>
      <li>I bought this for an elderly person with severe arthritis and makes it much easier to open doors.</li>
      <li>that&#x27;s very hard to turn, it does not bold well with my mom who&#x27;s starting to get arthritis, she is much happier with the door handle now with the great grips on them.</li>
      <li>It was a bit hard to get them over the knob, and they don&#x27;t exactly fit like a glove, but i can turn the knob with no problem again.  </li>
      <li>We have a few doors that have the older, smaller knobs and these don&#x27;t really stay on.</li>
      <li>so other Amazon users can get a real feel for the life of the product.</li>
      <li>and I suppose I&#x27;l need a replacement if I live long enough.  </li>
      <li>but they are just a little too flexible when you grab them with certain grips.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> The hand grip that goes on your door knob worked very good. It was easy to put on and your hand will never slip on the door knob after installing this. My mother has arthritis and it makes it easier for her to open the door with this grip on the door knob.</li>
    <li> I gave this to my grandmother who has arthritis in her hands.  She has raved about these more than anything I have given her in 20 years.  HIGHLY recommend.</li>
    <li> These gave me back my feelings of safety and ability to have some freedom after being crippled with rheumatoid arthritis and unable to open door knobs.  I would definitely recommend to people as an alternative.  However, you will likely need someone to put them on door knobs for you, as this is extremely difficult if you can&#x27;t use your hands.</li>
    <li> I can now open doors without any problem. They were easy to put on and work so well.  Life is easier now.</li>
    <li> My sig other suffers from a hand tendon problem and these grips make it so much easier to open doors. highly recommended.</li>
    <li> These things are awesome, at first I was hesitant about if they were going to fit on an abnormally large door knob but they worked fine. I have a backdoor with a handle that&#x27;s very hard to turn, it does not bold well with my mom who&#x27;s starting to get arthritis, she is much happier with the door handle now with the great grips on them. It gives it a much better grip so it can be turned easier, and they were so easy to install.</li>
    <li> I bought this product for my mother who is finding it difficult to grasp her the door handle especially when the door swells a bit in the humidity. We decided to try this product before switching out to another type of door handle and she loves it!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price is great and it&#x27;s very easy to use.</li>
    <li> I was a little skeptical about how well these would work, especially for the price, but I was pleasantly surprised.  I&#x27;m quadriplegic and have very limited use of my hands and almost no ability to grip.  The front door of my house has a round door knob that sticks and is difficult for most people to open and nearly impossible for me, even using both hands, because the metal is so slippery.  These plastic grips slide easily over the knobs, and now I can open the door with almost no effort.  I love anything that makes my life even a little bit easier, and these were exactly what I wanted.</li>
    <li> A++++ GREAT PRODUCT WILL COME IN HANDED! WILL DO BUSINESS REAL SOON IN THE FUTURE, KEEP UP THE GREAT JOB.</li>
    <li> These were easy for me to install and they work great.  No more yanking on the door knob trying to get the door open.</li>
    <li> I bought this for an elderly person with severe arthritis and makes it much easier to open doors. Very easy to install as they simply slip over the existing round knob. The only issue is that it makes access to the center lock nob harder to access. I have to make sure the hardware is kept lubricated so it is easy enough to turn through the hole in the middle of the grip.</li>
    <li> I injured my thumbs in a car accident and this was the perfect answer.  I now open the door with ease and the bonus was that it glows in the dark...not all that useful, but it just looks cool when it glows.  I typically leave a small light on when I leave the house so I really don&#x27;t need it to glow, but I love it just the same.</li>
    <li> They were installed easily and work very well and were shipped promptly!</li>
    <li> Great Grips work very well for a variety of uses including door handles and faucet controls.  Easy to install without tools</li>
    <li> This item is represented as an assistance to people with arthritis and while it does actually provide assistance in turning the door knob, I purchased it to diffuse the heat generated from the hot sun. It has reduced the heat, and while it gets warm, I no longer burn my hand when touching the door knob that has been baking in the hot sun.</li>
    <li> Bought these to put on laundry room sink knobs....they work....haven&#x27;t tried them on a door knob.  Overall, pleased with them.</li>
    <li> These were to make opening the door easier with my osteoarthritis in the thumb.  They don&#x27;t fit any of my knobs well enough to make it easier.  I really have trouble turning the tab in the center of the knob to lock the door.</li>
    <li> these grips are great for doorknobs-they are grippy enough to be helpful for my husband who has limited dexterity in his hands and wrists.&lt;br /&gt;they are easy to put on the knob and they even have glow in the dark inserts that are removable&lt;br /&gt;i highly recommend these</li>
    <li> I have ALS and turning regular door knobs, especially heavy fire door knobs is getting difficult.  It was a bit hard to get them over the knob, and they don&#x27;t exactly fit like a glove, but i can turn the knob with no problem again.  If you have weak or arthritic hands this is a good product to have.</li>
    <li> These work great on any door that is not inset.  My favorite doorknob gripper.</li>
    <li> Love it &amp; makes it easy to open door now but hole in center where you lock &amp; unlock is too small.  Needs to be a bit bigger.</li>
    <li> I rent so changing the door knobs to handles is not an option. My front door knob is very smooth and difficult for me to grasp with my arthritic hands. These grips solve that difficulty. I highly recommend these great grips.</li>
    <li> These are great for helping turn the door knobs but they do stretch out over time and cannot be used on different door knobs.We have a few doors that have the older, smaller knobs and these don&#x27;t really stay on. But they&#x27;re great on the newer doors that have bigger knobs.</li>
    <li> These are a must for any house where someone has difficulty opening doors.  Friends come over and ask where I got them, because their Grandparents or older parents or someone with arthritis needs help turning a door knob.  A little push on the wing with the side of your hand or even an elbow turns the knob.  I don&#x27;t know if they all do this, but mine glow in the dark, easily seen at night.</li>
    <li> These work ok, but they are a little too flexible.  I realize that they have to be pliable to get them to go over the door know, but they are just a little too flexible when you grab them with certain grips.  I don&#x27;t think there is anything else out there for this purpose in this price range, so I will keep them, but probably won&#x27;t replace them if they ever break or wear out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use Amazon for most of my purchases and update my reviews if anything changes with the products. I do this so other Amazon users can get a real feel for the life of the product. You can look at my review which will be close to my purchase date and tell how the product is doing as time passes.  I am not associated with any company and all opinions are my very own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:  4 months later and they are still working as they were when we put them on.  They are on a door leading to the backyard that is used probably at least 5 times a day.</li>
    <li> Work great they do exactly what you&#x27;re supposed to do.</li>
    <li> These worked great for me.</li>
    <li> I use it to open the door of the massage room without touching the door handle (so I don&#x27;t get the handle oily.)</li>
    <li> These have helped me open doors better than any other product ever!</li>
    <li> This is easy to install, looks great, and works perfect. My wife had a hard time gripping and opening the door to the laundry room. This slipped right on and makes opening the door easy now.</li>
    <li> My wife sometimes had trouble opening the entrance door of our house and this product solved the problem.  I was considering installing lever door knobs but these grips seemed like they would be a much easier, cheaper solution.  They installed easily in seconds.  The only reason I didn&#x27;t give them 5 stars is they are a bit unsightly.</li>
    <li> Great Grips are a useful product. One thing about them, however: they are a tight fit. I have arthritis in my hands, and the grips are very hard to stretch over the china doorknobs in my elderly house. If I can get them on, sometimes they work their way off. When they stay on, they are fine.</li>
    <li> these are nearly impossible to get on the door knob, bought for my mom who has rheumatoid arthritis and can&#x27;t get them on the door knob not a good investment</li>
    <li> It works very nicely when it remains fully on the knob but has a tendency to slip off the knob.</li>
    <li> These help me open my doors with my carpal tunnel - especially when the handles are cold. But, they don&#x27;t stay on very well and tend to slip off. The glow in the dark part works ok, but the tabs fall out. They work ok.</li>
    <li> I have RA and turning doorknobs can be difficult and painful. These grips make that problem a thing of the past. I have purchased other knob covers but these are vastly superior. I am very pleased with these &#x27;great grips&#x27;!</li>
    <li> easy to use - happy to have - put them on all the doors and makes it easier to get to the handle - even when it&#x27;s not a senior citizen trying to get in or out of a room -</li>
    <li> An easy fix for making door knobs more workable for my arthritic hands.  Why are inside door knobs smaller than outside door knobs.  Well the inside exterior door knobs is where I usd these.  The shift some with use, but its easy to readjust and I suppose I&#x27;l need a replacement if I live long enough.  So glad I found these.  Changing the knobs to levers is probably the favored choice, but this is a way to avoid taking the door latches apart.  Less fuss and muss and certainly less expensive.</li>
    <li> Make turning knobs easier. Easy to install. Last longer inside than outside. Have bought several at different times. Work well.</li>
    <li> I think it is overpriced, but it does help my mother who has severe arthritis open the front door.  It is a very simple product, and has held up over the last couple of months.</li>
    <li> This was a gift for my dad. He has arthritis and one of his house doors is completely round, metal polished. Of course changing it was an option, but this was also another option, avoiding getting new keys and all of that. He instantly loved this.</li>
    <li> Great product! I got these for mom who has arthritis and it they make it very easy to open doors. Easy to install, and after a few months they seems durable.</li>
    <li> These sure were easy to install.  I am so grateful to be able to open doors again with my arthritic hands.</li>
    <li> I purchased these for my elderly parents who have a hard time with the handles in their new home. These work great and are very simple to install.</li>
    <li> We are using this in Tucson, AZ to keep the door handle from burning up our hands.  Seems to work&lt;br /&gt;just fine and fits great.  Thanks</li>
    <li> They;re just what we needed.  I can finally take the duct tape off the doorknobs.</li>
    <li> Grips shiped quickly, they are easy to install soft and grip your hands with little hand pressure my mother-in-law really likes these</li>
    <li> delivery was prompt&lt;br /&gt;installation was simple&lt;br /&gt;price was right&lt;br /&gt;since the grips are clear in color, they do not look out of place on the door</li>
    <li> These grips fit snugly on any round standard door knob and grip tightly when you turn the knob.  I have arthritis in my hands and stiff door knobs but these make it a breeze to open the doors.  They even have an opening for knobs with twist locks so there is no problem locking and unlocking the door with the grips in place.  Great product.</li>
