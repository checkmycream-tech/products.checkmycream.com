      <li>- MY STRETCH MARKS ARE NOW SMOOTH AS A BABIES BOTTOM!</li>
      <li>My hair is almost too my waist and in a lot better shape these days.</li>
      <li>SMOOTH!</li>
      <li>stress / all the good stuff, but now not even being done with the first box of Bonita</li>
      <li>OTHER - WE LOVE THIS PRODUCT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
      <li>Also....my fingernails are super strong and growing.</li>
      <li>Takes time but for me was well worth it.</li>
      <li>After just two weeks I start seeing hair growth (just head hair) of about an inch and about five inches with the first bottle, my nails got real long quick and super strong</li>
      <li>you can get your money back :)</li>
      <li>I cut my hair to the top of my shoulder blades about 2 1/2 years ago to get rid of some of the damage and even it out, it was pretty long then and has always grown fast</li>
      <li>This stuff is amazing, hands down....</li>

      <li>its the only hair supplement that I notice a huge difference in thinning hair when taking it...really think its the revitalyze 5 formula with Ho She Wu</li>
      <li>I find these pills really do help my hair grow.</li>
      <li>I just ordered my THIRD bottle of this fabulous stuff.</li>
      <li>Very disapointed.</li>
      <li>They work really well on skin hair and nails.  </li>
      <li>Because i was about to run out on my other hormone balancing vitamins i take, which are Oceans 3 Healthy Hormones.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend these.</li>
      <li>highly recommended</li>
      <li>-WOW!  </li>
      <li>, the product even helped me clear up my achne and put the essential oil I needed back into my skin to make it smooth again.</li>
      <li>My hairdresser, who recommended I take Biotin due to loss of hair and an overall stressed appearance...commented on new hair growth and how much better my hair looked on my last appointment.</li>
      <li>I have been taking this for 4 months now, and all of a sudden am noticeing great results, especially in my fingernails that were really bad with splitting and breaking before I started taking the Bonita V Hair Skin advanced formula 30.</li>
      <li>Plus keeps my skin clear of acne break outs.</li>
      <li>havent taken it in awhile as it was in a health food store near where I lived....</li>
      <li>The ingrediants seemed good to me and I have used other hair vitamins in the past with similar ingrediants that did wonders, this however did nothing at all.</li>
      <li>I normally don&#x27;t even write reviews but after the $50 I spent that fueled my fire to warn others.</li>

    <li> Love this product.  Works well for me.</li>
    <li> I have been using Bonita V for several months now and have noticed absolutely no difference in my skin, hair or nails. They are all still dry, brittle and fragile.</li>
    <li> 1. HAIR! - MY TEMPLE HAIR GREW BACK-I HAD NOT SEEN &amp;#34;BABY HAIR SINCE MY 1ST PERM AT 9-10 YEARS OLD&amp;#34; Those 1st generation perms/relaxers were rough on our hair, some of us BORN WITH TONS OF HAIR still have permanent damage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. NAILS -  My nails are somewhat stronger BUT ...DRUMROLL PLEASE...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. SKIN!!!!! - MY STRETCH MARKS ARE NOW SMOOTH AS A BABIES BOTTOM! SMOOTH! DID I SAY NO LONGER FEEL/LOOK LIKE UGLY VEINY, RIDGES PLAGUING THE LOWER HALF OF MY BODY! YES! SMOOTH! SMOOTH! DID I SAY SMOOTH!  YES! IN 1 WORD - PRICELESS!  I DIDN&#x27;T KNOW THIS WAS EVEN POSSIBLE WITH AN INTERNAL SUPPLEMENT OR I WOULD HAVE STARTED A LOT, LOT SOONER! (also, I&#x27;ve tried TONS of external remedies)&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m NOT SURE why MY BODY DECIDED to use the nutrients in this product to CLEAR THIS UP 1ST versus my nails which are visible to everyone BUT I&#x27;m glad, glad glad it did!  Sometimes I just stand there and stare at my stomach and pinch myself-WOW!  Thanks-BONITA V!  NEEDLESS TO SAY ME &amp; MY SIG OTHER - WE LOVE THIS PRODUCT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I am now on my third bottle but I started seeing results after just two weeks. I started taking Bonita v because my hair had just stopped growing, and my nails just broke and split on a daily basis. After just two weeks I start seeing hair growth (just head hair) of about an inch and about five inches with the first bottle, my nails got real long quick and super strong, the product even helped me clear up my achne and put the essential oil I needed back into my skin to make it smooth again. This is a great product if anyone doesn&#x27;t have results it&#x27;s becUse they are taking some other medicine to cancel it out.</li>
    <li> I purchased 2 boxes do to the fact that I realize your body needs time to adjust to vitamins. I am half way through my 2nd box and I have to be honest, I do not see any differnce at all! I normally don&#x27;t even write reviews but after the $50 I spent that fueled my fire to warn others. The ingrediants seemed good to me and I have used other hair vitamins in the past with similar ingrediants that did wonders, this however did nothing at all. Very disapointed.</li>
    <li> My hair is almost too my waist and in a lot better shape these days. I am suffering from menopause and my hair a few years ago started breaking and thinning terrible. My nails also were horrible and are still a bit brittle today but I would hate to see what they and my hair would like like if I hadn&#x27;t started with this product. I cut my hair to the top of my shoulder blades about 2 1/2 years ago to get rid of some of the damage and even it out, it was pretty long then and has always grown fast but it had slowed with age. So results speak for themselves but this is not an instant change. Bonita results I think is something that comes with continuation of the product. Takes time but for me was well worth it.</li>
    <li> Have been using Bonita products for ! year, and was recommended to use stronger version.  Will be using shortly when I fin ish other box</li>
    <li> I got a box of this from my local herb shop Because i was about to run out on my other hormone balancing vitamins i take, which are Oceans 3 Healthy Hormones. now don&#x27;t get me wrong those are some really amazing vitamins too but they didn&#x27;t seem to be getting rid of my acne problem. helped with everything else mood swings/ fatigue/ stress / all the good stuff, but now not even being done with the first box of Bonita v my acne is clearing up! i can not believe it!!!! so i&#x27;ll be buying more for sure! and for the girls/guys who are not so sure they have a 90 day challenge if it doesn&#x27;t work then you can get your money back :) hope that helps</li>
    <li> I am currently on my 3rd bottle of Bonita V. My hairdresser, who recommended I take Biotin due to loss of hair and an overall stressed appearance...commented on new hair growth and how much better my hair looked on my last appointment. Also....my fingernails are super strong and growing. I&#x27;ve always had weak nails that would bend and break. I actually got a mani last weekend....and had my nails trimmed a bit! My bestie started taking Bonita V at the same time and is having the same results! We are both elated!!</li>
    <li> Do not like at all. I prefer the capsules in the other Bonita. Would not order again.</li>
    <li> Has done great things for my nails and hair!</li>
    <li> I have been taking this for 4 months now, and all of a sudden am noticeing great results, especially in my fingernails that were really bad with splitting and breaking before I started taking the Bonita V Hair Skin advanced formula 30. My hair was also extremely thin, and it has improved too. My nails have always been bad, and they are the strongest and longest that they have ever been.</li>
    <li> I find these pills really do help my hair grow.</li>
    <li> This is an awesome product, my hair and nails have grown to be stronger an amazing product.  Plus keeps my skin clear of acne break outs.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing, hands down....havent taken it in awhile as it was in a health food store near where I lived....once I moved I couldnt find it so I just ordered 2 bottles....its the only hair supplement that I notice a huge difference in thinning hair when taking it...really think its the revitalyze 5 formula with Ho She Wu thats making a difference....highly recommended</li>
    <li> Good product.  I am trying to use it for several months to see results.</li>
    <li> I can tell a difference in the strength of my hair and nails. Will continue to use  to maintain strength in both.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t see any results.</li>
    <li> I just ordered my THIRD bottle of this fabulous stuff. I have taken Biotin until it was coming out of my pores because of scary hair loss that just wouldn&#x27;t quit. Nothing worked, and I&#x27;ve tried other products as well. This WORKS. Hair loss stopped after just a few weeks, and my hair and nails are growing so fast that it&#x27;s gonna cost me $ because I have to get my hair cut more often! LOL. Wonderful, wonderful product.</li>
    <li> Love these.  They work really well on skin hair and nails.  Great price. I highly recommend these.</li>
    <li> Still waiting for results, longer eyelashes though:)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m on my second bottle of this supplement.  I can&#x27;t brag or complain about the results this just yet.  I&#x27;ll stick with it for 90 days to determine if there is a difference in my hair, skin, and nails.</li>
