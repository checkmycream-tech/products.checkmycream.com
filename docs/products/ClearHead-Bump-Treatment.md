      <li>If you have ever used a HeadBlade with success then I would love to hear from you.</li>
      <li>Good product that is helping clear my face and head.</li>
      <li>that is special.</li>
      <li>Brisk cool feeling on my bald head</li>
      <li>does the same for $3 and feels just as good.</li>
      <li>It give a mild burn, but also has some soothing stuff in there.</li>
      <li>Not as good as PFB Vanish - works fair, but applicator is sloppy.</li>
      <li>My new favorite.  </li>
      <li>Keeps my head looking fresh</li>
      <li>The camphor smell is good, it does not have any other added fragrance to it.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>I shave my head every morning and apply this right afterwards.  </li>
      <li>While it is annoying that my bald husband spends more on hair products that I do (I don&#x27;t really spend anything), it keeps him looking bald and beautiful! :)</li>
      <li>Using this (and a new blade every week) have worked out just fine for me.  </li>
      <li>IT VERY MUCH.</li>
      <li>and I think I actually get a better shave with my Mach 3.</li>
      <li>First time using this</li>
      <li>Fast delivery and the product was every thing it was described as!</li>
      <li>Works wonders and really helps out when you first start shaving your head.  </li>
      <li>Gives a nice gentle sting (not like those other mean-spirited fiery-molten-lava-type aftershaves), and keeps the bumps and irritation at bay.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>If you have minor irritation or an occasional ingrown hair after shaving, because of sensitive skin, this is great.  </li>
      <li>Generic Witch Hazel available at any pharmacy in America</li>
      <li>It really prevents my scalp and face from drying out.</li>
      <li>The HeadBlade is an absolute disaster for anyone that shaves their head.</li>
      <li>I really like how it feels after I shave my head.</li>
      <li>It really helps with racer bumps.</li>
      <li>HeadBlade ClearHead really finishes off a head shave.</li>
      <li>This is a must have, especially when you first switch to a razor that shaves this close.</li>
      <li>I bought it from headblade first, but they don&#x27;t sell the larger bottles??</li>
      <li>I have fairly sensitive skin but decided to try this instead of Nivea&#x27;s sensitive after shave balm, and MAN, does this stuff burn!</li>
      <li>I use it 3 times a week, about a nickel-sized amount and still have more than half left.</li>
      <li>A quick rub on the noggin after I shave, and I don&#x27;t get ingrown hairs, bumps, or any of that mess.  </li>
      <li>This was my first time shaving my head and doing so caused some irritation and the Clear Head took care of that after a few days.</li>
      <li>This is the only product I can use on my sensitive scalp since I do have seb derm and whatever I put on my head flares my scalp up.</li>
      <li>After that, it does not sting anymore, or if it does, barely at all.  </li>
      <li>It does add a little shine I think, so be aware of that</li>
      <li>I will warn you that this does burn quite a bit the first few applications.  </li>
      <li>They last long, and the clear head is especially helpful in keeping his skull from getting white heads.</li>

<li> I shave my head everyday and apply it after shaving.</li>
<li> Burns But Works and I&#x27;ll deal with 5 seconds of pain if it means no more ingrown hairs or razor bumps.</li>
<li> also felt the need to apply a moisturizer over it as this did not seem to moisturize the skin (I&#x27;m not sure is it&#x27;s supposed hydrate).</li>
<li> not sure if it reduces shaveing bumps/ingrown hairs...</li>
<li> So I usually use a post shave balm over it to hydrate the skin which begs the question - why am I using this?</li>
<li> I use it everyday!</li>
<li> It&#x27;s not too thick and not too runny it.</li>
<li> Shaving my scalp was becoming a painful, bloody mess.  </li>
<li> No Better!!</li>
<li> For anyone that shaves their head, this crap is essential.</li>
<li> After a few months with the Clearhead treatment, I find it is not too bad.</li>
<li> The blades make your head look like a bloody mange ridden stray.</li>

    <li> Ive been shaving my head for two years now. If I would have know this existed I would have purchased it while back. My scalp looks great now and the zinc in the product works on the natural shine and oil. Keeps it down. It does burn for like a second but no razor bumps at all. This is the only product I can use on my sensitive scalp since I do have seb derm and whatever I put on my head flares my scalp up. This does not...</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been shaving my head since 1999.  Been through all sorts of products, blades, treatments, potions, and whatnot.  Some things work.  Lots don&#x27;t.  This stuff is great.  A quick rub on the noggin after I shave, and I don&#x27;t get ingrown hairs, bumps, or any of that mess.  And, it doesn&#x27;t even burn.</li>
    <li> The HeadBlade is an absolute disaster for anyone that shaves their head. If you have ever used a HeadBlade with success then I would love to hear from you. This is a gimmick which suckered me in because I shave my head. I&#x27;ve seen sturdier &amp;#34;wheels&amp;#34; on dollar store mini cars. The blades make your head look like a bloody mange ridden stray.</li>
    <li> Keeps my head looking fresh</li>
    <li> Not as good as PFB Vanish - works fair, but applicator is sloppy.</li>
    <li> I have been using head blade products for a couple years now. Being a bald guy I feel they give me the cleanest shave and after shave out there. No bumps no cuts!</li>
    <li> For anyone that shaves their head, this crap is essential. It does what it claims to do, heals and prevents ingrown hairs. And this bottle could easily last 2 years. I use it 3 times a week, about a nickel-sized amount and still have more than half left. Get this.</li>
    <li> Great product.  Works wonders and really helps out when you first start shaving your head.  I use it everyday!</li>
    <li> Works as advertised. A little goes a long ways.</li>
    <li> I will warn you that this does burn quite a bit the first few applications.  After that, it does not sting anymore, or if it does, barely at all.  I no longer cringe when I apply this.  I shave my head every morning and apply this right afterwards.  Using this (and a new blade every week) have worked out just fine for me.  I use it on my face and neck as well. No issues.  Will buy again.</li>
    <li> very good product, does what it says and more</li>
    <li> Been using this since it came out.. No Better!!</li>
    <li> I love this product. I bought it from headblade first, but they don&#x27;t sell the larger bottles?? I recommend this item to all the bald men who shave their heads like me, or anyone who shaves their heads. Great product. I use it on my face as well and works just fine all around. Keeps razor bumps away.</li>
    <li> This works well to keep ingrown hairs and bumps from forming on your noggin.  It does add a little shine I think, so be aware of that if it&#x27;s an issue.  I will say that if you wanna go cheaper, Witch&#x27;s Hazel is basically the same thing but WAY cheaper per ounce.</li>
    <li> It works as advertised.</li>
    <li> I use this on my head and on my face after I shave.  Gives a nice gentle sting (not like those other mean-spirited fiery-molten-lava-type aftershaves), and keeps the bumps and irritation at bay.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Really good stuff.</li>
    <li> It is OK. It feels good when applied. Don&#x27;t know what it does that is special. Seems any astringent would do the same.</li>
    <li> Yep, I like this stuff. It give a mild burn, but also has some soothing stuff in there. A little goes a long way..</li>
    <li> The only item that I have used that actually prevents bumps. I have bought \\&quot;ClearHead\\&quot; more times than I can count, and I will continue to buy this product.</li>
    <li> i shave my head with a Philips groomer not with a razor and i got some shave bumps and after using this product i have noticed better results.</li>
    <li> If you have minor irritation or an occasional ingrown hair after shaving, because of sensitive skin, this is great.  If you&#x27;ve got a skin condition like dandruff, stick with treatments targeted toward that specific condition.</li>
    <li> Fast delivery and the product was every thing it was described as! I really like how it feels after I shave my head. I will be purchasing it again once this bottle is gone.</li>
    <li> First time using this and it works great, keeps the razor bumps at bay, which resulted in clear and smooth skin.</li>
    <li> Terrific post-shave treatment without overpowering smell. Great seller as well.</li>
    <li> I bought this after reading good reviews and have used this for 4 weeks now. I shave my head everyday and apply it after shaving. Frankly speaking I don&#x27;t know what it&#x27;s supposed to do. I haven&#x27;t noticed any difference in my skin or the quality of my shave. It just feels great after applying it. There&#x27;s a little zingy burning sensation when you apply it and if you have managed to get any knicks/cuts during shaving. This is immediately followed by a cooling sensation because it has camphor in it. The camphor smell is good, it does not have any other added fragrance to it.&lt;br /&gt;I also felt the need to apply a moisturizer over it as this did not seem to moisturize the skin (I&#x27;m not sure is it&#x27;s supposed hydrate). So I usually use a post shave balm over it to hydrate the skin which begs the question - why am I using this? It&#x27;s feels good on application but if I&#x27;m gonna use a post shave balm anyway, I don&#x27;t see myself buying this again.</li>
    <li> Head has never felt better, now I can shave my head daly without rash.... Love it!!!</li>
    <li> Good product. Got on time</li>
    <li> Brisk cool feeling on my bald head</li>
    <li> Another great product from the people at HeadBlade!</li>
    <li> I love how it goes on nice and smooth. It&#x27;s not too thick and not too runny it.This was my first time shaving my head and doing so caused some irritation and the Clear Head took care of that after a few days. I almost regretted shaving my head.</li>
    <li> A friend gave us an sample to try the product. My husband uses this product on a daily basis.  He loves it.  It really helps with racer bumps.</li>
    <li> I will say, after a shave this stuff wakes you up for sure.  WOW...the pain stops in about 5 seconds or so, but man...not sure if it reduces shaveing bumps/ingrown hairs...but I am still using it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried several brands of so-called bump fighters and none even come close to the results I get from the clear-head. I&#x27;ve been a customer for a couple of years and wouldn&#x27;t think of going to anything else.</li>
    <li> This is a great product and helps you avoid ingrown hairs on the neck after shaving!  My new favorite.  Been shaving my head for years, this is the best product I have found!</li>
    <li> My husband buys all the HeadBlade products. They last long, and the clear head is especially helpful in keeping his skull from getting white heads. While it is annoying that my bald husband spends more on hair products that I do (I don&#x27;t really spend anything), it keeps him looking bald and beautiful! :)</li>
    <li> This product cleared up the razor bumps on the back of my neck.</li>
    <li> HeadBlade ClearHead really finishes off a head shave. As advertised, it has prevented bumps and helps tighten pores after a shave. Also, for me, helps with those minor nicks.</li>
    <li> Helps with any breaking out. Love this product.  I could suggest using this product to any one that needs it.</li>
    <li> Good product that is helping clear my face and head. Cool sensation with a good finish, highly recommended for all men.</li>
    <li> Burns But Works and I&#x27;ll deal with 5 seconds of pain if it means no more ingrown hairs or razor bumps.</li>
    <li> My husband is pleased with its effortless strokes and clean precision.</li>
    <li> Very refreshing lotion after a good head shave, would recommend&#x27;.</li>
    <li> THIS ITEM WAS SHIPPED VERY QUICKLY FROM VENDOR AND ARRIVED IN TIME FOR USE AS A STOCKING STUFFER. THE USER LIKES IT VERY MUCH. WOULD ORDER AGAIN.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. Wish I could get smaller travel size bottles of this. One warning -- it stings a little if you have a particularly close shave or nick yourself. But I love it, and it prevents razor burn and blemishes.</li>
    <li> Went back to my Gillette Mach 3. Worked fine but blades cost more and I think I actually get a better shave with my Mach 3.</li>
    <li> This stuff is awesome. Nice refreshing clean feeling every time I put it on.</li>
    <li> It really prevents my scalp and face from drying out. It is the best product on the market. I strongly recommended it.</li>
    <li> Really good at healing cuts and rashes from shaving, stings a little but very effective. Gives an extremely smooth feel to your skin and very refreshing!</li>
    <li> Shaving my scalp was becoming a painful, bloody mess.  Razor bumps were making me miserable.  Within one week, this product cleared up my scalp, and now my head feels and looks better.  Great stuff.</li>
    <li> After a few months with the Clearhead treatment, I find it is not too bad. It does help to close pores and give a nice tightness to the scalp after a head shave. However, it costs about $12 to $15 for one bottle. Generic Witch Hazel available at any pharmacy in America does the same for $3 and feels just as good. I am glad I tried this product, and there is nothing wrong with it, but next time, I will go generic to save some cash.</li>
    <li> I have fairly sensitive skin but decided to try this instead of Nivea&#x27;s sensitive after shave balm, and MAN, does this stuff burn! Tried it after shaving my head and BURN. Tried it after shaving my face and BURN!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not for everyone!</li>
    <li> Purchased this for hubby for Father&#x27;s Day along with the shave cream &amp; HeadBlade razor.  This is a must have, especially when you first switch to a razor that shaves this close. He loves the razor and all the products. (Best looking shave ever)</li>
    <li> This stuff is my favorite part of shaving my head! It hurts so good.</li>
</ol>
