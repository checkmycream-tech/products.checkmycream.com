<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I am wondering why I suffered so long with my old curling iron which didn&#x27;t stay hot.  This one is just great!  Gets hot and stays very hot, and the clamp is nice and tight.  Will probably order another one in a larger size! And the price is better than any retail store that I could find.</li>
    <li> I already have this same curling iron,  and I love it but it&#x27;s pretty old.  I was very happy to find this&lt;br /&gt;curling iron on Amazon at such a great price.</li>
    <li> I like the iron except for the cord.  It is too long and i have to untwist it every time I use it.</li>
    <li> Love it. Just what I was looking for</li>
    <li> Bought this as a gift for a relative. It&#x27;s super light, easy to use and well worth what I paid for it!</li>
    <li> I love all of my curling irons from hot tools. They heat up fast and the curl holds all day. Great value. I also like how the cord turns on the bottom so it doesnt get in your way.</li>
    <li> Very hard to make nice curls..</li>
    <li> I was given a used 1\\&quot; barrel hot tool by my hair cutting place.  I cleaned it and used it for a while.  I was so impressed with the speed with which it warmed up, the choices of temperature, the smooth barrel and the ease of cleaning that I bought the 5/8 barrel size for my sometimes very short hair.  I works great for me!</li>
    <li> love it and wish I had seen and ordered it a long time ago and have recommended it lots already</li>
    <li> This was to replace one I had.  The level of heat no longer was sufficient.  This model works very well &amp; don&#x27;t want to be without one.</li>
    <li> I bought this for a gift and she loved it.</li>
    <li> I had a 1&amp;#34; Hot Tools curling iron and really liked it but came to realize that the barrel size was working against my natural curl. This smaller barrel is closer to my natural curl size and so my curls last longer. Unfortunately, the smaller barrel means I have to use smaller amounts of hair and it takes longer to do my entire head, but that&#x27;a physics and not a problem with the curling iron.</li>
    <li> I love this product.  I have tried similar products under different branding, and this is the only brand that holds up for more than a few months.  I hope they keep making it.</li>
    <li> I have fine straight ,and I do mean straight hair! My beautician recommended HOt Tools. That&#x27;s what she uses.&lt;br /&gt;Could not purchase here so Amazon came through(as usual).&lt;br /&gt;Could not be happier with this curling iron.It&#x27;s WONDERFUL! Never own another kind!</li>
    <li> I LOVE this curling iron!! I gave very thick hair and it works perfectly.</li>
    <li> Nice and hot really fast. Love it and my previous one lasted for years.  Much cheaper on Amozon than the store</li>
    <li> I chose this rating because I like it but there really is nothing special about this curling iron that would separate it over any others in my opinion. It works as desired and gets the job done and Hot Tools curling irons seem to last years! My last one I bought 9 years ago and just finally replaced it because it was coated in hairspray from many years of use. Great product at a great price!</li>
    <li> Hot Tools never let me down! Love the flat iron and always been able to keep them for years, gold plated are the best for my coarse hair</li>
    <li> I purchased this on a whim because I&#x27;m tired of the kinds you see at the store that no matter which one you buy, never seem to work. Well, this one works and it works WELL. I have super fine yet frizzy hair. This product not only curls my hair well, it doesn&#x27;t fry it and the curls stay. I can curl my hair in 6 sections, spray some light hairspray on, let dry, and brush and I have absolutely amazing hair. The best part is that it isn&#x27;t a stiff curler, it rotates with the curling so it makes it super easy to curl. Best beauty investment this year!</li>
    <li> This is a great curling iron, the greatest. I&#x27;ve used many, too many to mention. Note: You must find your heat number. It can be too hot for most ladies at the extra hot level.</li>
    <li> this item was MUCH cheaper on amazon than anywhere retail.  I will shop more on amazon in the future.</li>
    <li> I have always used this brand of curling and highly recommend it. Heats quickly and is adjustable. This brand lasts a long time, several years. I have had one for 7 years now.</li>
    <li> It fell apart after 4 uses.</li>
    <li> It is difficult to find a 5/8 in. curling iron, but some of us continue to prefer a shorter haircut with a little curl in it.  This is the best curling iron I have ever used!</li>
    <li> This is the best curling iron I have ever owned.  You can tell its used by professional hair dressers.  It heats up fast with multiple settings.  I&#x27;ve been using midway on the heat and its the best curl ever.  The curl stays on my straight as a board hair!  Love this iron. I&#x27;m going to buy another one of this brand for my daughter.  The best!  The cord is long which is cool because I can walk around my bathroom.</li>
    <li> My hair is hard to curl - it needs a lot of heat to curl.  I&#x27;ve used this product for years with success and when it wears out, I just replace it with the same one.  It has multiple heat settings and the highest setting is hot!  Because of the multiple heat settings I believe this iron would work for any type of hair.  This product in the past used to have one fault in that the spring on the hair gripper would break.  I always ordered a couple of extra from the company to keep on hand.  The company has definitely improved on the spring, the last iron I had wore out before the spring broke.  A couple of years ago the company started providing an extra spring with the product.  Nice touch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I definitely recommend this curling iron.</li>
    <li> I love this curling iron.  It is impossible to find that size here at any of the Walmart, K Mart, or drugstores.  Use it everyday</li>
    <li> I use a curling iron about 5-6 days per week. It seems the switch on these gives out after about a year. Other than that, even heat, quick to reach the temperature, and easy to use.</li>
    <li> Have this product name for years. Ths one is my &amp;#34;reserve&amp;#34; for one the older one breaks. I like the 5/8&amp;#34; barrel (hair is short) which very few brands make. Amazon&#x27;s price was much lower than walkin stores.</li>
    <li> I really love this curling iron.  I t heats up fast, and there are numerous heat settings for any type of hair.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful iron with lots of settings to choose from.  I would recommend this if you want something with allot of settings.</li>
    <li> I love this product.  I was able to get the size curling iron I needed at a great price  Do not hesitate to try.</li>
    <li> The curling iron more than meets my expectations but I do find that it is a bit difficult t o slide through the hair while using it.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I wanted!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m really happy with the curling iron. It is the exact size that I needed.</li>
    <li> This 5/8&amp;#34; curling iron is the best I have ever purchased.  It heats up fast and seems quite solidly built.  Have had others where the on/off switch and other parts have fallen off.  One of the best features of this curling iron is the cord--it stays in one place while the iron itself swivels.  HalleluYah, no more fighting with cord to untwirl it.  My hair is short and 5/8&amp;#34; curling irons are hard to find and I pray Hot Tools never discontinues this one.  Thank you Hot Tools for an exceptional product.</li>
    <li> My old curling iron decided to give up the ghost after many years of service, and I am happily using my new curling iron. Great transaction.</li>
    <li> This is so much better than the ones available at stores where I live.  Will never buy those others again.</li>
    <li> Great!  Heats fasts.  Curls my short hair nicely.  A great buy!</li>
    <li> The adjustable settings work great for different hair types. It curls my fine hair without burning it. Turn up the heat and it curls my daughter&#x27;s thick hair. Also, it gets hot fast, great when I need a little curl but don&#x27;t have a lot of time! Great product!</li>
    <li> Great quality, curls wonderfully, simple to use, and very attractive. The curls come out clean and smooth with little effort. No unpleasant smell or anything bad like that I&#x27;ve experienced with cheaper curlers.</li>
    <li> Who knew there were different qualities of a simple tool like a curling iron.  This one is loaded with little extras:  on/off switch is in a place you will not inadvertently turn it off, there is a temperature setting for different types of hair, the end button is longer (less likely to singe your fingertips), the clip control is longer allowing easier reach, and best of all, the cord is designed to freely rotate allowing you to assume any crazy position and the cord doesn&#x27;t tangle or try to strangle you.  I LOVE this iron!</li>
    <li> I like everything about this curling iron.  It comes in a variety of sizes, it heats up rapidly and gives a great curl.  What&#x27;s not to like?</li>
    <li> Love Hot Tools products &amp; was thrilled to find it at such a reasonable price.  And with Amazon Prime, arrived in just a few days!!  I use it every morning &amp; have had it now for about 4 weeks.</li>
    <li> This is the hottest, fastest curling iron I&#x27;ve ever had.  Love it and use it daily.  Great product for home use.  And extremely easy to keep clean.</li>
    <li> I make sure I have at least one of these curling irons on hand at all times.  I always have one in use and one in my bathroom drawer in case the spring breaks or something else goes wrong with the one in use.  Don&#x27;t get me wrong, they last a long time, but I just can&#x27;t imagine being without one!  It is the hottest iron I have ever tried that is sold to non-professionals.  I have very, very fine, straight blond hair that refuses to take a curl under almost any circumstances.  However, after drying my hair, then hairspraying it to death, then combing it out, and THEN using this curling iron on the hottest setting it allows, I get my hair to curl.  I highly recommend this product and I hope they never stop making it or change it in any way!  I have also used the other sized Hot Tool curling irons and I like them just as well for different  sized curls.</li>
    <li> The curlling iron is excellent. Has an extra long cord and that really makes it.  I&#x27;ve tried others before, and this one is the best.</li>
    <li> Excellent curling iron - but super hot.</li>
    <li> This is the curling iron I love. It is so difficult to find a curling iron  this size that heats up hot enough to bend stick straight short hair. This one does the job! The one I had bit the dust and I needed another one. It heats up quickly and the heat settings work as promised.</li>
    <li> Love Hot Tools Curling Irons...wouldn&#x27;t buy any other brand!</li>
    <li> They are perfect.  that size is hard to find.  will order again.</li>
    <li> I love this.  I had one for years and it finally broke.  I knew it was the only one I wanted so I quickly replaced it!</li>
    <li> I was very pleased with the speed with which I received my order.  I just love the product.  It was everything I hoped for and more.</li>
    <li> Just what we wanted, good service</li>
    <li> I was introduced to this brand by my stylist (I was used to the drug store brands).  I agree with the other reviewers that this curling iron is the best I&#x27;ve used in every way.  I searched for the same model as I had before and am just as pleased with the new one.  Glad this model is still available.  Thanks Amazon for the quick delivery too.</li>
    <li> This is my second one...use it for traveling.  Like that it comes with extra spring and temp controls are easy to use</li>
    <li> This curling iron makes the best curls and  fast. Everybody always comments on how they love my hair and if my hair is naturally curly.  I tell them I curl it with a really hot curling iron.  They say they try but the curls never come out like that or stay in.  I just tell them to they need to get a hot tool!  They always say that it must take a long time to do my hair.  I tell them not really.  My curling iron heats up fast and curls fast.  Then I just spray my hair and fluff it up a bit and done.  They don&#x27;t ever believe me....but its true.  It curls fast.</li>
    <li> My favorite iron....!</li>
    <li> I love it, it&#x27;s the perfect size curl thsat I had been looking for.</li>
    <li> This iron heats up fast, I always use this brand of iron.  I really like it.</li>
    <li> The best curling iron I ever owned, eventhough it was short lived. I only sent it back because I ordered the wrong size. I needed the 1 1/4 inch barrel for looser curls. It does heat up very quickly and doesn&#x27;t require the highest heat setting. You can&#x27;t go wrong with this curling iron. Hot Tools have always a good affordable brand.</li>
    <li> It WORKS. My hair always stays curly, even to the next day.</li>
    <li> This is the best curling iron I have ever used.  I enjoy how quickly it heats up, and the release is awesome, heating is very uniform.  The cord doesn&#x27;t tangle up and is the perfect length to allow for easy handling, but not get caught up or tripped on.  It&#x27;s a very pretty sleek looking product also, pretty and functional with the gold color.  It cleans up easily, I love this product!</li>
    <li> hot tools rocks as usual!  Gets hot quickly and curls within seconds.  Perfect for naturally curly hair that gets frizzy in places.  Just curl a few of the bad areas and you get an amazingly natural look!....small midi curling iron needed for this look</li>
    <li> High heat for quick styling. Love it</li>
    <li> The product arrived on time and is very easy to use; I have been very happy with the design and secure handle. The hot curling iron met all my expectations.</li>
    <li> I did not realize the curling iron would be so narrow.  I did not even take it out of the box as I don&#x27;t want my hair that curly.  But if you do, this is a good product.  I ordered the 1&amp;#34; and it works fine with my short hair.</li>
    <li> Did not grasp hair tight enough, hair just slipped out when curling it. I  have other hot tool curling irons that work very well.  I think the one I just got was defective.  Hot tools is very good product.</li>
    <li> This is a good quality curling iron.</li>
    <li> This curling iron is light weight..fits small hands really well.  It gets hot enough to actually set the curl.  Very happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> I have tried numerous cheap curling irons, and truly, I got what I paid for.  I finally decided to pay the extra and buy this one, and it is wonderful.  Quick to heat up, comfortable to hold, and does a fine job on my hair.  I am very happy with this purchase!</li>
    <li> I have used hot tools curling iron for years and I am pleased with the one I just ordered. It also included 2 extra clips which is the first time I have ever received these. Thanks for the fast service from Amazon.</li>
    <li> I purchased this curling iron in late August. I only used it once or twice a week. I plugged it in a day ago, it was working fine. While using it, I heard it pop. A small puff of smoke came out and that was it. It died.It lasted exactly 2 months! I am really disappointed. I am hoping the other curling I bought from the same company lasts longer than this one did.</li>
    <li> I have been using this manufacturers curling irons for several years. I really like the design and quality. I made this purchase so I would have a spare should the one I am using ever fail.</li>
    <li> Had to end up buying a second one because my daughter loved mine so much that she took it back to Chicago with her. I didn&#x27;t notice until the next morning :/ great product! Gets hot fast and leaves hair perfect for the day.</li>
    <li> I was looking for something with a shorter barrel -- unfortunately I need a 5/8&amp;#34; iron and there aren&#x27;t many.  This is identical to the Helen of Troy.  Not bad, not outstandingn.</li>
    <li> love the curling iron and the price was much  better than in Beauty Supply stores, where I have bought in the past</li>
    <li> I fined it hard to fined a curling iron this small, and thanks to hot tools I finally could re place my broken curling iron. The curling iron works great!</li>
    <li> Am very happy with the purchase of this curling iron.  I ordered a hard to find size - 5/8 inch.  It arrived as promised and works great.</li>
    <li> I was looking for something with a 5/8&amp;#34; barrel - hard to find.  This curling iron works very well; but it is more in line for use in a salon.  The length is a bit cumbersome.</li>
    <li> I was anticipating that the barrel would create a smooth finish once the hair was curled, this was not the case.  In saying that, it was an inexpensive iron, so perhaps my expectations could have been more realistic given the price.</li>
    <li> I have used hot tools curling irons for years and am never disappointed.  They heat quickly and evenly.  I don&#x27;t think there is a better curling iron on the market.</li>
    <li> Works great.  Wish it had a two hour automatic shut off.  Have to make sure I unplug before heading off to work</li>
    <li> I have only had the opportunily to use this Hot Iron Curling Iron a few times but at this time I am very pleased with it.</li>
    <li> This iron works perfectly and the handle swiveled which makes it very easy when using and allows the cord not to curl like many others.</li>
    <li> Have only used it once, but it really gives good curl. I have thick hair and am at the &amp;#34;end&amp;#34; of my perm. My other curling iron only did an Okay job, this is excellent</li>
    <li> My wife is not the most careful of people. This tool can keep up with her dropping it off the sink all the time. she says she loves it, and since it&#x27;s not really my thing, I&#x27;ll take her word for it.</li>
    <li> i gave it 4 stars, because I do like the product.  My hair is fine, and the product holds it in place while curling. It seems reasonably priced also.  I have had two of these before, and they died on me before year-end.  It does have a year warranty.  The first one I did not return, but the last one I am returning, since I kept all the info on it.  Hopefully Hot Tools will replace it; I&#x27;d like to have an extra on hand just in case this last purchase does the same thing.</li>
    <li> I have purchased several Hot Tools curling irons over the past 15 years and have been very pleased with the performance and quality of them.  In the past, I have purchased the 1/2&amp;#34; because that is typically the smallest barrel carried in stock at cosmetic/beauty supply stores.  I wanted to try the smaller barrel as I have very straight, short hair and wanted to see if that would give me a longer lasting lift.  For some reason, this unit does not seem to get as hot as my previous Hot Tools curling irons, but other than that, I am very satisfied.</li>
    <li> I have fine 2c/3a curls that sometimes need an extra boost, which is where this beauty comes in. To be perfectly honest I don&#x27;t use it often, since my hair is so curly on its own. But for the nights where I want that extra &amp;#34;oommph&amp;#34; or the days I&#x27;m bored and decide to give myself a delicious white girl afro, this curler is perfect. Heats quickly, easy to use and looks sleek. Word of caution, if you have fine hair like me DO NOT leave your hair on for too long or use the maximum temperatures. Also, use a protector.</li>
    <li> Very easy to use ad gives nice tight curls</li>
    <li> I think this is the best curling iron ever!  It has a wide range of heat settings and has the capability to get very hot.  It comes with an extra spring.  Wish it was dual voltage, tho.</li>
    <li> I have bought this brand of iron in the past. It was fast and super hot. This time around it didn&#x27;t seem to have the same heat intensity as my old one. I was a little disappointed.</li>
    <li> My beautician told me this iron was like the professional ones they use. As iome types of hair fine shaft like mine was hard to hold a curl. It gets very HOT. So you must test the right heat to use on your hair. It works great and I bought two sizes.&lt;br /&gt;I will buy from this company again. The shipping was great and the packaging very protective.</li>
    <li> This hot tool curling iron is great the price is right and the size is perfect for my hair.  It heats up just right for my hair.</li>
    <li> Great curling iron at a great price!</li>
    <li> This is absolutely the best curling iron I have bought. All the others I have gotten never hold the hair. I would highly recommend this curling iron especially if you have fine hair.</li>
    <li> Just the irons I needed.</li>
    <li> This size is perfect for giving the top of my short haircut the heighth it needs.</li>
    <li> My last curling iron like this one lasted 15 years before dying. This is a great product and the price is right. It gets super hot, and curls the hair very quickly.</li>
    <li> Difficult size to find this size in stores.  Peerfect for my straight hair!</li>
    <li> 5 starr 5 star 5 star 5star like it 5 star happy with it 5 star 5 star 5 star just 5 star that all I want to write</li>
    <li> You have to turn it up above 7 to get a good curl if you have coarse. hair or hard to curl hair</li>
    <li> I especially love the cord on this product.  It is a soft, rubbery material so it does not tangle as much as other curling irons.  The multiple heat settings are great.</li>
    <li> Just as described smooth transaction!!!</li>
    <li> Great for short hair.....</li>
    <li> Well made.  Exceeded expectation.</li>
    <li> Love my new curling iron!  It heats very quickly and it was a bargain.  My old one died, so I went to Amazon and put the model number in and had a new one ordered in 15 minutes, two days later it&#x27;s here!  Thanks Amazon!</li>
    <li> Im happy with the curling iron. But I find it odd that there are no instructions in the package. So my concern is that it was a return.</li>
    <li> This is my second curling Iron.  I ordered this one just to have a backup for my first one. The older one is still good so have not used this one much. They do work great though.. Would highly recommend it.</li>
