<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I really love this mirror, I am over 50 and need reading glasses, this is perfect  for make up.</li>
    <li> I enjoy taking trips but HATE trying to put makeup on &amp; pluck eyebrows away from my usual &amp;#34;makeup station&amp;#34; at home atop a tall chest of drawers with a powerful mirror and good light. I have tried several different travel mirrors but they have been clumsy to use. I definitely need a 10x power to see well. After growing tired of the folding mirror I&#x27;d been traveling with, I searched again and found this one. I still need to take my smaller 15x folding mirror to do brows, but this is an improvement over my Jerdon folding mirror (which is kind of &amp;#34;clanky&amp;#34; and bulkier to fold up and pack.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:  Two mirror choices and good mirror strength at the 10x side. The height is adjustable, as long as you have a decent amount of surface to set it up on and get the little plastic stand at the angle you need. On a cruise ship with a dressing table, I was able to stick the mirror handle in the tissue box to hold it up. It has dual use, as it is also a hand mirror. It can be packed in the flat box it came with and slipped in between clothes to give it a little padding.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:  The little plastic stand which is a separate piece, falls off as soon as you lift up the mirror, so a little clumsy. I sure hope I don&#x27;t break or lose it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You still need a good surface at the right height and good lighting for this or any mirror to make makeup application easy. So far, I rarely find a setting as good as at home, even in hotels with attached makeup mirrors in the bathroom. Oh well, it won&#x27;t keep me from traveling, but I don&#x27;t always feel I look too great!</li>
    <li> Too small for work desk. Not elevated enough..a have to always prop up on a book or on something to see better. Magnify side is too up close and personal.</li>
    <li> Very basic (especially the \\&quot;stand\\&quot;), but good value. Decent quality mirror. The 10X side (which is 10, not 8X as in the description) can be pretty cruel.  :-(</li>
    <li> The 10X side of this mirror shows a clear and undistorted image large enough that I can pluck my eyebrows without glasses. The stand works so you have both hands free to apply makeup. Only thing that would make it better is if it were lighted, but then it would of been around $30 instead of $11. I shopped around before I bought this one. Great for those of us who don&#x27;t see as well as we used too:)</li>
    <li> Bouight for my daughter.  She likes it.</li>
    <li> This is the best travel mirror.  Lies flat and you can change height up or down with the detached stand...removable and slides up or down. 10X for makeup and 1X for back of hair or rear view of clothes.  I travel a lot.  This is the best mirror for hotel rooms.  I also purchase from Magellans the airplane foot rest they sell.  This mirror fits great on the foot rest.  Foot rest packs flat, as well.  Put the foot rest opened on a desk with the mirror on top and VOILA! you can sit and put on your makeup.  Most mirrors are too low on a desk.  Hope this helps fellow female travelers.</li>
    <li> Love it.  Perfect for travel.</li>
    <li> I found this mirror to work very well when compared to the other one I purchased from amazon shops.  This one has a durable thicker handle, stand if you want to use that and has good clarity so is nice for viewing the back of your head while trimming your hair and checking for proper length etc.  In short they did a nice job on the design.  No complaints at all!</li>
    <li> The hand mirror I ordered is a good deal.  The 10X side sure helps me to see to put on make up.  The price was good too.  I&#x27;d recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> Reviewed about twenty bath mirrors before deciding  on this one. We had a mirror in a stand, which was dropped  and cracked. It was strictly economonical to make this  purchase. It was a third of the cost of the broken one  and appeared to be the same quality. Now that my wife has  used it for a few weeks, she is quite pleased with the   quality.</li>
    <li> I guess part of the problem is my fault, I didn&#x27;t realize that 10x in a mirror could only be seen by closing one of my eyes.  I could not use this mirror and so I returned it to Amazon and received a full refund plus shipping!  Thank you Amazon!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my wife, but I use it while shaving now. It is so powerful, it makes it easy to see when I missed a spot.</li>
    <li> I purchased this mirror to replace my old one.  It does what I need it to do.  I would purchase it again.</li>
    <li> I needed this mirror to ge those hard to see stray brows to find that the tweezers can&#x27;t do the job.  I have one of those smaller mirrors that I attached to a medicine cabinet and that&#x27;s just as good and even better because I can get right up to that mirror.  This hand held is cumbersome but when I have the time to sit and do it slowly it works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, saw it at Ross Dress for less for $7.99.  Lesson, shop around a little before jumping the gun.</li>
    <li> bought this to replace a very expensive mirror from one of those bigtime mall stores.  where this was as far as I could tell the same except maybe the other wasn&#x27;t 10x, only 7x magnification.  honestly, my wife has been extremely happy with it and now I need to repurchase as with all these things they do fall and break from time to time but my wife wants another of these so that&#x27;s saying something and the price was great as well</li>
    <li> love the mirror.you can hold in hand or use small stand,you can see everything,really everything..great for make up close ups,which is good when your eyes are failling a little..</li>
    <li> A great gift for the women in your life and Something that will get a lot of use!</li>
    <li> This magnifying mirror works well...when positioned 1-5 inches from your face.  At 5-12 inches, everything is a blur.  At 18 inches, everything is upside down.  In short, provides excellent magnification if you hold it right in front of you.  If you plan to place it in the stand and sit back, forget it.    I ordered this product after using a counter-top magnifying mirror in a hotel.  No comparison!</li>
    <li> Purchased this product to use when I am applying make-up.  It work well on the bathroom counter &amp; the stand allows for free-hand make-up applications.</li>
    <li> This mirror is lightweight, but magnifies well.  The stand works quite fine.  Seeing my pores up close can be kind of scary, but that is what 10x magnification will do.</li>
    <li> Wonderful hand mirror.  Not sure I would use for travel.  Attractive and modern silhouette.  Nice weight in your hand.</li>
    <li> My only complaint is the packaging.  When I opened it I did not see the stand in the packaging and accidently threw it away.  Now I just have a plain mirror!</li>
    <li> Love this double-sided mirror.  The magnification is very clear.  It will be a perfect mirror for travel as it can lay flat.  The optional stand is helpful to stand it up in a corner when not in use.  A very good quality mirror for the price.</li>
    <li> Was so glad to have found this on Amazon!!  I have had one for years and it got broken on my move over!!&lt;br /&gt;They are great!!</li>
    <li> Arrived early (great) M wife loves it.</li>
    <li> This is a great mirror.  The magnifying side is perfect for tweezing and for those who can&#x27;t see well without their glasses.  The other side is a normal mirror.</li>
    <li> I really love this mirror~ they are light but feel like high quality, the size is proper that I can use it for make up~ it&#x27;s not big so i can take it for traveling. I don;t use the 10 times magnificent side, cuz you have to be very close to the mirror to use it.</li>
    <li> This mirror is very well made - good quality, both mirrors without any flaws. It&#x27;s small enough to fit inside my makeup bag. The previous one I bought from QVC was just too large and eventually fell over and broke. This one is easier, and no light bulbs to worry about. I cannot see well, but this really helps me pluck those pesky eyebrow strays! Luvin&#x27; it!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s funny, because I&#x27;ve never had problems with Amazon orders until my last two.  This strange lack of quality control is odd.  The mirror appears to have been opened - the big part, not the stand, was outside of the protective plastic bag, and scratched (not super noticeably) but enough to be annoying.  The stand was inside of the smaller bag, which was in the big bag that should have been around the mirror.  How do I know this?  My BF ordered one, and I liked it so much, I decided to get one too.  His was wrapped properly, and not scratched.  I most likely won&#x27;t be returning this - but I do feel like something odd is going on with Amazon.</li>
    <li> I love this mirror!  The 10X magnification shows everything, but if you can see all that, fix what you can, then you can go out confidently.  The stand makes it more versatile if you have the correct placement, i.e., counter height, seat height, that kind of thing.  Of course, there is the regular mirror, essential for rear views.  Best mirror I ever had.</li>
    <li> I had to purchase a second one! Mine was always being moved to other locations. This item is awesome! It is not bulky, so you can put it away when not in use.</li>
    <li> Nice hand mirror just the right size, I dont plan to use the stand.</li>
    <li> If you have trouble applying makeup, especially mascara, try this mirror.  It has 2 sides, one of which is 10x magnified.  It also has a stand, which other mirrors do not.  I spent lots of time looking for a mirror like this in stores and finally found this one through Amazon.com.  I&#x27;m sure you will love it too.</li>
    <li> Constructed well and stand actually allows for a surprising amount of adjustment. Not sure anyone should see themselves at this sort of magnification however - it is powerful and may take some getting used to. Excellent for those close up jobs. 4 stars since I wish it was a little wider - you have to focus on one part of your face at a time.</li>
    <li> It does what it&#x27;s suppose to do, which magnify - and it does it well. That said, the stability is a real issue. The cheap and narrow plastic holder makes the whole thing pretty inconvenient to use.</li>
    <li> Inexpensive, cheap (yes, the bad kind), but not that cheap to say it was bought from a knockoff brand at Wal Mart. The stand is very simplistic and helpful. It arrived a bit after the initial estimation date using Amazon&#x27;s Prime free two-day shipping but it&#x27;s not like this was a critical item for shipment. The packaging was bare minimum retail and looks like it was inspected so that Amazon wasn&#x27;t sending damaged goods to me. The sealed plastic bags were a nice touch since this item is glass and is delicate.</li>
    <li> This is a very powerful, clear, magnifying mirror. It isn&#x27;t small. But it is still good for travel since it is flat. If you need a strong mirror for travel, this is a good choice. It also functions very well at home. The stand slips a little and needs to be adjusted with each use, but that is not a problem.</li>
    <li> This is a beautiful mirror and great value, but it is much too heavy and large to travel with, especially by air with baggage restrictions.</li>
    <li> I very much like the clear &amp;#34;color&amp;#34; of the mirror and stand.  I find it just a bit difficult to lift the mirror out of the stand, so I tend to pick up the mirror and stand all in one!  The 2-sides are just what I wanted, the magnifier is great.  Thank you</li>
    <li> Arrived in one piece, so no 7-years of  bad luck!!</li>
    <li> We purchased this mirror for our camper.  It works well.  I would have given it 5 stars but the stand is not the best,  The mirror is great.</li>
    <li> LOVE this mirror.  It was the lowest price and highest quality found anywhere on the entire internet.  The BEST magnification I&#x27;ve ever had.  I&#x27;m going to buy another just to keep as a spare.  You will LOVE it too.</li>
    <li> I ordered this mirror and received an empty box. Product package but no mirror inside. When I posted my feedback, it vanished, funny enough. Be wary.</li>
    <li> Postive: Good in use and shape nice, reasonable price, bright and light.&lt;br /&gt;Negative: not easy to hold firm, a bit large.</li>
    <li> I broke the mirror I had used for many years. I bought some at local stores, but they were not the same strength and really did not work for me. I checked on some shopping channels, found this one with good reviews, and cost at least double for what I found it on Amazon. This one works fine for me. I am very pleased with this product and appreciate that I found it at a much lower price.</li>
    <li> I was very upset when I realized that I left my old mirror in a motel in TN!  In searching for a mirror that enabled me to see up close to put on make-up without my glasses and was set up very much like my old one, I came across this one and gave it a try.  I am very pleased with this product.  My old mirror didn&#x27;t magnify as much as the 10X side of this one.  Seeing without my glasses is NO problem.  It looks almost identical to the mirror that I lost (and had used for many years!) and does a great job!</li>
    <li> This mirror is OK and works with the little kickstand that is included.  I don&#x27;t use the magnified side because it is way to big and blurry.</li>
    <li> I have one of these that I purchased somewhere else for much more money! I love it but my cats kept knocking it off the counter, and the holder broke. Was able to glue it a couple of times, but now it can&#x27;t be fixed. At this price I don&#x27;t mind replacing it! Travels well, magnification is great, the adjustability of this sliding holder is really good, I love it! And you can use it as a hand mirror for checking the back of your hair, and for seeing the connections on the back of your computer case! Multi-purpose!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s great for using at home. A little large for travel but I knew this before I ordered. A little to strong on the magnifying side but I will need that soon enough. The mirror is big enough to see the whole area your applying makeup without having to move it all around. Thank you for a very handy mirror.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s impossible to find a magnifying hand mirror with a stand in stores so I was very happy to find one on-line.  It came before the estimated arrival date and is very light weight.  I&#x27;m very happy with it.</li>
    <li> I took this on vacation because I didn&#x27;t want to sacrifice room in my luggage for my bulkier, lighted magnifying mirror, and I&#x27;ve been back a couple of months now and still haven&#x27;t plugged my old mirror in because I just keep this one handy. It&#x27;s solid and well-made. The magnification is great. It&#x27;s easy to hold and the stand works well for hands-free use. Very nice mirror, especially for the price.</li>
    <li> The mirror is just as described, but I had not realized that the stand comes off.  That allows flexibility because you could hang the mirror up, but the stand slides off when you pick up the mirror, so it&#x27;s a bit of a nuisance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also find that the 10x magnification is just a bit too much!  Next time I&#x27;ll look for a mirror with no more than 6x magnification.</li>
    <li> I just failed to note how large it is.&lt;br /&gt;I wanted a small mirror and this is not that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good clear reflection.</li>
    <li> I bought htis for my mother who has macular degeneration.  It helps her to be able to see her face.  Great price and nice to sit on the bathroom counter.</li>
    <li> I like how it comes apart to be a stand alone mirror, however I wish it stood up straighter. You have to lean over it for the 10x to work, and I&#x27;m only 5&#x27;2&amp;#34; with a taller sink.  Update. I&#x27;ve increased my initial rating. I moved into a house with a shorter sink and while I still have to lean over, this does work great.</li>
    <li> This mirror is the clearest I have ever used .The frame is  strong and looks great also the stand comes in handy when you need both hands . I would recommend this product to everyone.</li>
    <li> Good mirror. I selected the 10magnification for the back side. That might be a bit much. 5X is probably plenty for most people.</li>
    <li> This is a replacement for another mirror exactly like it.  The mirror and handle have withstood many falls off the bathroom counter, but the stand was repaired 3 times with epoxy until it couldn&#x27;t be repaired again.  Too bad the stand isn&#x27;t made of stronger stuff.</li>
    <li> I own several of these mirrors and use them in my office.  I have several consultation rooms where people need to look in the mirror frequently, so I keep one of these mirrors in each room.  They have held up nicely over several years without any problems.  I purchased a few more to have at home as well.  Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> This is the best mirror for plucking facial hair--you can see so good and I am very happy with this purchase and would recommend it to anyone!</li>
    <li> This is a high quality item.  At first I was taken aback by the extreme magnification on the one side of the mirror but now like it very much.  You can see every lash of your brows with that one!  It&#x27;s light weight.  There&#x27;s an attachment that lets you set it up for two-hand use when needed.  I am quite happy with it.</li>
    <li> I could not have imagined in reading all the reviews prior to purchase how distorted a mirror could be  and still be boxed up and sold! This is the worst product I&#x27;ve ever bought on amazon.... I think it is the only truly bad product from amazon ever!!! It is so distorted that I simply cannot use it!!! Yikes!!!!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s top heavy and has a tendency to fall over.  I wanted it for changing my Trans-tracheal oxygen scoop catheter.  This is a touchy operation that I must do daily, and to have it fall over while inserting the tube into my trachea invites disaster.  I don&#x27;t know if it would cause problems while putting on make-up or cutting ones own hair, but I think it could</li>
    <li> This is a great mirror for detail work like plucking eye brows if you are fair and have a hard time seeing strays. The only downside is the stand is not particlary frindly to use, you need to be cautious to hve the mirror inserted at a safe angle. But the mirror is clear and good quality.</li>
    <li> Awesome mirror - use it ALL the time.</li>
    <li> Love this mirror.  It is a good quality mirror and the stand is a nice bonus.  I would buy again.  The seller got it to me quickly and well packages.</li>
    <li> Great purchase if your looking for a mirror for limited space, the stand needs to be adjusted up the handle allowing the mirror to stand properly. the magnification is great also!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shipping was lightning fast thanks to Amazons a plus shipping department.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would purchase this item again and it would definitely be a great gift for a loved one at a reasonable price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks Amazon!</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s a mirror, cheap, works as hoped. the stand is a nice touch, even if the angle isn&#x27;t perfect. nothing more special to add.</li>
    <li> I love Floxite mirrors.  They really are distortion-free.  My eyesight is not as good as it once was and I now need magnifying mirrors for make-up.  I have a larger Floxite mirror for at home and this one for traveling.  They many choices of power, 3x and up, this is a very high power, which is perfect for me.</li>
    <li> GREAT MIRROR FOR THE PRICE AND THE STAND MAKES ALL OF THE DIFFERENCE IN THE WORLD WHEN YOU NEED HANDS FREE.</li>
    <li> I was bigger that I expected but it was more beautiful.&lt;br /&gt;Iam very glad with my  purchase.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you very much</li>
    <li> Very pleased with the mirror. Quality seems high and the clear frame/handle gives it a bit of a neutral appearance when it&#x27;s sitting on the bathroom counter. Easily adjusts to whatever angle you prefer by sliding the stand up or down the handle.</li>
    <li> This is great for travel...When I go away, I always bring this with me....not too heavy and does the trick.</li>
    <li> I like that it&#x27;s adjustable but it&#x27;s heavy.</li>
    <li> Nice quality and attractive on the counter</li>
    <li> The mirror does what I purchased it for,a good standard mirror one one side and a great 10x power mirror on the other.  The stand that comes with the mirror works very well, holding the mirror at a very good angle.</li>
    <li> The mirror is okay, but the stand (or whatever it&#x27;s supposed to be) is terrible. it&#x27;s not even and wants to fall over!</li>
    <li> Had this same mirror for years and unfortunately a trip to the floor broke off the handle.  I now have its twin and love it.</li>
    <li> I bought this mirror about 3 years ago.  The legs of the stand have been broken and mended several times, and after the last break I decided I&#x27;ve had enough.  There are more durable options for this price.</li>
    <li> Good price / good quality. Great for putting on eyeliner or plucking eyebrows. Be careful though... 10X wrinkles are that easy to look at.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t be too close when you are tweezing!  This mirror is great for close-up views of every pore and stray hair.  I think other people commented that it was not good for putting on make up because you cvpannot clearly see your whole face - well I think that would be true of anything with this much magnification.  I LOVEthis mirror!</li>
    <li> I was surprised the quality of the mirror was really good, and at such a cheap price too!! Good buy.  I can see what the person who rated this lower was saying about how you have to hold it really close to make the 10x work, but I think that&#x27;s just what most 10x mirrors are like.  It works better then expected.</li>
    <li> Works great like a mirror should, nice glass.</li>
    <li> Great product! It&#x27;s Hugh comparing to my old palm size mirror. I can see clearly my teeth now!</li>
    <li> This is a really cleverly designed product. Unfortunately, it was a bit too low for me to look into on my vanity top so I returned it. If I had a higher place to put it I&#x27;d have kept it for sure.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had a 8x Floxite mirror for 20 years and it is the best mirror I&#x27;ve ever owned.  The stand broke by my fault, and could not find a 8x so I sent for the 10x. It&#x27;s a GREAT mirror!!! I just wish I could find a 8x again, since it works better for me.</li>
    <li> Mainly it wasn&#x27;t broken.  It stands up just fine and is a good mirror!</li>
    <li> This is exactly what I needed for travel. Received it right on time and am very pleased with this purchase.</li>
    <li> Perfect in every way.</li>
    <li> Great product - very happy!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a simple design but works fine nonetheless.  Can be kept in place on a table or easily taken out of the stand to use it.</li>
    <li> Not bad for the price, but it doesn&#x27;t do all that I had hoped.  I happened to use a magnifier mirror in a hotel and was able to see my shaving mistakes, etc. quite a bit better.  This mirror is helpful but it&#x27;s too small to see everything all at once and you really have to get close up.  It&#x27;s OK but I would not have bought this had I seen it first.</li>
    <li> I had a Zadro 7X mirror that traveled with me for many years until I dropped it. I thought I would step up to a 10x mirror and so I bought the Floxite. I don&#x27;t know if it is the extreme curve of the 10X mirror or defective glass, but I have to literally put my nose on the mirror to come into focus. It doesn&#x27;t leave much room for a mascara wand. Also, the handle is about 3/4 of an inch shorter than the Zadro, which was already a little short for ease of use/ good angle when sitting at a table. I really don&#x27;t like this mirror. Now I have to figure how much of a hassle it would be to return.</li>
    <li> There is a lot of warping/distortion with this mirror. The 10x side is very hard to use due to the distortion.</li>
    <li> my wife has been looking for a mirror like this and she loves it, she likes the two sided feature.</li>
    <li> Just what I need with my eyesight. Works very good with and without my glasses for closeup tweezing and chin hair removal.</li>
    <li> I love the fact that you can lay it down in the suit case when you travel and the magnified side is great</li>
    <li> I would give this mirror 5 stars if the stand were more substantial or if I could purchase the holder separately as I now have 4 mirrors and one stand as they do tip over and break after a while.  Have attempted to purchase stand alone from both Floxite and the manufacturer without success.</li>
    <li> Nice, solid mirror.  The stand is a nice addition.  I like the 10x magnifying as many other hand mirrors have less magnification.</li>
    <li> Received it very fast / My grand daughters love it !</li>
    <li> This mirror is too strong and after using a 5x I realized I made a mistake.  I try to use it but the magnification is such that it is almost impossible.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my 18 year old granddaughter for Christmas. She loves it and uses it all the time.</li>
    <li> The mirror itself is sturdy and the magnifying power of the one side is awesome!  My only complaint is the stand, which is a great idea in theory, but it seems cheaply made.</li>
    <li> I had to buy a spare as I can&#x27;t see what I doing anymore with make-up without 10x mirror. This mirror is very nice for my needs</li>
    <li> Happy with this purchase.  The magnifier side is actually quite good and the stand is adjustable.  I bought for travel since one I had broke.</li>
    <li> excellent as expected</li>
    <li> Does the job and very portable! My husband likes it also!</li>
    <li> This mirror is fantastic - good weight, very clear mirror and large enough to use to apply makeup on the 7X size with no problem.  I had gotten a wall mount, and while it was great it was just too large for the space.  So wanted a handheld mirror that would give me the magnification I needed while being a good size and not heavy.  This mirror fit that perfectly!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know why I waited so long to purchase this quality mirror. The clarity is excellent, and the price was right. I use it everyday.</li>
    <li> Love this mirror, but be prepared to want to tweeze every lil thing on your face, even something that may just become something...be careful, you can literally see inside your brain it&#x27;s soo powerful!</li>
    <li> Good price, shipped quickly and good quality.  It is hard to find a 10x handheld.  She loves it.</li>
    <li> I was hoping for best though skeptical, and this mirror exceeded expectations. I was reading up on other normal hand mirrors on Amazon where a lot of people seem to complain either about mirror quality or craftmanship (mirror flimsy, heavy etc). However this one is definitely good for travel and the little kick stand works as indicated. Nothing to set up or complicated to figure out. The mirror is a good size, can hold up easily nor do I feel it&#x27;s a low quality item as it seems sturdy enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The mirror has 2 sides, 1 side that is normal and other is supposed to be 10x magnification. The one qualm is with the 10x magnification side, it doesn&#x27;t really magnify cleary and what you see if kind of distorted but I don&#x27;t really need that side so I don&#x27;t mind. That might be a deal breaker for some people though.</li>
    <li> This mirror has a very strong magnification, which I like.  I use the magnification side it to apply my makeup and it&#x27;s nice to have he opposite side for a normal  view.  I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> This little mirror has made my life easier and goes with me every time I travel. It is a 10X magnifier on one side and standard on the other. Just the right size! I keep having to replace it due to friends begging me to leave it for them! It comes with a stand I rarely use..but it&#x27;s there if needed. No worries here you will love it.</li>
    <li> My husband uses this marrow all the time. He has to sit to shave and this works great.</li>
    <li> I travel a lot, and I love how I can tote this along (with the stand) and have a decent magnifying mirror for applying makeup and getting those stray eyebrows--AND be able to see the back of my hairstyle with the same mirror.  Very good quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use the stand a LOT, unlike the previous reviewer.  It is infinitely variable, so you can put it just about anywhere (in hotels, you have to put up with some weird angles to get good lighting!) and still be able to have hands-free use!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good invention:  thanks!</li>
    <li> No more problem to make up eyes or applied lipstick, etc !! , This the 3rd one, I CAN &#x27; T lived without.it.</li>
    <li> use it all the time when shaving.</li>
    <li> It works well with no need for batteries. It&#x27;s fine even though there is no light in the unit. I&#x27;ve only used the 10X side. I&#x27;m really happy with it.</li>
    <li> I ordered this for my mom who need a light that she could hold in her hand easily and place on a stand.  I was a but concerned when I saw the &#x27;stand&#x27; but believe me...it works like magic!  This is a great product, received in a timely manner, and packaged nicely.</li>
    <li> I love it.  I can place on my desk using the stand and it&#x27;s nice to be able to change the tilt.  Would definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> Great mirror  for travel.  easy to pack and gives me the large magnification i need.  I can&#x27;t  see close up without glasses.  I can see with the mirrors so I can put my makeup  on.</li>
    <li> The size of this mirror is perfect for traveling and I like the attachment (easy to put on and take off) which allows you to place it (at different angles) on a countertop to make it hands free. *** Note, that even though the mirror is 5&amp;#34; in diameter, with magnifying mirrors, you need it about 7-8&amp;#34; from your face to bring it into &amp;#34;focus&amp;#34;. This means you can&#x27;t see your entire face at one time like you can with a standard mirror. But for those of us with aging eyes, who need help to pluck stray hairs or to apply our eye makeup, having targeted magnification is a godsend. If you don&#x27;t hold it close enough you WILL have distortion. I started with a 5x magnification mirror years ago, and have worked my way through 7x, 9x, and now 10x. Floxite really makes the best magnification mirrors.</li>
    <li> great for hand held or sitting on counter</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a standard mirror.  However, the plastic stand did not fit through the handle, so I had to use sandpaper on the stand.  Also, even with the stand, it&#x27;s not that stable.  Stable enough though for three stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This should be no more that $12.</li>
    <li> Flimsy Horrible product!  I sent it back!</li>
    <li> Excellent quality.  I will buy again.</li>
    <li> I can see to put  my mascara on again!!  Plus I found I few hairs I didn&#x27;t know I had.  Bummer getting older</li>
    <li> Love this mirror and the stand comes in handy when trying to style the back of my head.  my only reason for not giving 5 stars the magnifying side is a lithe tough to use, make my eyes hurt.  the normal side is fantastic, scratch free, light weight and really fits int he hand great</li>
    <li> At first sight, the mirror looked fine.  I considered how high to install it, next to my bathroom sink.  However, when I read the text on the box, I learned that the mirror could NOT be installed anywhere where it could catch sunllight as it might catch fire!  My bathroom is small, and there is no place on any wall that would be a suitable location where it mirror wouldn&#x27;t catch sunlight, so that was that.  This is very unfortunate. Right now the mirror is stowed away in a drawer until I can figure out who could use it.</li>
    <li> This is a great mirror for the price. The clarity is good. It is great for travel, but also great at home. I had a similar one for many years which finally broke. It was much more expensive. I did not think the quality would compare, but it does. I am very satisfied. I also bought one for a gift.</li>
    <li> 10 x mirror we need to hold it very close to see it properly</li>
    <li> Great mirror for the price, I love that you can set it on the counter or hang it for more counter space.</li>
    <li> I had purchased a mirror similar to this for my Mother about 10 years ago and she dropped it a month or so ago and broke it. When I sent her this new one she was ecstatic!! She said it&#x27;s better than the other one (and she loved that one!) nice to be able to give a 93 year old sweetheart a lil joy in her day. 😊</li>
    <li> This is a great mirror, but I had the same one several years ago and it cost about half as much.</li>
    <li> Great mirror! I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> This was a reorder, as I accidentally broke the first one. Just what I wanted.</li>
</ol>
