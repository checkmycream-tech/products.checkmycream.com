      <li>Good thing</li>
      <li>Good power though</li>
      <li>I bought this hair dryer for my grandchild, who loved mine.</li>

      <li>I kept buying them because I liked the cordkeeper function.  </li>
      <li>Nice color.</li>
      <li>I bought it honestly because it was inexpensive</li>
      <li>The cord keeper also helped to keep it tidy.</li>
      <li>I now (very happily) own a [[ASIN:B000R80ZTQ Infiniti by Conair 223 Cord Reel Folding Handle Dryer]], which, despite Amazon&#x27;s title, does not have a folding handle.    </li>
      <li>Very good blow dryer and the rewinding mechanism works very well.  </li>
      <li>I like that as I honestly think it&#x27;s better for your hair and the power of the air from the dryer does the job.  </li>
      <li>I went with this model, because my old Conair worked wonderfully.</li>
      <li>I liked that feature for easy storage.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve never had a lot of hair (shoulder length at most)</li>
      <li>I love my hair dryer.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s been dropped more times than I would like to count and it kept on ticking.</li>
      <li>Except for two month-long periods, in which I got a haircut that required more attention.    </li>
      <li>We both love the way it works drying her hair.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m giving it a couple more months and will determine whether I like it more than 3 stars.....</li>
      <li>I LOVE the retractable cord</li>
      <li>Overall, great product!</li>
      <li>I love this hair-dryer.</li>
      <li>and I love the retrackable cord.</li>
      <li>I bought this hair dryer to replace another Conair I had for many years.  </li>
      <li>I bought this dryer for a vacation in 2004, and was pleased with it.  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know why I have to add more words to my review.  </li>
      <li>I thought having the retractable cord would help to keep it out of his mouth and help keep me better organized.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m getting rid of it and getting something that doesn&#x27;t cause this many problems.  </li>
      <li>I have used this hairdryer for many years now, but they always seem to overheat.  </li>
      <li>Love the retractable cord, the folding handle and the 120/220 option for traveling.</li>
      <li>I love the design.</li>
      <li>I have had this hair dyer for YEARS and love it.  </li>
      <li>I specifically love that it folds to a better shape for packing in a suitcase and the retractable cord.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve burned this hair blower out drying clothes more times than I can recount.</li>
      <li>This is a great hair dryer to pack in luggage because the cord retracts and the whole thing folds, so it&#x27;s easy to shove in a corner.</li>
      <li>Since our bathroom cabinet is short on space, I loved the IDEA of this hair dryer!</li>
      <li>Love the design - powerful &amp; convenient!  </li>
      <li>The fold up handle allows for easy packing.  </li>
      <li>Easy to store and use</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s still going strong.     </li>
      <li>it&#x27;s still sort of going strong.  </li>
      <li>This new Conair was very good for the first 6 months</li>
      <li>The controls let you choose from warm and hot.</li>
      <li>Mine worked fine for a while.</li>
      <li>It worked fine for 2 -3  weeks</li>
      <li>I love the style, the brand and by using it my hair dries quickly.</li>
      <li>This little hair dryer is great for travel since the cord retracts on its own and folds.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a very powerful hair dryer, which is fine, as I have a lot of hair.  </li>
      <li>To return it would be more of a hassle and expense than its worth and Conair knows this</li>
      <li>I straightened the collasable handle and heard a cracking sound.  </li>
      <li>i believe its components are so cheap that they do not resist being taken apart.....</li>
      <li>The retractable cord is a nice idea, but if it retracts too fast you end up with bruises from it hitting you in the arm.  </li>
      <li>Overall I&#x27;m happy with it</li>
      <li>Made cheap now days.</li>
      <li>I was happy with it until last week.  </li>
      <li>We had our old Conair for years and loved it, so I got a replacement.  </li>
      <li>I thought mine was kind of an anomoly since it is so much older than a lot of hair dryers</li>
      <li>perfect for travel because of what little space it takes up and the retractable cord is a blessing!</li>
      <li>so this always did the trick for me and since I lived in small places, the fact it folded up made it perfect.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Imagine my horror on reading the negative reviews on the Conair HairDryer 1875. Don&#x27;t know when the other folks bought theirs, but I must have bought mine about four years ago and it&#x27;s still going strong.     It wasn&#x27;t my first choice, but danged if this isn&#x27;t one of the top two TOUGHEST hair blowers I&#x27;ve ever owned. I keep mine on the edge of a bathroom counter where it doesn&#x27;t belong. This is because the outlet is on that side. Since I live in an apartment, I haven&#x27;t made major improvements to rectify the situation.     Every other day I bump the thing and it lands on the floor. I&#x27;ve burned this hair blower out drying clothes more times than I can recount. When that happens as it did moments ago, I let it sit a while and it comes back on like the Eveready Rabbit. I use the blower nearly every day on my hair.    If you knew how many times this thing has gone kapoot! and bumppity bump, you wouldn&#x27;t believe it. Maybe I was one of the lucky ones. It&#x27;s really larger than I need, but since it doubles as a clothes dryer, I guess it&#x27;s okay.</li>
    <li> I loved the idea of a hair dryer with a retractable cord, and I have always had success with Conair in the past, so I was so disappointed when I started using the Cord Keeper and found it was just too loud to use.  I literally had to put my finger in my left ear to keep it from crackling when I used this dryer.  I mentioned that I had to take a hair dryer back to the store when my son and daughter-in-law were visiting, and they said they had a hair dryer that was too loud too.  It turns out it was the SAME model!</li>
    <li> Basically, this dryer has three temperatures: COLD, COOL, AND WARM. This dryer only warms up (barely)if used in the ultra-loud, fast speed. If used in the lower speed, it barely warms up to room temperature. It&#x27;s no better than the wind blowing thru my hair!     If I wanted the wind to dry my hair, I would have bought a sports car! I need my hair dryer to get HOT!</li>
    <li> I bought this dryer for a vacation in 2004, and was pleased with it.  After my regular dryer died 4 years ago, I decided to get this one out and have been using it every since. It does a great job, and I have had no problems with it.</li>
    <li> I bought this dryer to replace my 10 year old conair, when it gets hot it would stop.  Good thing I didn&#x27;t throw it away. This cordkeeper only worked for about 4 months.  It is also very LOUD! ALmost hurt my ears to use it</li>
    <li> I had this hairdryer prior to this purchase (although in a different color), and I loved it. It started making a strange noise last month; I&#x27;d had it about two years by then. I was happy to get the exact same one again. I wasn&#x27;t looking for a fancy hair dryer, just one with two settings (high and low) and enough power to get the job done. This one has good strength and it&#x27;s compact enough to fit into my small bathroom drawer. I don&#x27;t usually use the cord keeper feature, but it works well and doesn&#x27;t seem flimsy or shoddy. This is a great hair dryer to pack in luggage because the cord retracts and the whole thing folds, so it&#x27;s easy to shove in a corner. Overall, great product!</li>
    <li> I have bought hair dryers that lasted years and years with daily use. This one I had for 3 months and it just stop working. Don&#x27;t waste your money on this item.</li>
    <li> I bought this hair dryer because I have the larger version that I use at home and I wanted the same quality for when I travel.  This packs well and I love the retrackable cord.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my wife.  She has tried 3 different times to use it.  Every time it is used it blows the circuit and fry&#x27;s the gfci.  We have had many Conair hairdryers, and this is a first.  It is too powerful.  The other older hairdryers have no problem.  Stay away from this purchase.  It has cost us 85.00 in repair bills.  They need to ship this back to China.  Even the electrician we had over could not believe it.</li>
    <li> Very powerful-dries hair faster. Folds and cord retracts. Very good for travelling. Nice color. Very good product for the price.</li>
    <li> Love the design - powerful &amp; convenient!  But I don&#x27;t use it everyday. My last one lasted for 4 years.</li>
    <li> I got this to replace another Conair dryer that I LOVED.  I wish they would stick with their old way of doing things instead of \\&quot;improving.\\&quot;  It isn&#x27;t as kind to my hair while drying and is too painful to my ears.  Am returning it.</li>
    <li> I was really suprised with the poor quality of this hair dryer.  Over the past many years, I have used the Conair brand.  After just a few uses, the retractable cord stopped retracting and the COOL air button no longer popped back up, so I all I was able to do was dry my hair with cool air.  Once I folded it up, a plastic part in the dryer broke and a spring fell out as well.  I purchased a cheaper non folding, non retractable cord dryer and it works better than this more expensive model.  Save your cash and do not buy this.</li>
    <li> Works just as expected.  It folds and with the retractable cord, it occupies minimal space.  Power is enough, why pay more??</li>
    <li> I bought the silver colored version of this at Target about 5 months ago.  I was happy with it until last week.  I straightened the collasable handle and heard a cracking sound.  The handle would no longer stay straight when I used the machine.  Like some of the other reviewers I found, upon opening up the device, that the very cheap plastic piece that kept the handle in the locked position had broken.  There was no way to fix it and it wasn&#x27;t worth the hassle and expense to mail it in for repair.  So I bought a different brand last night.  I&#x27;m very unhappy with this product.</li>
    <li> I have had this hair dyer for YEARS and love it.  I specifically love that it folds to a better shape for packing in a suitcase and the retractable cord.  Mine finally bit the dust and I am so happy I found the same one here for a decent price.  There is a newer model that is just NOT the same as it doesn&#x27;t fold as flush as this one does.  The drying is basic &amp;#34;high, low, cool&amp;#34; and my hair dries super-fast.  I hope this one lasts as long as my last one did!</li>
    <li> I have been a long time user and fan of the Conair Cord Keeper hairdryers.  I use them until they just die.  Recently Conair changed the look of this hairdryer and at first sight I thought that it felt much more flimsy than my previous Cord Keepers but did not give it much thought since I have always been very pleased with this hairdryer.  The hairdryer lasted about 2 weeks before the folding handle cracked.  When we opened up the handle we found that the plastic piece that makes the handle fold was cracked in half and did not appear repairable.  I went out and purchased another Cord Keeper thinking that I just had a &#x27;lemon&#x27;, well the second one lasted exactly 3 months and 1 day.  Today I pulled out the hairdryer, opened the handle and heard a crack.  This handle is also broken which prevents the hairdryer from staying in the open position. The product does have a 2 yr warranty but you are required to ship the defective product to a Conair service center along with $3 for shipping and handling - this would cost me more than the hairdryer, just not worth my time to box it up and take it to the post office!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That being said, when this hairdryer worked it was wonderful.  The two speed settings are the perfect speeds, the hairdryer is extremely light and the handle is easy to grip.  The retractable cord is the best feature of this hairdryer and along with the folding handle it is great for travel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did write to Conair and their response will determine if I purchase another Conair hairdryer plus I will be back to update this review.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been through 2 of these hair dryers. The first one stopped working after a year. The second one&#x27;s cord twisted up and could not fully retract. For about a week it keep going on and off. This morning the cord sparked, smoked, and started to flame. I will not purchase this hair dryer again.</li>
    <li> There are not separate buttons for heat and air and there is hardly any heat on the &#x27;low&#x27; setting. Quit after 3 months.</li>
    <li> I bought this dryer as a replacement for one that my puppy managed to chew the cord on.  My \\&quot;old\\&quot; dryer which I had for years, worked WONDERFULLY!  I thought having the retractable cord would help to keep it out of his mouth and help keep me better organized.  Too bad after less than 10 uses the \\&quot;retractability\\&quot; of the machine&#x27;s cord stopped.  Unfortunatly, this did not happen with the cord out.  Furthermore, I was very disappointed with the force of the air - even on high.  For the amount of noise it produced, I expected to be getting my hair blown dry in a windtunnel.  I tried to take it apart to see it I could fix the cord, but the whole thing fell apart and I threw it in the garbage where it belonged.  Too bad I didn&#x27;t spend my time prior to purchasing it reading the reviews.  SAVE YOUR MONEY!!!!</li>
    <li> Just used one of these, now my ears are ringing! If you value your hearing, stay away from this model.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Plus, its \\&quot;high\\&quot; temp is really \\&quot;medium\\&quot;, compared to other hair dryers I&#x27;ve used. So it takes twice as long to dry your hair, all the while damaging your ear drums.</li>
    <li> Unfortunately, like other reviewers here, my Conair 1875 watt ionic cord keeper died after a few months of use. While it was working it was excellent. But I don&#x27;t expect a hair dryer to die after just a few months. Buy something else!</li>
    <li> Well, my hairdryer hasn&#x27;t started any fires, but it also hasn&#x27;t worked correctly since right after I bought it either.  The retractable cord doesn&#x27;t retract anymore.  The button broke off that controls that and, in general, it just isn&#x27;t a good quality hair dryer.  Pieces of a hair dryer shouldn&#x27;t just break off.  I bought a ConAir product because they aren&#x27;t too expensive and last a really long time, but now I&#x27;m thinking I should go ahead and spend over $75 for a hair dryer just so it doesn&#x27;t fall apart.</li>
    <li> I bought this hair dryer to replace another Conair I had for many years.  After one year I am going back to my old one.  There is NO WAY to clean the vents on this one and it heats up HOT.  It burned the top of my ear the other day.  The retractable cord is a nice idea, but if it retracts too fast you end up with bruises from it hitting you in the arm.  Look for the Conair dryers that have vents that can be cleaned and they will last you a good long time.  Then only good thing about it is it travels well.</li>
    <li> first of all , let me be clear that the materials used in this dryer are NOT first quality....on the other hand the design is extraordinary.......i use mine on a daily basis and , provided you use them with (extra) care they will last more than a year......repairable?......dont think about it .if you open the folding handle, it will break apart in your hands.......i believe its components are so cheap that they do not resist being taken apart.....this product has been (since the begining)assembled in south america, just to seek the cheapest manufacturing process.</li>
    <li> This is my second Conair Ionic hairdryer. This was exactly what I wanted and was not disappointed. Love the retractable cord, the folding handle and the 120/220 option for traveling.</li>
    <li> I like the way this dryer dries my hair - quickly and frizzlessly.  The cord is not long enough!  My outlet is waist high, I am 5&#x27;6\\&quot; tall and I have trouble geting the dryer above my head to dry my hair.  On the second use, I tugged a bit too hard to get the unit high enough to use and the cord got stuck and no longer retracts.</li>
    <li> My last one burnt out after 3 years of use. Hope this one will last longer. It works very well especially when 3 people use it daily.</li>
    <li> This is my third one of these I&#x27;ve purchased.  Not because they keep dying but because I want one everywhere!  I originally bought this as a travel hairdryer and ended up liking it more than my everyday hairdryer.  After several years of everyday use, it finally died so I bought a new one.  And then I bought one to keep in our camper.  Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> This blow dryer is great for traveling.  The fold up handle allows for easy packing.  The cord retractor is great</li>
    <li> During normal use, the point where the cord enters the protector on the plug developed a bad connection such that it would only work when the cord was in a certain position. We had the same hair dryer before purchasing this one, and the same issue occurred, and eventually it just stopped working all together.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This time around though...while using it, the cord sparked/shorted and started on fire in the wall socket. The dryer works well when it&#x27;s not trying to burn the house down and the cord functions properly (if that&#x27;s something you&#x27;re looking for). There is clearly a quality control issue with this product and I&#x27;d suggest you try something else.</li>
    <li> It worked fine for 2 -3  weeks and then it would get about half way through blow drying my SHORT hair and it would just stop.  I had to let it rest for 10 minutes and then it worked again.  Gradually the time it worked got shorter and shorter and eventually it just stopped all together.  Very frustrating.  Go get a professional dryer.  it might cost a bit more but it&#x27;ll work!  And probably for a long time!</li>
    <li> Since our bathroom cabinet is short on space, I loved the IDEA of this hair dryer! Unfortunately, the idea was more a fantasy than a reality. I only had this hair dryer for about a month before the cord-keeper button fell out (spring and all!) and the retractible cord stopped retracting. Since that was the only reason I bought this one over other models, I was sorely disappointed! Also, this dryer is so L-O-U-D that I had to wear earplugs (no kidding!) while drying my hair so that I wouldn&#x27;t damage my hearing! Hands down the WORST hair dryer on the market!</li>
    <li> Mine worked fine for a while. I&#x27;ve had it about a year but I didn&#x27;t use it all that much until about a 2 months ago. After about a month the little plastic piece that you push to retract the cord broke so now no retractable cord. I liked that feature for easy storage. So far everything else still works. I&#x27;ll keep you posted.</li>
    <li> I love this hair-dryer. First saw it in a hotel and was like woah \\&quot;no cord\\&quot; - so I ordered one and have been using it for over 2 years now. Works perfectly. Stores small, has plenty of power.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now I am curious if I can find a diffuser attachment for it!? Anybody know?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;M</li>
    <li> Whenever I look behind my TV, I notice the mess of cables and cords, and it haunts me. This hair dryer is a life saver. The retractable cord should be standard on many appliances.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That being said, don&#x27;t pull on it too hard. After too many times of doing that, you might just end up having to buy a new one. Lesson learned.</li>
    <li> Great hairdryer, lots of power, lightweight, retractable cord, the color is great and its the best dryer I&#x27;ve purchased.  I don&#x27;t know why I have to add more words to my review.  A few words should be sufficient!!</li>
    <li> DON&#x27;T but this hairdryer.  I had mine for about a month when the retractable cord broke, button, spring and all... and then this afternoon I was drying my hair when it suddenly turned off and fire shot out of the cord and melted the plastic coating and started smoking.  It was EXTREMELY startling and a huge hazard.  Now I am sitting here with wet hair and looking up similar stories ... Please dont buy this product!</li>
    <li> After only 2 weeks of once-a-day use the cord will not stay extended. Solution was to pull it all the way out and tie a knot in the cord.&lt;br /&gt;Conair products are now on my personal black list.</li>
    <li> I have used this hairdryer for many years now, but they always seem to overheat.  I LOVE the retractable cord so I just keep buying them.  THey recently changed the style and added the \\&quot;Ionic\\&quot; part.  The hairdryer is a bit heavier than the old version and the \\&quot;ionic\\&quot; stuff actually makes my hair a bit limper.  I&#x27;m giving it a couple more months and will determine whether I like it more than 3 stars.....</li>
    <li> I bought this product Dec 8,2006, and it lasted till Aug 20, 2007.  It&#x27;s not worth the cost to ship back.  It just stopped working.  My last Conair hair dryer lasted some 15 or more years.  Think I&#x27;ll check out some other brands by checking out these great reviews on Amazon. Don&#x27;t buy this hair dryer, you will be greatly disappointed.</li>
    <li> I really hate this hair dryer.  Absolutely every single time I use it, it shorts out and won&#x27;t turn back on for at least 10 minutes.  You want to talk about stress?  Try getting ready to run out the door and never knowing if your hair dryer will actually finish the job before it calls it quits.  And, even if I&#x27;ve only used it for 1 minute, if I turn this dryer off, it won&#x27;t turn on again for at least 10 minutes.  How can a stupid hair dryer overheat in ONE MINUTE?  If the phone rings or my husband calls, I have to let this thing keep running because I KNOW it won&#x27;t turn back on.      I hate this piece of junk and am online right now trying to buy something else to replace it!</li>
    <li> At first it was great, but after about 6 months the dryer randomly stopped working and now, not even a year old has stopped working completely :(</li>
    <li> Loved the lightweight and compactible dryer until stopped working about 4 months after purchase date. It would stop in the middle of drying my hair and then go on and off every few seconds. Very annoying. I will not buy another.</li>
    <li> First of all, this dryer dried my hair faster than any dryer I&#x27;ve ever had.  Loved that part. I have long thick hair that takes a long time to dry with most dryers.  The cord keeper part broke right away.  Like other reviewers, the button just popped right off, spring and all.  I didnt&#x27; care much about that part anyway.  I&#x27;ve had the dryer for 5 years and it&#x27;s still sort of going strong.  This is a long time for a hair dryer and I&#x27;m currently shopping for another and probably won&#x27;t buy this one again.  The plug has started falling apart and I now have duct tape holding it together and it gets so hot that it started to melt my outlet.  I have stopped using it as I think it is now a fire hazard.  I thought mine was kind of an anomoly since it is so much older than a lot of hair dryers but it seems as though it may be something that is an issue with this model as I am reading the other reviews.  Loved the heat it put out and the speed at which it dried my hair and it&#x27;s longevity.  Not a big fan of the cord keeper part that busted right away or the plug portion that fell apart requiring duct tape and began to melt my outlet.</li>
    <li> Like many out there, my last Conair dryer lasted nearly 20 years.  This new Conair was very good for the first 6 months but now it only wants to remain in the convenient fold down/storage position.  It&#x27;s like someone broke it&#x27;s little red neck.</li>
    <li> This hair dryer is the BEST!  It dries your hair in half the time a regular hair dryer would do it.  It really helps for an on-the-go mom!</li>
    <li> It is reasonably small and easy to handle.  Great for packing to take along on trips.  Easy to store and use</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had no issues with this hairdryer for 3 years. It&#x27;s amazing. The cord gets stuck SOMETIMES, but you just have to pull it out, then feed it in yourself. Suck it up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did, however, run into a snag today. After 3 years, you can imagine it&#x27;s collected from dust in the \\&quot;filter\\&quot;. I tried to take it apart to clean it so its life would last longer. I now sincerely believe they made it to where you cannot clean the filter and are forced to buy another!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The filter isn&#x27;t easy accessible, but rather, you have to unscrew every screw and open the entire hairdryer. The pieces inside aren&#x27;t sealed down, so they go flying everywhere when you open this thing. I had no clue how to piece it back together, and now I&#x27;ll be buying another hairdryer with an easier filter to access. :P</li>
    <li> I have had it for quite a while now and it works great!!  Very good blow dryer and the rewinding mechanism works very well.  I love the way it folds down very small, too.  Great purchase!</li>
    <li> I love my hair dryer. It is not all together fancy and just like every other retractable you need to be gentle with it. If you don&#x27;t know how to finesse a retractable cord then don&#x27;t buy one...or just be prepared for it to break and no longer have that convenient feature. I think it is a great dryer for the price.</li>
    <li> Great hair dryer . Wife loves the retractable cord and compact size. After using the hair dryer for about a year, the cord broke inside causing the dryer to shut on and off.  The warranty is about useless because after paying all the shipping costs both ways, it costs as much as buying a new one.</li>
    <li> My daughter was very happy with the way the Dryer performs. It was a great gift for the money. Thanks</li>
    <li> First off, this is pretty big for a portable hair dryer. Second, this baby is loud. Especially since this is used for your hair, you&#x27;ll be holding it pretty close to your ears. And third, I don&#x27;t about all the reviews saying this dryer doesn&#x27;t get hot enough. The controls let you choose from warm and hot. Mine gets plenty hot when I put it to hot. But it&#x27;s not good for you hair to use hot anyway, so stick with the warm. I wish there was a setting for cool, because my thumb gets really tired after holding the \\&quot;Cool\\&quot; button down for a while. But if you&#x27;re looking for a portable hair dryer that works and does what it&#x27;s supposed to, this can be an acceptable one.</li>
    <li> Bought it because another (same model couple years old) but cord doesn&#x27;t retract. Tired of things not working as advertised and sending back. Made cheap now days.</li>
    <li> love this hair dryer! perfect for travel because of what little space it takes up and the retractable cord is a blessing!</li>
    <li> We had our old Conair for years and loved it, so I got a replacement.  The new one keeps flipping the fuse switch in the switch box, so all the lights and electric go off in the bathroom, so I&#x27;ve had to stop using our master bathroom to dry my hair, which is ridiculous.  I&#x27;m getting rid of it and getting something that doesn&#x27;t cause this many problems.  I tried to be a loyal customer, but this is how I&#x27;m repaid, by a crummy product.  We&#x27;re done with Conair.</li>
    <li> I bought this hair dryer for my grandchild, who loved mine. We both love the way it works drying her hair. She has very thick hair, and this dryer does a wonderful job drying it, and helping to style her hair as well. I would buy another one if I ever needed it.</li>
    <li> I had one of these things for nearly 13 years (It lasted longer than one of my marriages). I bought it when I managed a salon and needed something when I was on the go. I&#x27;ve never had a lot of hair (shoulder length at most) so this always did the trick for me and since I lived in small places, the fact it folded up made it perfect. The cord keeper also helped to keep it tidy. Yes it&#x27;s loud but it&#x27;s a freaking travel sized HAIR DRYER and that&#x27;s what they do! (shesh) Honestly I find it no louder than a standard hairdryer. Anyway I&#x27;ve had ZERO complaints with this hairdryer from me or anyone else that has used it over the years. It has been steady and a hardy little thing. It&#x27;s been dropped more times than I would like to count and it kept on ticking. Till three days ago when it finally died. The reset button failed to set and I can no longer use it. It was a good little thing and I shall miss it. Would I buy one again? Why do you think I&#x27;m here leaving feedback on the page? I&#x27;m waiting for confirmation on my new one.</li>
    <li> After using it, I turned off the hair dryer and put it down.  The hair dryer came back on, caught fire and left a very bad smell in the house.</li>
    <li> This is a very suitable for traveling hair dryer. I like the way that the cord is retractable so it&#x27;s very practical to travel. It may be a bit bigger than other portable hair dryiers but that way&#x27;s because it&#x27;s 1875w which makes it powerful too. Overall I&#x27;m happy with it and I take it traveling with me every trip.</li>
    <li> Bought this hairdryer a month ago and as we speak it is in a landfill somewhere.  What a piece of junk.  Just stopped working one day.  Would&#x27;nt turn on at all. To return it would be more of a hassle and expense than its worth and Conair knows this so they continue to produce inferior products knowing they won&#x27;t get them back.  The retractable cord worked when it felt like it.  Don&#x27;t waste your money on this one.</li>
    <li> Thanks package arrived on time&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Always needful around the house or my hair d when ever it is needed ever</li>
    <li> If you are purchasing this dryer solely for the cord retraction feature, you will be very disappointed.  Very seldom does the last 10-12 inches retract into the handle.</li>
    <li> The first thing I did was pull out the cord to see if it retracted. Apparently the cord doesn&#x27;t retract if you &amp;#34;pull it out too far&amp;#34; as I read later in the directions. If they make a hair dryer where you have to read the directions before using it, the company is doing it wrong. I didn&#x27;t even bothering using it I was so angry.</li>
    <li> I like this hair dryer.  It has a retractable cord, which helps with storage and keeps cord neat.  A bit loud on high, but I have yet to find a reasonably priced hair dryer that is not loud.  Good dryer for the price and Conair has a good reputation.</li>
    <li> We have one already just like it and the wife loves it and that is why we bought another one.A Bargain.Our old one is 6 years old and we are ready for the new one.</li>
    <li> Works great. Exactly what I expected. Love the retractable cord, and it has enough power to dry my hair quickly.</li>
    <li> Button to retract the dryer cord with cracked</li>
    <li> I bought this hair dryer for $15. The actual unit lasted 4 1/2 years of daily use. The retractable cord bit stopped working after about a year.</li>
    <li> I have used three of these.  The first two each lasted a year before shorting out.  I kept buying them because I liked the cordkeeper function.  This last one, though, shorted out and started a fire.  I have notified the company and will see what happens.  But I doubt that I will purchase another.  It&#x27;s obvious that this product has an engineering or manufacturing flaw and should be pulled off the market.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this hair dryer for almost 4 1/2 years now and never have had a problem with it. I bought it honestly because it was inexpensive and I love that it&#x27;s not huge, makes it easier to handle as I hate blow dryers with a long, heavy body. The way folds up is also great for putting it away. I only now am going to need to buy a diffuser as I&#x27;m going back to my naturally curly hair. That&#x27;s the only complaint I have and hope this dryer lasts me a good while longer!</li>
    <li> I got so fed up with this dryer, I gave up on it after just a couple of months.  I now (very happily) own a [[ASIN:B000R80ZTQ Infiniti by Conair 223 Cord Reel Folding Handle Dryer]], which, despite Amazon&#x27;s title, does not have a folding handle.    This was my second hair dryer with a cord reel, which I find convenient, but there are several things I really hate about it.  It is very noisy and I have to turn the radio up loud to hear the news--even when using the slow speed.  You should be concerned about hearing loss if you use this.  The cord is way too short (4 feet) and when retracting it, rewinds so quickly that the plug whips around and hits me painfully in the hand.  I have to be careful about how to hold it when retracting the cord.  It also had only fast/hot and slow/warm settings.  I prefer to use high heat and a slow speed, but that is not available on this cheap piece of junk.    I highly recommend you do not waste your money on this hair dryer.</li>
    <li> i NEEDED A DRYER ASAP AND DID NOT WANT TO SPEND A FORTUNE. THIS IS A GREAT DRYER. i AM DISABLED SO THIS IS NOT TOO HEAVY TO HOLD UP. RETRACTABLE CORD IS A DEFINITE PLUS. CAME WELL PACKAGED. GREAT BUY!</li>
    <li> I have owned quite a few Conair products but nevrr again. The cordless wonder has been a problem from the beginning and worked every once in a while. It is less than a year old. I wish I had seen the other reviews before I bought it because I had the same trouble with it. When I called for help I was told to mail back and then they would send me as new one. And in the mean time?The guy had no answer. Duh I have buy another dryer. I have learned a valuable lesson. Research products before you buy them. I wonder if the 20 something 5 star people are still happy with their dryers.</li>
    <li> This hair dryer was everything I wanted: retractable cord, folded for space concerns, relatively light-weight. Worked well enough for me. However, it broke today...but I&#x27;ve had the thing for three years. I&#x27;ve used it pretty sparingly, maybe drying my hair once a week? Tops? Except for two month-long periods, in which I got a haircut that required more attention.    I&#x27;m going to buy a similar one, I think. I love the design. &lt;3 I&#x27;m so, so sad that it&#x27;s dead.</li>
    <li> It is unique and portable. I love the style, the brand and by using it my hair dries quickly. I would recommend it to everyone who needs a blow dryer. Thank you</li>
    <li> Had the features I wanted like cool shot and retractable cord. The dimensions are accurate, but unfortunately, it&#x27;s just a lot bigger and heavier than I expected. Additionally, the folding mechanism and the materials feel pretty cheap, and I&#x27;m not certain how long this hairdryer will actually last.</li>
    <li> You know the plug is just to big for most of the outlets. Hangs down too much and hits the counter tops.  Good power though</li>
    <li> Do not  buy this Hair dryer! Mine caught fire when it was plugged in  but not turned on. If I had not been home it  would have burned down my house! As it was, I smelled smoke and  was able to put out the fire! Very scary ! I was  lucky I did not get burned and nothing was damaged. I will never buy another Conair product again!&lt;br /&gt;C.</li>
    <li> I was unsure of this hairdryer at first as I was having issues with the retractable cord (and that was one of my main reasons for my purchase!).  After getting the hang of manipulating the button and removing all the tags on the cord, it now works perfectly!  It has a lot of power but it does not get as hot as my previous hairdryer.  I like that as I honestly think it&#x27;s better for your hair and the power of the air from the dryer does the job.  I highly recommend!</li>
    <li> retracting cord did not work after a few days!</li>
    <li> This blow dryer was purchased to replace a similar one.......just love the fact that the cord retracts!  It&#x27;s not cumbersome, has two speeds and a cooling option.  Terrific value for the money.</li>
    <li> This dryer is super noisy, even for a hair blow-dryer. The cord-keeper function has stopped working after only one week. Also there are limited drying functions on the unit. Do not waste your money.</li>
    <li> I liked the feel of it in my hand, but it was incredibly loud.  I thought I should wear hearing protection while I used it.  I couldn&#x27;t take it.  Also, the retractable cord worked only part of the time.  I returned it and bought a Remington.  I would definitely not recommend the Conair Cord-Keeper to a friend.</li>
    <li> I bought this from Duane Reade over 4 years ago. I loved the compact design, it was perfect for my tiny apartment and the cold shot worked well. It served me well for over 4 years before the GFCI plug crapped out. A replacement plug head was more expensive than the dryer and would have required some soldering or wire splicing or something, so I gave up on it.</li>
    <li> This hair dryer is great. I especially love the cord keeper feature. Very good product. I would recommend this product to anyone.</li>
    <li> If you are buying this hair dryer because of the retractability of the cord...don&#x27;t!  It worked for a few days then refused to completely retract.  So disappointing as I have a very small bathroom and spacesaving is a priority.  I don&#x27;t think I will buy Conair products again.</li>
    <li> I went with this model, because my old Conair worked wonderfully. The first time out of the box with this product, the air coming out felt warm at best. The low setting wasn&#x27;t strong enough, and the high setting felt like too much. I assumed it was fluke, and wanted to try the dryer again before deciding if i should take it back. The air was still on the cooler end of warm, but worked well enough considering. When I went to put it away after deciding I may keep it, the button for the retractable cord stopped working. After the second use! Not worth the money, even for a cheaper model.</li>
    <li> I wanted a hair dryer that was compact, the handle had to fold and the cord had to retract. THIS one had it all. Powerful and pretty color.</li>
    <li> The dryer does a fine job with choices between a hot and cool setting.  I especially like the retractable cord, which makes it easy to store.</li>
    <li> I bought this Conair dryer about 18 months ago.  I came on Amazon today to specifically leave a comment somewhere about this dryer.&lt;br /&gt;I was standing in front of the sink in the bathroom when suddenly this dryer turned on by itself and started smoking heavily.  I quickly unplugged it and rushed it outside. I was not using it.  The switch was off and it was just sitting there on the shelf.  There is no doubt in my mind that it would&#x27;ve caught my house on fire.&lt;br /&gt;I bought a new hair dryer today (not a Conair), and I read the instructions:  \\&quot;unplug ALL APPLIANCES when not in use\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;So let this be a lesson not only about this hair dryer, but all appliances--we&#x27;re supposed to unplug them.  This certainly is no excuse for this Conair dryer for nearly burning down my house, but as for me, I will be unplugging all appliance when not in use.  This is also a good idea because that tiny bit of wattage adds up of all these little appliances and such when they are not being used.  So we will save ourselves from a fire AND help the environment.</li>
    <li> This product should be recalled. It caught fire! And is not the first comment stating that.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a very powerful hair dryer, which is fine, as I have a lot of hair.  It&#x27;s not too heavy and there are two settings for low heat and high heat.  However - the retractable cord stopped retracting within 30 days.  And the plug is very clunky - it&#x27;s something that would be needed in a hair salon, not necessarily your home.  But it was only $14.95 and if it lasts 5 years, I will be happy.  The one that it replaced was a Vidal Sassoon (remember him?) that I bought 15 years ago for about $12.00, so I way got my money&#x27;s worth out of that!</li>
    <li> This little hair dryer is great for travel since the cord retracts on its own and folds. Im on my second one since my husband managed to fry my other one that I had for 8 years. So this goes to show they do still make some long lasting products. I hope they keep making this for years to come.</li>
