    <li> This was totally beyond what I expected! I expected smaller, less bright...but it is bright and great size and very convenient with the suction cups to use or the pull out stand. I am a camper and sometimes the bathrooms have not enough light nor even a mirror. I have a tent trailer, which does not allow a lot of light for putting on makeup. Sometimes the campgrounds have no electric hookups, so this battery powered mirror is excellent! I love it!</li>
    <li> Great light. Happy with mirror size and suction stability so far.</li>
    <li> Fast shipment. Just what I was looking for.</li>
    <li> I did many hours of research on this type of product before purchasing.  I have had many magnigying mirrors that have always fallen short.  This one is near perfect!  I use the suction cups so I can stand at the mirror to apply makeup.  The lights are bright. The horizontal shape is great as you can see a lot of your face.  It fits perfectly in the little protective pouch and worked great in my carry on suitcase. I am a budget shopper and considered this a splurge.  I do not regret it! This is a really worthwhile product.</li>
    <li> small and very portable, great magnification and suction cups work great.  light is nice and bright.</li>
    <li> I wish this mirror was a little bit bigger,  but other than that I love this mirror!</li>

    <li> This is a great travel mirror and also very good for at home use.  The 10X magnification is just right.  I have tried 5X and 15X; the 5X isn&#x27;t powerful enough and the 15X is too much.  15X is great magnification but too much for normal makeup application.  The lighting is very bright.  The size is sufficient without being overly large for packing.  The stand and suction cups are good options for various travel situations where you might be standing or sitting to apply makeup.
