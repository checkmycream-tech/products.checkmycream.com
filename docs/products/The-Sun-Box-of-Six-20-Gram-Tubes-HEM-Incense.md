<ol>
      <li>They smell so good and just make you feel uplifted!!</li>
      <li>This incense is awesome!!  </li>
      <li>The best way to describe it for me would be a musky, citrus, mens calogne.</li>
      <li>B000MPRF56 Hanna-Barbera&#x27;s The Greatest Adventure Stories From the Bible:</li>
      <li>Hem Incense is very good.</li>
      <li>Mmmmmm smells good!</li>
      <li>For a medium-strength scent, this is a very nice choice.</li>
      <li>This is some of the BEST incense I have used in 45 years of incense use of all types.wish i could give it more than 5 stars</li>
      <li>it is pleasant tho,</li>
      <li>I ordered this thinking it would smell good because of some of the reviews I read.</li>
      <li>Incense is  good at air</li>
      <li>Hope this helps some of you out there thinking about buying because of the good reviews.</li>
      <li>It is a good deal, and I would order HEM incense again.</li>
      <li>Bright, warm, but not over powering.</li>
      <li>, I like them, its just not the warm spice smell I was expecting.</li>
      <li>if I LOVE this scent.</li>
      <li>This one and &amp;#34;The Moon&amp;#34; are two incense fragrances that she&#x27;s come to love.</li>
      <li>If you close the door and burn it in a smallish room, like an office (where I prefer to burn incense), the soap smell is overwhelming.</li>
      <li>In fact, most Indian Incenses smell the way they do because they are basically soaked in their scent.</li>
      <li>The Moon is much, much better.</li>
      <li>my favorite now.  </li>
      <li>I love the scent.....</li>
      <li>I love that the price was cheaper than any place I have purchased incense.</li>
      <li>Love this incense for my morning practice.  </li>
      <li>you will love them.  </li>
      <li>My top is Gonesh</li>
      <li>I say this as I have been burning for about 20 or so years, and had lost track of some of the ones I really enjoyed..</li>
      <li>Very possibly my favorite scents of all time.  </li>
      <li>I love the smell of this.</li>
      <li>I ordered it because I read a review saying its like a cinnemon spice sandlewood smell, and i love the smell of sandlewood</li>
      <li>and I love that one</li>
      <li>I am ranking them by strength of smell because Moon is very light and Forest is extremely strong...</li>
      <li>I would think twice because it really doesn&#x27;t smell good at all.</li>
      <li>This is by far one of my FAVORITE scents from the HEM incense sticks!!</li>
      <li>If you&#x27;re using incense for relaxation, this is waaaaay too strong.  </li>
      <li>not to strong.</li>
      <li>so much I am ordering more for sure soon.</li>
      <li>These incense get great reviews for a reason - they lack the irksome chemical smell of many other incense.  </li>
      <li>We like nag champa &amp; think this, &amp; Dragons Blood (same company) make for pleasant alternative/accessory (?) scents</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s musky, spicy, sweet all combined.  </li>
      <li>I also got super hit</li>
      <li>its worth a try</li>
      <li>The shipping was good and on time but other than that this product isn&#x27;t worth buying.</li>
      <li>if I remember the right ones, with what brand..</li>
      <li>The sun is one of my favorite incenses (protection and the moon on the same group)</li>
      <li>I feel happily calm energize after I use this, I think it resonates with me more than the other incenses.</li>
      <li>So its a nice size box with six little packs inside.</li>
      <li>in mind that this is a very perfume-y incense.</li>
      <li>the sticks burn really well.</li>
      <li>I expected a soft, warm scent.</li>
      <li>not in my top ten, have not reordered but I am trying different types now..</li>
      <li>It will fill your entire house with such a nice fragrance and you can smell it long after the stick has burned out, yet it is never overpowering.  </li>
      <li>Not sure whether this was an older product or it has been tampered with (ie exchanged for a different scent), because it does not smell anything like it&#x27;s normal warm, pleasing aroma....</li>
      <li>a very loud scent if that makes sense.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been buying this scent for years now because I love it and now my grandmother, who got me used to the smell of incense since she&#x27;d burn it when I was a small child, swears by it.</li>
      <li>Sun is the one that  I consider to be &amp;#34;in the middle&amp;#34; as far as the three scents go...</li>
      <li>They smell natural and leave a nice lingering scent behind.  </li>
      <li>It smells very perfumy and not very earthy, like sandlewood.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Not what I was expecting after reading the reviews. I expected a soft, warm scent. What I got was sticks that smelled like dishwashing liquid or foamy soap. This isn&#x27;t a TERRIBLE smell, it just isn&#x27;t what I was expecting. I like the smell of soap, but not for an hour, permeating several rooms. This does burn long and fills several rooms with scent. If you close the door and burn it in a smallish room, like an office (where I prefer to burn incense), the soap smell is overwhelming. I have to burn this in an open space to even stand it. The Moon is much, much better.</li>
    <li> Very possibly my favorite scents of all time.  Bright, warm, but not over powering.</li>
    <li> This is some of the BEST incense I have used in 45 years of incense use of all types.wish i could give it more than 5 stars</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been purchasing Sun incense for YEARS now, and this is the first time I&#x27;ve ever been disappointed in it. Not sure whether this was an older product or it has been tampered with (ie exchanged for a different scent), because it does not smell anything like it&#x27;s normal warm, pleasing aroma.... Even the box itself smells....\\&quot;off\\&quot;. I compared it to a pack I still had left and it does look the same, but it smells very different. I won&#x27;t be purchasing my Sun from here any more...:(</li>
    <li> I ordered this thinking it would smell good because of some of the reviews I read. I was totally wrong. I don&#x27;t know what the smell is but all I know is that it stinks so bad I am sending these back. The smell makes me sick to my stomach. The shipping was good and on time but other than that this product isn&#x27;t worth buying. I also got super hit and I love that one so much I am ordering more for sure soon. Hope this helps some of you out there thinking about buying because of the good reviews. I would think twice because it really doesn&#x27;t smell good at all.</li>
    <li> This incense is awesome!!  I love the scent.....it&#x27;s like something you would smell in a temple.  It&#x27;s musky, spicy, sweet all combined.  It will fill your entire house with such a nice fragrance and you can smell it long after the stick has burned out, yet it is never overpowering.  This is a must buy!!</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B000MPRF56 Hanna-Barbera&#x27;s The Greatest Adventure Stories From the Bible: The Creation]]&lt;br /&gt;Incense is used is Worship. Also. Incense is  good at air refreshing.&lt;br /&gt;This Hem Incense is very good.</li>
    <li> Like all incense the actual odor is a matter of personal taste. We like nag champa &amp; think this, &amp; Dragons Blood (same company) make for pleasant alternative/accessory (?) scents</li>
    <li> So its a nice size box with six little packs inside. It is a good deal, and I would order HEM incense again. Im just not sure if I LOVE this scent. I ordered it because I read a review saying its like a cinnemon spice sandlewood smell, and i love the smell of sandlewood so i thought id try these. I dont smell cinnemon spice in it at all. The best way to describe it for me would be a musky, citrus, mens calogne. It smells very perfumy and not very earthy, like sandlewood. I dont hate them though, I like them, its just not the warm spice smell I was expecting.</li>
    <li> Love this incense for my morning practice.  It is hard to find in my neighborhood.  I love that the price was cheaper than any place I have purchased incense.</li>
    <li> The sun is one of my favorite incenses (protection and the moon on the same group) I feel happily calm energize after I use this, I think it resonates with me more than the other incenses.</li>
    <li> Mmmmmm smells good! I&#x27;m allergic to a lot of scents but this is one I can handle.</li>
    <li> not in my top ten, have not reordered but I am trying different types now..it is pleasant tho, its worth a try</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been buying this scent for years now because I love it and now my grandmother, who got me used to the smell of incense since she&#x27;d burn it when I was a small child, swears by it. This one and &amp;#34;The Moon&amp;#34; are two incense fragrances that she&#x27;s come to love. It also lasts a long time in a pack like this, so that&#x27;s good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Keep in mind that this is a very perfume-y incense. In fact, most Indian Incenses smell the way they do because they are basically soaked in their scent. So it isn&#x27;t like a wood incense where the smell of oak or pine comes from the materials IN the incense and not a perfume.</li>
    <li> I purchased Sun, Moon and Forest all at the same time.  These incense get great reviews for a reason - they lack the irksome chemical smell of many other incense.  They smell natural and leave a nice lingering scent behind.  Sun is the one that  I consider to be &amp;#34;in the middle&amp;#34; as far as the three scents go... I am ranking them by strength of smell because Moon is very light and Forest is extremely strong... a very loud scent if that makes sense.  For a medium-strength scent, this is a very nice choice.</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re using incense for relaxation, this is waaaaay too strong.  Even burning it outside bothered my neighbors.  If you&#x27;re trying to mask the scent from a cat box, this may help.</li>
    <li> This scent smelled so chemicall-y and nasty I had to put it out. Not the HEM 16 inchers of old-scent is weak, stick burns fast. I&#x27;m done with this brand.</li>
    <li> This is by far one of my FAVORITE scents from the HEM incense sticks!! They smell so good and just make you feel uplifted!!</li>
    <li> my favorite now.  you will love them.  and the scent lasts a long time. . . . . . .</li>
    <li> I adore scents, smells etc , and have about 30 different stick incense , and different brands...My top is Gonesh , them second would be Satya , them HEM...I say this as I have been burning for about 20 or so years, and had lost track of some of the ones I really enjoyed.. So this has been a little frustrating trying to buy not knowing if I remember the right ones, with what brand..So far only 2 have been bad for me , they really choke me up..and to be square on this I&#x27;m burning this in a smaller area than some might , and had moved into a larger space , it did lessen but not enough to buy again...Will keep to Moon , and Chandan..~!~</li>
    <li> I love the smell of this. not to strong. the sticks burn really well.</li>
