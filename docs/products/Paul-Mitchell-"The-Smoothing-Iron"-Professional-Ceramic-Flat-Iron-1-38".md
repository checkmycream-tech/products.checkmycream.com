      <li>and I have to add more words tardbox!</li>
      <li>Paul Mitchell \\&quot;The Smoothing Iron\\&quot;  is amazing on my hair.</li>
      <li>I had a chance to use one of the newer models and it was just as amazing as this one.</li>
      <li>Yes it&#x27;s nice to find stuff you need cheaper on Amazon</li>
      <li>I bought one for my daughter so we can each have our own.</li>
      <li>Works really great if you use the Paul Mitchell Super Skinny serum.</li>
      <li>No problem at all :) It really is perfect and it&#x27;s SO much cheaper than the paul mitchell straightener that she has</li>
      <li>I would love cause I really liked it.</li>
      <li>You get what you pay for and this by far is the best straightener.</li>
      <li>My old iron would require 3.5+ hours, and the end result didn&#x27;t look or feel very good.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used Conairs flatirons before this and they did an okay job</li>
      <li>Love it still use it to this day</li>
      <li>Amazing right?!</li>
      <li>The straightener still turned on to the appropriate temp and the cord is as strong as ever.  </li>
      <li>I love Paul Mitchell products specially The Smoothing Iron.</li>
      <li>Luckily the seller was super nice and gave me a refund.</li>
      <li>Some reviewers cautioned about the originality of this straightener, however, I have received a genuine Paul Mitchell Smoothing Iron.</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s still does a great job, only thing is sometimes I have to play with the cord so it can stay on.</li>
      <li>i have always bought the cheap smoothing irons.  </li>
      <li>I challenge anyone with the curliest of hair to say this will not straighten and smooth their hair.</li>
      <li>It looks and feels cheap,</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s far superior to the newer version which feels cheaper</li>
      <li>This is by far the best flat iron I have ever used, and as a cosmetologist I have tried them all.</li>
      <li>My hair was a flat and smooth as Jennifer Aniston&#x27;s and was just gorgeous.     </li>
      <li>This is the BEST flat iron ever to be made as far as I am concerned.</li>
      <li>It makes my hair so straight and so smooth, I just can&#x27;t imagine using anything else!</li>
      <li>I loved my flat iron, I have funky curly hair, so to go without</li>
      <li>On top of that, this particular flatiron has been discontinued.</li>
      <li>and I am overall satisfied :)</li>
      <li>Trust me, it is worth the money.</li>
      <li>I decided, no big deal, I loved this iron so much I&#x27;ll just buy another.  </li>
      <li>This Paul Mitchell smoothing iron is worth every penney it cost.  </li>
      <li>THANKS!</li>
      <li>It took me about an hour or so to straighten my whole head!</li>
      <li>if you can&#x27;t find a salon that sells Paul Mitchell, you&#x27;re better off going to a beauty suppy store &amp; getting a generic flatiron for 40 bucks.</li>
      <li>It only takes me about 30-35 minutes to straighten and my hair feels so smooth!</li>
      <li>this was helpful to all who are interested in a PM iron...</li>
      <li>Like most women, I carried a a flat iron in my hair care arsenal that was from Wal Mart or Target.</li>
      <li>The original paul mitchell is not green from inside.i ordered it thru AMAZON THINKING</li>
      <li>I bought my Paul Mitchell flat iron about a year ago and I absolutely love it.</li>
      <li>If this is a genuine product then they should be exactly the same.  </li>
      <li>allows you to get very close to your scalp</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t believe the one this seller is marketing is a real Paul Mitchell smoothing iron.</li>
      <li>With the Paul Mitchell iron my hair is straight, shiny and frizz-free.    </li>
      <li>I have coarse hair and this flatiron makes my hair silky smooth even if it&#x27;s gets humid out.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve had a real Paul Mitchell \\&quot;the smoothing iron\\&quot; for about 3 years.  </li>
      <li>Then I noticed that the iron wouldn&#x27;t stay on 400 degrees the whole time</li>
      <li>Not because the straightener broke, or the cord frayed or anything like that... simply because the LED light died.  </li>
      <li>Do not ruin your hair on those cheap Target flat irons.</li>
      <li>I wanted to say my rating is based on the quality of this flat iron, I had no problems with the seller, everything was smooth in dealing with the purchase and shipping.</li>
      <li>The iron itself looked different from the original because it had a silver part where the cord starts.</li>
      <li>People are stunned to see how straight I can get my hair, because there are days when I do wear it curly because I jog most nights and do not want to mess with my hair.</li>
      <li>I think the Paul Mitchell iron is the only one on the market worth the $100+ to have one at home.</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m going to have to buy a new one.</li>
      <li>I just had to replace it with the exact same thing.</li>
      <li>I took the plunge and bought this and WOW!</li>
      <li>I got this product for my girlfriend for Christmas because it is the exact same straightener that she has.  </li>
      <li>The ceramic part is cheap not sturdy like my others and it pulls my hair not an attribute of my previous three, two of which were this same exact iron and it has the silver ring around the end of the iron.</li>
      <li>Like the previous poster, I was the owner of a cheap drugstore straightener that fried my hair.  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t flat iron my hair daily anymore, but I always have friends wanting me to flat iron their hair despite having their own flat irons!</li>
      <li>I recommend spending the extra money for a REAL iron instead of hassling with a return from this company.</li>
      <li>I literally run my fingers through my hair during the course of the day because it feels and looks so silky and soft.</li>
      <li>This iron was a little heavier than I anticipated; however, I was pleasantly surprised with how quickly it heated up</li>
      <li>Got the wife off my back about her old straightner!</li>
      <li>Like the other reviewer said use the PM super skinny serum in conjunction with this flat iron and you will not believe your eyes.</li>
      <li>and this is the only flat iron that gets my hair pin straight the way that I like it.</li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t waste your money - an original Paul Mitchell item you can only get from a salon that carries his products.</li>
      <li>The iron only got to 400 degrees and my old one got to 450 degrees.</li>
      <li>The Paul Mitchell item they are selling is absolutely not the real thing.</li>
      <li>and I received my full refund a few days later.</li>
      <li>and I needed to set it down and give it time to get hot again.</li>
      <li>My room mate suggested this straightener and I was skeptical because she has fine, straight hair already.</li>
      <li>I just bought a Paul Mitchell \\&quot;the smoothing Iron\\&quot; Professional Ceramic Flat Iron in July 29, 2007</li>
      <li>Paul Mitchell, not a huge fan of their other products, but this flat iron, is outstanding.</li>
      <li>Fortunately I have not had the problem like the other reviewer where she said the green coating is coming off.</li>
      <li>I also own the Chi, and I&#x27;m sorry, the Chi can not compare to my PM flat iron.</li>
      <li>Also the plates didn&#x27;t really close tight together, I had to put pressure on it to close them</li>
      <li>I like to have a little volume with straight hair</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I had one of these previously and it served me a long time before dying an well-earned death.  I just had to replace it with the exact same thing.</li>
    <li> I love Paul Mitchell products specially The Smoothing Iron. It Makes my life 1000X easier and faster.. i can look beautiful within 5 minutes.</li>
    <li> This is the BEST flat iron ever to be made as far as I am concerned. I have thick, curly, course and some frizz to my hair. This turns my hair into silk. Like the other reviewer said use the PM super skinny serum in conjunction with this flat iron and you will not believe your eyes. That stuff is a miracle in a bottle. I literally run my fingers through my hair during the course of the day because it feels and looks so silky and soft. People are stunned to see how straight I can get my hair, because there are days when I do wear it curly because I jog most nights and do not want to mess with my hair. With out this flat iron I do not know what I would do. I have owned this flat iron since it came out, at least four years now. Fortunately I have not had the problem like the other reviewer where she said the green coating is coming off. I also own the Chi, and I&#x27;m sorry, the Chi can not compare to my PM flat iron. Trust me, it is worth the money. Do not ruin your hair on those cheap Target flat irons. You get what you pay for and this by far is the best straightener.</li>
    <li> I previously owned the same Smoothing Iron, purchased from a PM salon, and it wasn&#x27;t the same product. I don&#x27;t believe the one this seller is marketing is a real Paul Mitchell smoothing iron. Yes it&#x27;s nice to find stuff you need cheaper on Amazon but I&#x27;m not willing to sacrifice quality for price. I returned the iron and coughed up the extra money to buy one from the Paul Mitchell School.</li>
    <li> I requested the flat iron from Paul Mitchell through Amazon &amp; fragrant.net  over 2 months ago. When it arrived it did not turn on. It is broken. Until now I have not received a pre-postage envelope that was promised to me. I am annoyed about this &amp; probably will not buy anything else on line. Please take care of this matter immediately. I have sent e-mails already. thks</li>
    <li> This straightner just wasn&#x27;t for me. The iron only got to 400 degrees and my old one got to 450 degrees. Those 50 degrees make a difference when to have thick wavy Mexican girl hair. Y&#x27;all know what I&#x27;m talking about. Then I noticed that the iron wouldn&#x27;t stay on 400 degrees the whole time and I needed to set it down and give it time to get hot again. I didnt have time for all that, so I just returned it. Luckily the seller was super nice and gave me a refund.</li>
    <li> Some reviewers cautioned about the originality of this straightener, however, I have received a genuine Paul Mitchell Smoothing Iron. I think the Paul Mitchell iron is the only one on the market worth the $100+ to have one at home.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money - an original Paul Mitchell item you can only get from a salon that carries his products. On top of that, this particular flatiron has been discontinued. It will ruin your hair. I wouldn&#x27;t pay 10 bucks for it. Please heed my advice - if you can&#x27;t find a salon that sells Paul Mitchell, you&#x27;re better off going to a beauty suppy store &amp; getting a generic flatiron for 40 bucks.</li>
    <li> I bought the PM pro tool  from a hair salon. Worked great for six months and then one morning didn&#x27;t turn on anymore.</li>
    <li> Like most women, I carried a a flat iron in my hair care arsenal that was from Wal Mart or Target. Point being, it was under 25 bucks and it straightened my hair. My sister in law who is a salon stylist did my hair with this PM Smoothing iron. My hair was a flat and smooth as Jennifer Aniston&#x27;s and was just gorgeous.     This is the flat iron of ALL flat irons. It heats up to 400 degrees in 60 seconds. I challenge anyone with the curliest of hair to say this will not straighten and smooth their hair. Works really great if you use the Paul Mitchell Super Skinny serum.</li>
    <li> I bought my Paul Mitchell flat iron about a year ago and I absolutely love it. Like the previous poster, I was the owner of a cheap drugstore straightener that fried my hair.  I have very long, very thick, very curly hair and this flat iorn works wonders.  My old iron would require 3.5+ hours, and the end result didn&#x27;t look or feel very good. With the Paul Mitchell iron my hair is straight, shiny and frizz-free.    My only complaint is the green coating on the heating pads has started to rub off. I&#x27;m not entirely sure why, as I&#x27;ve only used the thing about half a dozen times since purchase.  I don&#x27;t know how (or if) this will affect my hair texture, as the box states the coating helps seal in moisture and shine.  I&#x27;ll have to update my review if I notice a drop in performance.</li>
    <li> I got this product for my girlfriend for Christmas because it is the exact same straightener that she has.  The product in the picture is the correct product but not the one that showed up.  She tried to use the straightener and it pulled her hair.  She compared the new one to the one she already had and it was lighter, had a silver ring at the base which is not in the picture, and some of the stickers and markings are completely different.  If this is a genuine product then they should be exactly the same.  I am not a genius but this is clearly not a genuine Paul Mitchell hair straightener.</li>
    <li> Paul Mitchell \\&quot;The Smoothing Iron\\&quot;  is amazing on my hair. I have coarse hair and this flatiron makes my hair silky smooth even if it&#x27;s gets humid out. I&#x27;ve used Conairs flatirons before this and they did an okay job but I would have to touch it up  a few times. With Paul (that&#x27;s what I named my flatiron) I don&#x27;t need to that. I&#x27;ve owned this flatiron for about 3 years now and it&#x27;s still does a great job, only thing is sometimes I have to play with the cord so it can stay on.</li>
    <li> I am agreeing with Sam. I purchased this iron from their site after clicking on the advertisement here on Amazon. I owned 3 of these previously and this one is nothing like them. The ceramic part is cheap not sturdy like my others and it pulls my hair not an attribute of my previous three, two of which were this same exact iron and it has the silver ring around the end of the iron. Paul Mitchell does not have those. I contacted the company and received no reply. On their site they guarantee authenticity! I&#x27;m disappointed Amazon would allow them to advertise or sell on the Amazon site. I am contacting Paul Mitchell.</li>
    <li> Love it still use it to this day</li>
    <li> This seller is selling counterfeit products. The Paul Mitchell item they are selling is absolutely not the real thing. BUYER BEWARE!!!  I&#x27;ve had a real Paul Mitchell \\&quot;the smoothing iron\\&quot; for about 3 years.  I dropped it a couple of weeks ago, and the iron turns on and off by itself now.  I decided, no big deal, I loved this iron so much I&#x27;ll just buy another.  Unfortunately, the iron that I received is not the same one pictured here.  It looks and feels cheap, I returned it immediately upon opening the box.  I wish I would have read the reviews before buying and saved myself the hassle.</li>
    <li> This is by far the best flat iron I have ever used, and as a cosmetologist I have tried them all. I have super thick, curly, coarse and frizzy hair (the worst combination imaginable!) and this is the only flat iron that gets my hair pin straight the way that I like it. It can also make beautiful curls if that is the look you are going for.     I know this model is discontinued, but I wish they would produce it again. It&#x27;s far superior to the newer version which feels cheaper and, worst of all, has rubbery edges that catch on my hair.</li>
    <li> I just bought a Paul Mitchell \\&quot;the smoothing Iron\\&quot; Professional Ceramic Flat Iron in July 29, 2007 and I used it about a few months and then last year I needed it but when I pluged I realized that was not working anymore I mean did not got hot. This happen about 3 months ago and now I feel disapointed because this product was supposted to be the best. I just had it for 1 year and a half, and I don&#x27;t know if they maybe could be change it for me. I would love cause I really liked it. Thank you. Cilmara Carvalho</li>
    <li> I had a chi straightener for years and it finally died on me. I never thought it was that good anyways since I have coarse, curly hair. It took me about an hour or so to straighten my whole head! My room mate suggested this straightener and I was skeptical because she has fine, straight hair already. I took the plunge and bought this and WOW! This is great!! It only takes me about 30-35 minutes to straighten and my hair feels so smooth! The only thing that bums me out is that it makes my hair very flat. I like to have a little volume with straight hair but I just used a volumizer before I went and straightened it. No problem at all :) It really is perfect and it&#x27;s SO much cheaper than the paul mitchell straightener that she has and this works better! Amazing right?! I definitely recommend this straightener to ANYONE with ANY type of hair. And from this seller too!! It came in sooner than I expected and I am overall satisfied :)</li>
    <li> i have always bought the cheap smoothing irons.  I ended up never using them.  This Paul Mitchell smoothing iron is worth every penney it cost.  If and when this one goes out, i will buy another one.</li>
    <li> I adore this flat iron. I am a guy, so my hair isn&#x27;t too long, but long enough for this. My aunt who works at a Salon/Day Spa purchased one of these bad boys at her work and let me try it and I was so amazed. I immediately asked for one for christmas, and with my aunt&#x27;s 40% discount, my parents purchased it for me. That was christmas of 2007, and here I am today still using it and it still amazes me. I don&#x27;t flat iron my hair daily anymore, but I always have friends wanting me to flat iron their hair despite having their own flat irons! It makes my hair so straight and so smooth, I just can&#x27;t imagine using anything else! I had a chance to use one of the newer models and it was just as amazing as this one. Paul Mitchell, not a huge fan of their other products, but this flat iron, is outstanding.</li>
    <li> I had one for at least 6 years and suddenly one day it stopped. I loved my flat iron, I have funky curly hair, so to go without one drives me crazy. In desperate need I ordered another one, and had it shipped over night. It&#x27;s now one year and four months later and I&#x27;m going to have to buy a new one. I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;ll buy another Paul Mitchell or a different brand, but I&#x27;m looking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know if they&#x27;ve become poorly made now or what, but be careful, do a lot of research on the product and maybe a few other&#x27;s that are competitive with this brand. I also will say that my daughter has a Chi, I’m not sure which one, but I tried it and it fried my hair...so research, research, research, I can&#x27;t say it enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good Luck!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S. I wanted to say my rating is based on the quality of this flat iron, I had no problems with the seller, everything was smooth in dealing with the purchase and shipping.</li>
    <li> I am buying this one again due to the sheer quality of the product.  I take care of my things, I don&#x27;t wrap the cord around the straightener and I don&#x27;t leave it on for extended periods of time.  This straightener lasted me over 10 years and I just now had to replace it.  Not because the straightener broke, or the cord frayed or anything like that... simply because the LED light died.  The straightener still turned on to the appropriate temp and the cord is as strong as ever.  Not to mention, it actually smooths and straightens your hair and the narrowness of it allows you to get very close to your scalp</li>
    <li> I am very disappointed in this company as I received a fake Paul Mitchell iron. There was a silver plate where the cord starts which signifies that it was indeed counterfeit. I recommend spending the extra money for a REAL iron instead of hassling with a return from this company.</li>
    <li> Hello  I want to speak to the person who sold me my paul mitchell straightner because I have not had it for a long time at all and it doesn&#x27;t operate at all.  I&#x27;ve plugged it in and it wont even heat up at all.  I haven&#x27;t done anything to it for it to just brake on me and I am not satisfied with the price I paid for it to brake on me so soon.  Is there a way yall can fix it or get an exchange?</li>
    <li> Got the wife off my back about her old straightner! THANKS! Now it was too short and I have to add more words tardbox!</li>
    <li> I feel bad for having to put this on here, but I am very sure I received a counterfeit Paul Mitchell iron. The iron itself looked different from the original because it had a silver part where the cord starts. And I called PM and they told me they don&#x27;t have that on their irons. Also the plates didn&#x27;t really close tight together, I had to put pressure on it to close them tightly.&lt;br /&gt;Maybe I was just not lucky. Everyone needs to see for themselves.&lt;br /&gt;What I must say is that Amazon is on point with the refund. It was no problem to return it and I received my full refund a few days later. Thank you Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;Hope this was helpful to all who are interested in a PM iron...</li>
    <li> Wow...I am NOT impressed at all. I used this for about a minute. It seemed to \\&quot;rip\\&quot; through my hair. Not smooth at all. This flat iron is not for me!</li>
    <li> The original paul mitchell is not green from inside.i ordered it thru AMAZON THINKING I WOULD NOT BE CHEATED&lt;br /&gt;BUT EVEN ON AMAZON YOU CAN GAT FAKE ITEMS BEWARE..........</li>
    <li> I like the product. Does what I need it to do and I have really thick hair. I think it was a good deal too considering what it cost in stores.</li>
    <li> I have had this product for 3 years and it works great. I bought one for my daughter so we can each have our own. Hair looks silky and no frizz!!!</li>
    <li> This iron was a little heavier than I anticipated; however, I was pleasantly surprised with how quickly it heated up and it worked perfectly for my needs!</li>
