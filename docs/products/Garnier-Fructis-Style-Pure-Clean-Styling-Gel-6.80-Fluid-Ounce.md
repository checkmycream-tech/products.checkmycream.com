      <li>I&#x27;ve used many Garnier Fructis products and have been happy with all but this astoundingly misrepresented product.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m in love with it!</li>
      <li>This hair gel is amazing.  </li>
      <li>This product does a good job of keeping my hair in place and not flaking like most gels do, even after all day.</li>
      <li>Love the scent, good price</li>
      <li>I never had any problems before with this product and liked it.</li>
      <li>The best thing about this gel is that it isn&#x27;t drying AT ALL, which is really great for daily use on longer hair.</li>
      <li>Nice shine.</li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t rub in, stays kind of gooey.</li>
      <li>They discontinued the gel I liked</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a fantastic product that is actually good for your hair.</li>
      <li>This gel smells good and works pretty good.</li>
      <li>I have stick straight, fine hair, and this product gives it a great lift!</li>
      <li>I have tried so many products,and this is the best so far for enhancing curl and providing hold</li>
      <li>None were able to control the frizziness of my hair.</li>
      <li>I love Fructis products.</li>
      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>I love Garniers products</li>
      <li>They love this gel.</li>
      <li>my husband&#x27;s hair looks great, thanks to this stuff.</li>
      <li>can&#x27;t find the product in the stores any more</li>
      <li>The Curl Scrunch works better, no flaking.</li>
      <li>Love it.</li>
      <li>Keeps me looking like macklemore. :)</li>
      <li>but my hair absorbs moisture much more than his.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>This way it works in defining the curls and holding the shape better than just using leave-in and oil alone.</li>
      <li>I rubbed the gel between my palms as I would with any gel, and then made sure to distribute it evenly throughout my damp hair, then combed it through again.</li>
      <li>The more I tried to flick it out the more it flaked.</li>
      <li>I like it :)</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been able to use just this product to bring out my waves.  </li>
      <li>I LOVE Garnier Triple Nutrition shampoo...</li>
      <li>I truly love this product, I  have 9 tubes  </li>
      <li>I can add more gel at this point if it needs it.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m so glad that I tried it out.</li>
      <li>What more could you want?</li>
      <li>This is a great hair gel at a very low price, it is great for working out and keeping your hair out of your eyes and does not wear off during a full day of activity.</li>
      <li>It has a nice, neat, clean hold (no goop nonsense).</li>
      <li>stuff is awesome for creating and defining waves in long hair.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Now throughout the day it would dry and it held perfectly.</li>
      <li>I have naturally curly hair and this gel works great.</li>
      <li>A great natural product that protects hair and gives both hold and volume.</li>
      <li>This gel works great for naturally curly wash-n-gos.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very slippery, those of us wavy/curly girls know how helpful a product with a good slip can be.  </li>
      <li>Easy shipping</li>
      <li>The hold is strong, but washes out easily and does not leave flaky residue in hair.</li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t flake strong hold</li>
      <li>It is hands down the best gel I have ever used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>It lays my edges down perfectly.  </li>
      <li>My usual gel (Pantene) worked perfectly, but I thought it would be better to try something without silicones or parabens.</li>
      <li>The gel shipped quickly and arrived safe and sound.</li>
      <li>If you have straight hair or fine hair, I cannot say how it will work for you, but otherwise, you can stop your search for soft-control, frizz reducing, nice shine, non-greasy hair gel.</li>
      <li>Thank God I didn&#x27;t have anything important going on after work that day except to run to walmart for groceries.  </li>
      <li>Provides a light hold, no residue (visible or to the touch).</li>
      <li>Great 2nd day hair too!  </li>
      <li>Curls are bouncy, shiny and frizz free all day.  </li>
      <li>Cheap, and works.</li>
      <li>more thing: I used to use the Mega gel by Tresemme, which I loved because it worked for 2nd day hair in this way, but the stuff made my skin break out along my hair line.</li>
      <li>These products are inexpensive enough to try the whole line to find what works best for your hair.</li>
      <li>Great for keeping the hair out of my eyes while remaining animal cruelty free and helping keep my hair from getting dry.</li>
      <li>probably wouldn&#x27;t use this on super short hair that requires a really strong, rock-hard hold, because this &#x27;strong&#x27; hold is softer and more flexible, better suited to longer hair and people who want a style with some movement.</li>
      <li>The texture of this gel is really cool.</li>
      <li>About to throw it away and go back to her good brand.</li>
      <li>The fact that it is mostly naturally derived is a great bonus and keeps me coming back because it works as well or better than the non-natural ones.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Is somewhat natural. Stays put. Doesn&#x27;t flake strong hold</li>
    <li> leaves white residue but has a good hold for flexirod sets</li>
    <li> I only use a small amount, yet my hair is plastered together and either crusty or sticky.  It does not leave white residue like I&#x27;ve had with other products, so the crustiness isn&#x27;t as noticeable to others, but I can certainly feel it.  I do not recommend this product.</li>
    <li> works great!! gonna get another one</li>
    <li> Keeps me looking like macklemore. :)</li>
    <li> They discontinued the gel I liked so I tried this one. I was very disapponted. Not anywhere close to the quality I expect from Garnier.</li>
    <li> I have not reviewed a product in years but I wanted to review this Gel. I stopped using gel for years because it was unhealthy for my hair.  I am african american with natural hair.  My hair loves this gel. It feels so moisturize when I use it. It lays my edges down perfectly.  My waves are perfect.  This gel is a keeper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Valerie</li>
    <li> I first read about this on the Curl Talk forum, where quite a few folks raved about it.  If you&#x27;re following the Curly Girl method (no sulfates or silicones), it&#x27;s CG-friendly.  I&#x27;ve been able to use just this product to bring out my waves.  I apply it on soaking wet hair, first by raking through small amounts and then scrunching my hair to encourage the curl. Then I squeeze out the water with a microfiber towel.  It does dry hard, but you can gently scrunch out the crunch.  So far, I haven&#x27;t had any problems with flaking as other reviewers have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has a pretty strong lemon scent, but that dissipated pretty quickly once your hair dries.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this is a great product at a great price!  I&#x27;m so glad that I tried it out.</li>
    <li> i don&#x27;t have to curl my hair,  just put on the gel, scrunch it, let it dry, and I&#x27;ve got a good &amp;#34;do&amp;#34;.....</li>
    <li> Not very strong at all, I have thick hair and this really doesn&#x27;t do the trick whatsoever. I suppose it would do well if you had thin, short hair.</li>
    <li> This is the best hair gel I have ever tried.  Both my husband and I use this daily.  It has a light fragrance and completely washes off your hands.  The hold is strong, but washes out easily and does not leave flaky residue in hair.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t normally write negative reviews, and I normally like Garnier Fructis products, but this product is just plain terrible. First off, it says \\&quot;super clean\\&quot; and non flaky, but I found it to be the opposite. The hold is waaay too strong and stiff, and it flakes anywhere you touch it as if it iced up your hair and will break in places you touch it, thus resulting in flakes. It&#x27;s neither \\&quot;clean\\&quot; nor \\&quot;pure.\\&quot; I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s the earth-friendly bio degradable products, but this product is not recommended.</li>
    <li> This a great product. I love it. I use it on my straight asian hair with a comb. It&#x27;s the only thing that will keep my hair from popping out. However....it does attract bugs (like wasps) in the summer. Maybe because of the acacia...?</li>
    <li> Cheap, and works. No brainer.</li>
    <li> I have naturally curly hair and this gel works great. It doesn&#x27;t leave my hair &amp;#34;crunchy&amp;#34; but soft and defined. Plus it&#x27;s mostly NATURAL.</li>
    <li> This product does a good job of keeping my hair in place and not flaking like most gels do, even after all day.</li>
    <li> This is one of the best gels I have ever used!  Hands down will be purchasing again.  Did not dry my hair or create frizz.  It&#x27;s very slippery, those of us wavy/curly girls know how helpful a product with a good slip can be.  A little goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amazing Product worth every star.</li>
    <li> works really well when blow drying</li>
    <li> I have had allergic reactions to most hair care products I&#x27;ve used in the past but have no trouble with this, which is great!  It is a bit heavier than I&#x27;d like, and if you put too much in one part of your hair, your hair dries looking dirty, which is annoying (no amount of brushing resolve this for me).  Still, the fact that there&#x27;s no strong smell and I&#x27;ve never had a reaction to it persuade me to overlook other flaws.</li>
    <li> This holds without being too stiff.  Very nice.</li>
    <li> I have curly hair and live in humid Southern Florida. My days of frizz are over thanks to this gel!  The texture is a little slimy (similar to home-made flax seed gel), but it goes on smoothly.  Curls are bouncy, shiny and frizz free all day.  Great 2nd day hair too!  Awesome product. Highly recommended to add volume, promote curls and eliminate frizz.</li>
    <li> This gel works great for naturally curly wash-n-gos.</li>
    <li> Wife got it for me because my old gel would flake and gross her out.&lt;br /&gt;Not a flake,even after I got sleep with it in.</li>
    <li> Great for keeping the hair out of my eyes while remaining animal cruelty free and helping keep my hair from getting dry.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m shocked that this product has gotten any negative reviews... I&#x27;m in love with it! I rarely write reviews but I really don&#x27;t want this product to be discontinued, I don&#x27;t know what I would do without it! It is hands down the best gel I have ever used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can only imagine the people who experienced flakiness used way, way too much gel. I have never experienced any flakiness whatsoever. This is the only gel I&#x27;ve ever used that can provide pretty strong hold if applied and allowed to dry, but can also give your hair soft, touchable hold if allowed to dry and then fingercombed or scrunched a bit. Again, I can&#x27;t stress enough that I&#x27;ve never had any problems with flaking or crunchiness, even after combing out my hair after use. I&#x27;ve never used any other gel that I could say that about.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff is awesome for creating and defining waves in long hair. A small amount is all you need. The best thing about this gel is that it isn&#x27;t drying AT ALL, which is really great for daily use on longer hair. I really can&#x27;t say enough good things about it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I probably wouldn&#x27;t use this on super short hair that requires a really strong, rock-hard hold, because this &#x27;strong&#x27; hold is softer and more flexible, better suited to longer hair and people who want a style with some movement.</li>
    <li> I LOVE Garnier Triple Nutrition shampoo...so I just assumed that the styling products were just as awesome.  I put this in my hair after showering and immediately it was like glue.  I could barely move my hands through my hair and work the product to the ends.  I was getting ready for work...running late...no time to wash it out.... so I went with it hoping that once it dried it would somehow miraculously work for me.  Once it air dryed I could barely get even a pic through my hair to separate and &amp;#34;comb&amp;#34; my hair out.  BTW...I&#x27;m white with fine hair but do use a pic only on my hair to avoid damage because it is so fine.  Then throughout the day my hair got increasingly dryer and dryer and then my hair began to expand in the humidity.  Then my head began to itch.  The WORST gel I have ever used.  At lunchtime during work that very day I brought it back to Walgreens and returned it.  I refused to even pay for this product and the bad day of hair it gave me.  Thank God I didn&#x27;t have anything important going on after work that day except to run to walmart for groceries.  And well...it&#x27;s walmart so I doubt my frizzy, dry, glue infused hair bothered anyone.</li>
    <li> I have long, frizzy,wavy out of control hair. I usually use a light gel and spray to keep my hair from looking like cotton candy. First time I used this gel I used a normal quarter sized dollop, applied to wet hair and styled as usual. Within a few hours I had hard curls, I spent time pulling the curls apart and there was no white residue. The next day I used 1/2 the amount and put it in my hair with a light touch and it was great! my hair is not going super hard and I did not get crazy frizz. The texture of this gel is really cool. It is like loose jell-o, it spreads easy in my hand. Over all I really like this gel and it is going to last a long time since a small amount does what a large glob of frizz-gel does. I like it :)</li>
    <li> I am male, with fine, straight hair, probably 2 - 3 inches long.  I want something to keep my hair in place without seeming glued down.  I found this product to be great.  I don&#x27;t need to use very much to achieve the effect I&#x27;m after; perhaps a dollop the size of a pea.  No flaking for me but I&#x27;ve neer had a styling gel, either cheap or more expensive, flake.  Maybe because I use so little.</li>
    <li> Not very good hair gel. Doesn&#x27;t rub in, stays kind of gooey.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m growing my bangs out, which is probably the most annoying thing you could do to yourself.  I was looking for a gel that would hold them in place instead of swooping over my eyes and blinding/bugging me.  This gel is great and holds really nicely.  It also smells fresh/clean and if you change your mind mid-day, brushing it out and re-styling will not cause flaking!</li>
    <li> Great product, works good on my curls. Was exactly as described. My only complaint is that it was had a leak.</li>
    <li> I love Fructis products. It is clear and keeps its hold. No hair spray is needed for my curls to stay curly. Try it, you will like it.</li>
    <li> If you have very thick, very curly hair, this is WOW. I have generally given up on gels as they all contain high levels of silicone which does NOTHING to help control the frizz (to the contrary) and leaves a weird greasy feel.  If you have straight hair or fine hair, I cannot say how it will work for you, but otherwise, you can stop your search for soft-control, frizz reducing, nice shine, non-greasy hair gel.</li>
    <li> Thought this had a stronger hold. My daughter has very thick hair , and a lot of it. This gel works w hairspray for about an hour. Then it&#x27;s like nothing was ever in her hair.</li>
    <li> This gel smells good and works pretty good. I would buy it again</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Garnier gel for a long time.  Last time through the store I couldn&#x27;t find my usual so I tried this.  Terrible!  Leaves my hair sticky after blow drying.  Had to wash it out after a few hours because my head was itching.</li>
    <li> I have used this gel a few times, it has the same consistency as Kinky Curly Coiling Custard, or snot. It makes my curly hair a little hard and defined, but for my kinky hair, there is zero hold and it&#x27;s frizzy.</li>
    <li> I love Garniers products but this was a big disappointment. After it dried my hair was dry and dull. I didn&#x27;t like the feel and texture. It was a waste of $.</li>
    <li> I have wavy/curly hair, and have been looking for something to revive my curl in the very dry climate in which I live. This is an amazing gel! I have tried so many products,and this is the best so far for enhancing curl and providing hold--I need a lot of both.</li>
    <li> I used this product last night. I only used amount according to directions and could barely get a comb through my hair, gummy, sticky, felt like a hadn&#x27;t washed it in a week.  Do not buy, complete waste of money. I never tried other Garnier products and after this experience, I never will.</li>
    <li> I truly love this product, I  have 9 tubes  I gave 1 to my friend Donna  to try and she just loves the product too&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t find the product in the stores any more I  hope the Garnier Co. isn&#x27; t going to discontinue selling it.</li>
    <li> Am looking for a replacement for THE perfect styling gel that is no longer being sold. So having had the ideal product I am skeptical of any product, but one that used the word &#x27;clean&#x27; got my attention. Unfortunately one use and the product went into the trash. This was supposed to be a volumizing (sic) gel but the way it achieved this was by leaving a residue on my hair. This made it stiff, sticky and difficult to comb out. I do not blow dry my hair, but style with the gel, let it dry and comb out. Maybe blowing dry would make it work better, but it is definitely NOT the product for me.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used many Garnier Fructis products and have been happy with all but this astoundingly misrepresented product. It&#x27;s the least unobtrusive gel I&#x27;ve ever used. The first time I tried it, I came home and realized that I&#x27;d been out and about all day looking like a victim of the \\&quot;hair gel\\&quot; scene from \\&quot;There&#x27;s Something About Mary.\\&quot;    I rubbed the gel between my palms as I would with any gel, and then made sure to distribute it evenly throughout my damp hair, then combed it through again. When I looked in the mirror later in the day, I was appalled (though I couldn&#x27;t help laughing) to see wide swaths of opaque, glue-like residue in my hair. Even with a gel that doesn&#x27;t claim to have \\&quot;Zero Flaking\\&quot; and \\&quot;Zero Residue\\&quot; I would have been disgusted with the results. But considering that this product is represented as it is, I was stunned by the sticky, icky results. And just try running your fingers or a comb through your hair after this gel has dried! I&#x27;d probably get the same results with Elmer&#x27;s Liquid Glue. My usual gel (Pantene) worked perfectly, but I thought it would be better to try something without silicones or parabens. But this product is clearly (or not so clearly) not the way to go. When they say it contains acacia gum, they mean gum!</li>
    <li> This stuff lasts me a while and holds really well. You don&#x27;t need to use very much of it to work. Happy with the product.</li>
    <li> With most gels, my hair is a tangled mess in the morning, and impossible to get a brush through. With this stuff, I can wet my hair brush, and gently glide it through my hair, starting at the ends, until it&#x27;s all brushed and wet. I can add more gel at this point if it needs it. That is my easy and fast routine for 2nd and 3rd day hair that forms nice curls!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One more thing: I used to use the Mega gel by Tresemme, which I loved because it worked for 2nd day hair in this way, but the stuff made my skin break out along my hair line. I&#x27;ve been looking ever since, and most gels either make me break out, or just leave my hair a matted mess the next day. Finally I&#x27;ve found another gel, that doesn&#x27;t have the break-out causing ingredient!  (VP Copolymer seems to be the offending ingredient. And it&#x27;s not in this Garnier Gel, HOORAY!!!!)</li>
    <li> Very good styling, not sticky, smells good.</li>
    <li> Makes my curly hair stiff and crispy. Even when used with leave in conditioner. Not the gel for me. :(</li>
    <li> but it doesn&#x27;t smell very nice.  Maybe just the slightest hint of fragrance would be in order.  But it does work!</li>
    <li> I got this hair gel before even one bad hair day was encountered.  I use this get as a watered-down spritzer for my curly hair.  The gel shipped quickly and arrived safe and sound.</li>
    <li> Provides a light hold, no residue (visible or to the touch).</li>
    <li> A great natural product that protects hair and gives both hold and volume. It&#x27;s a little strange to use... Something between a Liquid and a gel,  or can cling and then release completely ,  like some alien goo. You can use it with or without water,  on wet or dry hair and get completely different results. Basically you  can do a lot with it if you are willing to learn the various ways to use it. Smells of mild citrus.  It Never flakes,  and as the day wears on the hair becomes softer as the gell relaxes. You can really get a firm plaster or natural volumizing effect. If doesn&#x27;t hold quite as long as the artificial gels,  but it protects and softens  my hair and keeps it from drying out. It&#x27;s a fantastic product that is actually good for your hair.</li>
    <li> The main issue I have with the product is the packing. Most people will put any type of fluids in a sealed or zip-locked bag before putting in a box with other items to ship. This product made my hair look oily and dirty rather than the &amp;#34;wet&amp;#34; look, but it did hold my hair and I have really dry curly hair that like to do it own thing.</li>
    <li> I use this daily on dry hair to get some body in my fine hair.</li>
    <li> Only need to use a small amount.</li>
    <li> My partner and I both use this gel. A little background info. We&#x27;re Puerto Rican so we live in high humidity. He has 3c curly hair that&#x27;s about shoulder length wet/ neck length dry. My curls are 3b (some closer to 3a mixed in) and about hip length wet / waist length dry. Not sure about porosity. I did the sink or float test on my hair and it floated which suggests I have low porosity but my hair absorbs moisture much more than his.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This gel works perfect for his hair. He loves that it almost has no scent. When you apply it there is a scent but once your hair is dry it dissipates so that he doesn&#x27;t have to walk around with girly smelling hair. It works great to set his curls. He the Pure Clean Conditioner as a leave-in, then this gel and the result is very defined curls with no frizz that dry soft to the touch instead of crunchy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The gel isn&#x27;t as great for my hair. I can&#x27;t use it alone to set my hair because it does not control frizz and I end up with poofy hair. The main ingredients here are sorbitol and glycerin. Both are humectants, which means they attract water (or in my case the moisture from the humid air). How I like to use this gel is first my leave-in conditioner, then seal with joboba oil, then apply the gel. This way it works in defining the curls and holding the shape better than just using leave-in and oil alone. Overall it works for me but I will continue looking for alternative products. I still give it 5 stars because it&#x27;s awesome for my partners hair and great value for the price.</li>
    <li> I use this everyday. Yes I&#x27;m a guy, but I am able to give this review from both perspectives of having long AND short hair since I recently cut my mid-back length hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;LONG HAIR:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair is VERY thick and VERY curly. Almost to the point of looking afro-like and frizzy. After my hair length reached a certain point I decided I needed some gel to control the mess that was growing on my head. I have tried various gels in the past. Including some from Garnier. None were able to control the frizziness of my hair. When I stumbled on this one I was immediately attracted to it because of the promise of a strong hold, its 98% naturally derived ingredients and its mild scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It delivered on every of those promises.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used this gel by simply towel drying my hair until its not dripping wet, yet still moderately damp. At this point my hair appears like an afro. It takes some time since there is so much hair, but I begin applying it through my hair using my fingers. &gt;(A good thing about this gel is that it feels like a gel, not like some soapy solution like I have used in other gels. So it doesn&#x27;t feel like I&#x27;m putting shampoo in my hair again.)&lt; After a couple minutes my hair appears like normal long curly hair. It brings out the curls beautifully although some frizziness will always be there just for the nature of my hair. I would then just tie it back with a scrunchie to hold it in place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now throughout the day it would dry and it held perfectly. No flakes, no residue and the hold looked more natural when I let my hair down. I do have to warn, that the first time I used it I applied way too much because I thought my hair wouldn&#x27;t stay down and it did feel like a helmet. Afterward, I lessened the amount applied obviously so that it didn&#x27;t feel/look that way. So try to use in moderation if you have long hair. My only complaint using this product with long hair was that even when using less of the product to avoid helmet hair; I was still using a lot of it each day just for the sheer length of my hair. The amount given in the bottle just wasn&#x27;t enough and wouldn&#x27;t even last me a full week. For longer hair there should definitely be a bigger bottle. However, for the job it does, I kept buying it. Since no other gel I knew of worked so well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SHORT HAIR:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After not wanting to deal with the longer bathroom times due to having long hair: Shampooing, Conditioner, brushing, drying, gelling etc. (I don&#x27;t know how most of you women do it everyday.) I decided to go back to having shorter hair. Now before I decided to go on this long hair adventure I had always had a buzz cut. Never had it longer. This time I wanted to have it moderately short; shorter than a crew cut. So I did that, but found my frizziness STILL there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t think I would need gel again with shorter hair, but I guess I was wrong. I turned back to this gel to see how it would do. Of course I had to use FAR less than what I was using. Just used a small amount about the size of a silver dollar and it was enough for the whole head. The way it dried was the same as it was with long hair. Natural looking. No flakes. No residue. Definitely a good gel for guys to use if you want to avoid looking like one of those gelled up cockatoo spike, douchebag hair styles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recap:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-This gel works as advertised: No residue, no flakes and natural looking.&lt;br /&gt;-Use it in moderation and you won&#x27;t have helmet hair and the aforementioned above dislikes.&lt;br /&gt;-NO GIRLY SCENT. There is a faint scent of lemon that isn&#x27;t overpowering and goes away once dried.&lt;br /&gt;-Strong hold even for my hair.&lt;br /&gt;-Feels like gel, not like a soapy shampoo solution.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disregard the negative reviews. They either used too much or have some other problems with their hair unrelated to this gel that led to a bad experience.</li>
    <li> Top notch item, this is a great everyday gel... especially for those with curly hair. This mixed with a light conditioner on wet hair is a LIFE SAVER for those with ethnic, naturally curly hair looking to wear their hair out and maintain curl structure. It has a nice, neat, clean hold (no goop nonsense). Holds well, doesn&#x27;t &amp;#34;over do it&amp;#34;, does not leave clumps everywhere... you can&#x27;t see it when it&#x27;s used throughout the hair and worked in. Love it.</li>
    <li> I like this stuff because it firmly holds my hair in place all day and I don&#x27;t see flakes until the next morning when I hop into the shower. I would suggest shopping around though. the last time i bought this was at a Duane Reed (like a CVS, or walgreens) for $3.30.</li>
    <li> Use this all the time for my curly hair.</li>
    <li> After years of different Gel - I am using this exclusively.  Does not make may hair into crispy chunks, goes on neat, stays unsticky after it drys and keeps control of my hair without over doing it.</li>
    <li> This is a great hair gel at a very low price, it is great for working out and keeping your hair out of your eyes and does not wear off during a full day of activity.</li>
    <li> While I think it&#x27;s cool that it&#x27;s a &amp;#34;green&amp;#34; product, I think it smells strange.  It sort of smells like play doh, which is not what I expected since Garnier Fructis usually smells so good.  At least it doesn&#x27;t flake!</li>
    <li> This product is awesome!  You can use it on wet or dry hair.  I have stick straight, fine hair, and this product gives it a great lift! I often let my hair air dry for an hour, then put this product in, and it&#x27;s ready to go!</li>
    <li> Came quick and was what I wanted.</li>
    <li> My stylist recommended that I use a styling gel to blow out my long, straight, Asian hair.  I used some of the expensive salon gels for awhile because I had memories of the crunchiness of drugstore versions from years past, but finally got tired of paying so much money for such little product.  I really like Garnier&#x27;s other products, particularly the scent, so I thought I&#x27;d give this a try and it&#x27;s been great.  I don&#x27;t need to use a lot and my hair feels really natural after blow drying, yet there is a nice hold so that it is manageable.  Great value!</li>
    <li> I used the gel once.  I put it on while my hair was wet and it became as hard as a rock.  I could not get a brush or comb through my hair and washed it out as soon as possible.</li>
    <li> I have used a couple of Garnier styling products in the past with great success.  Unfortunately, this product isn&#x27;t one of them.  After following directions to the letter I couldn&#x27;t get a comb through my hair and blowing it out with a styling brush was next to impossible. After all the pain of the blow out I at least expected decent hold considering the package touts &amp;#34;24HR Clean Hold&amp;#34;, but it neither held a style nor did my hair look clean. My hair looked like I hadn&#x27;t washed it in 3-4 days, meaning it was flat and greasy-looking immediately after styling. Before I could leave the house, I had to re-wash my hair and use a different styling product. I tried this product 4 times with similar results each time. After the last time I threw an almost full bottle in the trash.</li>
    <li> I never had any problems before with this product and liked it. Had been using another brand because the store didn&#x27;t have this one when I was there, and was happy with the substitute. Last time I went back to Fructis Style, and this tube, at any rate, is terrible. I have fine hair and it does have an unpleasant residue making my hair look not too clean. I keep using less and less to no avail. Still the same result. Will not buy it again.</li>
    <li> Best jell I ever used</li>
    <li> This is the only hair gel that my husband will use. It works great for his wavy hair. I ordered 6 bottles for him.</li>
    <li> Not too stiff like I like. Nice shine. Weird smell</li>
    <li> 98% Naturally Crappy... This stuff is lame. My wife saw it on-sale so she figure she&#x27;d give it a try... Disappoint. About to throw it away and go back to her good brand. Oh, it smells funky too.</li>
    <li> Product works great. Easy shipping</li>
    <li> Product was what I wanted and it was delivered on time</li>
    <li> Great Gel! Not sticky, doesn&#x27;t flake, natural look.  What else can you ask for?</li>
    <li> Love the scent, good price</li>
    <li> my husband&#x27;s hair looks great, thanks to this stuff.</li>
    <li> I have 3 boys in the house including my husband. They love this gel. It doesn&#x27;t flake when it dries up. To retouch,  all they do is wet back the hair and reshape.</li>
    <li> The gel works. Holds well, leaves no residue after shampooing out. You don&#x27;t need to use a lot either, which makes it go far. What more could you want? The fact that it is mostly naturally derived is a great bonus and keeps me coming back because it works as well or better than the non-natural ones.</li>
    <li> I used this gel on my natural 4C hair. It gave me great shine and popped my curls. However, the gel flaked really bad after it dried. The more I tried to flick it out the more it flaked. Won&#x27;t use it again. The Curl Scrunch works better, no flaking. My second day curls didn&#x27;t hold, hair was more fluffy curls less defined. Overall, I like this line of products for my natural hair over all the other expensive natural hair products that rarely work on 4C hair. These products are inexpensive enough to try the whole line to find what works best for your hair. They have great conditioners, a leave-in, and a Moroccan oil blend. All available on Amazon at great prices!  *Purchased this from a different supplier (Target).</li>
    <li> Very inexpensive. Great product. Smells great. I use this to take any extra frizz from a blow out.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for years - does not flake, is not shiny and it does not stiffen hair.</li>
    <li> This hair gel is amazing.  I have very curly/frizzy hair, and I recently discovered this gel, and it is great.  It takes away all of the frizz, leaves my hair with a great texture (a little bit crunchy, but not too crunchy), and it doesn&#x27;t leave any white flakes!  The biggest problem I&#x27;ve had with other gels is that it leaves little white flakes on my tops, but not this gel!</li>
    <li> I hate cheap gels, gels that say value size or just cheap as one dollar. Other gels either are crusty and leave residue; however this gel is not too crusty and does not leave residue. One issue I had was gels causing me to break out because of the additives and whatever. This gel being 98 percent from environmental products does not cause me breakouts or to have blemishes. It last all day long and does not have any annoying or fake smell. If they sold this by the gallon, I&#x27;d buy one. The price is pretty decent as well. $4 dollars last me a couple of months.</li>
    <li> I recently cut my hair and my stylist said I&#x27;d need gel to maintain it. Since this had pure clean written on the label I thought it wouldn&#x27;t flake. I was way off because when it dries it looks like glue in my hair. Gross!</li>
