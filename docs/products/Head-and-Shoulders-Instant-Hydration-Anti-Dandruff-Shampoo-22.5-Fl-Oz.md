      <li>OZ bottle is an excellent bargain.</li>

      <li>Very happy with the shampoo and would suggest others give it a try!</li>
      <li>The fragrance is like that of cantaloupe, and I especially liked the product for this reason..  </li>
      <li>/&gt;But the best part about the product is that it does seem to “leave hair beautiful”.  </li>

      <li>This shampoo does a great job for me.</li>
      <li>I have had great results with their 2in1 line</li>
      <li>The odor is pleasant  but not overpowering.</li>
      <li>It has a pleasant scent.</li>
      <li>H&amp;S &amp;#34;Instant Hydration&amp;#34; is a good dandruff shampoo</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s done a good job cleaning my hair and taking care of dandruff.</li>

      <li>The smell is nice.</li>
      <li>My wife says &amp;#34;smells really nice for Head &amp; Shoulders&amp;#34;.&lt;br</li>

      <li>While I received this as a sample, I&#x27;ve also purchased Head &amp; Shoulders on my own many times.  </li>
      <li>My husband has always liked &amp;#34;Head and Shoulders&amp;#34; but this one has become a favorite of his.  </li>
      <li>It is just as effective as older Head and Shoulders products, smells nice, and leave your hair and scalp feeling good after.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s nice that it doesn&#x27;t have that strong &amp;#34;dandruff shampoo&amp;#34; smell.</li>
      <li>I love this product.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;d gladly buy this again.</li>
      <li>Again, this smells more like a &amp;#34;salon&amp;#34; shampoo.</li>
      <li>so what more could you ask for?  </li>
      <li>like it even better now.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s better than ever.  </li>
      <li>This is used in many anti-dandruff products.</li>
      <li>a bit more like...</li>
      <li>This product with its Instant Hydration Formula seems to be a perfect solution to this balancing act.  </li>
      <li>Notably Dove&#x27;s anti dandruff shampoo.  </li>
      <li>My hair has been every bit as silky, moisturized and manageable as it is with my regular shampoo, which is the best surprise of all.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;It also has a nice clean aroma that stayed with me.  </li>
      <li>It lathered nice and rinsed out cleanly.</li>
      <li>This particular version does a great job of cleaning and moisturizing his hair all the while keeping his scalp flake free.  </li>
      <li>This is a nice, large sized bottle of the latest Head &amp; Shoulders &amp;#34;Hydration&amp;#34; formula shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>saw that this product offered more hydration than the original</li>
      <li>I also like the easy to grab bottle.</li>
      <li>The product is easy to use, though I did not do any tests to determine if it would stop dandruff.  </li>
      <li>A good new addition to the H&amp;S line up.</li>
      <li>I have used Head &amp; Shoulders for years because it works fine as a dandruff shampoo.  </li>
      <li>This is a nice large bottle and came shipped in a box with no breakage or spillage.</li>
      <li>You get a huge amount--22 ounces.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used this several times since I received it and it works great each time.</li>
      <li>scent is great,unisex and mostly rinses away just leaving the hair smelling fresh and clean.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I&#x27;d be perfectly comfortable recommending these to someone who didn&#x27;t have dandruff at all.  </li>
      <li>The scent is great and it actually works!  </li>
      <li>I use it in combination with the Smooth and Silky conditioner.</li>
      <li>Regular Head and Shoulders is a favorite in our house and this version is just as good.</li>
      <li>Most of them smell pretty similar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>After using it, my scalp does feel clean.</li>
      <li>Clean and now my hair felt clean and not stripped.  </li>
      <li>Just clean.</li>
      <li>I found that claim to be mostly true...</li>
      <li>This shampoo seems much more a hair product than an industrial solution to dandruff that the classic product seems.  </li>
      <li>This plastic bottle has convenient flat ends on both top and bottom, which means that it can be stored on its top in order to get the remaining contents out</li>
      <li>The flask has a stylish shape, and it is narrow, so that it will be able to fit on the corner shelf on your bathtub.  </li>
      <li>Definitely worth buying.</li>
      <li>I prefer more natural scents like coconut, apple, or honey.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It still has the same feel and lack of lather that I remember, but I guess the fact is, it is effective and for that I like this product.</li>
      <li>You can feel the difference right away.  </li>
      <li>In contrast, a round shampoo flask would not be able to fit so easily.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;After years of having oily hair and dandruff and loving H&amp;S as well as Selsun Blue, they both work very well</li>
      <li>It is as effective with dandruff as the regular version and really does seem to help with hydrating the scalp.  </li>
      <li>I can see this being a stellar product to add to the line of &amp;#34;Head and Shoulder&amp;#34; products.</li>
      <li>Our family has used Head and Shoulders shampoos of various types for many years.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It has a thinner texture than the regular version and a slightly more floral scent.  </li>
      <li>After the first use my hair felt softer.</li>
      <li>But that is the only positive he was able to give me.</li>
      <li>Hair feels clean for the most part, but everyone here in the family says they notice a slight &amp;#34;film&amp;#34; type feeling after washing their hair.</li>
      <li>Not dry and flaky but easily managed and shiny.  </li>
      <li>that it feels clean and soft.</li>
      <li>It keeps my hair clean, shiny and soft, plus my head doesn&#x27;t itch</li>
      <li>Large 22.5 oz bottle lasts and lasts.&lt;br /&gt;- Non-drying.  </li>
      <li>However, the dandruff formula works the same as it ever did, and the new smell is an interesting change.</li>
      <li>I also can’t say much about the scent – it doesn’t really seem to have much of one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t see much difference between it and Smooth and Silky Head and Shoulders which is my regular brand.  </li>
      <li>really like this</li>
      <li>They seem to work very well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>it was silky,soft,smoother and very well conditioned.</li>
      <li>Perhaps the hydration formula is a bit too much for our hair chemistry.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t have much of a problem with moisture but</li>
      <li>I think most people are familiar with the standard formula of head and shoulders, which is sets it apart from regular shampoos and clearly marks it as an anti-dandruff product.</li>
      <li>This &amp;#34;hydration&amp;#34; formula is more creamy in color and form, like other hydrating shampoos.</li>
      <li>original- and quite different in terms of scent and feel-</li>
      <li>People with long hair will still need a separate conditioner, but this is a nice alternative to regular h&amp;s.</li>
      <li>so I was excited to try their new Instant Hydration version.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll probably go back to the regular formula, but I could see this product appealing to people who don&#x27;t like the smell and feel of tradition anti-dandruff shampoos.</li>
      <li>I used to use this in high</li>
      <li>This Head &amp; Shoulders seems to move a little more toward the Dove</li>
      <li>It wasn&#x27;t until the last couple of years where I found a few other shampoos that seem as effective and feel better as a shampoo.  </li>
      <li>Head &amp; Shoulders has really been stepping up their game with all of the shampoos available for dandruff, so there are shampoos available for practically ALL hair types.</li>
      <li>Usually the aroma seems very utilitarian, and for this product it seems more aimed for appreciation.  </li>
      <li>She also says its very moisturizing and leaves her naturally curly hair very soft and manageable.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> The ingredients in Head &amp; Shoulders Dandruff Shampoo are similar to those of other Head and Shoulders Shampoos. The active ingredient is pyrithione zinc. This is used in many anti-dandruff products. This plastic bottle has convenient flat ends on both top and bottom, which means that it can be stored on its top in order to get the remaining contents out easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shampoo itself is a thick milky blue/green cream which emerges readily from the container. It is not oily or greasy and appears not to leave residues. The shampoo does not seem to be irritating if you get it in your eyes. The odor is pleasant  but not overpowering. After using it, my scalp does feel clean. My hair tends to curl. However, this conditioner seems to flatten my curls, but does leave my hair feeling very soft.</li>
    <li> Head &amp; Shoulders was my default shampoo for years.  It wasn&#x27;t until the last couple of years where I found a few other shampoos that seem as effective and feel better as a shampoo.  Notably Dove&#x27;s anti dandruff shampoo.  This Head &amp; Shoulders seems to move a little more toward the Dove product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was surprised that this shampoo very openly has an aroma.  Usually the aroma seems very utilitarian, and for this product it seems more aimed for appreciation.  This shampoo seems much more a hair product than an industrial solution to dandruff that the classic product seems.  It still has the same feel and lack of lather that I remember, but I guess the fact is, it is effective and for that I like this product.</li>
    <li> I have been using this shampoo for about a week and am very pleasantly surprised. I have not used Head &amp; Shoulders for years and years. After the first use my hair felt softer. I thought it may just be because it was a different product that I wasn&#x27;t used to. However, now that it has been about a week I can say that my hair definitely has a softer and smoother feel. The smell is nice. I was say it is neither feminine or masculine. Just clean.</li>
    <li> My son has been using Head &amp; Shoulders for about a decade. He typically uses the Clinical Strength, and sometimes alternates with the 2-in-1. I was surprised that he did not like this new Instant Hydration at all. He used it twice, and said he will not use it again. My son has longish, curly, thick hair. He tells me it felt &amp;#34;rubbery&amp;#34; when washing. After his hair dries, it feels coarser than usual.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent of this one is preferable. There is no strong medicinal scent, as with the others. But that is the only positive he was able to give me.</li>
    <li> Been using this now for over a week and it&#x27;s done a good job cleaning my hair and taking care of dandruff. Very happy with the shampoo and would suggest others give it a try!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this several times since I received it and it works great each time. I have seborrheic dermatitis which flares up periodically throughout the year, leaving my scalp inflamed. I also find that other brands of  shampoo tends to irritate my scalp because of sodium lauryl sulfate and other chemicals. Head and Shoulders is the consistently least irritating product I can use. This combined with my Head &amp; Shoulders conditioner works well to keep itchiness at about 90% throughout the year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This shampoo is supposed to be extra  hydrating. I don&#x27;t see much difference between it and Smooth and Silky Head and Shoulders which is my regular brand.  I use it in combination with the Smooth and Silky conditioner. It has a slight perfumy scent, which I am somewhat neutral about. I prefer more natural scents like coconut, apple, or honey.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is also extra-large and bigger than my usual head and shoulders shampoo bottle.</li>
    <li> This is a nice, large sized bottle of the latest Head &amp; Shoulders &amp;#34;Hydration&amp;#34; formula shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really like this shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Likes:&lt;br /&gt;- Aroma.  Understated but great-smelling, with hint of coconut but not too fruity. My wife says &amp;#34;smells really nice for Head &amp; Shoulders&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;- Value.  Large 22.5 oz bottle lasts and lasts.&lt;br /&gt;- Non-drying.  I use this alone, without conditioner, and my hair and scalp do still feel moisturized.&lt;br /&gt;- Effective.  Works as well as any Head &amp; Shoulders I know to keep itchy scalp in check.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dislikes:&lt;br /&gt;- None.  This is good stuff.</li>
    <li> My husband has been a Head and Shoulders user for years.  I shy away because it is usually pretty harsh for my hair.  I seem to have a dandruff problem in the winter worse than other months so I use an after shampoo stay-in product to reduce the flakes.&lt;br /&gt;I saw that this product offered more hydration than the original so I thought I would give it a try.  It really does provide a dandruff relief minus the &amp;#34;squeeky&amp;#34; feel of my hair being stripped of all of the moisture.&lt;br /&gt;I like it!</li>
    <li> I love this product. It smells amazing and it keeps my hair hydrated. Definitely worth buying.</li>
    <li> You can feel the difference right away.  I don&#x27;t have much of a problem with moisture but a part of my scalp that is sometime dry is much less so now after just a week of use.</li>
    <li> My husband has always liked &amp;#34;Head and Shoulders&amp;#34; but this one has become a favorite of his.  The hydration leaves his hair silvery and soft.  Not dry and flaky but easily managed and shiny.  I can see this being a stellar product to add to the line of &amp;#34;Head and Shoulder&amp;#34; products.</li>
    <li> I have used Head &amp; Shoulders for years because it works fine as a dandruff shampoo.  Here in southern California, hydration is an issue, so this version is welcome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has a thinner texture than the regular version and a slightly more floral scent.  It is as effective with dandruff as the regular version and really does seem to help with hydrating the scalp.  If you have either of those issues, give this a try.</li>
    <li> I am a big fan of this brand, and this product did not let me down.  It is just as effective as older Head and Shoulders products, smells nice, and leave your hair and scalp feeling good after.  I&#x27;d gladly buy this again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve recently tested several Head &amp; Shoulders dandruff shampoos.  I can tell you the following:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. None of them seem like dandruff shampoos.  They don&#x27;t have that coal tar, harsh scent or feel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. They seem to work very well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. Most of them smell pretty similar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4. They are well priced.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5. I&#x27;d be perfectly comfortable recommending these to someone who didn&#x27;t have dandruff at all.  You wouldn&#x27;t know it&#x27;s a dandruff shampoo, in my opinion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like this product.  And I&#x27;ll be using it even when little or no flaking is present.  While I received this as a sample, I&#x27;ve also purchased Head &amp; Shoulders on my own many times.  It&#x27;s better than ever.  5 stars.</li>
    <li> It keeps my hair clean, shiny and soft, plus my head doesn&#x27;t itch and there&#x27;s no dandruff... so what more could you ask for?  It does have a different fragrance than normal H&amp;S but I like it quite a bit. A good new addition to the H&amp;S line up.</li>
    <li> Head &amp; Shoulders is my go to dandruff shampoo.I have dry,crispy flaky hair with an itchy scalp. I generally use the 2in1 versions because it has a conditioner mixed with the shampoo. I have had great results with their 2in1 line so I was excited to try their new Instant Hydration version.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Instant Hydration version promises to restore moisture on contact. I found that claim to be mostly true...However I found that AFTER  my hair was dry it was silky,soft,smoother and very well conditioned. I think this version provides better results than the 2in1 versions! I am going to permanently switch to this version.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent is great,unisex and mostly rinses away just leaving the hair smelling fresh and clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The current selling price on Amazon of $3.29 for the 22.5 Fl.OZ bottle is an excellent bargain.</li>
    <li> This shampoo does a great job for me. Ordinarily my hair gets dry after washing it and requires using conditioner but not after using this shampoo. I will definitely keep using this shampoo on a regular basis.</li>
    <li> H&amp;S &amp;#34;Instant Hydration&amp;#34; is a good dandruff shampoo but I didn&#x27;t sense any difference this and some of the other formulas that they offer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After years of having oily hair and dandruff and loving H&amp;S as well as Selsun Blue, they both work very well and I used these every few days, but again, there&#x27;s no distinguishable difference/ standout performance with this formula.</li>
    <li> Our family has used Head and Shoulders shampoos of various types for many years. My husband is currently using this Instant Hydration Shampoo along with his standard conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shampoo has a slight scent but disappears very quickly while he is washing his hair.  His scalp is a combination and can vary between oily and dry.  The hydration promise of this shampoo seems to work as his scalp has not been dry since he starting using it. As with all H&amp;S products, it helps keep his dandruff under control.</li>
    <li> Starting about in middle school I got a nasty case of dandruff - my scalp itched all the time and I practically created flurries just by shaking my head.  My dad recommended Head &amp; Shoulders which, I admitted grudgingly, did help with the dandruff, but it mangled my hair.  I used it as little as possible and over the years I seemed to need it less and less.  I still get occasional flakes and a bit of itchiness, but I got to the point I just preferred to live with it rather than risk mangled hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I saw this product I thought I might give it another go.  This shampoo promises seven benefits:  removes flakes, calms itching, relieves irritation, reduces redness, great scent, fights dryness and, most important to me, leaves hair beautiful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over the week that I’ve been using this shampoo, it does seem to have eliminated the flakes and reduced the itching.  I can’t testify as to its ability to deal with either irritation or redness, as I didn’t suffer those symptoms to begin with.  I also can’t say much about the scent – it doesn’t really seem to have much of one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the best part about the product is that it does seem to “leave hair beautiful”.  Or, well, as beautiful as my hair gets anyway.  My hair has been every bit as silky, moisturized and manageable as it is with my regular shampoo, which is the best surprise of all.  The directions indicate to use this product at least twice a week, but so far I haven’t seen a reason not to use it every day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also like the design of the bottle in that it can be turned upside down as the product gets low so that every bit will come out.  Definitely recommended.</li>
    <li> Regular Head and Shoulders is a favorite in our house and this version is just as good. It has a pleasant scent. People with long hair will still need a separate conditioner, but this is a nice alternative to regular h&amp;s.</li>
    <li> HEAD &amp; SHOULDERS INSTANT HYDRATION shampoo comes in a large 700 milliliter flask.  The flask has a stylish shape, and it is narrow, so that it will be able to fit on the corner shelf on your bathtub.  In contrast, a round shampoo flask would not be able to fit so easily.  The product is pure white.  The fragrance is like that of cantaloupe, and I especially liked the product for this reason..  The product is easy to use, though I did not do any tests to determine if it would stop dandruff.  At any rate the active anti-dandruff ingredient is PYRITHIONE ZINC.  Although I have never took any scientific interest in the chemistry of cosmetics and soaps, for those who are interested, there are several publications on the efficacy of PYRITHIONE ZINC in stopping dandruff.  See, for example, Draelos, ZD, et al (2005) J. Investig. Dermatol. Symp. Proc. 10:201-204; Schwartz, JR, et al (2013) Int. J. Cosmet. Sci. 35:381-387; and Bacon, RA, et al. (2014) J. Dermatolog. Treat. 25:237-240.</li>
    <li> The product claims immediate hydration on contact. I have noticed an immediate difference with my dandruff/dry skin when I use this product. The scent is great and it actually works!  That&#x27;s enough for me!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not entirely sure this product offers much in the way of benefits over regular Head &amp; Shoulders, but it&#x27;s at least as good as the original- and quite different in terms of scent and feel- so someone looking for an alternative might want to give this a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;-Same active ingredient as Head &amp; Shoulders.&lt;br /&gt;-More &amp;#34;shampoo-like&amp;#34;. I think most people are familiar with the standard formula of head and shoulders, which is sets it apart from regular shampoos and clearly marks it as an anti-dandruff product. This &amp;#34;hydration&amp;#34; formula is more creamy in color and form, like other hydrating shampoos. Someone looking for that &amp;#34;salon shampoo&amp;#34; feel instead of Head &amp; Shoulders, would like this.&lt;br /&gt;-New, coconut-based smell. Again, this smells more like a &amp;#34;salon&amp;#34; shampoo. It&#x27;s a bit floral, and a bit more like... well, other hydrating shampoos.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;-None to report.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I can&#x27;t really say whether this has much of an effect on my hair, as I&#x27;m sporting a very short cut. However, the dandruff formula works the same as it ever did, and the new smell is an interesting change. I&#x27;ll probably go back to the regular formula, but I could see this product appealing to people who don&#x27;t like the smell and feel of tradition anti-dandruff shampoos.</li>
    <li> I used to use this in high school.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like it even better now.  You get a huge amount--22 ounces.  It really moisturized my hair and left it soft and silkuy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also has a nice clean aroma that stayed with me.  I also like the easy to grab bottle.</li>
    <li> It seems like those of us with itchy, scaly scalp are constantly on a teeter-totter between finding a product that will clean both out scalp well enough to keep down flakes and being too harsh and stripping our hair of necessary oil and having dull, straw-like hair.  Now this would be much easier if we could wash our hair and our scalp separately, but that is not possible.  This product with its Instant Hydration Formula seems to be a perfect solution to this balancing act.  My scalp was the usual &amp;#34;Head and Shoulders&amp;#34; Clean and now my hair felt clean and not stripped.  I didn&#x27;t need conditioner or any after wash product to remove what I had washed away and my hair and scalp appeared happy and healthy.  I am very pleased with this product.</li>
    <li> Nice scent, it takes care of the flakes well. It&#x27;s nice that it doesn&#x27;t have that strong &amp;#34;dandruff shampoo&amp;#34; smell. Hair feels clean for the most part, but everyone here in the family says they notice a slight &amp;#34;film&amp;#34; type feeling after washing their hair. Once dry, it&#x27;s not as noticeable. Perhaps the hydration formula is a bit too much for our hair chemistry. No problem, we&#x27;ll try one of their other shampoos. Head &amp; Shoulders has really been stepping up their game with all of the shampoos available for dandruff, so there are shampoos available for practically ALL hair types.</li>
    <li> Head &amp; Shoulders is the only shampoo my husband will use.  It does a terrific job of controlling his dandruff.  This particular version does a great job of cleaning and moisturizing his hair all the while keeping his scalp flake free.  It smells great too!</li>
    <li> Received today and not a day too soon because I ran out of shampoo a few days ago and I was hoping that this would come in soon. I really like the size of the bottle as it should last me awhile. It lathered nice and rinsed out cleanly. I liked the fragrance but my son said it was a little too perfumey for him and he&#x27;ll stick with the Head &amp; Shoulders Mens 2-in-1. I&#x27;m not sure if it gave my hair and scalp &#x27;instant hydration&#x27; but I do like how it is drying out in that it feels clean and soft.</li>
    <li> Head and Shoulders is the only shampoo I can use living in a dry climate. This is a nice large bottle and came shipped in a box with no breakage or spillage.</li>
    <li> My daughter used this shampoo specifically to remove temporary hair dye from her hair. (She combined it with regular dish detergent to make a paste which she left on her hair for several minutes before rinsing.) According to her the shampoo does work to dull the dye in her hair. She also says its very moisturizing and leaves her naturally curly hair very soft and manageable.</li>
