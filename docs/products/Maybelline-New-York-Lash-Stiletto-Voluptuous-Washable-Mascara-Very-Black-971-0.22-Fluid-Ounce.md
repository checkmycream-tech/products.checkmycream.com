      <li>- I get more length and volume with this than I do with Benefit</li>
      <li>Would buy more.</li>
      <li>and I absolutely love it.</li>
      <li>The curved brush is definitely the best part.</li>
      <li>But it washes off easily with a bit of soap and water.</li>
      <li>Plus, it&#x27;s easy to remove at night.  </li>
      <li>Also easy removal for eye area.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used this for years, and I&#x27;ve tried many, many other mascaras, but none of them are as good as this one.</li>
      <li>The mascara was a great buy, but I do believe that it was on shelf too long.  </li>
      <li>Those with long lashes should stick to wetter formulas, like Great Lash.</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t say enough about this mascara - it is by far the best I&#x27;ve used.</li>
      <li>The different brush also made my lashes have more volume, but still kept nice length.</li>
      <li>Love this mascara but can&#x27;t really seem to find it in stores anymore.</li>
      <li>I will just stick to the store when I need a quick mascara fix again</li>
      <li>The product is clumpy and dryer than most new prodcuts when they are opened.</li>
      <li>This is the second time 4 me 2 purchase this mascara, its amazing ...</li>
      <li>I was able to fix it with some water, but just guessing the product was really old.</li>
      <li>love this mascara, it makes my lashes look really really nice makes them look as if I have fake lashes on. :)</li>
      <li>will continue to order, couldn&#x27;t have been easier, and such a better value than in the stores.</li>
      <li>I was a devotee of the regular Lash Stiletto, but this is even better.  </li>
      <li>It makes my lashes look super long and full with two coats.</li>
      <li>You really just have to learn which ones work for you.</li>
      <li>Thanks a lot.</li>
      <li>i love this mascara which is getting harder to find in the stores as well.</li>
      <li>/&gt;First, this product claims to be \\&quot;very black\\&quot;.  </li>
      <li>and it really seprates each of my lash.  </li>
      <li>They&#x27;re Real.</li>
      <li>but this is the real brand</li>
      <li>If you dip the wand in the product and swipe what&#x27;s on the end of the wand over the tips of your lashes and then go back and refine it by a regular application of mascara with the wand, it coats much better.</li>
      <li>I can recommend this product with complete confidence and urge others to give it a whirl!</li>
      <li>Yes, the formula is \\&quot;drier\\&quot; than other mascaras, but that&#x27;s not necessarily a bad thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>In fact, the mascara tends to be soft in nature, which could be good if going for a less stark</li>
      <li>No clumps, no mess, and my lashes look like I got falsies on.</li>
      <li>I really like this mascara, especially in comparison with the regular Lash Stiletto.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Third, I didn&#x27;t like how quickly the mascara dried up and clumped to the wand.  </li>
      <li>This came to me fully packaged, when I opened it, the whole tube was dry!</li>
      <li>Depending on how many coats are applied, this mascara can be both natural and dramatic.</li>
      <li>It leaves me with lush, full, black lashes that look so, so long!  </li>
      <li>The shade of this mascara is soft enough for every day use.  </li>
      <li>Just remember that there is no universal beauty product and you can&#x27;t rely on other people to hold your hand when buying make-up - or anything, really!</li>
      <li>It was old and dry when it arrived.</li>
      <li>The mascara is dry and flaky and seems quite old.  </li>

<li> It was old and dry when it arrived.</li>
<li> The mascara is dry and flaky and seems quite old.  </li>
<li> I&#x27;m of fairer skin, and I do think think this black is a very true, deep black like other mascaras are.  </li>
<li> The formula is a little drier than I&#x27;d like, but for the amount of wow my lashes get from this, who cares?</li>
<li> The bristles were short and not very separate in themselves.  </li>
<li> It stays on as long as you don&#x27;t wipe your eyes.</li>
<li> I have very long lashes, and they tend to get pressed together towards the ends of my eyes.  </li>
<li> It will dry up again.</li>
<li> An average mascara lasts 2-3 months, and this one did not last that stretch of time by any means.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> I always use Maybelline Last Stiletto on my eyelashes because I like to make them black and seem longer, and this stuff does the trick.</li>
<li> It arrived faster than I expected, although the package was a little dinged up, the overall product was not affected.</li>
<li> I tend to agree with some of the other complaints throughout the reviews.  </li>
<li> When I got the product the packaging was a little worn and when I opened it the mascara was totally dry.</li>
<li> This is the only mascara I&#x27;ve ever worn where people have actually asked me if I was wearing false eyelashes.</li>
<li> The brush&#x27;s oddly curved design brings out the fullest lashes I&#x27;ve had</li>
<li> I would not recommend this color black to anyone who is looking for a very dark black.</li>
<li> This product was dried out as soon as I opened it.</li>
<li> I purchased this product after watching a few reviews on youtube.  </li>
<li> Waste of money.</li>
<li> I have been using this mascara for a few years now</li>
<li> it made my eyelashes so long and thick too bad they don&#x27;t sell it in stores anymore</li>
<li> /&gt;Second, when attempting to attain length and volume, I found that the wand was too simplistic.  </li>
<li> Try it; you will not be disappointed.</li>
<li> This is the worst, driest, oldest, crap mascara I have ever bought!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This is my number one mascara. I&#x27;ve used this for years, and I&#x27;ve tried many, many other mascaras, but none of them are as good as this one. The brush&#x27;s oddly curved design brings out the fullest lashes I&#x27;ve had - I get more length and volume with this than I do with Benefit They&#x27;re Real. The formula is a little drier than I&#x27;d like, but for the amount of wow my lashes get from this, who cares? This is the only mascara I&#x27;ve ever worn where people have actually asked me if I was wearing false eyelashes. I can&#x27;t say enough about this mascara - it is by far the best I&#x27;ve used. Maybelline, please never discontinue this!!!</li>
    <li> will continue to order, couldn&#x27;t have been easier, and such a better value than in the stores. i love this mascara which is getting harder to find in the stores as well.</li>
    <li> Ive been using this mascara for years I love it, but the best thing is the price, delivered very quickly . I&#x27;m totally satisfied.</li>
    <li> I really like this mascara, especially in comparison with the regular Lash Stiletto. The brush has a curve in it, which made it easier to work with on the lashes. The different brush also made my lashes have more volume, but still kept nice length. This is one of my favorite Maybelline mascaras. Depending on how many coats are applied, this mascara can be both natural and dramatic.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product after watching a few reviews on youtube.  I would not recommend this color black to anyone who is looking for a very dark black. The shade of this mascara is soft enough for every day use.  I like the shape of the brush and it really seprates each of my lash.  I love all of Maybellines product and I will continue to purchase there mascaras.</li>
    <li> This used to be my favorite mascara, but they discontinued it. I was super happy when I found it. When I got the product the packaging was a little worn and when I opened it the mascara was totally dry. I was able to fix it with some water, but just guessing the product was really old.</li>
    <li> when i bought this i thought that i was going to get a knock off brand but this is the real brand and it is way cheaper. also i got this for my girlfriend and she was stunned at the price</li>
    <li> This is the second time 4 me 2 purchase this mascara, its amazing ... it gives very good curled lashes at a very good price</li>
    <li> The best mascara ever.  Re&#x27;cd it, used it and loved it!  Stays on &amp; washes off well.  It makes my eyes pop!</li>
    <li> This is the worst, driest, oldest, crap mascara I have ever bought! What was it in storage from 1990!? Thanks a lot.</li>
    <li> This product was dried out as soon as I opened it. I think they may have sold me an expired one.</li>
    <li> This mascara is wonderful!  It leaves me with lush, full, black lashes that look so, so long!  Plus, it&#x27;s easy to remove at night.  Win, Win!</li>
    <li> I always use Maybelline Last Stiletto on my eyelashes because I like to make them black and seem longer, and this stuff does the trick.</li>
    <li> love this mascara, it makes my lashes look really really nice makes them look as if I have fake lashes on. :)</li>
    <li> favorite mascara ever ! I love it made my eyelashes so long and thick too bad they don&#x27;t sell it in stores anymore</li>
    <li> Best stuff on the market for the lengthening of eye lashes with out smudging. Also easy removal for eye area. Try it; you will not be disappointed.</li>
    <li> The reason why this product is getting mixed reviews is because of the formula. Yes, the formula is \\&quot;drier\\&quot; than other mascaras, but that&#x27;s not necessarily a bad thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Drier formulas work FANTASTICALLY on girls with shorter lashes, like mine. I love this mascara and it wasn&#x27;t clumpy at all. Those with long lashes should stick to wetter formulas, like Great Lash. Just remember that there is no universal beauty product and you can&#x27;t rely on other people to hold your hand when buying make-up - or anything, really! You really just have to learn which ones work for you.</li>
    <li> I did not like this mascara. It was old and dry when it arrived. I will just stick to the store when I need a quick mascara fix again</li>
    <li> This is by far the best mascara I&#x27;ve ever used: my lashes are loooong and it doesn&#x27;t clump.  I have backups just in case I can&#x27;t find it anymore!</li>
    <li> The mascara was a great buy, but I do believe that it was on shelf too long.  The product is clumpy and dryer than most new prodcuts when they are opened.</li>
    <li> Stiletto mascara is my favorite kind out there!</li>
    <li> I love this masacara.  I was a devotee of the regular Lash Stiletto, but this is even better.  It doesn&#x27;t clump, spike or flake off...my lashes look incredible, even with one coat!  I can recommend this product with complete confidence and urge others to give it a whirl!</li>
    <li> Love this mascara but can&#x27;t really seem to find it in stores anymore. I would recommend and also repurchase.</li>
    <li> It arrived faster than I expected, although the package was a little dinged up, the overall product was not affected. It works fairly well. I like it.</li>
    <li> I tend to agree with some of the other complaints throughout the reviews.  I have very long lashes, and they tend to get pressed together towards the ends of my eyes.  When purchasing a product, I hope to have separation, length, and volume.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, this product claims to be \\&quot;very black\\&quot;.  I&#x27;m of fairer skin, and I do think think this black is a very true, deep black like other mascaras are.  In fact, the mascara tends to be soft in nature, which could be good if going for a less stark look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second, when attempting to attain length and volume, I found that the wand was too simplistic.  The bristles were short and not very separate in themselves.  This tended to make the wand clumpy, both on the mascara wand and when applying the mascara to my eyelashes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Third, I didn&#x27;t like how quickly the mascara dried up and clumped to the wand.  An average mascara lasts 2-3 months, and this one did not last that stretch of time by any means.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think that this mascara does in fact increase the length of the lash, but not to the degree of the claims on the product description.  In order to get a true volume factor, more work is needed to attain an attractive curl and length.</li>
    <li> I like this brand of mascara, but the packages I received looked like they had been stored in someone&#x27;s cellar or had come from a garage sale.  The mascara is dry and flaky and seems quite old.  Will not order from this vendor again.</li>
    <li> I love this mascara, use it often.  It makes my lashes long and gorgeous and separates them perfectly.  I&#x27;m a big fan.</li>
    <li> I like it a lot. No clumps, no mess, and my lashes look like I got falsies on. Would buy more.</li>
    <li> I have been using this mascara for a few years now and I absolutely love it. It makes my lashes look super long and full with two coats. The curved brush is definitely the best part. I recommend it to anyone looking for thicker, fuller eyelashes.</li>
    <li> This is the mascara to end all mascaras.</li>
    <li> This mascara is great for daytime use with one coat or nighttime with two coats! If you dip the wand in the product and swipe what&#x27;s on the end of the wand over the tips of your lashes and then go back and refine it by a regular application of mascara with the wand, it coats much better. If you apply 2 coats, do one eye at a time so there&#x27;s not enough drying time for it to get clumpy! I&#x27;ve used this mascara for years. It stays on as long as you don&#x27;t wipe your eyes. Even if you cry, just don&#x27;t touch your eyes! It will dry up again. But it washes off easily with a bit of soap and water.</li>
    <li> This came to me fully packaged, when I opened it, the whole tube was dry! I couldn&#x27;t get any out for even one application. Waste of money.</li>
    <li> My favorite mascara. I&#x27;ve purchased several times and have never had any problems with clumping.</li>
