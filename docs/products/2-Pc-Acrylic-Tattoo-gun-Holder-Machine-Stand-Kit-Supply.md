<li> some balance weird and others balance fine.</li>
<li> Needed these for a LONG time...</li>
<li> Also the tube holders only hold the small tubes grips,  and I use faster tube grippers.</li>
<li> would recommend this to anyone to keep the guns off the table or laying down</li>
<li> Next the other machine holder arrived cracked on the bottom.. I would have sent it back but only paid 10 dollars for the crap..  </li>
<li> is that since every gun is different(at least slightly)</li>
<li> Came on time even after i got an email saying it might be late.</li>
<li> I have expensive machines</li>
<li> I was very skeptical when I looked at this.</li>

    <li> nice! and right on time</li>
    <li> Holds machine just fine :)</li>
    <li> Fits guns! sturdy and doesnt tilt over.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this to anyone to keep the guns off the table or laying down</li>
    <li> Bought these for my Husband and he is very pleased!! He&#x27;s been hinting around about needing a tatt gun holder and now he has not 1, but 2!! Wasn&#x27;t sure how sturdy they would be since they are clear acrylic, but they seem to be fairly solid and sturdy!! Love them!! Would recommend to all buyers!! Thanks!!</li>
    <li> OK, so I should have wrote this review sooner since my product was damaged when it arrived. I ordered these machine holders and right away one of them were glued on crooked so when I place my machine in it turned over.  I have expensive machines I can&#x27;t risk this junk breaking my equipment. Next the other machine holder arrived cracked on the bottom.. I would have sent it back but only paid 10 dollars for the crap..  Good luck</li>
    <li> Unusable if you tattoo with 1 inch grips.</li>
    <li> These lil babies do just what they say they will do. No more laying down the guns now.. Very happy!</li>
    <li> Love this nice and strong</li>
    <li> They are not the same as in the picture...  there is no cut out in the top to hold the machine...  also unless you have an autoclave they are illegal to use in WI....</li>
    <li> awesome will buy from seller again</li>
    <li> As looks on photo very nicely made. The package was wrapped very well could have drop kicked it then opened it and it would have been in great shape. The round rings are on there good no fear of them falling off</li>
    <li> was nice to receive these in one piece I cant wait to use them tonight for the foirst time going to be great to not have to set my guns on there sides</li>

    <li> Was needing a gun holder and these filled the bill. I like the fact you get two. They are exactly as it is described and the seller got it right on out for me. I received it in no time. Another company I will order from for tattoo supplies.</li>
    <li> Came on time even after i got an email saying it might be late. so that was cool. Only part i dont like about these is that since every gun is different(at least slightly) some balance weird and others balance fine. some the grip hits the walls some dont. not like they are custom stands or something so yea i feel i got what i paid for (and yea if you are not as lazy as me you can make em for pretty cheap especially if you have a hot glue gun and a way to cut some acrylic youre basically set)</li>
