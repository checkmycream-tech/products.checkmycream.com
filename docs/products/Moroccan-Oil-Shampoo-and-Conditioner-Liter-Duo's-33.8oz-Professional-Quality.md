<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I bought a small bottle love it then i got the largest bottle and is like it was differents products i dont have the same results on my hair</li>
    <li> Great product and size</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s my favorite shampoo and conditioner!!! Leaves my hair silky smooth. I purchase through Amazon because of the value.</li>
    <li> my hair did ok with this product (AA with relaxed hair). It didn&#x27;t create a noticeable difference in my hair&#x27;s health so I stopped using it because it&#x27;s too expensive to not have miraculous results.</li>
    <li> the product is great arrived on time. the only problem was it was sent on an envelope and the bottles were a little banged up, and the conditioner spilled a little. other than that this product is amazing</li>
    <li> Excellent combo. My wife had her hair badly damaged by improper coloring by her old stylist and she went crazy. Her new stylist suggested she tried to repair what was left of her hair with this Moroccan Oil combo plus the mask and it worked great. It saved her hair, bringing it back to life, repairing it and making it shiny again. It is expensive but it got the job done and the results were amazing.</li>
    <li> I really like the shampoo and conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;Will use it again</li>
    <li> I absolutely love the Moroccan Oil Shampoo and Conditioner that I purchased. I was really glad to find that this seller sold the two products together as well. The shipping was really speedy but when I received my box, the shampoo (which had visibly been taped so the pump wouldn&#x27;t shoot up) had opened and a little bit of it had spilled out. I&#x27;m still very satisfied with my purchase, but I just wanted to make it known that maybe the box should have been packaged with a little more padding.</li>
    <li> Seemed different than previous purchase</li>
    <li> Expensive but makes my hair behave.</li>
    <li> My favorite shampoo. A dime-sized amount releases gorgeous lather and scent and rinses to shiny full hair. The conditioner is not oily or greasy and leaves my hair tangle-free.</li>
    <li> Moroccan Oil shampoo and conditioner work very well for my thick wavy hair.  It is color treated and withstands heat styling with no split ends or breakage.  This set moisturizes without weighing down my hair, I&#x27;ve been using it for years and am still addicted to it.</li>
    <li> I use these for light days and I use the deep conditioner with heat and then co-wash my hair with this conditioner.</li>
    <li> this is the real stuff  watch for the other letter M stuff a little different in the label.  at 50 dollars a bottle its a little expensive but it workes well and keeps your hair looking nice.  My hair is color treated.</li>
    <li> Life changed after  Moroccanoil ! I absolutely recommend that product! Hair shinnes and gets a very healthy ! Lastima a long time as you online need to use a smalll quantity.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m kind of a natural girl and frugal to boot, and I&#x27;ve never been a believer in expensive shampoos, face creams, etc, but I am sold on Moroccan Oil. The very first time I used it, my husband commented on how soft my still-wet hair felt--and he *never* notices that kind of thing. My hair is soft and lustrous with Moroccan oil. It combs out easy, and I don&#x27;t even have to use the conditioner every time. Love this stuff. Worth the money.</li>
    <li> My hair is damaged a lot because of changing color lots of times.  This soften, and i feel my hair becomes much softer.  It&#x27;s good, better than expected.</li>
    <li> I started using this after my beautician&#x27;s recommendation.  Love it for colored hair too!</li>
    <li> The product was delivered before the due date, and it was in perfect condition. Needless to say about Moroccan oil shampoo and conditioner, they are the best.</li>
    <li> This is top of the line at a great price. I&#x27;ve been using it for years. It makes your hair soft and shiny and it has an awesome aroma.</li>
    <li> Wife loves it for her damaged hair.</li>
    <li> I have very thick and curly hair that can be very dry but this has been the best shampoo and conditioner!</li>
    <li> I love both of these products. The savings by buying a larger quantity is substantial. I would recommend this product and the vendor.</li>
    <li> Love the product and would recommend it anybody and will buy it again.</li>
    <li> I usually love Moroccan oil but this product did not leave my hair that it usually does. I think its because I usually get the Volume shampoo from Moroccan oil.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m addicted! I just hopped on the moroccan oil boat and wished I hada jumped on sooner. I love the smell of these products and the way it makes my hair feel. It has made my hair shinier, healthier and smoother. It&#x27;s wonderful stuff and a little goes a long way! I have extensions and this product is perfect to treat them and helps them to be smooth and frizz free all day!</li>
    <li> MY DAUGHTERS AND I USE THIS PRODUCT ONCE A WEEK WHEN WE GO TO THE HAIR SALON.&lt;br /&gt;WE LOVE THE SHEEN THAT IT GIVES TO OUR HAIR. WE HAVE BEEN USING THIS PRODUCT FOR ABOUT THREE YEARS NOW.</li>
    <li> I was told about this product by a family member so ordered it and I&#x27;m very pleased.  My hair is so soft and healthy looking, a real change in just a couple of months.  Love the fact that my hair is so easy to put a brush through and that I never have oily looking hair.  I have had to wash my hair daily for years, now every other day is good.</li>
    <li> I have plans to continue to acquire data as shampoo! You can pack them like that anyway? has once again come to the shampoo spilled half! and why he removed the shelf life of the goods? it has expired?</li>
    <li> Smells good and makes my hair very soft</li>
    <li> I have thick corse hair, anf now thanks to this product, its like a black barbie doll, silky straight, no relaxer required!</li>
    <li> Ótimo produto e ótimo vendedor.  Recomendo ambos a todos.  Produto chegou no prazo e bem embalado.  Não tive qualquer dificuldade.  Produto excelente para qualquer tipo de cabelo.</li>
    <li> This shampoo and conditioner is awesome! When I started using Moroccanoil shampoo and conditioner my hair became very healthy. I get a lot of compliments on my hair now. I also use the oil and the styling cream. It smell so good. My husband smells my hair all the time. Lol</li>
    <li> Love, love, love this stuff. My hair dresser turned me on to it and I generally won&#x27;t use anything else unless I&#x27;m desperate! It&#x27;s a little pricey but well worth it. Don&#x27;t purchase this in a salon--you get  more bang for your buck purchasing it here.</li>
    <li> Used it once and the shampoo dried out my hair and the conditioner was virtually non existent.  The conditioner doesn&#x27;t even soften your hair enough to detangle it. Dime store brands are better.  I am really disappointed with the Moroccan brand.  I use their deep conditioner and other products and they are fantastic!  Don&#x27;t know what happened here.  I guess it&#x27;s possible I could have received a knock-off.  The label was a slightly different color than the ones in the store.  In any case, I&#x27;m out over $100 and I will never purchase this product again and I will never purchase anything from this seller again!  Expensive lesson.</li>
    <li> This product seemed to be a knock off from the original. It had yellow nozzles instead of white.</li>
    <li> Excellent! Item as described.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t realize this product has all the same bad crap in it that I have been avoiding buying other products because of ! Try UnClean shampoo, it&#x27;s the real deal and works great !</li>
    <li> I really, really love this product line and was happy to finally be able to purchase it by the liter.</li>
    <li> I bought it for my wife. Her hair stylist swears by it. Says it is the Moroccan oil that is the secret, and that it is &amp;#34;gold.&amp;#34; Have to admit, I tried it and liked it too. Must be the &amp;#34;oil.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> Received this order today (5 June) after ordering it on 22 May, which means it was 14 days between order and receipt.  At another time in history this would probably be just fine, but in today&#x27;s day and age - with immediate fulfillment common - it just seemed to take forever. Of course, the solution is to order before I run out, but ... just not something that I think about two weeks in advance. Other than the slow arrival, the product appears to be as ordered/expected and it was the lowest price I could find. I haven&#x27;t used it yet, but would imagine it is what it is purported to be.</li>
    <li> Save your money and buy Suave!  It smells just as good and I&#x27;ve never found that the more expensive shampoos do a better job...they just cost more!  I will never buy this again!</li>
    <li> Its a really good product. Leaves hair smelling good. Non-sticky/residue. Clwan. Keeps my hair feeling soft. Have used this product before. Four stars for the price. But my hair is also chemically treated with a keratin so I really wanted to get it.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t use this product but my wife does and she loves it. Besides after she comes out of the bath the whole house smell fresh and good. She feels it is very good for the hair.</li>
    <li> Moroccan Oil shampoo and conditioner are amazing.  The scent is exotic and delicious, and the products leave your hair soft and shiny.  I have found using the shampoo and conditioner has improved the condition of my  hair over all.  I think it you have fine hair using them every day could end up weighing your hair down, but using them a couple times a week has worked great for me.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a good product and it works!  I&#x27;m a repeat customer because I was satisfied in the past.</li>
    <li> I have been using these products for awhile now and my hair is amazing. No problems with delivery, got it sooner than expected!</li>
    <li> Helped my hair los... my wife got it first but i am hooked</li>
    <li> This is the second time I ordered this and both time one bottle arrived broken ( the squirting part) - This is unacceptable considering the price of the item -</li>
    <li> These products are the best for damaged hair and smell SO good!</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo and conditioner.  They clean well and have a nice scent.  They also come out of the pump reasonably (a problem with the last brand I was using).</li>
    <li> This is the best way to order hair products. It came in perfect condition. So much cheaper than  buying in a salon.</li>
    <li> Love these, glad they are available in the large size with pump dispensers.  Makes use easy, know how much I am dispensing and results are always great.</li>
    <li> I have highlited but normal hair, but I loved the product, very efficient and really cost the money you pay. It softens and smoothed the hair and gives some extra shine.</li>
    <li> I love the Moroccan Oil shampoo and conditioner.  It makes my hair so soft and it tames it down as I have wavy hair.  The hydrating styling cream is also very good.&lt;br /&gt;When I blow dry my hair with a round brush, the products make my hair pretty straight.  My hair doesn&#x27;t seem to be that frizzy also when I blow it dry.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend the Moroccan Oil line!</li>
    <li> its nice to buy A saloon size shampoo and conditioner. A little expensive, but It is A really nice product</li>
    <li> This shampoo, hair conditioning and the moroccanoil , turned my ugly hair beautiful. Best I have used for my frizzy hair. Thank god I purchased it althought it was so expensive but feeling good is worth every cent!</li>
    <li> I agree with the other 1 stars. I&#x27;ve used morraccan oil shampoo and conditioner for a while. I think this is fake. It doesn&#x27;t smell like the salon stuff I get and my hair doesn&#x27;t feel the same. Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> My hairdresser recommended this shampoo and conditioner several years ago, and I have used since.  It leaves my hair really clean, without those ingredients store-bought shampoos/conditioners contain.  And don&#x27;t let the name fool you.  It isn&#x27;t oily at all.</li>
    <li> Love the scent of the moroccan oils and I would buy it again.</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo and conditioner.  I have been purchasing smaller bottles at the salon and it&#x27;s great to have a larger amount.</li>
    <li> I love the way it makes my wifes hair look, Very sheen and full of life!</li>
    <li> Love this and it was a GREAT price!</li>
    <li> Outstanding. I love it!</li>
    <li> Either Moroccan oil products have gone really downhill, or this is a FAKE. The packaging was terrible and there was shampoo and conditioner leaking everywhere. They taped it with regular scotch tape and the tops of the bottle swere partially unscrewed. The shampoo smelled like actual moroccanoil, but the conditioner didn&#x27;t at all. My hair feels like I washed it with cheap drugstore shampoo and conditioner, and I have used moroccan oil shampoo and contioner before, this is not what it feels like!</li>
    <li> Amazing product for all hair types.  Hair is soft and smooth every time.  I recommend the oil as well before drying to really give it a nice finish!</li>
    <li> Great shampoo and conditioner -- love, love LOVE that it&#x27;s a lot less expensive to purchase on Amazon in large quantities!</li>
    <li> very nice product. highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I have been using Morrocan Oil for about 2 years and it is truly amazing.  My hairdresser recommended it to me. I have thin, light brown hair and after a couple months of using this, my hair is thicker and so much healthier.  I get so many comments about my hair now and it is completely due to this product.  Please try it for a couple months especially if you have ever dyed your hair.</li>
    <li> We use for 2 years We loved  product accept price :( but ,my husband don&#x27;t have eny more problem with dandruff I will buy more</li>
    <li> I love this combo of Moroccan shampoo and conditioner.  A little goes a long way.  Will probably last 6 mo or more.  Hair is very shiny and soft.  Easy to manage.  Will definitely buy again and again!</li>
    <li> Since my stylist recommended this product I have used it faithfully and love the condition my hair is in.  I had switched to a less expensive product for a short time and my hair got very dry.  Within a week or returning to Moroccan brand it is back to beautiful.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this combination for 2years and suddenly as of this purchase I have broken out in a rash on my scalp, ears, neck and anywhere else this product touched my skin. I used it for a few months until I realized that is was causing a reaction. I&#x27;ve stopped using them but wondering if morrocan oil has changed their fragrance or formula?  I&#x27;m so disappointed as I have really loved how it worked on my hair.  I won&#x27;t be able to use it again, it&#x27;s not worth the discomfort!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a long time user of Moroccan oil. I had been using wen shampoo for several years now. My stylist suspected the w/e and shampoo was not good for my color treatment. So I switched to these shampoos and conditioners and absolutely love how soft and silky my hair is</li>
    <li> Very pleased with the product and shipping experience</li>
    <li> and I look like one too. This shampoo and conditioner combo is a luxury item for me but my hair never looks as good without it.</li>
    <li> I absolutely LOVE the Moroccan Oil moisture line!  I wish this was sold in salon backbar gallon sizes!  It smells AMAZING.  It is a little pricier than most salon lines, but it is definitely worth it!  This is easy on the hair, gentle enough to be used daily if needed.  Cruelty free (not tested on animals) means a lot to me, AND although I do alternate occasionally with Goldwell Kerasilk &amp; Aveda, this is the ONLY line I use on my chinchilla kitty, whose hair is silkier than most humans.  I have compared this to alternate branded argan oil shampoo/conditioner(s), and they pale in comparison to [this] the REAL Moroccan Oil.  Gentle, healthy, cruelty free, and smells AMAZING.  ;o)</li>
    <li> It just does not work at all and my hair gets even worse. I think LOREAL works even better than it does.</li>
    <li> I have tried everything under the sun...  I love this product, it is a little pricy so I switched to an Aveda product and then tried Wen... but nothing works as amazingly as this product.  I have fine and thin hair, this product gives me gloss and volume</li>
    <li> These are amazing products. They are worth the price. My hair looks and feels healthy.  I love the smell so I purchased the 33.8 oz bottles because is made more sense.  I have color in my hair and these products treat my color also.</li>
    <li> I ordered this online because the price is so much better than in a salon. Great product for over treated hair. I have straight hair and still have body using this product line.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff! Worth the cost!</li>
    <li> Love this product - works wonders for my frizz - even in high humidity! Delivered sooner than expected which is always a plus.</li>
    <li> Love Moroccan Oil products.  Leaves hair soft and manageable.  Will always recommend it to everyone.</li>
    <li> My third set of orders.....the best quality items out there!</li>
    <li> I like it so much.. so expensive :(</li>
    <li> We have been using this product for many years and my wife really love it.  Leaves our hair feeling great and not dry.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve just got my large liters but I&#x27;ve been using Moroccan oil shampoo/conditioner for many years off and on. I&#x27;ve decided that I would make it my only shampoo - thus the large purchase.  This shampoo is creamy and you do not need a lot of product to get your hair clean.  It rinses easily and makes your hair very smooth.  I have curly hair and this product keeps it moisturized whether I straighten it or leave it natural.  the light fragrance is very nice!!</li>
    <li> The shampoo its ok but the conditioner did not for it does not hold the suppose smoothness and aroma as other Moroccan oil use in the past... I could probably even say that this conditioner was mixed with another conditioner of lesser value and smoothness consistency..!!! I will NEVER buy this products from this seller AGAIN. Spend Too much money for it and feel very disappointed..!!! 😒😣😖</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t use this for a few days before needing to style my hair, but it keeps it silky and straight if I just have it down.</li>
    <li> My wife like this product very much it would be nice if the cost was about half though. Can you lady&#x27;s agree with me on that?</li>
    <li> Exactly what they described.  Fast shipping.</li>
    <li> I love it, it makes my hair so manageable and soft.</li>
    <li> Great products for dry, frizzy hair.  Price much cheaper than in salons.</li>
    <li> Smells divine and leaves my hair feeling even better! Well worth the price. So glad I bought the 33.8oz bottles of shampoo and conditioner</li>
    <li> Package arrived when it said it would, no paperwork in the box, bottles wrapped in Candian newspaper. The first time I used the conditioner, the nozzle on the pump broke in half and cut my hand. I emailed the company over 2 weeks ago to see if they could send me a new pump for the bottle and have yet to receive a reply. So like it says in the title, the actual product is fine, however lack of a response and a broken bottle top is poor customer service...</li>
    <li> I have used Moroccanoil Shampoo and conditioner for over a year now and it is hands down the best shampoo and conditioner I have ever come across.  It is perfect for my wavy hair and the dry winters.  Absolutely love it.</li>
    <li> My Hair Dresser turned me onto this product and I love it.  My hair is so much softer than before</li>
    <li> I love this brand as it leaves my hair smelling good, and soft; however, upon delivery, one of the spouts do not work.  Fortunately, it was packaged in plastic bags so the leaks were contained.  It must of happened during shipment.</li>
    <li> I love it!!!! It&#x27;s amazing...</li>
    <li> I like it but when I get shampoo it&#x27;s open</li>
    <li> The shampoo is ok but the conditioner is terrible-your better off with store bought products.  Doesn&#x27;t live up to it&#x27;s name.</li>
    <li> love this shampoo and conditioner the bottles are big so money per oz it does save me money buying the larger bottle</li>
    <li> Very good, received it very fast,  thanks</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo and conditioner. I have been using it for ages and it keeps my hair nice and healthy! Received this from this seller on time and as expected.</li>
    <li> This is the best shampoo and conditioner ever! It leaves your hair smelling good and extremely soft. I recommend buying this shampoo and conditioner especially from this seller because its a great price and the big bottles last a long time. It&#x27;s not your crappy shampoo you buy at the market it a good quality. Try it.</li>
    <li> I purchase three sets of these for my girls every Christmas.  They last for almost the full year.  They are very pleased.</li>
    <li> Love Moroccan shampoo and conditioner - even the moroccan oil is great for my hair -- best hair products on the market.  Worth the price!</li>
    <li> Extremely disappointed! I have used Moroccan Oil hair products for a number of years and it has done wonders for my hair. It gives your hair a smooth, silky, and healthy feel and appearance that is unmatched by any other product. This set of shampoo and conditioner that I received has left my hair feeling very dry, frizzy, and tangled. It is not like the real product that I have purchased for many years from salons. I decided to try ordering this product on amazon in order to try saving some money. I&#x27;ve learned my lesson and I will never purchase from this seller again. I wasted over $100 on fake Moroccan Oil shampoo/conditioner and cannot return it. Save yourself the headache and just buy the real product</li>
    <li> I did purchase this set on amazon along with another product from Clinique. Upon receiving this purchase was just the shampoo and makeup remover from clinique. I have not received the conditioner because it was not in the box and I&#x27;m leaving the USA at 8:00 in the morning the day 11/04/2003. I feel sad and can not even recomder for girlfriends. TODAY is 10/31/2013  Isabel Angeirasf</li>
    <li> I can tell the difference in my hair when using the moroccan oil products and other products.&lt;br /&gt;I would highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I used this a couple of times and expected an incredible improvement in my colored straight thin hair.  Not so.  My hair didn&#x27;t maintain the shine.  It cleaned but almost seemed like it was striped of much needed nutrients.</li>
    <li> Always come back for more of this.  Love the smell and how my hair feels.</li>
    <li> Not the real product! The shampoo smells and feels like it was cut with ivory soap and the conditioner is mixed with something as well. I&#x27;ve been using this product consistently for over 4 years and this is a fake!</li>
    <li> Great value, much cheaper then local salons</li>
    <li> I love and use this and my married daughters as will. Package perfect and ready to take off all bubble wrap and ready to use!&lt;br /&gt;Melisa</li>
    <li> As a  hairdresser, I have been using both of these products for several years. This a great buy for both. Having chemical treated hair, this is one of the best products on the market.</li>
    <li> you will love your hair after using this</li>
    <li> When the package came  the conditioner cap was not sealed tight and it leaked and had a funky smell. I emailed the the site. They have not responded.</li>
    <li> I have used these products for over five years. Hands down the best. I can&#x27;t use anything else. I have thick, somewhat coarse, frizzy hair...this is the only line of products that delivers. And, these large bottles are GREAT!</li>
    <li> Very pricy, most good shampoo &amp; conditioners are. Both products will get your hair in healthy condition. Very good line</li>
    <li> Just perfect!  This shampoo and conditioner actually works.  I have slightly wavy fine hair and have had trouble with dry ends for years, and when I started using this last year my hair just got healthy, shiney and soft.  My stylist was amazed (but still tried to sell me her over priced small bottle of some other shampoo).  I&#x27;m loving my hair!!!!</li>
    <li> Very good product, wife swears by it.. thank god !!&lt;br /&gt;no more trying this one and that one... spent hundreds  to finally find the one that says what it does.</li>
    <li> This is the best shampoo/conditioner I have ever used in my life! The smell is fantastic and it leaves my hair so soft! I have color treated hair and it is especially good for that, but it is a great product in all realms. Its completely worth the price.</li>
    <li> always leaves hair feeling clean</li>
    <li> Great products and results.</li>
    <li> Love anything from Maroccan Oil. Great smell, too.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent product, both the shampoo and conditioner. Makes your hair very healthy and shiny.Revives dry hair, and gives it that beautiful luster.</li>
    <li> I fell in love with this product after using a friends in a pinch. Ive been a KeraCare junkie fore the past 5 years and NEVER once thought I&#x27;d leave them...until now. My hair is softer, holds curl longer, and is more manageable.</li>
    <li> My hairstylist suggested I purchase this product for my hair and it&#x27;s the best shampoo and conditioner I&#x27;ve ever used. My hair turns soft and manageable after using it and I don&#x27;t have the fuzziness I experience with other shampoos and conditioners. I purchased these large sizes and they have lasted for months and months. LOVE them and am getting ready to order more!</li>
    <li> I have been using these products for years, ever since my hair grew back after chemotherapy.  The texture of my hair changed and using my previous shampoo was like pouring cement on my head.  I know that sounds strange, but it was terrible.  This softens my hair as it cleans and gives me back the feel of my hair before chemo.  I was accustomed to having to change my hair products about every 6 months because of build up.  Since I started using Moroccan Oil, I have never experienced that buildup.  I really like the product and use most of the line.</li>
    <li> Absolutely the best shampoo I have ever tried and I chose it always over Redken and the others.  If you live in a humid climid this is the best for smoothing your hair.  I don&#x27;t have to flat iron any longer to keep the frizzies down.  My stylist says it&#x27;s nothing short of amazing how my hair has responded to this shampoo.  I have color and highlights and it&#x27;s completely safe for that.</li>
    <li> Now that I&#x27;ve found this shampoo, I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll ever be able to use anything else.  My hair has never been healthier and it smells luxurious!</li>
    <li> LOVE MY MOROCCAN OIL. Still using it and I purchased it in December of 2013. (only use once or twice a week, or special occasions) &#x3D;))</li>
    <li> This by far is one of the best shampoo i&#x27;ve ever had.... Normally every time i use another shampoo besides head and shoulders they always give me dandruff.... For the first time in so many years i&#x27;ve been looking for a shampoo n conditioner that will work with me i finally found one.... But the most important thing is this shampoo and conditioner makes my hair feels really soft and smells really good..... Worth the money</li>
    <li> Smells good and manageable hair.  Not sure worth the price, I love hair products and try lots of stuff.  It&#x27;s just okay.</li>
    <li> Fantastic I always had problems with shampoo until a friend told me about morrocanoil  my hair used to fall a lot each time I wash it  but now it is amazing I have a very sensible hair every wrong thing I use it loose shine starts to fall and is hard to fix again, now I have 2 years  using morrocan oil  the whole line of it and feels amazing don&#x27;t want to Chang any more recommend to every one it is really good.</li>
    <li> Love the product. Wish it was a bit cheaper though</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo and conditioner!</li>
    <li> the conditioner is not good, Shampoo is good</li>
    <li> Love this line of products and it shipped so quickly!</li>
    <li> love it. what a huge bargain for this product</li>
    <li> I have been using Moroccan Oil products for a couple years now, however just tried this shampoo and conditioner.  It&#x27;s amazing and totally worth the money.</li>
    <li> I love these products!  A must buy for dry or damaged hair.  These larger bottles are a really great value.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for 3 years and I love it.  It makes my hair look and feel great!</li>
    <li> Never would I ever have expected to be scammed over something like this, but I promise you this... The product I received is FAKE. I should have read the reviews prior to purchasing. I will never make that mistake again. I also should have known by the state of the bottles when I received them. It wasn&#x27;t until my hair lathered up into a big soap sud that I knew. Moroccanoil does not suds up!!!</li>
    <li> I typically do not leave reviews but felt I needed to leave this one. I have been using Moroccan Oil for a couple years and I have to agree with some of the other reviews. This is not the same cleanliness and smell. It seems maybe diluted and mixed with something else....bummed cuz buying this was a big splurge for myself</li>
    <li> Love these...would order again.</li>
    <li> This is the best shampoo/conditioner you can buy and this item specifically is the best price you’re going to find.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product is very mild and moisturizing. I use it in my beard as well. Also, with a Brazilian Blowout or any coloring, something like this with no sulfates is what you need.</li>
    <li> This is a nice shampoo and conditioner.  The first two times I used it, my hair felt like straw after shampooing (other reviewers mentioned this) but I have a friend that highly recommended for my hair.  I kept usiiing it and after the second time, the texture changed is the shampoo and my hair.  It may have been just getting old product out of my hair...not really sure.  I will say that it smells wonderful to me.  The con, the conditioner feels like it is working but it does not allow me to run a comb through my hair very easily while its in my hair and my last conditioner did.  I like the idea of combing through the conditioner since i have curly hair and don&#x27;t like to comb it &amp;#34;after I have towel dried it&amp;#34;.  It changes the curl.  I will see how I feel about it by the time I am through with the large bottles.  I may stay with it or I may try something else, mainly because I can&#x27;t run a comb through my hair with the conditioner (I actually have to careful detangle with the comb and it adds an extra few minutes to my shower that isn&#x27;t always welcomed in the morning.)  This product was delivered quickly and there was some slight leakage like other reviews mentioned, but minimal...happy with the seller.</li>
    <li> I have been using this set for two months and I definitely see a big difference in the health of my hair.  It is worth the money!</li>
    <li> Product was received on time and packaging was good. I am questioning if it is really what the bottle says though...Moroccan Oil is one of the few hair products that my skin does not react to, and I have had some pretty nasty breakouts throughout the use of this purchase. I would not purchase any Moroccan Oil product from any website other than their own or from an authorized salon, just to be safe.</li>
    <li> great product and great seller</li>
    <li> I have purchased this shampoo and conditioner before but they were not original.  These were the original, I love the way they smell and leave my hair soft and shiny.  &#x3D;)</li>
    <li> Great product, came as promised and much better deal than offered elsewhere.</li>
    <li> If you have thick curly hair this is the product for you! Very moisturizing and makes curls look natural and even helps with frizz. When I received the product there was slight damage to one of the bottles but the company, MoroccanKing, dealt with the issue very professionally. I would definatley purchase products from Moroccan king again!</li>
    <li> Love it and the price here makes it even better.</li>
    <li> Repeat order for the same product. I personally don&#x27;t use it, I have a shaved head. But all the women folks in the house use it, and the love it. Since I bought it.... I am the golden one. Good price. Fast delivery. Drama free ordering. What else do you want?</li>
    <li> Super fast shipping!  Item was exactly as described!</li>
    <li> I love these products they leave my hair feeling like silk.  I have dry curly hair and these products makes it easy to manage and straighten.</li>
    <li> Your hair will never look better, feel better, or smell better than when you use Moroccan Oil Shampoo and Conditioner.  This is absoulutely the best shampoo and conditioner.  My salon spa uses it exclusively.</li>
    <li> This shampoo should not be used if you have thin hair. It dries it out completely, and I would not recommend it.</li>
    <li> That&#x27;s the best product for hair ever!!! My hair looks smooth and soft! I loved it!!! Can&#x27;t stop using. I Super recommend.</li>
    <li> This stuff is AWESOME! I have thick, dark, long wavy hair. I used &amp;#34;Biolage&amp;#34; products for years. My beautician recommended that i start trying this stuff because my hair was limp, dull, and flat. My hair has never been so soft! It&#x27;s softer than my 11 year old niece&#x27;s hair!!! My boyfriend has never commented on the smell of my hair-until I started using this product. My hair is just so different. It&#x27;s like I have a completely new head of hair.</li>
    <li> This is a great shampoo and conditioner.  It makes my hair silky smooth and it smells so good.  I only need to use it every other day.  My mom also loves it. We have fine hair and it works well for us.&lt;br /&gt;I use the Moroccan oil after I condition my hair to make my hair extra smooth.&lt;br /&gt;I also I love the price of these value sizes.</li>
    <li> Love this product line</li>
    <li> I love it! Makes my hair so soft and managable. I also have dry and frizzy and it helps a little bit. There is no true product that will eliminate frizz. I dont look for that anymore I now look for shampoos that make myair soft and smelling good...love the smell! It is expensive, but Ionly wash my hair once a week so this will last for a long time.</li>
    <li> Love love love this! Makes my hair look and feel health.  I had a problem with my hair always falling out. Started using this and it came to a complete STOP!</li>
    <li> This is the best hair products I&#x27;ve ever used. Love it.</li>
    <li> These seemed to be a counterfeit product.</li>
    <li> I use the Moroccan Oil Shampoo &amp; Conditioner for quite a long time now.  Love the product.  In the salons you can only purchase the small 8 oz. bottles so I was excited to recieve my liter bottles.  I was never so disappointed.  In fact, I hated the product.  I shampooed my hair first in the shower and noticed that the smell was off.  Moroccan Oil has a distinct smell.  Well it wasn&#x27;t there.  Then I reached for the conditioner.  That&#x27;s when I knew I&#x27;ve been ripped off.  This conditioner actually made my hair fill dryer and more tangled as I worked it through.  Then the very next morning my husband used the products in the shower and yelled to me &amp;#34;Hey whats wrong with this conditioner.  It&#x27;s putting knots in my hair.  True story!  I hate what it did to my hair and my pocket.  First time to be ripped off on Amazon. :(</li>
    <li> great value and a great product...however, when I received it, both pumps were broken..... :(</li>
    <li> I bought the Moroccan Oil Shampoo/Conditioner set because I love the Treatment oil so I figured this would be great.  I hated it immediately.  The Conditioner made my hair feel super dry and it caused knots in my hair that were almost impossible to get out.  I have pretty thin hair but no other product that I have used has been this bad.  After a few days of using it, I noticed more and more hair coming out in the shower, handfuls.  The only positive I have for this product is that it smells ok.  Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> There is no better smelling shampoo and conditioner! The conditioner is moisturizing and perfect for my curly/ frizzy hair.  The shampoo is moisturizing too!</li>
    <li> Great product! Fast shipping!</li>
