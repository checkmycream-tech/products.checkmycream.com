      <li>and it is remarkable.  </li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s a good price for what it does.</li>
      <li>I think it&#x27;s good for the  complexion</li>
      <li>/&gt;However, it is great to use as a very light moisturizer.</li>
      <li>I love this spray!</li>
      <li>Just make sure you spray at a good distance or you will get splotches.</li>
      <li>It really does give you a beautiful glow over your makeup or even just spritzing it over your face without make up!</li>
      <li>To me it just kind of feels like glorified water.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s fantastic for that purpose and also works great as a refreshing hydrator.  </li>
      <li>I have to say I have been very impressed with this product so far.</li>
      <li>My one qualm about it is that it doesn&#x27;t exactly smell that great.</li>
      <li>and I love the feel after I spray.  </li>
      <li>but really it isn&#x27;t all that great either.    </li>
      <li>This product is one of my favorite skin hydrating formulas.  </li>
      <li>one of my favorite products.</li>
      <li>It does a very good job setting my makeup and making it last ALL DAY!</li>
      <li>Just know there is a really strong smell with this one.</li>
      <li>Fragrance too strong for me..</li>
      <li>spray it lightly on my face, then apply moisturizer with sunblock.  </li>
      <li>It is not as good as the old</li>
      <li>I so loved  the old formulation.  </li>
      <li>You should have kept the original.</li>
      <li>Its fresh feeling and smells light and clean.  </li>
      <li>Its good enough for after the shower or cleaning to keep you moist, but thats about it.</li>
      <li>It refreshing, but I don&#x27;t love the overall scent.</li>
      <li>Overall - Great product, great alternative to the more expensive setters.</li>
      <li>I like that it is more natural and does refresh your face.</li>
      <li>Marlena over at Makeupgeek recommended Aubry&#x27;s Organic Mineral Water as a great alternative to the more expensive makeup setters.     </li>
      <li>Have ordered several times from this company, and am satisfied with their product.</li>
      <li>I do find it fairly evenly lined with the more expensive products.</li>
      <li>It makes the moisturizer easy to spread, and saves on the amount of moisturizer necessary.</li>
      <li>So I really can&#x27;t compare it with another product</li>
      <li>my daily make up routine, nI lightly mist my face and</li>
      <li>I miss the old formulation of this and some of the shampoos and conditioners!!!  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t see a huge difference in how long my make up</li>
      <li>But it doesn&#x27;t keep my skin soft enough to clean blackheads away.  </li>
      <li>As far as buying it from Amazon - I have to say, I have found it cheaper at other websites but after shipping and handling is said and done Amazon still beats the other sites by a good $3-4.     </li>
      <li>It worked for me especially from the fridge on a hot day.  </li>
      <li>They still have the image of the old formula/bottle but they ship out the new formula in new packaging.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve noticed dermalogica toner after useage, keeps the skin soft enough to keep it clean while exfoliating and daily cleansing.  </li>
      <li>I like this product as a whole because i&#x27;m big into to all natural products for my face.</li>
      <li>gives your skin a natural, dewey and youthful look.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I tried it and walked out of the room and my 11 year old</li>
      <li>I use it on bare skin as well as to set makeup.  </li>
      <li>I have tried others that are a little less potent.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> one of my favorite products. I use it on face and hair. I think it&#x27;s good for the  complexion and it smells good!</li>
    <li> I found that when a label says \\&quot;sparkling\\&quot; that that is not always what the product it!  There is no sparkle in this spray.</li>
    <li> This product is very refreshing &amp; is perfect for travel.  I love this spray!</li>
    <li> This product is amzing.&lt;br /&gt;Apply my daily make up routine, nI lightly mist my face and the end result is amazing.&lt;br /&gt;It gives your skin a natural, dewey and youthful look.&lt;br /&gt;Almost flawless. I definitely recommend this for anyone who needs a spritz of freshness.&lt;br /&gt;As well as make up geeks. And you can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
    <li> I use this to set my makeup.  It&#x27;s fantastic for that purpose and also works great as a refreshing hydrator.  My husband says it smells like brown sugar.</li>
    <li> There is nothing wrong with this product. To me it just kind of feels like glorified water. I don&#x27;t see a huge difference in how long my make up lats.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, it is great to use as a very light moisturizer. I have oily skin, but sometimes it will feel a little \\&quot;tight\\&quot; or slightly dry, and this feels like it balances it out.</li>
    <li> The sparkling mineral water in fact does seem to freshen my makeup and I love the feel after I spray.  It makes me feel refreshed!</li>
    <li> Not the same stuff I used before. Will never buy again. You should have kept the original. This new stuff stinks. Went to a different brand. To bad too,as I had been a customer for many,many, years.  Diana</li>
    <li> I was looking all over the web for a product like this and found this and it is remarkable.  I will continue to buy this product for future orders!</li>
    <li> This product is one of my favorite skin hydrating formulas.  I use it on bare skin as well as to set makeup.  Use throughout the day to refresh your skin and makeup.  You don&#x27;t have to use a lot.  It is a very good value.</li>
    <li> I so loved  the old formulation.  It worked for me especially from the fridge on a hot day.  Now it has alcohol, glycerine as ingredients.  Fragrance too strong for me.. I miss the old formulation of this and some of the shampoos and conditioners!!!  NO LONGER A FAN</li>
    <li> I am not a big makeup person - so when I do put it on I want it to last. With that said I have used other products (Model in a Bottle, Mac&#x27;s Fix-it+ Spray) to set my make up. However, both of those tend to be a tad pricey. I didn&#x27;t want to shell out the money for another bottle of those and went in search for a similar product with a not so similar price tag. Marlena over at Makeupgeek recommended Aubry&#x27;s Organic Mineral Water as a great alternative to the more expensive makeup setters.     I have to say I have been very impressed with this product so far. It does a very good job setting my makeup and making it last ALL DAY! I do find it fairly evenly lined with the more expensive products. My one qualm about it is that it doesn&#x27;t exactly smell that great. It definitely doesn&#x27;t have the Fix-it Spray scent. It isn&#x27;t horrible but really it isn&#x27;t all that great either.    As far as buying it from Amazon - I have to say, I have found it cheaper at other websites but after shipping and handling is said and done Amazon still beats the other sites by a good $3-4.     Overall - Great product, great alternative to the more expensive setters. One drawback - scent. Still I would buy it again and will be using it again.</li>
    <li> I like this product as a whole because i&#x27;m big into to all natural products for my face. It refreshing, but I don&#x27;t love the overall scent. I have tried others that are a little less potent. Otherwise it&#x27;s serving it&#x27;s purpose.</li>
    <li> I got this to replace expensive dermalogica toners and expected it to work just as well.  It kinda doesn&#x27;t.  Its fresh feeling and smells light and clean.  But it doesn&#x27;t keep my skin soft enough to clean blackheads away.  I&#x27;ve noticed dermalogica toner after useage, keeps the skin soft enough to keep it clean while exfoliating and daily cleansing.  Its good enough for after the shower or cleaning to keep you moist, but thats about it.</li>
    <li> It really does give you a beautiful glow over your makeup or even just spritzing it over your face without make up! I recently got a tattoo and after it had time to heal I had began to spray this on it and it makes it look beautiful!</li>
    <li> I bought this when Makeup Geek recommended it. I like that it is more natural and does refresh your face. Just make sure you spray at a good distance or you will get splotches. This is the only spray I have tried. So I really can&#x27;t compare it with another product but it&#x27;s a good price for what it does.</li>
    <li> works just as it says it does. Makeup stays on all day and does not make the makeup smear. I like it alot.</li>
    <li> This company is always prompt in their mailing.  I use this complexion mist every day...spray it lightly on my face, then apply moisturizer with sunblock.  It makes the moisturizer easy to spread, and saves on the amount of moisturizer necessary. Have ordered several times from this company, and am satisfied with their product.</li>
    <li> They still have the image of the old formula/bottle but they ship out the new formula in new packaging. It is not as good as the old and I am so sad; I had used the old formula for close to 10 years or longer.</li>
    <li> I should have trusted the other reviews that discussed the smell of this.  I tried it and walked out of the room and my 11 year old actually asked me what the gross smell was.............It was my face.  I wont return it, not worth the shipping.  Just know there is a really strong smell with this one.</li>
