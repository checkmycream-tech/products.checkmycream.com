      <li>As most other products in this line Fioravanti smells heavenly.  </li>
      <li>This works well on wet or dry hair, but I think it works best on wet hair and then combed through.</li>
      <li>You don&#x27;t need to use much and it keeps your hair feeling clean, not gunky or dry.  </li>
      <li>I was a little skeptical but it works great on my hair that tangles easily.  </li>

      <li>I have very fine, thin hair</li>
      <li>I actually ordered a second bottle long before the first ran out, just in case I couldn&#x27;t find it again.</li>
      <li>I have thin blonde shoulder length hair and have tried MANY detanglers.  </li>
      <li>My 7 year old complained about the smell and it doesn&#x27;t help much with tangles to justify the price.</li>

<li> No more tears!</li>
<li> it&#x27;s not good.</li>
<li> Smell is.... Unpleasant</li>
<li> I hate my hair when I don&#x27;t use it.  </li>
<li> This spray smells horrible &amp; burns my eyes from the awful perfume smell it omits.</li>

I&#x27;m extremely unhappy at how much I paid for it to find out it&#x27;s not good. Hoping I help save someone else from the same mistake. And to think I was going to use it on the kids. Ugh!</li>

    <li> Best detangling spray for my colored hair. Helps put a shine on dull hair.</li>
    <li> This is my go-to for tangled hair...which I have A LOT of. My hair is very thin and long, and is always getting tangled. This works well on wet or dry hair, but I think it works best on wet hair and then combed through. Lasts a long time, and I use it everyday.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for at least 5 years.  I hate my hair when I don&#x27;t use it.  It de-tangles and adds some body.  I have fine thinning hair.  It also adds great shine.  Love it!</li>
    <li> This is the detangling conditioner that goes with the volumizing shampoo.  Great product.  Works superb.  Clean smell.  No residue.</li>
    <li> If you have difficulty with tangled hair, this product is the solution.  I have fine hair that gets tangled and breaks, but this product has fixed that.</li>
    <li> It was a good product but was pricey for the length of time it lasted.&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t use it too often, but I still managed to go through it quickly since I have long and thick hair.</li>

    <li> Excellent detangler.  Not thick, not sticky, just right.  Good for fine hair.,  Will re-order.</li>
    <li> Hands down the best detangling spray I have ever purchased. In fact, I have gone through more than ten bottles in seven years. Obviously it works or I wouldn&#x27;t keep purchasing it.</li>
    <li> I like using this while fixing my hair which is curly.  As soon as it is applied my hair becomes much easier to comb and the scent of the product is not overwhelming at all. You don&#x27;t need a lot of it either..a little goes a long way&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My purchase was quick and easy and I am please</li>
    <li> Really good product and performs as stated.  I was a little skeptical but it works great on my hair that tangles easily.  You don&#x27;t need to use much and it keeps your hair feeling clean, not gunky or dry.  I will keep using this product.</li>
    <li> I really love this product for my long, fine hair. Wonderful detangler, leaves my hair silky and shiny.</li>
    <li> I have been using this detangler for years. Smells so good, is light so you don&#x27;t feel like there is a film on your hair and I have been complimented many times on how shiny my hair looks - which I think has something to do with this product.</li>
    <li> Furterer saved my hair.  Started changing perimenopause and was frantic as i always had good hair.  Furterer brought back my&lt;br /&gt;old hair!  Love it</li>
    <li> Smell is.... Unpleasant</li>
    <li> I have thin blonde shoulder length hair and have tried MANY detanglers.  Walgreen&#x27;s loves me.  Well, maybe not since I found this product since this is all I buy now.  It detangles my hair and doesn&#x27;t weigh it down or make it sticky.  It&#x27;s is just perfect and I order multiple bottles at one time so I never run out.  On a side note, I also purchased their Volumea shampoo and conditioner and leave-in spray on conditioner.  They are excellent as well.  My husband is really impressed with how good my hair looks now.</li>
    <li> Marginal product, small bottle, high price.  Not much else to say.</li>
    <li> The best treatment I&#x27;ve found on the market.....Detangler,Shine, Conditioner...I recieved it as a gift &amp; now I can&#x27;t live without it....</li>
