      <li>I opted for the gel here and wasn&#x27;t anticipating loving the lotion, but I have been using this for a year now and don&#x27;t think I will ever change.</li>
      <li>It is handy to have both products in one container.</li>
      <li>The gel feels nice on your eyelid and the lotion feels nice on your undereyes.</li>
      <li>This product works very good, specially when I don&#x27;t sleep for many hrs</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Fast shipping and exactly what I wanted.</li>
    <li> I feel like this product does improve my skin.</li>
    <li> I notice no difference while using this. I&#x27;m almost finished with the jar, and see no difference compared to any other eye cream I use.</li>
    <li> Will not reorder. The product may work for some but it clogged the pours on my eyelids, I had bumps that needed to be expressed.</li>
    <li> I have been using this since 2005, and will NOT stop!</li>
    <li> After a week of using it , it really works!  Can&#x27;t live without it. My eye lids are tight. That is what I bought it for. Don&#x27;t use the under eye cream too often.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t understand why Avon discontinued selling it .  I would recommend it to anyone of a &amp;#34;senior status&amp;#34; as well.</li>
    <li> I used this cream and gel set consistently for about six weeks.  I did not notice an improvement in the appearance of the under eye or the eye lid either day by day or as a long-term change. I would have hoped to see even a subtle improvement but I did not. Purchased based on positive reviews here on amazon and elsewhere, I&#x27;m surprised by my lack of results. Could all those reviews be by Avon reps?!</li>
    <li> There is a noticeable difference right away!</li>
    <li> I have used it for years! It works great and is great for people that are allergic to a lot of eye products. It is one of the few eye moisturizers I can use without a reaction.</li>
    <li> I just ordered 2 avon anew clinical eye lift cream a couple of days ago.  Thank you to the seller for shipping it so fast.  I received it today.  I have been using this cream for quite awhile.  Compared to other brands of eye creams, there is no comparison.  Great.</li>
    <li> This is pretty good stuff. It has a temporary effect and, with that being said, I was happy with the product. I will reorder but mainly because nothing else I&#x27;ve found works as well. I used to use another product but it seems it was discontinued, at least I can&#x27;t find it anywhere. So, in comparison with the one I used to use and this one, this one comes in second.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for over a year and I am very pleased with the results.  It is very cost effective as a little goes a long way (1 jar lasted close to a year and I use it daily).  Crows feet have disappeared along with the puffiness under my eyes.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product since the beginning of September, so for nearly 2.5 months now, every day. A little of it goes a long way. I do like the under eye moisturizer, and I think it did make a small difference in helping with fine lines, but I can&#x27;t tell that the upper eye gel did anything at all. I am older, and have developed bags beneath my eyes and some darkening. The moisturizer actually feels better than it works. My under eye area can become very dry and irritated, and the cream was soothing. I can&#x27;t tell that it addressed the bags under my eyes at all, but my under eye area does seem a little brighter. Now that I&#x27;m out of this product, I&#x27;ve ordered a different one that is less expensive. If I did order this again, I wouldn&#x27;t order this exact product, but would order the under eye cream only. It does smooth fine lines, and it feels very good.</li>
    <li> I have been looking for a good eye cream for my upper and lower eye areas for a long time I feel I have found it with this combo. Good product and worth the money.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product since April 2010, which was when I started to notice a pouchy bit of skin on my upper eyelids and crepiness as well. I&#x27;m a part-time makeup artist so I spend a lot of time on eye makeup and examing that area of my face. :) This was also the month before my wedding and I wanted my makeup to look flawless. I had heard of this cream a couple of years before from a former co-worker, so I decided to try it out. After about 3 1/2 weeks, I definitely noticed a dfference! No more pouchy skin and my upper eye area looked lifted and lids were smooth. With continued use, the lower eye area is also relatively smooth, and I do not have any crows feet or lines in that area under my eyes! I literally buy this product 2 jars at a time, as I do not EVER want to run out. A little goes a long way, so if it&#x27;s running into your eyes, you&#x27;ve applied too much. Always use your ring finger to apply gently to the eye area. I cannot believe this bargain price! I tried to order from my regular Avon Rep&#x27;s web site, but it&#x27;s apparently out of stock and seems to be they are possible re-formulating it and preparing to re-introduce it? Hopefully, they are only improving the forumula because if it is changed to where it does not work as well any longer, I will be devastated! Don&#x27;t want to have to resort to plastic surgery....I am 55 years old and always get compliments on my youthfull looking eyes.</li>
    <li> THIS IS AN EXCELLENT EYE PRODUCT, SECOND-FAVORITE ONLY TO THE OLD &amp;#34;SOLUTIONS&amp;#34; EYE GEL, WHICH I STILL THINK IS THE BEST PRODUCT ON THE MARKET, AND I&#x27;M MAD AT AVON FOR DISCONTINUING IT.  THIS CREAM/GEL COMBO WORKS VERY WELL--DEFINITELY PRICIER, OF COURSE.  FANCY PACKAGING, BUT I DO LIKE IT.</li>
    <li> wonderful  soon another</li>
    <li> So far not quite sure if this product has really anything for my eyes.  Does feel soothing when applied though.</li>
    <li> It seems that if you have tried one of these products you have tried them all. Nothing special about this one.</li>
    <li> Regrettably this didn&#x27;t work well for me. I used it up for the sake of finishing the product.</li>
    <li> Delivery excellent.  Product is amazing.</li>
    <li> Arrived on time.Was great as usual!</li>
    <li> It does the job and the price is great.  I am a little disappointed in the eye gel.  It does not work as well on puffiness as it should.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this cream for 2 weeks, so I&#x27;ll use it until it&#x27;s gone and update this review if I see a miracle happening, but so far nothing.  This cream doesn&#x27;t bother your eyes, so it is good if you have sensitive eyes and are looking for a decent moisturizer.  Other than that, it doesn&#x27;t do anything in terms of lifting sagging lids.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t see any effects or changes on the eyes but the under eye cream is pretty nice. Been using for more than a week and no real results</li>
    <li> Have used this for years, and have always been told I look at least 15 years younger than I am.  Avon age products are the best and have great prices.</li>
    <li> So far I have noticed that I have less puffy yes and it feels smoother around my eyes. I however have not seen any improvement in dark circles. make up goes over this product well.  I have VERY sensitive area around my eyes had allergic reactions to 3 other products, this one no signs of that issue and have been using it for about two weeks.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a great product I have used it for a long time. The jar last a long time.&lt;br /&gt;In came on time</li>
    <li> I have been using this for years now and can&#x27;t go without it.  It really helps to live the eyelids.</li>
    <li> Been using it for years and won&#x27;t buy anything else. Kind to eyes and no wrinkles- even better. Super product.</li>
    <li> What a great price! This is my favorite under/over eye cream. Use it and you will love the results. Very happy with the Avon Anew Clinical Eye life Dual Eye System and would recommend it. This product works.</li>
    <li> This may not be a problem for anyone else, but the orange gel stings the top of my eyelids, so I can&#x27;t use it.  The white cream for under the eye is pleasant - no reaction to it - but I don&#x27;t know that I see any appreciable difference when I do or do not use it.</li>
    <li> I can not use it everyday because I have sensitive skin but works good when I do use it.</li>
    <li> The gel ( eye lift side) did nothing for me. The cream was ok, but did not lighten my dark circles or change them at all.</li>
    <li> Considerably cheaper than Dermasilk, also noticeably less effective. Doesnt lift like Dermasilk&#x27;s and did nothing to the undereye area. vitamin a and coconut oil worked better.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff; I&#x27;ve been using it for years</li>
    <li> I love this stuff and was very happy to find that I could get it for a much better price on Amazon than from Avon.</li>
    <li> I love this product because it really works. The price is right and I can see the progress ! Amazing!</li>
    <li> I have used this cream for many years and still will continue to use it because it is a very good product and works!</li>
    <li> Avon always makes good beauty products like soaps, washes, etc. This does not fall far from the tree. it&#x27;s also affordable, which is great!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this almost daily since I received it and though the gel seems to be working on my upper eyes, the cream for the bottom is still taking its time to work.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for over a week and it has smoothed out the fine lines around my eyes and toned down the dark circles that I sometimes get from not getting enough rest.  At half the regular price, I would highly recommend and will be purchasing again.</li>
    <li> Under eye cream has really made a big difference for me.  Had laser performed under my eyes and went to deep.  this has filled in and evened out that area.  Cannot tell it was uneven now.  Love it.</li>
    <li> My wife has been using this eye cream, she is usually not a fan of Avon products, but she feels this one is of good quality and is decreasing the bag underneath her eyes.</li>
    <li> This did not work for me very much so I gave up on tne cream.  It my work for another person.</li>
    <li> Best product so far for price. Gets rid of swollen eye lids in a week. Jar contents lasts for few months.</li>
    <li> I gave it a 5 star rating because  I was pleased with every aspect of it. 1. Bargain price 2Fast shipping 3Excellant condition 4.New, sealed container, I think it&#x27;s great!</li>
    <li> I have used this eye lift system before and decided to try the new Philosophy dual lift system when it came out, only to return to the more effective (and much cheaper!) Avon product. The serum for your lids really does help restore elasticity and actually improved my eyelashes too! The under eye cream is rich without being greasy and definitely improved my dark circles and puffiness. I am sticking with this stuff because it works!</li>
    <li> I have horrid bags and while its not miracle cream it does lessen them quite a bit. It took near a month to get results.I love Avons products.I recently shyed away and went for a well known expensive company and Avon works better!</li>
    <li> I am 51 years young had damage done to my face that requied reconstructive sugurey so I have premature lines. This is great noticed the difference after 1st application that I use it in the day before I use mineral powder and apply make up was told I look ten yrs younger. Just be gentle when applying make up, I love this and highly recommend it gives u a well rested look aka younger look</li>
    <li> This product did seem to lift my saggy eye lid some.  Overall it is a decent product that smells nice, is light in texture, and absorbs quickly.</li>
    <li> Sudden change eye lift worked much better for me. I expected more out of this product considering the other reviews, but unfortunately it did nothing for me.</li>
    <li> Saw a difference in my eyelids in 1-2 weeks. Don&#x27;t really need the under eye cream, but I use it at night.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok, but too cumbersome for me to apply. I can&#x27;t tell a difference what the 2 separate creams/gels are supposed to do.  I prefer an overall eye cream that can be gently applied to the entire / upper and lower eye area.&lt;br /&gt;Neutrogena as well as L&#x27;oreal have very good products and are probably a little more reasonable.</li>
    <li> I have bought several Avon products thru Amazon that I could rave about however this is not one of them. I&#x27;ve been using it for a few weeks and see no change.</li>
    <li> I am almost in disbelief but after just a few uses of the gel on my upper eyelids I no longer have hooded eyelids. I am 48. As for the cream its too soon to tell.</li>
    <li> The gel for the upper eyelid is fantastic.  I immediately saw a lift effect and have a wide-eyed look from a few years ago.  The under eye cream is not amazing, but I will continue to use it and see if it takes a few weeks to kick in.</li>
    <li> Have used this for a while and it does lift the upper lids and smooth below the eye, lasts quite a while too as you use sparingly.Much cheaper on Amazon than thru Avon.</li>
    <li> This maybe my first purchase from Amazon but I have tried this product via Avon and it is the real deal.&lt;br /&gt;If you use it on a daily basis you will see the different well worth the purchase.</li>
    <li> Got it on time however when I opened it, the container was only half full on each side!! I hadn&#x27;t ordered it used or if I had, I wasn&#x27;t notified about it.  I enjoy the product, just may not buy from this seller again.</li>
    <li> I am  not into Avon products but decided to try this one. It seems to work so far. It is soft and not messy. You can see results right away.</li>
    <li> The wife says: This the only thing I need for my eyes. Have been using it for years. It almost instantly lifts my upper eyes &amp; has significantly reduced the my crow&#x27;s feet. I&#x27;m 59,I can&#x27;t tell you how good that makes me feel. I know it&#x27;s not just the Eye Lift but it definitely helps! Will use this until they stop making it, which, I have a feeling, won&#x27;t ever happen. Great price too.</li>
    <li> So far so good! My eyes feel more awake I like the cooling gel this bottle will last awhile! love the great value too!</li>
    <li> Fast shipping. When I opened the box (which was well sealed) and took off the lid to the cream the contents were mixed a bit. I like the moisture it provides, but have not noticed any eye lift action. Been using daily for about a month. But I don&#x27;t expect miracles with these creams and appreciate the benefit I do get from them which is depuffing and moisture. That said, I think it is okay and would buy again.</li>
    <li> I use to buy this product from an Avon representative at work but it was expensive! I checked online and BAM, way cheaper! This product does work and it makes a difference on my tired eyes. I believe it was rated as a top beauty product for eye care. Good stuff!</li>
    <li> seriously I noticed a difference the first time I used this. upper lid gel feels wonderful and reduced puffy eyelids dramatically. avon has made a believer out of me!!!</li>
    <li> Feels great, no scent, but don&#x27;t expect to see any changes in your skin. I&#x27;m 29 and just trying to combat some fine lines and sagginess...it&#x27;s a good moisturizer, but doesn&#x27;t do anything different than if I just put some other type of moisturizer on my eyes. Waste of money if you ask me.</li>
    <li> I have to admit that I have been a cosmetics snob for the last thirty some years, only using Sisley and LaMer.  I poo-pooed Avon.  My bad, as this product did what no others were successful in doing:  Minimizing---almost erasing---the crepiness the sagging of my brow bone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The sagging was getting so bad that it was beginning to obstruct my vision and I was seriously considering some sort of procedure to correct it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After trolling reviews, I decided to give this product a try; the cost was minimal, so why not, right?  I am thrilled that I did.  Not only is the crepey skin diminished by about 85%,but the skin&#x27;s support structure is amazing!!!  My eyes are wide, open, and not sagging at all....and wonderfully hydrated too!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very frugal with my praises for products; I am a harsh critic. But I have to give this product 5 Stars and beyond---the change is that dramatic.  I have not ever experienced the kind of dramatic effects with my old products, not for the brow area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now I realize that everyone&#x27;s skin is different and each person will get a different degree of benefit, but for me this was a miracle.  I would recommend giving it a try and committing to using it for a full month.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good luck and I hope this review was helpful.</li>
    <li> Does exactly what it says.</li>
    <li> i love this stuff. i have bad allergies and puffiness and this works everytime. its a great value for the place and i highly recommend. i have very sensitive / combination and this works for me.</li>
    <li> this product is amazing. I alreat see a difference.  I had one pretty droppy eyelid.. and it is rapidly improving</li>
    <li> I bought this product mostly for the upper lid. It works I guess but not revolutionary or anything. The under eye cream doesn&#x27;t do much. The design of the upper lid product makes it difficult to get out of the corners (you can see it is crescent shaped). I won&#x27;t buy this again.</li>
    <li> I bought same product from Avon lady at twic the price.  This cream has two weights, for upper vs lower under eye.  Takes eyeshadow nicely.</li>
    <li> PERFECT &amp; FAST SERVICE</li>
    <li> I actually feel this product firming my skin especially the upper eye lid.. It doesn&#x27;t effect other make up that goes on after this product.. I would buy this again.</li>
    <li> Not sure if I am allergic to something in the cream but it caused my eyes to itch horribly. My eyes were blood shot red from all the rubbing and scratching. I waited a week and tried again and had the same results.  Not sure why because I first tried this cream from avon at my moms house and didn&#x27;t have any bad side effects.</li>
    <li> This product goes on smoothly and moisturizes the skin around my eyes. I always have problems being allergic to lotions, makeup etc, that I put on my eyelids but this has given me no problems.</li>
    <li> I have used this for quite some time.  I like putting the colored cream on the eyelid and brow area as well, keeps them more youthful.&lt;br /&gt;The whiter cream goes under the eye assisting with dark circles, or tired eyes.  .</li>
    <li> I was told about this product by a friend who swears by it. I was pleasantly surprised. It is a quarter of the price of the expensive eye creams and I personally have better results! Never used much Avon, but this is something I will keep using and keep buying!</li>
    <li> the product is very sensitive to getting old and losing its concentration, shelf life do not last long, susceptible dehydration</li>
    <li> This is an excellent eye dual eye cream and gel. So far I have found nothing better in this price range.</li>
    <li> This product made my eyes break out and I wanted to return it, but couldn&#x27;t. Not happy.</li>
    <li> I have seen such a difference in my eyes, I would recommend this to others. Anew is great.  Thank you</li>
    <li> I like this eye cream except the cream part was almost half empty when I received it.  The eye cream arrived in a box with plastic wrapping so I assume it was Avon and not the seller.</li>
    <li> This works pretty good have to see if it really works after all used up so far so good</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m sure this works fine but the skin around my eyes burned and itched something terrible.  I can&#x27;t use it.</li>
    <li> My eyes react to everything and easily turn red, but not with this product.  It is very comfortable and the area around my eyes looks well moisturized.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a couple of weeks now.  I have not noticed any tightening of the skin or lightening of the circles under my eyes, but it is a really good moisturizer &amp; doesn&#x27;t irritate my eyes at all (I&#x27;ve had problems with other products).  So, I would give it 5 stars as a moisturizer, but 1 star for it&#x27;s other claims--it all depends on what you are purchasing it for.  ~Amy</li>
    <li> I have been using this eye cream for 3 years. The upper eyelid got lifted as described by this product. At least I do not see any drooping of the skin of the eye area, which is thinner and more delicate.</li>
    <li> Ok ladies, I am only posting this because, just like you, I was once looking for a remedy to my &amp;#34;worn out&amp;#34; look. I&#x27;m a college student and also work and so I wanted something to make me look a bit rejuvenated. I tried it only for 2 weeks straight. I saw nothing. The cream does have a tingle to it. Idk what it could be but it&#x27;s not effective. I did try to catch more sleep during my summer finally and that&#x27;s the only thing that has helped thus far.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this eye cream for about 3years now and i love it!!! I have sensitive eyes and was having a hard time finding an eye cream that didnt burn or was to oily. This has fix the issues i had with the skin around my eyes! It moisturizes very well ( at least it works for me perfectly)!</li>
    <li> My favorite eye cream.</li>
    <li> The de-puff cream under eyes has not worked yet.  The gel may be working a tiny bit for lift at times, but this is questionable</li>
    <li> Excellent product.   I have used the Avon Clinical Eye Lift for many years and find that with consistent use the product works well.    I am 53 years old.</li>
    <li> Well, although I don&#x27;t understand the different effects of the 2 type of eye gel/cream for upper and lower eye respectively, I&#x27;ll say it is never a bad choice for its price. :)</li>
    <li> My favorite. Works fast, cool and soothing.</li>
    <li> eyes look much better, less puffy ad brighter skin.</li>
    <li> Using this its a great product looks like its working will keep using feels good on the eyes and makes the skin smooth</li>
    <li> Eye creams are are sort of my passion.  Our eyes sometimes tell us our age.  I got this as a sample in the beginning and didn&#x27;t think much of it. It was in a packet , I tried it and thought no big deal. The trick is consistency then I sold it to a customer of mine and I got an extra one for myself.  I like the container better than the sample (which is opposite usually samples are better than when you get the product it&#x27;s not always as good as the sample).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I put this eye cream dual next to my computer since I work with the computer daily on my desk, so it&#x27;s easy for me to reach for.  First day i tried it no big deal, next day i put it no big deal , felt refreshed though, but as i kept being consistent with it I NOTICED MY EYES FELT refreshed, and better firmer and not too puffy. That top gel really does help my lids not to feel droopy! I paired it up with Visine eye drops (so that the white in my eyes don&#x27;t look bloodshot).  There was one day i didn&#x27;t get to use it and that&#x27;s when I felt like I was missing it. So now it&#x27;s my favorite product.  It does work!.  I put the top gel on the brow bone &amp; eye lid and the cream under eyes. Some of us just put cream under eyes but we also need it on the LIDS TOO!! TO LIFT SO IT HELPS.  It made my eyes feel \\&quot;refreshed\\&quot; firmer and more confident to go out especially with the strain of being on the computer everyday. I like to see results quick too, you may not see it first day but as you become consistent it will be your new best friend! Like a glass of water. I panic now when I don&#x27;t have it , or if i have a new date and i need to make a good impression.  Truly! It&#x27;s an addition to your normal skin care. I used the avon reversalist eye cream didn&#x27;t see much difference but I do like the avon ultimate eye cream 7 s IT&#x27;S MORE of my night cream. So it&#x27;s a matter of skin type and taste.  This to me is a universal eye cream that works to enhance. It&#x27;s a feel good  dual system gel and cream to make your eyes feel lifted. Myfriend tried the expensive eye creams but she ended up buying more of this . I could tell she also wasn&#x27;t a fan at first then when she started using it CONSISTENTLY SHE was missing it too and fell in love. So the key here is. Use it consistently. I saw a difference in about 2 1/2 weeks. I don&#x27;t air that out easily.  I make sure when i say something I mean it because my reputation is on the line. Use it consistently have it by your night stand or wherever you sit down. even when i&#x27;m bored i put it on the top and bottom and My eyes feel so much better now. It&#x27;s like working out you may not see it first day but after few days of using this you will see a difference in how your eyes feel, the crepiness, the lids don&#x27;t droop as much the bottom seems smoother, and its more fun to put make up on and sometimes i don&#x27;t even need to wear a concealer anymore but it does help.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I felt so happy that I stuck with the product  . This Clinical Dual eye lift is great for everyday. It&#x27;s like a pick me up boost for your eyes. You may not notice it first day but I noticed it after \\&quot;consistent use\\&quot; I started looking for it before I put my eye make up or if I have a date I put it on religiously and when I go out I get a lot of compliments. It makes my eye make up even better. It&#x27;s part of my beauty bag. I&#x27;m so conscious about my eyes and a lot of men told me I&#x27;m beautiful  I didn&#x27;t use to get those compliments. The compliments I used to get  before were \\&quot;you look beautifu but you look so tired\\&quot; I hated that. Now I get compliments saying \\&quot;You&#x27;re beautiful &amp; I like how you have your eyes done (even after a day of crying during a drama movie) I put it on and I still looked better. ! my new ADDICTION THIS CLINICAL EYE LIFT DUO.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really like this product and I&#x27;m going to put some on again after typing this review.  1) helps with upper eye lid by not feeling so droopy, 2) bottom smooths out the crows feet ofthe sensitive under eye. DUO IS GOOD IT ADDRESSES BOTH OVER ANDUNDER AND it&#x27;s good everyday put it in your purse or next computer.  I also was concerned about dark circles. This product is more on the lifting and firming because the texture changed thus the dark circles don&#x27;t seem so prominent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I suggest vitamin k around for for dark circles and I suggest clinical eye duo as your EVERYDAY GO TO EYE CREAM it will be your favorite because later when you run out you &#x27;ll know what you&#x27;re missing. :-)</li>
    <li> 1st time try this eye system, its suprisingly work well, (i had been using &#x27;Avon Solutions Plus+ Total Radiance Eye Gel &#x27; to reduce my under eyes bags for years, and it work great), I was suprised to see this Dual eyes system cream work just as well! feel great on my upper eyes lid with  this upper eyes gel of dual system&lt;br /&gt;and the under cream work great on my under eyes bags also.I used very tiny amount of the creams, I used it only at nite before bed, and use the Avon Solutions Plus+ Total Radiance Eye Gel &#x27; during the day. this seller price is cheaper than avon.com, and because of the cheaper price of this seller is the only reason i try it. Thanks!</li>
    <li> I chose a rating of 5 stars because I have spent a small fortune on eye products and this one is the best.  I used to use this years ago and with all the hype on eye products I got sidelined.  I am so happy to have looked on your Health &amp; Beauty area and found it.  The delivery was efficient which it always is.  I received it just in time to take my puffs away so I could go to dinner with my highschool friends.</li>
    <li> Been using this product for about 5 years.  Have been pleased with its performance and will continue to use it as long as it remains available.</li>
    <li> I did and didn&#x27;t mean my expectations I love the product but I ordered 2 and got billed for 2 but only received 1</li>
    <li> Been using this product for many years and will not try anything else.  Glad I can find it cheaper than Avon sells.  I ordered and got it within 3 days.  Thanks so much for quick service!!</li>
    <li> This is the best eye cream for the money.  Works well without being greasy.</li>
    <li> I have used product as directed for two weeks no real difference would not purchase again in draw with all others that were a disappointment</li>
    <li> I use and love the Anew Reversalist Illuminating eye cream; it replaced my beloved Olay Pro X. Only the Shiseido eye cream has ever worked comparably to the Anew eye cream for me. I see results very quickly and notice a difference if I switch to something else!&lt;br /&gt;I once paid $65 for a Lancome eye cream and it went right back to the store. How can a $65 eye cream NOT perform even remotely as well as the inexpensive Anew products? Well, that&#x27;s just the way it is. Money doesn&#x27;t always buy better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I switched from the Reversalist to the Anew Duo, and hated the Duo. In fact I gave my extra jars away (it was a rep promo for several jars when it first came out)&lt;br /&gt;My main complaint is that the two-tiered system is annoying; I also felt like the gel ran into my eyes. I had a lot of eye irritation when using the Duo and I didn&#x27;t use too much. It is what it is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you only have the money to buy one eye product, try the Anew Reversalist Illuminating. You can use it day and night, it doesn&#x27;t run into your eyes, IT ACTUALLY GIVES YOU RESULTS YOU CAN SEE, and it has a built in primer for daytime use.</li>
    <li> I really like this product.  I use it every morning.  The only problem I have with it, is when I opened it up to use it, it was only 1/2 full and not filled up to the top like the picture. (Even when I order directly through Avon, its filled up more than that.)  It&#x27;s almost like someone used it, they returned it, and they just repackaged it.  I realize I got it for a better price then the Avon book, but still, the product should be filled to the top for the price!  Oh, and the cream seemed a little darker than normal.</li>
    <li> I was so happy to find a product that I felt comfortable using on the upper lid area as well as under the eyes. I love the refreshing feeling the Anew Eye Lift System gives to my eyes. It lasts quite a while as well because a litlle goes a long way.</li>
    <li> This product is very gentle on my eyes, which hasn&#x27;t been the case with all the eye creams I have tried. I love the separation of treatment for upper and lower eyes.  After my second bottle, the one complaint I have is the gel for the upper eyelid always runs out way before the cream for the lower eye does.  Is there any way to order a refil of just the gel?  Without this issue, it would be an ideal eye product.</li>
    <li> Opened new package. Looked like it had been sitting on the shelf a long time.  Did not look fresh and new.</li>
    <li> Best eye cream I have found.  Not perfect, but almost.</li>
    <li> Easy shopping. Have been well satisfied with the results and experience.</li>
    <li> I noticed a pleasant difference with in a few days. The crows feet &amp; fine lines were significantly softened and reduced and my brow area was actually tightened and lifted. I was very pleased with this product and will continue to purchase it.</li>
    <li> started using it as soon as i got it in the mail and it works great, got results in a week. couldnt believe it. i got this product because my upper eye lids started sagging (idk why, i think maybe from waxing my eyebrows too much) im only 23 yrs old. my problem is solved and the lines around eyes are gone. the only con i would say about this product is that its a little greasy for summertime but moisturizing for colder seasons. a little goes a long way and use every day, youll see results!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a couple of months and although I see no reduction in eye puffiness, I do notice less crepiness and slightly reduced wrinkles and crows feet. It&#x27;s not a miracle by any means and I would not spend the regular $32 price on it, but for the reduced price, it does help more than other similarly priced products on the market.</li>
    <li> Feels good going on and my eyes look refreshed in morning (on nights I get more than 5 hours sleep). It is a little difficult getting your finger into the jar due to the split sections and I imagine as i get towards bottom I may have to use a Q-tip to get remainder of cream out.  Only 4 stars because after 2 weeks I have not seen any significant changes in wrinkles or dark area under eyes...will update later on!</li>
    <li> The eye lid cream is a little bit thick, so it&#x27;s hard to put make up on afterwards because the makeup flakes off. But otherwise, I really like the cream combo, especially at night. I will likely repurchase.</li>
    <li> I was kind of disappointed in the size of this for the price. It was a little bit greasy as well, and I haven&#x27;t been able to tell if it&#x27;s actually made any improvement around my eyes. It smells good, and it does seem to at least moisturize around my eyes without making my eyes burn.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s said that as we get older, we become wiser.  Alas, we also get more wrinkles.  I&#x27;ve tried numerous eye creams to lubricate my eyelids and the wrinkles at the corner of my eyes.  They&#x27;ve all been either too heavy for the lids or too light for the wrinkles.  Avon&#x27;s Anew dual eye system is perfect for my skin, as the gel is light and soothing to my eyelids, and the cream has not only reduced the lines at the corner of my eyes and middle of my brow, but it also reduces the puffiness under my eyes.  A little goes a long way - this is simply a super product!</li>
    <li> This is the only eye area treatment at a reasonable price that seems to work.  While it doesn&#x27;t erase all age-related concerns, it does help both under the eye and eyelid sagging better than some of the more costly treatments I have tried.  The price on Amazon is great!!</li>
    <li> This eye cream is the best. I absolutely love it! Worth every penny!</li>
    <li> Item was delivered on time, one of the best eye creams that is Oprah suggested, product is exactly like the same as when I ordered directly from Avon, and price is awesome.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t appreciate how well this product worked until I stopped using it. This summer I was really good about applying this stuff daily. My skin looked better than usual, but I thought that was because I was temporarily living in California where the air is dryer and I was generally a bit healthier. I have since returned to my normal, cluttered life and dropped the ball on my skincare routine. Holy bags and dark circles! This stuff really did make me look younger. I started using it again and sure enough, big improvement.</li>
    <li> Really smooths our eyes.</li>
    <li> Product came fast been using it just don&#x27;t see no difference around my eyes this product isn&#x27;t for me i guess</li>
    <li> I had high hopes for this product, but after a few uses I had red itchy patches all around my eyes. At first I wasn&#x27;t sure what was causing it because I had added a few new products into my skin routine. I cut out the Avon Anew Clinical Eye Lift Pro Dual Eye System and the red itchy skin ceased immediately. I was really hoping to find something for my dark circles but alas this is not it.</li>
    <li> I was using active C eyes my La Roche Posay prior to this for a couple years. I thought I&#x27;d try something different to see if there&#x27;s any improvement. Thus far after a couple weeks I don&#x27;t see much difference, but I will continue until its empty and perhaps move onto something more medical grade. If I&#x27;m going to spend $$ on beauty products I like for them to be effective or have noticeable improvements.</li>
    <li> This cream makes my eyes tighter and my circles less noticeable . I have tried other eye creams with no results and have decided I can&#x27;t be with out this cream.</li>
    <li> I have used this eyes cream for many years and have tray other cream but always come back to this, IS THE BEST!</li>
    <li> I bought the Anew retexturing peel and loved it so thought I would try this eye treatment. The day after I used the Gel on my upper lid (under brow) I woke up with both my eyelids  swollen. They stayed red and swollen for several days. I tried a little of the under eye cream to see if I could just use that one but next day my eyes were red and itching. Be careful if your eyes are sensitive! If you try it, do a small test first! I made the mistake of smearing the gel under both brows and going to bed.</li>
    <li> I can really feel the upper lid firming up after application. Only complaint is that when applying makeup after this cream it tends to roll off in pills and the &#x27;lift&#x27; does not seem to last throughout the day.</li>
    <li> This product is affordable and works well to diminish under eye circles and puffiness.  The orange gel-like substance helps to dispel drooping, crepiness under the brow.</li>
    <li> The gel for the upper lids lifts them and makes them look more plump. The cream for the undereye absorbs easily completing the look for a more rested eye.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve being using this for 2 weeks so far and nothing yet...I will continue to use to see if I get any results</li>
    <li> This eye cream is great &amp; really does lift.</li>
    <li> I am not a fan of Avon, I just bought this cream based on so many nice reviews and here is my opinion. The package is nice, the smell of this cream is a little bit yacky for me (but it&#x27;s ok with me, I do not apply it to my nose :)), and the texture is nice (it applies and soaks into skin east enough). And...probably, this is it. Nothing else, unfortunately. I have read others reviews and many people claim that this cream gives a very good lifting and smoothing effect just after 2-3 days (maybe 1 week). Well, good for them, but I&#x27;m on my 3-d week of using this cream and it does nothing. I would say even more: I have so very little wrinkles under my eye-area I barely can see them, but this cream makes them very noticeable (I need to re-apply it couple of times or to apply a different one). The only positive about this cream- it does not irritate my skin (before I could tolerate only Wei East White Lotus eye cream but it looks like they stop making it). So, if anybody out there has the same sensitivity problem, i think, this one will work for you, but I am not going to re-purchase this cream. Sorry, Avon: good idea- no results.</li>
    <li> Droopy eyelids run in my family. No matter what products any of us have tried nothing has worked. My mother was even considering surgery until I started using this product. The morning after using the dual eye system my upper lids were tighter and the lower bags were starting to shrink. My mom noticed also so I bought it for her and she loves it. She also noticed a difference the first day. I can only imagine how much younger my eyes will look in a month. Needless to say since I finally found such a great product that doesn&#x27;t cost an arm and a leg I will only be using this from now on. All I can say is if you have doubts just try it and you will see for yourself how great your eyes look for a reasonable price. Trust me I have tried expensive products advertised by doctors, celebrities you name it my family has tried it so we were so amazed that avon&#x27;s Anew clinical eye lift pro Dual eye system was  the only one that gave such instant results. You have got to buy this it really works without going through surgery.</li>
    <li> I really like the product.  I could see results immediately.  The only drawback is getting the right about out of the jar.  I wish this came with a tiny applicator or was available in a tube.  I try not to think about what possible contaminents I may be putting in the jar with my fingers or nails.  Otherwise, it&#x27;s fabulous!</li>
    <li> I have been using this eye cream for years and see a difference after only a few uses. I have bags under my eyes and it really helps firm and tone my under eye area. As for the gel, I am 28 and don&#x27;t find a use for that as much.</li>
    <li> almost done with the bottle don&#x27;t see no difference if it helps im 19 i tried on my upper and lower eye little to no result but it might work for you i guess</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for a few years now. It really does work. I use it once a day , in the morning. Now, it does do the &amp;#34;lifting&amp;#34; on the upper eye lid, but if using it only the once a day, by late afternoon the &amp;#34;lifting&amp;#34; is gone. Just reapply. I use to buy this from my avon lady, but so much cheaper on Amazon!</li>
    <li> Glad I tried, wont purchase again. The only way to make your eyelids lift is surgical or botox.  Nice try Avon!</li>
    <li> Absolutely wonderful product!  Works great to lift upper lid and tighten lower eye lids.  I have been using it for 3-4 years and it still is the best product I&#x27;ve found for these issues.</li>
    <li> I recommend this product as it works as its described, for the price this product is great, the quality is the same as the expensive product :)</li>
    <li> You get what you pay for. The good: not a lot of bad ingredients - no parabens, no fragrance. The not so good: The under-eye cream might be adequate for someone in their 20s - but it&#x27;s nothing special. I bought this specifically for the upper eye gel hoping I&#x27;d get the promised lift they claim you get in 1 week. It&#x27;s been over 2 - and there is no difference whatsoever for this girl in her early 50s.</li>
    <li> love the product. My eyes look wonderful</li>
    <li> This is a great product It really helps with my under eye darkness however I would order it from Avon only from now on and not online I order this item online twice and both times the jars were old and expired and I was unable to use it. I had to discard it and request a refund. So I will just have to purchase it from Avon and save myself the headacheamd the time.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t see any noticeable difference in using this product.  I used the entire package as directed and I will never purchase it again.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for years. The effectiveness at reducing wrinkles for the low price is excellent.  I also find the upper lid moisurelizer is helpful in reducing the &amp;#34;Dry Eye Sydrome&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for a month now. Maybe a bit longer. I can&#x27;t tell the difference so far. I think there&#x27;s some difference but then I look at my hooded eyelid again and I think there&#x27;s nothing. I don&#x27;t know.</li>
    <li> I decided to try some Avon products when I saw that they got some high ratings in a magazine.  This one as well as two other Avon products (Thermalift and Luminosity) are the ones I stuck with.  The reason I didn&#x27;t give this one five stars is the cream for the under eye seems to run out before the upper eyelid cream. I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s because I use the under eye morning and night, and the upper eye just at night, but I wish Avon would take that into consideration when they packaged this product.  It was suggested to use left over upper eyelid cream on my neck at night by an Avon representative.  I do when I remember to!  As far as effectiveness for eyes, it&#x27;s a really good product and is comparible to expensive eye products.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried a few others.  Most either make my eyes water or cause pimples.  I&#x27;ve been using this product for several years and reallyt like it.</li>
    <li> I really love the combination of a gel and cream in one container, it seems silly, but it does make my bedtime routine just a bit quicker, which I appreciate. Both the gel and the cream are lightly scented and not overpowering. There was improvement in skin texture and brightness, but not quite enough to take care of the deeper wrinkles on my upper inner lids. I&#x27;ll continue to use this product and will likely repurchase.</li>
    <li> Works but it takes a while before you see a result. I&#x27;d recommend as long as you&#x27;re patient and don&#x27;t want a quick fix</li>
    <li> I see dramatic changes on my crows feet around my eyes, and I have been using it for four days. I am 32 and using anti aging cream in order to protect myself now before I get any older. This stuff is worth it, it soaks in well, feels good and looks great!</li>
    <li> It did nothing for me.  Not happy wth results after 30 days  don&#x27;t buy this product if u want results</li>
    <li> I have been using this product now for about a month. I have noticed a difference in my upper eye lid but not so much under my  eye. I&#x27;m convinced the gel works better than the cream. I am only half way through using the product and will see it through to the end.</li>
    <li> I really like this cream...I believe it has helped the texture of the skin on my eye lids and that is a lot more than any other creams have done....very reasonable price ...so why not...I will keep using it.</li>
    <li> This is the best eye cream I&#x27;ve used and I&#x27;ve tried many. You can FEEL the tightening happening, and see results within a few weeks. For $20, give it a try!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s good, nothing exceptional.</li>
    <li> Test on your skin but not around your eyes, before using. I had a terrible allergic reaction from using this product; slight swelling and skin irritation on my eyelids and under my eyes. I realize not everyone may have the same reaction BUT TEST BEFORE USING!!! I don&#x27;t recall seeing warning instructions. If they were there, not conspicuous enough to warn user!</li>
    <li> Upper eyelids need moisture too and this product makes it possible.  Cooling and smooth going on.</li>
    <li> This is the only eye cream I feel good about spending money for.  Takes down upper eye swelling and moisturizes well.</li>
    <li> not sure it meets its standard of improvement. arrived on time, but product messy.  will use until finished. no improvement yet</li>
    <li> This is my first time using this product and it is AMAZING! I&#x27;ve used Avon for years and a few years ago, they discontinued the eye cream that I used... so I&#x27;ve been searching for a replacement ever since. THIS IS IT! The cream on the bottom really does work out those nasty dark circles and the serum for the top is perfect for my sensitive skin. And, you can&#x27;t beat the cost! I highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> I have used this Avon product for about 4 years.  I love the moisture it provides my eye area without feeling greasy or weighty.  It is comfortable under my daily makeup.  It is a staple in my bathroom cabinet.</li>
    <li> I am 28 and I noticed my 1st wrinkles around my eyes! I did my research and bought this. i love it! Those wrinkles are gone! G-O-N-E!&lt;br /&gt;I keep using this to protect myself from the to come back</li>
    <li> I have been wanting to try this for a long time.  But...with the price of it from Avon I couldn&#x27;t afford it.  I&#x27;m glad I got it and I am looking to go back and get more.</li>
    <li> I ordered this item from a representative months ago just to try, it was great, but I stop using it for no reason. Lately started seeing my upper eyelid falling, and decided to order it again. As I don&#x27;t have contact with that person anymore, just went to amazon and the price was cheaper!</li>
    <li> This product works very good, specially when I don&#x27;t sleep for many hrs or when I have puffier eyes. I love it I will buy more.</li>
    <li> After using it I became sensitive to it and had to stop using it. It is a good idea to have separate treatments for eyelid and under-eye.</li>
    <li> This combination of lightweight gel for the brow and top lid and creamy formula for the under-eye area is the best eye cream I have discovered in decades. I had been using Shiseido and Dr Hauschka eye creams for quite some time, but they didn&#x27;t help with my under-eye puffiness at all, even though they both do an excellent job of moisturizing. Avon Dual System moisturizes AND TREATS, I can see the difference after less than 2 weeks of use.</li>
    <li> This is a great product for the eyes. My only complaint is that it is sometimes hard to put on eyeshadow after using the eye lid cream. You have to make sure it is fully dry or the shadow clumps. Otherwise it is great.</li>
    <li> this product goes on and doesn&#x27;t feel tight or sticky like others I&#x27;ve tried. 3 weeks later I&#x27;m noticing tighter skin and smoother eyelids.</li>
    <li> I ordered this at first just because I was getting older but now I so believe that it works that I just bought one for my mother. I am 48 years old and have no crows feet or wrinkles around my eyes.</li>
    <li> My daughter gave me this product to try since she had been raving about it.  It definitely worked and made my eyes look rested and lifting the area miniminizing the lines.  The longer you use it the more results you will see.  I then decided to try the Garnier Ultra Lift Pro lift &amp; Deflate eye treatment that was the same idea as the Avon except it was cheaper...Gel on the bottom of eye, cream on the eyelid which was the reverse of what the Avon is  which is gel on the eyelid, cream underneath the eye.  The Garnier was a big waste of money and no improvement seen at all...big disapointment..I went back to the Avon and noticed the difference immediately and will stck with this one...</li>
    <li> This product rules when it comes to eye cream.  I&#x27;ve used since 2005 and have noticed a dramatic change in the appearance and contours around my eye area.  I love this product!</li>
    <li> I love this product and have been using for about 7 or 8 years, however my last order was placed on October 9th and it is now the 30th and I have still not received my order!</li>
    <li> This is heavenly on my eyes. It is handy to have both products in one container. This product Streamlines my mornings.</li>
    <li> This product works well but it needs to be used consistantly for 7-10 days before noticable results. A nice side note is this product does not irratate the eye area at all, i have been applying this product for four months and am happy with the results.</li>
    <li> I love the results of the eye lift and have been using it for 2 years.  I bought 2 through Amazon for the price 1 cost with Avon</li>
    <li> I saw absolute no difference or change in the firming of the upper eyelid or lessening of dark shadows. Rather disappointed.</li>
    <li> This is really great eye cream I have been using it for years it makes the winkles around the eye area soft and smooth definalety worth trying</li>
    <li> I am very happy with the results in just a few weeks time.  I only use this product right before bed so I&#x27;m sure the improvement would be much greater if used twice a day.  I certainly can see a difference especially under the eyes.  Great product and price!</li>
    <li> Wonderful product.  I have a tendency to get dark circles under my eyes and was getting some fine lines at the corners of my eyes.  After using this once or twice a day for about a month, I could see a definite improvement.</li>
    <li> This is one product I will never stop using.  Really great for the eyes.  I have been a loyal user for many years.</li>
    <li> Great product, great experience. Thanks!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried all kinds of eye cream products from Lancome to La Mer  and this is by far the only one tha has delived great results, ohh and  I love the price!!</li>
    <li> Love the creamy feel of the undereye creme, and the silkiness of the above eye gel. I haven&#x27;t noticed any big changes, but some would argue I have none to be made, lol. I have used this in the past and would use again. The sections don&#x27;t seemed to be filled to the brim, so I come away feeling as though I didn&#x27;t get my whole money&#x27;s worth. All in all I love Avon and have beautiful skin after using it for many, many years, so I would recommend.</li>
    <li> Wasn&#x27;t sure about this at first but ordered it anyway because I love the gels.&lt;br /&gt;Glad I did this is another product from Avon that works! I received it yesterday and tried it right away and my eyes look brighter and I felt it tightening the eye lid area. Another product I will stay with thanks to Amazon!!!!</li>
    <li> Havent noticed a difference in my eye area. It is good for contact lense wearers or sensitive skin, but no visible difference in a month of using it.</li>
    <li> Fit perfectly and works fine.</li>
    <li> Best product I have ever used!</li>
    <li> Great for smoothing the wrinkles from underneath my eyes.</li>
    <li> This dual system is so clever.  The eyelid gets a dab of moisturizer that gives you an instant lift.  Underneath your eye you apply another type of moisturizer, that takes away the puffiness and dryness.  This is a great product!</li>
    <li> I do not care for this.  It does not do as its supposed to.  Would not purchase again.  I didn&#x27;t like the dual creams</li>
    <li> Product arrived quickly.  The product is exactly what I expected and the results were great.  I would buy this again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this eye cream for quite a few years and although I&#x27;m almost 65 I&#x27;ve managed to keep a lot of crepiness and crows feet at bay so I swear by this eye cream!</li>
    <li> I wanted this to work...but it doesn&#x27;t.  This does nothing to lift the eye...not even for a short time. Disappointed.</li>
    <li> Excellent moisturizer for the thinning skin surrounding the eyes, I don&#x27;t feel that it has improved my skin...smoothing wrinkles and such however, I am 35. I might not buy this again after it&#x27;s gone. I&#x27;ll probably go back to clinique. I recommend it to the youthful who don&#x27;t have any aging skin issues.</li>

    <li> I am continually looking for a product to help with the bags under my eyes.  The product was nice, but it has not turned into my save all.</li>
    <li> I like the product but it&#x27;s messy. The gel was mixed up with cream when I opened the container. Keep the box upright when you buy it and store it and maybe it won&#x27;t happen, I don&#x27;t know. I bought two and am using the first one. It seems to moisturize which is what I was looking for and the gel doesn&#x27;t run down into my eyes which I thought it would do. I work out a lot and don&#x27;t need that!</li>
    <li> After 2 refills I didn&#x27;t notice any difference at all. Wasn&#x27;t about to buy a third</li>
    <li> I was using a popular eye cream from Cl******e and paying $63 for slightly more creme. This product is just as good, if not better due to the duo of under and over the eye creme. Would totally recommend and will buy again</li>
    <li> While I am only 28 years old I have been looking for an eye cream to help with some slight lines and bagginess on the under eyes. I am a full time student and mother of a toddler so I get super tired eyes! The cream for under eyes in this really makes my eyes feel a bit more awake and less baggy. The upper eye gel feels nice too but not sure if it is making any difference since I don&#x27;t have much upper eyelid droopiness. Hopefully it will help prevent it from happening! Note too that it really only takes the tinniest dab of this stuff, especially the gel. Some other reviews said it ran into their eyes and was terrible? They must have been using too much...I will be buying this again and would recommend it to others.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t really see a difference since using two jars.  Won&#x27;t buy any more.</li>
    <li> I hate to complain but this product gave me an allergic reaction around my eyes.  I&#x27;m sure the product is good but my skin is very sensitive.  Sorry</li>
    <li> I love this product. It does really help sagging eyes.</li>
    <li> I have have been using Avon&#x27;s Anew Clinical Eye Lift for 5 years. When I started using this  I was, 56 years old and I was having a harder and harder time getting my eye makeup to look \\&quot;smooth\\&quot;. My eye lids were getting that \\&quot;crepey\\&quot; look. I could see a huge difference within 2 weeks.&lt;br /&gt;This is definitely the best product I have ever used!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;LuvTahoSno :)</li>
    <li> This is a great product!  I have been using this for about 1 1/2 months now.  I am extremely sensitive to eye products and this is the only one I&#x27;ve used that didn&#x27;t irritate my eyes and make them red, itchy, and tear up.  It definitely hydrates my upper and lower eye area without any irritation.  I did notice a reduction in the puffiness and slightly less creepiness of the under eye area.  I didn&#x27;t really notice any life in the upper eye area but it is very smooth and wears well with eye make-up.  A little goes a long way and I still have over half the jar left.</li>
    <li> Finding the right eye cream is a lot like finding the right wallet - you have to try may before you&#x27;re happy. I like this cream and gel combination as it addresses all eye problems.have noticed a difference after just a few days,</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product daily for the past month, and I have to say that I really enjoy it! The upper eye gel makes my eyes feel like they get a true &amp;#34;lift&amp;#34;. When I wake up in the morning and still feel a little bit tired, I put some of this on and this gel makes my eyes feel more awake. I also really like the under eye cream, which is soft and a great texture - not too thick, and not too thin. I&#x27;ve never realized how dry the skin under my eyes is until I started using this cream. This cream and gel refreshes my skin. The only thing I don&#x27;t like about this product is how after a few hours, the gel begins to rub off if I touch my eyelids. Make sure not to touch your eyelids until you wash your face. I plan to purchase this product again when I run out, and I would recommend it to anyone else who wants a refreshing and brightening feel for their eyes.</li>
    <li> I have used this product before and I like the fact that it is two creams in one. It rates a 5 star</li>
    <li> I used to not have a special eye cream, but then I learned about how different the skin is around your eye vs. the rest of your face and decided it made sense to have a separate lotion that was designed specifically for it. I started with just a gel and really liked it, then when Avon discontinued it (LIKE THEY ALWAYS DO), I had to look to another product. I opted for the gel here and wasn&#x27;t anticipating loving the lotion, but I have been using this for a year now and don&#x27;t think I will ever change. The gel feels nice on your eyelid and the lotion feels nice on your undereyes. I use this every morning in combination with some pink concealer and you can barely even tell that I have bags under my eyes every morning before makeup. Buy this if you are considering -- you&#x27;re gonna love it.</li>
    <li> Love this duo by Avon.&lt;br /&gt;I have used this product since its conception.  It does wonders and feels exhilarating around the eyes, really perks them up.  In fact I tell myself that I can see better.  Opens the eyes up.&lt;br /&gt;The price was right from this seller and the delivery was fast.&lt;br /&gt;Will order again if it is available.</li>
    <li> Received my order very quickly but as far as the product its not that great as i have not seen any results what so ever.  Only have the beginning of signs of aging around my eyes and it didnt help that.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a few years, especially because I have droopy upper eyelids.  This product really has made a big difference, and I will use it as long as it&#x27;s available.</li>
    <li> This eye cream is great no greasy and looks like my fine lines look better. Would buy again when I&#x27;m out of it.</li>
    <li> When I recieved the eye pro system the gel part looked like it had melted and evaporated. So not even half of the product still existed. As far as how well it works, I was expecting better. It does hydrate the eye and the gel so seems to tighten the upper eye but it doesn&#x27;t last more than a few minutes. The eye cream seems only to hydrate. I probably won&#x27;t be purchasing this again.</li>
    <li> I LOVE THIS PRODUCT. IT IS GREAT FOR YOUR EYES AND FACE. I USE IT ALL THE TIIME. LOVE IT.</li>
</ol>
