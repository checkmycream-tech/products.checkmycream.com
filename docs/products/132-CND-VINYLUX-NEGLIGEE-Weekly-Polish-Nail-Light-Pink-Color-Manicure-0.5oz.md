    <li> I loved the brand . This was my first purchased item. It is very sheer color. Eventhiugh i put two layers it was very clear. But still loved the fact that i didnt have to keep on doing nails was a biggest plus. I have kids so my hands are always in water. Loved it and purchased other colors</li>
    <li> Much easier than Shellac. Dries quickly! Love it! Will definitely be buying it in more colors! So glad this stuff came out!</li>
    <li> Great polish, didn&#x27;t realize it had sparkle/shimmer in it though and it&#x27;s very light. Still pretty though and great if that&#x27;s what you&#x27;re looking for.</li>
    <li> Very light color pink. Lasts well for about 5 days. Didn&#x27;t like the color very well.</li>
    <li> This is such a great invention along with the top coat. I have recommended it to all my friends. The pink colour is nice and stays for a week as advertised.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t find this brand any different than Esse or Orly.  I do a lot of cooking and cleaning and yes I do wear gloves for cleaning, but I find chips within a day or two.  It&#x27;s a little less expensive than Esse so I might try different colors.</li>
    <li> Wonderful color for summer plus it is long-lasting and hasn&#x27;t chipped in almost two weeks of wear even though it&#x27;s called &amp;#34;weekly&amp;#34; Polish!</li>
    <li> Like the polish and products of Vinlyx, but it seems like if you keep it on for any length of time, it definitely weakens (my) nails.  Great delivery.</li>
    <li> Love this product...yes, it does last!</li>
    <li> I purchased this to replace my other bottle that ran out. I don&#x27;t know if CND changed the formula/color, but this is not the same negligee that I owned before. The color is ultra sheer, even with three coats. Will absolutely not purchase again.</li>
    <li> Color is not as sheer as the uv CND but still nice. I would definitely purchase this item again and recommend it to others.</li>
    <li> I USE TO PAY +$3.00 EACH TIME I GOT MY WEEKLY MANI TO USE THIS EXTENDED WEAR NAIL POLISH.  NOW I BOUGHT THE SAME BRAND AND COLOR I USE AT THE SALON AND I SAVE $3.00 EACH WEEK.  MY MANI NOW LASTS 7 DAYS RATHER THAN 3 DAYS.</li>
    <li> stays on for a week! just like its advertised to do! keeps nails strong, no damage upon removal! great product!</li>
    <li> All of these Vinyllux polishes are beautiful. The colors vary as some are more vibrant than others. I have noticed they carry a lot more &#x27;matte&#x27; looking colors. But let me tell you, I double color when I want a more fetching look. Negligee is a staple you will want to keep. It is perfect for french, on its own or how I wear it. I add &#x27;Beau&#x27; on top for a fabulous almost natural looking nail. Its opaque.</li>
    <li> I was disappointed with the coverage. I understand that it is pale, but it applied very unevenly. Disappointing. It also chipped the next day.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical about the &amp;#34;weekly&amp;#34; manicure claim, but it is true.  The product does what it says it will do.  I purchased both color and topcoat and am very happy with the system.  At a meeting, someone asked about the color, so I ordered the set for her as thank you gift.  She loves it and when I see it on her, I know that we both have a winner.  The color suits us, both school administrators, and both with short nails.  We like our hands to appear groomed, but also like to be able to do our work involving a lot of paper and not have to paint nails every night to deal with the inevitable chips.</li>
    <li> This is so sheer it is pointless. It would take 20 coats to get the color on the bottle.</li>
    <li> It chipped in two days when it is suppose to stay on for seven days....other friends tried it and felt the same way. Do not recommend.&lt;br /&gt;Not great</li>
    <li> The color is just gorgeous!!Light elegant pink with a hint of iridescent sparkle.The polish lasts at least a week or so..</li>
    <li> Color has a purple tint I was not expecting :(</li>
