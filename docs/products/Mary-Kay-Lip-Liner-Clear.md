### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>This is a great liner!  </li>
      <li>The price is great, too.</li>
      <li>not as happy with this as lipstick</li>
      <li>Good thing</li>
      <li>I have been buying Mary Kay for years and was thrilled to find it cheaper here.  </li>
      <li>It was much more effective.</li>
      <li>I love how this product goes on smooth and lasts all day!</li>
      <li>love this lip liner.</li>
      <li>I know that the UD 24/7 eye pencils are awesomely wonderful and once dry, don&#x27;t budge or bleed at all.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried Revlon, Maybelline and Loreal, all without the astounding success I&#x27;d hoped for.  </li>
      <li>This is amazing, first time I ever bought anything from Mary Kay</li>
      <li>(although if you want a fine point, you will like this.)</li>
      <li>The only good thing about it is that it doesn&#x27;t need to be sharpened.  </li>
      <li>The only good thing about it is that it doesn&#x27;t need to be sharpened.  </li>
      <li>If you don&#x27;t have an issue with lipstick wearing off quickly like I do, then this Mary Kay pencil may work for you.  </li>
      <li>I guess at a certain age there really isn&#x27;t anything that keeps lipstick from bleeding, but this works better than others I have tried.</li>
      <li>In theory, a clear lip liner should keep lipstick from feathering and bleeding into the fine lines around the mouth.  </li>
      <li>The product is OK, but the point is so tiny</li>
      <li>Wax keeps lipstick from wearing off, that&#x27;s why matte formulas, with a higher wax content, wear longer than creamy, shiny formulas.  </li>
      <li>I also have two of the 24/7 colored lip pencils and they stand up pretty well</li>
      <li>This clear lip pencil wore off pretty quickly (I do lip my lips often though) and didn&#x27;t keep my lipstick from migrating into the lines and creases around my lips.  </li>
      <li>Well, Mary Kay certainly didn&#x27;t do that.  </li>
      <li>But it certainly doesn&#x27;t work for me.  </li>
      <li>Product was very dry..can&#x27;t really use it.</li>
      <li>In execution, however, this Mary Kay lip pencil didn&#x27;t really do that at all.  </li>
      <li>I was tired of running out of a specific color of lip liner so this is the perfect choice since it goes with every color!</li>
      <li>This Mary Kay pencil was not my first foray into clear liner territory, however.  </li>
      <li>Super tiny lip liner!!!</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m very surprised!</li>
      <li>So you&#x27;d think that the developers of lip pencils would put 2 and 2 together and make a pencil with a high proportion of wax.  </li>
      <li>I wish they would go back to the original clear, wax lip liner they used to carry.</li>
      <li>It certainly didn&#x27;t work any better than the drugstore brands I&#x27;ve tried in the past.  </li>
      <li>I like Loreal clear lip liner.  </li>
      <li>It has a very soft consistency, almost creamy, when what is necessary is a waxier formula.  </li>
      <li>So I&#x27;m upping my game and am going to spend more for the UD pencil.  </li>
      <li>However, for my next try, I think I&#x27;ll purchase an Urban Decay 24/7 clear lip liner because they&#x27;re waterproof and therefore, again in theory, should last longer.  </li>

<li> This works just like any lip liner, bu as your lipstick wears off, you aren&#x27;t left with that colored ring around your lips left by other lip liners.  </li>

<li> I hate to see a line around my lips, this does not show, but keeps my lipstick on my lips.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s awful, my lipstick bleeds as bad as it does when I don&#x27;t have any liner on.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Got here on time...love it</li>
    <li> This is a very tiny liner not at all like the one they used to sell. Product was very dry..can&#x27;t really use it.</li>
    <li> I guess at a certain age there really isn&#x27;t anything that keeps lipstick from bleeding, but this works better than others I have tried.</li>
    <li> Super tiny lip liner!!! Not impressed.</li>
    <li> I like Loreal clear lip liner.  I tried Mary Kay because of the name and reputation.  It&#x27;s awful, my lipstick bleeds as bad as it does when I don&#x27;t have any liner on.  Needless to say I won&#x27;t be using Mary Kay again.  pc</li>

So I&#x27;m upping my game and am going to spend more for the UD pencil.  Maybe a waterproof, budgeproof formula is just what I&#x27;m looking and hoping for.  I know that the UD 24/7 eye pencils are awesomely wonderful and once dry, don&#x27;t budge or bleed at all.  I also have two of the 24/7 colored lip pencils and they stand up pretty well but I don&#x27;t want to carry several different colors around in my purse, hence the &amp;#34;clear&amp;#34; choice.  If you don&#x27;t have an issue with lipstick wearing off quickly like I do, then this Mary Kay pencil may work for you.  But it certainly doesn&#x27;t work for me.  I&#x27;ll just relegate it to the back of my makeup drawer and hopefully find someone to give it to.  It was a total waste of $$$ for me.  I think I&#x27;m being quite generous giving it three stars.  It certainly didn&#x27;t work any better than the drugstore brands I&#x27;ve tried in the past.  The only good thing about it is that it doesn&#x27;t need to be sharpened.  However, that&#x27;s not enough of a reason for me to like it.The only good thing about it is that it doesn&#x27;t need to be sharpened.

    <li> This lip liner is a much smaller product than I expected.  The product is OK, but the point is so tiny it&#x27;s difficult to apply. (although if you want a fine point, you will like this.)</li>
    <li> I expected a larger size</li>
    <li> Sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn&#x27;t keep my lipstick from bleeding. I have to keep reapplying. Will buy a more expensive one next time.</li>
    <li> This is amazing, first time I ever bought anything from Mary Kay and I&#x27;m very surprised! Will definitely buy again once I run out</li>
    <li> I wish they would go back to the original clear, wax lip liner they used to carry. It was much more effective.</li>
    <li> Works well to prevent feathering when you use it to just line your lips. I got this so I wouldn&#x27;t have to buy a bunch of different lip liners to match all my lipsticks, but I have noticed that even with a lip scrub and a moisturizing balm, when I fill in my lips with this, they look chapped and flaky. To me that&#x27;s disappointing because I do find that filling in my lips first makes the lipstick last longer, and I can&#x27;t use this product for that. Maybe I got a bad one, but it&#x27;s not something I&#x27;ll be reaching for often.</li>
    <li> This was hard and dried out. Not smooth and creamy as others I&#x27;ve bought from other places.</li>
    <li> I was tired of running out of a specific color of lip liner so this is the perfect choice since it goes with every color!</li>
    <li> Mary Kay....always delivers</li>
    <li> This product does not last  very long.  Disappointed</li>
    <li> love this lip liner. I hate to see a line around my lips, this does not show, but keeps my lipstick on my lips. I apply 2 times per day is all.</li>
    <li> not as happy with this as lipstick</li>
    <li> This works just like any lip liner, bu as your lipstick wears off, you aren&#x27;t left with that colored ring around your lips left by other lip liners.  Actually you want to line just outside your lips, where the lipstick tends to bleed into.</li>
    <li> I have been buying Mary Kay for years and was thrilled to find it cheaper here.  I love how this product goes on smooth and lasts all day!</li>
    <li> i tried this only because usually when i wear a bold lip color, throughout the day it tends to feather a little and i get paranoid that it looks crazy... well, this product does not help. It just doesn&#x27;t work at all. It&#x27;s dry. It doesn&#x27;t glide on or anything. Its really difficult to put on. It pulls my lips around. I don&#x27;t know about this.</li>
    <li> It is hard to find a clear liner that is retractable.  This is a great liner!  The price is great, too.</li>
