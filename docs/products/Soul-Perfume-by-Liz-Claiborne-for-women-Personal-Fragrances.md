<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I o&lt;br /&gt;Love the scent and the process and efficiency to buy it was excellent.</li>
    <li> Very strong smell,not a good choice for young girls.</li>
    <li> The smell is nice for running errands so I don&#x27;t use my expensive perfume. Not something I&#x27;d use as my signature scent though.</li>
    <li> OK smell , good price for the size bottle!</li>
    <li> Everyone asks why do I smell so good?&lt;br /&gt;Soul by Curve has been my favorite fragrance for years.&lt;br /&gt;Light, fresh and natural scent.&lt;br /&gt;Since I haven&#x27;t been able to purchase SOUL in stores for quite some time~it&#x27;s terrific that I can find it ONLINE at a great price!</li>
    <li> Love this scent I always get compliments that I smell great wherever I go. It is subtle yet vibrant! It last long too!!</li>
    <li> Item arrived on time and as described. This is the second bottle I have ordered. Smells great</li>
    <li> This frangrance is very nice. It&#x27;s a nice summer fragrance that last. I would recommend this fragrance to others. k</li>
    <li> I really thought I would like it, since I absolutely Loooooove Curve CRUSH, but this one is a miss, as someone else said it is too old-lady smelling.  Lilly-like.  So much in fact that when I first sprayed it, it is so overbearing it makes your sinuses feel like they are pressurizing, lol. I&#x27;ld like to note that I don&#x27;t have a sinus problem, but that is how it affects me. Waaay too cool/sweet smelling. I am disappointed. If you like it, I will gladly sell at a discount the one I purchased. . .</li>
    <li> I am not a flowery kinda gal and the sent from this is very light and not overpowering.  I have tried many perfumes and this is by far my fav.  I get compliments everytime i wear this.  I appreciate that Amazon carries this because you can not find it in stores any more.  They carry the vintage Soul which is very strong and overpowering but not this sent.  Thanks from a long time user of Soul by Curve</li>
    <li> I am happy with this item. It is very useful and practical. Good quality. I recommend it. Great job. Thank you.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t expect much, all curve scents have a distinctive note, but I chose this one as a gift for my sister and she loved it.</li>
    <li> The real deal Curve Soul by Liz.  Great price.  Fast delivery.  Good deal all around</li>
    <li> My daughter loves this scent and product and I was thrilled to find it for .70 less than Target.com</li>
    <li> Not overpowering or cloying. It mixes with your scent and the other products that you use without clashing. I get several comments from those that step into my circle for a hug. Nice subltety. Always lifts the spirit.</li>
    <li> Its a light floral fragrance that doesnt over power you</li>
    <li> great price fast shipping thanks</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this scent. It is floral but not too heavy and not old-person floral. It really seemed to last too. I got many compliments on this scent. I love it and am very pleased with this purchase.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite perfume!</li>
    <li> Big bottle, small price, smells great and lasts!!!! Very satisfied!</li>
    <li> I love the scent but it does not last long at all! It lasted all of about 1 hour. I asked my BF as well as my Mom and friends - on different days - to see if they could detect the scent. They couldn&#x27;t unless they were actually sniffing my neck! Price is great, the scent is nice, but for EDF, it sure fooled me. I think I have EDT&#x27;s which scents lasted longer! I would not buy this again, and I really can&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
    <li> This one is a perfect blend of naughty and nice!</li>
    <li> So delicated fragance I love it</li>
    <li> My friend Teri loved this purchase &amp; it was timely shipped, Thanks~</li>
    <li> The wife loved it, the smell is soft and easy on the nose the only concern is that it don&#x27;t last long besides that we both like it thank you</li>
    <li> Smells great...has your clothes smelling great the next day as well. I would recommend this to anyone who is interested.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a guy so i don&#x27;t really know what king of parfum to buy but after getting this for my bros wife she seamed to really like the smell it wasn&#x27;t over powering but lasted a long time</li>
    <li> Pleased with the product.</li>
    <li> not what I expected for a Claiborne product, maybe it will grow on me.</li>
    <li> is excelent... good quality, nice desing, and perfect present, thanks so much</li>
    <li> This is one of my favorite perfumes and when it was discontinued by Liz Claiborne, I was very disappointed. So, when I ordered it from this seller, I was a bit skeptical after reading reviews about purchases of discontinued perfumes from other sellers. But, this was a great buy. It arrived in a couple of days with no damages.  It is smells just like the Soul I have always used. My only regret is that I wish that I had ordered more than one. I will order more if the seller has more in stock.</li>
    <li> I love this perfume almost as much as I love Curve Crush...slightly sweet...but not cloying...not quite as powdery as Curve Crush ...Soul is light...&lt;br /&gt;fresh...not too sweet...I loved it...</li>
    <li> this is a great perfume that should not have been discontinued.  It is sad that it is only available through sights like this.</li>
    <li> everyone that comes in contact with me love the scent</li>
    <li> Curve Soul has been a favorite of mine for a long time. I am glad that I can purchase it still on Amazon because it is nearly impossible to find in the stores.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love all the Liz Claiborne fragrances especially Soul Curve.  It has a light fragrance that can be sporty, dressy, or casual.  I get many compliments when wearing Soul Curve.</li>
    <li> Sprays on strong but settles down after a while. Will not be a favorite, but wearable.</li>
    <li> Arrived timely and in good repair</li>
    <li> I like this perfume,  its really light and summer smelling. I would buy this again.</li>
    <li> Love it!  Beautiful fragrance.  Packaged nicely and received quickly.</li>
    <li> I had this.. Don&#x27;t know where it is now...it was gifted, the person who gave me had real bad taste in perfumes..</li>
    <li> This was a gift for my sister. She loves it and it arrived on time when promised.</li>
    <li> Arrived on time and as described</li>
    <li> Fast Service ! Thanks! Was upset though to realize that I had bought this exact perfume for my mom last year! UGH...</li>
    <li> Good price, but I&#x27;m not crazy about how it smell.</li>
    <li> The perfume was shipped quickly and arrived intact. I am so thrilled with my transaction I would definitely recommend the product, being a customer of the items seller, and using Amazon.com without a doubt. It was most assuredly a VERY positive online shopping experience. Thanks so much!</li>
    <li> I loved it the shipping was fast and it smells amazing. great for the price. If you&#x27;re looking for a great smelling perfume for a great price then definitely get it.</li>
    <li> Better than expected. Girls will love it for sure but don&#x27;t forget you can get better product than this.</li>
    <li> The scent is nice, but not for me. I am not a huge fan of musky scents. It would be nice for other people though. Also it doesn&#x27;t last long at all. You can spray alot on and it lasts for maybe a hour. I won&#x27;t buy this scent again.</li>
    <li> I love using fragrances, but so many of them just aren&#x27;t suited for daily use &amp; are better for certain circumstances or places. (C&#x27;mon girls, you know what I mean by this. You wouldn&#x27;t wear the same fragrance on a date as you would at work!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Curve Soul is one of those rare scents that works well just about anywhere. It&#x27;s got a light &amp; somewhat fruity scent that just has a nice clean smell to it. (Great if you&#x27;re at work &amp; need a quick pick me up smell!) It&#x27;s incredibly long lasting as well- I found myself still smelling of this scent hours after I&#x27;d put it on. I&#x27;ve also gotten a ton of compliments on it as well!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now I do have to warn some users that if they aren&#x27;t looking for a nice light scent, they&#x27;re better off looking elsewhere. You won&#x27;t get any musky scents from this bottle, so if you&#x27;re like the woman who gave me this perfume you will want to check out some of the other scents.</li>
    <li> Curve Soul is a gentle fragrance!  If you don&#x27;t like over powering scents, this is for you.</li>
    <li> It smells good on my wife skin.</li>
    <li> Excellent product, was fulfilled sent to the estimated dates, loved the price and quality. I recommend it to all women smells yummy.</li>
    <li> wear this to the gym...not really my style but good during a sweat routine! lol</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this parfum!  An attractive, soft and feminine scent.  A staple in my collection next to Perry Ellis.  I love this much better than Curve Crush, which I did adore at one time!</li>
    <li> My favorite, been wearing it for years.. Simple and clean</li>
    <li> I have always loved the fragrance but the price was more appealing.  Thanks!</li>
    <li> love this scent... my fav</li>
    <li> Smells so good and great price!</li>
    <li> This is my all time favorite perfume. I love the way it blends with my natural scent and lingers even days after its application.</li>
    <li> Love it!!! Arrived early with no problems and the fragrance smell awesome. Thank you</li>
    <li> Love it! Great and and awesome, it smell so good, i just fall in love with it. Great Product, great price</li>
    <li> Curve Soul is a very light, airy, fresh, and casual fragrance.  Clean and subtle, not overpowering and pungent.  This is a great perfume for everyday wear.  This scent would be good on most women.  The age range of wearers in my opinion would be teens all the way to 30&#x27;s; 40&#x27;s and older should wear a more mature scent.</li>
    <li> Love the price. its a huge bottle for a great price. happy with the purchase. got it for a christmas present for one of my friends WHO loves this perfume and is hard to find in the store.</li>
    <li> I had been looking for it never would have thought i would find it here for a good low price.</li>
    <li> Great price and delivery</li>
    <li> Love this perfume, it smells great and lasts all day. I&#x27;ve received alot of compliments.  I would definitely recommend this to anyone.</li>
    <li> My wife loves curve soul.. It was her last bottle and it was hard to find at the mall. She was very happy to get this for Christmas.</li>
    <li> This fragrance is very fresh. Not sweet! And tooooo musky! I am more of a sweet and delicious perfume kind of girl! I would not recommend this to the 18-25 crowd it&#x27;s very old lady like.It&#x27;s just too much for me!</li>
    <li> Shipping was excellent and arrived before estimated delivery date. I don&#x27;t like the smell very much it smells kind of old ladyish to me</li>
    <li> Liz Claiborne does it again. This perfume is light and fresh and adding to that my hubby loves it. Five stars easy!</li>
    <li> First time using this cologne and it is worth it</li>
    <li> I LOVE this perfume. I had it before and had a hard time finding it at department stores. It was a good price and got it fairly quickly. Thanks!</li>
    <li> it was Perfect to my wife. Fragancia perdura casi las 24 horas. lo recomiendo</li>
    <li> Love this scent smells so good</li>
    <li> This perfumes smells delicious and last all day! My new favorite for sure.</li>
    <li> From the packaging/shipping and the perfume. Excellent!</li>
    <li> This is a very nice fresh.fragrance. The company was good to deal with and it arrived in good time.My only problem with this it does not stay on long but that is a problem I have with all fragrances they just seem to evoperate on me.I do enjoy this as long as it last.</li>
    <li> I always enjoy fragrances by Liz Clairborne and I haven&#x27;t been disappointed yet by the different products I have purchase.</li>
    <li> very lovely fragrance a christmas present for a cousin, you can never go wrong with the curve fragrances they are all so yummy:)</li>
    <li> Everything was wonderful, and I&#x27;ll be ordering more soon. Great doing business with you</li>
    <li> Brought it for my girlfriend. I live the smell, not overpowering just right nice light and sweet. Good buy for any woman</li>
    <li> This is an excellent purchase arrived quickly and without any damage it was great for the price as well I wear it every day.  I love it.</li>
    <li> This is cool but not really my  kind of time. love the men spray&lt;br /&gt;but will try another women scent</li>
    <li> my friend likes it very much</li>
    <li> I actually got this item on time and was a big hit with my mom.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve ordered Curve Wave and Chill previously. But Curve Soul is my favorite. Lots of complements. I will definitely purchase again.</li>
    <li> I really liked my order &amp; I was very or should I say highly satisfied</li>
    <li> Great price for  a Liz Clairborne perfume! Great for everyday use! Love it! Not so strong; just subtle notes.</li>
    <li> I BUY THIS AS A GIFT FOR MY DAUGHTER.  SHE LOVES IT AND IT HAS BECOME HER SIGNATURE SCENT.  LIGHT AND LOVELY, IT&#x27;S HIGHEST NOTE IS JASMINE.</li>
    <li> Very disappointing!! I&#x27;ve always loved Liz Claiborne perfumes this one just made me want to gag...</li>
    <li> Great price, good scent, fast shipping.  I would recommend.</li>
    <li> This is one of my go-to daytime scents. It is a water/floral scent and fits my everyday life perfectly. It goes on a strongly, but quickly fades to a quiet, pretty scent. It suits my romantic vintage style.</li>
    <li> Oh my; what a pleasant beautiful fragrance... don&#x27;t need to spray alot... WELL worth every dollar.... I love it just as I did years ago....</li>
    <li> Have nothing to address at this moment.  Because this item is a gift for Christmas.  I will get back to you at a later date.  Thank you.</li>

    <li> I love it!!!! Very fresh!!!!</li>
    <li> Smelled horrible on me.</li>
    <li> The only Fragrance I will wear.I cant find it in stores, and this was a great price.</li>
    <li> Good product but it takes time than usual for Prime. If you could send it faster, I will purchase more in neat future.</li>
    <li> Excellent customer service. It has a nice mild fragrance but does not last long. Its a very mellowed perfume and interesting combination of ingredients.</li>
    <li> Love it! And gets you noticed in a pleasant way since the aroma does last</li>
    <li> Great scent for date night!</li>
    <li> Everything arrived as expected and on time, price was very fair. This is my wife&#x27;s favorite perfume but has now become scarce, So it&#x27;s great to be able to find it for cheap.</li>
    <li> I always knew Liz Claiborne produces great perfumes,judging from the cost I thought otherwise.  To my surprise this is best of the three (3) I purchased.......love the scent and it stays on you all day.</li>
    <li> Everything was as expected</li>
    <li> Got this for my daughter and myself and the smell is amazing!! Love it</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m picky about perfume and have many many bottles I&#x27;ve received as gifts but just don&#x27;t like...  so I never use them. I have 20 bottles of stuff I don&#x27;t like! I don&#x27;t know why I just don&#x27;t throw it away. However, I got Soul as a part of a Curve Collection gift pack 7 years ago, and this is the only one I ran out of - and I ran out quick! I saved the bottle and I&#x27;m so glad I did so I can put it on my wishlist now. I even have a hard time finding perfume I like on my own, but this is my absolute favorite! It&#x27;s fresh, clean, and while it&#x27;s slightly floral, it&#x27;s not overwhelmingly so. Perfect for a geeky girl in I.T. who is usually just \\&quot;one of the guys\\&quot;. It&#x27;s nice to be able to tell my husband a perfume he can get me that I&#x27;ll actually wear!</li>
    <li> This was a gift for a friend. She couldn&#x27;t find it. So I found it for her at a reasonable price. She loved it!!!</li>
    <li> This scent is soo beautiful, light floral and sweet!! I am so happy with my purchase. It smells like a very expensive bottle of perfect and for the price you can&#x27;t beat this! Reminds me of spring and summer by the blooming sweet garden fields with a nice hint of sweetness and light aroma. ++++++</li>
    <li> This perfume is 100% authentic!</li>
    <li> Love the smell so clean and fresh will buy again</li>
    <li> Received a bottle that was leaking . I am still waiting for a replacement.</li>
    <li> When this perfume came i open it up smell it omg it smell so good and have a sweet.smell to it last a while not to strong do a nice smell</li>
    <li> Thank you i bought this for my wife she loved it .</li>
    <li> Love this perfume. Subtle, fresh floral scent and wears all day if you couple it with any Liz body lotion. I constantly look for price deals to to keep a couple bottles stash away. Don&#x27;t want to run out.</li>
    <li> Im a big Liz Claiborne fan I truly believe I ve worn just about every scent shes made. Everything she makes leaves you feeling fresh and sexy.</li>
    <li> Got this for my niece for Easter and she really liked it.  Nice perfume for a reasonable price.  Nice smell.</li>
    <li> I bought this for a grab bag gift for Christmas.  Hopefully, who ever picks it out of the grab bag will like it.</li>
    <li> Love the smell. Received lots of complements. I will purchase again.</li>
    <li> Bought this as a birthday gift from my friend and this is what she said to me ...&amp;#34;It is awesome, I just love it&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> i had bought twice this perfume. its floral and gives a sense of freshmess and beauty. very good.</li>
    <li> Smells kind of like sweet flowers.</li>
    <li> Cheap scent for cheap price. You get what you pay for, I guess. Was not expecting anything great but this scent is really awful.</li>
    <li> Love this Cologne! I was very upset when they stopped selling it in most stores.  I do notice the scent doesn&#x27;t last as long as it use to.  I imagine because it&#x27;s old or because of the shipping (Cologne can lose its strength when stored or shipped in cold or hot temperatures). Still am very happy to finally have my favorite perfume back on my vanity!</li>
    <li> WONDERFUL FRAGRANCE. PERFECT. FAST SHIPPING. A+</li>
    <li> I love the scent. I was in the store the other day wearing this scent and a lady stopped and say you smell nice. That is a good thing.</li>
    <li> I have loved this perfume for a long time, just glad I can find it here on Amazon!</li>
    <li> Love it so much I thing I would like a next one</li>
    <li> Thank You For Sending This Fast Great Job Amazon is Original Love the Smell</li>
    <li> The fragrance is sweet smelling like a flower a rose more like it! It&#x27;s perfect for every use, causally if you don&#x27;t want to waste your expensive perfume this is perfect!!</li>
    <li> Is good fragrance, but I was expecting something a little bit different. But is a good scent that everybody seems to enjoy! So I keep using it!</li>
    <li> Love love love the smell....great value and wiper fast delivery</li>
    <li> I love the cute box and it smells great, it just doesn&#x27;t last very long. It probably lasts like an hour before it fades so it gets a 4 - 5 from me! Other than that, it was packaged well and arrived on time.</li>
    <li> This does not smell like the original. When I tried to see about returning it, they claim that I cant because its a flammable product but they recommend that I sell it. What is the difference between me shipping it back to them and shipping it to someone else? I will never order from here again and I will be sure to tell friends and family not to either.</li>
    <li> bought this for my fiancee because i love the Curve Soul for Men, then saw this at a little price,and when my gf opened the shipping box, she loved the perfum box. its so stylish, but, thats just the exterior, when we smell the perfum, we both loved it a lot, its not a super strong perfum, its perfect, it lasts, it doesn&#x27;t smell alcohol...get it for your bf, wife, sister, mom, granny, its no expensive for the every day scent but quality</li>
    <li> It was a gift.  The recipient was pleased.</li>
    <li> Perfect,  great size and lovely smell</li>
    <li> This is another fragrance that I purchased based on reviews without having smelled the scent myself.  Lucky for me, this was another very successful blind buy for me. Hooray! I smell the fresh, crisp scent of the bamboo and lotus almost from the second after my first spritz. I didn&#x27;t have any alcohol-like scent to endure when I first sprayed like I do with so many fragrances. The fresh smell is intoxicating! I don&#x27;t tolerate the heat well at all, so I&#x27;ve already begun my long season of staying indoors most all the time. What a splendid experience it is to be able to spritz this on as often as I like...which is like the best, most divine smells of the warmer months outdoors, without having to step outside my door. The fresh scent lasts longer than these types of notes usually do on me, which is a real treat. After a little while I start to detect a faint freesia, as well as the heart notes of glorious heliotrope and tiger lily. YUMMY! I am still enjoying this gorgeous, harmonious blend when I notice a faint, but comforting musk. Wow! This is going to be one of my all-time favorites, I can tell. I can&#x27;t wait until the scent starts to fade so I can indulge in a fresh spritz! Highly, highly recommended to anyone who enjoys green, fresh, clean and somewhat floral fragrances. I don&#x27;t think this one is going to disappoint anybody. Enjoy!</li>
    <li> great price fast shipping.</li>
    <li> This was a great purchase I bought as a gift and they loved it so I would highly recommend this to anyone considering this it smells SO CLEAN AND SEXY !</li>
    <li> FAST DELIVERY AND EXACTLY WHAT I OR DE RED AT A GREAT PRICE!</li>
    <li> deliver to my neighbors home lucky for me she figure out it was mine and gave it to me even though we never met. fragrance sweet light I like it but mostlikely not to order from this company again due to poor packaging making shipping unreadable for delivery.</li>
    <li> I wish I knew what it smelled like before I brought it, I don&#x27;t like the smell and it don&#x27;t last</li>
    <li> gotta say i havent worn this scent in over 10 years, it was one of my favs so i was abit scared itmight not smell the same on me, and to my tickel it does!! am so excited this perfume is a classic in my eyes, the price is outstanding,and i received extactly as promised!</li>
    <li> Product it&#x27;s Gray.  Arrived before time I was quoted.</li>
    <li> Got it for my Wife&#x27;s Birthday and we both love the smell.</li>
    <li> I received my item expeditiously. It was well packaged and YES I  would by again in the near future. Thank You!</li>
    <li> Product received as stated. Very satisfied with shipping and product description. Sent has short lived life</li>
    <li> Another disappointing scent from Liz.  You need to use a lot if you want to keep a fragrance for a half hour.  Scent dissipates moments after applied.</li>
    <li> My 70-year-old sister-in-law really loves this stuff.</li>
    <li> Love this cologne, and this was a great price!</li>
    <li> Nice smelling perfume with a nice bottle.....</li>
    <li> smells great, and a good buy</li>
    <li> Excellent fragrance and arrived by private courier which helped a lot at the time there was trouble with the address.</li>
    <li> Beautiful excellent smell</li>
    <li> The perfume is great if you really like scents that smell exactly like plants. It has a very earthy smell.</li>
    <li> This is one of those scents that I wore a few years ago and really loved it so much that I can&#x27;t for the life of me remember now why I ever STOPPED using it!! Don&#x27;t you just love a fragrance that is YOU - and it is the YOU that YOU want the world to know! Very soft, &amp; to me, very sensual, this is one scent that stops people in their tracks! Men &amp; women notice...although it isn&#x27;t usually &#x27;WHAT ARE YOU WEARING?&amp;#34; It&#x27;s more of &amp;#34;YOU SMELL AMAZING!! I LOVE THE WAY YOU SMELL!!  Those are the kind of compliments that lift you up off the ground all day long! Thanks for reminding me just what I had been missing! Sometimes, it is good to go back in time, even if it is for just a little while! This fragrance will send your senses reeling for sure! Don&#x27;t hesitate if you LOVE smelling beautiful!</li>
    <li> my fav is actually curve soul, but this is such a sweat, fresh scent, I love using it after a shower.</li>
    <li> Love this perfume! Bought it a long time ago and great to see that this seller carries it!</li>
    <li> Excellent quick delivery and great scent</li>
    <li> great scent but the spray bottle didn&#x27;t work so great</li>
    <li> I am very happy to find this fragrance I could not find it in stores any more. Love it F.Richardson</li>
    <li> Its good enough... the scent lasts pretty long... but it wasn&#x27;t quite feminine enough for me, personally. I prefer something a little more obvious &amp; extreme. But this is great for someone who wants something light &amp; clean smelling.</li>
    <li> The ratings speak for itself! Satisfied with this scent only hope it does not burn!</li>
    <li> This is my favorite. Very pretty sent.</li>
    <li> This fragrance is the best!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> My girlfriend has been searching for the perfect scent for quite some time and I have always had luck with Clairborne products, so I took a chance. Liz hits it out of the park again!</li>
    <li> I had never used this fragrance before, but I love it.</li>
    <li> No more trying to dig through the shelves at TJMaxx to find a bottle! Easy peasy I found it now!</li>
    <li> This perfume was pretty disappointing.  I even research what the scent was prior; base, middle and top notes.  It smelled like old soap. I just cant wear it.  My friends quote, &amp;#34; Ya I agree it smells like soap but at least it smells like your clean.&amp;#34;  UGH</li>
    <li> another great perfume from Liz!!! I am a perfume junkie so this is a wonderful smell for me! sweet and perfect!</li>
    <li> This is a great buy! It smells absolutely wonderful. It is just the right size. It was just the right price too.</li>
    <li> This is a nice parfum spray. I bought it not expecting much because it was cheap. Boy was I surprise. This one smell better then most of the ones I paid more money for. I think you will like it and the fragrance last most of the day.</li>
    <li> This perfume is very light, I always loved this perfume because of its scent. Had no problem receiving this perfume, Great purchase!!!!</li>
    <li> This perfume is overwhelming when you first put it on, then it fades a little as most perfumes do. The scent itself is just not that appealing to me. It&#x27;s heavy just has &amp;#34;too much&amp;#34; to it. I always get compliments with Curve Vintage Soul but not one single compliment in over 2 weeks of wear with this.&lt;br /&gt; I love the Curve Vintage Soul but I wanted something lighter for spring/summer, this is not it :(</li>
    <li> It was what I expected.  Good service and product</li>
    <li> It smells like a perfume that would be great for an older woman. I&#x27;m in my mid 30&#x27;s and it was far too aged for me. I gave it to my mother as a mother&#x27;s day gift and she loved it. She&#x27;s in her 50&#x27;s. It smells like something she normally wears. I think I&#x27;ll stick to trying scents in store. What I did love about this is the bottle though. It was a cute bottle :) It wasn&#x27;t for me, but was pretty, and made a great gift so I can give it four stars.</li>
    <li> I get so many complements on how good I smell when I wear it. I have bought 4 bottles of this and always have one on hand! I don&#x27;t want to run out. LOVE IT.</li>
    <li> Nice soft smelling perfume I wear it everyday great price</li>
    <li> Great price for my favorite perfume. It arrived when promised.</li>
    <li> Smells so good. Good price. Everybody wants to know what the name of this cologne is that I&#x27;m wearing.</li>
    <li> I purchased 2 of these, one for me and another as a gift to an in-law. I never wore CURVE brand perfumes. I&#x27;m a Dolce &amp; Gabbana Light Blue fan and a Clinique Happy Heart lover. I liked the packaging and price of the product so I thought I&#x27;d give it a try, boy am I ever pleased. Curve Soul isn&#x27;t heavy like Obsession or some Musks, but it is strong, so you don&#x27;t need to use much...a spritz around the neck and wrists is good and the scent will linger for a good 6 hours. I actually have forgotten I had it on and received compliments from my fiance,  the McD&#x27;s drive thru guy as well as a local chef and a few co-workers. So, this perfume makes an impression and I&#x27;ll be adding this specific brand to my perfume niche.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my wife fast shipping we got it last night and I already ordered a second recommended for the single lady in this big world or the lucky married women in the world</li>
    <li> I love my perfume and I plan to reorder when needed!  Thank you! !</li>
    <li> I have never written a review on amazon before but I felt I needed to write this. I bought this product based on the reviews I saw and how nice it was suppose to smell. I just got my product and I am so disappointed! I have never used this product before so I cannot compare it , but the item that was shipped to me has no scent, It is just like water in a bottle. please beware of what you pay for.</li>
    <li> This is definitely the best perfume I&#x27;ve ever purchased! It smells SO good! And the price was awesome! I would definitely recommend this product!</li>
