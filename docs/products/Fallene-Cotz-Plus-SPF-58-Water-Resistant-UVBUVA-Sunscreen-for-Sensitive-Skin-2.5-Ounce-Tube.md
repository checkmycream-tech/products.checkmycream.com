      <li>Good Price/Nice size tube</li>
      <li>I feel like Fallene Cotz could do a really good job with this</li>

      <li>this one provides good coverage, fits skin tone and it is non oiky.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve always been good about suncare.  </li>

      <li>This is a good sunscreen that truly works.</li>
      <li>If the color matches your skin color that is good.</li>
      <li>Well I had heard good things about this sunscreen.</li>
      <li>This one didn&#x27;t, which was good for her.  </li>
      <li>This one provides good protection, doesn&#x27;t cause skin reactions, and is invisible on my fair skin.</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t notice a sunblock factor in any way superior to the tradtional spf 30</li>
      <li>, it&#x27;s fairly odorless.  </li>
      <li>so if you spend a good deal of time in the water you&#x27;ll need to re-apply it.      </li>
      <li>It holds all day and if you do not dive, you are good to go all day.  </li>
      <li>a high-SPF mineral sunscreen, this applies/spreads fairly well</li>

      <li>it just kind of sat there</li>

      <li>The stains did seem to wash out, but kind of ruined the stuff I was wearing for the day.</li>
      <li>I liked the fact that it is tinted.  </li>
      <li>I was told by my skin doctor to get this kind.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Some of the best sunscreen I have ever use, I would most def buy it again. If your looking for a geeat sunscreen look no father.</li>
    <li> I feel I was mislead by saying it contained only 2 ingredients.  Unfortunately I cannot use it because of some of the other ingredients that I was not aware of.  It was a waste of money for me.  Cotz does make a product that I can use called Cotz Pure SPF 30.  This is the one that I thought I was getting  How can I exchange what I have for what I need?</li>
    <li> According to [...], this product contains vitamin A, which may speed the development of cancer.  They also state that claims for such a high SPF are dubious.  It&#x27;s hard to find a natural but smooth sunscreen.  I&#x27;ve been through so many its disgusting.  Sadly this is a very expensive sunscreen to have issues like these.  Supposedly the same suncreen with SPF 40, for the face is much better (no vitamin A).</li>
    <li> My aesthetician recommended this product.  It is extremely light and breathable while giving you incredible protection.  No clogging of pores or pimples.  It works better than Obagi and Elta.  I recommend applying it immediately after you moisturize.  A little goes a long way. It goes on slightly white, but dries clear immediately.  The price is really affordable.</li>
    <li> This is the only sunscreen I have found that I can wear every day on my sensitive facial skin. I like the slight tint. I tried Fallene&#x27;s other sunscreen without the tint and it left a white cast. I have oily skin so not sure if the oiliness is me or the sunscreen but I can say from living in South Florida, it is not sweat proof and will come off if you wipe your face.</li>
    <li> This is a good sunscreen that truly works. But it leaves a light pale color on your face - like an unmatched foundation. If the color matches your skin color that is good. If it does not, it looks like a bad foundation. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;You may consider diluting and applying - dont know if that would affect the sunscreening ability.</li>
    <li> Having extremely sensitive skin and rosacea, I have had trouble finding a sunscreen that I can use on my face without a reaction of either burning, redness or hives.  After trying numerous products without any success, my dermatologist finally recommended Cotz. I am extremely happy with the results and use it every day now.  Works great!  I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> The only good thing about this product is that it&#x27;s not too oily, and didn&#x27;t give me break out like some others. But it made my skin really dry and rough. I&#x27;m not sure if that&#x27;s because of the high SPF level.  Finally, I had to change. I tried Coopertone Oil-Free for face, and it worked really well for me!</li>
    <li> It would protect your skin from sun.  Other than that I would not like to use this product again.  For those people who doesn&#x27;t like to put sticky, greasy, foundation like skin product.... DO NOT USE IT!!!!  It feels like putting thick greasy cover on your face all day long and smell like wearing a powdered coins (zinc and titanium dioxide) ... but too strong.  I tried to wear it since I feel like wasting $$$$ but I can&#x27;t anymore.  I rather give it away to someone who like it.    I think it&#x27;s really important how you feel when you apply on your face or body as important as how affactive it is....</li>
    <li> I had one of their other sunscreens, which was good, but it wasn&#x27;t water proof. This being that it is water proof is a better product for me since I use it to play tennis and to go out on my boat.    I follow the instruction of applying it prior to sun exposure and reapplying it after a few hours or after swimming. It does a good job.</li>
    <li> When I first went to use this product and saw the vaguely skin-covered tint, I thought, \\&quot;Oh no ...\\&quot; Shades of that awful \\&quot;acne treatment\\&quot; I used to use in sixth grade that was the approximate color of a Band-Aid!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But after I rubbed in the sunscreen, the tint disappeared completely, even on my whiter-than-white skin. It did leave my face looking a tiny bit greasy -- though I have oily skin, so most sunscreens do -- but nothing a little powder didn&#x27;t take care of.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There seems to be only a very mild scent -- I don&#x27;t know that I could identify it, but I guess it seems sort of minerally to me. (Is that a word?) Definitely not offensive, and I appreciate not having to smell like a coconut every time I wear sunscreen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As others have mentioned, the protection seems very good. I haven&#x27;t had a chance to test out its water resistant properties yet, but will definitely bring this along next time I&#x27;m at the lake or pool and report back!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One minor complaint: I wouldn&#x27;t wear this with light or white clothing. The tint does seem to rub off on them.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m extremely fair skinned and burn easily. I spent an afternoon in the sun with this product on and only burned where I didn&#x27;t apply the product. It&#x27;s ALMOST odor free and not at all greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thumbs up!</li>
    <li> Zinc is safe--it&#x27;s a mineral your body needs! And Zinc works great to protect the skin. But Zinc is also thick and white. Cotz here has made an attempt to create a &#x27;clear&#x27; version of zinc so the self-conscious can rest a little easier with a protective layer all over.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to say, it&#x27;s not my favorite consistency. And the main component of their &#x27;clear&#x27; version is more like making it skin-colored. But it&#x27;s still a big improvement over white and I&#x27;m glad for the less noticeable version. Overall, not a perfect product, but has many qualities that would make it worth a try.</li>
    <li> I am really fair skinned but the pale off-white tint in this sunscreen makes me look even paler and sickly. I could live with that, but after an hour in the sunshine, sweating just lightly, I took off my sunglasses and saw 2 bare spots on my nose under the sunglass pads with the whitish cream pushed downward like a wrinkled sheet into 2 blobs on my cheeks. I&#x27;ve never seen even thick make-up that pushes into globs like that. I didn&#x27;t use very much to begin with and rubbed it in very well. I have never been so embarrassed in my life. This is sooo not worth the cost!</li>
    <li> Yes, it is a little \\&quot;heavy\\&quot;, but it really works well.  Not only do I have very sensitive skin, but I burn easilly and have allergies.  I have used this everyday on my hands and not only did they not burn, but for the first time in 20+ years, my hands did not break out from touching grass!  Awesome protection!  I will definitely buy this again and again!!</li>
    <li> I have suffered from PMLE (extreme photosensitivity) since I was a kid and none of the sunscreens (AVENO, Neutrogena) really worked for me as I would still get hives all over my face once I&#x27;m in the sun for more than 10mins.  Hats don&#x27;t really work either.  However, once I switched over to Fallene Cotz SPF 58 two years ago (I currently live in sunny California where the UV is extremely high months on end), I haven&#x27;t had a single hives-break-out session. Yes it doesn&#x27;t dry completely clear but who cares? No sunscreen is perfect (and I have tried MANY brands). Just put it on after you&#x27;re dressed and you&#x27;re fine.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a man who uses sunscreen products all the time.  I tried this on exposed skin that hadn&#x27;t seen the sun all winter during a river rafting trip.  I was in direct sun all day and didn&#x27;t burn or even tan.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is flesh colored which I assume means this can be used as a foundation for makeup. I did notice that the product did rub off a bit on my clothing.  I don&#x27;t know if this is normal with foundations.</li>
    <li> This was recommended to my by my daughter when I complained that I don&#x27;t like most sunscreens because they make my face shiny.  It does not have any chemical blocks in it but uses titanium dioxide and zinc oxide instead.  I have coverage all day (I do work inside with a lot of walking outside, too) and it is never greasy.  My daughter skied everyday for 2 weeks straight using this product and it is the only time she has NOT developed a goggle tan.  So, it does really work.  We both highly recommend it. Worth the cost.</li>
    <li> I really liked this sunscreen and used it for a while before I realized that I could find a truly healthy sunscreen that works (even if it is a little greasy).  This is a great sunscreen if you are concerned about the major culprits in skin care but there are better alternatives if you are looking for the best ingredients.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for years.  What I like about it is that it doesn&#x27;t exacerbate oily skins as much as other sunscreens often do.  I only wish it was a little less expensive.</li>
    <li> I love this sunscreen and am so glad Amazon carries it. It&#x27;s hard to find but worth hunting for.</li>
    <li> No nasty organic chemicals, as many others contain. It uses metal oxides as as sun filters, including titanium and zinc</li>
    <li> Wonderful product. Recommended by dermatologist last year and have been using it ever since. Great protection for fair skinned people.</li>
    <li> Spread on pretty easy.  It is a little light so I add some iron oxide dye that come with their total block sunscreen.  You need to be careful or you&#x27;ll get it on your clothes before it dries.  It will stay on all day.</li>
    <li> My wife had some bad spots on her face and with this cream they are gone away like 90% and she is very happy and like they said happy wife happy life.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok but not that greatIt&#x27;s ok but not that greatIt&#x27;s ok but not that greatIt&#x27;s ok but not that greatIt&#x27;s ok but not that great</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for over two years. I find that it works very well. I had to switch when I had a very bad reaction to to netrogena sunscreens and other chemical screens. I can stay out in the sun for several hours withoutreapplying with no burning or sunspots developing. MIxes nicely with mineral powder to make into tinted foundation. I continue to purchace for years to come.</li>
    <li> This product rubs off of your skin and gets on to your clothing (or any other fabric -- like a chair or a car interior) and stains the fabric.  Not recommended.</li>
    <li> I am allergic to all other sunscreens and this saves my skin.  I just returned from Playa Del Carmen and was the only member of my family with no sunburn even after spending most of my time at the beach!</li>
    <li> I love this sunscreen.  I have oily, acne-prone skin, and everything makes me breakout, so when my dermatologist recommended it, I was a little hesitant. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;It does NOT cause any spots at all, and the zinc soothes any red spots or irritation I may have. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The light cream color (due to zinc) may not work for all skin colors, but if you continue to smooth it in, it will fade a bit.  For me, it evens out my coloring if I dab a bit more on certain areas. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;This sunscreen does not feel greasy and it does not melt. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t been able to put sunscreen on the delicate skin around my eyes until I found COTZ; there is no burning at all on sensitive or delicate skin.</li>
    <li> I was searching for a product that provided higher coverage for my very fair skin than what the 15spf provides, but without the eye irritation that the 30spfs you find in the stores big brandsnlike olay total effects  eucerin daily moisturizer  I read lots of reviews.  The description that peaked my interest was the fact that it doesn&#x27;t have any extra unnecessary chemicals in it.  I like that it has 58 spf. It has a foundation kind of tint instead of the white that zinc products usually have, so I rarely use foundation.  It also seems to reduce redness, an added benefit that also keeps me from having to wear the foundation.    I had a friend come into town on a sunny day &amp; we spent the whole afternoon sitting outside at Starbucks.  I didn&#x27;t reapply, &amp; still didn&#x27;t get any sunburn.      $$$$ This is more than I usually spend but it also works at least twice as good. You should never skimp on sun care because sun damage is irreversible. I really research new products I buy.  The best deal is here at Amazon with free supersaver shipping.  I just bought a book also. One tip to save is use this product on your face &amp; use one of those cheaper brands on your neck since your neck is away from your eyes.       To summarize...more expensive than store brands, best sun protection, no skin irritation (I put it on my eyelids also), reduces redness, has a skin tint.  A tiny bit oily about the same as no moisturizer(I have t-zone combination skin).  I hope this helps.  I&#x27;m cheap, but it&#x27;s worth paying double for this quality product.  I paid $17.00</li>
    <li> The box says this sunscreen dries clear, but it&#x27;s tinted and the tint rubs off on clothing. (It does wash out in the laundry, but it gets all over clothing). The suncreen never \\&quot;dried\\&quot; and was always sticky. I was in Hawaii and the humidity and heat were not that bad and so I was expecting it to be drier on my skin.    It did protect me very well and was extremely water resistant... and soap resistant... and washcloth resistant. In fact the only way it came off was to get a nylon scrubby and scrub.     I have PMLE (an extreme photosensistivity), and my dermatologist recommened this brand. The lotion did prevent a major out break and was extremely water resistant. So for that, it&#x27; gets three stars. However, I found that if I was not going out on a boat or doing hours of water acitivities that the Neutrogena Sensitive Skin (SPF 30 and with 9% Zinc) was just as effective and did not stain. It washed off more easily (but still needed scrubbing).     Becuase this was so effective, I&#x27;ll try the Clear next time. I did not get the Clear for this trip as it wasn&#x27;t available on next day shipping in order for me to get this before I left on my trip.</li>
    <li> Holy cow, and then some! I SUFFERED with painful, watery, sensitive eyes during swimming or sweating while working out. I tried EVERYTHING, but nothing worked. My girlfriend told me about COTZ, and I WAS BLOWN AWAY! No tears or sensitivity, just a fantastic sunscreen that won&#x27;t let you burn or let those brown patches appear. It also has a faint tint to even out your complextion. I wear this DAILY and love it!</li>
    <li> I have a very sensitive skin and this sunscrean gentle enough not to irritate it. I only use this one on my face so I think this tube will last me a year or so :-). When you put it on, it goes on smoothly and is good under make up or by itself by giving the skin kind of pearly complextion</li>
    <li> I burn and tan very easily. I tried this for a month to see if it helped.  And it did. I actually got whiter after one month! I compared my photos from a month ago, and I can see a difference, specially in my arms which seems to burn the fastest.  It isn&#x27;t sticky on your hands after you apply it, perfect for the beach.</li>
    <li> This was a handy sized tube of sunscreen that I was impressed with for several reasons:&lt;br /&gt;#1 I have a hard time finding sunscreen for both UVA and UVB rays so right there it scored points.  Plus the prime shipping is a definite plus on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;#2 I appreciated the tint when applying to the kids.  I worry I miss areas, and sometimes I have in the past and have ended up with stripes myself:-)  My kids liked the tint too since it made them feel grown up like the lifeguards.  Plus, the tint made me feel like I was getting fantastic coverage.&lt;br /&gt;#3 My daughter and I have rather sensitive skin and we didn&#x27;t have to deal with any stinging or rashes afterward.  Major plus!&lt;br /&gt;#4 It was very water resistant and I didn&#x27;t have to reapply at all while we were at the waterpark - an all day event.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing to keep in mind for adults is that the tint can be a minor annoyance on the face if you aren&#x27;t accustomed to one.  Just double check if you are wearing it on your face that you have blended it in very carefully.  I hadn&#x27;t when we went to Great America and walked around for hours with a non-blended patch on the side of my face.  It looks a bit like foundation that didn&#x27;t blend then.</li>
    <li> Three features made this product attractive to me: Its pediatric use and its water-resistant properties, but I especially liked the beige-colored cream, a factor that turned out to be good in theory but not in application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Traditional sunscreens streak white - when both dry and wet - on my children&#x27;s carmel-colored skin. Fallene Cotz SPF 58 blended smoothly into their coloring. Unfortunately, while transparent on their skin, the cream stained the clothing around their necks and upper arms, two areas where we applied the cream most generously. Repeated washings were required to remove the discoloration.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I liked this cream. Its thicker consistency, fragrance and-chemical-free ingredients made me feel as if the protection was safer and better. For swimming, where clothing is not an issue, this is an outstanding product. For everyday use, however, the greasy, white products may work better. Use both for safe sun fun.</li>
    <li> The product works as advertised, which would be a big plus in my book ... IF it didn&#x27;t discolor whatever clothes I happen to be wearing at the time. Didn&#x27;t the people who made this stuff notice how hard it was to get out of their lab coats? That annoyance clearly outweighs the benefits.</li>
    <li> The Cotz Waterproof Sunscreen is a great protective barrier for the skin.  It could be applied to the face like makeup.  I use it in my ears and nose, using a cotton swab, to relieve itching. It is a high-quality product.  It is also useful to leave on the skin for several hours to help suffocate skin parasites.</li>
    <li> As we all are aware UVA / UVB rays are damaging to our skin. I tried several different brands of sun protection that would work with my morning routine of moisturizer and sun less tan lotion.  I needed a sun protection product that would go on evenly, absorb completely, and not \\&quot; run \\&quot; into my eyes later on during the day. I put my moisturizer on first, then Fallene Cortz SPF 58, and then a bronzer. I look as if I have a deep tan, I know I have UVB / UVA protection, and don&#x27;t have to worry about the damaging effects of the sun.  I wear Fallene Cortz SPF 58 on a daily basis, 7 days a week. If you do research on sun protection products, it is mandatory that titanium and zinc are included in the ingredients.  I ask, why have all the other ingredients, when all you need is the ONLY ingredients in Fallene Cortz.</li>
    <li> The ONLY sunscreen to protect my extremely fair skinned child from a sumburn in twelve years! Very waterproof! I bought three more as soon as we got back from our first trip with this sunscreen.  We will never be without this product!</li>
    <li> i have melasma....you can get it from being pregnant (mask of pregnancy),  overexposure to sun, age (age spots), or a combination there of.  anyhow, i am treating this skin darkening with retin-a and hydroquinone which cannot allow your skin to be exposed to sun at all.  enter COTZ......it is the perfect sunblock, and i&#x27;ve tried them all, from ones i&#x27;ve purchased from my dermatologist, to the zinc suggested by the lifeguard.  this stuff isn&#x27;t cheap.....but it&#x27;s worth every penny to keep your skin safe from the sun.  you canactually use your retin-a in the morning to get rid of your wrinkles if you have any, and your acne, and then put the COTZ on top.  you won&#x27;t get any discoloration or dark spots as if usng the retin-a alone.  or i can use my Obagi system and use COTZ on top, and get full coverage while still lightening my skin......i&#x27;m thrilled.</li>
    <li> I have used it for several years and I love it. It does not dry out your skin and goes on smoothly.</li>
    <li> Very protective.  I used it for a month on the beach and my age related dark spots did not get bigger or multiply as they tend to do every year I go to the beach for a month.  You can apply  it about 20 or even 30 minutes before you go out.  The skin absorbs it and then you even put blush on your cheeks.  It holds all day and if you do not dive, you are good to go all day.  No smell, no itching or tingling of the skin.&lt;br /&gt;I even saw that my dark spots got smaller.  Looks like I am going to use it all the time under my make up.</li>
    <li> Powerful sunblock in the form of a brownish lotion (keep it away from your clothes!), my son and I both have fairly sensitive skin, and our skin did fine with it.  It is a little on the thick side, when you apply it, in order to get it to \\&quot;disappear\\&quot; into your skin it takes a good deal of rubbing and spreading.  [but not nearly as bad as the old \\&quot;whiteface\\&quot; zinc sunblock of days of yore!!!] It&#x27;s water \\&quot;resistant\\&quot; (not waterproof) so if you spend a good deal of time in the water you&#x27;ll need to re-apply it.      The box says \\&quot;contains only titanium and zinc\\&quot;, but the list of ingredients on the back is pretty extensive, that kind of thing irritates me.  My cross to bear!      My skin will start to burn if exposed to the sun for about 15 minutes straight.  For 2 hours in the sun, an SPF 16 is plenty for me.  This stuff, though, is SPF 58, which suggests I could spend 14 hours in the sun without burning if I&#x27;m wearing this stuff.  Which I&#x27;ll never do.  So it seems like overkill to use an SPF 58, but I won&#x27;t hesitate to use it on my son if he&#x27;s going to be outdoors for even part of a sunny day.    Oh, it&#x27;s not too greasy, and it doesn&#x27;t stink like coconut, it&#x27;s fairly odorless.  Good product, a tad expensive.</li>
    <li> I love all of the features of this particular sunscreen with regards to it being more \\&quot;natural\\&quot; than other brands. I do not feel that it is anywhere near the price. I used it on myself and on my children. I didn&#x27;t notice a sunblock factor in any way superior to the tradtional spf 30 I&#x27;ve used from many other brands. It still had to be reapplied frequently, as with other brands, it didn&#x27;t smell particularly good and left my skin feeling a bit sticky. I will say that after about 45 minutes of wearing, the \\&quot;sticky\\&quot; feeling goes away, but I noticed a lot of fine bits of dirt and fuzz clinging to my skin, which was annoying. The only big pro I can say about this is that chemically-speaking, it is healthier for the human race and I felt better about putting it on my children than the more chemical-laden products.  On the other hand, there are many other companies producing natural sunblock products costing significantly less then this. Overall, it is a good product, but not good enough to warrant the hefty price tag.</li>
    <li> \\&quot;Fallene Ctoz SPF 58 Water Resistant UVB/UVA Sunsceen for Sensistive skin\\&quot; is quite a mouth-full for, let&#x27;s face it, sunscreen.  Not that&#x27;s it&#x27;s bad sunscreen.  Actually, it&#x27;s quite good.  The color and texture of the product takes a little getting-used-to.  Instead of the oily viscous liquid sunscreen I&#x27;m used to, this sunscreen&#x27;s consistency was more paste-like.  That made it easier to apply...but also tended to make it less spread-able on my skin.  So, I had to use more of it to cover the areas that would be exposed to the deadly-yet-life-giving sun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The color was a nice orangy-tan color.  It was a nice color, but I&#x27;ll admit that I thought it was weird at first.  I&#x27;m used to sunblock coming in one color--white.  My wife, however was excited about the tan color because it wouldn&#x27;t look so weird if you didn&#x27;t rub it in perfectly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did go in the beautiful waters of Wisconsin&#x27;s Castle Rock Lake with the sunblock on.  And, as far as I can tell, the \\&quot;water resistant\\&quot; characteristic is accurate.  Although I was out on the lake for several hours, I didn&#x27;t burn.  So (although I can&#x27;t tell with certaincy), the 58 SPF, UVB/UVA acronyms do seem to hold water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In all, it&#x27;s a pretty good sunblock.  I didn&#x27;t get a whole lot of \\&quot;bang for my buck\\&quot; with it, but what I was able to slather on my body protected me well.  Mildly recommended.</li>
    <li> if you want good pretection for a good price, i recommend this and will continue to use it as an everyday high spf protection(i have very fair skin) &amp; don&#x27;t want any more sun damage ! !</li>
    <li> Well not very much to say about this product except I find it o.k because it goes on smoothly as well as it does not leave that greasy feeling afterwards. Also there is no allergic reaction to it. You can put it on and forget it was ever there.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work - and I have the spots to prove it.  Before I developed an allergy to certain ingredients in high SPF sunblocks, I was able to use a regular sun block of 60, 70, 80 SPF and I was well-protected.  I wish that someone would develop an effective sun block for sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> I am allergic to just about every active ingredient in a normal sun screen. This product provides excellent sun protection without skin irritation or leaving greasy, heavy feeling on you skin. It gets absorbed very quickly, leaves a nice moist feeling on your skin, and is good to use under make-up. For folks with drier skin, use a light moisturizer under this and for all, make sure you wash it off well at night. I think zinc tends to stick around on your skin and can cause irritation for some folks. Also, it does dry a bit pale on your skin, so may not be ideal for people with darker skin tones. Overall, this is the best sun screen I&#x27;ve tried so far, and believe me, I&#x27;ve tried all sorts of &#x27;sensitive skin&#x27; sun protection out there.</li>
    <li> I got this for my mom who uses it as her foundation/sunscreen. There is definitely a tint in the sunscreen, which happens to match my mom&#x27;s rather pale skin. People can almost never tell she has on sunscreen, because it sits without being greasy or oily. She can wear it all day without thinking about it. She&#x27;s been using it for years, and it&#x27;s protected her face very well without looking like sunscreen all over her face.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite tinted high coverage sunscreen. I have been wearing this for years. In the summer I wear it under my make-up or as my make-up depending on what I am doing and where I am going.  It stays on all day, even in a beach setting and it doesn&#x27;t hurt my face. Seriously could NOT live without this stuff.... I have fair skin and I can&#x27;t imagine all the damage it has saved me from....</li>
    <li> Use it everyday now. Best sunscreen so far.</li>
    <li> This is the absolute best sunscreen on the market.  A tube lasts months as I only use it on my face/neck/d&#x27;ecollet&#x27;e.  It uses titanium dioxide and zinc oxide and it reflects the rays rather than absorb them.  I have sensitive skin which hyperpigments and can easily develop melasma; if I am not careful about exposure to sun.  It has become part of my morning routine, I wash my face and put on a couple of layers of Fallene Total Block before I even leave my bathroom in the morning.  I have probably not left home without it for years now. It is the best sunblock I have found and I have probably tried everything that I could find on the market.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. t works well as a sunscreen. It does leave a cosmetic residue that you need to wash off every nite</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always been good about suncare.  While I did not wear sunblock when I was younger, I was careful about staying out of the sun and have managed to get very little sun damage at 45.  In the last 5 years I have been using skin creams with  sunblock and another very expensive product was recommended to me by a dermatologist. The ingredients in Fallene were comparable to the product she suggested.  I had nasty breakouts with a host of other products (even though I don&#x27;t normally have problems with acne).  I have not had this problem with Fallene.     It works really well, I garden, and while I do keep it to early mornings and late afternoons and have not had any darkening of my freckles or any spots or stains on my skin from the sun using this.      My skin tone is  kind of yellow and I burn and scar brown.  My skin is dry so I&#x27;ve found that adding a little moisturizer to the sunscreen helps so it wont flake.  I leave it in about 5 mins or so and then I blend with a sponge to eliminate any white cast. I do not wear foundation and have found that the sunscreen helps in making my skin tone look more even.      I put olive oil on my face before washing to loosen up dirt and the sunscreen so I don&#x27;t experience any issues with getting it off.  Other times I may go over my face with a facial cleansing cloth before washing and that works, too.        I have recommended this product to everyone I know especially women close to or near 40.  Good cleansing and a good sunblock go a long way.</li>
    <li> Does its job!  Great sunscreen</li>
    <li> Solid sun protection with the required ingredients, my Dermatologist recommended it and I replaced Blue lizard with this product, it feels more natural on the skin, only need to apply once a day ... have had skin cancer of all types over the past 12 years and several surgeries, this product is for people who really want to protect themselves from the sun.</li>
    <li> I play golf 4 days a week and this product gives my skin total protection from harmful rays.  The zinc oxide in it is not found in other products on the market.</li>
    <li> Its ok as a sunblock but it doesn&#x27;t blends with your skin, it actually leaves a shade in your face of the color this has.</li>
    <li> It is a good sunscreen, although I prefer the other product of Fallene&#x27;s family, the one with sheer matte.&lt;br /&gt;But this one provides good coverage, fits skin tone and it is non oiky.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful product for those who are pale.  (For reference I wear MAC&#x27;s NW 15.)  The titanium dioxide provides color and makes this into something of a tinted moisturizer.  Some application tips: make sure skin is well exfoliated, and treat this as a foundation allowing it to set while occasionally smoothing.</li>
    <li> This makes my face feel and look great and protects it from the sun burn while swimming in the ocean.</li>
    <li> This sun screen was put to the test while vacationing in central Florida the past week.  I liked the fact that it is tinted.  My husband liked that it did not smell like tropical fruit.  It does however have a slight metallic smell but considering that it is made from two metals it is understandable.    The best indicator that this sunscreen works fantastic is that no one got sunburned while wearing it and after wearing it all day it was visible on the wash cloth after showering.    The product description is true.  Will recommend to my friends.</li>
    <li> This product says it protects sensitive skin against UVA (320-400 billionths of a meter wavelength) &amp; UVB solar radiation (290-320 billionths of a meter wavelength)--&amp; appears to do so.  But, it also claims superiority since it utilizes Titanium Dioxide &amp; Zinc Oxide to do so.  These are more natural than the ingredients in competitive products.  However, together they constitute only 13% of this product; the other 87% includes many, many \\&quot;chemical\\&quot; ingredients.  Still, it&#x27;s probably no worse for you than its competition unless you&#x27;re sensitive to one of these \\&quot;inactive ingredients.\\&quot;  And, frankly, it seems to work quite well.  It has coloring but that does not transfer to the skin when rubbed in.  It has a nice 58 SPF and is water resistant--yet I didn&#x27;t have much trouble washing it off with soap &amp; water.  Didn&#x27;t seem a problem on my skin at all--I didn&#x27;t notice any greasiness or other unpleasantness.  But, the price is rather high--even with the Amazon 1/3 off discount it&#x27;s still not cheap.  So, one has the usual trade-off--do the ends (presumably better/safer protection) justify the means (high cost)?  This is a personal decision for you to make.  Hava grt day, Neal</li>
    <li> This is an incredible product! I&#x27;m hypersensitive to most sunscreens and am tired of the pasty white look after using other titanium dioxide products. This one provides good protection, doesn&#x27;t cause skin reactions, and is invisible on my fair skin.</li>
    <li> I would never use anything else on my face.  I used to buy it from my doctor&#x27;s office so I was happy when I found it here for less.  I gave a tube to my daughter and now she will not use another sun screen either.  No chemicals, it does not make my eyes water and the zinc reduces skin redness.  Love it!</li>
    <li> Recommended by our Dermatologist. Great product. Not greasey but covers well with SPF of 58. 100% frree of Sunscreens &amp; Oils. Have already recommended to other family members.</li>
    <li> Recommended by my husbands dermatologist after skin cancer. Tinted so it doesn&#x27;t look ghostly white.</li>
    <li> Except this one.  Even Neutrogena Pure and Free Baby breaks me out in a itchy rash.  Cotz does not.  I hope the formula is not changed anytime soon.  Yes it&#x27;s thick but you want sunblock to do its job?  I&#x27;d rather fight with a bit of thickness and tint and know I&#x27;m being protected properly than to waste money on a wimpy product.</li>
    <li> I have super sensitive dry skin, and this was wonderful on my face. A little tinted so sometimes it can look like a sloppy foundation job, but I love this s*** so hard. Best sunscreen NA. I put it over my face lotion once that&#x27;s all seeped in. If I don&#x27;t wait, it doesn&#x27;t blend well.</li>
    <li> It truly blocks the sun.  It&#x27;s thick at first, but fades into the skin quickly.  This is the only product that truly protects my face.  I get Melasma very when exposed to the sun, so it&#x27;s easy for me to tell if a product is working or not.  This is the best!</li>
    <li> I have tried every expensive sunscreen made. Every one of them caused my face to breakout. This is the only sunscreen I have used that doesn&#x27;t cause breakout. It does have a white tint but fades a bit.</li>
    <li> excellent product, wife loves this product as it serves her sensitive skin well. She recommends Cotz to all her friends who are looking&lt;br /&gt;for this product line.</li>
    <li> There have been a lot of articles published lately about the issues with sunscreen ingredients. It&#x27;s now highly recommended to use physical block and not chemical block, preferably Titanium Dioxide and Zinc Oxide. For my last big trip I took Badger Brand physical block and found it to be sticky, oily and pasty. None of those problems occurred with Fallene Cotz. The sunscreen is tinted so you don&#x27;t look like a ghost when you put it on (unless you are a person of color). The consistency is fantastic and it goes on clean. I found the sun protection to be excellent and a total experience of this product to be one that would lead me to clearly recommend it!</li>
    <li> This is sunscreen for people with sensitive skin and people who burn easily. It didn&#x27;t irritate our skin and it totally blocked any sun exposure. It does have the color of makeup, but it went on clear. My hands were nowhere near as greasy after applying it as they are with other waterproof rub in sunscreens. That said, I still washed them afterward. I will use this on my fair skinned little daughter&#x27;s face and as a supplement to the normal spray on we use. It&#x27;s great for days you will have high sun exposure.</li>
    <li> I had high hopes for this sunscreen, but was disappointed in so many ways!  Most of my qualms have to do with the tint (like most people).  It&#x27;s just not the same color as my skin, so I look like I have makeup on when I apply it.  What&#x27;s worse, is that I&#x27;m a guy with hair on my arms and chest, so if I apply the sunscreen, the tint goes on my body hair, making it look pinkish-purplish, which is embarrassing and gross!  Finally, the tint WILL rub off on your clothes.  I knew this beforehand, so I didn&#x27;t wear anything white, but it did come off on my shirt.  So basically, I can only wear this sunscreen when I&#x27;m going swimming and won&#x27;t be wearing a shirt or sitting in a car, and don&#x27;t care if people look at me weird for having freaky-colored body hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the positive side, this is an attempt at a healthier sunscreen.  I didn&#x27;t get burnt when I wore it, so it works.  It&#x27;s just that an untinted version would turn skin chalky white, which is probably just as bad.  I feel like Fallene Cotz could do a really good job with this, they just need to figure out a better recipe.  I only recommend this to people whose skin color it matches (which is especially hard to figure out without trying it first) and who don&#x27;t have body hair.</li>
    <li> My 5-year-old son has extremely sensitive skin and we live at the beach.  He spends a lot of time in the sun, and COTZ did a great job keeping the delicate skin on his face and neck burn-free and soft.  COTZ went on easily and did not cause rashes or any other skin problems, and it also did not bother his eyes as so many sunscreens do.</li>
    <li> Excellent product. Easy to apply, and during a warm/hot spell, it does NOT run into your eyes like so many other products. (Also, it contains the chemicals most recommended by the medical profession.)</li>
    <li> Cotz works fine as a sunscreen. The sunscreen texture is more like a paste than a lotion. The sunscreen also has a brown hue which will leave a brown smudge on white clothes if you are not careful.</li>
    <li> I have been using the Fallene Cotz SPF 58 sunscreen for a few weeks now. I wear sunscreen every day no matter what my plans are. This sunscreen has the qualities that are important to me.  It is completely fragrance free. It is matte and therefore does not leave my face shiny.  It&#x27;s gentle and does not sting.  It blends with my skin, leaving no trace.     My only criticism is that my makeup does not glide on as smoothly as it does when I use Aveeno Positively Ageless moisturizer (with SPF 30).  For anyone who does not wear makeup, this would be a perfect sunscreen.  If you do wear makeup, it&#x27;s certainly worth a try.  Perhaps it would help to apply a light moisturizer before putting on the sunscreen.    It is reasonably priced for a sunscreen that you will apply to your face and neck, but would be too expensive to use as a whole body sunscreen.  For that I use a Coppertone oil-free sunscreen which is significantly less expensive.    I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I burn pretty easy and I also have many tattoos that I don&#x27;t want fading, so a good sunblock is important to me.  This block work very well and is not greasy, it is almost like calamine lotion or something that you would put on a bug bite.  It is not clear when it goes on, I noticed especially over the darker areas of my tattoos where it made them look old and faded which is what I&#x27;m trying to avoid so I thought that was somewhat ironic.  I like that it has very few ingredients, less to cause irritation or who knows what else.  It also seems to stay on pretty well although I have not actually tried going in the water yet with it, so I&#x27;m not sure about that one yet.  But if you are looking for a simple, high SPF sun block and don&#x27;t mind it looking a little white when it is on, this is a good choice.</li>
    <li> We are half-way through summer, spent many days out in the sun hiking or on the beach and no burns thanks to diligent use of this product. All but one member of our family needs a high SPF, but with the increase of skin cancers, we opt for the water resistant, high SPF factors even if we tan easily. I was able to use this product on my face, which is sensitive, with no rashes or irritation. Last year by this time we&#x27;d had at least one sunburn with either myself or family members. We used Cotz according to directions and so far have had no burns!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Chrissy K. McVay  -  Author</li>
    <li> I am a redhead with very fair skin; so are my two little girls.  I am able to stay in the sun during the hottest part of the day, swimming, and I do not burn.  This is the best sun screen bar none.  My girls and I were in the sun from about 10:30 AM until 1:00 PM; swimming and sitting for awhile.  The sun&#x27;s rays are always more apt to burn when reflected by water.  None of us had even a pink spot, and this was a blazing hot, direct sun day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The water resistant aspect of a very strong sunscreen is just one of the many aspects that makes this product the best on the market.  My skin felt smoother, my eyes didn&#x27;t burn as they so often do with other protectors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the first time I&#x27;ve used a product that blocks UVB and UVA rays --I didn&#x27;t even know there was a problem.  But when I get out of the pool and clean up -- I am not burned anywhere.  I do not think there is another product on the market that could beat this one for protecting and moisturing your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enjoy swimming, walking in the sun, jogging on a sunny or overcast day and feel safe knowing that your skin will be protected.  You won&#x27;t have a very uncomfortable burn of any kind.  One of the other really nice features is that there is a slight aroma and it is lovely, and it fades fast ... so even if perfumes, body fragrances, men&#x27;s cologne bother you -- this won&#x27;t.  The color is a light tan, but it blends into your skin, so even I, miss whiter than white, looked a little tan. (It washed off easily.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a kid I got burned badly at the beach; I haven&#x27;t spent much time in the sun since then.  I&#x27;ve used products as they came out, but they didn&#x27;t protect me well.  I love being able to go swim any time of the day.  An early morning swim with the sun rising and already covering the pool, or a late afternoon.  I don&#x27;t burn.  This is a miracle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Have fun in the sun!</li>
    <li> This stuff is waterproof for real. It doesn&#x27;t sting my eyes, all others do sting. My friends are always telling me how red my eyes are. It is skin color.  It does not dry clear, and it is the only sunscreen to give me zits. It is so uncomfortable that I cannot wait to get it off after I get out of the water. It turns my wash rag skin color. It&#x27;s the most effective sunscreen I have tried, and I&#x27;ve tried most.</li>
    <li> This product caused a rash on my face and neck so it is not as advertised \\&quot; for sensitive skin\\&quot; and it dried the skin worse than being in the sun! I would not purchase again.  Why is it so difficult to find a good sunscreen?   Very frustrated..... had hoped this would be a great solution with all the 5 star reviews.</li>
    <li> Great brand, highly endorsed by my dermatologist.  Not easy to find offline, so happy to find it here.</li>
    <li> Wonderfully tinted coverage for the face. Use instead of your daily makeup.</li>
    <li> When a product claims it&#x27;s good for sensitive skin, I&#x27;m skeptical.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin is so fair I have a blue glow, so I need sunscreen.  I also have sensitive skin with rosacea, so most non-prescription products cause a bad reaction.  Commercial sunscreens combined with a bit of perspiration turn into something like battery acid on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After an hour in the sun with the Fallene Cotz I hadn&#x27;t burned; I wasn&#x27;t even pink.  Even more exciting, I didn&#x27;t have the usual welts I get from most creams and lotions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The package says that this is a non-chemical sunscreen.  It contains titanium oxide and zinc oxide, two ingredients I would expect to form a very thick white paste, but surprisingly it dries almost clear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m amazed and excited that Fallene Cotz lives up to it&#x27;s claim  of being extra gentle for sensitive skin.  This really worked out well for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FOLLOW UP - Today I had an appointment with my dermatologist and pulled the tube out of my purse to get his opinion.  He was quite familiar with Fallene Cotz and confirmed my own impression that this is an excellent product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m allergic to just about any sunscreen once it gets to my face and this didn&#x27;t bother me at all.  It is a zinc oxide preparation so it is still a little chalky, but I let it dry, put makeup over it, and no probs.  And I was out all day with no discernible tan or burn.</li>
    <li> This couldn&#x27;t have been offered to me at a better time. A time when I was getting ready to go to Israel. And I&#x27;m glad I took this with me because it is very hot there during the summer and I was out in the sun almost on a daily basis (sometimes for hours on end).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; One day I spent four hours in the sun which is when I used this product the most and it really, really did what it was supposed to do which I am happy about because had I not used it, I might have ended up badly burned over half my body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  I recommend this product if your planning a day on the beach or a vactaion to a hot place.</li>
    <li> My friend tried this one since ordinarily  most sunscreen makes her break out a lot.  This one didn&#x27;t, which was good for her.  It kept her from getting burned, and didn&#x27;t cause her to break out.  So I guess it&#x27;s good.  It lasted about as long as a normal sunscreen and she re-applied it after about 4 hours.  It wasn&#x27;t greasy like some are, but when she sweats, it tends to leave....white streaks, oddly.  It&#x27;s weird, and this gets a 3 out of 5 because of it.  Another thing: the smell is standard chemical smelling sunscreen. It&#x27;s ok, but not the best.</li>
    <li> My dermatologist recommended I wear this since it is the simplest sunscreen available - hardly any chemicals - almost pure zinc. I love it.</li>
    <li> I had tried so many different kinds of sunscreen /sunblock but would always end up with redness and rashes on skin (face/arms and legs). This one really works well for me. After a long while of trial and error... I finally found the right one. I gave it a four-star because I would prefer it even better if it&#x27;s in a clear cream. Overall - it serves the purpose. The price came out cheaper compared to health stores I went to. Yes! I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> my dermatologist recommended this</li>
    <li> Would not buy again, although I&#x27;m sure it serves it&#x27;s purpose.  I found that it just never seemed to dry completely, especially on the face.  If you put enough on per directions to get good coverage it just kind of sat there and if your face is damp from the heat at all, it just wiped right off.  It also stained a couple of items I was wearing with a makeup color tint (which it has).  The stains did seem to wash out, but kind of ruined the stuff I was wearing for the day.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. I swim in the ocean almost every day and live in Hawaii. It is the ONLY sunscreen I know of that does not burn your eyes in the water even if it is on your eyelids. I wear it as a foundation much of the time too since it protects so well.</li>
    <li> This product has worked great and does not leave any oily residue. You can easily apply make-up over it.&lt;br /&gt;I will by this producy again.</li>
    <li> consistent , reliable</li>
    <li> this was prescribed by our dermatologist and works indeed very well. It doesn&#x27;t leave white residues on the skin, which is important.</li>
    <li> Zinc based sunscreen is the only thing that blocks UV rays, all others are just lotion. I was told by my skin doctor to get this kind. So read the labels to make sure they have zinc in them before buying. I love the stuff.</li>
    <li> Given that I have extremely fair skin (my standard joke is that my melanin count is measured in negative integers), I rarely head outdoors without at least an SPF 15 on board (this is pretty safe because I&#x27;m indoors most of the time anyway). So even though I&#x27;m pretty happy with my current protection, given that my skin is quite sensitive, I was glad to have the opportunity to give this a try. It turned out to have its pluses and minuses.  My primary concern is protection for my face and it turns out that this really isn&#x27;t appropriate. On the plus side, it didn&#x27;t irritate my skin at all--a minor miracle, especially during the sweaty dog-days of July (this could be due to its being PABA-free). But not only is it too heavy to function as a moisturizer that can be worn under my light base, it&#x27;s occlusive as well (translation: guaranteed clogged pores). So I&#x27;m afraid this will never find its way onto my face again.  On the plus side, I liked it fine for the rest of the exposed me. It worked well on my hands, chest, and neck and even though I still found it somewhat sticky, I guess this is to be expected with heavy-duty sunscreens. To be honest, I don&#x27;t spend enough time in the sun to know if this would protect me from burning over a long period of time, but it&#x27;s fine at least for the short term (did I mention how easily I burn?). All in all, it seems to be an effective product; however, the lab that develops a lightweight, high-SPF sunscreen that&#x27;s non-occlusive, appropriate for sensitive skin, and can double as a facial moisturizer is going to attract a VERY sizable customer base.</li>
    <li> Within 30 minutes of applying this product, I had a rash on my chest, arms and calves and was a little itchy.  Maybe I was just more sensative then the other reviewers.  As other reviews have stated, you get a weird tint to your skin after applying what is supposed to be a dries clearly product.  It also left me feeling oily.  I ended up washing it off and trying to give it away.  Nobody wanted it.  Not that I can blame them.</li>
    <li> One of my kids has very sun-sensitive skin, and this is one of the few products she can use safely.  While vacationing in Cancun, our whole family only put in on once, and it lasts a few hours in and out of the water.  A little goes a long way too, as compared to the Bullfrog Gel Sunscreen formulas.  My complaint is, this sunscreen is tinted so it stains your bathing suit quite a bit.  Also, it feels more sticky than the Bullfrog Gel formulas that we&#x27;re more accustomed to; takes much longer to dry and you almost have to rub the product in so your skin doesn&#x27;t look pasty-white.</li>
    <li> I bought this product because I was going to Las Vegas and it was on  the EWG(Environmental Working Group)list of sunscreen products that was deemed \\&quot;less harmful\\&quot; &amp; effective.  Almost all of the more well-known  suncreens got poor ratings.  There were a few other brands that scored  better, but either they were too expensive or out of stock.  Anyhow,  in my opinion, applying the product was not too bad. It spread fairly  easy, no smell, and not as oily as most of the other products.  However,  the biggest drawbacks are clothing stains &amp; the off white cast it leaves  on the skin.  This product stains everything it comes in contact.  My  advice would be to only wear clothing that is washable, because it  seems to come of the clothing when washed.  Avoid clothing that has to   be dry-cleaned.  The bottom line is does the consumer really know how  well any of these products work or do they work at all?  So all anyone  can do until something better comes along, is to use a product that is  recommended by a non-biased group &amp; cover up.</li>
    <li> This is the best sunscreen available for those looking for full coverage.  Especially recommended for those with melasma or dark spots on the face.  I use this product year-round and it is well worth the price.  I also have no complaints regarding the tint - not sure why others have a problem but if you blend in completely, you should have no coloring issues.</li>
    <li> So this relatively works well, but I didn&#x27;t realize that I purchased the tinted version and so it stained my clothes, swimsuits, towels. As long as you apply it before you get into the pool by at least 30 minutes it stays on and does its job. I burn very easily and i think i still burned my upper arms and back because i didn&#x27;t let it dry long enough, and i did not rub it in to small sections. Overall, a pretty good product, but just pay close attention to the type you&#x27;re getting. Will get non tinted version next time so that all my clothes don&#x27;t look like they&#x27;re covered in foundation.</li>
    <li> As summer approaches, I&#x27;m hearing more and more about protecting myself from skin cancer risk factors.  I&#x27;m sure there&#x27;s a cyclic (seasonal) nature to this type of news article, but since I have pale skin and a family history of skin cancer (non-melanoma), I&#x27;d like to do what I can to protect myself on a daily basis.  I drive to work and have a window office, and I&#x27;m outside some every day to walk my dog.  I&#x27;d previously had a very bad reaction to a chemical sunscreen, so I tried Cotz because the name is short for &amp;#34;contains only titanium and zinc&amp;#34; -- no chemical sunscreens in this stuff!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Stays on for a long time (can actually still feel it 8-10 hours later)&lt;br /&gt;*SPF 58&lt;br /&gt;*Doesn&#x27;t cause sensitive skin reactions&lt;br /&gt;*Although the product is tinted, I can&#x27;t see the tint when I rub this into my skin (it&#x27;s fairly close to my skin tone, maybe a little darker)&lt;br /&gt;*For a high-SPF mineral sunscreen, this applies/spreads fairly well&lt;br /&gt;*I don&#x27;t notice a smell (or if there is one, it&#x27;s faint and pleasant)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Gets all over your clothes.  I have been using this for three days.  The first day, I put it on my arms and neck after getting dressed and noticed that it had gotten on the ends of my sleeves.  So the next day I put it on before putting on my shirt.  And it got EVERYWHERE.  I spent 15 minutes trying to rub it out of my shirt and pants.  (It transferred to my black pants just from resting my forearm against my leg for a moment.)  The third day, I used a little less and (crossing my fingers), so far I haven&#x27;t noticed any stains.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For what it&#x27;s worth, it does seem to come out of my clothes in the washing machine.  And one thing that helped rub it out of the clothes I was already wearing was pantyhose.  I&#x27;d heard pantyhose could be rubbed on deodorant stains, and that works, so I tried rubbing pantyhose on the sunscreen stains on my clothes, and that worked reasonably well, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I may try a few other mineral sunscreens to see if I can find one that doesn&#x27;t get all over my clothes.  But, I&#x27;ve found that carefully controlling the amount I use and rubbing it in well minimizes the transfer to clothing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think this would be excellent for beach or pool wear (you really have to scrub in the shower to get it off) and for anyone who can&#x27;t wear chemical sunscreens but wants to use high SPF products.  Just be careful when you apply it.try a few other mineral sunscreens to see if I can find one that doesn&#x27;t get all over my clothes.

    <li> The sample that I have does not &amp;#34;blend translucent&amp;#34; as it says on the box. It is tinted and if it matches your skin then this is a great product.  If it is too light can look terrible and chaulky.</li>
    <li> works great, but we already new that! came the day after I ordered it!! Long lasting and great protection for my husband who works outdoors.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this sunscreen for years. It&#x27;s always on under my makeup (when I wear it). I swear it even helps to set my make up (kind of like a primer) when I put it on. I love how it isn&#x27;t greasy and absorbs quickly.</li>
    <li> This sun care product is by far one of the best on the market.  It was recommended by my Dermatologist to replace my $$$ Skinceutical face lotion.  Cotz Plus applies smoothly,has no odor, and does not leave the white ghost mess on my face. The product color is lightly tinted and melts evenly on my skin. I am a tennis player and master gardener and this product protects my skin like a body guard!&lt;br /&gt;  Cathy G</li>
    <li> I found this product suited my skin type above other products I had tried for requirements for a sunscreen in our harsh Australian  environment.</li>
    <li> Weird color, makes skin look a little off and it made my skin hurt so i stopped using it, i wouldn&#x27;t buy it again and have an extra tube</li>
    <li> I am caucasian with light-to-medium skin and find that this sunscreen creates a haze/mask when applied, especially if undiluted with other moisturizers.  It would be perfect for someone with fair, porcelain skin, but anyone with a bit of colour might experience this.  (In terms of skin colour, I&#x27;m a Bare Minerals Medium Beige.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To some degree, this sunscreen is almost like a primer, or a tinted moisturizer, ideal for oily skin types.  I have normal to dry skin, and find that I must apply my standard serum &amp; moisturizer beneath this or my face will feel dry &amp; tight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have not experienced the colour rubbing off on anything like other reviewers, although I am careful to not apply too much, or come in contact with my clothes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This sunscreen did protect my face from burning during a week in Mexico, where I did apply it quite liberally each morning.  At one point, my boyfriend commented that the lotion looked a bit cake-y -- I&#x27;m not sure if this was after swimming -- but the lotion definitely protected my face from any burns.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you do have fair skin, on the oily side, this lotion is ideal!</li>
    <li> This is the best sunscreen I have found for the face.  It is very effective against burning, and is moisturizing at the same time.  It also seems to have a bit of a natural tint, so it smooths and evens out my complexion without needing to wear make-up.  I have used it for about 8 years now, and will continue to do so as long as they make it.</li>
    <li> I brought this product to use while in Hawaii. The application process was so frustrating!! It took forever to absorb itself and even after it did...it left your skin looking patchy and white. I have dark skin and there was no way I could go out with a coat of white all over my skin. I tried several times without any luck.</li>
    <li> I needed a physical sunblock that was clean and gentle and not too oily for daily use. I don&#x27;t plan to go to the beach, camping or partake in any activities that would require me to be under the sun for housr at a time, but when I do get out of the house for errands or whatnot, I like to be protected, so I wear this stuff and it&#x27;s actually pretty good, feels light and not too oily and I feel safe.</li>
    <li> This formula did not blend easily, stained my shirts and was chalky.  Try Ulta instead.  I found it through my laser center&#x27;s office.</li>
    <li> It is nice and creamy and not greasy feeling.  It is also nice that it is lightly tinted so that you don&#x27;t look extremely pale unlike other sunscreens.  We love it.</li>
    <li> I keep one, the other goes to my mom, we both are really happy with the product, and can tell it works! I even use it as a foundation and don&#x27;t have to use any makeup. And yes, like the other tinted sunscreens, it will stain your clothes. I&#x27;m switching to another brand after years of wearing it, mostly because I was waiting for this product to come with a flip top... I keep on loosing the caps and it&#x27;s the second time that my whole make up drawer is covered with this product... also if there&#x27;s no cap, the product tends to dry out and does not work well.</li>
    <li> I have allergic reactions to many types of sunscreen, even those made for sensitive skin. I would break out in rash and bumps whenever applying on different spf sunscreen. Tried so many different brands with no success, until this one. Works great! No skin reaction! Will probably be sticking to this brand from now on!</li>
    <li> The sunscreen works great, BUT do not wear white or very light clothing.  It will leave a stain that will not completely come out in washing.</li>
    <li> I have been 9 degrees north of the equator in Guanacaste, Costa Rica for two weeks now. I use Cotz on my face and shoulders, reapplying each time I surf or head out for some serious sun. Cotz goes on easy and thin while still offering amazing protection. While I&#x27;m exposing myself to quite a bit of sun (I&#x27;m a surfer, I can&#x27;t help it) Cotz helps me prevent not only burning, but redness and sun irritation as well. This is a wonderful formula with a slight tint so you don&#x27;t get the white chalky look of some zinc based products. It&#x27;s odorless too!</li>
    <li> This sunscreen is the best protection and coverage sunscreen that I have found.  It is also flesh colored, which is a plus.  It is more expensive that other sunscreens, but well worth it!</li>
    <li> With a bag full of other not so great face sunlotions, Love this stuff. I alternate between this one &amp; the one for faces. It seems to stay on all day, though would re-apply at beach. Doesn&#x27;t irritate or cause breakouts. Works fine under makeup if you let it set in. A must for my sun sensitive skin. Think my skin feels softer after using. I use very little &amp; only on face. Think it would be too costly for body use &amp; I don&#x27;t have skin reactions elsewhere.</li>
    <li> Easy to apply and good protection  provides a light tint for skin tone so can be used as a make up.</li>
    <li> This is the only sunscreen I have found that does not eventually find it&#x27;s way into my daughters eyes.  The typical sunscreen chemicals aren&#x27;t in Cotz. We swear by it...especially for youth sports and beach vacations.  Although it is tinted, it goes on easily and is invisible once on.</li>
    <li> It says that the only ingredients are zinc and titanium oxides. That is not true - there are 22 other chemicals listed in the fine print on the tube. Just thought you&#x27;d like to know.</li>
    <li> Best sunscreen I&#x27;ve ever used!  It moisturizes and protects!  I don&#x27;t feel it, it&#x27;s not heavy and works great!  I use this product primarily on my face so I like the tint in the cream. It feels wonderful and doesn&#x27;t clog my pores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried the same brand spf 40 for sensitive skin, it&#x27;s good too, but overall I prefer this one.  I&#x27;m certain it&#x27;s making my skin look younger!</li>
    <li> I love this product have bought it for years directly from the company.  I bought one on amazon and it was almost an empty  tube--it had 3 little squirts in it.  I&#x27;ll never buy it from amazon again.  signed ripped off.</li>
    <li> This product is full of deleterious substances disguised as additives.  It is also too thick and too greasy for me.</li>
    <li> This is a really good sunscreen, it works well at blocking the sun rays. You&#x27;ll get a slight tan, but it really helps to prevent getting very dark.  If you like to tan, this product will prevent  a dark tan to occur.  I use the Cotz Face sunscreen, and my face is much lighter than the rest of my body.  It doesn&#x27;t have the chemicals that regular sunscreen has. It&#x27;s better for the skin. My only problem is that it has a tint to it, so if you are a darker person of color, it may leave your skin looking ashy or dry looking.  To combat this I use lotion, then I apply the Cotz on the rest of my body. This leave the skin with a slight glow to it.</li>
    <li> This is the only sunscreen I could find without the toxic, synthetic agents so common in many products.&lt;br /&gt;Those afformentioned substances block UV-B, however mix with UV-A ( the &amp;#34;A&amp;#34; band ultraviolet wavelength) to produce a greater risk of skin carcinomas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not so with zinc-oxide and titanium-dioxide, both of which are present organically (i.e., not synthetically produced).&lt;br /&gt;Since I have rosacea, this is a must-have, despite the high cost. Besides, it dosen&#x27;t take that much of it for head, face, and neck protection. (Yes, I&#x27;m bald so I cover all three).&lt;br /&gt;Viva La France!</li>
    <li> Before I started using Cotz, I was constantly undergoing surgery for skin cancer on my face, even though I used a sunscreen recommended by my dermatologist. Since I started using Cotz for both my face and arms, I hardly even have precancer spots that require freezing, and I also need fewer regular dermatologist appointments. I also like the tinting, as I don&#x27;t like to wear makeup, but the added color does help to even out my natural skin tone.</li>
    <li> All the Fallene products are great for the sun and this is no exception. It also covers up age spots on bare legs!!!</li>
    <li> I am in my mid-30s and since I was a teenager I&#x27;ve used well over 20 brands of sunblock, all over SPF 15.  Fallene Cotz is the ONLY sunblock I&#x27;ve used that does not irritate my skin, does not feel like a mask, does not cause me to sweat (my skin can breathe!), does not feel greasy, goes on smoothly, provides complete tanning prevention, and is affordable (unlike cosmetic counter sunblocks).  I recently switched from Proactiv sunscreen SPF 20 to Cotz.  Since Proactiv was developed by dermatologists, I assumed it would be ideal.  Not quite.  Proactiv left my face feeling like I had on a cellophane mask.  It was greasy, and when I began to perspire, it melted.  Yuck!  Cotz does none of that and I get better tanning prevention!  Cotz  has a slight beige tint to it which helps since titanium dioxide is white.  Just blend evenly over face and neck and forget about it!   &lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is that shipping directly from Fallene took over 4 weeks.  I would recommend getting it from another shipper or order it early enough.</li>
    <li> Great color, texture, finish. Perfect for sensitive skin. I now use it instead of a foundation.</li>
    <li> This product went on easily, covered well and then blended in flawlessly.  Excellent product. My regular foundation went over the product without any problems. I felt protected all day.</li>
    <li> Best sunblock I have tried.  Great coverage and it is tinted so it doesn&#x27;t make me look pasty white.  I spend time outdoors on a daily basis and this is the only product I have used that has truly provided protection from the sun.  And at this price point it is an absolute bargain compared to what I have paid at the doctor&#x27;s office or the spa.</li>
    <li> Which is good, because I break out easily. This is the first time I&#x27;ve ever used sensitive skin sunscreen, so I have no real basis for comparison.  I will continue to use it though.</li>
    <li> I ordered 5 different sunscreens to use on my face to try out which was best.  This was the best.  Not greasy and really works!</li>
    <li> I love this sunscreen for extremely fair, super sensitive skin. It is tinted to match light skin tones so it doesn&#x27;t make your face white and chalky like other zinc oxide sunscreens. It covers well, and has a matte finish so I don&#x27;t need to wear foundation or a BB cream on days that I wear this sunscreen. I save this stuff for days at the beach or when I&#x27;m going to be spending a lot of time outside because it is a little heavy, but even with repeated application throughout the day my skin doesn&#x27;t look too shiny or oily. It also works! I feel very protected from the sun with zero irritation.</li>
    <li> I like the nutrients for your skin that are in this product, and I think it is helping with camoflage of skin bumps caused by mites. It also seems to kind of seal the areas so that they don&#x27;t get worse and even seem to dry out a bit. Overall, a really good product. (A bit expensive.)</li>
    <li> I have only had this product for about a week. I will update this review if pertinent information evolves as time goes by.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I live in the desert and commute 2 hours a day during peak sun exposure hours. A friend recently pointed out that my left arm is darker than my right arm, from \\&quot;commuter&#x27;s tan\\&quot; and I realized I need to be better about sunscreen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other reviewers have mentioned a red residue that flakes off on clothing. I have very yellow undertones, my skin gets very dark, so maybe this is part of it, but I have not had any problems with residue from this product. In fact, it makes me look more light-skinned than I am used to. Not in a bad, zinc-nosed kind of way; it is smooth. But it&#x27;s like a base to other make up and it blends well with my skin tone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The thing I like most about this product is that it makes my skin feel truly moisturized. I have used oil-free sunscreens before but they leave my skin feeling dry and in need of another product to moisturize. This product kills two birds with one stone. Throughout the day my skin feels plush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I apply this product twice a day, before driving to work and before driving home. This is because of another reason I like this product, which is that it lists all well-established sun-saftey advice on its label. I am a certified health education specialist and I appreciate that it explains its uses and limits clearly for the average user. It recommends reapplication every 2 hours or after 45 minutes of heavy sweating or water exposure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have acne-prone skin and have not had problems with this product so far. Again, I will update this review if that changes. But as far as a multi-purpose product goes, this is the best I have tried so far--moisturizer &amp; sunscreen.</li>
    <li> I love this sunscreen for my face.  It is not oily or greasy and feels good on my skin unlike a lot of other facial sunscreens.</li>
    <li> kind of leaves a shiny coating on my skin. Will use it when I exercise outside. Will use my other favorite when I need to apply makeup over the sunscreen</li>
    <li> I love this product! It goes on smoothly and leaves my skin looking pretty amazing and best of all it does not melt off my face. My dermatologist recommended this product after I complained again and again about my experience with other sunscreens, all of which were too heavy and I end up \\&quot;sweating it off\\&quot;, it was pretty annoying and embarrassing and I would rather walk out without any protection at all (very bad with a person with melasma). Not anymore! This product is so lite and easy to wear, I can even apply my coat of medication underneath and it still does not feel heavy.&lt;br /&gt;I love it and will recommended without hesitation!</li>
    <li> My dermatologist gave me a sample of Cotz sunscreen.  I bought it with his recommendation.  It is a non-greasy formula so you don&#x27;t feel sticky.  I think you would also like it.</li>
    <li> It does the job, but I have to wash it off every evening.  I will continue to use it.  I haven&#x27;t found anything better.</li>
    <li> I swim a lot outdoors in south Florida and am tan enough usually that I don&#x27;t get a burn.  But my face does get pink sometimes and I needed something to keep the sun off it that wouldn&#x27;t come off as I swim.  I had tried for many years to find this miracle product with no luck.  Everything I tried was no match for an hour at a time of swimming.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then I found this.  Now I can swim for an hour or more and not have a bit of sun damage or redness to my skin.  It is definitely gooey and greasy feeling, but for me that&#x27;s a good thing.  That is why it stays on in the water.  And yes it IS hard to wash off, but again, that is what I was looking for.  It feels similar to vaseline on the skin.  It even beads up the water a bit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t find the flesh toned tint to be a problem at all.  I know this would be chalk white, and make my face look greyish-white, due to the titanium, if it weren&#x27;t flesh tinted.  It is an exact match to my light beige skin.  I can&#x27;t see it on my face at all. It blends perfectly.  I have medium warm skintone.  I love this stuff and am so happy I finally found something I can swim in and that is strong enough to keep the  afternoon sun off my skin in the tropics.  I wouldn&#x27;t wear this as an everyday sunscreen due to the greasiness, but for someone who is outdoors in the sun a lot, and in the water, it&#x27;s perfect.</li>
    <li> great product,great coffee, I recommend this BUNN coffee maker</li>
    <li> This product was recommended to me when my son ended up with stitches in his cheek.  It has been such a great product to help me protect his scar from the sun, and now I&#x27;ve started using it and love it too.  Works great for active outdoor people.</li>
    <li> Works great.  Goes on well and seems to really protect.  I use it everyday after my moisturizer.</li>
    <li> excellent product, i wanted to love it but it&#x27;s too thick for me for daily use. i bought the tinted version and i like that it&#x27;s tinted but i&#x27;m not crazy about the texture because i can&#x27;t wear this under my make-up, it would just melt off.</li>
    <li> Sur les 3 produits COTZ achetes, c&#x27;est celui que j&#x27;ai le moins aimé au niveau de la texture. A ma prochaine commande je vérifirai si il existe un autre produit SPF 58.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for seven years now and I love it! I apply it every day after my moisturizer.</li>
    <li> The best sunblock ever.  I&#x27;ve used this for over 20 years and wouldn&#x27;t use anything else, its an excellent product.</li>
    <li> When I purchased this product the seller had a picture of the tube inside that looked exactly like what I usually buy.  I usually purchase Fallene Cotz spf 58 and it comes in a tube that is blue with an orange circle behind Fallene Cotz.  Anyway they showed the blue tube with orange circle in the picture so I assumed they must have changed the packaging but it is definitely not the same product.  It does not feel as good on my skin and it made my daughter&#x27;s face breakout and she never has a problem with acne.  The Fallene Cotz that I usually buy works awesome for my skin and I have used it for almost a decade and my daughter has used it for 5 years but this Cotz plus is definitely not the same.</li>
    <li> Protects skin but is also a wonderful primer for makeup -- actually I can often use this alone and some blush...no foundation needed in daytime.&lt;br /&gt;Great product - have been using it for years...</li>
    <li> I have used this product for many years, since being diagnosed with Rosacea. The sun is your biggest enemy if you have this skin disorder, and Cotz really does a fantastic job, in keeping your  face safe in the sun.</li>
    <li> I love the stuff, can use it everyday without skin getting red and sensitive. Over time it reduced &amp;#34;sun spots.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> you can use it on your face it doesn&#x27;t  sting your eyes.</li>
    <li> Well I had heard good things about this sunscreen. It is expensive, but I have sensitive skin and was going to give it a try. When I received it I noticed it had Parabens in it.  They are one of the chemicals I avoid, so I immediately returned it.</li>
    <li> Continues to meet and satisfy all my requirements...</li>
    <li> This is the best product for skin I have ever used. I have hyperpigmentation, sensitive skin and tend to break out from many products...this one is non greasy, gives an irridescent coverage with the slightest hint of color and even appears to even out skin tone!  I use it every day year round even when I don&#x27;t need the sun protection! It is a must try. For those of you who don&#x27;t know, zinc has anti-inflammatory properties which nourish you skin too and this product is loaded with it!</li>
    <li> Wonderful sun protection for anyone, for those of us with sensitive skin and those who want to avoid unnecessary chemicals that could cause problems in the future.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had skin rashes from allergies/sensitivities for years, and about four years ago I also developed eczema.  I have extremely pale skin and need serious sun protection.  In winter I simply wrap a scarf around my face whenever I am outside, but that is not practical in warm weather.  I was a long-time user of a brand of sunscreen that went off the market two years ago.  I have struggled to find another sunscreen/block that I could tolerate.  Many burn when I put them on and most either caused or aggravated skin problems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not so with this fantastic product.  I&#x27;ve been using it for three weeks and I love it.  When I started using it, the skin on my face was in the worst shape ever and I was in agony.  Not only did this product not irritate my skin, but it actually seemed to soothe it.  I felt the difference immediately, and the redness, swelling, itching and burning disappeared within two days of use.  In a few days, my skin was back to being soft and smooth.  What a relief!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also tried the Fallene Total Block Clear last summer, and that also seemed to work, although I was not having many skin problems at the time so the conditions were not as extreme.  In other words, it did not irritate my skin, but whether it had the same soothing qualities, I cannot say.  I would not hesitate to recommend either product to anyone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I should add that neither Fallene product caused any acne-type problems, unlike a few other skin products I have tried.</li>
    <li> My dermatologist recommended this, and I have been using it for years.  I like that it has a slight tint ; I get the best look by mixing it with a little moisturizer. it has no scent , which is important to me. It works great and it looks great - what more can you ask for?</li>
    <li> I asked myself what I wanted in a product and this one has it all! I have tried many other quality brands and this one Fallene COTZ has the whole package: Good Price/Nice size tube, Tinted-doesn&#x27;t have that white chalky color like other UVA/UVB products, Does not break me out!! High SPF/FULL spectrum UVA/UVB!, Water-Resistant, Great for my kid&#x27;s faces too and it works! I have been using this product for 3 1/2 years now and living in TX with hot summer months...you are bound to sweat and bound to burn or for sure get sun damage on your face if you don&#x27;t use an excellent product.</li>
    <li> I found this product through a plastic surgeons office - it was a sample. Ever since, I use every day and won&#x27;t ever use anything else on my face but this.  It works and I get compliments all the time on the smoothness of my skin; I&#x27;m 42 years old and an equestrian, in the sun for most of the day so I needed a BLOCK.  I heard they may change from tube to bottle which would be a shame as I am totally sold on squeezing out the last drop on any product.  I used the other \\&quot;mix your base color with block\\&quot; from this company, and it, too was good.  The only drawback is that this looks a little greasy at times - but because of the built in tint, it gives a sheer coverage that is really attractive...</li>
    <li> My dermatologist recommended that i use this block.  Love it-  has the protection of zinc oxide without the lifeguard white chalk on your face.    Price at amazon was a big savings from the dermatologist&#x27;s office too.</li>
    <li> My dermatologist no longer recommends this product. According to him, there are better produts out there in 2013  Over the last year, the makers of this product appear to have changed hands, and it does not feel as good on the skin as the orignal product in the blue tube.  i don&#x27;t think its made by Fallene anymore.</li>
    <li> It is a great sunblock recommended by dermatologists.</li>
    <li> I have hyperpigmentation (freckles on my face especially) and I can count on this for my sun blockage. The only time I was slightly disappointed was when it was hot as HECK (as it usually is in Florida at the beach) and I was sweating so much that even when I reapplied every 35 minutes I felt like it wasn&#x27;t holding on very well. I&#x27;ve figured out to dry my face at first, then reapply, and then fan myself for a couple of minutes to cool my face/slow sweating just a bit so this stuff can &amp;#34;set&amp;#34; itself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really love this sunscreen. WAY more that Neutrogena 85+ kind of stuff. :)</li>
    <li> I suffered for years with a sun poisoning rash everytime I was in the sun for any amount of time. No burn, no tan, just sun poisoning- no matter what sun block I used.  A new dermatologist recommended this product and it works!!!  I can actually be out in the sun with no issues whatsoever.  I only wish I would have discovered it years ago.</li>
    <li> We love this sunscreen. I have a precious 3 year old who has had more than her share of complications from a bone marrow transplant...her skin is very fragile &amp; she loves the outdoors! After receiving samples at our Oncologists office....this has become our new &#x27;must have&#x27; in the diaper bag for the summer! Before our recent trip to the beach, we tried several different sunscreens. This one protected her sensitive skin from the damaging sun &amp; didn&#x27;t leave her skin blotchy or itchy like some others! A smart investment for anyone with sensitive skin!!</li>
    <li> This product meets my husband&#x27;s needs for protecting his skin from the sun.  It goes on easily and is not greasy.  He had been using this product for several years.</li>
    <li> I have used Cotz for 4 years and LOVE it.  Not only does it protect my skin from sunburn/sun damage, it also protects my skin from dirt and grime in the environment, keeping pores clean and fresh.  It moisturizes, softens skin, keeps it young and supple looking and feeling, protects skin from both sun and environmental pollutants, and unlike every other sunscreen I&#x27;ve tried, it does not irritate my skin or clog pores, and is not greasy.  It is mildly tacky when first applied, but after a minute, I gently blot with a soft towel or microfiber cloth, and it then feels dry.  I wear this every single day, and my skin looks better and fresher with it on, than off---almost like very sheer, flattering makeup.  I HIGHLY recommend it!</li>
    <li> Not tinted enough.  Leaves a chalky appearance.  Will use on arms, not face.  Prefer Cotz natural tint product, but it is more expensive as it comes in a smaller tube.</li>
    <li> I have used this sunscreen for at least the past 15 years, and it is the only one that does not irritate my skin in any way. I cannot use chemical sunscreens because they make my skin red and itchy.  I can use Cotz over my whole face, including my eyes.  I just put it on like moisturizer before putting on my makeup.  I have to use high spf because of dark blotching on my skin, and this (along with a hat) has helped keep it at bay for may years.  Great stuff and I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I use this daily on my face and it protects so well.  Has kept me burn free for intense activities like skiing and scuba diving.  I also like the slight tint is has as it serves to make my skin look more even it&#x27;s often all I will wear as makeup.  Doesn&#x27;t clog my pores or make me breakout and it never stings my eyes or runs and I really just smear it on without much care to avoid my eyes.  It&#x27;s my favorite.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for many years now. It really protects my skin from the sun. It just makes my face slightly shiny. I surely will recommend this to my friends.</li>
    <li> Because I have a skin condition that makes me extremely sun sensitive, I have tried a lot of sunscreens. This is my favorite.</li>
    <li> From a customer on a first name basis with his dermatologist, this is simply the BEST sunscreen there is. It&#x27;s unusual in that you use very little. It stays on. It does color your skin and hair but not much. It&#x27;s more expensive than the CVS brand zinc oxide which is very good for everyday use.</li>
    <li> I like the way it goes on , not greasy, and I have used this product for 8 years now .... love it</li>
    <li> Appears to be heavy but goes on smooth and light  Blends in quickly and is not greasy  Does not feel like your wearng sunscreen</li>
    <li> I have a very fair complexion.  I wear this product year round on recommendation from the dermatologist.  It never burns, goes on smoothly and works well over the moisturizer I use on my face.  I like that it has a slight tint to it.</li>
    <li> It works well. Doesn&#x27;t cause acne to flair, and she does not get burnt in the hot AZ sun. Very happy with the product.</li>
    <li> This works very well.A little bit can go a long way.When you get down to the end cut the end of the tube off and get all of it out of the container.This way you don&#x27;t lose any of it.</li>
    <li> This is by far the best sunscreen I&#x27;ve ever used. I tend to burn fairly easily and I can put this on and end up getting a decent tan over the course of a summer. The smell is very neutral instead of obnoxious like a lot of sunscreens. This is also a very natural product and contains none of the additives that are known to cause cancer.</li>
    <li> True sunblock that doesn&#x27;t burn my eyes or irritate my skin. I&#x27;ve been using it for years.</li>
    <li> This didn&#x27;t work for me. I had to find something with a darker tint. Got the eltamd tinted  titanium dioxide sunscreen per my aesthetician&#x27;s recommendation. This works better on really fair skin. Not someone with an olive tint or a little tan. I looked like a vampire wearing this.</li>
    <li> In August of 2012 I came down with a crawling feeling all over my body and suffered with it for two full months.  When I searched &amp; searched online for a cause (since my derm and reg. dr. wrote me off as delusional), I came across a website call StopSkinMites and read about what ended up being my problem.  The author of the site recommended this for the facial area and it worked in one night to end the crawling (of collembola) on my face, neck, ears, nose and eyes.  For that, I am eterally grateful.  Somehow it works to suffocate them and protect you from further skin infestation.  Sounds like I&#x27;m a nut, but I&#x27;m not.  LOL</li>
    <li> Although it&#x27;s an effective sunscreen, for some reason the &amp;#34;plus&amp;#34; version has multiple parabens in the ingredients. I&#x27;ll be sticking with the other cotz formulations in the future since I have no desire to rub xenoestrogens all over my skin.</li>
    <li> I really love this sunscreen. I have skin pigment issues and use medication that requires me to wear a  high SPF and mineral sunscreen, the chemically made sunscreens irritate my skin. This one is the best I&#x27;ve found. Goes on smooth and even with no white cast no irritation. Has no scent, and is long lasting. I definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> Recommended by my Dermotologist.  Does not leave your skin feeling sticky and pasty white!</li>
    <li> Recommended from my dermatologist. Love the slight tinting so don&#x27;t use makeup. A little goes a long way. Dime size for my face. Thick but feels light when applied.</li>
    <li> I love this product because it has zinc and titanium and no chemicals. I am outside all day and this gives me full coverage. The only thing I dislike about this product is its tinted and it gets all over my clothes. Other than that it protects my skin which is most important.</li>
</ol>
