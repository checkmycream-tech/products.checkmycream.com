      <li>It does make your hair nice and smooth but after a while you need to wash your  hair to actually clean the hair.&lt;br /&gt;In compare to wen , this is fancier but a lot pricier .</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t like it as much, but for the price I&#x27;m good with it.</li>
      <li>I got this in a beauty box and loved it so much that I ordered it from this seller.  </li>
      <li>The seller was right on time with my order will use again !!</li>
      <li>And embarrassment.o many years ago; I&#x27;d have had sooo many more years of better hair, and would have saved so much money, and aggravation, and irritation.</li>
      <li>I just wish I&#x27;d learned about these things sooo many years ago; I&#x27;d have had sooo many more years of better hair, and would have saved so much money, and aggravation, and irritation.</li>
      <li>It is so easy to use as I like the idea that I don&#x27;t have to shampoo and condition in two steps.  </li>
      <li>this product is so easy to use - replaces shampoo and conditioner.</li>
      <li>I couldn&#x27;t believe how it easy it was.</li>
      <li>Decent product but never quite as good as it was in the salon...</li>
      <li>I was bereft when my three-ounce can ran out because I couldn&#x27;t afford the normal price, and was delighted when I found it here at this price.</li>
      <li>provides excellent moisture without weighing my hair down.</li>
      <li>, my hair smells just fine after I use it.</li>
      <li>I decided to see if I could find it cheaper on Amazon, and was very happy to see it here for about half the price.</li>
      <li>Also I have really fine hair, but a lot of it, so</li>
      <li>cleans and leaves hair extremely smooth and shiny, just use,</li>
      <li>This stuff is fabulous.  </li>
      <li>Recently saw this at a TJ Maxx and so so happy I picked it up.</li>
      <li>I even got a free sample of another product.  </li>
      <li>I do use a light spray in conditioner afterward on the ends of my hair.  </li>
      <li>Leaves my hair silky and tangle free.</li>
      <li>My fine, dried out hair feels amazing - clean, silky, and smells really nice!  </li>
      <li>Love the way my hair looks and how fast and easy this product is to use.</li>
      <li>Indeed, this product neither will leave you with the feeling of squeaky clean scalp nor with sily conditioned hair.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> There are so many things that are wrong with this product (too bad I can&#x27;t return it): 1) it does not smell as good as the other products I tried from this line; 2) it does not foam so you have to press down to get a good handful of the creme shampoo-like cream to be able to wash  your hair and the entire thing is going to last you for a very short period of time; 3) it is explained that it is an innovative product that is both, shampoo and conditioner together, but it is true what they say that, generally speaking, it is rare to see a product that does two different things at the same times and well. Indeed, this product neither will leave you with the feeling of squeaky clean scalp nor with sily conditioned hair.</li>
    <li> Great product. I even got a free sample of another product.  Thanks</li>
    <li> This is good product. I only gave 4 stars because I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to see how well it will continue to do. I plan on buying again. The seller that sent to me was Bubbles and they were amazing to work with.</li>
    <li> Nice price. Ordered 2 of these. Really softens your hair and the delivery was quick!</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing. Love love love and you will love if you have converted to &amp;#34;no poo&amp;#34;.. have used Wen and other brands of cleansing conditioners for years now. Recently saw this at a TJ Maxx and so so happy I picked it up. In all of my googling for alternatives to Wen this was never mentioned anywhere, sadly..it is MUCH better than any other brands on the market. YUM&amp;#60;3</li>
    <li> Been using this product for about 1-1/2 years now and love it.  It is so easy to use as I like the idea that I don&#x27;t have to shampoo and condition in two steps.  Takes just a small, very small, amount to be effective so the can lasts a looooong time.  Have had no hair or scalp problems since using it.  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> This stuff is fabulous.  I have always shied away from 2 in 1 shampoo/conditioner products until now.  Works extremely well on my thick, long hair.  Lots of body and no heavy residue. Perfect for traveling and especially good for places where the water pressure is weak or rationed (ie; pay showers).</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Macadamia Natural Oil Flawless Cleansing Conditioner for over six months, and I love it. I usually buy it at a local beauty retailer, where it costs over $30 for one of these cans. I decided to see if I could find it cheaper on Amazon, and was very happy to see it here for about half the price. When it arrived yesterday, however, I was a bit concerned after opening the box. There are some very subtle differences in the packaging that make me wonder if what I purchased here is the genuine product. I haven&#x27;t tried using it yet, so if it works the same as the product I&#x27;ve purchased at Ulta, then I might be okay with it. But I remain somewhat worried that this is a counterfeit product. Specifically, the coloring of the packaging is slightly off, the name of the product is listed differently on the front of the can, and the branding info on the back is different. It&#x27;s entirely possible that this can be chalked up to changes at the manufacturer over time, but I&#x27;ve compared this can to two others I have at home (one that&#x27;s been in my shower for two months and a backup product) and it is definitely different in fairly subtle ways.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The real Flawless product gets five stars from me. It really does what it says: it cleanses and conditions at once, makes my hairstyle last longer, decreases my blow-drying time, and prevents frizzies. I would and will continue to purchase it, despite how much it costs. It&#x27;s that good!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will try to update after using the product a couple times.</li>
    <li> Love this product! Instantly made my hair feel soft. After a few uses, my hair is so shiny and less tangled. Smells amazing. Will keep buying this product!</li>
    <li> I really like this product.  I was leary at first because I tend to have an oily scalp, but Flawless does not make my hair more oily.  It seems to give my hair more volume and it really does cut down on dry time.  My hair is soft and healthy.</li>
    <li> This is a great &amp;#34;no -poo&amp;#34; alternative.  Doesn&#x27;t make hair oily at all!</li>
    <li> I like this product as a 2-in-1 when I need a quick shower. My hair is medium curly and moderately thick so normally I would never use a 2-in-1 product as they usually don&#x27;t leave my hair conditioned enough. This works for the most part though. I can still comb my hair afterwards but does not leave it super soft as I had hoped (might be a different story for straight hair peeps). Like others mentioned, the product continues to leak after you pump so what I do is on the second pump, rather than pushing all the way down, I only pump half way and keep an eye on it to get excess product that has leaked before putting the cap back on. It&#x27;s not worth the original price in my opinion (if you have curly hair like mine) but for the sale price it&#x27;s worth a try.</li>
    <li> Best no suds cleanser conditioner I have tried. Leaves my hair silky and tangle free. Love the price on Amazon</li>
    <li> Leaves my tangled messy long hair soft and smooth.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product. I don&#x27;t use to much. I wash my hair every other day. My hair is natural curly. I can run my fingers thru and feel so soft. A lot of people is just to see foam wen they apply shampoo. This product don&#x27;t do that. I put it In my hands and spread in my head. I run my fingers thru making sure is no tangle. I put it up with a hair clip and take the rest of my shower. I then start rinse making sure is nice and clean. I run my fingers once again thru my hair and done. This is and excellent product. Remember  no all the hair is the same, I just like skin. I take time to find the right one I hope this be the one for you to.</li>
    <li> this product has changed my hair  increasing shine, gloss and my scalp is not dry anymore!  Love it!!!!! Got it quickly and in good shape.</li>
    <li> Fantastic shampoo! Does a great job and smells amazing. Noticeable difference after using it only a couple of times.</li>
    <li> I love the way this stuff works and makes my hair look and feel. One thing I don&#x27;t appreciate is that the product continues to seep out of the nozzle for a few minutes after use. It&#x27;s not THAT much that leaks out, I guess, but it&#x27;s enough to be annoying. I will probably buy it again. I love that it doesn&#x27;t strip my hair of all its oil, and being able to wash and condition well in one step is great. I was using Wen, but it&#x27;s just so expensive I wanted to try something else. I don&#x27;t like it as much, but for the price I&#x27;m good with it.</li>
    <li> I received a 3 oz sample of this and although I have the oiliest hair on earth (looks unwashed halfway through the day) this took all the grime out. Left my hair feeling awesome and clean and exceptionally shiny. I would buy this expensive product if it were not for the uncomfortable tingling/burning feeling it left on my scalp. It was really intense burning after I used it, and as my hair dried, the feeling got less and less however after 6 hours and my hair is now dry, my scalp still feels tingly and uncomfortable. It&#x27;s unsettling to me and I have only read one review where this happened to someone else. I am therefore giving it away. Try at your own risk, I have only had this same burning tingling experience once before, and it was with Wen, another popular cleansing conditioner.</li>
    <li> I have always read not to use a shampoo and conditioner in one.....well this one is fabulous.....makes hair so soft and the volume is unbelievable....safe for color treated hair.....only thing is when I use for every shampoo my scalp tends to dry and itch....I use it every other washing......</li>
    <li> This product is better than Wen. There is less build up on the hair. It&#x27;s probably the same in terms of cost per ounce, but you do not need to wash and then repeat so, technically, you have twice as much.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite conditioner. It leaves my hair feeling silky but not heavy. I originally received a sample in my Birchbox and knew that I had to have the full size.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s nice but after few washes you need a real shampoo to clean your hair thoroughly . It does make your hair nice and smooth but after a while you need to wash your  hair to actually clean the hair.&lt;br /&gt;In compare to wen , this is fancier but a lot pricier .</li>
    <li> i don&#x27;t write many reviews.  this product warrants an exception because of how well it preforms in my hair.&lt;br /&gt;1.  I&#x27;m a hairstylist and product snob.  typically, I don&#x27;t like anything.&lt;br /&gt;2.  I wash my medium density, fine texture semi-wavey hair only about every 5 or 6 days.  (I&#x27;m a dirty girl)&lt;br /&gt;3.  I&#x27;m too lazy to blow dry, and beyond working with my natural texture, I wear my hair in updos.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;this has held up amazingly well considering how little I do with my own hair and how much I expect what product I do use to preform.  I don&#x27;t wash my hair often (because I&#x27;m not oily and have healthy hair) but this stuff has some real staying power.  I was extremely skeptical, but after a months use (read: about five washes) I do not feel any buildup, am mostly tangle-free, my updos stay in place and don&#x27;t slip out, my scalp feels good, and my ends don&#x27;t feel too burned out.  I&#x27;m probably going to deep condition every other time I use this from here on out just to keep my hair from getting dry on the ends, but considering that I wear my hair differently on each day (all I use is a spray bottle of water and comb daily to refresh) and used no other product during this time I have been very pleasantly surprised.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;this stuff probably won&#x27;t work as well for super oily or super dry types, but if you have decent to healthy hair this is worth a try.  smells good too-not cloying or floral.</li>
    <li> Fabulous product! Will defiantly buy again. Love the way my hair looks and how fast and easy this product is to use.</li>
    <li> Love this product have been using it for awhile now my hair is curly and it leaves it soft and clean and smells great!! The seller was right on time with my order will use again !!</li>
    <li> I got a sample of this some (can&#x27;t remember where), and when I first squirted some of it into my hand, I thought &amp;#34;No WAY is this stuff gonna work!&amp;#34; I&#x27;ve tried lots of other shampoo/conditioner products that just leave your hair feeling not quite clean and weighed down. I have NO CLUE how this stuff works, but it really does! After my hair had dried, I ordered three full-sized bottles, and I have now passed my sample on to my daughter.  Everything else I have for my hair (except hairspray) can go to File 13 (a/k/a the garbage) as far as I&#x27;m concerned!!!</li>
    <li> I LOVE this cleansing conditioner, it&#x27;s the only two-in-one product that works on my thick hair. It doesn&#x27;t dry my scalp or leave hair oily, somehow it strikes a perfect balance.</li>
    <li> Great for color treated hair!</li>
    <li> Terrific but it takes getting used to &amp;#34;no lather&amp;#34; - doesn&#x27;t weigh down my fine, limp hair. Have ordered more!</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! I like the texture (kind of like shaving gel) and that it doesn&#x27;t foam a lot. Makes my hair feel healthy, tangle free, and even adds a little bounce to my normally totally limp, dull hair. I plan on buying it again.</li>
    <li> Excellent product! Seriously helps dealing with dry hair much easier. A little goes a long way, but if you are expecting suds and bubbles that won&#x27;t happen. It&#x27;s like rubbing a lovely fragranced cream through your hair, and it leaves it softer and smoother without any greasy feel. I usually follow with a macadamia conditioner. Highly recommend Flawless!</li>
    <li> Lovethis product. Leaves the hair so silky and shiny.</li>
    <li> When my hairdresser first introduced me to this product l was amazed on how clean and untangled it left my hair. This was 2 months ago and now i cannot live without it. I do recommend this product .This product actually replaced my shampoo, conditioner and detangler.</li>
    <li> I received as a gift and I love this. Was only using Wen before I tired this product.  Does what it says it does!</li>
    <li> I love this! I am a member if Birchbox and received this in my September box. I immediately started using it and love it. It was on sale at Birchbox for $33 for this size!!! So glad I compared and purchased from Amazon.</li>
    <li> I adore this cleansing conditioner. Superior to others I have tried and much more affordable. I have recommended it to all my friends.</li>
    <li> This product leaves my very oily scalp clean and much less oily, it truly tames humidity-caused frizz and leaves my hair shiny.  I do use a light spray in conditioner afterward on the ends of my hair.  The only downside is I have long hair and this large bottle only lasts me 3 weeks.</li>
    <li> The shampoo is a bit different because it doesn&#x27;t suds up, but it really cleans and conditions my hair. No need to use conditioner. I brought it on a trip because it is a shampoo and conditioner in one and is in a metal container. It is under slight pressure and so you just push down on the top and it comes out.</li>
    <li> Amazing product. Doesn&#x27;t leave my hair greasy, but makes it so soft!</li>
    <li> I like the product and the way it makes my hair feel, but you go through a lot of product.</li>
    <li> Best cleansing conditioner that I have used.  I love this stuff.  You have to rinse it well though.  It doesn&#x27;t leave an oily film on the scalp like many other cleansing conditioners out there.  I wish it had a stronger smell but I still love it.</li>
    <li> This shampoo cleans my hair so well!  I only use this once a week (usually on Sundays since it needs to stay in your for 5 minutes and takes some time to rinse out) mainly because I don’t need this kind of deep clean everyday but also because of the expense.  This stuff is not cheap but it is well worth the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is that the product continues to leak out after I have sprayed it into my hand and put the cap back on.  I feel like I&#x27;m wasting product.</li>
    <li> Holy mackerel! I thought these things (&amp;#34;shampoos&amp;#34; without detergents, made out of conditioners and oils) were nonsense, that they&#x27;d leave me with greasy, limp hair. My fine, thin-ish, old, color-treated hair has no volume, so I figured the LAST thing I needed was to use something like THIS on it, but I received a three-ounce can in a Birchbox and figured it wouldn&#x27;t kill me to try it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh, geez, was I ever WRONG about these things. How the heck does this stuff get my hair clean and NOT weigh it down? I totally don&#x27;t understand! My hair tends to be oily at the roots and dry and frizzy everywhere else. Somehow, this stuff gets it clean, imparts a bit of shine, a little bit of volume, and takes care of some of the frizz. No, I&#x27;m not gonna say it makes it glossy and incredibly voluminous; it doesn&#x27;t do THAT (it&#x27;s not like those stupid WEN commercials), but it&#x27;s waaay better than I expected it was gonna be. And it&#x27;s certainly a lot better than a normal shampoo with detergents.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t for the life of me figure it out. It doesn&#x27;t make any sense. So that&#x27;s why I came here to buy this big can. I was bereft when my three-ounce can ran out because I couldn&#x27;t afford the normal price, and was delighted when I found it here at this price. While I don&#x27;t care for the smell when it comes out of the can (I don&#x27;t know how else to describe it besides saying &amp;#34;It smells like a salon&amp;#34;), my hair smells just fine after I use it. Better: I don&#x27;t need conditioner after I use it because it IS conditioner. So there&#x27;s some savings right there! And my hair is better!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now I just wish someone would explain HOW my hair gets clean using this, because common sense dictates that this would make my hair DIRTY. I don&#x27;t understand how conditioner and oil get sebum, dirt, and dust out of my hair. It&#x27;s counterintuitive. Nevertheless, I&#x27;m a really happy user! Thanks so much, Birchbox, for turning me onto this! I just wish I&#x27;d learned about these things sooo many years ago; I&#x27;d have had sooo many more years of better hair, and would have saved so much money, and aggravation, and irritation. And embarrassment.o many years ago; I&#x27;d have had sooo many more years of better hair, and would have saved so much money, and aggravation, and irritation. And embarrassment.</li>
    <li> what a lifesaver!!! provides excellent moisture without weighing my hair down.</li>
    <li> This Macadamia shampoo/conditioner is surprisingly nice. My fine, sun damaged hair is silky after use and very shiny. It feels so healthy and bouncy. I like the smell very much. The consistency of the dispensed foam is thick enough to stay on your hand so you can apply it all over your head. It rinses out easily and my wet hair is smooth and untangled. Other people have commented about the fact that the product oozes out after using it and it is TRUE. It isn&#x27;t terrible, but always has a messy top because of it. The product is really great for my hair and that is why I gave it the 5 stars. I do give the packaging a firm 3. Maybe the manufacturer will catch on to the negative reviews concerning the dispenser and change it!</li>
    <li> excellent! cleans and leaves hair extremely smooth and shiny, just use, every now and then, a conventional shampoo to get a better wash !</li>
    <li> this product is so easy to use - replaces shampoo and conditioner. For years, I&#x27;d been using another product like this that sells thru infomercials and was sold on it until I tried the Macad. Nat. Oil Flawless.  My fine, dried out hair feels amazing - clean, silky, and smells really nice!  I&#x27;m a convert!</li>
    <li> This product is awesome. I&#x27;ve only been using for a couple of weeks, but my hair is already healthy. I am also using the healing oil, so might be both products. I just noticed today that my hair is completely smooth and really shiny. I bought at store the first time, but so thankful that Amazon has for 1/3 of cost. It also smells really good compared to any Wen like products. The healing oil has a stronger smell, but seems to fade once hair is dry. Buy both products because they are worth it. Also I have really fine hair, but a lot of it, so blow drying is time consuming. I&#x27;ve noticed that the time to dry is shortening. I also have highlighted hair with fuchsia &amp; pink peek-a-boo, since using I have not had hardly any fading because before the peek-a-boo pieces had to be redone every other week.</li>
    <li> love this product.  cleans well and leaves hair soft and manageable.  never want to use sudsy shampoo again.</li>
    <li> I was sceptical at first bc I have an oily scalp but it&#x27;s an amazing product!! If you have longer hair you do need to use more than the recommended amount...I love it!!</li>
    <li> I got this in a beauty box and loved it so much that I ordered it from this seller.  I have tried sulfate-free shampoos before and hated them.  It is an odd experience - shampooing hair without the subs.  However, this has a beautiful formula.. It is very conditioning yet makes your hair feel clean.  I am in love with it and the seller has it for a really reasonable price..</li>
    <li> Decent product but never quite as good as it was in the salon...plus I have to use more than is suggested but I have a lot of curly hair. Not my favorite but good if I&#x27;m in a rush and no time for a two part process.</li>
    <li> This is a miracle product. I dyed parts of my hair blue at the beginning of this year, and it stayed blue almost FOUR months later. (The only reason why the color started fading faster was because I didn&#x27;t bring it with me on work trips.) I wash my hair every day, and a can lasts about one month.</li>
    <li> Amazing! Seriously, it&#x27;s the best shampoo/conditioner I have EVER used. I have very straight, thin and coarse hair. This product makes my hair smooth, shiny and soft! I couldn&#x27;t believe how it easy it was. I put it in my hair, leave it on for 5 minutes, rinse and blow dry like normal, it looks like I went to have it professionally done in a high end salon! YOU NEED THIS PRODUCT!</li>
    <li> Love it! Leaves my hair silky, soft, shiny and tangle free.</li>
