      <li>but it&#x27;s perfect for minor trims for those with long hair</li>
      <li>Still worth the perchance though.</li>
      <li>Overall I&#x27;m satisfied with it.</li>
      <li>Thanks!</li>

      <li>you can always go back and not cut too much</li>
      <li>Not bad with the thin hairs though.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, not bad at all for this price.</li>
      <li>and when I cut them in between haircuts I normally do it 5-6 times before I get them straight/even and as short as I like them.</li>
      <li>This tool is a great little secret.</li>
      <li>I was a little sceptical at first, but</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> It arrived a lot sooner then expected..open it n used it ryt away..It&#x27;s perfect..it does a great job..I will not hve to go to a salon any more😊thank you for selling this item..</li>
    <li> The seller kindly let me chose the color &amp;#34;Pink&amp;#34; and it delivered much faster than estimated. This is a great product for anyone like me who cuts your own hair at home.</li>
    <li> works just like it says and I have wavy hair.  I recommend this product.</li>
    <li> For the price, not bad at all.&lt;br /&gt;I trimmed my bang using the small blue one and worked great. Need a good scissor though.&lt;br /&gt;Long white dies not work well with thick hairs. Not bad with the thin hairs though.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, not bad at all for this price.</li>
    <li> The item I received was nothing at all like the one in the picture. Different packaging as well. I didn&#x27;t spend too much on it, so I&#x27;m not so upset</li>
    <li> Long time ago I had a friend that used to cut my hair n loved how she cut it since than I had not found anyone that did a good job as her, until  now I did it my self with pro clipper and I really love it!!!</li>
    <li> Easy to use and so affordable!</li>
    <li> No instructions or packaging with item!!!</li>
    <li> waited forever.....shipping took over 20 days. 1 star for shipping speed! 4 stars for the product. It was placed in a bubbled envelope, the clips were in a long ziplock bag, there were no instructions. I would&#x27;ve gave it 5 stars if it did. I watched a few youtube videos, followed the instructions for a 3 layer cut. It does exactly what it&#x27;s advertised to do.</li>
    <li> This is a must-have for the DIY hair stylist. Even though it didn&#x27;t come with instructions, there was plenty online for tons of different hair cuts. In five minutes, I had the style that I used to pay a lot of money for on a regular basis. It blew my mind. I was a little concerned that I would have trouble with my hair being too short at just above my shoulders, but that wasn&#x27;t an issue at all. I&#x27;d highly recommend this.</li>
    <li> A little hard to use.</li>
    <li> Wonderful, I used it on my daughter just this weekend and it was great!</li>
    <li> you have to get hand on it but the results are very good</li>
    <li> Got it way before estimated delivery time. Amazing product. Used it couple of times, very comfortable to use. Happy with the purchase!</li>
    <li> Nice and easy to use. Is a hard plastic tool. I used to cut my bangs and was very easy to do.</li>
    <li> Ordered it on June 26, 2015.  Received it in my mail July 7th.  Came all the way from China.  It is a cheap product but for few bucks it totally worth it!!!! I was a little sceptical at first, but when I tried it, wow.... I couldn&#x27;t believe it! My hair is flat with no layers. They are about 25 inches long.  It was so easy to cut and now I have layers in my hair!! I probably saved a hundred dollars on a haircut at the salon! I&#x27;m very happy with this purchase. I will never go back to hair salon!!</li>
    <li> Love it. Going to buy more</li>
    <li> Just as advertised !!!!!!</li>
    <li> perfection with every cut and so easy yo use!</li>
    <li> They arrived early which was really great. I&#x27;m not afraid to cut my own hair but I thought this tool would make it much easier and it could help me keep my trimming even. It worked great and I love the results. I only plan to use this for minor trimming for my already long hair. The clasp was a little difficult to open and close but once I managed to close the clasp it was very secure. I would not recommend this for giving yourself a drastic hair cut or for people with short hair but it&#x27;s perfect for minor trims for those with long hair</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t know why no one has reviewed this by now but it&#x27;s great! The smaller blue one is more practical for me since I use it by seperating my hair in two and cutting it evenly across.  The bigger one is great for making the hair into a nice and even curve. I just wish this came with more instructions but there are YouTube videos on how to use a similar products. Overall I&#x27;m satisfied with it.</li>
    <li> love it.  it comes handy.  i have used it a few times already.  i am loving it.</li>
    <li> I love these! They make cutting my hair soooo easy, fast, and beautiful. I am doing it myself from now on. The cost is so low, there should be no reservation about getting them. I even got free shipping. It does not make sense to pay between $20 to $30 for this kind of hair cut kit! The only problem is that it can be a long wait for them to get shipped to you.</li>
    <li> Tried as soon as I received. I like to keep my bangs short and when I cut them in between haircuts I normally do it 5-6 times before I get them straight/even and as short as I like them. I used the smaller size and it helped me get a straight cut the very first time. I had to trim some hairs individually to get them &amp;#34;right&amp;#34; but using this little device helped me get it right in about 20 mins! Super pleased I bought this!</li>
    <li> Good product except the level bubble never wants to stay level and have to have a real steady hand to keep it straight otherwise good concept</li>
    <li> Love it !! You get a haircut in seconds. You think you are cutting A lot but you are really not. Is perfect you can adjust the length yourself however you want it. I like to start layer by layer that way you can always go back and not cut too much</li>
    <li> This tool is a great little secret. It makes it so easy to trim your own hair and save tons of money.</li>
    <li> Arrived way sooner than expected, very pleasant surprise. Awesome product, love it!</li>
    <li> I did an excelent choice.  Super cool, super easy.  Thanks amazon.</li>
    <li> this product is amazing I cut my hair the first time myself and it turned out amazing its precise and accurate my hair had the perfect amount of layers and its professional looking style my friends and relatives think I had my hair done at a salon .I am also using it to cut an a -line bob on my niece I recommend this product you can save money and do it yourself with the pro clipper.</li>
    <li> Not hard to use but would of been better had it come with instructions it came in a zip lock type bag with out instructions I had to use youtube, not bad takes practice if it&#x27;s your 1st rims only take a little bit off at a time</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s just a plastic hair clip, nothing else. I studied some of&lt;br /&gt;the videos on YouTube and tried the clips. They made&lt;br /&gt;a mess and are not worth getting for a serious haircut.&lt;br /&gt;I ended up having to go to a &#x27;real&#x27; hairdresser to cover&lt;br /&gt;up the mess these clips made.</li>
    <li> The wife has very thin hair so we used the bang trimmer to trim the back of her hair.  It held it&#x27;s place well &amp; did what I needed it to do.  The only thing is that the level is slightly off so I had to manually adjust to make sure it was straight.  All in all, for the price, I&#x27;m happy with the purchase.</li>
    <li> Works well.  After paying $12 at greatclips for someone to spend 2 minutes cutting my daughters hair I vowed, never again.  Thanks!</li>
    <li> It helps as a guide but not as easy to use as the videos show. I may use it in between my daughter&#x27;s hair appointments.</li>
    <li> Best price for doing my own hair. It&#x27;s fun and cheap to do. Shipped fast. It&#x27;s in English and Chinese but can&#x27;t beat the price!</li>
    <li> It takes time to arrived because it comes from Singapur, but it works perfectly. The price is great compare to the original and it do the same thing. I am very happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> The clipper arrived earlier than the estimated date. Husband cut my hairs nowadays and he found this as a joy! Easily save $25 for a women haircut :D</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t have anything to compare this to cause I never own the creaclips. I do know that it gives me an even cut. I use it to trim my hair and I like the results.</li>
    <li> Giving it 4 stars because the the clip is a bit hard to close.  Aside from that, works great, happy with results. Can&#x27;t beat the price in comparison to the original crea clip.</li>
    <li> Works great. Doesn&#x27;t come with instructions, but are readily available on YouTube.</li>
    <li> Works great, I love it.</li>
    <li> I just love this tool! I have been cutting my long hair now for quite some time, my efforts were ok, however, this has greatly improved my hair, I HIGHLY recommend it.</li>
    <li> [[VIDEOID:fd01b85009229fe47b99f3b3e9acdcda]] I love this product and tell all my friends about it!  Here I&#x27;ll show you how I cut my hair in a matter of seconds.</li>
    <li> Exited to revive my clip early cut my hard just like I wanted.</li>
    <li> It works, but quality could be a bit better. Still worth the perchance though.</li>
    <li> Os very bad no recomended</li>
    <li> Came a lot faster then scheduled, and the clips are exactly as described. I have very fine hair, but the clips stay in place when I set them to keep my hair for cutting.</li>
