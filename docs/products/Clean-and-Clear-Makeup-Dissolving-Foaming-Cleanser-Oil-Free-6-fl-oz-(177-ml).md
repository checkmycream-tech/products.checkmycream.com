      <li>It doesn&#x27;t sting and since its a foam its really easy to wash off.</li>
      <li>I fell in love with it upon first use and never want to try anything else again!</li>

      <li>It feels gentle, smells nice, and yet works powerfully!</li>
      <li>I used up my original bottle</li>
      <li>It is gentle but removes every trace of makeup in one easy step.  </li>
      <li>It is so easy and gentle on the skin.</li>
      <li>It doesnt seem to completely take away my mascara, but it works better than anything else I&#x27;ve ever tried.</li>
      <li>i got it pretty quick.</li>
      <li>The cleanser lasts a long time and is a very good value (especially when compared with makeup remover towelettes).</li>
      <li>The pump makes it easy to dispense more when you  need it even when your eyes are closed.</li>
      <li>It is priced very low for such great results.  </li>
      <li>This is the only product I&#x27;ve ever had that effectively and gently removes my eyeliner and mascara.</li>
      <li>after i apply it on my face, all the makeup is removed very fast.</li>
      <li>What I don&#x27;t love is the fact that I only bought one bottle and then found out that no stores carry it anymore when I went to buy another.</li>

      <li>it works great as usual and takes off waterproof makeup with a gentle rub, without burning my eyes.</li>

      <li>(GENTLE ON THE SKIN)&lt;br /&gt;5)</li>
      <li>Because it really does remove waterproof eye makeup and it doesn&#x27;t sting my eyes.  </li>
      <li>It is also quite gentle and smells really good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>You really feel it working on your face as you rub it in with water.</li>
      <li>I have to put it on my face 2-3 times for it to remove some of the make up a normal bar soap</li>
      <li>This product really gets the dirt, makeup and general yuck clean without leaving your face dry or dying for moisturizer.</li>
      <li>removes my makeup COMPLETELY.</li>
      <li>My sensitive skin does not get irritated because of soft foaming.</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s very hard to find sometimes. :-)</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m in my mid 30&#x27;s and have normal skin and wear basic makeup.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t really wear much other than eye make-up, so I needed something that would remove eye-liner and mascara.</li>
      <li>I usually wear eye liner,mascara and eyeshadow and this product doesnt remove it right away.</li>

<li> I usually wear eye liner,mascara and eyeshadow and this product doesnt remove it right away.</li>
<li> Usually, make up removers leave a little bit of stubborn waterproof mascara and/or get it off of your eyes, but it gets stuck in your skin, so you have to cleanse after to be completely clean.</li>
<li> This product also left my skin very dry.</li>
<li> I&#x27;d had years of problems with dry skin patches around my eyes from using various eye makeup remover products, and once I started using this the dry skin disappeared indefinitely.</li>
<li> Another left my skin dry and had a buring sensation due to the salicylic acid.</li>
<li> It doesn&#x27;t leave dry skin</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve had trouble finding it at stores but recently bought here</li>
<li> I will not use any other face wash.</li>
<li> Just a few pumps make enough foaming to remove heavy makeup.</li>
<li> This product comes out in a foam, simply apply to face in circular motions and no makeup is left behind.</li>
<li> It sort of burns if you get it in your eye, more annoying than burning, though.</li>
<li> A previous commenter mentioned that Clean&amp;Clear discontinued it....why in the world would they do that?!?</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for years and it is unbelievable.</li>
<li> It takes makeup off but leaves your skin feeling slick and oily (in my opinion).</li>
<li> It is hard to find</li>
<li> so when I order I always order at least 3 at a time.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s sad to see that it&#x27;s being discontinued and it&#x27;s hard to find it online now.</li>
<li> Unlike other removers, where you might be wiping hard on your eyes (with a cloth, cotton pad, etc) to get off that mascara (which is horrible for the skin), this remover is a foam that literally washes everything off.</li>
<li> How frustrating!</li>
<li> Desperate</li>
<li> Bad things is that they no longer sell it in stores buy it threw amazon or e-bay.</li>

    <li> This is the only product I&#x27;ve ever had that effectively and gently removes my eyeliner and mascara. It doesn&#x27;t sting and since its a foam its really easy to wash off.</li>
    <li> A review from my wife:   This is the best make-up remover I have ever used! I fell in love with it upon first use and never want to try anything else again! I use it primarily to remove my eye makeup, of which it does in just 2-3 seconds. It feels gentle, smells nice, and yet works powerfully! I&#x27;d had years of problems with dry skin patches around my eyes from using various eye makeup remover products, and once I started using this the dry skin disappeared indefinitely. The cleanser lasts a long time and is a very good value (especially when compared with makeup remover towelettes). I LOVE this product! What I don&#x27;t love is the fact that I only bought one bottle and then found out that no stores carry it anymore when I went to buy another. A previous commenter mentioned that Clean&amp;Clear discontinued it....why in the world would they do that?!? How frustrating! I am happy that at least Amazon still carries it.</li>
    <li> One of the best products I&#x27;ve ever used! I love how its a foam and the fact that it takes away all of my makeup including my waterproof eyeliner.  One product I&#x27;ve used caused me to break out leaving tiny bumps all over my face. Another left my skin dry and had a buring sensation due to the salicylic acid. But with this one, I do not have any problems whatsoever.  It&#x27;s a shame that it is a discontinued item when this product works so well!</li>
    <li> this is the best makeup remover i have ever used.  I would recommend everyone try it.</li>
    <li> Only Makeup remover that will remove all makeup even eye liner. Also takes all the oils of my face helping precent acne brake outs. Bad things is that they no longer sell it in stores buy it threw amazon or e-bay.</li>
    <li> This product worked great at removing my make up.  I did have a bit of eyeliner residue left but one it was easy to remove after using this.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for years and it is unbelievable. It is so easy and gentle on the skin. Unlike other removers, where you might be wiping hard on your eyes (with a cloth, cotton pad, etc) to get off that mascara (which is horrible for the skin), this remover is a foam that literally washes everything off. There is no oil, tugging of the skin, rubbing of the eyes, it is awesome. I&#x27;ve had trouble finding it at stores but recently bought here and I&#x27;m so happy that I found it. If you are looking for a makeup remover look no further!!</li>
    <li> I am very impressed with the product. It removes all the makeup without any extra effort even waterproof mascara. It doesn&#x27;t leave dry skin but I prefer to apply moisturizer after removing makeup. I will definitely buy this makeup remover again.</li>
    <li> I will not use any other face wash. It removes makeup easily, smells nice, isnt greasy and isnt drying to my skin. It can be used on the eyes which is a plus since most face washes suggest not to use it on the eyes. Doesnt burn or irritate. It is hard to find so when I order I always order at least 3 at a time.</li>
    <li> Seems to really work at getting the makeup off. It doesn&#x27;t burn my skin like most makeup removers do. Plus, I like that it foams up which in my opionion gets the face cleaner.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t really wear much other than eye make-up, so I needed something that would remove eye-liner and mascara. I thought this might do the trick, but... Nope! I wasn&#x27;t even using water-proof eyeliner! Also left some residue on my face -- I washed my face again after using this. Would not recommend...</li>
    <li> This product does what it says.  Dissolves all makeup, even those claiming to stay for 12 hours, in a second.  Eye makeup is a breeze.  This products does it all.  No astringent or after cleansing products needed.  It is gentle but removes every trace of makeup in one easy step.  You&#x27;ll never have a breakout again from clogged pores.</li>
    <li> i got it pretty quick. after i apply it on my face, all the makeup is removed very fast. and it doesn&#x27;t hurt your eyes or make you blink at all. it&#x27;s such a great cleanser i ever bought :)</li>
    <li> I am so happy to have found this.  It may have been discontinued and I could not find it in the stores but here it is and it is great,  Thank you</li>
    <li> This stuff is okay, and just okay. It takes makeup off but leaves your skin feeling slick and oily (in my opinion). It sort of burns if you get it in your eye, more annoying than burning, though. I would say this is an OK cleanser but I won&#x27;t be buying again. I use Equate face cloths instead and they&#x27;re great. You should check them out if you&#x27;re looking for a makeup remover.</li>
    <li> I couldnt find this product in stores after they changed the bottles look so I was extremely happy to find it on amazon! it works great as usual and takes off waterproof makeup with a gentle rub, without burning my eyes. i was so happy to find it, i got one for my sister too :)</li>
    <li> I really like this product.  Works great and I would buy more but it&#x27;s very hard to find sometimes. :-)</li>
    <li> Best eye makeup removing cleanser ever. No scrubbing or using baby oil that gets in your eye. This product comes out in a foam, simply apply to face in circular motions and no makeup is left behind. I love this!</li>
    <li> One of my favorite make up removers ever. I am so upset that it was removed from the market! I found a similar thing in Germany which I now use.</li>
    <li> This is the best stuff out there that I have found to take off my makeup with. It&#x27;s gentle on your face and even takes off waterproof mascara like it was not even waterproof. It&#x27;s sad to see that it&#x27;s being discontinued and it&#x27;s hard to find it online now. So if your like me and you love this stuff better stock up on it if you find it before me, I know I will be stocking up on it.</li>
    <li> My friend bought me this as part of a graduation gift. I&#x27;ve tried so many make up removers before and I can&#x27;t believe I&#x27;ve never seen this one before! Usually, make up removers leave a little bit of stubborn waterproof mascara and/or get it off of your eyes, but it gets stuck in your skin, so you have to cleanse after to be completely clean. Not this cleanser! It removes make up AND cleanses your face so you don&#x27;t have to do both separately. I have also used this on my eyelids to remove eye make up while wearing contacts, and it caused no problems. This is definitely my new go-to makeup remover!!</li>
    <li> This has proven to be the best makeup remover out there. It is priced very low for such great results.  You really feel it working on your face as you rub it in with water. The pump makes it easy to dispense more when you  need it even when your eyes are closed. You can open your eyes with this on and around it without it burning your eyes. It is very gentle and highly recommended.</li>
    <li> This product really gets the dirt, makeup and general yuck clean without leaving your face dry or dying for moisturizer. It doesnt seem to completely take away my mascara, but it works better than anything else I&#x27;ve ever tried. I&#x27;m in my mid 30&#x27;s and have normal skin and wear basic makeup.</li>
    <li> 1) Since the pump creats foaming, I do not have to make foaming by hand. (SAVES TIME)&lt;br /&gt;2) Unlike most makeup cleansers, it does not require cottons. (SAVES MONEY)&lt;br /&gt;3) I never have to scrub my face or eyes because foaming easily removes my makeup. (SCRUB-FREE)&lt;br /&gt;4) My sensitive skin does not get irritated because of soft foaming. (GENTLE ON THE SKIN)&lt;br /&gt;5) Just a few pumps make enough foaming to remove heavy makeup. (LASTS LONGER)</li>
    <li> I bought this product because it had good reviews and it was a good price. It removes some of the make-up not ALL. I usually wear eye liner,mascara and eyeshadow and this product doesnt remove it right away. I have to put it on my face 2-3 times for it to remove some of the make up a normal bar soap removes my makeup COMPLETELY. This product also left my skin very dry.</li>
    <li> THat&#x27;s wonderful .removed all the make up inculding the water proofe one .i love this .i take it whenever i&#x27;m home or travel</li>
    <li> Great product! Definitely love how this easily takes off my make-up. One of my favorites. I love how I dont have to wipe off anything, when I wash my face all the make-up easily washes off.</li>
    <li> This is simply the best of the best makeup removers.  Why?  Because it really does remove waterproof eye makeup and it doesn&#x27;t sting my eyes.  It is also quite gentle and smells really good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I used up my original bottle I searched high-N-low to purchase a second but it was not to be found anywhere.  Desperate I went to Amazon and was (am) so thankful to find they carry it.  Thank you Amazon.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t find this stuff in the local stores, nor for that matter in the big nearby city stores. It lasts a long-long time. Love the foam, love the way my face feels after using it. Was very happy to find it online.</li>
