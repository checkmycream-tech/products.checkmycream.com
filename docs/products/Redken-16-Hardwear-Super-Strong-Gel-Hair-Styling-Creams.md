    <li> Redken isn&#x27;t overly expensive and comes in a decently sized tube for the cost. It holds my hair in place without getting a &amp;#34;glued on&amp;#34; look, and doesn&#x27;t flake.</li>
    <li> I had tried this product before but in a smaller package. I like this product and I love the fact that I was able to find it in a bigger size on Amazon.</li>
    <li> I have very fine and soft hair and this worked good for me.  I would buy it again.</li>
    <li> Been using this product for years.  I haven&#x27;t found another gel that holds as strong as this one.</li>
    <li> Probably one of the best &#x27;strong hold&#x27; gels you can get for the money. I used it every day and it hold really well with minimal residue left behind (as with many cheaper gels)</li>
    <li> Best gel I&#x27;ve ever used! Keeps hair in place while looking naturally shiny and relaxed.</li>
    <li> If you have very fine short hair and want some stiff gel for spikes, this is it.  Have used it before and it does the trick.  Don&#x27;t put too much on.</li>
    <li> Gives body to thin fine hair.  Helps discipline unwanted curls, but isn&#x27;t intended to cement hair into position.</li>
    <li> I love the product but don&#x27;t like the price of it in the stores; online purchase seems to be the best option.</li>
    <li> Works great for my curly girl hair.  I have always struggled with my Irish curls.  They look frizzy, dull, fall out in places, etc., etc.  All that until my hair dresser suggested Redken Hardware #16.  Now, my hair has never looked so great, so easily.  Seriously.  Hardware #16 has brought control to the curls without leaving that all day &#x27;wet&#x27; look, but crunchy hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To apply, squish/scrunch into your curls, then dry. Air or blow dry.  Then scrunch out the crunches if you have any.  Voila!  Smooth curls that stay its curl.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Isn&#x27;t that what we&#x27;re looking for?  Curls that are actually smooth not frizzy ringlets?  That&#x27;s what I get with Redken Hardware #16.</li>
    <li> My wife has used this product for years and loves it.  Hgihly recommend it..  Shop for it online for great savings.</li>
    <li> Who ever used this brand won&#x27;t use another one in the future. Shopping at amazon saved me a trip at the salon store and the price was slightly better as well.</li>
    <li> Best gel on the market.  The only gel that can handle my thick hairS</li>
    <li> Great product Fast delivery</li>
    <li> Rock solid hold without looking like gel</li>
    <li> Excellent product, washes clean, holds firmly for 24-48 hours without residue, and has excellent heat tolerance to blow dry styling.</li>
    <li> great gel for short hair. Holds the style the whole day. I love this product and I highly recommend it</li>
    <li> Give firm hold.  I saw the product in use where I go to get my hair cut.  It works well.</li>
    <li> It is much easier buying this gel online, and it&#x27;s cheaper too.  Works as well as the ones purchased in a salon.</li>
    <li> This is a regular product for me!  I have frizzy, curly, should-length hair.  I put this on after the shower and comb it through.  I find it holds up for two days without my hair frizzing.  This is my must have.</li>
    <li> Thousands of this type of stuff out there this one is great. Makes hair not to stiff still does the job it is suppose to do. Just takes a little best when hair is wet. Would be great for me if sold in a much smaller AND cheaper size.</li>
    <li> Redken Hardwear 16 is a super product.  Not only does it hold my hair well, but the style lasts for days on end.</li>
    <li> Product here quick and was exactly what the description said it was.</li>
    <li> I USED REDKEN 16 MANY TIME BUT THIS BOTTLE SEEMS LIKE IT WATER DOWN MAYBE IT WAS DEFECT I&#x27;M DISAPPOINTED</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this gel for years, and have never found its equivalent.  Good stuff.</li>
    <li> Great for men and women.</li>
