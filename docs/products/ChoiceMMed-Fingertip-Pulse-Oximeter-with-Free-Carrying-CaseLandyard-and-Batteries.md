    <li> exactly what I expected&lt;br /&gt;decent price&lt;br /&gt;would use this seller again</li>
    <li> Does very good. Use it in nursing home.I keep it in my pocket. Easy to read.</li>
    <li> mother likes this product</li>
    <li> Compares favorably to more expensive, &amp;#34;professional&amp;#34; versions.</li>
    <li> I am very happy with the Oximeter. Especially because Walgreens had one on sale for twice the price and other ones had ridiculous prices. My nurse picked this one out. It is exactly what I need and works like one that cost too much. Thank you</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my brother who lives in another state. He received it and figured out how to use it. The batteries died rather quickly but he figured out how to change them. The meter actually pointed out to him one time that his heart was out of sync. He likes it now. It is a handy way to check your pulse and oxygen level.</li>

    <li> I got this for my 5 year old who has bad asthma so we could help monitor her pulse/ox levels at home and it does an okay job, but I don&#x27;t feel as if it is quite as consistent or accurate as I would have liked.</li>
    <li> Workin fine justwhat I orderd</li>
    <li> I own two of these.  They work great.  I&#x27;m an RN, working in home care, so I carry one with me to work everyday.  The second one is for my husband who has COPD and should be using his O2 every day.  He checks his oxygen levels quite a few times a day.  He&#x27;s also had those levels checked regularly at the pulmonologist&#x27;s office and this one appears to be rather accurate.</li>
    <li> This is my second ChoiceMed Oximeter.  I bought this one so I could always have one with my portable tank and my home system.</li>
    <li> We have found the choice Med to be as accurate as the one used in our Doctors office. Highly recommend to persons needing to monitor O2 levels.</li>
    <li> Very good gadget, I am pleased with it.</li>
    <li> have asthma-need to keep check on oxygen levels</li>
    <li> Fast shipping, the unit came missing a carrying case.  Disappointed.</li>
