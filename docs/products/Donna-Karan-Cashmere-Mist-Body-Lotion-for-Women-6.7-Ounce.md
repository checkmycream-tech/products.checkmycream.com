      <li>The lotion is so nice and light on your skin with a soft fragrance.</li>
      <li>The lovely scent I  EXPERIENCED  with this cream when I purchased IT FROM A RETAILER is missing.</li>

    <li> This was a wonderful gift. My sister loves this lotion.  I don&#x27;t have a personal experience with it but my sister uses it lavishly.</li>
    <li> I stumbled on to Cashmere Mist several years ago. I enjoy soft light scent. I have purchased the Eau De Parfum, Eau De Toilet, body lotion, and deodorant. I have enjoyed all of these products but lately I have purchased the body lotion. I usually purchase this from a local department store for a higher price even after a coupon. Loved finding it at Amazon!</li>
    <li> This is best lotion I have used for 10 years now. Being a senior citizen, I have extra dry skin, so it&#x27;s important to keep my skin hydrated. Donna Karan does this for me.</li>
    <li> This body lotion has been a favorite of mine for years.&lt;br /&gt;Whether out on the town, shopping or reading a book, the fragrance seems like an aroma therapy for me.</li>

    <li> The best body lotion. Makes your skin feel so smooth</li>

    <li> I really like this.  I have been using this lotion for a long time.  Being able to order from you saves me a lot of time.</li>
    <li> Great smell and nice smoothing effects on the skin.</li>
    <li> I feel like a million dollars when I am wearing it,,,</li>
    <li> I love the fragnance of this body lotion. When I can afford it I&#x27;ll buy the perfume as well. I&#x27;ve had a sample of this years ago and have kept the empty tube so I could remember the name of it.</li>
    <li> Excellent transaction and this fragrance and lotion is the greatest ever!</li>
    <li> I love this lotion. Great price and speedy service.</li>
    <li> have order this lotion many times for my wife......this lotion is one of her nicest.....has a really nice scent</li>
    <li> I really like this because, it&#x27;s soft and last all day.</li>
    <li> I chose this rating because I love Cashmere Mist Body Lotion.  I cannot use sprays and I love body lotion especially this one. I bought one for my daughter and for me because I had ran out.  I would definitely recommend this product.  I have been using this product for about 8 years.  I have allergies and I can use this without any problem.</li>
    <li> This is the one scent I&#x27;ve been able to find that doesn&#x27;t trigger an allergic reaction for me.  Light and pleasant.  The lotion itself goes on smoothly and is absorbed quickly.  Unfortunately I can&#x27;t even use the Cashmere Mist Perfume Spray due to my allergies, just the Body Lotion.  I wish Amazon sold the powder, I&#x27;d try that!</li>
    <li> I love this scent, the consistency is thick and soft. Not only is the smell light and enjoyable but my skin is softer out of the shower before I reapply. My local Macy&#x27;s was backordered so I ordered here and was very happy with the transaction and product.</li>
    <li> I love this lotion.  The price was so good compared to a department store.</li>
    <li> A Christmas present for my wife. She likes the aroma and I do as well. This was a good price and I didn&#x27;t have to figure out where to get it.</li>
    <li> Love the scent!!!  Need to get more!!</li>
    <li> I did contact Amazon and had no response. I am very upset because I paid right away and seller never sent the item.  I am questioning Amazon&#x27;s policy to allow this seller to continue to sell on Amazon.  End</li>
    <li> Got this as a birthday gift and was blown away by its fragrance and texture (the birthday girl let me try some). I am going to have to add the Cashmere Mist line to my fragance routine!</li>
    <li> So sorry I bought this product.  Not what I expected for the price which was very costly.  I had run out of Donna Karan Cashmere Mist Body Cream and decided to buy this body lotion thinking it would be the same as the body cream.  The scent is not as powerful as the body cream.  I don&#x27;t understand it.....you can barely smell it.  But I&#x27;m stuck with it.  Won&#x27;t buy again.</li>
    <li> great product....fast shipping!!!</li>
    <li> Nice fragrance for the solution to eliminating dryness from washing your hands at work. .</li>
    <li> Bought this for my grandma and she loves it. Shes familiar with this lotion. My mother in law loves it too. Fast shipping.</li>
    <li> Sent this to my sis for her bday with the parfum. She loved both. I would have preferred a nicer container for the body lotion for a product costing this much.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my wife, as she really likes it. Plus it does smell good!</li>
    <li> This scent is fresh and very pleasing.  I find that using a lotion along with cologne enhances the lingering scent which lasts much longer.  I&#x27;m happy with the purchase.</li>
    <li> This is a lovely soft scent</li>
    <li> Heavenly, light scent. Subtle and classy.</li>
    <li> This has become my new favorite scent. In fact I think I will order more!</li>
    <li> Does not have as nice a scent as the one that came with my initial purchase of cologne. Plus, it is pretty expensive for a tube of lotion that doesn&#x27;t smell as nice as the first one I bought.  I would not buy this again.</li>
    <li> I wore another fragrance for 30 years until they discontinued the body lotion.  I like to layer my body lotion with my cologne.  It was difficult to search for a new fragrance.  I wanted something fresh that wouldn&#x27;t give me a headache.  This smells so great and really fresh.  I&#x27;m hooked!</li>
    <li> This is a craveable lotion. My skin smells so warm and soft enveloped in this fragrance. Personally I prefer the lotion over the actual spray on fragrance for its subtle yet alluring properties. Give it a try-you&#x27;ll see!</li>
    <li> Great product at an unbeatable price, that said ULTA is where I shop normally and they did have the product in various sizes at almost the same price, plus you get to shop all their fab items...try ULTA first then come here</li>
    <li> My favorite fragrance. Very light and soft. Received right away. Always order thru Amazon.</li>
    <li> My daughters favorite scent and brand which made a great birthday gift to go with the same Eau De Parfum.</li>
    <li> The lovely scent I  EXPERIENCED  with this cream when I purchased IT FROM A RETAILER is missing.</li>
    <li> I love it.!!!  Not much else to say.. except be very careful in buying as the lotion container and the body cleanser are very similar</li>
    <li> This my favorite scent.  I get more compliments on this scent than any I ever used.  I would recommend it to all.....</li>
