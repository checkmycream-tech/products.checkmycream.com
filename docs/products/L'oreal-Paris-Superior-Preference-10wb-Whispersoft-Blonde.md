      <li>and I love it.</li>
      <li>So glad we found it on here.</li>
      <li>they always change my favorite shades</li>
      <li>The  best blonde I&#x27;ve ever used</li>
      <li>Loreal told me they stoped making it because they did not have many request for this color</li>
      <li>SO GLAD THAT AMAZON HAS IT IN STOCK</li>
      <li>Love this product.</li>
      <li>I am so pleased to be able to buy this on line</li>
      <li>Otherwise I would love it.</li>
      <li>I getallot of nice comments on this color shame it is being discontinued and I was lucky to find these three ,</li>
      <li>Loved the idea, didn&#x27;t really work for me</li>
      <li>this product is easy to use, the most beautiful blonde hair coloring i have ever used.</li>

      <li>Would recommend it to anyone wanting a light ash blond look.  </li>
      <li>The price is good and I will continue to order as long as it is still available to purchase.  </li>

      <li>Whispersoft Blonde is the best to color grey I have ever found.</li>
      <li>but obviously it is worth it.</li>
      <li>This is my favorite color, can&#x27;t find it in the retail stores I frequent.  </li>
      <li>First let me say you will probably ONLY get the color results on the box if you have bleached hair or very very light hair. !</li>
      <li>Not bad for boxed hair color, certainly beats the price for a root touch-up at the salon.  </li>
      <li>I have been using Whispersoft Blonde for years and it is my favorite color.  </li>
      <li>This is really great hair color by Loreal...as usual!  </li>
      <li>Thanks for the fast service.</li>
      <li>very toxic, i was dizzy for two nights after dying hair with this color.</li>
      <li>This didn&#x27;t appear to do much for my hair.</li>
      <li>Might want to add an anti-red packet from the beauty supply, if your hair pulls warm or gold, as the developer in this product is not much greater than 10 volume.</li>
      <li>and I had to pay alot more for it that usual.  </li>
      <li>and looks more natural than the other blonde hair coloring i have used.</li>
      <li>This is my favorite hair color - I just wish it wasn&#x27;t so hard to find.  </li>
      <li>I was delighted to find it on this site as it has been difficult to find.</li>
      <li>FROM AMAZON.&lt;br /&gt;IT&#x27;S A VERY NATURAL SHADE OF BLONDE</li>
      <li>I have used this color and brand for years and apparently they don&#x27;t sell it any longer in the stores</li>
      <li>It takes out the red and grey in my hair and gives me a natural blonde look.  </li>

    <li> Best color that I have found for being blond.....L&#x27;Oreal has wonderful blond colors and my hair stays in decent condition using this product.  Since I do my roots every 2 weeks, it can get expensive but obviously it is worth it.</li>
    <li> They don&#x27;t make this anymore so I&#x27;ve had to get it on Amazon.  It&#x27;s a very natural, pale blonde.. The  best blonde I&#x27;ve ever used and I&#x27;ve used &amp;#34;quite a few&amp;#34;.  Wish they would start making this again!</li>
    <li> .this is hard to find...they always change my favorite shades</li>
    <li> I love this color. I receive many compliaments every day from people I don&#x27;t know. Would recommend it to anyone wanting a light ash blond look.  I have used this product for many years and my hair always looks healthy and soft----never burned or frizzed. I was delighted to find it on this site as it has been difficult to find. It seems to have been discontinued. I am so sad as it is the only color I enjoy wearing----and others love it on me. I am hoping that L&#x27;Oreal will decide to reinstate this color.</li>
    <li> This product is my favorite hair color.  It is one that has been discontinued by L&#x27;Oreal and this is the only place that I can purchase this product.  It has worked for me and I get many compliments on my hair color.  The price is good and I will continue to order as long as it is still available to purchase.  I have no answer as to why L&#x27;Oreal discontinued this color.  If anyone knows, please post.  This is the second time that I have had to make changes because of this. As I said, I am so happy to have found a source.</li>
    <li> this product is easy to use, the most beautiful blonde hair coloring i have ever used. and looks more natural than the other blonde hair coloring i have used. I Recommend this product.</li>
    <li> now I understand all the rave reviews and ppl stocking up...best color ever, ez, and discontinued...searching for more...any tips?</li>

    <li> I am so pleased to be able to buy this on line&lt;br /&gt;it is no longer in stores and L&#x27;oreal does not say which new&lt;br /&gt;color it replaces.  I get so tired of finding a color and the&lt;br /&gt;manufactures just take it off the market.</li>
