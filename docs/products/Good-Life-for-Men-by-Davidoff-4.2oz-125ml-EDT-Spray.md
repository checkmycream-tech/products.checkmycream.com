      <li>Davidoff Good life is a great scent.</li>
      <li>Best scent nothing else like it and the lady&#x27;s love</li>
      <li>Loved this product and it was outstanding!!</li>
      <li>The downside is that Good Life has been discontinued.  </li>
      <li>My wife gives Good Life a thumbs up.</li>
      <li>That said, a check of online pricing reveals that if you want some of the Good Life - you will pay a premium.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve always loved this perfume.</li>
      <li>Since I have an aversion for mall shopping I went online and discovered Good Life.  </li>
      <li>It allways makes me feel good when I smell it.</li>
      <li>Every time I wear Good Life</li>
      <li>While I would feel comfortable wearing Good Life during any season, perhaps Autumn or Spring are ideal.  </li>
      <li>One of the rare and the best cologne.  </li>
      <li>I really love Good life.</li>
      <li>Can&#x27;t say more because good things speak for themselves.</li>
      <li>Absolutely the best.</li>
      <li>Good Life for Men is quite possibly the best smelling cologne I have ever purchased or smelled.</li>
      <li>In addition to being one of my favorite names, the Good Life is one of my favorite Davidoff fragrances.  </li>
      <li>Davidoff&#x27;s \\&quot;Good Life\\&quot; is a rare, excellent scent, much like Hermes&#x27; Mediterranean scents.  </li>
      <li>The Good Life is truly a pleasant blend of amber, citrus, floral, and sandalwood notes that settles into a herbal, almost grassy&amp;#34;, and woodsy fragrance that is fresh and easy on the nose.  </li>
      <li>It is mild but noticeable, in a good way.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t last but a couple hours at best.</li>
      <li>but I really like it the good life nice name</li>
      <li>but you better take the bottle with you.  </li>
      <li>A favorite cologne of mine.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s my favorite.  </li>
      <li>I gave it a try and was glad that I did.</li>
      <li>but it was a top 10 scent according to a respected men&#x27;s magazine.</li>
      <li>Therefore when I ordered it from amazon, I was very excited.</li>
      <li>This product is light and smooth with a mild citrus aroma which is a welcome additon to the rest of my colognes.  </li>
      <li>I proudly and highly recommend it.</li>
      <li>Do the right thing..!!</li>
      <li>It has much more of a character and lasts longer than Davidoff&#x27;s \\&quot;Cool Water.\\&quot;  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll buy again if it&#x27;s available.</li>
      <li>Additionally, Good Life offers versatility that it can be worn day or night or for any occasion.&lt;br</li>
      <li>It has an unique smell and even lasts for sometime.</li>
      <li>If you consider yourself grown up, then this is worth a try!</li>
      <li>It is a very clean refreshing and masculine fragrance.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Final tally for Good Life is 4.1 stars out of a possible 5.  </li>
      <li>I recently purchased Davidoff&#x27;s Good Life for my husband.  </li>
      <li>Mild enduring fragrance</li>
      <li>It is a smooth, sophisticated, masculine scent unlike the cookie-cutter men&#x27;s fragrancess that are everywhere</li>
      <li>The &amp;#34;Wow Factor&amp;#34; (comments from the opposite sex) exists - I have had more comments wearing other fragrances, but Good Life has great potential.  </li>
      <li>I am a huge fan of the Davidoff fragrances - I have many in my collection nearing 500 bottles (ok - I guess I am a little OCD..).  </li>
      <li>it brings back great memories of some old days when i used to wear it.    </li>
      <li>Fresh, and somewhat sensual.  </li>
      <li>\\&quot;I smell good.\\&quot;  Worth every penny.  </li>
      <li>If you want a citrus dash , this is the right one .</li>
      <li>I am glad I have 3/4 a bottle that is only used sporadically.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottle and packaging are first class.  </li>
      <li>I love the fragrance but doesn&#x27;t stay on for long.</li>
      <li>I hope that you will carry it again real soon.  </li>
      <li>But somehow results aren&#x27;t very encouraging..there is no sign of it after say 1-2 hrs of using it.</li>
      <li>Very manly.  </li>
      <li>From what I understand, this cologne was recently available in Europe only.  </li>
      <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
      <li>The scent is very pleasing sort of citrus lime but masculine and not overpowering.</li>
      <li>This is the first one which I feel is not long masting at all.</li>
      <li>Like this alot smell nice never smelt anything like it be for hard to find for a low price</li>
      <li>Completely exceeds quality, shame it is a scarce item because I believe Davidoff discontinued making it.</li>
      <li>If you can find it at a reasonable price, I definitely recommend adding to your collection.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I am especially fond of the bottle - clear and designed that portrays class.  </li>
      <li>The juice is good - too bad it has been discontinued.  </li>

    <li> I recently purchased Davidoff&#x27;s Good Life for my husband.

    <li> If you want a citrus dash , this is the right one . Mild enduring fragrance</li>
    <li> I thought the name of this cologne was corny but it was a top 10 scent according to a respected men&#x27;s magazine. I gave it a try and was glad that I did. The scent is very pleasing sort of citrus lime but masculine and not overpowering. People notice it and almost always say \\&quot;You smell good\\&quot; and ask what it is.  It makes me happy when I wear it. I am an optimist and guess that might have attracted me also to the name but I think it is a truly great cologne.</li>
    <li> If you consider yourself grown up, then this is worth a try! Can&#x27;t say more because good things speak for themselves.</li>

    <li> It was just as I espected it.</li>
    <li> The only bad thing is that it&#x27;s not for sale in stores anymore. Best scent nothing else like it and the lady&#x27;s love it guys</li>

    <li> I really love Good life. it brings back great memories of some old days when i used to wear it.    It has an unique smell and even lasts for sometime. you wont get tired of it and you will always want it on you.    I highly recommend it.</li>

    <li> Every time I wear Good Life someone tell&#x27;s me \\&quot;I smell good.\\&quot;  Worth every penny.  Definitely one of my favorites.  .</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always loved this perfume.Therefore when I ordered it from amazon, I was very excited. But somehow results aren&#x27;t very encouraging..there is no sign of it after say 1-2 hrs of using it. I know perfumes work differently with different people but I haven&#x27;t had any bad experience with me till date.This is the first one which I feel is not long masting at all. I love the fragrance but doesn&#x27;t stay on for long.</li>
    <li> Loved this product and it was outstanding!! I hope that you will carry it again real soon.  Do you plan to carry it again? Please, Please, do.</li>
    <li> I am a huge fan of the Davidoff fragrances - I have many in my collection nearing 500 bottles (ok - I guess I am a little OCD..).  In addition to being one of my favorite names, the Good Life is one of my favorite Davidoff fragrances.  The juice is good - too bad it has been discontinued.

I am especially fond of the bottle - clear and designed that portrays class.  Well done Davidoff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now... The rest of the story... The downside is that Good Life has been discontinued.  That said, a check of online pricing reveals that if you want some of the Good Life - you will pay a premium.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Final tally for Good Life is 4.1 stars out of a possible 5.  Everything about this fragrance is great with the exception of the price/value.  If you can find it at a reasonable price, I definitely recommend adding to your collection.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Daily I.M - Today is an opportunity to make a difference in someone&#x27;s life.  Do the right thing..!!</li>
    <li> One of the rare and the best cologne.  Absolutely the best. I can&#x27;t believe it&#x27;s discontinued. Get it while it&#x27;s still out there.</li>
    <li> Yes, it smells great but you better take the bottle with you.  It doesn&#x27;t last but a couple hours at best.</li>
