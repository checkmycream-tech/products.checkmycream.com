<li> The tip of the arrow leaves a small indent on the finger but still worth the buy.</li>
<li> I was super bummed it broke four hours late when I bumped it on a table.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s thin and small, which is exactly what I wanted!</li>
<li> so I didn&#x27;t have to adjust it, but from what other reviews say, adjusting it can be problematic.</li>
<li> so now I am very careful with it.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve worn it a few times and it is still shiny, the color hasn&#x27;t worn off, and there are no signs of green left on my finger.</li>
<li> After that the heat from my finger made it split in half.</li>
<li> but the metal turned black after 24 hours of wearing it.</li>
<li> The ring didn&#x27;t make my skin turn black or green</li>
<li> I can see that when I bent it, it already cracked a little</li>
<li> Turns my finger green and the paint came off.</li>
<li> I didn&#x27;t even get to wear it for longer than half an hour!</li>
<li> Too bad it broke the first day.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s rather small</li>
<li> Hasn&#x27;t turned my finger green yet!</li>
<li> I&#x27;m not sure</li>
<li> It was poorly shaped.</li>
<li> I just put the ring on my finger ,that broken to half.i</li>
<li> Just really bad quality, not worth it.</li>
<li> I bought it for a Christmas gift for my daughter as I am one of those annoying people that Christmas shop all year.</li>

    <li> Cute little ring. Shipping took a while, but it was from China. The ring is about a size 6-7 and it fit my finger perfectly so I didn&#x27;t have to adjust it, but from what other reviews say, adjusting it can be problematic. The ring didn&#x27;t make my skin turn black or green and it&#x27;s sturdy enough to wear all day. Overall, I&#x27;m very pleased.</li>
    <li> good for price.. very small wish was thicker and broad but fits fine on my fingers.</li>
