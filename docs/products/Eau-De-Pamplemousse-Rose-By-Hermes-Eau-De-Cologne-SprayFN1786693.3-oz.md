      <li>Delivered on time as promised at a fair price.</li>
      <li>It brings to mind Pimm&#x27;s Cup, gin &amp; tonics, country club brunches, summer picnics and all manner of good things.  </li>
      <li>Today is May 2, and another request for delay came, for May 7 or 8th shipment at the very latest.</li>
      <li>Very elegant</li>

      <li>nice</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m a summer loving girl and this spray</li>
      <li>I liked it.</li>
      <li>If you&#x27;re looking for a rose scent, this is not what you want, but I love it.</li>
      <li>It reminds me of being on a summer hike and catching a lovely combination of scents drifting through the air.</li>
      <li>A quick spray at neck and wrists give me a beautiful scent to enjoy all day and it isn&#x27;t overpowering, just pleasant and fresh.  </li>
      <li>I will be honest and say this is a pretty good</li>
      <li>I am just feeling the love.</li>
      <li>One of my favorite cologne&#x27;s and definitely my favorite by Hermes.</li>
      <li>This cologne is considered EDC (Eau De Cologne) as opposed to most \\&quot;colognes\\&quot;</li>
      <li>I have had better experience with another vendor called \\&quot;stores123.\\&quot;</li>
      <li>It is advertised as unisex but seems more feminine to me.</li>
      <li>sums up some favorites, citrus with a light scent of rose.  </li>
      <li>Love this cologne.  </li>
      <li>As a woman, I love wearing this but would also like it on a man.</li>
      <li>I think the Hermes store is charging more for it, i got this for my boyfriend on his birthday and how I love the way he smells.</li>
      <li>Highly recommended!!!!!</li>
      <li>5-stars for a decent price, and a Happy B-day for sis.</li>
      <li>The combination of citrus and rose is inviting rather than sweet.</li>
      <li>It has a nice fruity scent at first and then warms up to more earthy tones as the day goes on.</li>
      <li>It is a true unisex fragrance, is good for men who want something fresh and not overpowering, and for women who don&#x27;t want fragrance too girly or powdery but fresh.</li>
      <li>this is one of my favorite scents ,its very old school ,but that&#x27;s why I like it, rose and grapefruit .very</li>
      <li>This fragrance is a great creation too, cheerful citrus notes which are made more whispering with the addition of rose, which than fades into woody base,is delicate and pleasurable.</li>
      <li>Smells great initially (grapefruit/citrus hints) but as it wears on it morphs into a smell I do not care for.</li>
      <li>Great Summer fragrance, for the classical citrus notes, but also for its delicacy which, in my opinion, is very well suited for warm weather.</li>
      <li>I was able to return my cologne thanks to the retailer and I purchased the \\&quot;concentrate\\&quot; version which is more of an EDT.</li>
      <li>Overall, a great product that makes you happy wearing it and makes you feel like you have a little bit of summer with you even when you are wearing a sweater</li>
      <li>As it is the case with citrus fragrances, the longevity isn&#x27;t great, but we know this, and this is to be expected.</li>
      <li>She adores the citrus notes caught by her nose, while her hubby&#x27;s nose was enraptured by light, fresh floral notes...</li>
      <li>I had tried it at the store and loved it, but after purchasing it here on Amazon it felt like it had no lasting ability.</li>
      <li>and it is my new favorite scent.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s amazing that I paid half the price of what it retails for in most department stores.  </li>
      <li>Fresh smell.</li>
      <li>Hermes got the balance right on this one.</li>
      <li>It is one of the few (if not only) colognes made for men blending rose and citric scents without it seeming too feminine or overwhelming ...or cheap for that matter.</li>
      <li>Eau de Pamplemousse Rose is, as its name suggests, redolent of pink grapefruit.  </li>
      <li>I went to Nordstrom first and smelled the fragrance myself.</li>
      <li>fake(it even smells funny like it was made in some hole in the wall place in India), and that&#x27;s why I give it 2 stars.</li>
      <li>First was turned on to</li>
      <li>The Hermes fragrance collection rarely disappoints, and really has staying power.</li>
      <li>The Vert Spray 2.5 Oz]] and First for Van Cleef&amp; Arpels, pure masteworks.</li>
      <li>I first found it at a retail store but didn&#x27;t buy it at $125; I was thrilled to find it at half the price on Amazon</li>
      <li>And I was then CERTAIN</li>
      <li>This fragrance fits very well in the Hermes fragrances line,very much Hermes style.</li>
      <li>If you spray it on too closely on your skin, the grapefruit is too intense.</li>
      <li>Eau De Pamplemousse Rose By Hermes last year as a birthday present.</li>
      <li>It is best to spray it on at some distance, and then you&#x27;ll get a lovely, subtle grapefruit mixed with a light floral note, that settles into a fresh woodsy base.</li>
      <li>The rose adds just flowery refinement, makes the fragrance very classy and watercolor-like and woody base not makes this  very elegant.</li>
      <li>When I purchased this one I smelled a strong smell of alcohol on it, which then were calmed down.</li>
      <li>amazon one had a new UPC code and the factory numbers on the bottle didn&#x27;t match the package either.</li>
      <li>How most fragrances are made are with a small percentage of the fragrance (1-20%) and then the rest is alcohol.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Amazon first wrote to apologize about late shipment and asked for approval for such shipment to be April 25 or 26th at the latest.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not a trendy scent nor does it have any of the chemical edges that so many new fragrances do.  </li>
      <li>, it is a little too floral for most guys I know, and hubby definitely would not wear it, but for me it is one of the nicest scents I have.  </li>
      <li>The citrus notes are very citrusy, someone described them as squeezed oils from orange peels, and I agree, it has this quality, similar  to fragrance which appears when peeling an orange</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s organic, sophisticated, subtle, and masculine without being macho.  </li>
      <li>Always enjoyed this product and has owned several bottles of it in the past few years, but never will I order it through a third-party vendor called Tuccini.</li>
      <li>It is not a long lasting scent so will need several applications through the day to maintain.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This fragrance fits very well in the Hermes fragrances line,very much Hermes style. Jean-Claude Ellena was the creator of Pamplemousse Rose,great perfumeur, made also [[ASIN:B000XE5M06 Bvlgari Eau Parfumee By Bvlgari For Women. Cologne Au The Vert Spray 2.5 Oz]] and First for Van Cleef&amp; Arpels, pure masteworks. This fragrance is a great creation too, cheerful citrus notes which are made more whispering with the addition of rose, which than fades into woody base,is delicate and pleasurable. As it is the case with citrus fragrances, the longevity isn&#x27;t great, but we know this, and this is to be expected. The citrus notes are very citrusy, someone described them as squeezed oils from orange peels, and I agree, it has this quality, similar  to fragrance which appears when peeling an orange the is which wonderful whiff of freshness.The rose adds just flowery refinement, makes the fragrance very classy and watercolor-like and woody base not makes this  very elegant. It is a true unisex fragrance, is good for men who want something fresh and not overpowering, and for women who don&#x27;t want fragrance too girly or powdery but fresh. Great Summer fragrance, for the classical citrus notes, but also for its delicacy which, in my opinion, is very well suited for warm weather.</li>
    <li> Very happy for this cologne. It is one of the few (if not only) colognes made for men blending rose and citric scents without it seeming too feminine or overwhelming ...or cheap for that matter. Hermes got the balance right on this one. Great summer scent. Delivered on time as promised at a fair price.</li>
    <li> Always enjoyed this product and has owned several bottles of it in the past few years, but never will I order it through a third-party vendor called Tuccini. In Amazon.com product page, it said that it was \\&quot;In Stock,\\&quot; but since April 16, 2012 order, I have yet to see the product (it is now May 2.) Amazon first wrote to apologize about late shipment and asked for approval for such shipment to be April 25 or 26th at the latest. Then, a second update came, asking for approval of delay to be May 1 or May 2. Today is May 2, and another request for delay came, for May 7 or 8th shipment at the very latest. No, thank you. The price for this cologne at the time might have been the lowest among competitors, but it is not worth the wait.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By all means, buy the product, but just not from this vendor. I have had better experience with another vendor called \\&quot;stores123.\\&quot;</li>
    <li> Great summer scent, lasts for about 4 hours. For longer-lasting scent, I&#x27;d go for the concentrated version.</li>
    <li> This stuff was terrible. I had tried it at the store and loved it, but after purchasing it here on Amazon it felt like it had no lasting ability. I could spray on a ton and it would last for about five minutes before you couldn&#x27;t smell it again. Skip it.</li>
    <li> Eau de Pamplemousse Rose is, as its name suggests, redolent of pink grapefruit.  It brings to mind Pimm&#x27;s Cup, gin &amp; tonics, country club brunches, summer picnics and all manner of good things.  It&#x27;s not a trendy scent nor does it have any of the chemical edges that so many new fragrances do.  It&#x27;s organic, sophisticated, subtle, and masculine without being macho.  It&#x27;s one of the best warm weather scents there is.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband and he loves it!  The scent is just awesome even I have put it on on occasion.  It&#x27;s amazing that I paid half the price of what it retails for in most department stores.  Highly recommended!!!!!</li>
    <li> One of my favorite cologne&#x27;s and definitely my favorite by Hermes. It has a nice fruity scent at first and then warms up to more earthy tones as the day goes on. Very elegant</li>
    <li> I received this as a present from the hubby for Christmas.  I&#x27;m a summer loving girl and this spray sums up some favorites, citrus with a light scent of rose.  A quick spray at neck and wrists give me a beautiful scent to enjoy all day and it isn&#x27;t overpowering, just pleasant and fresh.  I would not necessarily think of this as unisex though, it is a little too floral for most guys I know, and hubby definitely would not wear it, but for me it is one of the nicest scents I have.  A wonderful indulgence!  Overall, a great product that makes you happy wearing it and makes you feel like you have a little bit of summer with you even when you are wearing a sweater and the days are cold.</li>
    <li> Fresh smell. I liked it.</li>
    <li> The Hermes fragrance collection rarely disappoints, and really has staying power. I bought this as a gift for my sister. She was of course elated with a birthday surprise, neatly wrapped and shipped. Her feedback is all about chemistry... She adores the citrus notes caught by her nose, while her hubby&#x27;s nose was enraptured by light, fresh floral notes... Eau de Pamplemousse Rose is labeled as unisex. Such versatility, Hermes! 5-stars for a decent price, and a Happy B-day for sis.</li>
    <li> Unfortunately this is a bootleg version of the real thing. How do I know? I went to Nordstrom first and smelled the fragrance myself. When I purchased this one I smelled a strong smell of alcohol on it, which then were calmed down. To further my investigation I bought the Nordstrom one to compare. And I was then CERTAIN the one bought on amazon was a fake. I will be honest and say this is a pretty good fake(it even smells funny like it was made in some hole in the wall place in India), and that&#x27;s why I give it 2 stars. 1 for being a fake and promoting it as the actual one. 2nd star for it being close to the original.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The amazon one had a new UPC code and the factory numbers on the bottle didn&#x27;t match the package either.</li>
    <li> this is one of my favorite scents ,its very old school ,but that&#x27;s why I like it, rose and grapefruit .very nice</li>
    <li> Smells great initially (grapefruit/citrus hints) but as it wears on it morphs into a smell I do not care for.</li>
    <li> Crisp, surprisingly complex unisex fragrance. The combination of citrus and rose is inviting rather than sweet. As a woman, I love wearing this but would also like it on a man.</li>
    <li> I think the Hermes store is charging more for it, i got this for my boyfriend on his birthday and how I love the way he smells. It lasts for AGES and it smells beautiful.</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re looking for a rose scent, this is not what you want, but I love it. The name translates to pink grapefruit and it is my new favorite scent. It is best to spray it on at some distance, and then you&#x27;ll get a lovely, subtle grapefruit mixed with a light floral note, that settles into a fresh woodsy base. If you spray it on too closely on your skin, the grapefruit is too intense. There&#x27;s something intoxicating about this fragrance. It reminds me of being on a summer hike and catching a lovely combination of scents drifting through the air. It is not a long lasting scent so will need several applications through the day to maintain. It&#x27;s a great day fragrance as it&#x27;s not overpowering, and very refreshing when applied as recommended. It is advertised as unisex but seems more feminine to me. I first found it at a retail store but didn&#x27;t buy it at $125; I was thrilled to find it at half the price on Amazon and it is my go-to scent now.</li>
    <li> Happy with purchase.  Love this cologne.  Will purchase again.</li>
    <li> First was turned on to Eau De Pamplemousse Rose By Hermes last year as a birthday present. When I ran out, it I felt like a junkie going through withdrawals.  So I robbed a house, and took the money I got for selling the TV to a fence and ordered another bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now I am just feeling the love.</li>
    <li> I got it as a gift for my wife. The price and convenience are hard to beat. Will buy it again</li>
    <li> EDIT: I originally wrote a review stating how I think the fragrance is fake but I later realized how wrong I was. This cologne is considered EDC (Eau De Cologne) as opposed to most \\&quot;colognes\\&quot; which are EDT (eau de toilette). How most fragrances are made are with a small percentage of the fragrance (1-20%) and then the rest is alcohol.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THIS cologne is EDC which has a lower fragrance percentage than EDT which is why the smell does not last very long and is not strong. I was able to return my cologne thanks to the retailer and I purchased the \\&quot;concentrate\\&quot; version which is more of an EDT.</li>
