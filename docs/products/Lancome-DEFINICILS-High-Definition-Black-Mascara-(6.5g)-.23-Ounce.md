      <li>The best  mascara I have used.</li>
      <li>Lancome Definicils is the best for me.  </li>
      <li>, however Fiberwig has got to be the best mascara product.  </li>
      <li>This is still the best mascara Lancome makes, and I&#x27;ve been using their mascara&#x27;s for years.</li>
      <li>and i have to say I&#x27;m impressed with their line</li>
      <li>The  mascara has been a wonderful product!</li>
      <li>I bought this mascara after researching best mascaras online and reading the rave reviews this mascara receives.</li>
      <li>Best!</li>
      <li>To me it is the perfect Mascara.</li>
      <li>and I believe it is the best on the market.  </li>
      <li>It is great, no clumping and lasts.</li>
      <li>As always this mascare is amazing!</li>
      <li>I have tried many mascaras and this is without a doubt the best.</li>
      <li>Yes there are some really good ones, but they don&#x27;t neccessarily cost $30.  </li>
      <li>I love Lancome Definicils mascara and have used it for years!  </li>
      <li>LOVE this mascara!</li>
      <li>I have used this particular mascara for quite some time and find it to be the best.</li>
      <li>It makes my lashes look longer, more pronounced, and I feel very comfortable that my eyelashes are looking their best.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I love Definicils.  </li>
      <li>After trying it, I do not understand why so many women swear by it.</li>
      <li>Fantastic!</li>
      <li>I do find it to be very important to make sure it is fresh, and for that reason, I am especially pleased that Amazon has a program for recurring shipments on a schedule of my choosing, which is every other month.</li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t irritate my eyes, doesn&#x27;t come off, yet it is easily removed.  </li>
      <li>This mascara is just the best on the market, hands down..</li>
      <li>I was a huge fan of a mascara called Accentuous.  </li>
      <li>They are great quality and work wonderfully especially for seperating without getting cluncky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Buy two and free delivery.    </li>
      <li>I purchased this after a friend stated how much she liked it, but I found that it was not as \\&quot;volumizing\\&quot; than the L&#x27;Oreal mascara I&#x27;d been using.  </li>
      <li>Rich and covers beautifully, I have used this product for years, can&#x27;t use any other after using Lancome defincils mascara.</li>
      <li>I have always loved their mascaras, though I have never actually bought them, it seems I always have a ton of these that they give a way for free during the bonus gifts time.  </li>
      <li>It wipes off cleanly with a cleansing cloth.</li>
      <li>-too &#x27;quick drying&#x27;.  </li>
      <li>Read about this product in Super Saver magazine and tried it.  </li>
      <li>Since then, I have wandered from one brand to the next trying to find something, anything, even as remotely effective.  </li>
      <li>Maybe the cheaper (L&#x27;Oreal, Cover Girl, etc.) have gotten better or this formula changed, but it&#x27;s not as great as I remember it - especially when it&#x27;s three times the price of other mascaras.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>you already have full lashes, it does a nice job of separating them, but not much for lengthening or thickening them.</li>
      <li>black mascara coats each lash from base to tip, for superb definition and length resulting in perfectly defined lashes.  </li>
      <li>I thought maybe I was applying it wrong, so I researched the best ways to apply mascara.</li>
      <li>Astonishingly, L&#x27;Oreal took this gem off the market several years ago.  </li>
      <li>contents of the bottle dry out too quickly necessitating more frequent purchases of said product and moreover  </li>
      <li>And it was a bit dry compared to the nice new and fresh ones I get at the local stores</li>
      <li>So many other brands tend to be clumpy.</li>
      <li>If you haven&#x27;t bought this mascara before, you may want to try it in the store before buying (and make sure not to wear any other mascara to the store)!</li>
      <li>Although I have tried many other brands, I always come back to this product.</li>
      <li>When I read on a blog that this product was made by the same company and was, in fact, the same product in a different package, I quickly and eagerly made my purchase.    </li>
      <li>Maybe the product varies tube by tube, but I usually buy cheap drug store mascara and tried this because of rave reviews everywhere.</li>
      <li>;.. yes they are long to start with, but not especially thick.</li>

    <li> The best  mascara I have used. Have used this product for years and will not change, even when I get samples of others I give them away.</li>
    <li> I was a huge fan of a mascara called Accentuous.  Astonishingly, L&#x27;Oreal took this gem off the market several years ago.  Since then, I have wandered from one brand to the next trying to find something, anything, even as remotely effective.  When I read on a blog that this product was made by the same company and was, in fact, the same product in a different package, I quickly and eagerly made my purchase.    It is not.  sigh.    Lancome DEFINICILS High Definition Black Mascara is just like any other mascara out there, but worse in that it is:  -too expensive  -too small a quantity  -too &#x27;quick drying&#x27;.  contents of the bottle dry out too quickly necessitating more frequent purchases of said product and moreover  -difficult to apply without forming clumps because it dries too quickly on the lashes which makes it difficult to control its application.    I gave it 2 stars b/c yes, it is a mascara and works like a mascara and yes, it is black.</li>
    <li> I have used this particular mascara for quite some time and find it to be the best. So many other brands tend to be clumpy. I do find it to be very important to make sure it is fresh, and for that reason, I am especially pleased that Amazon has a program for recurring shipments on a schedule of my choosing, which is every other month. I don&#x27;t have to remember how long I have been using the current one, and there is a discount for signing up for recurring shipments!</li>
    <li> Maybe the product varies tube by tube, but I usually buy cheap drug store mascara and tried this because of rave reviews everywhere. It&#x27;s awful for me. Wet clumpy blobs that are a big mess. Not sure if it&#x27;s just my tube, but I keep soldiering on with it since I paid so much. If I&#x27;d bought it at a drug store price it would have been in the trash long ago.</li>
    <li> I used to use Lancome products exclusively and got to the point I couldn&#x27;t afford it. Maybe the cheaper (L&#x27;Oreal, Cover Girl, etc.) have gotten better or this formula changed, but it&#x27;s not as great as I remember it - especially when it&#x27;s three times the price of other mascaras.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you already have full lashes, it does a nice job of separating them, but not much for lengthening or thickening them.</li>
    <li> Read about this product in Super Saver magazine and tried it.  It is great, no clumping and lasts.</li>
    <li> I bought this mascara after researching best mascaras online and reading the rave reviews this mascara receives. I often have problems with spider lashes when I use mascara (not clumps of mascara, but multiple lashes sticking together), and I was hoping this mascara would correct that problem. After trying it, I do not understand why so many women swear by it. It stuck my lashes together and went on really heavy, even with only one coat. I thought maybe I was applying it wrong, so I researched the best ways to apply mascara. This led me to try vigorously scraping off the brush on the sides of the tube to get some of the extra mascara off. It still went on too thick and heavy on my lashes! Then I tried putting some of the mascara on an eyelash comb and applying it that way. Using the eyelash comb instead of the brush to apply the mascara to my lashes helped, but when I apply other mascaras (such as Clinique High Impact Mascara in Black or Benefit Bad Gal in Plum) with the same technique I get better results than I do with the Lancome Definicils. I am going to use the Definicils anyway because it was expensive ($25 at the department store) but I will hate every minute of it! The only plus of this mascara is that it does not flake or smear, even after long days. If you are stuck with a tube of Definicils you don&#x27;t like, try the eyelash comb technique. If you haven&#x27;t bought this mascara before, you may want to try it in the store before buying (and make sure not to wear any other mascara to the store)!</li>
    <li> I purchased this after a friend stated how much she liked it, but I found that it was not as \\&quot;volumizing\\&quot; than the L&#x27;Oreal mascara I&#x27;d been using.  It wipes off cleanly with a cleansing cloth.</li>
    <li> I have always loved their mascaras, though I have never actually bought them, it seems I always have a ton of these that they give a way for free during the bonus gifts time.  They are great quality and work wonderfully especially for seperating without getting cluncky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I still don&#x27;t think Mascaras are a dime a dozen though.  Yes there are some really good ones, but they don&#x27;t neccessarily cost $30.  I&#x27;ve started using Avon since I&#x27;m a representative and i have to say I&#x27;m impressed with their line, however Fiberwig has got to be the best mascara product.  Expensive yes, but what it can do, I have yet to see another mascara do.</li>
    <li> Lancome Definicils is the best for me.  Doesn&#x27;t irritate my eyes, doesn&#x27;t come off, yet it is easily removed.  It&#x27;s a bit pricey, but the benefits outweigh the cost. I&#x27;m hooked. Cheaper at Amazon.  Buy two and free delivery.    Dolores S</li>
    <li> I love Lancome Definicils mascara and have used it for years!  I was lazy and went online to buy it instead.  It was the same price as I pay at the make up counter in the department stores so I went for it.  But when it arrived, it was the WATERPROOF version of the product which is not what I ordered.  No where in my order process online did it mention WATERPROOF.  So the product was wrong.  And it was a bit dry compared to the nice new and fresh ones I get at the local stores so I think it had been sitting on the shelf for a while.  Anyway, I will not order this again online.</li>
    <li> As always this mascare is amazing! Shipping was within a week of my ordering. I will order again in the future. I would also recommend this product to everyone.</li>
    <li> Rich and covers beautifully, I have used this product for years, can&#x27;t use any other after using Lancome defincils mascara.</li>
    <li> Best! Lasts long and does not wear off bad. ( you won&#x27;t get racoon eyes) I have tried many mascaras and this is without a doubt the best.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Lancome Definicils mascara for 5 years, and it is the only non-waterproof mascara that does not give me even a hint of \\&quot;raccoon eyes\\&quot; at the end of the day.  LOVE this mascara!</li>
    <li> I love Definicils.  To me it is the perfect Mascara. It never clumps and I use it when I&#x27;m just going down to the local store or when I&#x27;m off to a major function.  Fantastic!</li>
    <li> I have used this for several years and I believe it is the best on the market.  Recommend it for anyone who uses mascara!!</li>
    <li> I used to use Lancôme Definicils Mascara exclusively. Then I started trying different mascara s , but always came back to Definicils. It makes my lashes look longer, more pronounced, and I feel very comfortable that my eyelashes are looking their best.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; The brush on this .23 oz. black mascara coats each lash from base to tip, for superb definition and length resulting in perfectly defined lashes.  The  mascara has been a wonderful product! This does not smear or flake and I don&#x27;t even use the waterproof.....no need to! I am never without this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommended. prisrob 04-06-13</li>
    <li> This mascara is just the best on the market, hands down..it&#x27;s a must have..shows every single lash you have and lengthens to the max..Doesn&#x27;t build body but I just put on Lancome Hynose as my second coat and I have strangers tell me I have &amp;#34;Awesome lashes&amp;#34;.. yes they are long to start with, but not especially thick.</li>
    <li> This is still the best mascara Lancome makes, and I&#x27;ve been using their mascara&#x27;s for years. Although I have tried many other brands, I always come back to this product.</li>
