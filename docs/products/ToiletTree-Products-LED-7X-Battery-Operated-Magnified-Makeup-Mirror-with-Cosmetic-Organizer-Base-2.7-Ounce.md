<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I love the magnification on the mirror with the LED lights. It makes it so much easier to do my makeup and put on my contacts.  The makeup holder holds all of my makeup in one place and really helps keep my makeup table organized.  Its wonderful.</li>
    <li> The ToiletTree mirror is so helpful for me to put my makeup on and check my eyebrows for any stray hairs that need to be tweezed also. This magnified mirror really helps you to see close up. It&#x27;s so much easier than bending over and trying to get up close to the bathroom mirror. I like that the mirror is fully adjustable also, so you can position it to whatever angle you need.&lt;br /&gt;The LED ring around the mirror requires 3 AAA batteries. It really lights up bright to illuminate your face. It makes you feel kind of like a movie star.... if I don&#x27;t say so myself! The clear acrylic organizing base is really a nice addition to the mirror to store some of your beauty supplies that you use on a regular basis. This way they will be right at your fingertips. I&#x27;m really happy with the ToiletTree Makeup Mirror! I received free product for review purposes.</li>
    <li> I love this mirror!  The swiveling part is great along with the holders at the bottom for cosmetics and nail files and such.  I would buy it again.  It could have a slightly bigger diameter to improve it, but other than that it &#x27;s great!</li>
    <li> Very pleased the the makeup mirror and cosmetic organizer base.  I told all of my friends,  and happy with this product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been kind of afraid to use a mirror that is so magnified in the past. Why would I WANT to see every last imperfection on my face... or any other part of me for example?&lt;br /&gt;But then I got a derma roller, and wanted to be able to try it out and really watch what was going on and look for changes. So this mirror was perfect for that. The lights are bright, kind of shocking at first, but your eyes thankfully will adjust easily, LED lights are pretty good for that. I was pretty upset at how my face looked the first couple of times I used it. It&#x27;s... wow... this thing is just really strong. It is helpful though for helping me pull out that stray little hair that likes to grow under my chin, and the stray one that likes to grow on this &#x27;beauty mark&#x27; mole I have near my mouth.&lt;br /&gt;The storage capacity is great too! I am able to keep my tweezers, derma roller, vitamin C serum, and eye cream right at hand with this mirror!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a blogger I did receive a complimentary unit for review.</li>
    <li> I am very happy with this gift from my favorite grandmother.  It gives me compartments for my makeup and the magnifying mirror is very helpful when I am applying my eye makeup.</li>
    <li> This is a great makeup mirror and organizer! We have tiny bathrooms in our apartment, and tiny bathrooms mean tiny counters. Tiny counters mean I don&#x27;t have much room to store my makeup, or much space to work with when getting ready. This makeup organizer is absolutely perfect for my small space! It fits perfectly on the corner of my bathroom counter and gives me easy access to all of my makeup essentials. It has just enough compartments to store each of my key pieces that I need for getting ready. I love that the whole organizer is clear so that you can easily see where everything is. The height and size of the mirror are great. The fact that the mirror is lighted is awesome because it helps to brighten up your face so that you can really see what you&#x27;re doing. Personally, the 7x magnification is a bit much for me. I like makeup mirrors that have a rotating feature with a regular mirror on one side and then just one side that&#x27;s magnified, but since this just has the magnified side I kept having to switch between looking in it and my bathroom mirror. It&#x27;s not that big of a deal, just a personal preference, and I&#x27;m still more than satisfied with this product! I received this item at a discount in exchange for my honest review.</li>
    <li> Received as a gift and returned it  There is ONLY the 7x magnified side of the mirror and you have to be VERY close to the mirror to see your face clearly.  The actual mirror part is also too small to see your entire face at the same time.</li>
    <li> What a great way to see ALL with a very close-up of your face. Expect to see all those little imperfections.  I am using it to put on my make-up to include eye make-up.  I really do like it but I would like to see the actual mirror a little bigger.  It uses batteries so you don&#x27;t need electricity, no wires across your counter or make-up vanity.  I do like the storage area below the mirror. Holds lipstick and some eye make-up easily. The only reason I am giving it a 4 is a little smaller on the mirror size than I wanted. You will love the light from the LED lights! This is not your average lighted make-up mirror.</li>
    <li> I love this! I love the acrylic on the bottle so I can put my makeup there.</li>
    <li> It does have good magnification and clarity and reasonable lighting, but the entire unit is quite cheaply produced and feels it. It is all very lightweight plastic. It does work, but I think it&#x27;s something that I would have preferred paying half as much for rather than what I paid.</li>
    <li> This is a nice product for the price. My only complaint is the light. I feel like it just washes out my face so it&#x27;s hard to see what I&#x27;m doing with my make up.. but works Ok for plucking eyebrows. Its a nice mirror until I decide to spend the money on a real expensive one.</li>
    <li> The light is awful, not even close to being bright enough for anything.  The design is nice having the makeup storage area on the base.  This was returned .</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product! It meets all my needs perfectly.  I like that I can keep all my accessories and make up brushes organized in one place and the mirror can be swiveled all the way around to get a perfect angle. it also helps that it can be taken off easily to keep be stored away safely when not in use. Its lightweight and a great size compared to some other magnified mirrors I&#x27;ve seen and used.</li>
    <li> I bought the make up mirror for my daughter for her dorm room. its perfect and she loves it.  The battery operated feature allows it to be mobile and not have to worry about electrical conversion.  Also given the small space available in her room, the attached make up caddy is ideal.</li>
    <li> this as a gift and i liked it it wasn&#x27;t bad but i don&#x27;t know if it was worth the price i love that it comes apart but i wish it was more heavy and had another side to the mirror</li>
    <li> The magnification is enough to tweeze bright eyebrows and cover flaws. I wish there was a light on the mirror.</li>
    <li> This is an amazing buy. It holds all my makeup and makeup brushes and even some of my nailpolish. I love how I can see closely enough to pluck all those little eyebrow hairs that are impossible to see. The led light really helps and you can adjust the mirror high low sideways however you want. The only complaint I have is that the 7x magnification can make you look like a fun house mirror if you aren&#x27;t close enough to the mirror. I wish it Had a normal mirror side. Totally worth the money! I would reccomend this to any girl!!!</li>
    <li> Fantastic little mirror - perfect magnification and the fact that its battery operated allows us to place it anywhere (and carry it around)</li>
    <li> I love my new mirror! My eyes just couldn&#x27;t see as well without it. If you want to see your face up close and in detail, this mirror is for you. The light is just bright enough to see well, without being too bright. I also love the compartments so I can keep beauty items and tools close. I would recommend this to friends and family.</li>
    <li> This is one of the best products I have received. Very well made, magnifies VERY closely, bright LED light and to top it off an amazing organizer!!</li>
    <li> The image on the picture makes you believe you can clearly see yourself in it. It took me more than a minute to be able to focus and the shape is not very helpful either. Will return.</li>
    <li> This was not what I expected and it was returned.</li>
    <li> I got this to try.  I love a great makeup mirror.  I was so excited when this one showed up.  The only mirror I have in our house is so high it shows me about half of my head.  Any woman knows you need a good mirror to do your makeup in.  This mirror had a crystal clear reflecting surface.  I could see everything in it.  The compartments on the bottom held everything I needed in one quick and easy place.  I also loved that I could pick it up and move it.  It went from my room to the bathroom with no problem at all.&lt;br /&gt;This is made of a very thick plastic so no need of worrying about dropping it and breaking it.  I loved this magnifying mirror if you have a special girl to buy for this holiday season I would completely recommend this mirror for them.  It also makes an awesome present for the college student in your life.  With the limited room they have in their dorm room this will be perfect to have everything all in one place and its portable.</li>
    <li> The light isn&#x27;t very bright.</li>
    <li> I won this mirror on this company&#x27;s face book page give away. I have to say I love the small footprint it has considering how much it can hold. It&#x27;s very nice crystal clear acrylic so it matches almost any decor. And the lighting is good, to often I have had a lighted mirror that has yellow lighting. Try doing your makeup in that lighting and you walk into daylight and look like a clown. The magnification is good, beware cuz you&#x27;ll see things on your face you never wanted to know were there lol.  I specifically love this for doing my eye brows, between the lighting it has and the magnification you can see EVERY hair you may want to get rid of. The only thing I would like to see is perhaps a regular mirror on the opposite side. But this isn&#x27;t necessary since you&#x27;ll most likely be using this near a regular mirror anyhow. My eyes have been coming out great since I got this mirror because I can see so closely when doing my eye makeup. I even got some compliments  from my friends since I&#x27;ve been doing my eye makeup in this mirror. So I&#x27;m really happy, and anything that has a organizer in it is a plus.</li>
    <li> My granddaughter loves the makeup mirror and the compartment to put her makeup in.  Thank you.  June</li>
    <li> Even nicer than expected...  Fits right in with my other things on my vanity</li>
    <li> Gift for my wife.  She is very happy with it.</li>
    <li> i love this morrow with the stabrushes and other itemsnd ,  ths stand is very handy to put your make</li>
    <li> Great for putting on eyeliner without having to climb across my vanity.  Love the storage.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my teenage daughter for Christmas.  She keeps it in her bedroom and loves it!  I personally wish that besides the magnified side of the mirror, that it had a flip side with a non-magnified mirror, but it doesn&#x27;t seem to bother her.  Overall, I&#x27;m pleased with my purchase.</li>
    <li> Returned this item it was much smaller than it appeared</li>
    <li> Big enough for all your basic&#x27;s! Mirror is removable like a hand held mirror!</li>
    <li> Wish there were 2 mirrors, one without magnification. But the light is very bright and white which is great and hard to find. Battery operated and comes apart for easy traveling.</li>
    <li> I really like this mirror.  The makeup storage tray comes in very handy.  It holds everything I use, and I use quite a bit of makeup.  I like that I can remove the mirror and go to another room if I need to.  The lights could stand to be a little brighter but all in all it is a big help when applying my makeup.  The magnification is very clear.  I gave it 4 stars mainly because I would like for the lights to be just a bit brighter.</li>
    <li> This makeup mirror and cosmetic organizer is fantastic.  It arrived with only two pieces to put together.  The plastic used to make the base and organizer is very sturdy.  The mirror was very helpful when applying makeup as the mirror magnifies as well as lights up.  There are nine different compartments to store makeup, jewelry, or other items.  What a great product!</li>
    <li> This is a great mirror and holds  my cosmetics that I use daily nice and neat.</li>
    <li> I love it.  The light works great and I can see everything up close on my face! The little organizer is a bonus for me. I can keep my go to make up in it.</li>

Full post at www.valmg.com/toilettree-makeup-mirror/.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been having a hard time finding a spot to do my makeup since moving into our new house. I know you are probably all thinking how silly, in the bathroom! Well, my bathroom has created some issues. Either I’m really short or the mirror is just way too high. I can barely reach the mirror! I usually have to sit on the counter and that just makes everything awkward. I have been using my hand held mirror, but since have been saved by the ToiletTtree mirror. I received the ToiletTree LED 7x magnified mirror with cosmetic organizer base. What a mouthful!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Assembly of the mirror is really easy. You just have to snap the led mirror into the cosmetic base. The led mirror requires 3 AAA batteries. It is made of a clear plastic which will make for easy cleaning. I have a ton of makeup, but just put some of my daily must have beauty products in the base. The mirror is adjustable so you can angle it however works for you. Seeing myself THAT up close and personal had me worried! You can literally see every pore and missed hair! I pluck my own eyebrows and thought I was doing a decent job. After taking a look in the mirror I realized how much I had actually missed! Those super light, super fine, teeny-tiny hairs. Yuck! Putting on my makeup was great. I had use of both my hands, which made applying my eye liner so much easier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ToiletTree LED 7x magnified mirror is well priced at $39.95.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t have the greatest lighting in my room, so the light on this mirror helps A LOT! It&#x27;s so durable and easy to adjust but the best part about this mirror is the organizer base.  It&#x27;s perfect for all of my everyday cosmetics that I need to get to right away.  The mirror looks great on my vanity and doesn&#x27;t take up too much room. It&#x27;s perfect for plucking, detailed eyeliner, and contouring your face!  I am so glad this mirror exists, especially with the light!  This is a must have for anyone that likes convenience in their beauty routine!</li>
    <li> Storage was great. The lighting was dull.</li>
    <li> My daughter loves it!</li>
    <li> As an avid blogger, I had a chance to review this great mirror.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been a responsible person and changed all of the light bulbs in my house to eco-friendly bulbs. They work well for the most part, but I can get frustrated when I am trying to tweeze or apply makeup. The LED ring does an amazing job of illuminating your face so you can clearly see your skin. The magnification works great (although I must admit that it was a shock to see my pores up so close!).  Between the light and the magnification, you won&#x27;t miss a single hair when you are grooming. The swivel feature on the mirror makes it really easy to adjust.  Having the organizer on the bottom is a nice bonus as well. I have far too much makeup to all fit; however, it still holds a decent amount of products and can at least be used to hold the items I use on a daily basis.  The plastic is very thick and it is quite sturdy. Overall, I am quite pleased with this mirror and it would certainly make a nice gift for the holidays!</li>
    <li> I wish the mirror also had a side that was normal but I still like it, it stays in place and it&#x27;s very functional.</li>
    <li> The 7x is still not strong enough. Like being able to use compartments but need more than 7x.</li>
    <li> My dressing table is filled with cosmetic organizers and I always keep adding to it. This particular one though I bought for my mom because it has a zoomed in mirror on top which is zoomed in. The led light can be moved around and is very easy to light up using the button on front. It fits well in the organizer and I do not fear it coming off of breaking. I put it on my moms dresser and filled it with the main products she use. She loves that she has everything in one place now. I received this product at a discount but all views presented here are my own.</li>
    <li> The lighting on this mirror is so dim you can&#x27;t see a thing!  I returned it.</li>
    <li> A perfect lighted mirror for the bathroom vanity.  Now my husband can get the eyelash or particle out of his eye on his own. HE LOVES IT, and so do I. I use it for makeup and plucking eyebrows.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for asking me for my review.</li>
    <li> This LED lighted mirror from Toilettree is a space saver and an organizer for me. The magnification is great when applying makeup as I dont need to put on and take off my glasses, or use a handheld mirror. But not only for applying makeup, twezzing brows but for curling my hair.  It is sturdy has plenty of room for storage for makeup, brushes , jewelry and hair accessories. It is great, as I can get up close to apply makeup to look my best. It stands 12 to 16 inches tall depending on the position of the mirror and you wont miss anything with the light in the oval shaped and magnified mirror. I am really enjoying this addition to my desk! It would also make a great gift!</li>
    <li> This product has only 7x mirror when I look at my face I feel dizzy</li>
    <li> Bought this for my girlfriend. We are middle aged. I think the mirror is rather small but the storage area is very useful. We don&#x27;t live together so she needs a duplicate set of makeup items at my place. She says she loves the mirror. The magnification shows things you wish you didn&#x27;t have. The light works well and she says it&#x27;s perfect for applying makeup and is using it almost exclusively. So I give it 4 stars because she likes but I don&#x27;t use it! Too small for my liking,</li>
    <li> Was just like described in post..</li>
    <li> Almost perfect... I love how it has the little storage bin can hold my essential makeup and the mirror is perfect for tweezing eyebrows, which is what I mainly bought it for.&lt;br /&gt;The light is also wonderful... if your batteries are fresh. I can probably do my makeup about 5 times with this mirror before the lights become too dull to help. It drains batteries really fast!&lt;br /&gt;I like how lightweight and portable it is. My old model was a plug-in, and while not having to deal with the hassle of batteries was nice, I like being able to move my mirror around with ease and not worry about getting the cord caught on anything.</li>
    <li> This mirror provides all the light one could ever want. The magnification is great and I can see everything I need to when putting my make up on. I especially like the base as it holds my eye make up and it is convenient when I am applying in the morning. Everything in one spot and I can actually see what I am doing. PLUS PLUS</li>
    <li> Recently I was able to review the LED 7x Magnified Makeup Mirror with Cosmetic Organizer Base from ToiletTree Products. I apply makeup almost daily, so the makeup mirror is something I was definitely interested in.Made of crystal clear acrylic, this makeup mirror lights up and magnifies to show a very up close and personal view of your face. Literally, you can see every pore and every hair! It takes the guesswork out of makeup application. The base has several spots to hold makeup and applicators. The only assembly required upon receiving the mirror is attaching the mirror to the base by snapping it in place.The mirror itself requires 3 AAA batteries, which are not included. The mirror is adjustable and swivels, so you can have it at a desired height and position. The lighting isn’t harsh on the eyes. I would like to see the makeup mirror available in different colors but that’s a minute indisposition. I like being able to see how I’m applying my makeup more clearly and having my makeup tools at hand.</li>
    <li> This mirror is awesome! Bright, white light and great magnification. I have never seen a mirror with the base that holds make-up, but I love that feature! I keep the mirror under my sink, so I just take it out and all of my make-up is right there with it. I could not be more pleased and I have been looking for the right mirror for months. Excellent price too!</li>
    <li> Honestly did not think that I would love this mirror as much as I do, but it is an exceptional organizer.  I haven&#x27;t used the light yet because I have a lamp but I love all the bin, really cleaned up my desk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Easy connection, comes in 2 parts you you stick the mirrow into a slot on the base.  The mirror itself is connected to the neck with a ball joint that allows limited but 360 movement.  Magnification is excellent to for eyebrow cleaning, looking at your pores, and winged eye liner (everyday staples).  The foot print is approximately ~4x5&amp;#34; (estimation) but it cleared up up almost half my desk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;10/10 would purchase again.</li>
    <li> Unfortunately this did not work for me, it was a magnification mirror only. The base was awesome and the lighting was adequate, but would have liked it if the reverse side was a regular mirror as well.</li>
    <li> too small, i should have measured it -- pic was deceiving</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m really happy with the Led 7x magnifying mirror. I was able to see clearer while applying my mascara and eyeliner and even was able to get mascara on my lower lashes The Led light  made it easier to pluck my eyebrows. I love that you can swivel the mirror to different angles.The clear cosmetic organizer  looks great and holds many of my makeup products that I use daily. I would recommend this to my family and friends.</li>
    <li> I use this mirror while removing facial hair or applying makeup and I find it very useful and high quality.</li>
