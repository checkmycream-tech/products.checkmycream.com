      <li>CHEAP!</li>
      <li>Easy to use.</li>
      <li>Not a clean,  perfect application.</li>
      <li>It is another case of buy cheap, get cheap.  </li>
      <li>came early and having good results</li>

      <li>they are great for cleaning behind the stones in rings (if there is access from the back of the ring).</li>
      <li>I like these because they have firm bristles which allow for easy application, even on the stickiest lip gloss.</li>
      <li>I found the brushes to big for the application and they were not absorbent enough, using too much Latisse for the intended application.</li>
      <li>first the bristles are too soft so the color from the lipstick is so hard to transfer..</li>
      <li>I saw some loose hairs in the clear bag.</li>

    <li> I was truly disappointed when I opened this package. The website pictured a fullsize brush. This is a small, paint-by-number quality brush...CHEAP! With plastic bristles.</li>
    <li> I bought these for the Latrisse I have been using. They work wonders. When the bottle of Latrisse comes, they give you ONE (1) of these. With bacteria and things like that it&#x27;s not good to b using the eyelid brush.</li>
    <li> On initial use, bristles came off of the brush onto my lips.  Every one I have used does that.  I hate them and would never buy them again!  I&#x27;ve never before used disposable brushes, so I have no experience from which to compare.</li>
    <li> As a makeup artist, I go through dozens of these a week. I&#x27;ve reordered several times. Use once and toss (and NEVER double dip!)&lt;br /&gt;Almost need auto order for these. Best price I&#x27;ve seen anywhere</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve trashed them without using; poor construction.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a makeup artist and use these on my clients. They work great and none of the hairs fall out. fast shipping too!</li>
    <li> I used these for a sweetsixteen and they worked great with lipgloss and with matt lipsticks. I will order more packs next time</li>
    <li> These were a great price and I love ordering in bulk.  I like the brushes a lot.  Easy to use.</li>
    <li> I ordered these with high hopes and they really dissapointed me. I used them on the set of a music video shoot I was doing makeup for and they ALL shed! It was a nightmare trying to get the bristles not just off my products but off my models&#x27; lips. I will never repurchase these. I doubt I got a &amp;#34;bad batch&amp;#34; as they looked and felt pretty flimsy to begin with. The price point is actually not that cheap for the amount you are getting so for it to underperform as badly as it did is unforgivable.</li>
    <li> Great to have around for applying eyelash/eyebrow dye.  I also ended up using them to clean jewelry...they are great for cleaning behind the stones in rings (if there is access from the back of the ring).</li>
    <li> I am an AVon representative and I have found these lip brushes to be very helpful in my business.  They are sanitary and disposable.</li>
    <li> Shipping was fast ! Ordered on Monday and got it by Wednesday!! Yass!! I have a event on Saturday so I needed this quick!! I saw some loose hairs in the clear bag. But I also did a test by pulling the hairs. And it didn&#x27;t come out . So far great !</li>
    <li> Got these brushed because I needed tiny brushes to do delicate painting on polyresin.  These work great.  Love it when I get something that really does the job.</li>
    <li> Sorry to say it, but they shed. It is another case of buy cheap, get cheap.  And this item did not have reviews.</li>
    <li> Arrived on time and as described</li>
    <li> arrived on time and meets the needs of my lateese. would definitely re order. came early and having good results</li>
    <li> These lip brushes get the job done.  However, the pricing is too high for such a cheap and disposable product.</li>
    <li> Overall easy to use but the brush itself sheds.</li>
    <li> Bristles come off all over the place, especially with any cream makeup.  Good quantity for the price, though.</li>
    <li> Terrible product! All the bristles come out when you use them. I cannot put any lipstick/lipgloss on my clients with these. I was very embarrassed when I tried to use these on a new client!</li>
    <li> I bought the disposable lip brushes to be used for Latisse application. I found the brushes to big for the application and they were not absorbent enough, using too much Latisse for the intended application.</li>
    <li> They are very nice brushes that work great. I am very pleased with this product. I would buy this product again.</li>
    <li> The little synthetic  hairs  come out the brush onto the lip and lipstick.  I hate that.  Not a clean,  perfect application.</li>
    <li> Great for make-up gigs.</li>
    <li> i guess this is perfect for lipgloss but not for lipstick..&lt;br /&gt; first the bristles are too soft so the color from the lipstick is so hard to transfer.. you would have to keep reapplying for an entire lip coverage. i havent tried it on gloss but im sure this thing would be perfect..</li>
    <li> These brushes were great and affordable</li>
    <li> I like these because they have firm bristles which allow for easy application, even on the stickiest lip gloss. Good value too.</li>
