      <li>excellent on all of the CLEAR product.  </li>
      <li>Try this in your hair for a nice healthy shiny look.  </li>
      <li>oil is also great for braiding and for straightening with a hot iron.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m happy to report that this product seems to work pretty well.</li>
      <li>, my hair is very smooth</li>
      <li>Very light</li>
      <li>more effectively.&lt;br</li>
      <li>love that it doesnt have a smell</li>
      <li>and I love it.</li>
      <li>How many drops do I use?</li>
      <li>A lot of users have said that they weren&#x27;t sure how to use it; but the bottle has an applicator on the end and says its for scalps.</li>
      <li>It made my hair and scalp feel nourished and healthy whenever I used it.</li>
      <li>okay to use.</li>
      <li>I really like it because it works great for my 4a/b hair texture.</li>
      <li>I love the aroma.  </li>
      <li>I love the argon oil treatment my stylist gives me, so</li>
      <li>Instead of imparting a healthy shine, this product made my hair look greasy and</li>
      <li>Which is why I am so glad I found this line of haircare</li>
      <li>After I&#x27;ve used it, I have to wash my hair 2-3 times before it looks okay again.  </li>
      <li>have tried many products to manage the frizzy curly and stubborn hair.</li>
      <li>If you have thicker hair, you might find yourself needing to use more to see any benefit.</li>
      <li>This is the best oil I ever used for my hair-I used to purchase it at Walmart and Target  for a much lesser price</li>
      <li>That made it a bit better, however my hair still looked greasy and heavy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>like &amp;#34;ends&amp;#34; of your lovely locks.</li>
      <li>The crowning moment was when I did a top bun on my hair with the product in.</li>
      <li>I sometimes i use both the butter to my top portion of my hair and scalp.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve had much better results with the products in the Macadamia Oil line</li>
      <li>This stuff is much better than I</li>
      <li>Ok so I was very excited to try this product out.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m confident in giving it a full five star rating, deservingly so.</li>
      <li>My hair is more easily managed.</li>
      <li>Great before bed or after styling for a natural HEALTHY look.</li>
      <li>It helps to maintain the moisture in her hair which easily dries out.  </li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t leave residue on clothes or hands, smells fresh, best if used on ends but not too much on short bangs.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It rinses away easily with any shampoo.</li>
      <li>It will leave your hair and scalp with a nice shine (as all oils do) and also leave decent aroma that will not bother most people.  </li>
      <li>The primary ingredient as others have mentioned is indeed mineral oil</li>
      <li>I have to say this oil really smells nice.  </li>
      <li>It smells so nice and is reasonably priced</li>
      <li>Cheap oil in cheap packaging with no discernible usefulness at all.  </li>
      <li>She said even applying the product was smooth and relaxing.</li>
      <li>For what it is and if you don&#x27;t have overly damaged hair and just want some extra moisture or replenish the oils washed out from shampooing, this is great.  </li>
      <li>Perhaps better instructions and a product guide would be useful.</li>
      <li>I think the pink stuff I bought for her works best at keeping moisture in her hair and keeping her curls pretty and touchable.</li>
      <li>Familiar with this product.</li>
      <li>[[ASIN:B001ET7MAW Brylcreem Hair Groom, Original, 5.5 fl oz (162 ml)</li>
      <li>Ultra Shea butter, plus the shampoo and conditioner moisturizes my hair and scalp taming and calming the frizz, fly aways and dry brittle split ends.</li>
      <li>It made my hair more greasy than soft, moisturized, and healthy.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;d say &#x60;read the label&#x27; before purchasing, and then again the label makes no mention of the products true intentions.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;The only good side that we found was using it on \\&quot;split</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t just pop in and have the color touched because of the thickness and full body hair.</li>
      <li>The itchiness has been reduced, I like the look of my hair, and this treatment is easy to use and reliably consistent.</li>
      <li>I had used other products in this line and they worked great.</li>
      <li>Fortunately it did wash out with the first try, and it had a very nice, shea-butter scent, but that&#x27;s the only positive.  </li>
      <li>I probably won&#x27;t buy this product again because it is so oily, but it was a good quick fix for my dry scalp.</li>
      <li>I was almost sure that any kind of hair or scalp oil would only rate two or three stars at the most, as this is 2012 and oily hair is for Lenny and Squiggy and Elvis impersonators, but this is a solid product.</li>
      <li>It works as you might expect at laying your hair down like any oil would but it has a very nice aroma.  </li>
      <li>This stuff really works great for dry scalp.  </li>
      <li>I have straight, light brown hair</li>
      <li>so naturally I thought I would love the \\&quot;nourishing scalp &amp; hair oil\\&quot; too.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s easy to brush my hair or even run my fingers through it, my hair dries soft, manageable and with a clean shine to it.&lt;br</li>
      <li>so far- better than Pantene.</li>
      <li>You&#x27;re better off just using vegetable oil for all the good it does, seriously.  </li>
      <li>As others have noted, perhaps it&#x27;s for a different kind of hair, but it&#x27;s super greasy and doesn&#x27;t really do much to help nourish.</li>
      <li>There is absolutely nothing special about this product, which leads me to wonder why anyone would gravitate towards it.  </li>
      <li>The clear scalp hair and beauty oil is a decent hair oil that many will appreciate for its light weight and decent fragrance.  </li>
      <li>This product deserves a second look by me because it could be worth more than 3 stars.  </li>
      <li>(I should note here that I have fairly fine, smooth long hair).  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s possible this might work better on another hair type, but for mine it just didn&#x27;t do the trick.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> love this stuff for my beard and has  nice smell. delivery was fast</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t have any instructions on the bottle. I&#x27;m not sure if I should use it in the shower, after or what?</li>
    <li> I have naturally curly, fine, dry hair.  I use this product on the ends only of my medium length hair.  This product is amazing!! If old school VO5 works for you then this is a perfect substitute without that disgusting smell!!.  It is much too heavy and oily for most hair types, but if you are a curly girl I can&#x27;t recommend this enough for the straw like &amp;#34;ends&amp;#34; of your lovely locks.</li>
    <li> I read about this product in a Black magazine. I like it but it is a bit oily for my tastes. I have learned how to use it so it helps my hair. I have to add that I have always had thin but long hair which is easily gummed up so I have to be careful. I still buy it but have learned exactly how much to use.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a bit thick and sticky, not non-sticky as mentioned. I was looking to get non-sticky/ greasy one, but okay to use.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always thought it was kind of strange when people complained about certain products not having instructions on them. I once reviewed a salad spinner, and several of the other reviewers complained about no instructions in the box and not being able to get the salad spinner to work. I thought to myself \\&quot;What&#x27;s next? Do we need instructions to use mixing bowls and water pitchers as well?\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even with the shampoo and conditioner from this product line, I didn&#x27;t understand the complaints of no instructions. The use of shampoo and conditioner is pretty much standard fare; if they don&#x27;t have instructions assume a nickel sized amount and use daily or as needed. With this product however, instructions would&#x27;ve been nice. Something simple, indicating the amount of product to use and how often to use the product; I don&#x27;t think that would be too much to ask.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the product itself, I personally have not had much luck in finding the exact amount that I need. If I use too little, I don&#x27;t notice any difference in my hair. If I use too much, my hair does have a shine, but it&#x27;s not a \\&quot;clean\\&quot; shine, it looks like a dirty, oily hair shine. Overall, I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll finish the tube, and I certainly won&#x27;t purchase another.</li>
    <li> This product does make my hair feel less dry and there were no flakes, however, it made my hair greasy and heavy (no fluff it just laid there), I did not use that much, but it just made everything feel greasy and gave my hair a wet (out of the shower look all day).  I stopped using it since it makes my hair greasy feeling and whenever I would touch my hair it made my hands feel wet and was very difficult to get off of my hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the end this did make my hair less dry, but gave it a a greasy feeling that I cannot stand, so I had to stop using it, my hair looks terrible when greasy and feels heavy and wet.  I was not happy with this and it was difficult to get out during the next shower (plus if you touch your hair and get it on your hands you have to scrub like crazy to get it off.</li>
    <li> For some reason, whenever I end up putting oil on my head, I think of [[ASIN:B0019GE8ZC Vitalis Hair Tonic For Men, 7 Ounce]] and [[ASIN:B001ET7MAW Brylcreem Hair Groom, Original, 5.5 fl oz (162 ml) (Pack of 3)]]: grease everything down so not a hair on your head moves and you look like everybody else: neat but wet. Which is not to suggest that using this scalp treatment by Clear Scalp made me look or feel like a greaser or anything. In fact, the oil in this product feels pretty much like any other oil when I put it on my fingers, but when I rubbed it into my scalp, it dissipated quite aggressively. I even had to add a few drops more to cover my entire head after the first application got soaked into my skin and hair so easily. Clear Scalp didn&#x27;t make my hair sticky and it didn&#x27;t give it a very \\&quot;wet\\&quot; look. It just looks like I might have put some mousse or gel there and tousled my hair a bit. In other words, it seems greasy, but isn&#x27;t. I have to say, too, that I&#x27;d actually been having a bit of dry scalp itchiness when I finally got around to trying this product, and it seems to have helped a lot. The itchiness has been reduced, I like the look of my hair, and this treatment is easy to use and reliably consistent. I was almost sure that any kind of hair or scalp oil would only rate two or three stars at the most, as this is 2012 and oily hair is for Lenny and Squiggy and Elvis impersonators, but this is a solid product. I&#x27;m confident in giving it a full five star rating, deservingly so.</li>
    <li> I am not sure what type of hair this product is designed for, by reading some of the previous reviews I believe it is for ethnic hair, which I do not have. I have really dry skin and scalp during the winter so I purchased this item not knowing exactly how to use it (there are no instructions). I used it last night on dry hair just at the root. My hair was VERY oily and felt disgusting when I went to bed (my pillow is all oily now too). I woke up this morning and washed out the product and low and behold my scalp is no longer dry and itchy, my hair is very smooth (I had to wash my hair about three times to get the product out). I probably won&#x27;t buy this product again because it is so oily, but it was a good quick fix for my dry scalp.</li>
    <li> Familiar with this product. I really like it because it works great for my 4a/b hair texture. It leaves my hair soft and silky without the greasy feeling. Very light so it does not weight my hair down. Works well with the shampoo and conditioner. Leaves my hair bouncy.</li>
    <li> Unlike other concentration hair treatment products, this does not distribute very easily, especially with long hair. I found that I was using so much of it to get to my scalp, it wasn&#x27;t worth it.</li>
    <li> This is the best oil I ever used for my hair-I used to purchase it at Walmart and Target  for a much lesser price but since they discontinued it I had to pay a higher price-one day I went into one of the Chinese beauty supply store and found it there along with the hair grease for $7.99 and the hair grease at $4.99 so I stocked up so that is where I will be buying my supplies.  Very good product-light weight and does the my hair well.  excellent on all of the CLEAR product.  TRUST ME IT IS GOOD  TRY IT.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CYNTHIA</li>
    <li> A small amount to the scalp and tips of the hair added lots of shine and moisture to my dry split ends. This stuff is much better than I expected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a disclaimer, my  hair routine isn&#x27;t the usual. I do the no-poo thing (instead of shampoo, it&#x27;s backing soda and purified water, and instead of conditioner, it&#x27;s gelatin, apple cider, essential oils, and honey. Normally, this means my hair is very healthy and shiny, but lately I&#x27;ve been too busy to do the conditioning and also have to use hair spray for my job as a professional dancer (keeps hair in place, obviously). Anyhow, that has been drying my hair out, so rather than getting my conditioner from the fridge (because it is perishable), I just put some of this in after doing the baking soda \\&quot;shampoo\\&quot;. Voila! Awesome, silky hair from scalp to waist. I highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> Greasy. Plain and simple. It does relieve itchy scalps but the negatives outweigh the positives.  You can see through your hair that your scalp is shiny and you hair looks like covered with Canola oil; uncomfortable feeling.  You always have the feeling to stay away from the couch speciall ours is microfiber.  Removing it is also a struggle as it sticks to your scalp and hair.</li>
    <li> I have VERY dry hair; I&#x27;ve been coloring it and/or otherwise fussing with it for literally 35 years.  I love the argon oil treatment my stylist gives me, so I thought that this product would be a nice at-home adjunct.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yuck.  There are no directions at all but the online description says that this product can be used on dry or wet hair.  I&#x27;ve tried it on both, and either way, even with the lightest touch, it weighs my hair down and makes it hang in oily strings.  After I&#x27;ve used it, I have to wash my hair 2-3 times before it looks okay again.  I&#x27;ve tried it 4 times (two times on dry hair and two times on wet hair) and now I&#x27;m tossing it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BOTTOM LINE: Cheap oil in cheap packaging with no discernible usefulness at all.  Blech.</li>
    <li> This stuff is disgusting. As others have noted, perhaps it&#x27;s for a different kind of hair, but it&#x27;s super greasy and doesn&#x27;t really do much to help nourish. Not recommended unless you have the proper hair type, though I don&#x27;t know what that is...just that mine is not it.</li>
    <li> I tried the Scal and hair therapy ultra shea balm. WORST PRODUCT EVER. I thought it would hydrate and repair my hair, but it is just grease. Also, there are no instructions to follow in the product in order to know how to apply it. I am Totally disappointed, and one star is a lot for this product. Do not buy it.</li>
    <li> I chose to try out this Clear Scalp &amp; Hair scalp &amp; hair oil to see if it would help with my flaky, dry scalp. I&#x27;ve always had dandruff and flaking issues, and have used other oils and creams in combination with dandruff shampoos in the past, with mixed results. I&#x27;m happy to report that this product seems to work pretty well. I use a decent sized amount (about the size of two quarters in your hand) and scrub it into my hair and scalp about 5 minutes before showering. I find that it really helps to loosen everything up to help the shampoo work more effectively.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is probably a product that&#x27;s going to vary in effectiveness between different people and hair types. If you have thicker hair, you might find yourself needing to use more to see any benefit. Most people probably use this as a leave-in solution without washing it out right away - I personally can&#x27;t see myself doing that because it is very greasy, and I don&#x27;t use leave in oils or gels. Again, there are different uses and effectiveness for different people. At the low price, you can&#x27;t really go wrong giving it a try. I&#x27;d recommend using a lesser amount first just to make sure your head isn&#x27;t overly oily, and adjust as needed.</li>
    <li> I thought this product would give my hair shine, but it made it look dirty and greasy.  I have straight, light brown hair and this definitely is not the product for my hair type.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PS - It always makes my day to know that people find these reviews helpful. If you&#x27;d also like to ask a question or leave a comment I usually respond the same day, so if you have a question or comment (even if it&#x27;s just to say, Hi!\\&quot;) feel free to post it below.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks,&lt;br /&gt;Claire</li>
    <li> I have been using this on my hair, which lately has been dry, and brittle.  I dispense a small amount on my hands, then stroke it through the hair.  And, it gives the hair a nice healthy shine.  There is an amount of oil to it, but that&#x27;s what it is .... oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, the oil does not get all over the clothes.  Try this in your hair for a nice healthy shiny look.  Just use a dab and the 3 ounces goes a long way.  ...Rizzo</li>
    <li> My step daughter is bi racial and these product ended up going into her bin of products.  It helps to maintain the moisture in her hair which easily dries out.  When I used this on my fine hair it just made it greasy and heavy.  I didn&#x27;t see any Shea in the product ingredients.  I think the pink stuff I bought for her works best at keeping moisture in her hair and keeping her curls pretty and touchable.</li>
    <li> I had hoped that this oil would help with my dry ends.  When it arrived, there were no directions whatsoever on the bottle, which was made of fairly flimsy plastic.  I was unable to find directions in Amazon&#x27;s product description either.  So before even opening the package, it&#x27;s not very consumer-friendly.  Reading other reviews, I was able to glean that a little goes a long way, so I used about 3 drops put in the palm of one hand, rubbed my hands together, and then ran my hands over my hair concentrating on the ends.  (I should note here that I have fairly fine, smooth long hair).  Almost instantly, my hair was weighed down and greasy as though it hadn&#x27;t been washed in a week.  With 3 drops!  Fortunately it did wash out with the first try, and it had a very nice, shea-butter scent, but that&#x27;s the only positive.  I&#x27;ll be tossing this and would certainly not recommend it.</li>
    <li> I have to say this oil really smells nice.  It works as you might expect at laying your hair down like any oil would but it has a very nice aroma.  To be honest, I really don&#x27;t know how to rate an hair oil other that by it&#x27;s odor as I&#x27;d assume they all pretty much act in the same way.  This oil smells very nice and I did not notice any degradation of the aroma over time.  I&#x27;d have to recommend this oil as a nice product to use in your hair for control and aroma.</li>
    <li> I use the Clear Scalp therapy in combination with the Clear Scalp shampoo and it has fixed my dry scalp and dandruff problem. I use the Scalp therapy on my hair right before I dry it. It not only has helped my dry scalp, but it also adds volume to my hair. The Clear Scalp is a wonderful set of products</li>
    <li> I am a soapmaker by trade and I know oil chemistry well.  Some oils we use to attract moisture to the skin, some are to create foam, some to put a protective layer on the skin to hold moisture in.  Mineral oil, besides aging your skin only sits there. It brings nothing to skin or hair.  Just creates a mess really. And this is what baby oil is.  Mineral oil can &#x60;water proof&#x27; skin keeping moisture from getting in (reason for baby oil??) and preventing loosing oil perhaps. Overall, don&#x27;t ever use mineral oil!!&lt;br /&gt;Best for your hair and skin.... Coconut oil. [[ASIN:B003B3OOPA Nature&#x27;s Way Organic Extra Virgin Coconut Oil, 16 Ounce]]  AMAZING results for your hair.  You only need the tiniest amount and it deeply conditions your hair. I a tiny amount, rub my hands together with the oil to thin it out more and rub though my hair cream to style my hair.  As for skin, it tightens skin! You WILL look younger! I buy the 54 oz because it is also the very best to cook with. Over all you save a lot of money for all it can do.&lt;br /&gt;As for Clear scalp oil... leave it alone.</li>
    <li> Works perfectly for me!!!!! I&#x27;m bi-racial and get relaxers every 2.5 - 3 months. It&#x27;s really hard for me to find products that work to keep my hair and scalp moisturized without being too heavy and greasy. I really hate that this product has had so many poor reviews by people who don&#x27;t realize who it&#x27;s made for.  I first found this in the &#x27;ethnic&#x27; section by itself and then later in the regular section, but it was right next to other Clear products for RELAXED hair.  A lot of users have said that they weren&#x27;t sure how to use it; but the bottle has an applicator on the end and says its for scalps. So you probably shouldn&#x27;t try it if you don&#x27;t usually apply thick oils directly to your scalp. And on the back of my bottle it says for relaxed hair. I think the entire line of Clear products for Relaxed and Natural hair is great and one of the only affordable not too white, not too black products I&#x27;ve been able to find!</li>
    <li> This product comes wrapped in plastic wrap but no instructions. It has a pleasant scent, but it is really just oil, and if you want to revitalize your scalp, oil can irritate, especially if it has a scent or other additives.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It took a while to review, because this product comes with no directions. Do I wash my hair, add it to my scalp, and if so, how much? How many drops do I use? In absence of instructions, I washed my hair as usual (I have semi-dry color-treated hair), and after the shampoo cycle added some to my scalp. Instantly, I could feel the moist oily feel this product left on my scalp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, I proceeded, added conditioner and dried (I air-dry since my scalp is sensitive).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Almost immediately, I noticed a problem. My hands came away oily from my scalp, Not good, and NOT attractive.  Also, my scalp felt irritated by the oils and perfume. Not good. I went home and rinsed my hair out completely but unfortunately, the greasy oil remained, and I could feel the prickling of scalp irritation. Whatever ingredients are in this product, my scalp did not feel revitalized or moisturized and my hair looks greasy like I haven&#x27;t washed it in days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m disappointed. Perhaps better instructions and a product guide would be useful. I can&#x27;t say however, that my scalp is anything but irritated and not attractive after using this.</li>
    <li> There is absolutely nothing special about this product, which leads me to wonder why anyone would gravitate towards it.  I thought that maybe it would help out with my wife&#x27;s dry scalp.  Sadly, this is yet another product that utilizes false advertising to rope in unsuspecting consumers.  This isn&#x27;t marketed as hair care for ethnic women, and yet that&#x27;s really what it is.  It is really just scented mineral oil.  This was not intended for thinner hair and so my wife was not in for a good experience.  I&#x27;d say &#x60;read the label&#x27; before purchasing, and then again the label makes no mention of the products true intentions.  This product gave my wife greasy hair and made her feel dirty to the point where she raced to get it washed out of her hair, which took a while.</li>
    <li> The clear scalp hair and beauty oil is a decent hair oil that many will appreciate for its light weight and decent fragrance.  It is not thick like coconut oil tends to be and it also does not have the strong unpleasant smell of coconut oil.  The primary ingredient as others have mentioned is indeed mineral oil so you would expect it to be a lighter weight than coconut oil.  It will leave your hair and scalp with a nice shine (as all oils do) and also leave decent aroma that will not bother most people.  For those seeking a true scalp therapy you will probably still need to turn to a heavier weight oil but for general everyday hair needs this one is  just a bit better than baby oil (though at a much higher price).</li>
    <li> I have fine, straight hair and the Therapy made my hair really heavy.  My daughter has thick, wavy hair and it worked well on her hair to keep it less fuzzy while remaining shiny.  Probably wouldn&#x27;t buy it again because it didn&#x27;t make enough of a difference.  It did have a great smell though.</li>
    <li> The Clear Scalp &amp; Hair Beauty Therapy Ultra Shea Nourishing Scalp &amp; Hair Oil was somewhat of a disappointment to me. I had used other products in this line and they worked great. This is much too greasy. At time my hair gets extremely dry, but this was still too greasy.</li>
    <li> I really like the way this greases up my hair and makes it soft and shiny. It seems to be discontinued, though.</li>
    <li> I love everything about this product! I used a bit on ends of hair before flat ironing. I have to straighten my hair in order to curl the ends with the same flat iron. Then I use a little more on the ends once I&#x27;m finished. Needless to say I NEED THE NOURISHMENT. Even the smallest amount goes a long way. This product makes my hair feel 10yrs younger or as it was before I colored/chemically treated and flat ironed my hair. My BF has a bad habit of putting his fingers through my hair while we watch tv or sleep! So, yes! He would pull my hair ALL the time and I had to inflict pain on him to ensure he learned he was hurting me. Now he&#x27;s more careful and when he accidentally pulls too hard now, but its doesn&#x27;t matter because this product makes your hair smooth as butter. Oil really absorbs in fast on thirsty hair like mine. Doesn&#x27;t leave residue on clothes or hands, smells fresh, best if used on ends but not too much on short bangs. Best if poured in hands, rubbed together then press hand together with ends in between. Great before bed or after styling for a natural HEALTHY look.</li>
    <li> Let me start by saying that, unlike many other reviewers, I have absolutely no idea what kind of oil is good or bad for hair.  I have, however, always used and liked coconut oil products and, when I saw that listed as one of the ingredients (along with shea butter), I thought I would give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was also interested in this product more for my dry ends rather than for my scalp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, I&#x27;ve read many of the other reviews where they refer to this as an \\&quot;ethnic\\&quot; hair product.  I read the product description and all the information on the product itself, and don&#x27;t see that anywhere.  But, since it seems to be an issue, I am mixed race with very long, fine, wavy hair.  I use no \\&quot;ethnic\\&quot; hair products and never have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On to the product:&lt;br /&gt;I decided to use a very small drop of the product strictly on the ends of my hair.  The drop was smaller than a dime.  I rubbed it onto my hands and then into my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell was not unpleasant and didn&#x27;t linger very long in my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The oil was very greasy.  It coated my hands unpleasantly and left an unpleasant sheen in my hair.  I didn&#x27;t like the way that it looked so, although the instructions didn&#x27;t say to do so, I brushed it in.  That made it a bit better, however my hair still looked greasy and heavy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The plain fact is that, like anyone else, I like my hair to look clean. Instead of imparting a healthy shine, this product made my hair look greasy and unwashed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Simply put, I will not be using it again.</li>
    <li> As with any oil in general, you are going to want to use this very sparingly. The lack of instructions is a fail on behalf of CLEAR SCALP, but since I normally use hair oils, pomades, shine treatments, etc, I pretty much knew what to expect and how to use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have really drry scap issues, put a drop on your pointer finger and rub it in a little against your other pointer finger, then apply it to the areas where you need it and rub it in. You shouldn&#x27;t have a thick layer applied or a puddle. It should only feel very slightly slick. If you use too much, you will have an awful mess. Do not just squeeze the bottle onto your head! lol You will regret it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can also use it to help tame frizz, give some added shine, and hydrate/seal really dry/split ends. Again you only need a few drops though. Put a drop or two in the palm of your hand, rub your hands together and then sort of grab just above the ends of your hair, and slide your hand down to the end. To tame frizz add a drop or two to the palm of your hand, rub hands together and sort of run your hands over your hair and then finger comb through it. Same technique of you just want some shine or sleekness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This 3 ounce bottle would last months and months. Again the main thing to remember is literally a drop or two at a time or you will end up with a major case of the greasies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It rinses away easily with any shampoo. You may want to massage the scalp a bit more to really get the shampoo on to it and to exfoliate the dry skin you were treating. I typically kinda scratch at the scalp when I am shampooing as I am lathering. I have had no issues with this oil being hard to remove and I haven&#x27;t had any buildup on my hair or scalp. I am caucasian with long wavy/curly hair which can tend to be on the dry side depending on which styling products I use and how often I use heat tools.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The oil is also great for braiding and for straightening with a hot iron.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While I like the results while the product is in/on my hair, the benefits are gone once it is shampooed out. It doesn&#x27;t seem to have any major permanent reparative qualities, but that is expected from a low priced brand like this.hile I like the results while the product is in/on my hair, the benefits are gone once it is shampooed out. It doesn&#x27;t seem to have any major permanent reparative qualities, but that is expected from a low priced brand like this.</li>
    <li> Ok so I was very excited to try this product out. I have been using the shampoo and conditioner from Clear and am obsessed with them so naturally I thought I would love the \\&quot;nourishing scalp &amp; hair oil\\&quot; too. Negative.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not only does it have a very distant smell which can be pretty overwhelming, but it&#x27;s greasy! I use many hair oils and believe it or not most of them aren&#x27;t greasy. I was really disappointed. The crowning moment was when I did a top bun on my hair with the product in. I did my bun, ran out the house, started driving to work which is only 10 minutes away and the minute I placed my car into park the bun slid off of my hair. I had all my hair loose. Never again, save yourselves the money.</li>
    <li> My wife&#x27;s hair tends to dry out more in the summer months than any other. She says it is because of the heat. So she wanted to try this product and was very happy with the results. She said even applying the product was smooth and relaxing. All I know is that her hair looks and feels great...guess I won&#x27;t mind performing that requested head massage after all !</li>
    <li> I have wavy hair that tends to feel a bit damaged and dry since I have highlights put in about every 3 months.  I currently use and really like [[ASIN:B002WTC37U Macadamia Oil Healing Oil Treatment, 4.2 ounces Glass Bottle]] so I was hoping this might serve as a cost-effective alternative.  Unfortunately, this really isn&#x27;t a substitute for that product.  It made my hair more greasy than soft, moisturized, and healthy.  And I also didn&#x27;t seem to notice a difference in scalp health vs. using a shampoo and conditioner designed for scalp health.  I&#x27;ve tried a few of the products in the CLEAR line now including a couple of shampoos and conditioners, and I just don&#x27;t think they are for me.  I&#x27;ve had much better results with the products in the Macadamia Oil line (Yes, more expensive but they work as stated) as well as with shampoo and conditioner from Head &amp; Shoulders.  It&#x27;s possible this might work better on another hair type, but for mine it just didn&#x27;t do the trick.</li>
    <li> Women of Color thoughout Africa &#x27;Middle East&#x27; included. Have used these butters and oils for centuries for skin hair etcetera. Clear Ultra Shea is for Black/ Hispanic/Middle Eastern Women and Men. I do not suggest it for caucasian skin or hair. My hair loves this product, all 4 of them. I have referred them to my friends. Most Sisters use products made by Black hair companies. I usually do as well, but decided to give it a try and I love it. There are differences our hair care and skin care products. We use Coco and Shea Butter on our skin from an early age. We get all natural Shea butter found Black communities. Maybe this is why a 60 year old sister wont have wrinkles. If you are not a Woman of Color try the other versions of Clear, they are good too, but this product hits the spot!!!&lt;br /&gt;Love this product!</li>
    <li> Another great product from this line. My stylist used this as a lubricant just before she blew my hair out. My hair was soft and shiny, and not wieghed down. I did notice that she used a small amount, and then she rubbed it in well. I will continue to use this.</li>
    <li> My husband uses this on his scalp almost daily now for several weeks but we haven&#x27;t seen any lasting effects. He has dry, brittle very curly hair. Hoping that massaging it into his scalp would be the answer to stronger hair, we got this product. Nothing has changed even though we follow instructions. The biggest benefit he gets from this product is a temporary smoothness if he applies it to the dryer ends of his hair. Applying at the scalp, massaging it in and combing it through has done nothing. We give it 3 stars, a neutral rating, because someone may benefit from it. We didn&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> This stuff really works great for dry scalp.  Unless you&#x27;re totally balk, the oil also coats your hair, which makes it look shy like is got a shiny gel  product it it or your rogaine hasn&#x27;t dried. You don&#x27;t feel it coming out, but it is, and you don&#x27;t want to use a lot.  It will take 3-4 washings to get itt out.</li>
    <li> To begin, there&#x27;s one thing the company could have done to improve this product:  instructions.  Because right now I&#x27;m giving them the benefit of the doubt that I simply have not discovered the right way to use this stuff.  Because I have been using it just like I would use any other similar product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only benefit: I have felt some improvement in my scalp&#x27;s condition.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise, this is messy, greasy, and even a conservative amount leaves my roots oily and my hair heavy, lifeless, and with a strange texture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So this works well for the scalp, but for the hair itself?  Terrible.</li>
    <li> This Nourishing Scalp and Hair Oil smells so delicious that I was thinking about eating some. But then I read the ingredients, and it contains things I&#x27;ve never heard of like Hydrogenated styrene, Tocopheryl Acetate, and Helianthus Annuus. So, I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll actually be tasting this anytime soon. But if someone forced me to consume one of the products in my bathroom, like if I had cursed too much, and needed my mouth cleansing, I&#x27;d definitely choose this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In addition to smelling wonderful (it has a herbal honey kind of smell), you&#x27;re probably wondering if it works. Yes, it works great. It made my hair and scalp feel nourished and healthy whenever I used it. It made the itchy parts of my hair not itchy anymore, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only downsides I could see to this product is that it is a little sticky, and it&#x27;s easy to overdo it (especially with how good it smells). Even though the cap just lets out a little stream of this wondrous goo, it&#x27;s very easy to get way too much in one part of your hair. And then it&#x27;s hard to get it all out, since it&#x27;s so sticky. But, be careful, start out with small amounts, and you&#x27;ll be fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;+Smells delicious&lt;br /&gt;+Keeps your hair nourished and healthy&lt;br /&gt;+Prevents itchiness&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;-A little sticky</li>
    <li> I have super thick, naturally wavy hair that I dye a lot.  It frizzes a lot.  The problem I have with products is always finding that balance between getting the frizz to go away or when it does my hair looks to greasy, blech.  I usually end up just not using much or flat ironing and using higher end product.  Anyways, tried this, it is the greasiest stuff I have ever used, and that&#x27;s with using a dime-sized amount away from my scalp of course, and again my hair is super thick, I usually get it thinned 1-2 times a year.  Then the smell, blech, not for me.  I just rewashed my hair and went back to my regular $10 a bottle stuff, sigh.  Oh well, tossing this!  Not for me or my hair.  Nothing ever seems to work right on my hair, even the expensive stuff, but at least that helps \\&quot;some\\&quot; and tones it down a little, lol.  I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this.  You&#x27;re better off just using vegetable oil for all the good it does, seriously.  Not that you&#x27;d want to do that!</li>
    <li> This \\&quot;Scalp &amp; Hair Oil\\&quot; was a huge disappointment for my daughter and son, both having long dry hair that would normally benefit from a \\&quot;nourishing\\&quot; product. Sadly, the large amount of mineral oil in it just lays in the hair and makes it look flat and unwashed. There may be benefits from using the other oils, like the shea and argan, but they are out weighed by the negatives of the mineral oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only good side that we found was using it on \\&quot;split ends\\&quot; as it does seem helpful in reducing the fuzzy appearance, but it needs to be applied carefully and the excess removed quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We will not be using this in the future.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CFH</li>
    <li> Product delivery in a tapered bottle is a plus, making for ease of application and steady storage base.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The overall product composition is good, but the base of mineral oil throws up an unknown, ie, we don&#x27;t know how much of what is in it.  So, it may be more or less effective for random individuals because of this.  For what it is and if you don&#x27;t have overly damaged hair and just want some extra moisture or replenish the oils washed out from shampooing, this is great.  Miracle product for other folks, not sure.</li>
    <li> This product deserves a second look by me because it could be worth more than 3 stars.  I ordered it because my hair was getting dry and unpleasant.  I started using this before a shampoo &amp; blowout  and think that it helped a bit.  I love the aroma.  Unfortunately I spilled the container and lost the opportunity to do enough treatments to see if it would be effective.  It smells so nice and is reasonably priced so I do recommend it.</li>
    <li> I have very thick, hard to manage hair that goes half way down my back. That being said it takes anywhere from an hour to an hour and a half to blow dry and straighten it, if left to air dry it can take up to a day and half to dry. My hair is very difficult to tame. Which is why I am so glad I found this line of haircare products.&lt;br /&gt;I have tried many products to manage the frizzy curly and stubborn hair. I used Biosilk for a long time, it worked at first however the alcohol in it actually caused damage only making the problem worse.&lt;br /&gt;Using the Clear Scalp and Hair therapy line with the Ultra Shea nourishing scalp &amp; hair oil, Clear scalp and hair therapy Ultra Shea butter, plus the shampoo and conditioner moisturizes my hair and scalp taming and calming the frizz, fly aways and dry brittle split ends. I alternate between the Clear line of products and the ever straight Brazilian keratin therapy. My hair is more easily managed. When I go to the salon for a hair cut it can take up to three hours to highlight and cut my hair. I can&#x27;t just pop in and have the color touched because of the thickness and full body hair. It&#x27;s a labor intense for my hairdresser.&lt;br /&gt;After shampooing and repeat wash, I use the conditioner and let it sit for 10-15 mins, after rinsing I towel dry my hair and then apply a few drops of the oil to my fingertips or a thin coat of the butter and work it in to my wet hair. I sometimes i use both the butter to my top portion of my hair and scalp. In stead of just working the butter into the part of my hair, go up under the hair on the side of my head on both sides and work into my scalp. I use the oil sparingly only putting a few drops onto the tips of my fingers and lightly work through the layers of my hair and the ends. It&#x27;s easy to brush my hair or even run my fingers through it, my hair dries soft, manageable and with a clean shine to it.&lt;br /&gt;Everyone in our house of 5 uses this same regimen between the Clear line of haircare products andthe ever straight Brazilian keratin therapy line. We have been using it for almost 2 months and we haven&#x27;t had any problems.</li>
    <li> it really doesnt tell you how to use it but i  just  put it on  my  scalp after  my  hair is dry and it keeps  my  hair  and scalp  shiny and looking great. I  really  love that it doesnt have a smell and i  like that  shape of the bottle lastly  a little bit goes a long way</li>
    <li> As African American (Jamaican) it just seems like there&#x27;s no product out there for my texture hair. Anyway after using Pantene for the past 5 years or so I saw the commercial on TV the other day for this product and decided to try it. It&#x27;s been really good so far- better than Pantene. My hair feels more clean and moisturized after using and have definitely seen less breakage. I bought the entire set.</li>
