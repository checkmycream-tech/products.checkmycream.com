      <li>Nothing but good things about this amazing product.</li>

      <li>Bottle and will get more!  </li>

      <li>I love the scent of this!</li>
      <li>The odor is more valerian than lavender!</li>
      <li>You&#x27;re better-off investing in a high-quality softener -- you get much more out of it!</li>
      <li>I hope you&#x27;ll love it, too!</li>
      <li>I love it!</li>
      <li>But all in all the scent is very refreshing and is really nice to have around me while sleeping.</li>
      <li>I love this mist!</li>
      <li>smells amazing though</li>
      <li>that I thought, well even if it doesn&#x27;t help me sleep, it still smells amazing.</li>
      <li>If you&#x27;re putting pillow spray on, you want something great and fantastic.</li>
      <li>I liked the one Origins had out, but they discontinued it, so I sought this one out on the web.</li>
      <li>I have 2 loving.</li>
      <li>One nice thing to note is it doesn&#x27;t leave an after scent on you or the pillow.</li>
      <li>Use this spray for my own bed and my massage therapy table.</li>
      <li>this is a nice smell...</li>
      <li>It freshens sheets and pillows and guests frequently comment about the wonderful smell and how nice they sleep at our house.</li>
      <li>The light and pleasant scent of this mist on your pillow helps you to relax.  </li>
      <li>People need to realize that your mind/body connection is very strong, and the healthier condition your body is, the healthier your mind</li>
      <li>It smells fine - quite cirtusy and bright.</li>
      <li>but it makes me feel happy &amp; calm.  </li>
      <li>the best feature of it all is that it really is not a HEAVY or OVERLY STRONG smell, very light and relaxing if you will!</li>
      <li>Using your 5 senses with this product (smell), and helping your body by detoxifying itself of neurotoxins in your nervous system, you can safely and naturally (which in my opinion is ALWAYS the best, safest, and most effective way) regain your energy and vitality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>This is a good step in the right direction!</li>
      <li>The scent is great, but be aware that the packaging may not be.</li>
      <li>but I love it, its kind of like sweetened orange like chocolate orange almost, its very sweet</li>
      <li>I wish Amazon sold this directly, or better yet offered it as a subscribe and save item.</li>
      <li>He carried it around with him, esp to places where he wouldn&#x27;t be able to smoke.</li>
      <li>but I personally believe its the perfect blend.</li>
      <li>Smells more citrusy than lavender</li>
      <li>refreshing  </li>
      <li>It helped me to sleep better and feel more realaxed in the morning.</li>
      <li>Your Door&amp;#34; customer for life! :)</li>
      <li>Lovely scent.  </li>
      <li>And I have been able to stop taking my sleeping pills.  </li>
      <li>THe books were well written, informative and enjoyable.</li>
      <li>I love the scent, it is one of my favorites but the sprayer has broke on every bottle I have.</li>
      <li>I always sleep way better now.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Smells great, really relaxing, however mine came already broken,  the bottle was unable to squirt. Didn&#x27;t bother asking for another as it was for a Christmas gift and would have arrived late anyway. Transfered to different bottle but could not match the same cap size  and so could not get the mist effect. Possibly why the smell seemed to fade quickly after the wet droplet marks it made on the pillows dried up.</li>
    <li> I really enjoy it and my daughter uses her as a body spray. The only problem I had is the spray splitzer broke. I now have to drop the mist on the pillows.</li>
    <li> I am a very anxious person so when I go to bed things aren&#x27;t any better, but this spray really helps me relax and fall asleep in a matter of minutes.</li>
    <li> Spray this on your pillow lightly.  You will have good dreams and wake up with a smile on your face.</li>
    <li> I bought this product as a gift and now I want some - it smells so great it actually does mellow me out a bit.  Beautiful packaging, plus this company has outstanding customer service.  Would definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> I purchased this item hoping to make my pillows and blankets smell more like lavender to lull me to sleep; however, when I sprayed my bedding, all that I smelled was Lemon \\&quot;Pledge\\&quot; (like the cleaner). This product does NOT smell anything like it claims to and is definitely NOT worth the money! You&#x27;re better-off investing in a high-quality softener -- you get much more out of it!</li>
    <li> This stuff really works!</li>
    <li> This is a lovely scented spray that makes the bedroom smell wonderful.. It is relaxing and I think it helps falling asleep.</li>
    <li> I discovered this almost by accident. I was roaming around a store and saw it. I took a whiff and it smelled SO GOOD that I thought, well even if it doesn&#x27;t help me sleep, it still smells amazing. I&#x27;m a long time insomniac, since something like...birth! So I will try all kinds of things to get to sleep or get back to sleep. This stuff is incredible. If you give yourself over to it and just breathe it in after you&#x27;ve sprayed it on your pillow you will feel it working and next thing you know, you&#x27;re out and it&#x27;s the next morning! Or at least several hours later. I often wake up in the wee hours and if I can&#x27;t get back to sleep spraying this on the pillow and top of the sheet that will be near my face does help. The scent is so relaxing!   One nice thing to note is it doesn&#x27;t leave an after scent on you or the pillow. By the time you wake up again, it&#x27;s all dissipated. No concerns about it mixing with your perfume/cologne in the morning. Also, it doesn&#x27;t leave a mark on your linens so no worries about that. Definitely highly recommend this!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d rather try something natural for insomnia than take medication, so this pillow mist fits the bill. The scent encourages relaxation, is not necessarily \\&quot;girly\\&quot;, and it&#x27;s portable enough to take when traveling.    I loved it. I hope you&#x27;ll love it, too!</li>
    <li> This is geat! The smell is gorgeous...flowery but not too much. I slept with it for the first time last night and slept like a baby. I have fibromyalgia so anything that helps me sleep is a good thing. Its not all oily like some of them are and didnt leave any nasty spray residue on my pillow or hair. The bottle is larger than I thought. Nicely done and worth the price.</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re putting pillow spray on, you want something great and fantastic. This is just meh. Probably never use it again. Way too much orange. Can&#x27;t smell the lavender at all.</li>
    <li> the spray part broke in only 5 sprays. other than that it is ok. I just put it in another bottle.</li>
    <li> I have difficulty sleeping most nights and a friend gave me the Elixir of Dreams for Christmas one year.  I LOVE it!  The fragrance is soft and light and it does induce sleep.  I began using it just about every night and, of course, was beginning to run out.  Apparently, it&#x27;s quite popular because every store I tried to purchase it from had it on back order.  So I ordered it online.</li>
    <li> This pillow mist works great--even on kids!! Just spray pillow lightly--it dries quickly and before you know it you are relaxed and sleeping well. I love all earth therapeutics products!!</li>
    <li> This product is better than I expected!! It really does calm and comfort you, I use it at night on/around my pillows, and sometimes even my clothes! It smells that good!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Probably the best feature of it all is that it really is not a HEAVY or OVERLY STRONG smell, very light and relaxing if you will! I recommend this product for anyone who needs balance themself and take in a deep breathe of fresh lavender aroma to soothe the nervous system! There are NUMEROUS health benefits by RELAXING the mind before going to sleep instead of rushing and becoming restless through the night! Treat your bed as your personal paradise! This is a good step in the right direction! Good rest is Good health!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also one bottle is well worth the money and will go along way!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend [[ASIN:B004KAZTWU ZeoPure - Naturally Cleanse &amp; Detoxify with Liquid Zeolite (15ml)]] as another way to help cleanse and detoxify your mind. People need to realize that your mind/body connection is very strong, and the healthier condition your body is, the healthier your mind/thoughts are, and vice versa, your mind and nerve system are clearer and cleaner and can function so you can live your life positive again. Using your 5 senses with this product (smell), and helping your body by detoxifying itself of neurotoxins in your nervous system, you can safely and naturally (which in my opinion is ALWAYS the best, safest, and most effective way) regain your energy and vitality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Small price to pay for a better qualify of life!</li>
    <li> Great smell.  Very soothing.    I&#x27;m only a little disappointed with two things: I thought it would smell mostly like lavender instead of a mix, and I wish the smell would last longer  -- I don&#x27;t smell it anymore if I wake up in the middle of the night.  The smell is completely gone by morning; maybe that&#x27;s better than being overpowering though...</li>
    <li> I love this pillow spray. It&#x27;s an aroma-therapy pillow spray. I liked the one Origins had out, but they discontinued it, so I sought this one out on the web. I&#x27;m very happy with it and will buy it again.</li>
    <li> i can&#x27;t get enough of this aroma. the blend is fantastic. I think it&#x27;s the orange oil that adds that nice sweetness i love so much.  i find myself compulsively spraying &amp; sniffing the air before i go to bed. it&#x27;s so calming &amp; relaxing. I don&#x27;t think it makes me sleepy but it makes me feel happy &amp; calm.  when i breathe it in &amp; i can immediately feel a change. it smells yummy, no nasty herbal smell like so many other brands.  I don&#x27;t care what properties the natural herbs are \\&quot;supposed\\&quot; to have, i can&#x27;t relax if it smells pooky.  no other brand (and i sniffed a lot!) even comes close to comparing to this formula.  I was having trouble finding this locally so i was searching for another brand i might like. well i didn&#x27;t find one.  I am so happy amazon has this pillow mist,  I almost ran out.  agghh!</li>
    <li> this is a nice smell...more citrus than lavender. it is soothing for nighttime slumber or anytime of of day, really. only complaint is that the cap will not stay on. it never did fit right on either container (i bought two)</li>
    <li> This smells very citrusy.</li>
    <li> I like to give my pillow a quick spritz every night as part of my bedtime routine.  The light citrus aroma is very soothing.  my husband even asks me to spray his pillow now.  I have used numerous linen sprays in the past scented with lavender, chamomile and others and am usually satisfied.  However, many of the sprays I&#x27;ve tried are either a little on the pricey side or are hard to find when replaceents are needed or the scent fades way to quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;this spray isone of the best smelling I have tried, it lasts about a month and is fiscally reasonable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[...]</li>
    <li> So I just got this at my front door, tore it open and sprayed some on my couch pillow I L-O-V-E the scent! I don&#x27;t know if it will help me sleep but I will enjoy smelling it as I try to drift off!  The smell is more orange than lavender but I love it, its kind of like sweetened orange like chocolate orange almost, its very sweet and there is the lavender undertone, it is not a top note for sure the orange sweetness is the top note, I almost wish they had a body spray version of this, yet again if it doesn&#x27;t stain sheets you could conceivably spray it on your clothes I suppose! Great product. Already pretty sure I&#x27;ll repurchase when I run out.</li>
    <li> ... like the scent but the spray mechanism broke the second time I used it :(</li>
    <li> ...how much it really helps because I use other stuff also, but I have been sleeping better.&lt;br /&gt;It smells good and does seem relaxing. Would buy again.</li>
    <li> The product was defective;  the cap was off of the bottle, and the liquid would not spray.  I was hoping to get a product that I could use for relaxation and sleep but I was surprised to discover that I could not use this one.  I threw it out.</li>
    <li> Completely useless! One pump and it is BROKEN! Just spent another 9 dollars on a glass spray bottle. I should have trusted the other reviews.</li>
    <li> This product is so terrific I have re-ordered again!  Just delightul spa scent on my pillow everynight ... and I&#x27;d like to attribute my successful nights&#x27; sleep to this awesome product!</li>
    <li> GReat Taransaction Thank you</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t really know if this product enhances drowsiness... but the soothing scent is bound to relax some people.  I started to use this habitually when I got it and had to leave home for a week and didn&#x27;t even think about bringing this with me... I definitely missed having it when I went to sleep at night.  Small enough bottle to throw in a bag and I&#x27;ll bring it with me next time I leave home.  Bottle was much smaller than I imagined, but it doesn&#x27;t seem as if this will be used up too quickly, even using it every night.  Also received a free massager from the company when I purchased this... it was probably just a short term promotional gift, but that was a nice surprise!  Company also shipped quickly.</li>
    <li> This smells so good and just relaxes me into sleep. Its wonderful. I use it with the shut eye sleep mask and my sleep has improved!</li>
    <li> Spritzer part of the bottle broke so I had to put it in another bottle I had lying around. smells amazing though</li>
    <li> Item delivered quickly &amp; on time. Scent nice, but spray pump broke the second time used. Luckily I had an empty spray bottle to transfer to. Not impressed, especially at $19.95 per bottle.</li>
    <li> I love the way it smells. I was surprised at the way it smelled because usually valarian smells yucky. I can&#x27;t smell the valarian in it. I can only smell the lavander and hints of citrus. It smells so nice and is very relaxing. I bought two more bottles for my 12 and 15 year olds. They love it too. I had to buy some for them because they are always sneaking off with mine. I leave mine on my nightstand and pump one or two squirts over my bed in the air by the time it settles onto the bed/pillows, it doesn&#x27;t leave any oily residue. I read a review that someone had written about it penetrating their pillowcases. I have never spayed my pillowcased or bed directly so I&#x27;ve never had this problem with this product. It actually says to spray it into the air around your pillow. The bottle is kind of small, but because you only need one or two squirts, it lasts a long time. I&#x27;ve had mine for a couple months and the kids and I both use it...there&#x27;s half a bottle left. I&#x27;m sure it will last another couple months. When I run out I know where to get more. :)</li>
    <li> One Star to Earth Therapeutics, not the seller.  This is bottle number THREE....I got one pump out of it and the nozzle broke, sending the tube down into the bottle.  I have to transfer this into another generic spray bottle.  Annoying.  Won&#x27;t buy again.</li>
    <li> love the smell. But apparently it cause massive acne on my face. Not the best reaction.</li>
    <li> I was expecting more of a lavender scent since the item has lavender and valerian on the front of the label as the main scents.  But the orange oil masks them all, and I don&#x27;t, personally, find orange oil aroma relaxing or even pleasant.  I think the label on the front should be clearer about the main scent, or else remove the orange oil from the blend entirely.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent product.  My best friend and I both buy this product over and over.  It smells really great and is great for helping me relax as I go to sleep</li>
    <li> If you have a busy life style and sometimes have difficulty getting to sleep, Elixir of Dreams is just right for you.    The light and pleasant scent of this mist on your pillow helps you to relax.  So, breathe in deeply and let the soothing fragrances take you away to a place where your mind is calm and at peace.</li>
    <li> Smells really nice, strong enough to enjoy and relax you, but not overwhelming.  It helped me to sleep better and feel more realaxed in the morning.</li>
    <li> This has a lovely, light, smell but I just can not tolerate it.  It made me wheeze and sneeze; not for me Mike!!</li>
    <li> I ordered this to srpay on my pillows, because I had heard that lavender scent helps one sleep. It worked fairly well, but I didn&#x27;t know that it was somewhat oily. That, I didn&#x27;t like because of the oil penatrating my pillow cases. I guess I will just spray in the air around my bed.</li>
    <li> I bought two, thinking that while I&#x27;m ordering...go ahead and stock up.  Opened the first can, and on first spray of the mist, the pump broke.  Useless.  Then thought I could open the other on, use it, and then refill it when empty with the broken can.  First spray, it breaks, too.  What a piece of crap.  I spent $28 bucks on this stuff, and I still have to go buy a sprayer to pour it into.  Save your time and money.</li>
    <li> I love lavendar spray for our bed and for the guest bed, and especially for the couches. This is such a wonderful treat to have around. It freshens sheets and pillows and guests frequently comment about the wonderful smell and how nice they sleep at our house.</li>
    <li> I love the smell of this Elixir of Dreams.  It is wonderful!  When I get into bed and smell this I am so ready to rest!  I am often sensitive to certain perfumes, but this product is not a problem.  In addition, delivery was fast.  This is my third purchase from Earth Therapeutics.  They sell quality products and I will keep buying from them.</li>
    <li> I love the scent of this! I expected it to have a more classic lavender scent- it does have more lemon or orange undertone than I was expecting. But all in all the scent is very refreshing and is really nice to have around me while sleeping. Even my husband complimented it, which is impressive because he normally doesn&#x27;t notice much of anything \\&quot;perfume\\&quot; wise.&lt;br /&gt;I do think it helps me to relax at the end of the day, so I would purchase again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ETA: After about a week of use the top of my bottle did break, as others have mentioned happening. All I have to do is pop the lid off and push the nozzle back into place. It&#x27;s not a devastating break, but annoying enough.</li>
    <li> 2nd time I used the spray pump broke. Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> Had an issue with the sprayer on the bottle but Anna was more than happy to help me with the issue after I couldnt get ahold of amazon. Even though the product was fulfilled by Amazon and not Anna, she was still willing to help me out. Thank you very much for the quality customer service! I will be a &amp;#34;At Your Door&amp;#34; customer for life! :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great aroma. Smells more citrusy than lavender but I personally believe its the perfect blend. Very soothing.</li>
    <li> I use this every single night and it is SOOOOO relaxing!</li>
    <li> My husband is obsessed with this stuff. He swears that he sleeps better with it. I always have to tell him to stop spraying it ! It isn&#x27;t a overwhelming scent it is gentle and has a hint of orange.</li>
    <li> When the item arrived, the top was \\&quot;loose\\&quot; and would not click down securely onto the bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then, the very first time I sprayed it, the pump stayed down and I could not get it to come back up, rendering the product useless.</li>
    <li> This smells really nice, but does not last very long. I got this to aid in my falling asleep, but it doesn&#x27;t stick around long enough to help much. The spray bottle did not work very well as it broke within a couple sprays.</li>
    <li> I love this mist! It&#x27;s a nice little treat I give my pillow before my head hits it. Just taking in this scent relaxes me. And it doesn&#x27;t leave anything weird on my pillow.</li>
    <li> My daughter and I have used this product for several years.  We do love it, but think the price is quite high.  I will be looking elsewhere for it or something similar.</li>
    <li> Smells good but the bottle cap broke off after one use. Can&#x27;t spray anymore....</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband, who has problems sleeping. He now uses it every night and I enjoy the scent and its effect with him. He says it helps him staying asleep, too. I&#x27;m on my second bottle now</li>
    <li> sprayer was broken when I got this and it&#x27;s sealed shut so I couldn&#x27;t even remove the contents of the bottle and put into a spray bottle.</li>
    <li> Spent 21.96 on this and to have it not work . I even tried to double up the spray on there and it still didn&#x27;t work . I&#x27;m a bad insominac and been looking for something natural to us and with 25 successful reviews I was hoping it would help but it  didn&#x27;t if it did I would be asleep right now .</li>
    <li> I have 2 loving. Big boxers. Who take every. Chance they can get yo jump in out bed&#x27;s But just. A little. Mist of the pillow. Spray and my bed smells heavenly. This is my 2nd. Bottle and will get more!  I have tried other. Sprays for your sheets but this is the one you need! Try it and you will never use any other one!  You will sleep so ho with a mist of fresh scents to dream on!</li>
    <li> First sprayer broke and had to buy a cheap sprayer bottle to use the rest of it (lasts longer than original sprayer). Bought second pillow most thinking the first one was defective: broke even quicker. Taking it back tomorrow.</li>
    <li> This product is ok but I don&#x27;t like the smell.</li>
    <li> Love this scent because it really helps me fall asleep fast.  It is a perfect scent for me and I will use this product forever.  Highly recommend to people who love lavender.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t stink.. I bought this thinking it would smell like lavender.. Hoping that it won&#x27;t smell like those generic lavender.  Well, it&#x27;s anything far from lavender.  It&#x27;s very citrusy... invigorating. refreshing  Instead of calming scent of fresh Lavender.</li>
    <li> Very nice, very soothing. I like the scent and it helps me relax at night. My only complaint is that a lot of spray comes out at one touch, so tread lightly. It makes me feel like the product is being used up too fast, so not economical. Other than that, it&#x27;s awesome!</li>
    <li> The description did not mention the ozs. for this product. It is advertised as a pillow mist, yet instructions state to spray around the room over resting place. The odor is more valerian than lavender! Too citrus! Displeased with this product!Too expensive, especially since I don&#x27;t use it.</li>
    <li> I disliked this so much I got rid of it with not even a quarter of it gone. I tried to like it. I thought maybe spraying it on my pillow would help me fall asleep easier, happier, more relaxed, but no. I use the Bath &amp; Body Work Aromatherapy Stress Relief Pillow Mist in Eucalyptus Spearmint. That is fabulous. This, I&#x27;m sorry I was sold by other people&#x27;s good reviews.</li>
    <li> Spray broke and had to change the mist to a different container. But it smells great.</li>
    <li> This does have a bit of a citrusy undertone.  I LIKE the fact that it is not the same old overpowering lavender.  I keep it under my pillow and give it a squirt when I awaken during the night and then snuggle right back in.</li>
    <li> Really helps me fall asleep! I suffer from both anxiety and insomnia, and this spray along with the Dream Silk lotion make sleeping so easy now. I have been able to cut back on my bedtime med because of these amazing products. The spray is wonderful, I spray under my pillow, on my pillow and sometimes on my blankets, so I am wrapped up in the soothing aromatherapy. The only complaint is the scent is basically gone by the next day so I have to use this every night. I don&#x27;t mind terribly as it&#x27;s now part of my bedtime routine.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend looking for this at a store that carries ET products, or go to their website to buy it. In the store (Ulta) it was $9.99 and on the website it comes in s Slumber Party kit where you get the full size spray, full size Dream Silk lotion and an eye mask, for $19.99.</li>
    <li> I love the scent, it is one of my favorites but the sprayer has broke on every bottle I have. They need to fix that defect in the sprayer.</li>
    <li> Extremely shoddy packaging. It arrived today, and I pressed the spray button and it broke! The bottle is made of real cheap material and did not last a few minutes...</li>
    <li> Use this spray for my own bed and my massage therapy table. Very, very relaxing. Light enough that it doesn&#x27;t bother those with allergies, enough scent to sooth.</li>
    <li> 1 Squit and it broke. Took it apart to put in another squirt bottle and the inside tubing and spring launched oily liquid all over my new carpet👎.</li>
    <li> They  were all great products. THe books were well written, informative and enjoyable. Could not put them down.</li>
    <li> Really 2.5 - The packaging should get 0 stars but the scent gets 5. I bought this at an Ulta cosmetics store. It was $9.00 and it smelled so good. The scent is really very nice and I was very much looking forward to putting it on my pillow but the very first time I tried to use it, the pump broke! I pressed it down one time and there was a clunk sound then the pump wouldn&#x27;t work. I was really bummed! So I immediately went to exchange the product at another Ulta location closer to my home but apparently they don&#x27;t all carry the same products so I was out of luck. Their website does not currently have this product in stock either so of course I looked here on Amazon and yes they have it BUT it&#x27;s almost 3 times the price (at Ulta I had a coupon making this product closer to $7-8). That also gave me opportunity to read the reviews here on Amazon and I see I&#x27;m not alone in having the pump break right away. It&#x27;s really too bad the manufacturer made such a nice product but cheaped out on the packaging.&lt;br /&gt;I would actually still consider buying the product if I could put it in a different spray bottle but after reading other reviews apparently they make the bottle in a way that you can&#x27;t open it to transfer the contents. Really you shouldn&#x27;t have to go that far but the scent is truly pleasant and relaxing so I would entertain the idea. Come on, Earth Theraputics!!! Spend another 10 cents on a better bottle and pump mechanism! It&#x27;s sad that you created this lovely formula but most of us can&#x27;t use it.</li>
    <li> Arrived on time and in good condition. Aroma is awesome. Dispenser broke after three sprays. Difficult and messy to \\&quot;try and fix\\&quot;. Not sure how many more sprays I will enjoy before it breaks again. I probably would have been a hooked customer who regularly purchased quantities of this item, however the broken dispenser is a huge obstacle for a product meant to \\&quot;relax\\&quot; you to over come. Love the Aroma, hate the dispenser.</li>
    <li> This is a scent that is calming and tends to put me in a very serene and happy mood.  i would recommend it to any one who wants a good night&#x27;s sleep.</li>
    <li> The spray nozzle broke the first time I used it!</li>
    <li> With the Elixir of Dreams pillow mist, I am &amp;#34;out like a light&amp;#34;. Try it. You will love this product.</li>
    <li> This spray smells more orange-like than anything else, but the fresh, clean scent is excellent in helping me to calm down and relax to sleep.</li>
    <li> smells amazing! I have had for 2.5 months and the spray bottle broke!</li>
    <li> I have used this spray for two years and I absolutely love the scent! It has a delicate lavender and orange fragrance that captivates your nostrils. I spray this on my pillows and my fiancé&#x27;s pillows and we slip into a restful sleep. I don&#x27;t miss a night without it! I use one spray per pillow holding the spray about six inches from my pillow. One bottle lasts me about six months. It is just so wonderful!</li>
    <li> Was upset i ordered this. I thought it would help me sleep but all it did was make my pillow smell like pines sole. or detergent. And it only smells like a strong orange. the smell fades away in 30 minutes too. Most terrible buy i ever made on amazon. thankfully they refunded me. don&#x27;t waste your money. go to bed bath and beyond or any other store and buy regular lavender.</li>
    <li> This has a very pleasant smell.  It seems like it has hints of citrus in it as well.  It&#x27;s definitely a light, clean and soothing scent.  Unfortunately my pump-spray leaks, pretty much constantly and has to be stored on a paper towel at all times.  I do like the scent a great deal and would recommend it based on that.  In particular, I&#x27;ve always been very iffy on the smell of Valerian and was worried that this spray would smell too much like it.  It doesn&#x27;t, in fact, I personally can&#x27;t detect the Valerian (which is a good thing, from my perspective).  Hopefully my problems with the pump spray dispenser are just a fluke, or perhaps it was somehow damaged.  The scent is great, but be aware that the packaging may not be.</li>
    <li> This is a great product, the smell is calming and relaxing. Worth it.</li>
    <li> I got this for my friend who was having trouble falling asleep as an alternative to smoking. He used it (and apparently smoked anyway.) He ended up sleeping an absurd amount of time and we suspect it might be the \\&quot;doubling up\\&quot; of his normal sleep aids (he said smoking helped him fall asleep. I was trying to help him quit.) He carried it around with him, esp to places where he wouldn&#x27;t be able to smoke. Last I asked him about it, he said it stopped spritzing and started more like squirting. I&#x27;d give it fine reviews for effectivity but low reviews on design.</li>
    <li> Smells really nice, strong enough to enjoy and relax you, but not overwhelming. It helped me to sleep better and feel more realaxed in the morning.Help mi with my migrene</li>
    <li> helps me sleep with the lavendar and valarim</li>
    <li> Same as everyone else... nozzle broke within five uses. Wonderful product, terrible packaging. Now I have to figure out how to get this top off the way the others have</li>
    <li> Love and the scent last a while</li>
    <li> nothing like lavender......citrus juice......item was tagged with a price label from another company. The sprayer broke after two or three sprays.  Totally disappointing. Never again!</li>
    <li> Should have listened to the other reviewers. Bottle is a POS. First try, the pump broke.&lt;br /&gt;Getting the bottle open, to re-use the liquid in a $0.25 pump from CVS that has worked for years, is mission impossible.&lt;br /&gt;My advice is to not waste your money on this.</li>
    <li> While the scent is wonderful, the nozzle broke after the first use. :-/</li>
    <li> Loved smell! We were so excited to use this every night but after 3 nights inside mechanisms broke and it doesn&#x27;t spray:( great smell, defective bottle</li>
    <li> This amazing product has been a central part of my sleep routine ever since i was a little girl. When i would have trouble going to sleep at night, i would ask my mom to use the &amp;#34;magic spray&amp;#34; and its helped me sleep, 20 years later. The smell is so beautiful and relaxing. Because this is such a unique blend of smells, and its been a part of my life for such a long time, I immediately feel content and happy when i smell it. Nothing but good things about this amazing product.</li>
    <li> there is no smell of lavender at all !&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;18 dollars for this small bottle without the lavender fragrance that I ordered - ridiculous!</li>
    <li> I got this for a dd (9 years old) to help her fall asleep at night. The lavendar smell calms her down and she enjoys the nightly ritual of spraying her pillow before falling asleep. Unfortunately, one night she droped the bottle and the spray part of the bottle no longer works. It&#x27;s not a twist-off bottle spray top so we had to figure out how to pop off the top, but we managed to pour the liquid in a different bottle...so far so good.</li>
    <li> sleep problems or not - what a wonderful mist to spray above your pillow before you lay your head down.  it smells so relaxing there is no way to let your mind drift on the worries of the day.  i suffer from severe headaches and jaw pain, it just seems to melt the pain away - or at least draw my attention away from it.  I&#x27;m thinking of getting some for christmas presents this year!</li>
    <li> I have tried the [[ASIN:B0075PWYNY Bath &amp; Body Works Aromatherapy Lavender Chamomile Sleep Pillow Mist 5.3 oz]] alongside this product, and for me this product works better.&lt;br /&gt;It does say Valerian and Lavender on the bottle, but as other reviewers have noted, the main scent you smell is the citrus.  I find the citrus scent more soothing and relaxing than the Bath &amp; Body Works pillow mist that I purchased.  Other reviewers also noted that the scent doesn&#x27;t last long, but for me it seems to last long enough.  I believe the scent lasts between 30 minute to an hour, which has always been plenty of time for me to fall asleep.&lt;br /&gt;I have used this every night for a week now, and find that after I spray it, it is easier for me to focus on the citrus scent and relax without my mind racing.  And I have been able to stop taking my sleeping pills.  I wish Amazon sold this directly, or better yet offered it as a subscribe and save item.</li>
    <li> The pillow mist has a great scent and does help relax me when it&#x27;s bed time. I would definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love everything about this product, but on my 4th spray it broke &#x3D;(</li>
    <li> As soon as I opened the box it was shipped in I could already smell the lavender.  Excellent product.  True lavender smell.  I love it.</li>
    <li> Lovely scent.  Used it once, though, and the cheap spray pump broke immediately thereafter.  What a rip.  Grrrrrrr. . .</li>
    <li> This is a very good product, with one BIG exception. The pump sprayer breaks and won&#x27;t mist the liquid. This is the 2nd time this has happened, making the contents next to useless.</li>
    <li> This was just ok.  Very citrus scented.  The plastic spray pump broke after a couple uses and I had to pour it into another spray bottle in order to use it.  Expected more for the money.</li>
    <li> It smells fine - quite cirtusy and bright. We actually use it as bathroom spray.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s too strong in my opinion to spray on a pillow.</li>
    <li> amazing! puts me right to sleep and the sent isn&#x27;t over powering :)</li>
    <li> This stuff has the best smell ever!! Love crawling in bed.</li>
    <li> This is an awesome pillow mist.  I find it helps me relax and fall asleep faster.  Great price too!  ,,</li>
    <li> This is way better then any sleep aide I ever used ( Melotonin tablets and lavender oil). Four sprays, 1 minute and I actually feel exhausted! I always sleep way better now. A must buy</li>
    <li> I love the scent! I spray it on my bed every night. I gave the product 3 stars because the spray mechanism broke on first use. I transferred the spray into a new bottle and have not had any problems since. This was disappointing though.</li>
    <li> Loved the smell!  However, I&#x27;ve had to return 2 of them now because the sprayer broke after a couple uses.  Won&#x27;t be buying again.</li>
    <li> For the money, I think the amount of product is too small. I was expecting a larger container, but I do like the fragrance.</li>
    <li> This fragrance is wonderful...I swear it makes me fall asleep faster when I spray it on my pillow...I travel with it as well...I love it!</li>
    <li> All the reviews are true.  The smell is GREAT but the packaging is TERRIBLE!  I am not exaggerating when I say that I sprayed it TWICE and the pump BROKE! Seriously?!?! $20 for a linen spray and the bottle breaks!?  I bought a new spray bottle and added water to it to stretch it out, and it still smells fabulous, but I won&#x27;t buy it again for the hassle of it.</li>
    <li> The product gets five stars. The current packaging gets negative stars!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My daughter gave me a bottle of this a while back and it became a part of my bedtime ritual. Such a clean and soothing scent! Very, very nice. It lasted over a year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I was very sad when it ran out, but was glad to find it at Ulta. However, the first time I used it the sprayer broke. I returned it and they gave me another one. When I pressed the spray head down in its first use, it, too broke! There is something faulty in the packaging, as you can read from the other reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had thought I would remove the spray assembly and put it in another spray bottle, but it was constructed in such a way that I couldn&#x27;t take it apart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I thought that maybe I could buy from a different lot on Amazon, but I see from the reviews that I&#x27;m not the only one with this problem. I will wait a while for the manufacturer to figure out they need to change something back to the way my first bottle worked, and then I will buy again.</li>
    <li> Ordered twice so far, am addicted to this when I go to bed. Smells great. Will order again and again.</li>
    <li> It smells nice, but this is the second one I&#x27;ve bought because the sprayer broke, and then it happened again!&lt;br /&gt;I mean honestly, for this price, the container should be better quality.  Now I have to practically full pillow mists that are unusable</li>
</ol>
