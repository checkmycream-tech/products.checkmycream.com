    <li> I&#x27;ve worn Samsara Eau De Toilette by Guerlain for several years which says a lot. Normally, I get bored and move on to a new scent. But Samsara is an addictive scent. It&#x27;s light, clean and sensual. Without fail, when I wear it someone notices, likes it, and asks what scent it is. You won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>

    <li> Love the scent....always get compliments on it....only use Guerlain scents....Shalimar and Samsara....any which way that I can het them.....really ike</li>
    <li> I bought this for my wife because she was almost close to finishing the earlier one that I had bought for her.&lt;br /&gt;As soon as she tried it she could tell it was not the same EDT as the older one she had.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We could have filled the older bottle with water and not known the difference.</li>
    <li> This company makes some delicious scents. Shalimar is more subtle, but when I desire a fragrance that lasts, this is the one.</li>

    <li> I had forgotten about this perfume!  I used to wear it about 10 years ago and had completely forgotten how much I loved it and when I saw it on Amazon, I knew I had to order it.  I admit, I checked the websites of my local department stores and was amazed at how much more they wanted, so I came back and ordered it.  Now when I wear it, I&#x27;m reminded of things I did in my &amp;#34;younger&amp;#34; years!</li>
    <li> This product was correct and I worked perfectly</li>
    <li> I might be boring using the same perfume for years, but why ruined a good thing.  Love this scent.  I get compliments on it almost every time I wear it.  A little spicy, not overwhelming....</li>
