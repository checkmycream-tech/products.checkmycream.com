### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>I recommend to others who are looking for body shapers at a great price!</li>
      <li>LOVE IT!!!</li>
      <li>These are great to cover up or suck in muffin tops.</li>
      <li>The tummy area was nicely flattened without strangling me!</li>
      <li>It is incredibly stretchy and honestly does not hide or help shape anything.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s also good to work out in.  </li>
      <li>I really enjoyed this product, it was the perfect fit.</li>
      <li>I liked the changes and I feel better about the way I look.</li>
      <li>Very comfortable</li>
      <li>but I still love it...</li>
      <li>I wear my bra over the top of this item for better comfort, but you can try and see what you like beter.</li>
      <li>That is the most important measurement!</li>
      <li>It works better than most body shappers out there</li>
      <li>But once I did I was pleased with the outcome.</li>
      <li>Nevertheless, it does smooth my imperfections nicely.  </li>
      <li>&lt;br /&gt;it would have cost me more money to return it.  </li>
      <li>they make you feel and look confident.</li>
      <li>my friends and i just love these.</li>
      <li>The upper portion of the top brought the side breast in line with my silhouette - YES!!!!</li>
      <li>I love how they feel.</li>
      <li>I do wish it was like a body suit to help it from sliding upwards...with a snap for easy bathroom use, but its just a top...</li>
      <li>I have used these for years to smooth things out and Amazon had a much better price than the stores had.</li>
      <li>It is comfortable and works...</li>
      <li>This product holds you in, it is comfortable and it stays in place.</li>
      <li>nude color does not show under most clothing, but under very light weight fabrics and some whites it may be noticeable, mainly because of the difference between the shaper fabric and your bra.  </li>
      <li>Well worth the price!</li>
      <li>This is a re-purchase, I&#x27;ll buy more as I wear them out, or slim down even more!  </li>
      <li>The back fat wasn&#x27;t helped much but did smooth most of the pudgies.</li>
      <li>I was slightly smaller in the pooch area and made a better look in a side view silhouette.</li>
      <li>and you don&#x27;t get hot in them under your clothes.</li>
      <li>I bought one size smaller than the chart suggests and I am glad I did.  </li>
      <li>I felt better about my overall appearance.</li>
      <li>I love the Kymaro for smoothing out bulges and such.</li>
      <li>I do not feel hot, you do not see lines, and it really pushes the boobs up..but not to much.</li>
      <li>I bought a large.</li>
      <li>This shaper was entirely to large &amp; did nothing for me</li>
      <li>I purchased the size large in the body shaper based on my bra size 36C.  </li>
      <li>so I then bought a large thinking that might have been the issue.</li>
      <li>but not to much... not a deal breaker.</li>
      <li>and I use this item on a daily bases to smooth out those stuborn areas...</li>
      <li>and it helps smooth out my stomach and back.</li>
      <li>and I really like it.</li>
      <li>thanks.</li>
      <li>Very unsatisfied with this item</li>
      <li>and I mailed the original size back</li>
      <li>No big deal for me, but the next day they shipped the replacement size for me! :)</li>
      <li>It really hold you in, as long as you get the right size.</li>
      <li>and sometimes it is a little too warm, but I need the extra support because I am on my feet all day bending, lifting, and reaching.</li>
      <li>At first i only requested a refund</li>
      <li>But the nude one stands out under the collar too loudly!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s more like wearing a very expensive tank top.  </li>
      <li>I bought a extra large</li>
      <li>I would recommend going through the company that deals with Kymaro directly.</li>
      <li>Also, it comes up high on your back, so anything low cut in the back is out.  </li>
      <li>One complaint is that it does not stay to the original sizing as long as I would like</li>

<li> This body shaper is nothing like the ones I have previously ordered or bought elsewhere.  </li>
<li> When I wear the black one I don&#x27;t mind.</li>
<li> was sent to me with a smell of mold &amp; a black stain like the item</li>
<li> It helps slightly.</li>
<li> it could have been a little snugger.</li>
<li> this product does not fit to size.</li>
<li> and I actually ordered the wrong size not realizing it.</li>
<li> I&#x27;m not sure whats happened</li>
<li> However the straps are a little uncomfortable, And they can be seen with a lot of my blouses/shirts.</li>
<li> Not a good product!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> This is a re-purchase, I&#x27;ll buy more as I wear them out, or slim down even more!  Very comfortable and I don&#x27; tget backaches when I work in them.</li>
    <li> I bought it at a retail store for $30. I had some difficulty getting it over my hips. But once I did I was pleased with the outcome. I really wanted to hide back fat and that was the least improved body part. It helps slightly. The one place it did help was the bust line. When your breasts exceed the edges of your front silhouette the affect makes you look heavier. The upper portion of the top brought the side breast in line with my silhouette - YES!!!! The tummy area was nicely flattened without strangling me! The back fat wasn&#x27;t helped much but did smooth most of the pudgies. So here are my stats so you can make a body comparison. I bought a large. I&#x27;m 5&#x27;3\\&quot; and weight 158 lbs. Before - 41.5\\&quot; hips, 39\\&quot; pooch, 36.5\\&quot; waist, 35\\&quot; back fat, 39.5\\&quot; breast. After measurements were 40\\&quot; hips, 37\\&quot; pooch, 35\\&quot; waist, 35\\&quot; back fat and 39.5\\&quot; breast. I felt better about my overall appearance. I was slightly smaller in the pooch area and made a better look in a side view silhouette. I liked the changes and I feel better about the way I look. That is the most important measurement!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure whats happened but these are not the ones I bought at Walmart. They were no support in the tummy area like before. I bought a extra large so I then bought a large thinking that might have been the issue. Not a good product!</li>
    <li> I have yet to receive it and I have tried cancelling my order or getting them to send me another one and the lady I talked to said there is nothing that they can do about it.</li>
    <li> I love the Kymaro for smoothing out bulges and such. And it sits in place below the belly, it does not slide or roll up. However the straps are a little uncomfortable, And they can be seen with a lot of my blouses/shirts. When I wear the black one I don&#x27;t mind. But the nude one stands out under the collar too loudly!</li>
    <li> This body shaper is nothing like the ones I have previously ordered or bought elsewhere.  It is incredibly stretchy and honestly does not hide or help shape anything.  It&#x27;s more like wearing a very expensive tank top.  I would recommend going through the company that deals with Kymaro directly.</li>
    <li> Although I can wear this body shaper, it is too long for my body type and crinkles because it probably fits a taller woman than me. I don&#x27;t think the product does everything advertised.</li>
    <li> Does what it advertises.  One complaint is that it does not stay to the original sizing as long as I would like but it does continue to do the job for quite a while.</li>
    <li> This kymaro was flimsy  so i went online and ordered it from kymaro . I did have a kymaro that I had previously ordered to compare it to so I Knew what to look for!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I really enjoyed this product, it was the perfect fit. I recommend to others who are looking for body shapers at a great price!</li>
    <li> I do a lot of online shopping and I actually ordered the wrong size not realizing it. At first i only requested a refund and I mailed the original size back so I expected a few dollars back since I wouldn&#x27;t be reimbursed for shipping. On the refund request I said I ordered a L and needed an XL. No big deal for me, but the next day they shipped the replacement size for me! :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is my 2nd body shaper by Kymaro and I LOOOOOVE it! It works better than most body shappers out there and it helps smooth out my stomach and back.</li>
    <li> These are great to cover up or suck in muffin tops. I like that they breath and you don&#x27;t get hot in them under your clothes. This is my third set. I love how they feel.</li>
    <li> I have used these for years to smooth things out and Amazon had a much better price than the stores had. Shipped promptly and was just as I had expected.</li>
    <li> thanks. my friends and i just love these. they make you feel and look confident. thank you for your product</li>
    <li> I purchased the size large in the body shaper based on my bra size 36C.  This shaper was entirely to large &amp; did nothing for me&lt;br /&gt;it would have cost me more money to return it.  So I will just take the lost.</li>
    <li> I have a 40 inch waist, a size 14 16...and I use this item on a daily bases to smooth out those stuborn areas... It is comfortable and works... I do not feel hot, you do not see lines, and it really pushes the boobs up..but not to much. I wear my bra over the top of this item for better comfort, but you can try and see what you like beter. I do wish it was like a body suit to help it from sliding upwards...with a snap for easy bathroom use, but its just a top...but I still love it... I wear it with everything, pants, dresses, and short/skirts... LOVE IT!!! This product does not role, if it does you need a bigger size. I do have to pull it down and rearange after going to the bathroom, or sitting for a long time period. but not to much... not a deal breaker.</li>
    <li> I bought one size smaller than the chart suggests and I am glad I did.  I am not overweight at all, but I wanted the shoulder and back support.  Nevertheless, it does smooth my imperfections nicely.  I wish it were a little tighter for better support on my shoulders but because I am tall, I&#x27;m afraid the straps would be too short.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The nude color does not show under most clothing, but under very light weight fabrics and some whites it may be noticeable, mainly because of the difference between the shaper fabric and your bra.  Also, it comes up high on your back, so anything low cut in the back is out.  I wear it to work and sometimes it is a little too warm, but I need the extra support because I am on my feet all day bending, lifting, and reaching.</li>
    <li> this product does not fit to size. item was too big for the size&lt;br /&gt;I will not make any future purchases from this site&lt;br /&gt;product was sent to me with a smell of mold &amp; a black stain like the item was sitting in a damp room..YUK!!</li>
    <li> it could have been a little snugger.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t hold in your tummy or nothing else.  Advertisement is not what it appears to be. Very unsatisfied with this item</li>
    <li> This product holds you in, it is comfortable and it stays in place. It has not &amp;#34;rode&amp;#34; up on me. I have been wearing this brand body shaper for a while now and I really like it. It really hold you in, as long as you get the right size. It&#x27;s also good to work out in.  Well worth the price!</li>
