      <li>It is amazing at applying foundation.</li>
      <li>The clutch they come in is amazing.  </li>
      <li>honestly it already seems to be fading.  </li>
      <li>The case is nice.  </li>
      <li>received this item with a discount for my honest review.</li>
      <li>However I really liked using them for concealer, highlight, contouring, and setting my under eye powder.  </li>
      <li>You receive a nice assortment of face and precision brushes.</li>
      <li>I tried to leave them opened for a couple of days and the odor was very strong still.</li>
      <li>However I realized there is a very strong smell associated with the brushes and carrier.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>Glad they give you a guideline for what brushes work where... Nice product.</li>
      <li>Love these brushes, they&#x27;re so soft and the packaging is beautiful!  </li>
      <li>The bag had a very strong smell of chemicals and plastic which made me think the brushes were not even safe to use.</li>
      <li>the pouch is really cute as well.</li>
      <li>I love these brushes.</li>
      <li>I am in love.</li>
      <li>I love these brushes.</li>
      <li>What I love most is that they do not retain makeup in the bristles so you&#x27;re sure to not be wasting any.</li>
      <li>I love them all.  </li>
      <li>I am in love with them.</li>
      <li>Love these.</li>
      <li>so maybe once I use them more, things will change,  but the pockets for the brushes are a bit snug.</li>
      <li>Upon receiving these brushes I was very excited to see what a cute package they came in.</li>
      <li>Very sturdy and feel nice on your face!</li>
      <li>Received on time as expected, packaged great!</li>
      <li>Instead of easily sliding in and out, I have to work at it a bit.</li>
      <li>They didn&#x27;t have the cheap plastic smell that most brushes that cost this cheap have.</li>
      <li>The set does have a strong smell (remember opening baby dolls as a kid?</li>
      <li>I always think that having a good set of brushes is a must and tried to buy this set to try but was highly disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>and they have held up just fine.</li>
      <li>Im pretty happy, and wasn&#x27;t really expecting it for that price.</li>
      <li>Very comparable to my favorite MAC and Sigma brushes, but at a fraction of the price!</li>
      <li>It would be awesome for traveling or everyday storage.</li>
      <li>but I am happy with the choice considering the white case.  </li>
      <li>After some tugging, the brush heads don&#x27;t appear to shed and the metal ferrule seems securely attached to the handle.  </li>
      <li>plus - I only experienced shedding with these brushes when I very first pulled them out of the package.</li>
      <li>They were shipped will and the plastic over all the brushes kept them clean and sanitary.</li>
      <li>I may end up reaching for these brushes more than my high end ones!</li>
      <li>The precision brushes aren&#x27;t very densely packed and I prefer denser brushes because I feel like I&#x27;m using more product</li>
      <li>My favorite is the flat top brush.</li>
      <li>First impression: this brush set exceeded my expectations in that they are silky smooth and appear well made.  </li>
      <li>The small brushes are great for the fine lines and for applying eyeshadows and blending.</li>
      <li>I actually bought these brushes based on the reviews, and to my surprise they have turned out pretty good.</li>
      <li>They are super soft and adorable.</li>
      <li>you&#x27;re looking for amazing, luxurious brushes without spending an arm and a leg, look no further!</li>
      <li>Now, that may not be an issue for everyone; but being a professional makeup artist, it&#x27;s important to have tools that won&#x27;t leave fibers on your client&#x27;s face!</li>
      <li>These are by far my favorite brushes I have tried.</li>
      <li>These brushes are super soft and easy to blend with.</li>
      <li>Perfect for someone new to makeup brushes that needs a little guidance, I highly highly recommend.</li>
      <li>nice thing about this set is that there is a very big variety of essential brushes, and they are all very unique.</li>
      <li>far as the brushes themselves, they are honestly so soft, and they work amazingly.</li>
      <li>I absolutely love the variety of big brushes.</li>
      <li>Had a funny paint smell to them.</li>
      <li>Since they are synthetic, they work really well with both cream, and powder products!</li>
      <li>The picture guide is kind of hard to read though if you&#x27;re already familiar with make up brushes.</li>
      <li>They are super soft.  </li>
      <li>have been considering buying a more expensive set (like MAC, it cosmetics, or Sigma), and I&#x27;m so glad I didnt!</li>
      <li>I really don&#x27;t have anything else like these in my collection!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another</li>
      <li>Each brush is soft and dense (but not too dense, just right).</li>
      <li>Very soft and pretty.</li>
      <li>I did clean the brushes prior to use.</li>
      <li>There was a slight plastic-y smell coming from the brushes, but it wasn&#x27;t overwhelming, and faded</li>
      <li>It is very soft and feels very durable.  </li>
      <li>Very soft bristles, blends color well, and they are so dense!</li>
      <li>Overall, a 5 star first impression!  </li>
      <li>used the brushes later that evening, and they made a huge difference in my makeup application, especially foundation.</li>
      <li>washed the brushes, and these brushes are so thick and dense that it took me forever to rice the soap out, so make sure you are very cautious about rinsing the soap out.</li>
      <li>I use them to blend my cream contouring and my primer and bb, I like that they are very soft and leave no trace of the streaks.</li>
      <li>very professional</li>
      <li>I received these brushes this morning, and all I can say is WOW!</li>
      <li>These are incredibly soft brushes!</li>
      <li>My first thoughts on these brushes were obviously the packaging - it blew me away!</li>
      <li>They are also so soft and we&#x27;ll made.</li>
      <li>the trim/interior has a buttery soft &amp;#34;pleather&amp;#34; feel.  </li>
      <li>The handle is solid and they are very well made.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Great product I would recommend getting it</li>
    <li> Love these brushes! Very sturdy and feel nice on your face! I have washed them 2 x since purchase and absolutely no bristle shedding! They do smell a bit like paint when you first get them, but i just washed them and let them air dry and they were good to go!&lt;br /&gt;* i recieved a discount on these brushes</li>
    <li> These are incredibly soft brushes! Received on time as expected, packaged great! Fantastic brushes!!</li>
    <li> I received these brushes in the mail today and immediately had to try them out. While they are very dense, they still have a soft and fluffy feel to them. What I love most is that they do not retain makeup in the bristles so you&#x27;re sure to not be wasting any. They are very comparable to Sigma brushes for a fraction of the price - definitely recommend these!</li>
    <li> Love these. I&#x27;ve only had them for a month or two so maybe once I use them more, things will change,  but the pockets for the brushes are a bit snug. Instead of easily sliding in and out, I have to work at it a bit.</li>
    <li> i received this item and i really loved it it has great brushes for mostly everything it works well with the makeup and everything. very professional</li>
    <li> Love the brushes! Very soft and pretty. I did clean the brushes prior to use. Had a funny paint smell to them. You can use this discount code GK3ZIDZF and get them at a cheaper price.</li>
    <li> got this for my wife and she loves the brushes...</li>
    <li> These are good brushes for the price. You receive a nice assortment of face and precision brushes. The precision brushes aren&#x27;t very densely packed and I prefer denser brushes because I feel like I&#x27;m using more product but it&#x27;s all about preference. You can also use them for blending eyeshadows. The bigger face brushes also are lacking in density but they do the job and for the price you can&#x27;t beat it!</li>
    <li> I received these makeup brushes and was very pleased with the packaging. They were shipped will and the plastic over all the brushes kept them clean and sanitary. The carrying/storage cask is also wonderful for keeping the brushes clean in my makeup bag. The instructional insert was very helpful as it labeled all of the brushes and gave a brief description as to what each was meant for. My only complaint it that after using them for the first time a lot of the bristles began to fall off or stick to my face while applying makeup. I am not sure if this is just from getting bumped around during shipping. Hopefully the loose bristles will all come out and this wont be an issue from here on out.</li>
    <li> It arrived on time. It did have a smell, but like always when your purchase something you wash it.  After washing, the smell went away. It does its work, by applying and shooting out makeup evenly.</li>
    <li> I have bought several makeup brushes sets in the past and this one by far was the worst. The bag had a very strong smell of chemicals and plastic which made me think the brushes were not even safe to use. I returned this item.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brushes did look good but I wouldn&#x27;t use them. I tried to leave them opened for a couple of days and the odor was very strong still. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product. I always think that having a good set of brushes is a must and tried to buy this set to try but was highly disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this item with a discount for my honest review.</li>
    <li> I love these brushes. My make up comes out flawless!!!</li>
    <li> Upon receiving these brushes I was very excited to see what a cute package they came in. The brush holder is adorable! However I realized there is a very strong smell associated with the brushes and carrier.&lt;br /&gt;I washed the brushes, and these brushes are so thick and dense that it took me forever to rice the soap out, so make sure you are very cautious about rinsing the soap out. IA also washed the package.&lt;br /&gt;I used the brushes later that evening, and they made a huge difference in my makeup application, especially foundation. I am very pleased and would purchased these again.&lt;br /&gt;I would be hesitant to send as a gift however because of the plastic smell. So I would wash them before giving a gift</li>
    <li> These brushes are super soft and easy to blend with. They didn&#x27;t have the cheap plastic smell that most brushes that cost this cheap have. I like the eye ones the best because they blend effortlessly. I am in love with them.</li>
    <li> I love these brushes. They are a must have for every woman. They are super soft and adorable.</li>
    <li> They are firm brushes which I like!</li>
    <li> I can not stress this enough!  I LOVE THESE BRUSHES!  Immediately when I opened the package I started falling inlove.  The clutch they come in is amazing.  It is white and gold! It is very soft and feels very durable.  It would be awesome for traveling or everyday storage. I purchased the white set.  They look so expensive! The handle is solid and they are very well made.  Initially the clutch has a slight smell.  It faded away.  The brushes did not have a smell.  I washed the brushes as I would any other brush before using them.  No brush hair fell out during washing.  They are super soft.  I can not explain. They almost seem like velvet.  They feel so &amp;#34;high end!&amp;#34;  I absolutely love the variety of big brushes. I love them all.  My favorite is the flat top brush. It is amazing at applying foundation. It was flawless.  I used them for applying powder, bronzer, blush and I was so impressed.  I definitely like the smaller brushes also.  To me they are larger then I like for shadow. However I really liked using them for concealer, highlight, contouring, and setting my under eye powder.  After several days of usage not one brush hair has fallen out!  These are my everyday go to brushes!</li>
    <li> So many to choose from! Glad they give you a guideline for what brushes work where... Nice product.</li>
    <li> Love these brushes, they&#x27;re so soft and the packaging is beautiful!  The picture guide is kind of hard to read though if you&#x27;re already familiar with make up brushes.</li>
    <li> Great brushes for the price!!</li>
    <li> I was skeptical about this set at first, I thought that they would fall apart like other inexpensive sets I have had. But I was so wrong! When I opened the package and looked at them, I was shocked at how pretty they are. They are also so soft and we&#x27;ll made. Each brush is soft and dense (but not too dense, just right). They work beautifully!&lt;br /&gt;I have been considering buying a more expensive set (like MAC, it cosmetics, or Sigma), and I&#x27;m so glad I didnt! These are by far my favorite brushes I have tried. So save your money and buy these! They are lovely, and you won&#x27;t be disappointed. :)</li>
    <li> My first thoughts on these brushes were obviously the packaging - it blew me away! They&#x27;re incredibly beautiful, and look so stunning. There was a slight plastic-y smell coming from the brushes, but it wasn&#x27;t overwhelming, and faded quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as the brushes themselves, they are honestly so soft, and they work amazingly. They blend foundation into the skin sooo well: in fact, it almost looks airbrushed. Since they are synthetic, they work really well with both cream, and powder products! I have many other synthetic brushes similar to these from other companies, such as BH Cosmetics, SixPlus, and Sigma - and these hit the mark with my expectations from all of those brands! (Yes, even Sigma!!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The nice thing about this set is that there is a very big variety of essential brushes, and they are all very unique. Though they are similar to other brushes out there, the bristles themselves are very short, dense, and soft. I really don&#x27;t have anything else like these in my collection!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another plus - I only experienced shedding with these brushes when I very first pulled them out of the package. Now, that may not be an issue for everyone; but being a professional makeup artist, it&#x27;s important to have tools that won&#x27;t leave fibers on your client&#x27;s face! So with that being said, yes, I would definitely recommend these to any makeup artists, makeup enthusiasts, or even just someone who wears makeup frequently!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re looking for amazing, luxurious brushes without spending an arm and a leg, look no further! These are fantastic!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[These brushes were sent to me for review purposes - though that does not effect my opinion whatsoever.]</li>
    <li> I think these are great. the face brushes (big ones) are comparable to the sigma collection. the eye brushes (small) are a little stiff, but they will probably get softer with more use. they are by no means rough, very soft just feel new. the pouch is really cute as well. I gave 4 stars because I think the set could use some smaller eye shadow brushes and a spoolie. but I will buy another set so I have back ups. no hairs falling out and perfect density. I am in love.</li>
    <li> I received these brushes this morning, and all I can say is WOW! These brushes are incredible! Very comparable to my favorite MAC and Sigma brushes, but at a fraction of the price! Very soft bristles, blends color well, and they are so dense! I am absolutely in love! I may end up reaching for these brushes more than my high end ones! The brushes comes in a beautiful travel case, and include an instructon pamphlet. Perfect for someone new to makeup brushes that needs a little guidance, I highly highly recommend.</li>
    <li> First impression: this brush set exceeded my expectations in that they are silky smooth and appear well made.  After some tugging, the brush heads don&#x27;t appear to shed and the metal ferrule seems securely attached to the handle.  I expected a stiff plastic case but was pleasantly surprised.  The case is nice.  The foil print on the case has a slick feel and the trim/interior has a buttery soft &amp;#34;pleather&amp;#34; feel.  I ordered the white brushes and overall, they&#x27;re pretty.  The gold leans a bit copper and the black logo printed on the white handles is a bit stark (a gold logo would have been better suited, IMO) but I am happy with the choice considering the white case.  The set does have a strong smell (remember opening baby dolls as a kid? that smell, on steroids) but honestly it already seems to be fading.  Overall, a 5 star first impression!  I&#x27;ll try to update this review after use.</li>
    <li> I actually bought these brushes based on the reviews, and to my surprise they have turned out pretty good. I use them to blend my cream contouring and my primer and bb, I like that they are very soft and leave no trace of the streaks. The small brushes are great for the fine lines and for applying eyeshadows and blending. No brush for the eyebrows though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far i have used them for almost a month, washed them once and they have held up just fine. Im pretty happy, and wasn&#x27;t really expecting it for that price.</li>
