      <li>I love it!</li>
      <li>A couple of years ago I did a fruit acid peeling at a doctor&#x27;s office with an amazing result.</li>
      <li>i have never written a review in my life but felt compelled to share this amazing find with everyone.  </li>
      <li>Tighter Pores, Clearer skin, a nice glow.</li>
      <li>It is very easy to use.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product since Avon introduced it, and the best way to use it is between seeing a cosmetologist for a professional peel.  </li>
      <li>I bought this facial peel because I&#x27;d heard wonderful things about them</li>
      <li>The packaging made it looked more $$$ than just $30</li>
      <li>but like this better - it seems to work better</li>

      <li>This product keeps you skin glowing and smooth!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used many, many face products.  </li>
      <li>my boss using the product now, and they all love it.  </li>
      <li>but my skin does look smoother and looks better after using it.</li>
      <li>I was very excited about the purchase and followed the directions by the book.</li>
      <li>at first i loved it</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve noticed my skin becoming smoother and more evenly toned...and that&#x27;s saying a lot for my skin.  </li>
      <li>I spend a fortune on products that claim to be great and just don&#x27;t live up to their claims.  </li>
      <li>This product is easy to use, it works well, and is inexpensive compared to competing products.</li>
      <li>I can already tell a huge difference in my skin.</li>
      <li>After just one week, I can see a huge difference in the appearance of my skin.  </li>
      <li>I have been using the Avon Anew Facial Peel for about two weeks with great results.  </li>
      <li>Leave on for five minutes, then follow with the smooth side of the pad for step 2.  </li>
      <li>You can get a free trial and see for yourself here:   awesomestufffree.com/dermastep</li>
      <li>Sure would have been nice if this product actually did what it says it does.</li>
      <li>Some people say they can tell a difference after the first use, but I couldn&#x27;t tell until the second use (which I thought was great).  </li>
      <li>I will let everyone know how it goes after a few more applications, but so far I am very impressed!</li>
      <li>(I have never previously gone a week without a pimple of some kind).  </li>
      <li>The product is easy to use and doesn&#x27;t tingle too much at all.  </li>
      <li>so now that they are actually gone, you can bet I will be buying more of this stuff from my Avon Lady!</li>
      <li>am sure glad I listened to the other reviewers and tried this product.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used it in the mornings before applying makeup and my makeup goes on very easily and my face looks much brighter and natural.  </li>
      <li>five minutes later you clean it with the smooth side of the pad from the #2 jar.</li>
      <li>My pores seem smaller and my skin seems more luminous.</li>
      <li>I used this product for the first time this morning.</li>
      <li>My face actually looks better without foundation than with it.  </li>
      <li>I just used this for the first time today.</li>
      <li>First of all, I am not an Avon fan.  </li>
      <li>my skin is pretty well behaved.  </li>
      <li>The first step, use the textured side of the pad for Step 1.  </li>
      <li>I had tried all kinds of skin care systems, with different levels of success, but in the end, the Derma Step system works the best, with long lasting results.</li>
      <li>Woke up one the third day and looked in the mirror could not deny, I&#x27;m a skeptic by nature, that I looked better.  </li>
      <li>Overall, four stars only because it comes in two jars and takes up a good bit of space in the cabinet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>This product works fast, I saw results after the first use.  </li>
      <li>and most importantly, it has helped decrease the severity of the acne red marks that have been left over the years.</li>
      <li>I am not sure if my skin was resistant or if its isn&#x27;t a good product</li>
      <li>Its so easy (a big plus for skin slackers like me) and</li>
      <li>I purchased this product for occasional acne and primarily for large clogged pores.</li>
      <li>I have been using this product for 2 weeks now and have noticed a real improvement in my skin.  </li>
      <li>and i don&#x27;t see much of a difference.  </li>
      <li>My skin is much softer and alot of the sun damage has disappeared.  </li>
      <li>It does what it says and really improved the look and feel of my skin.   </li>
      <li>and you too will be as impressed as I was, especially after endless unfulfilled beauty promises from other products.  </li>
      <li>I would buy this product again but I am trying to save so that I can afford to get a facial and hopefully would see some significant improvement in my skin.</li>
      <li>I would highly recommend this product.</li>
      <li>but since i am always willing to try a new product, i found the other reviews of this product genuine enough to give it a try.</li>
      <li>The tone of my skin looks better and the lines on my face seem less apparent.</li>
      <li>as a 28 year old woman, i have lived with acne and oily skin for over 14 years.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve had glycolic peels done with a facial with fantastic results, and although this doesn&#x27;t give quite the same results it still makes a big difference in my skin.  </li>
      <li>Because of the refining/exfoliating power of this product, you really need to wear additional sunscreen to prevent further damage.</li>
      <li>however is very fair skinned and has delicate skin, it actually burned and stayed red for a few days.</li>
      <li>CLINICAL 2-Step Facial Peel (read reviews above for directions)and didn&#x27;t want to write a review until I knew the results were for real.   </li>
      <li>You use it every other day -- first an application with the bumpy side of the towelette from the #1 jar and</li>
      <li>My small lines are the same, my pores don&#x27;t seem any smaller, and most of all the 4 brown spot i have on the side of my cheeks are still there and don&#x27;t seem to have changed at all.  </li>
      <li>Too bad, would have been a great opportunity.</li>
      <li>in the past spent much more for their line and noticed no difference.</li>
      <li>/&gt;this product has not only cleared up my skin better than every expensive and inexpensive product i have ever tried, but it has completely changed the texture of my skin.</li>
      <li>I also liked that I can use it every other day, in the morning or before bed, I&#x27;m not great with structured routines.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I bought this facial peel because I&#x27;d heard wonderful things about them and I didn&#x27;t want to spend a ton of money on some of the other brands I price checked.  I am really impressed with the results that I got after just the first application.  My skin was softer and smoother.  I also liked that I can use it every other day, in the morning or before bed, I&#x27;m not great with structured routines.  I&#x27;ve used it in the mornings before applying makeup and my makeup goes on very easily and my face looks much brighter and natural.  I would highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> A couple of years ago I did a fruit acid peeling at a doctor&#x27;s office with an amazing result. Therefore, I ordered this product to try at home. I&#x27;m using it already for quite some weeks, but I cannot see or feel a difference. Too bad, would have been a great opportunity.</li>
    <li> I have been using the Avon Anew Facial Peel for about two weeks with great results.  It removed an ugly skin tag I had in less than a week.  It is also clearing up my skin making it look flawless.  I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> This product is easy to use, it works well, and is inexpensive compared to competing products. Overall, four stars only because it comes in two jars and takes up a good bit of space in the cabinet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can&#x27;t go wrong with the money-back satisfaction guarantee, though I doubt you&#x27;ll need it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommended.</li>
    <li> I bought this product and maybe from all the reviews i had read expected some sort of a miracle product.  Well, it has been over a month now that i have been diligently using this product as per the directions and i don&#x27;t see much of a difference.  My small lines are the same, my pores don&#x27;t seem any smaller, and most of all the 4 brown spot i have on the side of my cheeks are still there and don&#x27;t seem to have changed at all.  I will continue on using this product till the end of its content, but i don&#x27;t believe i will be bying it again.</li>
    <li> I like this product. You use it every other day -- first an application with the bumpy side of the towelette from the #1 jar and five minutes later you clean it with the smooth side of the pad from the #2 jar. I see a difference in my skin. My pores seem smaller and my skin seems more luminous. I recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m still confused where those reviews came from. After I read all the reviews on Amazon, I bought this product. But it is the worst one I&#x27;ve ever used. My skin didn&#x27;t have any improvement. My face had red spots every day. After I threw two bottles away, I still have to face those spots(they turned to brown)every day. It is a nightmare for me!</li>
    <li> I am a skincare guru - Always looking for the next best thing.  I spend a fortune on products that claim to be great and just don&#x27;t live up to their claims.  First of all, I am not an Avon fan.  I have tried numerous Avon products, and I have never really taken to them, or they&#x27;ve never taken to me.  Either way, I decided to give this product a try because of the rave reviews I have read, both on Amazon and in magazines.  I ordered this product from Amazon, and it arrived immediately at my doorstep (shipping is awesome)!  It arrived in very nice packaging.  The packaging made it looked more $$$ than just $30 (I think that is a good price for this product). &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;To use: You follow directions on the box.  The first step, use the textured side of the pad for Step 1.  Leave on for five minutes, then follow with the smooth side of the pad for step 2.  Really Simple.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Results:  I&#x27;ve been using this 2 step facial peel for 1 month every other day.  I&#x27;ve noticed my skin becoming smoother and more evenly toned...and that&#x27;s saying a lot for my skin.  I&#x27;ve noticed that my skin is less oily and shiny towards the end of the day.   I also have not had one single breakout since using this product.  I also feel good about going out for the day with no makeup on....now THAT&#x27;S saying a lot for this product.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I am very impressed with this Avon product.  It does what it says and really improved the look and feel of my skin.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I am sure glad I listened to the other reviewers and tried this product.  5 stars!</li>
    <li> I just used this for the first time today. It is very easy to use. You use one prepared pad for the treatment, leave it for 5 minutes and then use another prepared pad from the step 2 jar.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;My skin looks better after one treatment. The tone of my skin looks better and the lines on my face seem less apparent. I have used the Loreal treatment but like this better - it seems to work better and it is easier to use.</li>
    <li> My girl  bought this cause her friends used it and it worked Great ! (on them)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She however is very fair skinned and has delicate skin, it actually burned and stayed red for a few days. It also made it dried out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Again , like I said her friends had nothing but praise for the results they got from this product.</li>
    <li> I used this product for the first time this morning. I can already tell a huge difference in my skin. I will let everyone know how it goes after a few more applications, but so far I am very impressed!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for 2 weeks now and have noticed a real improvement in my skin.  My skin is much softer and alot of the sun damage has disappeared.  A lot less freckles and such....The product is easy to use and doesn&#x27;t tingle too much at all.  I will continue to use this product as part of my skin care routine...I love it!</li>
    <li> not so great. at first i loved it but then i realized it wasn&#x27;t that great.  can&#x27;t change the rating though it is stuck on 5.......</li>
    <li> I have just finished up my supply of Avon ANEW CLINICAL 2-Step Facial Peel (read reviews above for directions)and didn&#x27;t want to write a review until I knew the results were for real.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Throughout my teen years, I have developed small little skin \\&quot;bumps\\&quot; on my upper cheecks and forehead (what the dermatologist calls \\&quot;blocked oil glands\\&quot;).  These aren&#x27;t red or pimples, they&#x27;re just bumps that are the same color as my skin.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Anyway, I&#x27;ve had these for years, but after using the Avon ANEW CLINICAL 2-Step Facial Peel,  they have all but disappeared!  I&#x27;ve tried everything to get rid of them, so now that they are actually gone, you can bet I will be buying more of this stuff from my Avon Lady! &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The peel has also helped to even out my skin tone.  After continued use, the stinging (see above reviews) goes away and you can&#x27;t even feel it at all.</li>
    <li> as a 28 year old woman, i have lived with acne and oily skin for over 14 years. i have tried every product and treatment that exists. from acutane, oral antibotics, laser peel treatments, topical creams, to over the counter medications, nothing has helped the way this simple product has. i have never written a review in my life but felt compelled to share this amazing find with everyone.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;this product has not only cleared up my skin better than every expensive and inexpensive product i have ever tried, but it has completely changed the texture of my skin. and most importantly, it has helped decrease the severity of the acne red marks that have been left over the years. i have tried every product that others have sworn will work, but those with acne and skin problems know that what works for some, wont always work for you. but since i am always willing to try a new product, i found the other reviews of this product genuine enough to give it a try. and i am soo happy i did. now, it may not work forever (i tend to become \\&quot;immune\\&quot; to products after lengthy use) but even if it is temporary, i am sold! i dont know what&#x27;s in this product but it&#x27;s working...</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m almost 45 and people think my skin is much younger.  I&#x27;ve had glycolic peels done with a facial with fantastic results, and although this doesn&#x27;t give quite the same results it still makes a big difference in my skin.  I&#x27;ve been using this product since Avon introduced it, and the best way to use it is between seeing a cosmetologist for a professional peel.  This product keeps you skin glowing and smooth!</li>
    <li> Tighter Pores, Clearer skin, a nice glow. Been using for 2 weeks. Bravo Avon, I&#x27;m in shock it worked so well</li>
    <li> After using this product I saw no improvement in my skin at all. Keep your money.</li>
    <li> This is a good product. Don&#x27;t expect drastic results but my skin does look smoother and looks better after using it. I would buy this product again but I am trying to save so that I can afford to get a facial and hopefully would see some significant improvement in my skin.</li>
    <li> This product works fast, I saw results after the first use.  Not only does it help to lift the buildup of dead skin, but it also helps to loosen sebaceous buildup, thereby minimizing blackheads and eventual breakouts.  It has even helped to superficially lighten some hyperpigmentation on my upper lip.  I have my husband, his son, and my boss using the product now, and they all love it.  Because of the refining/exfoliating power of this product, you really need to wear additional sunscreen to prevent further damage.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product for occasional acne and primarily for large clogged pores. I was very excited about the purchase and followed the directions by the book. I have been doing the steps religiously for almost 2 months and still see absolutely NO changes.  I am very disappointed with the AVON 2-step product and was expecting sooo much more, especially with all the positive expert reviews. Sure would have been nice if this product actually did what it says it does. Wished I would of just saved my money. &lt;br /&gt;</li>
    <li> I have never before tried any Avon products, but after the great reviews, I thought, what the heck.  I have oily, acne prone skin, and nothing -- I mean nothing -- has gotten rid of everything the way I wished.  I use proactiv, but it doesn&#x27;t seem to eliminate all the bumps, so I&#x27;ve tried in addition the Neutrogena facial peel and microdermabrasion with so-so results.  THIS product beats everything!!!  Its so easy (a big plus for skin slackers like me) and the results have been wonderful.  I have not had a single breakout since I started to use this product.  (I have never previously gone a week without a pimple of some kind).  I also now look good under awful work-office flourescent lights!  NO ONE looks good under fluorescent lights!  Bottom line:  I&#x27;m plugging avon because they made a great product that delivers -- give it a shot and you too will be as impressed as I was, especially after endless unfulfilled beauty promises from other products.  Buy it!</li>
    <li> After just 1 use, my skin looks smoother and clearer.  I never expect skin care product to work as advertised.  But this one changes my mind.</li>
    <li> Recieved this product incredibly promptly.  I could notice a difference within just a couple days of use.  I also brought the anew cleanser and the moisturizer.  Woke up one the third day and looked in the mirror could not deny, I&#x27;m a skeptic by nature, that I looked better.  I have tried mary kay in the past spent much more for their line and noticed no difference.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used many, many face products.  I&#x27;m 19,and my skin is pretty well behaved.  I get zits when I&#x27;m stressed.  My pores are visible, I have blackheads in my T-zone, and my face can get a little oily.  I never leave my house without make-up.  Some people say they can tell a difference after the first use, but I couldn&#x27;t tell until the second use (which I thought was great).  After just one week, I can see a huge difference in the appearance of my skin.  I had a zit when I started, and it almost instantly went away.  I have not had a zit since I started it, and I haven&#x27;t been wearing any foundation.  My face actually looks better without foundation than with it.  I love how my skin glows.  I&#x27;ve already bought this product for all my best friends, and I&#x27;ve stocked up for me!  This is the best face product I&#x27;ve ever used, and I cannot believe it is so affordable.  A++</li>
    <li> I am not sure if my skin was resistant or if its isn&#x27;t a good product</li>
    <li> I had tried all kinds of skin care systems, with different levels of success, but in the end, the Derma Step system works the best, with long lasting results. You can get a free trial and see for yourself here:   awesomestufffree.com/dermastep</li>
