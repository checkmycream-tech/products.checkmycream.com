      <li>It makes you spell good.</li>
      <li>Now for the pruduct (the right product) it is the best AP/Deodorant out there.</li>

      <li>Love</li>
      <li>I love this stuff.</li>
      <li>I like the solids more, I never feel fully dry with this kind of deodorant</li>
      <li>One of my favorite scents from Old Spice.</li>
      <li>So if you&#x27;re looking to try a new scent and already like Original, give this a try.  </li>
      <li>Used the first time 4/13/15.</li>

      <li>I seek this particular brand and scent out every time now.  </li>
      <li>He is sensitive to many other deodorants, but this one doesn&#x27;t cause him to break out.</li>
      <li>I do like the old spice</li>
      <li>Having said that this product directly caused chemical burns that hurt a lot and took a while to heal once I stopped use of this product.</li>
      <li>I orderd 10 (2 separate orders) of the Old Spice ANTI-PERSPIRANT &amp; DEODORANT only to get OLD SPICE Deodorant (not anti-perspirant AND deodorant).  </li>
      <li>I was hesitant to buy deodorant online without being familiar with the scent, but I&#x27;m too lazy to go to the store</li>
      <li>This Old Spice Product should not be sold to the public.</li>

    <li> Goes on well, lasts all day and like the smell.</li>
    <li> i love the smell of the deodorant but it seems to only last 6-8 hours. while im used to 12-24 hour protection of other brands.</li>
    <li> I really enjoyed the smell of the Fiji scent. Having said that this product directly caused chemical burns that hurt a lot and took a while to heal once I stopped use of this product. I have since switch to Dove Mens+ Care and could not be happier. I was told that Dove Mens+ Care does not have the ingredient that causes the the chemical burns. This Old Spice Product should not be sold to the public.</li>
    <li> Was very disappointed to receive Anti-Perspirant and not Deodorant as advertised</li>
    <li> I like the solids more, I never feel fully dry with this kind of deodorant but it&#x27;s a preference maybe for some. I do like the old spice but I&#x27;ll stick to the powder / dry.</li>
    <li> My husband uses this and loves it.  We both like the scent and he prefers deodorant alone (vs. antiperspirant and deodorant), so this is a great fit for him.  He has been using Old Spice and found he likes this scent and the Original.  So if you&#x27;re looking to try a new scent and already like Original, give this a try.  This is on our Subscription list so he never runs out.</li>

    <li> I orderd 10 (2 separate orders) of the Old Spice ANTI-PERSPIRANT &amp; DEODORANT only to get OLD SPICE Deodorant (not anti-perspirant AND deodorant).  Now I have to ship back, very irritating.  This is what happened to me last November (2011) also (I was lucky my local Kmart allowed me to exchange even thou I bought it thru Amazon).  This is so frustrating.  Now for the pruduct (the right product) it is the best AP/Deodorant out there.</li>
    <li> Really like this line of products.</li>
    <li> This is my go-to deodorant. I love the Fiji scent. I tried the white, &amp;#34;invisible solid&amp;#34; variety and didn&#x27;t like how that one felt or how it left residue on my shirt. No such problems with this one.</li>
    <li> The scent is strong enough to cover up any bad smells. I put it on daily and have had no issues.</li>
    <li> Love the smell&lt;br /&gt;I bought it for my husband and I use it too</li>
    <li> I was hesitant to buy deodorant online without being familiar with the scent, but I&#x27;m too lazy to go to the store and I gave it a shot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love it.  Best Old Spice I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
    <li> Used the first time 4/13/15. So far no armpit gremlins have begun, like crazy itching or rash :)</li>
    <li> It makes you spell good.</li>
    <li> Nice new scent at a value size- a double bonus.</li>
    <li> One of my favorite scents from Old Spice. My husband smells great! He is sensitive to many other deodorants, but this one doesn&#x27;t cause him to break out.</li>
    <li> Great price. My teens love this deodorant and scent. Like the two pack...one for home and one for the backpack.</li>
