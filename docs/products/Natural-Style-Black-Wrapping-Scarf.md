      <li>This scarf is definitely good quality for cheap.</li>

      <li>and it does not escape far beyond the scarf which is wonderful.</li>

      <li>I really love this product and it came on time,</li>
      <li>Love this for the shower -so</li>
      <li>I found another scarf on Amazon that was better for a couple dollars more.</li>
      <li>I guess I need more practice.</li>
      <li>Love this.</li>
      <li>and I love how my hair retains its moisture all night.</li>
      <li>so can&#x27;t say which is better.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll def buy some more of these</li>
      <li>If you are thinking about wearing this outdoors for fashion like you can with MOST wraps, don&#x27;&#x27;t.</li>
      <li>This scarf helps me keep my hair nice and smooth.</li>
      <li>I had to buy another one love love</li>
      <li>I suppose it was okay,</li>
      <li>bought it for my Daugher and it was ok.</li>
      <li>This wrap offers the best coverage, is silky smooth yet doesn&#x27;t slide off.</li>
      <li>I can only assume why manufacturer provides no instructions on the best WAY to tie it securely.</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s still going strong.</li>
      <li>It feels comfortable and its not bad for the price, plus its a lot better than wearing a bandanna around my head.</li>
      <li>it works fine but does not stay on while sleeping.</li>
      <li>does not work on fine hair</li>
      <li>That&#x27;s a good thing because I am a very wild sleeper.</li>
      <li>I used the side that was directed  to use in the package against your hair, wrapped it as securely as I could, and it still never stayed on.</li>
      <li>free</li>
      <li>My daughter wear&#x27;s her hair in twists and this protects the style and keeps our edges smooth.</li>
      <li>Also, it&#x27;s much, much longer than I had anticipated (5 feet) which leaves a lot of material to manipulate into some kind of knot.  </li>
      <li>Love it, first time using it got a weave the other day and it works great, wont dry it out and it stays in place its the best one I found yet.</li>
      <li>and you&#x27;re golden!</li>
      <li>I find that it is okay for my first couple days of wearing it.</li>
      <li>I am so excited.</li>
      <li>You are able to wash this if you feel like there is too much product on it</li>
      <li>Leaves hair full and no breakage whatsoever.</li>
      <li>I really wanted a satin wrap for my hair to protect it from the friction of my cotton pillow, and I was glad to see that this one was designed to stay-on over night.</li>
      <li>It stays on very well &amp; has held up well after many washes.</li>
      <li>This lovely satin cap makes my night time routine much shorter</li>
      <li>I loved this my daughter borrowed it and it never came back</li>
      <li>I love the rectangle shape for when I have my hair straightened into a pony tail or high afro puff.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this product :)</li>
      <li>Came on time, and I love it so far!!</li>
      <li>Just wish they had a variety of colors to fit my moods ;)</li>
      <li>Thanks again!!</li>
      <li>I got it today and was excited at first.</li>
      <li>I really enjoy this product and recommend it to anyone who wants this</li>
      <li>Found it at Wal-Mart for 2.50 and so far I love it.</li>
      <li>Perfect for laying down those edges before you head out of the house and overall hair protection.</li>
      <li>Yes, it  does have a soft  and satiny material as described,and i am pleased it does not have that static factor, like what i have experienced with other scarfs i have worn and i am all for less breakage when it comes to my hair.</li>
      <li>My hair has gotten bigger and my bonnett seems to have gotten smaller lol.</li>
      <li>Feels soft and does what it says, I just wish it didn&#x27;t slip off so easily at night.</li>
      <li>And unless you&#x27;re a reaaally wild sleeper or if you didnt wrap it good enough, it will stay on all night.</li>
      <li>Also I would have loved a little instruction on how to put it on correctly so it doesn&#x27;t come off at night.</li>
      <li>this scarf feels exactly like my satin pillow.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried many different brands</li>
      <li>I have had this scarf for many years and it looks the same way it did when I first purchased it.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I have a 2 year old and i purchased this head tie to protect her hair so I don&#x27;t have to style it in the morning. It doesn&#x27;t stay on her head nor mine!</li>
    <li> Great product! Stays on all night wish is a huge plus, plus my hair has been shedding less! Not sure if it&#x27;s due to this, but I&#x27;m sure it helps!</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t really used it yet but I have tried it on and it fits just as I expected it would. I will use it soon and write another review but overall it is what I expected.</li>
    <li> Love the coverage, wish there was a how-to though. I use a scrunchy to hold it onto my long hair.</li>
    <li> Great scarf. doesn&#x27;t slip off my head and good for travelling when I don&#x27;t have my satin pillow cases.</li>
    <li> Works well.  Wish it was larger in size.</li>
    <li> The head scarf does not stay on my head at night. I would not purchase this again.</li>
    <li> Just what I was looking for</li>
    <li> This works very well for me. I do not have any worries when I sleep in it.</li>
    <li> This scarf keeps my hair wrapped ,in place through the night.</li>
    <li> This does not stay on. Even trying to pin it in place. I suggest you do not waste your money.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t really work for me.</li>
    <li> For some reason I thought this was like a firm wrap because of the picture on the packaging which would have worked for keeping wrapped hair in place but it&#x27;s an ordinary satin scarf. I&#x27;m keeping it though.</li>
    <li> does not work on fine hair</li>
    <li> it works fine but does not stay on while sleeping.</li>
    <li> Finally a wrap that does not slip off easily.</li>
    <li> Loved this satin head scarf. Perfect for practically anyone! I&#x27;m currently natural so when adding oils and other hydrating and nourishing products to my hair it doesn&#x27;t transfer onto my pillows because this satin scarf helps to hold the oils and it does not escape far beyond the scarf which is wonderful. Had this for a few months and it&#x27;s still going strong. You are able to wash this if you feel like there is too much product on it and it will maintain that satiny soft feel and shine. Perfect for laying down those edges before you head out of the house and overall hair protection.</li>
    <li> fits great and stays on, love it. I am natural and its hard to find wrapping scarfs for my hair but this works great</li>
    <li> This is not supposed to move on your head, I have used it once and does ride up a little just like a regular scarf does.</li>
    <li> This lovely satin cap makes my night time routine much shorter and I love how my hair retains its moisture all night. My hair is so soft in the morning! I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I suppose it was okay, I didn&#x27;t get a chance to use it. My granddaughter put it on and I have not seen it since. She said she loves it.</li>
    <li> It was just as expected. Great price and quality. Would definitely buy it again. Shipping was fast too.</li>
    <li> This stayes on my wife&#x27;s head with no problem night after night.  it is the best head wrap she owns and will use this over anyother one.</li>
    <li> This is all I use now, along with the satin cap from the company. If you&#x27;re head is large or you have tons of hair, you would get the satin cap along with this, and your hair will look perfect every time you unwrap it. No need for silk pillows or anything. Love this.</li>
    <li> Very soft and I can definitely see a change.</li>
    <li> Just what I expected, fast delivery!</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t stay on my head properly.</li>
    <li> I have had this scarf for many years and it looks the same way it did when I first purchased it. I see that someone mentioned that it wasn&#x27;t sold in stores. Well, it is actually sold in many beauty supply stores and stores like Target and WalMart. Also, you&#x27;re not supposed to wear the scarf on the satin side, you&#x27;re supposed to wear it on the soft side. The soft side is where the oils are! I highly recommend this product :)</li>
    <li> My hairdresser suggested I sleep on a satin pillow or warp my hair.. I decided to wrap my hair and this scarf kept falling off.  I have tried tying it in several different  ways and I just cannot get it to stay on.  I don&#x27;t like it.</li>
    <li> I love it! It stays in place while sleeping. That&#x27;s a good thing because I am a very wild sleeper.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been looking at this for a while but couldn&#x27;t justify the price. Found it at Wal-Mart for 2.50 and so far I love it. The color is horrific though. For the cheap price I also bought the other similar product in black, haven&#x27;t tried the other yet so can&#x27;t say which is better. The fabric is cheap thin on both products but it gets the job done and it is a cheap price too so no complaints here! Just hope I don&#x27;t get any surprise visitors bc it is ugly lol it is NOT the emerald green on the picture nor is the fabric as thick.</li>
    <li> this is an ok Item but not worth the wait. It took so long to get here i forgot i ordered it and went and bought one at Sallys.&lt;br /&gt;I bought it for my Daugher and it was ok. I would not recommend to buy from this seller. The shipping is crazy long. I placed two different orders and they both got here before this particular item. The product is ok at best.</li>
    <li> It protects the hair without the mess not like other hair wraps. It slides onto the pillow while you sleep.</li>
    <li> This scarf was an amazing find, and has made taking care of my hair a better experience. I bought this scarf since I have yet to get myself a satin pillowcase, and it was a good buy indeed! The scarf has built in anti-breakage conditioner, so it helps to retain moisture while you sleep. Due to the anti-breakage conditioner however, it is recommended that you don&#x27;t wash it so that you won&#x27;t accidently wash the product out. Also, on the packaging, it is recommended that you change this scarf every two months, but it really only depends on how much you use it.</li>
    <li> So far it has not actually stayed on my head. Haven&#x27;t been using it. It&#x27;s way longer than I need and just keeps slipping off. Disappointing.</li>
    <li> Ever since I purchased this satin scarf I have seen a difference in my hair as well as keeping every thing in tact.</li>
    <li> It is difficult to tell which is the silky side and which is the soft side. Also I would have loved a little instruction on how to put it on correctly so it doesn&#x27;t come off at night. For those more experienced with this sort of thing it probably works great.</li>
    <li> This product is horrible, it doesn&#x27;t fit well and runs off your head! Don&#x27;t waste your money in this product.</li>
    <li> Love this for the shower -so my dreads don&#x27;t become all wet, and conditioned-when i don&#x27;t want them too..! Fast service!</li>
    <li> Its great to wear during the day whenever I need it, but it does not stay on at night. I was looking for something that I could wear to bed since I toss a lot in my sleep. It feels comfortable and its not bad for the price, plus its a lot better than wearing a bandanna around my head. I actually bought a turban to wear to bed and it stays on all night, so I may just use that for sleeping.</li>
    <li> LOVED THIS SCARF IT WORKS WELL IN KEEPING THE MOISTURE IN THE HAIR AS WELL AS STAYING PUT. I GIVE THIS SCARF A TUMBS UP BUT THE ONLY DRAW BACK IS IF YOU ARE MOISTURIZING THE HAIR WITH AN OILY MOISTURIZER THAN YOU SHOULD USE ANOTHER SCRAF BECAUSE THE OIL WILL STICK TO THE SATIN MATERIAL AND IT WILL RUB OFF ONTO YOUR PILLOW CASE BUT AGAIN IT DOES KEEP THE MOISTURE IN THE HAIR.</li>
    <li> A very good satin scarf. I couldnt find one like this is the stores. My hair has gotten bigger and my bonnett seems to have gotten smaller lol. so this is a good alternative. just wrap it up the way you want to. And unless you&#x27;re a reaaally wild sleeper or if you didnt wrap it good enough, it will stay on all night.</li>
    <li> This scarf is definitely good quality for cheap. It stays on all night and is long enough to wrap around.</li>
    <li> i&#x27;ve had tons of head scarves before i bought the Stay On satin scarf. although they claimed to be made of satin, but after purchasing this scarf, i see that they were telling a lie. this scarf feels exactly like my satin pillow. it actually stays on my head when i&#x27;m asleep, unlike all the other ones. you just have to be careful with wrapping your hair because the edges, which is made of thread, will pull at your hair if you get your hair caught while tying it.</li>
    <li> I go back and forth with my hair between flat-ironing, wearing my hair natural, and twists/braids. Yes, I go to you tube for all kinds of helpful hints. A young lady was demonstrating how she kept her flat-ironed hair straight for a few days without flat-ironing it every day by wrapping her hair with a wrapping scarf. Of course I&#x27;ve seen these around but never knew how to use it effectively until that demo!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Came to Amazon to find one. CBS Express had the best deal, EXCELLENT service and it got here in a few days. It is everything I hoped for and does well. The wrapping scarf is for my straight styles. I also purchased a large scarf for my braids/twists styles from them too. I&#x27;m a happy camper!</li>
    <li> The material is soft, but not the best quality. I had a lot of trouble trying to wrap my head. I guess I need more practice. I didn&#x27;t see much difference when comparing both sides. It stated one side goes on the head, but both sides looked the same.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s alright. Feels soft and does what it says, I just wish it didn&#x27;t slip off so easily at night.</li>
    <li> I always use satin scarves to wrap my hair at night because it feels so much healthier (not dry and brittle) when I wake up.  I&#x27;ve tried many different brands but I&#x27;d usually end up with them falling of or I&#x27;d just take it off before I woke up.  This one does not have that problem and works equally as well.  ...and I got a good deal.  I&#x27;ll def buy some more of these so there is no big emergency when I misplace one.  Just wish they had a variety of colors to fit my moods ;)</li>
    <li> I really love this product and it came on time, when I use this at night it does not slide off during the night and it keeps my hair lint free I really enjoy this product and recommend it to anyone who wants this</li>
    <li> I just recently did my BC and was worried about my hair breaking at night due to it&#x27;s new natural short length. My regular sleep scarf wasn&#x27;t staying on. I ordered this one and my scarf never falls off anymore. Leaves hair full and no breakage whatsoever. Pair with a satin pillowcase and you&#x27;re golden!</li>
    <li> Description says &amp;#34;easy to tie&amp;#34;.  Yes, you can tie it but it doesn&#x27;t stay on! I&#x27;ve tried several ways. I can only assume why manufacturer provides no instructions on the best WAY to tie it securely. Also, it&#x27;s much, much longer than I had anticipated (5 feet) which leaves a lot of material to manipulate into some kind of knot.  The description only says that the scarf is &amp;#34;large&amp;#34;. I&#x27;ll probably end up tossing it..</li>
    <li> This scarf is pretty comfortable and it does stay on all night if you wrap and tie it tight enough. Not bulky, but sleek and soft. I recommend this product, but like other reviews, I wish it came in different colors.</li>
    <li> I love this! It shipped really fast. When I opened it the scarf was purple and not black. I wrote them and they shipped a black one out to me ASAP. Thanks again!!</li>
    <li> Material is great, when I use it. I have yet not to find a way how to wrap this thing without my girlfriend lol.</li>
    <li> I loved this my daughter borrowed it and it never came back I had to buy another one love love</li>
    <li> One of the reasons I don&#x27;t like head wraps is because they never fit well and the slide off during the night. I decided to try this one after reading the product description. This wrap offers the best coverage, is silky smooth yet doesn&#x27;t slide off. I will buy several more.</li>
    <li> I ordered this for my toddler daughter&#x27;s dry, curly hair, during naptime &amp; bedtime. It stays on very well &amp; has held up well after many washes.</li>
    <li> We have no idea how to use this thing. No directions provided.</li>
    <li> This was so large that I could wear it as a scarf around my neck not as a hair wrap.  I was very disappointed</li>
    <li> Keeps my wife&#x27;s hair intact when sleeping</li>
    <li> Love it, first time using it got a weave the other day and it works great, wont dry it out and it stays in place its the best one I found yet.</li>
    <li> The product is poor quality! Sheer as pantyhose. The stitching is stringy. If you are thinking about wearing this outdoors for fashion like you can with MOST wraps, don&#x27;&#x27;t. It looks more tacky and CHEAPER than other wraps I have had. I complained to the seller and he/she was a complete a-hole. After I pay for packaging, shipping, and tracking. There is the cost of the product!!! I&#x27;M PISSED</li>
    <li> Bought this for my brother to try to tame his hair while he sleeps because he is growing it out and seems to do the trick.</li>
    <li> I use it every night when in bed.  Keeps my hair from falling out.  Machine wash it with no change in its texture.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t stay put a night, but I am using it on my three year old who stirs quite a bit.</li>
    <li> Perfect tie for putting my hair up when going to the gym! The material will not damage your hair. I ordered two after recently losing one that I had for about two years now.</li>
    <li> It wraps my hair perfectly. Keeps in the moisture</li>
    <li> Great head wrap, ideal for people with curly natural hair. I use it mostly to wrap my hair in the &amp;#34;pineapple&amp;#34;, and it stays on, and does not slip off durign the night.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve purchased a number of scarves and have found that this is the best one.  I get migraines so it was difficult to find a scarf that would stay on without having to tie it really tight.  With this one I do not have to tie it too tight because of the different textures on each side.  The size is great as well.</li>
    <li> I can tell within one week that this is working, My hair is not breaking off at all. I am so excited. I have been using bandanas (doo rags) for a while and it would just dry my hair out. I moisturize my hair and put my silk satin wrap on and when I take it off in the morning my hair is soft and looks alive.</li>
    <li> I used this for wrapping my hair before bead and i also wear it out with different outfits ,one problem is that it tends to give me a headache</li>
    <li> I love the rectangle shape for when I have my hair straightened into a pony tail or high afro puff.</li>
    <li> This wrap worked. It came on time and stayed on the entire night. Be careful about u tie it. I I tied it too tight and almost had a headache.</li>
    <li> I really wanted a satin wrap for my hair to protect it from the friction of my cotton pillow, and I was glad to see that this one was designed to stay-on over night. I was a bit dissapointed to find out it doesn&#x27;t. I used the side that was directed  to use in the package against your hair, wrapped it as securely as I could, and it still never stayed on.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a normal satin head scarf. It slips off my head at night...I expected something different.</li>
    <li> Very effective for warp styles and keeping hair in place when doign my housework or when goign to sleep at night.  Retains moisture well.</li>
    <li> I use this for bed and also use it as a headband  during the day.  It is great both ways.</li>
    <li> Just as advertised. Stays on at night and is very comfortable.</li>
    <li> These satin caps are perfect for keeping the hair intact overnight or anytime.  The smoothness of the satin makes any hairdo&lt;br /&gt;look good, even after lying on it.  There is plenty of ways to adjust it and it washes very well.  I ordered several after my first one, and now my hair stays in place.</li>
    <li> Originally the picture was pink and I thought i was getting a pink rap. itw as balacka nd I was disappointed, I noyice now they have changed the photo on the package to black, I have read other review where people thought they were getting a pink wrap. this seems like false advertiseing.</li>
    <li> Came on time, and I love it so far!!</li>
    <li> This is so weird lol. I got it today and was excited at first. I like how it looks on but unfortunately this thing does not stay put. I was going to use it overnight as a hair scarf but it doesn&#x27;t even stay lol.</li>
    <li> This scarf helps me keep my hair nice and smooth. It fits perfectly and doesn&#x27;t fall off during the night like others. Great buy!</li>
    <li> Hey this scarf did not stay in place at night. I guess because it&#x27;s affordable that&#x27;s why it did not work for me.</li>
    <li> Not as soft as I was hoping for with this wrap. It will fall off if you don&#x27;t wrap it well enough but so does any silk/satin scarf. I just think the stitch pattern makes it a bit too rough to use on my hair. I found another scarf on Amazon that was better for a couple dollars more.</li>
    <li> Fast delivery. Great material as described. A KEEPER!!</li>
    <li> Definitely stays on all night.</li>
    <li> I find that it is okay for my first couple days of wearing it.Yes, it  does have a soft  and satiny material as described,and i am pleased it does not have that static factor, like what i have experienced with other scarfs i have worn and i am all for less breakage when it comes to my hair.Yet,One thing the reviews are right about is,it sometimes does not stay on through the night which i am not completely happy about.I just may have to sleep in a position where it will likely stay on.</li>
    <li> I purchased 2 of these one for me and one for my daughter. The size is perfect. My daughter wear&#x27;s her hair in twists and this protects the style and keeps our edges smooth. I like that its not hot at night. I noticed there was a little unravelling at the edges but it still works great.</li>
