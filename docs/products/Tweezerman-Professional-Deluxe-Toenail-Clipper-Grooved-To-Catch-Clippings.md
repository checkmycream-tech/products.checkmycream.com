### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>These are great clippers!  </li>
      <li>Great product.</li>
      <li>Great product.</li>
      <li>The clippings catch works fairly well.</li>
      <li>Good quality.</li>
      <li>Great product, service was outstanding (received 3 days after placing order).  </li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t get over how easy these toenail clippers are to use ... so easy to maneuver and clip!!!  </li>
      <li>My son also as a pair  of his own.</li>
      <li>He loves the design too because he&#x27;s a tidy person.&lt;br</li>
      <li>to say, I&#x27;m pretty happy.</li>
      <li>Love these clippers.</li>
      <li>I bought these, and I love &#x27;em.</li>
      <li>Much better to use than the fingernail clippers.</li>
      <li>Satisfied with product.</li>
      <li>I am so glad I bought the Tweezerman.</li>
      <li>Just the thing I needed, I just love them.  </li>
      <li>Also, it does not catch the clippings which is ok with me since I never had one that did.  </li>
      <li>Nice and sharp, and the angle is perfect.</li>
      <li>Easy grip</li>
      <li>Also each clip of the nail leaves the nail clean cut, ie; no filling needed to smooth the nail after the trim.</li>
      <li>They have a better angle though it&#x27;s still easy to clip straight across.</li>
      <li>Good leverage, so cut big nails without having to have a lot of strength.</li>
      <li>it works better on toenails but be very carful on your fingers.</li>
      <li>This one makes it so easy I was literally amazed the first time I used it.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s easy to grip, too, which is a real plus.  </li>
      <li>They are perfect since they are made for cutting toenails, they cut my fingernails so easily!</li>
      <li>Highly recommend!!!</li>
      <li>Definitely worth the extra dollars!! :)</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;ve had one of those old cheap nail chrome clippers for 25 years.&lt;br</li>
      <li>As I don&#x27;t cut my nails straight.</li>
      <li>Thanks</li>
      <li>also prefer a curved blade rather than a straight blade.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Works better than expected and has a life-time guarantee.&lt;br /&gt;Got</li>
      <li>Frankly it could not catch the clippings very well at all.</li>
      <li>The Tweezerman does the job better than any  other clipper I have ever used.  </li>
      <li>I was looking for an older version.</li>
      <li>Price too high for what it does.</li>
      <li>Very sharp and easy to use.  </li>
      <li>had left my original clippers up north and wanted a back up pair for the future.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>They stay sharp and last for many years.</li>
      <li>Knife sharp and large enough to fit in a guys hand.&lt;br</li>
      <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s super sharp.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been looking all over for straight across ones, and only could find these.</li>
      <li>Not only did these replace them, the exceeded them far!</li>
      <li>Really sharp and cuts really well.  </li>
      <li>It works on thickened nails very well because there&#x27;s enough space between the blades, and the blades are sharp.</li>
      <li>My impression is that the metal isn&#x27;t of a high enough quality to take and keep a sharp edge --or to be of &amp;#34;Professional&amp;#34; quality.</li>

<li> I little pricey though.</li>
<li> The clipper&#x27;s cutting edges are relatively &amp;#34;blunt&amp;#34; and require excessive force (relative to other clippers I&#x27;ve had) to clip nails.</li>
<li> Just a few months agoI bought  the comparable Clyppi; it is no match for the Tweezerman.  </li>
<li> Typical Tweezerman excellence!</li>
<li> I have thick toenails, and my previous clipper seemed to take a lot of effort to use.</li>
<li> Not sure if I would buy the slant edge again.  </li>
<li> My husband had some first, so I knew what to expect and wasn&#x27;t disappointed.</li>
<li> These are very heavy duty clippers.</li>
<li> Got these for my dad, since his nail clippings are dangerous and gross on the floor!</li>
<li> and you see exactly what you&#x27;re cutting with the help of the slanted cutting edge.</li>
<li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve always hated them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

    <li> Typical Tweezerman excellence!</li>
    <li> The design has flaws. It is mean to catch clippings but has two big holes on either side when you clip. Frankly it could not catch the clippings very well at all. I regret my purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also prefer a curved blade rather than a straight blade. As I don&#x27;t cut my nails straight. But this part is my personal preference.</li>
    <li> After four years using Tweezerman&#x27;s previous model, the blades were no longer sharp. Toenails will do that. I bought these, and I love &#x27;em. They have a better angle though it&#x27;s still easy to clip straight across. The angle is needed to clip at the corners so that you won&#x27;t get ingrown nails. I also like that they put these in a removable cover (the black part). Well, I don&#x27;t care that it&#x27;s removable: I care that the cover gives some bulk, makes it easier to hold and handle, and prevents slipping like the all metal clippers that are out there.</li>
    <li> Got these for my dad, since his nail clippings are dangerous and gross on the floor! He loves the design too because he&#x27;s a tidy person.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought a second pair for my granddad!</li>
    <li> As a male, I don&#x27;t get my nails done at a salon and I&#x27;ve had one of those old cheap nail chrome clippers for 25 years.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve always hated them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I gave this a shot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s super sharp. Knife sharp and large enough to fit in a guys hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Works better than expected and has a life-time guarantee.&lt;br /&gt;Got to say, I&#x27;m pretty happy.</li>
    <li> I was looking for an older version. Price too high for what it does. it works better on toenails but be very carful on your fingers.</li>

It works on thickened nails very well because there&#x27;s enough space between the blades, and the blades are sharp. It&#x27;s easy to grip, too, which is a real plus.  I am so glad I bought the Tweezerman.</li>
    <li> Satisfied with product.</li>
    <li> I got these to replace a German made pair of clippers I lost. Not only did these replace them, the exceeded them far! These clip nails with ease, catches 90&#x27;ish% of the nails. Also each clip of the nail leaves the nail clean cut, ie; no filling needed to smooth the nail after the trim. Hope this helps someone. Highly recommend!!!</li>
    <li> Great product, service was outstanding (received 3 days after placing order).  Thanks</li>
    <li> I am a manicurist by trade and these are the only clippers I use. Easy grip and you see exactly what you&#x27;re cutting with the help of the slanted cutting edge. They stay sharp and last for many years. Great product.</li>
    <li> Just the thing I needed, I just love them.  My son also as a pair  of his own.</li>
    <li> Not what I was looking for. I wanted a fingernail clipper not a toenail clipper.</li>
    <li> I purchased these for myself.  This was a purchase of a second one I had made&lt;br /&gt;many years ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had left my original clippers up north and wanted a back up pair for the future.&lt;br /&gt;I was disappointed that the new one didn&#x27;t work as well as the new one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disappointed with purchase.</li>
    <li> These are very heavy duty clippers. I&#x27;ve been looking all over for straight across ones, and only could find these. They are perfect since they are made for cutting toenails, they cut my fingernails so easily!</li>
    <li> Used it a few times now and can&#x27;t really complain. Good quality. I little pricey though.</li>
    <li> I have thick toenails, and my previous clipper seemed to take a lot of effort to use. This one makes it so easy I was literally amazed the first time I used it. Nice and sharp, and the angle is perfect.</li>
    <li> Love these clippers. Use them for fingernails, too. Good leverage, so cut big nails without having to have a lot of strength. Great product.</li>
    <li> Finally, the sense has come back to nail clipper designers. Don&#x27;t wait, buy them now.</li>
    <li> My impression is that the metal isn&#x27;t of a high enough quality to take and keep a sharp edge --or to be of &amp;#34;Professional&amp;#34; quality. The clipper&#x27;s cutting edges are relatively &amp;#34;blunt&amp;#34; and require excessive force (relative to other clippers I&#x27;ve had) to clip nails. The clippings catch works fairly well.</li>
    <li> Really sharp and cuts really well.  Not sure if I would buy the slant edge again.  It a little harder to use.  Also, it does not catch the clippings which is ok with me since I never had one that did.  Much better to use than the fingernail clippers.</li>
    <li> These are great clippers!  Very sharp and easy to use.  My husband had some first, so I knew what to expect and wasn&#x27;t disappointed.</li>
