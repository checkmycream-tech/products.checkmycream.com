      <li>It seem to me this trimmer use to sharper and cut much better.</li>
      <li>I have bought and used many makes and models through the years.</li>

      <li>It is safe and compact.</li>
      <li>Make this available in the USA!</li>
      <li>I was very excited to find that I could get one through Amazon.  </li>
      <li>So happy to see the very same product was still available!</li>
      <li>I tried others but they were not as strong in removing hair.</li>
      <li>Good had one of the older ones finely wore it out</li>
      <li>Very happy and bought another just in case I can&#x27;t get another down the road.</li>
      <li>It is nice and beautiful little buddy&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>B0049LUI9O Panasonic ER-GN30-K]] which works fine</li>
      <li>A replacement has not been available until now.</li>
      <li>It is easy to clean and change batteries.</li>
      <li>It is 3-4 times more powerful than the rest and easier to use.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve battled the nose hair (ant legs) for many many years-- until now nothing worked very well.</li>
      <li>The blade guard design along with the blade type do not lend a very close or effective trim even in easily accessible areas.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried numerous trimmers, and this is the best so far.  </li>
      <li>it.&lt;br /&gt;It clean my nose hair</li>
      <li>This thing is cool.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve had 2 neither which have lasted a full year.</li>
      <li>Most don&#x27;t last more than 2 years</li>
      <li>I had a Remington for a few years which worked great, but after it died, figured I would try this product.</li>
      <li>I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it to anyone and am returning to using my old, busted trimmer since it does a better job than this one.</li>
      <li>Well worth the money.</li>
      <li>Seems to be of fairly high quality and easily washable.</li>
      <li>I had one previously and loved it.</li>
      <li>Funny thing..</li>
      <li>Better than the earlier model I was using from Panasonic</li>
      <li>Much better than the flat shaped one I bought to replace it.</li>
      <li>While it is working it&#x27;s pretty darn good for it&#x27;s small and compact design</li>
      <li>Purchased this based off others online reviews (99% positive).  </li>
      <li>This is far superior to any other trimmer.</li>
      <li>As advertised, the trimmer works very well.</li>
      <li>Thanks again so much.</li>
      <li>The rotary blade is much than a linear reciprocating blade.  </li>
      <li>My original purchase finally gave up the ghost.</li>
      <li>Works much better than my previous Remmington trimmer.</li>
      <li>so there is an issue with this particular model.</li>
      <li>but again, if it&#x27;s only going to last 8 or 10 months I&#x27;m going for something more substantial.</li>
      <li>Takes one double a battery which is convenient; its powerful too...</li>
      <li>This unit is simple and economical; it does the job every time.</li>
      <li>Other trimmers that I have tried  seem cheap by comparison.</li>
      <li>Can&#x27;t live without this trimmer</li>
      <li>My previous one lasted over 10 years and the new replacement takes care of removing all of my ear and nose hair easily.</li>
      <li>both times this has failed was just before a function I really needed to look good for.</li>
      <li>Now back on the market, I purchased and am finally able to get a deep trim that actually cuts rather than push hairs away.</li>
      <li>I bought with other items and later realized shipping cost MORE than the shaver.</li>
      <li>Hard to find these any more.</li>
      <li>I purchased my old one when Longs Drugs was still around</li>
      <li>It still doesn&#x27;t get everything, but I guess you need a professional tool for that.  </li>
      <li>my wife profound it on Amazon .This</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not good with pointy scissors and things.. :)</li>
      <li>It was exactly what I expected.  </li>
      <li>Like the little extra perk (light torch) that came with it.</li>
      <li>I stood in front of my mirror (with old trimmer) and chased a nose hair for some time and finally got the scissors out...  </li>
      <li>This device was certainly more expensive than other devices but worth the money.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> It cuts my nose hairs, although not as short as I&#x27;d like. Hopefully it will last a long while considering the price I paid. Seems to be of fairly high quality and easily washable.</li>
    <li> This is an exceptional nose hair trimmer!&lt;br /&gt;Very happy it was still available!</li>
    <li> Good. It&#x27;s a little rough to use first but as you get used to it , it does the job. Like the little extra perk (light torch) that came with it.</li>
    <li> I\\&quot;m quite disappointed with the performance of this nose hair trimmer which does not seem to trim any hair. I also have a [[ASIN:B0049LUI9O Panasonic ER-GN30-K]] which works fine so there is an issue with this particular model. Not sure about the positive reviews.</li>
    <li> This unit is simple and economical; it does the job every time. One battery lasts a long time and the unit cleans under the running water faucet. None of these are perfect but this one comes close.</li>
    <li> As advertised, the trimmer works very well. My husband has had one of these for several years and it continues to do its job. I assume mine will do the same. It is easy to clean and change batteries.</li>
    <li> It seems to work very good. Other trimmers that I have tried  seem cheap by comparison. 👍</li>
    <li> Very good product, quick delivery</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve battled the nose hair (ant legs) for many many years-- until now nothing worked very well. This one did! Very happy and bought another just in case I can&#x27;t get another down the road. Panasonic! Make this available in the USA!</li>
    <li> have been looking in stores for several years for this same product. I had one previously and loved it. The ones in th stores have blade on the side and this one fits in your nose without any trouble. Does the job great. Does not pinch,pull nip,etc. .Wonderful product.So happy to have found it. Thanks again so much. Wouldn&#x27;t be without it.&lt;br /&gt;..</li>
    <li> Excellent tool for men or women!</li>
    <li> I bought this same product maybe 20 to 25 years ago for my husband. It finally gave out so I ordered two more! So happy to see the very same product was still available!</li>
    <li> Good had one of the older ones finely wore it out</li>
    <li> This is a great device.  The rotary blade is much than a linear reciprocating blade.  I bought this as a replacement to a similar Panasonic model.  This had an improved power switch.  This device was certainly more expensive than other devices but worth the money.</li>
    <li> Excellent. Better than the earlier model I was using from Panasonic</li>
    <li> I brought this trimmer long time ago. When it finally broke down after five year I tried to buy the same one but could not find it .until my wife profound it on Amazon .This trimmer works so well it does not pull on the hair and trim you hair perfectly so when your done you can breathe through you nose . Can&#x27;t live without this trimmer hope the company keeps making it</li>
    <li> Works much better than my previous Remmington trimmer. This one actually cuts the air in one swipe instead of twisting and turning to get the righ angle so that the hair gets into the channels and hits the blade. I&#x27;ve very happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> It seem to me this trimmer use to sharper and cut much better. Maybe it&#x27;s me, or maybe is it&#x27;s been a very long time I haven&#x27;t used this trimmer, I had given up trying find it, tried others but, I must say without a doubt this is best I have ever had.</li>
    <li> I cant give this a good review. I&#x27;ve had 2 neither which have lasted a full year. While it is working it&#x27;s pretty darn good for it&#x27;s small and compact design but again, if it&#x27;s only going to last 8 or 10 months I&#x27;m going for something more substantial. Funny thing.. both times this has failed was just before a function I really needed to look good for. I&#x27;m not risking that again. I&#x27;m not good with pointy scissors and things.. :)</li>
    <li> This is my second Panasonic trimmer to replace the same model that I have had used for 12 years! This trimmer simply works well period!</li>
    <li> Just as we ordered. No complaints.</li>
    <li> This product has been around for some time. My previous one lasted over 10 years and the new replacement takes care of removing all of my ear and nose hair easily. I tried others but they were not as strong in removing hair.</li>
    <li> Not worth the money..does not cut at all !</li>
    <li> I have bought and used many makes and models through the years. This one is by far the best. It is 3-4 times more powerful than the rest and easier to use. How long it will last is still to be determined. Most don&#x27;t last more than 2 years</li>
    <li> Purchased this based off others online reviews (99% positive).  I&#x27;m sorry to say it did not meet my expectations.  The blade guard design along with the blade type do not lend a very close or effective trim even in easily accessible areas.  Along with a sub-par cut the open design of the blade guard/shield poses the threat of nicking other skin while you trim.  Perhaps previous model didn&#x27;t have this change but this one, unfortunately, did.  I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it to anyone and am returning to using my old, busted trimmer since it does a better job than this one.</li>
    <li> Best nose trimmer in the world.</li>
    <li> This is the greatest trimmer we ever had.</li>
    <li> I had purchased one of these a number of years ago and it just quit after many years of usage.  I was disappointed that when I went to get a replacement, that it was extremely hard to find.  I didn&#x27;t like the current styles that were on the market.  I was very excited to find that I could get one through Amazon.  It was exactly what I expected.  I am very happy to have found this style again and very pleased with the results that I get using it.  Well worth the money.</li>
    <li> This thing is cool. Ordered on a Friday night and got it Saturday morning. Takes one double a battery which is convenient; its powerful too...like a little weed whacker for your nose. Packaging looks like it&#x27;s from the 80&#x27;s, might be a vintage model...love it.</li>
    <li> Great trimmer, I had this model years ago and its the best I&#x27;ll ever use. I purchased my old one when Longs Drugs was still around and the they were purchased by some other chain which stopped carrying the Panasonic brand and I tried everything else but Panasonic is still the best it cuts exceptionally well and easy to clean and maintain. A great buy.</li>
    <li> I decided to buy this after reading the great reviews. I had a Remington for a few years which worked great, but after it died, figured I would try this product. DO NOT BUY THIS. This does nothing but move the hairs around and occasionally pulls them out. This trimmer does not work.I will look into returning, but due to postage, probably does not make sense.&lt;br /&gt;I would stay away from this unit.</li>
    <li> the trimmer work good</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my husband, very good quality and he loves it. great for travel too. I would recommend this product to family, friends or anyone who wanted a recommendation for this trimmer</li>
    <li> Much better than the flat shaped one I bought to replace it.</li>
    <li> Of all the nose and ear trimmers on the market, I prefer this one the most.</li>
    <li> Only gift my son requested. Easy to use and fits nicely in his hand. Beware of shipping cost. I bought with other items and later realized shipping cost MORE than the shaver.</li>
    <li> Does a great job. My boyfirend loves this.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried numerous trimmers, and this is the best so far.  It still doesn&#x27;t get everything, but I guess you need a professional tool for that.  Good for the price.</li>
    <li> Husband is happy with this.</li>
    <li> This is the perfect trimmer. It is safe and compact. I am loving it.</li>
    <li> Hard to find these any more. I bought two and they work.</li>
    <li> This is far superior to any other trimmer. I had one of these for 10 years before I dropped it. A replacement has not been available until now. In the meantime, I have used others, much more expensive. None hold a candle to the Panasonic. Now back on the market, I purchased and am finally able to get a deep trim that actually cuts rather than push hairs away. Buy 2, so you&#x27;ll have a spare when you drop it.</li>
    <li> Works well.  Sometimes no frills is the best way.</li>
    <li> Easily the best trimmer I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
    <li> Best there ever will be period.  These trimmers just keep on working and cut the best of all the others.  I promise.</li>
    <li> I have tried many different nose hair trimmers with the results of doing a very poor job of removing hair. This is the only one that removes hair from the nose and ears compleatly. I saw a complaint from someone who said it didn&#x27;t cut his hair. I bet he put the battery in backwards.</li>
    <li> It is nice and beautiful little buddy&lt;br /&gt;I like it.&lt;br /&gt;It clean my nose hair</li>
    <li> This trimmer works so well!!!  Nose hair ear hair are all gone!!!  I have another trimmer that was much different from this one...  I stood in front of my mirror (with old trimmer) and chased a nose hair for some time and finally got the scissors out...  this trimmer is perfect for the job...  5 stars from me!!!</li>
    <li> Great price,first one i had lasted 20 years</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used one of these for 23 years. My original purchase finally gave up the ghost. If this one does as well I&#x27;ll be pleased.</li>
    <li> Quality&#x27;s gone down on this model. The newer Panasonics are much better.</li>
