      <li>Goodbye, Mitchum, after many many years.</li>

      <li>My favorite deodorant.</li>
      <li>the odor protection is better.</li>
      <li>Have been using Mitchum Anti-Perspirant and Deodorant Roll on for many years.  </li>
      <li>Glad to be able to find it online.</li>
      <li>I threw most of these away, in the end.</li>
      <li>love it..</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know if I am imagining but the 4 pack that I received seems \\&quot;fresher\\&quot; and works better than the store bought singles.</li>
      <li>Mitchum is my favorite deodorant.</li>
      <li>The pack of 4 is better since I don&#x27;t have to worry about searching for it in the stores.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using different deodorants but find this to be the best which is also available in the supermarket sometimes.</li>
      <li>While it may be true that ladies glow, men perspire and horses sweat, I sweat!</li>
      <li>This product isn&#x27;t easy to find and I am so thankful you have it.</li>
      <li>The deodorant rolls on easily and dries very quickly.</li>
      <li>dog still give kisses.&lt;br /&gt;Seems to work just fine.</li>
      <li>Mitchum is by far superior to the close to 10 products I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
      <li>First and most important-</li>
      <li>Even after significant scrubbing, I still don&#x27;t feel clean.    </li>
      <li>It is nice buying it through Amazon because we get a pack of them rather than having to go to the store and search for them every time she needs a new one.</li>
      <li>And it&#x27;s also alot of work in the shower to clean each morning.  </li>
      <li>To be honest, it&#x27;s the only thing worthwhile my father ever taught me.  </li>
      <li>you can skip a day,&amp;#34; because this is true.  </li>
      <li>I liked the old unisex unscented roll -on, now it says Men&#x27;s.</li>
      <li>Good value if you buy this deodorant on a regular basis.</li>
      <li>Well, that&#x27;s not strictly true.</li>
      <li>The product works great for me, I recommend it for those who lead a rather active lifestyle, with a pH</li>
      <li>After being a loyal Mitchum customer for 4 decades I&#x27;m leaving the Mitchum fan club.</li>
      <li>Product arrived quickly.</li>
      <li>This particular item by Mitchum is effective but gentle on the skin.</li>
      <li>Mitchum is a pretty fair price, only about 5 bucks for one container.</li>
      <li>Hard to find a good roll on since most manufactures have seemed to discontinue them.</li>
      <li>I have used ladies Mitcham  roll-on deodorant - Powder Fresh for years and never had a problem till now.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a product that&#x27;s worth spending money for.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve had success applying both at night or in the morning.</li>
      <li>I could trust it to keep me fresh smelling</li>
      <li>The old power gel is much better.</li>
      <li>The roll on is very nice for her and few companies still make it.  </li>
      <li>Exactly what I was looking for.  </li>
      <li>;-)  </li>
      <li>Thanks!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I have been using Mitchum since I was an adolescent (30 years) and everything the previous reviewers have said is absolutely true,  I would repeat their comments; tried other inferior anti-perspirants.., keeps you dry..., etc.</li>
    <li> I have used the Mitchum brand since 1983, after I moved to the Eastern U.S. and found out how useless most deodorants are in high-humidity conditions. Mitchum was the only product I found that worked.    It is regrettable that Mitchum chose to change the active ingredient. Perhaps they changed it several times since 1983, but the most recent change came to my attention when a new container left my armpits raw after 2 or 3 uses.    I hadn&#x27;t thrown the old container out, so I compared labels. I can do so again now for you because I have hung onto that old container, as well as the unusable newer one. Whence,  OLD ACTIVE INGREDIENT:  Aluminum Zirconium Tetrachlorohydrex Gly 20%  NEW ACTIVE INGREDIENT:  Aluminum Sesquichlorohydrate 25%    Now I am unable to use either the roll-on or gel Mitchum products.  Thanks, Mitchum, for taking a perfect product and ruining it.</li>
    <li> That&#x27;s what you hear in rural New England. And I imagine, in many other places. Unfortunately, too many \\&quot;middle manager\\&quot; types (or perhaps chemical engineers) have to justify their positions by changing products that already work. I can&#x27;t know exactly what happened with Mitchum; it&#x27;s just a reasonable guess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thus the old formula that worked so well for me is no longer. The new does not work. Well, that&#x27;s not strictly true. It works for a while but not for several days like it used to. I concur with other reviewers who are unhappy with this more recent formulation, and thank them for observing the chemical change and reporting which brands still work, Secret and Gillette Clinical Strength, both of which have Aluminum Zirconium Tetrachlorohydrex Gly 20%, Mitchum&#x27;s former ingredient. Wasted my dollars on this last purchase. &#x27;Fraid I gotta jump ship. Goodbye, Mitchum, after many many years.</li>
    <li> Wow --------the shipping was great..... The product is a larger one then what I have,.  Great deal</li>
    <li> The 48 hr new formula litereally stinks. It is stiky. Dont fix what is not broken. Will find another product.</li>
    <li> Sprays and solid roll-ons seem to cause me irritation and other problems. Hard to find a good roll on since most manufactures have seemed to discontinue them.</li>
    <li> Why did they change the formula.  It has a horrible stinky smell and DOESN&#x27;T WORK.  Mitchum has lost me as a customer.</li>
    <li> This...actually works. It doesn&#x27;t really keep me all that dry, but it does kill body odor without adding any other scent, i.e. I still sweat, but it doesn&#x27;t stink.&lt;br /&gt;It works better if you let it dry, but the odor control works even if you&#x27;re sloppy about it.&lt;br /&gt;- Make sure you put it on before you get sweaty at all, as it won&#x27;t eliminate or mask any BO you already have;&lt;br /&gt;- You really need to shave your armpits for this to work well.</li>
    <li> works as described.  buy it.</li>
    <li> Mitchum Roll On has been the choice of no nonsense men and women for some 30 years. Much to my dismay, I&#x27;ve not seen it in stores here in the Midwest for several months. That&#x27;s why when I saw it advertised on Amazon, I purchased a whole box of 12. My wife and I both like the lasting power and lack of fragrance. I don&#x27;t think that there was ever a deodorant as good as Mitchum Roll-On, and I hope it will continue to be available on Amazon.</li>
    <li> The newer OXYGEN formula is runny, sticky &amp; does not dry. UNACCEPTABLE. The old power gel is much better.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Mitchum roll on since the early 80&#x27;s. It no longer works..l don&#x27;t know what changed,but l won&#x27;t buy anymore..</li>
    <li> I have always had difficulty finding a deodorant that lasts all day. I&#x27;ve use this for years. It works.  It doesn&#x27;t stain your clothes and I choose the one that doesn&#x27;t have a sense.</li>
    <li> I have been  using Mitchum Anti-Perspirant &amp; Deodorant since I was a teenager.  I am now 74 years old.  It not longer provides the protection it has in the past.  It doesn&#x27;t even last through the day.  Please return to the old ingredients.</li>
    <li> Good value if you buy this deodorant on a regular basis. I like it and feel this is a great deal.</li>
    <li> Great product, quick ship.</li>
    <li> Choosing anti-perspirant is a personal matter. I find Mitchum does the job, I like the roll-on container, and I prefer unscented deodorant.  &#x27;Nuff said.</li>
    <li> My sister has issues with range of motion and cannot properly use regular deodorant.  The roll on is very nice for her and few companies still make it.  The Mitchum has worked well for her for years and I hope they continue to make it.  It is nice buying it through Amazon because we get a pack of them rather than having to go to the store and search for them every time she needs a new one.</li>
    <li> I find it harder to find this product in stores so ordering it on Amazon was very helpful and convenient. The product works great for me, I recommend it for those who lead a rather active lifestyle, with a pH that isn&#x27;t over bearing.</li>
    <li> I have used Mitchum for longer than I care to remember, lasts for ages and is effective. I bought another a few weeks ago in a local store as the current one was running low. I opened it up yesterday but it refuses to roll, in another words it is stuck!! It is currently upside down in the basin of water in my bathroom in the hope that the water on the outer side and the ingredients on the inside will loosen. If not I have wasted my money. x :(&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well it&#x27;s a few hours later and a little brute force and it is now rollin !! lol All&#x27;s good</li>
    <li> Husband doesn&#x27;t like anything scented.  We can find the unscented  around St. Louis at the stores we use.  Glad to be able to find it online.</li>
    <li> I threw most of these away, in the end. I am used to the gel applicator for this brand and I thought the liquid would be similar. It is not. It stings my underarms, it takes a while to dry, and then my underarms feel really sandy and dry, and it makes me really uncomfortable. I tried to get used to it but I couldn&#x27;t!</li>
    <li> I have used more deodorants on the market than I care to remember because of my excessive perspiration. My doctor even wrote a prescription for my pharmacist to compound a deodorant/antiperspirant saying that was the best solution available. It didn&#x27;t work nearly as well as the Mitchum Anti-Perspirant &amp; Deodorant!! This is the only one that ever kept me dry! I have used it exclusively for many, many years now. I like the unscented best because I don&#x27;t care much for a multitude of fragrances, but the scented version is nice too. The deodorant rolls on easily and dries very quickly. As I&#x27;ve aged I&#x27;ve gone from needing to use it daily to needing to use it only every other day! A nice perk! If you have a difficult perspiration problem, this is definitely worth the try. If not, this is just a great overall product and you shouldn&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
    <li> I have used ladies Mitcham  roll-on deodorant - Powder Fresh for years and never had a problem till now.  They have changed the formula and it made me sneeze so bad and a splitting headache.  Washed off and symptons vanished. I had to throw it in bin.  Will never use again.  Well done Mitcham  for wrecking a good product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Mitchum since I began using deodorant as a kid.  To be honest, it&#x27;s the only thing worthwhile my father ever taught me.  I wish they would bring back the old promise, &amp;#34;so effective you can skip a day,&amp;#34; because this is true.  Anytime I&#x27;ve forgotten to apply Mitchum I can&#x27;t even tell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The roll on is slightly messier than the gel as it creates a residue (on the container and under your arms).  I stick with the gel at home and use the roll on for travel because it never makes a mess in my suitcase (the gel does).</li>
    <li> Have used Mitchum for years..love it..wouldn&#x27;t use anything else.  Packaging was perfection.  Very satisfied</li>
    <li> This is great deoderent it controls armpit odors and you don&#x27;t go everywhere smelling like a sweaty flower bed. Ha!!!!</li>
    <li> I HAVE USED THIS PRODUCT FOR YEARS AND HAVE ALWAYS BOUGHT IT AT THE DRUG STORE.  WHEN I NEEDED IT AGAIN I DECIDED TO CHECK AMAZON.  I GOT FOUR BOTTLES FOR EVEN LESS THAN WHAT I WOULD PAY FOR TWO.  GOOD PRODUCT AND AFFORDABLE THROUGH AMAZON</li>
    <li> Not sure when it happened, but they definitely made a formula change.  I noticed it when I started using a bottle that had an \\&quot;Odorguard\\&quot; sticker on the cap.  Two big problems: First and most important- it&#x27;s not unscented.  There&#x27;s a definite smell as soon as you put it on and it stays all day. Second- it&#x27;s awfully sticky.  I only do one swipe up and one swipe down and I find my armpit hairs pulling sometimes during the day.  And it&#x27;s also alot of work in the shower to clean each morning.  Even after significant scrubbing, I still don&#x27;t feel clean.    Because of the new scent especially, I will be trying a new product(s).</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using different deodorants but find this to be the best which is also available in the supermarket sometimes.</li>
    <li> At a spectacular price. This is the best protection out there. No brainer on where I will be purchasing it from for years to come.</li>
    <li> I have used the product for over 20 years. They must have changed the formula. Because it sucks !!! It&#x27;s sticky and it takes forever to dry. Don&#x27;t waste your time.</li>
    <li> Following the recommendation from The Journal of Clinical and Aesthetic Dermatology Antiperspirant and Deodorant Allergy article (URL if they let it through: http://goo.gl/EgDgOw).  Mitchum has been the easiest to find solution for under-arm skin irritation that I&#x27;ve had for about 6 years, preventing me from using any antiperspirants, only deodorants.  The only complaint that I have is that the roller gap is just barely large enough to catch on my pit hairs every now and then.</li>
    <li> Great price. This is the only deodorant that my husband will use and it is getting impossible to find it in our small town.</li>
    <li> For some reason I have not been able to find this brand locally (Honolulu.) I&#x27;ve used it for years and I was really bummed. Low and behold I found Mitchum on Amazon.  Now I&#x27;m happy again and got a good deal to boot.</li>
    <li> seems to stain, feels slimey</li>
    <li> Mitchum is the best as far as my family is concerned and the price on this can&#x27;t be beat!!! I bought two batches!!!</li>
    <li> I HAVE USED this product for years. I could trust it to keep me fresh smelling no matter the temperature or the activity.  Lately I have had some trouble finding it on the shelves for some reason. I was indeed happy to find this opportunity to buy a good supply</li>
    <li> Apparently there was a change to the formula?...  If so, I can&#x27;t tell the difference.&lt;br /&gt;The husband still shares the bed with me.&lt;br /&gt;Friends still hug me.&lt;br /&gt;The dog still give kisses.&lt;br /&gt;Seems to work just fine.</li>
    <li> Like many other reviews here, I, too, have been a Mitchum user for years, but will be looking for another product. The original rollon kept me dry for days. This new formula, leaves your armpits clammy in hot weather. Gross!</li>
    <li> This is a product that is truly scent-free. Doesn&#x27;t trigger my allergies. Rolls on clear; no powder stains on clothes. Does what it&#x27;s supposed to do. What more can you ask of a product?</li>
    <li> Good Quality. Total protection and zero fragrances.</li>
    <li> We usually buy this product at our local store, but for some reason the stores are not carrying this item on their shelves anymore. We were told that you can only purchase it online. My husband loves this product. He said this is the only deodorant that really works well for him. I&#x27;m happy to be able to purchase it through Amazon</li>
    <li> I love this brand and this is a good price for 4..</li>
    <li> I have no complaints for this product.  The pack of 4 is better since I don&#x27;t have to worry about searching for it in the stores.  I don&#x27;t know if I am imagining but the 4 pack that I received seems \\&quot;fresher\\&quot; and works better than the store bought singles. There is no skin irritation and the odor protection is better.</li>
    <li> Best I&#x27;ve ever used. I&#x27;ve been using this type for 20 years, Amazon&#x27;s price is better than the local stores.</li>
    <li> This is my husband&#x27;s go-to, favorite deodorant, ever. We hadn&#x27;t been able to find it anywhere for ages. Then, on a whim, I looked on Amazon, again. Voila! It&#x27;s here! The whining will now cease! Hahahaha... ;-)  It really is a decent all-purpose, long-lasting deodorant.</li>
    <li> MITCHUM&#x27;S IS THE BEST DEODORANT EVER MADE.  TRY IT AND YOU WILL NEVER GO BACK....&lt;br /&gt;ABSOLUTELY SUPERIOR PROTECTION VS ALL OTHER DEODORANTS.&lt;br /&gt;COMPLETELY ODORLESS.&lt;br /&gt;ROLL-ON SATURATES EVERY HAIR TO PREVENT ALL ODOR.&lt;br /&gt;IT LITERALLY LASTS 3 DAYS OR MORE IF YOU EVER NEED IT TO.&lt;br /&gt;TIP- SATURATE ALL THE HAIR FOR BEST PROTECTION. YOU MUST ALLOW THE LIQUID TO DRY COMPLETELY BECAUSE IF IT IS LEFT WET, IT WILL EVENTUALLY CAUSE SLIGHT IRRITATION.  SO YOU NEED A FEW MINUTES TO LET IT DRY. BUT THIS IS LIKELY TRUE OF ANY ROLL-ON ANYWAY.</li>
    <li> The best deodorant ever made! It&#x27;s long lasting and you stay fresh all day. It&#x27;s the only deodorant that has worked for me and I have tried every brand.</li>
    <li> How nice to buy the 4-pack and have it delivered on time and without any leakage or messes!  Mitchum is one of my favorite deodorants and I like having a back-up supply on hand especially with our desert heat just around the corner.</li>
    <li> I have used this deoderant for 15+ years.  Even skip a day and no stink.  Locale stores are not carrying it reliably so I was glad to see it on Amazon.  Wish they had the smaller &amp;#34;travel&amp;#34; size too! The scented version gave me a rash but never a problem with unscented.  I get no flake or residue transfer.</li>
    <li> This product total works in terms of keeping those lovely underarm smells at bay (i.e. using this, there is no smell at all). It does not control sweating but I don&#x27;t consider that a problem. However, I recently noticed Aluminum listed as an ingredient so am now trying to see if perhaps there is some other product that might work as well *without* any aluminum in it....hence the 4 star rating.</li>
    <li> For anyone who needs to control underarm sweating, this is the best solution.  I have used it for many years.</li>
    <li> All 4 bottles had solidified deodorant around the roller balls.</li>
    <li> Ditto with the severe reaction to the new formula.  The new stuff causes chemical burns on me.</li>
    <li> Fast shipment, efficient packaging, excellent product.  This is my favorite deodorant and I am fearful that at any time they will quit manufacturing it.</li>
    <li> I will miss this old formula (in the skinny bottles) it works much better than the new formula in the rocket shaped bottles :(. Hopefully Mitchum changes it back! I hurried and placed a order for a bunch in time to get the old ones.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for years. It is the best product for my body.  I&#x27;m currently living in a location that does not carry Mitchum, so I tried others.  To my dismay, they did not work. I am very happy I could get my tried and true Mitchum through Amazon. I will reorder again when necessary.</li>
    <li> Have been using Mitchum Anti-Perspirant and Deodorant Roll on for many years.  Really prefer the unscented, works for me all the time</li>
    <li> I bought the old product, hoping to reorder. I was used to buying it at WalMart for $3.99. Then they changed the formula. I bought one to try, fully expecting to use my Prime membership to stock up on it if I liked it. I do not. After being a loyal Mitchum customer for 4 decades I&#x27;m leaving the Mitchum fan club. The product (roll-on/unscented) is sticky and harsh. I liked the old unisex unscented roll -on, now it says Men&#x27;s. There isn&#x27;t a compatible product in the women&#x27;s. I&#x27;m out!</li>
    <li> Mitchum is the best anti-perspirant and deodorant available -- period. While it may be true that ladies glow, men perspire and horses sweat, I sweat! And Mitchum deals with sweat! Dry underarms even under stress, no garment staining -- what more could one ask of an essential personal care item. Because many new anti-perspirants have hit the supermarket shelves, it has become hard to find this prodmost product routinely, so I&#x27;ve tried many others which do not work as well. While the quality of Mitchum almost makes me ignore price, it is good to find a great deal and automatic shipping on Amazon. I&#x27;ll never be forced to use a lesser product again.</li>
    <li> When I&#x27;ve been using Mitchum for over 25 years and it is the best and most dependable deodorant. It&#x27;s hard to find the roll on in stores and when I do, it&#x27;s so pricey. Amazon offers it at at a great price!</li>
    <li> Mitchum is my favorite deodorant.It still works after years of use and I like that it is unscented.Sometimes I am so busy I don&#x27;t even have time to shop! IT was great to have a foru pack delivered to my door!</li>
    <li> Used Mitchum unscented for men as long as I can remember. At least 25 years. Since they came out with the new product, it&#x27;s a runny, sticky, mess. They now say the product has OXYGEN formula. I think they sucked the Oxygen out of the heads of there techs when putting together this &amp;#34;new and improved&amp;#34; version. I do not even consider it a gel since it goes on like a liquid as if you used the rollerball type. Feels like glue under your arm while drying and takes forever to dry. Had to stand under my ceiling fan on high with my arms raised since after 10 minutes still not dry. Called the company and did complain. I advise others to do the same. 888-8Mitchum. WILL NOT BE BUYING THIS AGAIN UNTIL THEY GO BACK TO ORIGINAL FORMULA.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for at least 20 years and now am finding difficulty finding it in he stores. Since it isn&#x27;t necessary to&lt;br /&gt;apply it every day a four pack will last a very long time. Thank you Amazon !!</li>
    <li> All I an say is thank heavens I found this product here.  It is no longer in our stores here in Michigan.  What Mitchem put out instead discolored my clothes, smelled when it was not supposed to have a scent and I generally hated it.  Both the fatter, new bottle of &amp;#34;unscented&amp;#34; and the gooey gel both smelled up my clothes and caused discoloration.  Don&#x27;t know what I am going to do when the 8 bottles I bought are gone.  Hope that Mitchem gets enough bad feedback it gives us back this formula you sent me.  Thanks.  curious as to how you got it, but, oh well.  Julie George</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t find this version of Mitchum anywhere else</li>
    <li> This product is the best protection against wetness on your underarms.  With the roll-on you control the amount and it will outlast the solid deodorant stick.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve started sweating excessively in my underarms the past few years. I got to the point where I even sweated while sitting and just watching TV or on the computer. I&#x27;ve tried different products containing different aluminum salts, including Gillette, Degree, and SweatBlock. Mitchum is by far superior to the close to 10 products I&#x27;ve tried. Others have wrote they changed the formula and doesn&#x27;t work anymore, but this stuff really worked for me. Only took about 2 days to see the full effect. I&#x27;ve had success applying both at night or in the morning. Mitchum is a pretty fair price, only about 5 bucks for one container. I haven&#x27;t tried the gel, but the roll on had been working wonders. I still sweat some with heavy physical activity, but I&#x27;d say my overall sweating was reduced by 80-90%. No more need to change my shirt 3 or 4 times a day. I but will be using and recommending for a while to come.</li>
    <li> Not sure why they did, but they changed it. Aluminum Zirconium Tetrachlorohydrex Gly 20% is the old formula. This new stuff sucks. Don&#x27;t bother.</li>
    <li> I have used this deodorant for many years and am sorry to see it is no longer manufactured.</li>
    <li> I have used Mitchum&#x27;s unscented ROLL-ON since I was in my 20&#x27;s. I am now 73 and the change now has me trying to find something that does the same job that  the original formula did.  I am SO DISAPPOINTED in this product. It doesn&#x27;t last until the next morning.  If I could rate this change, it would be a negative 5 I hate wet underarms............</li>
    <li> My favorite deodorant. Works great and no weird scent, but kind of pricey when purchased one at a time at the drugstore. This was the perfect solution! I have a little supply now and it came out much cheaper per item. Thanks!</li>
    <li> Best deodorant ever - especially in the southwest.  I have been using it for years but can&#x27;t find locally anymore!  Purchased a 4 pack to keep in stock.  NOTHING has worked for me like Mitchum.</li>
    <li> Have used this product for years.  Great buy for four bottles!</li>
    <li> Came as promised, a little confusion on my end with shipping, but it arrived and they arrived shrink wrapped. Would buy again</li>
    <li> Much better than gels.</li>
    <li> Mitchum works great to stop sweat, but takes way too long to dry on the skin.  It also can leave a residue on clothing.</li>
    <li> Finally a simple roll on deodorant the works and doesn&#x27;t doesn&#x27;t leave my shirts with a white power look</li>
    <li> I bought this product to try and remedy the pit stains I get from excessive armpit sweating. It does not seem to work for me as I still have pit stains at least 2 or 3 times a week. Also, it does not mask body odor very well.</li>
    <li> I am a woman who has used this brand for at least 30 years because nothing else stopped my perspiration.  The only drawback was really dry, itchy skin which was remedied by using a solid roll-on (different brand, but also for men) before applying Mitchum.</li>
    <li> Glad to be able to get this product online.  It&#x27;s no longer being sold in stores for some reason.  Many of the &#x27;improved&#x27; anti-perspirants have harsh ingredients that I an unable to tolerate.  This particular item by Mitchum is effective but gentle on the skin.</li>
    <li> Mitchum is the only deodorant that works for me.  This product isn&#x27;t easy to find and I am so thankful you have it.</li>
    <li> Product arrived quickly. Price was good. thanks.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d recommend this to anyone who is serious about tackling their underarm odor.  It&#x27;s a product that&#x27;s worth spending money for.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I was looking for.  Very pleased.</li>
