    <li> I really enjoy the Chamomile Roman Essential Oil. I use it daily mixed with Lavender and Jojoba oils. I use it topically on my neck, lower back, and feet in the mornings and sometimes in the evening before bed. It relaxes body before playing tennis and tends to keep my anxieties at bay.</li>
    <li> Wonderful smell, I rub a few drops on my leg for restless leg and works like a charm.</li>

    <li> This is my second order of Roman Chamomile from plant Life, after doTerra&#x27;s price went up not twice, but four times. I have been using it for various remedies and has proven efficient. It has healed wounds, scrapes and bruises, and most importantly, in a diluted mix with lavender has completely healed my dog&#x27;s dermatitis and hot spots. I recommend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: This is now my third order of this oil from this company. I see some refer to it&#x27;s &amp;#34;chemical&amp;#34; scent - this has a pure herbal scent of chamomile flower. It is heaven sent. I have been purchasing, diluting it and sending it to my mother, who uses it for her pet&#x27;s minor abrasions as well. Do not think lower price means less quality - this is not the case. Works wonderful.</li>
    <li> Packaged good and arrived on time good product.</li>
