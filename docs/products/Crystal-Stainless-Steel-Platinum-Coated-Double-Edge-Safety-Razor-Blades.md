<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Now one of my favorite blades for DE razors. I love that there is no wax or glue fixing the blade to the wrapper, and I love the plastic packaging. Not as good as the feather packs because it doesn&#x27;t function well as a blade bank to recycle spent blades, but it does keep the new ones nice and firmly inside, unlike the cardboard packs that always want to spill blades everywhere once you&#x27;ve opened them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As to the blades themselves, they are very, very sharp. I usually toss them after one use, but I am a head shaver with very thick, coarse hair, so they get a lot of use in a typical three pass shave. Also, I just like knowing that I have a brand new blade every time, because otherwise I lose track. And the price is right for such extravagance, and since I recycle them, I don&#x27;t  feel wasteful.</li>
    <li> not much sharper than the Derby blades, but still gave a great shave. I believe that whatever double edge blade is used it is still better than a cartridge.</li>
    <li> Did not work for my beard. Felt like I was using a used blade. Might work for other people just not for mine. Like the case and reuse it with blades that do work for my beard.</li>
    <li> I ordered a 100 of these and have been trying to use them up. These are terrible blades. There is a serious quality issue with the ones I received because one side of many is dull while the other side somewhat sharp. I have tried a bunch of them and this issue is prevalent in perhaps one of every three blades I have used. It is apparent from the blades that I received that they are either rejects or there is a major lack of quality control. There are times when I end up using three blades one after another to get an acceptable shave.</li>
    <li> A sharp blade, though not as sharp as the Feather.  It is a very smooth blade, and is great for beginners.</li>
    <li> These blades are very sharp. They are sharper than any that I purchased in local businesses. They are very smooth shaving. With proper preparation, you will notice less pull and tug, thus, less irritation. The only blade I&#x27;ve used that I would say is sharper is the Feathers. However, using them side by side, there isn&#x27;t much difference. If you prepare your face properly for shaving, these blades will prove wonderful. For your comparison, I am using a Parker 92 razor.</li>
    <li> I thought, after all the reviews, I would try these blades. They do not feel anywhere near as sharp as the Shark brand razors. I get a lot more skin soreness from these than I did from other brands. These are on par with the bad blades you can buy at WalMart. No thanks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I won&#x27;t be buying these again.</li>
    <li> Aside from Feather blades, these imo, are the best ones out there, and at a fraction of the price. Great blades!!!</li>
    <li> Everything is as stated.  First time trying the blades, I think I prefer the merkur blade that came with my razor.  Good product.</li>
    <li> I have been using Feathers since i started wetshaving about a year ago, however unless i spend a lot of time prepping and am laser-like focused i will end up with nicks.  I read about these blades on a shaving forum and they had great reviews.  I have a what would be considered a tough beard, course hair and shave daily.  I have always had trouble with my neck and shaving against the grain.  These blades allow me to comfortably shave against the grain without nicks or irritation for the first time consistently.  I&#x27;m glad i took the chance and got 100pack.  I am considering stockpiling these and getting some more.</li>
    <li> I just started using a DE blade system for shaving. These are well priced, and they are very sharp. I usually get two or three shaves out of each razor. About 1 out of 10 were not super sharp though. I would get maybe one shave (rough) out of them before I would have to replace it. All in all, a good product though.</li>
    <li> Upon running out of the Shark razor blades, I decided to give these a go.  It was evident upon the first stroke that these did not perform as well:  Whereas a fresh Shark blade cut like butter through my coarse day-old stubble, these exert a noticeable \\&quot;pull\\&quot;.  Moreover, I&#x27;m now resorting to replacing blades every one or two days as opposed to going nearly a week with the Shark ones.  I definitely will not be replenishing my supply when they run out.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know what was shipped to me but they are not Israeli Personnas. they didn&#x27;t have the white and blue packaging which reads \\&quot;Personna\\&quot;, as is pictured. Instead I received something in a black and red package that says \\&quot;Krystal\\&quot;. These Krystal blades DO NOT live up to Israeli Personnas. Most of them have ended up in the trash already.  Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> I love these blades! they sharp for upwards of 2 weeks worth of uses and fit well in my Merkur handle. Definitely worth buying in bulk.</li>
    <li> My boyfriend has been using an old-school safety razor to shave, and he says these razor blades are \\&quot;awesome\\&quot; for that.</li>
    <li> Great quality/quantity/price ratio.  I decided to stock up on good double-edge blades when they mysteriously became sparse at my local grocery stores and pharmacies.  That&#x27;s all there is to it.</li>
    <li> Ill be honest and this is no lie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the last several years I have used a beard trimmer maybe once a week, since it works and I can get away with the look, but I missed the days of a 2 blade Gillette sensor (pay attention Gillette...... Yes you...come on...Yhe ones who made the 1950s DE blade the most used item and led the market...psst  start making it again like you did and make good blades...Russia.... blahhh).  Ever since the sensor the prices are horrid and the add on blades 3...4...5  can I get a 6?,..are crapola. So you sell me a 3, 4 or 5 blade system and it needs an aloe strip... wait... why?  I just spent 15 bucks for 5 blades and get 2 maybe 3 uses.... Wait  why?  The blades are so close they clog and I cant tap them out in a sink with warm  water.... whats going on here??  Gillette I must thank you for a recent meme from a attempt from your company to promote your latest razor and the overwhelming answer was you made the best product in the 1950s.  That got me looking and hey.... a lot of people agree, not a few, not close.... A LOT.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased the Edwin Jagger DE89Lbl, I had no problems like some with handle grip.  That being  said the Derby blades that came with it are not very good.  You can heard the blade and stubble sound as you cut with the grain and I am not a very hairy person and my stubble is thinner than most manly men with face hair like a lumber jack who love DE razors.  No irritation really, but I was hoping for the word &amp;#34;aggressive&amp;#34;...i.e. smooth strokes and baby soft end result.  Many say  its a learning curve, but I found quickly I yearned for a more aggressive blade for a silent and close shave.  The real Israeli blades are made in Israel &amp;#34;Cystal Super&amp;#34;.  God I really like the Crystal super, just tonight I was shaving..... whats that?.... yeah 3rd time in a week..... it is like an addiction and not a curse now.  So tonight I was shaving for the 2nd time with Crystal Israeli blades..... are they sharp you ask?.... well I just barely touched my ear and the SOB bled for 15 minute.  I hate them? you say.... no no  I say.  We my friend have found aggressive.  The fact my ear lobe bled for 15 minutes until it stopped was actually the best experience.  Why??? OK I will continue. .. This is part of the blood clotting factors (factor IIX) and the key here is to think if the ear bled for 15 minutes... why?  The answer is the blades were so Sharp the body didn&#x27;t even know it had an injury.  Now I think I have the blades I want.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have recently purchased the Merkur long handle safety razor and I want to see if it is any different from the Jagger.  Please keep in mind that 35 bucks is cheap or what you are getting for either the Jagger or the Merkur.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you look around and do serches you will find that the razor is about feel and grip, the blades are very important for each persons needs and wants and for the love of god get Badger shaving brush and some shaving lotion made for this shaving style.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A friend of mind says that they think the best thing so far is hair conditioner for her legs.  I have ot try it and see how it compares to &amp;#34;Taylor of old bond sandalwood&amp;#34; (You must find the review about why you are here and that your Grandfather was so sexy sexy sandalwood....funny).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For an honest review and a good list of razors ...please see http://sharpologist.com/2013/07/what-is-the-best-de-razor.html&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very good and honest reviews of razors and blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On that note I wish you good luck and good shaving.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m currently using these in a Gillette Slim Adjustable.  The blades have lasted longer than the brand I purchased in the local chain stores.  Also, I get a nice close shave.  More than worth the price for the quality vs other brands I&#x27;ve tried.  I&#x27;ll buy again, but it will be quite a while before I need to buy bladed again.</li>
    <li> These blades are as good as anything I have tried, including Feather. I use them with a Merkur 34C razor and they seem to work better than the other brands.</li>
    <li> There blades are terrific and give a close shave, can get up to 4-5 shaves per blade. Excellent product, can&#x27;t beat the price</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using these for a few months now and have been very happy with the results.  They work really well with a Merkur and last about a week, maybe slightly more if you want to push it, with daily shaving.  I&#x27;ve read some reviews saying that you need Merkur blades for a Merkur razor, but I&#x27;ve tried both and haven&#x27;t seen any difference.  Buying in bulk like this definitely has cost benefits - it&#x27;s only a few cents per blade, which is another added benefit to switching from the Mach 3 (and its ilk).  Anyway - these are good razors and will give you a very very close shave.  Just remember that you absolutely have to use a high quality cream or soap or you run the risk of cutting the crap out of your face...</li>
    <li> Great blade for the price.  The coating on the blade seems to last longer than others.  Easier on face than the feather nut still sharp enough.</li>
    <li> Nice blades. I get at least five shaves from one blade.</li>
    <li> Love the shave one gets with this proven design. Great shave and money savings too.</li>
    <li> I have purchased these blades twice.  The first batch was purchased in July 2012 when I first started using a safety razor (merkur 180) and the second batch in July 2014.  I have very light patchy facial hair so I can get by with only shaving a few times a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am giving these a two star rating as a result of the second batch I am currently working my way through.  The first batch was perfect, very consistent sharp shave and excellent value.  In the two years since that first batch, there appears to be a change in manufacturing or potential a deficiency within a specific manufacturer batch as my second order wasn&#x27;t nearly as good as the first.  Consistent with a few other poor reviews, the blades appear to be misaligned resulting in uneven shaves across either side of the blade.  Without breaking out a micrometer, it is visually apparent that one side hangs out slightly further than the other.  I am about halfway through this second batch and this is relatively consistent across each 10-pack received.  Ultimately, you can get a decent shave with the side sticking out, and the other side is near unusable resulting in lower overall value for the order.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As I come to the end of this current batch I will continue to monitor the reviews and see if these issues still come up before placing another order.</li>
    <li> Pretty good. I still prefer Dorco blades.</li>
    <li> These are some great blades. Made in Israel at the Personna plant there. They give a very smooth shave. They are well liked within the wet shaving community for a good reason. They work and are comfortable. Purchased these along with 2 erasmic shave sticks for the free shipping. Delivery was prompt, had them within a week. Give them a try, you might like them.</li>
    <li> Best blades for sensitive or Acne prone skin.</li>
    <li> I have been using the double edge safety razor for the past 18months and quite comfortable with the system. I have also tried several blades including Feather, Merkur, Gillette and others.. The Crystal blades ranks #2, next to Feather. For the price comparison between Feather and Crystal it&#x27;s not a bad idea to go with the #2 - Crystal.</li>
    <li> I love these blades, and I cannot believe how inexpensive they are! I would highly recommend these blades to everyone.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Merkur blades in the past with a Merkur razor. These give a more comfortable, close shave by comparison. Seem to last okay and great value too for 100.</li>
    <li> Very happy this the price on Amazon for these razors. I usually get at least 5 good shaves with these razors. These are the one&#x27;s made in Israel.</li>
    <li> Given the price, you wouldn&#x27;t expect these blades to be as good as they are - but, they really are the best blades I have found for my razor.  Very consistent shave.  I switch blades after 3 shaves, but these always seem like they still have 3-4 more shaves in them.</li>
    <li> These blades are sharp.  We get great use from them.  I can use one for many shaves.  And they cost less than the multi edge blades.</li>
    <li> I replace after 3/4 shaves, never have a worry about a bad shave, zero complaints, will buy again in 18 months when these finally run out. Take that, Mach 57&#x27;s!  lol</li>
    <li> I have found these razors an excellent place to start. No grabbing and last at least 5 shaves. I shave my entire head so if you&#x27;re shaving your face you may get more shaves from a single razor.</li>
    <li> The blades are good and very sharp. My hubby shaves every second day and gets 3 good bb shaves from a single blade.</li>
    <li> I have tried other double edged blades for my razor, these are by far the best. They are a little more expensive, but well worth the extra cost. The shave with these blades will leave your face smooth and clean. I switched about two years ago to the Mekur razor after getting fed up with the unbelievable price of the pop-in cartidges for the super market razors.  From Amazon I ordered a nice razor, a lather brush, already had my fathers soap \\&quot;mug\\&quot; (from Old-Spice), a stand and some blades. I have not really been happy with the quality of the shave until I ordered these blades, now I am glad that I have \\&quot;changed\\&quot;. I will be using these blades from now on!  Try them.</li>
    <li> Not as pictured. These are made in Israel, and the brand is Crystal. I haven&#x27;t tried them yet, and I don&#x27;t have any experience with Israeli Personas. Even if I did, I don&#x27;t put much stock in blade reviews - too many variables.&lt;br /&gt;I will say that I purchased these as a lower priced alternative to Feathers, as I&#x27;ve decided that the best thing for my shave is to use a new blade every day.</li>
    <li> Being fairly new to DE razor&#x27;s, my review my not count as much.  As a long time Amazon customer, I always make a point to at least attempt a review in case it may help someone.  I first started off with Shark razors that came with my DE razor.  Shark was a decent blade that I had to swap out every other shave as they became uncomfortable after that.  While looking for a new blade, I had read a review for this product that mention these blades could go 5 shaves and thought for the price, I would try it.  There is a huge difference between these and Shark, I was very impressed. I shave 3-5 times per week, and regardless of having 1 or 2 day stubble, it glides effortlessly.  It reminded me of my mach 3 turbo razors I had before I switched to DE.  So having such a comfortable shave with blades that are so durable I can use 1 per week, is great.  So buying a hundred, I will not have to worry about buying more blades for almost 2 yrs.  Can&#x27;t beat that.</li>
    <li> By far my favorite double edge blade.  I get 5-7 shaves out of a blade, heck at this price versus those multi blade razors I could probably shave with a fresh blade each day and be ahead of the game financially.  Have worked my way through a lot of the other blades on the market with no success.  The Feather&#x27;s are the closest to these, but paradoxically I think they are too sharp and I end up with some irritation as a result.  Buy a box, you can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
    <li> the sharpest I&#x27;ve ever shaved with.</li>
    <li> Talk about a hot knife through butter. I just started using a DE razor and these blades are really nice.  I got used to fighting through thick stubble with my old cartridge razor, but these razors made it very comfortable!  I would definitely buy again!</li>
    <li> I am a recent convert to the safety razor / wet shaving community, and let me tell you that these blades are light-years ahead of the blades that came with the safety-razor I bought.    The blades that came with my razor would nick me if I looked at them wrong, but these blades give a good shave without much of any irritation.  Worth your money.</li>
    <li> Blades went dull after 1 month on this batch.</li>
    <li> I just received a shipment of 100 Crystals and they have become one of my \\&quot;go to\\&quot; brands, along with Red Personnas. I actually ordered them from a different source at a lower price.    Considering that I paid $14 per hundred, including shipping, and get 7 shaves per blade, it&#x27;s costing me only two cents per shave plus the cost of (TOBS) cream. My guess is that it costs me about 5 cents total per shave and the quality blows those overpriced multi-blade cartridges out of the water.    I could probably squeeze another shave or two out of these blades but they do start to drag a bit after the 7th shave. Anyway, at this price, who cares.    Blades don&#x27;t work the same for everyone as there are a lot of variables. I&#x27;d suggest trying a 10 pack before ordering in bulk. If these work as well for you as they do for me, you&#x27;ll be ordering more.</li>
    <li> Went back to a safety razor after tiring of the prices for the umpteen-blade miracle shavers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought a sampler pack of double-edged blades and found THESE in it.  I tried the first one, and I&#x27;m hooked!  They shave smooooth with no tug or pull, and even shaving daily, at the end of a week, they&#x27;re still comfortably sharp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was unwilling to believe this with just the first blade, but a month into them, I bought the 120-pack.  I&#x27;m sold.</li>
    <li> OUTSTANDING razor blades!!!  These are the REAL Israel brand and better than anything I&#x27;ve used.  Stay AWAY from the American brands as they are basically ALL junk.  You just can&#x27;t correlate &amp;#34;American Made&amp;#34; with quality any more......</li>
    <li> I bought 120 of these because it was a good deal.  I recommend buying a smaller quantity if you haven&#x27;t tried these yet.  They&#x27;re decent blades, but as they say, &amp;#34;your mileage may vary&amp;#34; and I&#x27;ve simply had better results with other blades.  Others swear by them, and they may turn out to be the best blade for you personally...but get a single tuck if you haven&#x27;t tried them before.</li>
    <li> I love these things.  They&#x27;re just like the (good) American Personna DE blades that are often re-labeled and sold as generic blades, but the quality on no-name Personna blades can be spotty.    If you like the super-sharp DE blades (Feather, etc), then you might not like these, but if you prefer a safe blade to a face-bleeder, then these are definitely for you.    The blade case reminds me of a pack of gum.  There&#x27;s no separate slot for the used blades, and no spring.  Each blade is individually wrapped in wax paper.    The blue label you see in the picture is cardboard, and comes off to reveal the wax-wrapped blades.    Each \\&quot;10 pack\\&quot; of these has ten double-sided blades (20 cutting surfaces total).</li>
    <li> I love these blades when I first started de shaving from a sample I got, it was smooth and seem to last, so I ordered 120  of them, it does give me a good shave but I find Astra to be sharper and smoother, it seems the sample I got were sharper and smoother compared to the bulk 120 blades I bought, so now I just use these on my more aggressive razors, YMMV.</li>
    <li> I have been looking for a good compromise between price and quality for some time now, for my face the combination between the Crystal super + blades and my early-style Gillette Tech make for a very nice shave, I have a rather tough beard so shaving usually dulls a blade rather quickly.  I get 4 to 5 shaves, 3 passes each from the blade before it starts pulling and needs to be replaced. I have shaved with sharper blades but they dull rather quickly.  The Crystal Super + are my current go-to blades now in my Gillette NEW, my 1911 Gillette ABC razor, and in my Techs.</li>
    <li> My favorite blades out of every kind I have tried. They are ULTRA affordable and give a quality shave in line with Feather, Personna etc.</li>
    <li> These blades are a great deal, they stay sharp enough to comfortably shave 10-15 times, and I shave every 2-3 days, although I have a lighter beard which is probably why they last so long for me.      I&#x27;ve given a 2 week test period devoted to each of 4 brands of blades; Feather blades of Japan, Merkur of germany, Derby of Turkey, and these Personna made in Israel I found to give the \\&quot;best\\&quot; shave for me personally, with the most ease, and least amount of irritation. Just my experience, will likely be different for alot of people.</li>
    <li> 2 months &amp; still on my first 10 pack. I bought these searching for a rust resistant blade as I live in Florida with 100% humidity salt air. To date zero rust &amp; the blades are good for a week + of every other day shaving. I use them in my Milord &amp; Gillette Tech, they are a close shave without being too aggressive.</li>
    <li> In the world of traditional shaving, the old advice that &amp;#34;you get what you pay for&amp;#34; is absolutely true.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have never used a double-edge razor before, I&#x27;m not suggesting you rush out and buy these blades.  Surely I would have cut myself to ribbons if these had been the blades I started out with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But you don&#x27;t have to use a safety razor for a decade before you buy these.  Once you&#x27;ve got the technique down, but you&#x27;re not satisfied with the cut and lifespan of your current blades (because you live in the middle of nowhere and can&#x27;t shop local AND buy a decent set of razor blades), THEN you buy these.  And you will love them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But you have to take care of them.  If you&#x27;re a &amp;#34;rinse-and-shake&amp;#34; kinda&#x27; guy after you finish shaving, these aren&#x27;t the blades for you.  I use a towel to dry off the edges of the blade before I put it back in the cabinet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thus far, I am extremely pleased with these blades.</li>
    <li> Very good blades. They are indeed sharp when brand new but just be careful and move slowly, especially over bumps. That said, if they do cut you it doesn&#x27;t hurt much and it heals very fast.</li>
    <li> Product as described,I would buy from them again,Thanks</li>
    <li> My only complaint is that the razors came in individual packs of 10 blades each - the last time I ordered Israeli personnas (several years ago) I received 100 blades in a small cardboard box, which is more convenient and less wasteful.  The quality of the blades however is great, and this purchase should last me 4-5 years (only shaving once or twice per week).</li>
    <li> These blades an amazingly sharp and stay sharp.  I found it harder and harder to find razor blades in town so I bought what I hoped what a life time supply.  I actually think due to their long life I am saving money,  I can get a month of shaving on a single blade!  I guess this will only last my 10 years ;-)</li>
    <li> They only last about a week for me before I need to change to a new one.So 120 Weeks-over two years before I buy more :-)</li>
    <li> I had high hopes for these and they&#x27;re pretty sharp, however, they were very \\&quot;grabby\\&quot; and I&#x27;m going to end up giving them to my girlfriend along with the $20 safety razor. I&#x27;d use them on my legs if I shaved them, but not my face. Oh well, lesson learned. Thought it was a good deal. Learned.</li>
    <li> These are good razors but I am going for the Feathers as they say they are the sharpest.&lt;br /&gt;I have a rough beard and these do a good job on my beard and head but&lt;br /&gt;looking forward to trying  the Japanese samari sword feathers:)</li>
    <li> My current favorite blade is the Wilkenson sword. So far I&#x27;m on day four of the same blade and it seems to be every bit as good as my Wilkinsons.</li>
    <li> These razors are the bomb.com!  I can&#x27;t get over how great my shave is, especially around the tricky neck parts.</li>
    <li> Best razor I can find.  Very sharp and forgiving.  I rarely knick myself with thse.  I shave everyday and change them out once a week.</li>
    <li> these blades are up there on my list. Feathers and the Russians are a little nicer (on my face) but cost much more. Super Safety Razor is the best.</li>
    <li> Okay these are just fantastic.  These are the &amp;#34;Israeli Personna&amp;#34; blades, sold under the Crystal brand.  Presumably imported directly by American Safety Razor rather than via Europe like the &amp;#34;Red Personna&amp;#34; blades.  As a result, you get them for a decent price.  Admittedly sharper -- though not necessarily smoother -- than Astra Superior Platinum blades, these are great in most razors, and will give a very good shave.  Good for touch-up too, as they remain sharp.</li>
    <li> Cyrstal Stainless Steel Platinum Blades still gives you a close shave after 4 shaves. I recommend For any Safety Razor.</li>
    <li> This blade is reasonably sharp and with my medium to aggressive merkur long handle safety razor, it even knicks at times.&lt;br /&gt;Being a beginner to safety razor shaving, starting with this is good. Starting with something like derby is also not a bad idea.</li>
    <li> These are great blades. I use them in my Merkur safety razor. They&#x27;re not only really sharp but always provide a consistent shave at a low price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do change mine after every shave because I have extremely sensitive skin that is prone to ingrown hairs on my neck and face. However the blades are still quite sharp and make quick work of any excessive body hair I might have. This is just a personal preference because these blades work out to something like 15 cents each.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I turned my roommate onto safety razors and he loves these too. However he&#x27;ll use the same blade for 4-5 shaves before changing.</li>
    <li> The blades sent are of slightly better quality than the Merkur Super blades I have been using, but are much cheaper.  These only last one shave for me, which is what I expect out of a blade; your mileage may vary.</li>
    <li> Good blades for the money.  The only ones I like better are the Feathers.</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B001G5HZCY Feather Razor Blades]] give me razor burn which is strange because they are the most expensive. I have found that [[ASIN:B0026MRA1W Derby Extra]] and Crystal razor blades give me an excellent close shave without the burn.</li>
    <li> If you are looking for a good blade for your dbl edge razor, these are on my short list in my razor. I think you will like them too.</li>
    <li> I have been shaving with these razors for about a month and I have to say that they are SHARP! I mean, you would probably go &amp;#34;DUH!&amp;#34;, but seriously, they are excellent blades and they give you a nice close shave. I would recommend them. I gave them four stars because they aren&#x27;t getting everything on the first pass, but that just may be my technique. I will revise if needed.</li>
    <li> I bought these after watching a you Tube video on them. I was very pleased with the way they preformed in my safety razor. They glided over my whiskers with no tug at all. I had a smooth shave with only one pass. they are a great value and I would say a &amp;#34;must try&amp;#34; for wet shavers.</li>
    <li> These blades are horrible, about as bad as Merkur blades. Not really sharp at all. Youre going to have to make multiple passes and each blade doesnt last long. Skip these and get feather or Gillette silver blues, because these are just horrible.</li>
    <li> I switched to a DE razor to save money and be able to recycle my blades. I started with more expensive blades and tried these on a recommendation from a friend. Along with the great price, they also provide a better shave than any blade I&#x27;ve used.</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t tried too many blades, but these work better than what I was originally using, i.e. merkur.</li>
    <li> These seem in line with a number of other brands I&#x27;ve been swapping back and forth on, meaning they&#x27;re pretty good. Seems I get  one less optimum shave than with Astra or Wilkinson, but it&#x27;s still a fine blade for the price.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a barber and this is definitely my blade of choice. It&#x27;s very sharp and not to be used by an amateur.</li>
    <li> These blades will last for quite awhile, depending on how quickly you go through blades. Nothing fancy about these, just nice stainless steel razor blades for your safety. Good sharpness rating for a normal to course facial hair type.</li>
    <li> Most reviewers state that the Japanese Feather blades are the best double edge blades on the market.  I would agree that they are the sharpest, but they seem to be a bit too sharp for my tastes.  The Israeli made Personnas are probably the second sharpest that there are, and I now use them exclusively to shave in my Merkur 180, Long Handle razor.  I&#x27;m not too certain about how gauche it may be to place Israeli blades into a German razor, but it seems to work well from my experience.  The shave is close and relaxed.  Certainly, it is possible to get a nick or two when shaving, but the combo allows for a relaxed shave where I don&#x27;t have to worry about too much blood shed. [[ASIN:B000NL0T1G Merkur Model 180 Long Handled Safety Razor]]</li>
    <li> I tried a dozen different blades and these are the best. I get 10 to 15 good shaves from each blade.</li>
    <li> A very sharp (second only to my Feather blades) smooth blade that is priced right and gives a great, close shave with little or no irritation.  Have used in my Merkur 180 and Muhle R41 with great results.</li>
    <li> My DE Merkur Razor came with a Merkur stainless steel blade. My first shave with the DE Razor was less than successful, owing to learning the new shave process and having a blade that simply was not sharp enough. Fast forward 4 days -- ordered and received my 120 Crystal &amp;#34;Super +&amp;#34; Stainless Steel Platinum blades, loaded them up, and shaved. The first shave was good...the second one was GREAT. My first, second and third pass were as follows: WTG, ATG, XTG. Super baby smooth shave, one very minor nick on my chin, where I went XTG too hard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I suspect I can get more than 2-3 shaves out of each blade, which was not what I was expecting, especially now that I just bought 120qty (which will last me a lifetime).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TL;DR: these blades are sharp as hell; give them a shot.</li>
    <li> My favorite blade so far.  The US Personnas are also great.  (same manufacturer).  Smooth, no drag, no pull, no (almost) blood.</li>
    <li> The blade is great and smooth but doesn&#x27;t give me a smooth close shave, i use gillette silver blue.</li>
    <li> I tried a sampler with derbys merkurs red personnas feathers and these and these gave me the best shave by far.  I shave my head twice a week and my face 4 times a week on one blade.</li>
    <li> Although the Feathers seem to be a bit sharper, these blades have given me the smoothest shave so far out of the 5 brands I have tried. Definitely worth the price and easily last about 3-4 shaves shaving every other day.</li>
    <li> good blades for the price. Get 3-4 shaves per blade on my merkur on a very heavy/coarse beard. Very sharp out of the box. Wish they would last a few more shave before dulling but would probably last longer for most folks. will continue to use.</li>
    <li> This is my second blade and it&#x27;s good. But I&#x27;m still looking and experimenting with different ones. Gets the job done. Can&#x27;t say anything bad really cause I don&#x27;t know much, and to me both the blades I have tried are pretty much the same.</li>
    <li> I really had high hopes for these blades but after trying 2 blades and cutting myself on my juggler vein!!!  .  I like the derby which have a ceramic coating &amp;#34;derby extra&amp;#34;  and Astra superior platinum!!!  Go figure,  I tried the crystal on both my razors so it was the blade.!!! I am doing an update on these blades because I gave them 1 more chance.  I changed my pre shave adding shaving oil to my face and instead of my shaving soap I used Gillette gel for sensitive skin on my initial shave  No nicks no cuts.  On the second I used my regular soap for a smooth baby soft face,  I had my Merkur futur on the # 1 setting. I also slowed down and was more careful.  So I do recommend these and that&#x27;s all good because I still have 117 blades!!! I was able to get 4 nice shaves from 1 blade which is about 2 and a half pennys per shave!!!! win win win !!!</li>
    <li> These are my favorite DE blades, and I have used well over 15 other brands.</li>
    <li> I will keep this short -  I use an Edwin Jagger DE89lbl. I bought a few different brands of blades when I switched to DE shaving. The Derby blades that came with the razor did not work for me. I tried Wilkinson Sword, Derby, and Crystal \\&quot;SUPER +\\&quot;. I liked the Wilkinson and Crystal blades about the same. I chose the Crystals because they seem to hold an edge a shave or two longer. A good shave depends on razor, beard type, shave cream, prep, etc. Good luck.</li>
    <li> Despite being made by the Jews. These are great blades for shaving with my Merkur HD double edge Safety Blade. These are better than Wilkonson blades. I am still waiting for my feathers to try out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a very course beard. My hair dulls any blade extremely fast. Therefore, I replace my blades after every 2 shaves. These are a very good bargain of .15 cents/blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only thing I hate is that these blades are made in Israel...</li>
    <li> Can only get one or two shaves per blade.&lt;br /&gt;I have medium to light beard and after first shave the pulling and scraping starts.  Can&#x27;t wait until they are gone.</li>
    <li> Nice clean, smooth shave and very sharp blades. These Israeli Personnas are by far the best blade that I have used in the double edge category. This purchase should last me a year plus as I&#x27;m averaging 6-8 shaves per blade.</li>
    <li> Not as sharp as the feather but still give a close shave.  Far better than the shark blades that feel dull first time.</li>
    <li> Great blade life, comfortable feed back, great price. Not a fan of Israel but I&#x27;ll keep getting these razors from them. Hopefully they stop killing Palestinians and keep making these.&lt;br /&gt;Update, after using dozens of these I&#x27;m still satisfied. Occasionally I get a did that I only use once, but that&#x27;s probably only 1 out of 8 or so. Usually I get about 3-5 really good shaves with these. I usually switch at 3 though, they&#x27;re so cost effective and create so little waste, why not, right?</li>
    <li> Great blades, great deal.</li>
    <li> Rough shave--relatively stiff and dull blades. You are very aware that you are petting your face with a sharp piece of metal while shaving. First and only DE blades I have ever really cut myself with.  (I have very thick facial hair and I am using using taylor of old bond street cream with a merkur progress ). I&#x27;d recommend astras or 7 o&#x27;clocks for a balanced, comfortable, and reliable shave at a similar price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I should mention the razors I&#x27;m reviewing are not the ones in the picture. The blades that arrived are in black/red/grey packaging. They do say crystal and are made in Israel-- made by energizer personal care. I don&#x27;t know if they&#x27;re knockoffs or the legitimate &#x27;israeli personnas&#x27; in different packaging.</li>
    <li> These aren&#x27;t as sharp as Astra platinums.  If I could do over I&#x27;d get the personna platinum chrome that come in the black and red package; those are much sharper and work better in my razors.  These are not bad; they would be fine for most beards.  I have thick coarse hair so I need sharper blades.</li>
    <li> I have enjoyed getting back to a safety razor.  I did have a problem with the razor however.  One morning, I went to shave a found that one of the \\&quot;wings\\&quot; had become unhinged from the razor (one side of the wing).  I was able to reattach it.  I have not problem since that time.  However, it did cause me to upgrade to a better razor.  This razor is a good one to start with being that the price is right.  If you enjoy this type of shaving, then you may want to move up to a better unit; if not you  have spent very little money.</li>
    <li> Gives a good  close shave, could be closer, This is a good blade for beginners.  It would be difficult to cut yourself with this blade yet you will get a good shave. Think I&#x27;m going to try a sharper blade to compare.</li>
    <li> I had been using razors from my local drug store which were not great (generic drug store brand) and Wilkinson Sword. The Wilkinson Sword Blades were not bad, but are only available in my local store in 5 packs, were often out of stock, and are a bit expensive for what is supposed to be a cheaper alternative to cartridge razors. A friend recommended buying a sampler pack from Amazon so I gave that a try last year (120 blades assorted brands for about $22). There were some junk razors, some okay razors, and some very good razors, however these Crystal Super+ were my favorite. Very sharp, very smooth, with no irritation at all. I was very glad when it came time to re-order and found that Amazon carries this brand in a package of 120 for less than I paid for the sample pack. This is a great deal (more than $50 less than buying razors from my local drugstore) and the quality of the razors are superb. I have noticed that people&#x27;s taste in razors is definitely subjective, but for my money I will be using Crystal Super+ as long as they are available on here on Amazon.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve found my double edge razor blade. These blades provide a good balance of sharpness and longevity. I tried Feather and Derby and this falls in between on the sharpness scale for my beard. I get 4-6 shaves before I felt it was time for a switch.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s hard not to give these blades a good review. Sharp, smooth and reasonably priced. These will last me well over a year which is a fraction of what I would pay for any of the ridiculous offerings by the Cartridge Cartel.</li>
    <li> These are actually Israeli Personnas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using Feathers for about 5 years, and I like them fine, however I have extremely coarse, thick facial hair. (Like...1 month of no shaving gives me the better part of a 3-inch full beard...creepy.) I try to shave once a week, and with the Feathers, that means I get no more than 1 shave per blade, because they&#x27;re wrecked after dealing with my fuzz. I also generally had a few cuts or burns from the Feathers, but then I basically ignore all conventional wisdom about how to use the blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With these, I find that one, and most importantly, my shave is FASTER and CLOSER and MUCH more comfortable. Like...no cuts or burns yet and I&#x27;m on about the 7th blade. I can also use the blades more than once without any worries, however I&#x27;m not...because these are so cheap I don&#x27;t really have to. I think if I shaved twice or more per week they&#x27;d last a lot longer yet, because I know my long stubble really tears up all blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway...I&#x27;ve used Darby&#x27;s, Feathers, and several other &amp;#34;must have&amp;#34; brands. For me, Personnas are where it&#x27;s at.</li>
    <li> Blades are all personal preference, but for me these work very well...and you can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
    <li> Pretty sweet!.. I love these blades...</li>
    <li> Razor used: Merkur HD 38C    I have used many different types of blades with my razor and found that there are some where I don&#x27;t get a good enough shave (Dorco), some where I take off the top layer of skin (Feather and Merkur), and some where I get a great shave but the blades are dull after 3 or 4 shaves (Sharp). I have found that the Crystal Super+ is the best of all worlds, meaning I get a great shave and the blades last upwards of 10 shaves. The price is also low compared to the high-end brands. The razors are also held in a plastic dispenser, as opposed to some other brands that are only in a cardboard box. I have also not experienced any quality control with this brand, not that I have seen issues with other brands; every blade gives the same performance as the last.</li>
    <li> One of my favorites. I have a pile of DE blades. These last a little longer than  most.</li>
    <li> I use these in a 1958 Gilette Fatboy and 1967 Slim, both on the 7 setting.  I get at least 7 good shaves with 3 passes.  Never had a bad blade, I haven&#x27;t nicked myself in months (take that, Feather) and there is no pulling(even on the last shave).  These are almost as sharp as the Feathers, but more forgiving and go through my thick facial hair like a hot knife through butter.  Awesome deal!  I&#x27;ve tried Merkur, Gilette, Astra, Derby&#x27;s, Sharks, and Feathers.  These are the best!</li>
    <li> I got tired of using the &amp;#34;disposable&amp;#34; men&#x27;s razors, these give a great shave and are easy on the skin. They last a good while as well. I have sensitive skin and have no problem using these razors. With 120 in a box, you wont need to buy razors for a long time!</li>
    <li> Exactly as described. I don&#x27;t know if they are ACTUALLY the Israeli made blades, but this is definietly a great deal for a quality product (despite the awful/cheap looking packaging). Equal if not better than any Merkur, Personna, or Feather I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
    <li> Bought these based on reviews, and while they are sharp, they do not seem to last very long for me.&lt;br /&gt;I use them in a hot shower, rinse the razor well, dry it carefully, and spray both blade edges with Norelco spray cleaner which has a cleaner and light oil, to try to preserve the blade edges longer.&lt;br /&gt;I still only get 2 shaves at best before I have to change them..&lt;br /&gt;Hope to find another brand that will be as sharp or sharper and last longer..</li>
    <li> I purchased the blade sample pack that I thought had all the best blades on the market and spent a couple of months going through each one (I bought this sample pack: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004UIZFQW/ref&#x3D;cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_14). After going through all the different brands in that pack, I settled on Feather and Blue Birds as my two favorite, with Feather way in the lead. I was about to buy a 100 pack of the Feathers when I stumbled upon these. The Crystal blades were cheaper, and a few of the reviews mentioned that Feather was their favorite until they tried the Crystals. So I took the gamble and I&#x27;m glad I did. These cut cleaner, last longer, and don&#x27;t catch as much as the Feathers do which last only a few shaves. The Crystals seem like they go for about 5-6 shaves before losing any sharpness. So thanks amazon reviewers, you were right.</li>
    <li> My favorite blades.  Sharp, forgiving, long lasting.</li>
    <li> Great buy. Great product. Excellent shave. One blade lasts for about a week and I couldn&#x27;t ask for more than that. Last shave feels as smooth as the first shave.</li>
    <li> For me these are as good (if not better) than Feather or Merkur blades and far less money. This is a great product at a great price.</li>
    <li> So far, I&#x27;ve used a lot of blades, but mainly Feather and Shark, but I decided to but these on a whim. Hands down, the absolute best blades I&#x27;ve ever used. they are just as sharp as Feather, and much more gentle on the skin. you can&#x27;t go wrong with these blades. However, not all blades are for everyone, I recommend trying them, but don&#x27;t get discouraged if they aren&#x27;t to your liking, you can find a blade that will be.</li>
    <li> These are really great DE razor blades. They are very sharp. They last me about ten shaves.  I could probably get more shaves out of them, but at the first time I get a tug on a hair I use a new blade on my next shave.  Depending on your beard, you may get more or less shaves per blade. I may buy more of these and &amp;#34;stock up&amp;#34; on them.  There may be sharper blades out there.  However, these are just fine for me.  I&#x27;m not trying to win a contest over which blade is the sharpest blade.</li>
    <li> Started wet DE shaving in January using Mercur blades but didn&#x27;t like the pulling and tugging of those blades.  Also felt like I had to apply a lot of pressure and do a lot of &amp;#34;polishing&amp;#34; with the razor to get a really close shave.  Ordered the Crystals and am very happy with them so far.  The blade is definitely sharper than the Mercur.  The feel of the blade pulling on my beard is greatly reduced and I feel like I&#x27;m letting the weight of the razor do the work.  I also don&#x27;t have the nicks and razor burn that I had with the Mercur blades.  I still have to &amp;#34;polish&amp;#34; a couple of areas (sideburns and neck) but not as much as with the Mercur blades).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, definitely like the Crystals and will probably stay with them until I feel comfortable giving the Feathers a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, a great move up from the Mercur &amp;#34;starter&amp;#34; blades.</li>
    <li> I was hoping to receive the 120 Crystal &amp;#34;Super&amp;#34; blades made in Israel, but the razors that shipped came in different packaging and are clearly marked &amp;#34;Made in USA&amp;#34;. The razors are acceptable, but I am disappointed a different product than what was pictured and described was sold.</li>
    <li> Great blades, great price.</li>
    <li> I tried twelve different brands of blades, including Personna Red, Feather, Wilkinson, various Gillettes, Derby, and Astra.  These gave me the smoothest shave with the least effort.  I get 4 good shaves from each blade, so the 120 pack is more than enough for a year&#x27;s worth of shaving.  The packaging is excellent.  I appreciate that they don&#x27;t use unnecessary glue on on the paper wrapper, and the plastic blade holder is great for used blades.</li>
    <li> I have used Merkur and Derby blades.  I had a better experience with the Crystal blades because they seem sharper and the price, here, was right.</li>
    <li> I got these recently based on other reviews I saw.  It easily dealt with three days worth of growth on my neck.  They&#x27;re a little difficult to get out of the case compared to Merkur blades, but I&#x27;ll only have to deal with that once a week.</li>
    <li> Love these blades...much better than merkur. And cheaper.</li>
    <li> Very very sharp and one blade seems to last me about a week no problem.  I have given several away to friends all give positive feedback.  This is a great deal!</li>
    <li> Blades seem to be OK, but instead of receiving 12 packs of 10 blades, all I got was one pack of 10.</li>
    <li> Got these on a friend&#x27;s recommendation and was not disappointed.  I get seven shades from a blade minimum, sometimes more, and have a moderate beard growth/hair thickness.  Just do it.  These will last you for two YEARS.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Package may say &#x27;Crystal,&#x27; but you open it up and they are clearly Israeli Personnas and look like the picture. I have tried Merkurs, Derbys, Astras, Feathers, and several Gillette and Personna types, and these are the best value for money.  Feathers are sharper but don&#x27;t always last for five shaves, let alone seven.  PolSilvers and Labs/Med Preps are much more expensive.</li>
    <li> the box was unmarked and non-descript Had to open one just to see that it was just what I ordered.</li>
    <li> NEED TO KNOW INFO : I ordered these blades and they came in grey, black, and red packaging  labeled Crystal Stainless Steel Blades with a sticker on the box showing the description of the correct blades I ordered. I checked on the internet and several people stated that the correct blades were inside. They were right. I opened a box and inside I saw the correct packaging that you see advertised on Amazon. Blue box,blue dotted wax wraper, stainless steel platinum coated etc... These are the blades I ordered as represented on Amazon.They are very good and I am ordering more.</li>
    <li> These are hands down the best blades I have tried. You&#x27;ll find that they do not tug, they are plenty sharp and you can get a good solid week out of them without noticing. I&#x27;ve tried close to 20 different blades at this point and I keep coming back to these. I never nick myself with these and I wind up, after a three pass shave, with the smoothest cut I&#x27;ve gotten since going to double edge shaving. I&#x27;ve also used these in my shavette and they work just as well there. Don&#x27;t screw around with other sub par blades, use these!</li>
    <li> not sharp enough. had to go with Feathers</li>
    <li> Very good blades not as sharp as feather but very close</li>
    <li> Best double edge safety razors I have ever used.  I can use each blade for 10 days!</li>
    <li> Works well, fast delivery and it&#x27;s a great price. No nicks or cuts so far. I&#x27;d get these again without hesitation.</li>
    <li> When I received these I was a bit skeptical because the packaging looks like something from the dollar store, but they deliver.  These were much less irritating to my skin then the Merkurs.</li>
    <li> some what difficult to find double edge blades for the older type razors. Gives a great shave. Happy that amazon had the blades and they are also a good value.</li>
    <li> By far the best double edged blade I have ever used, gives a very smooth shave and it is very economical.</li>
    <li> I must have received and old pack of these in my sampler pack. The ones  I have are not sharp at all. I went thru 4 blades just to find one that I was able to use . The first one I tried to use felt like I was shaving with a chain saw. The second one would not cut across the grain . but didn&#x27;t hurt when with the grain. the third was not as bad. The forth I was able to stand using for 2 shave&#x27;s. But also gave me a close shave , with a fair amount of razor, burn. The second time, I made about five passes to get a half way decent shave. From what I can tell , there isn&#x27;t very much consistency  to these blades. Like Derby&#x27;s.</li>
    <li> I love the Crystal Super+. I tried some blades from a variety pack that even had the Feather in it. I went ahead and ordered the Israeli Crystals because of the many positive reviews. One blade lasted me in good condition for maybe 5 shaves.  I would indeed recommend these blades.</li>
    <li> very close  get proper heavy handle  and shave lightly</li>
    <li> Great blades,fast service.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very happy with these blades. I haven&#x27;t tried that many, to be perfectly honest but, out of the ones I&#x27;ve tried, these are my favorites.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They are nice and sharp and I get about 5 shaves out of each blade. I could probably get more but, I like to swap them out before they get dull.</li>
    <li> They work, they last longer and don&#x27;t corrode as fast as other brands I&#x27;ve tried. They don&#x27;t seem as prone to nick as other brands I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
    <li> i&#x27;ve tried countless different razor blades and these israeli personnas rank as some of the best. for the price, you&#x27;ll be shaving for a long time to come without breaking the bank.</li>
    <li> Ive been able to get 5 shaves out of each blade so far. ( avg 3 passes per shave ) the blades give a super comfortable shave.</li>
    <li> I bought this package simply because it was one of the few -if any- options out there for safety razors. These razors, though, are horrible. Granted, I&#x27;ve only tested four out of the six brands, 9 times out of ten I feel like I&#x27;m cutting the skin off my face. (The other time is only kinda painful). It&#x27;s like one good brand packaged with 5 atrocious one to make a \\&quot;deal\\&quot;. Better deal: find a quality brand and stick with it (the Bengladeshi ones are especially bad).</li>
    <li> Box contains 12 retail packs of 10 blades, exactly as shown.  I like these blades, but blades are a personal thing.  These are the blades describe and shipped fast.</li>
    <li> Item arrived as pictured and quickly!&lt;br /&gt;No problems with my first few shaves so far! Very excited!&lt;br /&gt;Package does show made in Israel.</li>
    <li> Great deal, High quality, thanks...</li>
    <li> Gives me a close shave with very few cuts.  I tried Feather blades first.  They were really sharp but gave me a lot of cuts  Also tried a variety pack of other blades from many manufacturers-- none seemed to be as sharp or were as easy on my face.</li>
    <li> Sorry but they are not sharp enough for me, will be giving them to a friend to try.</li>
    <li> I have very tough whiskers yet sensitive skin especially the neck area.  I&#x27;ve used Feather, Merkur, Personna Blue, and Crystal blades.  So far, this is how I would rate them: #1 Crystal, #2 Personna Blue, #3 Feather, and #4 Merkur.  I personally believe that Feather is much over rated and have found that the Personna blades (Blue &amp; Crystal) to be excellent blades for me.  It is my experience that their low price, sharpness, and longevity makes either Personna blade a great buy.</li>
    <li> I conducted a test of sorts comparing a half dozen brands of safety razors.  I controlled for shaving cream (Proraso eucalyptus and menthol), timing of the shave (after a shower), length of stubble (48 hours), and blade handle (Merkur slant blade), so that the razor was the only variable. Shave quality was assessed for closeness (fewer passes) and comfort (i.e. less nicks). Razor quality was evaluated for longevity and, well, that was it. I mean, what else could you evaluate, packaging? Be serious. Anyhow, at the conclusion of this somewhat lackadaisical several week non-blinded anecdotal study, one safety razor stood out as the superior blade: the Israeli beauties you&#x27;re looking at.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They&#x27;re the best. Buy and be happy.</li>
    <li> My husband is pleased with the price and quantity.  He will not have to look for more blades for a long time and that makes him happy.</li>
    <li> I use a Merkur Razor in my shaving regimen.  I have tried a lot of domestic and imported blades.  These are the best by far.  Even one above the Merkur blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am totally happy with them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;d</li>
    <li> Keeps an edge for a while.</li>
    <li> I only use these now.  Tried 4 or 5 different types. These last 3 to 4 times longer than anything else.</li>
    <li> I like these, they aren&#x27;t too pricey either.</li>
    <li> Ordered one of the combo packs that had around ten different types of blades in it (Few different Sharks, Merkur, Couple of Astras, etc...). These blades were far superior to all of the others that I tried in the package. I HIGHLY recommend these Israeli blades for someone getting into wet shaving.</li>
    <li> I assemble shaving/toiletries bags for teen to young men I mentor. There are several razor blade makes I put into the kits. The personna, feather and others are my choice.&lt;br /&gt;These are made in Israel and packaged in USA.</li>
    <li> I was reading such glowing reviews of the old fashioned safety razors working so well.  I bought these blades with an inexpensive razor on Amazon.  After lathering up the razor moved smooth &amp; nice.  But then I realized there was a stubble and it was only getting half the beard!  After many many passes I got the stubble down to 1/4 of a days growth, not a clean shave like I am use to.  Also I had 3 areas bleeding.  Took 3 times longer to shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am not a quitter, so gave it two more tries the next couple of mornings.  About the same each time.  It was like I had half a days stubble after carefully shaving for 12 minutes.  I don&#x27;t think these blades are very good.  I will say that the design and weight of the razor itself seemed pretty nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Gillette Mach 3 has been my standard for several years.  Going back to it was like the dream shave I remember the first time I tried.  Hands down 10 times better than the old fashioned shaver with the fancy Israeli blades.  These blades brand new shave about as good as a month old Mach 3.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Your results may vary.</li>
    <li> Not the best or the worst</li>
    <li> These blades are THE S***.</li>
    <li> love these razors.  they are superior to the astra&#x27;s</li>
    <li> I have been shaving old school for several years and was using the same blades I used from the very beginning.  I figured a razor blade was a razor blade.  Although I was happy with my old blades, I saw a review of these blades and figured I would give them a try.  I can&#x27;t believe how much smoother they are and they get me closer.  I have a very heavy beard and need the best.  I think I found them!</li>
    <li> I shave normally with a safety razor, these aren&#x27;t very sharp to begin with, and they get dull way too fast.</li>
    <li> These are very, very good.</li>
    <li> I and purchased a \\&quot;sampler\\&quot; razor pack to get an idea of which blades are best for me.  I suggest the same, as different blades perform differently depending on the face.  I personally have light daily growth and am sensitive on the neck area.  Used in a mild razor (like an old school Gillette Super Speed or a Merkur 34c), the Chrystal has been a great performer.  I noticed that the blade has a \\&quot;cleaner\\&quot; look to it once taken from the paper wrapper.  It gave me an exceptionally close shave, and wasn&#x27;t \\&quot;too much\\&quot; with an across-the-grain shave.  These out-performed the Feather blades, which are widely recognized as among the world&#x27;s finest shaving razors.  And may I add that these blades are manufactured in Israel?  Not to get off topic and political, but I was so offended by \\&quot;citizen boycotts\\&quot; in Europe, whereby people walk into stores and remove Israeli made products from the shelves in protest of the \\&quot;crimes\\&quot; committed by that very small, democratic middle-eastern state, that I know try to buy anything Israeli that I need and can get my hands on.  But even without that consideration, these are the best DE razors I&#x27;ve used to date!</li>
    <li> As a former user of the American made Personna&#x27;s, I was a bit skeptical about going to the Israeli made &amp;#34;Israeli-Personna&#x27;s&amp;#34; but I wanted to give it a try. After several uses, I&#x27;ve come to the conclusion that by calling these Israeli-Personna&#x27;s, it diminishes their appeal.  These are far better than the American Personna&#x27;s.  They leave my face feeling smooth as a baby&#x27;s butt.  I&#x27;ll never switch so long as they continue producing these exceptional blades.</li>
    <li> These are really outstanding. I use an old Gillette Slim and since changing to these blades, my shaves have gotten much close without burn.</li>
    <li> &amp;#34;And they shall beat their swords into double edge safety razors.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;Yea, though I shave through the valley of my neck, I shall fear no stubble.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> Although choosing a blade is subjective from man to man, and even from razor to razor for the same man, I really like these blades; they are sharp but no too sharp and are a reasonable price.  My second choice are the Feathers, but these are great.  If I only shave WTG x2 passes, they last me six days, probably seven.</li>
    <li> These are some fantastic blades that balance the need for sharpness without being too sharp leading to nicks and cuts, and last up to a week for me. I could push it, but when these are such a steal, why would I not opt for the better shave of a new blade. I&#x27;ve never had a closer shave with any other razor!</li>
    <li> Perhaps the best double edge safety blade on the market. I have tried several brands.  It stays sharp for several shaves and does not pull or cut like other blades. The only thing they could improve on is the accessibility of the blades. They tend to stick when you remove them from the plastic white case. Overall, an excellent value for your money. I will purchase again.</li>
    <li> I love these blades, they&#x27;re the only ones that do not break my face out. cheap price for how many your great and gives you a very close shave. would recommend to anyone who uses double edged razors.</li>
    <li> The Israeli Blue Crystals are just right.  They are definitely not the sharpest razors available, yet they do not dull as quickly as other sharper blades like the Japanese Feathers.  I have a fairly thick beard, and I can generally get four shaves per razor performing a double pass.  DE razors come in a variety of flavors, and you must experiment to find the right one for your beard.  Before purchasing a particular brand in bulk, I recommend buying a variety pack first.  However, if you choose the Blue Crystals, you won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
    <li> I just started using these blades. I have used astra and dorco in comparison. They shave much closer than the others but they cut my neck on the first use. I guess these and astra are my favorite. I think they are sharper than astra but not as smooth. I will update as time goes by.</li>
    <li> Went to Feather blades immediately after buying these.  Thought these were sharp, but Feather blades are SO much better, smoother and more comfortable shave.</li>
    <li> Not surprisingly maybe taken in consideration that Israeli Dany Schectman is laureate of Nobel prize for discovering quasi-crystals structure that are used in steels that touch the body.&lt;br /&gt;Anyway I founded this blades staying sharp over a long period of time maybe because specialy if you use them every 48 hours you give time to the edge of the blade to recover the shape.</li>
    <li> Super sharp. The Israelis really make a nice razor blade. And Uzis, those are pretty cool too.</li>
    <li> I need to change the razor basically every time otherwise it can pull a bit on the neck. It also depends on what kind of cream/soap you are using to shave with. However in all good value.</li>
    <li> I have been using for a while now and about 30% of the blades are dull or duds</li>
    <li> Great shave, very sharp.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m in the habit of getting sampler packs of blades from different manufacturers.  Out of several packs, covering probably 10 brands, including Feather and Derby, these have been the best *by far*.  Their sharpness makes it easier to shave against the grain, and they don&#x27;t have the tug/unevenness edge I get with some other manufacturers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said, with skill you can get a decent shave from any of the reputable blade manufacturers. These just do it better.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve just several different razors over my first year of wetshaving. These include Feathers, Astra SP and SS, Dorcos, Derbys, Supermax, US Personnas and several others. These Israeli Personnas (crystals) had the best combo of sharpness, smoothness and durability. I typically change out the blade every 2 weeks, though it isn&#x27;t uncomfortable at that point and I shave daily. These are my go-to blades and are worth a try. Highly recommended for a great all around blade.</li>
    <li> These blades are scary sharp... but a little less than feathers (a good thing). I have a thick beard and can usually get about 4 (3 pass) shaves out of each blade. I could take away a star for 1 blade that chewed me up a little due to a rough edge... but then I would have to give a star back simply for the overall quality and value. These are now my go to blades... no need to look any further IMO.</li>
    <li> Very smooth shave. At the same time, find these blades sharper than astra, shark, merkur  (in order of preference). Can&#x27;t comment on comparison vs Feather blades as I have yet to try these. Blades retain sharpness for about 3-5 shaves, shaving every other day using Merkur 34c. Of course YMMV.</li>
    <li> For those of you new to wet shaving, definitely buy a sample pack and try different blades because everyone&#x27;s face is different. The closeness and comfort of your shave is really affected by the combination of blade, razor, and technique. I have been wet shaving for about 3 months with a Merkur. I tried a number of blades including Feathers, Merkur, Personna, Astra, Derby, Wilkinson Swords, and Crystals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For me he Crystals work the best. I like Feathers, but they cost more and if my technique is not perfect, I end up with some burn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Happy Shaving!</li>
    <li> I originally got a pack of these in a sampler kit from an online razor shop and they worked well for my face.  I can make them last almost a week shaving five days a week.  The only complaint I have for this product is the packaging.  I&#x27;ve seen other buyers post photos of their purchase to illustrate that the outer packaging does not look like the inner packaging shown on the product photo.  The black and red outer package had me concerned that I got the wrong item, but it turned out to be correct.  Worry not and enjoy the affordable shaves.</li>
    <li> The savings of buying blades in bulk like this is one of the great advantages of switching to wetshaving.  These blades are gentle when compared to a molecule-splitting job like a feather blade, but they still provide a very close shave with lots less nicks and irritation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a Merkur Futur and these blades do great in it.</li>
    <li> been using derby ,lord platinum,dorco 300, and these are very good. probably get about 5 shaves per blade</li>
    <li> Not smooth at all. Always get cut and razor burns when using it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m working on switching from cartridge razor to safety, and ordered a sample pack of blades to try. Tested Feather, Derby and a few other well known brands. The Crystal blades were the smoothest and appropriately aggressive for my skin, meaning I had fewer cuts with them than any other :) It&#x27;s my blade going forward</li>
    <li> I get a nice, close shave on my legs at a fraction of the cost.  I also can get a couple of good shaves from one blade.  This is just not for men!</li>
    <li> Let me start by saying not all blades were created equal. Just because razor blades all look the same doesn&#x27;t mean they all perform the same. Some blades work well for some people while other blades do not. It doesn&#x27;t mean they are bad blades. It just means they aren&#x27;t the right blades for you. You can disregard most of the reviews on here as they talk about their personal experience with the blades. The best thing to do before you buy a pile of a single brand of blade is try many different kinds of blades. Try to get a sample pack that has 3-5 different brands of blades and see what works best for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I usually get 2-3 shaves with these blades, but that&#x27;s what I normally get from most brands of blades.</li>
    <li> I ordered these blades as I converted to DE wet shaving earlier this year. The first shave that I had with these blades was a little sketchy. I had a few knicks and cuts that I normally do not have, nothing serious that a styptic pencil followed up with some Neosporin could not handle. I am about to have my 6th shave as I have now flipped the blade over, with the first blade from this batch. The shaves have gotten better since the first. I think that the angle of this blade and the way it rides in my Merkur 38C razor might be slightly different than the other blades I used from a sample packets. But I have adapted to the blades and work perfectly fine for my face and beard. I will not be on the hunt for a replacement for these as 119 blades are going to last a long time, possibly 5 years or better since I shave about 3 times a week.</li>
    <li> good blade and good price</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a life long  wet shaver, but recently converted to vintage Gillette DE razors. Upon converting to DE shaving more than a year ago, I was amazed at how brand sensitive the shave quality was and how others have rated blade brands highly that I find completely unsatisfactory. That being said; in my subjective option these blade are a great value, they are of high quality and while not as sharp as Feathers, they are more forgiving to my novice but improving technique.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ratings:&lt;br /&gt;Sharpness  B+&lt;br /&gt;Finish/Smoothness  A&lt;br /&gt;Quality/razor to razor consistency  B+&lt;br /&gt;Value/blade life A-&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 2/04/2013:&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m an everyday shaver with a heavy beard: after shaving with these blades for several weeks with several different razors and shaving creams/soaps my original review still holds true; when using vintage &#x27;heavy&#x27;  Gillette&#x27;s and open comb Gillette&#x27;s these blades offered me the smoothest shave without irritation when compared to the dozens of blades I&#x27;ve used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 2/08/2013&lt;br /&gt;Re-ordered and had some concerns over &#x27;New&#x27; packaging but my concerns were quickly addressed by customer service.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried quite a few different blades. Ones I seem to like best are:  these, Astra stainless steel (not the platinum ones), and Wilkenson Swords, respective order.  I should be set to shave for a couple years for a for a dirt cheap cost.  No nicks, glide/cut the beard smoothly, no irritation.</li>
    <li> I love these razors. They make it like shaving with a magical butter knife that just wipes away the hair.</li>
    <li> 8+ Shaves (rest the razor one day) from the same blade before I see tugging. I love the longevity! And they are brilliantly sharp, yet don&#x27;t cause weepers or cuts like Feathers are wont to do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do strop the blade on my palm both sides before first use (or if it feels dull that day). I would not recommend &#x27;corking&#x27; but I hear some people do that to take the edge off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use an E&amp;J razor plus my Merkur Slant with it. Have also tried them in my Futur, but I don&#x27;t use that often so can&#x27;t comment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used to use Feathers but boy are they problematic and really, inconsistent blade-to-blade. Where Feathers could cause weepers, and sometimes a blade would just feel &#x27;off&#x27; and start cutting the skin all over the place these Crystal&#x27;s are rock-solid consistent performers. Feathers also had that annoying habit of somehow slicing &#x27;under&#x27; the skin (think microscope-slide-preparation slices!) which these don&#x27;t -- they just glide smoothly over the skin, with no force required, and due to their sharpness remove even the finest of hairs (a real pleasure to use under-the-nose where finer hairs seem to find shelter).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love these blades and will never use another. I bought a large pack, comes as a large brown box, with blister packs (individually carded) of Crystal blades inside.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The blades are marked Platinum+ or something. An earlier box I had was unmarked, I wish they&#x27;d go back to that, because, really, when you&#x27;re this good, you don&#x27;t need to show off!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; (I used to use Feathers but boy are they problematic and really, inconsistent blade-to-blade).</li>
    <li> TL;DR - Sharp, comfortable blades that work for two shaves on a thick, medium density beard and sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Compared to Wilkinson Sword  DE razor blades, these blades are less sharp and more comfortable. The Wilkinson blades last me an average of three shaves per blade. The Crystal blades are much more comfortable and I have less irritation. I almost never have any bumps or irritation after. I have yet to have any razor burn with this brand. Also consider the fact that I use a Edwin Jagger De89lbl, which isn&#x27;t very aggressive; these blades perform perfectly for my skin compared to Derby, Wilkinson, and Feathers. Consider that the latter two are sharper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In terms of price, if you have tough skin than Crystal blades are probably not a great value. They last for only two shaves for a dollar less than Wilkinsons. You do receive 20 more blades but consider the math: 120 blades x 2 shaves &#x3D; approximately 240 shaves. Compare this to Wilkinson at 100 blades for 3 shaves or about 300 shaves for about dollar more. In the end, you have about 60 fewer shaves but they are much more comfortable for sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> Real sharp. Best blades I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
    <li> These are my favorite so far (Wilkinson, Feather,Personna). Sharper and longer lasting than the others on my list. The only difference is that i&#x27;m using them in my new Merkur 25c long handle razor with ToBS shave cream,  while I used the other three brands in my old Gillette razors that I saved from the 1960s and Arko shave soap.</li>
    <li> Most comfortable shave I have ever had . smoothest end result also. Course dense wire like beard</li>
    <li> Just aren&#x27;t sharp enough for me. They stay barely useable for several days. Just not sharp enough. Store brand blades were sharper.</li>
    <li> Bought these as part of a sampler pack and they were the best blade in the bunch (not surprising). These give me a shave very similar to using Feather, but with a much lower cost. Understanding that each person can get different results from the same blades, your results might vary. That said, it is worth your time to try these, as they are really economical compared to some of the &#x27;better&#x27; blades out there (such as Feather and Merkur), and can give very similar results.</li>
    <li> Good sharpness and lasts 3 shaves. 1 year worth of blades for less than $20. Great deal.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used these for the past four years and they&#x27;ve been my favorite. I just ran out so I purchased more and for some reason they are slightly different. I keep cutting myself, which is something I never did in the past. They aren&#x27;t bad, just slightly sharper I guess. I would probably still recommend them, but be aware that the might feel different if you have been using them for a while.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;ll hear all kinds of great things about Feather razors (of which I am a huge fan of their Platinum line), which is well deserved. Then again, I have loved the quality of these specific blades at the price I paid. First off, these blades are sharp, much sharper than the American Personnas I tried before these, but not quite as sharp as the Feather Platinums. These are a good mid-ground for a heck of a price. The blades last a week or longer (unless my wife sneaks my razor while I&#x27;m at work) per side and don&#x27;t have the &amp;#34;tug&amp;#34; of the American Personnas carried at my local drug store, and won&#x27;t &amp;#34;bite&amp;#34; you if you are slightly careless like the Feather Platinums have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the package, you&#x27;ll get twelve ten-pack cartridges of blades in blister packs, similar to other blades on the market. There is no difference here than with other blades you&#x27;ve purchased in the past, aside from the ridiculous low pricing on these quality blades for the quantity you actually get. These blades get close, almost as close as that creepy guy on public transportation, but leave you feeling refreshed and smooth rather than dirty and creeped out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, one issue I have with the production of these blades: platinum doesn&#x27;t actually mean &amp;#34;contains platinum&amp;#34;. These blades are coated with one of the &amp;#34;platinum group&amp;#34; metals, most likely powdered palladium or iridium, as these tend to either be more common or less valuable in terms of research labs (as a catalyst) or jewelry making. Not a big deal, since those elements are technically &amp;#34;platinum group metals&amp;#34; and are reactively similar at room or slightly higher (shaving) temperatures. I have yet to have any of these blades rust, so the &amp;#34;platinum&amp;#34; coating must be working.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend these for quantity, quality, and low cost of ownership. They are also recyclable (except for the coating which would likely burn off in the recycling process anyway), as is thepackaging. You honestly can&#x27;t get a better shave at this cost.</li>
    <li> Great balance between sharpness and durability.  I shave 5 days a week (Monday through Friday) and one blade typically lasts me the full week.</li>
    <li> Last for 3 shaves, after that, WATCH OUT!!! cuts like a hot knife through butter on week old stubble but once it has been used too much it checkered my face with cuts like a aerator on a summer lawn</li>
    <li> Very good blades nice and sharp smooth cut really ,I will not use any other.</li>
    <li> As I used more and more of these blades, I found many perfect on one side and so,ewhat dull on the other side. I will say the sharp side is perfect!</li>
    <li> These blades were purchased as backup to my current supply. Being that they were made in Israel I&#x27;m confident they will perform well. I read the comments on these blades as  equal to Personna  and I am comfortable with that.</li>
    <li> Very good but nothing special hence the 4 stars.  MC</li>
    <li> Great, blade, smooth shaves, long lasting.  What a deal.</li>
    <li> So i am updating my review 1 year later..  I oringally thought these were good blades...and some are.  But the blades are so inconsistent.  And even when one does finally get a perfect blade it only seems to last 1 or 2 shaves top.  But most of the blades feel warped to my face, even though they look perfect.  I did use them...all of them...But i will never buy again,</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d been using Derby blades for years and liked them very much, but decided to try these just for the heck of it. These blades feel &amp;#34;softer&amp;#34; on the face somehow and shave beautifully.&lt;br /&gt;The 2nd blade I took out would not shave on one side of the blade so I was concerned about quality control, but several packages later I haven&#x27;t had another bad one.&lt;br /&gt;These have become my favorite blades. I only wish they had used blade capture/storage in the packaging similar to the Derby Extras.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 09/2017&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m revising my review and going to three stars because I find too many that don&#x27;t shave on one side of the blade.  The first time I thought it was an anomaly but it&#x27;s happened so many times since, sometimes twice in a row, that I&#x27;ve become frustrated enough to stop using these before they&#x27;re gone and try another blade.</li>
    <li> Very sharp one of my favorite razors for sure. Oddly they seem to feel better after first two uses.</li>
    <li> These are really superior blades and I am very pleased.  Great shave.  The price is great too !</li>
    <li> Have been shaving with double edge razor for 20+ years using a low end razor with a plastic handle.  Recently treated myself to an all steel razor off the internet with these new blades.  I had been buying Persona blades from Wal-Mart, but they stopped carrying them this year.  I&#x27;m an everyday shaver.  So far, I&#x27;m still on the first blade after 4 shaves.  I typically put in a new blade every Monday morning,</li>
    <li> Perfect blade.&lt;br /&gt;Not too aggressive and still quit sharp.&lt;br /&gt;Great blade for all types of stubble.&lt;br /&gt;This is my favorite DE razor blade.</li>
    <li> great shave!! Enough to last me 6 months.</li>
    <li> Cheap, effective, and a worthy investment for any man with a safety razor</li>
</ol>
