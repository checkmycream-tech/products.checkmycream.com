### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>This is the BEST curling Iron i have ever used !!!!!!!!</li>
      <li>Perfect!  </li>
      <li>Everyone just needs to follow instructions on how to use the hair iron perfectly.</li>
      <li>very good hair iron.  </li>
      <li>I am African-American with type 3b,3c, and 4a in which the iron works greatly on my hair.</li>
      <li>It would have worked great</li>
      <li>I think this thing will be great if I can ever figure out how to use it.</li>
      <li>great product and work good on my hair.  </li>
      <li>loved that you can iron two ways.</li>
      <li>I love this 2-way InStyler!  </li>
      <li>I love my In Styler!</li>
      <li>This hair iron is amazing, and work for all hair types.</li>
      <li>Make curling my hair very easy.</li>
      <li>Especially first thing in the morning.</li>
      <li>2 yrs before the fuse is blown (no complaint about that, 2 years is great).</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not as easy to use as it looks on TV</li>
      <li>The handling isn&#x60;t easy, and the results aren&#x60;t</li>
      <li>I can let my hair air-dry to get nice gentle curls.</li>
      <li>and it looked fantastic - in theory.</li>
      <li>Must be a great product, but because of limited hand-wrist motion I could not use it.  </li>
      <li>I have used the larger barrel InStyler and have always been very pleased.</li>
      <li>I was also able to curl their hair and their hair is all natural.</li>
      <li>Right size barrel</li>
      <li>I tried it right away and my hair ended up poofy.</li>
      <li>My hair is below shoulder length, somewhat fine and naturally curly.</li>
      <li>But I thought I would just try it out because I was excited about my new purchase.</li>
      <li>This will be my second InStyler, so I guess you can say I love it.</li>
      <li>The idea of the brush and the spinning hot iron piece seemed like it was the answer to help straighten and de-frizz my hair.</li>
      <li>I was hoping this device would create big smooth curls</li>
      <li>It is not as straight as it would be if you were to get a relaxer (perm) but it did make the hair silky  and manageable.</li>
      <li>(so, it actually started out smooth).</li>
      <li>This new one, Max, is an improvement on the first one.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not willing to spend any more time using it since I think it will damage my hair.&lt;br /&gt;Disappointing</li>
      <li>as shown on TV, but with a little practise it&#x60;s ok.</li>
      <li>have shoulder length hair with natural wave.</li>
      <li>Also, when I have hair clips in, the pulling action of the InStyler with the brush makes the hair clips come out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I recently cut my hair much shorter, so I  thought I would try the 2-way, 3/4&amp;#34;.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been trying the InStyler for the past several days hoping it would get better.</li>
      <li>I have thick and coarse hair, but the InStyler has always done a great job smoothing my hair and adding a little wave/curl when I wanted.</li>
      <li>The rotating part is confusing trying to figure out which is the appropriate direction when doing different areas of my hair.</li>
      <li>That setting barely did anything but straighten my hair</li>
      <li>I am not giving up on InStyler completely, I will go back to the larger barrel.</li>
      <li>Also, it is very hard to curl hair with it because you can burn yourr fingers easily while rolling hair around the iron.</li>
      <li>So really all I get from this device is straightening with a little turned under or up at the ends.</li>

    <li> very good hair iron.  loved that you can iron two ways.</li>
    <li> This is the BEST curling Iron i have ever used !!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I love this 2-way InStyler!  I started out with the original InStyler one-way rotating barrel and was continually frustrated.  It would have worked great had I wanted to have my hair flip up on one side and turn under on the other.  With the one-way rotating barrel, trying to maneuver the InStyler around without burning myself was almost impossible.  I returned it and purchased the 2-way rotating barrel - what a world of difference!  Now with 2 clicks of the handle, the barrel rotates in the other direction.&lt;br /&gt;My recommendation:&lt;br /&gt;InStyler Max 2-Way Rotating Iron 3/4&amp;#34; for short hair&lt;br /&gt;InStyler Max 2-Way Rotating Iron 1-1/4&amp;#34; for shoulder length or longer hair</li>
    <li> I love my In Styler! Make curling my hair very easy.</li>
    <li> Did not do anything as expected and way too had to use</li>
    <li> I think this thing will be great if I can ever figure out how to use it.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not as easy to use as it looks on TV</li>
    <li> Very disappointed with this smaller 3/4&amp;#34; InStyler. I have used the larger barrel InStyler and have always been very pleased. I have gone through 2 of the larger barrels, usually lasting @ 2 yrs before the fuse is blown (no complaint about that, 2 years is great). I have thick and coarse hair, but the InStyler has always done a great job smoothing my hair and adding a little wave/curl when I wanted. I recently cut my hair much shorter, so I  thought I would try the 2-way, 3/4&amp;#34;. I tried it right away and my hair ended up poofy. I had already straightened my hair previously (so, it actually started out smooth). But I thought I would just try it out because I was excited about my new purchase. But my hair looked terrible afterwards and the smoothness was gone. I literally looked like those commercials using the InStyler, but the BEFORE, frizzy look, not the AFTER. I am not giving up on InStyler completely, I will go back to the larger barrel. But this smaller barrel is definitely NO comparison.</li>
    <li> This will be my second InStyler, so I guess you can say I love it. This new one, Max, is an improvement on the first one.  The bristles are a little longer which helps keep the hair in place while pulling the grip to style.  I have very short hair and I use the 3/4&amp;#34; barrel.</li>
    <li> The handling isn&#x60;t easy, and the results aren&#x60;t as shown on TV, but with a little practise it&#x60;s ok.</li>
    <li> I am a mother of two girls with extremely thick, coarse, kinky hair and I must admit this thing works! It straightened their hair without burning it. It is not as straight as it would be if you were to get a relaxer (perm) but it did make the hair silky  and manageable. I was also able to curl their hair and their hair is all natural.</li>
    <li> great product and work good on my hair.  does just what the video says</li>
    <li> Stil getting used to it</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m always looking for something to help tame my hair. I saw this and it looked fantastic - in theory. My hair is below shoulder length, somewhat fine and naturally curly. The idea of the brush and the spinning hot iron piece seemed like it was the answer to help straighten and de-frizz my hair. Unfortunately, I was wrong. I have a Remington flat iron (which cost half the price) that I&#x27;ve been using for the past few years. I&#x27;ve been trying the InStyler for the past several days hoping it would get better. The comparison...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Is this easier to use? Absolutely not. The rotating part is confusing trying to figure out which is the appropriate direction when doing different areas of my hair. Especially first thing in the morning. Before coffee.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Is it faster? Eh, takes about the same amount of time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Does it make my hair sleeker, shinier, less frizzy? Nope. I don&#x27;t see one bit of difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Does it make my style last longer? Again, not one bit of difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I actually end up using my regular flat iron, then running the InStyler over it (not sure why, just because I hate the thought of having wasted $75, I suppose). Also, when I have hair clips in, the pulling action of the InStyler with the brush makes the hair clips come out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So would I recommend this? No, not for this price. For me, it doesn&#x27;t do any better that a standard quality flat iron. :(</li>
    <li> Must be a great product, but because of limited hand-wrist motion I could not use it.  Also, it is very hard to curl hair with it because you can burn yourr fingers easily while rolling hair around the iron.</li>
    <li> This hair iron is amazing, and work for all hair types. Everyone just needs to follow instructions on how to use the hair iron perfectly. I am African-American with type 3b,3c, and 4a in which the iron works greatly on my hair. The InStyler works for everyone, and all hair types truly!</li>
    <li> I like it but it&#x27;s hard to tell which way it&#x27;s curling.</li>
    <li> Perfect!  Right size barrel</li>
    <li> This device definitely has a learning curve. I could get it to straighten my hair but curls? Not really - just a little turned under or up near the ends. It did not tangle or get caught in my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have shoulder length hair with natural wave. I can let my hair air-dry to get nice gentle curls. I was hoping this device would create big smooth curls but that was a disappointment. I started off at the third heat setting (there are 4). That setting barely did anything but straighten my hair so I tried 4. Whoa - steaming/smoking! Not good &amp; my hair has that burned smell. So really all I get from this device is straightening with a little turned under or up at the ends. I&#x27;m not willing to spend any more time using it since I think it will damage my hair.&lt;br /&gt;Disappointing - In to the trash it goes.</li>
