<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> There is not 1,200 pieces in this wheel. Only has about 150 maybe 200. At the most. I haven&#x27;t tried any yet but they look fine. Just no where near the amount stated.</li>
    <li> all I hoped for thank you so much will shop with you in the future and hope for the same</li>
    <li> I use this product to just do nail designs and art.&lt;br /&gt;The pearls come in different sizes but there isn&#x27;t even that many, shame!  Also the container is quite small.&lt;br /&gt;The wheel access is very neat and the pearls are gorgeous! They have a beautiful color and they look great.&lt;br /&gt;I wish there was more of the product as it said it should have been more than what I actually received.&lt;br /&gt;I received many compliments and I will buy this product again!</li>
    <li> For the price I paid it was worth it. Some of them are kind of big. Overall it&#x27;s really cute.</li>
    <li> Nice selection of pearls to use in this little wheel.</li>
    <li> Good. But too little. Around 200piece.</li>
    <li> These came quickly and were packaged well.&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t count to see if all of the little charms were there but there certainly looks like there are 1200+&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These work well with superglue and a topcoat, just a hint- but they&#x27;re super cute!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommenced this product from this seller.</li>
    <li> Perfect just as described</li>
    <li> It was barley full when I got them, but came faster than expected</li>
    <li> Great but very small pkg. for the cost you can not beat the price.  My customers will love it! Enjoy!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s more less than its described , and there all the same ,not different like it&#x27;s described ...  I got a small heart inside also... there really pretty I&#x27;ll wish it would of been like it&#x27;s on the description</li>
    <li> I was kind of disappointed with the amount of &amp;#34;pearls&amp;#34; I got. I totally understand not EVERY product is the same, still I know for a fact they could have filled the container with more pearls... I don&#x27;t think a got near 120, so I was bummed when I opened it... I guess is a matter of getting lucky when ordering these.</li>
    <li> Came in time and product looks like the picture (may be as not much/full) as shown but none the less its good.</li>
    <li> Thank you i will be purchasing more items like this</li>
    <li> Love love love these!!!</li>
    <li> Like some other said mine was not full like pictured but I contacted them and they where really nice about it and helped me out I&#x27;d recommend ordering from them</li>
    <li> They were wayyyyyyyyyyyy too tiny won&#x27;t purchase ever</li>
    <li> Always a good bargain shopping Amazon but for this price i will buy again pearl rinestones will always be used in nail art and they are pretty</li>
    <li> Pearls are smaller in person but no problem i can wrk with it .</li>
    <li> The other reviews are right, there are definitely not 1200 pieces. BUT THEY ARE JUST OVER $1. You&#x27;re receiving about 200 multi-sized pearls for a DOLLAR. It&#x27;s worth it.</li>
    <li> It said the order could take up to a month to arrive but was here in 10 days.  The tiny pearls are very nice.  I only gave it a 4 star because they are just a bit smaller than they said--more like 2.5 to 1 mm.  Which would actually work better for nail art, I would imagine, but I plan to use them for crafts.</li>
    <li> Perfect for my art project!</li>
    <li> Okay I&#x27;m inlove with these !! They came in three weeks early and they are perfect so far I&#x27;ve used the really tiny one for my nails and I love them a lot of people was complaining that they&#x27;re too small but I think they&#x27;re perfect even the big ones because you don&#x27;t need huge huge pearls on your nails definitely buying another one soon</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t come with 1200 pieces maybe 500 at best</li>
    <li> Product is good they didn&#x27;t send the amount they were supposed to.</li>
    <li> i love these...they are fun to use and make any nail design pop...love love love these! i recommend this to all nail enthuseast!</li>
    <li> Love these will be buying more</li>
    <li> when they arrived they were all mixed up and lots of static,everything was sticking together. I haven&#x27;t applied them to my nails yet as I already have a design on them so I don&#x27;t know how well they hold. They did arrive much sooner than expected</li>
    <li> I get the gel polish and these pearls stay on really well. The only thing is you can tell there are not 350 stones in this container.</li>
    <li> got here quick love it</li>
    <li> Grandaughters are having fun with these doing their nails</li>
    <li> Beautiful pearls all different sizes. I haven&#x27;t used them yet but I cant wait to! Everyone will love these very elegant.</li>
    <li> Good product will buy again</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t used yet but will look good I know special if your attending a wedding or something fancy and classy i can&#x27;t wait to try!</li>
    <li> My container looked like it had far too few pearls in it, so I counted each compartment. (Yeah, I had nothing better to do.)  I received 324 pieces...about a QUARTER the number they advertise.  Yes they&#x27;re inexpensive, but their description shouldn&#x27;t be misleading.&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:  Since I received only a quarter of the product, I requested a refund of three-quarters of the price I paid.  The seller complied and I received my refund.  Nit-picky of me, yes, but this kind of thing really irritates me.</li>
    <li> Decorate those girl Greeting Cards and Scrapebooking with pearl earrings and necklaces. Also, look nice as snow on pine tree branches. I have ordered these twice as the sizes vary and I can pick the size best for my craft project. shipping takes awhile but considering the distance I have always felt they arrive in good time.</li>
    <li> I love them I love all things pearl put the only thing I did like there wasn&#x27;t enough of them and took a little more them a month to get here ..</li>
    <li> These are perfect for any nail art you could imagine doing. Each compartment is a different size and easy to use. Will buy these again.</li>
    <li> Took a while to recieve, they are quiet small but it&#x27;s to be expected for the price</li>
    <li> Hardly any pearls, they were scattered all about the package. Each section was MAYBE 1/6 full and the container was small. HOWEVER what I had of them stuck on my nails fairly well.</li>
    <li> They are really pretty! I kno i can do something awesome with them. And they were under$2 and that price is amazing. Thats the only reason for the 3star rating. The pkg was tiny and there is NOOOO where near 1200 pcs. Not even 200 pcs. These descriptions are blantantly FALSE. That should be crime.</li>
    <li> Top coat ruins the pearl finish on these, so really only good if you glue to the top of the nail.</li>
    <li> Do not buy the product is terrible. There was only 97 pearls in mine.</li>
    <li> They look great and I received them in a timely manor :)</li>
    <li> Came very quickly and they are beautiful! Many different sizes to chose from.</li>
    <li> In the pictures, the cases look so bountiful.  Yet when I look at the few &amp;#34;too tiny to look right on my finger nails&amp;#34; nail pearls, I was extremely disappointed. Granted this was very cheap.</li>
    <li> I love these on my nails , easy to use. There a great buy and just bought 3 more pearl wheels. Great buy !</li>
    <li> OK! The thing is its NAIL DECALS. They will come in a small tiny package. Honestly I keep seeing people saying that they are disappointed in the package being small, but its for your nails you don&#x27;t need HUGE pearls or any other nail decal. Inless you want your nails to look gotty and ridiculous.</li>
    <li> De infinitely NOT 1200 pieces!! Counted and only got 139!!</li>
    <li> i thought there would be a little more pearls and would like to see bigger pearls as well.</li>
    <li> I dont think I would purchase this when I run out cause when I got it the pearls were suppose to be many sizes and there was like only one small size and one big size the color was way to white I expected more of a pearl look and there is not 1200 pieces in it more like 500 or less</li>
    <li> The order was placed on September 7, 2013 and I received it in the maiil on October 7, 2013. I took awhile to get here but it was worth the wait. It came wrap in plastic and no pearls were loose in the plastic. They are really cute, but have not had the time to really put them on as I&#x27;m a nurse but my daughter will soon. I will keep you all updated. Thanks:-)</li>
    <li> the pearls are nothing special just simple flat backed with all sorts of sizes you will find many uses for in designs on your nails.  I haven&#x27;t used them just yet but I will update if my top coat of seche vite melts them to a dull color as it does with cheap rhinestones.</li>
    <li> It was crap it all the same size and theres barley 50 pieces in it . waste of time and money</li>
    <li> Very happy with my purchase work perfectly fine</li>
    <li> Different sizes love that. Only reason I&#x27;m give it a 4 star instead of a 5 is because they took long to arrive but over all great product.</li>
    <li> They came really early. Looked like product described but maybe a little less full than the picture. I can not wait to try it.&lt;br /&gt;Will order again from this seller!</li>
    <li> These arrived much faster than I expected them to. I doubt there are 1200 pearls here, but there is still a pretty decent amount. They&#x27;re really cute and I love that they are different sizes. Great deal for the price!</li>
    <li> I agree with many of the reviews on here. Extremely false advertisement!  My wheel came with about 100 pearls. I will never purchase this item again.</li>
    <li> Came earlier than expected. I didn&#x27;t know how to open it and most of it spilt on the floor, it was more of my fault. Anywho it did some in many sizes but not as many. I didn&#x27;t expect much but it&#x27;s okay</li>
    <li> The container I received is not 1200 pieces. It looks like 100-150 at most. :(</li>
    <li> They arrived in about two weeks, which is fast coming from China.  The problem is that the pic says 1200pcs Nail Art and I doubt if there&#x27;s 100 in there.  Very misleading.</li>
    <li> On time delivery, good product</li>
    <li> There&#x27;s not nearly 1200 pieces in this wheel. For the price that I paid I probably would purchase this again and I wouldn&#x27;t expect 1200 pieces. They were also a lot smaller than I thought.</li>
    <li> The pieces are actually different sizes like I was hoping but there&#x27;s no way there is 1200 pieces in this thing.</li>
    <li> Not as full as picture</li>
    <li> The case it comes in is so tiny, that although I have not counted them, there couldn&#x27;t be more than 100 \\&quot;pearls\\&quot;. As a Nail professional, I&#x27;m a pretty good guess at these things. Also, the material they are made of is so lightweight that the \\&quot;pearls\\&quot; actually get static cling and \\&quot;jump\\&quot; out of their case. I wouldn&#x27;t purchase again.</li>
    <li> honestly i will not buy again. There&#x27;s cheaper ones out there at your local ghetto beauty supply stores i bet. Too bad I found out after i had already bought it from here</li>
    <li> The quality is ok for plastic. I didn&#x27;t have anything to compare them to but I guess they are ok. Hoping that the topcoat will make them shiny.</li>
    <li> They&#x27;re beautiful. Different sizes, different possibilities. So cute.</li>
    <li> great items.  look beautiful when applied</li>
    <li> Cute!&lt;br /&gt;A lot of different sizes these are perfect for nails</li>
    <li> This is a great product. It lasted for a long time on my nails until I changed my design.</li>
    <li> Just received this product today and am very pleased! It looks like their could be about 1,200 pieces in here, the wheel is no smaller then nail art wheels  I&#x27;ve bought at Claire&#x27;s or Sally&#x27;s. This also came in earlier than I was expecting. Very pleased, and if I ever run out, I will definitely repurchase from these people! (:</li>
    <li> Can you cream pearl... nice item. Using for nail art you can use them also for cellphone case and ect...</li>
    <li> I got my order a few days before shipment day. I love the pearls. There is so many of them. I also love the wheel it comes in. There is so many of them. I would recommend them and the price is good.</li>
    <li> There are a lot of pearls in this wheel and you can&#x27;t beat the price anywhere believe me I have searched everywhere locally!</li>
    <li> I only got 582pcs yes I counted</li>
    <li> very very pretty. i do nails and these are very nice and well worth the money. here they cost so much for so little. thank u sherry</li>
    <li> The container itself is as small as my palm &amp; very few pearls are in the container i&#x27;m certain there isn&#x27;t 1200!&lt;br /&gt;This picture doesn&#x27;t look like the product i recived</li>
    <li> They&#x27;re all the same size, and look nothing like they do in the picture, in the picture it is obvious that there are different sizes, but when they arrived to my dismay they are ALL THE SAME SIZE. ugh ):</li>
    <li> Cheap price &#x3D; cheap product&lt;br /&gt;The advertisement says 1200 pearls. Apparently in Chinese, or wherever it came from, 1200 means less than 150. If you only do your own, or a friends, nails occasionally, these might be ok. Unfortunately for me, who owns a salon, this product wont get me through an hour. Really disappointed</li>
    <li> Way small than it looked on the picture.</li>
    <li> Took Forever to come in the mail, it is really small but other reviews didnt include that the product came with 2 containers so i was happy :) Packaging great, quantity 7/10, no damage, again ONLY issue was the time it took to come. (about 2-3 weeks) and if people are mad because they expected more pearls, well you cant expect it to be so cheap with a great deal of quantity. BE cheap GET cheap.</li>
    <li> Cute. Not as full as the advertisement.</li>
    <li> However, that&#x27;s okay!  I&#x27;ll use them for something.  Sometimes it&#x27;s just hard to order items on line when they are not directly in front of you.  It&#x27;s a chance you take.  All in all the beads are very very nice.</li>
    <li> There are only 539 pearls in the package, as opposed to 1200.  They are completely transparent, with very little &#x27;pearl&#x27; sheen, and many are deformed.  Unless you want to use them for practice, I would not recommend them.  They would be excellent for practice, and they really are still cheap for the quantity.</li>
    <li> these have so much stactic i dont dare open them</li>
    <li> Great DIY items!  Really easy to use, cute,and makes just about any nail design pop. Also great price for the amount, &amp; they come in different sizes.</li>
    <li> There was soooo much static that over half either wouldn&#x27;t come out orrrrr flew out when you attempted to remove just one</li>
    <li> They came about the time they said they would. And they do what they are suppose to my only hang up is that there is no where near 1200 in the case maybe 100 -125 tops . To be honest at that price I wouldnt mind the amount I just wish they be honest. No I wouldnt purchase again not because the product or the quality but because the company false advertises</li>
    <li> Got these literally didn&#x27;t expect it.wasn&#x27;t supposed to be here until July 21st but I got it within a week. they look really nice on your nails. will be buying more.</li>
    <li> It was exactly what I wanted...</li>
    <li> I ordered these specifically because it claimed to contain beads of 3 different sizes. All the beads are 3mm. Waste of money. Also nothing like the quantity claimed in the description, 10 to 12 beads in each compartment, so a total of 140 beads at most. See photo.</li>
    <li> Great product. Wish it wouldn&#x27;t have taken so long to receive.</li>
    <li> Very great quality and looks great on nails</li>
    <li> Good quality! :) Would recommend and buy again.</li>
    <li> I only received 100 lil beads..  I went ahead and counted every single Bead.</li>
    <li> There are not 1200 pieces in this kit. Counted 3 sections, and each had less than 30 pearl beads in it. 30 (at most) x 12 sections &#x3D; 360 pearl beads.</li>
    <li> Some have extra stuff on the outside but not that bad</li>
    <li> I got about 100 in there maybe.  No where close to 1200 false advertisement.</li>
    <li> I am very unhappy with this, since is cheap I guess, is the way should be? I purchased 2 wheels and both are almost empty, they are misleading with the picture that is posted, that is  nothing close to what they have sent. See the picture that I am presenting for this review.</li>
