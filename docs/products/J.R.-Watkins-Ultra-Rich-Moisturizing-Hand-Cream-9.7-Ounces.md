      <li>Thanks!</li>
      <li>Watkins products are first class</li>
      <li>It is the first cream that does what it says it does.  </li>
      <li>Still, it isn&#x27;t exactly watery either.</li>
      <li>Would have been much better totally unscented, if they can make it that way.</li>
      <li>It isn&#x27;t floral or perfumy, or even a pleasant smell, so I&#x27;m not sure why it&#x27;s there.</li>

      <li>I take cortisone every day for Addison&#x27;s disease and it has taken a real toll on my body.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very moisturizing.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used that working hands stuff, without much luck.  </li>
      <li>It was moisturizing enough for most areas but not quite enough for some of my drier skin area like my heels.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
      <li>Keeps my hands quite soft in the morning</li>
      <li>SOFT</li>
      <li>When I wrote to Watkins, I received a prompt answer from their customer rep saying that this is an old product that the company has retained for customers who&#x27;ve relied on it for years.</li>
      <li>not very good,  expected better from watkins</li>
      <li>It works very well, costs less, and barely has any odor at all.</li>
      <li>I have dry and sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>THE LANOLIN IN THIS CREME IS AN OLD REMEDY FOR DRY SKIN...</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Watkins products are first class</li>
    <li> W~O~W !!!  This is the BEST hand cream.  I&#x27;m so glad I found it, a friend was telling me about a hand cream by Watkins that had &#x27;lanolin&#x27;... well she was right.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Works very well on my hands.  I always use it because going to bed.  Keeps my hands quite soft in the morning</li>
    <li> This cream is amazing.  I am a massage therapist, so I am constantly washing my hands throughout the day.  Add in all of my free time persuits, such as horses, scuba diving, and yard work...my hands take a beating. In trying to keep my hands from getting chapped and sore, I have tried tons of products...they may boast about relief, I just never received it.  But this stuff works wonders!  It doesn&#x27;t leave my hands feeling greasy (I get enough of that at work) and a little goes a long way.  I&#x27;ll buy this any day over the high priced creams and lotions that don&#x27;t do a thing!</li>
    <li> Best hand cream ever as I work in healthcare with those hand sanitizers that literally split my hands send make them peel every winter so I&#x27;ve tried several. Literally half the price on the jrwatkins website. One of those weird amazon way of base prices.</li>
    <li> Was very satisfied with this product and it lived up to it&#x27;s claim on the site. Would recommend it to others.</li>
    <li> Incredibly moisturizing. I use it all over.</li>
    <li> Great  lotion, not greasy, have used for  years. I would recommend it to anyone that&#x27;s diabetic for daily foot care!</li>
    <li> I think that you should do away with a word min. on comments - This is stupid. I have no more to say</li>
    <li> Great cream for suun burns and dry skin.</li>
    <li> I love this cream.  It&#x27;s whipped and smooth.  It&#x27;s very moisturizing.  And has a light, clean smell.</li>
    <li> My husband is a mechanic and his hands get really bad in the winter and he loves this cream.  He keeps it on his night stand and puts it on every evening  It does wonders for his hands.  His hands crack.  He has helped him tremendously.</li>
    <li> Love it!  It has a mild smell and is very nurturing to your skin.</li>
    <li> the richest hand cream really worth it</li>
    <li> I bought this to combat my hands cracking.  I&#x27;ve used that working hands stuff, without much luck.  Didn&#x27;t use this. It smelled like the lotion my late grandmother used, an issue for a guy. So, I gave it to my mom, who loves it and put away her jar of working hands.</li>
    <li> Very hard to find. I actually use it for my feet as I have diabetic neuropathy. I got a jar of this for Christmas and after using literally dozens of other &amp;#34;wonderful&amp;#34; products my feet look and feel 100% improved. Don&#x27;t ever change your formula, it works wonders!!</li>
    <li> Best cream I&#x27;ve ever used.  Long lasting and not sticky.</li>
    <li> This is an awesome product when you can find it. I reccomend this product. Great in summer time an winter</li>
    <li> I have dry and sensitive skin. It was moisturizing enough for most areas but not quite enough for some of my drier skin area like my heels. Sometimes felt it was just too thin. Still, it isn&#x27;t exactly watery either. Didn&#x27;t irritate my skin. Not sure if I loved the scent. Smells sort of powdery(?). Overall, good product but I still haven&#x27;t found anything I like better then the L&#x27;Occitane Shea Butter Collection.</li>
    <li> A friend gave me a container of this for my son to help with his neck getting chapped when he was a baby. I started using this because I get horrible dry skin and I love it! My skin feels so soft and it doesn&#x27;t take as much as other lotions I have tried before.</li>
    <li> This hand cream works fantastically. It goes on smoothly, dries quickly, and leaves no greasy or sticky feeling on the skin. The only thing I don&#x27;t like about it is the smell. The label lists fragrance as one of the ingredients, but I can&#x27;t tell what it is supposed to smell like. It isn&#x27;t floral or perfumy, or even a pleasant smell, so I&#x27;m not sure why it&#x27;s there. Would have been much better totally unscented, if they can make it that way. It&#x27;s also expensive. My husband uses Unscented No-Crack Day-Use Hand Cream from Duluth Trading Company. It works very well, costs less, and barely has any odor at all.</li>
    <li> Watkins Ultra-Rich Hand Cream contains methyl- and proyl-paraben. When I wrote to Watkins, I received a prompt answer from their customer rep saying that this is an old product that the company has retained for customers who&#x27;ve relied on it for years. They offered me a refund. I changed my rating from one to three stars but wish that Amazon had a comment choice for which there is no rating. It&#x27;s not fair to the company. The cream works at at five start but unfortunately the ingredients are objectionable, and I can&#x27;t recommend it. I have a great deal of respect for Watkins Co. for responding quickly to my email.</li>
    <li> THIS HAND CREAM IS JUST TERRFIC...IT CERTAINLY SMELLS WONDERFUL...KEEPS YOU HANDS SOFT AND IT IS A GREAT MOISTURIZER...</li>
    <li> Great cream.  It is the first cream that does what it says it does.  It is great for cuticles.  My husband has had terrible cuticles over the years and I could not find a cream that would work.  We even used olive oil and it still did not help his cuticles until I started him on this cream.  Now his cuticles are beautiful.  I take cortisone every day for Addison&#x27;s disease and it has taken a real toll on my body.  It has taken all of the nutrients out of my body and my cuticles were almost bleeding everyday until I used this cream (this is not made up, it is absolutely true).  With the help of this cream and the use of vitamins, my cuticles have been restored.  I will never stop using this cream unless it is discontinued.  I also could not find this cream on the Watkins&#x27; websites, Amazon was the only place that I found this cream so kudos to Amazon.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this hand cream for years!  For a while I thought it was no longer available, but was so glad it&#x27;s back again!  It&#x27;s wonderful as a night cream and under makeup cream.  It&#x27;s easy to apply and doesn&#x27;t leave my skin greasy.  Thanks!</li>
    <li> I love that its not too oily,and that it absorbs very nicely! Looking forward to trying some of there other products!</li>
    <li> The best cream ever. Hope it never changes.</li>
    <li> not very good,  expected better from watkins</li>
    <li> THE LANOLIN IN THIS CREME IS AN OLD REMEDY FOR DRY SKIN...IT IS CREAMY AND HAS A NICE SCENT...AND THE AUSSIE SHEEP SHEARERS MUST HAVE LOVELY HANDS!!!!</li>
