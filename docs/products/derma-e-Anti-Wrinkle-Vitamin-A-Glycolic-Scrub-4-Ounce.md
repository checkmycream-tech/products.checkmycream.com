      <li>but my skin is now more balanced.</li>

      <li>I believe you will be pleased.</li>
      <li>St. Ives Apricot scrub, which has a denser solution and rinses more easily.  </li>
      <li>In advertised articles, it states that the formula reveals a healthy, smooth, younger-looking complexion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m a huge fan of</li>
      <li>It is 100% vegan, cruelty-free, paraben-free, sulfate-free, mineral oil-free, lanolin-free, gluten free, GMO-free.  </li>
      <li>Tried this product as a free sample.</li>
      <li>Packaging was secure, and neatly packed, as delivery was timely.</li>
      <li>I like that the scrubby beads aren&#x27;t super fine.</li>
      <li>Smell is pleasant and the grit is coarse &amp; I like the product.  </li>
      <li>not seeing much improvement at all..........off to try the Retinol anti aging cleanser -so far after using a week have really liked</li>
      <li>advertiser states that it deep cleans to remove impurities and reveal a radiant, smooth complexion and a refreshed, healthy glow.</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this product and it doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>My skin feels so soft and smooth after I wash with this face wash.</li>
      <li>As I applied it to my face, and rubbed into my skin for a few minutes, leaving on for 15 minutes, then rinsing my face thoroughly, I found that is an a good exfoliating scrub.</li>
      <li>It makes my skin feel really smooth and clean and doesn&#x27;t dry it out.  </li>
      <li>Not seeing a difference in fine line reduction, puffiness or dark spots area, but the face does feel smooth with dead/old skin removed.  </li>
      <li>Once applied to my face, it did not have a strong or lasting scent.  </li>
      <li>Once you mix in water the gel in the product gets really creamy.</li>
      <li>Very creamy consistency.</li>
      <li>So gentle does</li>
      <li>just tried a sample of Derma e Microdermabrasion Scrub and it is much gentler and non-greasy.</li>
      <li>I would really like this product; as it is I probabbly won&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
      <li>but it was breaking me out too much.  </li>
      <li>It is available for normal, all, normal, and dry skin</li>
      <li>I&#x27;d suggest you use this on wet skin, rub it in lightly and rinse well.</li>
      <li>but if you apply to wet skin it disolves quickly.</li>
      <li>The Facial scrub for Normal to Oily Skin is light beige in appearance, and has small scrubbing beads, that are not uncomfortable to the face while applying, rubbing scrub onto your face.</li>
      <li>I was really surprised to read all the positive reviews here, especially by the people with acne.  </li>
      <li>It actually makes my skin feel hydrated after instead of a tight feeling like most glycolic products tend to do.</li>
      <li>The ingredients include things like apricot seed powder, Vitamin A, Vitamin C, Vitamin E, papaya extract, calendula flower extract, lemon grass, horsetail, sea kelp, glycolic acid and natural fragrant oils.</li>
      <li>I did not receive a reaction to this product, as someone with sensitive skin.  </li>
      <li>Plus its a natural product which is always a bonus!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Do not use if you have sensitive skin.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used various glycolic facial cleansers for years, and I would rate this as the least effective.  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t have very sensitive skin, so be especially cautious about using this product if you do.  </li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t give your skin the fresh, polished look of other glycolic cleaners (such as the MD formulations products) and it doesn&#x27;t even out skin tone.   </li>
      <li>After a week of using it my skin is completely clear, pores look smaller and my skin tone has evened out and my face is glowing.</li>
      <li>It is too creamy and the granules are too big and far between to work.</li>
      <li>This is the only reasonably priced product I have used where I can say that so long as I have used it, not blemishes!  </li>
      <li>I swear by Derma E products so when I found this facial scrub lately I was quite excited.</li>

    <li> leaves my skin looking wonderful and clean. Also prevents acne from appearing!! Plus its a natural product which is always a bonus!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product in exchange for my honest review.</li>
    <li> I love this scrub. It actually makes my skin feel hydrated after instead of a tight feeling like most glycolic products tend to do. Awesome product!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used various glycolic facial cleansers for years, and I would rate this as the least effective.  It doesn&#x27;t give your skin the fresh, polished look of other glycolic cleaners (such as the MD formulations products) and it doesn&#x27;t even out skin tone.   If you like a facial scrub product, I&#x27;d recommend the basic (and less expensive) St. Ives Apricot scrub, which has a denser solution and rinses more easily.  I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product at all.</li>
    <li> I really like the base of this product- it has a nice texture and smell, but some of the scrub granuals are too harsh/sharp. I&#x27;ve actually ended up with small scatches on my face and chest! (Not every time I use it, but occasionally.) I don&#x27;t have very sensitive skin, so be especially cautious about using this product if you do.  If they would grind the scrub a little finer I would really like this product; as it is I probabbly won&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
    <li> I swear by Derma E products so when I found this facial scrub lately I was quite excited. After a week of using it my skin is completely clear, pores look smaller and my skin tone has evened out and my face is glowing. I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this product and it doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin. I&#x27;d suggest you use this on wet skin, rub it in lightly and rinse well. Once you mix in water the gel in the product gets really creamy. I find that my skin doesn&#x27;t feel overly dry after using this scrub. In fact the dryness and peeling I was experiencing has magically disappeared. I live in a very dry region of Washington state and was desperate to find something that would solve the problem I was having with dry areas on my cheeks. This scrub has solved my problem and in only one week. So what is in this miracle working product? The ingredients include things like apricot seed powder, Vitamin A, Vitamin C, Vitamin E, papaya extract, calendula flower extract, lemon grass, horsetail, sea kelp, glycolic acid and natural fragrant oils. Truly this has the scent of lilies and is very pleasant. Using this is also an aromatic experience. Try this for a week and see what you think. I believe you will be pleased. And if you have oily skin you may notice a reduction in oil for some reason. I haven&#x27;t figured out what is in this product that would cause that to happen but my skin is now more balanced. Maybe because I was using a cleanser before that dried my skin out too much. So gentle does it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;~The Rebecca Review</li>
    <li> This is such a great product!</li>
    <li> not seeing much improvement at all..........off to try the Retinol anti aging cleanser -so far after using a week have really liked</li>
    <li> AMAZING!!! My skin feels so soft and smooth after I wash with this face wash.</li>
    <li> I found this too creamy and the granules were too small, quite different from a previous reviewer.  I used it for about 2 weeks but it was breaking me out too much.  I have fairly oily skin.  Maybe it would be good for someone with drier skin.  I&#x27;m going to give it to my mother to try...</li>
    <li> 1st time using this product. Smell is pleasant and the grit is coarse &amp; I like the product.  Been using for 3 weeks with the Vit A/E oil and Vit C oil.  Not seeing a difference in fine line reduction, puffiness or dark spots area, but the face does feel smooth with dead/old skin removed.  Only need to use a dobble &amp; if you abuse that then it could be expensive.</li>
    <li> Tried this product as a free sample. I really liked it so I decided to buy. I like that the scrubby beads aren&#x27;t super fine. I dislike exfoliators that feel like sand. Very creamy consistency. I use it everyday.</li>
    <li> I bought it from another retailer and thought it would be good, however, it broke my face out.  Do not use if you have sensitive skin.  I got a lot of tiny pimples all over my face.</li>
    <li> I was really surprised to read all the positive reviews here, especially by the people with acne.  I found this scrub far too greasy and too harsh to use on my face.  I have used scrubs for decades, although none the last few years.  Some, like Brasivol, had sort of a sandy feel and other, newer ones with plastic microbeads felt very gentle (but are very bad for aquatic life).  This one felt like it had small pieces of walnut shell that scratched my skin.  And it left such a heavy, vasoline-like residue on my skin that I had to wash my face after using the scrub.&lt;br /&gt;I may try using it on my tougher, thicker leg skin, but never again on my face.&lt;br /&gt;I just tried a sample of Derma e Microdermabrasion Scrub and it is much gentler and non-greasy.</li>
    <li> I received this product as a gift from a friend, and I decided to purchase the Derma e Anti-Wrinkle A Retinyl Palmitate cr&amp;egrave;me (see review on cr&amp;egrave;me). The Facial scrub for Normal to Oily Skin is light beige in appearance, and has small scrubbing beads, that are not uncomfortable to the face while applying, rubbing scrub onto your face. It is available for normal, all, normal, and dry skin types.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The advertiser states that it deep cleans to remove impurities and reveal a radiant, smooth complexion and a refreshed, healthy glow. It is a thick cleanser, so much is not needed. As I applied it to my face, and rubbed into my skin for a few minutes, leaving on for 15 minutes, then rinsing my face thoroughly, I found that is an a good exfoliating scrub. My skin appeared clearer removing impurities, while feeling rejuvenated and having a cleaner face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Seller states it exfoliates away dull, lifeless surface cells and cleanses away impurities with this pro-grade refining scrub formula. I agree, I saw a big difference in the appearance of my skin after using this facial scrub. I was pleased to read all the vitamins, and enriching minerals included in this product for the skin; skin-renewing Vitamin A, purifying Marine Plant Extracts, sloughing Glycolic Acid, Apricot Seed Powder and Papaya. In advertised articles, it states that the formula reveals a healthy, smooth, younger-looking complexion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As I stated, in my Derma e Anti-Wrinkle A Retinyl Palmitate cr&amp;egrave;me review, I did not see the difference immediately, after using for a few days, I saw a great difference in my skin. I would recommend this product to others, including Amazon Customers. It is 100% vegan, cruelty-free, paraben-free, sulfate-free, mineral oil-free, lanolin-free, gluten free, GMO-free.  Once applied to my face, it did not have a strong or lasting scent.  I did not receive a reaction to this product, as someone with sensitive skin.  Packaging was secure, and neatly packed, as delivery was timely. According to advertisements, it was previously known as Refining Vitamin A and Glycolic Scrub and Vitamin A Glycolic Facial Scrub.d neatly packed, as delivery was timely.

    <li> That is just the best way to describe it - it doesn&#x27;t do the job. It is too creamy and the granules are too big and far between to work. Do yourself a favor and get the basic StIves one - you can find it in any supermarket.</li>
    <li> I like this product...</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for about a week and I am pleased with the results. My face has a nice glow and it is softer and smoother. The granules are big but if you apply to wet skin it disolves quickly. Will buy again</li>
    <li> Great for my acne-prone combination skin.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a huge fan of Derma e - I use their face lotion and Hyaluronic cleanser every day.  I have really dry skin but thought I would give this a try and it did not disappoint.  It makes my skin feel really smooth and clean and doesn&#x27;t dry it out.  Love this product.</li>
    <li> This is the only reasonably priced product I have used where I can say that so long as I have used it, not blemishes!  (big deal)!</li>
