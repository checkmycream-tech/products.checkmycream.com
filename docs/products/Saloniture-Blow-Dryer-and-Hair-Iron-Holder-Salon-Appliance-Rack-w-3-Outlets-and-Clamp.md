### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>This is not the best thing id recommend for home use on bathroom wall.</li>
      <li>Awesome!!</li>
      <li>Item arrived on time and worked perfect for our use.</li>
      <li>Goes on my roll-about great!</li>
      <li>This is a great product, built sturdy.</li>
      <li>Great sturdy well made item</li>
      <li>Great company well made items.</li>
      <li>Great holder.</li>
      <li>The work well and were a good alternative to sylists using wall outlets.</li>
      <li>Very pleased with iron holder.</li>
      <li>Love this for home use!</li>
      <li>Love this!</li>
      <li>I was unsure whether this would work for my vanity without having to put holes in the vanity, but the included clamp holds it onto my vanity safely!</li>
      <li>Keeps everything tidy and off the counter.</li>
      <li>Nice holder.</li>
      <li>outlet being attached is a nice feature.</li>
      <li>Easy to install too!</li>
      <li>This product would have been perfect if it actually did it&#x27;s job.</li>
      <li>I wasn&#x27;t too sure how to mount it.</li>
      <li>It would be better to use an outlet with the ground hole at the bottom instead of the top (keeping the cord at the bottom).</li>
      <li>It would have been helpful for a picture to show the lip or a description of how the unit basically needs to be hung from an edge or top of something and then attached to the side.  </li>
      <li>Anchors perfect on the side of a vanity table and the extra outlets are a bonus!</li>
      <li>It thus couldn&#x27;t be put against a counter top.</li>
      <li>, then the holder screwed to it (top lip of holder overlapping the top edge of board).</li>
      <li>I would recommend to anyone looking for quality salon tools/equipment.  :)</li>
      <li>Although, if you are using all 3 outlets, the dryer transformer must be at the top, and plugged in up-side-down, in order to plug in the curler and iron.</li>
      <li>So happy with my purchase, my husband is happy to have an empty bathroom vanity.</li>
      <li>Great organization and leaves you more room on your counter to get ready without feeling cluttered.</li>
      <li>Easy to install.</li>
      <li>easy to install.</li>
      <li>Strong and sturdy too.</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s fine.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s sleek, stylish, the plug ins work well and the sizes are great as long as you have a skinny straightener.  </li>
      <li>Quick delivery!  </li>
      <li>the anchor below would fit perfectly when adjusted to fit tight.</li>
      <li>I use it every day and fit&#x27;s all my tools</li>
      <li>For what I did to fit on my table was instead of using both screws for the anchor bar</li>
      <li>But that being said, it&#x27;s very useful and keeps things organized.</li>
      <li>this is a great product, everything I wanted...now my blow dryer and flat iron are not laying in the sink and</li>
      <li>Excited to install for at home use.  </li>
      <li>Overall good product.</li>
      <li>you don&#x27;t need to worry about your cords not reaching to a certain point!!  </li>
      <li>Exactly what I wanted!</li>
      <li>Once I found a solution to that, it does exactly what I needed!.</li>
      <li>It has a circular top that doesn&#x27;t grip anything accurately and there is no way I could figure out to actually attach it to the holder.</li>
      <li>It would be nice to have a few more feet of electrical cord, but I still recommend this product.</li>
      <li>We repaired it ourselves so we didn&#x27;t have to wait for a replacement because we needed it right away.</li>
      <li>I ended up just drilling it right onto my makeup counter.</li>
      <li>Looks good on our bathroom counter and cleans up the mess.  </li>
      <li>It is exactly what I had hoped for.</li>
      <li>The mounting bar (the flat metal bar that all of the holders are mounted to) has a lip on the top of it.  </li>
      <li>Other reviewers have warned about the mounting lip, but I am very handy and can generally make these things work.</li>
      <li>The problems are; the screws don&#x27;t fit, even if it feels like they are tightening up, the velcro is kind of weak since the design flaw is the top lip that goes over the flat surface of whatever you attach it to, is bent at a downwards angle and pushes the product away from the side of your counter/vanity.</li>
      <li>The backer board, being smaller than the bracket, was easily concealed.</li>
      <li>and I was super surprised how fast is was at my door.</li>
      <li>There is a lip on the back so that when mounting it won&#x27;t fit flush to the wall.</li>
      <li>This makes it really unstable</li>
      <li>VERY sturdy and fits my hair dryer, curling iron and straightener.</li>
      <li>the bathroom counter top is less cluttered.  </li>
      <li>I picked this one particularly in mind not to mount to the wall, but to clamp onto the side of my vanity.</li>
      <li>It gives them a little more reach with their blow dryer.</li>
      <li>Versitile but the extra variety of mounting options kind of make it more complicated for themselves.</li>
      <li>On the positive, it looks like it is solidly built and is really going to serve our purpose - keeping mom&#x27;s tools up and away from the toddlers!&lt;br</li>
      <li>At first I thought it was to sit on the side of a counter, but it&#x27;s not a proper angle for that.  </li>
      <li>very heavy but love it</li>
      <li>I used a black magic marker on the one end of the backer board you would see prior to installing</li>
      <li>It tilts out far and items are all in counter space.</li>
      <li>Even the tool to clamp it to a side of a vanity is ugly and won&#x27;t work unless your vanity or salon cart has a thin top that extends outward a great deal!</li>
      <li>Since the lip on the holder prevented it from hanging straight on the wall, a small 3/4&amp;#34; backer board was screwed to the wall first</li>
      <li>Large lip on top making it impossible to put flush against wall and nowhere to tuck away hair tools wires.  </li>
      <li>This way the transformer can be plugged into the bottom receptacle, hanging straight down, leaving room for the smaller 2 cords above.</li>
      <li>I wanted to mount it to the side of the cabinet using screws, but the screws included were not long enough to get through the screw holes, the gap created by aforementioned lip.  </li>

    <li> No problem installing.  Keeps everything tidy and off the counter.</li>
    <li> Looks good on our bathroom counter and cleans up the mess.  Not sure what the clamp that came with it is for, since it doesn&#x27;t match up with any of the screws, but who cares, the product does what it is suppose to do.</li>
    <li> I purchased 2 of these for a two sided station and one arrived with the wires exposed just below the outlets. We repaired it ourselves so we didn&#x27;t have to wait for a replacement because we needed it right away. The work well and were a good alternative to sylists using wall outlets. It gives them a little more reach with their blow dryer.</li>
    <li> So happy with my purchase, my husband is happy to have an empty bathroom vanity. Order came in a timely fashion.</li>
    <li> This product would have been perfect if it actually did it&#x27;s job. I picked this one particularly in mind not to mount to the wall, but to clamp onto the side of my vanity. It&#x27;s sleek, stylish, the plug ins work well and the sizes are great as long as you have a skinny straightener.  The problems are; the screws don&#x27;t fit, even if it feels like they are tightening up, the velcro is kind of weak since the design flaw is the top lip that goes over the flat surface of whatever you attach it to, is bent at a downwards angle and pushes the product away from the side of your counter/vanity.

    <li> This is not the best thing id recommend for home use on bathroom wall. It tilts out far and items are all in counter space. It&#x27;s not very appealing like this.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I wanted! VERY sturdy and fits my hair dryer, curling iron and straightener. I bolted mine to my vanity dresser where all my make up is. The ledge it gives you to stick down the device doesn&#x27;t lay correctly; as other review indicated before I purchased-- But I actually prefer that I bolted it in because I know it is sturdy and it wasn&#x27;t going to be placed anywhere else anyway. Great organization and leaves you more room on your counter to get ready without feeling cluttered.</li>
    <li> Item arrived on time and worked perfect for our use. Easy to install too!</li>
    <li> Great holder. For my application, I mounted mine on the wall next to a vanity. Since the lip on the holder prevented it from hanging straight on the wall, a small 3/4&amp;#34; backer board was screwed to the wall first, then the holder screwed to it (top lip of holder overlapping the top edge of board). The backer board, being smaller than the bracket, was easily concealed. I used a black magic marker on the one end of the backer board you would see prior to installing it.&lt;br /&gt;The outlet being attached is a nice feature. Although, if you are using all 3 outlets, the dryer transformer must be at the top, and plugged in up-side-down, in order to plug in the curler and iron. It would be better to use an outlet with the ground hole at the bottom instead of the top (keeping the cord at the bottom). This way the transformer can be plugged into the bottom receptacle, hanging straight down, leaving room for the smaller 2 cords above.</li>
    <li> I ordered this item because I was tired of fighting multiple cords and the storage issue of multiple hair care appliances (home application). Although it doesn&#x27;t show in the pic, there is a lip on the back which makes it difficult for flat surface mounting. Once I found a solution to that, it does exactly what I needed!.</li>
    <li> This is a great product, built sturdy. It would be nice to have a few more feet of electrical cord, but I still recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I was unsure whether this would work for my vanity without having to put holes in the vanity, but the included clamp holds it onto my vanity safely!</li>
    <li> The mounting bar (the flat metal bar that all of the holders are mounted to) has a lip on the top of it.  At first I thought it was to sit on the side of a counter, but it&#x27;s not a proper angle for that.  There were no instructions included and I could not figure out what it was meant for.  I wanted to mount it to the side of the cabinet using screws, but the screws included were not long enough to get through the screw holes, the gap created by aforementioned lip.  I used one screw on the bottom hole and got it in just enough to hold it in place.  It works.</li>
    <li> On the positive, it looks like it is solidly built and is really going to serve our purpose - keeping mom&#x27;s tools up and away from the toddlers!&lt;br /&gt;However, I couldn&#x27;t tell from the pictures what others were referring to when they mentioned the mounting issues.  It would have been helpful for a picture to show the lip or a description of how the unit basically needs to be hung from an edge or top of something and then attached to the side.  I will make it work, but that lip serves no purpose for mounting to a wall.  Also, one of the holders was missing paint - not a big enough deal to return, but for the price it should be completely coated and/or packaged well enough to arrive that way.</li>
    <li> Other reviewers have warned about the mounting lip, but I am very handy and can generally make these things work. I wanted to attach to the edge of my counter in the bathroom. I thought the mounting lip would help it rest there and the clamp would be used in the worst case. NOPE, the lip does&#x27;t just stick out, its at an approximately 45 degree angle instead of the 90 degree I expected. It thus couldn&#x27;t be put against a counter top. When what about the clamp? Its just thrown in there. It has a circular top that doesn&#x27;t grip anything accurately and there is no way I could figure out to actually attach it to the holder. The metal base is to wide to affix to the front where the two holes are, and the metal lip prevents it from being able to be attached in the back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are not buying this to attach to a salon cart, do not buy it.</li>
    <li> Quick delivery!  Excited to install for at home use.  Convenient space saver!</li>
    <li> There is a lip on the back so that when mounting it won&#x27;t fit flush to the wall. Just get some longer screws and it&#x27;s fine.</li>
    <li> this is a great product, everything I wanted...now my blow dryer and flat iron are not laying in the sink and the bathroom counter top is less cluttered.  easy to install.</li>
    <li> Great sturdy well made item and I was super surprised how fast is was at my door. Great company well made items. I would recommend to anyone looking for quality salon tools/equipment.  :)</li>
    <li> Nice holder. Does need board behind it to hang on flat surface.</li>
    <li> very heavy but love it</li>
    <li> Love this! Goes on my roll-about great! I use it every day and fit&#x27;s all my tools and you don&#x27;t have to worry about burning the table and an outlet!! you don&#x27;t need to worry about your cords not reaching to a certain point!!  It has a Hook so you can move it to either sides of the roll-about. Awesome!!</li>
    <li> Terrible!  Large lip on top making it impossible to put flush against wall and nowhere to tuck away hair tools wires.  They are all over the place.  Even the tool to clamp it to a side of a vanity is ugly and won&#x27;t work unless your vanity or salon cart has a thin top that extends outward a great deal! Find another one!!! TRUST ME!</li>
    <li> Versitile but the extra variety of mounting options kind of make it more complicated for themselves. Hard to explain, but the versitility creates complexity here. Overall good product.</li>
    <li> Anchors perfect on the side of a vanity table and the extra outlets are a bonus! Fits my flat iron and curling wand and blow dryer without the end attachment if you use one! Easy to install. For what I did to fit on my table was instead of using both screws for the anchor bar I slid it down and only utilized the one which was still solid enough to hold so the anchor below would fit perfectly when adjusted to fit tight. Love this for home use! Strong and sturdy too. Won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
    <li> Very pleased with iron holder. It is exactly what I had hoped for.</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t too sure how to mount it. Very difficult to understand instructions. I ended up just drilling it right onto my makeup counter. But that being said, it&#x27;s very useful and keeps things organized. It doesn&#x27;t hold ALL of my hair styling equipment but it holds the necessities: blow dryer, straightener and curler</li>
