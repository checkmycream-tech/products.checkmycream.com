      <li>I super recommend it!!!!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m happy with the texture.</li>
      <li>but i was extremely happy when i saw it on here.</li>
      <li>This is probably a good product, but it did not work for my fair skin.</li>
      <li>It is so paste-y that you need a good primer to even use it.  </li>
      <li>Which is why I LOVE this stuff!</li>
      <li>I like to use my own brush to apply the cream.</li>
      <li>The concealer twin&#x27;s formula is so great that I don&#x27;t have to wear any foundation afterwards because it does such a great job evening out my skin tone.</li>
      <li>You&#x27;re better off taking primer from the brush and applying it by hand.</li>
      <li>This product does an okay job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I think a pump bottle would be more sanitary.</li>
      <li>but I ended up with a pasty look, even with makeup on top of it.</li>
      <li>Of course using foundation adds color as well as more coverage when needed.</li>
      <li>and this is still my favorite \\&quot;foundation.\\&quot;  </li>
      <li>I do have a couple of spots that require concealer, and I&#x27;m still looking for a good one to layer with this primer and my foundation, but overall I am thrilled with this product.</li>
      <li>It goes on smoothly sometimes</li>
      <li>As for the product, it goes on smoothly.</li>
      <li>What I love is that it tones down the redness very nicely.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;d definitely give this a try, but be warned if you have fair skin: it might wash out all your color.</li>
      <li>I have fair skin, and this product did work at taking the &#x27;red&#x27; out.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Thank goodness I was forced by circumstances to give it a try, because for me it&#x27;s a perfect product.  </li>
      <li>Product arrived quickly after ordering.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t cover super well either.</li>
      <li>As such, it does an OK job, but does not leave my face feeling as silky smooth as a comparably priced product by Smashbox available at Ulta.  </li>
      <li>Overall not a bad product, however make sure not to apply too much as it becomes more visible throughout the day.</li>
      <li>Oh and the SPF is mineral (Titanium Dioxide and Zinc Oxide) which make it even better for my sensitive skin since I can&#x27;t wear chemical sunscreens.</li>
      <li>So far I everything else I&#x27;ve tried provides more coverage than I need or doesn&#x27;t brighten like this does.  </li>
      <li>The make up stays right in place without smudging or anything...</li>
      <li>I was unfamiliar with this product when I first found it at the store.</li>
      <li>I love this concealer for the red splotches on my skin</li>
      <li>The red however is still mostly gone.</li>
      <li>/&gt;You could probably find a better product for your money, and I&#x27;ll be trying something else next time.</li>
      <li>I decided to buy this after reading the positive reviews here on Amazon.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s better than I would have expected and much cheaper than the Smashbox one that I considered buying!</li>
      <li>This stuff is amazing at getting rid of the redness and to add a little color all I need is some tinted powder.</li>
      <li>The only problem that I have is that the coverage is light.</li>
      <li>This didn&#x27;t really help me at all with my redness.</li>
      <li>The brush that you apply it with really irritated the parts of my skin with rosacea.</li>
      <li>My face had just s much redness after I used it and added a foundation.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t need a lot of coverage and this is very lightweight.  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t really care for the brush.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used yellow ones with better results, but still don&#x27;t want to have to cover my whole face in yellow concealer before putting on foundation.</li>
      <li>As I&#x27;ve gotten older, my face has spots that have gotten redder and I can&#x27;t afford laser treatments for it yet.</li>
      <li>Makes the skin look fresh the whole entire day!</li>
      <li>Great for hiding red uneven skin tones I can no longer find this in my local stores</li>
      <li>I started using Nyx green concealer and it works so much better.</li>
      <li>My favorite product from physicians formula is their concealer twin that has both the green blemish cream and the foundation.</li>
      <li>I have the orange primer, and that seems to go better with my pale skin.</li>
      <li>I used the phrase \\&quot;brightens twice\\&quot; in my review title because not only does it brighten my skin, but it really brightens my mood, too.  </li>
      <li>It worked so well that it completely sapped all color from my face.</li>
      <li>(to 1/8/12 review):  November 2014 ... coming up on nearly 3 years</li>
      <li>I use Sephora green primer and wanted to purchase something that would fit in my budget.</li>
      <li>and it takes several clicks for any of the primer to come up, and then it&#x27;s too much.</li>
      <li>I have really sensitive skin</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t think it possible, but I was actually more pale without the redness to begin with.</li>
      <li>My face is red in color, but when I wear this it seems to dry out quickly</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very lightweight and sheer enough to use alone, so I don&#x27;t put anything over it except blush (talc-free Physician&#x27;s Formula).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Most of the time I look like pale tomato, other times I look like a lobster.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t work well for lessening the redness of blemishes either, just for general redness.</li>
      <li>but my face is constantly red and is overly sensitive.</li>
      <li>It layers well underneath my Bare Minerals foundation.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s more thin and oily too.</li>
      <li>I know that this product was responsible because i ran out about a week and a half ago</li>
      <li>I got a little too heavy handed with it my first use and the spots where I put too much primer on, the foundation clung to.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used green concealers in the past with mixed results, mostly I looked like I had a greenish cast to my skin.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I love this concealer for the red splotches on my skin</li>
    <li> I decided to buy this after reading the positive reviews here on Amazon. My face is always red. Most of the time I look like pale tomato, other times I look like a lobster. I don&#x27;t have rosacea but my face is constantly red and is overly sensitive. I usually wear a medium to full coverage foundation, but I hate that I look like I&#x27;m wearing a mask, so most of the time I just live with the fact that my face is red. As I&#x27;ve gotten older, my face has spots that have gotten redder and I can&#x27;t afford laser treatments for it yet. So I decided to give this product a try. I&#x27;ve used green concealers in the past with mixed results, mostly I looked like I had a greenish cast to my skin. I&#x27;ve used yellow ones with better results, but still don&#x27;t want to have to cover my whole face in yellow concealer before putting on foundation. Which is why I LOVE this stuff! It&#x27;s sheer yet tones down the redness quite a bit without any irritation. It layers well underneath my Bare Minerals foundation. It is not a concealer though. I got a little too heavy handed with it my first use and the spots where I put too much primer on, the foundation clung to. Putting a thin even layer on evens out my skin so much so that on days I don&#x27;t feel like wearing makeup, this is all I put on. I almost don&#x27;t even need foundation now! I do have a couple of spots that require concealer, and I&#x27;m still looking for a good one to layer with this primer and my foundation, but overall I am thrilled with this product. It&#x27;s better than I would have expected and much cheaper than the Smashbox one that I considered buying! Definitely will be buying and using this for as long as they make it! Oh and the SPF is mineral (Titanium Dioxide and Zinc Oxide) which make it even better for my sensitive skin since I can&#x27;t wear chemical sunscreens.</li>
    <li> That never came out of the container had to tear it apart and rip it open with a screwdriver just to get the contents out</li>
    <li> This works for covering up red spots on face.  I would recommend it to anyone who has a problem.  Product arrived quickly after ordering.</li>
    <li> Physicians Formula correcting primer is made to be worn underneath, or as a base, for mineral makeup powder.  As such, it does an OK job, but does not leave my face feeling as silky smooth as a comparably priced product by Smashbox available at Ulta.  I would not buy this product again.</li>
    <li> I have really sensitive skin and this doesn&#x27;t cause me to break out at all. The only problem that I have is that the coverage is light.</li>
    <li> I have fair skin, and this product did work at taking the &#x27;red&#x27; out. It worked so well that it completely sapped all color from my face. I didn&#x27;t think it possible, but I was actually more pale without the redness to begin with. This is probably a good product, but it did not work for my fair skin. I have the orange primer, and that seems to go better with my pale skin. As for the product, it goes on smoothly. It takes me a quite a few clicks in order to get the product flowing correctly. I&#x27;d definitely give this a try, but be warned if you have fair skin: it might wash out all your color.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m reviewing the Physician&#x27;s Formula Mineral Wear Talc-Free correcting primer in Pink.  I&#x27;ve used Nude before and found it worked well to even out my skin tone.  My skin, which is fair with pink undertones, is showing it&#x27;s age with some unevenness and even looking a bit tired and dull.  Buying this product in Pink seemed counter intuitive... but it was on sale at a local store for only a few dollars and the Nude was not in stock, so I figured I&#x27;d give the Pink a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was amazed at the difference in the look of my skin when I applied this product.  It evens out my skin tone as well as the Nude did, and it also visibly brightens.  I used the phrase \\&quot;brightens twice\\&quot; in my review title because not only does it brighten my skin, but it really brightens my mood, too.  A stroke of the brush, a little blending, and my skin goes from looking like it wants to crawl back under the covers to looking wide awake and lively!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank goodness I was forced by circumstances to give it a try, because for me it&#x27;s a perfect product.  It&#x27;s very lightweight and sheer enough to use alone, so I don&#x27;t put anything over it except blush (talc-free Physician&#x27;s Formula).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDIT (to 1/8/12 review):  November 2014 ... coming up on nearly 3 years and this is still my favorite \\&quot;foundation.\\&quot;  I&#x27;ve tried other products but always come back to this one.  I don&#x27;t need a lot of coverage and this is very lightweight.  So far I everything else I&#x27;ve tried provides more coverage than I need or doesn&#x27;t brighten like this does.  Just wanted to provide this update because I often wonder, when reading reviews, if the product continued to deliver over time.  For me, this one has.  I just wish they&#x27;d repackage without the weird brush!</li>
    <li> Great for hiding red uneven skin tones I can no longer find this in my local stores</li>
    <li> My favorite product from physicians formula is their concealer twin that has both the green blemish cream and the foundation. I run out of the green cream fast so I decided to get this hoping it would be the same thing. Unfortunately the cream is a lighter green and isn&#x27;t as thick as I had hoped. The concealer twin&#x27;s formula is so great that I don&#x27;t have to wear any foundation afterwards because it does such a great job evening out my skin tone. With this product I have to wear foundation afterwards. It&#x27;s more thin and oily too. Also the brush that comes attached just gets in the way. I like to use my own brush to apply the cream.</li>
    <li> Makes the skin look fresh the whole entire day! The make up stays right in place without smudging or anything... I super recommend it!!!!</li>
    <li> Wonderful product.  It goes on smoothly sometimes, I don&#x27;t need to follow up with my foundation.</li>
    <li> I have rosaea and this product covers up the redness well.  It was recommended by my dermatologist.</li>
    <li> I use Sephora green primer and wanted to purchase something that would fit in my budget. My face is red in color, but when I wear this it seems to dry out quickly but it does cover the redness. I can still use the product but would have to use primer for moisture. I don&#x27;t really care for the brush.</li>
    <li> I was hesitant to buy this because of the reviews complaining how pasty and pale it makes the skin look. This stuff is amazing at getting rid of the redness and to add a little color all I need is some tinted powder. Of course using foundation adds color as well as more coverage when needed. This product is a primer and isn&#x27;t intended to be used alone.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like it. Doesn&#x27;t do anything with redness and doesn&#x27;t blend in skin well, cakes up.</li>
    <li> This didn&#x27;t really help me at all with my redness.</li>
    <li> Overall not a bad product, however make sure not to apply too much as it becomes more visible throughout the day. P.S. it&#x27;s really green, if your skin naturally doesn&#x27;t have a pink shade, i wouldn&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
    <li> The brush that you apply it with really irritated the parts of my skin with rosacea. It doesn&#x27;t cover super well either. I started using Nyx green concealer and it works so much better.</li>
    <li> I was unfamiliar with this product when I first found it at the store. I couldn&#x27;t tell from the packaging if it was liquid or powder! The only hint that it was liquid was the \\&quot;flow thru brush\\&quot;. I purchased it in green but just found it to be too green. It did reduce redness but I ended up with a pasty look, even with makeup on top of it. I also don&#x27;t like the brush applicator.... I think a pump bottle would be more sanitary.</li>
    <li> This product does an okay job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The applicator leaves a lot to be desired-- the brush  doesn&#x27;t apply the product well and it takes several clicks for any of the primer to come up, and then it&#x27;s too much. You&#x27;re better off taking primer from the brush and applying it by hand. It doesn&#x27;t work well for lessening the redness of blemishes either, just for general redness. It also feels tacky on my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You could probably find a better product for your money, and I&#x27;ll be trying something else next time.</li>
    <li> My face has always been a little red and dry and has frequent acne but since I&#x27;ve gotten this its not as red or dry and my acne is basically nonexistent . I know that this product was responsible because i ran out about a week and a half ago and my skin is dry and my acne is coming back. The red however is still mostly gone. Unfortunately i can&#x27;t find it in stores anymore but i was extremely happy when i saw it on here. I bought 2 and im getting expedited shipping, its that good! Makes my life a little less stressful without having to worry about my skin.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t get this stuff?!?!  It is so paste-y that you need a good primer to even use it.  I might save it and do that, or I might just toss it.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t like this product at all.</li>
    <li> This product did nothing to minimize the redness of my skin.  My face had just s much redness after I used it and added a foundation.</li>
    <li> What I love is that it tones down the redness very nicely. I&#x27;m happy with the texture. Don&#x27;t need the brush, though.</li>
