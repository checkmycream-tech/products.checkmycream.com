      <li>Good quality and highly recommended.</li>
      <li>The first time I tried this stuff it was AMAZING.  </li>
      <li>don&#x27;t dip the wet brush in the cream jar or you&#x27;ll dilute it -- and shave with a clean, double-edged blade razor (Gillette used to make superb ones, look in antique stores for one).</li>

      <li>If you have never used an alum block as an after shave or even a deoderant, this is a fantastic product.</li>

      <li>Finish with a light coating of L&#x27;Occitane Cade After-Shave Balm.</li>
      <li>and it comes in a cheap box, which means you&#x27;ll have to find a case.</li>
      <li>IMPORTANT:</li>
      <li>, it works like it&#x27;s supposed to and has a smooth surface as it glides across your freshly shaven face.</li>
      <li>cool razor burn after shaving.</li>
      <li>This works great on irritated skin and the block has lasted me 6 months, and will last much longer.&lt;br</li>
      <li>And your partner will appreciate the smooth, gentle results.</li>
      <li>which surprised me as I understood that a styptic pencil is made up mostly of Alum.</li>
      <li>I do believe it will continue to be useful for another 2 years though.</li>
      <li>Read up on alum blocks and decided to get this one due to TOBS shaving cream being so good.</li>
      <li>Great small block of alum</li>
      <li>It does sting a little on application, however it is more of a refreshing feeling than pain.  </li>
      <li>It stops the bleeding for cuts and cures my redness pretty well</li>
      <li>Face is left feeling great after this, and no sensitive feeling at all!</li>
      <li>It is very small, but works great.  </li>
      <li>Use a gentle astringent based on witch hazel, or an after shave balm, with both antiseptic benefits and moisturizers to protect the skin, or ... as I do regularly, wet your face with lots of handfuls of warm water, then gently rub this block over your shaved areas (stay away from the eyes, of course).</li>
      <li>(if you have dry skin, splash with a bit more warm water before toweling off), and moisturize (after using this an alum block, any conventional moisturizer for your skin type will suffice).</li>
      <li>Make sure to dry it off after each use.</li>
      <li>(Just make sure you keep it dry between uses.  </li>
      <li>I highly recommend this for everyone who shaves but it would be especially useful to younger people with sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>Very high quality alum block.</li>
      <li>If you find a cheaper brand it is OK, there are not much differences between them.</li>
      <li>This is an alum block like many other alum blocks.</li>
      <li>Furthermore, at this price it would be nice if there was a small case to keep it in after using.</li>
      <li>If you&#x27;re new to using a safety razor or straight razor to shave, you must get an alum block to stop up all the nicks you&#x27;re undoubtedly going to shave into your face.  </li>
      <li>It is important to thoroughly dry this block off after use to prevent it from melting away.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s easy to just wet the block and rub the block over the face.  </li>
      <li>Highly recommended.</li>
      <li>my husband has sensitive skin and this has really helped.</li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t splash any alcohol-based aftershave on your newly mown face.</li>
      <li>Being new to DE shaving</li>
      <li>Tiny bar, can get more for less elsewhere.  </li>
      <li>and I have to say it has really helped heal my face, especially the sensitive parts of my neck.</li>
      <li>Old Bond Street Alum Block for a couple of months now, and</li>
      <li>I trust Taylor of Old Bond Street for all of my shaving needs.</li>
      <li>Totally unusable with on large piece that would likely impale something upon using.</li>
      <li>Made from potash alum, an alum block is an old staple in traditional barbershops and still in use in Europe.</li>
      <li>It won&#x27;t stop actual cuts, but so far, I haven&#x27;t found anything that will</li>
      <li>For an alum block, cant get better... or much worse, ha.</li>
      <li>Razorock has one for a little more than half that comes with a travel case.</li>
      <li>After using some other brands this one deserves 5 stars absolutely.</li>
      <li>It did not dry my skin or leave any smell.  </li>
      <li>Being new to wet shaving, I was unsure of the necessity of this little bar, but after the first shave I was sold on its value.  </li>
      <li>I slap on hot water, apply Aveda Composition Pure-formance Oil on the shaving area, apply shaving cream, shave, rinse with warm water and get the block wet with warm water, rub it all over the face, and both sides of the neck (wetting as necessary), brush my teeth and let the water get cold, and then rinse it off with ice cold water.</li>
      <li>New to wet shaving and was going through some learning pains.</li>
      <li>You can feel a slight stinging where the treatment is really needed.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Very high quality alum block. Works great with me. After using some other brands this one deserves 5 stars absolutely. Great feedback after shave .Only down side is the price also a little goes for ages.</li>
    <li> If you get razor burn/bumps, using this on irritated spots will def help!  I always have one in the vanity.</li>
    <li> This works great on irritated skin and the block has lasted me 6 months, and will last much longer.&lt;br /&gt;It is soothing, though leaves a slight film.  While not visible, it does remain. Effective for nicks and cuts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE (4/2011):&lt;br /&gt;I still have the block.  As I continued with wet shaving, I needed to use this less frequently.  However, the block has started to crumble on the edges.  I do believe it will continue to be useful for another 2 years though.</li>
    <li> This block is smooth on the face and works great.  You can feel a slight stinging where the treatment is really needed.  My barber suggested I order an alum block.  Sad to say I waited several months before I took his advice.  I wish I had bought one of these years ago.  Comfortable!!!!</li>
    <li> This is a very nice product.  It is very small, but works great.  I use it by closing my pores with cold water and then gliding this block on my face after my shave.    Cooling feeling and a slight sting if you have cut yourself, but much less than a styptic pencil; which surprised me as I understood that a styptic pencil is made up mostly of Alum.</li>
    <li> I repeatedly saw alum as a recommendation on shaving sites and shaving tip videos. Having little lose, I gave it a try to combat my razor bumps.  The first time I tried this stuff it was AMAZING.  I used it before shaving, applying it before the creme, and the shave felt better, smoother, and closer.  Afterwards, I had less razor bumps and after a few months they had practically vanished.  So the least I can say is that it worked for me.    After losing it while traveling, I shaved without it for a few weeks and did my typical aftershave routine.  Bam!  Razor bumps.  And I agree with other reviews: these things are so dense that as small as it is, it will last you a long time!  After a few months, I couldn&#x27;t even tell it had been used.</li>
    <li> This alum block costs a bit more than others, but it does a great job. And it will last forever if you take care of it! Make sure to dry it off after each use. I trust Taylor of Old Bond Street for all of my shaving needs. They have not yet given me a reason to doubt the quality of their products!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s an Alum block so they are all basically the same but it does the job quite well at sealing up weepers and cuts from shaving.  It is recommended to use cold water to wet the block first before rubbing it on your face and it will sting a little but the sting isn&#x27;t all that bad.</li>
    <li> Here&#x27;s the thing: Alum is alum. What matters is the presentation. While TOBS Alum Block is a solid product, it&#x27;s expensive for what it is and it comes in a cheap box, which means you&#x27;ll have to find a case. It works just like it should, but you can find something that works just as well for less money and that comes in a case.</li>
    <li> Very disappointed product was in pieces upon opening the small box it came in. Totally unusable with on large piece that would likely impale something upon using. Furthermore, at this price it would be nice if there was a small case to keep it in after using.</li>
    <li> Made from potash alum, an alum block is an old staple in traditional barbershops and still in use in Europe. Its all-natural antiseptic properties work as an astringent that instantly closes razor nicks from shaving. soothes and cools razor burn when rubbed over the entire face after a shave.  Run it under cold water and lightly rub it over your face to soothe and cool razor burn after shaving. Alum was used by the Egyptians more than 4,000 years ago. If you find a cheaper brand it is OK, there are not much differences between them.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t splash any alcohol-based aftershave on your newly mown face. Use a gentle astringent based on witch hazel, or an after shave balm, with both antiseptic benefits and moisturizers to protect the skin, or ... as I do regularly, wet your face with lots of handfuls of warm water, then gently rub this block over your shaved areas (stay away from the eyes, of course). Leave on for a few minutes, then towel dry  (if you have dry skin, splash with a bit more warm water before toweling off), and moisturize (after using this an alum block, any conventional moisturizer for your skin type will suffice). IMPORTANT: dry the block and set aside in the open air after use. (If you take care of it, it will last for years.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you go to the trouble to use this old-fashioned after-shave remedy, treat yourself to the whole shebang: a badger shave brush, good shave cream, and a mug to mix it up in -- don&#x27;t dip the wet brush in the cream jar or you&#x27;ll dilute it -- and shave with a clean, double-edged blade razor (Gillette used to make superb ones, look in antique stores for one). You&#x27;ll never go back to canned foams and landfill-supporting plastic razors. And your partner will appreciate the smooth, gentle results.</li>
    <li> New to wet shaving and was going through some learning pains. Read up on alum blocks and decided to get this one due to TOBS shaving cream being so good. Like the slight astringent properties and it does help give you feedback one your shave due to sensing rough patches. Good quality and highly recommended.</li>
    <li> After shaving with a safety razor, this is by far the best tool to stop any &amp;#34;weeping&amp;#34;.  Seems to last forever, as well.  Has no smell so it won&#x27;t clash with any cream or aftershave that you choose.  It won&#x27;t stop actual cuts, but so far, I haven&#x27;t found anything that will so I won&#x27;t hold it against it.</li>
    <li> Recieved this from my wife as a gift and I can honestly say I will never be without alum again. It not only helps with nicks and cuts but it seems to tone the skin as well. That coupled with it&#x27;s antiseptic properties make for an  exceptional shaving experience.</li>
    <li> So much better than using a styptic pencil! Clean and easy to use!</li>
    <li> This product will make your pores look better after a week of use. I shave with a mechanical safety razor (i.e., one razor blade) and this has done wonders. I slap on hot water, apply Aveda Composition Pure-formance Oil on the shaving area, apply shaving cream, shave, rinse with warm water and get the block wet with warm water, rub it all over the face, and both sides of the neck (wetting as necessary), brush my teeth and let the water get cold, and then rinse it off with ice cold water. Finish with a light coating of L&#x27;Occitane Cade After-Shave Balm. Great way to start your morning. I usually split the shave and the alum block with a shower.</li>
    <li> my husband has sensitive skin and this has really helped. he loves it and uses it regularly. it keeps him from getting the breakouts he usually does</li>
    <li> Husband bought this for his wet shaving.  Before he was sometimes having sensitive skin after a wet shave,  with this block you simply wet it and rub it on your face after each wet shave (before shaving if using electric).  It stings when you hit a cut, but in a good way he says!  Face is left feeling great after this, and no sensitive feeling at all!</li>
    <li> Well, it stops the bleasding well and it burns. Good product.</li>
    <li> It does what the description says It&#x27;s basically a much better alternative to after shaves with alcohol You get the same sensation of putting after shave on but without all the chemicals harming your skin And this block will last you forever basically so it pays for itself</li>
    <li> This is one my best purchases. Seriously if you&#x27;re looking to start shaving with a straight blade and are worried about nicks and cuts (and you seriously will get them) then grab this. No more running around with pieces of toliet paper on my face! Good for home use and take on the go in your dopp kit.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent product.  Being new to wet shaving, I was unsure of the necessity of this little bar, but after the first shave I was sold on its value.  It does sting a little on application, however it is more of a refreshing feeling than pain.  It does an excellent job at stopping any irritation and bleeds of any nicks from the shave itself.  This is a must have for anyone who uses a razor.  It did not dry my skin or leave any smell.  Would buy again and recommend to anyone!</li>
    <li> Great alum for aftershave or preshave when I electric shave!! Awesome stuff for TOBS</li>
    <li> I use a safety razor to shave and get occational cuts. This thing makes my cuts sting, so i know it works. I also use a electric razor when i don&#x27;t have time to wet shave and my neck gets red. It stops the bleeding for cuts and cures my redness pretty well and i think it will lasts me forever.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d never heard of an alum block until last year and decided to try this as I frequently have irritated skin and small nicks after shaving.  It works wonders as long as you leave it on long enough to work.  You can&#x27;t be in a hurry and rush it or you are wasting your time.  I leave it on for about 5-7 minutes before rinsing it off my face and neck.  As it drys on your face, you&#x27;ll notice how it cools the skin.  It reduces irritation better than after shave and helps to stop bleeding.  It stings a little, but nothing horrible.  I&#x27;ve had my current block for almost 12 months and it isn&#x27;t even close to needing replaced.  (Just make sure you keep it dry between uses.  I keep mine wrapped in a cloth.).</li>
    <li> Nothing complex about this thing.  Block of alum.  Can&#x27;t really go wrong on that.&lt;br /&gt;Side note, it deteriorates like candy cane, so be weary of sharp edges as time goes by.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t know what to expect but I love it. When applied over nicks cuts, it almost feels like pop rocks. Keeps the irritation down and feels great!</li>
    <li> This is an alum block like many other alum blocks. It&#x27;s small; I&#x27;d say the physical syze is about 2.5&amp;#34;x1.5&amp;#34;x1&amp;#34;. If you have never used an alum block as an after shave or even a deoderant, this is a fantastic product. You will not regret this purchase.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent product to use immediately after a really close shave.  It helps by closing the pores, healing abrasions and nicks, feels soothing and has no odor.  It is important to thoroughly dry this block off after use to prevent it from melting away.  Dry it after use and it will provide excellent service.  I highly recommend this for everyone who shaves but it would be especially useful to younger people with sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> This is a quality bar of alum just as advertised.  The only reason I give it 4 out of 5 is the price.  No need to pay this much for a plain alum bar when you can find quality ones for less.  Hindsight is 20/20.  Good bar, just pricey.</li>
    <li> Been a few months now since I got it and I use it every other day, its an awesome product. I love using it because it help seal any nicks or cuts that I get when i shave with my razor and it tightens my skin. I recommended it to my family and friends if they decide to start shaving with a safety razor.</li>
    <li> I use this as a post shave astringent and antiseptic.  It&#x27;s easy to just wet the block and rub the block over the face.  It actually gives you feedback on your shaving technique and quality of your blade, since any areas where scraping took place will sting slightly.  It&#x27;s also replaced my antiperspirant.  Same technique for application does the job and doesn&#x27;t stain my shirts the way regular deodorant does.</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re new to using a safety razor or straight razor to shave, you must get an alum block to stop up all the nicks you&#x27;re undoubtedly going to shave into your face.  Even after you&#x27;ve progressed passed the stage of cutting yourself, nothing seems to sooth your freshly shaven skin like a wet alum block.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had my Taylor of Old Bond Street Alum Block for a couple of months now, and it is a pleasant part of my shaving ritual.  One block will last a very, very long time.  Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> For an alum block, cant get better... or much worse, ha. Its an alum block! Simple, but this one is of very good quality still</li>
    <li> Being new to DE shaving I did not find out about Alum blocks until after a few months in. I use it after every shave and I have to say it has really helped heal my face, especially the sensitive parts of my neck. It gets 4 stars because the price is almost twice what it should be and it came in a cheap piece of cardboard. Razorock has one for a little more than half that comes with a travel case.</li>
    <li> There are cheaper options for this same product</li>
    <li> Great block, cool and refreshing!</li>
    <li> Best alum block I have used.</li>
    <li> Great small block of alum, it works like it&#x27;s supposed to and has a smooth surface as it glides across your freshly shaven face. The sting is perfect.</li>
    <li> Excellent transaction with fast delivery. Thank you  AAA+++</li>
    <li> Instantly stops bleeding from small razor nicks. Helps shaving irritation also. An invaluable item to have while learning to shave with a safety razor.</li>
    <li> Great stuff.  Tiny bar, can get more for less elsewhere.  Works like a charm though so I&#x27;m happy.</li>
