### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Great product!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not the perfect solution but probably the best one on the market today.</li>
      <li>Wasn&#x27;t impressed with the results...</li>
      <li>The product is wonderful.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m guessing it wouldn&#x27;t look very good with make up on after the fact.  </li>
      <li>This is great for people with bags and puffiness under eyes.</li>
      <li>Not as great as I had hoped and apply under makeup</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t not look attractive at all.  </li>
      <li>The product is great.</li>
      <li>I ordered this for my mom and it works amazing!  </li>
      <li>This product is amazing!</li>
      <li>It  was amazing watching the wrinkles under her eyes disappear!</li>
      <li>I will make sure it has a replaceable cap!</li>
      <li>amazing stuff</li>
      <li>It creates a kind of tightness to the area applied.</li>
      <li>However she really looks good!</li>
      <li>invested in future of product through helping fiance become a distributor of an impressive product.</li>
      <li>These came in a sample pack type of packaging, better for a one time use.</li>
      <li>I love what the product does.  </li>
      <li>Wish it lasted more than 3 hrs</li>
      <li>and then you&#x27;ll be able to rub and touch your eyes and still retain most of the effects it has on the skin.</li>
      <li>She has light skin &amp; after using it under her eyes</li>
      <li>When put on right, it lasts for around 8 hours, takes about 10 years off, and works fantastic!</li>
      <li>The directions even say right on the box to replace cap after using, and there is no cap to replace.</li>
      <li>apply it right.</li>
      <li>It really works!</li>
      <li>Overall it is ok..</li>
      <li>The tightness disappears with the moisture and it feels less effective.</li>
      <li>she really doesn&#x27;t need to apply makeup there.  </li>
      <li>Let it set in for about an hour and really do</li>
      <li>The only thing it would be helpful for is maybe pictures because it doesn&#x27;t look apparent in video or pictures.  </li>

<li> Left my skin very dry and a dense white film that could be seen even under my makeup...</li>
<li> It leaves the skin dry and with a dry white appearance ....</li>
<li> I expected the vials with the lid that can be put back on between uses.</li>
<li> From someone who consistently (and genetically) has bags under my eyes, in constantly being told how tired I look.</li>
<li> did not live up to its claims</li>
<li> It does pull the skin tight so you&#x27;ll feel it for a while and don&#x27;t rub your eyes as this will just bring the bags back.</li>
<li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on these tiny vials.</li>
<li> You aren&#x27;t supposed to use this product with other cosmetics that have oil in them....</li>
<li> To my dismay, it was not worth the investment.</li>
<li> This product does not work, is far too expensive, feels like glue under your eyes and fades your skin color and the bags are still there!!!00 stars but since a star is required to post then 1 star</li>
<li> vendor I purchased from did not appropriately advertise the product and stated I was purchasing vials when in actuality</li>
<li> I&#x27;m a man and developed bags under my eyes when I turned 43 and hated how old and tired I looked.</li>
<li> just not happy with the packaging...</li>
<li> I apply the liquid base around the areas treated and use a mineral powder over the instantly ageless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using the product for a couple weeks, I noticed the depth of my wrinkles diminishing even without the product.</li>
<li> Really disappointed, it leaves crumbs in the face.</li>
<li> I was very UNHAPPY....</li>

    <li> it works. if I can put of my self before and after picture I would.</li>
    <li> Really disappointed, it leaves crumbs in the face.</li>
    <li> invested in future of product through helping fiance become a distributor of an impressive product.</li>
    <li> Not works for me!!!!!</li>
    <li> This is great for people with bags and puffiness under eyes. It really works!</li>
    <li> Worked for me....just not happy with the packaging...once opened, it must be used.</li>
    <li> I expected the vials with the lid that can be put back on between uses. These came in a sample pack type of packaging, better for a one time use. The product starts drying out before I can use it again. The directions even say right on the box to replace cap after using, and there is no cap to replace. Next time I buy this product I will make sure it has a replaceable cap!</li>
    <li> I love what the product does.  The thing i don&#x27;t like is the white film it leaves under my eyes.</li>
    <li> did not live up to its claims</li>
    <li> I was very UNHAPPY.... Left my skin very dry and a dense white film that could be seen even under my makeup...</li>
    <li> The product is wonderful. Does just what it states it will do. It creates a kind of tightness to the area applied. Problems arise if you have moisturized prior or if you want to apply a foundation over the product. The tightness disappears with the moisture and it feels less effective. I apply the liquid base around the areas treated and use a mineral powder over the instantly ageless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using the product for a couple weeks, I noticed the depth of my wrinkles diminishing even without the product. Likely I was relaxing my facial muscles differently considering the &amp;#34;tight&amp;#34; feeling the product leaves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The vendor I purchased from did not appropriately advertise the product and stated I was purchasing vials when in actuality I received sachets. That has nothing to do with the product. The product is great.</li>
    <li> amazing stuff, it takes 10 years off your face</li>
    <li> I ordered this for my mom and it works amazing!  She has light skin &amp; after using it under her eyes she really doesn&#x27;t need to apply makeup there.  I&#x27;m guessing it wouldn&#x27;t look very good with make up on after the fact.  However she really looks good! Here&#x27;s a picture of the cream on one eye. Remember there is no editing or filter added to this photo. It  was amazing watching the wrinkles under her eyes disappear!</li>
    <li> It leaves the skin dry and with a dry white appearance .... It doesn&#x27;t not look attractive at all.  The only thing it would be helpful for is maybe pictures because it doesn&#x27;t look apparent in video or pictures.  Also, it doesn&#x27;t last longer than an hour. To my dismay, it was not worth the investment.</li>
    <li> Wish it lasted more than 3 hrs</li>
    <li> Wasn&#x27;t impressed with the results...</li>
    <li> It dries white, looses hold when liquid makeup is applied. Burns and irritates the skin.</li>
    <li> You definitely need to practice. I found it leaves a white cake like substance if you&lt;br /&gt;don&#x27;t apply it right. Overall it is ok..</li>
    <li> It works for a very short time but does not last or make a big difference.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on these tiny vials. This product does not work, is far too expensive, feels like glue under your eyes and fades your skin color and the bags are still there!!!00 stars but since a star is required to post then 1 star</li>
    <li> Yes it works. I&#x27;m a man and developed bags under my eyes when I turned 43 and hated how old and tired I looked. I apply this under my eyes and the bags disappear! It does pull the skin tight so you&#x27;ll feel it for a while and don&#x27;t rub your eyes as this will just bring the bags back. Let it set in for about an hour and really do it&#x27;s thing to the skin and then you&#x27;ll be able to rub and touch your eyes and still retain most of the effects it has on the skin. It&#x27;s not the perfect solution but probably the best one on the market today.</li>
    <li> Great product! Works as advertised. Arrived promptly.</li>
    <li> Not as great as I had hoped and apply under makeup or it appears flakey.</li>
    <li> It does everything it says it will.</li>
    <li> Dries up and crystallized</li>
    <li> From someone who consistently (and genetically) has bags under my eyes, in constantly being told how tired I look. I saw a video for Instantly Ageless and got some of eBay to sample. When put on right, it lasts for around 8 hours, takes about 10 years off, and works fantastic! I don&#x27;t wear foundation so I don&#x27;t have to worry about mixing the two. You aren&#x27;t supposed to use this product with other cosmetics that have oil in them.... This product is amazing!</li>
