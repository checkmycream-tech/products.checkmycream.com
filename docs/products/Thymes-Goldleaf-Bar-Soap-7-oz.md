      <li>I am using it and enjoying it for now, but I doubt I will buy it again.</li>
      <li>If you have a bar of this soap in your bathroom, you will smell its lovely scent every time you go in there.</li>
      <li>hubs uses it :)</li>
      <li>Love it.</li>
      <li>Love, love this soap.</li>
      <li>But Amazon&#x27;s shipping method costs more money.</li>
      <li>Always my favorite.</li>
      <li>This soap and other products in the Gold Leaf line has a delightful perfume.</li>
      <li>I also love the scent, when my son came for a visit he commented on how much lather the soap makes he asked what kind it</li>
      <li>Nice large soap bar with heavenly scent.</li>
      <li>The soap has a strong, rich, flowery scent.</li>
      <li>real real good.love it.will have to order some more for Christmas gifts.</li>
      <li>so I&#x27;m glad that the price is more reasonable.</li>
      <li>Online price seems to be the best as it&#x27;s usually sold in specialty stores who tend to mark it up a lot.</li>

      <li>Packaging shows how special it is.</li>
      <li>This soap is so good, and the smell is fresh and lasting</li>
      <li>I could not resist the  purchase; not only that - it lasts for a long time, lathers nicely and leaves beautifully cleaned skin with this great delicate scent on it; I used to make my own soap because I refused to buy any - not anymore - I gave up soap making for this little gem (not really little, it has a nice size)</li>
      <li>this soap is worth the price you pay.</li>
      <li>She instantly fell in love with it.</li>
      <li>I suspect it will be positive as my experiences with Hmes and with Filigree have been.</li>
      <li>very sturdy bar and lasts.</li>
      <li>Haven&#x27;t tried, gold leaf is new to me.  </li>
      <li>To her, this is her treat, her special pampering, a little bit of pure luxury.</li>
      <li>Gentle fragrance, not overbearing, just enough to smell wonderful.&lt;br /&gt;Wish</li>
      <li>Not only does the packaging reflect the quality of the soap, the bar&#x27;s perfume is absolutely heavenly.</li>
      <li>Shipped early</li>
      <li>I like this soap so much because it lasts so long</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s so light and subtle.</li>

    <li> amazing smell that lasts</li>
    <li> Love, love this soap.</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t tried, gold leaf is new to me.  I suspect it will be positive as my experiences with Hmes and with Filigree have been.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this bar of scented soap! Smells so good, but can&#x27;t leave it in the shower or tub or else hubs uses it :)</li>
    <li> I bought this soap  once in Southern Season and I thought it is pricey but the price was the same; the scent is so nice and elegant I could not resist the  purchase; not only that - it lasts for a long time, lathers nicely and leaves beautifully cleaned skin with this great delicate scent on it; I used to make my own soap because I refused to buy any - not anymore - I gave up soap making for this little gem (not really little, it has a nice size)</li>
    <li> I like this soap so much because it lasts so long and it lathers so beautifully.  I also love the scent, when my son came for a visit he commented on how much lather the soap makes he asked what kind it was.&lt;br /&gt;I stopped using liquid soap and find the bar goes much further.  Bought 3 bars and will purchase again and again maybe in a different fragrance for a change up. Thynes is a wonderful product.</li>
    <li> Always my favorite. Nice large soap bar with heavenly scent. Online price seems to be the best as it&#x27;s usually sold in specialty stores who tend to mark it up a lot. Keep making it Thymes!</li>
    <li> This is one of those products that is of good quality, but it just isn&#x27;t the ace in the hole for me. I&#x27;m not going to rave about it. The soap has a strong, rich, flowery scent. I can&#x27;t identify the flower, (blend) but it is an old-fashioned kind of floral. I am using it and enjoying it for now, but I doubt I will buy it again.</li>
    <li> Love it!  I gave this soap as a birthday gift to my Sister-in-law.  She used mine when she visited for a few days.  She really&lt;br /&gt;liked it.</li>
    <li> i purchased this years ago at Longwood Gardens in Philly and haven&#x27;t had it since . I adore it . It&#x27;s so light and subtle.AWESOME</li>
    <li> Great soap.she loved hit!! was very happy with it smells real real good.love it.will have to order some more for Christmas gifts.</li>
    <li> Definitely a high quality, beautifully packaged soap. The smell, however, reminded me of my mother. And at 40 something, I&amp;#34;m not interested in smelling 70 something. I gave it to my mother. She loves it.</li>
    <li> This soap is so good, and the smell is fresh and lasting, I wish I didn&#x27;t have to look for it on the internet, I use to buy it in a jewelry store and they close up,  this soap is worth the price you pay.</li>
    <li> Product is nice - no doubt. But Amazon&#x27;s shipping method costs more money.</li>
    <li> Bought as gift.  Appears as advertised.  Have been told it is very nice.</li>
    <li> I love the smell and feel of this soap!  I also use their body wash and perfume on a regular basis.</li>
    <li> This is terrific soap. Gentle fragrance, not overbearing, just enough to smell wonderful.&lt;br /&gt;Wish I could find more of it!</li>
    <li> best bath soap on the market.  expensive but worth it.  Shipped early</li>
    <li> Ive loved this soap for a while now. So when I ordered more I thought I would try the rose. Love it. So will rotate between the two. very sturdy bar and lasts.</li>
    <li> My mother received a Thymes Gold Leaf bar of soap as a Christmas gift from a friend about 15 years ago. She instantly fell in love with it. Not only does the packaging reflect the quality of the soap, the bar&#x27;s perfume is absolutely heavenly. Before the convenience of Amazon or internet shopping, she would make me look for this product all over town. I would find it in specialty lingerie boutique shops because the department stores didn&#x27;t carry it. At that time, this little bar of soap would retail for about $30 each. I thought that was a little extreme so I&#x27;m glad that the price is more reasonable. To her, this is her treat, her special pampering, a little bit of pure luxury. Who knew a soap would have such a fan club.</li>
    <li> This smells so good!  This is a treat..and not used daily.  Make great gifts.  Packaging shows how special it is.</li>
    <li> If you have a bar of this soap in your bathroom, you will smell its lovely scent every time you go in there. It is hard milled, very long lasting, worth the seemingly-high price.</li>
    <li> This soap and other products in the Gold Leaf line has a delightful perfume. The whole bathroom smells really beautiful.</li>
    <li> love all the thymes products</li>
    <li> love the soap and adore the fragrance</li>
    <li> This is a great soap, pricey but worth the price because it leaves your skin feeling nice and smelling great</li>
    <li> Excellent product - description is absolute in fragrance, size, creamy texture.  Bought a bar for myself and two for friends - they are thanking me.I will purchase more Thymes Gold Leaf Products.</li>
    <li> Once you try this you will never be without it</li>
