      <li>It&#x27;s great for my short hair -</li>
      <li>I was looking for a light alternative to Aquage&#x27;s Transforming Paste and tried this.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s perfect for scrunching, as it really helps pull the curl up without making your hair crunchy or dry.</li>
      <li>I was so excited to try this product after seeing it featured in a magazine.  </li>
      <li>This product is great and lasts for a long time.  </li>
      <li>Will most certainly buy again.</li>
      <li>I was thinking it was over $10 per bottle because of the cool look but maaaaan,</li>
      <li>Absolutely, hands down, the best hair gel!  </li>
      <li>I have yet to find a similar product that works as effectively as this one does.</li>
      <li>I have curly hair, but use this product when I want a more defined \\&quot;scrunched\\&quot; look than when I want \\&quot;soft and touchable\\&quot; curls.  </li>
      <li>just right.</li>
      <li>I use it everyday, I put a dime size in the palm of my hand, then rub my hands together to warm up the product then smooth through my damp hair.  </li>
      <li>This product is great and hard to find.  </li>
      <li>My sister uses it pretty often</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used this product for several years but recently have had a problem finding it in local hair salons so very happy to find it on line.</li>
      <li>It was exactly what I wanted.  </li>
      <li>However I was less than pleased!</li>
      <li>I have fine hair, a lot of hair, but this product give me a big a Texas hair, it that is what I am looking for.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s hard to find a good gel, and this one will keep you looking.  </li>
      <li>Really brings out my highlights.  </li>
      <li>but it spreads really well, and holds</li>
      <li>You need just a tiny bit - about the size of a baby pea - spread it through your hands from fingertip to palm then smooth through your hair.</li>
      <li>the gel is much looser than before, and it doesn&#x27;t hold my hair in place like before.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve nicknamed this my \\&quot;mermaid gel\\&quot; because the look of the gel is iridescent and just really pretty.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I have thick, wavy hair that needs product to look good.  </li>
      <li>Want nice hair, but you don&#x27;t want to see it gooey and stiff?  </li>
      <li>Easy to use, goes a long way!  </li>
      <li>While a little sticky at first, it provides my fine hair with amazing softness, volume and curl (when using a round brush and hair dryer).  </li>
      <li>Highly recommended.</li>
      <li>Worth every cent, when that little endless bottle runs out, I will be sure to buy another one right off the bat.    </li>
      <li>I wash my hair, it comes out clean - but it holds well until I wash my hair, usually - even through the next day, if I&#x27;ve not been able to grab a shower before bed.  </li>
      <li>It keep everything in place just enough, and is super soft and flexible.</li>
      <li>I love that it holds my hair without making it stiff.</li>
      <li>It might not be the best holding product for those with extremely fine or thin hair, since it is a heavy product, but for those like me with thick and course hair, it really helps to hold curl as well as protects my hair when I straighten it.</li>
      <li>On the positive side, I gave it to a 26-year old male friend with curly hair and he loves it.</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t speak to different hair types, but for me - this really does the trick.  </li>
      <li>I was going to return it, but thought it would be too much hassle, and I would end up with the same product as I just received.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please</li>
      <li>Perfect consistency: not too thick or sticky, not too thin where you need a lot of it just to get some hold.  </li>
      <li>After blow-drying or straightening my hair, I take the product an rub it in my hands, and then lightly rub it in starting mid-way down my hair.  </li>
      <li>this is the only product I have ever found that gives new meaning to gray!!!!&lt;br</li>
      <li>little bit goes a long way, and I strongly recommend having damp hair and hands to work it through your tresses.  </li>
      <li>Gives you the good hold or styling that you want, but not the gooey, stiff, hard look that weighs you down.  </li>
      <li>Helps my thin,  fine hair have some body after  blow-drying.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Always use this brand</li>
    <li> Works well for short hair, put it at the roots for lift, also helps with piecing and separating. Can be heavy, don&#x27;t use too much.</li>
    <li> By far the best styling product I&#x27;ve ever used.  Use it on wet or dry hair.  I have thick, wavy hair that needs product to look good.  Gelade gives my hair shine and makes it easy to style.</li>
    <li> Nice hold, texture, and shine.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s great..just so expensive!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for 5 years. I absolutely love it. I have wavey in-between hair, and this product helps me achieve any look. If I straiten my hair I put in a bit while it&#x27;s damp, and use a little to pat down any frizz after the flat iron. It keep everything in place just enough, and is super soft and flexible. I have layered hair so I&#x27;ll run a little though my hair with my fingers and it gives it just enough texture and depth. If I curl my hair, I run it through my curls with my fingers and it smooths down frizz, hold the curls together, and gives it bounce. Or the best thing is when I want a quick natural wavy look I run some through damp or dry hair and I&#x27;m set. I always do a light spray of hairspray after for a bit more hold. PLEASE NOTE: A little goes a long way!</li>
    <li> I was so excited to try this product after seeing it featured in a magazine.  However I was less than pleased! The consistency is what bothered me...it&#x27;s gooey and I felt like my hair was sticky throughout the day.  I wear my hair short and spikey and hoped that this would give it some shine...but I can&#x27;t get past the texture thing!</li>
    <li> I absolutely LOVE this product. It&#x27;s perfect for scrunching, as it really helps pull the curl up without making your hair crunchy or dry. The texture is definitely more like a pomade, but it&#x27;s not greasy. A great mix of a gel and a pomade, it helps to hold your style in place, whether applying before you style, or just to help smooth flyaway hairs.    It might not be the best holding product for those with extremely fine or thin hair, since it is a heavy product, but for those like me with thick and course hair, it really helps to hold curl as well as protects my hair when I straighten it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Aquage Illuminating Gelade for many years.  It&#x27;s the best not sticky gel I&#x27;ve ever used.  Really brings out my highlights.  A little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> I never knew the price for this little guy until I amazoned it. I was thinking it was over $10 per bottle because of the cool look but maaaaan, its double BUT ! This little guy last FOREVER both ways. My sister uses it pretty often and I steal some from her all the time when I do my hair. It&#x27;s been laying around for like a few monthes and its about $25 per bottle for the 4 oz bottle. I only use a little bit and it last on my head all day. What I like about it most and I&#x27;m not sure if its what its supposed to be doing but it hold my hair into the position I want and it doesnt just keep it there, I can adjust it and it will hold. For example, I usually start off with a fohawk and i just run my hands through my hair and BAM, regular spikey and it holds. Worth every cent, when that little endless bottle runs out, I will be sure to buy another one right off the bat.    P.S. I am a guy, I am not sure if any others guys reviewed this so yeah, fellas who do their hair, riiiight heeeere. Drop $25 and the ladies will look at your slightly sparkly hair when your out.</li>
    <li> Love it love it love it</li>
    <li> This product is great and hard to find.  Product arrived quickly and in perfect shape.  I should have bought two!  Great for flyaways!</li>
    <li> i have used this product for years and like it,</li>
    <li> I have used this product for about 12 years and refuse to run out of it. It&#x27;s unbeatable for taming frizz and flyaways. You need just a tiny bit - about the size of a baby pea - spread it through your hands from fingertip to palm then smooth through your hair. I have yet to find a similar product that works as effectively as this one does. My hair is thick, curly, and coarse... so it would probably be too weighty for finer, thinner, straighter hair - but for hair that tends to be &amp;#34;big&amp;#34; no matter what you do - this stuff is perfect. Love it.</li>
    <li> Great product and smells fantastic!!</li>
    <li> I have used this for several years.  It works great not to pasty just right. I recommend</li>
    <li> Helps my thin,  fine hair have some body after  blow-drying. Also, keeps static at a minimum.  Have used for several years.</li>
    <li> Disappointed in this Aquage product. Prob great for shorter or dense hair. Mine is just too fine.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried the pastes, the styling gels, but this is my favorite. I have fine hair, a lot of hair, but this product give me a big a Texas hair, it that is what I am looking for. It seems like my hairdresser never has it in stock...Yay Amazon!</li>
    <li> It was exactly what I wanted.  I expect to purchase another supply shortly.  Thank you.</li>
    <li> Won&#x27;t use any other product for my curls.  Works well with hairsprays that don&#x27;t have alcohol in them.  Excellent product.</li>
    <li> I use this hair product every day and am delighted to find this on Amazon.  I can keep one on hand while I use one and know I will have the extra to use when I need it.  Have ordered this from Amazon several times and always receive the gelade timely with no delays.  Pleased I was able to find it on Aamazon, this is a really good hair care product.</li>
    <li> Awesome Product&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking for a product for fine hair, this is it. Gives body to your hair and isn&#x27;t tacky.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve nicknamed this my \\&quot;mermaid gel\\&quot; because the look of the gel is iridescent and just really pretty.&lt;br /&gt;A little bit goes a long way, and I strongly recommend having damp hair and hands to work it through your tresses.  I have curly hair, but use this product when I want a more defined \\&quot;scrunched\\&quot; look than when I want \\&quot;soft and touchable\\&quot; curls.  I can&#x27;t speak to different hair types, but for me - this really does the trick.  I don&#x27;t get any hair gel flakes (which I hate) or clumps.  The consistency of the gel is VERY thick (hence the recommendation to have wet hands, too) - but it spreads really well, and holds wonderfully.&lt;br /&gt;When I wash my hair, it comes out clean - but it holds well until I wash my hair, usually - even through the next day, if I&#x27;ve not been able to grab a shower before bed.  Really nice product. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Want nice hair, but you don&#x27;t want to see it gooey and stiff?  This is the perfect product for you.  Gives you the good hold or styling that you want, but not the gooey, stiff, hard look that weighs you down.  Very hard to find, so thank you AMAZON!</li>
    <li> This product works great with my fine, thinning hair. Not too heavy or greasy!!</li>
    <li> This product is great and lasts for a long time.  My hairdresser suggested this product in place of hair spray for control.  My hair is long and I use a pea size amount of the Gelade.  After blow-drying or straightening my hair, I take the product an rub it in my hands, and then lightly rub it in starting mid-way down my hair.  The remainder is taken and rubbed in the sides and top of my hair.  I still use a little bit of hair spray, but this product makes the &amp;#34;frizzies&amp;#34; less noticeable and makes my hair shine like I have had a smoothing treatment done.  It has been a staple in my hair care arsenal and I will not be without this product.</li>
    <li> I have a lot of body in my hair that can get frizzy on rainy days and look poofy  I put a little Gelade on my hand wet with water and stream through towel dried hair. It works great gives me nice curl with no frizz and no hard crunch. Will most certainly buy again.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for years!  When my hair gets a little down late in the day and I have somewhere to go, I just apply a little and look like I just washed and styled my hair.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s hard to find a good gel, and this one will keep you looking.  More gum than gel.  Keep looking.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for several years but recently have had a problem finding it in local hair salons so very happy to find it on line. It&#x27;s great for my short hair -</li>
    <li> This product is great in holding my wild hair and adding shine to it! I also use Transforming Paste by Aquage alternately.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for over 8 years for my spikey \\&quot;do,\\&quot; and the last time I ordered it, the texture and consistency had changed so now the gel is much looser than before, and it doesn&#x27;t hold my hair in place like before.  I was going to return it, but thought it would be too much hassle, and I would end up with the same product as I just received.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please change it back to the way it was - because I LOVED this stuff!!!</li>
    <li> Absolutely, hands down, the best hair gel!  Perfect consistency: not too thick or sticky, not too thin where you need a lot of it just to get some hold.  Use wet or dry.  I use it everyday, I put a dime size in the palm of my hand, then rub my hands together to warm up the product then smooth through my damp hair.  This product keeps my wavy hair in place, and adds body and shine.</li>
    <li> If you have dull graying hair.  this is the only product I have ever found that gives new meaning to gray!!!!&lt;br /&gt;  Its irridescent components make dull gray hair come alive!!  I love it</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like the smell. It works great.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t use this product as a pomade on dry hair as per the instructions.  Instead, I use it as a styling gel on my WET hair.  While a little sticky at first, it provides my fine hair with amazing softness, volume and curl (when using a round brush and hair dryer).  I finish it off with a little transforming paste for some hold, and I&#x27;m set for the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this product!</li>
    <li> My daughter bought this for me originally, &amp; I fell in love with it!  I have short hair, &amp; I just have to use a little pea-size bit of the gelade after drying &amp; curling (if necessary).  It helps it stay put without being stiff.  Great product!!!</li>
    <li> Not only does this product give my hair a shiny, darker look that other products don&#x27;t, it lasts forever.  I only use a pea-sized dab and that is plenty.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a light alternative to Aquage&#x27;s Transforming Paste and tried this. It definitely isn&amp;#34;t lighter and it also doesn&#x27;t &amp;#34;keep it where I want it&amp;#34; which transorming paste does. On the positive side, I gave it to a 26-year old male friend with curly hair and he loves it.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for years.  It gives great hold and shine.</li>
    <li> Easy to use, goes a long way!  Not easy to find in retail stores ... So happy to have found a source.</li>
    <li> I love that it holds my hair without making it stiff. As the day does on I can wet it and that strengthens the hold.</li>
