      <li>I can&#x27;t tell you exactly why I love this, but I do.  </li>

      <li>My husband loved this shampoo when we went to a posh hotel and as an anniversary gift tracked down 3 bottles.</li>
      <li>First off, while it *tries* to smell nice, the scent is buried by a plastic smell, probably from the bottle, and it fades quickly.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> It leathers nice  It has  a wonderful smell  your hair is  soft but i think its little over  price that why i gave it  3star rating</li>
    <li> I first encountered Cali Tarocco Orange shampoo and conditioner in a hotel a few years back. The little bottles were so cute and when I tried the shampoo I was pleasantly surprised. A refreshing citrus orange frangrance, and super cleaning. My hair was squeakier than ever before, and yet it dried soft and so shiny. I used a little of the conditioner, and found it wasn&#x27;t heavy like some.  When I ran out of the sample, I searched for more on the internet, and found it at Amazon.  Thank you, Amazon! Love this stuff.</li>
    <li> We found out about Cali when we were visiting Eagle Ridge Resort in Galena IL for an anniversary weekend.  We love these products and will continue to order them.</li>
    <li> It was good first couple of tries and excellent when I tried it as a sample but then it was not as great. . I have very thick hair and it just wasn&#x27;t cleaning very well and left it a bit dry. The scent is unique and I enjoyed it wouldn&#x27;t last but I don&#x27;t expect shampoo scents to last on my hair when I&#x27;m sweating or out  walking in city other than Herbal essences which dries my hair a whole lot more.</li>
    <li> As I mentioned in my review of the Tarocco Orange Nourishing Hand &amp; Body Lotion I had the wonderful experience of first trying this product at a Resort &amp; Spa in Illinois.  This item is wonerful.  I have very thin hair and this shampoo left my hair feeling fuller, soft, and shiny!</li>
    <li> I loved this when I used it in a hotel recently.  I don&#x27;t know if my soft water setting isn&#x27;t right - but it does leave my hair clean and I love the smell of oranges.</li>
    <li> The best shampoo ever.  Cleans and detangles without killing my natural curl :)</li>
    <li> Nort worth the money. I regret ordering that product for the money I paid for. Found similar items for fraction of the cost</li>
    <li> I have blonde hair that is usually straight, but gets frizzy in humid weather.  I stayed in the Rosen center hotel in Orlando, FL, and rained every day, so my hair was dull limp and frizzy.  I used the Cali Tarocco Orange Moisturizing Shampoo and conditioner just to see if it would help (I usually use Nioxin). My hair smelled great, dried silky smooth and had high shine. It lightly rained all evening and my hair looked amazing! I will use Tarocco from now on.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s provided in the Pepper Mill Reno hotel rooms.  Nice shampoo, but for me an even better shaving lubricant (facial).  It&#x27;s expensive, but worth it for the shaving comfort.</li>
    <li> I have been using the body lotion for awhile...which I love.  The scent, greaseless feel, and all natural ingredients are wonderful, so I tried the shampoo.  It is really effective for removing build up on hairl</li>
    <li> I love this product&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product has a smell unlike any other shampoo I have ever encountered.&lt;br /&gt;The product has great ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used this product first in Hawaii and have never turned back since using it.&lt;br /&gt;The orange smell is strong and the shampoo does have olive oil in it.</li>
    <li> I first used this shampoo while staying in a New York City hotel that supplied it for its guests. It&#x27;s terrific - the aroma and its moisturizing nature allows for everyday use. Great product. Great delivery time. I will continue to order this product through Amazon.com.</li>
    <li> This shampoo leaves hair clean, manageable and it has a fantastic scent.  First time used at The Cody in Wyoming.</li>
    <li> This is awful greasy shampoo that does not clean my hair.  Smells good.</li>
    <li> Smells and cleans great, however, I find it dries my hair.</li>
    <li> I have thick curly hair so this shampoo helps tame it down.</li>
    <li> Love this shampoo great smell and it does clean your hair and smells awesome.Try this product and you will recommend to your friends</li>
    <li> It left my hair feeling a little dry, Probably would not purchase it again. I wished I would have ordered the travel size instead of the larger size.</li>
    <li> Finally able to find this product.  It leaves my hair soft and shiny without really needing a conditioner.  Excellent product.</li>
    <li> Very satisfied with this item. Item met my requirements based on the description as detailed in the ad shown on Amazon. Would recommend and would buy again.</li>
    <li> I first used this shampoo at a hotel and really liked it.  It smells great and leaves my hair very clean and shiny.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff and would buy it anytime. I makes my hair soft and silky. I love the smell too.</li>
    <li> I ordered this after using a sample provided at a hotel I&#x27;d stayed at last fall. This is lightly scented and cleans nicely.  We will purchase a second order once this bottle is mostly used.</li>
    <li> Like how my hair feels and looks; silky and shiny. The consistency of the shampoo seems thinner than the small bottle I received at a recent resort visit.</li>
    <li> This is a great product!  I was intoduced to Tarocco Orange Shampoo at the condo we rented in Orange Beach.  I was thrilled to find it on Amazon.  My only complaint is the bottle...it is much too brittle a plastic for a shower...breaks too easily.  I will from now on transfer it to a more pliable plastic bottle.</li>
    <li> I color my hair and it was looking dry. Tried this shampoo on vacation and it softened my hair added body and made it look healthy .</li>
    <li> There&#x27;s nothing quite like waking up in the morning, jumping in the shower, and enjoying the refreshing scent of blood oranges. I first found out about this shampoo while staying at a hotel in Vegas. I took a bottle back home with me so i wouldnt forget what the brand was, looked it up on Amazon, and here it was. It is rather expensive in comparison to even brands purchased at Whole Foods and the like, but i dont mind. Aside from the awesome scent, it actually leaves my hair feeling cleaner and lighter than anything else i have used. I cant speak to whether it provides more body or not, but i am very happy with this product.</li>
    <li> Package was a little bit leaky when received. I do love the shampoo.</li>
    <li> After staying at a hotel that provided samples, my husband asked me to find a source.  Amazon did it again. I gave him two bottles for Christmas.  The orange blossom fragrance is heavenly.  I use a product for color treated hair, or I&#x27;d use it as well.</li>
    <li> If you like the scent of blood orange then you find this shampoo be great stuff.</li>
    <li> We have a fractional share of a beach house and this is the shampoo that is stocked in the bathrooms (sample size).  My hair looks fabulous when I use this shampoo.  I finally found it on the internet and ordered it through Amazon.  It came very quickly and now I have great hair every day!</li>
    <li> I have naturally straight hair, that I have never done ANYTHING to. I have a hard time finding shampoo and conditioner for natural hair, it seems everything is for color or curly etc.  I stumbled across this great stuff in a hotel, my hair has never felt ir smelt so amazing. People even commented that my hair looked like it was glowing. Must have, I will buy this shampoo and conditioner forever!</li>
    <li> Great shampoo for everyday smells marvelous!  A bit pricy but I feel it&#x27;s worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love it, love it, love</li>
    <li> Absolutey amazing shampoo it leaves my hair so silky and shiny.</li>
    <li> I really like the product. It leaves my hair very light and not weighted down. Gives it a lot of body too. I also love the fragerance.&lt;br /&gt;I also like the Tarocco conditioner.</li>
    <li> Do yourself a favor and try this awesome shampoo. We first discovered it in a high end hotel that we stayed at. The scent is absolutely heavenly. The Italians do it again.</li>
    <li> tried it at a high dollar hotel, but the shampoo is great.  The soap not so great - and the conditioner is also not impressive in my opinion.  But again, love the shampoo; leaves my dry hair silkly smooth.</li>
    <li> Like the fragrance. Hair feels soft after using. The olive oil is good for the skin.</li>
    <li> Best shampoo I have ever found .</li>
    <li> My husband loved this shampoo when we went to a posh hotel and as an anniversary gift tracked down 3 bottles. Made his day.. Thank you.</li>
    <li> After encountering Tarocco products for the first time on a visit to the Virginian Suites Hotel in&lt;br /&gt;Arlington, VA, I started using their products at home.&lt;br /&gt;The shampoo in particular cleanses well and has a decent smell to it.&lt;br /&gt;Not merely a product to make your hair smell nice, it cleans as well as it odorizes.&lt;br /&gt;Still, the smell isn&#x27;t overpowering, so guys don&#x27;t worry.  Definitely not a perfume.&lt;br /&gt;Worth the price.</li>
    <li> First used this in a hotel (the complimentary sample).  Loved the scent and it works as well as other shampoos.</li>
    <li> I bought this based on all these positive reviews. First off, while it *tries* to smell nice, the scent is buried by a plastic smell, probably from the bottle, and it fades quickly. Second of all, this shampoo doesn&#x27;t rinse out of my hair cleanly and quickly; it takes a long time before I feel I can shut the water off. And third of all, it leaves my hair dull and lusterless. As my hair is not colored or processed or highlighted or treated in any way, it&#x27;s normally smooth and shiny but this shampoo leaves it dull and lank. I threw it out. Save your money!</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t tell you exactly why I love this, but I do.  Smell of oranges and the way my hair feels so healthy, I guess!</li>
    <li> Ordered for Mom and this is her fave shampoo!</li>
    <li> This is a great shampoo that I discovered while staying in an upscale hotel some years ago. Seems it is not sold in the stores so I was delighted to find it on amazon. My only con is that its expensive</li>
    <li> The shampoo is watered down and leaves my hair feeling like straw.  Even after using the conditioner my hair is left extremely dry.  I would not recommend this product to anyone.</li>
    <li> love this stuff. Had a creamy orange shampoo years ago, this one is just like it. Excellent orange scent.&lt;br /&gt;worth every penny.</li>
    <li> I first used this shampoo in a hotel in Florida. I don&#x27;t usually notice a difference in my hair, but this time I sure did! It makes my hair so soft and manageable, I just wish I could find it locally in a store.</li>
    <li> It smells delicious,I love all things orange but makes my hair feel weighed down which I hate because I have alot of fine hair and am looking for volume...Maybe I will try it as a body wash so it isn&#x27;t a total waste?</li>
    <li> This shampoo smells wonderful!  First came across the product at a boutique hotel in Palm Springs CA.  Was happy to find it at amazon.com!</li>
    <li> delivery on time.  Shampoo itself is excellent, but the bottle is flawed, it leaks from the side.</li>
    <li> I like the soap better. I found  not much lather with the shampoo. I think it smells nice but not enough to recomend</li>
    <li> Used it before and love it</li>
    <li> Love the Tarocco products;  Body Wash, Shampoo and Conditioner!  Love it all!</li>
    <li> Cali Tarocco Orange Moisturizing Shampoo - 8.7 fl. oz. The shampoo bottle was just placed in to a Tyvek envelope, with no padding.  The bottle had leaked and it was a mess.  However the shampoo is outstanding if you have difficult hair like me.  My wife ordered the same item it arrived in a box with no problems.</li>
    <li> This stuff is so awesome! Really cuts the buildup on your hair, and smells awesome. I learned of it staying in a Beverly Hills hotel for work, and was glad to see that thanks to Amazon I can afford such an item in my home. I&#x27;m very very happy with this shampoo.</li>
    <li> Smells great and has beautiful lather.</li>
