      <li>Glad I got the chance to try this, though, most definitely!</li>

      <li>and I&#x27;m completely healed.</li>
      <li>I suffer from Osteoarthritis and have frequent flare ups.</li>

<li> I have shared it with 3 other neighbors and each felt the same way!</li>
<li> The bottle was a little smaller than I imagined</li>
<li> I use other Arnica products for relief from joint and muscle&lt;</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve never used arnica before, so I can&#x27;t compare this to other products that contain arnica.  </li>
<li> It does have a faint yellow color, probably due to some of the natural extracts.  </li>
<li> I&#x27;m not sure it would be advisable to use this every single day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> I had a prior hip joint injury for months with no successful pain management.</li>
<li> I&#x27;m fond of adding a little Epsom salt with this.</li>
<li> There is a little foam created when using the jets.  </li>
<li> I would definitely recommend this product for anyone who suffers from the occasional aches and pains.</li>
<li> and I think this helped at least a little bit.  </li>
<li> I also soaked for longer than the recommended 15-20 minutes without any ill effect, though I only use this about once a week.  </li>
<li> I also pour a small amount onto a sponge and use it as a shower scrub too.  </li>
<li> /&gt;It smells herbal but also medicinal, but not necessarily in the bad way that those words often indicate.  </li>
<li> like that this doesn&#x27;t contain artificial colors like some of the other Kniepp products.  </li>
<li> It soothes tired shin splinted legs and relaxes the body with the scent of arnica.</li>
<li> Truly refreshes and soothes my tired joints and muscles</li>
<li> is I am wrong .</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I remember hauling bottles and bottles of Kneipp back from Holland in the 70&#x27;s, when you couldn&#x27;t find it in the US. This stuff is wonderful. Cannot speak highly enough about Kneipp products.</li>
    <li> Kneip is consistent, Arnica is a heaven sent..</li>
    <li> Shipped very fast, love the product...</li>
    <li> Mild fragrance.  Aches and pains are soothed after warm bath with this.</li>
    <li> This product is a must have for anyone who does a lot of  physical exercise.  Immediate relief is found by soaking the body in the essential oils of this product.  The aches and pains melt away w/in 15 minutes of soaking and are gone until the next time you exert yourself to much.  A soothing fragrance adds to the pleasure of a relaxed body.  This is my fourth bottle since Christmas of 2012 and I wouldn&#x27;t be without it ever again.  CC</li>
    <li> I love Kneipp. It is worth every cent.. Part of the reason these are such great oils is the scent. This stuff has no smell . It didn&#x27;t seem to do much for my joints either. However, I plan to takes second long hot bath to double check because Kneipp has been good to me and I may be the reason it&#x27;s not a winner this time. I may not have had hot enough water or enough of th oil. I will change the review is I am wrong . I recommend the Bliss, Melissa and spruce in the meantime</li>
    <li> Aaaaaaaahmazing!! Whether you want to relax from stress or from physical aches and pains from shoveling snow, this is the answer. A capful is plenty for a bath. I&#x27;m fond of adding a little Epsom salt with this. The scent is sooo soothing to the senses.</li>
    <li> This is a at-home therapist!  Take a bath with Arnica and PHEW, the pains are drastically reduced.  I have shared it with 3 other neighbors and each felt the same way!</li>
    <li> This product works very well at relieving body aches &amp; body pains.  I&#x27;ve used it in my bath to relieve joint &amp; muscle aches, and on occasion for headaches as well.  I also pour a small amount onto a sponge and use it as a shower scrub too.  The scent is on the strong side but not overwhelming.  I have flower allergies and I have no problems with this.  I would definitely recommend this product for anyone who suffers from the occasional aches and pains.</li>
    <li> Pain relief without pills.</li>
    <li> Really works!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! just like it says</li>
    <li> How can anyone resist this stuff.  Just buy it, you will love it and use it as a go to once you try it.  Very soothing for my occasional back and osteoarthritis hip pain.  Does wonders for my too much gardening and those overdid weight training workout pains.</li>
    <li> Sent to a friend who reported that it helped her hugely.  Arnica has wonderful healing properties and bath oil is a lovely, soothing way to enjoy them.  Well worth the money.</li>
    <li> I have been using these Herbal Bath oils for years now.  It is safe to use with my jetted bathtub.  There is a little foam created when using the jets.  The aroma on ALL the Kneipp Bath oils are great and I highly recommend any of them, but Eucalyptus and Juniper are my favorite.</li>
    <li> Contains real essential oils in a non chemical blend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Works !  Smells good too  .Purchasing more for friends and myself as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;rpergola</li>
    <li> This product has been good for sore muscles.  I have soaked my injured ankle in it daily and&lt;br /&gt;It has helped.  I will continue to use this product.</li>
    <li> This brand is, by far, the best on the market.  I have a huge tub, and just a little bit does the trick.  The bottle lasts a good long time, so worth the money.</li>
    <li> This stuff works for sore muscles. It smells quite medicimal, but that&#x27;s not a bad thing.  Nothing like a nice long soak.</li>
    <li> This product is great! I have given several bottles to friends and they love it too!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t use this herbal bath every day and I probably should if I want to see maximum effects but it does seem to relieve the soreness in my feet and knees when I use it.  The fragrance is medicinal but not too bad.</li>
    <li> This and the Kneipp bath salts are keeping my track son running with nightly soaks.  It soothes tired shin splinted legs and relaxes the body with the scent of arnica.</li>
    <li> Gave it to somebody as a gift - wasn&#x27;t too excited about the scent myself, but she said the scent doesn&#x27;t even matter because she felt so awesome after the bath! Scent is a little &amp;#34;piney&amp;#34; but it very worth it.</li>
    <li> My husband loves the Arnica bath oil, and I enjoy the other bath products as well. The scents are wonderful, the product feels good, and the Arnica product actually lessons pain somewhat. I highly recommend this company&#x27;s products.</li>
    <li> Cheaper here than at my spa.  Very relaxing.  My husband can&#x27;t use--hates the smell.  I find it softening and moisturizing to my skin and relaxing.</li>
    <li> Kneipp is hands-down the best!  This stuff gives me tremendous relief, and it smells great!  I will be buying more!</li>
    <li> This product was recommended to my by a lady who suffered from severe arthritis.&lt;br /&gt;It truly works. I had a prior hip joint injury for months with no successful pain management. A few hot baths with Arnica oil and I&#x27;m completely healed. Now I can enjoy running and working out with no issues.&lt;br /&gt;If the U.S ever stopped manufacturing this product, I would procure my own stash from Germany. It&#x27;s that great.&lt;br /&gt;And for you athletes, this product also significantly reduces sore muscles.&lt;br /&gt;I cant say enough good things about this product. You will not be disappointed.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing! Truly refreshes and soothes my tired joints and muscles so I can keep on pushing through my workouts.</li>
    <li> Great smelling massage oil. Really warms up when rubbed on skin.</li>
    <li> LOVE this! Great for a long soak after a tough workout—it even makes me sleep better. Sometimes I mix with epson salts. I&#x27;d highly recommended. It makes a terrific gift, too.</li>
    <li> Great for sore muscles after therapeutic massage! Warm water &amp; Arnica Joint &amp; Muscle Rescue and a little epsom salt help with healing.</li>
    <li> All Kneipp products are excellent</li>
    <li> I love Kneipp bath products.  This one I had not tried, but it did not disappoint.</li>
    <li> After a day of x/c skiing, there is  nothing like a hot jacuzzi with epsom salts and this bath oil. It smells great abd soothes the muscles.</li>
    <li> This has been a very nice way to bathe.  The fragrance is very slight but the muscle relief is wonderful.</li>
    <li> Very fast service.  good quality product</li>
    <li> Taking hot baths is one of life&#x27;s great treats.  I do it twice a day.  Kneipp Joint &amp; Muscle Rescue Bath simply adds to the pleasure.</li>
    <li> This stuff is wonderful.  It feels so good to soak in a hot bath with this added.  Smells nice and clean.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite of the Kneipp oils - good for aching muscles, with a light foam encouraged by jets.</li>
    <li> I have osteoarthritis, and this stuff is great. It smells great and is very relaxing. The bottle was a little smaller than I imagined but I suppose I should have looked at the description better. Also, the bottle drips from the cap when using it to measure the portion, and leaves a soapy oil spot on the shelf. But the actual product is great, does not really bubble up, but is awesome for my arthritis.</li>
    <li> I use other Arnica products for relief from joint and muscle&lt;br /&gt;distress.  I was given a bottle of this recently and realize it&lt;br /&gt;adds to the soothing qualities of Arnica all over my body.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never used arnica before, so I can&#x27;t compare this to other products that contain arnica.  However, I do know that it makes for a relaxing bath and I think that it helped my aching muscles feel better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It smells herbal but also medicinal, but not necessarily in the bad way that those words often indicate.  The pine smell is actually pretty strong (it predominates) and lingers in the air for awhile after you drain the bathwater.  I felt fresh and clean after soaking in a bath with this for awhile.  I had aching muscles from doing more exercise than normal the day before and I think this helped at least a little bit.  (The hot water from the bath probably also helped.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like that this doesn&#x27;t contain artificial colors like some of the other Kniepp products.  It does have a faint yellow color, probably due to some of the natural extracts.  I think it was effective at low strength; that is, if the bottle says &amp;#34;use for 5-10 baths,&amp;#34; I&#x27;d use 10% of the bottle each time.  I also soaked for longer than the recommended 15-20 minutes without any ill effect, though I only use this about once a week.  I&#x27;m not sure it would be advisable to use this every single day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin felt soft afterwards and I found this non-irritating (sometimes fragrances cause irritation for me; I have sensitive skin).  I wouldn&#x27;t say this helped soften my skin or anything, but since the advertised objective was to relieve muscle aches, and I think this helped with that, I&#x27;d say I was happy with the product.  I have a packet of herbs (including arnica) from the same company so I&#x27;m going to try that in my bath next before deciding which form I&#x27;d prefer for future use.  Glad I got the chance to try this, though, most definitely!</li>
    <li> I suffer from Osteoarthritis and have frequent flare ups. I found this quite effective in easing some of the pain temporarily after soaking in Arnica daily. I prefer this to the crystal Arnica which I also use. It does not stain my towels or tub.</li>
