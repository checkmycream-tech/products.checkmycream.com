      <li>It has a strong smell but it is pleasing to those who like stronger smells..  </li>
      <li>This item product description and image is accurate.  </li>
      <li>but none of them were as clean smelling or heated as well as this</li>
      <li>The smoke is healing like sage but strong and powerful medicine.</li>
      <li>Unusual, potent effluvium.  </li>

      <li>ok for white Copal, gold is better</li>

      <li>So fresh .</li>
      <li>It does not dirty your place.  </li>

      <li>It is clean, lingering and very therapeudic.</li>

      <li>Love the white co pal.</li>
      <li>This Copal is by far superior than some of the other brands I have used.</li>

      <li>High quality for this low price :)</li>

      <li>I know some people like large chunks</li>
      <li>melts very fast not slow like Frank.  </li>
      <li>will put out charcoal if use too much.</li>
      <li>This can go straight into a spice grinder.</li>
      <li>Thanks</li>
      <li>Finding the real product was a goal that this seller has shouldered me to have achieved.  </li>
      <li>, I should have never bought so much.</li>
      <li>Just as Described Clean White Copal !</li>
      <li>This is really a high quality item I wasn&#x27;t expecting the amount and the quality.</li>
      <li>It only takes a little to add a nice copal scent to your atmosphere.</li>
      <li>Large sized granules, and not crushed.</li>
      <li>This is my second time purchasing Copal from this seller but the first time ordering  1 lb.</li>
      <li>its hard to find up here in Maine, I have been able to give some to others who had been looking for it.</li>
      <li>Be careful how much you apply to your coals, it smuthers the heat fast.</li>
      <li>so I really prefer smaller</li>
      <li>A reasonable amount on the charcoal would actually melt, solidify and choke the charcoal out.  </li>
      <li>You do not need a whole lot to get the aromas flowing and the one pnd bag is bound to last for a long while.  </li>
      <li>Just be careful to not add to much at the same time or the charcoal dies.</li>

<li> I was afraid that it would be stinky and full of fillers but that was not the case.</li>
<li> It may look like Copal but it stinks to high heaven!!!</li>
<li> I suggest only using small amounts on the coal, if you use coal and add a little at a time not to smother the coal.</li>
<li> Wanted to smell Frankincense like at church, this is overpowering and not nearly as good.</li>
<li> I&#x27;m just writing off as a bad deal on my part</li>
<li> I must say each time I burn from this bag I am extremely disappointed.</li>
<li> Because that is what I base my choices on.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Nice and clean.And like they said there was no fillers. Gave some to my people and they love it to</li>
    <li> I must say each time I burn from this bag I am extremely disappointed. Not only did I have to sort out all the junk fillers in the bag, it is not 100% Copal Resin! It may look like Copal but it stinks to high heaven!!! When I do luck out and burn Copal pieces, it&#x27;s very nice. I will not be buying from this supplier again despite all the &amp;#34;rave&amp;#34; reviews. Because that is what I base my choices on.</li>
    <li> This item product description and image is accurate.  The incense smells wonderful, takes its time to burn and it burns clean.  You do not need a whole lot to get the aromas flowing and the one pnd bag is bound to last for a long while.  The aroma is not overpowering either. It was an excellent purchase and I reccomend it.</li>
    <li> Just as Described Clean White Copal ! So fresh . So clean ! Thank you!</li>
    <li> What a great deal on a nice bag of clean Copal, no fillers, very high quality, and the scent is amazing!</li>
    <li> Great smoke and wonderful authentic aroma!</li>
    <li> The seller had the description of this product right.  It has a strong smell but it is pleasing to those who like stronger smells..  The description is as the seller said...  I would buy this product again...</li>
    <li> Another great product no mixture, real and original. The smoke is natural and light.  It does not dirty your place.  Finding the real product was a goal that this seller has shouldered me to have achieved.  Trust this one get it form him/ her.</li>
    <li> This stuff was junk.  It wouldn&#x27;t burn off or away as other resins will. A reasonable amount on the charcoal would actually melt, solidify and choke the charcoal out.  I can&#x27;t give the stuff away.  I&#x27;m just writing off as a bad deal on my part, I should have never bought so much. I should have tried it first it a smaller quantity, not that that&#x27;s a guarantee of good resin in bulk.  Still hunting for a good supplier.....</li>
    <li> Love the white co pal. It&#x27;s burns nice n clean, the fragrance is divine. Good stuff</li>
    <li> We used it a couple of times with very good results. Very good product for the price you pay. Thanks</li>
    <li> The smoke is healing like sage but strong and powerful medicine. Be careful how much you apply to your coals, it smuthers the heat fast.</li>
    <li> ok for white Copal, gold is better it fragrence is what you are looking for. melts very fast not slow like Frank.  will put out charcoal if use too much.</li>
    <li> Very nice and golden, smells fabulous</li>
    <li> Large sized granules, and not crushed. Title says &amp;#34;clean no fillers&amp;#34; and the product lives up to it! High quality for this low price :)</li>
    <li> This is really a high quality item I wasn&#x27;t expecting the amount and the quality. Very pleased!</li>
    <li> its hard to find up here in Maine, I have been able to give some to others who had been looking for it. Thank You!</li>
    <li> a great fat sack of clean quality copal</li>
    <li> Clean scent burning and great value!</li>
    <li> i amm happy with this copal the price  the quality  all of it. I think there was someone complaining(or should I say pointing out ) about  the dust at the bottom of the bag but as i like to crush  my copal in  a mortar  before i use it  it is not  a problem</li>
    <li> As advertised-clean large quantity burns well/gives off lots of smoke/ no problems a  buy for the price/shipped as promised on time arrival.</li>
    <li> I am extremely happy with this Copal.  It smells great and came in small pieces.  I know some people like large chunks but they do not melt as evenly or easily so I really prefer smaller pieces.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is the clear light yellow white kind.  I have seen other resins called Copal and tried some but none of them were as clean smelling or heated as well as this type.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Really a great incense at a great price.</li>
    <li> This incense inspires images of times long gone, when the sacred was found in the simple and when Peace was sought</li>
    <li> acts like a resin when burring.  the fragrance isnt the same as attending a service.  I wouldnt recommend to those who enjoy the fragrance of church, poor imitation.</li>
    <li> This is my second time purchasing Copal from this seller but the first time ordering  1 lb. This Copal is by far superior than some of the other brands I have used. It is clean, lingering and very therapeudic. I will definitely order again from this Seller his products are always of good quality and shipped well.</li>
    <li> I give this product four star only because of the work involved in using this product correctly. See my other review of Benzoin for back ground.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To its credit this resin is much smaller and you can skip a step by not having to use a mortar/pestal. This can go straight into a spice grinder.</li>
    <li> A great 1 lb package at a reasonable price of resin nuggets that probably make great incense (which it is advertised to do). I was looking for Copal resin for medicinal purposes which this is not and which it did not claim to be.</li>
    <li> I got a bunch of incense resin and I love the way the white copal burns. There is a nice smell and it burn nice. Just be careful to not add to much at the same time or the charcoal dies.</li>
    <li> Wanted to smell Frankincense like at church, this is overpowering and not nearly as good.</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with my purchase. I was afraid that it would be stinky and full of fillers but that was not the case. The resin has a light, pleasant scent and it burns easily. Just be sure to use the charcoal discs with it. I mixed mine with frankincense and myrrh with a touch of dragon&#x27;s blood. Very nice! I will definitely purchase this again.</li>
    <li> The resin is very clean and the price is great. The friends who received this gift were very happy with it and surprised at the quality and quantity.</li>
    <li> Good clean burn. Good for the stones in lodge</li>
    <li> Unusual, potent effluvium.  Melts quickly so don&#x27;t use much or you will smoke yourself out and drown your burning charcoal!</li>
    <li> It only takes a little to add a nice copal scent to your atmosphere. I suggest only using small amounts on the coal, if you use coal and add a little at a time not to smother the coal.</li>
