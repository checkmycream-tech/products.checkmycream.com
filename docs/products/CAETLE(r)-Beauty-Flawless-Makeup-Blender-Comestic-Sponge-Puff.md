      <li>love it</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s ok , not my fav.</li>

      <li>, it&#x27;s AFFORDABLE and is very easy to clean.</li>
      <li>Very cute and mushy looks exactly like the picture</li>
      <li>This is easy to hold, and use.</li>
      <li>blends pretty well, pretty good for its price</li>
      <li>I wasn&#x27;t very happy they were waaaay to small</li>
      <li>I find myself using my clean hands instead.</li>
      <li>Takes FOREVER to be delivered, but overall a good buy</li>
      <li>Not to face paint makeup, but are good to regular makeup.</li>

      <li>I love these magic little blenders, everyday use for me, the application is non streaky and just beautiful.</li>
      <li>The only problem was that I was waiting for the item more than one month, but it was totally worthy.</li>
      <li>I was worried at first that this would suck up all my makeup and leave nothing to apply to my face.</li>
      <li>Such a cheaper alternative to the beauty blender, I love this sponge.</li>
      <li>Thanks!</li>
      <li>came super early...</li>
      <li>It works really well</li>
      <li>I really like this beauty blender.</li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t absorb as much water as I would like</li>
      <li>This works really well with liquid foundation &amp; concealer.</li>
      <li>It soaks up too much of the liquid.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s really spongy which helps with foundation.</li>
      <li>Fantastic, especially for the price.</li>
      <li>- Smaller then the original beauty sponges</li>
      <li>I need a new one!</li>
      <li>It is very soft to my skin, the color is like the one in the picture, and the size is very convenient for highlighting, countouring, etc.</li>
      <li>Very soft!</li>
      <li>so it is more stiff.</li>
      <li>so cheap because I will probably be throwing it away due to the horrendous smell.</li>
      <li>This wacky little contraption is ahh-mazing!</li>
      <li>This little thing is garbage compared to my rouge smooth blender</li>
      <li>I love this, although it&#x27;s a little smaller than one would think</li>
      <li>Definitely not a typical beauty blender, but it gets the job done!  </li>
      <li>Took a while to revive but that&#x27;s the only thing that I didn&#x27;t like other than that it&#x27;s worth it for the price and works better than any other beauty blender I&#x27;ve used from stores!</li>
      <li>For the price this little thing is defiantly worth it.</li>
      <li>Very stiff and doesn&#x27;t absorb water or expand like the original beauty blender.</li>

<li> For the price this little thing is defiantly worth it.</li>
<li> Very stiff and doesn&#x27;t absorb water or expand like the original beauty blender.</li>
<li> It seems the sponge is a but harder to apply because it is a little more rough than a typical one; however, it works well when adding oil or lotion to the sponge before applying.  </li>
<li> The brushes use to leave brush strokes, this weird foam thing seems to spread things soothe and a light application.</li>
<li> It took a long periodically time to get here</li>
<li> and I got the other ones for the same price</li>
<li> When I bought it, it was only .89¢, so I guess the price went up a little hahah.</li>
<li> UNUSABLE!!&lt;br /&gt;IT TOOK WEEKS TO DELIVER, NOT WORTH</li>
<li> I mean they do work like the bigger ones I previously order</li>
<li> The only issue is how small it is, but I use it for my contour and highlight everyday!</li>
<li> Dont waste your money on this.</li>
<li> use everyday.</li>
<li> Took 3 weeks and extremely small</li>
<li> I usually use it couple of times per week, and I have washed it twice already, no problems at all.</li>
<li> but these are too small</li>
<li> It&#x27;s a small sponge, but it gets the job done.</li>
<li> No more!</li>
<li> The stuff is not good</li>
<li> It takes like 3 weeks just for it to get here , wich sucks!</li>
<li> Maybe it&#x27;s just me doing something wrong</li>
<li> So I tested it and that&#x27;s why it&#x27;s dirty</li>
<li> Terrible quality and hard as a rock</li>
<li> TERRIBLE - HARD AND</li>
<li> Its quality can be compared with no doubt to very expensive blenders.</li>
<li> but VERY small and has a terrible odor that I can not seem to get rid of.</li>
<li> I have always used the flimsy makeup sponges and hated them.</li>

    <li> Very cute and mushy looks exactly like the picture</li>
    <li> Love love love love it!!!!</li>
    <li> I LOVE THIIIS . ugh the best way to set my makeup on my face thank you so much ♥ def, buying more at this price</li>
    <li> I LOVE it. It works really well, it&#x27;s AFFORDABLE and is very easy to clean. I will be purchasing this product again!</li>
    <li> I was worried at first that this would suck up all my makeup and leave nothing to apply to my face. I was happy to discover the squishy foam blender doesn&#x27;t suck up the makeup, and it actually spreads it around my face flawlessly. I like this more then the brushes I&#x27;ve been using. This is easy to hold, and use. The brushes use to leave brush strokes, this weird foam thing seems to spread things soothe and a light application. The texture of the foam is thicker then you might think. For the price this little thing is defiantly worth it.</li>
    <li> Got here early and works great!</li>
    <li> It took a long periodically time to get here but I love it 😀☺️</li>
    <li> When I bought it, it was only .89¢, so I guess the price went up a little hahah. But I LOVE IT! It&#x27;s so cute and work perfectly! Very soft!</li>
    <li> just what i needed.  it works great</li>
    <li> blends pretty well, pretty good for its price</li>
    <li> This was a great deal for the price, these are godd for applying base make up and washable also.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s good and does the job. Not as well as the teardrop shaped beauty blender though. Doesn&#x27;t absorb as much water as I would like so it is more stiff.</li>
    <li> The stuff is not good but when I order the jewlery I love it</li>
    <li> It soaks up too much of the liquid.  I find myself using my clean hands instead.</li>
    <li> came super early... i love it!!</li>
    <li> Such a cheaper alternative to the beauty blender, I love this sponge. The only issue is how small it is, but I use it for my contour and highlight everyday! Life saver.</li>
    <li> Terrible quality and hard as a rock</li>
    <li> Amazing! Blends so well. Truly flawless</li>
    <li> I love this, although it&#x27;s a little smaller than one would think</li>
    <li> use everyday. love it</li>
    <li> TERRIBLE - HARD AND UNUSABLE!!&lt;br /&gt;IT TOOK WEEKS TO DELIVER, NOT WORTH MY DOLLAR!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ALSO DOES NOT SOAK WATER!</li>
    <li> Smoothes out the makeup wonderfully. Makeup is laid!</li>
    <li> I used this twice and gave it to my daughter for her play makeup, I didn&#x27;t like it at all! Maybe it&#x27;s just me doing something wrong (don&#x27;t think it would be that but ya never know) but it absorbs all the product!</li>
    <li> Great beauty blender!</li>
    <li> Dont waste your money on this. It takes like 3 weeks just for it to get here , wich sucks! And it doesnt blend as well.</li>
    <li> Took a while to get it but Im glad I got it!</li>
    <li> I really like this beauty blender. Its quality can be compared with no doubt to very expensive blenders.

    <li> products works better than the one i bought at Walmart for $4.</li>
    <li> Very stiff and doesn&#x27;t absorb water or expand like the original beauty blender. I know it&#x27;s only a dollar but dupes are meant to duplicate the product, no? Don&#x27;t buy this!</li>
    <li> Love using it ! Helps me apply my makeup easier</li>
    <li> This wacky little contraption is ahh-mazing! I have always used the flimsy makeup sponges and hated them. No more! I found my perfect tool.</li>
    <li> As described!  Thanks!</li>
    <li> This little thing is garbage compared to my rouge smooth blender</li>
    <li> So I tested it and that&#x27;s why it&#x27;s dirty but yeah, it works and I like it. ^~^</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t very happy they were waaaay to small I mean they do work like the bigger ones I previously order but these are too small and I got the other ones for the same price</li>
    <li> i received 3 and only one was not torn up..</li>
    <li> - Smaller then the original beauty sponges but it will still work and get the job done well...&lt;br /&gt;- Took forever to receive it...&lt;br /&gt;- I wish the sponge would have been packaged and then put in ANOTHER package to be mailed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;** When I do my reviews,I am 100% honest **</li>
    <li> I needed a magnifying glass to find it. Would not purchase again.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s really spongy which helps with foundation.</li>
    <li> I need a new one! I love these magic little blenders, everyday use for me, the application is non streaky and just beautiful.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m giving 3stars  because it came wrapped</li>
    <li> Took 3 weeks and extremely small</li>
    <li> it makes me easily blend my concealer :)</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a small sponge, but it gets the job done.</li>
    <li> This works really well with liquid foundation &amp; concealer.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok , not my fav. I&#x27;ll just stick to my brushes.</li>
    <li> I love it.  It works amazingly</li>
    <li> Definitely not a typical beauty blender, but it gets the job done!  It seems the sponge is a but harder to apply because it is a little more rough than a typical one; however, it works well when adding oil or lotion to the sponge before applying.  Takes FOREVER to be delivered, but overall a good buy</li>
    <li> Took a while to revive but that&#x27;s the only thing that I didn&#x27;t like other than that it&#x27;s worth it for the price and works better than any other beauty blender I&#x27;ve used from stores! Would definitely recommend!! Doesn&#x27;t suck up much makeup at all!! Love it!</li>
    <li> Not to face paint makeup, but are good to regular makeup.</li>
    <li> Fantastic, especially for the price.</li>
    <li> It works technically...but VERY small and has a terrible odor that I can not seem to get rid of. Good thing it wasb so cheap because I will probably be throwing it away due to the horrendous smell. Shipping also took FOREVER but I did receive it on time.</li>
