<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Unfortunately I am quite disappointed.  The black is really more of a gray and it was sadly not waterproof by any mean.  By mid day it was a mess.  Going to go back to my go-to eyeliner, which is the Clio Waterproof Pen Liner Kill Black.</li>
    <li> Fiber tip is used the most and is somewhat bent.</li>
    <li> I hate eyeliner.  It&#x27;s hard to apply and never looks good.  Well, that was until I found this product.  I was looking for something to replace the $25 Stila liner that had dried and was thrilled to find something for $7 that works even better.  This product is like a tiny, soft marker.  It goes on in a skinny line that you can increase as desired.  But my favorite characteristic is the fact that the liner color stays &amp;#34;open&amp;#34; for a short time and that allows you to take a brush and smudge or smooth it easily.  I have no problem with it staying on all day.</li>
    <li> Very nice , perfect,  I loved,  I like everything</li>
    <li> Great, easy to use product. Definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m awful at doing my eyeliner, I have nerve damage so 90% of the times my hands are numb or just plain hurt! I&#x27;ve got a make up drawer filled with liners I&#x27;ve failed with! BUT this eyeliner has made it to my makeup bag! I use it everyday, it&#x27;s great for a nice winged liner and it&#x27;s easily built up, so you can go slim or bold. The tip is perfect, and it&#x27;s such a dark bold black. Love it will order more  with my next amazon order because its sold out everywhere here in VEGAS!</li>
    <li> The eyeliner is easy to apply, but I live in a very warm climate and I was lucky enough to apply before I went out and I ended up with black eyes!  It ran really bad.  I would not recommend!</li>
    <li> good price and quick shipment</li>
    <li> I normally shy away from this style of liner.  Usually ink liners with felt tip applicators disappoint, the black will look almost gray or sheer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This little wonder deposits the right color!  I&#x27;m not that impressed with the slim tip, I can get the same slim lines from other liners.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The item came shrink-wrapped, not in normal drugstore packaging (cardboard with plastic shell) which made me a little nervous about its condition.</li>
    <li> Love it.  This is only eyeliner that allows me to draw a perfect, straight line.</li>
    <li> This eyeliner is amazing use it everyday ans it makes the perfect cat eye. love it absolutely love it only eye liner I will ever use again</li>
    <li> i love it!! I am always in the rush... and this helps you make that perfect line.</li>
    <li> Great Product!  Great Seller!</li>
    <li> This is my FAVORITE eyeliner EVER I use it every day and it is so easy to get the perfect look and you can pretty much do anything with it.</li>
    <li> Just what I expected .</li>
    <li> best eyeliner I have ever found.. the skinny tip makes it so much easier and cleaner to make a cateye. I switched from the Revlon pen.</li>
    <li> the black is to dark for me but it stays on really well</li>
    <li> Effing love it. Seems to dry out a little quicker than the store bought ones, but they are also almost impossible to find at any store. So still totally worth it.</li>
    <li> Given the pricepoint, this is a decent liner.  It goes on easily, but takes a careful hand.  The line is very thin, and making it wider requires more passes.  If you don&#x27;t get it perfect, correcting it is tough and it doesn&#x27;t smudge easily.  I don&#x27;t dislike this liner but I don&#x27;t love it either.</li>
    <li> Someone should have invented this product long ago! It is lightweight and small; fits easily in your bag. It is extremely easy to control, the brush is ever so skinny and makes a perfect thin line along your lid right against the base of your lashes. It doesn&#x27;t skip. It doesn&#x27;t smudge. I love it!</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this eyeliner, works wonders for more control on drawing fine lines on your face.&lt;br /&gt;Well worth it.</li>
    <li> my favorite eyeliner, so black and solid, and it creates a really sharp line that I love</li>
    <li> My wife tells me this is very easy to use, the tip is rigid enough for precise control but pliable enough for layering and subtle application.&lt;br /&gt;The color is deep and rich, and very very long lasting.&lt;br /&gt;In fact if you had to make a complaint it would be that it&#x27;s not that easy to get off if you make an error.&lt;br /&gt;Cheap, but not cheaply made. Sleek purse size carry design, and thus far has lasted very well.</li>
    <li> Not as thin as I expected it to be.  But it is long-lasting and looks nice throughout the day.  I&#x27;d probably purchase it again.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t wear makeup on a daily basis but know I will have to do so at an upcoming wedding.  Back when I used to wear makeup, the only eyeliner I used came in a jar with a brush and I painted it on.  I tried other liners - it was hard to get a solid line, or they pulled my eyelid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This L&#x27;Oreal liner is great.  I can create a line from very slim to as thick as I want.  It goes on evenly and dries fast.  The line is quite sharp but can be smudged if desired while still wet.  It&#x27;s more like a felt-tip than a pencil, so no drag.  It has great staying power but comes off easily with makeup remover pads.  I am completely satisfied.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s lower than my expectation. It creases.</li>
    <li> I got this for my wife to try, and here&#x27;s what she had to say:&lt;br /&gt;For someone who has not worn eyeliner for a long time and was looking for something easy to use, this was it. The line is very fine, easy to apply and the color black was just the right shade and thickness. It stayed on well, didn&#x27;t smudge, even though I was teary eyed while wearing it - at my son&#x27;s wedding! All in all, it was a good product and I would use it and buy it again.</li>
    <li> I love this eyeliner and can&#x27;t seem to find it in any store now, although there doesn&#x27;t seem to be a reason why not.  I finally just bought several on here.  The liner is great.  Smooth lines, and the tip makes it easy to do thin or thick lines.  Doesn&#x27;t skip and takes very little time to get the perfect line.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always wanted to get a super thin line with an eyeliner, but it either comes out too thick, it&#x27;s hard to correct mistakes, or it smudges too easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;L&#x27;Oreal&#x27;s super thin liner does away with all three problems. This is the thinnest line I&#x27;ve ever gotten, and so far, no mistakes. Super easy to control, and it lasts, unlike crayon liners.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I thoroughly recommend it to people who are less than artistic with eyeliner (like me!)</li>
    <li> Absolutely  excellent  product.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my daughter, and it was better than she expected.</li>
    <li> Love this eyeliner. Ive always hated the brush liquid eyeliner and could never get it quite right. Have purchased pens like this before and it acted more like a permanent marker that had been left without the cap on for far too long. This one is perfect!! love love love.</li>
    <li> this is one of the nicest eyeliners I have ever used.</li>
    <li> I love this liner, like absolutely love it. It&#x27;s great to use if you aren&#x27;t used to putting on liquid liner. Goes on smoothly and the pointed felt tip make it very easy to get an even straight line. My only issue with the product is that the liner doesn&#x27;t come out dark enough, which is why I gave it 4/5 stars. Other than that, it&#x27;s my second favorite liner out of my collection.</li>
    <li> Honestly one of the better decisions I&#x27;ve made. I used to use Maybelleine, which, word of advice, is a cheap buy and gives you what you paid for--lines that run and don&#x27;t come on well. L&#x27;Oreal Paris was my attempt to find a still reasonably priced replacement, and I definitely recommend! My other eyeliner would be mostly off by the end of the day. I can take naps in this stuff and it&#x27;s still mostly on when I wake up. The lines are clean, do not run, and stay on beautifully. Will definitely be purchasing again.</li>
    <li> Favorite eye liner to date. I&#x27;ll never try another!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried many liquid eyeliner (including others from L&#x27;oreal) and are tired of them smudging quickly.  This seems to be pretty good.</li>
    <li> The tip dries out very quickly while I&#x27;m using it, even though I store the liner tip-side-down. Before I can even do two cat eyes (very subtle cat eyes, I don&#x27;t use very much liner) it&#x27;s dry. If it weren&#x27;t for it drying out too quickly, it would be an okay liner. But it isn&#x27;t worth the price.</li>
    <li> Lasts and goes on so easy. Love.</li>
    <li> This product appeared to be nearly empty when it arrived.  The applicator portion is easily used with other products however.  I am just using it for that purpose.  I won&#x27;t order these products again.</li>
    <li> Great eyeliner, very easy to use. Love how slim the eyeliner is &amp; makes precise clean lines. This is my new go to eyeliner.</li>
    <li> My new must have eyeliner! Hasn&#x27;t dried out on me yet, and super precise. Inexpensive, but can stand it&#x27;s ground against the luxury eyeliners.</li>
    <li> I have tried every liquid liner on the market by now and i swear it wasnt for me until i met this one. My hands are usually not too steady with these things however this one is just the right texture to make it easy to draw on. Love it... now im liquid liner freak. Everyone at work told me the loveeee the way my eyes look these days and its because of my new product. Yayyyy Loreal... Im now a fan!</li>
    <li> I do not have the ability to draw a straight line, nevermind use liquid eyeliner, but this is so easy that even I get it right every time.</li>
    <li> If you are a lover of the winged-eye look, then this is definitely the eyeliner for you. Although it is liquid, it is totally not messy at all. You can draw precise lines with its pen design. And even after a full day of wear and tear, this liner stays in the exact lines that were originally created.</li>
    <li> Its not waterproof. And gets smears  if ur eye become wet .</li>
    <li> This is the first time that I have tried an eyeliner of this type, that isn&#x27;t the pencil eyeliner.  I really like it and probably won&#x27;t go back to the pencil type eyeliners.  It&#x27;s easy to put on, glides on smoothly and makes a nice fine line.  I love that I don&#x27;t have to sharpen the pencil from time to time.  The black color isn&#x27;t too harsh either.</li>
    <li> With its precise tip and easy flow, this liquid liner is awesome. But you must have a steady hand as this liner is not forgiving. Stays on for hours without smudging until I accidently rub my eyes! Great dramatic effect with its deep black color : )</li>
    <li> Great liquid eyeliner, it goes on smooth, with a thin and long tip, and dries fast!  Really like the applicator, easy to apply, no issues.  Smart dark black, and washes off easily with makeup remover or soap: really like it, would definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> Easy to apply and looks good on. Last all day for me.</li>
    <li> It will do in a pinch but I didn&#x27;t like how thick it was.  I like the fine tip, but it&#x27;s too thin to cover much.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m pretty lame with eyeliner.  I don&#x27;t wear it regularly, but as an actress I have to deal with it for stage.  I go back and forth usually between a gel pot and brush and a soft pencil.  I used this for an audition tonight and it was a treat.  If you are sub-confident about eyeliner lines going on well, this is a good bet.  Recommend.</li>
    <li> I started out thinking I would give this product three stars.  It was not easy to put on in a uniform manner.&lt;br /&gt;But then.... someone sent me a very touching email.  My eyes teared up.  And that was all she wrote.  It was like having napalm shoved into my eyes.  I can&#x27;t ever remember them hurting this badly.&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t stand by this product.  It smears.  it is not simple to put on.  It certainly becomes painful upon contact with moist eyes.</li>
    <li> This works perfect from a thin line to a bold one and it is waterproof, but be sure to have  a back up because unlike a pencil, you cannot see when it  is getting low, however it does not just run out. You will see the difference</li>
    <li> I had such high hopes when purchasing this eyeliner because I love L&#x27;Oreal and have been using the lineur intense line for many years. Just wanted to try something different! I gave this eyeliner multiple shots. I love how it looks, very easy to use, and creates a lovely line. However, it smudged on me after just a few hours. The second time around, I wore it to an awards show at night. It couldn&#x27;t have been on my eyes.. less than 4 hours, and then I came home to realize I had some major raccoon eyes! Thank goodness the bright lights didn&#x27;t pick it up so much in photographs but my gosh, up close I looked scary. That was it for me :( I need an eyeliner to for sure last the whole day so this simply won&#x27;t do. Their lineur intense eyeliner however, is truly a holy grail product, it doesn&#x27;t smudge at least and if it fades, it just slightly flakes. I really just cannot stand the raccoon eyes! I get that I have oily lids and it&#x27;s hot here in CA in the summer, but yea, I&#x27;ve used liquid eyeliners before which really did not smudge so easily!</li>
    <li> Great product. Does what it says. Draws a fine liquid black line that you have to remove with makeup remover.</li>
    <li> I was somewhat disappointed in the application of this eyeliner.  It does not go on as thin as advertised.  I have applied several types of eyeliner and I really could not recommend this as one to purchase.</li>
    <li> I wanted a gray liner. I bought one that said it was gray. I brought it home and used it and it was as black as black can be. Fortunately CVS gave me my money back.</li>
    <li> Love this for cat eyes, my teen swiped it so I had to buy another!</li>
    <li> I am 75 years old and have always wanted to use an eyeliner.  This one is so easy to use.  My kids have said my eyes look great.  Every time I used an eyeliner before it always came out uneven and I had to take it off.  It always looked awful. This was simple to use and looked great.</li>
    <li> the product arrived suuuuper quick and safe.  this product goes on really nice. it gives is a solid smooth line if you know what you are doing. great for doing small details. i used it for spider webs on my eyes for a costume.  unfortunately it washes off really super easy. just a little bit of water takes it right off no soap needed so its not very long lasting.  i would totally buy a waterproof version if it exists however i would never pay $8 for this particular product again.</li>
    <li> Per the wife this is a Great price, great product, two to a package so cant beat this deal anywhere.</li>
    <li> I was shocked to find this product which normally retails for around $7 at only $4, and on top of that with free shipping! This is my favorite eyeliner, it&#x27;s precise, waterproof, and has very long wear. The tip is perfect for drawing any line thickness, and it&#x27;s very easy to get exactly the look you want. Overall a fantastic product, and I will be returning :) best buying experience on amazon so far.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t come on too heavy and was alot cheaper than other brand names that do the same thing, it seems like all the make up companies are copying each other tho</li>
    <li> I loved this eyeliner very easy to apply.</li>
    <li> a little tricky to use, but otherwise great</li>
    <li> The tip of this pen is perfect for lining as close to your eyelash line as you can possibly get. This adds a dramatic effect to my eyes while at the same time, the thin line is subtle enough that it looks nautral. When I wear this as a thin line along my lash line the eyeliner lasts at least 12 hours, but when I wear it in a thick, winged out cat eye look, it doesn&#x27;t last long at all. It smudges and fades very quickly. I&#x27;m impressed enough with the slim tip of this liner pen that would purchase this again, but only to wear close to my lash line. For cat eyes, I&#x27;ll have to find a different smudge proof liner with more staying power.</li>
    <li> i got this a month ago. today is only the third time using it and is already drying. thats the only problem, otherwise it would be perfect...it didnt come in the original package so makes me wonder.... UGH wth.. i ordered online because the walmart i went to was out. but next time ill clear my schedule and check every walmart and target</li>
    <li> Huge fan.  True to the name. Stays on. Easy application. I will purchase again.  Its great how you can draw a fine line or thicken it up easily</li>
    <li> love it ... want more color options!! ;-)</li>
    <li> Slick and easy to use. Solid black. I&#x27;d say this is on par with Urban Decay&#x27;s liquid eyeliners.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been testing different liquid eyeliners over the past few months, and this has to be one of my favorites. The tip has just enough give for a nice &#x27;wing&#x27;, but is solid enough to be precise. Very long lasting - doesn&#x27;t flake or melt after a few hours like some products I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
    <li> Love the control of line with this brush.  Love that I can make the a hairline thin line or sculpted Amy Winehouse look.  Love that after application, I can smudge the line for a softer smokier look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But why oh why, only black?  With my fair coloring, and now going to soft white frost with age -- and a sizable demographic the same as me -- why not a softer color?</li>
    <li> the liner bleeds a bit when you put it on.  It doesn&#x27;t have a lot of hold power to it.</li>
    <li> And this makes it way easier. I have found if you get cellophane tape,( the kind you use for wrapping Xmas gifts), you tear off a small piece and angle it up at the corner of your eye, you should be golden. Start from the middle and work your way out. I am crap at applying liner and q tips are my best friend, but this liner does make it a whole lot easier. It doesn&#x27;t budge either and I live in Florida.</li>
    <li> Love it. I&#x27;ve found the perfect eyeliner... Easy to use. Wasn&#x27;t very good at appling eyeliner before. I would never get it right. Now I&#x27;m an expert.</li>
    <li> Out of the box, this liner is great. Is has a cap that stays on, and a grip for ease of use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have dark brown eyes and hair, so I tend to use blacks rather than browns. This liner goes on smooth like a liquid liner with a brush, but is easy to control like a pencil. No gaps, skipping, drying out, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It stays on all day (although sweat tends to make it a shade lighter at the end of a long day). You should take caution your lids are dry and clean before applying, because when you open your eyes, the liner can transfer to your upper lids leaving an additional line and making you look like a mess :P&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wear it almost every day, sometimes instead of mascara!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I LOVE THIS LINER!</li>
    <li> This eyeliner is AMAZING. I wanted something precise with bold color, and this is exactly that. Also, If you like to do winged liner, it looks really good. The formula isn&#x27;t too thick or too runny, just right. I had purchased the Stila liquid liner before this and it was good for a few uses, but the formula was to runny and not very opaque. So compare this for 8 dollars to the Stila for 22 AND bad quality? This is an amazing buy!</li>
    <li> I love this liner. I really suck at lining my eyes so I never do. I always swerve or the line is crooked or too thick &amp; I have never been able to pull off the cat eye look. But this liner makes it super easy. The tip is so fine u could write with it but it&#x27;s soft. And if u want a thicker line, u can apply a little more pressure or tilt &amp; use the side of the tip. And such a good price on Amazon. At LEAST a few dollars cheaper than you&#x27;ll find it in stores.</li>
    <li> GGOD PRODUCT,WILL REORDER</li>
    <li> Nice. It lasts pretty long time.</li>
    <li> The felt tip is perfect. It is able to line right along the eyelash line. It dries fairly quickly. The black stays on during the day and even through a workout. I have not had it run at all. Store the item on its side. I usually have my eyeliners upright in a brush holder but with this one you want to store it flat. I heard it keeps the felt tip wet and so far it seems to be holding true.</li>
    <li> I have been looking everywhere to replace my Lancome liquid liner, I wish I&#x27;d experimented with more colors when I purchased this liner.  It fits the bill for about 20 bucks cheaper than the Lancome.  It lasts all day long, washes off at night when I wash my face.  Sometimes I need to use an eye makeup wipe to get all of the residue off but I&#x27;d rather have that problem than needing to reapply during the day.  So excited that I bought this after wasting about $50 trying out other brands.</li>
    <li> Love the color but not used to applying a liquid liner.  Liner seems a little runny to me but this may be a normal characteristic of a liquid liner.  Difficult to apply but may improve with practice.  Not the eye liner for a beginner to applying liquid liner.</li>
    <li> This eyeliner goes on easily and stays on until you take it off, which I use baby oil and that removes it easily.  Would highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> This is really a great eyeliner, exactly because of its slim and precise tip. It is one of the thinnest I have seen, making it very easy to make a perfect eyeliner wing! Other eyeliners of similar nature seem to have very flexible tips - this is not something that I (personally) want when creating my eyeliner wing. Rather, this eyeliner tip is more sturdy, but it is still a bit flexible, and I like that!</li>
    <li> This is very Easy to use. One of the best liners I have used. I would recommend the product too anyone.</li>
    <li> Perfect for beginners with liquid eyeliner. It was so easy to use. No smudging or running. It didn&#x27;t fade, lasted all day but came off easily when washed off.</li>
    <li> Great for cat eyes and it doesn&#x27;t smug at all. The line can be nice and thin or you can ad more to appear thicker. It&#x27;s so easy to use and if you mess up just use a wet makeup brush or Q-tip as an eraser.</li>
    <li> By far, the easiest and darkest formula I&#x27;ve used for the money. Nice thin line produced that you can make thicker by turning the pen.</li>
    <li> It comes out kind of jagged and I am really good at eyeliner. Would not buy it again.&lt;br /&gt;I had to keep going over it to fill in the messy parts.</li>
    <li> I love this eyeliner!  So easy to use!</li>
    <li> Will definitely buy again!</li>
    <li> The applicator is entirely too fine. Leaves an unnatural, shiny and jagged line of eyeliner in your lid that is difficult to refine or thicken without making a mess. Not my favorite. I prefer the revlon felt pen eyeliner.</li>
    <li> piece came with no packaging as in the image, it did not feel comfortable using it as it felt been used before, it is simply opened, i am thinking to return</li>
    <li> I am in my 60s so fairly experienced with putting on eyeliner.  I liked the applicator on this product because I could draw on a very thin line.  As a woman of a certain age, I want an understated look.  I thought I had hit the jackpot when I first looked in the mirror after putting this eyeliner on.  I had managed a thin line that complemented my eyes.  I was very pleased and got myself together to leave for the store.  Thanks heavens I looked in the hallway mirror before I went out the door because my eyes were definitely not understated at that point.  In just a little while I had gone from looking nice to looking like I was going to either a Halloween party or a Goth festival.  The liner had faded around my lash line but spread to my upper lids and under my eyes.  I don&#x27;t have oily lids and I had put on a primer with a light tan eyeshadow.  I have never had a liner run this bad, especially in the time it took for me to go from upstairs to downstairs, feed the dog, and put on my coat.  I know most of the reviews on this product are positive but my experience definitely wasn&#x27;t.  I don&#x27;t know why, I just know that this was the worst eyeliner experience I have had since I started wearing makeup in my teens.  I did try using it again but had pretty much the same experience so tossed it.  I now use Physician&#x27;s Formula Eye Booster 2 in 1.  It has a perfectly controllable and thin brush that allows me to get close to my eyelids and it lasts the entire day.</li>
    <li> This eyeliner works great. It is the perfect black and not runny. If you are liquid eyeliner challenged like me, this is a great one to buy as the brush is super slim. It is great for achieving any look: thin, thick and all the in-betweens.</li>
    <li> A dark black, easy to apply, long lasting eyeliner. Great for those that like to paint lines on the top and bottom lid.</li>
    <li> this is one of my most favorite eyeliners. It&#x27;s easy to use. Not messy and very smooth lines. Great effect.</li>
    <li> It wasn&#x27;t black enough for me. Throughout the day it turns a little off black. Was looking for a cheaper alternative to Stila&#x27;s liquid eyeliner pencil, but this def is not it. It&#x27;s okay for general mediocre eyeliner standards, but it&#x27;s not super dark and intense.</li>
    <li> THIS IS A 100 STAR PRODUCT IT MAKES MY EYELINER EXPIRENCE EASIER AND LESS MESSY. I USUALLY STYLE WITH A CAY EYE LOOK I LOVE IT I CAN MAKE THICK AND THIN EYE LINER LOOKS. BLACEST BLACK IS THE BEST SINCE I LOOK HAVING THAT DRAMATIC LOOK. LOVE THIS EYELINER. THE BEST EYELINER IVE BEEN USING IT FOR ONE YEAR NOW.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical when ordering this liner because i have strictly been using Kat Von D&#x27;s liquid tattoo liner (forgive me for misspelling anything), which is a top seller at sephora. L&#x27;Oreals liner works just as goood for cheaper! the tip is a little harder on the loreal eyeliner..its not a pro or con...just different.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The line comes out really dark and sleek. much easier to use then a typical liquid eyeliner brush (where you have to dip it in the liquid and then keep your hand really steady as u put it on). This eyeliner gives you the look and polish of a liquid eyeliner but is MUCH easier to put on in my opinion. I will be buying this one again!</li>
    <li> I switched to liquid eyeliners after a make-up artist got me hooked.  The effect of a liquid liner is so much prettier than a solid liner and once dry the line doesn&#x27;t smudge.  I have tried several liquid and cream eyeliners and this is the best as far as ease of use and durability.  I have used cream eyeliners in pots with separate brushes and this eyeliner makes that process look unnecessary.  The brush tip is actually like that of a marker so you don&#x27;t get any actually liquid leaking out.  Whatever you brush on your eyes is what comes out.  It is like taking a very thin magic marker to your eyes.  It can be repeated over and over to build layers of the product and create a darker effect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This eyeliner stays on for 12+ hours without a smear.  I do use an eyeshadow base and eyeshadow that helps it stay put.  Without using at least a base eyeshadow this liner will smear black on your lid as the day wears on and oil builds up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only issue is that this stuff stays on so well that you can&#x27;t make a mistake without having to wet the area of the mistake and take everything off.  Just practice, get a steady hand, and this will become your favorite liquid eyeliner.</li>
    <li> Definitely my favorite eyeliner- EVER.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s sharp from the first use to the last. If applied after priming the eyelids, it really lasts long.</li>
    <li> This is a really great very slim eyeliner. I had not found one this slim before. It enhances my eyes more than preciously purchased eyeliners and will not smear.</li>
    <li> The eyeliner is easy to use and a soft tough,however, it had smudged every time i use it. I know it&#x27;s not waterproof, but it&#x27;s a little annoyed.</li>
    <li> Bought this liner after an endless search for one that works and stays put.  This one did not meet expectations, especially for the price.  It lasted maybe 2 hours and smeared giving me raccoon eyes.</li>
    <li> This eyeliner smudges a lot. I was not happy  with this product at all.</li>
    <li> Love this eyeliner it&#x27;s so intense and stays on all day</li>
    <li> Love love love!!! My wings are perfection with this!</li>
    <li> This stuff goes on so easily, and if you mess up it&#x27;s not that hard to wash off, and despite this it stays really dark for a long time. My only issue is because I have oily skin, this stuff tends to fade and smudge over the course of several hours, but it doesn&#x27;t do this much. I fully recommend it</li>
    <li> My local drugstore stopped carrying my regular Lineur Intense Felt Tip liner (which has a tapered felt brush that&#x27;s long and &amp;#34;whippy&amp;#34; like a calligrapher&#x27;s brush and which makes lovely wings at the corners of my eyes each time) so I tried this one instead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pros: This gives very saturated coverage and the tip (also felt but shorter than the Lineur Intense brush), is flexible enough for fine control, but not too thick/brushlike like some liquid applicators. You can draw VERY fine lines, which I really like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cons: This gives me massively, unacceptably smudgy raccoon eyes. And it&#x27;s really hard to wash off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m SO bummed bc I really did like the applicator, but for some reason this just migrates down into the dark areas and creases under my eyes. It&#x27;s weird because the liner above my lashes seems to be holding up well and not flaking, yet somehow it&#x27;s turning up beneath my eyes. I&#x27;ve tried with and without primer, over eyeshadow, under eyeshadow, with setting powder &amp; not, etc., and now I think I may just have to give up. It&#x27;s also crazy stubborn about being washed off ... I&#x27;m starting to get a little worried about the delicate skin under my eyes and the longevity of my eyelashes, what with all the rubbing and patting I&#x27;ve had to do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Alas, I&#x27;ll just have to go back to the regular Lineur Intense felt tip. Happily Amazon carries it, too.</li>
    <li> I loved this eyeliner for the first couple of weeks or so and then the tip started drying out and I only the middle part of the liner actually applied liquid. Now it is almost impossible to get a clean, accurate line. It also started irritating my contacts during and after application. That probably has more to do with my sensitive eyes than the product itself, but I still can&#x27;t use it.</li>
    <li> Lasts forever and makes it really easy to make a fine eyeline, not a big huge one</li>
    <li> I like that this is an easy transition between a regular pencil type eyeliner and liquid eyeliner, but it does take some practice. The felt tip applicator seems to work well. This particular eyeliner is a little too thin - it&#x27;s super slim, I guess I should have gotten a broader tip. It works well for under my eye, but takes a little longer to line my eye lid because of the thinness. It does allow for a lot of detail (i.e. the cat-like eye liner?). It stays on well during the day and doesn&#x27;t smudge too much which is great. It&#x27;s a little too dark for every day casual wear, but great for evening wear.</li>
    <li> This is the first liquid eyeliner I&#x27;ve ever used and it might just be the only one. It was a little hard to get the hang of it at first (I poked myself in the eye more times than I care to admit) but once I perfected it, it looks amazing. It&#x27;s easy to use the tip to make a thin line or lay it flat across the eye to make it thicker. The best thing about it is that IT DOES NOT BUDGE. I&#x27;ve gotten caught in the rain without it so much as running. I&#x27;ve sweat in hot weather without it smudging. I&#x27;ve even cried in it and it stayed put. In my opinion this is the perfect eyeliner.&lt;br /&gt;EDIT: I was putting this on this morning and remembered one downfall to this product. It&#x27;s lasting power is also it&#x27;s weakness. If you make a mistake, work fast to fix it and use some kind of remover because once it&#x27;s dry it&#x27;s a pain to get off. Still my favorite though!</li>
    <li> too thin and didn&#x27;t last very long!</li>
    <li> With a steady hand and some practice, you can draw an amazingly fine line with this eyeliner. The tip hasn&#x27;t gotten gummed up or dried out so far and the tip is still a fine point. When applied, it stays liquid just long enough to wipe off a mistake. By varying the pressure, you can make a thicker line too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It hasn&#x27;t smudged into dark circles except on the most humid, sweaty days. It did not irritate my sensitive eyes at all. It does require eye makeup remover - it will not come completely off with just soap and water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was impressed enough to want to buy it in a softer color - the black is a darker color than I typically use - it&#x27;s very, very black.</li>
    <li> This eyeliner has a very fine, pointy tip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be careful of getting too close to eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The last I wore liquid eyeliner was a brush with no pointed tip. This is great for very, very fine lines.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you like something thicker, obviously this wouldn&#x27;t work as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While applying just make sure to keep away from eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t wash off as easily as I would have liked it to.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this liner! As a person who has tried many liners throughout her makeup career, I can positively say this is amazing! The fine tip does wonders when you are aiming for a specific line and the liner itself is easy to use and handle. After using this for about a month then going back to liquid liner, I had to relearn to use liquid liner! The color stays for incredibly long, doesn&#x27;t smudge easily once it&#x27;s dry, and when they say black they mean BLACK. Not dark grey, not smoky black, but BLACK. I&#x27;ve had this eyeliner for two months, used it almost daily, and still have plenty left!</li>
    <li> This is a very nice, easy-to-use eyeliner. With a light touch, you get a slim line. For a more dramatic 1960&#x27;s look, use a heavier touch. It does dry quickly, which helps prevent smudges. It doesn&#x27;t last all day for me, as it&#x27;s summer and very hot, and my eyelids sweat when I&#x27;m outside. I also like that it is good for contact lens wearers. Recommended.</li>
    <li> Okay ... After waiting for 10 days finally got the product. I really liked that it has a thin tip .... I had always wanted a thin tip liner . And this was it .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But there is one problem ... its shiny ... Not the matte intense black line that I had expected/wanted . Tho I would purchase it again in near future because I can achieve the look that I want .... But the liner being shiny, at the same, kinda disappoints .</li>
    <li> This liner is very nice, clean and easy to apply. easy to take off too. A great buy for anyone</li>
    <li> I have so much trouble finding an eyeliner that doesn&#x27;t come off on my eyelids. This product isn&#x27;t perfect, but it is better than anything else I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t even count how many liquid liners I&#x27;ve tried over the years - I typically end up going back to my old standby liquid pot or cake liner.  Unfortunately this Infallible Black liquid liner is not going to convert me either, but it gets points for convenience, ease of use, and bold black color.  Getting a super slim line with this one was a challenge for me, although it was slimmer than many other liquid liners I&#x27;ve tried.  I found the brush tip to be a little too flexible for the precision needed to get a super slim line and have much more success with ultra thin liner when using a cake liner with an angled brush.  The black color was nice in this pen liner - I didn&#x27;t need to go over the same line multiple times to get a nice rich black color, one swipe was enough.  If you like to smudge your liner for a smokey look, this works well too.  Let it dry for a few seconds and take your smudge sponge and it blends all around your eyes nicely.  Unfortunately, it doesn&#x27;t really ever feel like it sets into place, so don&#x27;t touch your eyes after that because it will continue to smudge throughout the day. I wasn&#x27;t a fan of having the liquid in the pen behind the brush - if I felt the brush tip was too dry to achieve the look I was going for, I wasn&#x27;t sure how I could get the brush tip more moist.  I&#x27;d end up shaking it around, but I&#x27;m not sure that did anything.</li>
    <li> I never feel ready to step outside the house without eyeliner.  And so I have tried A LOT of liners.  I was eager to try this one as well.  It&#x27;s described as \\&quot;super thin\\&quot; which previously has been hard for me to achieve with a liquid product.  This is a thin felt tip encased into a pencil thick barrel, so I was hoping it would be hard to \\&quot;over do\\&quot; my eyes.  In that regard, L&#x27;Oreal has nailed it.  With this eyeliner its super easy to create dramatic eye looks. The tip is long, so application feels awkward, but the result is a controlled liquid line. It also does wear for hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, it also does flake/smudge some.  So be prepared to touch up your under eyes regularly, or embrace a smokier bottom lash line (even when liner is only applied to the top lid).</li>
    <li> My mom loves this stuff! It&#x27;s the only one she will use that doesn&#x27;t smudge, doesn&#x27;t crease, and doesn&#x27;t run. It stays all day on her and she is very thankful for that.</li>
    <li> Great stuff, will buy again</li>
    <li> It flows perfectly. I had a hard time controlling this, and it is not forgiving if you make a mistake. I applied too much  a tried to wipe the excess, but it dried instantaneously. Instead of wiping the extra off, I applied more to the other eye to even things out. In the end, I looked like Amy Winehouse! After several attempts to wash it off, I looked like Alice Cooper. I&#x27;ll probably never wear his again.  I&#x27;m sticking to Clinique&#x27;s Waterproof Eyeliner.</li>
    <li> Very similar in look and application to the artistry liner, which I like a lot - my only complaint is that later in the day, the liner on the corner of my eye smears or settles.</li>
    <li> OK.  Doesn&#x27;t flow well out of the container.</li>
    <li> This is not a product for beginner makeup application.  It can be very difficult to apply.  Other than that a great product, bold color, and long lasting!</li>
    <li> The only good thing about this - it&#x27;s easy to apply. However, 5min after you apply, you are risking to look like a panda. Ugh. I will stick with my Stila eyeliner</li>
    <li> This eyeliner was easy to use and I was able to get thin and precise lines, which was good for doing a cat eye look. The felt tip is stiff enough for precise lines while not so stiff that it scratches the skin and irritates it. I usually use gel liners with brushes or the pencil liners, and I cannot get thin and precise lines with those. The one downside was that this liner does not stay put on my eyelids for the entire day. However, no liners ever stay put on my eyelids, so I am not surprised.</li>
    <li> First of all, I love eyeliner.  To me it&#x27;s what wakes the eyes up, and provides that dramatic flair that really sets a person&#x27;s makeup.  But trying to find an eyeliner brand, for a good price, that last, and stays on was driving me insane.  I&#x27;ve tried oh-so-many different brands in hopes that there would be one that actually lasted.  I wear eyeliner every day, and after a few weeks the felt tips turn from a nice pointed line into a clump, and the actual liquid eyeliner goes from deep black to grey after a while leaving me looking like a raccoon versus the cat eye look I was going for.  And in enters the L&#x27;Oreal  Super Slim Eyeliner.  First glance I was sure this eyeliner wasn&#x27;t going to hold up.  It&#x27;s literally a long pen.  No bottle of liquid whatsoever.  And I don&#x27;t know about the rest of you, but I have tried eyeliners that required no liquid bottles, and every time I put my eyeliner on, I&#x27;d have to do it with the pen up in the air so the liquid could flow to the tip.  So you can imagine how untrusting I was of this eyeliner already.  Upon uncapping the eyeliner, I was so surprised to see how long the tip was!  It is no short little felt tip at all, but a nice, long very pointed tip!  I applied the eyeliner in my normal cat eye way, and let me tell you...I fell in love.  The eyeliner glides on so smoothly!  My line was very slender, perfect for the first stroke, and it was so easy to curve it up from the corner of my eye, and make a neat line back for my style!!!  In seconds I was done!!  No messy blobs that accidentally littered my face, or accidental sprays from dipping into a bottle!  Nothing but nice clean lines!  And my fear of upside down pens with no liner flow?  Totally gone!  I&#x27;ve used this every day since I got it, and have had no trouble putting this on with the pen in the upside down position!  It still goes on black as night, and what&#x27;s more is that this makeup STAYS on!!!  I have oily skin, but by the end of the day my eye shadow might be gone, but my eyeliner is still intact and just as black as ever!  I&#x27;ve actually had a lot of compliments on my eyes from various strangers, and people I know.  I&#x27;ve been recommending it to everyone!  And, last note, while the pointer is very thin, you can still go back over it easily and make the line thicker!  When going back over it, it also does not take off what you previously put on, and it dries as soon as it&#x27;s applied so no smudges!  I truly love this eyeliner, and it is my new fav!!my eyeliner is still intact and just as black as ever!

    <li> I cannot for the life of me apply eyeliner.  The only one I&#x27;ve ever been able to apply is the color in the little pot with the brush.  Since this is slim and the color goes on smoothly I had no trouble applying this.  Because it is liquid is it darker than a pencil.  I really do like it.</li>
    <li> I was overly optimistic that a slim liner that calls itself infallible - wouldn&#x27;t require alot (read that any) liquid liner expertise. I have typically stuck to the pencils which I find a little more forgiving.  But, wished for the longevity of a liquid liner.  Unfortunately, my initial attempts have found while I&#x27;m better at putting this one on than most liquid ones I&#x27;ve tried, the result is still not great and my errors are hard to get rid of without having to redo all my eye make-up. For those, that regularly use liquid liner and have at least semi-mastered it, I suspect it&#x27;s slim-lime design will in fact help you have even more perfectly lined eyes.</li>
    <li> I love felt-tip liquid liners and have tried many of them.  This liner has one of the best tips I&#x27;ve used, and without a doubt the best I&#x27;ve seen on a product in this price range.  The tip is very fine and seems to hold up well, a common problem with this type of liner is that the tip will fall apart and no longer produce a precise and consistent line.  It also flows very well, color comes out very intense and no issues with clogging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like most liquid liners of this type, it dries fast and is difficult to correct once it dries, so you have to work very quickly to correct any mistakes else things are going to get messy. Also you do not want to apply this type of liner on top of a primer or anything, it should be applied underneath anything else cause it is meant to bond to directly to skin.  This is the key to making these kind of liners not smudge!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I&#x27;d say this liner is almost as good as the much more expensive Lancome artliner which is my current favorite.  I do find that the artliner is slightly easier to apply and correct, but otherwise this is a very good liner especially considering the price.  I wish they would make this in more colors, I don&#x27;t typically wear black or brown but I would definitely buy this product again if they made it in blue or purple like lancome&#x27;s aubergine shade.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a couple weeks now, and I love it just as much as I did the first day. The long, fine tip gives me tons of control, and I can easily do both eyes with no issues of drying out. It also lasts great, and doesn&#x27;t run or flake like other brands. I&#x27;m hooked!!!</li>
    <li> It allows me to use thin eye liner as my lashes get thinner with my age.  A wide line would look gaudy and is sometimes the&lt;br /&gt;only way some eye liners seem to apply.</li>
    <li> Nice thin line, easy to control.  I don&#x27;t use eyeliner everyday but this is a good one.</li>
    <li> Loved it! I had tried so many eyeliners and this is just the best eyeliner I&#x27;ve bought! It&#x27;s perfect!</li>
    <li> I like thicker top eyeliner, and I can get it with this. I can also do very, very thin bottom eyeliner with it. It is great for however you want to wear your makeup... and it stays on all day, and does not smudge or create creases.</li>
    <li> This liner gives a precise line that is opaque so there is no need to go over the same line, which is the case with some eyeliners. It takes a quick flick of the hand to line the entire upper lash line and the control in this brush allows for you to create thin or thick lines depending on your preference. The tip is precise with a little flex at the end, which in my case has worked in my favour and allowed me to create great winged eyeliner which I could not achieve before. I can fix any mistakes I have made with a Q-tip and makeup remover and it comes right off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This eyeliner is not waterproof though, I can take it off easily using just water which makes the removal process easier. However, I live in a very hot and humid environment and I can wear it outside without it ever running on my eyelid or disappearing. I can rub my eyes and it will stay in place.</li>
    <li> i love this liquid eyeliner. easy to apply both thin and thick lines, easy to remove yet stays on all day. my favorite!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a big fan of L&#x27;Oreal, but I wasn&#x27;t impressed with this eyeliner.  The tube only lasted a couple of weeks before it started drying out, and even before that the coverage was sort of like trying to write with a pen that&#x27;s running out of ink.  I bought a second one, thinking maybe it was defective, but it was the same.  Then I tried L&#x27;Oreal Telescopic eyeliner, and I&#x27;m hooked.</li>
    <li> One of the best in contour liners</li>
    <li> This liner is better than a liquid, but better than a stick also! Somehow, this is like a thin-tipped pen for your eyes. I purchased a more expensive liquid liner from Sephora (Sephora brand) not too long ago. I spent about $15 on that liner. It was smudgy and always left a crease on my eyelid throughout the day! The L&#x27;Oreal Super Slim Liner dries extremely quickly, which helps to avoid that creasy mess! Also, it goes on very smooth. I cannot explain how much this solves my makeup problems! Whether you are looking to very thinly line your eyes, or are looking for more of a large swiped Amy Winehouse type of look, you MUST try this! A+++</li>
    <li> I could love this eyeliner.  It is by far one of the best that I have ever tried.  I am one of those people that can look like she has been crying in the summer if I have on low quality makeup.  This eyeliner prevents that.  It is great for thick or thin lines.  It is perfect for people who like to add a bit of fashion to their makeup with different lining techniques.  I would probably like it even if I were a makeup artist.  My only problem with it are the almost impossible correction.  It dries very fast and the consistency means that if you don&#x27;t move fast, you will have to use makeup remover.  I accidentally fell asleep in my makeup and the eyeliner lasted through it all.  It can even last through face washing, so makeup remover is a must.  You also need a steady hand or it can be hard to control the application.  Overall it is probably the best waterproof eyeliner that I have ever used, it just takes getting used to the application process.  I would recommend this to anyone.</li>
    <li> Yes, I&#x27;m in my 40&#x27;s and no, I&#x27;ve never worn eyeliner before. I got this because I go to a lot of 80&#x27;s style rock concerts and wanted to put the eyeliner on to complete the \\&quot;look\\&quot;. I tried the L&#x27;Oreal Super Slim Liner and for somebody that has never done this before I found it super simple and loved the look I achieved using this. It dried quickly and seems to last with no problems for me and I don&#x27;t have to do any touch ups. I&#x27;ll be sure to pick up more of this when this one runs out for my concert fun.</li>
    <li> After spending years looking for a good, reliable eye liner, I can safely say that I need to look no further. L&#x27;Oreal&#x27;s SUPER SLIM LINER does everything I need it to do and never disappoints. I didn&#x27;t want to post a review after I tried it for the very first time and decided instead to wait and see how the liner would act long term.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The best thing about this liner is that the line it makes is, indeed, very slim and it never smudges. Unlike other liners, this one does not require you to sit there waiting with your eye closed until the line dries and is safe from smudging. Drawing a beautiful, slim line has never been as easy. And it stays looking crisp and fresh even several hours after you applied your makeup.</li>
    <li> This is the best eyeliner I have ever used.  I ordered it with a subscription from amazon and it comes every couple of months so I don&#x27;t have to go to the store to buy it.</li>
    <li> Love this liner! So easy too use, stays put until I wash my face at night. This is a forever addition to my routine.</li>
    <li> This eye liner is perfect, goes on great,  easy to correct and clean up unevenness with a tissue. I can leave it on for days and just clean it up some in the morning and its good to go. I&#x27;ve been looking for 30 years for an eyeliner like this. I love it!!</li>
    <li> Great color. Easy to apply but comes off too easy.</li>
    <li> go on very nicely but smudges if you rub your eyes a lot (which I do often throughout the day).</li>
    <li> Do you like black under eyes that&#x27;s hard to remove.  Ummmmm......</li>
    <li> my daughter uses this while performing during football games. it goes on smoothly and as thick/thin as she wants it and it never runs. she never used liquid eyeliner before but is now a convert thanks to this product</li>
    <li> I fell in love with it is easy to use and very  beautiful</li>
    <li> Works like a charm! Here&#x27;s the trick: use it like you would a stamp and just lightly press it along your lash line instead of dragging it. So much easier to put on that way. Also, it makes the best cat eyes!</li>
    <li> The best eyeliner I have ever used! Makes the perfect thick/thin cat eye, and it will stay on all day! ❤️</li>
    <li> I love this. Helps me to get the straightest line without making a mess. I love how it is easy to work with.</li>
    <li> I like a natural look, and this liner provides a precise, thin enough line.  I do before eye shadow and have no smear.</li>
    <li> The line comes out excellent.</li>
    <li> This Liner Goes on nicely. Provides clean lines for a lasting look (helps if you have a steady hand, of course;).</li>
    <li> I like the applicator, but the formula always comes off on my upper lid.  I&#x27;ve tried to stop it with eyelid primer, eye-shadow, even waiting 10 minutes before I move my eyes, but the formula moves--even in the middle of the day.</li>
    <li> By far the best eyeliner I have ever had! The precision is amazing</li>
    <li> Works just like the commercial says it does.  I&#x27;ve bought two other brands and they don&#x27;t hold a candle to this L&#x27;Oreal.  Very smooth .</li>
    <li> This is a great product, you can truly make a fine line and have it look so natural.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never been able to do &#x27;wings&#x27; or the cat eye look. Goes on pretty smooth, takes a few seconds to dry. Wish they offered this in a waterproof though. Runs a bit with summertime sweat</li>
    <li> i&#x27;m picky with liquid eyeliners. i&#x27;ve used several and this is my go-to now. it does not smudge even with my little Asian eyes. I will buy more soon! great purchase</li>
    <li> This is the BEST liquid eye liner pen out there. I&#x27;ve tried Stila, NYX, and Maybelline, and I can say this is the best one out there. Doesn&#x27;t dry too quickly (like Stila), but stays put (looking at you, NYX), and is an actual liquid for those perfect cat eye flicks (Maybelline feels like it glides on as more of a waxy eyeliner).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BUY this if you want to look like a beautiful catty minx.</li>
    <li> It is one of the best eye liners i&#x27;ve tried! I love how it gives you the flexibility to draw the line just the way you want it, whether its thin or thick. The only flaw is that it does smudge a little, but to avoid that I always apply a bit of powder before applying it, it would make it last longer and smudge less. It is also easy to apply and great dark color.</li>
    <li> finally, an eyeliner you can trust! not too much, not too little. But just right! its easy to put on, and easy to come off. Need i say more&amp;#62;&amp;#62;?</li>
    <li> This is a great product at a good price. The applicator is great because of it&#x27;s very fine line.  The color was perfect.  When applying I didn&#x27;t have to keep going back over my line to make it darker or get it to adhere. Stayed on great all day.  Easy to remover as well. Really like this product !!</li>
    <li> I thought it would be better than other drugstore liquid liners because it is slightly more expensive. However, it performs just like my maybelline one and I find it slightly harder to apply since the applicator is longer and thinner.</li>
    <li> Sucks.  Slim line but not waterproof. In hot weather you have black eyes</li>
    <li> I just bought this because of the hype! I love the Super Slim tip applicator, but the staying power sucks! I am at home wearing my cat eye lines in an air conditioned house and part of my cat eye liner wing is smudged off. I can&#x27;t even imagine wearing this outside in this hot humid summer weather. I can try to seal it with my Makeup Forever Aqua seal to make it stay put all day. But this should never be labeled 12H liquid liner because its false advertisement.</li>
    <li> I have thoroughly enjoyed using this liner. I&#x27;m 68 years old and have been wearing eyeliner since I was sixteen. This provides a very thin line and is easy to control. You don&#x27;t need to dip the brush into liquid it just comes through in a steady line. I have an allergic reaction to some products but not this. Really enjoy using this and will certainly buy again.</li>
    <li> Great value for the price!</li>
    <li> Easy to apply. Stays put.</li>
    <li> seemed like it was a little old, not as moist as the ones I purchased from the store.  I had a hard time finding them so I looked here.</li>
    <li> I was surprised at how easy it was to use this Super Slim Eyeliner. Its bold, rich color goes on sharply and stays on until you take it off. With other products I&#x27;ve often had to apply the eyeliner to my lids several times to get the straight, deep black line I was looking for. Not so with this eyeliner. It is fairly simple to get a thick to thin line or vice-versa depending on what look you are going for. I would purchase again.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing in how clean and clear it works. Recently I was looking for a new product to replace my old mascara and I was giving a few ones a try based upon what the features they offered and current user feedback so I came upon this product and decided to make a purchase. When it arrived I was not fully sure what to expect of the full product I was hoping for something good and nice which I was not disappointed in the least. It is very precise one of the most precise products I have ever used which really impresses me because I can put the exact amount that I need with no fuss. It also dries really quickly which is unexpected I am beyond satisfied with this product and I honestly to everyone out there say if you want a new mascara product this is your choice right now! I also recommended those [[ASIN:B00QDUX1UC False Eyelashes - 70 Pairs in 7 Different Styles Allows You to Select Your Look From Natural to Dramatic! + FREE Bonuses]] with this eyeliner.  Both of them are a truly gripping awesome products and worth every penny.</li>
    <li> This eyeliner is really great. Thin applier, the lasting is great too. The only thing i would change its that could be waterproof.</li>
    <li> I will buy this product over and over. Very precise tip, easy for winged eyeliner. Also this product last me almost a year. Amazing! And would recommend!</li>
    <li> Really pleased with this product and easy to apply</li>
    <li> The packaging of the product is adorable and sleek, the applicator is the best ive used, but the quality of the liquid liner makes me want to cry... I even layer a matte black eyeshadow over the liner to secure it and within minutes im washing off my makeup and starting over.</li>
    <li> This is excelent eyeliner as described by my friend. This is very slim and easy applicable, don&#x27;t lick and don&#x27;t glossed over.&lt;br /&gt;The price is perfect too.</li>
    <li> The lines are slim and precise. You are only limited by the stillness of your hand.</li>
    <li> I have officially found my new favorite liner. The tip is the finest, most precise tip, and it allows you to paint the perfect line. I really haven&#x27;t used a more perfect liner. I plan to buy another tube in brown.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t usually wear liner, but I always do for special occasions, which means it has to last. This really did last for the full time of the wedding and still came off easily with a make-up wipe. I was really pleased with the product all around!</li>
    <li> It is the perfect addition to my makeup bags!! The tip never frays and goes the precision needed in a liner!!</li>
    <li> If my brush slips it is hard to erase the error with a cue tip, as I had been doing with another product.</li>
    <li> My wife doesn&#x27;t wear eyeliner very often but she really liked this one. It went on with a very thin line (but she was able to make it wider without too much difficulty by going back over it a few times). She wore it for a full day of work and post-work drinks and it didn&#x27;t run so she&#x27;s pretty happy with it. Getting it off was also very easy (normal makeup remover).</li>
    <li> This liner just ok to me.  Doesn&#x27;t glide smooth enough. I want a smoother softer application.  Giving to my 20 year old</li>
    <li> Not what I expected.  do not like</li>
    <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;-Great solid black color&lt;br /&gt;-Tip is pointy enough to allow nice, fine lines&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;-Starts to smear/melt off after 2-3 hours on oily skin (I was quite disappointed, since 2 other Loreal liners had good staying power)&lt;br /&gt;-Tip is a little more solid (like the tip of a marker, but softer) than a typical brush liner, so it doesn&#x27;t glide over the skin as smoothly.  If you&#x27;re not careful, it can get stuck mid-motion.</li>
    <li> Lo recomiendo mucho, me hago la l&amp;iacute;nea superior con mucha facilidad.</li>
    <li> This is so easy to use and goes on so smoothly.</li>
    <li> This is awesome! It is so easy to put on and I love how thin I can get lines. Worth the money for me!</li>
    <li> Easy to get close to my lash line and stays put.  One can draw a thin line or a thick line.</li>
    <li> Love it.  I&#x27;m a little bit older now and its hard for me to put on an eyeliner, so when I received this eyeliner I tried it out right away and I won&#x27;t be buying or using any other eyeliner. Goes on easy, smooth and it doesn&#x27;t smear</li>
    <li> I love this eyeliner pen. I have never been able to achieve a cat eye so easily before. It is a very black black, that stays black throughout the day and does not smudge or run. I will buy this again!</li>
    <li> I saw the advert for this and since I already use the L&#x27;Oreal Stiletto Eye Liner that can sometimes be too thick I decided to give it a shot.&lt;br /&gt;My initial impression was very positive. The casing has a high-end look and feel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The tip is super thin and more rigid than a lot of other felt-tip liners but still has a little \\&quot;give\\&quot; during application. The line comes out incredibly thin and is very precise with a deep pigmentation. My first time wearing it was a gamble of sorts since the day was incredibly humid and a lot of eyeliners tend to \\&quot;run\\&quot; on my eyelids. Perhaps mine are more prone to sweating or becoming oily than others but anyway, thats the case. Fortunately the liner stuck out the day without issues (quite an achievement)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only negative comment is that its very difficult to correct. I tried to even out the line with a wet Q-tip and had to put in decent amount of effort.&lt;br /&gt;I then had to go back and fill in areas that had faded because of the amount of \\&quot;correcting\\&quot; I had done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll just be more careful with my lines in the future since overall I&#x27;m satisfied with the product.</li>
    <li> This eyeliner is amazing. use it everyday and it makes the perfect cat eye! Love it! absolutely love it! Only eye liner I will ever use again!</li>
    <li> Was sceptical but delightfully surprised I am used to MAC fluidline gel liner but money was tight so I thought I&#x27;d try this, I actually like the precision and simplicity of application better than my MAC gel liner and I do heavy cat eye and I only had lil smudges at outter corners of my eye at the end of the day</li>
    <li> Very good liquid eyeliner pen!</li>
    <li> LOVE IT!!! bethany mota uses this too ;)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not the best at applying eyeliner but I&#x27;ve experimented with a few products, so I know what I&#x27;m good at. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this to fellow beginners. The tip is dry, so I find myself having angle it awkwardly and making use of the side of the top just so that I can get a smooth line to appear. On top of that, it will smudge throughout the day. I, personally, don&#x27;t mind a little bit of smudging, but sometimes it can get messy if you prefer those sharp, clear wings. I will admit that the color is nice and dark, and my eyes look much nicer after the initial application. Bottom line: I don&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this eyeliner! I generally stick to liquids and prefer pens/markers. I have found this to be one of the more reliable ones I have tried. I like that it is a finer tipped pen so I can do more precise lines. Perfect for cat eyes! Stays put all day and removes fairy easily.</li>
    <li> Horrible! Dried up within days!</li>
    <li> I bought this eyeliner and LOVE it! It is easy to line your eyes either with a thin line or color in a bit more for a thick one. Lasts all day.</li>
    <li> The application is pretty easy and looks amazing,but it desnt last for long,after an hour or two it kind of smear all over,and look pretty bad..</li>
    <li> Love this eyeliner, so easy to use and it&#x27;s actually very black unlike others that go on kind of gray is. Definitely recommend !</li>
    <li> A friend of mine found and started using this eyeliner and mentioned/recommended it to me. I was really impressed with it. The tip of the liner is very thin, like other reviews have mentioned. Mine started out a little too stiff, but over the next couple weeks has softened nicely - now its like having a fine pointed paint brush to apply liner. I didn&#x27;t expect that to happen, but I love that that happened. The liner itself goes on smooth and pitch black. Like other reviews have mentioned, if you make an error you need to fix it immediately because it dries just about instantly. That said, once dry it lasts and lasts easily 12 hours for me. I haven&#x27;t tried to cry through it, and it can be smudged if I really rub across my eye lid, but other than that it really stays on and doesn&#x27;t fade, smudg or run for me.</li>
    <li> This eyeliner goes on very smooth and lasts all day.</li>
    <li> I have hooded eyes so regular eye liners do not work for me.  They just smear in to the crease.  I exclusively use this marker liquid eye liners.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First time trying this brand and it&#x27;s my new favourite.  Easy to apply.  Goes on smooth.  And if incredibly precise with the fine point.  Love it!</li>
    <li> Been using it for a while and like how easy it is to apply and does not flake.</li>
    <li> Excellent product for lining eyes both top and bottom in one quick stroke.  The line is thin and dark and stays put all day.</li>
    <li> Perfect wife is happy</li>
    <li> One of the easiest eyeliners to apply. The color is not too intense, but still great.</li>
    <li> This liner is the best I have used till date!! Easy to use, stays for long and price is great for what it delivers...</li>
    <li> This is so easy to apply! I love it! I don&#x27;t have to repeat the lines, just one application is all it takes unless I want to reshape the ends. I would definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> Not infallible.  I&#x27;ll stick to pencil eyeliners as this brand was not waterproof and when I went into the ladies room I could see that it had run down my face.  Embarrassing to say the least - Nice try but I&#x27;ll continue to use either Rimmel Exagerrate Waterproof eye pencil or Avon Glimersticks which is also a very good product and very reasonably priced.</li>
    <li> Great product.  Very happy!</li>
    <li> Long lasting, super precise and easy to apply. Highly recomended :)</li>
    <li> Great eyeliner!  Goes on smooth, dries fast, nice lines, and easy to control.  I&#x27;m hooked.</li>
    <li> Love, love, love this eyeliner...so easy to apply!</li>
    <li> Very good! Thank you!</li>
    <li> Really nice eyeliner! It takes a bit too long to dry for my liking but it definitely doesn&#x27;t disappear or smudge away even when wearing it for a long time or when sweating. So much easier to use than a liquid eyeliner brush!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very disappointed. It smudged/ transferred within a few minutes. The applicator is nice and precise but what&#x27;s the point when the formula does not even last 5 min! It actually started to feel tacky on my eyelids. Horrible. Horrible.</li>
    <li> Handles great.  Beautiful lines, clean, consistent.</li>
    <li> I love this product: it&#x27;s one of the best eyeliners I&#x27;ve ever used. It&#x27;s very easy to apply and I love that it&#x27;s a matte color. That being said, considering the price, it only lasts a couple of weeks (if you use it daily) before it starts drying up and you can&#x27;t use it anymore. Besides that, the formula is not even time proof, not to mention water proof. If I put it on in the morning, after 12 hours it&#x27;s already cracking or despairing (especially if you get smiling lines). I switched to their gel liner. Harder to apply, but it lasts all day and one little jar will last me for months and months. But I still can&#x27;t get the line as thin and perfect as with this product. They really need to improve it so I can by it again.</li>
    <li> Critical to understanding my experience is understanding that I suck at putting on makeup. I had really given up eyeliner other than idiotically smearing a pencil around for that &amp;#34;smokey&amp;#34; look. But this liner is idiot-proof. Just start with a thin line or dashes around your lashes and build out from there if you like.&lt;br /&gt;Also for anyone like me with really pale skin, you can&#x27;t beat this for a black eyeliner. You can easily avoid that whole I&#x27;m-a-goth-barfly look that happens with thicker liners.</li>
    <li> The color is great , very dark, but the point is too hard to touch with skin.it is little hard to make a perfect line</li>
