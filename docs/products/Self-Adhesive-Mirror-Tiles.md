### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>I wasn&#x27;t very happy with these.</li>
      <li>Let me tell u the best thing ever.</li>
      <li>The lady in the picture has perfect clarity and that&#x27;s not what these are at all.</li>
      <li>More like aluminum foil!!!</li>
      <li>The item is great</li>
      <li>, well I placed them in a form of a checker board, lol.  </li>
      <li>the mirror tile doesn t leave the finger marks, lol.  </li>
      <li>finish is shiny, but not usable as any kind of mirror, and are so flimsy, they need to be mounted on a glass or ceramic surface - defeating the purpose of being a tile.</li>
      <li>These are very light weight, sort of like stickers.</li>
      <li>The tiles are cheap cardboard and will not survive in any kind of environment.</li>
      <li>That looked much better, but, still like tin foil.</li>
      <li>Well, because it is not as many tiles as I wanted, I decided to place each mirror tile one tile apart.</li>
      <li>A 3x better lighting was seen and have had them in place for a couple months and no signs of wear of damage.      </li>
      <li>I thought they would be more reflective.</li>
      <li>They&#x27;ll work fine for my craft project.</li>
      <li>Great and simple.</li>
      <li>Hey, use it to be creative anywhere but only on tile walls for easy removal.</li>
      <li>They look pretty cool once you get them up.</li>
      <li>The surface you lay the mirror stickers on is the surface that shows through the tile, textured and like a fun house mirror.</li>
      <li>Be creative in anything you do with any product, I definitely recommend it!</li>
      <li>I have where the frames are too large.</li>
      <li>On my main bathroom tile wall is a beautiful islandy mural, and I placed the mirror tiles on the wall that when taking a shower it would be behind you.  </li>
      <li>The mirror tiles are not as sharp and clear as a regular mirror but you can view yourself like any mirror that is not fogged up by the hot, steamy shower that you have taken, lol.</li>
      <li>very flimsy material......will not recommend</li>
      <li>They&#x27;re really flimsy though, like adhesive tinfoil.</li>
      <li>Very disapointed in the quality.</li>
      <li>The reflective surface will bounce light around the room, making it appear bigger and brighter.</li>
      <li>They are pieces of silver colored peal and stick paper that don&#x27;t have much of a reflective quality at all.  </li>
      <li>Well, another difference while in a hot, steamy shower I can rub my fingers on one mirror tile for a quick view of my face, and when it dries, the steam has been aired out completely,</li>
      <li>Like other reviewers have said, it&#x27;s more like aluminum foil.</li>
      <li>And since its over two hundred dollars for new ones, I gasve these a try.    </li>
      <li>I bought four packs of these, hoping that even if they weren&#x27;t mirror-like I could still get some use out of them above my cabinets for extra light in the house.</li>
      <li>Got the sheets, and filled the inside housing with these little mirrors.     </li>
      <li>They are reflective, but not like a clear glass mirror.</li>
      <li>Old House\\&quot; magazine on page 107:&lt;br</li>
      <li>As soon as I received my package, I opened it, took the \\&quot;mirrors\\&quot; out of the bag, put them right back in, and sent the package back.</li>
      <li>New bulbs helped a little, but still didn&#x27;t provide adequate lighting.</li>
      <li>I even went as far as trying to leave the sticker backing on the tile to prevent the textures from coming through and simply gluing the tile to the wall.</li>
      <li>It appears that I don&#x27;t have near enough either.</li>
      <li>I thought it was actually glass, but it&#x27;s clear paper that looks like glass with a stick on back.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> these are not really like the picture just shiny. They look like a funhoues mirror with all different shapes</li>
    <li> These are referenced in the October 2009 \\&quot;This Old House\\&quot; magazine on page 107:&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;Affix mirrored tiles to the soffit above kitchen cabinets. The reflective surface will bounce light around the room, making it appear bigger and brighter. Twenty 4-by-4-inch peel-and-stick tiles, $10; amazon.com\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;Excellent idea!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had to look up \\&quot;soffit\\&quot; on Wikipedia:&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;the underside of a ceiling to fill the space above the kitchen cabinets, at the corner of the ceiling and wall.\\&quot;</li>
    <li> If you want a mirror, get a mirror. This is not even close to the toy mirrors you can get at the dollar store. Like other reviewers have said, it&#x27;s more like aluminum foil. As soon as I received my package, I opened it, took the \\&quot;mirrors\\&quot; out of the bag, put them right back in, and sent the package back.</li>
    <li> I bought four packs of these, hoping that even if they weren&#x27;t mirror-like I could still get some use out of them above my cabinets for extra light in the house. It looked like I spread tin foil on my wall. The surface you lay the mirror stickers on is the surface that shows through the tile, textured and like a fun house mirror. I even went as far as trying to leave the sticker backing on the tile to prevent the textures from coming through and simply gluing the tile to the wall. That looked much better, but, still like tin foil. What I ended up doing, not to waste my money, was using them as a backing for pictures I have where the frames are too large. Do not waster your money, The only thing I would buy these for if I would buy these again would be arts and crafts for my daughter in girl scouts.</li>
    <li> These are very light weight, sort of like stickers. They&#x27;ll work fine for my craft project. The reflection is vague, not clear.</li>
    <li> Did my shower over n bought these. Let me tell u the best thing ever. My son Shaves his face in the shower now, so that means less cleaning in the bathroom I have to do, my daughters do there hair wit the crap they put on there hair like Gel n stuff n they do it in the shower.. Single moms out there that don&#x27;t want to be in the house cleaning all the time get this 4 ur Shower...  Staten Island N.Y.</li>
    <li> The headlight housing in my thunderbird was no longer reflective. Mu headlights were very poor.     New bulbs helped a little, but still didn&#x27;t provide adequate lighting. And since its over two hundred dollars for new ones, I gasve these a try.    Got the sheets, and filled the inside housing with these little mirrors.     A 3x better lighting was seen and have had them in place for a couple months and no signs of wear of damage.      Also put one on the back of hte bathroom door. Great and simple.</li>
    <li> I bought this product so that I can have a mirror like design in my bathroom.  On my main bathroom tile wall is a beautiful islandy mural, and I placed the mirror tiles on the wall that when taking a shower it would be behind you.  Well, because it is not as many tiles as I wanted, I decided to place each mirror tile one tile apart. As in the pic, you can see the lady places the mirror tiles together side by side, well I placed them in a form of a checker board, lol.  That way it can seem as if the mirror tiles support the view of your body from face to legs.  The mirror tiles are not as sharp and clear as a regular mirror but you can view yourself like any mirror that is not fogged up by the hot, steamy shower that you have taken, lol. Well, another difference while in a hot, steamy shower I can rub my fingers on one mirror tile for a quick view of my face, and when it dries, the steam has been aired out completely, the mirror tile doesn t leave the finger marks, lol.  Hey, use it to be creative anywhere but only on tile walls for easy removal. Be creative in anything you do with any product, I definitely recommend it!</li>
    <li> I thought they would be more reflective. Closer to a mirror. They were not. More like aluminum foil!!! Don&#x27;t let the photo fool you !</li>
    <li> These are verry flimsy. It is just a sticky chrome cellophane. It looks nothing like a mirror when you put it up on a painted surface you can see the bit of texture underneath.</li>
    <li> They look pretty cool once you get them up. They&#x27;re really flimsy though, like adhesive tinfoil. Not as reflective as the picture. a bit overpriced.</li>
    <li> This picture makes them look like they are like a mirror.  They are NOT, AT ALL!  The reflection is terrible!</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t very happy with these. I knew they were a fairly thin, stick on material wen I ordered them, but I expected them to be a little more stiff and thick than they were. They went on like a sticker and looked like tin foil. I will use what&#x27;s left for craft projects, but they are nothing I would put on my walls. The price is triple what I would pay if I realized what they would be like.</li>
    <li> they were not as you see here. you cant see yourself. They are shiny stiskers. Very disapointed in the quality.</li>
    <li> The picture of the product listed is inaccurate, these are not &amp;#34;Mirrored Tiles&amp;#34;.  They are pieces of silver colored peal and stick paper that don&#x27;t have much of a reflective quality at all.  They have a hazy appearance, and not worthy of being called a &amp;#34;Mirror&amp;#34;.  When I think of Mirrored Tiles, I think of squares of a mirror with glass.</li>
    <li> If it was an option I would give this product zero stars. I was not impressed at all with these &#x27;mirror&#x27; tiles.! They were basically like looking in a funhouse mirror, and they were paper thin. I was going to pu them up in my school locker but as soon I opened the package i kew they were a crappy product and a TOTAL waste of money!! I certainly do not recommend this product whatsoever!!</li>
    <li> this product worked somewhat for what I wanted it for, but it was not what I expected.  I thought it was actually glass, but it&#x27;s clear paper that looks like glass with a stick on back.  very flimsy material......will not recommend</li>
    <li> The tiles are cheap cardboard and will not survive in any kind of environment. I would  not recommend to anyone.</li>
    <li> Delivered as promised.  The item is great</li>
    <li> No where in the ad to purchase does it say the tiles are not real mirror.  Its a mirror like film and you can not see your self&lt;br /&gt;clearly enough to put on make up.  I purchased them to put on the back of a medicine cabinet to put on make-up close up, and it is not the solution.  It would be a hassle to return as I am donating them to my kid&#x27;s classroom for a craft project.</li>
    <li> Too flimsy, does not appear miror-like.</li>
    <li> Seems too flimsy to use where I wanted it because of the heat over the stove. It appears that I don&#x27;t have near enough either.</li>
    <li> not a mirror&lt;br /&gt;reflective paper that makes you have a headache trying to visualize what is in it&lt;br /&gt;paper came scratched&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;was not what I ordered</li>
    <li> ...wish I would have!!!  Everyone agrees....THIS PRODUCT IS MISREPRESENTED in the image!!  Oh, and don&#x27;t bother to attempt return with that complaint.&lt;br /&gt;(I agree....go with the roll of kitchen foil.)</li>
    <li> These are not adhesive mirror tiles. They are reflective, but not like a clear glass mirror. They are paper thin, and the reflection is like a funhouse wavy reflection. The lady in the picture has perfect clarity and that&#x27;s not what these are at all.</li>
    <li> They are not real mirrors and I will not be using them.  They look like small squares of aluminum foil.</li>
    <li> These things are not a clear mirror, as the description picture suggests, and they are not tiles - a tile a hard object, not a piece of plastic foil, that these items are.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The finish is shiny, but not usable as any kind of mirror, and are so flimsy, they need to be mounted on a glass or ceramic surface - defeating the purpose of being a tile. I buy a lot from Amazon, some of which I return, but these are by far the worst and most misrepresented items I have purchased to date.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking for a flimsy but sticky piece of plastic silver foil, these will suit your purpose, but if you bought mirror tiles because you wanted mirror tiles you will be unhappy.</li>
