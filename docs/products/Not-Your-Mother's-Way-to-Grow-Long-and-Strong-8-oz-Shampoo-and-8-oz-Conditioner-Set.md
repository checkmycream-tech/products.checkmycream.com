    <li> This product seriously dries out your hair. Terrible product, I threw it away after one use, made my hair feel like hay.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using these for a month and I have frizzy collarbone lengthed hair and my hair did not grow at all and my hair has been already healthy. I would recommend the NYM beach babe since it has coconut oil which can control frizz and make your hair strong and feel light. if you have dyed hair, just do not use the sea salt beach waves sprary.</li>
    <li> I have naturally curly hair and it didn&#x27;t like this product. Smells great but ended up with a fur ball</li>

    <li> This stuff made my hair grow like crazy! Would recommend for ball hair types, I was worried it wouldn&#x27;t work for menbecaus i have African american hair but it still worked</li>
    <li> It really wasn&#x27;t I thought it would be, in that it&#x27;s doesn&#x27;t help to grow your hair, it claims to help the hair you already have become stronger. I didn&#x27;t like how it made my hair feel after I shampooed it and the conditioner wasn&#x27;t the best detangler that I&#x27;ve ever used.  Will not finish it.</li>

    <li> Fantastic!!! Love it!!!</li>
    <li> Really didn&#x27;t do anything for me except make my hair extra dry. Unfortunately, this product was a waste of money.</li>
    <li> It was exactly how it was described.</li>
    <li> The only reason it gets one star is because I can&#x27;t give it less. I didn&#x27;t buy this on Amazon, but you all should know what it did anyways. It dried out my hair, gave me INTENSE split ends, and inhibited hair growth. It did that to my friends who said I was just over reacting too. This stuff is HORRIBLE.</li>
