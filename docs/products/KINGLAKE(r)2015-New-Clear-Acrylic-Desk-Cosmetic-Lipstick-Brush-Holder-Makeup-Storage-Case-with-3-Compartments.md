      <li>Exactly what you think you&#x27;re getting</li>
      <li>the size and looks are exactly what i was expecting based off of the picture.</li>
      <li>The small compartment in the front is good for applicator sponges.</li>
      <li>my lip pencils/brushes in the larger portion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can use it however you like, of course, but the fact is, it far outshines all the holders on my table, better than my Bed, Bath and Beyond ones, my Nordstrom Rack ones, Target ones, you name it.</li>
      <li>A little on the small side, but the smaller cup is perfect for eyeshadow/liner brushes.</li>
      <li>I can only fit 7 or 8 of my larger face brushes into the larger cup, but I have a LOT of brushes.</li>

<li> The interior dimensions of the individual cubbies from tallest to shortest are 1.6&amp;#34; by 3&amp;#34; (almost oval), 1.75&amp;#34; diameter (round), and 3.75&amp;#34; by 1.5&amp;#34; (rectangular).</li>
<li> Highest quality cosmetics holder I&#x27;ve ever purchased, hands down.</li>
<li> Purchased with the hopes of using it for makeup brushes...too small</li>
<li> It&#x27;s got a pretty small base for everything it holds.</li>
<li> Very disappointing.</li>
<li> /&gt;Measurements are 5&amp;#34; by 4&amp;#34; base, 4.5&amp;#34; height.</li>

    <li> Love this for my makeup brushes!</li>
    <li> It was a gift to somebody and she love it</li>

    <li> I use it as a pen holder on my desk</li>
    <li> Perfect to hold my makeup brushes even though it is actually a pen holder.</li>
    <li> Purchased with the hopes of using it for makeup brushes...too small but I&#x27;ll use it in my home office</li>
    <li> I got this for make up brushes and pencils and it is just right for me. It&#x27;s got a pretty small base for everything it holds. I can fit 5-6 large brushes in the tallest cubby with room for smaller ones, I keep 10-12 pencils or small brushes in the round cubby, and the shortest cubby fits my stubby travel brushes and false eyelash glue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Measurements are 5&amp;#34; by 4&amp;#34; base, 4.5&amp;#34; height.

    <li> Highest quality cosmetics holder I&#x27;ve ever purchased, hands down. Picture does it injustice, actually. The acrylic is thicker, more clear and with softer edges than the photo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, my MAC Fix Plus bottle fits PERFECTLY into the round holder, I keep my beauty blenders in the front and my lip pencils/brushes in the larger portion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can use it however you like, of course, but the fact is, it far outshines all the holders on my table, better than my Bed, Bath and Beyond ones, my Nordstrom Rack ones, Target ones, you name it.

    <li> This organizer is amazing! I love it so much, it fits all of my brushes.</li>
    <li> This is exactly as pictured. Works perfectly for all of my make-up brushes.</li>
    <li> I loved it&lt;br /&gt;And it holds a lot more than you&#x27;d think</li>
    <li> Perfect! It fits over 20 brushes depending of the size! I have 2 kabuki sets and the both fit confortable in it! A must have!</li>
    <li> I WISH THIS WORKED on my bathroom vanity!! I really do love it, but it just doesn&#x27;t fit on the layout of the counter around my sink. Very disappointing. But if you have the right space for it, you will love it. It IS a bit smaller than you might think -- just FYI.</li>
    <li> Wish it was cheaper, but happy to have it</li>
    <li> Exactly what you think you&#x27;re getting and it works great. I use it when I&#x27;m working as a makeup artist. It holds well and was a lot thicker and sturdier than I even thought. That is great because when you drop a brush or product into a compartment it doesn&#x27;t wiggle. It stays firm and solid. Great buy and great price.</li>
