      <li>This brush is great.</li>
      <li>I am very happy with this brush and am now purchasing two more - one for my mom and one for me.  </li>
      <li>Still the best I&#x27;ve found so far for my hair, even if not as perfect as before.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I find that I don&#x27;t want to stop brushing my hair because it feels so good.  </li>

      <li>Nice brush.  </li>
      <li>and it doesn&#x27;t rip my hair out which is nice.</li>

      <li>but it slid through really nicely.</li>
      <li>If you don&#x27;t own or haven&#x27;t used a boar bristle brush, you won&#x27;t find a quality brush as inexpensive as this.</li>
      <li>Couldn&#x27;t be more pleased!</li>
      <li>Plus it keeps your hair nice and healthy.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a large brush, so not one that you would carry in your purse, but it&#x27;s great for home.</li>

      <li>This brush has met all of my expectations and more.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s okay.  </li>

      <li>Fantastic!  </li>
      <li>I purchased this product as the boar hairs are humanely shaven from farm cattle, and I&#x27;m extremely satisfied with the product results.</li>
      <li>They make my daughter&#x27;s hair shiny and smooth, and I use them occasionally on my own hair after using a stronger brush to get the tangles out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>I love this brush.</li>
      <li>My head feels wonderfully stimulated after brushing and my coarse hair shines.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m sooooo glad I didn&#x27;t spend $50-$100 on a brush.</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t feel that it distributed the oils in my hair to make it look more healthy.</li>
      <li>so I have more oil buildup.</li>
      <li>I love to brush my hair...</li>
      <li>I love this brush.</li>
      <li>This is a fantastic hairbrush!  </li>
      <li>and I LOVE it.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;ll be even better after i&#x27;ve done my hair and let it be for a day</li>
      <li>I still get a lot of static electricity though.</li>
      <li>Great value for the money and highly recommended.</li>
      <li>i loved it from the first day I got it.</li>
      <li>Feels so good to be able to give it a really thorough brushing again(have</li>
      <li>Although, its not advertised as a pneumatic brush it does have nylon bristles in the center of the boar and it feels wonderful on my scalp.</li>
      <li>This brush is a quality item to treasure and enjoy for many years.      </li>
      <li>I have fine hair, so it took awhile to get use to it.  </li>
      <li>The product was just fine.  </li>
      <li>Worth the cost, and you&#x27;ll spend much more $ if you try and find a boar bristle brush like this is a beauty store.</li>
      <li>It makes my hair soooo smooth.</li>
      <li>So, so far so good.</li>
      <li>Only thing I&#x27;ve noticed so fair is it does create some static but</li>
      <li>Just received my Ambassador brush and I&#x27;ve been enjoying it; I&#x27;ve never wanted to brush so much before!</li>
      <li>I was looking for an all-natural brush, so this was a significant omission.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve only had it for a couple of weeks, but so far, it&#x27;s perfect.</li>
      <li>This hairbrush is a step up from the $5 boar bristles at my local beauty supply, but it&#x27;s not the good quality I had hoped for.</li>
      <li>Nice combination of natural and nylon bristles.  </li>
      <li>It is high quality, and I LOVE the look and feel of the oak handle.</li>
      <li>The wood has a nice shape and color and a solid feel.  </li>
      <li>Well worth the cost...</li>
      <li>so it&#x27;s stiff but it will break in nicely and become more forgiving to your hair and scalp.</li>
      <li>I just got this brush but so far I&#x27;m pretty satisfied with it.</li>
      <li>The fact that this one uses a combination of boars bristles and nylon bristles means that it goes through my hair easily and leaves my long straight hair very smooth.  </li>
      <li>The boars head really smooths out my hair and makes it super shiny.</li>
      <li>Same great brush, same result.  </li>
      <li>She has very straight hair.  </li>
      <li>and it pulls on hair (I have very straight hair)</li>
      <li>This is an extremely average brush, so don&#x27;t expect anything exceptional from this product.</li>
      <li>I have really wanted a good boar bristle brush that would easily get through my thick hair.  </li>
      <li>I just received this item and the first time I pulled it through my hair</li>
      <li>My hair looked and felt  softer, shinier and thicker after the first use.  </li>
      <li>but it seems pretty sturdy to me.</li>
      <li>This is my first boars head brush</li>
      <li>I was suspicious about this when I first read the descriptions but</li>
      <li>really does the trick!</li>
      <li>My hair breaks easily, and most brushes I&#x27;ve tried are stiff and tend to tear my hair.</li>
      <li>It brushes my long hair without pulling it out and leaves it very smooth and shiny.</li>
      <li>A good solid handle, the bristles are plastic mixed with boar bristles.  </li>
      <li>I think this is the most I&#x27;ve ever spent on a hair brush, and it&#x27;s worth every penny.  </li>
      <li>My hair isn&#x27;t long, but it is fairly thick and wavy, and I do feel that this brush does an excellent job.  </li>
      <li>Feels great on the scalp and if you flip your head over and brush from the back down</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a good price for a long lasting brush and the service was fast.</li>
      <li>When I saw the product itself, the black bristles are incredibly stiff, shiny and each are perfectly tube shaped.  </li>
      <li>It goes through alllllll of my hair without a problem and without tugging (though I have a pretty high pain tolerance, so</li>
      <li>Also, the bristles on this brush are scratchy, so it&#x27;s not as gentle on my scalp as I had hoped.    </li>
      <li>Highly recommend!</li>
      <li>I really like this brush.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I don&#x27;t know how long I&#x27;ve had mine, but well over 15 years.  Once I found this brush, I stopped looking for any others.  The combination of the plastic and boar bristles makes for the perfect power and polish brush stroke.  The durability speaks for itself.  I purchased the same model for my 9 year old son, to stop him from tromping into my room to use mine. Same great brush, same result.  All other brushes are inferior.</li>
    <li> I love this brush. It makes my hair soooo smooth. It&#x27;s a large brush, so not one that you would carry in your purse, but it&#x27;s great for home. Worth the cost, and you&#x27;ll spend much more $ if you try and find a boar bristle brush like this is a beauty store.</li>
    <li> Had this brush for a few months now and I LOVE it. I have wavy shoulder-length hair that seems to frizz more than lay flat, so I was skeptical about how silky my hair would be using this type of bristle. Well, it works beautifully--doesn&#x27;t break my hair, evenly distributes natual oils, feels like a scalp massage every time I use it. It does have some nylon bristles as well as boars hair - an attibute missing from the description - but I think that makes it go through my hair easier and prevents tangling. Well worth the cost...I&#x27;m sooooo glad I didn&#x27;t spend $50-$100 on a brush. I thought you would have to spend that much to get quality, but I was wrong. This brush is GREAT! Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> A good solid handle, the bristles are plastic mixed with boar bristles.  My hair is fine, but lots of it and long, and using this brush takes a lot more time than my usual brush.  Would probably be just right for short hair.</li>
    <li> I have thick caucasian hair and this brush eases through it without breaking strands. I recommend it!</li>
    <li> I have small hands and long thick hair.  This brush fits the small hands and handles the thick hair.  Really good quality, nice looking product which comes already in a box and would make a great gift.  Like to dip the bristles in essential oil as recommended for extra sheen and fragrance while grooming.</li>
    <li> I love this brush. I have gone low poo recently and it works great for distributing natural hair oils (sebum) from my roots to the dry ends of my hair. When I use this brush at night before I go to bed I realize that in the morning my hair noticeably less greasy! I am amazed! Also, I love that they mixed the nylon bristles in to massage my scalp and make the brush penetrate the hair instead of just brushing the outside. I would definitely recommend this product!</li>
    <li> I received it yesterday and the thing smells awful. I read the care instructions and washed it with my shampoo, but the smell hasn&#x27;t even lessened. I don&#x27;t plan on using it till the smell goes away or at least lets up a bit, but the brush looks great and as soon as I actually use it i&#x27;ll update my review.</li>
    <li> I bought this brush for my 10 year old daughter.  She has very straight hair.  This is the only brush I have ever used on her, that she does not start crying that it hurts.  She has even started brushing her own hair.  She loves the brush.</li>
    <li> I like a hairbrush that has both plastic quills for detangling and bristles for smoothing, but they&#x27;re kind of hard to find in stores. I finally had to throw away my old brush I&#x27;d been using for 10+ years, and I wanted a similar brush that would last me a good long time, so I took a chance on this one.     I&#x27;d never used boar bristles before, but it turns out they are great on my rather fine hair. My hair breaks easily, and most brushes I&#x27;ve tried are stiff and tend to tear my hair. This one is softer and gentler, but still with enough stiffness to get all the way to the scalp for detangling. The back and handle are a solid piece of wood, so I&#x27;m hoping it will last me for years. The polished wood even smells good to me! I think I&#x27;ve found a keeper.</li>
    <li> I have very thick hair and have never been able to use a boar bristle brush before. Although, its not advertised as a pneumatic brush it does have nylon bristles in the center of the boar and it feels wonderful on my scalp. It&#x27;s the perfect size and the handle is comfortable. I love this brush.</li>
    <li> I have really wanted a good boar bristle brush that would easily get through my thick hair.  This brush has met all of my expectations and more.  I find that I don&#x27;t want to stop brushing my hair because it feels so good.  I have also tried the manufacturer&#x27;s recommendation of conditioning the brush with essential oils, and I love how that makes my hair soft and fragrant (but not overpowering) while it softens the bristles as well.  I expect this brush to be one I keep for a long time.  Great value for the money and highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I have thick, coarse hair and was doubtful that a natural bristle brush could penetrate well enough so that I would even feel it. This brush works! The handle is shaped well for ease of holding. It is a beautiful brush. My head feels wonderfully stimulated after brushing and my coarse hair shines. Definitely would recommend.</li>
    <li> UPDATE April 7,2016- After 4 years of daily use, my brush looks like the it did the day it was delivered. It works wonderfully, don&#x27;t think I will ever have to buy another hairbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Original review-&lt;br /&gt;Great Boar brush. I had previously ordered a Spornette brush and returned it because the quality was not very good. This is the quality I was looking for. I needed a boar brush because I started the &amp;#34;no poo&amp;#34; routine and needed to distribute oil to the rest of my hair- this brush fits the bill.</li>
    <li> This brush is great. It brushes my long hair without pulling it out and leaves it very smooth and shiny. I am so glad I got this as a xmas gift!</li>
    <li> The product was just fine.  The brush was a little harder than I thought it would be.  I have fine hair, so it took awhile to get use to it.  It really does massages the scalp. I still get a lot of static electricity though.</li>
    <li> I just got this brush but so far I&#x27;m pretty satisfied with it. I have fairly long/thick hair and it doesn&#x27;t rip my hair out which is nice. It also gets through my considerably thick hair without scratching my scalp. So, so far so good. I obviously can&#x27;t speak to it&#x27;s durability yet but it seems pretty sturdy to me. I suppose it may not hold up to these Mason Pearson brushes I keep hearing about but I&#x27;m not exactly chomping at the bit to drop $150 on a hairbrush unless it&#x27;s made from dinosaur fossils. Only thing I&#x27;ve noticed so fair is it does create some static but nothing too major.</li>
    <li> This brush is a quality item to treasure and enjoy for many years.      Aesthetics: The wood has a nice shape and color and a solid feel.  The bristles are a pleasing combination of black boar bristle and white nylon.    Function: Makes hair soft and shiny.  Feels great against the scalp.    Hint: Make sure to wash brush every week or two according to package instructions.</li>
    <li> Nice brush.  Not quite what I was looking for.</li>
    <li> Nice combination of natural and nylon bristles.  Great size - not too big, not too small.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t usually like boars bristle brushes because they are usually too soft to go through my hair.  The fact that this one uses a combination of boars bristles and nylon bristles means that it goes through my hair easily and leaves my long straight hair very smooth.  I am very happy with this brush and am now purchasing two more - one for my mom and one for me.  Definitely recommended!</li>
    <li> The entire brush appears to be plastic, even the black bristles.  Nowhere on the product title/description or the box says that it contains wild boar bristles even though they keep mentioning it.  I was suspicious about this when I first read the descriptions but figured maybe they just worded it the way.  When I saw the product itself, the black bristles are incredibly stiff, shiny and each are perfectly tube shaped.  The tips of the white plastic pins are also poorly made.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I tried it, there is so much static and it pulls on hair (I have very straight hair)</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s okay.  In the winter, even though we have humidifiers in our house, this brush creates serious static when using it.  It is good for hair that doesn&#x27;t have a lot of knots (Ie, not good for kids) and long hair.  Not so good for thick hair or short hair (3&amp;#34; curls).  I didn&#x27;t feel that it distributed the oils in my hair to make it look more healthy.</li>
    <li> I just received this item and the first time I pulled it through my hair I fell in love with it. I was worried that it would snag my thick hair but it slid through really nicely. Feels great on the scalp and if you flip your head over and brush from the back down it really helps get those lose strands out and makes your hair really soft. I&#x27;ll be using this everyday. I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;ll be even better after i&#x27;ve done my hair and let it be for a day so I have more oil buildup. Would never go back to using a plastic or fake brush again. Between this and WEN hair conditioner i&#x27;m set for life.</li>
    <li> My hairdresser recommended that I get a natural bristle brush, because it would be gentle on my scalp and would help my  hair look glossier. I&#x27;ve had natural bristle brushes in the past, so I have some experience with them, but I have to say that I am a little disappointed in this [[ASIN:B000OLCM4W Ambassador Hairbrush, Oval, Oak Handle, 1 Hairbrush]].    The description does not make it clear that this brush has a combination of nylon and natural bristles. I was looking for an all-natural brush, so this was a significant omission. Also, the bristles on this brush are scratchy, so it&#x27;s not as gentle on my scalp as I had hoped.    From an aesthetic standpoint, the white rubber used for the bristle pad looks cheap, and the wooden handle is not ergonomic for your hand.    This hairbrush is a step up from the $5 boar bristles at my local beauty supply, but it&#x27;s not the good quality I had hoped for. This is an extremely average brush, so don&#x27;t expect anything exceptional from this product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been a Mason Pearson hair brush afficionada for years.  Nothing but the best for my hair.   But on a whim, I tried this Ambassador hair brush.  The result?  Fantastic!  My hair looked and felt  softer, shinier and thicker after the first use.  And to think  I only paid about $20 for it and a Mason Pearson  costs about $150!  Score.</li>
    <li> I had high hopes. I purchased a two pack of baby brushes from this company and they are wonderful. They make my daughter&#x27;s hair shiny and smooth, and I use them occasionally on my own hair after using a stronger brush to get the tangles out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased this brush because it has the extra pokey things to help with tangles. The pokey things are POKEY! They are extremely sharp and it appears that in an effort to make them less severe Ambassador has melted the tips, which look burned. The melted tips are even worse than the tips that missed the flame because they are still sharp and they snag my hair. I tried to salvage the brush by snipping the sharp tips one by one to make them level with the boar bristles so they would shred at my scalp less. It helped a little but the brush still hurts to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The boar bristles are also of less quality than the ones in my baby brushes. They&#x27;re very coarse and don&#x27;t make my hair shiny or smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Waste of money.</li>
    <li> Item Arrived As Described!</li>
    <li> This is my first boars head brush and I love it. I don&#x27;t know why I&#x27;ve been using other brushes. The boars head really smooths out my hair and makes it super shiny. My only complaint is that it took FOREVER to get to my house once I ordered it. I think it took about 3-4 weeks.</li>
    <li> We have 3 of these in our household now.  Everybody kept wanting to use this same brush!  Unlike some other brushes we&#x27;ve had, the finish on the wood holds up to water well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Works well on short and long hair.</li>
    <li> I have really thick, coarse, color-treated hair, and blow-drying has always been a nightmare for me. A couple months ago I was watching my hair stylist blow out my hair and finally realized how she gets it so smooth and soft! The brush! She had a flat (as opposed to round), boar bristle brush that she used to pull and smooth out my hair as she dried small sections. It seriously was a miracle! Some brushes sell for hundreds of dollars, but I bought this very brush from Amazon and my hair has not been the same. It is high quality, and I LOVE the look and feel of the oak handle. I actually enjoy blow-drying my hair now, because it always comes out super soft and smooth (it seriously changes the look and feel of my hair). Blow drying piece by piece is time consuming, but if you take the time to brush/blow it out, your hair will be smooth, straight and frizz-free (withOUT using a flat iron after!) This brush is awesome. If you don&#x27;t own or haven&#x27;t used a boar bristle brush, you won&#x27;t find a quality brush as inexpensive as this. Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> I have had one of these brushes(in a smaller size)for years and years. The wood started chipping around the head of it from being dropped and flung so many times. I decided it was time to look for a new one. I found this larger sized one here at Amazon. Each tuft of boar bristles has a single, stiff nylon bristle that is longer, implanted in the center. This gets the deep knots out of longer, thicker hair. It is a new brush so it&#x27;s stiff but it will break in nicely and become more forgiving to your hair and scalp. It&#x27;s a good price for a long lasting brush and the service was fast.</li>
    <li> I really like this brush. I use as my daily brush. I was worried that the boar bristles wouldn&#x27;t reach my scalp, but it seems to me that the longer bristles reach to the scalp and pull the hair there up into the boar bristles. My hair isn&#x27;t long, but it is fairly thick and wavy, and I do feel that this brush does an excellent job.  This company seems to care about the environment, animals, and quality of its products. I recommend this brush.</li>
    <li> the brush smells like spices.</li>
    <li> I have extremely long, extremely thick blonde wavy hair- this brush is wonderful! It goes through alllllll of my hair without a problem and without tugging (though I have a pretty high pain tolerance, so I don&#x27;t know if I would feel if if it did!). I&#x27;ve only had it for a couple of weeks, but so far, it&#x27;s perfect. I love to brush my hair... it&#x27;s such a relaxing feeling and this brush totally helps! :)</li>
    <li> Update: Recently, the brush isn&#x27;t going through my hair as easily and deep as before.  Don&#x27;t know if my hair has changed or if the bristles have gotten softer.  Still the best I&#x27;ve found so far for my hair, even if not as perfect as before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Original:&lt;br /&gt;Having somehow misplaced the wonderful brush I had for years, I&#x27;ve had a difficult time finding a replacement boar/nylon bristle brush that can get through my thick dense wavy hair all the way down to my scalp.  Based on the reviews here, I decided to try this one, and it arrived today.  I think this is the most I&#x27;ve ever spent on a hair brush, and it&#x27;s worth every penny.  Works beautifully with my hair.  Feels so good to be able to give it a really thorough brushing again(have been using just a nylon pin brush in the interim, doesn&#x27;t work anywhere near as well as this one).</li>
    <li> Just received my Ambassador brush and I&#x27;ve been enjoying it; I&#x27;ve never wanted to brush so much before! It makes my hair look and feel amazing, and the bristles feel good on the scalp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can see how this will be very helpful to those who went \\&quot;no &#x27;poo\\&quot; like me. You can instantly tell that the brush is helping spread your natural oils through your hair, which avoids that icky, greasy look. Plus it keeps your hair nice and healthy. Honestly; if you think you need tonnes of conditioner to achieve shine and luster, you&#x27;re wrong! I&#x27;m getting it with water, occasional vinegar/baking soda and this brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair is quite thick, and while I have to spend a bit of time brushing to do a good job of it, the combination of boar bristles and nylon is fantastic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price is respectable compared to some other brushes I&#x27;ve seen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This really does the trick! I love it and I feel that I made a good investment. I wouldn&#x27;t hesitate to recommend this to anyone looking for a quality boar bristle brush.</li>
    <li> This is a very good quality hair brush. i loved it from the first day I got it. I would highly recommend this brush to people who is looking for the&lt;br /&gt; price/quality correlation.</li>
    <li> The tips on the the Nylon  bristles  are very harsh, the design should be rounded tips but the paint on the bristles are coming off and scratches the scalp .&lt;br /&gt; Probably Ok for someone with really coarse thick hair, that was just using it to brush out the middle section and the ends of the hair, but this brush will be a disaster for the scalp.</li>
    <li> I had a similar hairbrush, which I lost and could never find another that could match up. This is a fantastic hairbrush!  Couldn&#x27;t be more pleased!</li>
    <li> I purchased this product as the boar hairs are humanely shaven from farm cattle, and I&#x27;m extremely satisfied with the product results. My hair comes out soft and shiny after each use. I&#x27;d recommend for anyone looking for a healthier brush for their hair.</li>
