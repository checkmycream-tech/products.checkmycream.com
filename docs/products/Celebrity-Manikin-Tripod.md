      <li>I love this tripod, it looks professional, sturdy, adjustable and came in the time that they stated that I would receive it.</li>
      <li>Just spend the money on a quality tripod from a reputable professional beauty supply.</li>

      <li>Other than that it&#x27;s a good tripod for working on mannequins.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s pretty decent, but it moves around easily.</li>
      <li>The first time, I pulled this out at cosmetology school, everyone in the class was like wow, that is so nice and classy.  </li>

      <li>Also had to contact the seller first through anazon to get approval for the return.</li>
      <li>This is pretty much spot on to the pivot point tripod.  </li>
      <li>I used this about three times and noticed the top was a bit loose.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s fine to use for now as I&#x27;m just starting out and will not purchase another unit at this time.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s really sturdy.</li>

      <li>Its very sturdy when working with manikins and very flexible to work with.</li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t fit mannequin head properly.  </li>
      <li>The other thing I would change would to have some type of metal piece at the bottom that you could place your foot on top of so that the stand doesn&#x27;t move.</li>
      <li>Decent value for a very high-quality tripod.</li>
      <li>Works well for the mannequin head, stable and easy enough for my 13yr old daughter to use.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Great accompaniment for the mannequin hair doll.</li>
    <li> I was pleasantly surprised when I received my tripod, the quality was better than expected! I would totally recommend to a friend!</li>
    <li> It was a little confusing for me on how to adjust the height (you have to pull the tabs located on the middle)there were no instructions included, but once I figured it out it became easy to set up the tripod. This tripod comes with its own bag, which is a great way to store it when it is not in use. I am very happy with my purchase and now I can style my lace wigs like a professional!</li>
    <li> Excellent quality, strong and sturdy</li>
    <li> This is the first time I ever wrote a review. And I must say I LOVE THIS PRODUCT. My boyfriend brought me this for Christmas so i can practice more on doing hair and I absolutely love it. I can adjust it to the height I want and practice hairstyles on my manikin head. OMG best gift ever!!! Its well worth the price. I can promise you that you would not regret this if you purchase this item.</li>
    <li> I love this professional Tripod, it exceeded my expectations.  It lengthens more than one way, has locks for safety, stores away easily, and the carry case is perfect.</li>
    <li> The set screw was stripped within the first month of light use. Would not recommend.</li>
    <li> This Was Everything I Expect It to Be .. Love The Fact That It Goes To My High .. Love It</li>
    <li> Perfect for wig making. I love it</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s pretty decent, but it moves around easily.</li>
    <li> Better than the previous one.</li>
    <li> I used this about three times and noticed the top was a bit loose. And then when I was out of town using it during an important training the entire top portion came right off. With the head still attached. Not cool.&lt;br /&gt;It looked to have only been glued in and never secure to begin with. And of course I get back from my trip, where it came apart and I had to scramble to use one, ONE DAY too late to return it. also not cool Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line, this is JUNK. Just spend the money on a quality tripod from a reputable professional beauty supply.</li>
    <li> The first time, I pulled this out at cosmetology school, everyone in the class was like wow, that is so nice and classy.  I just wish that it came with some directions.</li>
    <li> This ia a good sturdy tripod if only comes in perfect conditions. At only 8 days after bought it I had to returned it back for defects. rukm?! hate this</li>
    <li> I really like this tripod because it does what the description says and for the price this is great. I would recommend this to anyone who needs a manikin tripod.</li>
    <li> Sturdy and light weight.</li>
    <li> Do not purchase this! I bought one for my daughter for use in cosmetology school. She used it one time the top section fell out. The threads are aluminum and cannot withstand the tension of the stylist styling the hair. If you are just displaying a mannequin it will be fine. I read through the reviews and saw several stating the same problem. We contacted a local salon supply warehouse and purchased one of much better quality for less than $100.00</li>
    <li> First one lasted a few months. It broke and I bought a new one and it lasted a week.</li>
    <li> Yes, I like this product. What I need, is the same. I&#x27;ll definitely tell to my friends &amp; relatives. Thx</li>
    <li> This is soo sleek. It&#x27;s easy to mount up easy to pack up and store up. It&#x27;s sturdy. Excellent quality ....would definitely recommend this as a good buy. Great for a cosmetology student or tutor. It&#x27;s just great!!!!</li>
    <li> This stand is no good I may have used his stand five times .....and it just fall apart</li>
    <li> One of the legs do not stay pulled out.. Will not buy again</li>
    <li> Very cheap tripod. Unless you have it all the way extended the latches will come loose and the head on the tripod will come tumbling off. Not cool when you are giving a class. The zipper on the tote bag  broke inside of a month.</li>
    <li> I am a Non-Surgical Hair Replacement Hairstylist, this is just what I needed to repair wigs or make extensions units or wigs for my clients. The adjustment level on the tripod does adjust low enough that if you are wanting to sit down  on your couch or chair to work you are able to do so without stress. Although, I did not care for the smell on the product; which is why I rated it 4 instead of 5, I am overall pleased with my purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will recommend for purchase, if you are a student stylist and professional stylist, it is a must have in your line of utensils needed for our profession.</li>
    <li> I bought 2 and 1 is working ok, the other opened later and found out the center holder does not working properly. I want to ask for an exchange but the response is late.</li>
    <li> Works well for the mannequin head, stable and easy enough for my 13yr old daughter to use.</li>
    <li> It very useful! When I ordered it I thought that I could use it without the stand! Other than that it serve the purpose!</li>
    <li> got it for a advance cutting class.work great.came on time and have a case and is really nice to work with</li>
    <li> This tripod is great!</li>
    <li> love this, bought to style wigs, this is an awsome purchase and great for what I do, sturdy, well made, so glad I purchased will get years of use from this.</li>
    <li> Came damaged but does the job</li>
    <li> It started falling apart about the second time I used it.  Total waste of money.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a stand.  It holds the doll heads.</li>
    <li> It was full of hair and the part where u put the head on broke!! Piece of s***!!!! Don&#x27;t buy!!! Advise!!!</li>
    <li> Its great. Just whst I needed for my job. It doesn&#x27;t take up to much space and its light weight.</li>
    <li> Very durable. I&#x27;m 6&#x27;1 and it elevated to the height i needed it to be. It was also very light to carry.</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with it. I am looking forward to using it.</li>
    <li> Great tripod. Very study and perfect! Just what I needed. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Perfect for veterans and newbies.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s really sturdy. I practice a ton of hairstyles on my doll and this is perfect for holding everything place.</li>
    <li> Liked the product does the job. If using styrofoam heads simply place a towel over the metal post then place styrofoam head and it&#x27;s much more secure. I love the fact I can manage and curl my own hair pieces.</li>
    <li> Although I like this tripod it is a bit &amp;#34;shaky&amp;#34;! I use it a lot and would it even better if it had petals on it to give it more stability. Other than that it&#x27;s a good tripod for working on mannequins.</li>
    <li> In school and needed one for home. Works great holds all my maniquin heads just fine. Stays at the height i place it.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping &amp; item was everything I expected it to be</li>
    <li> Good product. Good service.</li>
    <li> Love it!!! Not too heavy, sturdy, comes with a travel bag easy to use.</li>
    <li> I give classes for a color company. I needed something quick. It worked GREAT. Very solid and sturdy! Compares well to Pivot Point!</li>
    <li> Came quickly, works great! Convenient carrying case! Love it!</li>
    <li> I chose this to go with a previously purchased mannequin head. Works well &amp; adjusts to many heights for comfort.</li>
    <li> One of the legs won&#x27;t lock so it&#x27;s VERY hard to adjust to the heights I need it to be and its an overall pain to move around because of this issue.</li>
    <li> daughter loves it she does different hair style and can move around it to fix the mannequin hair</li>
    <li> I am pleased with this product. .</li>
    <li> i bought this tripod because i style a lot of wigs. I really like it. it adjusts well, comes with a case so i can put away the case in a compact manner... only negetive is that i orderd the tray to this and it was backordered so i never got it. that means i dont have where to hold my blower and curler and brush while i style wigs. otherwise this stand is fairly sturdy and does the job!</li>
    <li> I truly enjoy this product. Ex excellent quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
    <li> Decent value for a very high-quality tripod. The product came on time and as described.</li>
    <li> this is the worse tripod!!  the top where you place the mannequin is so stiff and the other piece just turns and turns.  I had the same problems with the first one that was sent to me and sent that back for a replacement and the replacement is no better!!! so disappointed!!  POOR QUALITY</li>
    <li> Too expensive for quality of material you get. Requested a refund Bc of that. Customers service rep asked why I wanted a return, told him just that &amp; nothing. I&#x27;m still waiting to hear back, &amp; that was a month ago. Spend a couple more bucks &amp; save yourself the trouble of buying this crap.</li>
    <li> For the price I paid, the product quality, features and looks are great. Its very sturdy when working with manikins and very flexible to work with. Shipping, packaging was good too. Would buy again.</li>
    <li> Used only twice had to glue top back on.  Couldn&#x27;t return it had it three months.</li>
    <li> Great for making my own wigs/ quick weaves out of kankelon braid hair.  I was having to balance manikin heads between my legs before.  Now, I can adjust depending on which part of the head I&#x27;m working on and also trim the finished product while getting a good look at it.</li>
    <li> Hi. I&#x27;m not sure if there is a way to make this more sturdy but that&#x27;s the only issue I do have with it. I like the look of it and I like that it goes from shorty to about 6 feet.(?) It&#x27;s easy to adjust once you take a few minutes to figure it out. My tripod did not come with instructions. I think that if all three legs are extended to the exact same length that would create more stability. It&#x27;s fine to use for now as I&#x27;m just starting out and will not purchase another unit at this time. I also use this on carpet which could also cause instability. I use this and I do not regret the purchase at all.  My previous review was in February/2015. It is now June/2016 and I need another tripod. This tripod is very challenging to get balanced. Also the top piece seems to have lost a piece or a screw because it turns constantly making it impossible to use. I&#x27;m rather dissatisfied with having to replace it so soon.</li>
    <li> Works great and easy to travel with. Perfect for teaching as it can be placed on the floor or on a table top.  Priced ok.</li>
    <li> this is my 1st wig tripod, after having it for 9 months, the leg finally went out on me, but I don&#x27;t care I just put some super glue on it and got back to making wigs.. if I ever have to close the tripod up I just use some pillars and close it and open it and im back in business.</li>
    <li> I thought i was going to have to put it together and deal with instructions with it and it be bulky but it came in a carrying case AND already put together and not bulky at all!!! It is slim and easy to adjust to the height I need.....I just Love it.....I have used other ones that were hard to get around and hard to adjust and bulky.... I highly recommend this to any student or teacher that needs one.....</li>
    <li> I love this tripod, it looks professional, sturdy, adjustable and came in the time that they stated that I would receive it. I would purchase it again and would recommend it to others.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t fit mannequin head properly.  Not easy to pull up and down.</li>
    <li> Great purchase - love how it adjusts - gives a better height - feels better when working.</li>
    <li> Difficult to adjust ..does not hold head in a tight upright  position keeps slipping stand is cheaply made no way to hold  upright keeps toppling over.&lt;br /&gt;do not buy..I have to say Amazon let me  return with no problems. I will use amazon in the future but I have to say they need to inspect what here selling from china more thoroughly.</li>
    <li> Horrible product! It deserves no stars. Broke after a month of using it in numerous spots. Also it was very loose. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> I am using this tripod for a wig head stand.  This is a quality tripod.</li>
    <li> Works very well to support my heavy canvas manikin head. It makes styling wigs much easier than using a desk mount.</li>
    <li> Great buy!  Sturdy, easy to raise to the correct height.  Perfect for training sessions and testing.</li>
    <li> Does what it needs to do and folds up compactly.</li>
    <li> It tips over .. I can&#x27;t use it at all&lt;br /&gt;Michealle</li>
    <li> Anxiously awaited this item only to be disappointed when one of the clips on the 3rd tripod leg wouldn&#x27;t stay buckled causing it to collapse. I worked with it over and over for an hour or more, put it away and then tried again before finally giving up with the realization it was simply broken.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s weighty so boxing it back up and having to ship back was a pain. Also had to contact the seller first through anazon to get approval for the return. A pain all rhe way around!&lt;br /&gt;Wished the seller would have offered to send me a new one (tested first for reliability) and have the broken one picked up.</li>
    <li> Excellent product and value!  This is pretty much spot on to the pivot point tripod.  Well worth the price</li>
    <li> Very nice and easy to use.  Well worth the price.  I liked it very much and would recommend it to others.</li>
    <li> I am in hair school and use a manikin head everyday and needed a tripod. I would not rebuy this product because the metal that the head actually sits on is too small and my head moves every time I use it or even brush the hair. I have tried using a towel and then placing the head on that so it fits tighter and doesn&#x27;t move but it doesn&#x27;t work well and makes holes in the towel. The other thing I would change would to have some type of metal piece at the bottom that you could place your foot on top of so that the stand doesn&#x27;t move. It doesn&#x27;t move every time but it still does a few times a day and it gets very annoying.</li>
    <li> Works well but head has fallen off a few times, I.e. Hard to tighten</li>
    <li> Great Product and fast delivery</li>
