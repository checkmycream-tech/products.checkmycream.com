<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> For my daughter that has sensitive skin.  Works great. Very absorbent.</li>
    <li> I use this on my 5 year old who has an occasional eczema flare up.  This product really helped to get this under control and it didn&#x27;t agitate her skin in anyway. Our typical routine was to apply right out of the bath.  Doing it that way aids in moisturizing the skin.  Its not as thick as Vaseline which I appreciate because it applies smoothly and doesn&#x27;t leave that thick residue on top of your skin.  This stuff penetrates.  This combined with the lotion and soap made by Vaniply are the only items we use on her skin.</li>
    <li> I will definitely be buying more.</li>
    <li> Excellent buying experience!</li>
    <li> Breast cancer radiation burns and then blue lite skin cancer burns. This stuff  is really good. I think I like it better than petroleum products. Feels and looks about the same tho.  I recommend highly. I like all the Vanicream products altho the sunblock products didn&#x27;t test well. Hopefully they beef it up.</li>
    <li> This is not just for lips as incorrectly labeled. This ointment is for dry skin, chapped skin, general irritated skin. I use it after shaving my legs every day, as it is the only thing that keeps them from getting razor burn and being irritated and itchy in general. Great stuff -better than Aquaphor!</li>
    <li> great product, keep the wound area moist and helps greatly with the healing process</li>
    <li> Great at helping calm my daughter&#x27;s eczema on her hands</li>
    <li> For me, vaniply was too thin and did not absorb quickly enough into the skin.  I prefer aqaphor but vanly is a way better bargain if that&#x27;s what you&#x27;re looking for.</li>
    <li> wonderful for really dry skin</li>
    <li> My son gets very dry and itchy skin. I have to put lots of cream or ointment on him everyday. We recently tried Vaniply Ointment and it works to lock in the moisture. It gets rid of the itching and helps my son sleep better at night.</li>
    <li> Easily applied and provided good moisturizer.</li>
    <li> i do enjoy this product but it does not give me as much protection as aquaphor. probably because it is not as greasy. still enjoy on my face during the day when i am public so i dont shine in class or at work.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my wife who has extremely sensitive skin has been allergic to every type of face lotion she has tried (countless brands).  She has been using this for months now with no problem and she loves it.  I can honestly say it has improved her skin smoothness and feel.  Well moisturized smooth skin is so much better then dry rough skin.</li>
    <li> GREAT OINTMENT FOR SENSITIVE SKIN AND ECZEMA.&lt;br /&gt;USE IT AS NEEDED AND LOVE ALL THE VANIPLY PRODUCTS.&lt;br /&gt;GREAT FOR BABIES WITH SKIN ISSUES.</li>
    <li> My son has food allergies along with allergies to MSG and some preservatives. We used with Vanicream and he didn&#x27;t have any major reactions.  I purchased Vaniply to help with the more severe eczema areas and he had a major reaction to it.  I do not think it is very hypoallergenic as claimed on the packaging.  Ever since we applied the Vaniply, he gets a reaction from sitting on our couch because the Vaniply got on it and we can&#x27;t get if off.  Very disappointed with this product.</li>
    <li> Like others, my child has extreme eczema--as in head-to-toe eczema--and this caused a reaction. All ingredients are synthetic. The dermatologist recommended it but I really hate it. Poor kid now has huge sores all over. More $$ down the drain trying to alleviate symptoms.</li>
    <li> It is really clearing up a severe case of contact dermatitis!</li>
    <li> I love this cream.  Though a bit sticky, my skin definitely gets less itchy after applying it after shower.</li>
    <li> During the winter, my lips always get overly dry and chapped. I tried EVERY product on the market and nothing worked. I got to the point where I went to the dermatologist to get a recommendation on cures. The doctor handed me a small sample of this, and mentioned that it&#x27;s formula is for protecting against dry skin, which is why I hadn&#x27;t heard of it before. I tried it and my problem disappeared, I couldn&#x27;t believe it! After my sample ran out, I sought out more and decided on this large jar. I use a small amount of this literally twice a day and it has lasted for over a year and a half. In fact, the jar is still 3/4 full. The actual texture is like petroleum jelly but slightly more oily. If you are having problems with chapped lips, please try this product. The jar is a great value too. I&#x27;ll definitely be buying again!</li>
    <li> This is amazing for dry and sensitive skin.  It was recommended by my dermatologist  for very good reasons for my skin--it works!</li>
    <li> LOVE THIS PRODUCT!!! this is the only product that moisturizes my babies face and Keeps the eczema away!</li>
    <li> BEST STUFF I HAVE EVER USED, IT ONLY TOOK 35+ YEARS TO FIND</li>
    <li> Works great on my daughters rash on back of legs.  Doesn&#x27;t clear it up but definately controls it and keeps it from flaring up.</li>
    <li> i use this on my cracked feet, chapped and cracked hands and used it on my face and i kid you not all my acne is gone now and no more red face for me! It has also made my lips so soft-i use it like chap stix! I have only had this two days and ordered another tub as i goes on like petrolum jelly but works so much better than that!  I also have hair folical disease so when i shave my legs i get a rash no matter what but using the vanicream soap it does not hurt anymore and i break out less than before since i follow it up with this cream. Also my legs no longer burn from dryness from shaving-i used vanicream lotion before but i think this coats my legs better after i shave. Its really amazing. I used it on my kiddos mosquito bits and she did not itch it anymore and they look a lot smaller today as well. I also used it on my mosquito bits too and they are not itchy today either. I used this on my hubby arms where he got cut up from bushes and also on his legs where his skin is growing back from a bad case of poisen ivy-helped right away with the itching. Amazing cream really! I used to use palmers shea butter on my feet but now im switching to this. I wish i would have found this line of products sooner as i just got introduced about two weeks ago to vanicream. Now i use the clear and free shampoo/conditioner, vanicream soap and vanicream heavy lotion along with this lotion as well. Im in love! Please never stop making all the lines of your products as it is amazing!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;two week update:&lt;br /&gt;So sad as this has broken my face out even worse then before i starting using this cream so now i went back to just using the vanicream soap and then the vanicream lotion  with it and no more vaniply on my face just too greasy i guess. I can not go back and use the purpose soap i used before discovering vanicream since i did just that and my face itched so bad i thougth i was gonna lose my mind-i also used to use Rx system face moisturer and that made my eyes hurts and face once i put that on too. Crazy this stuff is amazing and i wish i could put it on my face but i can not. I still use it for all the other things i originally starting using it for so its worth the money and i love it but i need to find something else for my face as the vanicream is fine until i get the dryness i caused by using the purpose soap again under control. Does anyone know if they make a lotion just for the face? i think that would be much better. I think i might call the company if i get sometime.</li>
    <li> This is NOT a lop ointment, and I&#x27;m not sure how Amazon got the idea it is!  I&#x27;ve used Vanni cream and lotion for years.  This is a new great companion product.  It goes on a little greasy feeling if you apply too much.  A little goes a long way.  I find it a great companion product for the cream and lotion.  I put a little Vaniply on first (and I mean a little spread very thinly) and then apply the cream or lotion.  This is a really great thing for those of us with very dry skin.  The way this acts is that it attracts the moisture and keeps the skin where it has been applied nice and hydrated for hours.</li>
    <li> This is not a lotion, it is more like an ointment. This is the only thing I&#x27;ve found to treat my hand eczema.  I put this on several times a day, caution it does make your hands slimy so don&#x27;t use if you are using computer or cell phone.  I put it on at bedside and all dryness is gone by morning!</li>
    <li> Great for my kid&#x27;s dry hands in Winter</li>
    <li> very thick ointment perfect for those with eczema! vaniply ointment and vanicream are the only lotions I have found to work for my family.</li>
    <li> I have incredibly reactive, sensitive, combination skin, and the only thing that works is Vaniply layered over high linoleic safflower oil. I have probably spent hundreds of dollars on moisturizers that made my skin red, congested or pimply and this has been such a godsend as a vaseline, occlusive substitute. It also comes in a creamier consistency than something like vaseline, so it&#x27;s just super comfortable and user-friendly. Would HIGHLY recommend to anyone sensitive to most ingredients or anyone who just wants a superior version of vaseline. 10/10</li>
    <li> Works great! not too oily</li>
    <li> Love this ointment for my toddler who is allergic to all parabens. It was reccomended by her allergist. It goes on well and is not greasy. It really soaks in.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this product! It absolutely supercedes any other ointment designed to prevent diaper rash, including vaseline! just a thick swipe on irritated areas, does the trick. I highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> My sister told me about this product it truly works for chapped and cracked hands I will never be with out a bottle on my shelf again.</li>
    <li> Vaniply is really great for treating dry skin when you have to bare your face in public. It&#x27;s barely detectable (looks normal over my makeup too) and very moisturizing without having to relegate it to being a night ointment.</li>
    <li> Buying this product was much more cost effective in this size.  Our original 3.5 ounce tube cost nearly three times as much per ounce. Quite a quantity discount.</li>
    <li> Only product my husband with contact dermatitis can use.  He cannot go one day without it.  Thanks for carrying this amazon!!</li>
    <li> this product what excellent at moisturizing my skin and keeping it soft and smooth throughout the day. it may be a little bit oily initially but that soon disappears. my mother who is elderly also uses it on her skin and it keeps your skin really soft and wrinkle free.</li>
    <li> I have been using Vanicream for a few weeks and it is wonderful. Vaniply is surprisingly effective, too. and also excellent for my maladies. It goes on greasy, but in a few moments it turns into a thin-layered protectant, which is what my eczema patches require. I will buy the 13 oz. jar as soon as I finish the doc&#x27;s samples. I am looking forward to the best winter for my skin in a very long time. Although Vaniply is not antibacterial, I plan on using it on my hands to protect my skin from whatever irritates them when i rest them on the bars on the elliptical at the gym. BTW, I put on vaniply before typing this review on my iPad - and not one smudge.</li>
    <li> This is NOT as good as the vanicream cream. It feels good going on and is soothing. However, it does not provide the moisturization as the cream and does not provide the anti-itch properties of the cream. The majority of the time I only have the apply the vanicream cream once in the morning and do not have to re-apply until the next morning. With the ointment I had to reapply in about four to five hours and I need something that provides the anti-itch properties throughout the whole day. I will not reorder but I will not send it back either. I will use it on the parts of my body that is not infected with eczema. The ointment is similar to vaseline but is free of perfumes, dyes, etc., like the vanicream cream. UPDATE: Even though this ointment does not provide the anti-itch protection for me as does the vanicream cream it does provide superior moisturization for the skin and I love the way that it feels on my skin. It is far superior to aquaphor or vaseline is not as greasy and it absorbs very well. I came back and gave it five instead of four stars as I have decided to purchase it again as I always keep a jar of vaseline in my house but I will be purchasing this also. It is probably excellent for skin that is only experiencing severe dryness and cracking. Remember: It may or may not stop your skin from itching. It did not stop my skin from itching but it may do so for you as everyone is different. Vanicream cream stop my skin from itching practically completely although I have to apply it at least once everyday and somedays maybe twice but this is a very minor inconvenience as anyone suffereing from eczema will tell you stopping your skin from itching will stop you from stratching and that is about 90 percent of the problem of this vicious skin condition. If you can stop the itch/stratch cycle and get a top of the line product to provide moisture it gives your skin an opportunity to heal.</li>
    <li> believe it or not this is a great product my son uses it for his psoriasis and it actually works very well he also has patches of eczema which also works very well I definitely recommend this product for dry skin use</li>
    <li> Helps calm eczema when nothing else will work. Doesn&#x27;t burn.</li>
    <li> I received a sample of this product from my dermatologist. This stuff works so well on cracked and dry lips during the winter that I decided to buy this larger bottle. I&#x27;ll probably never have to buy a lip balm again, but it was worth the price! I use it every day.</li>
    <li> I really like this ointment . It is really a cross between vanicream and aquaphor . You only need a littlefor it to work . I like using it especially after a bath . It spreads easily and a little goes a long way . It does not immediatle sink in and is a heavy duty ointment . Great for dry feet and hands . There is really no scent which I like and does not irritate my skin. It is a little pricy but you only use a small amount so its a good buy . I do wish it cost less though.</li>
    <li> I have very acne-prone skin (went through two rounds of Accutane and still have it). This has relatively few ingredients compared to most moisturizers, and I think that&#x27;s part of the reason why it doesn&#x27;t clog my pores. My topical acne gel (Atralin) in combo with my oral medication (Solodyn) really dries out my skin, but Vaniply makes sure it doesn&#x27;t get flaky. (Flakiness only causes build-up in pores, so well-moisturized skin really helps lessen acne breakouts). I apply after my gel at night and it works wonderfully (it has the consistency of Vaseline).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The seller got my order to me two days before I expected, which was awesome!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A note unrelated to the seller: The manufacturer of Vaniply (Pharmaceutical Specialties Inc.) claims on its website that Vaniply is available in Walgreens and ShopKo stores. I live in a rather large city, but none of my local Walgreens stocks it (you have to order through the pharmacy) and ShopKo doesn&#x27;t carry it either, which is annoying since I had to pay 30% of the product cost in shipping charges. Just a heads up if you expect to find this product in stores, because you&#x27;ll most likely need to order it online.</li>
    <li> Very similar to aquaphor but a lot less greasy. My son who has severe eczema has been doing really good with Vaniply.</li>
    <li> I have really bad eczema and my dermatologist said to try this. It has saved my skin!!!</li>
    <li> LUV this product! It goes on like petroleum jelly but soaks completely in and doesn&#x27;t leave you greasy.  My daughter has skin allergies and after putting her prescription ointment on, she puts this over it and it blocks everything bad from getting to her skin and keeps her own body moisture in her skin.  Can&#x27;t say enough how much we love this product!</li>
    <li> Recommended by our dermatologist for my daughters eczema. She&#x27;s very sensitive and didn&#x27;t work. Made it worse. Would not really recommend.</li>
    <li> We have been using this product for about a month and a half -two months and it&#x27;s great. Will be buying his stuff again when our tub is empty, that maybe a while because with 13 ounces we shouldn&#x27;t run out for a while. My daughter even loves how it goes on her skin.</li>
    <li> Works Great! It REALLY absorbs into my dry skin like not other ointment I have used in over 20 years!</li>
    <li> i love vaniply..i recently developed a skin condition called rosacea on my face..i tried everything and nothing worked..however vaniply has helped amazingly..its calmed down the rosacea..also a little goes a long way..feels really good on my face ..absolutely love this product..the results  occured in just 2 days of use..this product was also highly recommended by my dermatolagist</li>
    <li> Bought this after an allergist gave me a sample of it. It doesn&#x27;t moisturize your skin, it&#x27;s just a greasy film. After putting this over my whole body, my skin still felt tight and dry. I tried using it on my lips and it worked great, but it made my throat sore... I guess because whatever you put on your lips, you eat a little bit of it, so once this Vaniply hit my throat it got sore/made me feel like I was getting a cold. I don&#x27;t like that feeling so now I just have this giant tub of stuff sitting around wasting space and money. Not a bad product, just not for me.</li>
    <li> This is the best treatment I have found for my kids psoriasis. It is thick and does not soak into the skin but it does not have any odor and works in just a few applications. I definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Use it on our five year old who has severe dry skin proble,. Works well and keeps his skin hydrated</li>
    <li> Using while on Accutane, which totally dries out your skin.  This is a very thick ointment good for cracked hands, elbows, the area around your nose, etc. A small amount goes a long way so this jar will last a while.</li>
    <li> My Dermatologist recommended this product for problems I was having with periodermitis.  It keeps my skin moistened and somewhat free of the skin condition .</li>
    <li> Works great for my daughter&#x27;s eczema. She keeps a jar at home and a jar at school.</li>
    <li> I love the lotion. It works well at night without petroleum.</li>
    <li> Great of sensitive skin not heavy and can be used on my face and great for the feet.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a little greasy, so use only at night.  Very thick--which is what you need to help keep your eczema from flaring up.</li>
    <li> I really love this ointment and would have given a 4 star except that it is a bit like vasoline and thus, a bit too  heavy and greasy for regular use.  That being said, it is perfect for boiling weather or freezing weather where you need more protection.  When talking boiling I am talking &amp;#62;100 F, with little humidity, and freezing, &amp;#60;35 with again little humidity.  This is a great &amp;#34;coating&amp;#34; product and very reasonably priced.  Has been extremely helpful to me.</li>
    <li> My Daughter has eczema and severly dry skin especially her face.  Her Doctor recommended this ointment for her face and it has been wonerful.  This cream is wonderful.  It works well.</li>
    <li> This was recommended by my dermatologist after I had a reaction to Aquaphor.  I love this, it works great for my eczema problems.</li>
    <li> A little greasy, but does the trick.</li>
    <li> This lotion makes your skin feel like a baby&#x27;s bottom.  Calmed my sun burn and hydrates skin quickly.</li>
    <li> this is a fantastic product. my dermatologist recommended it for my daughter who has eczema. we cover her every night and it works great!  and it does not contain petroleum.</li>
    <li> Bought it only after I have had a chance to try samples. The result of my trials is excellent.</li>
    <li> I tried this for the first time a few days ago on my dry, cracked feet, after trying a multitude of other products.  This is the BEST (better than Glysolid which also has great reviews).  I apply it on before bedtime and it doesn&#x27;t leave any greasy feeling after applying it. My feet feel so much softer!  Love this stuff.</li>
    <li> for my super super sensitive skin this is the only product that i have found that does not sting me. it is light and feels great</li>
    <li> I bought this for my 2 year old who has eczema based on the allergy specialist&#x27;s recommendation. I didn&#x27;t find her skin to improve at all.  It did not provide any moisturizing effect to her skin, it doesn&#x27;t apply very smoothly...and worst of all it smells weird, like melted crayons.  Aquaphor works much better for her.</li>
    <li> We started using this stuff based on the rec of our son&#x27;s pediatric dermatologist for controlling his eczema.  We use it every night after his bath. It feels much nicer than Aquaphor and baby&#x27;s skin has looked a lot better.  I like that it doesn&#x27;t contain any harsh chemicals and is completely fragrance-free.</li>
    <li> Super stuff!! I received a sample from our Allergist and ordered this tub right away. My son is using it in his eczema and it&#x27;s awesome. It&#x27;s free of bad chemicals and it just soothes his skin. He will now moisturize himself because this doesn&#x27;t burn.</li>
    <li> Parents... I use this on my 1 year old with every diaper change. She has EXTREMELY sensitive skin, the vaniply protects her bottom from the soiled diaper and also keeps her skin healthy. Used aquaphor before, but just learned the lanolin in it is actually drying and have tried every other diaper cream out there, the vaniply works so well. I&#x27;ve even had ointment prescribed from the doctor, because her skin is so sensitive, I&#x27;m very happy and will continue to use vaniply. A little bit does go a long way too!</li>
    <li> My doctor suggested I get this for my inflammatory lip problem I have. It was amazing. This is the only thing that I will ever use on my lips again. I had tried every lip balm, ointment, medication there is out there over a 2 year period. Nothing worked. I was so frustrated and hopeless until I ordered this. Vaniply did not cure my problem, but it keeps me totally under control. My 84 year old mother uses it on her severely dry skin. She loves it. I would suggest this to any one.</li>
    <li> Pediatrician recommended Vaniply and I was only able to find small tubes at Walgreens and as a result, did not consistently apply.  Once I received the 13 ounce, I had enough to consistently apply to my baby twice a day and his skin is as good as new.  Thanks Amazon for caring this size.</li>
    <li> Love it. It can be used for so many uses. Sooo much better than vasaline!</li>
    <li> We bought this on the recommendation of a dermatologist.  It seems to work better than Aquaphor and it is a little less messy.  Does seem to absorb very quickly, which is good for making less of a mess, but skin does seem to be dry within a few hours so it is not ideal for overnight use (must be reapplied to particularly bad areas.  Would give 5 stars if the effects lasted longer.</li>
    <li> Oily and thick, has a rubbery smell. I like CeraVe better for my son&#x27;s eczema.</li>
    <li> Only partial healing of dry skin. Only acid mantle cures dry skin; but too expensive at over $100 a pound.</li>
    <li> I have moderate rosacea and have a reaction to everything I use, even products that claim to be specifically for rosacea. This is the first product I&#x27;ve used that moisturizes my skin and eliminates the awful flakiness and red bumps associated with rosacea. My skin is noticeably better after only a week of use!! I seriously start tearing up when I realized it was working because it has been such a frustrating and embarrassing battle to find a product that works and being low income I can&#x27;t afford the prescriptions. This product is wonderful!</li>
    <li> Dr recommended for dry chapped lips and skin. I like cream better for skin, but for lips it&#x27;s the best.</li>
    <li> This worked great for our 1 year old with eczema.  It keeps her skin very moist, especially at night, when we coat her whole body with this, and then, zip her up in a sleeper.  So glad I found this!  The creams on the market for eczema did not work for our litle girl (even Vanicream was too thin and did not moisture enough).</li>
    <li> This is the best moisturizer ever. I highly recommend it to ANYONE who is anti dyes, anti colors and parabins. It is amazing.</li>
    <li> I have been buying this for my nephew for the past year. His mom has tried several other products,but always comes back to this one! Keeps his skin moisturized,and is not greasy.</li>
    <li> been using this product for 5 years i love it. my whole family use it and love it. definitylty a 5 stars in my book</li>
    <li> This ointment is great for my daughter&#x27;s eczema! The lotion formulas burn her skin, but the ointment works well for her.</li>
    <li> Really like this product and got fast delivery</li>
    <li> I have used Vanicream in the jar and Vanicream lite lotion for years and love them, my lack of skin reaction and the moisturizing is very effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I decided to try Vaniply as a winter moisturizer, and it&#x27;s just awful for me.  I had increasingly severe itching and feeling of skin tightness each of the few days I used it, and they went away as soon as I stopped.  In my experience, this occurs with products that lower cortisol levels in the body, (Aquaphor healing ointment is another example, the bisabolol added to it promotes itching, but not Aquaphor original, which does not have this ingredient) gives me a reaction very similar to what happened with Vaniply.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bad feel going on, not smooth or soothing.  My first disappointment from an otherwise excellent and helpful line of products.</li>
    <li> It works great for ezma</li>
    <li> I highly recommend Vaniply for anti-friction and anti-chaffing for distance running and endurance sports.  It does not break down or wipe off over many hours after application, even when wet or sweaty.  The 13 oz option is a great value.</li>
    <li> This has been a great alternative to aquaphor. Our son has sever eczema and we were constantly buying aquaphor until our pediatric dermatologist suggested this since it eliminates all possible allergens. It has been wonderful and it doesn&#x27;t seep into his clothes the way aquaphor did. :)</li>
    <li> We use it on our infant twins skin to prevent dry skin and treat minor rashes. It also works well on my lips and around my eyes. Very gentle, lasts a long time, incredibly moisturizing, and no fragrance.</li>
    <li> The product arrived in good time and was exactly what I ordered.  However, one of the three containers had a crack in the bottom and had leaked all over the rest of the shipment.  I originally thought that one of the lids wasn&#x27;t tight and didn&#x27;t realize there was a crack until I was well into the container.  At this point I figured it was too late for a return/credit even though I ended up losing at least a third of one container.  This is the one lotion that my pediatric dermatologist wants me to use for my two year old&#x27;s eczema so I will need to order it again.  Please package it better in the future!!</li>
    <li> Use the ointment when you need extra moisturizing, not greasy like Vaseline, even thought it looks like it could be.  Just be sure to rub it all in... The VaniCream is the same... No alcohol in it at all, great for psorisis!</li>
    <li> Excellent moisture ointment have extremely dry skin and worked very well for me skin  My skin now had a soft Dewey texture.</li>
    <li> Good, goes on well. I like because it&#x27;s clear and it is unscented, but am giving it 3 stars, because so far Aquaphor still does better job for me.</li>
    <li> A doctor recommended this ointment for my toddlers sensitive skin. When I used it, he broke out in hives. On my and other family members, it works well.</li>
    <li> I bicycle and have contact dermatitis.  Commercial chamois creams have ingredients that cause me to have allergic reactions.  This works great.  Good for other uses too.</li>
    <li> Vaniply is great for dry  skin, and for after being in the sun.  My only dislike is it takes awhile to absorb leaving me feel like I don&#x27;t want to sit on furniture or anything else where it might leave a spot.</li>
    <li> Great for people with Psoriasis!  It is a bit greasy but if you have really dry skin this will definitely help.</li>
    <li> B ought for a relative and they liked it.</li>
    <li> Having had eczema since I was 18 months old and I am 64 now, I know a thing or two about dry irritated skin.  This is a new product that does NOT irritate my incredibally sensitive skin.  I hardly recommend this for any one who has struggled with their skin and dryness.  I have had terrible experiences with other ointments/creams.  This one has truly been a wonder.  This ointment is heavy like vasooline.  I wear it at night and use the Vanicream during the day.&lt;br /&gt;GREAT PRODUCT.  Can&#x27;t say enough about how this helped me.</li>
    <li> This is way better than using petroleum jelly. I have severe eczema and have to be very careful with the products I use. This has no irritants and feels much less heavy and greasy than petroleum jelly products. I will definitely continue using it.</li>
    <li> I bought this to use for my back for eczema and it works really well to keep everything hydrated but it&#x27;s very sticky and takes forever to dry. It also didn&#x27;t stop the itching at all. I would say-if you&#x27;re a Vaseline user-this is great for everything you&#x27;d use Vaseline for, but it&#x27;s free of all the things that make Vaseline unhealthy. It&#x27;s been great for chapped skin and really good for elbows and knees. A little goes a long way and the tub is huge-it&#x27;s going to take me the rest of the year to go through this tub. Great value!</li>
    <li> This is listed as a lip ointment but is used all over the body.  It has helped my daughters eczema tremendously!! If you applied allover within 5 mins of getting out of the bath it seals in the moisture.  Must be consistent! It really makes a difference but you have to use is while the skin is moist to get the best results.</li>
    <li> My dermatologist gave me samples of several skin cream, lotions and ointments. Vaniply worked the best for the dry skin on my legs, arms and face.</li>
    <li> Recommended by my dermatologist</li>
    <li> Healed dry skin right away!!</li>
    <li> My dermatologist recommended the cream version of this and thought I&#x27;d try this.  It works great, even has a touch of a powdery feel to it so doesn&#x27;t feel quite as greasy as things like Vaseline.</li>
    <li> Perform well and delivered as indicated on line.</li>
    <li> Best thing I have found for my son&#x27;s eczema and I have tried many, many different products. I use the vanicream after a bath with the robathol bath oil and put this on top to really seal in the moisture. Really works well.</li>
