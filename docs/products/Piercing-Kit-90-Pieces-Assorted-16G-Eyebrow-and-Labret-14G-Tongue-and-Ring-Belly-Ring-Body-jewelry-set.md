      <li>Everything came like described but the only thing is that some over the balls would break very easily when wearing</li>
      <li>although you do get a very large quantity of them I wasn&#x27;t expecting 25 to 30 percent of them Patong Rings the belly button rings all of them to have a pot leaf on them</li>
      <li>Perfect for initial piercing and highly recommend these, same advertised designs and assortment and no problems with them so far!</li>

    <li> most of the balls have been breaking, I haven&#x27;t even used most of them</li>
    <li> Im really aggravated that my order contained 0 tongue barbells which was half the reason I purchased this set to begin with. Aside from that the quality of the other jewelry is decent. This is the only reason im giving two stars and of course I can find no way to contact the company. *sigh</li>
    <li> One piece of my jewelry split in half. Other then that it&#x27;s a good price, and they got here on time.</li>
    <li> They only came with tongue and belly rings. No other assorted piercings. The tongue rings are longer than standard tongue rings. Pretty disappointing.</li>
    <li> Way too many pot leaf tongue and belly button rings. But for the most part love them</li>
    <li> i bought it and actually like it different color and varieties.goo quality for the price.will recommend.if you like color than you gonna love it.</li>
    <li> Everything came like described but the only thing is that some over the balls would break very easily when wearing</li>
    <li> Great got everything it says on time neatly packaged</li>
    <li> Perfect for initial piercing and highly recommend these, same advertised designs and assortment and no problems with them so far! I usually have a reaction to any kind of jewelry that isn&#x27;t gold but these are just as valuable and are the only body jewelry I wear c:</li>
    <li> Not terrible quality for the price.</li>
    <li> Exactly what i wanted.</li>
    <li> I was feeling a little up in the air about these. The reason why is the amount for the price, but it worked out. The way they look in the picture is the way they look when you get them.</li>
    <li> The balls were pretty small and the bigger ones were hard to get onto the piercing itself. It was a frustrating time.</li>
    <li> I Like the variety of the piercings you get and the colors. They do feel cheap, however they are worth the price instead of paying 10 dollars for 1 single ring at the mall . Whole set of 90 for 11 bucks? I&#x27;m happy!</li>
    <li> Didnt get the eyebrow rings</li>
    <li> although you do get a very large quantity of them I wasn&#x27;t expecting 25 to 30 percent of them Patong Rings the belly button rings all of them to have a pot leaf on them ones I can&#x27;t even wear I do have children and this should have been listed in the description thank goodness I wasn&#x27;t buying them for someone that&#x27;s younger</li>
