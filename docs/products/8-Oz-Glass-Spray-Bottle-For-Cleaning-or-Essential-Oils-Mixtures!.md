    <li> Sometimes the trigger is a little testy. Solid look and feel. It works, just not sure how long... We use this in our child care for cleaning with a little bleach and water solution.</li>
    <li> I WANTED TO SPRAY OLIVE OIL, THIS WOULD NOT DO THAT</li>
    <li> Perfect size for essential oil mixtures!</li>
    <li> good product for the price.</li>
    <li> Really like for my &amp;#34;citrus&amp;#34; doTERRA essential oils!</li>
    <li> I used this bottle to mix a spray to freshen my mattress cover.  It worked great but I should have gotten a bigger bottle.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not easy finding these glass bottles ! I could not find them in the neighborhood stored. Realy nice quality. Love using them for my natural cleaning  for my home.</li>
    <li> Sprayer head didn&#x27;t spray.  Dribbled and misted a bit but no... fffttttt spray. Like it got clogged maybe.  Glass bottle fine.</li>
    <li> If you are looking for a glass bottle to dispense lite oils in a mist, the nozzle that comes with tis bottle does not mist . Both settings dispense a solid stream.</li>
    <li> After receiving this I tried it out and the trigger was hard to pull back. Some days were easier and then it quit pulling altogether. Luckily the bottle neck is standard size and I was able to replace the sprayer with a dollar store one.</li>
    <li> For cloth wipes solution.</li>
    <li> Great Seller! Recommended!</li>
    <li> Excellent service!  Just what I needed.</li>
    <li> I love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a really good size for putting in my leave in conditioner, so all i have to do is spray it into my hair after my shower: big enough that I don&#x27;t empty the bottle within a few uses, but small enough that it is not too cumbersome or heavy to use. I also store my mixture of coconut oil and lavender oil to seal in moisture after I apply the leave in conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The nozzle has not stopped working, as some people have stated; however, I took one star off for it being ridiculously over-priced. This company/seller has a website that sells this exact product for less money, but just to be safe, I still chose to order it on amazon for the A to Z guarantee.</li>
    <li> Works great! Make sure you cut the long spray tube. If you leave it long it effects the spraying.</li>
    <li> I pour the magnesium to share with the rest of the family</li>
    <li> Love using this with my essential oils to make homemade cleaner!</li>
    <li> Filled with my essential oil blend and water, this bottle works perfectly for cleaning.</li>
    <li> Bought this to use as our portable sprayer for baby wipe solution.  First use the top unscrewed itself and left a big mess.  Second time put in a plastic bag and really tightened down the trigger, nope still came loose.  After giving up, while cleaning it, the trigger just fell apart completely and just threw it away and not worth the headache to put it back together.  kept the glass bottle and found another trigger that fit and using that now.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t love this spray bottle because it does more of a stream and not a mist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use it for diluting essential oils in another oil to put on my body. I have to be careful that it doesn&#x27;t splash everywhere.</li>
    <li> works good high quality</li>
    <li> Spray is not adjustable and is more forceful than I would like, but quality of product is nice.</li>
    <li> Bought 2 of these, the sprayer clogs and does not work even after cleaning with hot water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update to my post.  I contacted seller who said they received a bad batch of sprayers, was sent new one&#x27;s and so far work great.</li>
    <li> Great for homemade essential oil cleaning  supplies</li>
    <li> Perfect for my essential oil cleanser that I use in the kitchen.</li>
    <li> the spray nozzle broke on my first use. disappointing. bottle is great though. I hope I can get a replacement spay nozzle that works.</li>
    <li> Just what I was looking for!!!</li>
