      <li>Its a sweet smell that makes you feel nice :P</li>
      <li>I also love how it comes with it&#x27;s own holder.  </li>
      <li>These were the best buy I could find, they smell great, and come with a small ceramic holder.</li>
      <li>I find these are pleasant not to smokey and just the right level of scent.</li>
      <li>I have always enjoyed incense.  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t love this one</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll probably never find out if they improve my health, but they sure make my house smell better. :)</li>
      <li>I purchased these because I read so many favorable reviews.</li>
      <li>I love this scent of incense.  </li>
      <li>They smell great in the box, but they have a very smoky smell when burned.</li>
      <li>I will definately be trying out more</li>
      <li>For more of a comparison I made video review.</li>
      <li>if/when i buy again though, i&#x27;ll probably buy the 200ct package because it&#x27;s a better deal.</li>
      <li>better quality than most of the incense I have purchased, it is not as smoky, not an overpowering smell, but strong, it lasts as it states, about 20 min, but for some reason incense gives me a headache, regardless of brand;</li>
      <li>It smells nice and makes me feel calm.</li>
      <li>There are much better ones available.</li>
      <li>It smells very good when you first open it, but upon burning the incense, it smells a lot like wood burning more than the fragrance itself.  </li>
      <li>Nippon Kodo is a great brand, and this Morning Star variety is a fine example of quality traditional incense.</li>
      <li>They also didn&#x27;t fit well in my burner (a stand, not the coffin style) - in fact, because there is no wood in them, they kept breaking as I tried to fit them in the hole.</li>
      <li>I do enjoy the scent though while they are burning.</li>
      <li>Excellent - very natural - small sticks burn fast, but it is so good that I&#x27;ve ordered more.</li>
      <li>Yes, that appears to be true, as my box says the same thing, but the incense is still good quality.    </li>
      <li>Other than that I am happy with the incense itself.</li>
      <li>like the title said, it smells pretty fantastic.</li>
      <li>It smells so nice and has a cute little stand with it.</li>
      <li>The scent is clean and real, but not overpowering.</li>
      <li>/&gt;The aroma was clear and strong.</li>
      <li>I am not sure it is healthy to breathe in very cheap incense.</li>
      <li>i bought this as my first foray into incense because, 1) it was inexpensive, and 2) it included a stand</li>
      <li>Just wish it was more traditional, meaning on a handle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>incense will smell lovely when burned and the next day you will notice a bit of lingering freshness.  </li>
      <li>Smells great and burns slowly.</li>
      <li>the perfume of one burning is more than enough to fill my bedroom.  </li>
      <li>Not only did they smell slightly more of burning naterial thatn the scents themselves but the smell disappeared as soon as the stick stopped burning.</li>
      <li>and it really does!  </li>
      <li>I bought this several months ago and though initially upon lighting the stick, it has a pleasant smell, I discovered that the predominant smell is burning wood, or as one review put it, smoky.</li>
      <li>They seem to be sticks of pure incense, so no wood smell of the stick burning to interfere with the scent of the incense.</li>
      <li>I find it superior to the common cheap stuff you get locally.    </li>
      <li>Very calming.&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t smell them much longer after they are burnt out.</li>
      <li>so i wouldn&#x27;t have to buy one and invest too much money.    </li>
      <li>but Iris really appeals to me) and</li>
      <li>This took much longer to arrive than stated.</li>
      <li>This is a good smelling somewhat sweet incense but not perfumery and fake.</li>
      <li>it certainly helps to cover up the way your place normally smells.</li>
      <li>Dont let the small size fool you, these are just as effective as the normal &#x27;batter dipped sticks&#x27; type of incense.</li>
      <li>Not as nice as Musk or Yuzu in my opinion, but much more subtle than some of the sharp &amp;#34;car freshener&amp;#34; varieties.</li>
      <li>The incense doe not have the typical bamboo stick running through the center but will still easily fit in most incense burners.</li>
      <li>The fragrance is fine but these just don&#x27;t have the impact of other brands like Gonesh.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a pleasant traditional scent, but it does not overpower the room nor is it usually smoky (I have run across a few smoky ones in the box, but those are rare).</li>
      <li>It came with a free little ceramic incense holder about the side of a nickle.</li>
      <li>I was surprised.</li>
      <li>It burns for about twenty minutes, which is a good since it fills the room and trickles into the rest of the house without being disturbing.</li>
      <li>great incense but too short burn time and its a very thin bar of product with no stick for stability</li>
      <li>For serious, I love this incense.</li>
      <li>These are *much* smaller than I expected, but they also come with their own little stand to hold the sticks while they burn.  </li>
      <li>Not a single stick was intact.  </li>
      <li>Also, that small little box contains 50 sticks, an outstanding deal.</li>

<li> They don&#x27;t last long</li>
<li> I do suggest burning a half stick if you&#x27;re gonna be in a small room, because dang, its powerful.</li>
<li> However, what makes this worth it is that it is small; a little over four inches.</li>

<li> The odor doesn&#x27;t last as long as other incense I burn.</li>
<li> i&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s my nose acclimating to the smell, or just the perfume dissipating with the smoke, but the sandalwood smell doesn&#x27;t linger very long after the incense is through burning.  </li>
<li> Advertised as burning for a half hour</li>
<li> that it comes with a little porcelein holder.</li>
<li> They include a little thing that you can burn it on.&lt;br</li>
<li> Maybe it was just my order that this happened to, but i was a little disapointed.</li>
<li> Green Tea scents as well.</li>
<li> When I opened the envelope that the incense came in, I found the box open and broken sticks of incense.</li>
<li> A few hours after burning, it does retain the fragrance in a small room without the wood smell, so I&#x27;ll give it 4 stars.  </li>
<li> Its small size is convenient if you&#x27;re on the go.</li>
<li> They are small and evenly sized from end to end.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s less irritating to the senses.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
<li> It was hard to trim them at an angle.</li>
<li> The order was also delivered late and since this was a gift, I had no choice but to give it away since I received it the night before I needed it.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I buy stick incense all the time but have never seen any like this. They are small and evenly sized from end to end. No wood stick sticking out. It came with a free little ceramic incense holder about the side of a nickle. Smells great and burns slowly. Great buy i must say.</li>
    <li> i bought this as my first foray into incense because, 1) it was inexpensive, and 2) it included a stand so i wouldn&#x27;t have to buy one and invest too much money.    simply, it lives up to its expectations.    it burns as advertised for 25min; all incense and no stick.  it smells nicely like sandalwood and not too smoky when burning, doing so without being overly spicy.  the perfume of one burning is more than enough to fill my bedroom.  i&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s my nose acclimating to the smell, or just the perfume dissipating with the smoke, but the sandalwood smell doesn&#x27;t linger very long after the incense is through burning.  if/when i buy again though, i&#x27;ll probably buy the 200ct package because it&#x27;s a better deal.</li>
    <li> Dont let the small size fool you, these are just as effective as the normal &#x27;batter dipped sticks&#x27; type of incense. They seem to be sticks of pure incense, so no wood smell of the stick burning to interfere with the scent of the incense. And the scent of the morning star sandalwood is very good. Also, that small little box contains 50 sticks, an outstanding deal. 5/5 stars.</li>
    <li> Advertised as burning for a half hour and it really does!  Smells great.  Excellent value.  Will definitely order Morning Star incense again.</li>
    <li> The incense itself is good.   The holder is a litter bit big to hold the incense.</li>
    <li> The sandelwood is very nice and I like that it comes with a little porcelein holder.</li>
    <li> I have always enjoyed incense.  Just wish it was more traditional, meaning on a handle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The aroma was clear and strong.</li>
    <li> I purchased these because I read so many favorable reviews. I disagree with some of what&#x27;s been said. They smell great in the box, but they have a very smoky smell when burned. The odor doesn&#x27;t last as long as other incense I burn. They also didn&#x27;t fit well in my burner (a stand, not the coffin style) - in fact, because there is no wood in them, they kept breaking as I tried to fit them in the hole. It was hard to trim them at an angle.</li>
    <li> This are mini incense sticks and they burn for about 5 minutes. The fragrance is fine but these just don&#x27;t have the impact of other brands like Gonesh.</li>
    <li> I chose this product because it specifically listed Japan as the country of origin.  When I received it, there was a sticker that was conveniently placed over the \\&quot;Made in Hong Kong\\&quot; text.    The order was also delivered late and since this was a gift, I had no choice but to give it away since I received it the night before I needed it.  If I had a choice, I would have returned it.    If you want real Japanese incense that is made in Japan, do not order these!</li>
    <li> great incense but too short burn time and its a very thin bar of product with no stick for stability</li>
    <li> Excellent - very natural - small sticks burn fast, but it is so good that I&#x27;ve ordered more.</li>
    <li> It smells so nice and has a cute little stand with it. Its a sweet smell that makes you feel nice :P</li>
    <li> There are much better ones available. Not only did they smell slightly more of burning naterial thatn the scents themselves but the smell disappeared as soon as the stick stopped burning. Meh.</li>
    <li> I bought this several months ago and though initially upon lighting the stick, it has a pleasant smell, I discovered that the predominant smell is burning wood, or as one review put it, smoky. I am not sure it is healthy to breathe in very cheap incense.</li>
    <li> Stickless incense is nice. It&#x27;s less irritating to the senses.&lt;br /&gt;This incense will smell lovely when burned and the next day you will notice a bit of lingering freshness.  Very calming.&lt;br /&gt;Also they sent a bonus stick incense. Lagniappe!</li>
    <li> They arrived crumbled.  Not a single stick was intact.  None of the pieces are big enough to burn.  The pieces are now serving as sachet ingredients.</li>
    <li> like the title said, it smells pretty fantastic. I do suggest burning a half stick if you&#x27;re gonna be in a small room, because dang, its powerful. it certainly helps to cover up the way your place normally smells.</li>
    <li> Sometimes incense can be a little smokey or too smelly, particularly sandalwood. I find these are pleasant not to smokey and just the right level of scent.</li>
    <li> When I opened the envelope that the incense came in, I found the box open and broken sticks of incense. Maybe it was just my order that this happened to, but i was a little disapointed. Other than that I am happy with the incense itself. It smells nice and makes me feel calm. I will definately be trying out more Morning Star incense in the future, but I hope it doesn&#x27;t get messed up in the post again.</li>
    <li> This took much longer to arrive than stated. The incense itself is very good.</li>
    <li> I love this scent of incense.  This is the best quality incense I have used.  Lasts as long as it says it is supposed to (25 mins). I also love how it comes with it&#x27;s own holder.  GREAT BUY!!!</li>
    <li> better quality than most of the incense I have purchased, it is not as smoky, not an overpowering smell, but strong, it lasts as it states, about 20 min, but for some reason incense gives me a headache, regardless of brand;</li>
    <li> I bought these after reading an article in Time Magazine where the author states he has compiled scientific evidence that indicates burning Sandalwood incense produces health benefits. These were the best buy I could find, they smell great, and come with a small ceramic holder. I&#x27;ll probably never find out if they improve my health, but they sure make my house smell better. :)</li>
    <li> For serious, I love this incense. I open the box and I can smell the sandalwood. It&#x27;s a pleasant traditional scent, but it does not overpower the room nor is it usually smoky (I have run across a few smoky ones in the box, but those are rare). However, what makes this worth it is that it is small; a little over four inches. It burns for about twenty minutes, which is a good since it fills the room and trickles into the rest of the house without being disturbing. This is not your sandy batter dipped incense sticks, this is the stuff you want to get. The price is affordable. The scent is clean and real, but not overpowering. It lacks the stereotypical smokiness. Its small size is convenient if you&#x27;re on the go. The burn time is great considering its size also. This is THE incense. I also would recommend Iris (I&#x27;m not big on floral scents but Iris really appeals to me) and Green Tea scents as well.</li>
    <li> I do like these a lot! They don&#x27;t last long but I read that before I purchased them and they are only about 5 inches long. I don&#x27;t smell them much longer after they are burnt out. I do enjoy the scent though while they are burning. I will continue to purchase this brand.</li>
    <li> I love these incense! These are awesome but they produce a heck of a lot of smoke so i guess if you&#x27;re burning it in a room you&#x27;re not sitting in, it&#x27;s not so bad. The smell is wonderful for sandalwood lovers.</li>
    <li> solid basic sandalwood incense choice</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t smell like sandalwood from the 70&#x27;s</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t love this one but I don&#x27;t hate it either. Morning star line is unremarkable. If you want a good sandalwood from Nippon Kodo buy the Viva sandalwood.</li>
    <li> These are *much* smaller than I expected, but they also come with their own little stand to hold the sticks while they burn.  I&#x27;ll say that breaks even and give them 5 stars, because they smell great (not too overpowering).</li>
    <li> Sandalwood is just another one of my favorite smells and this is very nice incense.  I definitely recommend the Morning Star Sandalwood.  Great price, too.</li>
    <li> Nippon Kodo is a great brand, and this Morning Star variety is a fine example of quality traditional incense. Not as nice as Musk or Yuzu in my opinion, but much more subtle than some of the sharp &amp;#34;car freshener&amp;#34; varieties.</li>
    <li> They include a little thing that you can burn it on.&lt;br /&gt;It smells nice.&lt;br /&gt;You get what you pay for, in a good way.</li>
    <li> This is a good smelling somewhat sweet incense but not perfumery and fake. As I read the review I noticed one person complained that the product was made in Hong Kong. Yes, that appears to be true, as my box says the same thing, but the incense is still good quality.    The incense doe not have the typical bamboo stick running through the center but will still easily fit in most incense burners. Because it is sold incense with no stick you may find it is easier  to accidentally break.    I was over all impressed and satisfied with my purchase. I like the smell. I find it superior to the common cheap stuff you get locally.    For more of a comparison I made video review. The manufacturer claims it will burn 25 minutes - so I put it to the test in this video:  http://youtu.be/UFueGAoVyIo. I was surprised.</li>
    <li> It smells very good when you first open it, but upon burning the incense, it smells a lot like wood burning more than the fragrance itself.  A few hours after burning, it does retain the fragrance in a small room without the wood smell, so I&#x27;ll give it 4 stars.  Burns at a good rate for a 5 in. stick.</li>
    <li> Will not be purchasing again. The sandalwood scent was gone by the time I was halfway through the box.</li>
