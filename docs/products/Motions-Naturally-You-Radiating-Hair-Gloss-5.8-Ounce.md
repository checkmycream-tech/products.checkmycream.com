      <li>You Hair Gloss adds a nice, pleasing shine to hair.</li>
      <li>It isn&#x27;t the best product of its kind, according to my wife, but it is good enough to recommend.</li>
      <li>This ia also great for quick touch-ups for people on the go.</li>
      <li>In order to compete with Frizz-Ease or Paul Mitchell, they have to resort to the controversial \\&quot;Cones\\&quot; - any ingredient ending with the suffixe &#x27;cone:  </li>
      <li>The products like this with &#x27;Cone ingredients are controversial among haircare professionals because they contain some drying ingredients and they work by coating the hair rather than conditioning it.  </li>
      <li>Since I LOVE  </li>
      <li>This provide to lovely sheen for your hair.</li>
      <li>It will make it more manageable .</li>
      <li>She wears her hair in a pony tail most of the time.  </li>
      <li>have found the best way to use the various oils is to apply them to may hair after the shower.</li>
      <li>They don&#x27;t necessarily love the gloss, but they don&#x27;t complain either.</li>
      <li>You know I love you and many of your products</li>
      <li>I acknowledge it doesn&#x27;t work for most others.</li>
      <li>i bought this for my weaves and wigs and its ok.</li>
      <li>This hair gloss like most of the others products</li>
      <li>suspect there are probably better products out there,</li>
      <li>but I was satisfied with this hair gloss.</li>
      <li>The oil was really light and was smoothed into my damp hair very easily.</li>
      <li>But I do live in a house full of women who can use a product to help keep their wavy locks looking beautiful.</li>
      <li>/&gt;So, in summary, this product appears to be a good one for accomplishing one main goal and it does earn a recommendation for that reason alone.</li>
      <li>Also great to put in your hair before a swim so the chlorine will not dry out your hair.</li>
      <li>That is a huge amount.</li>
      <li>It was lightly floral.</li>
      <li>I like the light, silky feel of this product.</li>
      <li>This oil sheen has some great ingredients and will make your hair soft shiny and frizz free basically it will look glossy and healthy just dont use too much.</li>
      <li>You need some length to get this right and your fingers need to be able to glide through your hair.  </li>
      <li>The Motions natural hair line is very reasonable and for the most part good products.</li>
      <li>Also great to use while flat ironing.</li>
      <li>Thenthe heaviness of the gloss is about twice that of the original John Frieda Frizz-Ease</li>
      <li>is about twice that of the original John Frieda Frizz-Ease</li>
      <li>is worth buying!</li>
      <li>great friend for a long time</li>
      <li>My hair is kind of fine and has a natural curl</li>
      <li>They do not want any frizz and this product from Motions is specially formulated to control this problem.</li>
      <li>the price is good and it last me for a while.</li>
      <li>Paul Mitchell Super Skinny Serum Unisex, 8.5 Ounce]].  </li>
      <li>I use this product after everything I wash my hair or if my hair needs a quick shine pick-me-up.</li>
      <li>buy 2 get 1 free at Ulta or when I find a  better price here on Amazon which happens frequently.  </li>
      <li>buy 2 get 1 free at Ulta or when I find a  better price here on Amazon which happens frequently.  </li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t try this as a quick fix before leaving home or you&#x27;ll regret it.</li>
      <li>/&gt;I wasn&#x27;t thrilled to find a major ingredient to be denatured</li>
      <li>It smells nice and leaves a decent sheen to the hair for a good half of a day.  </li>
      <li>think this is OK for a quick touch up at the gym,but like a famous palm oil brand better for deep treatments that last &amp; keep hair strong.</li>
      <li>You have to have a light hand on this kind of product--use a small bead about the size of a pea, then add more if needed (my hair is medium/short).</li>
      <li>Its always nice when a new product comes out that is reasonably priced.</li>
      <li>When my hair was dry it had a nice shine to it and felt really smooth.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Motions Naturally You Radiating Gloss does what it says it will do if applied very lightly.  </li>
      <li>Ive had some success with their products.</li>
      <li>The Motions Naturally You is sold at Target as well, and has affordable hair products that are okay.</li>
      <li>I can honestly say that I will not be buying these products anytime in the future.</li>
      <li>As far as performance on my hair, it was okay,</li>
      <li>I love that this gloss moisturizes and tames my natural hair as well as my hair extentions.</li>
      <li>This is great for dull hair, damaged from the sun.</li>
      <li>Because my hair is so fine, I could easily get away with a partial to one pump of the gloss.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>The first thing that got me was the instructions say use two to three pumps.</li>
      <li>and that is just enough to make it look really healthy and shinny but not oily and</li>
      <li>But for me, I will definitely be buying more of this</li>
      <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wanted very much to love this Glosser since I appreciate Motions reaching out to larger groups of women with hair issues that don&#x27;t just effect African-Americans.  </li>
      <li>I might use it as a hot oil treatment but that was not suggested by the manufacturer.  </li>
      <li>And it&#x27;s got a pretty neutral fragrant.  </li>
      <li>I will try to add more to this review in the future if that becomes an issue.</li>
      <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wanted very much to love this Glosser since I appreciate Motions reaching out to larger groups of women with hair issues that don&#x27;t just effect African-Americans.  </li>
      <li>does exactly that, helping their hair keep the shape and look that</li>
      <li>As many of us reviewing Motions products before have said, these products CAN be sued by all hair types but in different amounts.  </li>
      <li>This product is too light to handle naturally curly hair.</li>
      <li>It absorbed much better on the dry ends.</li>
      <li>If you want to add a little shine to your hair then The Motions Naturally will work great for you.</li>
      <li>The radiating gloss is decent, although not as impressive as some of the other over-the-counter brands gloss or some of the other saloon</li>
      <li>If you put too much in, your hair will look pretty greasy.</li>
      <li>The foam was kind of watered down looking.  </li>
      <li>It tended to stay where it was applied, making it harder for me to get a good even coat of Frizz-control throughout the length of my hair which is essential if you are going to attempt a French Braid, a 4-Strand Braid or my favorite protective styling, the Crown Braid.</li>
      <li>I used two squirts as I have long hair and the top of my head just seemed really greasy.  </li>
      <li>I guess it would depend on your hair type, if your hair is dry and needs some flattening or has way too many stray hairs then this may work for you.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used this after a wash/blow dry and have been pleased with the results.</li>
      <li>This is a great product to use on any type hair rather you have a perm or natural ladies, I myself used it on my perm hair and its makes your hair so soft and silky to the touch not all weight down.</li>
      <li>I only wished that Motions&#x27; other products worked as successfully as these two did.</li>
      <li>and I choose to use the ones where I can get by with using as little as possible since the more you use, the more drying alcohols you are applying to your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I put the hair gloss on my hair and it glisten for about a minute and did like the was it glisten it looked I put to much grease in my hair gross</li>
    <li> is worth buying! it was a very \\&quot;heavy\\&quot; feeling gloss and left my hair looking wet and feeling greasy. i tried the MOTIONS pudding and that did the same thing. i would not recommend this product unless you want to look like you have wet hair all day!</li>
    <li> Has some great ingredients yet likely in very small quantities.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wasn&#x27;t thrilled to find a major ingredient to be denatured alcohol.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oily when put on hands but doesn&#x27;t stay that way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great for on the go, but I think for longer term,I want something that&#x27;s going to have long-term health effects on my scalp &amp; hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think this is OK for a quick touch up at the gym,but like a famous palm oil brand better for deep treatments that last &amp; keep hair strong.</li>
    <li> The product itself is good which is why I gave it three stars. The problem is that by the time I got it, half the product had wasted into the packaging. Aside from the fact that I lost money,......It was a mess!!! It needs a cap or some type of stopper. Not a product you should purchase online!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried products touted by serious hair gurus.  Never works for me.  This one does, like crazy.  Two dollops, not large ones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product makes me grateful.  Finally, something works.  And it&#x27;s got a pretty neutral fragrant.  I acknowledge it doesn&#x27;t work for most others.</li>
    <li> I really like this product.  I was using moroccan hair oil before this which I really liked but this seems even lighter.  One full pump is a little too much for me (I have shorter hair) so I use about half a pump and that is just enough to make it look really healthy and shinny but not oily and that is perfect for me.</li>
    <li> I have used several products in this Motions line. This hair gloss like most of the others products a little goes a long way. I also think it might not be the best thing for fine/thin hair. This oil sheen has some great ingredients and will make your hair soft shiny and frizz free basically it will look glossy and healthy just dont use too much.</li>
    <li> I got this for my girlfriend to use. Here is her review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have very long, fine, formerly bleached hair. Basically, this means that the ends, from my ears down, get really dry and snarl very easily. I have been looking for some oils to help treat this, thus why I decided to try this Radiating Gloss. I don&#x27;t flatten, treat, or even bleach my hair anymore. I&#x27;m just trying to work on the current damage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have found the best way to use the various oils is to apply them to may hair after the shower. That way the oils lock in the moisture. The first thing that got me was the instructions say use two to three pumps. YIKES! That is a huge amount. Because my hair is so fine, I could easily get away with a partial to one pump of the gloss.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I loved the smell. It was lightly floral. The oil was really light and was smoothed into my damp hair very easily. When my hair was dry it had a nice shine to it and felt really smooth. I admit that the first time I used this gloss I got a little too much on and it made my hair look greasy. But once I figured out to use less, my hair just shines.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know that this product is more for those that style their hair all the time, but for me it worked perfectly. I know that depending on your hair types and what is done to it, there is a possibility of it making the hair look greasy or not working at all. But for me, I will definitely be buying more of this gloss.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shawn Kovacich&lt;br /&gt;Author and Creator of numerous books and DVD&#x27;s.</li>
    <li> I have very naturally curly hair which is difficult to tame down.  It is easiest to wear it natural though and so often I don&#x27;t want to fuss with straightening it.  This is a nice product for both the health of your hair and it gets rid of that frizzy look.  It gives your curls a soft definition and a pretty shine.  The scent is nice too.  You can&#x27;t go wrong with this product.</li>
    <li> Daverat&#x27;s Wife speaking (please be kind about typos, I have arthritis) As many of us reviewing Motions products before have said, these products CAN be sued by all hair types but in different amounts.  The  tighter your curls and thicker your hair, the more Motions products will usually work for you.  I adore some of their products and buy them faithfully.  I have thick, waist length naturall wavy hair that tends towards breakage.  I do not chemically straighten my hair nor do I use Brazillian Blow-outs.  The only things I use are glossing treatments and hair oils.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This new product from Motions is an attempt to formulate a Glossing Serum for what I call \\&quot;Ethnic Hair\\&quot; like mine, not necessarily African-American hair but hair that is genetically trending towards waves, forms twists or curls on its own, tends to be fragile and suffers from breakage.  In order to compete with Frizz-Ease or Paul Mitchell, they have to resort to the controversial \\&quot;Cones\\&quot; - any ingredient ending with the suffixe &#x27;cone:  Things like Dimethicone in its various forms.  Just like the other products mentioned, those are what Motions relies upon to help form that frizz taming, hair sfat coating, slippery gloss treament that helps you run a comb through thick or curly hair without frizzing it into an afro.  The &#x27;cones also help lock in what moisture you have and keep out atmospheric moisture.  Yes, there are products out there that Gloss without the &#x27;cones but this is not one of them so I will only compare it to similar products laden with &#x27;cones.  The products like this with &#x27;Cone ingredients are controversial among haircare professionals because they contain some drying ingredients and they work by coating the hair rather than conditioning it.  To me, they are a necessary evil and I choose to use the ones where I can get by with using as little as possible since the more you use, the more drying alcohols you are applying to your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Motions Naturally You Radiating Gloss does what it says it will do if applied very lightly.  it is a product laden with &#x27;cones but that is currently the easiest way to gloss hair and lay down frizz quickly. I had no trouble getting it to help tamp down my frizz, smooth my style into place and help seal my ends after a blow-out.  Some people use this both before and after heat application but I prefer to use naytral hair oils before heat.  The things is, compared to my usual Frizz Serum, the Motions brand was much heavier on my hair, even in smaller amounts and it did not bursh through my hair as well.  It tended to stay where it was applied, making it harder for me to get a good even coat of Frizz-control throughout the length of my hair which is essential if you are going to attempt a French Braid, a 4-Strand Braid or my favorite protective styling, the Crown Braid. It&#x27;s a french braid in the round that looks like a tiara braided into your hair.  You need some length to get this right and your fingers need to be able to glide through your hair.  A gloss serum is essential.  I couldn&#x27;t acchieve any complicated braids with Motions Gloss because even for me, Madam Thirsty hair, the stuff was too heavy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the Gloss well enough to use it sparingly if I&#x27;m rocking a wrapped pony tail since it does help me tamp down the breakage at my hair line around my head  and smooth the Pony but it will never replace my fave Glosser Sereum which is much more expensive but worth every penny since it is lightweight and a tiny amount gets the job done.  That would be: [[ASIN:B000VNIZGM Paul Mitchell Super Skinny Serum Unisex, 8.5 Ounce]].  I like the bright apple scent of Paul Mitchell&#x27;s serum better than the vaguely industrial odor of the Naturally You Gloss and I much prefer the overall performance.  Sorry Motions!  You know I love you and many of your products but this one needs reformulation.  If I can smell the polymers, acetates and alchol based ingredients in the product, I&#x27;m already turned off.  Thenthe heaviness of the gloss is about twice that of the original John Frieda Frizz-Ease and that&#x27;s saying somethiong since Frizz Ease is heavy indeed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wanted very much to love this Glosser since I appreciate Motions reaching out to larger groups of women with hair issues that don&#x27;t just effect African-Americans.  In this case, I simply feel they need to reformulate a little.  If you want a reliable Gloss Serum that won&#x27;t weigh your hair down and will really help even the frizziest hair, I say go with the Paul Mitchell Super Skinny Serum.  I wait and buy it when it&#x27;s buy 2 get 1 free at Ulta or when I find a  better price here on Amazon which happens frequently.  1 Bottle lasts a LONG time.the heaviness of the gloss is about twice that of the original John Frieda Frizz-Ease and that&#x27;s saying somethiong since Frizz Ease is heavy indeed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wanted very much to love this Glosser since I appreciate Motions reaching out to larger groups of women with hair issues that don&#x27;t just effect African-Americans.

    <li> The Motions Naturally You Radiating Hair Gloss is just what I needed to maintain my hair in the South Florida Humidity. This hair gloss is nice and will have your hair smoothed out without the frizzies, but be careful because a little goes a long way and if you make the mistake of using too much(I did!) of the Hair gloss then it weighs your hair down and makes it look really greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This bottle will last you a long time because you only need a drop and this will help manage the fly-a-ways and the frizzy hair. I like that the Motions Naturally You Radiating Hair Gloss that contains coconut oil, shea butter, and avocado oil has helped my hair from breaking and really minimalized my split ends. I love that this gloss moisturizes and tames my natural hair as well as my hair extentions.</li>
    <li> I like the Motions Naturally You Radiating Hair Gloss. This provide to lovely sheen for your hair. This product also keeps hair soft and moisturized. This ia also great for quick touch-ups for people on the go. This is not greasy. You can run your fingers through hair without a handful of oil. Great product.</li>
    <li> Sprayed this Radiating Hair Gloss into my palm and it just kind of sat there all flat without the full foaming bubbles I expected.  The foam was kind of watered down looking.  I used two squirts as I have long hair and the top of my head just seemed really greasy.  It absorbed much better on the dry ends. I might use it as a hot oil treatment but that was not suggested by the manufacturer.  Don&#x27;t try this as a quick fix before leaving home or you&#x27;ll regret it.</li>
    <li> Motions Radiating Hair Gloss is decent but it&#x27;s just like other glosses I&#x27;ve used.  It smells nice and leaves a decent sheen to the hair for a good half of a day.  What I don&#x27;t like about it, as well as other glosses, it the slick feel it leaves to the hair.</li>
    <li> I like the light, silky feel of this product. Serums that reduce frizz are often kind of &#x27;heavy&#x27; and weigh the hair down. I&#x27;ve used this after a wash/blow dry and have been pleased with the results. You have to have a light hand on this kind of product--use a small bead about the size of a pea, then add more if needed (my hair is medium/short). The Motions Naturally You Hair Gloss adds a nice, pleasing shine to hair. Would definitely recommend. I&#x27;ve used several of these products from this line and have been pleasantly surprised with how they do not weigh my hair down overnight and require me to have to shampoo the next day. My hair is color-treated and I try to take very good care of it. This is one of the nicest products I&#x27;ve found in awhile for gloss and control. Would definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> Since I LOVE  [[ASIN:B0072XT8BA Motions Naturally You, Hydrate My Curls Pudding 8 Ounce]], I had high hopes for this product, but it feels very similar to all the other \\&quot;glosses\\&quot; out there- and I feel like I&#x27;ve tried them all!!! Too slick, feels like straight up silicone, the \\&quot;gloss\\&quot; didn&#x27;t stay but the chemical texture did. Hard to wash out, and not a product I will continue to use. The Hair Pudding, though, is a miracle - one of my new all time hair product favorites, and one I would choose against much more expensive brands.</li>
    <li> I have short, straight hair and in no way do I need any type of hair styling gel, oil, or anything else. But I do live in a house full of women who can use a product to help keep their wavy locks looking beautiful. This hair gloss from motions does exactly that, helping their hair keep the shape and look that they like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Among the hair complaints from the women on my house, having their hair frizz is number one. I often point out that this was the standard back in the 1980&#x27;s and they should consider it a fashion statement, but they are not amused. They do not want any frizz and this product from Motions is specially formulated to control this problem. They apply just a small amount and then finish styling their hair. It keeps hair in its present form so that there is no chance for frizzing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product, as expected, does add some gloss to the hair and that seems to be fine with the ladies in my home. They don&#x27;t necessarily love the gloss, but they don&#x27;t complain either. From what I gather, the main thing they want is frizz control and that is what they get with this product. They wash their hair, dry like usual, and then apply the gloss. The frizz is gone and doesn&#x27;t return for the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, in summary, this product appears to be a good one for accomplishing one main goal and it does earn a recommendation for that reason alone. It isn&#x27;t the best product of its kind, according to my wife, but it is good enough to recommend.</li>
    <li> This product is too light to handle naturally curly hair. I felt totally disappointed. I tried it on my flat ironed hair. I did notice some shine on my flat ironed hair. And it felt silky. I ordered this months ago and have only used it several times.</li>
    <li> Okay, this isn&#x27;t targetted at those of my gender or ethnicity, but I was curious to see if it did anything to shine my aging crop of hair.  It didn&#x27;t, but that&#x27;s not the product&#x27;s fault...LOL</li>
    <li> I got this for my wife so she could try it out.  She is always getting stuff for her hair, and she was intrigued by the product.  She said this product definitely makes her hair shiny.  She said it you put too much... it will make your hair oily... so she is careful with how much she uses.  The amount she found good to use... was about the size of a dime.  She uses this item every other day.  She said she would definitely buy it again.</li>
    <li> Awesome product. Makes your hair shiny and soft</li>
    <li> My wife is black, I am mixed...needless to say, my daughter has some fun hair to deal with. I constantly have to brush it to keep it from tangling into knots, if she takes a nap I have to brush her hair, and when she goes to sleep I brush it to minimize the mess of tangled knots that will be waiting for me in the morning. But, for some reason that I cannot fathom, this product has actually given me a slight break. I wonder if maybe it&#x27;s the grease that keeps it from tangling throughout the day...I have no clue why, but the main point is that it is working. Thank you Motions Naturally You, Radiating Hair Gloss.</li>
    <li> Motions Naturally You Radiating Hair Gloss shines up my curly hair without making it all icky and heavy. The curls stay curly and the tangles stay un-tangled. It helps my hair to look more like a Renaissance portrait and less like Little Orphan Annie.</li>
    <li> I tried this and it is just too oily for me and seems to flatten my natural waves. I guess it would depend on your hair type, if your hair is dry and needs some flattening or has way too many stray hairs then this may work for you. My hair is kind of fine and has a natural curl and it really is fairly good health so I don&#x27;t have a lot of fuzziness.</li>
    <li> This is a great product to use on any type hair rather you have a perm or natural ladies, I myself used it on my perm hair and its makes your hair so soft and silky to the touch not all weight down. You don&#x27;t have to use a lot to get the results you want. Just a small amount goes a long way, It smells nice to.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing a natural for quite a few months. Its always nice when a new product comes out that is reasonably priced. Most natural hair products are not reasonable, and tend to be expensive.  The Motions natural hair line is very reasonable and for the most part good products. Ive had some success with their products. Not so much with this product. The Motions hair gloss did in fact make your hair glossy.  Unfortunately, it tended to be oily and messy. Not a good look. I&#x27;m rating this product a generous two stars.</li>
    <li> i bought this for my weaves and wigs and its ok. the price is good and it last me for a while. wold definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> If you want to add a little shine to your hair then The Motions Naturally will work great for you. This bottle will go a long way. Motions products works best on ethnic hair. It will make it more manageable . This is great for dull hair, damaged from the sun. Also great to put in your hair before a swim so the chlorine will not dry out your hair. A little will go along way. Also great to use while flat ironing.</li>
    <li> I die my hair on regular basis and I always add reddish tone to it.  Recently I started using \\&quot;Motions\\&quot; brand hair products and I really like them.  Once a week, I use hair masque overnight on my hair and it gives it moisture and softness that lasts for a long time.  On daily basis, after I dry my hair I like to put a dash of gloss in my hair so it has shine. My hair is straight and adding some gloss to it adds new dimension to the reddish tones in it.  This is salon quality product that is very pleasing to use.  It has performance and fragrance to it that will make every woman happy.</li>
    <li> The Motions Naturally You is sold at Target as well, and has affordable hair products that are okay. The radiating gloss is decent, although not as impressive as some of the other over-the-counter brands gloss or some of the other saloon glosses I have tried in the past. For it&#x27;s price though, it does make your hair shinier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have thick dark hair sprinkled with gray and this hair gloss adds a brownish tint / shine to it. It doesn&#x27;t radiate, but does create a nice glow.</li>
    <li> I ordered several projects from the Motions hair line. Prior to the last order, I ordered their curl butter and another product and was totally dissatisfied. With that being said, the reviews on these other Motions products I ordered will probably be the same. I was totally disappointed that an entire line of hair products missed the mark. I can honestly say that I will not be buying these products anytime in the future. Not only did they do what they said they&#x27;d do, after the 1st hour or so, but the residue and build up in my hair, caused me to have to cut sections of my hair to get the residue and knots out of my hair. Out of the 9 products I tried there were only two that did anything for me and that was moisturizing cleanser and the deep conditioning hair masque. These were the only two products that did not tangle my hair and left it feeling soft and somewhat moisturized. I can actually run a comb or brush through it without pulling out plugs. I only wished that Motions&#x27; other products worked as successfully as these two did.</li>
    <li> I use this product after everything I wash my hair or if my hair needs a quick shine pick-me-up. Works great! Makes my hair look fuller and gives off an all-over glossy shine!</li>
    <li> Given to a friend , she was ecstatic ! The shine this produced for her hair was remarkable.&lt;br /&gt;She said that very little product goes a very long way , making this (and the rest of their line) a great value for the money.&lt;br /&gt;A great friend for a long time , I am so happy she was happy !</li>
    <li> My wife has long, dark, medium body hair. She likes using this product because she only has to use a very small amount to make her hair look shiny and healthy.</li>
    <li> I have long hair and enjoy swimming so my hair gets a lot of frizz. I hoped that the Motions Naturally You would reduce frizz. The product takes some getting used to in order to maximize performance, but I found that it was quite effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You have to use caution in order to make this stuff work. If you put too much in, your hair will look pretty greasy. Using just a little amount will give you the shine you desire.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I suspect there are probably better products out there, but I was satisfied with this hair gloss. Once you get used to it, it works quite well and it isn&#x27;t too expensive.</li>
    <li> I tried this hair gloss because it looked like it had good stuff in it, like Shea butter and coconut oil. My hair  has lots of body, so I like to use products that will help with control and frizz, and give it a little shine. This gloss seemed very greasy when I pumped it into my hand, but I tried it anyway. I used one pump, as I don&#x27;t want my hair to be greasy. I rubbed it in while my hair was damp, and later noticed a little extra sheen. When I washed my hands I had to re-soap several times in order to get the grease off my hands.</li>
    <li> This product was a little too greasy for my taste. Being as you have to dispense this product directly into your hands to place onto your hair, it was a bit messy for my taste. I would suggest they consider transitioning this into a spray bottle instead. The top wasn&#x27;t tightened at all when it was delivered causing me to spend twenty minutes cleaning up the \\&quot;gloss\\&quot; from other mail and the other product that I ordered with it. As far as performance on my hair, it was okay, I&#x27;ve used other products that served the same purpose and were more affective.</li>
    <li> I used this product on my daughter who is African American/White mix. She wears her hair in a pony tail most of the time.  I used this product to help keep down the frizz that starts to show up a couple of days after washing.  Although it has worked well over the first few times we have used it I am afraid that it will end up drying out her hair over prolonged use because it contains alcohol. We will see. I will try to add more to this review in the future if that becomes an issue.</li>
