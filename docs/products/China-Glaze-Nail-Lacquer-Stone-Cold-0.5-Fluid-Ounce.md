### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>This is a great color!  </li>
      <li>Surprisingly great pick of The Hunger Games series!</li>
      <li>/&gt;While a beautiful color, color isn&#x27;t everything.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ts gorgeous while it&#x27;s there</li>
      <li>I guess it&#x27;s good to have a varity of nail polishes</li>
      <li>I really loved it</li>
      <li>It looks good for a couple hours.</li>
      <li>However when I read some more about it, I was happy that I&#x27;d jumped the gun and bought it.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
      <li>Nice color and good cover.</li>
      <li>Love it!</li>
      <li>This is an amazing nail polish.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m going to have to put a glitter coat over this or sandwich it between Gelish layers to use it, which means it will lose it&#x27;s matte finish, which is kind of the point.</li>
      <li>I had to find out on my own.</li>
      <li>Unfortunately, a top coat will probably cost you the matte finish, but I suspect it looks good glossy, too.</li>
      <li>Beautiful color, a super matte gray.  </li>
      <li>Dries in a matte tone, still looks amazing with sparkles when used with a glossy top coat...</li>
      <li>The color is amazing, and I would love to continue to buy something in this color.</li>
      <li>I love china glaze.</li>
      <li>This is our favorite.  </li>
      <li>Okay, I LOVE this color and couldn&#x27;t wait to rock it.  </li>
      <li>What I love is that it&#x27;s a matte.</li>
      <li>I thought I needed a top coat, but that didn&#x27;t help at all.  </li>
      <li>But you can put a top coat on (I use Seche Vite), and it has a shiny, shimmery finish.</li>
      <li>I love the shade, it&#x27;s opaque with one coat, i suggest putting two coats and a top coat because it fades after one day.</li>
      <li>I would put a top to protect but that would defeat the purpose of it being matte because the top coat would make it shiny.  </li>
      <li>if this had a better staying power i would give it 5 stars.</li>
      <li>It Sure is differnt thats for sure.</li>
      <li>LOVE it.</li>
      <li>so I said OK just send me the one I ordered</li>
      <li>and I hope they come up with a better formula.</li>
      <li>Very good quality case and super fast shipping!  </li>
      <li>It sets a great contrast if you paint your tips a normal gloss polish.</li>
      <li>Under the glossy topcoat it&#x27;s shiny and deep gray with beautiful silver glimmers in it.</li>
      <li>If you put it on without a top coat, it has a matte-style finish, which looks really cool.</li>
      <li>It goes on great and as I mentioned earlier it dries very quickly.</li>
      <li>so that&#x27;s a HUGE plus for me when I do my nails</li>
      <li>and that&#x27;s never happened before, even with cheap polishes.  </li>
      <li>Worth the purchase!</li>
      <li>I fixed the matte problem with a top coat but still wasn&#x27;t satisfied.</li>
      <li>The color is beautiful and I love that I&#x27;ts matte (dull, not shiny)</li>
      <li>recommend this as a good basic color.</li>
      <li>For the cost its not a bad deal.</li>
      <li>That&#x27;s not a bad thing, it&#x27;s just a fact.</li>
      <li>It went on great and dried quickly, but it chipped within 24 hours!</li>
      <li>At one point I listed this as my new favorite polish.  </li>
      <li>impatient, so I used my Seche Vite top coat and was very pleased with the look.</li>
      <li>I love the Hunger Games collection and was really impressed with the swatches I saw of Stone Cold.  </li>
      <li>Try a matte top coat, and use a gloss over just the tip to make a unique French mani - you won&#x27;t regret it!</li>
      <li>I love the stone finish and it is now one my favorite polishes, although it does chip easily so be careful!</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s such a great color with such a funky cool look.</li>
      <li>Since then I&#x27;ve tried using a clear gloss top coat, matte top coat, and even doing a 6 layer Konad polish manicure where the polish was 4 layers deep.  </li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t realize when I first purchased this polish that it was a matte finish.</li>
      <li>First, I got it promptly, that was one star.</li>
      <li>They are chipped in the middle of most of my fingers.&lt;br</li>
      <li>don&#x27;t think a nail polish should require a top coat, but this definitely does.  </li>
      <li>Covers completely with one coat and dries really fast!!!</li>
      <li>It goes on nice and thick, one coat coverage, and looks fabulous as is (matte) or with a top coat above it (gloss).  </li>
      <li>It is a matte finish, which was a fun change from what I normally wear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>really wish China Glaze would revisit this polish.  </li>
      <li>The matte finish really adds to the allure.</li>
      <li>However, I didn&#x27;t know that much about China Glaze products, so I didn&#x27;t want to spend the money.  </li>
      <li>It dries SO fast.</li>
      <li>Dries super fast but needs a top coat as it&#x27;s a little dull on its own.</li>
      <li>This nail polish color tends to chip more than the other colors.</li>
      <li>It goes on easy and smooth, but then dries to a hard matte finish.  </li>
      <li>Almost, black but with too many hints of shinny silver not to draw attention.  </li>
      <li>The reason for the next two stars is the color, after the top coat it is a really pretty color but DEFINITELY not worth the hassel.</li>
      <li>This is such a fun color to pair with evening wear, a night out at clubs, or with a holiday dress.  </li>
      <li>I put on the Stone Cold and loved it right away.</li>
      <li>I thought at first it was because I only did one layer.  </li>
      <li>This was a huge let down</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll admit, I love the entire Hunger Games collection, but I loved Stone Cold enough to buy it twice.</li>
      <li>not sure if it is because it is matte or because it is high glitter but this polish chips and flakes so easily.  </li>
      <li>I took a shower about 2 hours after I painted my nails, and when I got out and dried off, I realized that huge flakes of polish had chipped off my nails.</li>
      <li>&amp; so I just decided to stop wearing it, as it was clearly going to refuse to stay on.</li>
      <li>You must use a clear coat to protect it...which defeats the purpose of it being matte.  </li>
      <li>I was really excited when this line came out a few years ago.  </li>
      <li>If you cover with a glossy top coat, it just brings out the subtle sparkles.</li>
      <li>I view several nail art blogs and this polish was in high demand.</li>
      <li>does not chip and more or less then other like it.</li>
      <li>And it was supposed to be new but was delivered with polish on the outside.</li>
      <li>The same day, within hours, I had a large chip for my long work and getting my nails</li>
      <li>Dries matte, giving me two different looks if I added a shiny clear coat.</li>
      <li>but I would not suggest this to anyone because it barely lasts.</li>
      <li>One coat was not enough for a complete look, but two coats was perfect.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m</li>
      <li>The only disclaimer is that because it&#x27;s a matte it will dry really fast and it can be goopy.</li>
      <li>but it seemed to chip much faster than any other color I owned.</li>

<li> This was my first nail polish with a finish other than your usual flat, glitter, or shimmer</li>
<li> Stone cold was one of my favorite colors and textures I have bought.</li>
<li> It is a matte polish that becomes a shimmery grey with a topcoat.  </li>
<li> formula is really REALLY thick and dries much faster than any other CG polish I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
<li> ... sadly enough it chipped like 2 days after i applied it :(&lt;br /&gt;the problem is that you can&#x27;t apply a topcoat to make it last longer without losing the matte effect that makes this shade so special!</li>
<li> This nail polish applies heavily, so be prepared for a thick coat on your first pass.</li>
<li> It goes on super thick and its extremely hard to remove.</li>
<li> I didn&#x27;t want to believe the negative reviews and thought I was in the clear of it chipping like</li>
<li> China Glaze \\&quot;Capitol\\&quot; series Stone Cold, looks like liquid mercury when you put it on - and then it dries (quickly too)into a coal-esque shade.</li>
<li> I gave the seller all positive feedback because it is not their fault the polish is flawed.</li>
<li> I cannot find a matte clear coat to make this polish keep the dry flat look.  :(</li>

    <li> I put on the Stone Cold and loved it right away. The color is beautiful and I love that I&#x27;ts matte (dull, not shiny) but it didn&#x27;t last long.  After a day it was already chipping and after four days it looks like I&#x27;ve been wearing it for over a week.  I would put a top to protect but that would defeat the purpose of it being matte because the top coat would make it shiny.  I&#x27;ts gorgeous while it&#x27;s there but I would not suggest this to anyone because it barely lasts.</li>
    <li> This nail polish color tends to chip more than the other colors.</li>
    <li> First, I got it promptly, that was one star. When i opened the package polish had leaked, i wasnt too crazy about that. I put it on the night I got it. The seller did not say it was a MATTE COLOR!!!!! If you don&#x27;t like matte, like me, don&#x27;t buy. It goes on super thick and its extremely hard to remove. I fixed the matte problem with a top coat but still wasn&#x27;t satisfied. The reason for the next two stars is the color, after the top coat it is a really pretty color but DEFINITELY not worth the hassel. SENDING BACK!</li>
    <li> Very good quality case and super fast shipping!  This case looks a lot like the gold 5S so it&#x27;s almost like not having a case at all. Love it!</li>
    <li> Okay, I LOVE this color and couldn&#x27;t wait to rock it.  It is a matte finish, which was a fun change from what I normally wear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I painted my nails yesterday with 2 coats and they are already chipped.  They&#x27;re not just chipped by the tip of my nails where I may have bumped them after typing and whatnot.  They are chipped in the middle of most of my fingers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t think a nail polish should require a top coat, but this definitely does.  Unfortunately, a top coat will probably cost you the matte finish, but I suspect it looks good glossy, too.</li>
    <li> China Glaze \\&quot;Capitol\\&quot; series Stone Cold, looks like liquid mercury when you put it on - and then it dries (quickly too)into a coal-esque shade. It goes on great and as I mentioned earlier it dries very quickly. Surprisingly great pick of The Hunger Games series!</li>
    <li> At one point I listed this as my new favorite polish.  Sadly, that review has changed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Stone Cold is a matte polish that has problems.  It goes on nice and thick, one coat coverage, and looks fabulous as is (matte) or with a top coat above it (gloss).  Unfortunately, that&#x27;s where the wonder ends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While a beautiful color, color isn&#x27;t everything.  This polish chips badly.  I thought at first it was because I only did one layer.  Since then I&#x27;ve tried using a clear gloss top coat, matte top coat, and even doing a 6 layer Konad polish manicure where the polish was 4 layers deep.  The same day, within hours, I had a large chip for my long work and getting my nails perfect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really wish China Glaze would revisit this polish.  The color is amazing, and I would love to continue to buy something in this color. But with the problems it has with bad chipping and flaking, it&#x27;s not worth a re-buy.  This will be my last bottle.</li>
    <li> I applied Stone Cold with a base coat that was supposed to keep it on longer &amp; it did look nice...for the day. The next day, I woke up and noticed bits of it had chipped off and I was a little confused, so I reapplied it, but with every tomorrow, more of it would chip off. I would see it flake off periodically during the day &amp; so I just decided to stop wearing it, as it was clearly going to refuse to stay on. I have to say I&#x27;m disappointed with this color, because of its flakiness.</li>
    <li> I was really excited when this line came out a few years ago.  However, I didn&#x27;t know that much about China Glaze products, so I didn&#x27;t want to spend the money.  I obtained this color yesterday.  It went on great and dried quickly, but it chipped within 24 hours! I thought I needed a top coat, but that didn&#x27;t help at all.  I doubt I will buy this brand again.</li>
    <li> I view several nail art blogs and this polish was in high demand. What I love is that it&#x27;s a matte. It sets a great contrast if you paint your tips a normal gloss polish. If you cover with a glossy top coat, it just brings out the subtle sparkles. The only disclaimer is that because it&#x27;s a matte it will dry really fast and it can be goopy. Worth the purchase!</li>
    <li> I have to keep this in my collection - it&#x27;s such a great color with such a funky cool look. Dries super fast but needs a top coat as it&#x27;s a little dull on its own.</li>
    <li> This was my first nail polish with a finish other than your usual flat, glitter, or shimmer and I was blown away.  I love the stone finish and it is now one my favorite polishes, although it does chip easily so be careful!</li>
    <li> I asked for stone age I find out later it is discontinued but do they tell me? No they sent this one.I asked for the one I ordered and they said sorry no returns on nail polish so I said OK just send me the one I ordered and they didn&#x27;t cause its discontinued but they didn&#x27;t tell me it was I had to find out on my own. I guess they just wanted to make a sale</li>
    <li> I love the shade, it&#x27;s opaque with one coat, i suggest putting two coats and a top coat because it fades after one day.</li>
    <li> bought it for my daughter.</li>
    <li> I love china glaze. It dries SO fast. And I&#x27;m really&lt;br /&gt;Impatient so that&#x27;s a HUGE plus for me when I do my nails</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t realize when I first purchased this polish that it was a matte finish. However when I read some more about it, I was happy that I&#x27;d jumped the gun and bought it.&lt;br /&gt;The formula is really REALLY thick and dries much faster than any other CG polish I&#x27;ve tried. That&#x27;s not a bad thing, it&#x27;s just a fact. One coat was not enough for a complete look, but two coats was perfect.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m impatient, so I used my Seche Vite top coat and was very pleased with the look. Under the glossy topcoat it&#x27;s shiny and deep gray with beautiful silver glimmers in it. Frankly, I like the matte capability; but the gloss is simply beautiful!&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this as a good basic color.</li>
    <li> This is a great color!  My daughter and I bought the Hunger Games collection colors in pieces.  This is our favorite.  It goes on easy and smooth, but then dries to a hard matte finish.  This is such a fun color to pair with evening wear, a night out at clubs, or with a holiday dress.  Almost, black but with too many hints of shinny silver not to draw attention.  The matte finish really adds to the allure.</li>
    <li> This is an amazing nail polish. If you put it on without a top coat, it has a matte-style finish, which looks really cool. But you can put a top coat on (I use Seche Vite), and it has a shiny, shimmery finish. It&#x27;s like getting two colors in one. LOVE it.</li>
    <li> After a few hours of wear, it had chipped really badly. Maybe I shouldn&#x27;t have put a base coat under it?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not sure if all mattes are like this or not.</li>
    <li> I got the polish in and couldn&#x27;t wait to paint my nails. I love the color, but it chips horribly. I took a shower about 2 hours after I painted my nails, and when I got out and dried off, I realized that huge flakes of polish had chipped off my nails. It looks good for a couple hours.</li>
    <li> I love the Hunger Games collection and was really impressed with the swatches I saw of Stone Cold.  It is a matte polish that becomes a shimmery grey with a topcoat.  I really loved it but it seemed to chip much faster than any other color I owned.</li>
    <li> I have never owned a nail polish like this. It kinda goes on and turns into a metalic type instantly. I&#x27;m not sure if I Like it or Hate it. It Sure is differnt thats for sure. I guess it&#x27;s good to have a varity of nail polishes and this is one of those differnt ones.</li>
    <li> Nice color and good cover. does not chip and more or less then other like it. For the cost its not a bad deal.</li>
    <li> ... sadly enough it chipped like 2 days after i applied it :(&lt;br /&gt;the problem is that you can&#x27;t apply a topcoat to make it last longer without losing the matte effect that makes this shade so special! if this had a better staying power i would give it 5 stars.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll admit, I love the entire Hunger Games collection, but I loved Stone Cold enough to buy it twice. This nail polish applies heavily, so be prepared for a thick coat on your first pass. Dries in a matte tone, still looks amazing with sparkles when used with a glossy top coat... Try a matte top coat, and use a gloss over just the tip to make a unique French mani - you won&#x27;t regret it!</li>
    <li> Beautiful color, a super matte gray.  Like the name says, it looks like stone.  However it chipped on my toes the next day and that&#x27;s never happened before, even with cheap polishes.  I&#x27;m going to have to put a glitter coat over this or sandwich it between Gelish layers to use it, which means it will lose it&#x27;s matte finish, which is kind of the point.</li>
    <li> I gave the seller all positive feedback because it is not their fault the polish is flawed. Stone cold was one of my favorite colors and textures I have bought. It being a matte which is sometimes hard to find. I didn&#x27;t want to believe the negative reviews and thought I was in the clear of it chipping like everyone else have said in prior reviews to this product. I wore it one day and woke up with chipped nails!!!What could I have possibly done in my sleep to chip my nails. This was a huge let down and I hope they come up with a better formula.</li>
    <li> Covers completely with one coat and dries really fast!!! Dries matte, giving me two different looks if I added a shiny clear coat.</li>
    <li> I would like to give this polish a 0. It chips off bad within a day. And it was supposed to be new but was delivered with polish on the outside. Maybe it&#x27;s just am old bad polish they gave me. Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> I a not sure if it is because it is matte or because it is high glitter but this polish chips and flakes so easily.  You must use a clear coat to protect it...which defeats the purpose of it being matte.  I cannot find a matte clear coat to make this polish keep the dry flat look.  :(</li>
