### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>I am very happy with my dryer!</li>
      <li>Because of the attachments (included) and the ionic heat, it is great for smoothing frizzy or brittle hair.</li>
      <li>The hottest setting gets warm at best.  </li>
      <li>I am A stylist at Great Clips so this dryer gets used a lot</li>
      <li>great hair dryer, i even got one for my daughter because she loved mine and wanted it</li>
      <li>and it is an awesome dryer for a great price and cool to look at</li>
      <li>I loved this hair dryer - until yesterday when it stopped heating.  </li>
      <li>She is going to love it!</li>
      <li>I love this hair</li>
      <li>Have to admit that I love the peacock pattern.  </li>
      <li>I also like that the cool shot is one of the settings on the heat button and stays in place once pushed.  </li>
      <li>very pretty</li>
      <li>My Hair feels fuller and it so pretty!</li>
      <li>My old hair dryer from 10 years ago did a better job of drying my hair.  </li>
      <li>and it was really powerful.</li>
      <li>and I was excited since I&#x27;ve been needing a new hair dryer.  </li>
      <li>Plus it&#x27;s pretty snazzy looking.</li>
      <li>I like that this dryer has even heat and does not get too hot.  </li>
      <li>I decided to keep it because it is 1600 watts and the low setting is still a good bit lower than the low on my 1850 watt Conair.  </li>
      <li>dryer!!I have had it for two yrs,and it still works like new!!</li>
      <li>I can pick different settings, my hair comes out smooth and shiny.</li>
      <li>I really can&#x27;t believe that....how aweful.</li>
      <li>I have very curly, medium texture hair and the lower watt dryers</li>
      <li>don&#x27;t push it around as much and the even heat is a must.  </li>
      <li>After reading the other reviews, I don&#x27;t think it is worth it.</li>
      <li>I have gone back to using my old dryer until I purchase another new one.</li>
      <li>had it been clear that there were not 3 different air flow settings.  </li>
      <li>It is only 6 months old.  </li>

<li> It&#x27;s lightweight, so it can be held for longer periods of time, and it has an extra long cord.</li>
<li> would highly not recommend buying this hair dryer , one day it actually blew a fuse it is a piece of junk.&lt;br</li>
<li> If you have thick, long, straight hair, this dryer is not for you.  </li>
<li> I haven&#x27;t heard back from customer service yet, but from the other reviews it sounds like they&#x27;ll want at least 30 bucks to fix it or give you a new one.</li>
<li> Purchased it through Groupon and after less than 6 months of daily use-</li>
<li> I was not able to find a 1600 watt dryer is local stores.  </li>
<li> The dryer is a little heavy, but no too bad for most people.  </li>
<li> Blowing hair in half the time without drying it out</li>
<li> I turned it on to dry my hair this morning and cold air only....</li>
<li> :(  </li>
<li> Very bad customer service.</li>

    <li> My Hair feels fuller and it so pretty!</li>
    <li> Myself like a couple others I too purchased this hair dryer from groupon , but mine lasted only 2 months.&lt;br /&gt;I would highly not recommend buying this hair dryer , one day it actually blew a fuse it is a piece of junk.&lt;br /&gt;Company said I could send back for 29.99 . Very bad customer service.</li>
    <li> I am very happy with my dryer! I can pick different settings, my hair comes out smooth and shiny. Now I want a matching curling iron!</li>
    <li> I would have given it 5 stars, but it does NOT have 3 speed settings as described.  It appears that they are considering off a speed.  I would not have purchased it at $50 had it been clear that there were not 3 different air flow settings.  I decided to keep it because it is 1600 watts and the low setting is still a good bit lower than the low on my 1850 watt Conair.  I was not able to find a 1600 watt dryer is local stores.  I like that this dryer has even heat and does not get too hot.  I have very curly, medium texture hair and the lower watt dryers don&#x27;t push it around as much and the even heat is a must.  I also like that the cool shot is one of the settings on the heat button and stays in place once pushed.  The dryer is a little heavy, but no too bad for most people.  If you have thick, long, straight hair, this dryer is not for you.  Have to admit that I love the peacock pattern.  I have only had it a week so can&#x27;t address realiability.</li>
    <li> Like others below - I bought this hair dryer from Groupon 6 months ago.  I loved this hair dryer - until yesterday when it stopped heating.  It is only 6 months old.  Since I didn&#x27;t register it within 30 days - I will have to pay $45 to have it replaced.  After reading the other reviews, I don&#x27;t think it is worth it.</li>
    <li> Bought for a friend and she loves it. Would purchase again.</li>
    <li> I am A stylist at Great Clips so this dryer gets used a lot and it is an awesome dryer for a great price and cool to look at</li>
    <li> Purchased it through Groupon and after less than 6 months of daily use- it stopped working this morning.  :(  I&#x27;m going back to my Conair or Revlon hair dryer that cost a whole lot less!</li>
    <li> I am so bummed that this isn&#x27;t working anymore. I probably used it 20 times. I turned it on to dry my hair this morning and cold air only....I bought if off Groupon 6 months ago and it was really powerful. And all of a sudden it just stopped working. I had a Walmart hair dryer before this that lasted 10 years! How is this possible?! I haven&#x27;t heard back from customer service yet, but from the other reviews it sounds like they&#x27;ll want at least 30 bucks to fix it or give you a new one. I really can&#x27;t believe that....how aweful.</li>
    <li> I purchased this dryer via Groupon 9 months ago and it no longer heats.  I called Proliss to make a warranty claim, there&#x27;s a 1 year warranty, except they want me to pay $29.99 to have them replace their defective product.  I will never buy a Proliss product again, and I recommend you do not either.</li>
    <li> This was a gift for my daughter in law.  She is going to love it!</li>
    <li> Blowing hair in half the time without drying it out</li>
    <li> This dryer has the temperature and speed selection that I was looking for. Because of the attachments (included) and the ionic heat, it is great for smoothing frizzy or brittle hair. It&#x27;s lightweight, so it can be held for longer periods of time, and it has an extra long cord. Plus it&#x27;s pretty snazzy looking.</li>
    <li> I just received this from a groupon and I was excited since I&#x27;ve been needing a new hair dryer.  The hottest setting gets warm at best.  My old hair dryer from 10 years ago did a better job of drying my hair.  I have gone back to using my old dryer until I purchase another new one.</li>
    <li> great hair dryer, i even got one for my daughter because she loved mine and wanted it</li>
    <li> Had 2 of these and they both went on fire.</li>
    <li> very pretty but it is a gift so do not know how it works yet</li>
    <li> I love this hair dryer!!I have had it for two yrs,and it still works like new!!</li>
