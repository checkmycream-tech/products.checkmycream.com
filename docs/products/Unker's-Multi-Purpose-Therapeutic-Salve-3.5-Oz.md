    <li> Tiger Balm is still better than Unker&#x27;s.  But it works when you are in a pinch .  I will not order it again tho</li>
    <li> A neighbor introduced this product to me for temporary relief of arthritic pain.  It was purchased in Pennslvania.  I could not find it in any of New Jersey pharmacies, so I ordered it on line from Herbal Remedies.  The price was $6.45 with add&#x27;l shipping of $5.94.  I think it is a great product for temprary relief of sore aching joints.  It is also recommended for sore muscles, arthritis, pain, coughs, sore throat, sinus trouble, insect bites. A small amount can also be  placed in a vaporizer. Can be rubbed freely around the chest, neck and back.  For external used only.  It is made of eucalyptus oil, oil of wintergreen mental cyrstals, oil of pine needles and oil of camphor. It is an \\&quot;original 1902 formula\\&quot;.   I understand that recently Unkers was bought by another company, so I don&#x27;t know if it will be called Unkers or be marketed under another name. There is a telephone number on the container of the manufacturer:  [...].</li>
    <li> Unkers is a great product, it works very fast after application to ease the pain, smell is not to strong, slightly greasey, does not take very much to ease the pain.</li>
    <li> A friend recommended Unkers and we think it helps.  We gave a sample to a friend and he is convinced, too.</li>
    <li> I have been using Unkers medicated for two years now.  I developed arthritis in my 60&#x27;s and when I reached 67, the pain on my hands, arms, feet, legs, back and side of my body were more pronounced.  I took all kinds of pain medicine and did not help.  A friend told me about Unkers and for 2 years now this is the only one that helps me.  I would not be able to live without this.  For colds, allergy, pain I use this.</li>
    <li> We having using Unkers for several years now. We even recommend it to our friends and family.It really does help when you have a cough due to a cold.</li>
    <li> Great, great product! Wonderful for sore muscles, colds, etc. Much stronger scent than Vicks. Much better deal for your money too.</li>
