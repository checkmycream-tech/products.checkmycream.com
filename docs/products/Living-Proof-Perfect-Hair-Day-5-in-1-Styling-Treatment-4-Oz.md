<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I LOVE the smell of this whole line of products, YUM YUM YUM!  oh, and it gives my hair volume too!</li>
    <li> It keeps hair in place but hairs feels dry after using the product every day for a month.</li>
    <li> I switch it up a lot with all kinds of hair and skin products . But I will be getting more.</li>
    <li> I liked the power of the cream when I let my hair just air dry.  THEN, I read the directions!  Wow, when used with my blow dryer, my hair is just great.  Even my gray hair shines and stays in the shape I want.  I think I&#x27;m addicted!  Who knew directions could be so helpful?  A wonderful product!</li>
    <li> I use it after every wash.  Great product which volumizes my hair without making it stiff.  I highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Excellent product!  Works well on my curly hair. :)</li>
    <li> This is going to be my go-to for hair everyday going forward.  Amazing stuff.</li>
    <li> Bad smell and not particularly better than any other leave-in creams on the market...although I love that this is silicone-free. Not worth the $$$</li>
    <li> Very good product. Use just a little on wet, towel dried hair and then style with a hot tool like a curling iron or hot rollers and your style is kept almost perfect for 2-3 days, or until you wash your hair. Make sure you don&#x27;t use too much. A little bit more than a dime size is enough for my over the shoulder length hair. I definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I have very thin and fine hair that won&#x27;t hold any style but pin-straight, even if I tease. I was fooled by this &amp;#34;miracle product&amp;#34; as usual. I put in a tiny bit and I&#x27;ll admit my style did last about 1 hour longer than usual and my hair felt silky. I tried a little more the next day and my hair just looked greasy and stupid. Maybe I&#x27;m putting it in wrong? I try to do it they way they show on What Not To Wear. Anyway, I&#x27;m using it as a mask for the ends of my hair now because it helps them not split.</li>
    <li> This stuff is awesome. I&#x27;m very hesitant about hair products because my fine, thin, limp hair has the perplexing power of taking any product, no matter the price or quality, and using it to turn into a complete mess. Any de-frizzing products or smoothing serums will make my hair look completely greasy and any volumizer will only make it tangled, frizzy, uneven, and unmanageable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But I had a gift card to kill at Sephora and decided to give my hair yet another chance for the sake of a New Year&#x27;s Eve party. I just got a small one for testing, but I&#x27;ll definitely be ordering a full size soon. It&#x27;s weightless and gives enough volume that I can do a lot of styling with my hair (for the first time ever), but it also makes it manageable enough that, should I choose, I can go pin-straight and trust that it will hold it together while keep it super soft and touchable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want really big volume, pair this product with another (I use a very small amount of Bumble and Bumble Thickening Dryspun Finish), but if you just want need a little extra pump to your hair to help with styling, this will work great on its own.</li>
    <li> I have fine curly hair.  Many products weight my hair down and makes it look either flat or oily.  This is amazing.  It gives me lots of body and hold with out the frizz.  What it doesn&#x27;t do is hold my natural curls.  So blow drying is good, natural dry is not.</li>
    <li> This stuff is awesome.</li>
    <li> Makes hair silky and smooth. Hands down the best hair product i ever used. Generally dont buy Jennifer Aniston endorsed products such as Smart Water but this is a solid product developled by MIT scientists.</li>
    <li> I had gotten a sampler kit of Living Proof for free from Sephora and fell in love with the Primer.  Someone said to try the Perfect Hair day as it was better then the primer.  It started off great, but lately I&#x27;ve been noticing it doesn&#x27;t work as good as it did when I first got it.  I&#x27;m not sure if my hair is getting use to it or not.  I wll finish using it and see how it goes</li>
    <li> A little goes a long way! Makes my blowout last an extra day, the bottle will probably last forever! Also adds volume. This is a keeper.</li>
    <li> I got a lot of volume and was able to style my hair very easily with this product.  It did cut down on the frizz and coarseness of my hair as well. I love this product and feel it will become a part of my everyday routine.  My hair is very coarse, dry, and frizzy and this is helping it look healthier and also helping me to style it easier.  After putting it in damp hair, I blow dry and pull the hair up from my crown and put some heat on it and that&#x27;s all I need to keep volume on top for a couple days.  This product helps to hold the style and control the frizz.</li>
    <li> My absolute favorite hair product.  This offers flexible body, but leaves no obvious residue.  I have very thin hair that wants to lie very flat, but with this product I get extra body without the feel of lots of product in my hair.  I hope they make this for a very long time!</li>
    <li> I use a very small amount and my hear looks great.</li>
    <li> Awesome product. It makes my hair smooth. I have fine, thin hair and this stuff tames the flyways without weighing it down.</li>
    <li> I LOVE hair products and couldn&#x27;t wait to try this one. What a disappointment - and it&#x27;s not cheap! Daily, I use a heat protectant, straightening balm and smoothing cream. I have fine hair that is cut in a bob. I used this for a few days and was really disappointed. My hair was weighed down, but the worst part it was GREASY! Three days later I gave it to my sister. Lets see if she likes it any more than I did.</li>
    <li> I love this product.  I have thin hair so I can&#x27;t use too much but it gives my hair amazing body and controls frizz better than any other product I have found.  I use this with the Brazilian Blowout  shampoo and conditioner and it works great.</li>
    <li> This product is great on my hair.  It makes my hair shine and feel more managable</li>
    <li> This is the best product I have ever used!!! It is worth every penny, and nothing you buy in a drugstore is this good!!! Your hair will stay straight even in the most humid conditions, it mouisturises your hair, protect sit, and the volume is amazing!!! I had a wonderful experience with this seller every thing was perfect!!! I highly recommend them!!</li>
    <li> This product did absolutely zero for me.  I used it before blow drying and my hair wasn&#x27;t smooth and didn&#x27;t have body.  It was a complete bust for me.  This is unusual because I truly love the Perfect Hair Day shampoo and conditioner as well as the Prime Style Extender and the No Frizz Weightless Styling Spray.  I have had much better results with the styling spray than with the 5 in 1 Styling Treatment.  The directions on the 5 in 1 say to blow dry for best results.  This is what I did and try as I might, I couldn&#x27;t even get my hair to bend around a round brush.  The ends looked frayed and ratty and there was a significant amount of frizz.  I don&#x27;t get this with the styling spray at all.  I usually let my hair air dry because I&amp;#34;m somewhat uncoordinated with a dryer and round brush, but I thought I would give it a whirl because the styling treatment directions recommended it.  My hair was totally uncooperative and the overall effect made me look like I stuck my finger in an electric socket, lol!  My usual MO is to apply the styling spray to clean, damp hair and let it air dry overnight.  This reduces the damage caused by the heat of the dryer and my hair usually dries quite smooth with zero frizz.  I then use a curling iron to create loose waves and the spray gives me a nice amount of hold for my impossible to hold hair and it lasts all day and into the next.  The 5 in 1 treatment was sorely disappointing but I guess we can&#x27;t all make use of every styling product.  This one just isn&#x27;t for me.  I wanted some volume but also smoothness and I wanted to be able to instill some curl with the round brush.  But this wasn&#x27;t happening at all.  I&#x27;ll stick with the styling spray but I may give the new product, Blowout, a go to see whether I can get the volume and smoothness I&#x27;m after.  This 5 in 1 Styling Treatment may work great for some, but it&#x27;s nowhere near good for me.  I definitely don&#x27;t recommend it for somewhat wavy, medium textured hair, especially if you blow dry..</li>
    <li> I will definitely use them again.</li>
    <li> This truly does create a perfect hair day. I have a lot of fine hair that frizzes when the humidity is high and goes flat when I over product. This product allows my hair to lay perfectly to take advantage of my cut. Brings out highlights too.</li>
    <li> Love it! It&#x27;s been working great and it smells so good.</li>
    <li> I really love the way this product smells and feels.  It is light and doesn&#x27;t seem to weigh the hair down.  I prefer for days I straighten my hair vs wear it curly.</li>
    <li> Again, I had issues with the scent… too floral, gave me a headache.  I also like my curls to be thicker, fuller and not so tight - this gives you tight curls - so folks with thick hair will love this.  Unfortunately I previously lost a bunch of hair and now I am trying to grow it back, so this styling product unfortunately shows how skimpy my hair is right now.</li>
    <li> Overrated Its fine for something to put in your hair after a shower for heat protection and decreasing the frizz, but Redkin etc does the same in my opinion. I wouldn&#x27;t say no to it, but just assume buy a cheaper one at your local drug store. Certainly not the magic bullet people say it is</li>
    <li> Love this product. It makes my hair shiny and takes the frizz out. It was shipped within a day and no charges for shipping.</li>
    <li> only for use if you plan on blow drying. i think some negative reviews come from people that used this and air dried their hair. for me, it left is soft, knot free and enhanced my blow out.</li>
    <li> My curly hair is so temperamental, but this helps MOST of the time. A little overpriced, and while the smell is nice, it wears of within a few hours.</li>
    <li> I like this stuff, helps me to have some really good hair days, especially when I need to go see my hair stylist to get the grey covered.</li>
    <li> Great styling cream.  Doesn&#x27;t weigh the hair down and gives the hair a great shine!</li>
    <li> OK here is the thing...this stuff is really good BUT for Pete&#x27;s sake for the cost of it I was expecting it to do something magical I guess LOL...it doesn&#x27;t do anything more than if I used my GARNIER FRUCTIS Curl Sculpting Cream and it&#x27;s only $4. I won&#x27;t buy it again. I mean I might not giving it a fair shake because I usually don&#x27;t blow dry my hair so maybe it does some magic genie thing when you blow your hair out with it but if you don&#x27;t...it doesn&#x27;t do anything more than my $4 cream.</li>
    <li> I love this product! I have fine hair and Perfect Hair Day gives it body and fullness I&#x27;ve not gotten from other products I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
    <li> Good product.  Eliminates frizz and makes my waivey hair smoother.  However, it works better for me when used with a root lifter.  I have short hair.</li>
    <li> Love the way it makes my hair more manageable</li>
    <li> No idea what the big deal is.  I have thin and fine hair and I can&#x27;t tell any difference at all when I use this.</li>
    <li> This is probably the single best hair styling product I have used!</li>
    <li> This stuff really works ... Adds volume, shine and bady all at the same time!</li>
    <li> Works great.  I would buy it again and have already recommend it.</li>
    <li> I originally bought this is a salon and am getting low. I just wanted to make sure Amazon sold it. But I was really surprised there weren&#x27;t more reviews. I have tried every mousse, gel, etc. product out there and this one is just amazing. You only need a small amount...too much will make your hair greasy. But, that is great because the product lasts forever. It&#x27;s makes my hair shiny, holds the style and is just really easy to use. I have mid-length, normal hair. It&#x27;s not too thick or too thin. I use the amount of a dime.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just try it!</li>
    <li> great product. does not leave hair sticky like other products and i can style my hair super easy with this product</li>
    <li> I like the smell and leaves hair soft and frizz free. Just a little bit goes a long way.</li>
    <li> I like this product very much, but you have to try it several times to determine the right amount to use for your hair.  Not enough and my hair is fly away,  Too much and my hair is heavy and hard to style.  Right amount and it works very well.  I would buy it again.</li>
    <li> The first time I used this product I wasn&#x27;t sold on it. I decided to give it another shot and I do really like it now. A little bit goes a long way so use sparingly. The product feels heavy but is surprisingly light. I have used many products on my hair and this one helps eliminate frizz while still maintaining volume.</li>
    <li> I have very fine, stick-straight hair. Using just a dime-sized amount of this product makes my hair look smooth, sleek, shiny, and fabulous. As other reviewers have mentioned, I don&#x27;t feel like this product does a whole lot for me in the volume department, so I will try layering it with some other volumizing products to see if I get better results. Still, I really like this cream a lot and will definitely repurchase it.</li>
    <li> Great product a must try for everyone!</li>
    <li> I rarely write reviews but this product worked so well, I had to write a review and give it 4.5 stars. I used a very small amount on dry hair, and immediately my hair was smoother, softer, shinier, and free of frizz--amazing! Plus, this product smells great. However, I am not sure yet if it is worth almost $28, which is why I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars.</li>
    <li> I was a little disappointed in this product, but it&#x27;s not a total bust. I have naturally curly&amp;fine hair. I typically blow dry it straight. I didn&#x27;t feel like this really controlled the frizz very well, but my hair does feel soft, and doesn&#x27;t feel weighed down, like some prods can do. I will use this product if I&#x27;m in a pinch. It does have a nice light fragrance...maybe grapefruit? I&#x27;m not certain. Not a heavy fragrance, but just pleasant.</li>
    <li> Not thrilled with this.  the sample worked differently than this does</li>
    <li> LOVE!! That I don&#x27;t have to use conditioner and a styling gel and a drying protection. Found this product through More Magazine and it is really worth the funds. It is a small container but you only need a little bit. I have medium length hair and it works great. I feel better drying my hair. And it smells so fresh!</li>
    <li> I like it, but honestly I think restore in this line is the best for me at least. I wanted to try them all and they are all good, but my first one that I will stick with for a long time is the Living Proof Restore. Makes my girls hair manageable and easy to comb through.</li>
    <li> First, it&#x27;s free shipping if you just order direct from Living Proof.  I&#x27;ve tried a majority of their products and I&#x27;m very pleased with this new one.  My hair type is very thin, fine, yet wavy/curly hair.  This stuff is amazing, within the first week I used, I had about 3 people comment on how \\&quot;long\\&quot; my hair was getting.  Nope, my hair isn&#x27;t any longer, but this stuff is so amazing that it did a great job \\&quot;relaxing\\&quot; my normally dry, frizzy waves, so it just appeared smoother and longer.  Even in the rain, my hair kept.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only issue is that my hair is so fine, it really needs volume, so I didn&#x27;t feel this product by itself gave enough volume (so that 1 out of the 5 pieces) I&#x27;d have to rate lower.  I still use a \\&quot;root lifter\\&quot; on top of the product.  With that.  Yes, had some of the best consistent/consecutive hair days!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s worth trying, not only this product, but the Living Proof line.  I&#x27;ve been very pleased with all their products!</li>
    <li> I have very fine, color treated hair that I round brush everyday. Like the 5in1. Have used about 2 weeks. It seems to give hair body and shine. Also seems to help with frizz somewhat.</li>
    <li> Really holds my hair in place. I have curly frizzy hair, and have tried many products for blow dry and ironing, but this one  keeps my hair straighter and smoother longer.</li>
    <li> I have very fine hair but lots of it. It made my hair really smooth and shiny and although iI have only used it for a week I can tell that it will be at the top of my &amp;#34;must have&amp;#34; product list. And it smells good. And you only need a tiny bit.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a product-aholic and this is a must have for any hair type. Not too heavy, not too light. I use it every day.</li>
    <li> Bought online because it was sold out at Ulta.  It works great - they recommend blow drying but I let my hair air dry the first time I used it and it cut the frizz quite well.</li>
    <li> Best hair styling treatment ever!! I use it every morning before I go to school. Very fast and easy to use keeps my hair perfect ll day long!</li>
    <li> I have tried so many different products. From salons, Sephora...you name it. I got a sample of this with an online order and feel in love. I purchased a bottle right away. This is the only product I use the in the morning and it does wonders for my hair. Adds volume, shine, makes it soft. I can&#x27;t tell I have any product in my hair. It&#x27;s lightweight and not oily. I blow dry my hair with this product, wear it down the next day, and in a bun on the third day. All the while, my hair looks great. This is amazing stuff!</li>
    <li> While I was not a fan of the original Living Proof shampoo, conditioner, etc.  I LOVE this product.  You don&#x27;t need to use a lot - just the size of a nickel.  I have fine hair so I was hesistant to use something that would weigh it down.  This product does not do that. My hair is easy to style, stays put all day, and looks good.  I haven&#x27;t tried the shampoo/conditioner as my salon didn&#x27;t have it the last time I visited.  If someone has used the shampoo/conditioner, please let me know what you think.</li>
    <li> After one use my hair is more beautiful than ever. I love this. It makes my hair soft and shiny without making it oily.I will  recommend this product to my  friends.</li>
    <li> I read about this product and brand in a hair article online. After reading the reviews and researching the product, I decided to try it out (despite it&#x27;s relatively higher price tag). I have tried nearly everything for my hair with disappointing results, so I really wasn&#x27;t expecting anything different.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Directions: I also purchased the shampoo and conditioner to pair with the styling product and used them prior to applying the styling creme. The directions recommend you that you blow-dry your hair afterwards, but I was running short on time so I just threw it into a braid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Positives: Normally, with other products, my hair would be a frizzy mess by mid-day. With this, it was still smooth a day later! The smoothing results are ridiculously better than any argan oil, coconut oil, John Frieda, or salon product I have tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Negatives: The only reason I am giving this four stars is the smell. I wish they would make this with nice fragrances, or even fragrance-free. I really can&#x27;t pinpoint the exact scent, but the best way I can describe it is similar to pepper. My husband really did not like the smell, either, which is kind of a killer for romance.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for nearly a month and with each application my hair has improved.  Now my healthy straight hair holds a curl even on humid days, plus it remains smooth and silky if I skip a day of styling.  It only takes a little pearl size of PHD before blow drying so it is a great value too.  I highly recommend this product especially to those with long or damaged hair.</li>
    <li> Favorite and delivered ahead of schedule</li>
    <li> Great service - fab product - won&#x27;t go anywhere w/o it</li>
    <li> After reading the reviews I was really disappointed.  Definitely not worth the price.  I have drug store products that do a better job.  Save your money.</li>
    <li> It was okay I had a little trouble with the cap once I got it going it was okay</li>
    <li> love it.  makes my curls really nice</li>
    <li> The seller, Fab Products, delivered this in a timely, professional way. I have very fine, straight hair that much of the time doesn&#x27;t hold a style for too long. I use the Living Proof line of Full shampoo, conditioner, and mousse to try to volumize my hair. Because I&#x27;m over 60 and have my hair professionally colored, it can get dry with split ends. I bought this to alleviate that problem. It doesn&#x27;t work quite as well as I had hoped in eliminating the look of split hairs and dryness, especially for the cost. Right now I&#x27;m blonder than I had been (with actually most of the crown of my head being gray), and I can still detect the look of dryness after styling.</li>
    <li> Not great for my texture of hair which is thick, wavy and hard to manage. My husband uses it now an drives it ok.</li>
    <li> Disappointing. Did not perform well at all for my natural curls.</li>
    <li> Made my life so much easier! I bought this before traveling to Europe, knowing I wasn&#x27;t going to have time to blow dry/style my hair every morning, plus electricity is expensive here. I take showers at night now, put this in my hair when it&#x27;s 80% dry, sometimes twist it in a bun or let it dry straight and the next day my hair is soft and manageable, tame and shiny. Perfect for me! My hair is naturally thin/straight whispy and frizzy. This fixed everything</li>
