<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I really love this product. I tried it because I was told from my family members that my yellow/stained teeth really made me look older than I am. I feel and look 20 years younger with my whiter teeth. Thank you</li>
    <li> I am looking forward to being in the wedding party of my friend. I previously was not, but I got this teeth whitening stuff and now I am looking forward to being in front of people, smiling and especially the photos. My teeth pop off in the selfies I have taken and it&#x27;s going to be a good time.</li>
    <li> Flossing and brushing is important to teeth health, but this product is just as important to keeping a good face on my teeth. My teeth are whiter than ever. Thanks.</li>
    <li> I drank too much coffee in my lifetime and now my teeth are paying for it. They are an off white color but I used this product for maybe two weeks and my teeth are turning around--it&#x27;s looking whiter and whiter.</li>
    <li> This is superior to whitening strips. Strips fall off my teeth and never stop. It&#x27;s really annoying. I will keep using these.</li>
    <li> Great method for whitening your teeth. Easy to use system and in only a handful of treatments it works really well.</li>
    <li> I cannot stop drinking coffee but it stains my teeth. I used this product for a few weeks and my teeth are looking much better. I hope to get it maybe a shade lighter so I will continue to use it.</li>
    <li> Strips are often falling out of my mouth. They just won&#x27;t stay in. I think maybe it&#x27;s my problem but my sister also has the same problem. Good thing this product came in and the trays fit good into our mouths. There is a little bit of work up top where you mold it to your teeth but there you go--personalized and everything. Nothing has fallen out of my mouth now and my teeth are whiter than ever.</li>
    <li> I am wondering if there is something wrong with my teeth because of how strips always seem to be falling off. No worries, I found this product where the tray system works much more superior for me, and I bet for most people. It distributes the gel evenly and is easy to use. I recommend this product wholeheartedly. Never have to mess with strips again.</li>
    <li> Showing off my white teeth to everyone. I almost wish I could put them on display somehow. People are smiling back at me and this product is to thank for that.</li>
    <li> No issues with my teeth with this product and that&#x27;s surprising because I always have issues with my teeth. But I don&#x27;t and that makes this a good buy.</li>
    <li> Years of coffee has wrecked my teeth. They are all yellow and not appealing. But I used this product a handful of times and so far so good. It worked much faster than expected. My teeth are looking great every single day. I can keep my coffee and also use this stuff here. Glad to see it works.</li>
    <li> Strips suck. They keep falling off my teeth and are a pain in the butt to even stick on, they always stick on crooked and who wants that? I don&#x27;t want some wack pattern of teeth whitening formula on my teeth. This way is better, it&#x27;s easier, and it&#x27;s more complete.</li>
    <li> Tray system beats out strips and other ways of administering teeth whitening solution to your teeth. Often strips fall out of my mouth and have trouble sticking on. This one has no trouble at all, it is made to fit perfectly in your mouth. My teeth have never been whiter and this product worked in a very fast amount of time. Only a handful of treatments before my teeth looked pretty great.</li>
    <li> I found the trays simple to use and easier than strips. Strips can often fall out of my teeth and it&#x27;s troublesome because it doubles the time needed to use. This tray system you need to bite down on and it makes it personalized for your own mouth. Then it&#x27;s only about 15 or 20 minutes a session. Easy way to whiter teeth.</li>
    <li> I had issues with sensitivity, so it was nice to see that this gave me no issues. That alone if worth a five star review.</li>
    <li> Faster than I thought. The results have come much faster and I am very happy to see such a quick turnaround. I used it only two or three times before seeing good results.</li>
    <li> Nice taste to this, easy system to use, making your smiles burn brighter. Can&#x27;t ask for more if you ask me</li>
    <li> I see results in a short time but I have three major problems: 1.) Packaging, I ordered two orders of this whitening kit and one of the four syringes was completely empty and had leaked out into the package; 2.) When I get to the end of the syringes, the gel comes out black, I think the pump (which is black) pushing the gel out is melting into the whitening gel; 3.) I have to prop the syringes up because the gel leaks out of them unprovoked making a mess!  Overall, good product but they need to work on the packaging since I only got to use less than half of what I purchased.  I do not recommend buying this product until the issues are fixed.</li>
    <li> I have sensitive teeth and I was worried that my teeth would be affected by this product. But I didn&#x27;t have to because my teeth do not hurt. They do not hurt and they are whiter now. Very happy with results.</li>
    <li> I am feeling more confidence in my mouth and I like seeing this kind of stuff happen. To use this product you just mold the tray to your mouth and use it for 15 to 20 minutes maybe two or three times a week. It works great.</li>
    <li> I am showing off my teeth to others more often. Feeling great about it and looking forward to picture day. Use this item maybe a couple times a week and that&#x27;s good enough for me.</li>
    <li> Great results here, very fast. Within a couple weeks my teeth were much whiter and I like seeing that happen. It really changed up the dynamics of my face.</li>
    <li> I have no issues with this and I usually have tons of issues with everything--very sensitive. But no issues here and that&#x27;s enough for a recommend.</li>
    <li> I have a school reunion to go to and Im glad that I got some of this stuff to use, because I want to look good for my old friends and classmates. Will be applying it and will update you guys.</li>
    <li> If you smile, you are transferring a smile to someone else. Then they can pass it on. This is less of a product and more of a public service. Love seeing my teeth look great on my face and I will continue to use it</li>
    <li> I was laughing at a family meal and my sister casually mentioned that my teeth looked a lot whiter than before. I have been whitening my teeth with this product for a few weeks now and I was very happy to see someone notice. I have had off color teeth for a while and this really helps my self esteem.</li>
    <li> Easy to keep up. It&#x27;s only about an hour a week, so like 20 minutes three times a week and your teeth look totally nicer, like 10 times nicer.</li>
    <li> I am feeling a surge of confidence after using this product. I was complimented at work by the receptionist and I walked around the block, I had such a rush going. I now have a spring in my step and find the product easy to use and I am very adamant about using it now, to keep it going.</li>
    <li> Easier to be confident when you look good. I can approach more women, more people. I smile a lot more. I can relaly feel the effect on me when I see how other people interact. They smile more as well. And after jut a few sessions, I noticed that this whitened my teeth a good amount. I will keep using. It&#x27;s at a good price point.</li>
    <li> Using countless products to whiten my teeth, it has racked up quite a bill. So I am always on the hunt for some sort of bargain. Seen this online for this price and I was taken aback. I tried it out and I&#x27;m here to tell you guys that this is the real deal. I used it for a handful of sessions and my teeth look great, and also it&#x27;s a pretty good price. I&#x27;d get it for that alone.</li>
    <li> Yellow teeth are grossÃ¢Â¦ no good. If I don&#x27;t like being around it, imagine what it was like when one day my sister made fun of mine for being discolored. I went into panic mode and fiddled around with whitening strips, which kept falling off my teeth. But i found this product and the way that it is done, it never falls off my teeth. I am smiling right now a lot more.</li>
    <li> I have had bad habits in my lifetime. Smoking, drinking, coffee, everything. Bad foods, sugars. My teeth are a wreck. They need a lot of help. I am glad that this product here helps. It is as good as other brands and types of teeth whitening treatments, but I noticed that it is a little bit cheaper and it works just as well, if not better. Love it.</li>
    <li> Strips often slip out of my mouth and are annoying as heck. I thought that I would find a product that would work for me and this one is it. It is a tray that fits into my mouth and molded to my comfort. Very easy to use and a great selling point on this one. I recommend it.</li>
    <li> My schedule is horrible and I have been ingesting coffee like a madman. Too bad, because my teeth have taken a turn for the worse. They look kind of yellow-y and so I came on here to look for good reviews since I can&#x27;t break the bank on this one. Saw the reviews here and I am here to add to the good ones. I used it for a handful of treatments and my teeth are two tones lighter. Loving it.</li>
    <li> The whitening is really blotchy and comes with vague directions. It doesn&#x27;t work properly.</li>
    <li> Trying to quit smoking but meanwhile I am preparing for post-cig life. My teeth will no longer be yellow I hope, and so far I have done two treatments with this product and things are looking up. My teeth have signs of looking whiter.</li>
    <li> I drink tons of coffee for work. I have to get up at 6 each morning so that will not be changing anytime soon. Unfortunately, that has left my teeth in less than pristine condition. So I came online and looked for a solution. Found this and used it for a couple weeks. My teeth are looking pretty good! I can continue with my horrible coffee habit and pass my teeth off as non-coffee drinkers. Good stuff.</li>
    <li> I find myself that after I used this product for many weeks I am smiling a lot more. It&#x27;s not coincidence. My teeth look pretty amazing. After I brush in the morning I look in the mirror and marvel at what my teeth have become, pillars of white and I am eager to show them off.</li>
    <li> The taste on this is pretty good! Makes whitening my teeth very pleasant experience. Will keep using. Not irritating like strips or taste spicy or hurt my lips like other ones.</li>
    <li> This product has a great price. I have searched high and low for teeth whitening solutions and came upon this one. It has a reasonable cost and the benefits are outstanding. Enjoy the system and find it easy to use. Recommended.</li>
    <li> Recommended. Enamel naturally becomes yellow as time goes on, but I know this stuff can battle it pretty hard. Used it only four times and my teeth look great in white. I would say this gives very good results.</li>
    <li> People are noticing my teeth at work. They ask me what system I am using and I let them know. I will also let you guys know and leave a positive review, because it&#x27;s a deal.</li>
    <li> I find myself smiling a lot more around my friends and family and work. I have found that they are smiling back a lot more as well. My teeth are whiter and I am more prone to show them offÃ¢Â¦ pretty amazing. Use this product a few times a week only and it could change your life.</li>
    <li> Coworkers are asking me about my teeth. They mentioned it last week that my teeth looked particularly good and then today a different person asked me if I use product on it. I fessed up, of course. But I was glad to share my secret. I will also give it the thumbs up here online.</li>
    <li> Minty fresh feeling in my mouth. Enjoy using this product and that&#x27;s good. Imagine looking forward to brushing your teeth or flossing, it makes it that much easier. I use this product a couple times a week and I enjoy feeling it. It makes it easy and convenient. My teeth look great as a result.</li>
    <li> Great price here on this product. I have bought whitening products for many years now and this one is one of the better ones, and strangely also a better price. I would recommend giving it a shot because of the reputation of the good reviews here as well as my word, which has it working for me.</li>
    <li> This works better than whitening strips for sure. Strips are uneven and often slip off my teeth for some reason. There is no adhesive of course, how would that work, but it does not stay on. This tray system is set and fits in my mouth easily. I use it three times a week and i love it. My teeth are whiter and I recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Find myself more confident in my looks and I am showing off my smile a lot more these days. Use this a few times a week and it does a good job of making my teeth whiter, perhaps up to three or four shades lighter. Pretty good stuff here. Will keep using.</li>
    <li> The tray system beats all. I think it is simple and I am surprised other people are not copying this style of teeth whitening. It&#x27;s very easy to me and this product worked for me just after a handful of treatments. I would recommend it highly. My teeth look great.</li>
    <li> Strangers are noticing how good my teeth look. I got a few compliments from people at work who don&#x27;t really know me. \\&quot;I like your smile.\\&quot; I feel good about it and it really gives me a bounce in my step. I think it&#x27;s awesome. I used this product only a few weeks now and it is almost changing my life. When you look good people treat you well.</li>
    <li> package came as described in a bubble-wrap envelope. I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;ll be perfect but it&#x27;s good so far.</li>
    <li> I just received my kit yesterday but overall very happy with it. The kit seems to come with a lot of whitening. I will be happy to post my results soon.</li>
    <li> I have tried this for about two weeks straight now and have seen zero difference in my teeth whiting.  Very disappointing!  $30 down the toilet.</li>
    <li> I like this system a lot more than strips. Strips often fall off my teeth when I&#x27;m putting them on and it&#x27;s really annoying. This stays on straight.</li>
    <li> I received a compliment about my teeth today and I couldn&#x27;t be happier. Thanks teeth whitening! It&#x27;s easy to use and if I just get one of these a week I would be walking on air. Very happy with results.</li>
    <li> This is great in addition to brushing. You do have to set up the mouth piece to fit in your mouth but after that it&#x27;s all gravy and simple to use.</li>
    <li> Surprisingly quick here. The results were good and I found it to be a pleasant experience overall. I thought it was going to take a month or so but nope. It was only about a week and a few treatments when my teeth are whiter than before. Very happy.</li>
    <li> I was surprised to see that this product worked as fast as it did. I was expecting to see results maybe a few months in, but only after a few treatments did my teeth look awesome and seem to be three to four shades lighter than before. Will keep using and every treatment my teeth look better and better.</li>
    <li> This teeth whitening system is great. It&#x27;s simple to use and I love seeing that my teeth are becoming whiter with each treatment. I find it easy to use and convenient. The trays are better than strips in my opinion and I think that everyone should wake up and forget strips because they often slip off and get solution on my lips and gums which burns a lot</li>
    <li> I would say there&#x27;s pretty well no reason to brush anymore other than the obvious reason to get rid of the plaque. But oh my does this ever whiten your teeth.</li>
    <li> Used to be afraid of picture day, and I thought my days were over until I enrolled in grad school. Now we have picture day again, but for physics club. Me being a scientist, I don&#x27;t really take care of my looks too much, but lately I have started taking an interest in looking good. Well this product covers my teeth, pretty much. I look good and my smile beams now, as opposed to looking limp and tired before. Will keep using.</li>
    <li> This is superior than strips because of how evenly it distributes the whitening solution on my teeth. Strips are thinner than the mouth piece that comes with this system and they often slip off my teeth. Also they do not cover all of my teeth. Why do I want white streaks on my teeth? I want them all to be white.</li>
    <li> I am now eager to show off my teeth to everyone and I have found myself very fond of smiling a lot more. That is good news because I just read a study that people who smile more do better in life. If whiter teeth is all it took for me to smile then this is a no brainer. I would recommend giving it a shot.</li>
    <li> Using this as my routine now. I thought my teeth looked fine before, but after using it for a few weeks I have unlocked the real power of it and people have been noticing my chompers, namely members of the opposite sex. I still need my charms but it&#x27;s a great conversation starter. I only use it a few times a week, probably two or three. Good investment.</li>
    <li> I had a bad smoking habit for many years, which left my teeth looking not so great. But after a few weeks of using this product, they are starting to turn back around. Here&#x27;s to hoping I can reverse it even more.</li>
    <li> Making this part of my routine now. I brush daily and floss every day too. I have decided to whiten my teeth every two to three days now and so far it has been great. My teeth look better than they have in years and I love how confident it makes me.</li>
    <li> Just a handful of treatments got my teeth so white! Very happy with the results. Will keep using this stuff.</li>
    <li> My smile is brighter and I can sense other people feeling more positive about me when I shine them my teeth. They are at least two shades lighter than before and I am more likely to show them off now. Will keep using and recommend this product to anyone who wants similar results. Easy to use.</li>
    <li> The tray system rules. It&#x27;s easy to use and fits in my mouth, because it was made to. You do have to run some hot water over it at first and mold it to your teeth, but after that it makes whitening your teeth a breeze. It&#x27;s really easy and I would recommend giving it a shot.</li>
    <li> My friends have been asking me about my teeth. This is because they used to make fun of me for having less than white teeth. But now they are all asking me about it! Well I won&#x27;t tell them but I will tell you guys, I use this about three times a week.</li>
    <li> This is easy to use. The tray system is great and simple. It makes a lot more sense and causes less garbage than other strips or whatnot. Recommended.</li>
    <li> Loving the trays. The system is easy to use and I would recommend it to anyone sick of strips.</li>
    <li> My teeth look awesome. I used this only a handful of times and I swear I look like I have movie star teeth. Great results.</li>
    <li> This works at a great clip. I was actually pretty surprised when I started to use it. If you had asked me how long it would take for me to get whiter teeth without surgery or something, I would have said a few months. I was willing to wait too, but this product actually comes through at about a week and a half, and my teeth look great. Much whiter than before. Used it about three times a week during that period.</li>
    <li> I was worried that this would irritate my teeth, but after using it a handful of times, I have had no issues I am glad to report. Will keep using.</li>
    <li> My smile looks amazing. I used to have photos of me when I was 7 and my smile was the cutest. Then I had years of smoking. But now, after using this product, my smile is back! It was there the whole time.</li>
    <li> Only a few treatments in and my teeth look great. I am amazed at the speed at which this works. I will be using this into the future.</li>
    <li> The stuff hurt my mouth pretty bad but each time I used it was less painful. Made my grill shine brighter than my earring so it was worth the pain.</li>
    <li> I only use it once a week because I don&#x27;t like putting chemicals in my mouth but it looks good when I use it. Excellent when used.</li>
    <li> Receiving lots of compliments about my teeth at work today. I started using this whitening product a couple weeks ago and I guess the results are finally noticeable.</li>
    <li> The whitening solution works very fast actually. Faster than I would have expected. Much better and simple to use as well. Will be using this product in the future. People at work are asking me about it so I have been referring them here. Will leave a review to tell the internet as well.</li>
    <li> I am feeling more confident in my smile and my movements have pretty much all reflected that. I find that I can command a room better and speak with more confidence. My teeth look great and I will keep using this.</li>
    <li> There is a nice gel to this product which is great because when you are whitening your teeth you want to feel like the experience is a pleasant one. I look forward to it.</li>
    <li> Bad habits wreck my teeth. I smoke and drink and drink coffee. I don&#x27;t really brush that often, or as much as I should, at least. So all these contributing factors does not help my teeth look white. I used this product for a couple weeks and it looks a lot better. I would recommend this for anyone and it feels like I have a second chance to keep them nice.</li>
    <li> I am grinning now because I saw the cute girl smile at me because I smiled first. What gave me the confidence to do that? Many things, but mainly that my teeth looked so good in the mirror this morning. I used this product and it is working out well.</li>
    <li> Surprisingly fast. Only a handful of treatments before I saw great results.</li>
    <li> I have a bad caffeine habit and now my teeth are stained. But luckily I have this product here because after a couple uses my teeth are already looking a lot better. Very pleased. Results are great.</li>
    <li> Great product .&lt;br /&gt;Noticed change after 2 weeks</li>
    <li> I smile a lot more after using this product. Never looked better. Brightens up my face overall.</li>
    <li> I have too much coffee in my life. That&#x27;s it. It is doing great things for my brain and keeping me going in life but the one downside for now is that it is yellowing my teeth a bit. I used this product to fight that and it turns out it worked. My teeth are a lot whiter now and I love it. Easy to use and fast working.</li>
    <li> Sensitive teeth owner here, and I didn&#x27;t have any issues with it. I hope you give it a shot if you are like me, because I hope you get the same results. No issues whatsoever.</li>
    <li> This is a good price for this type of product. Go to any brick and mortarÃ¢Â¦ or hell, even try online. Just know that I&#x27;ve done the research and for this quality of product it&#x27;s difficult to find equivalent value.</li>
    <li> People at work are talking about my teeth and asking about what I have been doing to them. That&#x27;s really cool because I have no seen that sort of attention before about my looks. I think that for a lot of people bad teeth are a dealbreaker and I would say that this is a very important part--people are starting to notice parts of me that aren&#x27;t related to my mouth as well. Will keep using this product until I stop being the envy of my work.</li>
    <li> Natural color of enamel, underneath our teeth is yellow. That&#x27;s unfortunate because as we age the enamel begins to show and it&#x27;s yellow and that&#x27;s not very attractive. Luckily there is teeth whitening solutions and I have found this one to be a good price and work very well for me. Recommended.</li>
    <li> Great seeing this at a low price. Other whitening products are too expensive to use. Will keep using it.</li>
    <li> The treatment works well here. The tray system is pretty intuitive, it&#x27;s just a plastic tray that sits in your mouth and you apply the whitening solution in there like that. It&#x27;s nice to see that it works well and my teeth look a lot better now that I started using this. Very nice and cheaper than many other kinds of whitening solutions.</li>
    <li> Three things I do to keep my teeth looking nice are burshing, flossing and whitening with this product. It does a great job of making my face look nice with whiter teeth. Love it.</li>
    <li> This is way better than strips. Strips often fall out of my mouth and give me problems. This is a tray molded to my mouth. Easy and simple.</li>
    <li> I got a compliment from a stranger today. Very cool. Did not expect to see such great results. I guess it makes sense. The teeth are a part of the face, the first part of the body people interact with. This product works quickly and the tray system is very convenient and simple to use. Five stars.</li>
    <li> I am feeling more and more confident in my looks after using this product for a few weeks. It&#x27;s been about two months since I started and after a couple weeks my teeth were whiter than ever. My smile looks awesome and the system that is in place with this is easy to use and I have seen great results personally.</li>
    <li> The mouth trays are a great system that stay in my mouth very easily. Other methods have not properly worked for me. The trays are molded to my own mouth so it slips right in. You do need to sort of put in a bit of work up top though. Run it under some hot water and mold it to your mouth. Then it fits for life. Easy and recommended.</li>
    <li> Coworkers are asking about my teeth. I told them of course but they were mostly happy to know that it was much easier to use this product than strips or other methods.</li>
    <li> I saw NO improvement! What a waste of money. I&#x27;m better off using baking soda. I have been using this for 12 weeks with no significant improvement!</li>
    <li> I smoke and drink lots of coffee. Unfortunately. I am trying to quit but in the meantime my teeth have come out looking less than stellar. I have some yellowing that comes with age as well and so I have to start using a whitening process. I used this and it worked for me. Very happy to see nice results. So far so good.</li>
    <li> I have a pretty rough coffee habit. It keeps me going and is my motor during the day. But the downside of this is that it has stained my teeth. A few weeks ago I decided to do something about it and used this product. After a handful of treatments my teeth looked consderably better and I was so surprised to see such a turnaround. Recommended.</li>
    <li> This was ok. I didn&#x27;t really see a big difference in the whitening of my teeth. Maybe a little but not enough to buy again.</li>
    <li> First off, I think 8 Oz water isn&#x27;t enough.  And to use the plastic circle is crap.  You&#x27;ll touch that hot water and to get it in the pan... oh yeah the tray touched the bottom and it melted together.  Try it again? Did, several times and it&#x27;s still jacked up&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh and the gel! It says how much to use, but that&#x27;s pointless! Took the top off the syringe and a whole crap load started pouring out without me using the plunger. I&#x27;ve been using syringes for 10+ years all sizes shapes and brands and as I&#x27;m an ER vet tech.  So I&#x27;m pretty sure I know what I&#x27;m doing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also think the roof of my mouth blistered.  Wouldn&#x27;t know yet since I just rinsed my mouth out but it sure feels that way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Never again.</li>
    <li> The reason I rated this as &amp;#34;It&#x27;s Okay&amp;#34; is because I barely started using it, and I&#x27;m still trying to get use to it. Perhaps at a follow up review, I could give an update on how it&#x27;s working.</li>
    <li> I like drinking iced tea and coffee. I also hate going to the dentist to get my teeth cleaned. At my age, the dentist always seems to have some kind of bad news for me. I decided (this time) I would try a teeth whitening treatment to see how it worked. I tried this one because most of the reviews were good. Here&#x27;s what I think.    The product comes with simple directions. You take a small amount of the gel and put it on the mouthpiece. You put the mouthpiece into your mouth (which is easy enough to fit) and wait for the results. After three or four uses, I noticed the stains on my teeth were gone. Better yet, my teeth look whiter than they have looked in years. My dentist tells me, I should stay away from tea and coffee, but this product makes it so I can drink what I want and have nice looking teeth too.    Tip-Don&#x27;t give up after one use, it may take a few to get those shiny whites you are looking for.</li>
    <li> Only works slightly, and doesn&#x27;t last for long.</li>
    <li> I really like how there are options to brighten your teeth that don&#x27;t require you to go to the dentist. I ended up saving money by using this product. Furthermore, it was easy for me to use. Although, I will still go to the dentist for checkups and dental care, I will use this product in between visits to keep my teeth whiter.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m on my 4th day and I can actually tell my teeth are whiter! I love this definitely would recommend to everyone out there !</li>
    <li> The natural aging process yellows teeth a bit. It&#x27;s been many years since I&#x27;ve had really nice set of teeth. Mine are a bit yellow and decided to do something about it. I got this product and started using it. It&#x27;s been a few weeks now and my teeth have become much whiter. Really enjoying this. Fighting against nature.</li>
    <li> I am using this twice a week now and so far the results have been pretty good to great. My teeth are about twice as white as before and I have gotten some compliments from friends and family. The tray system is nice and easy to use for me, very easy to pick up. Recommended.</li>
    <li> I have seen so many teeth whitening products on the shelf. It’s a great price. So many of them are sky high. It’s ridiculous. I have tried most of them and a lot of them work but when you can see that Brilliant has put out a comparable product at a very reasonable price it’s unfair. Go ahead and get this one.</li>
    <li> Results showed faster then I expected. I have sensitive teeth so I only treat once every other day. I saw results after the first use and it keeps on getting whiter each time. I also bought the Remineralization Gel, which is suggested if you have sensitive teeth. Very happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> Many people asking about how my teeth got so white. Very happy with results, although they are implying my teeth weren’t white before. Sad face. But great results.</li>
    <li> anyone can use shine whitening did not make my teeth sensitive at all.</li>
    <li> So the treatments worked REALLY well. I saw a big change after the third treatment but I had a little sensitivity after each oneÃ¢Â¦ my teeth are normally sensitive and I find even the whitestrips make my teeth sensitive. 5 Stars for the excellent work it did making my teeth white though.</li>
    <li> Whiter teeth just gives me more confidence. I don&#x27;t know about the rest of you, but it does for me. I look in the mirror and flash myself a smile and people may know I am checking myself out but I just want to look good. It works out in my favor though. I get good feedback for how I look and I have only been using this product for maybe a few weeks. Good stuff all around.</li>
    <li> Teeth have started to glow. Lol. Not really, but they&#x27;re so much whiter than they used to be. Thanks.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s the best whitener I&#x27;ve tried because it is so easy to use. There is no mess.</li>
    <li> This is a refreshing product and I enjoy using it, which is saying a lot. My teeth love it too.</li>
    <li> This is the same stuff you would get from the dentist at such a lower price</li>
    <li> My smile looks amazing. I used to have photos of me when I was 7 and my smile was the cutest. Then I had years of smoking. But now, after using this product, my smile is back! It was there the whole time.</li>
    <li> Best product for whitening your teeth found on Amazon. Give it a medal. Lol.</li>
    <li> I wouldn&#x27;t recommended this product to those who have teeth staining caused by taking antibiotics as a child (Tetracycline or Doxycycline). My teeth have lighter and darker regions, and the darker regions stayed about the same, while the lighter regions got much lighter. It increased the contrast between the two, so the staining is more noticeable.</li>
    <li> Sensitive teeth owner here, and I didn&#x27;t have any issues with it. I hope you give it a shot if you are like me, because I hope you get the same results. No issues whatsoever.</li>
    <li> Ordered this about a week ago and have been using daily since it arrived. My teeth are so much whiter, it&#x27;s hard to believe a product can work so well! I&#x27;m a smoker and heavy coffee/tea/wine drinker so having golden teeth was something I had simply resigned to, I honestly had no faith that this product could work. I&#x27;ve tried so many OTC teeth whitening products and home remedies and have only ever found results with this brand.&lt;br /&gt;Definitely worth every penny!!!</li>
    <li> Works great.  Be careful not to put on too much as it will burn your gums pretty bad.  But if applied correctly, this will get your teeth lots of shades whiter.  Will definitely buy again when needed.</li>
    <li> after using crest whitestrips for the past few years I got used to the mediocreness of them. SUCH A BIG difference between the shine whitening trays and the crest whitestrips. I&#x27;m glad I made the change. I just use these like the instructions say, every 3-4 days and they&#x27;re so pearly white, the actually almost shine - but not and unnatural look either.</li>
    <li> Crest strips are a pain in the ass. Thank you Shine White!</li>
    <li> Used to have these spiderweb looking stains on my fornt teeth no matter how hard I brushed. No more, just one use.</li>
    <li> ItÃ¢(tm)s better than strips. Strips keep falling off my teeth. My teeth are not flat, they cannot hold stickers or whatever. Trays are the way to go, and the gel is minty fresh too.</li>
    <li> This works extremely quickly. Only a handful of treatments and my teeth look freaking awesome.</li>
    <li> you only need a little bit to get big results.</li>
    <li> I will never untag myself from a facebook photo again after my teeth becomes whiter again. I use this product about two or three times a week depending on how much time I have but it’s always worth it. And you too just try it.</li>
    <li> I cant believe that this stuff works but it does. It improved the color of the teeth significantly. Not perfect but great deal.</li>
    <li> First of all I admit that I was a little skeptical. In this industry filled up with products that promise miraculous results, I decided anyway to give it a try and I am amazed by the results. My teeth got whiter and started to get some compliments about teeth brightness.&lt;br /&gt;This product works perfectly and does not hurt your gum if you put properly the gel into the tray. Just after five to ten minutes I removed the tray , I washed my mouth lightly and surprise! I am so happy to see the results and will definitely keep using it.&lt;br /&gt; I recommend it and certainly will buy it again!</li>
    <li> I bought this and love it! I have only used it once but i love that you can make the molds fit your mouth. I used the method of putting the gel on the q-tip and then on my teeth because i have some small teeth and didn&#x27;t want to just evenly put it in the tray. Also, when I opened the syringe some gel came squirting out quickly so i had to get it on a q-tip and then use another to make sure i was not putting too much on. This system is easy to use and in just one day I already see a small difference in whiteness</li>
    <li> I am VERY pleased with the result that i have seen from Shine Whitening. I am an avid coffee drinker and was looking for a quick, and cost effective way to whiten my teeth prior to my sister in laws wedding. I&#x27;m not going to lie - at first I was a bit skeptical that a product so affordable (especially compared to other brands out there) would get the job done, but surprisingly enough it did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used the kit everyday for a week for only 10 minutes a day. Not only did I start seeing results after the first couple of days, but I began to receive compliments from my family and coworkers. To me, this product is a no brainer and I HIGHLY recommend it to anyone who is looking for a quick and effective solution to whiten teeth and remove years worth of stains.</li>
    <li> Hurt my gums. One is leaking.</li>
    <li> After years of smoking.. My teeth weren&#x27;t looking great so I decided to give a home teeth whitening product a try and I am definitely glad I tried Shine Whitening.. I&#x27;ll post pics later of my results.</li>
    <li> After several uses, I already notice that my teeth are whiter. Kit includes two 5cc syringes. I thought that this amount would not last a long time, but it actually does! To apply, I just squeeze some gel onto a Q-tip, apply a thin coat to my front teeth, and sit there for about 10 minutes. The only issue is that after applying, I notice some white spots near the bottoms of my front teeth. They fade throughout the day but it is still a bit annoying.</li>
    <li> Great product for teeth whitening! This whitening gel has a good minty taste and isn&#x27;t overpowered with a chemical overtone. After just a week of using and my teeth already look noticeably whiter. I have used other products such as crest and other major toothpaste brands, and they haven&#x27;t had the same whitening effect on my teeth that Shine Whitening has. I would definitely recommend this product to friends.</li>
    <li> Finally a product that really works, without putting a hole in my pocket~&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using those white strips for months with minimally visible results. the reviews for this really made me want to at least try, and 30 dollars! Hard to not at least give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;The directions are straight forward, easy to follow, and ritualistic. the refills are affordable. and the results came were visible after about 4 treatments. My boyfriend even noticed!&lt;br /&gt;I will continue using these and have been already recommending to friends!</li>
    <li> Shine Whitening uses a tray system that is extremely easy to use. No hassle and it is very effective too.</li>
    <li> My teeth are now noticeably whiter than before, I think two shades lighter, after only maybe six to eight treatments. Great product very effective.</li>
    <li> The whitener gel stays in my mouth. I donÃ¢(tm)t have to taste too much of it or anything, like some other products. The mouth piece keeps the gel in my mouth and nowhere else. ItÃ¢(tm)s a good system that IÃ¢(tm)m surprised hasnÃ¢(tm)t been replicated elsewhere. I use this product three times a week so it better stay if IÃ¢(tm)m going to use that much time. Results are great too.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s the best whitener I&#x27;ve tried because it is so easy to use. There is no mess.</li>
    <li> I started to use Shine Whitening  and thank goodness it works and is easy.  My teeth have never looked better. Feeling great.</li>
    <li> If you read the reviews starting with the most recent, there are TONS of 5 star reviews by unverified purchasers who have never written a review for any other product than this one. Make me think that this is bogus.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for a few sessions and but the results are great. It really whitens my teeth.</li>
    <li> Review modified (from 1 star to 5 star) after customer service replaced product (see initial comments below). I guess the other reviews are right: Be very careful about shaping the mouth trays ... they need only a limited time in hot water. And don&#x27;t put top &amp; bottom trays in at the same time (or they&#x27;ll stick together).  Initial review: Mouth trays literally MELTED, collapsed and stuck together after dunking in post-boiling water. Without mouth trays, what can I do with the gel? Useless, and a complete waste of money</li>
    <li> This is the best whitening system that I&#x27;ve tried, I like the tray soo much better than the strips (it gets every inch instead of coming out splotchy) You just have to e careful around the gums because they can be irritated a little but other than that good product</li>
    <li> I highly recommend this product, it is very effective and it will definitely improve your teeth by a few shades. I have tried many teeth whitening products, toothpaste wasn&#x27;t that effective even though they were special brands. I also tried teeth whitening strips and all sorts of mouthwash and even flossing but none actually worked even temporarily which was disappointing. This however was the first product I tried that actually worked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Using the product is quite easy, you just put the molds in some warm water and then let them mold your teeth which worked as I did feel it a bit tighter. The rest is quite simple and plain forward. I always use these before I go to sleep and I think that works effectively cause there is no fluid or food entering your mouth while you sleep meaning this can do its job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would highly recommend 5/5, great product does what it says.</li>
    <li> Arrived with one tube leaking. The process is not instant. It takes a lot of treatments to lift the tooth color. I&#x27;m estimating about three weeks for me to see a difference. Didn&#x27;t have any trouble with sensitivity.  Works better then the whitening toothpaste.</li>
    <li> I was really skeptical when it came to this kit. I always thought that things to do with the mouth were best left to the professionals. But after using this kit I’m singing another tune! I save so much money using this kit at home opposed to going in to the dentist. You do have to spend a little time making your own tray, but after that it’s so easy and very strong. It’s worth every single penny!</li>
    <li> This product is very effective! WOW- I absolutely love the results. My teeth are A LOT whiter, I even like this product better than those crescent white stripes. This product works quicker and really whitens your teeth. I am very happy with this product and will be using this product from now on! Oh and the best part is, the results last very long. It has been a week so far and my teeth are still white! LOVE IT!</li>
    <li> I was very impressed with my results. It works really well. Will continue using this product.</li>
    <li> For someone who drinks coffee and wine on a regular basis product really made a difference. I noticed a pretty siginificant different using the first treatment, and with the second, all those pesky stains were almost entirely gone. Overall, it&#x27;s worked much better than all the others I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
    <li> The trays fit in your mouth and you do have to mold them in the beginning but they fit your mouth after. ItÃ¢(tm)s like a personalized mouth guard for a contact sport. But this whitens your teeth. I use it three times a week and my teeth are much better than before.</li>
    <li> You know the supermodels with perfect teeth? Now I have them. This stuff works like a charm.</li>
    <li> My teeth feel and look great - plus they are not sensitive at all. Nice product.</li>
    <li> I use this product everyday for 15 minutes and it really works. I found the irritation not so bad ( anyone with sensitive teeth would be able to handle it). I have had very good results with shine whitening.</li>
    <li> Enamel erodes with time and the natural state of our teeth is yellow. ThatÃ¢(tm)s too bad but I started using Shine and my teeth are as white as before the enamel started eroding. I use it twice a week and saw results in about a month. Tray system is great.</li>
    <li> I thought the price was decent for what you get in the package. The stuff works pretty good, and you get dentist grade stuff too. I wouldnÃ¢(tm)t bother with the strips anymore. These are so much better.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing, so much better than \\&quot;Dr Song Home Professional Teeth Whitening\\&quot;. I would recommend it.</li>
    <li> Brushing your teeth alone won&#x27;t do anything for you; even the whitening toothpaste won&#x27;t help. The strips are OK but it takes too long to notice anything. BEST is this stuff. This gel compares to nothing - the best bar none. It gets into all the spaces between that the strips never get.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a little over a week now, and the difference from before and after is definitely noticeable, but that&#x27;s because me being a smoker and occasional drinker of coffee it doesn&#x27;t help your teeth at all. But that&#x27;s besides the point. Point is, this here not only works to whiten it also helps keep them white for a longer period of time, and is also cheaper then crest strips at the time I bought it.</li>
    <li> I used to hide from the camera because my teeth were SOOOOO bad. I tried this product for a week and my teeth loook 10 times better than before.</li>
    <li> I am grinning now because I saw the cute girl smile at me because I smiled first. What gave me the confidence to do that? Many things, but mainly that my teeth looked so good in the mirror this morning. I used this product and it is working out well.</li>
    <li> I have a theory about smiling and attracting more people. Positivity begets more positivity and me smiling a lot more is happening because of this product. Easy to use and I am loving the results!</li>
    <li> I hardly drink coffee, but I do smoke. The yellow gets really noticable after a while. I have used trays before from some other brand, they didn&#x27;t work for me too well I got the goop all over and everywhere.. These ones are pretty good, no mess and easy to use no argument on whether or not it works. It works real good brings everyhing back to BETTER than normal.</li>
    <li> Crap doesn&#x27;t do jack for me. Used it for 10 days straight and no improved whitening. Maybe my teeth are white already? This does destroy my sensitivity though.</li>
    <li> I used this product though after my mom got it for me and my teeth become whiter than before I used this stuff. I really thank my Mom for this product.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great! As a cigarette smoker, I have a real problem keeping my teeth looking white and clean, but after these whitening trays, the whiteness of my teeth was already very noticeable. I&#x27;d even go as far as saying my teeth look better than they have in my entire life. I am very pleased with this product!</li>
    <li> I liked this product! I found it very easy and convenient to use. I was looking for something to help with removing stains from my teeth and the regular over the counter products were not working for me. I liked this product because everything was already packaged and measured out for me. It was simple to take the syringes and put the paste in the trays. It you are looking for something that is easy to use and will get the job done, then you should definitely give this product a try.</li>
    <li> Great product! I am using it for almost a week now and I can tell a difference between before and after. My teeth are whiter and brighter. The kit come with instructions and if you read them thoroughly, its not hard to use. The gel tastes very slightly mint like and has no side effects, burning or dryness. I recommend it highly as it will save your money to visit dentist for regular cleaning and whitening of your teeth, its easy to use and gives maximum results.</li>
    <li> I know there is some work to be done up top but if you consider the time you save by just slipping it into your mouth it is definitely more efficient. I like this product.</li>
    <li> I wish there was a Shine Whitening for getting someone to quit smoking, because this stuff is so effective. It really whitens your teeth that you cant afford to stain it with cigarettes.</li>
    <li> Shine is the best and there are no other teeth whitening that can really white my teeth as Shine.</li>
    <li> I returned this product because the trays were not great.  Following the directions, I warmed up the trays and when fitting the lower into my mouth, he back sides folded into the bottom making the tray unusable.  No second chance to get it right so returned for complete refund.  Never got a chance to even use the stuff.  Cheesy packaging, directions limited, more online, go,there first before trying to fit the tray to,your mouth if you even want to try it.</li>
    <li> I started to use Shine Whitening and after just a few treatments I was smiling a lot more. Feeling confidence now to have a social life with the elite.</li>
    <li> Good process for whitening teeth. Works very fast and found the system easy and simple to use. A monkey could do it. Give it a shot.</li>
    <li> Easy to keep up. It&#x27;s only about an hour a week, so like 20 minutes three times a week and your teeth look totally nicer, like 10 times nicer.</li>
    <li> I would say there&#x27;s pretty well no reason to brush anymore other than the obvious reason to get rid of the plaque. But oh my does this ever whiten your teeth.</li>
    <li> every whitening product makes yor teeth a little sensitive after using it. Shine Whitening was not bad at all. It made my teeth a little sensitive but the results were amazing and worth it.</li>
    <li> This is the best whitening system that I&#x27;ve tried, I like the tray soo much better than the strips (it gets every inch instead of coming out splotchy) You just have to e careful around the gums because they can be irritated a little but other than that good product</li>
    <li> so much easier than the strips</li>
    <li> My teeth are great now and this product has whitened my teeth after all the coffee I have been drinking and stain my teeth.</li>
    <li> For someone who drinks coffee and wine on a regular basis product really made a difference. I noticed a pretty siginificant different using the first treatment, and with the second, all those pesky stains were almost entirely gone. Overall, it&#x27;s worked much better than all the others I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using these for a couple weeks now and they do work well. However, in my package one of the two syringes did not function and actually leaked all in the packaging creating a mess. The other works, and the small amount you use each time has still allowed me to do one treatment. If this wasn&#x27;t the case it would be a 4-5 star product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like:&lt;br /&gt;-It works. Definite noticeable results after just a few uses (about 20 minute sessions).&lt;br /&gt;-The price is more than far, especially when compared to other products and professional whitenings at the dentist.&lt;br /&gt;-Very minor gum sensitivity at first and no tooth sensitivity at all.&lt;br /&gt;-VERY little of this solution goes a long way. Like I said, I only had half the product to work with and it was just enough to do a complete cycle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I dislike:&lt;br /&gt;-One tube arrived damage.&lt;br /&gt;-Honestly, the molds they send you are difficult to use and bulky. If you use them you may want to do your top teeth and bottom teeth in different sessions for more thorough results and much more comfort. I ended up using my old invisalign tray that fit perfectly after a few uses and it was much easier.</li>
    <li> ItÃ¢(tm)s easy to use and the trays make it a very comfortable experience to whiten your teeth.</li>
    <li> 1. they work so much better than the strips. 2. using the trays is a lot easier than trying to place the strips in the right spot. 3. almost no sensitivity 4. works with the first treatment unlike the strips.</li>
    <li> Excellent product for the job that it does. I was recommended by my friend to buy this product and I could see the difference within a few days. Just love this product and now my entire family is hooked on to it. I like the powerful formula that it has and I assure anyone who uses this product will be highly satisfied after just a few uses. It makes your teeth as if you have done professional whitening and your teeth shine and look perfect. The formula keeps working and you can do this from your home and don&#x27;t have to visit the dentist for professional teeth whitening.</li>
    <li> I use this stuff for about three times a week. This is my secret weapon for a beautiful white teeth.</li>
    <li> This is a bargain. Between the price here and the ease of use in my experience, this is the teeth whitening kit to get. Will be buying more for myself.</li>
    <li> I have seen so many of these products on the shelf, it&#x27;s so hard to decide which one to buy. I am putting my vote down for this one. It is a great price and I have personally used it and seen firsthand that the results are really good. Will be using this more and more and recommending it to others.</li>
    <li> I have previously been aware that my teeth are very vulnerable to sensitivity. It&#x27;s to the point where it&#x27;s even hard for me to drink cold water. Well, I was glad to see that I did not have any issues whatsoever with this product and I will keep using it because of this.</li>
    <li> I do this twice a week and it works wonders for my mouth. Enjoying seeing my teeth be so white and it really pulls my entire look together--my face looks more joyful and happy. I am more confident and feel more powerful as a result. Use it sparingly even, and i think it will work wonders for you. Great stuff here.</li>
    <li> The tray system is cool, it reminds me of boxing mouth guards. I punch the air for 15 minutes while it’s in my mouth.</li>
    <li> The tray system is simpler than strips. I know there is some work to be done up top but if you consider the time you save by just slipping it into your mouth it is definitely more efficient.</li>
    <li> This product is really effective just few weeks of using this product I see big improvement on my teeth and I like it.</li>
    <li> The system is easy to use and now I am happy with my teeth and enjoying smiling to all people I meet.</li>
    <li> This has a good taste and therefore I look forward to using it every single time I do, which is about two or three times a week. My teeth look great and probably are two to three shades lighter than they were before I started. Tray system beats all other systems and I love this product.</li>
    <li> If you make this product part of your routine it&#x27;s good for your teeth and will help with your looks. I started doing it a few weeks ago and my teeth are now a few shades lighter and I only do it about twice a week. Very good and recommended product here.</li>
    <li> The tray system is the best. I enjoy using it and watching an episode of television. Simple and easy. And my teeth look great too.</li>
    <li> They should make other companies use this system with the mouth trays because it&#x27;s way more convenient than other ways. I have tried tons of systems and this one is the best.</li>
    <li> It is a pleasant gel in this product, which is great because now I look forward to using it. That is important to this product as well, to use it often because it will keep your teeth nice and white. Very pleased with results and recommend it.</li>
    <li> Friends have noticed that I look better and have complimented my smile. I have actually forwarded them the link to buy this and some of them have. All have told me they are seeing good results and we are now the clean teeth crew. Great to spread to good word about this stuff.</li>
    <li> I like this product much more than the strips. The trays are comfortable and easy to use (they actually stay in unlike the strips). I found my teeth where so much whiter after a week of using it everyday. I am very happy with the purchase.</li>
    <li> Seeing this is great because usually whitening products are so expensive. I consider this one a bargain and I will be buying up more of it.</li>
    <li> Love to smile a lot more. It&#x27;s easy to show off when you know you look good, and one part of that is having a white smile. I feel extremely comfortable and confident after using this product a handful of times and I will keep using it whenever I need a small boost in the looks department of my teeth.</li>
    <li> My teeth are whiter since I was childhood until I smoke and drink. But thanks to this stuff the stain are easily remove.</li>
    <li> Good system here. I have tried a handful of other ones and this one has been by far the most convenient. The trays fit easily into my mouth and I enjoy using it--very simple. Recommended for if you need to whiten your teeth up a bit, and who of us doesn&#x27;t need that, to be honest?</li>
    <li> Good process for whitening teeth. Works very fast and found the system easy and simple to use. A monkey could do it. Give it a shot.</li>
    <li> Surprised that I am seeing these results so quickly. I expected to fully wait about a number of weeks before seeing anything like this but that&#x27;s just not the case. It is successful and I am very happy with the results. Will continue to use and I only use it about three times a week.</li>
    <li> My teeth are very sensitive and it is horrible trying to eat things that are even too cold or anything like that. So years ago I tried to whiten my teeth to no avail. My teeth hurt and I winced. But I heard good things about this product and gave it a shot--guess what, I&#x27;ve had no issues. I only use it once a week but it has my endorsement.</li>
    <li> made m my teeth a little bit sensitive but could really see a difference within a few uses</li>
    <li> Tray system beats out strips and other ways of administering teeth whitening solution to your teeth. Often strips fall out of my mouth and have trouble sticking on. This one has no trouble at all, it is made to fit perfectly in your mouth. My teeth have never been whiter and this product worked in a very fast amount of time. Only a handful of treatments before my teeth looked pretty great.</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive teeth so I was a little nervous about trying the gel instead of the strips. It works SOO much better than the strips. It made my teeth a little sensitive but bearable. I think this product is high quality.</li>
    <li> I really don&#x27;t like to use any whitening product because of my sensitive teeth, but I have no choice but to try it and I decided to try Shine Whitening and have noticed a big difference with my teeth.</li>
    <li> I was worried that this would irritate my teeth, but after using it a handful of times, I have had no issues I am glad to report. Will keep using.</li>
    <li> Works well on  my teeth and I  feel great. Try it and see results.</li>
    <li> I used to hide from the camera because my teeth were SOOOOO bad. I tried this product for a week and my teeth loook 10 times better than before.</li>
    <li> My teeth are whiter than ever and it has given me more confidence to smile at people, namely women. The feedback has been all positive and I am attracting more attention from the opposite sex.</li>
    <li> Product worked great.</li>
    <li> I just received my kit yesterday but overall very happy with it. The kit seems to come with a lot of whitening. I will be happy to post my results soon.</li>
    <li> Making this part of my routine now. I brush daily and floss every day too. I have decided to whiten my teeth every two to three days now and so far it has been great. My teeth look better than they have in years and I love how confident it makes me.</li>
    <li> my teeth are visble whiter now thanks to this product!</li>
    <li> I can afford whiter teeth now. I moved out of my parent&#x27;s house and since leaving have not used a teeth whitener, mostly because of cost. But this is a simple and cheap way to solve that. Good stuff.</li>
    <li> I am adding this product to my routine, along with brushing and flossing. It&#x27;s not hard once you think about it in a certain way. I know most people are busy and cannot even afford a 15 minute break to do something for themselves but having whiter teeth is really a blessing and people will treat you differently. This product does it in spades for me.</li>
    <li> If you are expecting your teeth to look anything like those pictured on the packaging, forget it! My teeth were already lighter than the lightest shade that they presented on their color chart which they provide for you to track your results. After 10 days, there was no visible difference. This MAY work for people who have extremely stained teeth get a few shades lighter, but I know it did not work for me. It doesn&#x27;t even list the ingredients so who knows what you&#x27;re putting on your teeth. I didn&#x27;t experience any sensitivity, so that was a bonus, but that kind of just reaffirms that it wasn&#x27;t doing anything at all. I went to my dentist and paid not much more to get a professional 22% whitening kit and within 2 weeks, I have had a HUGE improvement and much closer to that perfect white I was hoping for. If you are serious about whitening, professional treatments through your dentist are much more affordable now than they have ever been. I wish I had just gone that route sooner and not wasted my time or money.</li>
    <li> Looks expensive, but it&#x27;s not for what you get. Teeth are whiter with just one use. Great value.</li>
    <li> I just cant wait to start using it. Really happy with what everyone else has been saying about it, my mothers tried it, my sister.. Now me!</li>
    <li> Easily making this process a part of my routine. I can make the twenty minutes it takes to use this if it means my teeth look great and white. My pearly teeth are the talk of my town, and I think most people barely even know teeth whitening strips exist. They call my teeth \\&quot;city teeth.\\&quot; Which is a compliment, I guess. Use it and look sophisticated.</li>
    <li> Some reviewers seemed to get a little sensitive to using this but i had no issue at all with it. It was a pleasure to use and i have a lot of gel leftover (a whole syringe) for the next time i want to whiten my teeth. Next time will be so much easier because i already have the trays set up.</li>
    <li> People at work are talking about my teeth and asking about what I have been doing to them. That&#x27;s really cool because I have no seen that sort of attention before about my looks. I think that for a lot of people bad teeth are a dealbreaker and I would say that this is a very important part--people are starting to notice parts of me that aren&#x27;t related to my mouth as well. Will keep using this product until I stop being the envy of my work.</li>
    <li> after using crest whitestrips for the past few years I got used to the mediocreness of them. SUCH A BIG difference between the shine whitening trays and the crest whitestrips. I&#x27;m glad I made the change. I just use these like the instructions say, every 3-4 days and they&#x27;re so pearly white, the actually almost shine - but not and unnatural look either.</li>
    <li> good product. I use this product a few times a week and I&#x27;ve really noticed a difference. I will continue to purchase on a regular basis to keep my shinny pearls:)</li>
    <li> I was really impressed with the shipping of this product and how quickly the whitener works. I would recommend this product to anyone.</li>
    <li> so much easier than the strips</li>
    <li> so easy to use..i won&#x27;t go back to the strips now</li>
    <li> I have been using this product a couple times a week with great results. I apply the gel and bite down on the piece and watch an episode of television before bed. It&#x27;s easy enough and great results.</li>
    <li> I got a girls number because I talked to her. And I have my teeth to thank. She brought it up as a conversation starter and after that I was in. For that you will always have my business.</li>
    <li> Easily making this process a part of my routine. I can make the twenty minutes it takes to use this if it means my teeth look great and white. My pearly teeth are the talk of my town, and I think most people barely even know teeth whitening strips exist. They call my teeth \\&quot;city teeth.\\&quot; Which is a compliment, I guess. Use it and look sophisticated.</li>
    <li> Smiles lead to confidence and lately I have been smiling a lot more. This product is easy to use and the effects are great. Bringing positivity to my life.</li>
    <li> My friends have all noticed that my teeth look nicer. I will keep using it and I&#x27;m glad they noticed too. I just regret not finding it sooner.</li>
    <li> anyone can use shine whitening did not make my teeth sensitive at all.</li>
    <li> What a great product out of the box! My teeth used to be black and red from drinking coffee, smoking, eating hot chili peppers, and drinking Fruit Punch!  With this product, you can actually see through my teeth within only a few days (its actually quite creepy)! People and animals used too look and walk away from me, now I have confidence like no other!  Even when I am in a bad mood, I cant help but smile due to this amazing product!!</li>
    <li> this product really works. I love it.</li>
    <li> If I could give zero stars I would. This didn&#x27;t work at all!! Those that say it does either have different kind of teeth then many of us or they are lying. It did burn my gums the first two days so I thought something  must be happening. I started only doing the tops because I didn&#x27;t think there was any change. I didn&#x27;t notice any difference between top and bottom. I am upset I wasted my hard earned money as well as wasting my time sitting with uncomfortable trays in my mouth. Extremely disappointed. Wish I had the money to put towards something else. I got my daughter a kit from the dentist when she graduated high school and hers drastically changed. I wish I had read more negative reviews of this before buying instead of all the positive ones.I wish Amazon wouldn&#x27;t even sell something that doesn&#x27;t work</li>
    <li> Another great teeth whitener. The results came in today and they were flawless. I will definitely be purchasing this again and adding this to my list of whiteners. I would recommend this to anyone who wants their teeth whiten. Also, I have been getting a lot of compliments lately for my smile!</li>
    <li> I am surprised to find that whitening products work so well.It’s very surprising, a very happy surprise. Applying it was easy and simple to use. It really works.</li>
    <li> Amazing stuff.  My teeth are noticeably whiter after 3 uses.</li>
    <li> Very disappointed. The clear plastic melted when I only held it in boiling water for 5 seconds. I could not for the life of me get it to conform to my teeth. &#x3D;( I wish I could get another pair but not sure where to purchase.</li>
    <li> Only a few uses and my teeth look great already! Will keep it up!</li>
    <li> My teeth are whiter and now I’m all smiles. My mom even mentioned that she noticed that. Feel great about myself.</li>
    <li> My teeth are gleaming white after just one treatment.  My teeth were really stained from drinking coffee and tea and I gained about two shades of whiteness.  They color guide really helps show you the before and after.  Would definitely buy this product again.  Way better than white strips.</li>
    <li> Works pretty effectively, noticed slight results as soon as the first treatment. My teeth where a good 3 shades whiter after the 4th treatment. The whitening paste does make my gums sting slightly but it goes away after rinsing my mouth. Would recommend.</li>
    <li> Used this product for a couple weeks and I’m seeing great results. This is promising product and will continue to use this product.</li>
    <li> With this strips I can actually see sometimes that my teeth aren’t all getting whitened. But not so with Shine Whitening. Since the process covers your entire teeth you get great coverage and a more consistent smile across the board. Love this product.</li>
    <li> I started using this a few weeks ago and I think the results have been good. My confidence is up and people have noticed that my teeth are whiter, or at least that IÃ¢(tm)m smiling a lot more often. I find that the tray system is simple to use and fits easily in my mouth now. The gel is cool and minty. My teeth have become a bit more white and I enjoy using the product a few times a week. Will continue to use.</li>
    <li> The treatments work very well and I found it pretty easy to use this product. My teeth are now like a couple shades brighter after using it for just a week. Thanks Shine Whitening .</li>
    <li> this is the only product that took my coffee and wine stains away. SO IMPRESSED!</li>
    <li> This product Shine Whitening pretty amazing.Very effect because in  week I see some big improvement on my teeth.</li>
    <li> I’m glad I listened to other reviews on here and tried this wonderful product that I really saw the effectiveness of this stuff on my teeth. Now I have the most beautiful smile on the planet.</li>
    <li> Very nice price here. Spent a lot more on products that are much less effective. I think this is one of the better tooth related buys you can get. Really enjoying seeing the results of this. Easy to use and my smile is sparkling more than ever. Recommended.</li>
    <li> I had sensitive teeth. Lots of issues going on. Can&#x27;t even handle hot or cold foods if they are too much. So I was not looking forward to when my teeth started to look a little yellow. I got this product and it was a surprise, a welcome surprise that I had no issues with this. My teeth have been whitened and consider this a success.</li>
    <li> I was very surprised to see how fast this worked. I needed to whiten my teeth and did a bit of online research to see what the best whitening solution was. I found good results here and it did not disappoint. I am surprised to see how fast it was. Only a handful of sessions before my teeth were something like two or three times whiter than before.</li>
    <li> I have too much coffee in my life. That&#x27;s it. It is doing great things for my brain and keeping me going in life but the one downside for now is that it is yellowing my teeth a bit. I used this product to fight that and it turns out it worked. My teeth are a lot whiter now and I love it. Easy to use and fast working.</li>
    <li> saw a noticeble difference after 2 uses. Love how easy it is to use the product</li>
    <li> I am very happy with the results and will continue to use this product until I achieved the perfect white teeth that I dream of.</li>
    <li> This product was recommended to me by a colleague. I was skeptical because most products are messy, complicated or worst: do not deliver any results. I love this whitening kit! You will open the box to find a small list of instructions and directions leading you to an informational video. It is very important that you watch the video to ensure everything is done properly. It&#x27;s easy to use and you can notice results after a couple of tries. Here&#x27;s your chance to get a whiter smile for a great price!</li>
    <li> I got pretty good results after one use.</li>
    <li> I really like the tray because it is easy to use. There is really no mess you have to deal with. I would really recommend shine whitening.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always had really bad teeth, they stain pretty easily from all the coffee and wine I drink. This kit has made a huge improvement in my smile.</li>
    <li> Great Product! Tried using whitening toothpaste for my teeth but over the course of a few months, i didnt really notice a big difference in whitening..either it was doing as best it could or was stunted...so i tried this product out and after a few treatments the results are great! My smile is brighter than before and people are noticing! Great product for the value and i recommend to all my friends!</li>
    <li> Loving the trays. The system is easy to use and I would recommend it to anyone sick of strips.</li>
    <li> This product worked great. It made my teeth a little bit sensitive but did a great job whitening. I would purchase it again.</li>
    <li> Tray system is superior than strips or other methods I have seen at administering teeth whitening solution. I have tried them all and by far this is the most convenient and time-saving. Will keep using it and my teeth look great. They are whiter than ever. Loving the results. Very happy.</li>
    <li> The taste of the gel makes it worth getting this product. Does not want to make you want to gag. Will order again.</li>
    <li> I really like this product, just make sure you do not put any on your gums otherwise it may sting a little.</li>
    <li> I am really regretting I went so long without keeping up the color of my teeth but this product is doing a good job getting back my pearly white teeth before. I really miss my smile.</li>
    <li> does not hurt my teeth</li>
    <li> All I know is that my dentist suggested I use something to whiten my teeth.  She said the regular toothpaste brands were ok, but I wanted to try something a little better after not really having luck with the toothpaste brands a couple of years ago.  I tried this product and it TOTALLY worked!  Use it as directed, and you will see results the way I did.  I definitely recommend this.</li>
    <li> I followed the directions on the box to heat up the mouth trays to mold them to my teeth but I accidentally put one of the trays on my teeth incorrectly and part of it ended up molding to itself, which I could not undo because in order to be pliable, it had to be hot, and while it was hot, it was too warm to touch it long enough to pry it apart (if that was even possible at that point). This made the tray unusable.</li>
    <li> The Shine Whitening product works.  It comes with the trays and the syringes.  What it SHOULD come with - but doesn&#x27;t - is those little gauze squares that they give you at the dentist.  If they supplied that with the kit, it would be perfect.  Why?  Because you want to have your teeth as dry as possible before you apply the trays to your teeth.  Applying the trays to dry teeth make them stick better.  Other than that, the Shine product works.  I found that my teeth were a little sensitive after using the product but then again, my teeth are really sensitive.  Others with less sensitive teeth probably won&#x27;t feel a thing.</li>
    <li> I have tried every product on the market trying to get rid of my coffee and smoke stains. I also have really sensitive teeth, so its hard to find a product I can even leave on for more than 1 minute without feeling pain. This is the only product I comfortable enough to use daily that yields the results I am looking for. I have tried cheaper whiteners on the market, which didn&#x27;t cause any sensitivity to my teeth, but also didn&#x27;t produce any whitening results either!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this stuff because I saw results after only a couple applications. It is comfortable, easy to use and effective. The only complaint I have is it takes awhile to get the heat trays right, but once you do, they fit in your mouth perfectly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I would say this product whitens much better than any other product I&#x27;ve tried and its an affordable price for something that does the job right. I will definitely purchase again!</li>
    <li> So I&#x27;m the first person to order something and &amp;#34;plan&amp;#34; to use it and never get around to it but I had to post because I actually used these. I even made the molds while on lunch break at work!&lt;br /&gt;They were easy to make, instructions were right on and the trays fit perfectly.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried to use the other teeth whitening systems but they were expensive and I never saw the difference but these are a great price and actually did the job on my yellow teeth.&lt;br /&gt;Definitely recommend these if your&#x27;e considering giving teeth whitening a try.</li>
    <li> you only need a little bit to get big results.</li>
    <li> The gel is pleasant and it is successful in making my teeth whiter. I&#x27;m happy and contented with this product and will use it forever.</li>
    <li> A little messy in application but the trays are easy (literally, I was so impressed by how easy) to custom for to your mouth and the whitning gel isn&#x27;t too harsh...I didn&#x27;t experience any tooth sensitivity. Overall, quick and painless, if a little messy and drool-inducing. Quick tip:  I stuffed a couple cottonballs in my cheeks to keep the extra saliva to a minimum while I had the trays in. It cut down the mess considerably.</li>
    <li> Pretty good system, at first I thought it was going to be a hassle but it&#x27;s actually pretty easy once you get the hang of it. I use the q-tip technique mentioned and I&#x27;ve been getting an even whitening effect on my teeth.</li>
    <li> Not so with Shine. I think itÃ¢(tm)s because the tray system lets me marinate my teeth in the whitening fluid. It works and I am happy with the results.\\&quot;</li>
    <li> I am very proud of my teeth now and will continue to use this product specially when I go to a party.</li>
    <li> Nowadays it’s easier to make you white teeth because of this Shine Whitening that really works.</li>
    <li> I would take these any day of the week. Strips fall off my teeth and never properly whiten like this product. This product is awesome.</li>
    <li> I used Shine and after maybe a month it seriously looks like I had plastic surgery or something, like I had spent thousands of dollars on my look. ItÃ¢(tm)s amazing and unbelievable what a good smile does for you. I find Shine easy to use and itÃ¢(tm)s become my secret weapon to looking good.\\&quot;</li>
    <li> Whitened my teeth considerable after I quit smoking.  Used it every few days for a month.  Big difference!  The mouthpieces are a little oversized, though, and they don&#x27;t fit your teeth well.  I just spread the gel on my teeth with a qtip and then use the mouthpieces to keep myself from rubbing the gel off with my tongue or lips.  I&#x27;d recommend it.</li>
    <li> The reviews for this product are right and I&#x27;m impressed. It is true it is really effective teeth whitening even to those who have sensitive teeth.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried so many products in the store, and nothing has quite worked like this. I don&#x27;t know why my teeth have to be so difficult, but they are lol. I&#x27;ve tried 2 or 3 store brand whitening kits, and none them have worked quite as good as shine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pricing wise it&#x27;s reasonable. It&#x27;s reasonable for the fact I finally got the results I&#x27;m looking for. My teeth are pearly white, and I love it, and it lasts. Every use my teeth improve looks wise. I love it, completely worth the price.</li>
    <li> I received my product as scheduled..awesome.</li>
    <li> My smile is much more sparkling before. You can see the difference in photographs of me even a few months apart. I will never untag myself from a facebook photo again. I use this product about two or three times a week depending on how much time I have but it’s always worth it.</li>
    <li> While you are looking for teeth whitening product, I strongly recommend “shine whitening kit” with no hesitation. Unlike other teeth whitening product with only whitening strip, it comes out very professional in a dental fashion: tray kit and gel which impresses me a lot, in the mean time it’s simple to use.&lt;br /&gt;I followed the instruction with 0.5cc to each arch, and let it sit for 15 minutes, what nice about it is it had a surprisingly good taste like mint!! As most of other whitening product I have ever used, I didn’t expect it will work to some extent, BUT, I noticed my teeth are even whiter after first use. After a few days, my teeth were pleasing, all the staining were gone. My teeth is not faking shining but more towards a beautiful natural white.&lt;br /&gt;As for the price, $35 is pretty reasonable to me comparing to the dentist whitening, I will definitely use this product again when in need in future!</li>
    <li> My teeth hurt and my love life was suffering. But for some reason this stuff works for me and it will probably work for others too. Now I have whitens my teeth that I can smile all day.</li>
    <li> This whitening kit is perfect! I tried this product because my teeth had stains from drinking wine each night, I was recommended this product by my friend who has perfect white teeth, after using this product for 3 weeks my teeth were noticeably whiter, even my dentist was surprised at the state of my teeth because I usually go into the dental clinic with stained teeth. Great purchase!</li>
    <li> I never thought I could produce a big white smile again but now after using this product for 4 weeks I am comfortable smiling my face off because of the radiance and glow of my pristine white teeth that are stain free and feeling great.</li>
    <li> The tray system was easy to use and I had no issues with sensitivity or anything like that. Did it for 1 week and my teeth become whiter than before.</li>
    <li> I am not happy with this product. The bottom tray would not form to my teeth correctly even though I tried to form it a number of times. It&#x27;s a mess and a pain to use, plus it never whitened my teeth, it just made my gums feel weird. What a waste of money!!!!! I will stick to the whitening strips.</li>
    <li> I put it on a q tip and put it on my teeth. I want to use as little gel as possible so that’s why. But it works great. My teeth are whiter.</li>
    <li> I have used trays before from some other brand, they didn&#x27;t work for me too well I got the goop all over and everywhere. These ones are pretty good, no mess and easy to use no argument on whether or not it works. But for me it really works and no debate.</li>
    <li> This system from Shine Whitening  has a mouth tray that keeps everything in place, and is very affordable. The product has a better option than strips or bleaching.  Strips work from my experience but it is tough to stick in my mouth and stay there.Higly recommend.</li>
    <li> You get a lot of product for what you need. It is worth the money.</li>
    <li> I have whiter teeth thanks to Shine Whitening. The system is easy to use and very effective.</li>
    <li> I just received my kit yesterday but overall very happy with it. The kit seems to come with a lot of whitening. I will be happy to post my results soon.</li>
    <li> You have to do a little bit of work up front with putting the tray into hot water and letting it mold into your mouth but itÃ¢(tm)s worth it because it feels good and makes it that much easier to apply. The tray fits right in your mouth and itÃ¢(tm)s very comfortable. Other systems IÃ¢(tm)ve used in the past do not feel as comfortable and I have seen similar results from Shine than I do with other products. Worth it in my opinion, if you can actually use the product.</li>
    <li> I was initially skeptical about this product as I&#x27;ve used other whitening products in the past without lasting results. Shine Whitening erased any skepticism by simply showing me that it works. After carefully following the instructions and avoiding my two cups of black coffee a day for the last 10 days, I&#x27;ve seen noticeable results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I must add that there was minor teeth sensitivity at the beginning but after using less gel and wearing the mouthpiece for a shorter time, I no longer noticed the sensitivity. But overall, this is a great product at a great price that I would absolutely recommend. I&#x27;ll definitely continue to use it.</li>
    <li> I feel better about myself and I feel more confident in my conversation and actions. Everything is better and it all started with my teeth. Really love this product.</li>
    <li> I use a q-tip and apply it because I don&#x27;t like putting the tray in my mouth. The system works well for that because the gel comes separately. There is no way I would have been able to do this with strips or another method.</li>
    <li> Great price here. I have bought many different whitening solutions from the store and online and this is a particularly good deal. I have used it for many months and it has always come through. My teeth look great and I recommend this product to anyone who wants to see a better smile on their face.</li>
    <li> I brush my teeth twice daily and yet never seem to get the result that i have wanted. I am glad that i got this item. And my teeth become 3 shades whiter in all about one week.&lt;br /&gt;This teeth whitening kit really works. Using it is so easy. It comes with 2 syringe with gel inside. Just apply this gel to your mouth piece and place it in your mouth for 10-15 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;Do this daily for best results. The gel does not have any weird taste or smell. Infact it tasted like my arm and hammer toothpaste. I loved the result and will recommend this to any one with yellow teeth problem. I was lucky to receive this for my honest opinion</li>
    <li> This is easy to use. The tray system is great and simple. It makes a lot more sense and causes less garbage than other strips or whatnot. Recommended.</li>
    <li> Putting my teeth out there. Smiling a lot more after using this teeth whitening product. Really elevating my day.</li>
    <li> This is a simple and easy way to whiten your teeth. The tray system is good and might take some work but it is good for you in the end. Molds to your teeth.</li>
    <li> Gel works great but the trays are flimsy and don&#x27;t form well to crooked teeth</li>
    <li> I was offered this Shine Whitening Professional Teeth Whitening Kit for a great deal to try and share my honest opinion about it. I ordered this kit and tried it out as soon as it arrived. I have used it for about 10 consecutive days with a day or 2 missed. This kit is very easy to use and it doesn&#x27;t have a super nasty taste either. I am super excited because I have gone down a few shades in just that short time. I definitely recommend this Teeth Whitening Kit from Shine Whitening for anyone who wants whiter teeth.</li>
    <li> Happy that I tried this out, based on the reviews it seemed like people were having some success but a few other people were having sensitive gums. I was one of the people who had both, but I just followed the instructions and the gum sensitivity went away. Basically what you have to do is wait between treatments, dont&#x27; try to whitenen your teeth daily! I had the same problem with the Crest whitestrips, frankly every teeth whitening product will cause some sensitivity. The best method to prevent this is to just wait between treatments a few days.... I did this and I haven&#x27;t had any issues. Also applying the solution just beneath the gum line with a que-tip helps a lot.</li>
    <li> Nice product... In fact, value for money... I didn&#x27;t feel like spending several hundred dollars on the dentist visit and that&#x27;s what made me purchase this magical kit.. It is as effective as the treatment the dentists apply and I got 4 shades light as desired... The only cons is that you have to do it yourself at home.. which takes you only 20 minutes... :)</li>
    <li> could really see the difference.</li>
    <li> Very inventive. Strips are kind of a bummer but this process was easy enough. Nice porduct.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used it a few times and I can see a small difference in my teeth , seems like a pretty solid product overall</li>
    <li> I have a hard time sticking strips onto my teeth. But this is different. It is easy to use and works effectively on your teeth. Very happy with the result.</li>
    <li> I thought the price was decent for what you get in the package. The stuff works pretty good, and you get dentist grade stuff too. I wouldnÃ¢(tm)t bother with the strips anymore. These are so much better.</li>
    <li> Best teeth whitening product for the price. The syringes make for a non messy application and I have no tooth sensitivity from using this product. I would say my teeth have gotten 3 shades lighter with just 2 applications. So yeah this definitely works.</li>
    <li> went to my dentist and they do the exact same thingÃ¢Â¦ EXACT SAME treatment using the exact same devices. This was a tenth the price</li>
    <li> I didnt know that I could handle a whitening treatment because I always thought it was too had to use, but dont worry. Its easy.</li>
    <li> On day 7 and see no results. This is junk. The trays either melt if left in the hot water too long or don&#x27;t mold if removed too soon. Pay a little more and but something better.</li>
    <li> It fits in my mouth perfectly if you do the work up top then it will for you too. I watch an episode of a sitcom while my teeth whiten about three times a week and the results speak for themselves. Great product</li>
    <li> I am about three shades lighter than before. Very satisfied and I find this product to be very affordable for what it does.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always flossed and brushed a few times a day but unfortunately my love of coffee and other dark staining foods have made keep my teeth white very hard. I feel like I was very lucky to find Shine Whitening professional teeth whitening kit! When they say professional they meant it.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had my teeth whitened several times and the 15 minutes a day with this product was quite a bit easier! None of that burning sensation, that has to be the worst part of teet whitening. I used the product for the ten days suggested and was very happy with the results. I believe my teeth were a few shades whiter than promised. That&#x27;s awesome! I have not quit drinking coffee, but in another month I know I can by another batch of Shine Whitening and everything will be great and shiny again!!</li>
    <li> I got a girls number because I talked to her. And I have my teeth to thank. She brought it up as a conversation starter and after that I was in. For that you will always have my business.</li>
    <li> This product is minty fresh and it&#x27;s great because I look forward to using this product. I use it about two or three times a week and since it tastes pretty nice and refreshing, I don&#x27;t consider it a chore, really. It works great and my teeth are noticeably whiter than when i started. Glad to be using this.</li>
    <li> Ive giving 5 stars for a great product, finally found of these on Amaxon which actually works.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband and he really likes it. He said it was okay for people with sensitive teeth. He would really recommend this product</li>
    <li> Will never use again &amp; cannot recommend this whitening kit.&lt;br /&gt;With every use, gums would burn. Back to the strips.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for about a week now and have already noticed a difference in the color of my teeth. It was easy to use and for the price, is a very good value, as compared to other products on the market. I have very sensitive gums and the trays did not cause any pain to them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this product to anybody looking for whiter teeth. The reason why I gave it 4 stars and not 5 is because after removing the trays from my teeth, my mouth was a bit dry. But I can’t 100% say it was because of the gel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, highest recommendation and is a great value for the price!</li>
    <li> I was really impressed with how quickly my teeth started to look whiter only after a couple of uses. I love it.</li>
    <li> The gel is very pleasant and has a nice minty finish. I really enjoy using this product, it&#x27;s like getting to wash my mouth out again and that&#x27;s pretty cool. I have entered this product into my routine and will continue to use it. It&#x27;s a good experience all around and I get to feel my teeth getting whiter and whiter. It&#x27;s a no lose situation. Works better than strips in my opinion.</li>
    <li> tried shine whitening because I heard good things..I was nervouse about how sensitve the strips were going to make my teeth BUT it totally didn&#x27;t. 2 thumbs up!</li>
    <li> My friends have been asking me about my teeth. This is because they used to make fun of me for having less than white teeth. But now they are all asking me about it! Well I won&#x27;t tell them but I will tell you guys, I use this about three times a week.</li>
    <li> I had a bad smoking habit for many years, which left my teeth looking not so great. But after a few weeks of using this product, they are starting to turn back around. Here&#x27;s to hoping I can reverse it even more.</li>
    <li> Smiles lead to confidence and lately I have been smiling a lot more. This product is easy to use and the effects are great. Bringing positivity to my life.</li>
    <li> I love my pearly whites now.</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re luckly you might see a bit of different with just a single treatment, but what I found Is that you are best to buy two to get a second treatmentand do the second one two weeks after. Obviously brush your teeth every day twice a day in between.</li>
    <li> My confidence is up after using this product. White teeth are a good thing to see and it makes people respect you more.</li>
    <li> I was a heavy coffee drinker before and my teeth have yellowed because of that that&#x27;s i try to use teeth whitener. After using Shine whitening I feel great about my teeth and showing them off to people. I get comments from my family that they’ve noticed a difference and that feels great.</li>
    <li> This product is for people who maybe have tried strips and they keep falling out of your mouth or off your teeth and need something to keep the whitening gel inside your mouth. Try this one.</li>
    <li> I’ve seen similar products with similar results for a lot more money. But this is difference, it&#x27;s very cheap but more effective than another brand.</li>
    <li> It works very well and does not slip off my teeth. This product is great and I will continue using this stuff.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only ever used the Crest whitestrips before I tried Shine Whitening; I have to tell you, they work really well (much better than I first expected). Definitely worth the money - especially when comparing to Crest</li>
    <li> I highly recommend picking up shine whitening because of the great results I&#x27;ve gotten and absolutely no side effects.. A lot better than other more expensive brands without a doubt.</li>
    <li> My teeth are so white that I always keep smiling so that all people can see my beautiful pearly white teeth.</li>
    <li> A couple treatments a week keep my mouth look pretty white than when I not used this product.</li>
    <li> I feel so much more confident going into a new year because I&#x27;m having now the most beautiful teeth to go into parties.</li>
    <li> This is a great price for what it does.It is very effective and not expensive as those other brands.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m drinking way too much coffee and smoking too many cigarettes but I&#x27;m not worried because I have this Shine Whitening to solve the problem.</li>
    <li> Got the product last weekend and was pretty surprised by how fast it worked! It is really strong so be careful not to put too much of the solution in the trays. Other than that I really like it</li>
    <li> I’m so angry at myself for not finding this product earlier. I drink so much coffee that they can’t keep it coming fast enough. My teeth were yellow as the sun. I couldn’t use other methods because they all sucked. My teeth hurt and my love life was suffering. But for some reason Shine Whitening  works for me and it will probably work for others too. Now I have a sparkly smile and all I do is regret I didn’t find this three years earlier. My longtime gf left me and I suspect part of it was because of my teeth (I’m british). That should be endorsement enough. A Brit said it works, mate. Cheers.</li>
    <li> I guess I have a small mouth, but I can&#x27;t use these trays at all. I tried using without the trays but didn&#x27;t see much difference. I bought this because other whitening products tend to bother my gums. This didn&#x27;t bother at all, but without seeing a noticeable change it doesn&#x27;t really matter.</li>
    <li> Stick with it, it works eventually.</li>
    <li> The gel is very pleasant and has a nice minty finish. I really enjoy using this product, it&#x27;s like getting to wash my mouth out again and that&#x27;s pretty cool. I have entered this product into my routine and will continue to use it. It&#x27;s a good experience all around and I get to feel my teeth getting whiter and whiter. It&#x27;s a no lose situation. Works better than strips in my opinion.</li>
    <li> I like the mouth tray systemÃ¢\\&quot;I find it very convenient and easy to use. I will continue to use this product until the end of time, until my teeth are just permanently white. If I keep using Shine maybe that will happen, based on past results.</li>
    <li> Does not work at all. Even went so far as to leave it in longer and put more on the mouth piece. This product is a waste of money.</li>
    <li> The tray system feels pretty good in the mouth. You have to stick it under a faucet or in a bowl of hot water and then let it form in your mouth, so itÃ¢(tm)s almost like a soft plastic pillow for your teeth. Let it sit there for a while, and then itÃ¢(tm)s just done. You have a personal piece of oral hygiene. That way when you insert the gel into the piece and then put it back in your mouth for two to three times a week, you can just chomp down on it and play video games or something, instead of worrying if the strips will fall out of your teeth. The results are similar to other whitening products so this is a no duh moment.</li>
    <li> My teeth are noticeably whiter now after using this product twice a week for a few weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enjoying the results. My smile looks great and the tray system I found to be very easy to use.</li>
    <li> Extremely uncomfortable if you have a small mouth, even after softening</li>
    <li> Strips fall out of my teeth. End of story. It’s like trying to put bumper stickers in there. This system works bar none. Try it out.</li>
    <li> I drink so much coffee so this product is a life saver for me. My teeth are back to normal white now:)</li>
    <li> When I started this, I had pretty yellow teeth. People would tell me at work that I should try to whiten them but I didn&#x27;t want to pay my dentist 250 bucks to do it. So did some research and I decided to try Shine.. at first it felt a little weird, I never tried something like this before, and you have to put trays into your mouth and hold them there for about 10 -15 minutes. But after the first session I got the hang of it, and now have done it 6 times. I must stay it&#x27;s a pretty rewarding experience - although it&#x27;s not fun doing it, after you do it your teeth are really much whiter than before! I&#x27;m happy to have tried this and will keep doing it when necessary. People are work have noticed and congratulated me!</li>
    <li> I used this product with the expectation that it would take a few weeks—I mean my teeth slowly got less and less white as time went on and I thought it might take a while. But no!</li>
    <li> Strips kept falling out of my mouth. I used the strips by Crest and they really just kept slipping off my teeth. Shine has a system where you stick a thing in your mouth so itÃ¢(tm)s just that much easier. You keep the mouth guard around like a toothbrush or something, like an appliance. I think itÃ¢(tm)s worth it to keep it around just based on ease of use.</li>
    <li> this product work after only one use. This is best product for whitening. Will recommend</li>
    <li> The first thing people notice now is my teeth! I&#x27;ve always been a heavy smoker (product of the 70s) so I&#x27;ve had pretty yellow teeth for the past decade. I&#x27;ve occasionally went in for professional whitening jobs from my dentist but these are really too expensive to doo frequently. I&#x27;m glad I found Shine Whitening because it&#x27;s a fraction of the cost and basically the same process.</li>
    <li> tried shine whitening because I heard good things..I was nervouse about how sensitve the strips were going to make my teeth BUT it totally didn&#x27;t. 2 thumbs up!</li>
    <li> made m my teeth a little bit sensitive but could really see a difference within a few uses</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive teeth so I was a little nervous about trying the gel instead of the strips. It works SOO much better than the strips. It made my teeth a little sensitive but bearable. I think this product is high quality.</li>
    <li> I am a smoker, so needless to say my teeth are quite stained... or should I say, &amp;#34;WERE&amp;#34; quite stained! I recently was going to be Maid Of Honor in my Sister&#x27;s wedding and felt very self conscious about how my smile was going to look in all those wedding pictures. Having tried other products such as Crest 3D Whitestrips and supposed whitening toothpastes with little to no avail, I was thinking I would just have to suffer the embarrassment of yellowed, dingy teeth. Going for professional treatments at my dentist was out of the question due to time and expense.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After researching and reading other reviews, I decided to give Shine Whitening a try. It was a real life saver! Instructions were very thorough, mouth piece easy to fit and comfortable, but most importantly the results were great. Noticeable to everyone, not just me looking in the mirror seeing what I wanted to see!  I highly recommend this product if you are looking for results</li>
    <li> I recommended him this Shine Whitening to whiten his teeth because they looked a little yellow on the dailies. Well he got this stuff and to my advise it really help his yellowish teeth. Now he has confidence to smile.</li>
    <li> I started using Shine Whitening and people are talking about my teeth how white my teeth are. Too bad there’s no such thing as a teeth model. But even though I will like to be the first.</li>
    <li> Very easy to use and affordable! Works a lot better than the other teeth whiteners that I have used in the past! Quicker results that last a lot longer per use. From my experience, the teeth trays fit perfectly in my mouth when I heated them.</li>
    <li> my teeth are SOOOO sensitive so I don&#x27;t whiten them that often. This product is amazing for people like me.</li>
    <li> This didnt work for me.  Either because my teeth were not that yellow or I needed something stronger .</li>
    <li> Teeth have started to glow. Lol. Not really, but they&#x27;re so much whiter than they used to be. Thanks.</li>
    <li> I used to go to the mall every few months to get my teeth whitened, until I realized that the same exact product is being sold only for a lot cheaper. It&#x27;s basically the same except there&#x27;s nobody there to help you do it - so if you know what you&#x27;re doing or can read instructions this a good product for you. You&#x27;ll save some money and get the same whitening experience.</li>
    <li> I have been using it for 2 months or so and I&#x27;ve seen a tiny whitening in my teeth.. a tiny bit of burning on use also.</li>
    <li> Good system here. I have tried a handful of other ones and this one has been by far the most convenient. The trays fit easily into my mouth and I enjoy using it--very simple. Recommended for if you need to whiten your teeth up a bit, and who of us doesn&#x27;t need that, to be honest?</li>
    <li> Thank you for allowing me to drink coffee on a regular basis. I love the fact that my stains are gone.</li>
    <li> Ive giving 5 stars for a great product, finally found of these on Amaxon which actually works.</li>
    <li> I did this for a few sessions and my teeth look great already. Recommended!</li>
    <li> My teeth are much better now. Thanks a ton.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t do much good and trays are uncomfortable</li>
    <li> All of these 5-Star reviews were written within one week of each other.  If you look at the reviewers other reviews, most of them have none and some of them trash other whitening kits while linking to this one saying it is great.  Smells pretty fishy if you ask me.</li>
    <li> If you look at the Crest 3D White Whitestrips reviews, the top review was written on January 10th 2014. The manufacturers of this product (or someone else who wants to promote this product) gave the Crest Strips a pretty negative review (though it was 3 stars), and linked this product in the review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is no coincidence that all these reviews and that review just randomly occurred in a 2 week span.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To test this, I purchased the product to try it out myself to see if these &amp;#34;reviews&amp;#34; were legit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not a chance. I used this product for 20 minutes a day. First few days, no results, no big deal right? First week no visible change. 2 weeks- no visible change. A little less than a month and I did notice some change from before I started (I took pictures), but it was hardly noticeable. Bad taste, not effective, fairly tedious setup compared to the Whitestrips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would have given this product 2 stars, but due to these fake reviews I was just outraged. I have emailed Amazon about this, but have not received a response. This company is scamming people into buying their product, and deterring people from buying the Crest Whitestrips (in my opinion were MUCH more effective and a better product). DO NOT BUY THIS- IT&#x27;S A SCAM!</li>
    <li> I must say the reviews are true, it really works for me. My teeth are now white than before</li>
    <li> There is even much better option to make your teeth white than going to the dentist. Just try this Shine as i do and you will not regret it.</li>
    <li> Its really a good timing that my teeth are now very white for our graduation day and photoshoot.  Thanks alot for this.</li>
    <li> It really whitens my teeth and its very safe to my gums. I can smile now perfectly.</li>
    <li> this works so much better than the strips…I don&#x27;t have to use the kit as often to get the same results</li>
    <li> Yellow teeth are gross… no good. If I don&#x27;t like being around it, imagine what it was like when one day my sister made fun of mine for being discolored. I went into panic mode and fiddled around with whitening strips, which kept falling off my teeth. But i found this product and the way that it is done, it never falls off my teeth. I am smiling right now a lot more.</li>
    <li> My classmate at my school  complimented that my teeth are bright and I think my selfie will come out good. I used this product though after my mom got it for me and my teeth are whiter than before. I am very happy with product.</li>
    <li> Looks expensive, but it&#x27;s not for what you get. Teeth are whiter with just one use. Great value.</li>
    <li> I have sensitive teeth. I am worried they would hurt. I can barely eat cold things. But I didn&#x27;t have any issues with this product. Very happy with results and I didn&#x27;t know I would be able to use any whitening. But that&#x27;s not true.</li>
    <li> Been using this for a week so far and really happy with the results!&lt;br /&gt;Very gentle on my teeth unlike the strips. Doesn&#x27;t irritate or burn. Worth it completely!</li>
    <li> my smile is 100 times brighter than before. Best kit I&#x27;ve used so far</li>
    <li> I thought it would take a while to get going but Shine Whitening has a good turnaround. A few days later and you can visibly see a difference in my teeth.</li>
    <li> I got the box and the first time using it, i realized the directions on the box could be much clearer than they are. Even though the directions weren&#x27;t as clear I did see results in a few days. The only other problem I had was that I needed to use a towel to catch the drool from my mouth. It was pretty uncomfortable. 3 stars goes to Shine Whitening due to the poor directions and having to use a towel to catch the drool. I did enjoy using and the results from this product.</li>
    <li> So I&#x27;m a former smoker (7 years, oy vey!), drink lots of coffee and red wine every week. On top of that my teeth were stained from wearing braces for 3 years. They aren&#x27;t too bad, just a little dull in color (although my dentist tells me I&#x27;ve got some stains on the back of my front teeth from smoking).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Found this product and decided to give it a shot. Totally satisfied with the results! I&#x27;m on my third week and I can see a big improvement from when I started. I&#x27;ve got two missing molars but the trays fit pretty good, had no trouble heating them up. The gel doesn&#x27;t taste bad which is a big plus compared to other whitening products I&#x27;ve tried (Rembrandt).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I try to get the most bang for my buck, so I left the trays in for the full 30 minutes and would watch an episode of Seinfeld (make sure you get your important conversations out of the way, lol). By the end of my 1st week I was already noticing the results as one of my stains from wearing braces faded away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I feel better about myself. My boyfriend likes the change and he&#x27;s probably going to do a cycle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;QUESTION: Does anybody know if I should use this with a specific mouthwash? Flouride maybe? idk.</li>
    <li> Quick results with this one. I have sensitive teeth and sometimes have issues with feeling hurt over silly things like a cup of water with ice in it, even. But I have had no issues so far with this product. I would recommend it to people with sensitive teeth and even people without sensitive teeth. it worked in a timely fashion, very fast. I would recommend it to anyone trying to whiten their teeth.</li>
    <li> I wanted to impress my date and guess what she was. I got a compliment on my teeth.Very effective product.</li>
    <li> Coworkers are talking about my smile. I even got the cute girl&#x27;s number at the bar. My teeth are whiter than ever and my confidence is at an all time high.</li>
    <li> I am smiling for all the ladies now. To use this product you do need to do a little bit of work up top with molding the tray to fit your mouth, but after that it&#x27;s all downhill. Everything is great. My teeth are whiter and the treatments only take a few minutes each. Recommended.</li>
    <li> Enamel degrades over time, there&#x27;s no denying this. And the original color of our teeth underneath is actually yellow. But no doubt a white smile looks better than a yellow one. Use this product to help that out. I did and I love it.</li>
    <li> I only use it twice a week and the results are great. I have used other teeth whitening solutions and most of them, for the same results I would have to use it at least three times a week. Will keep using this because of the potency of the solution and also the technique of the trays, it keeps everything in my teeth, in my mouth.</li>
    <li> I am using this product for about a few weeks now and my smile is beaming around to everyone. Looks great and I really look happier. People are not just talking about my teeth, but my entire demeanor.</li>
    <li> Strips are glopy and get all over the place. This product is clean and everything fits in the tray easily. It&#x27;s simple and works. No need to get overly fancy and messy.</li>
    <li> I’m not sure there’s a better system for that, since everybody has a different sized mouth and teeth. Once that’s out of the way this is the easiest teeth whitening product by far to use.</li>
    <li> Whitening strips are not better by a long margin. I would take these any day of the week. Strips fall off my teeth and never properly whiten like this product.</li>
    <li> This is part of looking good every day. Whiter teeth leads to a better look. I use this about three times a week and I feel great about my teeth</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive teeth with many issues. I cannot even drink cold water without having it kind of pang. So I was very cautious when it came to my teeth becoming yellow. I have tried some other products before like strips and bleaching but it&#x27;s just too painful. I used this item here sparingly and my teeth feel great. They are whiter and I only apply a little bit at a time, but so far I have zero issues with it. No problems. Godsend.</li>
    <li> My enamel is yellowing and making my smiles look less than 100 percent. So I went ahead and did this product and it has worked for me. My smile is brighter and I&#x27;m proud of my teeth again.</li>
    <li> I find myself smiling a lot more now that I know that my teeth are whiter. People are noticing me smiling a lot more and I think I am being a positive influence on my peers and friends. Everyone around me seems more happy. I started using this only a few weeks ago for a handful of sessions. I would say the technique is good and a good system in place to get your teeth looking better.</li>
    <li> I continually use this product throughout the week and it keeps my teeth baby white, like I just came out of the womb. I have gotten many comliments and I am too embarrassed to admit it&#x27;s a teeth whitening solution but here it isÃ¢Â¦ I&#x27;m here to tell you guys and recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive teeth and sometimes it’s hard for me to use teeth whitening things because they always hurt my mouth. But so far I have no issues with this product after using it for about three weeks. My teeth are whiter and I will continue to use it. Since my teeth are sensitive, I have cut down the use of this product to about twice a week, if not once a week. I recommend doing the same if you have sensitive teeth but I am playing it safe.</li>
    <li> I’m smiling a lot more and my confidence is up, thanks to Shine Whitening. I use it twice a week and had no problems with the trays. My teeth were yellowing a little bit and I wanted to counteract that of course. I found that the amount of gel I needed wasn’t much to have decent results. I will continue to use this product into the near future.</li>
    <li> Love shin whitening. Made my teeth look 3 shades lighter I&#x27;m impressed.</li>
    <li> this is the only product that took my coffee and wine stains away. SO IMPRESSED!</li>
    <li> I have tried many other teeth whitening products that didn&#x27;t work well at all. I was unsure if this one was going to work - most of them don&#x27;t whiten properly and make your teeth sensitive. I am happy to announce that Shine whitening works well for me.</li>
    <li> You know the supermodels with perfect teeth? Now I have them. This stuff works like a charm.</li>
    <li> I’m very happy with the results. Found the system easy to use and everything is great. Thank you Shine zero for making my teeth as white as a pearl.</li>
    <li> I needed my white teeth to be seen from the back row, if you know what I mean. So i decided to to take a try this stuff. And to my surprise it really work. My teeth are now so beautiful that all will really look at me.</li>
    <li> My teeth are shinier and I feel more confident  to smile in the mall, my office and many places that I want to see to the people my beautiful teeth. I love this stuff and I Like it.</li>
    <li> After using this stuff the results are very noticeable after a couple weeks and I am very happy with what i see in the mirror.</li>
    <li> A lot of companies don’t think about this part because all their gels and creams and whatnot are all just floating around in my mouth and it’s really gross. The tray system Shine Whitening works with keeps everything in the tray.</li>
    <li> Love shin whitening. Made my teeth look 3 shades lighter I&#x27;m impressed.</li>
    <li> I wasnÃ¢(tm)t so sure about these when I bought them, I thought it was a little expensive compared to everything else out there but then I got the package in the mail and it looked very profressional. I&#x27;ve seen the stuff that my dentist uses with people and it costs like $300 for just one treatment with him. I tried it out the other tday and what can I say other than it weas amazing, and so much better than I thought when I first bought it. The pictures do not do it justice.</li>
    <li> Years of coffee has wrecked my teeth. They are all yellow and not appealing. But I used this product a handful of times and so far so good. It worked much faster than expected. My teeth are looking great every single day. I can keep my coffee and also use this stuff here. Glad to see it works.</li>
    <li> If I use this twice a week it makes me look great, I mainly also use it before dates and so far it has not done me wrong. My teeth are pretty good looking.</li>
    <li> I would say there&#x27;s pretty well no reason to brush anymore other than the obvious reason to get rid of the plaque. But oh my does this ever whiten your teeth.</li>
    <li> Using this as my routine now. I thought my teeth looked fine before, but after using it for a few weeks I have unlocked the real power of it and people have been noticing my chompers, namely members of the opposite sex. I still need my charms but it&#x27;s a great conversation starter. I only use it a few times a week, probably two or three. Good investment.</li>
    <li> I bought three thinking I would need a couple with the crazy stains I have on my teeth but they were gone with just one. Fantastic results here.</li>
    <li> Strips are annoying nuisance. They constantly fall out of my mouth and give me problems. I find myself readjusting them a lot and then the solution just keeps hitting my tongue and dissolving into my mouth. It&#x27;s very annoying but since this has mouth trays you do not encounter that sort of problem here.</li>
    <li> Comes with a lot of product. You get what you pay for!</li>
    <li> Had stains for years. Used other products and they worked out similar to Shine but Shine has a better system and is cheaper by a little bit. The gel is cool feeling and has a mint taste, and the mouth system is easier to use than anything so far. Recommended.</li>
    <li> I have found this product works very fast and that&#x27;s good because sometimes I need whiter teeth in a hurry like if I need to be at a job interview I want to look my best. Easy to use and great results.</li>
    <li> The formula has a nice taste and I enjoy using it. I&#x27;m happy it also whitens my teeth. Very fast, good results.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s nice to see white teeth in my mouth after so many years of a yellowish tint. It&#x27;s great and I recommend giving this one a try if you want that.</li>
    <li> The mouth piece takes some set up but other than that itÃ¢(tm)s really simple and easy to use. I use it twice a week and my results have been steadily climbing. My smile is brighter and I feel more confident thanks to Shine.</li>
    <li> I like to use this every couple months. Im a really heavy coffee drinker and shine whitener really helps get rid of 99% of the stains.</li>
    <li> These are worth the price and are very gentle on my gums. I would recommend this product and will continue to use it:)</li>
    <li> Ever get that craving for a coffee and a muffin. My god. Basically every single say I have one.. Or two. Thiss really helped me out keep my teeth white,.</li>
    <li> I used this product and finally found a product that does what it says without the burning of other products. My teeth are extremely sensitive, so I have to be careful what I use. This product gave me whiter teeth in just a few uses and I never had the sensitivity like I have experienced  with other whitening trays. The trays mold well and are pretty sturdy so you can use them for a long time. Well worth the price, especially if you need something gentle but effective.</li>
    <li> Had picture day coming up and it is always a horror show. But now that my teeth look great I will flash them for the camera and I feel great and confident.</li>
    <li> My guess is that if I do not keep up with the whitening treatments then my teeth will again slowly start to turn yellow like they were before, That&#x27;s why even my teeth are whiter now, will still use this stuff.</li>
    <li> This Shine teeth whitening is very convenient and easy to use. No hassle and very effective.</li>
    <li> I really like this product because how simple and convenient to use this teeth whitening. Nice buy.</li>
    <li> The kit is really good. I had a really bad experience with whiten strips and wanted to make sure I try a different type of product. I really like the tray because it&#x27;s actually stays on your teeth instead of swallowing it (like the strips).</li>
    <li> I would recommend this Shine Whitening over strips or other systems that are inefficient, as well. I have used this product myself and enjoyed it very much. Will continue using it.</li>
    <li> It works very fast. Strange. After a week of use every other day my teeth are considerably whiter. Will continue to use.</li>
    <li> I am going easy on it because I don’t know how strong the gel was but even in smaller amounts it seemed to get the job done. Will keep using and update.</li>
    <li> I wanted something that I could set it and let it do its job. This product here for you. I play Minecraft while I used this stuff to whiten my teeth. It&#x27;s so easy to use.</li>
    <li> There is an extra gel for strengthening enamel. I use it but not sure if it works, because I haven’t used it without. Will not experiment. Just follow the directions because it is working. My teeth are whiter and it feels good to smile and know people are looking at my white teeth.</li>
    <li> Bought these for my mom who is a chronic smoker and coffee drinker. She drinks half a pot a day and smokes a pack and a half a day. Saw her for Mother’s Day and I said to her “Hey good job your mouth looks great I’m glad you stopped smoking and drinking so much coffee.” Well she didn’t. She just used Shine Whitening , which I forgot that I had purchased for her. So that’s proof this stuff works. Her mouth looked great, our photos looked like they were from 30 years ago. She still smokes a lot and I wish she would stop. The coffee is fine I guess. But her mouth is amazing. She says she pops it in and takes it out after the first commercial break during Days of Our Lives. Second commercial break is when she takes a smoke break. I wish there was aShine Whitening  for getting someone to quit smoking, because this stuff is so effective.</li>
    <li> I like this product much more than the strips. The trays are comfortable and easy to use (they actually stay in unlike the strips). I found my teeth where so much whiter after a week of using it everyday. I am very happy with the purchase.</li>
    <li> I started using this a few weeks ago and I think the results have been good. My confidence is up and people have noticed that my teeth are whiter, or at least that IÃ¢(tm)m smiling a lot more often. I find that the tray system is simple to use and fits easily in my mouth now. The gel is cool and minty. My teeth have become a bit more white and I enjoy using the product a few times a week. Will continue to use.</li>
    <li> This product is minty fresh and it&#x27;s great because I look forward to using this product. I use it about two or three times a week and since it tastes pretty nice and refreshing, I don&#x27;t consider it a chore, really. It works great and my teeth are noticeably whiter than when i started. Glad to be using this.</li>
    <li> So the treatments worked REALLY well. I saw a big change after the third treatment but I had a little sensitivity after each oneÃ¢Â¦ my teeth are normally sensitive and I find even the whitestrips make my teeth sensitive. 5 Stars for the excellent work it did making my teeth white though.</li>
    <li> You know what? I have found myself smiling more at work. I think I am bolstered by my coworker’s comments about my bright teeth. I started using this product about two weeks ago and the results are apparent. My teeth are shinier and I feel more confident around the office. It’s a great solution.</li>
    <li> Overall teeth are important, and it part of your face. Like if you had acne, you would get it treated. So why not yellowing teeth? Bleaching at the dentist’s office is an expensive procedure. But at a fraction of the price Shine Whitening  does a great job of whitening those teeth. I used it because it was affordable and I am a happy camper. It really is one of those intangible elements that gets a look together. I’m more likely to smile, more likely to look good, more likely to feel confident. Will continue to use this product.</li>
    <li> went to my dentist and they do the exact same thingÃ¢Â¦ EXACT SAME treatment using the exact same devices. This was a tenth the price</li>
    <li> There is pretty good value here. Nice price and believe me I have purchased so many other whitening solutions. This one works well too.</li>
    <li> Five stars. I smoked for so many years that it made my teeth look horrible. A few sessions in on this and I look a lot better. Thanks!</li>
    <li> This is minty fresh. Really like it and I find it pretty enjoyable. That&#x27;s good because whiting teeth is a good thing and if the experience as a whole is nice then I am more inclined to do the chore. I have used it for a few weeks and it&#x27;s pleasant. My teeth look a lot better and i&#x27;m glad they are making it easy for me to keep it up.</li>
    <li> I have sensitive teeth and there are no issues with that right now. Shine Whitening is one of the few products that do not affect my teeth.</li>
    <li> It worked for me and it should work for most people. Try it and you will believe it.</li>
    <li> Let me start this off by saying this teeth whitening kit is amazing! After using this kit, I noticed a big difference in my teeth the very first time I used it, my teeth looked like I had them professionally whitened. This kit was very easy to use, the trays fit like a glove after heated, and the greatest part about this kit is it is reasonably priced. I am very happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> Very happy with the results and I recommend this product to others. Try this product and see see the the beautiful experience of having the white teeth you ever dream of.</li>
    <li> Just like using the whitestrips for about a half a year solidÃ¢Â¦ oy. Except this only took about 15 minutes of my time. ItÃ¢(tm)s a great product really.</li>
    <li> I continually use this product throughout the week and it keeps my teeth baby white, like I just came out of the womb. I have gotten many comliments and I am too embarrassed to admit it&#x27;s a teeth whitening solution but here it is… I&#x27;m here to tell you guys and recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I wasnÃ¢(tm)t so sure about these when I bought them, I thought it was a little expensive compared to everything else out there but then I got the package in the mail and it looked very profressional. I&#x27;ve seen the stuff that my dentist uses with people and it costs like $300 for just one treatment with him. I tried it out the other tday and what can I say other than it weas amazing, and so much better than I thought when I first bought it. The pictures do not do it justice.</li>
    <li> It actually tastes minty when you use it, not like other whitening gels that taste like chemicals which i dont really want to put on my teeth.Five stars.</li>
    <li> Some people have sensitivity issues with this product. I donÃ¢(tm)t. But I still only use it two times a week because it works well at that rate for me. I like the tray system and I think itÃ¢(tm)s pretty neat way of keeping the gel in your mouth.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s probably killing me, but at least I&#x27;ll have white teeth!  Works great. Did irritate my gums so I used a Q-tip to apply. Now no problem.</li>
    <li> Some reviewers seemed to get a little sensitive to using this but i had no issue at all with it. It was a pleasure to use and i have a lot of gel leftover (a whole syringe) for the next time i want to whiten my teeth. Next time will be so much easier because i already have the trays set up.</li>
    <li> I really like the tray because it is easy to use. There is really no mess you have to deal with. I would really recommend shine whitening.</li>
    <li> I used it for about a month and my teeth seem to be back to normal. They are whiter and the gel has a nice taste. Will continue to use this product. Thanks for forgiving me for my past vices.</li>
    <li> For someone who drinks coffee and wine on a regular basis product really made a difference. I noticed a pretty siginificant different using the first treatment, and with the second, all those pesky stains were almost entirely gone. Overall, it&#x27;s worked much better than all the others I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
    <li> It works but the molding are hard to make even when don&#x27;t right. I burns my gums a few times but just hard to get perfect.</li>
    <li> Smoked for five years. Too long. Five years too long. I quit but half a decade of smoking has left its mark, namely on my teeth (and lungs). But my lungs, I have to deal with that later. For now my teeth look yellow, but I started to use this product and they surprisingly look a lot better. I&#x27;m glad I am able to take this one back and look halfway decent. Will keep using.</li>
    <li> My teeth are whiter and that is the bottom line. Good for sensitive teeth.</li>
    <li> My sister brought up my white teeth. We are close so I gave her the secret. Now I am here to tell you all that this product makes my teeth shine and look the best.</li>
    <li> I noticed a pretty significant different using the first treatment, and with the second, all those pesky stains were almost entirely gone. Good product</li>
    <li> I wasnÃ¢(tm)t so sure about these when I bought them, I thought it was a little expensive compared to everything else out there but then I got the package in the mail and it looked very profressional. I&#x27;ve seen the stuff that my dentist uses with people and it costs like $300 for just one treatment with him. I tried it out the other tday and what can I say other than it weas amazing, and so much better than I thought when I first bought it. The pictures do not do it justice.</li>
    <li> Got the package on time.The product worked well. It does leave teeth a little sensitive for a day, but they do look whiter.</li>
    <li> great product and great service</li>
    <li> Works fast no irritation</li>
    <li> 5 star reviews are paid reviewers. Every review they make for other products have 5 stars (once in a while a 4 star). They have verified purchase status so they buy the many products and then give great reviews and are paid for that. beware fake reviews. click on their id and see.</li>
    <li> I only use a small amount and I have to say it works very well. I use less than it says to on the box and my teeth still manage to sparkle. I am going easy on it because I don’t know how strong the gel was but even in smaller amounts it seemed to get the job done. Will keep using and update.</li>
    <li> Its my new dentist. I have been using this for about a month through a friend, and have seen results even a dentist cant whiten. It has a foamy, tingle feeling after using, but better feeling than toothpaste. I am a coffee drinker and cigarette smoker, I use this twice a day. Amazing results right before my eyes. Better than toothpaste, and cheaper than a dentist.</li>
    <li> Shine Whitening ★ Professional Teeth Whitening Kit is really cool. I was a 26 year smoker and drink black coffee and tea, so my teeth are not as white as they were when I was a wee baby. According to the tox, the whitening gel is the same used by dentists at their office. The trays fit comfortably into my mouth. The results were great and fast. I had used whitening strips, and this product was superior. The bonus has been that my wife noticed the difference and so have a few of my friends.</li>
    <li> I recommend Shine Whitening for anyone who is looking for a professional teeth whitening kit at home. I was once ashamed of the stains from wine and coffee but now with Shine Whitening, I have more confidence because those stains are now gone. I enjoy smiling and showing off my new smile. I receive so many compliments on my new smile. It is very affordable and easy to use. It beats waiting in the dental office and paying for in office treatments. Shine Whitening leaves you with a new shining white smile :-)</li>
    <li> I recently quit smoking so I wanted to reward myself with whiter teeth. I bought Shine Whitening thinking it wouldn&#x27;t work but at this price I thought I&#x27;d give it a shot. My teeth were lighter after the first treatment. I did 30 mins on the third day &amp; that was too much for my teeth. Not too much sensitivity but with 20 mins I had little to none. You will not be disappointed in this product. I love the trays tho. I got it just right &amp; ended up with a smile I&#x27;m proud of no joke. This stuff is strong so please don&#x27;t get on gums. I learned the hard way :) I use a q-tip to apply gel then put the light in &amp; I lay down so saliva doesn&#x27;t mix with gel &amp; spread it on gums. This process works brilliantly for me. Teeth are a natural white which I enjoy because I had a little brown nicotine spot on the bottom of my right tooth that is completely gone now :)</li>
    <li> To my surprise, this worked very fast!  I saw results in just 2 treatments! Very easy to use, and a great deal for the price!</li>
    <li> These are the most effective whitening strips I have ever tried! After just three rounds with the strips, my teeth are so much whiter that I can&#x27;t even believe it. I used to have slightly yellow teeth, particularly from drinking coffee everyday. However, now my teeth are pearly white with no yellow in sight! It is amazing. The strips are so easy to use, and you see results immediately. They do not make my teeth sensitive at all, and they do not have a bad taste like others I have tried. I would recommend these strips to anyone who is looking to brighten their smile, and I plan to keep using them!</li>
    <li> The Shine Whitening Professional Teeth Whitening Kit is excellent! I like the trays much better than the strips. The dental-grade impression material works well and the trays mold to your teeth perfectly.&lt;br /&gt;The initial setup can be a little cumbersome but it is worth the effort.  You will also find that the trays are quite flexible and can mold well to people who don’t have exactly straight teeth . The clear packaging and the short list of instructions make it quite easy on the first use. The carbamide peroxide whitening gel is quite effective so it is best not to use excessive gel which can cause some irritation and/or “stinging”. The other nice thing about this product is you don’t have to use it consecutively.  I find it best to use this product every other day.  I have read that some people find it effective once every 4-5 days.  Everyone is different so determine what works best for you.&lt;br /&gt;I drink 3 more cups of coffee a day and I was amazed by the results just after the first application. This is a great product and you will find that the trays are much more effective then the strips.</li>
    <li> This is a simple solution to my problem and your problem of yellowish teeth. All it takes is for you to get this stuff and use it to your yellowish teeth. After 1 week of using this product it whitens my teeth as before.</li>
    <li> Before using this productnobody has ever commented on my smile or my teeth but now it’s all “You have a nice smile” and “Wow, white teeth.” Some are from cute girls. Really like it.</li>
    <li> I recommend this product because it’s cheap and easy to use but the most important is how effective this to whiten your teeth.</li>
    <li> i would definitely recommend this to everyone because this product is very effective to whiten teeth. Just like me.</li>
    <li> Whenever my teeth are looking a little lackluster, I slap this on and it works like a charm. The tray system works well and my teeth are pearly white.</li>
    <li> Wasn&#x27;t new; the small sticker closing the package was dirty like it was opened and closed multiple times, and when I got it I was already open. Terrible quantity which I knew about but I decided to give it a try; The opened and dirty packaging was a turn-off. On top of that all of the 5 star reviews are absolutely fake. Wish I would&#x27;ve paid more attention before ordering. Good thing it was fulfilled by Amazon so they refunded me immediately with free return shipping.</li>
    <li> I am enjoying the heck out of this product. The mouth tray system is a little cumbersome but ultimately I think the effort is worth it. No more fussing about with sticky strips or whatever, just pour it on, stick it in and you got it. My teeth are whiter and it’s easy to use and I’m a happy camper.</li>
    <li> I used to use Crest Whitestrips and whatnot and I must say that I like this product a LOT better. My mom even asked me what I was doing differently due to the shade difference after just a few days. Awesomeness!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The gel is pretty tasteless except for a hint of mint so its not bad at all and there’s also the trays that you have to heat up. Now, it does take some time to get used to using them but I’d rather use them at home where I can watch TV or web browse than sit in a dentist’s office. Plus, way cheaper than a professional whitening though in my opinion the results are just as good.</li>
    <li> Picture day at school was today and I was feeling self-conscious about my teeth They aren’t the whitest and I haven’t taken the best care of them that I could. I used this product though after my mom got it for me and my teeth are whiter than before. The photographer at school even complimented my bright teeth and I think the pictures will come out good. I am happy.</li>
    <li> The gel is great. The tray system works for me and I found it simple to use in the end. My teeth are good and just have a little bit of discoloration. After using this product for maybe two weeks I am seeing great results and my teeth are much whiter. Will keep using.</li>
    <li> Whitening strips are not better than this product. They often fall off my teeth and slip around in my mouth. Very annoying. When I use this it stays in my mouth and I know it won&#x27;t go anywhere and get gel al over the place. The gel is nice and won&#x27;t irritate my skin like some other ones.</li>
    <li> I have sensitive teeth so I was worried. I have tried to use whitening solutions in the past and noticed that they have all irritated me to some level. I have avoided them for the most part but my teeth look like they need a little sprucing up to be honest. So i tried this one out based on some of the reviews that I&#x27;ve seen. And guess what I&#x27;ve had no issues so far. Give this product a shot if you have had problems like I have in the past.</li>
    <li> Great pricing on this product. If you are looking for a bargain way to brighten your teeth a bit, look no further. This stuff is cheaper than what you can find on the shelves of your local store but also the ingredients are good and it will do the job just as well as other brands that are more expensive.</li>
    <li> My photos will look great and I plan on showing off my teeth. The formula in this works fast and my teeth are glowing, practically.</li>
    <li> Great price for this product. Noticed this online here by accident, lucky. I was just in the store and in the market for teeth whitening. Saw the prices and my jaw dropped, basically. This stuff is a bargain compared to in the store. And online too, I guess. That&#x27;s what it looks like from a cursory search. Will be buying this up.</li>
    <li> Awesome teeth whitening kit! I&#x27;ve bought a few whitening kits in the past but none of them really worked. I was always looking for new brands to try out until I found this one. You start to notice that your teeth are getting more white after the first use! I recommend this kit to everyone who is looking to buy a whitening kit!</li>
    <li> I have sensitive teeth and I was afraid I wouldn&#x27;t be able to use this product, as many other ones. But that was not the case. I feel great about it. My teeth look nice too.</li>
    <li> This product feels cool on my lips, on my teeth. It&#x27;s got a pleasant minty taste which is great. I enjoy feeling that and will keep using it.</li>
    <li> Wow. Seeing results in such a short period of time. I am amazed at how white my teeth look today when only about a week ago my teeth looked like two bricks of butter. Anyway, I recommend this.</li>
    <li> Slight sensitivity in teeth, but only because I kept it on for longer I think, I lose track of time. No way I would use this every day. Maybe once a month. But a general brightening up is visible with one application itself. It seems fairly safe and easy to use. The teeth trays don&#x27;t really take on the shape of my teeth and i didnt bother, the trays keep the bleach in place.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve seen the stuff that my dentist uses with people and it costs like $300 for just one treatment with him. I tried it out the other today and what can I say other than it was amazing, and so much better than I thought when I first bought it. I wasn’t so sure about these when I bought them, I thought it was a little expensive compared to everything else out there but then I got the package in the mail and it looked very professional.</li>
    <li> Strips often cannot stay put in my mouth. It&#x27;s like trying to keep a wheat paste poster on the wall but if the wall was made of teeth. It needs this tray and it works really well.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll never go back to the dentist for whitening..it&#x27;s not worth the price when brilliant gives me the same results</li>
    <li> This product is minty fresh and it&#x27;s great because I look forward to using this product. I use it about two or three times a week and since it tastes pretty nice and refreshing, I don&#x27;t consider it a chore, really. It works great and my teeth are noticeably whiter than when i started. Glad to be using this.</li>
    <li> took some really bad coffee stains off of my teeth. What a good product. I want more</li>
    <li> I have decided to whiten my teeth every two to three days now and so far it has been great. My teeth look better than they have in years and Boosting of confidence now to smile to everyone.</li>
    <li> I have used several teeth-whitening products over the years and found &amp;#34;Shine Whitening&amp;#34; to be average at best. As a test, I applied a treatment course of &amp;#34;Shine&amp;#34; immediately following a Crest 3-D series because I was dissatisfied with Crest. However, &amp;#34;Shine&amp;#34; did not whiten my teeth beyond the point they had reached with Crest. They remained yellowish. Another issue with &amp;#34;Shine&amp;#34; is the ticky-tack syringes used to deliver the whitening gel. The tips of the syringes come off easily, resulting in the gel spurting out in a glob and being wasted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For me, the best whitening product for the money was one that was formerly sold by Walmart for about $7, but it&#x27;s long gone. My dentist used to sell me a special whitener sold exclusively through dentists, and it did the job well -- I think it was about $25 then and likely $35-$40 now. I&#x27;ll ask him about it next time I see him, but I won&#x27;t spend any more money on &amp;#34;Shine.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> Found this system very easy to use! Surprised. There was a bit of work up top but the time that you save by doing it is worth it. You just have to bite down on a piece of molded plastic to match your mouth and for the rest of the time you have a personalized piece of equipment. It makes whitening teeth that much easier. Believe me.</li>
    <li> Arrived on Time and works great , totally worth it and works better than crest.</li>
    <li> While the strips are easier to use  they don’t wrap around your teeth like the trays but I’d say using trays is closer to the dentist experience, so if you’re used to that then I’d recommend this Shine zero system as you will get the best result that can you get than othe product.</li>
    <li> People are bringing up the fact that I have been using this product. Or they know. It’s a little embarrassing to have people ask me if I have been whitening my teeth, but I think it’s more embarrassing to have yellow teeth.   And it’s a compliment. So I gotta get over myself. Shine Whitening is a great product and I am for sure going to keep using it.</li>
    <li> My teeth are whiter than ever and it has given me more confidence to smile at people, namely women. The feedback has been all positive and I am attracting more attention from the opposite sex.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been converted to Shine Whitening. Great job</li>
    <li> This is a simple and easy way to whiten your teeth. The tray system is good and might take some work but it is good for you in the end. Molds to your teeth.</li>
    <li> I use it twice a week and put in a tiny amount and it works great for me, my teeth shine bright.</li>
    <li> Made my teeth hurt, and didn&#x27;t see results.</li>
    <li> Strips are nowhere as good as this. Maybe the solutions themselves are similar but strips have a way of falling off and this tray stays on. No brainer.</li>
    <li> Showing off my teeth a lot more after using this product. My teeth are so white!</li>
    <li> It fits in my mouth like that because this product is easy to use, no hassle and very effective.</li>
    <li> I enjoy this product and I am happy the way people will look at my clean and white teeth.</li>
    <li> It did the job but verrry messy.  I was looking to whiten my teeth before my wedding,  I used this one night and stopped after.  It left white spots on my teeth and I was a mess for the 15 minutes.  Just get the whitening strips or done professionally.  Its not worth the cleanup.</li>
    <li> This teeth whitening is actually strong and it works enough to really whitens my teeth as before.</li>
    <li> Save time. Stick em in your mouth for 15 minutes a day. I get ready for work at 5am every morning and I whiten my teeth every morning and I see great results. Boom, done and it’s easy, even for people who are busy. Usually my teeth are really sensitive to these whitening products but I’ve felt pretty good using this one, not like Crest white strips. Thanks Shine Whitening.</li>
    <li> Used most of it...may have 1 treatment left, but not much change in my teeth.&lt;br /&gt;The tray wasn&#x27;t much good as it&#x27;s cut too high and I was bleaching my gums....I tried to cut them down, but that didn&#x27;t work too well. I had an old tray from my dentist, which has lost some of it&#x27;s shape, but it worked better.&lt;br /&gt;I had some gum sensitivity in the beginning but with more uses that problem faded.&lt;br /&gt;Overall...a slight change. but I would not re-order.</li>
    <li> My teeth look better than hers and I have no sensitivity at all. Nice product and I like it.</li>
    <li> I would say that it does work, and works well to a certain degree of brightness improvement. Beyond a certain whiteness achieved, it&#x27;ll no longer perform its miracle to continue turning it to a paper-white degree per se. I&#x27;m overall satisfied.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve bought this product several times and it seems to do a good job whitening although it seems to irritate my gums and causes some sharp tooth pain and I don&#x27;t have sensitive teeth or gums. The trays provided are pretty much useless and the taste isn&#x27;t the greatest either. Again, having said this, it does whiten effectively from my experience but I used an old Invisilign tray so it was snug on my teeth with little mess. The seller got my orders to me very promptly and in good order.</li>
    <li> Thanks to my friend for recommending it to me. Now my teeth are whiten than before.</li>
    <li> I had been trying to whiten my teeth for years. I like so many other people though just don&#x27;t have the money to go to a dentist to get them cleaned. I have tried other teeth whiners that promise you &amp;#34;sparkling white teeth&amp;#34; as well as being permanently white... They didn&#x27;t work. I reluctantly went into this product after the advice from a friend. The price at first seemed a little bit much but realistically the other whitening products I have used just were not doing anything and they cost a lot less. So I thought to myself &amp;#34;Might as well spend a little extra on a product that supposed to work!&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;The first time I used it I used it for twenty minutes. It says you can use it between fifteen and thirty minutes. After several days I do have to admit that I did see a somewhat improvement in my teeth. After a week I defiantly saw a huge improvement. I continue to use it somewhat regularly and have been able to keep my teeth white. I wouldn&#x27;t say they are sparkling but they are close to it! I would defiantly recommend this product to anyone looking to get whiter teeth!</li>
    <li> at first I wasn&#x27;t so sure but I gave them a try - why not right? Totally surprized! Doing the mouth guard things was neat.. Never done those before. Ill def be buying again!</li>
    <li> This is the best whitening system that I&#x27;ve tried, I like the tray soo much better than the strips (it gets every inch instead of coming out splotchy) You just have to e careful around the gums because they can be irritated a little but other than that good product</li>
    <li> It took a few weeks but my teeth have whitened up. I like the tray system better for me which is why I stuck with the product. I will continue to use it to see if my results get even better.</li>
    <li> went to my dentist and they do the exact same thingÃ¢Â¦ EXACT SAME treatment using the exact same devices. This was a tenth the price</li>
    <li> My teeth look awesome. I used this only a handful of times and I swear I look like I have movie star teeth. Great results.</li>
    <li> Strips suck. They keep falling off my teeth and are a pain in the butt to even stick on, they always stick on crooked and who wants that? I don&#x27;t want some wack pattern of teeth whitening formula on my teeth. This way is better, it&#x27;s easier, and it&#x27;s more complete.</li>
    <li> Just like using the whitestrips for about a half a year solidÃ¢Â¦ oy. Except this only took about 15 minutes of my time. ItÃ¢(tm)s a great product really.</li>
    <li> this product work after only one use. This is best product for whitening. Will recommend</li>
    <li> I smile a lot more after using this product. Never looked better. Brightens up my face overall.</li>
    <li> I hardly drink coffee, but I do smoke. The yellow gets really noticable after a while. I have used trays before from some other brand, they didn&#x27;t work for me too well I got the goop all over and everywhere.. These ones are pretty good, no mess and easy to use no argument on whether or not it works. It works real good brings everyhing back to BETTER than normal.</li>
    <li> OMG thank you thank you thank you to Shine Whitening! It has literally changed my life! I&#x27;m an Actress and was sick of being told - yes we like you, but your teeth...&#x27; at auditions. I started using SW and was really impressed with the results which seemed almost immediate - after a short while this product literally transformed my smile into what it is now- basically perfect and gleaming white!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really feel like this a real unbelievable beauty product find. Not only are my teeth white - they feel healthy. Although I wanted white teeth I didn&#x27;t want an over &#x27;the top look&#x27;, the great thing about this product is you can use it in the way you wish - I now have the most natural, healthy white smile that I literally dreamed of -which is now a reality. The only difficult thing is getting used to complete strangers complementing me on my &#x27;beautiful smile&#x27;. Its 5 stars from me! :)</li>
    <li> I bought three thinking I would need a couple with the crazy stains I have on my teeth but they were gone with just one. Fantastic results here.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had trouble getting rid of the coffee stains left on my teeth. Even my dentist now has trouble with all their tools they use on me. It gets a little expensive to keep going back every couple months. Damn addictive coffee. Bought this a while ago and they seem to work for me really well. I use the treatments every couple weeks and it&#x27;s kept the stains to a VERY small minimum.</li>
    <li> I use this product 3 times a week, I have no problems with the tray and my teeth are nicer looking. The tray system is good and it is easy to use.</li>
    <li> I use this product about 3 times a week and feel great. My teeth look awesome and I will be definitely be purchasing more. My teeth are naturally yellowing so I needed to fight this change. It turned out to be a great buy and I will be buying more. Good price too!</li>
    <li> So I&#x27;ve been using this stuff for about 2 weeks. First it does have a nice minty taste. Secondly, it definitely made my teeth sensitive. During the very first use I could barely stand the first 15 mins and almost stopped using it. However I was desperate to have whiter teeth. So I used it again and for the next four uses I experienced a Mild sensitivity throughout my mouth. On the 6th use my gums had a very bad reaction to the feel. They turned white and became very inflamed. It felt pretty bad. I discontinued use at that time. A week later I decided to continue the rest of the gel. So far it&#x27;s day 3 and I&#x27;m experiencing the same sensitivity I experienced before. Last, they did when my teeth. I wouldn&#x27;t say significantly but I have received compliments on how good my teeth look so I guess it was all worth it. I have about 3 more days of use and I plan on using it.</li>
    <li> The Shine Whitening Professional Whitening Kit is easy to use and so worth it.&lt;br /&gt;I am a former smoker so my teeth are not the whitest teeth in the world.&lt;br /&gt;I have tried many teeth whitening products and they all seem so difficult.&lt;br /&gt;I love this whitening kit because the steps are so simple.&lt;br /&gt;All that you have to do is fill the trays with the whitening solution, and pop them into your mouth. The tray also feels so comfortable in my mouth.&lt;br /&gt;As long as you follow the directions you should be set.&lt;br /&gt;Heat them, and you&#x27;ll have a perfect fit.&lt;br /&gt;I received this product in exchange for my honest review.</li>
    <li> I saw I recommendation for this product on the 3D Crest reviews and turns out it is a SCAM. this product does not work and will BURN your gums. Actually it caused my gums to bleed and they have never been sensitive. DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT</li>
    <li> I started using this product and immediately my teeth display a difference. My teeth are become whiter than before. Thanks Shine, I feel comfortable now with my look.</li>
    <li> It did burn my gums a tiny bit but I can&#x27;t deny the results are definitely what I was looking for in a teeth whitening product. I would suggest halving the suggested times to avoid burning your gums too much.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t notice any special results, but maybe my original shade is too bright for this specific to work.</li>
    <li> I was really impressed with the shipping of this product and how quickly the whitener works. I would recommend this product to anyone.</li>
    <li> I have pretty white natural teeth according to my dentist, but I’ve always wanted whiter. NU2 Brilliant HD Deluxe Teeth Whitening Kit definitely made my smile brighter than before. The kit comes with 2 10 ML syringes, 2 mouth trays 1 for upper and 1 for lower teeth, try case, and remineralization gel. The instructions are pretty straight forward. You will see results in no time.</li>
    <li> This is the only teeth whitening system I will use now. I&#x27;ve used this for 2 weeks and see a huge difference. The coffee stains are not there anymore, and I have super sensitive teeth, but this product didn&#x27;t bother it.</li>
    <li> after using crest whitestrips for the past few years I got used to the mediocreness of them. SUCH A BIG difference between the shine whitening trays and the crest whitestrips. I&#x27;m glad I made the change. I just use these like the instructions say, every 3-4 days and they&#x27;re so pearly white, the actually almost shine - but not and unnatural look either.</li>
    <li> could really see the difference.</li>
    <li> I really like this product, just make sure you do not put any on your gums otherwise it may sting a little.</li>
    <li> I first looked into teeth whitening because I drink a lot of coffee and had started to notice that my teeth were getting stained (and I smile a lot so I always felt very self conscious about it). The first set of teeth whitening I used I purchased from my dentist for $200 (and it was like a month supply so it would have broken the bank!). I only ended up using that one for about a week because the trays didn&#x27;t fit well and it made my teeth feel so sensitive and gums hurt that I couldn&#x27;t take it. I came across this product and after a few weeks, it&#x27;s time to write a review.&lt;br /&gt;I should first mention that this product comes with two trays and gel. Although I thought that I knew how to apply the product, I did find that their online video was very helpful and a nice touch. There is also instructions written on paper, but I&#x27;m more of a visual person. I was afraid that the gel would cause my teeth to be in pain again and so I used very little gel the first time .. which ended up to be the best idea ever because you actually need very little gel (and that&#x27;s also nice because it means the kit will last longer). I use this every three days and haven&#x27;t had an issue with teeth sensitivity (a big relief because I love my cold drinks) and the tray fits comfortably in my mouth. Also, it doesn&#x27;t result in a mess on my counter and it&#x27;s easy to use. I&#x27;ve noticed in these weeks that my teeth are noticeably whiter and other people have even commented on it (which makes me realize that more people noticed than I initially thought :(). I expect this supply to last me a while longer, but I will be reordering.</li>
    <li> BURNS! The burning I felt from the gel was unbearable on my gums. I pulled it out after less than a minute and will never put them back in. Aweful</li>
    <li> Enamel erodes with time and the natural state of our teeth is yellow. ThatÃ¢(tm)s too bad but I started using Shine and my teeth are as white as before the enamel started eroding. I use it twice a week and saw results in about a month. Tray system is great.</li>
    <li> Update: 7/13/2015 - This is still my go to Teeth Whitening kit. Usually my reviews are longer in length but the below has been helpful for many. If you need any further advice please don&#x27;t hesitate to ask.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Does it work: Yes&lt;br /&gt;Did it make my teeth hurt: No&lt;br /&gt;Have other brands made my teeth hurt: Yes&lt;br /&gt;Was it easy to use: Yes&lt;br /&gt;Would you purchase it again: Yes&lt;br /&gt;Did people notice the difference: Yes&lt;br /&gt;Was it the best teeth whitening solution for you: Yes&lt;br /&gt;How many teeth whitening solutions have you tried: 3&lt;br /&gt;Why did the others fail: Made teeth hurt&lt;br /&gt;Advice - Mold one at a time. Don&#x27;t get aggressive.&lt;br /&gt;Have you written a review in this style before: No&lt;br /&gt;Will people like it: Hope So&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for reading!</li>
    <li> This is a good way to whiten your teeth.  I am used to professional strength whitening gel as I get it from the dentist,  This is not has strong as theirs but a good alternative, did not leave my teeth sensitive nor did I have a weird after taste.&lt;br /&gt;Great product&lt;br /&gt;I received a discount to write an honest unbiased opinion</li>
    <li> Tea and coffee every day mean that my poor teeth have been stained. If this has happened to you, try this product out. I used it for a few weeks and it has really turned the color around in my teeth. Very white.</li>
    <li> I used it for a month and I’m already getting compliments at work on my nice smile! Thanks Shine Whitening . I use it a few times a week and will be purchasing more in the future. It’s easy to use and not much of a time commitment at all! Five out of five.</li>
    <li> Picture day was a blast for the first time in my life. My teeth looked great thanks to Shine Whitening.</li>
    <li> Get rid of the strip system, I say. This is the new gold standard of teeth whitening technology. I use it about twice a week and my teeth have never looked better. I would say that the whiteness is about on par with strips or other products, but this one is just so much easier to use. Recommended.</li>
    <li> Strips fall out of my teeth and it’s troublesome. Used this product for a couple weeks and I’m seeing great results. No problems and very convenient.</li>
    <li> I have tried a lot of teeth whitening products and whitening toothpastes in the past with little success.  My teeth just never seem to get truly white or even show a noticeable difference in shade.  As a coffee and wine drinker, I need a product that really lives up to it&#x27;s promise.  Shine Whitening really does.&lt;br /&gt;Within the first few days I was able to see a difference.  The dark yellow stains that had built up from years of coffee drinking started to fade away and look much whiter.  After a week my teeth were looking whiter than they have since I was a teenager.  The great thing about Shine is that it didn&#x27;t damage my tooth enamel or cause any pain like other products I tried did.  It was very easy to use and not time consuming.  Try out this whitening kit and you may not need any expensive dentist visits to get a professional whitening.  Shine allows you to do it right at home.  Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I used this product to help remove the stain in my teeth and now I love my smile. It’s whiter and great. Thanks Shine.</li>
    <li> The product works just fine, but the instructions are not correct.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Molding the mouthpieces was fine, the instructions are adequate here. The first issue is that the instructions say to apply 0.5cc to each tray, which they say is equivalent to a small drop. This isn&#x27;t true. 0.5cc &#x3D; 0.5mL, and the 0.5mL markings are on each syringe. When you dispense that amount, it&#x27;s much more than one small drop.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The instructions also say that you can do a whitening treatment every day. For me, this was absolutely incorrect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On day one, the treatment went the way it&#x27;s supposed to. My gums were a little sore, but nothing much really. On day two, I tried to do another treatment and my gums were absolutely burning. It was very painful, I had to take the trays out of my mouth after about two minutes. My gums were visibly inflamed. Not surprisingly, they looked white as though they were being bleached (because they were). It was painful but my gums stopped hurting after a couple hours. Then I waited about 5 days and did another treatment, which went basically they way it should.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In summary, my experience was that I have to wait about a week between treatments. Trying to do them any more frequently is very painful and likely terrible for my gums. Also, as a tip, make sure your head is tilted back when you put the trays in your mouth. I started salivating excessively as soon as I got them in. If you do this all correctly though, the results are good and you will have nicely whitened teeth.</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with this product and will be loyal to this product forever.</li>
    <li> My smile looks greater than ever thanks to Shine Whitening that 100% product from USA. So it&#x27;s really safe to use.</li>
    <li> I use it twice a week and had no problems with the trays. I will continue to use this because I feel contented with the results.</li>
    <li> This product gives you more than a wonderful smile. Confidence booster.</li>
    <li> I use it three times a week and I’m happy with the result of this teeth whitening.</li>
    <li> I tried some other whiteners a couple years ago but they hurt my gums a lot. Saw this ne one come out, and read some good reviews about it not stinging or hurting gums, gave it a try and it&#x27;s great! For me it&#x27;s still a little intense, but good!</li>
    <li> My wife told me to get my teeth whitened and I know they do this kind of thing professionally but I couldnÃ¢(tm)t afford it. I looked up the Shine Whitening kit and it was in my budget and it worked, probably just as good as the surgery. My friend got it done by the dentist and mine look just like his. My wife is pleased with the results. Happy wife, happy life.</li>
    <li> Im no longer afraid to actually smile for pictures anymore. Using this for a couple months and it&#x27;d helped me so much.</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive teeth so I was a little nervous about trying the gel instead of the strips. It works SOO much better than the strips. It made my teeth a little sensitive but bearable. I think this product is high quality.</li>
    <li> made m my teeth a little bit sensitive but could really see a difference within a few uses</li>
    <li> Honestly, IÃ¢(tm)ve had years of stains. YEARS. Years of coffee, cigarettes, you name it. And yeah IÃ¢(tm)ve heard of whitening strips. Gave them a shot, but they never stuck in my mouth. ThereÃ¢(tm)s this new system with Shine and I just bite down and it doesnÃ¢(tm)t fall out. If the strips worked out I bet they would make my teeth look good like they do now. I swear my teeth are three shades lighter. Thank goodness.</li>
    <li> I started using this a few weeks ago and I think the results have been good. My confidence is up and people have noticed that my teeth are whiter, or at least that IÃ¢(tm)m smiling a lot more often. I find that the tray system is simple to use and fits easily in my mouth now. The gel is cool and minty. My teeth have become a bit more white and I enjoy using the product a few times a week. Will continue to use.</li>
    <li> Tray system beats out strips and other ways of administering teeth whitening solution to your teeth. Often strips fall out of my mouth and have trouble sticking on. This one has no trouble at all, it is made to fit perfectly in your mouth. My teeth have never been whiter and this product worked in a very fast amount of time. Only a handful of treatments before my teeth looked pretty great.</li>
    <li> After perusing through multiple teeth-whitening products I chose the Shine Whitening Professional Whitening Kit. Best choice I&#x27;ve made when it comes to my teeth cleansing/whitening! This kit provides all the necessary ingredients needed to make me feel confident speaking in front of my COLLEGE students. If you&#x27;re not tech savvy (I&#x27;m not!), no problem; this kit and its easy use is just what the dentist ordered! You cant buy a better product for your buck. The heating mechanism allows for the mouth tray to fit uniquely, according to your mouth. Don&#x27;t shop around too long searching for the best teeth whitening product; This is it!</li>
    <li> White teeth are desirable. It&#x27;s probably even a dealbreaker for many daters. I used it and I got a date. Coincidence? Maybe. But do you want to risk it?</li>
    <li> I’ve always been self-conscious about my teeth. They were crooked as a child so I got braces as I got older. And then by the time they were straight they had been stained by a horrible smoking habit I picked up as a teenager.I was hesitant to try this product out just because I felt defeated by my teeth, but I’m so glad I did, based on the other amazon reviews here. My teeth have looked better than ever, probably the best they ever have. The tray system is easy and the fluid is great—I probably stick it in my mouth for 20 minutes per session and about four times a week. I feel more confident and I am more willing to smile now. Thanks Shine Whitening.</li>
    <li> Maybe I’m weird but I liked the taste of the gel formula in this product. I might buy more just to eat it haha. But seriously, I wanted to whiten my teeth and bought Shine Whitening and stuck that stuff in my mouth and I was like, whoa. Other products taste weird but this one is fine and it’s a funny texture on top of that. I do a thing with my nephew where we pretend it’s the scene in the Godfather where he puts the orange in his mouth and smiles. I get to do that every morning while this stuff makes my teeth whiter. It’s great.</li>
    <li> anyone can use shine whitening did not make my teeth sensitive at all.</li>
    <li> Quick results, and after just a few treatments my teeth are whiter than using an entire box of white strips. I highly recommend these. I didn&#x27;t believe all of the great reviews, but the price was reasonable enough to give these a try. So glad I did!</li>
    <li> This was very easy to use and I am able to see the whitening, I would recommend this product to anyone.</li>
    <li> Great price on this product. I have seen so many other whitening products go for twice this or three times even. And it’s a bargain. I have personally used this product and can vouch for how the tray system is pretty decent and a more convenient way. My teeth look great and at a good price too.</li>
    <li> This stuff really works! It&#x27;s the best product I&#x27;ve found for teeth whitening, and I&#x27;ve tried many. I saw results after 2 uses (non-smoker, but I drink coffee/tea every day)I  use it once a week, no more. I usually use Crest Whitestrips, but switched to this package because it&#x27;s more affordable. I will use this from now on. It&#x27;s much stronger than what you can get at the pharmacy. This product works very well. I was concerned because the price was so low. I know others had troubles with the mouth pieces but I already had custom made trays from years ago from my dentist so I didn&#x27;t have to worry about making trays. Love this product and the shipping was VERY FAST!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; My dentist couldn&#x27;t believe it when I told her what I was using. I was skeptical about this product since it was so inexpensive. I would never have imagined that it would be so easy to use &amp; effective. It was a prompt delivery and an excellent product. The instructions are easy to use and understand. Can&#x27;t say enough good things about this product. If you&#x27;re on the fence, go for it. Your smile will thank you!</li>
    <li> I thoroughly enjoyed using this product.Here is my review about it:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I always had problems with keeping my teeth white. I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s some odd gene that I inherited from my family or not but my teeth turn yellow quickly. I have tried going the dentist route for teeth whitening but I have found them to be hard on my pockets, and very temporary(my teeth were as yellow as corn in as little as a week and a half). I also have tried many cheap remedies that claim to whiten your teeth and make it &amp;#34;SHINE&amp;#34;, but most of them did not work and some, I suspect, contributed to making them more yellow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At risk at sounding like another trite and tasteless review I will say that I am pleasantly surprised at the results that this product has provided. When this product first arrived, I noticed that there was no tedious work required in unpacking the product. Most other products had packaging that made opening them a bitter chore and often required something other than my hand, like scissors to open. I was able to open up the package easily and with absolutely no hassles. I also noticed that everything came as advertised. I received my whitening gel and mouth trays. I also noticed that the instructions were straightforward and easy to follow. There was no guess work required for me figure out how to use it. They also included a link to a video tutorial that would show me visually, step by step, how to use this product. I was astounded, as I rarely see a company provide this level of customer service. It shows me that they are not simply out to make a profit, but want to genuinely help people who struggle with stained teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for my teeth, well, all I can say is that I am confident that my smile can outshine the most handsomest of men in Hollywood. My teeth have gone 13 shades down! This was all done in the comfort of my bathroom, in 10 minutes, without the dentist. I feel like I have been ripped off now that I have used this product. Ihave recommended this to my half brother who also struggles with stained teeth. I also recommended this to my co-workers, most of who have the healthy habit of downing coffee in the morning(great for the teeth). If you are hesitant to buy this product, I can personally vouch for it&#x27;s results.</li>
    <li> been using this product for over a month and I have yet to experience any sensitivity with hot/cold food and liquids. I haven&#x27;t noticed any sensitivity to my gums either. I make sure I use it on a regular basis to keep up with my white smile. I love this kit and would recommend it all.</li>
    <li> good product. I use this product a few times a week and I&#x27;ve really noticed a difference. I will continue to purchase on a regular basis to keep my shinny pearls:)</li>
    <li> I have tried over the counter whitening kits, had my dentist do two years ago and was never quite satisfied with the results. I have been a coffee drinker, soda addict and on occasion, tobacco user and my teeth have yellowed over the years. After failed results, and loss of money in my mind, I decided to gibe Shine Whitening a try. The price was fairly reasonable and I figured, why not?&lt;br /&gt;Other kits were paint on or fill the tray/mouthpiece etc so I had no idea what to expect. I do recommend watching the video before using. Very helpful with the mouthpiece fitting properly.&lt;br /&gt;After three continuous uses, I couldn&#x27;t believe it. Where others had failed, this product was showing results. I am thrilled beyond belief. It is great. I would recommend Shine Whitening to others- as I already have been. The happiness is in my smile. I notice I am smiling and even laughing more. Thank you for a great product I can use at home!</li>
    <li> Using this product twice a week. Strips tend to fall out of my mouth and they have become a big hassle. But this product pretty much solves that problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; You stick a tray in your mouth that has been molded to your mouth and fill it with gel, distributing it in a way that is even and great. My teeth are awesome looking now and whiter than ever.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m pretty sure most of these reviews are fake. The first time I bought this it worked decently but this time it seemed to do nothing. It&#x27;s as if the strength is inconsistent between batches. That plus all the fake reviews and dubious FDA approval... stay away from this</li>
    <li> Works great but use the q tip method to apply otherwise it can kind of burn your gums.</li>
    <li> Out of all the whitening products on the market, this is the best. I&#x27;ve used Crest, Colgate, toothpaste, Listerine, and Shine outshines them all. The directions are clear- apply the product to the tray, which forms to each individual&#x27;s teeth. The fit is easy and comfortable. This unique feature makes Shine better than Crest White Strips, which slide off the teeth and make it much less effective. Shine also doesn&#x27;t leave my teeth and gums feeling sensitive, which has happened with other whitening methods in the past.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shine&#x27;s Whitening Kit is something to re-purchase again and again. It&#x27;s work it. This is the best method to get white teeth, fast!</li>
    <li> You only need to put a little bit on in the mouth tray. The gel is nice and cool and mint tasting a little bit, very pleasant. I like this product for what it does and the price is low.</li>
    <li> People at work have been asking me about my teeth lately and I have to give credit to this product. I am happy to have found it and now I&#x27;m the envy of my coworkers.</li>
    <li> I have used teeth strips in the past, and I like how they whiten my teeth but do not like that they often slip off my teeth. This product solves that by having the trays mold to your mouth. It’s a pretty ingenious solution that just needs a tiny bit of work up top. I enjoy how it stays in there and whitens my teeth very well.</li>
    <li> Simple system as far as I’m concerned and the whitening works wonders on my teeth. They look great.</li>
    <li> Just received but so far so good.</li>
    <li> Love this kit for the money. Saw results after one week. Follow instructions carefully for the molds, don&#x27;t try to repeat the setup process like I did- the mold folded over on itself and I couldn&#x27;t pry it apart. So I&#x27;m just using one mold for now..working fine on top and bottom teeth.</li>
    <li> I tried whitening strips but they were hard to use. Someone I know told me to look for a tray system and I found it on amazon not in stores. But that’s fine because the cost is competitive and affordable. This stuff actually stays in my mouth and whitens my teeth.</li>
    <li> Very easy to use and its very good for sensitive teeth. I like this so much.</li>
    <li> My teeth look great and I feel boundless. Happy for this product.</li>
    <li> I have tried every brand of of tooth whitening and this kit works. My teeth have never been this white in years. Shine whitening is the first product that I got real results and it was easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a big coffee drinker and smoker so my teeth were yellow, but after following the directions and seeing the video online my teeth got better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall this product seems like pretty good value. After my results, I at least gained 3 shades which is amazing, I figure that I&#x27;ll buy a couple more sets of these and buying it for the rest of my family. We drink so much coffee that our teeth just aren&#x27;t as white as they should be.</li>
    <li> I bought this whitening shine product because I was disappointed in the whitening solution blue ray type that I was conned to doing in Vegas. It cost me almost $150 and it didn&#x27;t even work.&lt;br /&gt;Here I am now with this new product that I was introduced by my friend. Believe it or not this product works. Yes it may take 10 days but if you put your mind and work on it you will see the results.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve read a few reviews stating that the kit can make your teeth very sensitive after each use. I really have NOT noticed a difference with my teeth AND I have been using it consistently for at least 6 months.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a teeth whitener kit when I stumbled upon this. This kit has made my teeth so much whiter in little time. I enjoyed using it as it was really use to set up and use. Definitly recommend this to everyone who is looking for whiter teeth with little effort!</li>
    <li> I feel great and each treatment only takes just a few minutes, depending on how much you want to use. I love the results and my teeth are whiter. I am feeling more confident now  when I smile.</li>
    <li> Here’s a thing you can do too. I don’t know if I like the tray system so much but I continued to buy this product because it did a great job of whitening my teeth. You can simply slather it on with a q tip and then wash it off. I guess I just have a hard time putting things like that in my mouth that are so large, so I found a solution. It works great.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for the past week and a half because I have a couple stains on my front teeth from smoking cigarettes for so long. This has really gotten them to be less noticeable than ever before. My teeth are a few shades whiter and that&#x27;s all I ever wanted.</li>
    <li> I was looking for something to make my teeth whiter for my brother&#x27;s wedding, heard about Shine Whitening so decided to give it a try. Thought I would need to do a lot to but it was surprisingly simple to use. I tested it on my teeth for five minutes before going longer just to be sure I didn&#x27;t experience any adverse reaction. I have a slight sensitivity to cold being on my teeth, nothing happened so I used it once a day for about twenty minutes each time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave it four stars because I didn&#x27;t necessarily like boiling the water to get the mouth tray to fit in my mouth properly. I needed to do it twice because my first attempt wasn&#x27;t comfortable. Other than than that I think it was worth the money. I felt confident enough to smile for family pictures at the wedding and a few people even said I had a nice smile. So I&#x27;d say it was a success!!!!</li>
    <li> I would say this kit is comparable to the more expensive ones on the shelf at Target or Walmart and sometimes those go for 100s of dollars. It’s insane. The cheaper ones don’t last very long—you have to keep reapplying it or your teeth will revert to the yellow stains. Shine Whitening seems to be doing a good job for a reasonable price .</li>
    <li> only needed to use it a few times.. It&#x27;s strong and works great!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about 7 days now. I&#x27;ve already seen an increase in the whiteness of my teeth.This product is very easy to use and its very gentle on my teeth. I have very sensitive teeth and I was worried that it would irritate my gums and cause my teeth to hurt. But after 7 days my mouth is feeling fresh and better than ever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;ve used countless whitening kit after countless whitening kit with no results, look no further. This is the whitening kit for you. I&#x27;ve used all sorts of whitening kits from cheap ones to incredibly expensive ones and none of them worked as well as this one. Most leave funny feelings in your mouth or hurt your gums. But Shine Whitening didn&#x27;t do any of that. Easy, painless whitening.</li>
    <li> Recommended. Enamel naturally becomes yellow as time goes on, but I know this stuff can battle it pretty hard. Used it only four times and my teeth look great in white. I would say this gives very good results.</li>
    <li> I always trust amazon to buy stuff from. This is way better than crest.</li>
    <li> I had a school photo to take and I wanted to stand out. Homework and finals left me with no regular routine and my mouth and teeth were grungy and gross from negligence. I looked up a teeth-whitening solution that I could administer while I hit the books and found this.</li>
    <li> It is very difficult to find a Whitening Kit that actually works, but this one has exceeded my expectations and you don’t have to wait long to start noticing the results. I’ve tried Crest 3D Whitestrips once and it didn’t help me as much as this one did.&lt;br /&gt;It is much cheaper than other brands and it was very simple to use it, just as simple as brushing my teeth. Also, using it didn’t annoy me at all, because the mouth trays fitted just fine in my mouth after having them heated.&lt;br /&gt;So, buy it now and you won’t regret it!</li>
    <li> I started using this a few weeks ago and I think the results have been good. My confidence is up and people have noticed that my teeth are whiter, or at least that IÃ¢(tm)m smiling a lot more often. I find that the tray system is simple to use and fits easily in my mouth now. The gel is cool and minty. My teeth have become a bit more white and I enjoy using the product a few times a week. Will continue to use.</li>
    <li> This product is terrible. First Amazon purchase I&#x27;ve ever been unhappy with. Forget 8oz of water when you heat the mouth trays, you better use the biggest pot you can find. If the mold even slightly touches the side or bottom it will melt to it and be ruined. Also the syringes are terrible, when I tried to put the tip on, half of the gel immediately oozed out. (Yes, I was doing it the right way). As another reviewer has said, don&#x27;t be fooled by all the positive reviews, they are false. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> The tray system you have to put under hot water and then mold it to fit your mouth. ItÃ¢(tm)s kind of a hassle but if you think about it, it is generating a personalized experience. Other companies donÃ¢(tm)t care about whether their strips or whatever fall out of your mouth and this product is trying to make sure this stuff whitens your teeth and makes sure it fits in your jaw. Pretty cool.</li>
    <li> If you do it every other day for three weeks I can say from my experience that your teeth will look freaking amazing. I used it and really turned my mouth around, from a 3 out of 10 to a 9 out of 10.</li>
    <li> Feeling a lot more confident after using this product. Love seeing my white teeth on display for everyone.</li>
    <li> My teeth are whiter and people are noticing. Showing it off, I even got a date when the ice was broken when she said she liked my smile. That&#x27;s called killing it. Use this for a few weeks and see if you can get similar results. I will say that it can&#x27;t hurt trying.</li>
    <li> My smiles bring up more confidence in me, all my actions feel more confident. I am glad to smile all day and it looks great thanks to this product.</li>
    <li> Great deal here. I would say to go out and grab it just like all these fine people here. The price is right, the method is great. I have found it to work very easily and will recommend it to people because it makes my teeth look clean when they really aren&#x27;t. Love it.</li>
    <li> I drink a lot of coffee and tea. While I have used other products in the past to remove some of the stains, I thought I&#x27;d give this one a try just to see what happens. It&#x27;s a bit more expensive than the generic store brand white strips I&#x27;ve used before, but it works really well! Definitely cheaper than going to the dentist. It is really easy to use, too. Just heat up the trays so they fit in your mouth, put the gel in and let it sit for 30 minutes or so. Heating is very important---I tried to skip this step. Don&#x27;t. They are a bit large before heating, but fit perfectly after.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;m happy with the product.</li>
    <li> I tend to have yellowing teeth from all kinds of things, and after trying so many products on the market and all of them failing, a friend of mine recommended Shine Whitening and told me she really saw results from it! I knew I had to try it immediately. I ordered my bunch, and can I just say wow! After using it for a while, I could see such a difference in the color of my teeth! The yellow was going away, and I was getting my pearly whites back! Two things really surprised me, except for the fact that it actually works and that I really saw results but, one, it&#x27;s really affordable and a lot cheaper than most whitening products on the market, and especially much cheaper than seeing a doctor to do this for you! And two, it&#x27;s super easy to use! The easiest thing ever! Can you brush your teeth? Yes? Then you can definitely use this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommended this product to anyone who wants to see results, at an affordable rate, and is something really easy to use.</li>
    <li> Feeling more confident in myself using this product. Really like seeing my white teeth in the mirror and know that I am displaying it for people. This product works well--the tray system is simple and effective and I feel like it works very fast--maybe faster than other products I have used in the past. Will keep it up.</li>
    <li> It makes sense that you have to mold the thing to your mouth. I have tried other methods and nothing ever really worked for me. Whitening strips suck. I know they have most of the market but if people would see this method they would switch. Everything fits in its place and it works great.</li>
    <li> I really thought it would take a month or two to get off the ground but amazingly enough this stuff worked quite rapidly. It was only two or three treatments to notice that my teeth are whiter and I&#x27;m proud to say that I look great now. Will continue to use this for the time being. Recommended.</li>
    <li> I have a theory about smiling and attracting more people. Positivity begets more positivity and me smiling a lot more is happening because of this product. Easy to use and I am loving the results!</li>
    <li> I have spent so much money on other whitening products that I can tell when something is good for the price or not good for the price. This product works really well and it&#x27;s at a nice price point. Lots of other products are much more expensive and give a similar experience. Great value.</li>
    <li> Sure doesn&#x27;t seem to do anything.... My dentist thinks the stuff may have expired while sitting on Amazon&#x27;s shelves. This concentration should bleach your teeth immediately, in her opinion.</li>
    <li> Tray system is superior than strips or other methods I have seen at administering teeth whitening solution. I have tried them all and by far this is the most convenient and time-saving. Will keep using it and my teeth look great. They are whiter than ever. Loving the results. Very happy.</li>
    <li> This was my very first teeth whitening kit. I thought long and hard about what product would be a good fit for my situation and my wallet. My teeth are not perfectly straight but I consider them to be really nice just because they are aligned with slight variation of placements.  Anyway I digress. Since my teeth are not straight, I decided to get the gel instead because of that reason. I was really excited when the package arrived. I couldn&#x27;t wait to try it out so I did, after reading the instruction. Followed the instruction to the T. Took some tips from other user on this site.  The trays took some time but I got them to fit my teeth the way I wanted so they were one of the good thing about the product.  I had heard someone say don&#x27;t use too much so I use a decent amount and slipped the treys in. Needless to say I felt nothing. Wore them about 10 minutes and took them off. Nothing. Next time I used a bit more. Felt some major changes, good and bad. About 2 to 3 minutes into the usage of the tray I felt some bubbling. I thought it was working but about 3 more minutes and I started to feel some gum irritation. I immediately took the tray out and OH MY GOD. My teeth did NOT change color BUT my gum changed. It had turned into a palish pink color. I wanted to cry. Luckily the color did change back. After that I use not too much but not too little.  Every time I use the gel I can feel it bubbling but after the time is up and I remove the trays my teeth are the same. No changes. I&#x27;ve used the product every other day because I was afraid of sensitivity but I didn&#x27;t have that problem. The product did nothing for me. Wasted 30 bucks and got a deadbeat product....so disappointed. I&#x27;m moving onto my next product. Whitening strips...we&#x27;ll see how those turn out...</li>
    <li> If I use this twice a week it makes me look great, I mainly also use it before dates and so far it has not done me wrong. My teeth are pretty good looking.</li>
    <li> I used this whitening kit one month before my wedding and it was totally worth it! It made my teeth shine as white as my dress, and being a big coffee drinker that was pretty good. It also didn&#x27;t make my teeth sensitive like a lot of whitening systems have in the past and I was fully able to enjoy some cocktails and cake without pain and with awesome teeth.</li>
    <li> I had some discoloration on my teeth, and decided to try a tooth whitener on my teeth. And this helped solve my problems. All it took was a few minutes. All it took was about 15 minutes. I thought it might have a strange taste, but that wasn&#x27;t the case. After I used the product all I had to do was rinse. And my smile was much brighter than before I started. I&#x27;m so glad I didn&#x27;t spend a ton of money at the dentist for tooth whitening, when I could spend far less on this product with similar results.</li>
    <li> You get one shot to make them fit your teeth right. I screwed up the bottoms and would have to buy again. The whitener seems good, but don&#x27;t believe that you can re-mold them. It didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
    <li> Due to high fluoride content in the water where I grew up, my teeth were discolored and I was desperate to smile freely.  After trying many products, I finally gave Shine a try and I must say its one of the best products out there.  In addition, to the ease of use, Shine is actually priced better and compared to Crest White Strips it&#x27;s better because the trays actually form to your mouth after heating. I would definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> I really like this product, whitens my teeth with no side effect or stinging sensation. I’ve been using this product for a few months now, about once every 4-5 days. The treatment is almost gone so I’ll be another one, and will update this review if I see any other dramatic changes.</li>
    <li> I was afraid of picture day for the past few years because my teeth did not look great. But now I used this product for maybe twice a week and my teeth are many shades lighter. Picture day is a bit better now.</li>
    <li> The tray system should be notorious.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It could sink the bigger toothpaste companies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Strips fall off my teeth and I think the trays, while they need a little bit of work up top, are a good solution to this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; It is very easy and distributes the gel on my teeth very well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; My teeth are white.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband. He didn&#x27;t mind it at all.</li>
    <li> Works well, can be tricky to use. Be sure to follow all instructions completely.</li>
    <li> Whitening strips are annoying. Fall off and are annoying. This product stays on and looks good. My teeth look great.</li>
    <li> This coffee and wine drinker needed help badly. This product reallly helped</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d much rather prefer the strips that are attached. It&#x27;s annoying to keep trays in your mouth and you really are limited to what you can do while whitening. BUT the trays were effective in whitening my teeth!</li>
    <li> Smiling a lot more after this. When I know that my teeth look pearly white it&#x27;s a great feeling, flashing smiles at strangers and girls and such. I am getting good feedback and it has worked fairly well. Doing this process about two or three times a week and this is cheap enough to keep costs low.</li>
    <li> This routine is now in my life. I brush every day, I floss just about every day, and now every week I whiten about two or three times. It makes my teeth look a lot better and it also makes my face more handsome. Trust me, try it out and give it a trial period. I almost guarantee that it will change how people look at you.</li>
    <li> My looks are boosted thanks to this. My teeth look a lot nicer. Very easy to use and simple system. Recommended.</li>
    <li> Wow!I am amazed at how white my teeth look and in such a short time. Okay so it takes me 15 minutes to use, but it&#x27;s worth the little time and effort it takes to have my pearly whites looking the way they do! As a smoker, I don&#x27;t want those nasty stains on my teeth, so this product does everything I need it to do and more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So here&#x27;s my recommendation: try Shine Whitening. If your teeth are stained and yellow, what do you have to lose? You can read all the testimonials you want, but the only way you&#x27;ll know if this works is to buy it and use it yourself. I am so glad I purchased this product and I can smile proudly now with beautiful white teeth!</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t seen much result yet but my teeth were very white already.</li>
    <li> I found I had to do this 2 times to get a really good fit. The trays themselves seem big until you heat mold then, but I didn&#x27;t have a problem with that. The only issue I had with this product was putting the solution into the trays - but I used the q-tip trick that they recommend and that seems to do the trick.  After that, put them in your mouth and really suck hard to get a perfect fit.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Crest White Strips a number of times over the years and had good results. Based upon the other reviews here, I was really hoping this was going to be an even better experience, but it was not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The main issue i found was with the trays themselves. Even after &amp;#34;molding&amp;#34; them per the instructions they only indented about 1/4&amp;#34;. This is too shallow to fit any of the gel that comes with it and so it won&#x27;t be applied to the front of your teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Too much of a pain when the strips have come so far, and are so easy to use.</li>
    <li> I have sensitive teeth. So I try to stay away from whiteners. On the other hand, my teeth are yellowing a bit. So I went with this product. Dabbed a little on and it works like a charm. No issues really and I will continue to use it when my teeth look a little down.</li>
    <li> I gave up using whitening toothpaste because it started making my teeth very sensitive but with a cup of coffee every day, my teeth started looking a bit dull and yellow. I decided to give this a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I followed the instructions of molding the trays to my teeth, it worked well. The trays fit snugly to my teeth, both top and bottom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After the first use I noticed that the whitening was very uneven, like the gel didn&#x27;t spread evenly to the surface of my teeth. With the next use, I applied the gel directly to my teeth with a cotton swap. This method works really well. The gel is very thick and stays just where I place it on my teeth, even in the spaces between. Then I put the trays in to hold the gel in place.  This way the gel stays off my gums.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I apply the gel first thing in the morning after brushing my teeth and leave the trays in while I shower and do my morning routine. This way it&#x27;s done and out of the way. I&#x27;m about five treatments in and my teeth are looking brighter. There is some sensitivity but that is to be expected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like this system much better than the white-strip method and the whitening effect has been MUCH quicker.</li>
    <li> Surprisingly I have had no issues with sensitivity. My teeth are pretty touchy and when I wanted to whiten my teeth I was not very optimistic about whether any of it would work. I used this product and I had no issues so far. I only use a little bit at a time but my teeth are much whiter than before and I have found the process easy and uncomplicated.</li>
    <li> I used this product a few weeks before my wedding day and my wedding pictures thank you for it.</li>
    <li> The whitener gel stays in my mouth. I donÃ¢(tm)t have to taste too much of it or anything, like some other products. The mouth piece keeps the gel in my mouth and nowhere else. ItÃ¢(tm)s a good system that IÃ¢(tm)m surprised hasnÃ¢(tm)t been replicated elsewhere. I use this product three times a week so it better stay if IÃ¢(tm)m going to use that much time. Results are great too.</li>
    <li> I thought the price was decent for what you get in the package. The stuff works pretty good, and you get dentist grade stuff too. I wouldnÃ¢(tm)t bother with the strips anymore. These are so much better.</li>
    <li> Secretly bought these for my husband. His teeth are horrible and he doesn&#x27;t do anything about it. Im going to tell him itÃ¢(tm)s a thing that builds his enamel. Lol.</li>
    <li> I really don&#x27;t like whitening treatment in my teeth because I think its was dangerous, but after I try this Shine whitening product I was so happy it really helps whiten my teeth with no hassle.</li>
    <li> Great price for what you get</li>
    <li> The formula has a nice taste and I enjoy using it. I&#x27;m happy it also whitens my teeth. Very fast, good results.</li>
    <li> My teeth are much better now. Thanks a ton.</li>
    <li> at first I wasn&#x27;t so sure but I gave them a try - why not right? Totally surprized! Doing the mouth guard things was neat.. Never done those before. Ill def be buying again!</li>
    <li> I really love this product. I tried it because I was told from my family members that my yellow/stained teeth really made me look older than I am. I feel and look 20 years younger with my whiter teeth. Thank you</li>
    <li> This product has an amazing effect on my teeth. I am so happy with how they turned out.</li>
    <li> I am having trouble with this item. Its extremely hard to get the tray to perfectly fit my teeth. I don&#x27;t know if the fact that I have an overbite affects the mold application, but in any case, it seems that the product is useless if the trays aren&#x27;t molded correctly. Very dissatisfied with the purchase. Will be going back to use crest whitening strips.</li>
    <li> I have lots of issues with sensitive teeth. Therefore I am touchy with what goes in my mouth because unfortunately a lot of it hurts. I have had no issues with this product I’m happy to report. Very reluctant to use it, but I think the tray system has something to do with it. Strips have a set amount of gel/fluid on it and I can control how much I put on my teeth here. Easy to use and whitens my teeth fine.</li>
    <li> The gel has a nice pleasant flavor that I do not hate. So when I do use this product I feel like I am freshening up my breath too. But more importantly my teeth look great.</li>
    <li> I have tons of issues with sensitive teeth. It’s unbearable at times. So I was scared when I wanted to whiten my teeth because I know that anything will hurt my teeth. But surprisingly, I didn’t have any issues with Shine Whitening . Pretty cool. So I used it once a week and even once I did twice a week. So far no issues, and my teeth have been looking great.</li>
    <li> Every week I brush every day, floss every day. Now I add whitening with Shine Whitening to the list. I feel great about my smile. Wonderful.</li>
    <li> My teeth are something like a couple shades brighter after using it for a week or two. The treatments work very well and I found it pretty easy to use this product. Thanks Shine Whitening.</li>
    <li> I’ve seen this kind of product in the store for a lot more and the competitors try to up the price a lot. I bought this and used it and for what it does I think that this is a very good value. My teeth got as white and I enjoy the results a lot.</li>
    <li> I have been around the world looking for teeth whitening products so I know what I’m talking about. This Shine Whitening stuff is great for the price. I have paid a lot more for the same type of thing, and I think it’s a bargain. Really jump on this one. The tray system is revolutionary and easy to use.</li>
    <li> My teeth have been worn down into yellow for a while now, just due to time and perhaps mild neglect. I decided to do something about it and purchased this product. It worked like a charm. My teeth are a few shades lighter and I am surprised it worked in under a handful of treatments. Very cool.</li>
    <li> The gel included in Shine Whitening  is particularly good for me because there is a mild to no aftertaste. I am very sensitive to strong chemical flavoring I even have to purchase special kinds of toothpaste and mouthwash. It works as well as my specially purchased products and my teeth are noticeably whiter than when I started about a month ago. The tray system is fine and it does not take too much time. Happy with results.</li>
    <li> Flat out my teeth look better than they did two weeks ago. I did this product for a handful of treatments and it’s a world of difference. See for yourself. It’s comparably to whiteners like strips or something like that but I think it’s a bit cheaper for my wallet and also it’s got a good system that makes more sense intuitively.</li>
    <li> The tray system is awesome. You have to bite down on some rubber and mold it to the shape of your mouth. But in the end it saves so much time. I can just put it in my mouth for fifteen minutes a few times a week and watch something on tv. Very easy and will be using again.</li>
    <li> I have tons of issues with sensitive teeth. It’s unbearable at times. So I was scared when I wanted to whiten my teeth because I know that anything will hurt my teeth. But surprisingly, I didn’t have any issues with Shine. Pretty cool. So I used it once a week and even once I did twice a week. So far no issues, and my teeth have been looking great.</li>
    <li> I used to hate looking at pictures of myself. My teeth were not as white as I wanted them to be. But after Shine my teeth are pretty much how I want them to look. Use it and it’s easy. Put the tray in the mouth for about fifteen minutes a session for a couple times a week and my teeth are looking a lot better than before.</li>
    <li> I love teeth whitening strips, but the major problem is that I am a klutz and they always fasten onto my teeth all crooked and fall off. I wait the fifteen or twenty minutes or whatever and I open my mouth to reveal I’ve messed it all up. Well I found Shine Whitening  and I can even talk and stuff while it does the work. It has a tray system that stays in the mouth and works while I can do every day things. One time I did it while I went to deposit a check at the bank (my bank is really close to my apartment). Good stuff and white teeth.</li>
    <li> This stuff doesn’t slip off my teeth like other products. Love it. My teeth are way whiter than they started. I enjoy whitening my teeth. It gives me less pause when I smile and for a few years I had a smoking habit. My teeth are whiter within two weeks, using it about twice a week. This product has good results from me and I feel great about my mouth now.</li>
    <li> This is the best whitening system that I&#x27;ve tried, I like the tray soo much better than the strips (it gets every inch instead of coming out splotchy) You just have to e careful around the gums because they can be irritated a little but other than that good product</li>
    <li> Tray system beats out strips and other ways of administering teeth whitening solution to your teeth. Often strips fall out of my mouth and have trouble sticking on. This one has no trouble at all, it is made to fit perfectly in your mouth. My teeth have never been whiter and this product worked in a very fast amount of time. Only a handful of treatments before my teeth looked pretty great.</li>
    <li> I have extremely sensitive teeth. I can’t even drink cold water without actually wincing in pain sometimes. So I am actually scared at what bleach or whatever can do to my teeth. I don’t know what’s in these whitening products. Whatever is in this one doesn’t affect me too much though. I use it about once a week and it whitens my teeth. No issues. Great news.</li>
    <li> At first I was dubious; I had tried a few similar products and had very little success with them so, when my good friend recommended these particular whitening strips, I had pretty low expectations. Well let me tell you, I was blown away! Not only are these whitening strips really easy to use, they&#x27;re way more effective than any of the other ones I&#x27;ve tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Given that they&#x27;re much cheaper than a professional dental cleaning, I thoroughly recommend these. Do your smile a favor and get these!</li>
    <li> The two other reviews by David McClain and Matthew Schusler that revealed that this product received false reviews had ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTY &amp;#34;people&amp;#34; (bots) claim it as &amp;#34;not helpful&amp;#34; within TEN hours!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Additionally, ALL the reviewers came up within one week of the release of this product and degrade other products, only to redirect to this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You don&#x27;t just risk buying a crappy product, you risk having your personal information stolen. Avoid it</li>
    <li> The mouth tray is molded to your teeth and it stays in your mouth, it makes a lot more sense. The people behind the strips should have came out of the gate with this style of whitening hardware. The results I’ve found are similar so I guess I will continue to use this product.</li>
    <li> I do it once a week because of my sensitivity. It works out and I have no issues. My teeth were maybe whiter in less time than other people but it still worked out and it was painless for me, which is more important.</li>
    <li> This product didn&#x27;t whiten my teeth in the slightest. They just need a slight boost, as they&#x27;re relatively white as it is, but there wasn&#x27;t even a minor effect. Complete waste of money.</li>
    <li> I use Shine Whitening about three times a week and so far so good. I am feeling a lot more confident and my teeth really look a lot better, like maybe two or three shades lighter. Very cool. I would recommend this product it worked a lot faster than I thought and it was at a good price point versus other products.</li>
    <li> I have used it for 6 days so far and I see my teeth getting whiter it&#x27;s awesome I didn&#x27;t think I would get such fast results. You should watch the video first and watch how they set it up it&#x27;s simple and easy.</li>
    <li> I am have always had superior oral hygiene, but making sure that my teeth stay white has been a challenge. I have tried brushing with baking soda (Yuk!) as well as a variety of other so called, &amp;#34;whitening&amp;#34; toothpastes. After many years of disappointing results, I bought a national brand that promised teeth whitening with the toothpaste and the rinse. This was a terrible experience and the product stained my teeth. Fast forward, I get a tip from a friend to try out Shine Whitening. She bought two boxes and gave me one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was pretty burnt out trying different things, but thought I would give this product a try. Oh my goodness! It is awesome! This the best home whitening system around. You simply follow the instructions and watch your teeth whiten. A few things you must know while using this product. Overloading the tray can cause gum discomfort. The instructions clearly state adding the right amount of gel for best results. You must rinse your mouth thoroughly after the gel process. The gel and the strips together ensure very effective whitening that rivals professional results. I am very pleased with my teeth now and recommend this product to anyone looking for a quality teeth whitening product at home.</li>
    <li> I had been looking for an effective tooth whitening product for a bit. I drink a lot of soda and tea, so I wanted to have an alternative to the dentist, something I could utilize more frequently. I found this looking for something that was both relatively inexpensive and most importantly effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I opened it up, I was weary because I had never used a kit like this before, I didn&#x27;t want to mess it up, but it was simple enough. The tray fit comfortably in my mouth and the gel didn&#x27;t agitate my gums or anything. Using this in tandem with regular brushing habits there is a noticeable difference, this is a good product.</li>
    <li> Wow! I really can&#x27;t believe my luck in finding a tooth whitening kit that really works. This product is super easy to use. I suggest watching the setup video that is available so you can see the process before you do it yourself.  You&#x27;ll start with getting the trays ready to put on your teeth.  After you soak the trays and insert them in your mouth, you will find them comfortable and fitting great.  The gel can be easily put into the trays and has a slight minty taste that makes it feel more like a toothpaste.&lt;br /&gt;I have noticed my teeth have become a few shades whiter.  That is incredible after years of drinking tea and eating lots of berries.  The value of this product is also fantastic.  With free shipping it is even more of a super deal!&lt;br /&gt;You could pay a lot more and go to a professional dentist, but I think you get the same results with this product for a lot less money and the convenience of whitening your teeth in the comfort of your own home!!</li>
    <li> I hate writing reviews, this one is my first bad product review, and I&#x27;m writing this out to warn any buyers out there that are questing this product, I was going through the crest white strips and a comment led me to this product where I saw most of the reviews were great, which soon I find out are truly flooded with fakes. The packaging sticker was used and dirty, the tubes of the gel do not stay contained they leak out and pop everywhere, most comment stated they saw improvement after 1 sitting, today was my 4th sitting with me varying around 10-20 minutes per sitting, so I was curious if I was doing this wrong so i went to the comments and check for any suggestions which led me to find the one stars that showed clearly this garbage that this company is selling. BY THE WAY I paid 35$ for this crappy product, with that money I might as well have bought the crest white strips for another 5$ and have been happy. This is coming from someone who has good dental hygiene, and have used different whitening methods before, and crest strips literally far better than investing into this product, for your sake take me word and buy something else for teeth whitening!!!!!</li>
    <li> This is pretty easy to use.  I didn&#x27;t have any trouble getting the molds to work right.  If you played football in high school or college then you have some experience with molding a mouth piece.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Applying the gel was easy with the provided syringes.  The taste wasn&#x27;t all that great but it wasn&#x27;t horrible either.  I did notice that if I used this 3 days in a row my gums would get irritated.  So I used them every couple of days.  For the price its a good deal compared to other offers and it does make a noticeable difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will buy this again.</li>
    <li> Product works pretty good. Not as well as my dentist supplied product, but doesn&#x27;t cost as much either.</li>
    <li> This whitening kit is the only one I will use from now on! It was so easy to use, unlike some other complicated kits I&#x27;ve tried. And believe me, I&#x27;ve tried. I&#x27;ve used the ones I&#x27;ve seen on TV, ones in mall kiosks, etc, and yeah I thought they would work because of all the great advertisement. Wrong! Other stuff has been messy, has broken, has hurt (no way to get some trays to fit in my small mouth), and this is only the beginning of my list of problems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I swore to myself this was the last product I&#x27;d buy to try at home, if it didn&#x27;t work I was going to suck it up and pay the ridiculous amount to get it done professionally. This product was relatively cheap compared to others, so it made me kind of scared that it too wouldn&#x27;t work, but I couldn&#x27;t shell out another ton of money for something I wasn&#x27;t sure it would work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And then it did work! The mouth trays fit really well in my mouth after I heated them and the instructions were very simply to read and not confusing like some I&#x27;ve read (two things I had major problems with with other kits). I repeated the process for 16 days (box says between 15 and 30) and for once I was happy a product hadn&#x27;t lied to me! My teeth were whiter, brighter, and didn&#x27;t stain nearly as easily afterwards. I absolutely recommend this to anyone who has been having problems with the popular brands that just don&#x27;t do their jobs.</li>
    <li> I have drank blank coffee since I was fourteen so my teeth have been an unpleasant shade of yellow-white.  I have tried Crest Stripes and didn&#x27;t really see an effect.  My coworker who has teeth as white as paper suggested this and after using it I can see a HUGE difference.  My teeth are slowing turning from shades of yellow to white.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I love about this product is that is it a no brainer to use.  It is super easy and uncomplicated.  When heated, the mouth trays fit PERFECTLY into my mouth and I have a huge jaw according to my dentist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The best part of this is the price, I love now I can fit it into my budget.  I highly recommend this product.  I wish I can submit before and after pictures :)</li>
    <li> I am obsessed with having white teeth, as I am a compulsive perfectionist! So I am always on the lookout for teeth whitening products that are safe and won&#x27;t strip the enamel or have any annoying side effects. So in the Shine Whitening kit you get 2 5cc syringes, whitening gel, plus top and bottom mouth trays. I followed the directions and put a small drop on the outsides of the arch part in the tray, then i spread it with the syringe. I repeated this for the bottom tray and put the trays in my mouth for 15 minutes (I set my timer).  I was very satisfied with the results! There is a chart that comes with the kit, (this chart is really cool!) you hold the chart to the mirror while flashing a smile to see your before and after shade, there are number letter combinations and you pick the one that fits your shade. For example I went from a C2 to a B1! My husband was so impressed he has purchased a kit!  With this kit I didn&#x27;t experience sensitivity from the gel, which was awsome because I have in the past. I think Shine Whitening does not have the sensitivity due to the fact that the gel is applied to the outside layers of the trays, and so the gel never touches your gums. It removes the stains from the outside, yet it is very effective, I  am a coffee addict and you could never tell! The results lasted me for around a month and 2 weeks, but everyone is different but It will at least last a month, I mean the results are amazing! Like I said I am an around the clock coffee drinker and The kit withstood the coffee for a month and 2 weeks! This is good for smokers too! I paid a visit to my dentist 2 weeks after my treatment wore off and I was not tormented with sensitive gums and was able to get an A+ on my exam! So overall the Shine Whitening kit doesn&#x27;t leave any nasty side effects, like the buildup and sensitivity some gels cause, lasts at least a month and is ideal for regular coffee drinkers and smokers, and the results made my teeth 4 shades lighter according to the chart that comes with the kit. I will be purchasing Shine Whitening again. I got mine from a friend she had an extra kit from a 2 pack she bought a while back but now that I have found them on amazon I will get them here.chart that comes with the kit. I will be purchasing Shine Whitening again. I got mine from a friend she had an extra kit from a 2 pack she bought a while back but now that I have found them on amazon I will get them here.</li>
    <li> I still have bad habits so I need to combat them with a teeth whitener. I found this and it’s part of my routine now. My teeth have become whiter and remained that way. I use it about twice a week and I find it’s not difficult to use this product and the gel actually has a nice pleasant taste to it.</li>
    <li> I’m one of those people who have sensitive teeth. I appreciate that and it works out because my teeth were unharmed using this product and specially it really whitens my teeth.</li>
    <li> Since then it’s all been cigarettes coffee and late nights without brushing. My mouth is a trash hole. But after using this for a few weeks, I have seen noticeably results. And the result are the best.</li>
    <li> Simple process here, if you&#x27;re willing to do a tiny bit of work up top. Need to mold it to your mouth but after it will fit like a glove every time. My teeth thank you.</li>
    <li> Thank you for allowing me to drink coffee on a regular basis. I love the fact that my stains are gone.</li>
    <li> You get a lot of product for what you need. It is worth the money.</li>
    <li> forget going to the dentist for whitening. This product is far less expensive ans does sucha better job. My stains were gone within a week of using shine whitening</li>
    <li> could really see the difference.</li>
    <li> My teeth are whiter and it’s so easy to use, it doesn’t slip out of your mouth and you know the gel is sticking to your teeth. Nice product. I love it.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for just a couple of days and already see an improvement in the brightness of my smile!  The instructions are easy to read and the application is so easy.  I&#x27;m really excited to see the finished result!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been looking for an affordable solution to whiten my teeth for sometime.  This is a much better design than anything I have used in the past.  The trays are a superior method (as opposed to flimsy strips) and really hold the whitening gel in place right where it is needed.  I definitely recommend this product for everyone!</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t believe how well this works! I&#x27;ll admit I was a bit skeptical when I first put the retainer on but I was pleasantly surprised when I found out how comfortable it was. It&#x27;s only been a week and I&#x27;m already getting compliments on my smile! I&#x27;m totally in shock over how quick and well this works. I feel so confident when I smile and am no longer afraid to show off my teeth.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s so simple to use that anyone who isn&#x27;t using it is missing out a great opportunity for a confidence boost. Young adults looking for a decent job - jump on this. It&#x27;s not just a cosmetic device, it&#x27;s a brilliant way to get in the right state of mind for a professional outing. Also, my mother - who just got back in the dating scene - asked for a set for Mother&#x27;s Day. Now that she has a beautiful smile, she says her little black book is filling up with numbers. Having a great set of teeth really does get you closer to being carefree.</li>
    <li> This is definitely a fake product. DO NOT BUY&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As people here pointed out, I came across this product from a review for Crest 3D, I said why not give a try? I understand most the of concerns that the reviews are fake and paid by the seller, so I this review will be updated daily. This is my first day of using it. ( 06/20/2014) I started suing it on Friday and on Monday of the same week I already had my 6-month cleaning done at my dentist&#x27;s, I use an electric brush, floss, and rinse twice a day. I have 11 fillings and two crowns, so you will get to know a lot about this product from this review :)&lt;br /&gt;****First day  ( 06/20/2014)****&lt;br /&gt;1- Let me tell you I couldn&#x27;t find an FDA approval anywhere on the product which could signal a bad sign,&lt;br /&gt;2- I started my day as usual brushing my teeth and using the rinse afterwards. I didn&#x27;t eat anything till noon. I told my self try to use the product just before lunch.&lt;br /&gt;3- Before I use it I read the questions on Amazon carefully and how to use the trays. Once you put them in hot water they become very flexible and floppy! Don&#x27;t submerge them over a minute or they will shrink! As a matter of fact I had of them shrunk by 2 mm from both ends compared to the other tray. Once the trays are floppy, put them on your teeth and make sure you press hard around the circular part of the try to make them mold and take the shape of your teeth. I can say this part was a bit tricky as you get only one chance to mold the piece to your teeth or you will have  to buy another tray. I did this successfully and the tray really fit my teeth in an amazing way. After the successful completion of this step, you can apply the gel to the tray.&lt;br /&gt;4- I applied a very small amount of gel (5 mm or less) then put the tray on my teeth for 10 minutes , I couldn&#x27;t put it for more than that because the gel started to burn one part of my gums. I don&#x27;t say burn all my gums but it whitened and burned a small line above one of my teeth. I brushed afterwards and the white line was gone after 2 hours.&lt;br /&gt;5- As a matter of fact I didn&#x27;t eat after using the product for 3 hours, but the gel is really refreshing&lt;br /&gt;5- I looked at the mirror and I can say there is a small difference after the first day for sure.&lt;br /&gt;6  I can attest to the fact that your gum will be bothering you for the first 5 hours after first use. ( first day experience but don&#x27;t know if this will last for the coming days or not)&lt;br /&gt;7- The 2 syringes that comes with this product have 50 mm of gel so you can do 10 treatments as recommended by the seller.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;****Second day  ( 06/21/2014)****&lt;br /&gt;1- It has been more than 20 hours since I did my first treatment&lt;br /&gt;2- I looked at their website where I found a video that shows how to mold the trays correctly. The one explaining that in the vides asserts that you will be able to mold it again once you heat it. I tried but in vain since the tray has already shrunk and some ends folded onto itself. This confirms my experience that you have only one shot to mold the trays.&lt;br /&gt;3- Used the gel as yesterday, now I can say I can feel burns around my gums. I can see 5 white lines beneath my teeth in the lower part.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;****Third day (06/22/2014)******&lt;br /&gt;1- I am maintaining my daily habits. Used less gel today to overcome sensitivity. The sensitivty usually goes after 24 hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***Forth Day (06/23/2014)*******&lt;br /&gt;1- Used my water-pik today and my gums couldn&#x27;t handle it, so I decided I am not going to use the product today&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***Fifth day (07/24/2014)********&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t use it to help cure my sensitivity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**7th day (06/25/2014)*****&lt;br /&gt;There is no more sensitivity in my gums so I started using it again it but turns out that how little gel you use you still burn your gums. Tomorrow I will try to apply the gel directly to my teeth instead of the tray and I will report on the results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;** last day day *****&lt;br /&gt;I stopped using it all together as I noticed that my gums started to recede !I can see more and more of my teeth each time I use it. This is definitely a fake product. DO NOT BUY</li>
    <li> I really recommend it</li>
    <li> This product is amazing! It made my teeth so white, I&#x27;ve never seen it that white before! This product just blew my mind. It was easy to use and didn&#x27;t take that much time. It was definitely worth using it. I can finally smile white nice tooths and clean. I highly recommend this if you want white tooth really fast!</li>
    <li> My teeth are incredibly white and I can feel it.I got a flashing white smile that I can brag to everyone.</li>
    <li> I use the tray thing and put it in my mouth about four times a week because my teeth get a little sensitive for every day use. But even though I seldom use this product still it has big difference to my teeth. Now I can see clearly now my teeth are very white.</li>
    <li> I cannot speak to the quality of the product inside of the syringe because once I opened it, it goo-ed out on it&#x27;s own volition with vigor. I placed the cap on tightly and by morning (if not moments later), the product had leaked considerably. I tried pullng the lever back before replacing the cap - it made no difference, it leaked everywhere. When it got close to the end of the first one, it did 2 things - 1. spat great globs out at the slightest touch 2. the black from the syringe packaging leaked into the whitener. The same issues happened with the second syringe. I was able to eek 4 uses out of 2 syringes. Maybe I had a faulty batch of packaging. I would be willing to try again, but I would not pay to do so.</li>
    <li> IT BURNS! IT BURNS! IT BURNS! It MAY actually whiten your teeth a bit, but at the cost of sore and painful gums! My suggestion ... NO... NO! NO! NO! DO NOT SUBJECT YOURSELF TO THE TORTURE ~ A .... PS Even if it didn&#x27;t hurt so much - the gel in the syringes is sooooo thick and viscose that it is impossible to apply only the thin layer suggested into your tooth trays! I would fit my trays on, only to have a large amount of goo squish out along the top and bottom lines (which I removed with a q-tip) So, as a result - (again, even if I LIKED it, which I DO NOT!) the product lasted hardly any time at all. I have since had &amp;#34;ZOOM&amp;#34; at my dentist&#x27;s office, with each additional tube only $10;  PERFECT if you just want to brighten up a bit for a special occasion :-D So nope, I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT IN THE LEAST!!</li>
    <li> Good product, works quickly. I just brush on with a q-tip and then put mouth tray in. It seems to spread and work best this way.</li>
    <li> Glorious product! I am a big coffee drinker, though it gives me energy for my day.. It&#x27;s been leaving a last impression my teeth..&lt;br /&gt;And I had a big family get together coming up, and I needed a something that would take years of stains away on my teeth, brushing alone was just not enough, I am so glad I bought this! It was very easy to use, the instructions where simple, direct and this product indeed got the job done, I noticed a sparkling white smile in just a matter of hours after using it. Truly a life saver! :)</li>
    <li> Wow. I really love this product. I&#x27;ve been dealing with coffee-stained teeth for years and had given up that there would actually be something that worked on my old stubborn teeth. But the Shine Whitening kit really worked. Now I&#x27;m actually not embarrassed to flash these pearly whites again. Been a long time since I didn&#x27;t instinctively hide my smile with my hand when I was laughing.  And I never would have even tried Shine Whitening if it wasn&#x27;t at such a great price. I figured, well, I really don&#x27;t have much to lose, so I gave it a go. I&#x27;m so glad I did! This will most definitely be the last teeth whitening product I use. Finally... found what I needed. I&#x27;m sure not going to stop drinking coffee any time soon. Drink all the coffee I want AND have super-white teeth. Sweet! Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> Both syringes leaked during shipping. Small amount of gel everywhere inside the container. The first syringe I opened had air pressure built up so the gel squeezed out. Both syringes already came with about 1 cc of air and the first syringe lost about 1 cc of gel from the air expansion. So... I have about 7 cc of gel to use. Hopefully the product works.</li>
    <li> I am 42 years old and have smoked, drank coffee and alcohol for years, and to make matters worse I have had both my upper front teeth repaired due to being chipped as a child. The repaired areas always yellow faster than the real tooth area. I am extremely self conscious about this so I have been trying different products for some time without much luck. It seems that the whitening products are cumbersome and difficult to use and the results lackluster at best. My dentist whitened my teeth which was great for a hefty sum of money and the results were fantastic.&lt;br /&gt;With financial times being what they are now I can&#x27;t afford my dentist&amp;#34;s services anymore. So back I went to whitening toothpastes and storebought gimmicks to try to whiten my teeth. Of course there was no noticeable difference with these products. While at my dentist for a routine cleaning she mentioned this product sold by amazon that someone had told her about. shine whitening. The patient told her it was kind of difficult to use and didn&#x27;t offer miraculous results instantly but with persistence and a little time, it was the best option out there for the money. She explained that she was not endorsing the product as she had not tried the product herself she was merely passing on information that she heard. I figured for around thirty bucks what did I have to lose.&lt;br /&gt;I bought the product. It took some time to get used to. I didn&#x27;t notice anything for a week or so than after a week or two my teeth seemed to be getting whiter. I kept up with good brushing habits especially after coffee. Also I try to stay clear of sweets and junk food. After about 3 weeks I could not tell were my teeth had been chipped and repaired and the yellowing was gone. Needless to say I was pleased with the results.  If the product were a little less messy and better directions definitely five stars.</li>
    <li> If you have a smaller mouth, don&#x27;t bother with this product.  The molds are impossible to get to fit over my teeth.  I ended up trashing this and ordering the strips. They are working much better.  I usually trust Amazon reviews but this product is totally not worth the money spent.</li>
    <li> Just finished using this product, I thought I would write a detailed review about it:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First off, the box comes in a simple clear packaging, with a short list of instructions, and which also points you to a more advanced video on their website (which I would suggest using so that you get the best fit for your mouthpiece). Inside the box, you get two tubes of the carbamide peroxide teeth whitening gel + mouthpiece, which is actually a lot because you honestly don&#x27;t need much… I have a lot left over.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing I would say is you really want to focus on using as little of the gel as possible. Think of how much you might need, and then use half of that amount. If you use too much, the gel will spill out of the mouthpiece and irritate your gums.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I personally didn&#x27;t have a problem with the strength of the gel, but everybody has a different set of teeth. If you have sensitive teeth, don&#x27;t use the gel for too long at one time as this type of whitening (well, any kind of whitening), will make your teeth more sensitive than usual. If you are finding its too sensitive, use it every other day instead of every day. It will increase the time it takes to get your teeth white, but I would rather wait a little longer, than have sensitive teeth every day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall this product seems like pretty good value, it seems like its a fairly high quality product. After my results (I at least gained 2 shades which is amazing), i figure that Ill buy a couple more sets of these and buying it for the rest of my family. We drink so much coffee that our teeth just aren&#x27;t as white as they should be. </li>
    <li> I have to say that I was unfortunately disappointed in this purchase. The molding of the mouth trays was no problem. I found them comfortable for the most part, at least for the 20 minutes a day that they are used. The first time I used the gel, I noticed that there was quite a lot of bubbling in the tray. I figured this was the peroxide doing its thing. But I did find it uncomfortable and where the gel touched my gums, my gums turned white! They stayed white for about an hour after I&#x27;d rinsed the product out. I also noticed that I drooled a horrible amount during the treatment. So bad I had to sit with a towel under my chin. And at the end of the treatments (which I think took about 8 or 9 days), my teeth were no whiter. The only thing I got from this product were good mouth trays that I can use with a different whitening gel product in the future.</li>
    <li> This product did whiten my teeth, but unfortunately, I paid a price for it. I couldn&#x27;t help but swallow a bit of it, and it was like pouring acid into my stomach. I think it can be hazardous to one&#x27;s health. I had previously used Crest Whitestrips, and my problem with them was that they didn&#x27;t adhere well to my teeth. After throwing out this product, I tried the newer Whitestrips, and they adhere very well. I&#x27;m sticking with them from now on.</li>
    <li> I have too much coffee in my life. That&#x27;s it. It is doing great things for my brain and keeping me going in life but the one downside for now is that it is yellowing my teeth a bit. I used this product to fight that and it turns out it worked. My teeth are a lot whiter now and I love it. Easy to use and fast working.</li>
    <li> This is a simple and easy way to whiten your teeth. The tray system is good and might take some work but it is good for you in the end. Molds to your teeth.</li>
    <li> impressed with how well this product stuck to my teeth. Easy to use on the way to work</li>
    <li> Whiter teeth just gives me more confidence. I don&#x27;t know about the rest of you, but it does for me. I look in the mirror and flash myself a smile and people may know I am checking myself out but I just want to look good. It works out in my favor though. I get good feedback for how I look and I have only been using this product for maybe a few weeks. Good stuff all around.</li>
    <li> The trays fit in your mouth and you do have to mold them in the beginning but they fit your mouth after. ItÃ¢(tm)s like a personalized mouth guard for a contact sport. But this whitens your teeth. I use it three times a week and my teeth are much better than before.</li>
    <li> Years of coffee has wrecked my teeth. They are all yellow and not appealing. But I used this product a handful of times and so far so good. It worked much faster than expected. My teeth are looking great every single day. I can keep my coffee and also use this stuff here. Glad to see it works.</li>
    <li> The trays never created good enough impressions to follow the written instructions, and the video on their web site is non-functional using IE and Chrome both.</li>
    <li> I would buy this product again.</li>
    <li> This one works and very effective on my teeth. Like it much.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t had very positive experiences with teeth whitening kits in the past, but was pleasantly surprised with the results from Shine Whitening. While this product shouldn&#x27;t be used in place of going to the dentist, it does result in giving you whiter teeth in a short period of time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, the molding is quite easy to use. In fact, it is much easier than the Crest White Strips, which for me, were a hassle to put on and quite messy to remove.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Instructions are included within the box and are very simple to understand. If you have sensitive teeth like myself, I highly suggest to slowly increase the amount of gel you use per whitening or take a few days off between each use to keep the sensitivity to a minimal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Personally, I saw results within the first four treatments and would highly recommend it. Your smile is usually the first thing people see when you meet them and this product will make sure your teeth look great.</li>
    <li> I was very impressed with how quickly I got this package and also how quickly it makes my teeth white. Just using this 3 times it has really big difference on my teeth.</li>
    <li> This one is not too bad because of the tray. It&#x27;s not messy so you don&#x27;t end up tasting it as much. My teeth were also okay after using it. Nice product.</li>
    <li> My teeth are noticeably whiter and I’m happy with the results. Will continue to use this product.</li>
    <li> If you have sensitive teeth, I would use it for a few minutes less than instructed and make sure you follow instructions but I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;ll be as great as my results too.</li>
    <li> Will continue to use because it&#x27;s really effective in whitening my teeth.</li>
    <li> This is product not like those other brand that is made from China. This is 100% made in USA</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t really tell if i&#x27;m doing the procedure correctly due to the weird and non- in depth instructions. The whitening surprisingly works pretty well. But it&#x27;s a bit annoying to use.</li>
    <li> I wanted to try whitening my teeth as I’m in a friend’s wedding party next month.  After using other at-home teeth whiteners in the past, with little or no results, I wasn’t expecting much upon purchasing.  I’m pleasantly surprised, however, that after using it for just a couple of weeks I already notice a difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It’s super easy to use (I normally just apply before getting in the shower, or while watching TV), quick, and I haven’t experienced any discomfort or sensitivity.  I also appreciate how affordable it is compared to some other systems.</li>
    <li> Hopefully this is a fair review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found the mouth pieces cumbersome for me, like way too big for my mouth. I was hoping for it to adhere to shapes and ridges of the front of my teeth (where I would want the whitening) but I mostly got just a bite impression out of it. Yes, I did leave in the boiling-hot (but not bubbling boiling) water as per the instructions until it got malleable. I followed written and video instructions closely. I sucked in the mouth pieces for it to form, but it wasn&#x27;t very good at doing so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I put the solution in the mouthpiece and put them in, and both pieces in at once was too much but I thought I would bear it. I could have (and would suggest to those of you with the same problem) to put the mouth piece one at a time but I was too impatient. I used less than a drop per facet, because it doesn&#x27;t really dispense in drops (it is too thick), so I started off putting very little, smearing it across the fronts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I squashed my tongue away to avoid the taste. There was a slight discomfort all around. I felt a slight agitation and thought the mouth piece wasn&#x27;t fitting properly so I bit down and continued. After 5 minutes, I couldn&#x27;t take it anymore and removed it. A part of the back of my gums had &#x27;burned&#x27;. They were white. The taste came to me all of a sudden and I just threw everything away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t attest to how much they whiten teeth (they whiten gums very well), so I apologize. I chose to believe the reviews. In my case, the products of this system did not work out for me. It is too uncomfortable and the solution too strong for me. I will have to go back to using whitening strips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For others, use very little solution and hopefully the product will adjust better for you.</li>
    <li> I only used this product for maybe a few weeks before I noticed my teeth were a lot whiter than before. This is great news. I thought it would take a lot longer. But no. My teeth look great and I enjoy using this product more than other ones. The system is simple and the gel tastes like mint. I like mint.</li>
    <li> The tray system molds to your mouth and teeth—it can’t get simpler than that. Strip systems and other ways are tough because they keep slipping off and whatnot. I have lots of trouble with them. But not so with Shine. It slips right in there and the gel evenly distributes and makes my teeth look sparkly white. Enjoying it.</li>
    <li> The tray makes sense. I don’t want stuff falling off my teeth, like wheatpasted posters or something. The tray is simple and I can whiten my teeth as I watch some television.</li>
    <li> Received the item just fine, but am unable to use it because the trays can NOT be put in hot water like the directions suggest. I waited until the washer boiled, let it cool for a minute or two and put the tray in, and it completely melted into a glob. Unusable.</li>
    <li> Let me start this review off with some background. I’m a burgeoning hand model so I keep my hands in tip top shape. I always get complimented on my hands, but since I started whitening my teeth nobody is talking about my hands, which look like commercial hands. My hands are my life, my work. I started using Shine Whitening  and people are not talking about my hands anymore, they’re talking about my teeth. Too bad there’s no such thing as a teeth model. Well I guess there is but my mouth is uneven and weird, not like my symmetrical, beautiful hands. Anyway, my hands are not garnering any attention maybe I’ll have to stop using this stuff so people talk about my hands more. Nah, I’ll just have to find the Shine Whitening  for my hands.</li>
    <li> I don’t like brushing my teeth because it saves me five minutes a night. I live alone and don’t plan on marrying so it’s not a problem. I guess I was born with strong teeth. Well recently they started to yellow a little bit so I had to find a solution. I wanted something that I could set it and let it do its job. Shine Whitening is here for you. I play Minecraft and I stick them in between sessions and now I don’t have to feel like a total slob when I’m at work where I’m a video game tester. I fixed the only problem in my life. Thanks, Shine Whitening.</li>
    <li> Received the package on a timely manner, but when I went to take it out the mouth pieces were stuck (melted) together and then stuck to the instructions.  I tried to unstick them in warm water but only ended up ripping them to the point where I can&#x27;t use the product now.  I was so looking forward to using this product from all the great reviews, but bummed now that I had to throw it away...just a waste of money now.</li>
    <li> For someone who drinks coffee and wine on a regular basis product really made a difference. I noticed a pretty siginificant different using the first treatment, and with the second, all those pesky stains were almost entirely gone. Overall, it&#x27;s worked much better than all the others I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
    <li> It took a few weeks but my teeth have whitened up. I like the tray system better for me which is why I stuck with the product. I will continue to use it to see if my results get even better.</li>
    <li> There is a second gel that helps with sensitivity and the rebuilding of enamel on your teeth. Your enamel is actually yellow, fun fact. The outer protection is the white part. This product works well and I am very happy with the results. My teeth are whiter and I have more confidence in my day to day.</li>
    <li> I have had stains on my teeth for years and have tried multiple products to remove them. So far I really like this one. It is so easy to apply and use that I don&#x27;t even have to think about it. I like that it works without much help from me.</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t be more happy! I love how much whiter they are. I am a smoker and coffee drinker of more than 20 years. I was very excited to see my teeth shades whiter. It is pretty easy to use and the directions are simple to follow. I&#x27;ll be using this product again and again!</li>
    <li> I love this! I&#x27;ve been usin it for the last couple of weeks and i&#x27;ve really noticed how my teeth are just getting really clean and white. I love this and I wasn&#x27;t very sure at the beginning but it&#x27;s really good now that i&#x27;ve tried it. I would recommend this product to anyone who wants some really professional product to get their teeth beautiful!</li>
    <li> This is the best teeth whitener i&#x27;ve ever used. I smoke cigarettes and drink caffeine &amp; always will so i&#x27;m always looking for the next best teeth whitening product. I can definitely see the difference in the whiteness of my teeth compared to how they were before. This actually worked better than when I used to go to the dentist to get my teeth cleaned.</li>
    <li> As for the product itself it works as advertised, my teeth are whiter and I’m happy with the results. It fits in your mouth perfectly from then on if you didn’t screw up. Easy to use.</li>
    <li> I use this Shine Whitening two to three times a week and I feel great. My moves have confidence. Thanks Shine Whitening.</li>
    <li> Teeth have never looked better, I have to say. I use this three times a week and the results have been phenomenal.</li>
    <li> The trays work well for me. You have to bite down on it when you first get the package. Run it under hot water and fit them to your mouth. Now you have a personalized mouth piece. You can fill it up with the gel and stick it back into your mouth and wait a number of minutes then rinse your mouth. It’s a pretty simple process and works very well. My teeth look awesome.</li>
    <li> It could be from my coffee habit, it could be from all those other things life gives you that you want to put in your mouth. But I didn’t really know to fix those things earlier. The teeth whitening trend passed me by a bit. But not anymore. I looked on Amazon for reviews for an easy to use product. I found it here in Shine Whitening and for sure now my teeth look great and probably were able to take off five years worth of coffee drinks. The tray is simple and easy to use. I’m glad this is an easy way to improve one’s lifestyle.</li>
    <li> My sister ordered this on my account and I have to say her teeth are looking pretty darn white.</li>
    <li> Minimal to no change after 10 days. It certainly did not work for me. The tips of my teeth look wither. That&#x27;s all.</li>
    <li> I am a coffee drinker and for obvious reason I was feeling the necessity to clean my teeth  because I was getting some shadows and a little dark points. I bought a lot of dental creams with differences kind of formulas and ingredients.  But with Shine I found a rest and for any reason I thought to leave the coffee. Now I am smiling bigger than before! Thanks Shine!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a solution to whiter, healthier looking teeth for years and now it exists! I used to smoke but have since quit due to the adverse effects it having on my body and appearance, and have gotten myself feeling and looking better since then except for my pearly whites. I&#x27;ve been to dentists for cleanings but could not find any options til now for effectively (and cost-friendly) whitening my teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s so easy: Just submerge the trays into a cup of warm water, adjust trays to the shape of your mouth, and spread about a drops worth of solution on to the trays. Pop the trays in for a few minutes, rinse, and your teeth will be as pearly white as any TV commercial advertises - all at a fraction of the cost! I&#x27;ve never felt better about my teeth, I smile wide everywhere I go now. You owe it to your mouth to give it a try.</li>
    <li> This teeth whitening kit is the key to my every day happiness because of all the compliments I got. I had to share my little secret with the world to show how their smiles can be as white as mines. I love this product. I have to get it off Amazon too just to make things easier for myself when it comes to getting it.</li>
    <li> I gotta say that this item really has proved its worth, mind you, i am a daily smoker, not like a pack a day but i can do one or two and throught the years it has shown the effect of this bad habit, so i got this item and used it as it was indicated. please, use it as indicated... i used it and within a matter of weeks i started seeing the difference, of course, my teeth weren&#x27;t bad or really brown, but i knew i could do better without spending a fortune. My girlfriend has noticed a difference and i would encourage everyone to use it... again... as directed... this product will make a difference and little by little people will notice it... i guarantee it...</li>
    <li> I love drinking coffee and Coca-Cola, and as a result, I tend to drink one or both everyday. I know the adverse effects on my body but my teeth take the real beating. The pearly whites are turning faint yellow, so I decided to do something about it. In comes Shine Whitening. Before investing $30, I researched Rite Aid, CVS and Walgreens to find out which one was the best. Hands down, it’s Shine Whitening. In the first few weeks of using it, the yellow is fading. If you’re deciding on a brand, rest assured, you won’t be disappointed with Shine Whitening.</li>
    <li> wonderful.  As much coffee as I drink, my teeth are beautifully clean.  I am very excited and will continue to use this product and recommend this to others too. It is cheaper than going to  a dentist.</li>
    <li> These are a huge pain to use. The trays are GIANT, I could not fit them in my mouth at all. I also had a ton of trouble getting them to shape to my teeth. They took too long to become flexible, to the point where the clip you hold on to with tongs started melting on to the tongs. I&#x27;d put them in my mouth and get all of the air, etc. out as directed and they just wouldn&#x27;t shape to my teeth. I tried many times. The tray I tried to use for the bottom teeth was huge and didn&#x27;t even make contact with my teeth because it &amp;#34;sat&amp;#34; on top of my gums and a good centimeter or two away from my teeth. I even tried cutting some of the tray off at the ends so it didn&#x27;t jut forward and around the bottom so that it didn&#x27;t sit above my teeth, to no avail. They were still terrible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I posted a question on the Amazon question board and asked for advice on how to get these to fit to my mouth and be more comfortable. A customer replied and said they had the exact same problems I did and they also highly disliked the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I applied the whitening solution to my teeth with a q-tip as directed for a more precise application. I only did two applications and could already see the whitening was becoming very uneven.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just went to Target and picked up Crest Whitestrips - way, way easier to use (and more comfortable).</li>
    <li> Tastes minty. Easy to use. Quick results</li>
    <li> I have had a hard time trying to find an affordable kit that actually worked! I felt a little silly standing in front of the mirror putting the tray in and out of my mouth before even warming it up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once I got it heated, It went in with ease and created the perfect mold! I was so excited. I will be recommending this to all my friends who want to whiten their teeth.</li>
    <li> I used it twice and had whiter teeth, but the next time I started to fill the tray, I noticed the plunger of the syringe was loose and the ink on the measurements were smudged. I checked the other syringe, and it was the same way. It seemed to have come that way and I hadn&#x27;t noticed. Uncertain the product was safe, I threw them away. Too bad, because it seemed effective.</li>
    <li> My dentist was going to charge me over $2,000 for a whitening treatment (that would take two visits to complete AND a change in my diet to prevent the &#x27;goo&#x27; from coming off).  When I came across Shine Whitening, my prayers and pocketbook were relieved!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You see, as a diabetic and avid green tea drinker, I had no choice but to approach the dentist...over the counter treatments (like Crest 3D Whitestrips) did not do the job and I was at a loss.  But when the dentist told me the cost (and had the nerve to ask me to use my upcoming tax refund), I resorted to Amazon and found the solution.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is very easy to use (even my teenage daughter loves this) and for the price, will achieve results beyond what you are looking for, ESPECIALLY if your teeth are as stained as mine.  What I like best is how the mouth trays adjust to my bite pattern once they are heated up...simply add the gel and you can look forward to a new smile.  And in my profession (and current health where gum disease is common), you must keep your teeth as healthy as possible.</li>
    <li> I find myself smiling a lot more now. Two or three times a week I squirt a small amount of gel into the teeth tray and stick it in my mouth for ten, fifteen minutes. It&#x27;s that easy. There is a little bit of setup but that&#x27;s fine--my teeth have probably whitened at least two or three shades whiter. My confidence is building more and more each day.</li>
    <li> I was on Amazon just window shopping when I saw this ad I asked why not? (Money was burning in my pocket, lol) It was listed at a great price compared to other kits as well. Despite  never using this kind of whitening before it was easy to use. The instructions were clear (unlike some beauty products) and I only had to read them once to understand the system. I liked how it came with the mouth trays in the package as well, and how easy they fit. I used to play hockey, so I know the pain when one doesn&#x27;t. If you are going to buy any whitening kits I would purchase this one. You want to look better for a great price, not fit with a kit that is hard to use and doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
    <li> First off I want to state the fact that I love the double tray for many reasons, I&#x27;ve bought other whitening kits before and for the most part its one tray for both top and bottom teeth. I also have an over bite so the separate trays make it a lot easier to work around my teeth. I am an ex smoker so my teeth WERE pretty gross.... I&#x27;m sure some of you out there know just what I mean. I guess I&#x27;ll also mention the fact that I have....long teeth.. and it just fits my teeth really well.&lt;br /&gt;The solution it&#x27;s self is a bit sticky on your teeth once the trays are removed BUT the results are very worth it. I&#x27;ve used the strips in the past and never seemed to get too white after the 6th strip. ALSO i can pop it in right before i get in the shower and by the time I&#x27;m done, it&#x27;s done! Should i have done the research before purchasing the product else where instead of amazon, yeah... loss on my part... but i still have to voice my opinion on a great product. If you&#x27;ve tried the strips or any other whitening product and it didn&#x27;t get rid of those stains this one will!</li>
    <li> Buy this if you need whiter teeth.. It really worked for me and my brother.. I thought the film wouldn&#x27;t come off but after 3 treatments it did.</li>
    <li> I liked this whitening solution a lot, it seemed work pretty fast and the instructions were easy enough to follow. One thing Ã¢\\&quot; do NOT leave the trays in boiling water, just take them out when they become floppy. I read about that issue a few times and if you mold the trays correctly the fit your mouth perfectly. Good stuff</li>
    <li> You know, I have always been very skeptical about teeth whitening products, until I tried Shine Whitening. I mean, this time I actually saw RESULTS!!. For the price I paid, and the end result, not only am I smiling more because I can do that with confidence now, my wallet is also very happy. People, take it from a person who has tried this product, you will not find another similar product as effective as Shine Whitening. The instructions are simple, it fits all teeth, and very simple to use. I would recommend this to everyone.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok. Only whitened my teeth 2 shades. Wouldn&#x27;t buy again</li>
    <li> These are worth the price and are very gentle on my gums. I would recommend this product and will continue to use it:)</li>
    <li> This is the same stuff you would get from the dentist at such a lower price</li>
    <li> I am always concerned with having the whitest, shiniest teeth possible, and Shine Whitening is not only effective, it is very easy to use and a good bargain for the price. I didn&#x27;t experience any sensitivity or discomfort during the use.</li>
    <li> I am always getting compliments from my friends and coworkers on how nice my teeth are. I will use this product again.</li>
    <li> I would buy this product again.</li>
    <li> Just got this today and used it for the 15 minutes -- already a shade lighter!!&lt;br /&gt;My front teeth were never the problem -- it was the side teeth that were dull - this has brightened them right on up!! I cannot wait to see the effects of more than one treatment!! Worth $30!!</li>
    <li> Love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was very impressed with the results of Shine Whitening. I will definitely recommend it to everyone I know. This is nearly as good as getting your teeth laser whitened at the&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;dentist&#x27;s office. My advice is to start small: 1.Use a little bit of gel the first time. This is to not overwhelm and to see if you&#x27;re sensitive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. If you are sensitive stick with a small small amount, if not add more gel. Make sure to not go over 30 minutes per day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. Stick with the 10 days! While you will see some whitening after the first couple of uses you&#x27;ll need to stick to the 10 days in order to get the laser-effect-experience!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Rinse, use, and repeat!</li>
    <li> After two weeks using this product my teeth are two whole shades whiter. The taste Is pleasant. Ive tried many whitening products, I&#x27;m buying again the price is very reasonable and well worth it.</li>
    <li> The tray system feels pretty good in the mouth. You have to stick it under a faucet or in a bowl of hot water and then let it form in your mouth, so itÃ¢(tm)s almost like a soft plastic pillow for your teeth. Let it sit there for a while, and then itÃ¢(tm)s just done. You have a personal piece of oral hygiene. That way when you insert the gel into the piece and then put it back in your mouth for two to three times a week, you can just chomp down on it and play video games or something, instead of worrying if the strips will fall out of your teeth. The results are similar to other whitening products so this is a no duh moment.</li>
    <li> I was looking at crest white strips and in the reviews I came across this product. I decided to order it based on other reviews and I am glad I did. I saw a difference in the color of my teeth after the very first use. I am a smoker and a coffee drinker and I am really surprised at how quick this made a change. I have used several other products in the past and this one beats them all hands down.</li>
    <li> The trays just melted after I put them in the boiling water. Completely useless!!!!!</li>
    <li> This product is amazing-- I love it and I am so happy I found it! My teeth are noticeably whiter and it hasn&#x27;t even been a FULL month yet. I normally have 2 cups of coffee a day and being that I lagged in the flossing department, my teeth needed whitening help and this helped SOO MUCH! I was referred to this product by friends and was not sure if I could do it myself-- but it was very user friendly. After the first use I knew this was the right decision-- so easy and quick!</li>
    <li> Sure wish I found this earlier. After messing around with those ridiculous whitening strips and that paint on garbage, I decided to cut my losses and buy a system that works. Shine Whitening is the only way to go. My wife to be and I are getting married in one month and we wanted to whiten our teeth for the big day. Thanks for steering us in the right direction. Keep up the good work!</li>
    <li> Shine only takes 5 minutes a day. So quick and easy to use:)</li>
    <li> I cringe a lot of times with products such as these because there are always a load of instructions. This package came with minimal and easy instructions. I use this product three times and a day and I have seen dramatic changes with my teeth. There isn&#x27;t a need to use a lot either so you get more bang for your buck.  Since using this product I have no need to go to an expensive doctor for various treatments.</li>
    <li> I started to use Shine, weird because IÃ¢(tm)ve used other whitening products and IÃ¢(tm)ve found them to be malarkey. They make my teeth whiter but soon after use they return to the dark yellow.</li>
    <li> after using crest whitestrips for the past few years I got used to the mediocreness of them. SUCH A BIG difference between the shine whitening trays and the crest whitestrips. I&#x27;m glad I made the change. I just use these like the instructions say, every 3-4 days and they&#x27;re so pearly white, the actually almost shine - but not and unnatural look either.</li>
    <li> Ever get that craving for a coffee and a muffin. My god. Basically every single say I have one.. Or two. Thiss really helped me out keep my teeth white,.</li>
    <li> I was really impressed with how quickly my teeth started to look whiter only after a couple of uses. I love it.</li>
    <li> Sure it sucks to have a mouth tray now, something that takes time to mold and set up and then you have to keep it around, but itÃ¢(tm)s much easier to whiten your teeth. Other products are more expensive and are harder to use in my experience. My teeth are whiter by about two or three shades and IÃ¢(tm)m happy with it, and I think the set up with Shine is worth the payoff.</li>
    <li> Thank you for allowing me to drink coffee on a regular basis. I love the fact that my stains are gone.</li>
    <li> The mouth trays were easy enough to use, you put them in water to get them floppy then after they&#x27;re soft you stick them around your teeth so you can form them and make an exact mold. I really prefer the tray system over the strips system because it&#x27;s a lot more accurate. I highly suggest using the q-tip technique as that will prevent you from getting any of the solution on your gums. I had slight gum sensitivity so I used the q-tip trick and applied the solution directly to my teeth, and then put on the trays. I&#x27;ve had no problems so far.</li>
    <li> I used to hide from the camera because my teeth were SOOOOO bad. I tried this product for a week and my teeth loook 10 times better than before.</li>
    <li> this is the only product that took my coffee and wine stains away. SO IMPRESSED!</li>
    <li> These are worth the price and are very gentle on my gums. I would recommend this product and will continue to use it:)</li>
    <li> \\&quot;Compared to other whitening systems this is product is a bargain. I have spent upwards of hundreds of dollars to whiten my teeth and itÃ¢(tm)s always worth it, but if I can spend less than 50 bucks to do the same job, I would be silly NOT to take it.</li>
    <li> I personally enjoy the tray system. Whitening strips fell out of my mouth so I am looking forward to using this more often and avoiding that kind of experience.</li>
    <li> In college I didn’t treat my teeth very well. Stayed up way late so I relied on coffee on a daily basis for five years, and also I picked up a smoking habit. By the end of my tenure at school my teeth looked like an old man’s. Luckily I picked up Shine, which probably cut my stains in half in about a few months of use. Now my teeth look like the color they are supposed to be for my age. You can kind of tell I smoke and I wish it was a little whiter but really it seems like they did a miracle, you should have seen it before. Five out of five.</li>
    <li> This is honestly really great for the price. The mold fit my mouth perfectly and i now use it to add gel from any other product! it&#x27;s great, it&#x27;s my own personal molding. And the molding procedures were quick and easy!</li>
    <li> WOW! FASTEST shipping i&#x27;ve ever received! I LOVE these!!!!!!! They really DO work! The trays are very soft and comfortable, and the gel stays in place just like it should! I love the guide it comes with so you can track your results! That&#x27;s a huge plus for me! I do wish i could do one tooth as i have one that needs it more then the others, maybe if i play with it alittle i can figure that out! Im going to buy more so my husband can use them as well. I absolustely LOVE that they are dental grade as well so i know im really getting something legit!</li>
    <li> I like the system better too on the Shine Whitening  product, the trays work more easily than other ways. I would say this is about the same as using whitening strips, the results are similar but this is anywhere from five to 20 dollars cheaper.m.</li>
    <li> the mouth pieces do not mold well</li>
    <li> My dentist quoted me 380$ to bleach my teeth. Little did i know you can buy the same stuff on amazon for a fraction of the price. good deal.</li>
    <li> anyone can use shine whitening did not make my teeth sensitive at all.</li>
    <li> I bought this kit to prepare for a job interview coming up, I didn&#x27;t want my teeth looking like I drink 3 cups of coffee a day! I was really surprised by the speed at which it worked.. only 3 treatments in so far but I see my teeth are noticeably whiter. I have no issues with the trays either, some people say they&#x27;re too big for your mouth but I have a very small mouth and I am fine. I think you should try to heat them multiple times in boiling water until they fit, that&#x27;s the best technique. They have to be really floppy!</li>
    <li> I have tried many other teeth whitening products that didn&#x27;t work well at all. I was unsure if this one was going to work - most of them don&#x27;t whiten properly and make your teeth sensitive. I am happy to announce that Shine whitening works well for me.</li>
    <li> Im no longer afraid to actually smile for pictures anymore. Using this for a couple months and it&#x27;d helped me so much.</li>
    <li> I used this product a few weeks before my wedding day and my wedding pictures thank you for it.</li>
    <li> GOOD STUFF. I like it a lot and will update this review after I finish it. SO FAR SO GOOD!</li>
    <li> I bought 50 of these after buying one the first time, great product, almost made them out of stock on amazon. Lol.</li>
    <li> This really helped me whiten my teeth! It seems like a hassle at first, but I got used to it and now, I&#x27;m reaping the results!</li>
    <li> This is part of looking good every day. Whiter teeth leads to a better look. I use this about three times a week and I feel great about my teeth.</li>
    <li> Everybody&#x27;s teeth yellows over the years. That&#x27;s the horrible secret. Our teeth want to be yellow, because that is the natural color of the enamel. Anyway, we all need a little help in this particular area of our bodies, so I think this is a good way of doing that. This product really helps me feel like my teeth are fulfilling that potential and there have been no problems whatsoever. Recommended.</li>
    <li> Brushing your teeth alone won&#x27;t do anything for you; even the whitening toothpaste won&#x27;t help. The strips are OK but it takes too long to notice anything. BEST is this stuff. This gel compares to nothing - the best bar none. It gets into all the spaces between that the strips never get.</li>
    <li> It made my teeth really white. It won&#x27;t get your teeth to paper-white like the girls on the tv commercials, (I think that&#x27;s actually unaturally white) but it will whitening very well.</li>
    <li> Quick results with this one. I have sensitive teeth and sometimes have issues with feeling hurt over silly things like a cup of water with ice in it, even. But I have had no issues so far with this product. I would recommend it to people with sensitive teeth and even people without sensitive teeth. it worked in a timely fashion, very fast. I would recommend it to anyone trying to whiten their teeth.</li>
    <li> Great method for whitening your teeth. Easy to use system and in only a handful of treatments it works really well.</li>
    <li> Find myself more confident in my looks and I am showing off my smile a lot more these days. Use this a few times a week and it does a good job of making my teeth whiter, perhaps up to three or four shades lighter. Pretty good stuff here. Will keep using.</li>
    <li> I have yearbook photos next week and thanks to this product I am very much looking forward to it. My teeth are sparkling. Used it for about a month, maybe 8 or 9 times.</li>
    <li> I have spent a lot of money on teeth whitening products. Not proud of that. Seems like I should pay more attention to my coffee and smoking habits. But it is what it is. And so I have a little bit of authority when I say that I think the mouth tray system in Shine Whitening is pretty cool. ItÃ¢(tm)s a nice way to get the gel into your mouth and have it affix to your teeth, instead of just flopping around everywhere. The results are as good as other brands of things so the main difference is the trays. It helps out a lot to keep the gel in your mouth instead of eating it.</li>
    <li> My teeth are much better now. Thanks a ton.</li>
    <li> Looks expensive, but it&#x27;s not for what you get. Teeth are whiter with just one use. Great value.</li>
    <li> There’s a second gel for sensitive teeth and I think that’s neat because I’m one of those people who have sensitive teeth. I appreciate that and it works out because my teeth were unharmed using this product. I have a brighter smile and it was all painless.</li>
    <li> Always had issues with other products making my teeth and gums hurt bad! I leave these on for the full allotted time and have NO issues with pain or sensitivity. The product works wonders as I drink coffee and red wine which is tuff on whiteness. I would highly recommend this product. 5 Stars!</li>
    <li> The tray system kicks ass. It stays in the mouth and if I want to move around, I can. I feel like I don’t have to worry about accidentally licking my teeth and moving strips around or anything like that. Just stick it in and forget it for about fifteen minutes. My teeth have seen good results after just a few sessions. After a few weeks it looked even better. I’ve been receiving compliments from family and friends and I feel more confident than ever. Shine Whitening is a good product and a better value for what it does.</li>
    <li> in the past I have used crest whitestrips and I felt that they make my teeth a little sensitive, they start hurting after a while of having the strips on. Got some advice from a friend of mine to try the gel type like shine whitening and its great. So much better than the strips. othe gel doesn&#x27;t hurt my teeth whatsoever, you would imagine it would since it&#x27;s much stronger than the strips alone.</li>
    <li> Very good product. Saw significant difference in days. Easy to use if you read everything first.</li>
    <li> This is easy to use. The tray system is great and simple. It makes a lot more sense and causes less garbage than other strips or whatnot. Recommended.</li>
    <li> Everybody is enjoying my sparkling smile because of Shine Whitening. So it’s like a public service. Use this product and improve the look of your city or town.</li>
    <li> I have been self councious my whole life over my teeth due to what Celiac disease did to them. I have been afraid I would never be able to have normal looking teeth again, but this product proved me wrong! My teeth are now bright and shiny and I have new self confidence.</li>
    <li> Great price for what you get</li>
    <li> I got pretty good results after one use.</li>
    <li> II will continue to use.</li>
    <li> Had stains for years. Used other products and they worked out similar to Shine but Shine has a better system and is cheaper by a little bit. The gel is cool feeling and has a mint taste, and the mouth system is easier to use than anything so far. Recommended.</li>
    <li> This kit came quick. I liked the minty taste.</li>
    <li> This didn&#x27;t lighten my boyfriend&#x27;s teeth at all! On a scale of 1-10 his teeth are probably a 5 (10 being the worst stained teeth you&#x27;ve ever seen) and they are more in the dingy/grey side (as opposed to yellow). I&#x27;m surprised this has such high reviews. Probably no different than Plus Whute which is way cheaper.</li>
    <li> Strips are a hassle and the trays stay in my mouth. It’s very easy to just stick it in and use for fifteen minutes and then take it out. So simple to use. Enjoy using this product.</li>
    <li> My teeth are a big part of why I think people respond to me. I mean I think it’s a big part of communication for everyone, but I really think of my teeth as one of my primary features. Which is why it was disconcerting when they started to yellow. I used this product, just a few times and it worked out and my teeth are back to normal again. I will just have to keep using this product every once a while.</li>
    <li> I have tried some similar products in the past, but this is my favorite by far.  A lot of the alternatives I&#x27;ve tried (especially Crest White Strips), have been difficult to use/uncomfortable in my mouth.  I was pleasantly surprised to find how easy these were, and how comfortably they fit in once heated.  They were also relatively easy to use.  I felt that the directions were very clear and concise, and it was easy to figure out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to drink a TON of coffee thanks to my early morning hours at work, and I smoke cigarettes on top of that.. But I was able to notice a difference almost right away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have noticed that a lot of these products can get very pricey.. But these were very reasonable and totally worth the price.  It&#x27;s rare to find something like this at a reasonable price that actually gets the job done, but I was totally satisfited with this product.  Would buy again!</li>
    <li> Teeth will become discolored as we all grow older, but if you use a whitener then your teeth will be white for as long as you use it. I have good results from Shine!</li>
    <li> I am a smoker and coffee drinker and for years have tried different things to keep my teeth looking white. I tried this product after using white strips in the past, and I found it to be much easier to use. Since the tray actually formed to the shape of my mouth, I found that more of the tooth area was covered, and it was a much more comfortable experience overall. The price is also great and I am very pleased with the results I got. I would recommend this product to anyone.</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t quite sure about this product before I tried it, but it really does work! I really love how fast it whitened my teeth, which was less than 24 hours! The end result looked exactly like going to the dentist for a cleaning, but so much cheaper!  It was also easy to use, and it even worked over braces! I recommend this product to anyone who doesn&#x27;t want to go to the dentist!</li>
    <li> After applying all of it my teeth may have only changed by a shade, maybe two. I&#x27;m going to have to find an alternative now. Maybe I lost too much enamel by drinking sodas when I was a teen. Who knows.</li>
    <li> Worthless.  I&#x27;ve used this multiple times for 30 minutes to an hour on a daily basis for a month with NO RESULTS.  Try another brand instead.</li>
    <li> I have search and search for a good teeth whitening product for the longest time and a product that was easy to use due to my horrible yellow teeth&#x27;s and I finally came across this wonderful product that Work and not only did it work it was affordable. It has made my teeth&#x27;s 10× whiter in the matter of weeks omg! With my new smile I&#x27;m now more confident and comfortable when I  smile I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> If you are sensitive dial it back. Personally I had no problems so I did it for a while every other day. The results were great for me but eventually I kind of also dialed it back because the returns were diminishing. I still keep it up but maybe only twice or once a week. I still credit Shine for making my teeth white though.</li>
    <li> This is probably the best whitening product out there and I have tried many. I don&#x27;t have the cash to get it done professionally so the price was right. I love my red wine and I do smoke so that doesn&#x27;t always make for the prettiest teeth. I have always been self conscious of my smile.  In fact, people always say &amp;#34;Why so down honey?&amp;#34; and really I am a happy lady except for the teeth issue.&lt;br /&gt;I use this once a day for about 5 to 10 minutes. At first I experienced a tingling but that subsided within a day.  I have been using it for the past 30 days and have noticed a wonderful difference.  In fact I have started smiling again. People at work must wonder what I am up to.  I will pretend I have a secret when really I am so happy that I finally found a product that lives up to the hype.  A must get if you are not happy with the color of your teeth.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m pretty impressed with the Shine Whitening product. After using this teeth whitener my teeth did whiten after just a few uses. I do smoke on occasion so I&#x27;m sure that if I saw improvement as a smoker then I can only assume a nonsmoker would see much better results. I did begin with shorter time for treatment since I have experienced sensitivity with other whitening kits, but I did not experience any over sensitivity when I started, which I was really happy about.  I also was not uncomfortable with the mouth tray as I thought I&#x27;d be. It fit comfortably for my mouth. For such an inexpensive whitener kit I was a skeptic but it did provide beautiful results. You can&#x27;t go wrong with the price either because it does what a dentist could do for a much lower cost. I am pretty happy with my investment and I recommend it for others as well.</li>
    <li> This is not a cheap product. It is a professional whitening formula. All tooth stains are removed, and your teeth are virtually transformed into pearly whites!</li>
    <li> TERRIBLE PRODUCT AND RIP OFF!!! Trays melt when u boil them and soon as u put them in your mouth they curl up and do not fit like they&#x27;re supposed to.  I still tried them out but within two minutes since not having a correct fit I was drooling everything out of the trays which turned out to be one big waste of my damn time.  REFUND PLEASE!?  AVOID THIS!!!!</li>
    <li> People at work are talking about my teeth and asking about what I have been doing to them. That&#x27;s really cool because I have no seen that sort of attention before about my looks. I think that for a lot of people bad teeth are a dealbreaker and I would say that this is a very important part--people are starting to notice parts of me that aren&#x27;t related to my mouth as well. Will keep using this product until I stop being the envy of my work.</li>
    <li> Secretly bought these for my husband. His teeth are horrible and he doesn&#x27;t do anything about it. Im going to tell him itÃ¢(tm)s a thing that builds his enamel. Lol.</li>
    <li> You should also use the q-tip technique recommended in the instructions, it will help you keep the product off your gums. If you follow the instructions and use it once every few days, you&#x27;ll notice whiter teeth pretty immediately and without sensitity.</li>
    <li> I hardly drink coffee, but I do smoke. The yellow gets really noticable after a while. I have used trays before from some other brand, they didn&#x27;t work for me too well I got the goop all over and everywhere.. These ones are pretty good, no mess and easy to use no argument on whether or not it works. It works real good brings everyhing back to BETTER than normal.</li>
    <li> My smile was always good, I always thought it could be a little whiter, thatÃ¢(tm)s all. I had expensive bleaching treatments in the past but right now IÃ¢(tm)m not in the position financially where I can afford it again. I found Shine and looked at the reviews online here. Decent. So I decided to give it a shot and IÃ¢(tm)m happy to report that it does just as advertised and at a good price point for everyone. ItÃ¢(tm)s a bargain as far as IÃ¢(tm)m concerned. After a few weeks saw good results and after a month or so I was almost back to the bleached state. Amazing.</li>
    <li> Whitening strips are the worst. They consistenly fall off my teeth and give me an uneven whitening on my teeth. This system is much better.</li>
    <li> Using this as a part of my routine now. I like having whiter teeth and if using this twice a week will do it, that is not a lot to ask. The tray system is great and I feel like I have more confidence in my dealings with friends as well as strangers because of this product. Whiter teeth are better.</li>
    <li> For the whitening solution here, the tray system is great. I enjoy using it and seeing that my teeth are getting whiter. Strips get my teeth white too, but often fall out of my mouth and get the whitening solution all overy my lips. It&#x27;s actually painful. This product is great for whitening teeth the easy way.</li>
    <li> I am a bargain hunter and I found a catch here. I bought some of this and it works very well. Also it&#x27;s much cheaper than other products of the same caliber.</li>
    <li> After years of smoking I didn&#x27;t think my teeth could come back from it. But I guess it does work, because after about a couple weeks of using this product my teeth look not half bad! I would recommend anyone looking to whiten up their smile to give this a shot.</li>
    <li> Trays give this system an even distribution to my teeth, which makes them evenly white. Enjoy seeing it and how easy it is to do. Pop it in and a few minutes later it&#x27;s done. I do it about three times a week.</li>
    <li> I find myself smiling a lot more after using this product. I have more confidence in my looks and my teeth are whiter than before, which makes it easier. I put in the mouth tray a couple times a week and that works out for me. Recommended.</li>
    <li> Enamel is naturally yellowing, that&#x27;s what people don&#x27;t realize. The natural color of the material is yellow, so by default we should all have yellow teeth eventually. Too bad that&#x27;s not the case, so to run with everyone else go ahead and use this product. The tray system is simple to use and I found it easy to use. Just a handful of treatments had me with whiter teeth.</li>
    <li> Usually I dread picture day. But not this time. This time I was armed with teeth whitening and this product really helped me out. You can really see the difference and maybe I will upload pics to see. The difference is staggering from year to year. I recommend this to anyone who wants to look better, whiter teeth really brightens up your face and makes you look healthier.</li>
    <li> I can tell that whiter teeth make the entire package better. I have photos where my teeth are in top form and I have photos where my teeth are less than great. Well right now I was in the \\&quot;not great\\&quot; phase through some neglect and you can really tell the difference, even if everything else is the same. I used this product for a few weeks and my teeth are back to normal, they look great. I would recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> Amazingly this product worked fast. I was expecting a drawn out process of months of waiting, but that is not the case. I just made the mouth piece fit into my mouth by running hot water over it and biting down for several minutes, and then letting it cool down. Then you squirt a bit of the gel on there and bite down since it fits to your mouth. A few minutes later rinse your mouth and go about your day. Your teeth will look great.</li>
    <li> I have had a smoking habit for half a decade now and my teeth do not look good. Well, that is, until I found this product and used it. I was surprised to see that it worked really well, even on teeth that had been stained. My teeth are whiter now and I am thankful.</li>
    <li> I am smiling a lot more at people and I really feel like it has impacted my life positively. My teeth are whiter and it&#x27;s great that this product is available.</li>
    <li> Strips are annoying nuisance. They constantly fall out of my mouth and give me problems. I find myself readjusting them a lot and then the solution just keeps hitting my tongue and dissolving into my mouth. It&#x27;s very annoying but since this has mouth trays you do not encounter that sort of problem here.</li>
    <li> People at work are noticing my smile and some people actually came through the break room to ask about what i was doing to my mouth. Well I let them know and I was very excited to find out that what I was doing was noticeable. I told them it was this product and I wanted to come on here to let you guys know about the good review as well. Happy.</li>
    <li> I put the mouth tray in boiling water as instructed but when I took it out after 5 seconds, it came out deformed and dysfunctional. The other one had the same result too. I tried to contact the seller but I can&#x27;t find any options anywhere so I&#x27;m writing this review in the hope that they would send me two new mouth trays.</li>
    <li> My teeth look awesome. I feel great about my smile and after using this product for a few weeks it&#x27;s like my teeth were never yellow before. I do it about every few days and it&#x27;s a pretty easy upkeep to do. No complaints, it&#x27;s simple and the tray system does a good job of staying in my mouth.</li>
    <li> Enamel is yellow by nature. That&#x27;s what a nerd would say. But if you want to whiten your teeth you will look better. Guaranteed. Use this.</li>
    <li> I found this kit in my cabinet the other day and finally used it.&lt;br /&gt;Unbelievable difference, I can&#x27;t understand how I was walking around with such discolored teeth before!&lt;br /&gt;Extremely easy to use and doesn&#x27;t take too long at all.&lt;br /&gt;And the price is right! I had my teeth whitened at the dentist&#x27;s office one time and i honesty don&#x27;t know why they charge so much for something you can easily do at home in half the time for a fraction of the price.&lt;br /&gt;I had tried another DYI brand and the taste was so gross I gave up on it.&lt;br /&gt;This brand tastes more like toothpaste, not unpleasant at all.&lt;br /&gt;The heated mouth trays in this package fit very snugly with no sloppy overflow.&lt;br /&gt;Also, I have a fairly tiny jaw and these fit me perfectly.&lt;br /&gt;Altogether, this is a great product I would recommend to anyone.&lt;br /&gt;Good luck.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a professional whitening kit that was affordable. I&#x27;ve had bad experiences with inexpensive whitening kits so I decided to spend a bit more, and Shine Whitening really did a nice job. When I first received the trays, it took a little bit of time to get used to setting them up in my mouth. Everyones mouth is clearly different, and when I warmed the trays they molded very nicely to my mouth. The 15-30 minute period with the trays in your mouth is not uncomfortable at all. Remember, its important to keep the trays in the full amount of time if you want to get the desired results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;ve had a very pleasant experience with Shine and have recommended it to friends.</li>
    <li> The bare-bones package contains two plastic bite trays and two syringes of whitener. There are no detailed instructions inside, only a few steps on the back. The packaging says \\&quot;Please visit shinewhitening.com for an easy-to-follow instructional video on how to use the mouth trays\\&quot;. I went to the website and...no video. Fortunately I found a series of videos by a dentist named Joel Terry Alford (search his full name on youtube) that did an excellent job of explaining how to correctly form the trays and how to correctly apply the whitener. On my first time using the trays I used a bit too much on top and my gums turned white in one spot. Gum oxidation is common when whitening teeth and the white spots go away after about 15 minutes or so. I removed the tray, wiped my gum clean, and wiped the tray in that spot and continued whitening with no further issues. After whitening I rinsed well with cold water and \\&quot;buffed\\&quot; my teeth with a towel. The product works best if you have a good set of trays. I recommend when you make them to scratch a \\&quot;T\\&quot; on the side of one so you can easily tell which is for the top and bottom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: I have reduced my rating for this product. I did the full 10 day treatment with the gel and my final conclusion is that it is just OK. It did not whiten as much as I expected, although the gel was certainly strong as it oxidized/burned my gums where it leaked out of the trays. After I finished with this product I started using whitening strips once per day for another 10 days or so and, to top it off, I brushed with Crest 3D whitening toothpaste every other day. The final result was noticeable whitening from the combination of products, BUT if I had to do it over I would NOT buy this product again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And yes there are many fake reviews for this product. I have taken an extra star off my rating to reflect that the makers of this product engage in deceptive practices.</li>
    <li> Great value!  I got pkg 2 day, max 3 after ordering.  Very happy with value.  I didn&#x27;t want to pay $500 for dentist version, plus $80/year after.  I used for 10 days as directed, and dentist used \\&quot;tint\\&quot; measuring electronic tool, and said I moved 4 shades lighter, about what their process would have done.  That for less $35 per year (sufficient for 2 application cycles of 10 days each).  Very happy with product.  PS  I understand they use the same chemical and strength of chemical as dentists.  The difference is the dentist fits the mouthguard to your teeth.  This at home version, you spend about 20 min. or less the first time heating guard and pressing it to your teeth shape.</li>
    <li> I had never tried whitening my teeth before but I decided to try these over the strips because I had believed you could better get the solution to coat your teeth completely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Upon arrival, the package seemed a little flimsy. I followed the instructions and watched the video on how to use the trays. I found the trays a bit large for my mouth but tried anyway. After repeated attempts, I could never get them to mold over my teeth well. After the first time, I dipped the trays into boiled water faster than recommended in the video but that still didn&#x27;t seem to help. In the end, I gave up on using the trays, and simply put the solution into folded pieces of saran wrap and put that over my teeth!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It worked though, so the 3 stars is for the effective whitening. It was a noticeable 2-3 shades brighter. But I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;d buy this product again because the trays were useless to me.</li>
    <li> This product allows you to make the molds at work or while watching TV. With easy-to-follow instructions and a tray that fits perfectly, I found the entire process rather simple.&lt;br /&gt;Most teeth-whitening systems are gorssly expensive, but these seemed to be a fair price and did what I hoped it would. I would recommend these if you&#x27;re going to take the teeth-whitening plunge.</li>
    <li> It’s been about 7 days now, and I’ve seen a 3-shade difference in my teeth. This has come as a pleasant surprise as I was skeptical about this product’s effectiveness. I am going to give this product 4 stars not 5, because of the following reasons.&lt;br /&gt;- The product’s mouth-trays, while they fit my mouth perfectly, require some setup time. The strips are easier to put on, but these worked well as they fit my mouth after heating them up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- The gel itself had very little taste to it, a slight taste of mint that was not bad. I’ve read a lot of the reviews, most saying it was fine, but some saying their gums burned, so I’ve opted to use as little as possible and try to put it only on the sections of the trays that are exposed to my teeth. It took a little time to do this, but I’m pleased to report that my gums have not had any pain after 7 treatments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- The best thing about this product is that the results are noticeable after the first treatment, and I’ve continually getting good results from it. That said, after my 7th treatment I can’t really tell if it’s getting whiter, so I’ve stopped using it. If my teeth start to get yellow again, I’ll use this product to pick it back up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In summation, the product works, it’s a little cumbersome to setup, but I’m happy with it overall.</li>
    <li> This product burned my gums (actually left red, painful sores) and I saw no improvement after a week of use. I was really looking forward to using this product because of the stellar reviews, but I cannot recommend this.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m all smiles now. Teeth looking great and I am being more positive. More smiles means better interactions.</li>
    <li> The whitening solution works very fast actually. Faster than I would have expected. Much better and simple to use as well. Will be using this product in the future. People at work are asking me about it so I have been referring them here. Will leave a review to tell the internet as well.</li>
    <li> So the treatments worked REALLY well. I saw a big change after the third treatment but I had a little sensitivity after each oneÃ¢Â¦ my teeth are normally sensitive and I find even the whitestrips make my teeth sensitive. 5 Stars for the excellent work it did making my teeth white though.</li>
    <li> I have tried many other teeth whitening products that didn&#x27;t work well at all. I was unsure if this one was going to work - most of them don&#x27;t whiten properly and make your teeth sensitive. I am happy to announce that Shine whitening works well for me.</li>
    <li> I received my product as scheduled..awesome.</li>
    <li> I have sensitive teeth. I am worried they would hurt. I can barely eat cold things. But I didn&#x27;t have any issues with this product. Very happy with results and I didn&#x27;t know I would be able to use any whitening. But that&#x27;s not true.</li>
    <li> every whitening product makes yor teeth a little sensitive after using it. Shine Whitening was not bad at all. It made my teeth a little sensitive but the results were amazing and worth it.</li>
    <li> I decided to try shine whitening and it&#x27;s like I got them done professionally. I am very impressed.</li>
    <li> This product is ok for ppl with sesnsitive teeth. I just followed the prooper instructions and my teeth turned out great.</li>
    <li> I think the effort is worth it. No more fussing about with sticky strips or whatever, just pour it on, stick it in and you got it. My teeth are whiter now than before. Make me feel comfortable</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always been worried about the condition of my teeth as I am regularly complemented on my smile and consider it one of my greatest features, I&#x27;ve used many other teeth whitening solutions with very little results however I have used Shine Whitening a few times now and have had some brilliant noticeable results! After a few treatments, my teeth were noticeable whiter than before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The instructions are very straight forward and easy to follow and I had my first treatment applied within minutes!  - A recommended purchase, Thanks!</li>
    <li> ★ Shine Whitening ★ Professional Teeth Whitening Kit ★ (2) 5cc Syringes and Mouth Trays (top and bottom) These are just perfect as when you place the trays in hot water then you cool them just a bit, but do keep in mind you have to have the molds as warm as you can stand so you can make an imprint of your teeth.&lt;br /&gt;Once you have your molds made you will then want to brush and clean your teeth before applying the get to the tray and you will only want to use a pea drop as it will smash on to your teeth if you place the drop toward the front of the tray. Once you have the tray filled I personally like to dry my teeth before placing the tray in my mouth. this makes the gel adhere better and that makes it more effective. Now you can apply the gel with a Q-Tip , but if you follow the standard direction you will be fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used many different whitening products and this is just one of the few that I have found to actually work, I was a smoker for many years and I am always trying to whiten my teeth to remove those years of smoking stain off. I have to say I am one my way with products like this that actually work. I have bought those drug store strip and other product that just did not have the same quality of gel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product at a savings price or it is supplied to me for the purposes of a product review. All opinions are 100% my own and they reflect my honest &amp; unbiased opinion.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t whiten as well as promised. My teeth had slight yellowing in some spots and I saw little to no improvement after several treatments. A waste of money and time. Will not purchase again.</li>
    <li> This whitening kit has turned my less-than-stellar-smile into a smile I want to show off. It did a great job of removing stains from my teeth. My teeth discolor pretty easily since I am a coffee, tea, and dark wine drinker, so I decided to try this kit out to see if it was more effective than things I&#x27;ve tried in the past. This passed the test.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The kit arrived as described and I tried it out that night while cleaning up for the holiday get-together I was throwing the next day. By the time I was done cleaning up, my teeth stains were GONE! Totally impressed and will buy again.</li>
    <li> Five Stars all the way!.  Very, very happy with this product.  As soon as I opened the box I knew I was looking at a well designed and executed system.  Professional grade.  The packaging was first-rate and conveyed detailed commitment to their product and their promises.  From the Dental-grade mouth trays, to the easy-to-use syringes, and step-by-step directions - this is the real deal in a teeth whitening system.  And system is the operative word.  This is not a gimmick, or a quick-fix tape-on strip.  This is an well-engineered teeth whitening system that has multiple stages where the results are cumulative and progressive and the end result is fantastic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The trays are easy to use and conform to your teeth.  You shape the trays and you&#x27;re off and running.  The whitening solution surrounds your teeth completely, front side, back side, underneath, between teeth, giving you full coverage.  You can keep busy doing housework, reading, watching TV, whatever, so there&#x27;s really no time commitment that gets in the way of your day.  As I said before, this isn&#x27;t a quick fix, and results are cumulative and progressive with each application, which are spaced out over days, increasing the whitening affect.  I couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
    <li> I was never a big coffee or tea drinker and I don&#x27;t smoke cigarettes, but I have noticed quite a bit of yellowing over the years. I looked into getting whitening treatments through my dentist, but they were a bit more expensive than anticipated, and unfortunately not covered by my insurance. After poking around the internet for a bit I came across this product and decided to give a try after all of the positive reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All I have to say is, my smile looks 10 years younger! I&#x27;m a pretty happy individual, constantly smiling and regularly complimented on my smile, but since I started the Shine Whitening regiment people won&#x27;t shut up about it! Definitely not complaining, by the way..If you are looking for a low cost solution to aged and stained teeth, look no further. Shine is a small fraction of what I would have paid at the dentist, and I dare say, it&#x27;s been just as much, if not more effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two enthusiastic thumbs up! Oh wait..5 stars!!</li>
    <li> The product is priced at ten dollars more than two weeks ago.  I would still pay it.  I have the most sensitive teeth of my friends and was able to over do it enough to get back to the replacement color veneer from 15 years ago in three days.  Over did it like crazy and the sensitivity was minimal.</li>
    <li> I swear I have to leave a review because this product is really fantastic. It really shines my teeth and now I can smile at will.</li>
    <li> Still not sure about how I feel about this product.. The trays weren&#x27;t hard to form at all..but I used my little secret technique to get the gel to stay on my teeth so its more effective.. Yes it will irritate your gums if the gel comes in contact with it so just be careful with how you apply it. I did notice a difference..my teeth were initially an ecru color but now they&#x27;re kind if like an eggshell color.. Still not perfect yet though. I have to do another session today to see if there will be more improvements.. So it does work,but in my case not as I&#x27;d hope it would</li>
    <li> This teeth whitening is very easy to use, hassle free. It makes it easier to apply the gel and get your teeth white as possible. Try  it and you will really like it.</li>
    <li> Got many compliments on my teeth at my office after I used this Shine whitening for 1 week now. Everyday I always smiling to my office mate after they really notice my white teeth.</li>
    <li> A few years ago I received professional whitening and the teeth pain was a lot for me. The cost is very expensive, that&#x27;s why try to find an effective teeth whitening but cheap. And finally have find it now thru this product Shine whitening, it very effective because it whitens my teeth but very cheap than got o the dentist.</li>
    <li> I am very happy with results. Friends and family and coworkers have all been asking about it. I have recommended the product and it really help whiten there teeth also.</li>
    <li> This is a pretty good bargain for me as what it does. The ingredients are similar to higher priced products but still cheap and the effective is the same quality as those expensive product. Nice buy for me:)</li>
    <li> I hate whitening products because they just hurt my teeth and don&#x27;t whiten within a reasonable time frame. But this one is different, it&#x27;s easy to use, gentle to sensitive teeth and very effective.</li>
    <li> I feel great! people have noticed my pearly white teeth and I love it.</li>
    <li> Easy to use and effective</li>
    <li> I read the reviews in Amazon so I tried it and it really works. Nice buy for me.</li>
    <li> The molding didn&#x27;t mold good and the whitening wasn&#x27;t effective.</li>
    <li> I had braces for about 2.5 years and when I got them removed the stains weren&#x27;t too bad but there were some and it bothered me so I looked into getting my teeth whitened. The treatments I came across were a pretty penny so I opted to find a cheaper solution. I decided to try it myself, and looked for the best option.&lt;br /&gt;Based on the reviews and a couple articles I&#x27;ve read I decided to try this out. The worst that could happen that it doesn&#x27;t work. I was a bit skeptical, however, I was pleasantly surprised with my results. Could barely tell I had braces. I&#x27;m not done yet but the improvement is great.</li>
    <li> Fast delivery.  The Mouth trays not easy to handle, one already broke.</li>
    <li> I really liked the Shine Whitening system- the trays were easy to heat up and fit in well in my mouth. It definitely takes some patience, but it was totally worth it for a brighter smile!!</li>
    <li> I used to not look forward to picture day, but at least now I know my teeth will be white. My mom got me this product and my teeth have been sparkling since. I still need better wardrobe but my smile looks a lot better, even compared to my previous photos from years before. Found it easy to use.</li>
    <li> I am in a wedding party and looking forward to it. My teeth are looking even better than I could have imagined. Thanks for not steering me wrong, fellow reviewers.</li>
    <li> in the past I have used crest whitestrips and I felt that they make my teeth a little sensitive, they start hurting after a while of having the strips on. Got some advice from a friend of mine to try the gel type like shine whitening and its great. So much better than the strips. othe gel doesn&#x27;t hurt my teeth whatsoever, you would imagine it would since it&#x27;s much stronger than the strips alone.</li>
    <li> They are maybe two shades lighter now after a month of treatments and I enjoy using the product. The gel has a little bit of mint taste and there is a second gel to help build enamel and keep the teeth strong after use. It really works.</li>
    <li> impressed with how well this product stuck to my teeth. Easy to use on the way to work</li>
    <li> I like this Shine Whitening product because it seems complicated at first but is actually simpler than ever. and for months of using it,my teeth have become a lot whiter too.</li>
    <li> You only need to put a little bit on in the mouth tray. The gel is nice and cool and mint tasting a little bit, very pleasant. I like this product for what it does and the price is low.</li>
    <li> I bought 50 of these after buying one the first time, great product, almost made them out of stock on amazon. Lol.</li>
    <li> I was looking at crest white strips and in the reviews I came across this product. Decided to order it based on other reviews and I am glad I did. I saw a difference in the color of my teeth after the very first use. I am a smoker and a coffee drinker and I am really surprised at how quick this made a change. I have used several other products in the past and this one beats them all hands down. I would not have expectations of a professional dental bleaching making a change this dramatic this quickly. Highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I tried some other whiteners a couple years ago but they hurt my gums a lot. Saw this ne one come out, and read some good reviews about it not stinging or hurting gums, gave it a try and it&#x27;s great! For me it&#x27;s still a little intense, but good!</li>
    <li> Good for a bargain here. Teeth whitening products are often very expensive, sometimes prohibitively so. This is not the case here. Jump on it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had trouble getting rid of the coffee stains left on my teeth. Even my dentist now has trouble with all their tools they use on me. It gets a little expensive to keep going back every couple months. Damn addictive coffee. Bought this a while ago and they seem to work for me really well. I use the treatments every couple weeks and it&#x27;s kept the stains to a VERY small minimum.</li>
    <li> ok so Ive heard great things about shine whitening, never heard of them before a couple months ago. Giving it a try now. So far so good. 5 stars.</li>
    <li> I am a coffee and wine drinker so I&#x27;ve decided to try this whitening product and I&#x27;ll next use crest whitestrips again. Overall, high quality product and will continue to use on a regular basis to help with my coffee addiction.</li>
    <li> Im no longer afraid to actually smile for pictures anymore. Using this for a couple months and it&#x27;d helped me so much.</li>
    <li> Great seeing this at a low price. Other whitening products are too expensive to use. Will keep using it.</li>
    <li> For someone who drinks coffee and wine on a regular basis product really made a difference. I noticed a pretty siginificant different using the first treatment, and with the second, all those pesky stains were almost entirely gone. Overall, it&#x27;s worked much better than all the others I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
    <li> Shine only takes 5 minutes a day. So quick and easy to use:)</li>
    <li> This is a good price for this type of product. Go to any brick and mortarÃ¢Â¦ or hell, even try online. Just know that I&#x27;ve done the research and for this quality of product it&#x27;s difficult to find equivalent value.</li>
    <li> Receiving lots of compliments about my teeth at work today. I started using this whitening product a couple weeks ago and I guess the results are finally noticeable.</li>
    <li> Bought it for myself, now everyone in the family is using it. Great for everyone.</li>
    <li> Tray system is better than other systems out there. It conforms to your own mouth so it&#x27;s like having a personalized system in it. You do have to do a little work up top but other than that, you do need to run it under some hot water and then bite down to make a mark. Then you fill the tray with a little bit of gel, which does a decent job of whitening your teeth. Works very fast and ask anyone and i would recommend it.</li>
    <li> I am always getting compliments from my friends and coworkers on how nice my teeth are. I will use this product again.</li>
    <li> Im now feeling confident to smile because of my teeth now is stain free and really white. Im not feeling shy anymore to smile</li>
    <li> product seems to work just as good as what you would get at the dentist office.</li>
    <li> I used to rely on the teeth whitening kits that I can get from the box stores in my area. They work but the effects don&#x27;t last as long as I want them to. I had no expectations when I received this kit and was pleasantly surprised at how easy it is to use. In addition, it worked - and very well! My white smile gives me an extra boost of confidence and it only costs a fraction of the price compared to getting a similar procedure done at your dentist&#x27;s office. Two thumbs up for this product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received one or more of the products mentioned above for review purposes. Regardless, I only recommend products or services I use personally and believe will be good for others. I refuse to review or endorse products that I have not or will not personally try. Needless to say, I may be a product reviewer but my thoughts are real and none of the things I say on my reviews are made up or fake - they are all based on my experience/s with whatever product I am reviewing. I’m just a regular consumer and I appreciate reading and giving honest feedback about products that regular people like me use on a daily basis or consider buying. My views and opinions are from a customer/end user’s standpoint.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t plan on using this for more than the 10 days suggested.  It has very stron perozide.  I noticed my teeth were whiter within about 3 uses.  There is enough peroxide solution to do about 5 10 day treatments.  I drink coffee and tea so I have than type of staining and it works.  I do not use tobacco products so not sure how it works with that.</li>
    <li> This product is so much better and cheaper. Recommended product.</li>
    <li> After using this product for two weeks now I am seeing great results. Nice job Shine Whitening</li>
    <li> This product is easy to use. I can just put it in my mouth for fifteen minutes a few times a week and watch something on tv. Very affordable and very effective.</li>
    <li> been a smoker for years and as most ppl know my teeth are yellow and gross. Shine Whitening has been the only kit to make a difference in my smile within a reasonable amount of time. My teeth look at least 4 shades brighter and been using for 1 month.</li>
    <li> RESULTS: spectacular. Teeth whitened at least 3 shades after one 15 minute use. Wish I&#x27;d taken before/after photos.&lt;br /&gt;MAJOR SIDE EFFECTS: none.&lt;br /&gt;Minor side effects: the gel bubbles up around your gum line, which feels a little weird and can leave parts of the gum line white. My gums felt a little tender for about 2 hours, then normal. I didn&#x27;t have any sensitivity or pain in my teeth, which was a nice surprise. It just felt a little like Scrubbing Bubbles for teeth, which is kinda cool. Plus it works FAST, which is even more cool. When the gel runs out, I will buy this product again.</li>
    <li> Cheap teeth whitening that works!  I was skeptical, but the reviews were good and it&#x27;s true!  Works great!</li>
    <li> Alright so my teeth were pretty gross.  I drink a lot of coffee so... yeah nuff said.  I have tried a few of the other whiteners and they are meh.  This one was super easy (after heating the tray, you gotta heat the tray folks), reasonably priced, and worked like a team of tiny painters cleaning my teeth while I watched star trek.  It&#x27;s a buy folks.</li>
    <li> This stuff works wonders! I decided to try it because the dentist wanted an arm and a leg compared to this.&lt;br /&gt;The instructions are straightforward. Just make sure you use water that is ACTUALLY boiling, otherwise it wont form around your teeth properly. It is just like a mouthguard for sports. Bite down and use your fingers to make sure it&#x27;s sitting properly. If you get it wrong, you can always heat it up again.&lt;br /&gt;After that you just sit back and think about how good you will look for that date, interview, etc.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried a fair number of teeth whitening products. Have to, I simply love to sip black coffee and red wine.  A friend had used Shine Whitening and I noticed her previously yellow teeth had grown pearly white pretty darn quick.  So I gave it a whirl. Yes, I&#x27;m now a grateful customer -- my teeth are now much more bright and white.  My bank account is happy (seriously good value for this product, folks).  Funnily enough, I&#x27;m probably almost as grateful for how easy this product is to use.  Simply heating the trays made it fit quite nicely inside my mouth. These kind of products are worth it, I think, if they work well.  I&#x27;m job hunting at the moment. Having whiter teeth makes me look younger and healthier, which is great for that all important first impression.</li>
    <li> I decided to use this one because of the second gel they include for sensitive teeth. I just use it twice a week, sometimes if i forget just once a week.But still my teeth are noticeably whiter now than when I started, but not really whiter, i think i must use it everyday to make it so brighter.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like my smile at all. Years of smoking and coffee drinking has turned my teeth a disturbing yellow shade. I wasn&#x27;t about to spend thousands for dentist whitening treatments and I&#x27;ve tried several of the national brands with disappointing results. On a whim I picked up this package and wow it made an immediate difference. My teeth were noticeably whiter with only a few treatments and  my teeth look just as good as my friend&#x27;s and he spent way too much at his dentist.&lt;br /&gt;  I am incredibly lazy and if a product is too much trouble then I won&#x27;t use it. These were so easy to use it was scary. The price is also very affordable especially when compared to in office dentist treatments but also compared to nationally advertised store bought brands which didn&#x27;t even work that well. I have a big mouth and the trays fit very well when I heated them up (which by the way was super easy). Overall my teeth look great and I like to smile again. I would definitely recommend the Shine Whitening kit because it works!</li>
    <li> Due to my poor brushing and care of my teeth in the past, I decided to try Shine Whitening to improve the overall look of my teeth. Testing different whitening products such as Crest Whitening Strips, I couldn&#x27;t find a product that would work. After spending over $120 dollars worth of whitening products, I was at the point where I felt like no product would be able to brighten my smile. My friend suggested this Shine Whitening Professional Teeth Whitening Kit and told me that it worked remarkably well for him. With nothing to lose, I made one last attempt to whiten my teeth by using this kit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over the course of a couple of days, I began to see a gradual change in the complexion of my smile! I couldn&#x27;t believe it! The yellow stains on my teeth that I had developed over years of poor brushing disappeared. I felt little sensitivity on my teeth which was remarkable compared to the harsh sensitivity I felt from the Crest Whitening Strips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In regards to affordability, the price of Shine Whitening is significantly lower than the store brand teeth whitening products. The instructions for use are pretty simple. After  heating the mouth tray provided, it can easily fit into your mouth without any trouble. I would highly recommend Shine Whitening if you would like your smile to look professional and white.</li>
    <li> wow. these are great! tired of that dentist and his chatty crew? you don&#x27;t need to go there for shiny white teeth. pick up the shine whitening kit and avoid that lecture on flossing. this kit is reasonably priced and easy to use. some companies have a mouth tray that is hard to use. after heating this tray, it fit on my teeth like a sock fits my feet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; i&#x27;ve heard people complain about crest white strips. no complaints here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;if you are looking to impress people with a great smile, start with shine&#x27;s teeth whitening kit!</li>
    <li> Although my teeth are usually pretty bright, my love for red wine and years of chronic coffee-drinking darkened my  smile a bit. Shine Whitening definitely restored the brilliance of my smile! The mouth trays were very easy to set up and use - They are a comfortable fit after heating and plus, they didn&#x27;t hurt my teeth like other teeth-whitening products I attempted to use. The results were so great, other people even noticed without any provocation on my part! Other whitening products I&#x27;ve used were not only more expensive, but way less effective. I highly recommend Shine Whitening to anybody who desires a quick, inexpensive and easy way to brighten their smile.</li>
    <li> Putting the gel on my teeth with the tray system is a dream. Strips are a hassle and often fall off. This product does not. It delivers on all accounts. I am recommending this and purchasing more. My smile looks great and I feel confident in my entire look now.</li>
    <li> Picture day is like a celebrity holiday for me now. My smile will be everywhere. Feel great about my teeth. Thanks Shine Whitening.</li>
    <li> Strips fall out of my mouth. Yuck. This system was easier and simpler.</li>
    <li> my wedding day is around the corner and now I feel great with a wonderful smile</li>
    <li> can&#x27;t get over how easy this product is to use. The guard makes it so much easier to use.</li>
    <li> Gel was spilled over package as the tip of the gel syringe was broken. All contents within the package were soaked.</li>
    <li> I will be using this again and again. My teeth look awesome and I won&#x27;t stop. Be careful though because if you overdo it you could hurt your teeth a little bit. Won&#x27;t be permanent but it might hurt a little.</li>
    <li> I love this product.  It really works.  There are way too many whitening products that do NOT work!  And this actually does. If you really want to see your tooth stains go away, then try this kit out!  Finally found something that really works!</li>
    <li> how can you not love this product…makes your teeth white and increases your confidence:)</li>
    <li> The trays are a simple solution for people who can’t get the strips working. My teeth are whiter and I enjoyed having the whitening solution stay in my mouth.</li>
    <li> I am a person who is addicted to tea. I need it first thing in the morning to kick my day off and keep going throughout the day. Ad mind you, its not black or green tea but proper Indian chai that is prepared by boiling tea leaves with milk, sugar and delectable spices. This addiction has left my teeth quite stained over the years. I have tried quite a few products avaiable like whitening strips and gels. Even though they provide some kind of relief at the first use and make my teeth probably a shade brighter, after a few days my teeth are kind of immune to them and i abandon the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That&#x27;s when I came across Shine whitening kit and boy does it work ! Just after about a week&#x27;s use, my teeth look so good now: they are visibly whiter and brighter. There are quite a few advantages that I felt differentiates this products from the rest. The mouthpieces become so soft and malleable after being boiled that they can be customized to fit my jawline perfectly. And that means absolutely no discomfort when I wear them. It provides better results than a visit to the dentist and that too at a fraction of the cost ! The accompanying video makes the whole process so much easier for first time users. I would definitely recommend this product to all coffee and tea lovers out there! No need to compromise on your daily dose of Tea/Coffee nor that perfect beautiful smile !!! Tea gets me going, Shine gel gets me beautifully going !!</li>
    <li> Hey everyone, I was a smoker in college and quit sometime ago.  I have never been the best at brushing my teeth twice a day either.  That is when I started to notice my teeth not as white as they could do be.  I saw the product on Amazon and was ecstatic!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product is super easy to use.  I am normally a little slow with following directions but If my slow self can, you can too haha.  The whiteness of my teeth also improved little by little.  Have only been on it for a few days and thrilled!  If you think you&#x27;re teeth should be whiter then check this stuff out!</li>
    <li> First off, let me start off my saying that I still use Invisalign.  With this, I have trays that are perfectly molded to my teeth, so this product was amazing for me.  I used the syringes to put the solution into my trays and wore them around the house.  I didn&#x27;t experience any of the gum irritation or oxidation that others are talking about at all.  When I took my trays off, I brushed off the remainder of the solution with no issues and noticed a big difference in the coloration of my enamel.  It was definitely whiter after the first use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used to drink coffee on a daily basis and wine maybe every other day, but since I&#x27;ve stopped that (and smoking!) I&#x27;ve been on a quest to whiten my teeth.  I continued to use this product for seven days straight, took two days off (went on vacation and forget to bring it with me), and then used it for another seven days.  By the end of my two week quest, I noticed my teeth were four shades whiter (according to the dentist shade guide) and with my regular brushing, I&#x27;ve been able to keep them this way.  I use the product for a touch up once every 7-10 days for a couple minutes, and I&#x27;ve been able to keep my teeth sparkling white.</li>
    <li> Shine Whitening did what many other products before promised but did not deliver on.  It gave me a white smile.  I am truly impressed with this whitening kit and the restoration work it did not my teeth.  The years of coffee drinking were literally washed away giving me the confidence to smile again in public like I have not done in many years as I was always conscious of how the coffee stains had left my teeth brown.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would certainly recommend this product and I wish I had know about it earlier.  It is easy to use and you get great results in such a short time frame.  More importantly it is so much cheaper than many of the alternatives I have tried before and unlike them it really works.  I feel like I am a dental hygiene professional now.  I can actually afford to keep my white smile.  Shine Whitening has done wonder for my confidence.</li>
    <li> There is a great cost on this product. I have purchased so many different teeth whiteners that I know what I’m talking about. This one works very well and also is consistently about two times less in cost for a comparable product elsewhere at a department store or Target or wherever. Will keep buying it as the price is low.</li>
    <li> Using for less than a week, but already seeing some results. Only 3 stars due to the very limited amount of gel provided in kit.</li>
    <li> I used to hate looking at pictures of myself. My teeth were not as white as I wanted them to be. But after Shine my teeth are pretty much how I want them to look. Use it and it’s easy. Put the tray in the mouth for about fifteen minutes a session for a couple times a week and my teeth are looking a lot better than before.</li>
    <li> Tray system works great here. Simple, easy to use. I would say that it’s great.</li>
    <li> I have to tell you, they work really well (much better than I first expected). Definitely worth the money - especially when comparing to Crest. I&#x27;ve only ever used the Crest whitestrips before I tried Shine Whitening.</li>
    <li> My teeth are whiter and I’m more comfortable with my smile, less self conscious. This stuff is at a price point that is reasonable and very competitive with the more name brand stuff, but this gives just as good results. Used for a couple months and I am very happy with results</li>
    <li> This whitener surprised me a bit. I didn&#x27;t expect much, but used it anyway. Definitely whitened my teeth a few shades. I can&#x27;t use most other whitening products because my teeth are incredibly sensitive. I purchased treatments to have on hand to treat the sensitivity after the whitening was complete and that was a waste of money as I didn&#x27;t need it at all. I&#x27;m impressed. This will be my go to from now on.</li>
    <li> Strips fall out of my mouth and slip off, it’s such a pain. But no such worries with the tray system. Just stick it in and let the gel do the work.</li>
    <li> Wow only a few treatments and my teeth look new. I’m sure I will have to keep it up or they will revert to looking like two bricks of butter but that is life. That is aging. It’s very amazing how quickly this product works. I am feeling great about my smile and I am bringing it out a lot more nowadays thanks to Shine Whitening.</li>
    <li> I found that this product is really good for sensitive teeth. My mom had many issues with that and I bought this for her and so far it’s been great. Her teeth look great and I have started to buy some for myself too. I could use a little bit of whitening myself. Will update with mine, but from where I stand it looks great.</li>
    <li> Bought and used. Saw a little difference. But two complaints. First... When you melt the trays in water beware that they&#x27;ll instantly melt together causing you to have to rip them apart and burn your fingers as well as completely deform the trays.&lt;br /&gt;Also, chemically burned my gums and cheek on the last day. Probably used more than I should have, so more my fault than the products. But just beware</li>
    <li> My teeth have seen good results after just a few sessions. After a few weeks it looked even better than before using this product. I can now smile with confidence.</li>
    <li> Just use crest white strips.</li>
    <li> I wanted to try this product - but after receiving the product there is no way I&#x27;d put this in my mouth. The instructions are terrible, packaging and materials are cheap, nothing is labeled, and there is zero information about what the actual whitening substance is. If you look at this company&#x27;s website it&#x27;s full of typos, broken links, and the like. Going to return this and buy something that&#x27;s proven safe.</li>
    <li> So far.  So good.  Ordered, Shipped, Received...</li>
    <li> My teeth look five, ten years younger and I’m happy with the results. Will continue using this products until I&#x27;m old in order to have a good and healthy teeth.</li>
    <li> I have no worries of coffee and tea stains in my teeth, because I have this very effective teeth whitening when I need it.</li>
    <li> Shine Whitening has done wonders on my teeth. Very effective teeth whitening.</li>
    <li> I decided on this one and I am very impressed. This product is really effective.</li>
    <li> I decided to try it out because I have got nothing to loose. As a reward I have all the gain from this product.</li>
    <li> Just as good as the professional kits from the dentist and a much better price, for sure.  The molds are not the most comfortable in a small mouth, but worth using for the overall whitening.  I recommend using as little gel as possible so that you don&#x27;t flood your mouth with it.  My gums are sensitive, so I have to use Vaseline on my gums prior to placing the mold in my mouth so that my gums avoid irritation.  I also take a day off so that my gums can also relax.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Warning...do not drink tea or eat blueberries after whitening or you are defeating the purpose of a whitening!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**This product was received at a discount in exchange for an unbiased review.</li>
    <li> I would say this kit is comparable to the more expensive ones on the shelf at Target or Walmart and sometimes those go for 100s of dollars. It’s insane. The cheaper ones don’t last very long—you have to keep reapplying it or your teeth will revert to the yellow stains. Shine Whitening seems to be doing a good job for a reasonable price and</li>
    <li> I found this product very easy to use and I recommend it to people. There is a little bit of work to be done up front with the mouth guard thing, but that makes all the subsequent sessions easier to deal with, actually. My teeth are whiter and I’ve been receiving many compliments from people at work. Love it.</li>
    <li> Worked exactly how it said it would and did not leave my teeth sensitive AT ALL, which every single product has before. If any complaints its that the trays are a little bit hard to mold to your mouth, but it gets the job done.</li>
    <li> The tray system is pretty genius. Strips like to fall off my teeth. This stuff stays on and I have had no problems going forward with this style of whitener. I don’t know why the major companies are ignoring this style, because it’s much easier for me to apply this than other types of products. Will continue to use.</li>
    <li> Shine Whitening stands for high definition, right? I saw my teeth on a home video and even I was like, “Who is that handsome guy with the handsome teeth?” No SD for this guy. I felt like a movie star and my boyfriend feels the same way. He said my teeth look great and it’s because I’ve been using Shine Whitening. He never gives me compliments so you know it’s true. I used to be self conscious about my mouth but now I put my mouth all over the camera and I’m ready to be a star. Hollywood here I come! I’m coming!</li>
    <li> made m my teeth a little bit sensitive but could really see a difference within a few uses</li>
    <li> So the treatments worked REALLY well. I saw a big change after the third treatment but I had a little sensitivity after each oneÃ¢Â¦ my teeth are normally sensitive and I find even the whitestrips make my teeth sensitive. 5 Stars for the excellent work it did making my teeth white though.</li>
    <li> Wow, the results were much better than I expected!  At first I wasn&#x27;t doing it according to the instructions, but when I got motivated and followed them exactly, I could see noticeable results in about 2 weeks.  My wife noticed the difference (she knew I was using it), and my co-workers all noticed (and none of them knew I was using it).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product for anyone like me who used to have a lot of tea and coffee stains on my teeth.  Follow the instructions, and you will be in for a pleasant surprise!  I enjoyed reading the company&#x27;s answers to other customer questions here on Amazon - they really know what they&#x27;re doing!</li>
    <li> This is a good value. I have seen tons of other products similar to this one with similar stats and this one is at a great price point to jump at. My teeth are whiter and I am saving money. This is great.</li>
    <li> I got a girls number because I talked to her. And I have my teeth to thank. She brought it up as a conversation starter and after that I was in. For that you will always have my business.</li>
    <li> So I have used a couple of different treatments. Most of them were the leading toothpastes version of this very product. So I decided to do exactly as the instructions indicated. I have real sensitive teeth, so I could not use it daily. I opted to wait a few days between cleanings. And unlike the other products that I have used, this did not hurt me as much as the others did. I&#x27;m still uncertain of the reason why, but for what it&#x27;s worth, if you have a problem or sensitivity then this product would probably be better for you in my  opinion. Also, using a Q-tip to apply the gel on my teeth worked a lot more efficiently.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For what it is worth, I have never tried the light treatment method, so with that being said I think this product is the superior one of all the ones I have tried. And the price is comparable to the 3D system by Crest, so if you are in the market for a really good whitening kit, then I would have to recommend this one to you over the others. I normally don&#x27;t recommend anything unless it supersedes expectation, and this definitely did. So i hope this helps anyone on the fence about the purchase. .</li>
    <li> I am smiling a lot more and a few people yesterday even got me with a “wow your teeth look great.” I guess I feel like hey weren’t my teeth fine before? But I guess not. It feels good to be noticed in this way and I will keep using this product. I’ve only used it for a handful of treatments too.</li>
    <li> Very poor product. If you&#x27;ll notice many of the latest reviews are not Amazon verified purchases and are most likely scams- they review many of the same dietary supplements and this giving them all 5 stars. The whitener substance works fine, but after putting the mouthpiece in boiling water one of the mouthpieces melded together to the point of becoming unusable. I purchased this based on high reviews but beware, the company is luring in false reviews and I would not buy this product ever again.</li>
    <li> Horrible! Didn&#x27;t whiten at all.</li>
    <li> This product now sits along with my toothbrush and my floss in my bathroom. I don’t use it every day because I would be crazy, but I do use it often enough, perhaps three times a week. And it keeps my smile shiny and sparkly. I love how easy it is and I slip it on and listen to some music for a little bit and it’s over. Painless.</li>
    <li> The tray system is simple. Heat up the plastic and bite down to make a mark. It saves a lot of time in the long run. Believe me. Give it a shot.</li>
    <li> I drink coke at least twice a day so you can imagine how yellow my teeth are. I needed to do something about it. Shine whitening is amazing - so easy to use and made my teeth white so quickly.</li>
    <li> I am proud of my teeth now and plan on continuing to use this product because it really remove the stains in my teeth.</li>
    <li> I think it makes me look professional and im really impressed with how little effort it took to make that happen. Easy to use product.</li>
    <li> I am glad to report that I had no issues with Shine Whitening in my mouth. Love this product.</li>
    <li> I used this product, just a few times and it worked out and my teeth are back to normal again. I will just have to keep using this product every once a while.</li>
    <li> My teeth are a lot whiter that&#x27;s why I do not regret my decision on trying this product.</li>
    <li> I decided to do something about it and purchased this product. It worked like a charm. Nice buy.</li>
    <li> Works freaking awesome. I&#x27;ve always wanted to get some teeth whitening treatments but my parents would never allow me to have one. I had to go and save up just to buy this, (Just kidding, I&#x27;m employed.) But this stuff is freaking awesome. Had whiter teeth in a week. There are some spots but they are nigh unremarkable.</li>
    <li> Teeth are 3 shades lighter after finishing treatment.</li>
    <li> The mouth pieces aren&#x27;t that hard to use. If done right, it helps create a very well-fitting mold to ensure even application of the gel on your teeth. The syringes&#x27; small head size make it a bit tricky to apply the gel, but with practice you&#x27;ll get it. Also, when they say &amp;#34;no gel on gum&amp;#34;, they really mean it. The first time i did it, i left too much gel on my gum, and as a result, it burned and discolored my gum for like 10 minutes! If you feel the gel reacting with your gum, wipe it away with a Q tip or sth. Noticeable results after a bit more than a week!</li>
    <li> I bought these after trying a few things, and I must say, these are the only ones that seem to have instantaneous results. I would say a shade or two whiter! I noticed a significant difference right after the second use. I am very happy and would absolutely purchase this product again.</li>
    <li> Shine Whitening is a professional grade teeth whitening kit.  One daily use will yield dental results.  Priced just under $30, it&#x27;s definitely a bargain.  Years of stains can be eliminated in a matter of days.</li>
    <li> A perfect whitening solution for anyone looking to improve their appearance!  I&#x27;ve always had OK teeth, but recently I&#x27;ve noticed a bit of yellowing.  I tried many different products, and had little success.  Only when I found Shine Whitening products did I realize that whitening products could work for me!</li>
    <li> This is one of the most amazing teeth whitening supplements that I have ever come across. It has changed my life and I am very much happy with the results. On regular use my teeth began to turn white and I am able to have a broad smile on my face. Thanks to such a great product which is a life turning one for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Loved it!</li>
    <li> I have an overbite that I have learned to live with and slight discoloration on my two front teeth from years of coffee drinking, and to top it all off, my dental plan&#x27;s teeth whitening treatment was way too expensive. I was thinking this was another cheap store bought kit that Crest and Colgate offered, but as I did a little research I felt a little more confident. This was the first whitening kit that didn&#x27;t make my gums sting or make my mouth feel a little raw. I also really liked the fact that the mouth trays fit comfortably on my teeth. With steady usage I noticed a slight difference after 5 days. After two weeks I noticed a huge difference almost as if the stains were hardly there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used all of the gel in the syringes, but I have to say that, if I can stay away from the coffee, I can keep my teeth white this time. I suggest buying a back up kit for those of you who love those staining foods and can&#x27;t give it up. My favorite thing about this product was the cost being so low for what would be considered professional whitening strength. The second thing I love was that it was a quick turnaround from day 1 to day 14. Definitely a purchase well worth the time and money. For anybody considering this product it&#x27;s a great buy and can save you from the cost of what professional dentists will charge.</li>
    <li> Works. Did what others said, applied gel w Qtip to teeth, then put guards in. Took a few tries to get guards to fit right, but they reheat and reform easily. Don&#x27;t cut the tabs off until very sure they fit correctly. Gel has not bothered my gums. Have used 3 times and my teeth are visibly whiter. Easy. A little goes a long way. Still have not used up the first syringe. Edit to add: Maybe use this up faster. I found the syringe rubber deteriorated after using the syringe for about 2 weeks. I had to throw the first syringe away. Black rubber bits and liquid oozed out. A lot of air became trapped in both syringes even though I stored them in a cool, dark place. I removed the gel from the second syringe and used a different container. The gel itself works great. I stopped applying the gel directly to my teeth, placed it right in the tray since the coverage was better that way. I had no irritation at all. I would order again, but immediately remove the gel from the syringes.</li>
    <li> This whitening system is by far one of the best products of its kind that I have ever used. I have been using the product for 5 days and already I see an improvement. My coworkers are all commenting on my wonderful smile. This is something I will continue to buy for a long time. I work in a field that requires me to constantly smile and show my teeth. This product has made me more confident.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like this product so much that I just ordered one for my mother. This will be the perfect gift for her. They say a woman&#x27;s best curve is her smile, so what an amazing gift for an amazing woman. I will refer this product to everyone! Save money on your dentist bill and whiten your teeth in the comfort of your home.</li>
    <li> I love this product! My teeth are easily 3 shades whiter since I started using this product a month ago! I&#x27;m a heavy coffee drinker so I knew that I needed some help keeping my teeth white. I came across this product and decided to give it a try based on all of the great reviews. It is super easy to use and not as messy as some of the other whitening products that I have tried. I also love that it only takes a few minutes every day to do! I would recommend this to all of my friends and family and I would recommend it to you too!</li>
    <li> This product is really works! I could see results already after my second using.  It is very easy for using also. The Whitening kits come with double tray. and it is very convenient and I can save my time. I have used this product for about a week now and I very like it.  A difference in the color before and now is very big. Few of my friends asked me already how I reached this results and what I did? And I recommend Kits for them!</li>
    <li> I have yellow teeth because I drink coffee religiously so I decided to try Shine Whitening Professional Teeth Whitening Kit after my dentist suggested that I use a whitener. I’ve tried other products in the past but, nothing came close to the results that I’ve gotten with using Shine Whitening.&lt;br /&gt;The taste wasn’t bad, a little minty and no stinging sensation. I’ve been using it for the past three weeks and I have seen some MAJOR results. I love this product and will recommend it to others, it was money well spent!</li>
    <li> As an avid coffee drinker, and a smoker, I had some pretty stained teeth. No amount of tooth brushing made a difference, and even the special tooth pastes didn&#x27;t help. But this... this did the trick! It&#x27;s been some time since my teeth were this white! Very impressed.</li>
    <li> Prior to purchasing Shine Whitening, I have had a lot of problems with my teeth over the years.. This was one of the only products that gave me the results I needed for a decent price.</li>
    <li> Was worried that I wasnÃ¢(tm)t going to like this product because IÃ¢(tm)m used to the strips, but I gotta say this is much much better than whitestrips. It fits my teeth perfectly and itÃ¢(tm)s better than the whitestrips because it really gets in the indents around your teeth. The only thing IÃ¢(tm)d say is just make sure to use the q-tip technique as that really helps a lot to get the solution on all parts of your teeth.</li>
    <li> Always on the market for new teeth whitening products. I drink a lot of coffee so I need all the help I can get when it comes to keeping my teeth clean. Fast delivery, works really fast and now my smile is brighter than ever. Definitely check this out.</li>
    <li> So far this product hasheld up. Definitely takes the coffee stains back a step. And I like my coffee strong and frequent, so that&#x27;s saying somethng. Everything included with this product is just fine, including the mouth guard. I had to boil and set it a few times and ultimately cut half a inch off the back of each one since they gagged me when in! But that&#x27;s just due to my small mouth, not a product defect.</li>
    <li> I have tried every whitening product on the planet and this is the only one with visible results almost immediately. Other products have made my teeth seriously sore after using them; this one does not. It&#x27;s easy to use, straight forward and actually works!</li>
    <li> This. Product. Is. Sick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a smoker and big coffee drinker, so yellow stains on my teeth have always been a huge problem for me, especially since i spent thousands of dollars straightening them. Not even a trip to the dentist can bring back the white in my teeth. I&#x27;ve been using this for less than a week, and my teeth are already whiter than they&#x27;ve been in years! It&#x27;s super easy to use, barely takes any time, and makes a huge, immediate impact.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I give this my highest possible recommendation!</li>
    <li> Used for about a week now and I have to say my teeth have never been whiter! Really happy with the results and will continue to use it.</li>
    <li> Strips are thinner than the mouth piece that comes with this system and they often slip off my teeth. Also they do not cover all of my teeth. Why do I want white streaks on my teeth? I want them all to be white. Will continue to use this product.</li>
    <li> I usually don&#x27;t do reviews but I loved this product so much I had to. I&#x27;ve tried tons of other kits in the past this one is my favorite by far. For the price and results of this kit I don&#x27;t know if you will find anything better. I have sensitive teeth and the gel was awesome I had no problems at all with discomfort.  For anyone that is a coffee drinker trying to whiten fast this kit is definitely for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Each tray fits comfortably in your mouth and each syringe is easy-to-use! This is pretty much a two step process to having whiter teeth. There is no sticky film you have to struggle with you just pop the gel in the whitening tray and your ready to start. I&#x27;ve already recommended this product to my mom and sister when they asked me about how my teeth got so white. I love this product it gives you a noticeable difference in a short amount of time. Plus it beats paying my dentist hundreds to get the same effect. Buy this you won&#x27;t regret it! !!!</li>
    <li> Shining choppers thanks to Shine Whitening ! Do it every night before bed and it’s like getting teeth whitening done as you sleep. Great product.</li>
    <li> Enjoying how my teeth look. Someone asked me if I got veneers. Haha. Anyway, only after people ask I tell them I use Shine Whitening.</li>
    <li> Pays for reviews.&lt;br /&gt;Be aware.</li>
    <li> I would highly recommend shine whitening for anyone who smokes or drinks soda/coffee.. It really works and don&#x27;t miss out on it.</li>
    <li> I love taking care of my teeth, but due to drinking coffee for years, my teeth has started to show more yellowing. I looked at a lot of products on amazon and in store, but I was sure this Shine Whitening would do the trick. For reference, I used some Crest straps and it made my teeth too sensitive. I needed something more gentle. Althoug this is a tray, it doesn&#x27;t take too long use. I usually have it on while watching a TV show. The difference I saw was notable after the first 2 uses and felt more confident with better results after continued use. I&#x27;m at the 3rd week now and my teeth are pretty much back to when I was younger. With the strips, my teeth were whiter, but not as white as this.  Good product for the price also!</li>
    <li> Gotta admit... .was super skeptical about this product... but the results were hard to deny. This stuff works fast. No real complaints except be careful for teeth sensitivity. Its best to use it every 3 days not everyday.</li>
    <li> This stuff works great and you get a generous amount. I reach my goal withing 2 weeks and I still have 75% of the product left. This is a great value.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wont have to buy whitening gel for a long time. I also noticed that this didnt hurt my sensitive teeth. Truly a 5 star product.</li>
    <li> It actually worked.. love it</li>
    <li> Enamel erodes with time and the natural state of our teeth is yellow. ThatÃ¢(tm)s too bad but I started using Shine and my teeth are as white as before the enamel started eroding. I use it twice a week and saw results in about a month. Tray system is great.</li>
    <li> This product is very effective! WOW- I absolutely love the results. My teeth are A LOT whiter, I even like this product better than those crescent white stripes. This product works quicker and really whitens your teeth. I am very happy with this product and will be using this product from now on! Oh and the best part is, the results last very long. It has been a week so far and my teeth are still white! LOVE IT!</li>
    <li> Very reasonable price compared to the strips at Target or elsewhere. IÃ¢(tm)ve used this product for the past 20 days and the results have been pretty good, similar to ones IÃ¢(tm)m used to from other products. Would buy this one instead.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had trouble getting rid of the coffee stains left on my teeth. Even my dentist now has trouble with all their tools they use on me. It gets a little expensive to keep going back every couple months. Damn addictive coffee. Bought this a while ago and they seem to work for me really well. I use the treatments every couple weeks and it&#x27;s kept the stains to a VERY small minimum.</li>
    <li> I followed the instructions to mold the trays to my teeth and when I attempted to take the tray out of my mouth half of it ripped apart.  Now I&#x27;m $30 out for an absolutely piece of garbage.</li>
    <li> The taste of the gel makes it worth getting this product. Does not want to make you want to gag. Will order again.</li>
    <li> 1. they work so much better than the strips. 2. using the trays is a lot easier than trying to place the strips in the right spot. 3. almost no sensitivity 4. works with the first treatment unlike the strips.</li>
    <li> The taste of the gel makes it worth getting this product. Does not want to make you want to gag. Will order again.</li>
    <li> I decided to try shine whitening and it&#x27;s like I got them done professionally. I am very impressed.</li>
    <li> I am always getting compliments from my friends and coworkers on how nice my teeth are. I will use this product again.</li>
    <li> The mouth piece takes some set up but other than that itÃ¢(tm)s really simple and easy to use. I use it twice a week and my results have been steadily climbing. My smile is brighter and I feel more confident thanks to Shine.</li>
    <li> Trays do not form well to your teeth.  If you have had professional trays before you will be disappointed.</li>
    <li> My teeth are noticeably whiter actually two whole shades whiter the first week but the part I like the most is that it lasts longer than anything iv tried I&#x27;m buying again the price is very reasonable I do say you get more for your buck.</li>
    <li> I drink more tea than any of my friends. This really helps with the tea stains that I get. Now I have pearly whites!</li>
    <li> Got these for a wedding im attedning soon, my teeth were getting very yellowish from years of drinking coffee. This reversed it completey, and by the way im 40 years old!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only ever used the Crest whitestrips before I tried Shine Whitening; I have to tell you, they work really well (much better than I first expected). Definitely worth the money - especially when comparing to Crest</li>
    <li> Im very happy that I have no pain or discomfort after using this kit.</li>
    <li> I can continue to drink wine and coffee with the help of this product..i&#x27;m VERY HAPPY with that.</li>
    <li> I like this so much better than the strips.</li>
    <li> My teeth are sparkling after using this only a handful of times. Great work.</li>
    <li> Burnt my gums badly after one use. Bleached my gums as well. Im positive this is a scam..dont waste your money.</li>
    <li> I tried something similar like this years ago and didn&#x27;t notice much improvement after going through the treatment. I was a bit skeptical at first when I bought this but WOW was I wrong! After my first use there was clear improvement in the whiteness of my teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Due to the fact I&#x27;m a daily coffee drinker, I have a hard time removing coffee stains from the back of my teeth but the cool thing about the kit is it comes with a teeth tray to hold the whitening formula in place. Other kits I&#x27;ve tried in the past were usually a film strip that tended to come loose shortly after putting them on my teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know some people in other reviews have stated having issues with the strength of the gel, but I would advise to use a little at first and see how it works. My gums are slightly sensitive and I didn&#x27;t notice any uncomfortable sensation when applying the gel. The taste is slightly minty and nothing you probably haven&#x27;t experienced before if you brush your teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I was very satisfied with this product and will continue to use is whenever my teeth become less white.</li>
    <li> My teeth are looking really good. People at work are noticing and it only took a couple weeks for results to come in. I thought it would take longer but that’s not true. Tray system was easy to use and I recommend anyone give it a shot.</li>
    <li> First off I see people reviewing this product who haven&#x27;t even tried it. Which I think is highly unreasonable and rude.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used this product 4 times total so far everyday. (Once a day for four days straight).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I apply with a q tip because this minimizes or eliminates sensitivity with your gums- haven&#x27;t had a problem with sensitivity yet AND I&#x27;ve been using this product for 15-17 minutes at a time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My teeth aren&#x27;t sensitive to cold or hot which his great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You see results after the first use and every use. However I must warn you it&#x27;s not like your teeth becomes fluorescent lol. Give it time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After the 3rd try my teeth has this cream look. Not yet off-white but it&#x27;s slowly getting there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fact is that this work and I wanted to share that with you guys.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Follow the instructions please.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also look on my profile, I&#x27;ve done many reviews so it&#x27;s not like I&#x27;m a phony reviewer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very happy with my results- I hope you are as well.</li>
    <li> It took a few weeks but my teeth have whitened up. I like the tray system better for me which is why I stuck with the product. I will continue to use it to see if my results get even better.</li>
    <li> product seems to work just as good as what you would get at the dentist office.</li>
    <li> Ive giving 5 stars for a great product, finally found of these on Amaxon which actually works.</li>
    <li> in the past I have used crest whitestrips and I felt that they make my teeth a little sensitive, they start hurting after a while of having the strips on. Got some advice from a friend of mine to try the gel type like shine whitening and its great. So much better than the strips. othe gel doesn&#x27;t hurt my teeth whatsoever, you would imagine it would since it&#x27;s much stronger than the strips alone.</li>
    <li> its really convince me that this product really work after I see that my teeth really whitens than before.</li>
    <li> After years of smoking I didn&#x27;t think my teeth could come back from it. But I guess it does work, because after about a couple weeks of using this product my teeth look not half bad! I would recommend anyone looking to whiten up their smile to give this a shot.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only ever used the Crest whitestrips before I tried Shine Whitening; I have to tell you, they work really well (much better than I first expected). Definitely worth the money - especially when comparing to Crest</li>
    <li> I had some stains on my teeth from years of neglect. I wanted to use a teeth whitening system that wasnÃ¢(tm)t tough on my teeth and I used strips before and they never got the job done. I think itÃ¢(tm)s because they kept falling out of my mouth. But I started using this product and the mouth tray system was a little bit of a pain to set up. I got it done and I have to say it was worth it. It fits and never falls out and keeps the gel in place. Pretty great. Since it was so easy to use I began to use it twice a week and my results are happy. My teeth are probably two shades lighter and the stains are starting to fade. IÃ¢(tm)m happy with results and will continue to use this product.</li>
    <li> Results after one use,  after three it maintained the results very easy and kind of silly to have the trays in</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s the best whitener I&#x27;ve tried because it is so easy to use. There is no mess.</li>
    <li> I like to use this every couple months. Im a really heavy coffee drinker and shine whitener really helps get rid of 99% of the stains.</li>
    <li> I use it four or five times a week and my teeth are greatly whiter. I am very happy with my results and Shine has restored a bright smile to a very happy young woman.\\&quot;</li>
    <li> I wasnÃ¢(tm)t so sure about these when I bought them, I thought it was a little expensive compared to everything else out there but then I got the package in the mail and it looked very profressional. I&#x27;ve seen the stuff that my dentist uses with people and it costs like $300 for just one treatment with him. I tried it out the other tday and what can I say other than it weas amazing, and so much better than I thought when I first bought it. The pictures do not do it justice.</li>
    <li> I read some of the reviews here and I found it very easy to use the mouth tray system. ItÃ¢(tm)s a good price for what it does and I am very happy with the results, my teeth are noticeably whiter.</li>
    <li> I started using Shine and did not really notice a difference until I caught myself in an everyday situation. It only took maybe a week or two to see this, and now that I think about it other people do treat me a little differently. IÃ¢(tm)m smiling more and carrying myself differently. Thanks to Shine my confidence is up.\\&quot;</li>
    <li> Crest strips are a pain in the ass. Thank you Shine White!</li>
    <li> I like this product much more than the strips. The trays are comfortable and easy to use (they actually stay in unlike the strips). I found my teeth where so much whiter after a week of using it everyday. I am very happy with the purchase.</li>
    <li> I used to go to the mall every few months to get my teeth whitened, until I realized that the same exact product is being sold only for a lot cheaper. It&#x27;s basically the same except there&#x27;s nobody there to help you do it - so if you know what you&#x27;re doing or can read instructions this a good product for you. You&#x27;ll save some money and get the same whitening experience.</li>
    <li> You get a lot of product for what you need. It is worth the money.</li>
    <li> I like this Shine Whitening product because it seems complicated at first but is actually simpler than ever. and for months of using it,my teeth have become a lot whiter too.</li>
    <li> I smile a lot more after using this product. Never looked better. Brightens up my face overall.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing, so much better than \\&quot;Dr Song Home Professional Teeth Whitening\\&quot;. I would recommend it.</li>
    <li> I hardly drink coffee, but I do smoke. The yellow gets really noticable after a while. I have used trays before from some other brand, they didn&#x27;t work for me too well I got the goop all over and everywhere.. These ones are pretty good, no mess and easy to use no argument on whether or not it works. It works real good brings everyhing back to BETTER than normal.</li>
    <li> This is a good process to whiten my teeth. I enjoy seeing it work and I like flashing my smile to strangers and friends alike now.</li>
    <li> Tray system works so well, they should implement it in many other whitening solutions. I know this one works well and fits into my teeth like a glove. Other items do not fit as well and often strips slip off my teeth. It&#x27;s very troublesome and they should fix it. This is the only product that i&#x27;ve seen with this sort of system in place. Recommended.</li>
    <li> Great product and was easy to use. The only trouble I had was getting the trays to fit my mouth but I have a smaller mouth than most people. I was also worried about the sensitivity that was stated in the directions but was surprised when I did not have any troubles or tingling feelings during the treatment. I am going to try the tray trick stated in the directions to see if the trays fit better for the next treatment but overall, great buy. I did not have to pay full price for this item and in return I had to give a review but I feel this product is well worth it.</li>
    <li> I put it on twice a week and it has maintained a good level of teeth whitening. I was a heavy coffee drinker before and my teeth have yellowed because of that. I feel great about my teeth and showing them off to people. I get comments from my family that they’ve noticed a difference and that feels great.</li>
    <li> I’ve only used it maybe four or five times and so far my teeth look amazing. Very surprised and it’s very good for the price. Other products I have used and it took a few weeks to get off the ground but not so with Shine Whitening. I consider this one a recommended buy.</li>
    <li> I am an amateur music video director so I have to look at a lot of people and this one singer I recommended him to whiten his teeth because they looked a little yellow on the dailies. Well he got Shine Whitening  and we did some reshoots and now we are just gonna shoot the entire thing again because it would look so weird that in some shots he has gross ass teeth and in other shots it looks all white like a star in the sky or something. Anyway, it’s an R&amp;B song and all the ladies will be looking out for it soon, we should sing a song about Shine Whitening  lol this is gonna make his career.</li>
    <li> I like this Shine Whitening product because it seems complicated at first but is actually simpler than ever. and for months of using it,my teeth have become a lot whiter too.</li>
    <li> I loved this product! I&#x27;ve tried many over the counter whitening pastes and this one has definitely shown the most results! I recommend it!</li>
    <li> tried shine whitening because I heard good things..I was nervouse about how sensitve the strips were going to make my teeth BUT it totally didn&#x27;t. 2 thumbs up!</li>
    <li> Very happy about this whitening product - its been 2 weeks and I&#x27;ve only used it 4 times but each time I&#x27;m seeing some significant whitening. I don&#x27;t recommend using this daily, just use it when you need a touch up, that&#x27;s the best way.</li>
    <li> I dont like it at all</li>
    <li> ItÃ¢(tm)s better than strips. Strips keep falling off my teeth. My teeth are not flat, they cannot hold stickers or whatever. Trays are the way to go, and the gel is minty fresh too.</li>
    <li> saw a noticeble difference after 2 uses. Love how easy it is to use the product</li>
    <li> tried shine whitening because I heard good things..I was nervouse about how sensitve the strips were going to make my teeth BUT it totally didn&#x27;t. 2 thumbs up!</li>
    <li> Strips often slip and slide around in there and I can&#x27;t believe they haven&#x27;t adopted this method from this product here. Or at least put out an alternative in the market to their systems. This one works well and I like to set it and forget it. My teeth are whiter and it&#x27;s not a hassle.</li>
    <li> Bad cigarette habit, but now my teeth are looking better because of this. Use it twice a week and so far I have gone from yellow to three shades lighter.</li>
    <li> I brush every day, I floss every day, and just about every other day I now use this product to whiten my teeth. Everything is in the routine now to make me looking my best. And it works. My teeth are whiter and I feel great about it.</li>
    <li> I think this is a great bargain for people looking to whiten their teeth a bit. I have used it for a number of weeks.</li>
    <li> I have seen so many prices for whitening products and this one is very reasonable. In fact, I would go as far as call it cheap. But I used it and it works really well so it&#x27;s bargain.</li>
    <li> I have seen so many versions of this product on the market and none of them are this cheap. I started using it, very weary, but surprised that the tray system works better than other ones. Better price for better performance? Any day of the week that is a deal. Jump on this one, guys.</li>
    <li> People around work are asking me about my teeth. I end up telling them but I thought there was such a groundswell that I would come on here to show some love online as well. I recommend this product as it&#x27;s easy to use, just fifteen to twenty minutes every few days will keep your smile sparkling and great looking.</li>
    <li> Looking forward to taking those wedding photos now. I am a groomsman and I took a good look at myself in the mirrorÃ¢Â¦ a few pounds could be shed but most of all my teeth looked kind of gunky. Used this product and I am much better now. Ready for the world.</li>
    <li> White teeth are desirable. It&#x27;s probably even a dealbreaker for many daters. I used it and I got a date. Coincidence? Maybe. But do you want to risk it?</li>
    <li> Strips and other methods just do not stay in my mouth very well. I will keep using this product if only because of the ease of use. Very happy with the results.</li>
    <li> This was surprising. I saw that my friend used this product so I copied her. The difference that I saw seemed like it would take months, but this was not the case. Just a few treatments in and my teeth look awesome. Glad it took such a short time to see results and I will be using it as upkeep. I recommend this product to anyone looking to whiten their teeth.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t seen my teeth this white for many years. It&#x27;s good to be back, old friend. Me and you make my face come together for sure. Will continue to use.</li>
    <li> Trays are much better for this product, it&#x27;s better than strips in my opinion and my experience. It&#x27;s a simple system where you heat the mouth piece a little bit and bite down to form a seal. Then the piece is formed for your personal mouth and will stay put for sure. Then you apply the gel and it whitens your teeth as much as you use it. Recommended.</li>
    <li> Making this part of my routine. Need to whiten my teeth--maybe it&#x27;s genetics, but my teeth are prone to being yellow. Since I was a young teen, even. Anyway, I need hard upkeep to make sure I don&#x27;t look like a monster, and this process makes it easy for me. Stick the gel in the mouth piece and bite down. I like this way because it saves time. I can keep it in and it won&#x27;t budge, and I can finish some homework or do something else in the meantime. After ten or fifteen minutes I pop it out and go about my day. Boom. Whiter teeth.</li>
    <li> Whiter teeth just gives me more confidence. I don&#x27;t know about the rest of you, but it does for me. I look in the mirror and flash myself a smile and people may know I am checking myself out but I just want to look good. It works out in my favor though. I get good feedback for how I look and I have only been using this product for maybe a few weeks. Good stuff all around.</li>
    <li> This is a refreshing product and I enjoy using it, which is saying a lot. My teeth love it too.</li>
    <li> I have sensitive teeth to the point of pain, and I started to use this product. I have no issues really with it and that took me by surprise. I have tried other solutions and they have all given me a bit of irritation and discomfort. I will keep using this product and it has whitened my teeth fairly well.</li>
    <li> I have sensitive teeth. I am worried they would hurt. I can barely eat cold things. But I didn&#x27;t have any issues with this product. Very happy with results and I didn&#x27;t know I would be able to use any whitening. But that&#x27;s not true.</li>
    <li> My friends have all noticed that my teeth look nicer. I will keep using it and I&#x27;m glad they noticed too. I just regret not finding it sooner.</li>
    <li> Whitening strips often fall off my teeth, it’s nuts. Why can’t they stick on? Whitening gel shouldn’t be adhesive and if it is, I am worried. So I understand. But Shine Whitening is coming in with the assist and making it easy for us with a tray system that is unparalleled.</li>
    <li> this was a waste of my money. the molds were ok. they were the only thing that worked. the whitener, however was another story. one tube wasn&#x27;t sealed properly so most of it spilled during shipping. the other tube, the black rubber gasket inside the syringe had rotted. any time i tried to use the gel i would get black pieces of rubber in it. chucked the whitener. kept to molds.</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with my order. I have used the&lt;br /&gt;whitening system for just one week and I am noticing a difference already. Most systems simply whiten and do not give the teeth a polished look. This system does both, it whitens and gives the teeth a polished, shiny look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I have received several compliments on my teeth. It&#x27;s like a paid a ton of money for laser whitening but no I spent a reasonable price on this system. I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> \\&quot;Shine Whitening Gel,\\&quot; does what it says!  I have tried a few of these so called \\&quot; teeth whitening\\&quot; products with very little results if any.  Recently, I came across \\&quot;Shine Whitening Gel,\\&quot; and gave it a try.  The results have been great.    I just began using this product three days ago, I already see a drastic change. No stinging or burning as with prior gels. I have sensitive teeth and  sensitive gums so this is a plus.  I am satisfied.  This is now my go to for brighter teeth and a pretty smile.</li>
    <li> I am pleased with Shine Whitening.  Originally, I had considered having my teeth professionally whitened, but decided to “do-it-myself.”  I have to say that for the results and price, I am quite pleased.  I looked at a number of teeth whitening kits and finally decided on Shine Whitening based on the description and the reviews.  I have noticed a significant difference in the color of my teeth, as they are much whiter.  As a regular coffee drinker, I was really beginning to notice that my teeth were no longer very white.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Shine Whitening kit is complete, simple to use and effective.  The tray fit to my mouth and was comfortable.  You simply load the gel into the tray, pop it in your mouth and wait a few minutes.  When you’re done, you rinse the gel off your teeth and you’re done.  I like the ease of use and quick results.  I noticed my teeth becoming whiter each day.  An effective product and good value!</li>
    <li> At first I didn&#x27;t want a &amp;#34;tray style&amp;#34; tooth whitener product, but when I was offered a long-awaited role as a stage performer where I had to interview for the role I needed to act fast.  I was referred to this product by a friend of mine to be the fastest-acting whitening product there is on the market without a numb or sensitive feeling afterward.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  I purchased it, used it once a day for one whole week and noticed my teeth got a definite three shades brighter.  It is very simple to use.  The website shinewhitening.com had a tutorial video explaining how to use this product and any information about the product I needed.  There is almost an undetectable mint taste while applying the product, and zero funky aftertaste. It absolutely does not hurt my teeth or cause numbness, stinging or sensitivity.  And I still have a whole half syringe left!! I strongly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> the kit was easy to use and set up - i like how it form fits and you can reheat the mouth pieces for a better fit - so far so good</li>
    <li> So, a good bit of my unhappiness is my own fault—I&#x27;ll just say that off the bat.  Like with many &amp;#34;self-improvement&amp;#34; dalliances, I purchased this kit in October and didn&#x27;t get around to finding time to use it until now.  So goes the life of a mother of small children. However, when I went to open the package, both syringes had exploded inside!  The black rubber stopper portion of the one that still had some gel in it had begun to disintegrate. Guh-ross.  I pitched the whole messy kit.  After I received the box with this kit in it from Amazon, I opened the box and put the kit in my bathroom drawer where it sat undisturbed for the past few months until I resurrected it for a little beauty pick-me-up.  There is no way that the damage to the syringes was caused by manhandling on my end.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bad on me for not opening the package when I received it and letting it sit so long, but bad on the supplier for mailing something this faulty.  I will not repurchase because I am skeptical of the quality.  Off to buy some WhiteStrips.</li>
    <li> There is a pleasant mint flavor here, and it gets me motivated to use this product more and that’s good because if I do it two or three times a week my teeth look great.</li>
    <li> The tray system works really well for me! All you have to do is bite down and it’s simple as that. Fill up the tray and bite down. It’s not a fuss like some other systems and it works very quickly—although I have to say it does take a little bit of time to set it up at the beginning. But worth it.</li>
    <li> Teeth whitening is expensive. At the dentist, it’s a professional job. At Walmart, it’s just too expensive. But this one is a good price and works just as well, as far as I can tell.</li>
    <li> I have extremely sensitive teeth. I have used whitening strips in the past and they hurt my teeth. But this product is great. I have had no issues at all. I only used a little bit of gel and only once a week but I have had no issues and that is a pretty good thing. Would recommend.</li>
    <li> Found some of this product in my brother’s room and saw him using it. His teeth were a lot whiter than normal so I started to use it too. My teeth started to yellow a bit because I don’t really take care of them.</li>
    <li> I found the tray system very easy to use. My friend came over and I used the product and she asked about it. She then thought it was “too hard” and said she would be sticking to strips. Well, that’s fine. But I can say that this is the most convenient way to whiten my teeth. She did admit that strips fell out of her mouth sometimes and I think I may be swaying her a bit. I would recommend this product to everyone.</li>
    <li> This is a marvelous product.  The way I applied it was with a qtip and then a tray making it much easier.  I have used it for 5 days now and I beginning to see a difference in the color in my teeth!  I am so happy Shine Whitening!  I can&#x27;t wait for the end results!</li>
    <li> I found this product to be great for my teeth. My teeth are less yellow and are really white now. I was shocked how quickly I was able to change my teeth. My teeth are pretty sensitive and this product was able to whiten my teeth while not irritating it.</li>
    <li> I bought this because I don&#x27;t have very straight teeth and the crest white strips don&#x27;t work as well as the trays. These trays defiantly do the job for me and I like to leave them on for 20 minutes and the gel doesn&#x27;t have a bad taste either. My teeth defiantly look a shade whiter than before.</li>
    <li> Seems to be a good, only used it two times and see my teeth are significantly whiter</li>
    <li> I was worried that this might make my teeth sensitive, but luckily I followed the q-tip technique and had no issues.</li>
    <li> This product worked great. It made my teeth a little bit sensitive but did a great job whitening. I would purchase it again.</li>
    <li> I drink a lot of stuff that stains teeth so I have to use Shine to battle it. I think it works better than strips because the mouth guard holds the gel and bathes your teeth in the solution, not just tiny strips. Works for me.</li>
    <li> \\&quot;So excited that I found this product. Shine has improved my life, if thatÃ¢(tm)s not too much for me to say. I donÃ¢(tm)t think it is, either. My face is the first thing most people see and a good smile goes a long way for first impressions. I used Shine for a few weeks and if I had to put a number on it I would say my face gives a 25% better impression than it did before. Maybe 33%.</li>
    <li> Whitens teeth very quickly. I did not experience any sensitivity, which I was really happy about. There is a slight taste to the product, but it actually tastes good, so that is not a problem. I will continue to use this product as directed to maintain my results. It is more than worth the investment, since I&#x27;m guessing the results are almost as good (maybe even AS good) as professional whitening treatments. I saw a difference right away and I&#x27;m thrilled.</li>
    <li> Used to have these spiderweb looking stains on my fornt teeth no matter how hard I brushed. No more, just one use.</li>
    <li> ok so Ive heard great things about shine whitening, never heard of them before a couple months ago. Giving it a try now. So far so good. 5 stars.</li>
    <li> Shine has produced results similar if not better than any other product IÃ¢(tm)ve used on my teeth. Every year I have to start whitening again and this time around I went the Shine route and IÃ¢(tm)m here to say itÃ¢(tm)s no budget operation. It is, of course, but I mean it does just a good a job as anything else IÃ¢(tm)ve tried. Worth every penny and more.\\&quot;</li>
    <li> I drink a lot of coffee and IÃ¢(tm)m glad to say that after a few sessions my teeth are a lot better looking than before. I will keep using it and let you guys know how it looks in a month or more, but for now a big thumbs up for this product.</li>
    <li> I really like the teeth whitening results I&#x27;m getting</li>
    <li> I have tried some other kits in the past but they always burned my gums... With this i was able to mold perfect trays that fit my teeth so i didnt have that problem. It was a good tip to use a Q-tip to apply the gel as some other people have said in their reviews, since you can get the gel right to where you want it. If you accidentally mess up dont worry you cant actually harm your gums or teeth with this.</li>
    <li> This product is very effective! WOW- I absolutely love the results. My teeth are A LOT whiter, I even like this product better than those crescent white stripes. This product works quicker and really whitens your teeth. I am very happy with this product and will be using this product from now on! Oh and the best part is, the results last very long. It has been a week so far and my teeth are still white! LOVE IT!</li>
    <li> Great price for what you get</li>
    <li> People are noticing my teeth at work. They ask me what system I am using and I let them know. I will also let you guys know and leave a positive review, because it&#x27;s a deal.</li>
    <li> package came as described in a bubble-wrap envelope. I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;ll be perfect but it&#x27;s good so far.</li>
    <li> I really like the tray because it is easy to use. There is really no mess you have to deal with. I would really recommend shine whitening.</li>
    <li> Using countless products to whiten my teeth, it has racked up quite a bill. So I am always on the hunt for some sort of bargain. Seen this online for this price and I was taken aback. I tried it out and I&#x27;m here to tell you guys that this is the real deal. I used it for a handful of sessions and my teeth look great, and also it&#x27;s a pretty good price. I&#x27;d get it for that alone.</li>
    <li> I have seen so many prices for whitening products and this one is very reasonable. In fact, I would go as far as call it cheap. But I used it and it works really well so it&#x27;s bargain.</li>
    <li> Secretly bought these for my husband. His teeth are horrible and he doesn&#x27;t do anything about it. Im going to tell him itÃ¢(tm)s a thing that builds his enamel. Lol.</li>
    <li> Tried it out for a few weeks and the results have been staggering. Will be doing this into the future. My teeth look a lot better and I am surprised. Why haven&#x27;t I been doing this earlier? The price is good for the amount and quality that you get too.</li>
    <li> Five out of five stars for the look I just got from a pretty lady. I flashed her a smile and it looked like she was having a bad day, but she smiled back. Maybe it didnÃ¢(tm)t have that much to do with how white my teeth were, but I FELT more confident because of how white my teeth are now.</li>
