<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I tried this hand soap after the dish washing soap made by the same company. It removes dirt and grease from my hands without being drying. A big bonus: it is totally non-toxic. I will keep buying from this company, for sure.</li>
    <li> A well designed product.</li>
    <li> Love this company. Soap smells great.</li>
    <li> Works well. I am sensitive to smells and it does not bother me.</li>
    <li> We love the soap, but don&#x27;t like opening a box of already opened soap. Goop everywhere and 1/3 of the product missing from both dispensers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The downside is that it&#x27;s too much of a hassle to send back bottles like this. They are so sloppy. The box is sticky. The invoice is sticky. I just hate doing it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, I guess we just deal with 2 not-full bottles and consider whether to reorder and risk it again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;8(</li>
    <li> very nice scent , did not dry my hands out.  would recommend to others</li>
    <li> The Better Life No Regrets Hand Soap works very well.  It&#x27;s much more gentle than the Bath and Body Works soaps which I normally use.  The only downside for me is that I am not a big fan of the scent.</li>
    <li> Nice hand soap, doesn&#x27;t dry out my hands like other soaps do. I am an avid gardener so I do a lot of scrubbing up and this product works well and smells fresh too.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this soap!  Have you noticed how hard it is to find handsoap without Triclosan?

It&#x27;s also sulfate free, has no synthetic dyes or fragrances, contains no parabens or phthalates or any of that nasty stuff.  As a bonus it can also be used as a face wash or shower gel.</li>
    <li> I like it a lot.  Smells great- very refreshing.  Nice consistency as well.  Spilled out during shipment however amazon handled it very well.</li>
    <li> Smells great, cleans great and is all natural what is not to love?! I will be buying this for a long time to come.</li>
    <li> I use this handsoap all the time.  It smells nice and I feel great knowing its safe for my family and the planet.  I have tried other green products from other businesses and they seem to lack the cleaning power.  No Regrets delivers.  Good work!</li>
    <li> I have only been purchasing organic/vegan/eco friendly products and no animal testing.  I only have one cleaner is my house called Bio Green Clean (greatest cleaner in the world and it&#x27;s 100% American made).  I use Eco-Me Dish Soap Suzy (Amazon).  I decided to try this product because I thought Ivory clear liquid soap was natural but it&#x27;s not and it&#x27;s full of sulfates and other chemicals. I found this product on Amazon and got rid of the Ivory and I love this product.  Highly recommend and will buy again.</li>
    <li> Love the smell and that there are no sulfates or chemicals in this!</li>
    <li> We love this soap at our house. Not only does it work great, it has a nice, light scent. But, the best part is we no longer have dry hands. With young kids, we do alot of hand washing. My husband and I always ended up with cracked hands. We&#x27;ve had no issues since switching to this soap. I bought another \\&quot;green\\&quot; soap at a local store and my husband&#x27;s hands starting drying out within days of switching. Best soap ever.</li>
    <li> Smells great, lasts long for size of bottle.</li>
    <li> Amazing line of products.  I have this hand soap in each of our bathrooms.  It smells great!  I love that it&#x27;s all natural!</li>
    <li> It works fine for what it is.  Not sure if it&#x27;s a terribly good value, however.</li>
    <li> excellent hand soap! Smells great and cleans well without harming the environment. Nothing else to say.</li>
    <li> I have been researching sulfates and trying to substitute healthier and safer products in our household. I ordered this a put it in with our two busiest sinks. It is fantastic! It cleans wonderfully but doesn&#x27;t strip your skin or nails. We love the smell and ordered more for our other bathrooms. This is a new favorite. :-)</li>
    <li> No fragrance and a good product as far as ingredients, but I find it extremely drying to my skin.</li>
    <li> I use this as a face wash and shower gel and when I&#x27;m drying off, my skin is very, very smooth and soft.  I love this product and since skin is our largest organ and absorbs everything put on it, I feel great in knowing that I&#x27;m not ingesting anything harmful when I use this.</li>
    <li> like the smell, love that its not tested on animals.</li>
    <li> We love this hand soap.  It smells great, cleans great and is all natural.  Better life products are amazing, we use their whole line of products in our house.  We feel much safer keeping the house free of harsh chemicals for our dog and toddler.</li>
    <li> Obsessed with all of this brand&#x27;s products. Don&#x27;t even think twice and replace all of your household cleaners and soaps with this brand. I promise you will have no regrets!</li>
    <li> Great smell, rinses clean. I have used this as a hand soap, body wash and face wash. I like that it is not filled with unnecessary chemicals.</li>
