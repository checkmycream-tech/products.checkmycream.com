<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I have had this palette for a few years now I love the colors very pigmented if you order it you will love it</li>
    <li> I ended up throwing this makeup in the trash. It looked to powdery and it is a poorly made product. I would never buy this again.</li>
    <li> I was kind if hesitating on buying this product but I was looking for a reasonable palette for a good price. So I did some research and I heard that the palette was pretty good so I bought it. When it finally came, I opened it and about 3 or 4 colors where broken. I was pretty angry about that but I fixed that problem. But! I cannot tell you how much I love this palette. There are a variety of colors to choose from, both shimmery &amp; matte. The colors are very pigmented and they go on very easy. I have been using this palette mostly everyday since I got it! And I also love the logo on the front of the palette. If you&#x27;re looking for something that is at a pretty low price but have an amazing quality then you should buy this!</li>
    <li> Great product. Arrived quickly, all eye shadow was intact, colors are bold. If your looking for really bright colors this has plenty. I&#x27;d definitely recommend this.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very happy with the palette I  got. Deliver was good,none of the pots had cracks. I&#x27;m glad I got it. All the colors I need!</li>
    <li> I received the eyeshadow and not only is the colors not very bright once you put them  on. But a bunch of the shadows were broken. The set is made very cheaply and the packaging looks like something you would buy at a dollar store.</li>
    <li> I like the product. Bight colors and great pigment. A lot people were complaining about shipping and I did have the same problem one of my blacks broke but not badly so Im not upset about that. I was replacing my E.L.F pallet from target and I like this one much more. A lot of great colors though a bit more expensive. But over all I do recommend this product..  p.s.a   I wanted to try this product because I always like to try new makeup brands but also look into E.L.F I&#x27;m a real fan for people who like doing a fab everyday makeup without breaking the bank..</li>
    <li> I bought three boxes of these shadows, two arrived broken, I was extremely disappointed because they were gifts.Therefore lost money spent on these.</li>
    <li> All in all, the product is good for the price, a couple of the shadows were broken, so I took a star off... I&#x27;m a beginner but I have noticed some if the shadows are more potent ( can&#x27;t think of the right word) than others... Def use a primer... And you should be good... I have dark skin, so if they will work for me, they will work for you...</li>
    <li> Beautiful &amp; vibrant colors. My niece loved it!</li>
    <li> My shipment came on time(the expected date of arrival), my makeup wasn&#x27;t damaged because the wrapping was Excellent ... They have every color an shade you can think , It&#x27;s amazing I Love it. Best money I&#x27;ve spent !</li>
    <li> Love the eyeshadows!!! They are awesome!!! I received everything I ordered on time and not damaged. I&#x27;m very happy! Thank tou</li>
    <li> I love to use bright colors and am picky about what makeup i buy. This is the best pallet i have ever purchased. The colors are beautiful, vibrant and last. My order was shipped fast and was in perfect condition</li>
    <li> Th  e product is very good, the colors are vivid on, amazing selection, but I suggest better packaging, my box arrived broken and about 6 of the colors are completely unusable.</li>
    <li> This was brought for me teenage daughter and she loves it.  It was bought at a fantastic price and has enough colors for her blends.  She was so excited when she received it for Christmas.  I am so glad it was available on Amazon for her.</li>
    <li> When I recieved this palette I was very surprised! I read reviews about colors being broken during shipping, but all the colors were in perfect condition. There is a great variety and all the colors stay on all day! Even when I go to the gym in the evenings, they stay on until I get in the shower. I will be buying this palette again!</li>
    <li> I love these colors! i get compliments every where i go and because there are so many colors, i get to mix and match something different everyday!</li>
    <li> Absolutely love it! Looks great. Doesn&#x27;t fade. Only prob I had was that when I got it it was a little messy, like two of the colors had started to break apart and the powder got all over the case so when I opened it it got on my clothes etc. I was a bit diappointed with that, but I just put it down to being incident to shipping. Once I cleaned it up &amp; started using it I felt way better though.</li>
    <li> The colors in this palette are beautiful.  When applied over the eyeshadow primer, the color is even more vibrant.  A few of the colors were crumbled during shipping but otherwise I love the variety.  Also, because I don&#x27;t always apply my makeup on at home, I am looking for a smaller palette to carry in my cosmetic bag.  Or it would be great if the colors could be removed individually!</li>
    <li> I bought this as a birthday present for my 14 year old daughter.   She loves it! Thank you for offering such a cool product at a good price.</li>
    <li> I like this product very much. It was very inexpensive for the adjoint if colors you get in the pallet. The colors aren&#x27;t as bright by themselves, but with a good eyeshadow primer, the colors are vivid just a advertised.I would definitely recommend this produc[[ASIN:B0047TGS5G FASH Bold, Bright and Vivid Eyeshadow, 120 Color Palette]]t to others, in fact I already have! Lol</li>
    <li> This product is the perfect make up accessory.  It has a lot of really nice colors and they apply well and last all day long (although I do use it with a eyeshadow primer).</li>
    <li> Love the bright colors, every color needed is in this kit, you will need a primer if you want more pigment.</li>
    <li> I purchased this palette, not expecting much. I assumed I would have to use a ton of primer to really make the colors pop. I was wrong! Even though FASH provides an extremely good price for their products, it has FAR exceeded my expectations! I&#x27;m not really into makeup, but bought a palette anyway. The colors were extremely pigmented and blended very easily! The only complaint I would have is that the black colors are kind of weak, but a great black is hard to find anyway. All of the other colors were very rich and vibrant and did not require 100 layers to make the colors show up! If you were like me, and hesitant to purchase because the price may sound too good to be true, you are wrong! I&#x27;m going to order every palette I can from FASH only now! Thanks FASH cosmetics!! I had 2 colors break during shipping, but I&#x27;m not holding FASH accountable for that. My only suggestion is to maybe pack the product differently (it came in a lightly padded envelope). Other than the 2 colors that were broken, the rest of the shades were intact. I&#x27;m so impressed with FASH cosmetics and I have told everyone I know about the brand! Definitely ordering again!</li>
    <li> This is my first eye palette and I will being buy 3 more for family and all I can say is it is amazing and I took every color and put it on my arm and they are so pretty I cant wait to use this. Shipping was fast and nothing was broken even the box was nice that it came in. And it was well wraped. Thank you</li>
    <li> The eyeshadow itself is bright and stays on your face very well, but when the make-up arrived some of the colors were all crumbly and broken.</li>
    <li> When it arrived in my house there was four broken eyeshadows and that was the only problem that I have.</li>
    <li> Shipping was fast, arrived before stated date!! Eyeshadows are very pigmented and stay on. None of the individual shadows were cracked, they arrived in perfect condition!! I will be buying from FASH from now on!!</li>
    <li> I bought the palette but was not impressed at all. The colors just don&#x27;t have good pigmentation and you have to put alot on to get any color especially the lighter colors. YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR!!!  I dont understand how it has good reviews?</li>
    <li> I bought the item and it arived really fast, great item, good quality.  I recommend to everyone, there wont be regrets.</li>
    <li> The colors are so different on dark African American girls</li>
    <li> The delivery was good. No shadows was broken.  The only problem is... the matte  colors are not pigmented like the shimmery ones. You&#x27;ll definitely need an eye primer. The product is decen; good to build ur Makeup kit.</li>
    <li> I ordered 2 of these, one for me and one for my cousin. The only issue I had was one of the colors in my pallet was broken when I received it, but I blame it on shipping. The colors are bright and bold and fun. The seller had everything at my door the very next day! I would totally order again!</li>
    <li> I bought this eye shadow palette for my daughter and she loves it. The variety of colors is just what every teen girl is looking for when entering the makeup world. The entire set comes complete with just enough selection to figure out which colors are the favorite.</li>
    <li> Received this item quickly. The colors are vibraint and there are alot of hues. My only complaint is that 3 of the colors were broken when received. Still, the price was reasonable for what you get.</li>
    <li> I love it, the only problem is there is not a red, there is pink and orange, but no red. K other than that it&#x27;s great</li>
    <li> I think the color palette on this product is great but you need to figure out a way to ship it better. 6 of my colors were broken by the time my product arrived. Other than that, I love the variety of colors I have to choose from every morning!</li>
    <li> This product is fabulous! The colors are bold, bright, and beautiful and work great! Only problem I had is that the on side of the pallet wouldn&#x27;t stay in the case. I have it left open on my dresses with the plastic on top.</li>
    <li> Received the palette with all shadows intact. The colors are vibrant, however since I&#x27;ve been playing around with the palette for a while now, there are some issues with the colors. Some of the lighter matte colors do not show up on my skin tone, while other matte colors are highly pigmented. Some of the shimmer colors are too close and are essentially the same color, some are highly pigmented and some do not show up on my skin at all. Overall it&#x27;s a good starter palette if you want to just play with a wide range of colors and find a good general color for your skin or play with different looks. The colors in this palette are very bright and in general not suitable for a professional setting, I ended buying the Coastal Scents 88 color Warm palette and have been having much more success with that palette for looks in the office.</li>
    <li> Fantastic for the price. I&#x27;ve had this for a couple of years now and its held up very well. There&#x27;s a distinct &amp;#34;cosmetic&amp;#34; smell from some of the colors but its not a big deal for me. Most of the colors are beautifully pigmented and stay strong throughout the day. Two of the colors arrived broken but were very easy to fix. Overall, I love it. Its great.</li>
    <li> I ordered this palette not knowing what to expect....reading all the reviews, it seems ppl either love it or hate it, no in-between....I ordered so I would have lots of different colors to play with not really for a daily wear item.  I&#x27;ve seen these palettes that look exactly the same but are sold under various brand names for various prices...I got mine for $16.99 with free shipping, not bad, but this palette is elsewhere on Amazon for $12.99 including shipping...WOW!!!  Now alot of ppl are complaining \\&quot;they don&#x27;t get much of each color\\&quot;...well, I was pleased, the shadows are abt the size of a penny, and how much sparkly green do u really expect to use anyway??!!  It arrived in good condition, only one shadow was cracked, the matte black and it didnt spill into the other shadows.  The shimmers are WAY more pigmented then the mattes....Gotta repeat what everyone else says...USE A PRIMER!!!!!!!  This is the only way u will get the color payoff.  IMO, NYC white is the best to use with these colors, they REALLY POP!!!!  Just a FYI...invest in a good black matte/smimmer shadow, even though this palette has two matte blacks, they suck and look grey on eyes!</li>
    <li> My daughter loves it. Thank you!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my niece for christmas. it came right in time but it was packed in a thin yellow bubble wrap lined envelope. So when i opened it some of the eyeshadows were shattered. pretty colors. though next time i will stick with bh or coastal scents for my eyeshadow orders. they take more care in paking and shipping.</li>
    <li> I  am a makeup artist and drag queen.  This product is amazing.  The colors blend so well together. The palette goes from dark color themes too light.  JUST AMAZING ALL IN ONE MAKEUP! In the picture I am the one with the makeup on.</li>
    <li> Some of the pots were broken!</li>
    <li> the colors are very pigmented and apply beautifully to my skin, im so in love seriously. There are so many different things you can do with this pallet.</li>
    <li> Best reasonably priced eye color palette I have purchased to date.  I love that the colors are matte and they brush-on dark and crip and stay that way.</li>
    <li> I love em! My clients get a vivid &amp; very professional look with these...and they are reasonably priced as well!</li>
    <li> ok so im in beauty school &amp; people call me the makeup queen...i know what good quality makeup is...&amp; this makeup palette is REALLLYYYYYYYYY good i love it! i have a darker complexion because im latina &amp; i always use primer before applying them on, but they are very pigmented &amp; the price is great! oh! &amp; i definitely recieved them in perfect condition! &amp; very quickly! i love this makeup palette!</li>
    <li> Little chalky, but pigmented nicely. Crazy colors. Lots of blues and greens. Tons! Wish there were more different colors instead of an entire pallet of blues... And I like blue.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a complete makeup junkie.. hoarder ..and so on haha..I just love makeup..and loveeeee eyeshadows..I&#x27;ve seen so many eyeshadow palettes that basically look like they all have the same colors. I read the reviews on this product and people seemed to be pretty happy with it..The only thing I was worried about was receiving my palette and having broken eyeshadows!!! My order came two days before its estimated date which was GREAT!! I was a little nervous to open it lol but as soon as I did...I was soo excited to see that NONE of the shadows were broken!! &#x3D;D My eyes  lit up seeing all 120 colors..and thinking about the endless possibilities of shadows I can mix and match...haha..I immediately opened it and began swatching the colors..I was impressed the colors were soo vivid and bright!! some were not as bright as others.. but i&#x27;ll use nyx jumbo pencil in milk..and the shadows will pop!!! lol i would defintly purchase these shadows again!! :)</li>
    <li> Great palette, love all the vibrant colors!</li>
    <li> This is my new favorite eyeshadow palette! Tons of colors that apply smoothly &amp; last all day, even without primer.  Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> I love it! The colors are vivid and beautiful, I would recommend this product. Great for the price not too bad</li>
    <li> I really like the assortment of colors, but there are very few that are actually useable (browns, tans, golds, other neutrals). Unless you&#x27;re into clown makeup, or you&#x27;re one of the ten people on this planet that can magically pull off rainbow eyeshadow, this probably isn&#x27;t the best choice. The blacks and browns are pretty good though, I use them often with my Naked 2 palette.</li>
    <li> Awesome perfect colors looks amazing and the colors are so bright and wonderful wear them all the time they go with any outfit and eye color</li>
    <li> Great pro product. Bought it for wife and she loves it. And i saved a lil $ too!! Will buy again</li>
    <li> These colors are beautiful, and plentiful. The range of colors and in between&#x27;s is just outstanding. I absolutely love it!</li>
    <li> Fantastic makeup. With the huge variety of colors, I always have matching makeup to go with whatever I&#x27;m wearing. Most of the colors are vibrant with little amount of product.&lt;br /&gt;A couple of them shattered during shipment, but it wasn&#x27;t a huge deal, I could sweep the powder back into the cup it came out of. It didn&#x27;t really get mixed in with other makeup.</li>
    <li> The product was delivered super speedy. Completely in tact, no broken colors. The colors are beautiful. So many choices and they&#x27;re very easy to blend. I use an eyelid primer and with that the colors went on smooth and stayed in place all day long.</li>
    <li> I love this product. It arrived very quick and none of the eyeshadows were broken. Great packaging. Id recommend to anyone</li>
    <li> When i received these eyeshadows I was surprised because i wasnt expecting them till 2 days later.&lt;br /&gt;when i opened them OMG it has every color u can think of...different shades of blues, greens, pinks, blacks, grays, I can find any color to go with any outfit. I also use a shadow primer and they last me aalll day. i even use them wen I go dancing and come home and go to sleep and the color is still there when i wake up (I know your supposed to wash off makeup before you go to sleep, but sometimes you cant) lol&lt;br /&gt;Most colors are very vibrant but some others u need to apply more to get it to the color that is is in the pallete but other than that I am very happy with these eyeshadows :)</li>
    <li> I received my pallet in great condition, also the colors are magnificantly beautiful. Very pigmented, noticible, and bright. I love al of it and love how ive been getting complimented on it all. I would recomend this product to everyone.</li>
    <li> Product received, my daughter was happy with it.</li>
    <li> I was a bit worried about getting this product especially with some of the review&#x27;s saying how they received thier pallet broken.BUt my pallet was packaged great and there were no broken pieces.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a x-mas present, she loved it!&lt;br /&gt;I am glad I chose this palette over other products</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t be any happier this set it&#x27;s just AWESOME and it was soooo cheap I&#x27;m just in love with this set.</li>
    <li> i LOVE this palette. it is perfect to take on photo shoots, and weddings on location! its pretty amazing. none of the shadows were broken, and i would totally recommend it to a friend. my only bummer was that there was no TRUE red. there was only an orangey red. but it was still spectacular</li>
    <li> I ordered this palette because I wanted a palette with some bright colors. I received it in perfect condition. Nothing was broken and the colors are amazing. I did some swatches on my hand and when it came time to wash it off they only came off with the help of soap. First I tried to wash it off with just water and rubbing with my fingers and it only smudged a little! I say this is a great buy &#x3D;)</li>
    <li> I found this while shopping online with my girlfriend, and she was very excited to try it out.  It arrived in perfect condition - admittedly, she was skeptical that such a good price would deliver something of such a good quality, but it arrived with no broken colors or anything.  It was very good quality, and she has had a lot of fun using all these colors to pretty herself up!&lt;br /&gt;To repeat myself, all colors were intact on arrival and the packaging was VERY secure.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you so much for a great experience!</li>
    <li> Love it , love it, love it!!! These shadows are amazing it  came exactly as shown. What a treat for the person who has no limits when it comes to eyes shadows.</li>
    <li> The delivery was quick everything was intact.  The colors are bright and vibrant just like they say. Excellent</li>
    <li> I love my kit wish it had a brush</li>
    <li> Just what I wanted! Colors are intense,striking and beautiful!</li>
    <li> It was a gift to my wife and she loved it.</li>
    <li> I was so excited when it came in the mail but i was worried a lot of the eyeshadows had broken but it was just one. other than that i love it. the colors are very pigmented and they kind of give a mixture of matte and shimmer and i love that as well. the only thing they should do is probably put an extra bubble wrap around it so no colors will break.</li>
    <li> The colors are great and I think the value is good ($15-20 for all of these colors) but the image of the two eyeshadow trays fitting into a single case the way they are shown is misleading. You can&#x27;t secure an eyeshadow tray in the top cover - so instead you have to stack it on top of the other one and switch them every time you want to use a color from the bottom tray, which is annoying and potentially messy. It was also annoying that 3 colors came broken, including a medium gray color, the color I wear most, and there is only one medium gray in this whole palette. (I&#x27;m less annoyed by the blue and green colors that are broken because there are so many others to choose from.)</li>
    <li> Mine came ABSOLUTELY perfect, definetly a BUY. This is the cheapest GOOD make-up I&#x27;ve ever purchased. There are places like Bhcosmetics.com or Coastalscents.com  but THIS is the buy. SAME quality as anything I&#x27;ve ever bought. You need to get this it has ANY color you could ever want and more. It was prefectly wrapped and I can&#x27;t wait to test it out on some of my friends. :)</li>
    <li> I bought this after reading the reviews with a bit of hesitation, as soon as I opened the envelope and saw how protected it was, I was wondering what everyone was saying about the broken shadows. Until I opened in, I had two colors damaged from being mailed but what can you expect? Take a dime and press with all you have and bam shadows are packed again! :) I am thrilled to say with some eye primer or with out it this product looks and feels amazing. I always was skeptical about less expensive eye shadows due to store bought ones, this on the other had had great pigment and silky soft like the more expensive brands! I have done my eyes like a peacock feather, and purple and black and they stayed on all day, and the colors were vibrant! Get this product you will not regret it!</li>
    <li> This palette is awesome!! I love it.. come complete and perfect condition I just put a little be of nyc white jumbo pencil and stick perfect !! Sure gonna buy this palette again!!</li>
    <li> I really like the brushes n the eye shadows But the only thing I didnt like was that some of the eye shadows got here already broken that wat I didnt like......</li>
    <li> I bought this for my daughter as a gift. It arrived just fine, everything in one piece. She loves varity of colors and coverage. Well worth the money.</li>
    <li> Brought as a birthday  gift for my daughter, who wants to be a makeup artist....She loved it had all the great colors she needed .....Great quality .....Someone else loved it too and stole it from her, she&#x27;s heartbroken, but since it&#x27;s not expensive I will replace it</li>
    <li> As far as colors and price are concerned, it is great. But, when I received the product in the mail, many of the colors were broken. The company should package much more carefully.</li>
    <li> This is a great set of eyeshadow and its super affordable.  It arrived in 2 days as promised, no broken eye shadows.  The colors are VERY pigmented and apply as good as any expensive eye shadow i&#x27;ve purchased.  The negative/low reviewers just dont know how to apply makeup properly. There is a little fallout from the shadow but nothing major. Very happy with my purchase!</li>
    <li> Order was received earlier than expected. Exactly as advertised online. I couldn&#x27;t have gotten a better deal elsewhere. Love it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this for about 6 months or so and I love it! Best selection of make up and great colors. They don&#x27;t wear off either! Very nice and perfect price!</li>
    <li> I had not broken colors or spreading with powder. In fact each &amp;#34;flat&amp;#34; of colors were individually wrapped and the also have a plastic sheet for keep colors from spreading. I&#x27;m quite pleased with the purchase, since this is my first time working with many eyeshades I wanted something cheap to begin with; there are some beautiful colors in here and I&amp;#34;m quite please overall.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product for my teenage daughter. First of all, the product was in perfect condition when we received it. Second, The colors are vibrant and go on smooth. My daughter loves to experiment with the colors and multiple combo choices. I was leery at purchasing because of the negative reviews. However, I am glad I made this purchase. I will be buying this product again soon, for myself.</li>
    <li> This is one of my favorite palettes. The colors are vibrant and easy to apply. I have oily skin so i have to put on a primer and nyx white eyeshadow pencil to make the color stay but once I do that the colors look amazing. This product was inexpensive and had fast shipping.  The packaging was great, I didn&#x27;t have any broken palettes. i would totally recommend and planning on buying another one when I use up the first one.</li>
    <li> This palette is really great! The  colors are very true and apply smoothly. Like everyone else I would recommend using a white primer. Esp for all my drag sisters out there! This palette offers many options. I like how a little bit goes a long way. Cuz they  are small! Also I like how the palettes lift up out of the case, because the case does not lay flat when open. My black was chipped when it arrived. If your looking for a nice makeup palette that doesn&#x27;t cost as lot, buy this!</li>
    <li> I am huge on make up and I love bright colors. The fact that I have a brown-ish skin makes it hard to find colors that look great on my skin tone. This package is super cheap for its greatness! The colors apply with optimum consistency and you do see them perfectly. They also blend pretty well. I am mainly using them for more dramatic looks since they are filled with bright colors. Honestly, I was happy that I was able to create professional looks while the colors did not look cheap on my face. I simply take it everywhere considering I travel around 5 times a year!</li>
    <li> Love this! Arrived on time and in perfect condition.  Super bright colors.</li>
    <li> I love this! The colors are amazing and so bright and vivid! This was my first palate ever and I am in love!</li>
    <li> I ordered this eyeshadow a little leary after reading some of the negative reviews that the colors were all broken. I ordered and received the shadow 2 days later and only 2 shadows were broken. No big deal...the colors were BEAUTIFUL, bright and vibrant with multiple colors to choose from. Different shades of each color and it shows up really well considering I am african-american. It&#x27;s not MAC makeup by any means but it is very good quality. definetly recommend.</li>
    <li> I was so nervous about this product that I checked video reviews on youtube before purchasing and I loved it. But since some of the reviews said that theirs came broken or partially broken I felt a bit insecure since my package would travel farther away to my hands. But they came out in perfect conditions, all the colors. All of them are pretty, veeeeeery pigmented, and some of my friends wanted to steal it from meee. BUT NO WAY! Im 27 and Im a amateur putting makeup. I always have someone else who do my makeup for me, but i wanted to start to learn with good products and not too expensive. It was definitively beyond my expectation.</li>
    <li> When i recived this package i was excited, but when i opened it there where four eyeshadow palletes broken up right down to powder. Yes i had to throw them out. I will not be ordering any products of this brand to ensure this doesn&#x27;t happen again.</li>
    <li> My palette arrived with two broken shadows, a black matte and a light blue shimmer. Cleam-up was easy, and I then went crazy and swatched everything hahaha! Here&#x27;s what I found through swatching and wearing daily for over three months:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Interestingly enough, it&#x27;s the mattes in this palette that really make it worthwhile. All the shadows have a mediocre quality, but with the right eye primer (I highly recommend Jesse&#x27;s Girl Eye Primer) these colorful mattes are very usable and will last around 10-12 hours. They are not highly pigmented, but buildable enough to be workable. If you are a fan of purple shadows, you will not believe how amazing the purple mattes are!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reason I only give this palette four stars is because almost all the shimmers, especially in the brown family, are basically impossible to use. They are hard, chalky, and don&#x27;t register on the eyelid no matter how much product is caked on. Another problem is the few yellows and gold here are very sheer and not long-lasting. One of the reasons I bought this palette in the first place was the yellow matte shadow, so I was really disappointed haha&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another reason for the rating is that even though there are 120 (!) shadows, it seems most all of them are in the midtone range. This means you have to get pretty creative (mixing, layering, etc) to make higher contrast looks with only this palette.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall! For the price, this is a really awesome palette. Personally, I think it&#x27;s an excellent starting point for experimenting and figuring out what looks you like to create, then investing in higher-quality versions of those colors.</li>
    <li> I have tried this same product from several different brands.  Sometimes the quality is not always good but I am very pleased with the 120 palettes I have purchased.  They were packaged well with bubble wrap inside and outside of the box.  The colours were very highly pigmented and were easy to blend and work with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the amount and variety of colours and the fact that it was bought for someone just starting out with makeup, I think it is very good value for money.  I would re purchase for a beginner again.</li>
    <li> This set is absolutely full of beautiful colors that stay on all day. Combined with the NYX eyeshadow base is even better! There are so many fun possibilities with this set! It is so worth the purchase!</li>
    <li> Great product and great transaction! This was a Christmas gift for my daughter. She was very happy with it. Thank you!</li>
    <li> I have three other palettes similar to this and this one is by far my favorite. I do understand what people say about the color being light when you put it on - I regularly use a primer though so I didn&#x27;t even notice that. The colors are very vivid and the variety is fantastic. The only thing I don&#x27;t like (and I&#x27;ve found this to be a problem with every other palette I&#x27;ve gotten, honestly) is that there&#x27;s not a good red color. There&#x27;s dark red, pinkish-red, orangeish-red, but not just a good solid red. That&#x27;s a minor issue though compared to how awesome this product is. Love it and will definitely be looking into other FASH products.</li>
    <li> A little difficult to seperate using the little tab.  But overall very nice</li>
    <li> Best eye shadow pallet ever!!!</li>
    <li> It was really a nice set and I would have gave it a 5 star but when it arrived one small set was destroyed inside otherwise everything was good and my girlfriend like it</li>
    <li> These colors are just what I have been looking for! They are extremely bright and I love how they have colors with and without glitter. I love the assortment of colors also. All the colors I use and also colors I&#x27;ve needed but never had. The only reason I gave it 4 starts was because the colors seem to fade quickly. Other then that, great buy! Especially for 120 colors at $11.</li>
    <li> I bought this pack of eyeshadows for my daughter-in-law for Christmas.  It is very professional looking - all the sections were neat and in place; the colors are pretty and I am very happy to present it as a gift.</li>
    <li> Beautiful colors. .....</li>
    <li> I read the reviews on this item before purchasing, and my review will be very similar to the others.  The colors are great.  There are lots to choose from, and they are vibrant and last a long time.  However, the company should work harder on packaging for delivery, as 2 of my shades were crumbly when I opened the box.  Not sure how they can remedy this problem, but I can assure you that once they figure out the best packaging technique their ratings and reviews will be much, much better.  The quality of the product is great, just not the packaging.</li>
    <li> Beautiful colors in the pallete.  Product is high quality and VERY sparkly.  It looks like very a small amount of each color, but it is such high pigment  that it is a STEAL at the price.  Would reccomend to anyone and I HAVE!</li>
    <li> I love the amount of colors I received.. When I received them at least 4 of the colors had broken while shipping and the colors aren&#x27;t as vivid as I thought they would be...</li>
    <li> I bought this palette out of curiosity. I watched product reviews on YouTube, and it seemed like a good product at an amazing price. The shadows are chalky and there&#x27;s a lot of fall out. I don&#x27;t know for sure, but I suspect that the shadows contain harmful ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recently, I bought a Tarte palette with an orange-gold-pink shadow, and it looks amazing on me. I thought there might be more colors that I should try, which is why I bought this rainbow palette. I also thought it would be fun to do sports themed and holiday inspired makeup looks. I&#x27;ll use these shadows for Halloween and other events when face painting is appropriate. However, I won&#x27;t use these shadows on my eyes, because they&#x27;re low quality and may contain harmful ingredients.</li>
    <li> I love the bright crazy colors!! It&#x27;s so mich fun to mess with and go a little crazy. :) there were a few of broken ones which sucks,but still tons of fun.</li>
    <li> Love this, every color, very bright and stays on alll day with eyeshadow base. want to order another bc i use it so much.</li>
    <li> Bright colors, good staying power and a good variety. The individual pand of color are on the small side (compared to BH Cosmetics and Coastal Scents) but are highly pigmented, and good for learning with.</li>
    <li> If ur looking for a color palette that&#x27;s vibrant n color this one is it...the shadow goes on ur eyelids just as vibrant as it looks n the case...</li>
    <li> I really love all the colors and how smooth it feels. The colors are bright and beautiful. The package is nicely tight, and secure. Only one blue was powder from delivery though, it still useable and the delivery was fast. I will keep buying this product for myself and as gifts to my family and friends.</li>
    <li> Very bold and vivid colors.  Colors have the matte and shimmery colors of most options. Does not have chalky or extra &amp;#34;whiteness&amp;#34; look in them.  With medium African American skin, colors show up beautifully.  Ordered on Monday.  Arrived on Wednesday. Wore it on Thursday....Compliments on Thursday.  I will definitely be looking into addition FASH products.</li>
    <li> This needs a primer or it don&#x27;t last for long. Not to happy that the colors flake apart. You end up wasting a lot due to this.</li>
    <li> I really love my FASH eye shadow palette. I was recommended to use it from a \\&quot;Peacock eye shadow\\&quot; tutorial and I&#x27;ve been using it ever since. I was real hesitant about it at first, because I&#x27;m not a makeup type of girl and I&#x27;ve never heard of FASH; but it&#x27;s actually a good brand with a variety of colors to choose from!</li>
    <li> One color arrived broken, and it made a little bit of a mess. However, I LOVE this eye shadow. Shadow lasts a long time, and goes on quite bright. I couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite purchase in a long time. This is so worth the money. Package very good, nothing broke. Beautiful color, and the price you cant beat it.. I am going to order a few more of these as gift and one for my daughter to keep her out of mines.. I absolutely love it...</li>
    <li> Its ok the pink stains ur eyes thats the only problem</li>
    <li> With a good eye shadow primer these colors pop very strongly. Use this for photo shoot make up and it reads extremely well on camera as well as stages and runways.</li>
    <li> I have NEVER been more happy with a palette of eyeshadows! This literally has EVERY SINGLE COLOR that will match your outfits!! I absolutely love it. You get SO MUCH with this cheap price. I get compliments all of the time now by my co-workers of how great my eyeshadow looks. I think that&#x27;s mostly in part to the fact that I have so many options to choose from now and can really dress up my eyes with these colors. Excellent quality and I highly recommend it to all of my friends and to you!!</li>
    <li> I got this for around $16 with free shipping, and I have to say that that price is unbeatable!&lt;br /&gt;One of the shadows was cracked and getting messy when I received it, but I believe that is kind of the risk you take when ordering a product like this.  Had I paid the full price for the product, my story would probably be different, but I am not the type to pay $65+ for this type of thing...&lt;br /&gt;(that being said, I think that if you are serious about makeup and makeup quality, I believe that for their original price, there are better quality packaging and make up products on the market.  I wouldn&#x27;t pay more than $20-30 for this one).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The eyeshadows themselves are about the size of a nickel, with a great assortment of bold colors.  They colors are very pigmented, and for the price, I am extremely happy!&lt;br /&gt;I got this palette, to play around with (the first thing I used it for was to add some color to my sugar skill makeup look).&lt;br /&gt;This is definitely a fun product and great for anyone who likes to play around with makeup and bold colors.&lt;br /&gt;I have slightly sensitive skin, and have not had any problems with this product. (but like with any makeup product, remove before sleeping to avoid acne/ premature aging)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(tip: to make the colors bolder and ensure their hue for hours, use an eye-shadow primer! It doesn&#x27;t have to be expensive, I have found several drug store brands I  believe to do the job very well!)</li>
    <li> One eyeshadow was broken but I&#x27;m sure that was USPS fault. I love it :)</li>
    <li> I recieved my product and a lot of the eye shadows were broken and mixed with other colors. I asked for a replacement and was told to send the product back. I don&#x27;t have time for this. I just wanted a new replacement. Not the money back.</li>
    <li> Colors are true and stay on nicely, bought these for my daughter and she loves them! Will gladly purchase more of this brand.</li>
    <li> The colors are bright and stay in place. All the colors are wonderful. I am having a fabulous time creating magic with my eye shadow.</li>
    <li> Well, one of them was a little broken, but that&#x27;s ok. There a little bit bigger than a dime, but very nice!  Great colors!</li>
    <li> The only reason its not a five is because a few were broken but it is no big deal at all! I love them!&lt;br /&gt;This is Eric&#x27;s girlfriend by the way, not him! haha!</li>
