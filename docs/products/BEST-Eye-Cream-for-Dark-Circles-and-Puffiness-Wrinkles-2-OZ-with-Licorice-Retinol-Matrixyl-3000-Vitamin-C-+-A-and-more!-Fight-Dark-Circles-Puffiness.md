      <li>This REALLY WORKS!</li>
      <li>I have tried many of the big name brand creams on my eyes but nothing seemed to work.  </li>
      <li>first glance, I was scared to try this.</li>

      <li>Sometimes if my eyes are irritable or I rub them too much they get puffy.</li>
      <li>so I don&#x27;t need it as much for the wrinkles</li>
      <li>Works fast, and by fast</li>
      <li>and my skin is so much softer.</li>
      <li>Although it says it is for your eyes you can apply it to your whole face.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> After using the eye cream for a few days there are noticeable results for my puffiness and dark circles. It is a nice thick cream that applies nice and evenly. It is more like a lotion rather than a gel. I found that I do not have to apply a lot of the cream under my eyes for it to work either. I really like that it does not leave a sticky feeling like a lot of eye gels do. Although it says it is for your eyes you can apply it to your whole face.</li>
    <li> Okay... so I&#x27;m a mom. Which means, I don&#x27;t sleep. And now Dayslight Savings is thrust upon us all and my toddlers don&#x27;t cope with that... and fussy toddles comes even more lack of sleep. OY! My face and skin has never taken such a beating! I really though I would look like a zombie for the rest of my life lol, hey maybe I could be an extra on The Walking Dead? But no. I tried this stuff out after we were staying at my in-law&#x27;s for awhile, since my mother in law had a free tube and it was amazing! My skin felt so smooth and by the end of our stay (a weekish) I looked radiant and even without a full 8 hour sleep (I&#x27;m lucky if I get 4 hours in a row! Yikes!) I looked like a hundred bucks! What&#x27;s even better is that a little of this stuff goes a LONG way. It makes me feel so much better knowing I can just dab some of this on my face and under my eyes and I&#x27;ll look a heck of lot better than when I just woke up. LOL. I think all the moms at the playgroup will ask what my secret is. I&#x27;m not sure if I should tell them. Ha! Try this and you will feel so refreshed and your eyes will pop. This is now my go-to beauty cream. :)</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this eye cream! I had really dark circles and puffiness, and after a few days of using this cream, I noticed a huge difference. I can&#x27;t wait to see what the results are a few weeks from now! Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Dark circles have been the bane of my existence for some time now. Along with the seemingly permanent dark circles, I have had wrinkles all around my eyes and also my eyes were looking puffy all the time. I&#x27;ve tried so many creams and treatments in order to fix this problem and to help my eyes look younger and fresher, but nothing really seemed to work. Thankfully, a friend recommended this Puressant Eye Cream, and it&#x27;s worked incredibly. I really couldn&#x27;t be much happier. I&#x27;ve noticed a huge difference in the disappearance of black circles and the puffiness around my eyes, and I feel like my wrinkles are receding slowly but surely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At first glance, I was scared to try this. The licorice scared me. I had never heard of licorice being put into an eye cream, but it must work! Along with all the other vitamins and minerals in this product, a lot of things are working, actually. A huge pet peeve of mine is when you start using a product, and you don&#x27;t see immediate results. I just don&#x27;t like waiting around hoping for change, because I&#x27;ve found that often, nothing changes even with time. With this, that wasn&#x27;t the case. I started noticing my eyes looking brighter and less puffy within just days. Days! What more could you ask for?!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as my wrinkles, I understand that that will take more time to fix. But in the two months I&#x27;ve been using this, I&#x27;ve definitely been seeing gradual results. My hope is that in a few more months, my crow&#x27;s feet will be all gone. Fingers crossed. And even if the wrinkles aren&#x27;t completely gone, my expectations have still been completely blown away as far as this eye cream goes. If you are looking for something to help your eyes, you simply must try this.</li>
    <li> This cream does a good job of controlling eye puffiness.  My eyes usually gets puffy in the morning and before using this cream.  I use to massage my face with cold water to control the puffiness but cold water in the winter isn&#x27;t as comfortable as in the warmer seasons so this cream comes in very useful.  I&#x27;m still fairly young so I don&#x27;t need it as much for the wrinkles but I guess it&#x27;s good to use it as a preemptive cream.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my sister and she hasn&#x27;t stopped raving about it. Allergies or just the way the wind blows seem to make her eyes and face puff up and this cream did wonders. Not only that, it has made her crows feet less visible. I am 12 years younger than her and she is looking 10 years younger than me!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great products as usual!</li>
    <li> Amazing eye cream! I use it every morning and it simply really helps remove the bags under my eyes if I don&#x27;t manage to get enough sleep. Sometimes if my eyes are irritable or I rub them too much they get puffy. But I simply use this eye cream by Puressant and soon after the puffiness is gone. I love how it uses all natural ingredients that have been proven to be good for the skin around your eye! I highly recommend this product to anyone looking for a decent eye cream.</li>
    <li> This eye cream is amazing.  I have spent a great deal of time and money looking for a good quality eye cream that actually works.  A friend told me about this product and decided to give it a try as my friend has the most beautiful eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The package arrived on time and I saw fantastic results only after a few uses.  This product is amazing and will be a main stay in my beauty routine.</li>
    <li> My wife was annoyed with dark circles under her eyes and she was ready to spend few hundred dollars on an expensive cosmetic product. Then I decided to purchase this Eye Cream with Licorice to her because it has delivered positive results to one of my colleagues. My wife got the opportunity to get rid of wrinkles under her eyes within a short period of time. She is highly impressed with the results. I was able to save a lot of money thanks to this cream. I can recommend it to anyone!</li>
    <li> This cream contains a unique blend of ingredients that is sure to help the appearance of dark circles under the eyes, fine lines, and wrinkles.  I use eye cream daily to treat and prevent dark circles and puffiness that occur due to my irregular sleep patterns.  Being busy and not getting enough sleep can sometimes show on my face.  Using this eye cream is a great way to combat and prevent that from happening.  The blend of these high quality natural moisturizers, antioxidants, and powerful rejuvenating ingredients is impossible to pass up at this price point.  What a great eye cream for daily use.</li>
    <li> I think that the puffiness got worse within days. So i am back to using my old product that now i think works.</li>
    <li> I never understood how much time, energy, and money woman spend on beauty and skin care products until I started living with me girlfriend. She started complaining about dark spots under her eyes and trying different creams and treatments that didn&#x27;t work. I&#x27;m big on researching and asking other for their recommendations. So I bought this eye cream for her to try and so far so good. I don&#x27;t see the dark spots she talks about but that&#x27;s ok, if she does I want her to be able to do something about about if it makes her happy.    She uses it as a night cream and has been very pleased with the results so far.</li>
    <li> My job requires me to work several late nights a week and every time I do work late I get a lot of puffiness and dark circles around my eyes.  This got much worse when I turned 40.  I have tried many of the big name brand creams on my eyes but nothing seemed to work.  I have had a lot of good results with other Puressant products so I decided to give their eye cream a try.  As soon as I applied it my eyes felt cooler and more relaxed.  After a few hours all of the puffiness and dark circles disappeared.  This stuff is amazing!</li>
    <li> This eye cream felt like an expensive moisturizer did not help with anything</li>
    <li> Excellent, work good for the puffiness eye Thanks</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure why the reviews are so high. Maybe Influenster used this as a giveaway. I wish I hadn&#x27;t wasted the money. It&#x27;s super thin and my eyes now look like I  haven&#x27;t been using anything! if u hav wrinkles around your eyes and you have an eye cream that works, don&#x27;t try this!</li>
    <li> The seller provided this product to me at a discount in exchange for my 100% unbiased opinion and review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Puressant knocked it our of the park with their eye cream for dark circles and puffiness. When I wake up in the morning I usually have puffy eyes due to sinus and allergies. I&#x27;m of a nationality that naturally has dark circles under their eyes. The eye cream has made a huge difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I put the Puressant eye cream on directly after cleansing and toning my face each evening. I smooth a bit all around my eye.This is of such a high quality you only need a little bit, and the jar is so large you it will last awhile. They are not skimpy compared to the &amp;#34;high end&amp;#34; department store creams. And, in all honesty and UNBIASED opinion, much better, more effective and less expensive. After applying the eye cream I use my nightly moisturizer and serum&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I noticed immediately that the dark circles under my eyes start to lessen in the intensity. They were quite dark so if your dark circles aren&#x27;t quite as bad as mine it may take a bit longer to notice a difference. As far as puffiness, I do need to use the eye cream in the morning too as my eyes still get slightly puffy but this is not a reflection on the Puressant eye creams ability to reduce puffiness, it is due to my allergies and sinus problems. But once I get it on, I see the puffiness reduce within minutes and then I apply my regular daily moisturizer and serum.</li>
    <li> no difference in eye puffiness at all.  Wouldn&#x27;t buy this again.</li>
    <li> Really works! ! Smells good.</li>
    <li> This is a great eye cream I like that you can use it daily in the morning and night it helps get rid of wrinkles and inflammation and irritation. It also makes your skin smooth and soft and I did not have any bad reaction to it. I received this product at a discount in exchange for a review.</li>
    <li> Eye Cream is great. After a few uses the dark circles under my mom&#x27;s eyes have started fading. She absolutely likes it. Doesn&#x27;t have a bad odor and is creamy and smooth upon applying. She said it also made the skin under her eyes soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product at a discount in exchange for my unbiased review.</li>
    <li> I received this item at a discounted price for my honest review.&lt;br /&gt;I suffer from puffy eyes, and dark circles because of the lack of sleep. I will not say this cures it or makes it go away in 5 minutes, but with a routine use of this, you will see that it does help. There is no bad smell, no oiliness, and it is not heavy at all. It did not irritate my eyes, or skin, and did not make me feel like the skin was dirty. This is a great thing to add to your daily routine for remaining young looking.</li>
    <li> I purchased this cream to help with under-eye puffiness.  My research has revealed that puffiness is very difficult to treat and that topical aids likely just temporarily relieve inflammation rather than prevent it altogether.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With that said, I was disappointed with this cream.  Though it is lightweight and non-greasy, it has a strange smell that, while not gross, is not pleasant either.  It is a good, basic moisturizer but does little for puffiness.  I&#x27;ve used a sample of Claudie firming serum and that has had a better effect; however, it is pricey.  For the price of this product however, you get a large amount.  It also has a nice cooling effect which I like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a decent basic eye cream for the purposes of moisturizing but sadly, I don&#x27;t feel it is helpful with what it claims.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t  work for my eye bags</li>
    <li> So so. Didn&#x27;t help with dark circles &amp; only made the puffiness a tad smaller.</li>
    <li> Perfect eye cream. It did not irriate my sensitive skin at all. I rececived this to review.</li>
    <li> Love it have has dark circles around my eyes for years. I felt like the penguin from batman.. I have finally found something that makes it go away! Well at least drastically reduced them! I strongly recommended this to anyone who would like to have some relief from dark circles thanks again for a great product!</li>
    <li> This stuff works great. I work really long hours in front of a bright computer monitor and I&#x27;ve suffered from dark circles under my eyes, but this stuff really helps. I&#x27;m impressed.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed a difference as of yet.  I&#x27;ve only been using it for 3 weeks.</li>
    <li> Feels cool and light on my under eyes. I think it is helping my under eye puffiness diminish.</li>
    <li> Puffy eyes have been the bane of my existence. Can&#x27;t get them away with everything I tried until this cream. It definitely lessened the amount of puffiness in my eyes and made a noticeable difference to my family after using it. Makes me feel a lot more confident in the morning when I wake up and look so much better after this cream. Definitely recommend you take a look!</li>
    <li> It smells good and it does what it says it can do.  Just check out all the reviews for it, all these folks can&#x27;t be wrong.</li>
    <li> Best birthday present I&#x27;ve gotten in years.&lt;br /&gt;Okay, so I Have fairly light skin, and I&#x27;m a graphics designer, this equals to annoying puffiness and dark circles around my eyes. Seriously, I had two flapping lips under my eyes. My mom (God bless her) ordered me this product because I looked like a &amp;#34;zombie on crack&amp;#34;. I haven&#x27;t stopped using it up until yesterday when I ran out. I absolutely love this eye cream. Works fast, and by fast I mean, give it a few days to work its magic. It completely removed the puffiness and minimized the dark circles by 70% (granted, I still stay up late and in front of my computer so this might work better on other people)&lt;br /&gt;This goes out to Puressant, thank you. I think maybe selling this in bulk would my only request.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t really gotten a lot of sleep at night lately due to my two year old going though a &#x27;monsters&#x27; stage at night, so you can imagine the bags that I get under my eyes. I don&#x27;t wear makeup so it never gets covered up, therefore I am always looking more exhausted than I really am. A friend gave me a container of this and I was skeptical. The cream isn&#x27;t greasy at all - which I was expecting. I put on a little around my eyes before I went go sleep. After a few days, the dark bags were almost done, and my crows feet were even starting to thin out! I can&#x27;t wait to see what else this does to my face :)</li>
    <li> As a college student who works part time, participates in plenty of extracurricular activities, and is taking 21 credits hours, it is safe to say that I do not get much sleep. Recently, I&#x27;ve noticed heavy dark spots and wrinkles around my eyes. Normally I wouldn&#x27;t pay them any attention, but as of late they have become increasingly noticeable and I knew I had to find a way to fix them.&lt;br /&gt;I have never tried eye creams before, so I had no idea where to start when searching for the an eye cream that was right for me. I came across Puressant&#x27;s Eye Cream and bought it based on the premise that it worked for all skin types and it has done wonders for me. As a dark skin person it&#x27;s not always easy to find products that work as well as this one. After about a week of daily applications I noticed a reduction in my dark circles and that my wrinkles were not as defined as they were before.&lt;br /&gt;Highly Recommended</li>
    <li> Awesome eye cream! Helps with wrinkles AND dark circles. Great sent too. Will definitely buy again!</li>
    <li> I have always had dark circles under my eyes and I was afraid that wrinkles would soon follow. I bought this product for the quality and price and I found that after trying it, the circles under my eyes are not as dark. They are not disappearing right away, which I did not expect them too, but this product is helping them go and my skin is so much softer. I really love this and will be buying another one!</li>
    <li> I have the worst dark circles ever so getting to try this product at a discount was awesome. Needless to say, I was super excited. I tried it out for 2 weeks so far though and not much has happened. I still have dark circles under my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the plus side, it seems like a decent, light weight moisturizer. It kind of has an odd smell to it like a lighter scent of Noxzema  but it wears off quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a discount on this item for my honest opinion.</li>
    <li> I was offered this Eye Cream from Puressant for a great deal to try and share my honest opinion about it. I ordeed one because I have woken up many mny mornings with puffy, swollen, dark circles, so I know that this can help. It arrived and it says that there is Licorice, Vitamin C, Retinol and Matrixyl in it.  So I have applied it in the evening after I&#x27;ve showered and love the results I&#x27;m having. The dark circles have become less noticable and they are definitely less puffy. I would say to try this Eye Cream from Puressant for your eyes and enjoy.</li>
    <li> This is just what mama needed.  It gives me life!  My bags and wrinkles under my eyes are almost unnoticeable.  I have been using this for about 8 weeks now, so you have to give it some time.  I really am glad I did because I was desperate for something.  This REALLY WORKS!</li>
    <li> Purchased this eye cream as a birthday gift for my mother and she loves it!! It is an alternative to placing cucumbers on the eyes which could cause possible stinging. My mother dark circles were gone within days of using it. She plans to stock up on this eye cream.</li>
    <li> I have been tying to be more conscious about my skin care, particularly because I have been noticing circles under my eyes and I&#x27;m hitting that age when I have to be careful about wrinkles.  I have very sensitive skin and this cream works very well for me.  The dark circles and puffiness is visibly less.  I&#x27;m happy I found this eye cream.</li>
    <li> This is an outstanding product. It really takes care of those nasty dark circles that can make me look like a raccoon. It also softens fine lines around the eyes and just generally gives me a more refreshed look.</li>
    <li> I used this eye cream every day for a month and it thinned the skin around my eyes. Eye brow waxing became very painful.</li>
    <li> I have absolutely horrible seasonal allergies which leave me with significant puffiness in my eye area that usually nothing can erase - until I found this!  I noticed a difference the very first day I used this and by the end of the week the puffiness was gone!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cream is very easy to apply and melts into the skin beautifully and does not leave behind any residue.  I love that I can apply it both in the morning and at night as well.  When I apply it in the morning it takes almost no time to absorb thoroughly so I can apply my makeup right away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This excellent product now has a permanent place in my beauty regimen and I highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> For several years now I have had a real hard time concealing the dark areas and bags under my eyes. It didn’t make any difference what makeup I used, they were still visible. This made me look older than I really am, and I hated it. I recently tried Puressant eye cream and within a few days I could already see a huge difference. I’ve tried other products in the past and have had no luck and typically ended up throwing them away. While I’m not sure what makes it work so well, I’m really glad I tried this eye cream.</li>
    <li> I just started using this product. So far so good. i am seeing results with the dark circle and puffiness.&lt;br /&gt;i will update my review when i have used it for some time.</li>
