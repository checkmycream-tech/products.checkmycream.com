      <li>but it&#x27;s the next best thing.  </li>
      <li>but I am more than satisfied.</li>
      <li>I had researched and found that most people suffer with itchy scalp and dandruff for years.</li>
      <li>After about a week I noticed a 90% reduction in dandruff :)</li>
      <li>I knew there had to be something more sustainable.  </li>
      <li>So I gave it a couple more days and nothing.</li>
      <li>For many years I have suffered from dandruff/dry scalp.</li>

      <li>So glad I tried it.  </li>
      <li>I no longer suffer from dandruff and have decided to stop perming my hair to promote healthy hair and scalp.</li>
      <li>I hope the company puts money into redesigning their labels and putting this into more stores.</li>
      <li>Seems to work better than RX shampoo alone.</li>
      <li>I tried this cream in hopes that it would let me use my favorite shampoo and control my dandruff.</li>
      <li>i had been dealing with dandruff for several years, but once i tried this product somethiing wonderful happened to me.</li>
      <li>you put it on your scalp for around 5 minutes in the shower before shampooing, it seems to work better.  </li>
      <li>It smells OK, and does seem to help.</li>
      <li>This product definitely did an awesome job with my hair.  </li>
      <li>:)</li>
      <li>That&#x27;s what matters the most to me.</li>

      <li>I love it.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This product really works after trying just about everything on the market to stop my mild dry scalp or dandruff nothing seemed to work, I ended up washing my hair every week to avoid the flakes but even that didn&#x27;t help as by mid week they start to appear, I was told about it from a friend and how it really worked and I decided to give it a try and from the first use I noticed after a week there was little to no flakes, I use it after every wash and I have no dry scalp at all. Try it it really works.</li>
    <li> Seems to work better than RX shampoo alone. leaves a little oily residue in hair, but can be toweled out.</li>
    <li> Stopitt worked great for me. Stopped itching and flaking within a few days of regular use . Can&#x27;t say everyone will have the same results but I am more than satisfied.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m so glad i was able to find it on amazon.&lt;br /&gt;Not easy to find where i live. This jar lasts can last 1 year.&lt;br /&gt;I love it since and it works well with my natural hair.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t stop my dandruff. No instructions sent with this product that tell how to use it.</li>
    <li> It works but the smell is very potent.</li>
    <li> I have been using is product for years and its worked every time. E important thing to remember is wash and dry your hair and en apply to scalp. It smells like baby powder and has a good texture to it. It doesn&#x27;t make your hair greasy and doesn&#x27;t allow dirt to build up so soon after washing. I&#x27;ve even given it to my sister to use and she loves it too. Great product.</li>
    <li> I did purchase this product because of dandruff both my daughter and I have, which I think it does stop dandruff to a certain extent, but my only complaint is that it does not dissolve that easily on the scalp.  You really have to rub it in so you don&#x27;t have traces of white cream on your scalp.</li>
    <li> I did not purchase this product on amazon, but i used it for quite some time while I was growing my hair. Simply put, the product does as it says. I have extremely dry scalp and it flaked very quickly after shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;  I used both the shampoo and this hair treatment. It is in a jar but has the look and texture of lotion. I love the tingly feeling after application which is so soothing on the scalp. At first when I used it I was a little concerned about the white residue, but it is absorb though, so as long as you dont over apply it wont be a problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, If you suffer from dry, flaky, itchy scalp, this product should work just great for you. Also try the shampoo.</li>
    <li> this cream is the best thing that happened to me.before i used to itch my hair so much because of dandruffs that i hurt my scalp.after my dad bought this product,i haven&#x27;t even itched my scalp for a few days.if you have an extreme case of dandruffs,then this product will surely work for you</li>
    <li> Omg! This product deserves an Oscar, Grammy, Emmy, and every outstanding award out there. I suffered from excessive dandruff for 16 years  and I tried this product with doubt&#x27;s about its effectiveness. Prior to using this product, i had scabs, bleeding, huge flakes, molds and the most disgusting dandruff stuff. I would wash my hair and still see the scabs still there, even hours after washing and shampooing my hair. It made me self conscious when i was around people. I even contemplated cutting off my hair and going bald to stop the infestation of dandruff on my head, until i heard about this product.From the onset of using this product, I saw major changes. Now am dandruff free!!! I employ y&#x27;all to use this product. Please!</li>
    <li> This product really works; I really had bad dandruff and when I started using this product I hardly see them anymore. The trick is to use it after you wash your hair.</li>
    <li> Head and Shoulders Shampoo wasn&#x27;t enough.  This really took care of my dandruff problem. I only need to use it once week.</li>
    <li> This didn&#x27;t do anything for me. I honestly think it made the problem worse so I stopped using after 3 times. Also, not a fan of the strong medicated smell.</li>
    <li> Right on time. Product is as advertised.</li>
    <li> I Have used this product for a while now and it works. Of all the other products on the market this was the best. Dont expect it to cure your itchy scalp it just reduces the itching significantly.</li>
    <li> love the product and the speedy shipping. will be ordering more soon.</li>
    <li> I found that it was a good product. Just as it said in the add. I will buy it as gift</li>
    <li> I was a bit skeptical about buying ha air products especially dealing with this particular problem but I went ahead and bought and what a great product. It has succeeded where hair and shoulders and selsum blue have failed. Wash your hair. Dry it out well and apply overnight... presto! Stopped my flakes fairly quickly and leaves your hair smelling wonderfully in the process! Would def recommend</li>
    <li> If you have psoriasis it works, on itchy, tight, dry scalps, and on braids. It cured my allergic reaction to braids resulting in a big chop. I would recommend!! Try it!</li>
    <li> My 1st review ever on amazon. Tried this product based on other reviews. This is wonderful product &amp; one application was enough for me to understand why.&lt;br /&gt;I think i need to use it only once a month as it is very very effective</li>
    <li> i had been dealing with dandruff for several years, but once i tried this product somethiing wonderful happened to me. the dandruff is almost gone!!! i had tried different products before and none of then worked, but this one does what it says it does. if you want better results apply it the same day you washed your hair, because if you do it days later the dandruff is going to appear and the results wont be the same. and just apply a very very little amount because if you put a big amount your scalp can get greasy. what i do is,  i just put a ittle bit on my fingertips and masage my scalp with it 3 times a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;when i saw this product i wasnt that confident about it but due to the great reviews it has i decided to give it a try and that was magnific. maybe you should do the same</li>
    <li> I have suffered with itchy, flakey scalp for many years and have tried many different products. I can honestly say STOPITT is the ONLY product that truly helps my scalp. Not even the products that were prescribed by my dermatologist work this well. I would strongly recommend Stopitt to anyone with a similar problem.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for 13 years. A hairdresser in Brooklyn, NY told me about it since I always had a dry flaky scalp.  My hair was so dry that after only 2 days after I washed it the flakes were all over looking like it was snowing.  Ever since I&#x27;ve used Stopitt both the shampoo and the \\&quot;grease\\&quot; I haven&#x27;t seen a flake yet.  A few years ago I attempted to use a substitute since the state I moved in did not carry it, trust me that was a huge mistake! Ever since that fiasco I now order it online, haven&#x27;t from Amazon, but from other sources and I usually order batches; it&#x27;s the only thing that works. After a wash and dry use the \\&quot;grease\\&quot; on your scalp, this only needs to be done once a week, and voila your done! No more more flakes, or itchy scalp.  This product is AMAZING and I hope it&#x27;s never discontinued!</li>
    <li> Being troubled with this common problem ended when I tried this dressing.  Very little is needed for me as my hair is cut right down to less than a crew cut.  Dry scalp, itching and flakes were still an issue.  I had been using some Porters Oil mixed with Thayers Unscented with aloe Witch Hazel and now I continue to use both, wetting my scalp with the Thayers and then applying a dab of Stoppit and massage into the scalp.  Once or twice a week is all it seems to take and problem solved.</li>
    <li> I am a hairstylist and had a customer that had severe dandruff. .ive tried several products that gave unfavorable results. I decided to try Stop it after 2 deep treatments the dandruff was completely gone...I washed the hair with stop it Shampoo let the customer sit under the hairdryer with a plastic cap, rinsed the shampoo out then put the stop it cream on the scalp and let the customer sit under dryer w/o a plastic cap for 20 min..dont rinse the cream out...</li>
    <li> I ordered this product based on the recommendation of my daughter&#x27;s beautician.  My daughter has alopecia and a very dry scalp.  I ordered this product and started using it on my daughter&#x27;s scalp.  I could see immediate results in that the product (when used daily) eliminated the dryness in her scalp and made her hair look healthier.  My husband also suffers from a dry scalp and he started using this product when he noticed the difference in my daughter&#x27;s hair.  Although I don&#x27;t have a dry scalp, I also use the product on my hair and I love it.</li>
    <li> Great product! This product has worked wonders on my sculp and now I am dandruff free.I have recommended Stopitt to friends.</li>
    <li> I rarely write reviews unless a product truly wows me or disappoints me -- and this one definitely wow&#x27;ed me!! In one use the dandruff I&#x27;ve been struggling to get rid of for almost two years completely went away. I still don&#x27;t believe it - I keep checking my scalp in the mirror -- and it&#x27;s totally clear! No idea how dermatogolist Rx couldn&#x27;t fix what one use of this stuff could!! If you&#x27;ve been dealing with dandruff I would definitely say give this a shot. I used it on slightly damp hair in the evening and worked it in w a scalp brush...kept it in overnight and showered when I woke up. Like magic, was all clear when I got out of shower!!</li>
    <li> This is an amazing product. I purchased this product for my daughter after a number of attempts to get rid of the dandruff using a number of anti-dandruff shampoos. The shampoos did not work at all. Stopitt got rid off the dandruff completely in about 4 days of continuous use. The only down side to this product is that it is very thick and can leave white patches on the hair during the treatment if you are not careful. But as long as it treats dandruff who am I to complain? It does the job very well. That&#x27;s what matters the most to me.</li>
    <li> I would not purchase this product again.  First the product arrived with a broken top so some of it was spilled out on my other items I ordered.  I was desperate to try it anyway so I gave it a go.  This was for my son who has eczema and certain times of the year it effects his scalp.  Some dermatologists say it is eczema, some say common dandruff on steroids.  Anyway, This stuff is very greasy.  Not just greasy but super thick.  My son has straight, thin curly African American hair.  We used it at night and washed it out in the morning.  I didn&#x27;t see any difference and we followed this routine for two weeks.</li>
    <li> so far so good, I have been using this product for a few weeks now and so far I really seem to like it!</li>
    <li> I have had dandruff since I was 13 and now I&#x27;m 31. Nothing I tried helped and it was really bad. I used medicating shampoos as well as natural remedies (tea tree oil, witch hazel, vinegar etc.) I randomly came across this and thought since it was so cheap that I should give it a try. It really helps. I wouldn&#x27;t say that it totally cures my dandruff but it is 80% better than it was before.&lt;br /&gt;I do not use it like the directions say. The directions want you to apply it after a shower and leave it on (sort of like a leave in conditioner), the only thing is that the product has the consistency of a creamy white hand cream. I could never leave this on my hair because it looks white and oily. Anyway, I use it as a scalp treatment. I section off my hair and apply it all over my scalp and massage in. I leave it on for a few hours and then wash out with my normal shampoo. I also use it to spot treat certain areas in between washes. This stuff is worth the $11.</li>
    <li> Someone introduced me to this product years ago and I cannot do without it! I have Seborrheic Dermatitis and this product works wonders for me. It keeps my scalp flake and itch free. For best results I wash my hair every 4 or 5 days and use the Stoppitt about twice a week. If I put a generous amount on my scalp before a relaxer I rarely get burns. Great product! Love it!</li>
    <li> So it felt like lotion I was putting on my scalp, but then it didn&#x27;t work, so my hair got all nasty and greasy for nothing.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t even know if this works well like it&#x27;s supposed to. I can&#x27;t put this on because the smell is horrid. It smells like old lady perfume. I just bought a scalp massager and use it every time I wash my hair and it works very well.</li>
    <li> I bought everything on the market for dandruff, but this product relieves the itch immediately and it lasts all day. I use it in combination with a copper brush. Most use it three times a week, but I use it almost everyday. I have been suffering for three years with the itch and flakes. This stuff works!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update- I have shoulder length hair and about three years ago I developed a really bad case of dandruff due to stress at my previous job. I bought every shampoo and every anti-itch medicine on the market.  Nothing really worked. I had researched and found that most people suffer with itchy scalp and dandruff for years. I color and weave my hair. I use a blow dryer and flat iron everyday, and I was not about to go without using hair products.  I saw this product on Amazon after someone at work recommended a copper brush-yes it was that bad! I use this every day after I wash my hair. I put it on my lower scalp before I put on my conditioner. I rinse my hair. NO more itch! No more flakes and I wear black shirts again!!!!!!!!!!! This is the best product out there and I know I&#x27;ve tried everything for three years! I also recommend the Goody copper brush sold on Amazon. Both together solved my problem!</li>
    <li> The stuff works! All the ratings and reviews are true. Was a little bit skeptical going in but this has worked like nothing else I tried. Not even sensa blue dandruff shampoos.</li>
    <li> This stuff works when nothing else does. So glad I tried it.  I don&#x27;t have to use dandruff shampoo anymore which is better for my hair.  Plus I feel like this stuff is actually good for my hair which is pretty short so it inevitably gets in my hair when I apply it to my scalp.  It has a refreshing cooling feeling for a few minutes after applying which I like.</li>
    <li> I have heavy dandruff, and this gives instant relief from the itch. And it smells nice but Its a little greasy so cant use it when you go out.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t realize how messy and heavy the product was. It&#x27;s extremely creamy and hard to apply evenly on the scalp. I have a lot of hair so it was difficult and time consuming to get this product throughout my scalp. Plus it didn&#x27;t really worked for me granted I only used it two times before I gave up in frustration.</li>
    <li> Came on time as was what it was advertised to be. Good for the purpose it was purchased for. Would recommend it.</li>
    <li> Worked within the first week - after years of futzing around with anti-dandruff shampoos. Mildly greasy, smells like cheap scented cream - but effective even if you wash it out in the morning.</li>
    <li> I ordered the products (shampoo and the hair &amp; scalp treatment) for my daughter as recommended by our hair salon professional.  My daughter did not have the typical dandruff, she had some other type of dry scalp condition that produced very large flakes. It was almost like her scalp was continuously shedding.  We are very pleased with the results and I would recommend this product to anyone that has flaking and have tried everything with no success.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve struggled with dandruff for years.  It&#x27;s embarrassing to write about it, but the fact remains that my dandruff is awful, and nothing I&#x27;ve found has seemed to cure it.  I have tried almost every product out there: medicated shampoos of all types and all major brands, creams, natural remedies (like apple cider vinegar and tea tree oil), not washing my hair for extended periods of time, and nothing seemed to work.  If I googled &#x27;dandruff cure,&#x27; or anything similar, all of the top links had been visited.  Multiple times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing that came close was a special steroid cream that I got from a dermatologist, but that had run out, and I didn&#x27;t want to pay exorbitant amounts of money to see my dermatologist and get a prescription.  I knew there had to be something more sustainable.  On a whim while I was especially frustrated, I searched for dandruff products that Amazon offered that I might have been missing, and Stopitt appeared.  I figured that I had tried most everything else, and bought it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Stopitt is a cream.  Kind of like a lotion, but a bit stickier/thicker than that.  After I showered and was getting ready for bed, I took a good sized dollop, about as much shampoo as I would normally use (nickel sized?) and massaged it into my scalp.  Immediately, I felt a sense of relief, as there was a cooling sensation on my scalp.  The next morning, I looked at my pillow, expecting to see the usual mess of flakes and that nasty stuff, but my pillow was clean.  Throughout the day, I kept purposefully scratching my head to see what would happen, and there were no flakes!  I was amazed.  This worked better than the prescription cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At this point, I use Stopitt about every third day.  Roughly 2-3 times a week.  And my dandruff has disappeared.  I apply it at night, after I&#x27;ve showered (damp hair).  It doesn&#x27;t spread well with dry hair, and nor do I feel like having it in my hair during the day.  At this point, Stopitt has become a necessary item in my medicine cabinet.sary item in my medicine cabinet.</li>
    <li> This product definitely works. After the 4th use I couldn&#x27;t see any trace of dandruff and the itching stopped.</li>
    <li> I initially used this products every night for several days.  After several months of intermittent use, I would say I now use it 1 to 2 times a month, and it works well without being harsh on my hair.  In fact, I would call it very gentle.  I think it makes my hair shiny, too.  And I really like the smell.  I rub it into the scalp before bedtime and wash out in the morning.  I am very pleased with the results!!  I also use Sage shampoo, and occasionally a tea tree conditioner.  No more itchy scalp and embarressing flakes!!</li>
    <li> Oh well, live and learn.  I tried this and I can see that it might work for some people, but it didn&#x27;t for me.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a little non plused about Stopitt. It says that you&#x27;re supposed to put it into your dry hair like a normal hair product. Unless you&#x27;re planing on solely using it at night be prepared to look extra greasy. I used a anti dandruff shampoo instead, works great.</li>
    <li> This product works very well and is very effective. It does exactly what the label says. I will continue to use this product</li>
    <li> I was...I mean, uh, my friend...has struggled with dandruff off and on for years and this product pretty much killed it.  Just put it on after a shower, a small amount goes a long way.  Damp hair helps it spread around easier.  I, uh, I mean my friend, generally keeps his hair really short (clippers, no guard) so there&#x27;s no issues with it greasing up his hair.  I think for people with longer hair, a good technique might be to shower, apply the product, and once it is rubbed into the scalp you should be able to rinse any remaining product out and style like you normally would.  This might sound like a hassle to rinse hair twice, but this stuff really does what it says it does so i think a little extra step is worth it if you&#x27;re serious about stopping the problem.</li>
    <li> works like magic, even better than topbrass which I cannot seem to find anymore (at least at a reasonable price)</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t believe this works so well!!  I am SUPER experienced w/anti-dandruff treatments.  I&#x27;ve been experimenting w/them for years.  First of all, this stuff feels amazingly natural compared to other anti-dandruff products. There was no harsh chemical smell... It didn&#x27;t set my scalp on fire. I thought, &amp;#34;This stuff can&#x27;t do anything, it feels like body butter.&amp;#34; lol  But sure enough - after only one treatment- I had basically no symptoms left. After the 2nd treatment I had no traces of dandruff.  I&#x27;m pretty blown-away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(I used a wide-tooth comb in the shower to section off my hair and did my best to cover my entire scalp. I clipped my hair up for probably 10 mins, then rinsed and followed w/my favorite shampoo and conditioner.)  My hair (normally coarse and frizzy) was also super-soft afterwards.  :)</li>
    <li> My head is on fire with this greasy cream on it. I&#x27;m trying to leave it on overnight, sleeping on a towel to hopefully save my pillowcase. Hopefully it works but it&#x27;s very painful.</li>
    <li> Works great. Used it once and I can already see the difference. great product.</li>
    <li> I applied the product as directed before I went to bed. I had to get up in the middle of the night to wash my hair because it irritated my scalp so badly.</li>
    <li> so far I have not had much luck with this product....I bought it because it had good reviews....I will keep using it with the hope it will work.</li>
    <li> I read the reviews of this product and people swore by it how it works. It&#x27;s okay but does not cure.&lt;br /&gt;I literally caked it on the bad areas too. It is nothing to rave about. Does not smell bad like some say.</li>
    <li> Throw away your head and shoulders shampoo and any other fake dandruff fighting creams. Buy this. One container lasts me a year and it does the job. No flakes in sight!</li>
    <li> Highly recommended, i bought all kind of dandruff shampoos and nothing has worked for me, it looks like a cream and i was bit confused how to apply it/used it, however i called the customer service and i was told to apply it after shower and let it soak in and just leave it (don&#x27;t wash you hair after). you need to use it couple times before you see results (i will gave it two weeks at least)</li>
    <li> I have year-round dandruff and have tried all different types of shampoos to help clear the issue up. They usually work ok the first couple days and then stop working. I even tried putting coconut oil on, but that makes your hair way too greasy and wasn&#x27;t as effective for me as others. I used this product about twice a week the first couple weeks and now I only need it every few weeks. It has really helped my situation. Highly recommend if you are suffering with dandruff and have tried other options without luck.</li>
    <li> For many years I have suffered from dandruff/dry scalp. My stylist tried it on my scalp in Nov 2013. I saw results after the first week. I no longer see the flakes on my clothing. My scalp very seldom itches. I&#x27;ve tried many products over the years; however, this is the best. It is non-greasy and doesn&#x27;t weigh your hair down.  It gives the hair a natural shine.</li>
    <li> i would give it 10 stars if i could, always had dandruff issues over the years but since using this product i can actually say it really works,due the white color of this product i add some shea oil to it too help with the spreading on my scalp and that seem to work, you can add any oil you like.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m using this in combination with a sage shampoo and already after only two days I have almost zero flakes. The redness from my scalp disappeared after one use. Hopefully this will continue for all of eternity... but I have my doubts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll revise my review if anything changes. So far I&#x27;m ecstatic!</li>
    <li> Before discovering Stopitt, I tried everything to help my itchy scalp.  The dandruff was bad, but it was the incessant itching that really got to me.  H&amp;S helped marginally, and the more intense products containing selenium sulfide helped just a tad more.  At times I&#x27;d scratch until my scalp was raw, and during social gatherings I&#x27;d have to fight the uncomfortable urge.  Horrible for an outgoing, active guy like myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m so happy I found this on Amazon and read the reviews.  After 2-3 days of use I was a little worried, as I still had some itching left.  Then after a week or so, I noticed the itching gradually disappeared (after nightly use), and never came back.  After so many years of trying everything, I was amazed and definitely very happy.  The product contains methyl paraben -- I&#x27;m not sure how good that is for long-term use, but I still give it 5-stars for its awesome effectiveness where everything else failed.</li>
    <li> Dandruff runs on my dad side of the family and unfortunately I inherited it also. I tried everything on the market (Sulfur 8, Head &amp; Shoulders)  anything and everything anyone recommended. Some worked for 3-4 days or not all. I would comb my hair and it would look like a snowfall. Two years ago my mom&#x27;s hairdresser recommended Stoppit. At first I was skeptical but after the first week and no dandruff, I became a believer. For the first time in 28 years I have something that stopped the dandruff. As one reviewer said the key is applying the cream after you wash your hair. If you have bad dandruff like I did, after a day it&#x27;s too late since the dandruff has already appeared. If you are a skeptic that is okay. Try it - You just might be surprised.</li>
    <li> If I saw this product in stores I wouldn&#x27;t buy it solely because of its looks. But I&#x27;m glad I found it on Amazon thanks to its reviews! It works great! within 2 uses I had no dry scalp which I experience a lot during the winter due to the harsh temperatures where I live. I hope the company puts money into redesigning their labels and putting this into more stores.</li>
    <li> Really worth it. Regular dandruff shampoo did very little for me, but this worked immediately. I applied to the roots of damp hair after washing and worked it in. I&#x27;ve been using it every other time I wash my hair and that seems to be enough.</li>
    <li> You guys don&#x27;t discount if buy in bulk</li>
    <li> Very good product for treatment of dandruff or dry scalp.  In 2 or so weeks you really notice the difference.  Stopitt works.  No more flakes.</li>
    <li> It stoped my itching scalp</li>
    <li> I bought this in the hopes of finally curing my dandruff problem. I&#x27;ve tried most of the shampoos in the stores, but nothing really worked. The flakes would come back as soon as the hair dried. I realized that the only solution left was to get some kind of cream which stays on for awhile. Figured I&#x27;d try this since it was the first one that popped up in search, plus the reviews were really good. Tried it and within a day - no dandruff! It works well as a hair styling product as well so I don&#x27;t need to use any gel. I highly recommend this as the first solution to try before giving up on your hopes of fighting those pesky flakes.</li>
    <li> I was a real skeptic when i first read the reviews because i have been suffering from these pesky dandruff scales since i was a kid. I used dandruff eeze before, which is a similar product but it didnt do the trick. After washing my hair and applying this product at least 3 times a week on my scalp, my dandruff slowly diminished. I no longer suffer from dandruff and have decided to stop perming my hair to promote healthy hair and scalp. I would recommend this product to anyone!</li>
    <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- affordable&lt;br /&gt;- doesn&#x27;t require much use&lt;br /&gt;- instant relief&lt;br /&gt;- smells like baby powder&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- feels like putting dollops of creamy hair gel on your scalp&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thoughts:&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been suffering with dry itchy scalp for years.  OTC shampoos never worked for me. Wherever I feel an itch, I just dab a bit of this shtuff on it and rub it in and the itch goes away! The shorter your hair the easy it is to use. Do yourself a favor and get a brush with ball-tipped bristles and massage this gunk into your scalp. You&#x27;ll thank me for that idea ;)</li>
    <li> This product works wonders!  It does have a bit of a smell, but nothing horrendous.  It will take a few days or maybe even a week or more to see results at first (at least in my case) but the product knocked out my dandruff completely.  I have tried everything under the sun and none of them ever completely eradicated the dandruff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product just works, could not recommend it more!!</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t be fooled this stuff skinks to high heaven. Works pretty good and really wish they did it unscented.&lt;br /&gt;I put this on and after half an hour I couldn&#x27;t take the smell anymore, I couldn&#x27;t breath.</li>
    <li> This product is unbelievable. I have had scalp issues with dryness and flaking for years. I have long thick hair and I have used everything on the market  to no avail. This time of year was always the worst for me but since I started using this I have no problems. I just use this on the parts of my scalp that I need to. I part my hair and rub it on. If you use a small amount it doesn&#x27;t affect your hair texture or style at all.</li>
    <li> I had a severe dandruff and very itchy scalp since a year.i was very fed up. I tried to change my eating habits but couldnt maintain those habits for a long time.i tried applying shampoo twice during bath so that i can get rid of it and get a clear dandruff free scalp. but it still remained after i combed my hair after bath. I tried many anti dandruff shampoos, medicated shampoos and conditioners, medicines till i actually noticed Stopitt. I read amazon customer reviews and decided to give it a try. I applied it only &#x27;once&#x27; ( for the first time since i bought it recently)  to the scalp portion which was itchy. and it worked .today is the 7 th day and the itching is GONE. Thanks to stopitt hope it keeps helping me by giving me positive results each time. i  dont think there is a need to apply it again.&lt;br /&gt;TRY IT i would say. Shampoo your hair. apply it on dry/little damp scalp. let it stay as is until next hair wash.&lt;br /&gt;It gives a oily look after you apply it.</li>
    <li> It smells OK, and does seem to help. I apply it before I shampoo my hair. If I apply it post-shampoo, my hair looks greasy. I still get dandruff, but the amount seems less. I doubt I will buy it again. I think it moisturized my scalp, but I don&#x27;t think it does anything else. It is messy to apply. I make small parts in my hair, and work it into my scalp.</li>
    <li> It works fine, reduces dandruff and takes care of your scalp. But it has weired smell and greasy a little. The container looks really cheap, you expect something finishes with its price. I cautiously recommend it.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t really work as advertised.</li>
    <li> This stuff is awesome. I get dandruff from time to time ( not any more!) and this stuff really works to stop it. It has the added benefit of working almost like a pomade. It leaves my hair looking pretty good, when people say so, I say &amp;#34;thanks, its dandruff medicine.&amp;#34;They think I&#x27;m joking. So I look good and make a funny- I&#x27;ll take it.</li>
    <li> excellent for dandruff</li>
    <li> In the winter as soon as my hair dries (whether I air dry or blow), my scalp starts to flake. I put this on my scalp, feel a little tingle and no more flaking. As a bonus, it makes my hair soft. I am black with relaxed hair.</li>
    <li> it works it does stop the itching</li>
    <li> I developed some pretty heavy dandruff and have struggled to find something effective to treat it for a couple of years. Having tried several popular anti-dandruff shampoos without success I found STOPITT on Amazon and decided to give it a try.  I applied the product to my scalp after showering and shampooing and left it in overnight. I rinsed it out in the morning. Based on some of the reviews here I was planning to use it about once per week.  But my dandruff disappeared completely on the first application. I have never seen a single flake since. My scalp feels completely smooth and clean and literally looks different. Dandruff.... gone.  So what is going on here?  There are apparently 3 different causes of dandruff and the most common of these is fungus. The active ingredient in STOPITT is zinc which is anti-fungal.  Several of the shampoos I tried also employ zinc as their active ingredient but they did not work. It think the reason is the simple topical efficacy that STOPITT achieves by having extended contact with the scalp as a &amp;#34;leave-in&amp;#34; product. The shampoos are just not in contact with your head for a sufficient length of time.  A jar of STOPITT will be kept in our home permanently.</li>
    <li> Really Worked for me (:</li>
    <li> excellent product I am giving 5 stars.  Helps against dandruff</li>
    <li> This product is the best so far. I have tried so many other products and nothing could stop my dandruff for over 2 days but this.</li>
    <li> I highly recommend this product for anyone with a dandruff problem.  It works 100% hands down.  It it light and does not have a horrible smell.  Love, love, love this product!</li>
    <li> Why this product has not yet received the Nobel prize for Dandruff and dry flakes elimination is beyond me! Having spent all of my teens, post college, growing up, midlife and now in my soon to enter 50s - I have had to suffer intense dandruff and dry flakes each and every day of my life. I have spent a &amp;#34;fortune&amp;#34; on all kinds of shampoos, oils, lotions, medications but nothing has worked - a whole industry worth billions of dollars working to remove your dandruff but never have been able to - why are they still in business?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And then by chance I stumbled upon Stopitt a year ago. Bought it based on the reviews. The first two times I applied it before going to bed, I noticed burning and irritation sensation on my neck - I thought it was something in the product and put it aside and for some odd reason did not throw it away. A year later again the pangs of &amp;#34;damn that darn dandruff&amp;#34; grew beyond the tipping point and the search to do something started again for the millionth time. Then I remembered I had this product. I tried this again a year later after having bought it. This time I was careful (a) not to go to bed after applying it, so put this on my scalp in the morning (b) took precautions not to touch my head so as to avoid getting the cream on other parts of my body that could cause the burning sensation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No issues this time. I&#x27;ve applied it 3-4 times on in the past week and have applied NOTHING on my head since then and have been washing my hair everyday. No creams and no oils applied after the shower that I used to, to hide my dandruff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is amazing. Not a single flake found. No a single dandruff found on my balding head, all that precious hair lost to the darn darn-druff.... if only i had found this product years earlier i would have been able to slow down the balding...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Without giving it another second, if you have not used this product. buy it immediately. after 47 years of existence I am for the first time in my life dandruff free.</li>
    <li> Nice cream for dandruff so effective.</li>
    <li> This stuff really soothes scalp and stops itchiness. You definitely get a lot for $12, so its a good value. My only beef with this product is that I have long hair and it can be tricky to apply.</li>
    <li> didn&#x27;t work for me.. However not much has</li>
    <li> Took me years and years trying to get rid of dandruff. That did it in a week.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this for about 3 weeks now.  So far so good.  I do notice lesser flakes but I cannot tell if it&#x27;s due to this product or using steam hydration with my conditioning.  Nonetheless, I&#x27;m going to continue to use.  It&#x27;s very light, creamy, and doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down.  It also has a pleasant light scent.</li>
    <li> It works. This product really works. It does what it says. It should be applied at night because of the fact that its white and it does not go on clear.</li>
    <li> If you suffer from dry scalp and not dandruff or both this is a scalp treatment for you. It is light and soothing.</li>
    <li> I have had dandruff for years...white flakes peppered my clothes and I could not wear any dark clothing lest a snowbank appear on my shoulders. I tried using oils, anti dandruff shampoo, and nothing worked. I did not have high hopes for this initially, as for the first three days of application there was no change. After about a week I noticed a 90% reduction in dandruff :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My advice is to:&lt;br /&gt;Use a small amount, spread it on your fingers, and massage it into your scalp with moist hair&lt;br /&gt;Use daily for 2 weeks to see results&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good luck curing yourself of dandruff!</li>
    <li> It did work for my son!!!</li>
    <li> Ok.. I just received this cream on Sunday, my daughter has always had flakes right after shampoo!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve only used this overnight on her scalp, the next morning.. I think I saw 2 flakes in her hair!!!&lt;br /&gt;I am going to order the shampoo next, I wanted to try out the cream.. I have been searching for a long time for help for her scalp.&lt;br /&gt;She is a teen and this can be very embarrassing!  I will keep using it to see how well it goes, but right now, it looks great!</li>
    <li> I use a shampoo that typically leaves my scalp dry and exacerbates my dandruff but BUT it leaves my hair looking amazing and smooth. So I found myself in a hard place because my normally frizzy hair looked better than ever but it was also full of white flakes. I tried this cream in hopes that it would let me use my favorite shampoo and control my dandruff. IT DID!!! I have since gone through two bottles of this product and still receive great results. Definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> As the title said, it works. I don&#x27;t know what to say more... In my particular case it works great.</li>
    <li> I applied this to my dandruff load scalp and I must say that I feel the difference. No longer am I reaching for my pen/pencil to scratch my scalp.  The smell is lovely too!</li>
    <li> All of a sudden I was starting having the worst dandruff. I don’t know why, so I looked at the reviews and decided to give it a try. I love this product; I bought 3 jars and gave one to my son. I couldn’t believe how quickly it worked. I don’t have any flakes; I used it 3 times a week at first, now just once a week. I will keep this on hand always. Great product!</li>
    <li> I put this on my scalp at night wrap hair or put towel on pillow and shower it out in the morning about 2x a week and I have almost no dandruff anymore. This is the real deal! I suffer from cold weather dandruff and it&#x27;s bad. I tried everything shampoos, oils, vitamins etc nothing worked. It was embarrassing. I took a shot on Stopitt after reading reviews and it&#x27;s been a life changer.</li>
    <li> To begin with, this thing makes my hair look awful.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s also difficult to apply and hasn&#x27;t made any noticeable improvements.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried using it immediately after showering and a day after showering, and it just makes my hair look gross.&lt;br /&gt;Maybe this is because I have oily, straight hair to begin with, but this product is lacking.</li>
    <li> I was glad to find this odorless lightweight creme; nothing was working on my dry itchy flaky scalp. I was making situation worse by over-washing my hair and stripping all of the healthy natural oils from it, but if I didn&#x27;t, in a day or so, I&#x27;d be going nuts with the itching and scratching, not to mention drying out my natural curls. I have a sensitive scalp and was literally scratching sores in my head. The dandruff shampoos were harsh for my color so that wasn&#x27;t ideal. I popped online looking for another item that I&#x27;d used when I lived in a different state &amp; can&#x27;t find here, but it was 3 times the cost of Stopitt so figured I&#x27;d give Stopitt a try. Glad I did. I literally use a little of it once a week and even through several washes (without reapplying) the itching and flaking has stopped. Took about 2 uses for the itching to subside. This is a product that does what it says.</li>
    <li> great stuff.... I am on my sixth jar.</li>
    <li> I have known about this product for over 10 years and was able to only find it in New York.... Since moving to California, I have searched diligently for this product... Thank you for now providing it online... Results can be seen in less than 1 week of using this product.. I have given it to every member of my family and friends who suffer from dandruff...&lt;br /&gt;Believe me when I say it works, It works&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B001T8I108 Stopitt Medicated Anti-Dandruff Hair &amp; Scalp Treatment 4 oz.]]</li>
    <li> When I bought this product I was having difficulty letting my hair grow because of the annoying scales and the itching, Gosh! the itching. I wasn&#x27;t sure whether this product worked but I gave it a try and have absolutely wonderful results, My scalp is clean, no scales, no itching and when I shave I don&#x27;t see the hitherto white patches. Buy it! because it works!</li>
    <li> I have used nearly everything that major companies have spent millions in advertising that simply don&#x27;t work. When used with the Stopitt Shampoo the effects last a lot longer. Over the years my hair has been relaxed, braided, natural, texturized and dry curled. This product has saved my scalp and hair from all sorts of torture I put it thru. Most importantly it works. I have used products that smell like sulfur (so unfair). No one wants to inhale that! But with the Stopitt scalp treatment there is a pleasant smell  that will not offend anyone. I recommend this product line all the time if anyone asks.</li>
    <li> When used as an &amp;#34;after shower&amp;#34; leave-in treatment, it didn&#x27;t seem to help at all.  If (as another reviewer suggested) you put it on your scalp for around 5 minutes in the shower before shampooing, it seems to work better.  So I would suggest not leaving it on the scalp long-term.  Still not sure exactly how effective it is, but seems to lessen flaking a bit.  Results may vary...  Edit:  this edit doesn&#x27;t have anything to do with this product, but I think is important to spread anyway.  Before you spend another dime on another anti-dandruff product, go to the store and grab a cheap bottle of &amp;#34;baby shampoo&amp;#34;.  Yep, baby shampoo.  This worked absolute miracles for me, and I&#x27;m convinced my scalp just couldn&#x27;t take harsh standard shampoos.  Now I use it every day with no other added products and my problem is solved.  I&#x27;m not the only one either.  Do a internet search on baby shampoo and dandruff problems.  Could be the easy and cheap answer you&#x27;ve been looking for!</li>
    <li> Decided to give this a try out of pure desperation. I have dealt with dry itchy scalp for years. Nothing that I have ever tried seemed to work. I have used most of the OTC remedies and some prescription medications over the last decade, but none of these worked for very long. After reading the other reviews, I decided to take a chance on STOPITT. I noticed almost immediate relief from itching and NO MORE FLAKES! My hair smells better and is not as dry. I recommend this product to friends and family whenever the topic of dry scalp comes up. I massage it into my scalp after I get out of the shower. I only need to apply it once a week or so now to keep my scalp healthy.</li>
    <li> Didnt work. Made my hair very greecy</li>
    <li> First time reviewing.  I wasn&#x27;t sure how to use in because directions say in to apply like dressing  which I didn&#x27;t understand.  So after trying a few things.  For immediate results I take this in the shower and just fallen my hair and apply liberally to my scalp.  I scrub it in with my fingertips and leave it in for like 5 minutes.After I rinse I use my cleansing conditioner.  After one use my dandruff was gone.  I&#x27;ve had dandruff since I was a little kid.  I&#x27;ve tried everything....  This stuff is amazing.  I use it 2 or 3 times a week.  When you stop it comes back so is not a cure but it&#x27;s the next best thing.  My head used to leave snow showers on my clothes.  It was awful.  I couldn&#x27;t leave it on my hair with out rinsing it bcoz it made my hair dry and disgusting. Seriously try in my way.  I guarantee results. Life changing!</li>
    <li> Bought this for a sister that has eczema in the scalp. It does the job, what more can I say?</li>
    <li> It really works for me. I love it.</li>
    <li> This Product was so amazing,,, in just ONE applied to my scalf it Kicks the butts of Dundruff to my Head..... Cool Bananas.... this is the 1st time I used Online Shopping I am from the Philippines...  I am very thankful and very happy to this Product and Thanks Amazon.. Cheersss....</li>
    <li> This product definitely did an awesome job with my hair.  I am happy when my friend recommended it to me, all I have to say is yes this product work. It did a wonderful job for me and I myself like my friend did is recommend this to other as well.</li>
    <li> Unfortunately, I cannot seem to get this on my hair without making a huge mess, I read the reviews and tried it how other people advised, and it hasn&#x27;t worked for me, and it leaves my hair super greasy. I&#x27;m so disappointed.</li>
    <li> This has got to be a miracle in a white jar. This stuff is beyond amazing. IV delt with really bad dandruff for most of my teenage years, and now my early 20&#x27;s. It&#x27;s completely embarrassing, I mean I have thick flakes that just build up and look so disgusting. I had tried a variety of different things; tea tree oil being the main one, but it didn&#x27;t work. So I looked up for a remedy online, and came across this product. I was a bit wary since I hadn&#x27;t heard of the brand, and it was less than $10!! So I bought it. When I got it I washed my hair I immediately put it on while my hair was still damp. I let my hair air dry through the night (and by the morning I usually see a whole bunch of flakes just mocking me). When I woke up there was nothing, and I mean nothing. No flakes, no itching, no dandruff. So I gave it a couple more days and nothing. I didn&#x27;t have one flake of dandruff. This stuff has truly saved me, I&#x27;m now more confident because I don&#x27;t have to worry about flakes. I mean it&#x27;s cheap, lasts a LONG time, and it has no smell. I would completely recommend this product who suffers from dandruff!</li>
    <li> I was excited about this product due to the reviews, but I suppose I didn&#x27;t turn out as lucky with its performance as the others. I was especially worried when I took a look at the ingredients, two of which are petrolatum and mineral oil, ingredients I know to be oily on my hair and scalp. Since my hair is very fine and oily, I was afraid this product would just make my hair look really greasy. It pretty much does.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not only does this type of product seem to take a long time to apply, it&#x27;s really messy. It doesn&#x27;t seem effective to wash it out, either, especially since it&#x27;s best applied AFTER you have gotten out of the shower.It left my hair incredibly oily to the point that my boyfriend asked me if I was going to wash my hair before we went into town (it looked like I hadn&#x27;t washed it in over a week) - and I had JUST stepped out of the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The effectiveness of this really wasn&#x27;t what I was hoping for, either. I have gotten much better results from products like Neutrogena&#x27;s Extra Strength T-Gel, also in less time. I think I will keep looking for a scalp treatment that works for my fine oily hair.</li>
    <li> I use this with the shampoo.  Don&#x27;t use too much or it ends up a little greasy.  A little bit goes a long way!</li>
    <li> I know someone who bought this and found that they had a blood pressure spike? Why would someone buy something that is medicated if they don&#x27;t know what the medication is?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The person I know found that it worked for them, but I&#x27;m relucant to try it. Wish I knew what was in it.</li>
    <li> I used every product out there with little to no success. This product works.</li>
