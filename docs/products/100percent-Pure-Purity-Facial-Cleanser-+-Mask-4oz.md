      <li>and I got my free Prime shipping.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m trying to shift into using more natural products and I love this.</li>

      <li>I LOVE Pure 100% products.</li>
      <li>I love all of 100% Pure&#x27;s cleaners.</li>
      <li>&quot; the most when used as a mask, and leaves skin very smooth.&lt;br</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s pretty strong</li>
      <li>Anyone interested could probably easily google one.</li>
      <li>She has been washing her face with it every day and her acne has cleared up tremendously.  </li>
      <li>This face wash is so amazing, I too feel like many other consumers out there that have just tried everything, but nothing worked.</li>
      <li>it is my new favorite.  </li>
      <li>You can tell after the first use that your skin was detoxed!  </li>
      <li>do get a couple of occasional blemishes still -- but they clear up MUCH more quickly on their own than they used to.</li>
      <li>I wanted to try something more natural.</li>
      <li>But I&#x27;m now thinking it&#x27;s worth the work!&lt;br</li>
      <li>We wanted to start using more natural products</li>
      <li>it smells sort of fresh.</li>
      <li>Love all there products I have tried so far.</li>
      <li>for the price, it&#x27;s just fun to play with.</li>
      <li>My skin did not feel right after using this stuff.</li>
      <li>If you are able to be patient, small blemishes go away on their own in a day or two.&lt;br</li>
      <li>For an all natural product, this is pretty strong stuff.</li>
      <li>This is really pepperminty!</li>
      <li>This is a good product, just not a good fit for me.</li>
      <li>(I went through one bottle, tried something different that I didn&#x27;t like any better, then</li>
      <li>Thank God for a company who&#x27;s ideals/goals/lifestyle match exactly with</li>
      <li>My favorite item is their eye cream but wanted to check out this facial mask</li>
      <li>On the down side, I tried it without my clarisonic, and it didn&#x27;t foam nearly as well, but still tingled and felt great.</li>
      <li>I am almost positive that this cleanser may now be a cause of the breakouts since they&#x27;re all over my face now.</li>
      <li>and it also will remove makeup, so you wouldn&#x27;t need to separately remove light to moderate makeup first</li>
      <li>She is also using the 100% Pure Spot Treatment along with it.</li>
      <li>Also, when i do have a pimple I will use the 100 per cent pure spot treatment on it.</li>
      <li>It is very thick and clay-like in consistency that it works best as a facial mask.</li>
      <li>Proactiv made my skin look great, but that&#x27;s because it was basically chemically burning my skin so that nothing could grow: bad or good facial oil.</li>
      <li>clay really cleans my face and helps absorb some of the oil I have.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this product for all skin types!</li>
      <li>and he tried it for three days and his acne began clearing up so fast, he asked me for a bottle for Hus birthday.</li>
      <li>so I picked this one up for him and he really likes it</li>
      <li>(it foams really well).</li>
      <li>In the mornings I don&#x27;t need as much.</li>
      <li>I splurged on this product because I&#x27;d heard that Japanese skin care products (which this is?) are fantastic for skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I really like this cleanser.</li>
      <li>and I really notice a difference.</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s mostly blackheads which aren&#x27;t visible from far away -- they&#x27;re only bumpy when you&#x27;re looking closeup in the mirror.</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t leave it on as long as I was going to because it dries very quickly.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> The absolute best acne controlled mask you can find out there without containing any chemicals or harmful products for your skin!!!&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product. It leaves my skin feeling so soft, clean and clear.</li>
    <li> For an all natural product, this is pretty strong stuff. My face got really dry and flaky. Even if I used alot of moisturizer and after I exfoliate my skin still looked dull. My skin did not feel right after using this stuff. I suggest don&#x27;t use on a daily basis if you want to try, because it will dry out your skin!</li>
    <li> 2 years ago I ate like junk, used chemical-ridden products, and I even felt like the crap I put in my body!! After some serious health scares, I went vegan. That began me slowly backing away from all the bad/unhealthy/unnatural products in my life as well. 2 long years later, I&#x27;ve found a natural replacement for nearly everything I used before. Proactiv made my skin look great, but that&#x27;s because it was basically chemically burning my skin so that nothing could grow: bad or good facial oil. My transition went Proactiv &amp;#62; Burts Bees Soapbark facial cleansing system (a little stronger than this product I think) &amp;#62; this 100% Pure facial cleanser. Coupled with an awesome diet (eliminating all foods that were causing my breakouts: dairy and foods that had aluminum-based dyes as the food coloring agent) and natural products, my skin looks amazing! I get compliments all the time, and I can&#x27;t believe I have the same results with something all natural as I did with something so chemically radical. Give it a try if you&#x27;re trying to go the natural route. This is a great product line. I use all their makeup, lotions, shampoos. Thank God for a company who&#x27;s ideals/goals/lifestyle match exactly with mine!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Btw, this smells like a natural version of Noxzema!! Heavenly!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Picture proof: very clear skin.</li>
    <li> Most amazing face wash!</li>
    <li> I love love the pepperminty smell and tingly sensation. I&#x27;m trying to shift into using more natural products and I love this. Previously, I was using Philosophy Putity, now this. I use it every morning and evening. That makes my skin a little dry, but it&#x27;s nothing a moisturizer can&#x27;t fix. I have pretty bad hormonal acne, and I&#x27;m not sure this GENUINELY helps, but in addition to diet changes and putting on less makeup, this is nice. I would buy in the future.</li>
    <li> I love this line of products.  I&#x27;ve had no reaction to any of their products.  My favorite item is their eye cream but wanted to check out this facial mask and it&#x27;s great.</li>
    <li> I really like this cleanser. It is gentle on skin and yet really helps me feel like I&#x27;m getting a good cleaning. You can use it as a soap or a mask. The only problem is the directions are nearly impossible to read as they are in the same color font as the color of the cleanser.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t have a lot of acne just a few black heads here and there, but my boyfriend has bad acne. My boyfriend never washes his face with actual face cleanser. He has dark acne spots/scars and he gets a lot if black heads and clogged pores. I introduced him to it saying it helped me out and he tried it for three days and his acne began clearing up so fast, he asked me for a bottle for Hus birthday.</li>
    <li> **EDIT** a few months later:&lt;br /&gt;NOOOOOOO. I&#x27;ve been using this for a couple months now, off and on. (I went through one bottle, tried something different that I didn&#x27;t like any better, then came back to this). My face after several weeks of this cleanser unfortunately started to break out a lot literally all over, more so than it was before. It also lost the \\&quot;smooth\\&quot; and \\&quot;tingly\\&quot; effect I loved at first. I started doing research on my makeup to determine if my makeup was the cause. I came across a list of pore-clogging ingredients to avoid in makeup (translate: all facial skin care) and guess what it included? Red algae, kelp, spirulina, coconut oil -- four of the major ingredients in this facial cleanser! I am almost positive that this cleanser may now be a cause of the breakouts since they&#x27;re all over my face now. THIS IS MARKETED AS A PRODUCT FOR ACNE BUT ACTUALLY CONTAINS PORE CLOGGING INGREDIENTS. Watch out. Also, nowhere on the bottle does it state \\&quot;non-comedogenic\\&quot;... I am now noticing. So, sorry about the earlier review... it was true at the time! I changed the stars down to 2 stars, because I do appreciate the vegan and organic nature of the product, however, it is mis-marketed and mis-leading. The search for a cleanser continues, but now I&#x27;m armed with a list. Anyone interested could probably easily google one. It&#x27;s just a bit of work to go through the list with every product in question. But I&#x27;m now thinking it&#x27;s worth the work!&lt;br /&gt;****&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this twice a day as a cleanser - morning and night - for about three weeks now. I&#x27;ve used it as a mask a handful of times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have combination skin and stubborn mild-to-moderate acne (blackheads and whiteheads) that is difficult to clear up. Previously I&#x27;d been using benzoyl peroxide, but it&#x27;s so harsh on skin -- it sort of helped keep some acne away, but it also caused new acne of a different type due to over-dry skin. I wanted to try something more natural. I splurged on this product because I&#x27;d heard that Japanese skin care products (which this is?) are fantastic for skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin feels SO smooth after using this, and refreshed. Some people have commented about the smell, but I think it smells great! It&#x27;s a little bit minty - it smells sort of fresh. I really can&#x27;t think of another daily cleanser I&#x27;ve used that I prefer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also enjoy it as a mask. It dries quickly! It \\&quot;tingles\\&quot; the most when used as a mask, and leaves skin very smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s NOT perfect. For some reason, my forehead is continuing to break out (more so than usual!) while the rest of my face is completely clearing up and evening out its tone and smoothing out. I don&#x27;t understand this at all. My forehead is not \\&quot;unique\\&quot; -- my nose and chin get just as oily usually as my forehead does, so it doesn&#x27;t really make sense to me. However, the type of breakout that is occurring on my forehead is much smaller acne and it&#x27;s mostly blackheads which aren&#x27;t visible from far away -- they&#x27;re only bumpy when you&#x27;re looking closeup in the mirror. And more non-visible blackheads are preferable to me than fewer painful red raised lumps, which is what I was getting before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do get a couple of occasional blemishes still -- but they clear up MUCH more quickly on their own than they used to. And again, they are smaller than they used to be. I feel as though my skin is healing, although I&#x27;m not sure what is going on with my forehead. I&#x27;m going to give it some more time and see. I am using this in conjunction with another in their line of products -- the purity spot treatment. Trying both out at once.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This works MUCH better when you are able to avoid popping anything. If you are able to be patient, small blemishes go away on their own in a day or two.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a cleanser and it also will remove makeup, so you wouldn&#x27;t need to separately remove light to moderate makeup first -- you can just use this to cleanse. I usually use a little bit more to remove makeup and just foam it up in my hands first (it foams really well). In the mornings I don&#x27;t need as much.</li>
    <li> This is a good product, just not a good fit for me. I prefer the &amp;#34;Lavender Seafoam&amp;#34; product by the same company. This is really pepperminty! So if you&#x27;re into that, great but it&#x27;s pretty strong and you wouldn&#x27;t want to get any in your eyes, that&#x27;s for sure!</li>
    <li> This face wash is so amazing, I too feel like many other consumers out there that have just tried everything, but nothing worked. I have used many different face washes and just seen small improvements and settled for substandard skin. I was using Kate Somerville&#x27;s detox cleanser which is almost double the price of this face wash and doesn&#x27;t work as well either. This face wash has really cleared up my clogged pores, acne, and uneven skin tone. I have seen an all around improvement in the clarity of my skin and it&#x27;s tone. I really adore this face wash and can&#x27;t say enough about it.</li>
    <li> After using this facial mask my skin felt so clean and being that I have sensitive skin it did not irritate my skin at all.It was very refreshing to use.</li>
    <li> I was first introduced to this facial cleanser by my daughter.  I love it.  It gives you face a nice tingle and has a mud-like consistency that works great as a buffer.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m so glad I found this cleanser- it is my new favorite.  I&#x27;ve been using it with my clarisonic mia, and it foams really nicely, smells fabulous, and my skin feels so tingly clean when I am using it, that I am reluctant to stop. All of the ingreadients are just as advertised- all natural which is really hard to find, and I am an ingredient reading consumer &amp; pharmacist. On the down side, I tried it without my clarisonic, and it didn&#x27;t foam nearly as well, but still tingled and felt great.</li>
    <li> My favorite cleanser and mask. I buy them at SFO airport every time I pass through and realized I forgot it hotel after I got home. Thank goodness for Amazon because I found it here and had it in my possession within 2 days. It is glued to my travel tote now. Really cleans out pores and not harsh and smells refreshing!!!!</li>
    <li> I LOVE Pure 100% products. This mask/cleanser is amazing. My skin feels so much better. If I skip a day of using this product, you can tell.</li>
    <li> I love all of 100% Pure&#x27;s cleaners. This one also doubles as a mask and I find that I like leaving it on for a few minutes instead of immediately washing it off. Only downside is the smell, which reminds me of toothpaste. But, that&#x27;s only my personal preferance - I don&#x27;t like the mint.</li>
    <li> Love all there products I have tried so far.</li>
    <li> This face wash/face mask is for my husband for his acne prone skin.  We wanted to start using more natural products so I picked this one up for him and he really likes it and he is on his 3 one now.  It has a refreshing scent and minty feel.  You can use this as a face wash or leave in on your face as a mask.</li>
    <li> Really great cleanser. it&#x27;s exfoliating, it&#x27;s tingly and makes a great mask as well.&lt;br /&gt;I wouldn&#x27;t recommend using it every day because it is really powerful and strong.  I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s the clay or the peppermint or what but it&#x27;s a little too intense to use morning and night, day in and day out.  However once a week it would be excellent for a deep cleansing/pore refining.  It is a little messy like any green clay mask so be aware of that.  I didn&#x27;t leave it on as long as I was going to because it dries very quickly. I scrubbed for about 60 seconds and then left it on for like a minute or two.  My skin feels great and still tingly and refreshed hours later.</li>
    <li> Absolutely beautiful skin after using this.  Followed by the reparative moisturizer.. A winning combo.</li>
    <li> I am obsessed with this stuff. I always make sure I have a bottle on hand. I even bought one for my best friend! Update: after using this every day, my friend said her skin was pimple free so I decided to try it every day too, and not just twice a week. After about a week or so I noticed my skin was clearer so I kept using it. It has been about 5 months now and I really notice a difference. For pimple prone faces this product works, you just have to wash your face with it morning and night. I use the fragrance free kiss my face lotion after I wash my face because the cleanser is drying. This regimen has helped me a lot. Also, when i do have a pimple I will use the 100 per cent pure spot treatment on it.</li>
    <li> I use this myself and got this one for my teenage daughter, who is struggling with acne. She has been washing her face with it every day and her acne has cleared up tremendously.  She is also using the 100% Pure Spot Treatment along with it. Not sure if they sell that on Amazon or not - I haven&#x27;t checked. Anyway, before she began using this she was begging me to take her to a dermatologist - this was a whole lot less expensive than a doctor and now she is happy and I am happy. :)  As I mentioned before, I use it too and absolutely love it.</li>
    <li> what a great summer facial scrub and cleaner. It&#x27;s gentle enough that it doesn&#x27;t break me out at all (quite the opposite), but it packs a powerful pepperminty punch that&#x27;s just the ticket to wake up my sleepy face in the mornings! I like the versatility in using it as a mask as well. A+ product. Gentle and effective.</li>
    <li> for the price, it&#x27;s just fun to play with. but wasting of time! especially after reading paula choice&#x27;s comments about this brand, now  understand my skin is not comfortable with product!!!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for a while now. Normally I order it online with 100% Pure but they were out of stock. The price was the same here and I got my free Prime shipping. The product was perfect and sealed.&lt;br /&gt;The clay really cleans my face and helps absorb some of the oil I have. I have never used it as a mask but I use it as a daily cleanser (never in my eyes) and feel it really helps keep my complexion clear.</li>
    <li> You can tell after the first use that your skin was detoxed!  My blemishes were greatly diminished, as well as discolorations.  Will continue to use and recommend to friends and family!!</li>
    <li> This tea-tree oil based product is refreshing. It is very thick and clay-like in consistency that it works best as a facial mask. I started using it once a week to now once every two weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks to this product combined with good nutrition, my acne has greatly reduced! For a cleanser, try Dr. Wood&#x27;s tea tree shea butter soap.</li>
    <li> Amazing on my acne-dries them up and leaves my skin feeling clean.  I love the fact it has no harmful additives. Great buy!</li>
    <li> This really helps clear my skin. I have really sensitive skin that will break out with almost every product (even the gentle kinds). It is minty and makes my skin feel SO smooth afterwards. I put it on when I get in the shower and let it sit while I wash my hair/shave my legs/etc, and then rise it off. Voila! Smooth, lovely skin.</li>
    <li> This cleanser makes your skin look feel great. Feels amazing while its on and smells fabulous! I highly recommend this product for all skin types!</li>
