<li> The fade cream lighten my dark acne marks very well on face.</li>
<li> Within a few days certain spots were gone.  </li>
<li> Wow, it&#x27;s been a month and the dark discoloration has faded from under my eyes by 90% and my forehead 85%.&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
<li> Well to make the LONG story short, I&#x27;ve been having chemical peeling for my face hyperpigmentation (melasma) for 2 yrs.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s too bad because I actually liked this brand, especially the anti acne cream they had.</li>
<li> I am dark skinned and this product manages to lighten my dark spots while leaving my natural skin color / tone in place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> It does work but only if the spots are not too dark.</li>
<li> I usually don&#x27;t have sensitive skin, but</li>
<li> after recieving this and sitting down and actually reading the product, this is not at all what i thought it was.</li>
<li> It is not messy or hard to follow the treatment  protocol.</li>
<li> so i purchased ledermis skin fade cream by reading all other reviews....</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve used other whitening creams</li>
<li> No cream compared to any other cream.</li>
<li> recommend this fade cream to anyone with dark acne marks.</li>
<li> But I can say I see a slight difference for the 2 weeks I&#x27;ve been using, &amp; I also saw a lot of bumps that&lt;br /&gt;Came</li>
<li> &lt;br /&gt;Looking for a face cream that I remove the black spots</li>
<li> my face would feel like it was slightly burning.  </li>
<li> A little goes along way.</li>
<li> of course, for acne marks, that little wrinkle which I&#x27;m watching on the sides of my mouth and for GLOW-REFRESHNER.</li>
<li> I like that its not too harsh.</li>
<li> But, the discoloration has faded EXTREMELY slowly.</li>
<li> Again, this didn&#x27;t work for me because of my skin and that doesn&#x27;t mean that it won&#x27;t work on you.</li>
<li> I was little skeptical about the product.</li>
<li> Im guessing there&#x27;s a weird ingredient in it.</li>
<li> does not work and it smells bad</li>
<li> i am very disappointed ,did not work for me ...</li>
<li> and the smell was nasty.</li>
<li> the disgusting scent.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> does not work and it smells bad</li>
    <li> This is the best skin brightener I have ever used !!! Everyone noticed my face got brighter and my acne spots were fading. Not only that , it made my face feel so soft and clean. I only order this cream and soap once but I will be ordering again so I can get a full result . It is definitely worth the money !!!</li>
    <li> This cream erased my sun spots in a couple of weeks,</li>
    <li> So, I started using the product and when I wake up in the morning my face is red. Ironically, it gave me spots instead of clearing them. I&#x27;m still trying to get a refund but I haven&#x27;t heard from Ledermis yet. It&#x27;s too bad because I actually liked this brand, especially the anti acne cream they had. Again, this didn&#x27;t work for me because of my skin and that doesn&#x27;t mean that it won&#x27;t work on you. The product didn&#x27;t work for me and I just want my money back.</li>
    <li> This cream is the best for dark/sun spots - I have been using it for years. I highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> HIGHLY RECOMMENDED! Works 100% described.... Will buy it again when need it.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t Work out well for me</li>
    <li> I would like to know when will this product i have more than a month waiting for and has no tracking nor</li>
    <li> The fade cream lighten my dark acne marks very well on face. I would&lt;br /&gt;highly recommend this fade cream to anyone with dark acne marks.</li>
    <li> It does work but only if the spots are not too dark.</li>
    <li> ther cream ledermis i&#x27;ve been using it for a while and it works and i have no complain. i will recommended it</li>
    <li> It worked for the meantime that I had it BUT i don&#x27;t know if its the exfoliating soap or the skin fade cream that made my face break out. I usually don&#x27;t have sensitive skin, but Im guessing there&#x27;s a weird ingredient in it. But I can say I see a slight difference for the 2 weeks I&#x27;ve been using, &amp; I also saw a lot of bumps that&lt;br /&gt;Came with it. It&#x27;s a good product though.</li>
    <li> Very satisfied with the product met my expectations&lt;br /&gt;Looking for a face cream that I remove the black spots saliron me after my second pregnancy so far took just over 02 weeks using this cream and I feel like this running</li>
    <li> this cream really works without over drying.  A little goes along way. I had ance scares and darkening of the skin and I am fair skinned it really help even out  my skin.</li>
    <li> Well to make the LONG story short, I&#x27;ve been having chemical peeling for my face hyperpigmentation (melasma) for 2 yrs. But, the discoloration has faded EXTREMELY slowly. I use umbrellas, 100+ sunscreen blocker, hats, etc to stay away from the sun.&lt;br /&gt;My best friend noticed I was always staying away from sun exposure and I told her about my melasma. It&#x27;s been 5 yrs since I haven&#x27;t seen my face one color which I had TRIED to cover it with foundation without ANY success.&lt;br /&gt;That&#x27;s when she recommended LeDermis, it worked for her. Of course I believed her and I bought it at Walmart. Within a week I saw a big difference comparing to the chemical peelings. Wow, it&#x27;s been a month and the dark discoloration has faded from under my eyes by 90% and my forehead 85%.&lt;br /&gt;Will I continue using it? of course. Will I continue chemical peelings? of course, for acne marks, that little wrinkle which I&#x27;m watching on the sides of my mouth and for GLOW-REFRESHNER. ;) AND CONTINUE PROTECTING MY SKIN FROM DIRECT SUN EXPOSURE FOR LIFE.&lt;br /&gt;Am I happy? OF COURSE.... Love it!! ;)</li>
    <li> i am an asian i want to make my face skin lighter so i purchased ledermis skin fade cream by reading all other reviews....i was happy ,it came in time . After using a week or so ,did not see any difference . i am very disappointed ,did not work for me ...</li>
    <li> I took this product because a friend told me about it,so i decide to try it..overall what i like is the smell of the products and how smooth goes on your skin,,hoping to see the results that the product is selling for...</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s works, I am using the second tube, I&#x27;m still using the product  my face and neck look more clear and bright, very happy 😃</li>
    <li> I have bought many products for marks on my skin in the most the most I payed for a product was $50.00.when I heard about this I decided to give it a try MAINLY for my bikini lines , I use it in the morning and at bed time an in the matter of 2 weeks I HONESTLY see results it&#x27;s clearing up an the area is blending in with my skin tone. Don&#x27;t paste jus use enough to cover the area an the price is greattttttt love it</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t like the scent. I applied it on my&lt;br /&gt;face and the smell was nasty. Gave it to&lt;br /&gt;my sister to try, she didn&#x27;t mind the smell,&lt;br /&gt;and saw noticeable changes in one week.&lt;br /&gt;So the product seems to work if one can&lt;br /&gt;tolerate the disgusting scent. The price was right&lt;br /&gt;although one can only get it online here in the&lt;br /&gt;USA.</li>
    <li> I bought this because I have freckles &amp; hyperpigmentation on my face that I was hoping to fade.  I bought this after a recommendation from a friend, and I&#x27;m so glad I did.  I have been using this for 3 months now, and my skin looks better now than it ever has before (I&#x27;m 33 years old by the way). I had a lot of freckles &amp; hyperpigmentation all across my cheeks and some on my forehead.  Every bit of it on my forehead is gone, the spots on my cheeks are so light you can barely see them.  I can&#x27;t believe the difference! It&#x27;s absolutely amazing!  I will say that I tried using it morning and night at first, but I stopped because I felt like when I used it in the morning time and went out during the day... my face would feel like it was slightly burning.  I switched to only using it at night, and I&#x27;ve not had that issue any more at all.  In fact, using it only at night time has maximized my results I believe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I absolutely love this product, and will continue to buy it as it is a normal part of my nightly skin care regimen now.</li>
    <li> This fade cream worked right away for me. Within a few days certain spots were gone.  I used a q-tip to apply directly to the spots - left it on the spot for about 10 minutes then rubbed it in - invisible.  Do not spread all over unless your intention is to lighten a whole area.  If you only want to fade certain spots, this is a good product...pleasant smelling.  Make sure face is clean before applying.</li>
    <li> i try everithyng this cream is the only one that clear my face love it!!! &#x3D;)&lt;br /&gt;i recomended to anybody thanks</li>
    <li> This product works as it should. It is not messy or hard to follow the treatment  protocol. The only draw back is that the size of the kit sold will not completely remove the spots so in order to get clear skin most likely a second kit will have to be ordered. Aside from that it is a great way to get the skin tone imperfections taken care of.</li>
    <li> It works on me wonderful. The sun spot and the age spot are gone. My face is clear and am happy with the result thanks God and thank you.</li>
    <li> I love this cream I recommend. 2nd is the order you see THROUGH you. I recommend it to everyone who has facial blemishes. I&#x27;ve used other whitening creams but I had given ninuna resueltado Le Dermis cream.No cream compared to any other cream.Is the best.</li>
    <li> I will keep this short and sweet.  It works!  I use the soap in the shower, then I put the cream all over my face.  I am dark skinned and this product manages to lighten my dark spots while leaving my natural skin color / tone in place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Perfect.</li>
    <li> I like that its not too harsh. I have sensitive skin but it didn&#x27;t break me out. However it made zero difference in the appearance of my sun damage and I used it all. The bonus soap is really nice. I used it all as well. I&#x27;m honestly surprised it made no difference at all.</li>
    <li> I was little skeptical about the product. I have always use expensive products from the department stores and it doesn&#x27;t work as good. This product exceeded my expectations. I have been using it for 2 weeks and my skin is clearing up. Does not make me break out. This stuff really works!!! I definitely recommend this product if you want clear, luminous skin. I use it twice a day under my makeup with spf 55 by neutrogena for added sun protection. and at night before bed.</li>
    <li> after recieving this and sitting down and actually reading the product, this is not at all what i thought it was. still in original package and am trying to send it back.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for 4 years.  It&#x27;s an excellent sunscreen, and my brown spots continue to fade.</li>
