### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>The best thing about this for me is how it makes the self tanner look on m feet and ankles.  </li>
      <li>I figured it would be awesome like the FB Flawless and the FB Face Platinum.</li>
      <li>Best tanner I have ever used.</li>
      <li>Great on legs!  </li>
      <li>This stuff is awesome!!</li>
      <li>Very nice finishing!</li>
      <li>The color is great.</li>
      <li>It works great</li>
      <li>I use this weekly and it works great.  </li>
      <li>great product.  </li>
      <li>I had great hopes for it and followed the directions for use.  </li>
      <li>the product goes on very nice, not greasy feeling.</li>
      <li>Amazing!</li>
      <li>I would deffinently recommend this product for any fair skinned person.</li>
      <li>, I don&#x27;t think it works good at all.</li>
      <li>Love it!</li>
      <li>Feels nice but has a funky smell.</li>
      <li>loved the light scent.  </li>
      <li>This product helps dramatically to smooth those areas &amp; also to moisturize too!</li>
      <li>I was expecting a better scent.</li>
      <li>make sure you shake well before using, and this stuff is the bomb.</li>
      <li>Not my favorite pre-tan moisturizer.</li>
      <li>So glad that I found it here at a better price.  </li>
      <li>I am enjoying the &amp;#34;Fake&amp;#34</li>
      <li>Then make sure the application is even by buffing lightly with a washcloth.</li>
      <li>It is nothing special at all !</li>
      <li>It has a nice smell and is good fro applying prior to the self tanner.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very plastic-y... like burnt plastic, the smell seemed to kind of linger</li>
      <li>It makes my legs so silky smooth after I shave them.</li>
      <li>If you have this same product I think this will work great.</li>
      <li>The special exfoliater, the pre lotion, the after lotion and so on.</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t have any breakouts and it definitely is a light dry oil and help spread out the color fairly evenly.</li>
      <li>I finally got around to this product and am very glad that I did,for years I have used olive oil</li>
      <li>I love this product &amp; am getting ready to purchase my second bottle.</li>
      <li>First of all it smells like plastic, so really makes you want to spray it on you</li>
      <li>I had high hopes for this product after reading about it , but I was pretty dissappointed .</li>
      <li>This product does not feel like there is much oil in it.  </li>
      <li>and it really doesn&#x27;t mostuirize my skin very well .</li>
      <li>it on lightly after shaving to prep your skin and keep dry areas like knees, ankles, elbows from picking up too much self tanner.</li>
      <li>A towel is too cumbersome, If your skin is dry you may want to lightly spray the Skin Smoothie on your skin every day.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
      <li>Overall ok product, I would likely  purchase again or recommend to a friend.</li>
      <li>I bought this to smooth my elbows of my very dry skin.</li>
      <li>but this works better with the fake bake instant tan,love this and will always use it,smells nice.</li>
      <li>I normally don&#x27;t buy the additional products recommended with all self tanners.</li>
      <li>Totally normal.</li>
      <li>sooo I bought the Special Dry Oil</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m aware it is a dry oil, but it&#x27;s like a SUPER dry oil.  </li>
      <li>But spraying this on prior to rubbing in the Fake Bake mouse makes them look great.  </li>
      <li>It is not the easiest product in the market to get a natural looking tan.</li>
      <li>Practice makes..........an almost natural looking tan</li>
      <li>My daughter however, has sensitive skin and her results</li>
      <li>I expected it to be a little more moisturizing, but I do like it.  </li>
      <li>the oil about half an hour before the tanner to assure all of the oil is absorbed and buff or dab your skin with a towel.&lt;br</li>

<li> the oil about half an hour before the tanner to assure all of the oil is absorbed and buff or dab your skin with a towel.&lt;br</li>
<li> I love the fake bake tanning products but do not like this dry oil.</li>
<li> I have another dry oil I use for regular moisturizing because I have dry skin and will still use that for my regular use.  </li>
<li> When I don&#x27;t use this first my knuckles get very dark brown &amp; any other patches of dry skin.</li>
<li> And because it has a texture of oil it feels much more moisturizing than the other Fake Bake spray moisturizer</li>
<li> I love every other Fake Bake product I have used, but will not be using this one again.</li>
<li> /&gt;Lotion will cause the Fake Bake to be uneven and spotty so the Fake Bake brand moisturizer is your best</li>
<li> don&#x27;t think that lasts long though.</li>
<li> It almost seems like an x-tra dry oil.  </li>
<li> However, it did not live up to the hype.</li>
<li> This is a must have for all the dry areas!</li>
<li> I wash my hands a lot &amp; have dry skin on them &amp; other areas.</li>
<li> Fake Bake Smoothie definitely compliments the Fake Bake Self Tanner and is much better than regular lotion for preserving your self tan..</li>
<li> and secondly it turned the palms of my hands VERY dark brown to the point that they looked black.</li>
<li> It keeps the knees and elbows from looking dry or streaky from the fake bake lotion stuff, and it makes my skin soooo soft!!</li>
<li> I think it is no better than any other dry oil you can buy.</li>
<li> My feet and ankles always look splotchy, too dark, etc.</li>
<li> So instead of doing what its made to do, it made me smell like plastic and turned my palms black.</li>
<li> /&gt;Do not accidentally get any of the oil on the application sponge or you will have a mess to remove.&lt;br /&gt;Apply</li>
<li> and i use it everyday.</li>
<li> Since you can&#x27;t use any moisturizer before using a self tanner my skin gets dryer &amp; dryer (I use self tanner everyday almost).</li>
<li> So i bought this to work in lieu of my other Fake Bake products.</li>
<li> unfortunately were acne.</li>
<li> , it made the places were i put on my fake and bake tan blotchy .</li>
<li> I personally think it smells terrible.</li>
<li> I purchased this along with the Fake Bake self tanner.</li>
<li> This is a must before using Fake Bake or any self tanning product.</li>
<li> Must have product for Fake Bake applications.  </li>
<li> Its stinks like tea tree oil,</li>
<li> It smells bad</li>
<li> Smells terrible, feels greasy not moisturizing</li>
<li> It also smells terrible.</li>
<li> Hate this!</li>
<li> I am terrible at applying self tanner.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Must have product for Fake Bake applications.  Very nice finishing!</li>
    <li> great product.  loved the light scent.  the product goes on very nice, not greasy feeling.</li>
    <li> I purchased this along with the Fake Bake self tanner. I recommend it on knees and elbows before applying the tanner.</li>
    <li> Works well but you have to shake a lot..and it does smell like carrots don&#x27;t think that lasts long though.</li>
    <li> I expected it to be a little more moisturizing, but I do like it.  I&#x27;m aware it is a dry oil, but it&#x27;s like a SUPER dry oil.  I will still continue to use it.</li>
    <li> Best tanner I have ever used. Feet and hands were hardest areas to tan evenly.  Great on legs!  Recommend this product</li>
    <li> This stuff is awesome!!</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t complain about this.  It has a nice smell and is good fro applying prior to the self tanner.  It almost seems like an x-tra dry oil.  I have another dry oil I use for regular moisturizing because I have dry skin and will still use that for my regular use.  Will probably stick to this just for the self tanner.</li>
    <li> Not my favorite pre-tan moisturizer. I love every other Fake Bake product I have used, but will not be using this one again.</li>
    <li> I am terrible at applying self tanner. This is a must have for all the dry areas!</li>
    <li> Hate this! Smells terrible, feels greasy not moisturizing</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s alright, I just don&#x27;t use it like I thought I would.</li>
    <li> Did not like. It didn&#x27;t work the way i wanted it to or the way it was meant for, it made the places were i put on my fake and bake tan blotchy . Its stinks like tea tree oil, And i didn&#x27;t like the idea that there is naked ladies on the bottle. (( which i didn&#x27;t notice in-tell my daughter was looking at it and asked &amp;#34;why is there naked girls on it&amp;#34;?) Will not buy again.</li>
    <li> Amazing! It makes my legs so silky smooth after I shave them.</li>
    <li> Like the way it drys and makes your skin feel.</li>
    <li> So i bought this to work in lieu of my other Fake Bake products. I figured it would be awesome like the FB Flawless and the FB Face Platinum. I didn&#x27;t have any breakouts and it definitely is a light dry oil and help spread out the color fairly evenly. My only deal with it was the smell. It&#x27;s very plastic-y... like burnt plastic, the smell seemed to kind of linger but i couldn&#x27;t tell after i put my cologne on. It definitely does it&#x27;s job, but the smell is nothing like they say.</li>
    <li> Love it! make sure you shake well before using, and this stuff is the bomb. It keeps the knees and elbows from looking dry or streaky from the fake bake lotion stuff, and it makes my skin soooo soft!!</li>
    <li> I finally got around to this product and am very glad that I did,for years I have used olive oil but this works better with the fake bake instant tan,love this and will always use it,smells nice.</li>
    <li> You have to use something moisturizing or your skin will look like lizard skin.&lt;br /&gt;Lotion will cause the Fake Bake to be uneven and spotty so the Fake Bake brand moisturizer is your best choice.&lt;br /&gt;Do not accidentally get any of the oil on the application sponge or you will have a mess to remove.&lt;br /&gt;Apply the oil about half an hour before the tanner to assure all of the oil is absorbed and buff or dab your skin with a towel.&lt;br /&gt;If not you will see that oil and water do not mix. It is not the easiest product in the market to get a natural looking tan. No matter what I do I always have an issue with my heels or ankles . The color is great. Not orange.&lt;br /&gt;Take your time . Practice makes..........an almost natural looking tan</li>
    <li> I bought this to smooth my elbows of my very dry skin. It works great and i use it everyday.</li>
    <li> I am enjoying the &amp;#34;Fake&amp;#34; tan.</li>
    <li> My daughter however, has sensitive skin and her results unfortunately were acne. I would deffinently recommend this product for any fair skinned person.</li>
    <li> It is nothing special at all ! I was expecting a better scent. I personally think it smells terrible. I was hoping it would have a fruity smell like one person said it smelled like peaches...well, it does not. I think it is no better than any other dry oil you can buy. I will not be purchasing again. I love the fake bake tanning products but do not like this dry oil.</li>
    <li> I had high hopes for this product after reading about it , but I was pretty dissappointed . It smells bad and I don&#x27;t like how the spray bottle works and it really doesn&#x27;t mostuirize my skin very well . I would never repurchase this item</li>
    <li> I normally don&#x27;t buy the additional products recommended with all self tanners. The special exfoliater, the pre lotion, the after lotion and so on. But when I notice my skin starting to crackle and use my regular lotion it destroys the tan. The lotion picks up the self tanner and left me with patchwork skin. sooo I bought the Special Dry Oil and it does the job it claims to do. I have not figured out the term &amp;#34;dry oil&amp;#34; but they can call it whatever they want. It works.&lt;br /&gt;Spray it on lightly after shaving to prep your skin and keep dry areas like knees, ankles, elbows from picking up too much self tanner. Then make sure the application is even by buffing lightly with a washcloth. A towel is too cumbersome, If your skin is dry you may want to lightly spray the Skin Smoothie on your skin every day.&lt;br /&gt;The Fake Bake Smoothie definitely compliments the Fake Bake Self Tanner and is much better than regular lotion for preserving your self tan..</li>
    <li> This product did not work for me.  I had great hopes for it and followed the directions for use.  However, it did not live up to the hype.</li>
    <li> The best thing about this for me is how it makes the self tanner look on m feet and ankles.  My feet and ankles always look splotchy, too dark, etc. But spraying this on prior to rubbing in the Fake Bake mouse makes them look great.  Totally normal.</li>
    <li> This product does not feel like there is much oil in it.  I also did not think that it works any better at minimizing the penetration of the Fake Bake tanning spray than regular inexpensive lotion does. It also smells terrible.</li>
    <li> Feels nice but has a funky smell. Overall ok product, I would likely  purchase again or recommend to a friend.</li>
    <li> I got this in the hopes it would work on the &amp;#34;dry skin&amp;#34; areas. First of all it smells like plastic, so really makes you want to spray it on you and secondly it turned the palms of my hands VERY dark brown to the point that they looked black. So instead of doing what its made to do, it made me smell like plastic and turned my palms black. DO NOT BUY THIS!!!!!</li>
    <li> I love this product &amp; am getting ready to purchase my second bottle. I wash my hands a lot &amp; have dry skin on them &amp; other areas. Since you can&#x27;t use any moisturizer before using a self tanner my skin gets dryer &amp; dryer (I use self tanner everyday almost). This is a must before using Fake Bake or any self tanning product. When I don&#x27;t use this first my knuckles get very dark brown &amp; any other patches of dry skin. This product helps dramatically to smooth those areas &amp; also to moisturize too! If you have this same product I think this will work great. And because it has a texture of oil it feels much more moisturizing than the other Fake Bake spray moisturizer, I don&#x27;t think it works good at all.</li>
    <li> I used to buy this product at ultra.  So glad that I found it here at a better price.  I use this weekly and it works great.  No streaks at all</li>
