<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> It was a nice purchase! All went well!</li>
    <li> I bought this stuff on a whim at their store, the tub is $16 in store and the tube is $10 in store (same price per ounce either way). I really liked the smell, kind of like a fresh scent I think. When I got home I tried this stuff out and really really liked it. This stuff builds a very nice and rich lather, and is very slick so shaving with this is great, I had zero irritation with a blade I have never used before. This stuff is thick and slick enough that touch ups were a breeze even without re-applying lather.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My initial thought was that this stuff was on the pricey side compared to the $4/bar shave soap I have been using (Van Der Hagan Deluxe) both have a very nice fresh scent. This stuff is definitely nicer though, very luxurious (cream vs soap). If you look around price wise they have this one priced very comparable to similar products out there. This is a lot cheaper than the majority of the creams out there. Overall very happy with this.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this shave cream for some time and trying another ones just for curiosity and this Macca Root cream, still is the number one for me.</li>
    <li> This product produces a good lather, it feels good on my skin, but above all the smell can&#x27;t be beat!</li>
    <li> My wife says she like the scent after I shaving with  this cream.</li>
    <li> Slick for a smooth shave</li>
    <li> Best shave cream ever purchased! I&#x27;ve bought the art of shaving comparable product and will chose this one any day over others.</li>
    <li> The cream whips into a fantastic lather. It is really thick and you only need a small amount. The smell is pretty good, it has an earthy smell, probably from the maca root I assume. However, I have very sensitive skin and this is very highly fragrance and seems to have synthetic ingredients and it irritates my skin.</li>
    <li> This stuff is the biz. Never had a razor bump since I started using this stuff...</li>
    <li> Changed to this from Kiehl&#x27;s men&#x27;s shave cream once the company was sold and they changed the formula of this classic(shame on you L&#x27;Oreal). Very good product. Lasts 3-4 months. Highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Prior to using the Maca Root Shave Cream, I had no idea how much of an effect the choice of shaving cream had on the closeness of a shave using a razor.  I thought it all had to do with only the blades you used.  In the past I have used Nivea Sensitive Shaving Gel when I shaved with a Gillette Fusion Power razor.  I was recently in a Body Shop store and was offered a sample of the Maca Root Shave Cream to try.  After using it for one day, I purchased the Maca Root Shave Cream as well as the [[ASIN:B001PDDEVS The Body Shop Men&#x27;s Synthetic Shave Brush]] and the [[ASIN:B003921DDE The Body Shop For Men Maca Root Face Wash]] to use before I shave.  The result of using the shave cream is a much closer and comfortable shave than when I was using the shaving gel.      You can apply the shaving cream without the brush, but the use of the brush is supposed to raise the hairs on your face to give you a closer shave.  Plus I find that I enjoy using the old school method of the brush.  After washing with the Maca Root Face Wash, I dip the wet brush into the jar of Maca Root Shave Cream and apply to my face.  You actually only need a little of the shaving cream on the brush to result in a rich lather on your face.  It took me a few goes before I got it right because at first I was using far too much.  At my current rate, the jar of shave cream will easily last me for months.  The woman in the Body Shop store told me that some people will leave the lid off of the jar which causes the shaving cream to reduce in volume as it settles into the container.  This allows you better control over how much of the shaving cream you actually put onto your brush.    I never used the older Body Shop shaving cream and so I cant comment on how much the scent of the shaving cream has changed.  What I do know is that since the switch to using the Body Shop products, my girlfriend has commented several times how nice my skin smells.      The staff in the Body Shop I visited made the point that men require so little skin care compared to women that we should invest in really nice skin care products when we do purchase them.  I highly recommend the Maca Root Shave Cream, the brush and the Maca Root Face Wash to clean your skin before shaving.  The use of these products has resulted in a much closer shave than I ever achieved using shaving gel.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful product that provides a wonderful slick lather and that has immeasurable skin care qualities.  The scent is surprising in a good way...it has a hint of intimacy yet is very masculine.  It gives my face a fine protective slickness that helps the razor glide smoothly around.  I really like this cream, and though I don&#x27;t use it everyday I do usually pick it up and give it a sniff.  It has a certain allure and is very welcoming and familiar. I like it so much that I bought two extras! Yes, it is that good!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You owe it to yourself to give this one a try...I rate it right up there with Geo F Trumper old formulation!</li>
    <li> I was given this product as a gift and I am back to purchase more.  I cannot speak to other reviews about the \\&quot;old\\&quot; product, but this shaving cream rocks!  Apply a thin coat straight out of the jar, no brush or lathering required, then shave.  It is Very lightly scented and gives me the smoothest shave that I have ever had in 30 years of scraping whiskers off.</li>
    <li> I have tried lots: Art of Shaving, eShave, Harry&#x27;s, Anthony Logistics (my second favorite). This lathers up great with a brush (so does Art of Shaving, and Anthony Logisitics) and I like the smell and tingle.</li>
    <li> For Men, move over Gillete, Nivea and all other products. Sure, Body Shop Shaving Cream does not sound as manly as we want it to, but this is the best your skin deserves. There is a clear difference is the experience. Go for it!  I used this in India, and I am so happy that Amazon.com offers this!  I ordered this with the shaving brush [must buy, great style], the razor relief lotion; and the package arrived real fast and the packaging was great!...Worth every cent!</li>
    <li> If you don&#x27;t like it send it to me. It is smooth and silky without deadners. I haven&#x27;t a clue what macca root is  but it is the best</li>
    <li> I purchased this at the store so I&#x27;m only reviewing for the product. It&#x27;s not the best cream that I&#x27;ve used but it does work well and smells very good. The scent is difficult to describe--I&#x27;d say fresh and unique. Additionally, I have not noticed much for ingrown hairs. I do use it with the maca razor relief bc I notice that my upper lip sweats when I shave and use regular facial moisturizer. The two work just fine together and far better than drugstore brand shaving foams. As well, it doesn&#x27;t clog my Mach III razors. I would buy again, on sale, at the store.</li>
    <li> THIS IS GREAT STUFF. FASCILITATES A SMOOTH SHAVE COUPLED TO A COOLING MACA ROOT BENEFIT FOR YOUR SKIN. 100 TIMES BETTER THAN ANY SHAVING CREAM I&#x27;VE EVER USED.</li>
    <li> My husband loves this stuff. Seriously, loves. It&#x27;s nice on his face.  Sometimes, men don&#x27;t like to wear face moisturizer, and this helps keep his face soft, yet manly. It smells good and lasts a long time.</li>
    <li> Best shaving cream for razor burn, or any other skin problems associated with shaving. Product last a long time.</li>
    <li> I love the body shop products, I buy this for my husband who uses a straight razor. It works well, little to no razor burn and leaves his face soft. Also the scent is very light.</li>
    <li> I was comparing this (The Body Shop Maca Root Shave Cream) to my previous favorite (Bath &amp; Body Works&#x27; C.O. Bigelow Premium Shave Cream with Eucalyptus Oil ~ aka Proraso). The maca root cream doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin and works well with my Tweezerman brush (as well as my travel Art of Shaving brush). A variety of razors have been used (Harry&#x27;s, Dorco Pace 3 and Pace 6+trimmer) all with no issue. However, the I prefer a toothpaste tube type container (Bigelow) vs the maca&#x27;s tub. Also, I like the menthol feeling that Bigelow has. That leaves my face feeling more \\&quot;energized\\&quot; and \\&quot;awake\\&quot; (even though the maca root claims to do the same).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I&#x27;ve noticed that the maca root cream tends to dry my face out more when I shave daily. For the past few weeks, had been shaving every other day with no issues. However this past weekend had to shave daily, and I noticed my face (only where I put the shave cream) was much drier than it normally was.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, it works and is better than Barbasol and most store shaving creams. However, I&#x27;ll stick with my Bigelow shave cream (which is re-packaged Proraso, highly rated stuff).</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this shaving soap for years.  The scent initially took a bit of getting used to, but now I find it pleasant.  I shave with a safety razor and brush, just a touch of soap on the brush generates a tremendous lather - more than enough for two passes.  It seems to last forever, I think I go through one container a year, if that.  I&#x27;m very happy with the product, and glad to see it now on Amazon; that will make reordering a lot easier!</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing and one jar will last you more than a year. You literally need a tic tac size amount and that is all. I shave my face 2x/week and my head 1x/week and this jar lasted more than one year for me. This stuff is amazing. All of the gels and other creams on the market do not compare. I have experimented with just about every shaving product out there looking for a comfortable shave and am so glad my brother gave me a jar of this stuff.</li>
    <li> Husband loves this stuff!</li>
    <li> I have been using this for almost one year now. I am always amazed at how effortlessly the blade cuts through for a nice clean close shave. It also seems to allow for longer life of the blades as well. I have enjoyed this so much that I have been giving it to a few friends and family as well! Each time, I always hear back from them that they too are also stunned at the quality of shave that is produced by the BS Cream.</li>
    <li> This is a great shaving cream</li>
    <li> allows for absolutely smooth shaves... I have been using this product for over 2 yrs now and I am very pleased with this shaving cream</li>
    <li> I have never used anything else, but it works just fine. Much better than a regular shaving cream, at least.</li>
    <li> been shaving with this cream for over 6 months by far the best crew, i have ever used, if your looking for that shave skin after shave please use this.</li>
    <li> I use a shaving brush and just a tiny bit gets a nice thick lather. I get a great shave and my skin feels fantastic after. I&#x27;ve tried other brands and shaving soaps--none have the same rich lather. They also leave my skin feeling dry. I can shave with the Maca Root Shave Cream after my shower and my face feels great!  Highly recommend this.</li>
    <li> Nice shave, very low fragrance.  You only need to use a dab.  Better than tubes for efficiency.  I have purchased more than once.</li>
    <li> My husband loves this shave cream. It leaves his skin feeling soft and no razor bumps.</li>
    <li> Have you ever shaved with soap?  Do you appreciate that dry, astringent feeling?  If yes, then this is the shave cream for you.  No comparison to Kiehls or Lab Series.</li>
    <li> I like this better than the classic English stuff like George Trumper or Taylor of Old Bond St, &amp; priced right. Lasts forever &amp; better than Edge or anything else. I&#x27;ve switched to a double edge &amp;#34;safety razor&amp;#34; &amp; it doesn&#x27;t get any better.</li>
    <li> We used this product for quite a white. My husband loves how effective it is on coarse hair. But it is too pricey. We have found a few other products out there that are almost as effective for considerably less.</li>
    <li> I have been using this cream for almost 20 years. I am shaving twice a week and it last me for over a year. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> The texture is like coconut oil.  My husband did not like it and did not use it. Therefore it was a waste of money. I wish that I would have not bought this one.</li>
    <li> This shave cream is excellent.It lathers forever and is slick and creamy.It provides excellent protection on par with Taylors well worth the purchase.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried Gillette, Barbasol, Neutrogena, Burt&#x27;s Bees and more but this is the best shave cream I&#x27;ve ever used. Very comfortable shave.</li>
    <li> This shave cream is intended to be lathered with a brush, I use a synthetic shave brush from Parker and WOW...This stuff lathers and peaks! Just a finger tip of cream, soak the brush and shake the water in the bowl, in 30 secs you will have a wonderful lather that lifts and softens the hair. I will be buying more, but prob not for a while as I can see this stuff lasting! Highly recommend it to any safety razor shavers!</li>
    <li> Boyfriend has sensitive skin on his face and other shaving creams weren&#x27;t doing him any favors. Bought this with a brush and he has since bought it twice more. A little goes a long way with this stuff and one container lasts a while. Smells nice too.</li>
    <li> I have hirsutism due to PCOS. As a girl with a mans beard, I shave my face like a man using an old fashion double edged razor and brush. I find that I can get a closer shave more so than any other razor (particular pairing with Feather blades.) This stuff worked for me better than all the other creams I&#x27;ve used. It&#x27;s creamy and only takes a tiny amount to get a great lather. My face is sensitive to menthol, which seems to be in the higher rated shaving creams, so this is a great alternative. I don&#x27;t notice any smell, at least none that is left behind, so girls don&#x27;t be worried, you won&#x27;t come away smelling like a man.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are a woman who has to shave, I recommend this along with a shaving brush and double edged razor with Feather blades. If you take your time and do it right, you look and feel like you are normal...at least until it starts growing back.</li>
    <li> Best part, you only need a little bit. I use a badger-hair brush and just put a dab on it, then use the back of the lid with a little hot water to work up a lather.</li>
    <li> My go to shaving cream. A little goes a long way. one tub last for weeks</li>
    <li> Close shave with mildly appealing fragrance</li>
    <li> Great product .  Makes a big difference to your shaving experience.  Get the brush and tub for home use and get the tube if you travel a lot.  Nice clean smell and lasts long time.  I will not be going back to the regular shaving gels/ creams.</li>
    <li> I have several shaving creams I use but when I want a special feeling (for a night out) I use Maca Root.  Very fresh scent.  Foams up nice.  I will probably get more and stop ordering some of the others.</li>
    <li> Lasted 7 months and I shave just about every day. Doesn&#x27;t require a lot to build a good lather. I&#x27;ve had much success with applying straight to my face with a damp (pre soaked) brush.</li>
    <li> One of the few personal products I recommend to others.  I use this to shave my head and it reduces all drag on the blade.  A great, great, product !</li>
    <li> This product rates as 5 stars, but I had to subtract one star due to the poor job Amazon did packing it.  It was in a large box, with only one small &amp;#34;air pillow&amp;#34;.  As a result, it was bashed around a lot during shipping and some of the product leaked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amazon really needs to focus on teaching their staff how to properly pack and cushion all their diverse products.</li>
    <li> The texture, (masculine) fragrance and packaging are top-notch.  Personally, I find this to be almost perfect for daily shaving.  I will say, I have sensitive, mildly dry skin that&#x27;s prone to redness, especially after I shave.  I would have liked this to have some kind of ingredient that was soothing - I have other shaving products that feel more cooling and soothing.  Recommended overall.</li>
    <li> This shaving cream lathers up very well, and it only takes a very small amount to cover your entire face... so it lasts forever. I&#x27;ve bought it twice so far, and the first lasted me over a year. I shave about 3-4x a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This shave cream isn&#x27;t very fragrant, it&#x27;s got a light fresh scent and isn&#x27;t overpowering at all. I have very sensitive skin, and have broken out with other shave creams, but this works fine with my skin. I don&#x27;t have razor bumps or any other irritation issues after shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, if you use a badger hair brush and shave cream to shave, this is a great alternative to some of the really expensive shave creams available. It&#x27;s affordable, it lasts a really long time, and it&#x27;s great on my sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> The company is great.  The natural ingredients are high quality, as is the overall product.  However I do have unfortunate criticism:  synthetic chemicals.  Lots of them.  I don&#x27;t know their purpose or their personal/environmental effect.  Until I do, I will not purchase this item again.  I will also be more careful purchasing from a company I appreciate, The Body Shop.    Check *** [...]*** to know shaving cream before buying, as well as most other personal care and HOUSEHOLD products.  (Not all are listed, unfortunately, including this one.  I should have looked before buying.)    The Environmental Working Group database is generally better than looking at Amazon reviews or anything else.  I&#x27;m an unaffiliated person just passing along advice.  Protect yourself, your family and your environment!  It&#x27;s as important as you might think, and perhaps moreso.  Try not to purchase anything but organic, biodegradable and genuinely (see the Skin Deep link) non-toxic products.  Cheers!</li>
    <li> Have been using it for 8 years and the experience has been excellent. Online shopping saves the hassle of driving to a mall where Body Shop has an outlet.</li>
    <li> I normally use Castle Forbes Lime cream which is fantastic but expensive. I thought I would try something new. This Body Shop cream lathers pretty well, it just doesn&#x27;t provide protection for your face. I use a Merkur safety razor and never had any razor burn issues with the Castle Forbe creams. This one however left my face burning  and irritated all day. It also has a very unpleasant smell. The alternative I found for the Castle Forbes is the Art of Shaving brand cream. It&#x27;s about 25 dollars, comes with twice as much, and gives a great shave.</li>
    <li> The only shave cream I will use!</li>
    <li> I really like this product, this is the best option for my skin, I loved since the first time I bought few years ago.</li>
    <li> For my taste too much of a perfume like scent. Just wanted to get the shave over with and will not use it again.</li>
    <li> This product is easy to lather, has a unique smell, and provides good razor protection.  With that being said, I like Proraso better.  You just can&#x27;t beat the menthol smell, feel, and ease of use.</li>
    <li> Best shaving cream I have used. Don&#x27;t let the price dissuade you.  You only need a tad on the shaving brush and you&#x27;re on your way to a smooth shave and a soft undisturbed feel to your face after.&lt;br /&gt;No more store bought creams and gels for me.</li>
    <li> Great shaving cream. Creates a nice thick lather without needing to use much cream. Smells great and if you use it consistently, it will protect against razor burn. Lubricates really well and my razor glides right over my skin. Great product for the price you&#x27;re paying. Had mine for 6 months now and I&#x27;m not even halfway through the can.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve now had a half-dozen shaves with this product, and am comparing it to another group of excellent products out there (Proraso, Taylor, Nivea, etc.). For me, this simply provides the best lather for DE shaves. It seems to generate the best lubrication, and is the one cream that does a reasonably good job with Feather blades (generally known as the sharpest around). We all know that DE shaving is different with every face, but at this price point, and the quality of the product, I feel strongly about giving it 5 stars.</li>
    <li> Used this with my new Omega boar-bristle brush and turned my daily shaving ritual into something to look forward to.</li>
    <li> Smells great! Works well. Will buy again and again.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my husband to try from the Body Shop store.  Have bought more through Amazon as we both like the product and the convenience/price is great on Amazon.  Like the smell!  (Ladies - be sure to sneak some for your legs!!)</li>
    <li> This stuff works really great! I use both straight razors and double edge razors, I get a very comfortable shave when I use the maca root cream!! I was using shaving soaps but, they dry my skin out. This cream doesn&#x27;t do that!!</li>
    <li> After moving to shaving with a safety razor, I first used The Art of Shaving&#x27;s lavender shave soap, which was good. But when it was running out, and I needed to get more... I thought why not see if something can beat it FOR LESS.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Maca Root Shave Cream did both. As a man prone to razor bumps and ingrown hairs, I&#x27;m very specific and careful about what combination of products I use when shaving. Either I get the bumps or my skin is irritated or both.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You only need to use a dime size amount of the cream and it lathers up heartily for a stand-out shave (I use cold water to rinse the razor blade, as someone recommended this and it has been wonderful in reducing the bumps and ingrown hair).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I follow up with alum and witch hazel and moisturizer; although I&#x27;m tempted to try The Body Shop&#x27;s after shave too at this point.</li>
    <li> Great lather and great protection.  Don&#x27;t need to use a lot of this product to get a good shave.  Works great for lathering directly on your face.</li>
    <li> I have been into traditional wet shaving for few years now, I have tried many premium shaving creams and soaps from across the world and I mix them and do all sort of things with them, I had no choice, I have very sensitive skin so in order to have a comfortable shave I really had to do my homework and now I even enjoy shaving which is something I was never expecting to happen, but some times I don&#x27;t have the time to prepare my very sophisticated concoction so I got this cream as an alternative for those mornings that I&#x27;m short of time and I was very surprise on how well it works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First I just used it by applying directly with my fingers, no brush, the result was ok and fast then another day I had already soak my brush in water ready to start with my usual blend when I realized I was already running late I just grab this cream, and since my brush was ready I dip it in the cream and leather directly on my face, I normally leather on bawl, I was not expecting such a good result. It worked great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only reason why I&#x27;m giving it 4 stars and not 5 is because I have use other creams and soaps that are better, but this is certainly one that I&#x27;m happy to recommend, specially since all I was expecting was basic solution for when I was short of time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Use it with or without brush but if you use it with a brush you triple the quality of your shave (mind you the quality of your brush will also make a difference but I&#x27;ll guess that&#x27;ll be discussed in another review!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All the best.</li>
    <li> I love this product and will be buying it 3 or 4 at a time.</li>
    <li> nice scent and a good shave</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband after he decided to switch to straight razors for shaving. He loves the cream, because it creates a great lather. It also reduces the amount of razor burn he gets when using regular shaving cream</li>
    <li> I really like this shaving cream.  Smells good and provides great protection.  It is mild on the skin and a little bit on a brush goes a long way.</li>
    <li> I used to go through razors and shaving gel every 3 weeks or so......now I have had the same razor for past 3 months!  The only different was the shaving cream.  Highly recommend to anyone.</li>
    <li> pretty close shave once it it is lathered. but can still still sting if reapplied during shaving. dove soap is still the best</li>
    <li> Every morning as I shave, I think about posting a review on this product.  It is simply the best.  I have tried about every shave cream on Amazon and elsewhere.  This shave cream lathers up like few others and holds moisture well.  Buy a Parker Safety Razor 100% Best Badger Brush, get a razor from Harry&#x27;s and you will be set for life.  All the other stuff can go out the window!</li>
    <li> This shave cream takes just a dab to become a rich lather that makes shaving a pleasure. After shaving, if you still feel a rough spot, some warm water applied to the area will result in more lather so you can tidy up.  I&#x27;ve used this product for years and learned a little bit goes a long way, works best of any I&#x27;ve ever used and I solidly recommend it.  For me, it is the best on the market.</li>
    <li> Nice rich lather, a little goes a long ways. Light pleasant scent.</li>
    <li> This is lasting me so long.. lol</li>
    <li> Bought this for my boyfriend as a Christmas gift after reading other good reviews of the product.  It foams up really nicely and gives him a good shave.  I&#x27;d classify him as pretty picky, but he&#x27;s a happy customer when it comes to this shaving cream.</li>
    <li> Nice and creamy; allows for closer shave. A little water on the face, a thin film of cream and a great shave. Use with a Fusion razor and that is about as good as it gets.</li>
    <li> This product is effective, it gives you a clean smooth shave.  I find that it does reduce irritation on sensitive skin.  The downfall of this product is the smell.  It is overly strong on use, and not a pleasant natural smell.  I would not buy again.  Also the product looked as if it had been opened previously.  There was product on the side of the tub, and it wasn&#x27;t sealed.</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my husband due to the glowing reviews but he has stopped using it because it clogs up his razor too much after the first pass or two. He uses a very modest amount as suggested but said that it was extending his shaving time too much despite liking the end result.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t really soothe the skin at all and my razor tends to grab a lot more when i use this. There&#x27;s little to no softening of coarse stubble.</li>
    <li> So slick, that it almost makes it *more* difficult to shave. No comparison to the crappy $1-3 shaving creams you buy at your local big box store. Combined with soft water, it takes a little while just to rinse it out.</li>
    <li> This stuff is better than TOBS. It&#x27;s very smooth and lathers nicely. My razor glides over my face better with this Maca Root cream than with any other shaving creams I have used. I will buy this from now on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Smell is kind of flowerish. Not too strong though. You won&#x27;t shave with it then end up smelling like a woman for the rest of the day.</li>
    <li> I love this product and it helps with razor burn. My only complaint is that it is not offered in a squeeze bottle like my last purchase of this product (from another source) so I can&#x27;t use a sparingly as I would like.</li>
    <li> Lathers up rich and creamy. Gives a great shave.</li>
    <li> I was initially skeptical of switching from Art of Shaving, but this stuff is great. Doesn&#x27;t clog your razor, smells great, and doesn&#x27;t cause me any skin problems.</li>
    <li> smells great and shaves very nicely.  I used this for my disabled son, it helps shaving him much more smooth and has a great smell.</li>
    <li> My girls bought this for me from the mall and I have been replenishing on Amazon.  If you are moving to this from canned shaving cream, take note - you will use much less of this if you first wet your beard (I splash on hot water from the sink).  When I first started using this product, I was not doing that, and ended up applying too much, fouling the razor and wasting product.  The accompany after-shave balm is also very nice...</li>
    <li> Awesome,  will never use shaving cream again.</li>
    <li> My husband loves this stuff! Smells yummy and gives him a close shave!</li>
    <li> This was purchased for my husband. He has sensitive skin and has a hard time finding products that work for him. He really is impressed with this product and plans to purchase again.</li>
    <li> This is a very different shaving crème.  I had never gotten any shaving soap from the Body Shop but I&#x27;m glad I tried this one.  I like the aroma plus I am able to whip up a thick, lubricating lather without any effort at all.  Try this soap; I think you&#x27;ll like it.</li>
    <li> I will never use the crap in an are-sol can ever again. I&#x27;m so glad I found this stuff to go with my new safety razor. I just wish someone would have told me shaving could be so much better instead of using crap products like Gillete for so long!</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t work any better then those $4 store shelf gel.  I compare it with gel because it is using more like a gel.  One thing I really don&#x27;t like about it is that it ended up with a whole bunch gongs in my electric foil shave and my face which takes an annoyingly effort to wash off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Body shop usually has some really smooth massage stuff in a bottle, smooth oil I believe is what it called, that works better with electric foil shaver.  This seems as they just mix some shaving cream and some other ingredients into it and call it a new product.  Will not touch it again.</li>
    <li> Been using this for years.  Good stuff!</li>
    <li> This cream is excellent!  I get a close shave with no nicks or razor burn.  I also get more than one shave per blade now!</li>
    <li> Works very well and smells very nice. Always get a smooth shave with this and it&#x27;s not too hard to whip up with my badger.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful shaving cream!!!!! I saw it on Amazon for less than $14 and got Prime shipping!! It usually sells for $18 in the store. It has a wonderful scent, lasts a long time. I use a double edge razor and a brush. I have used the  Taylor Bond shaving creams and like them also, but this is my shaving cream of choice.</li>
    <li> Smells amazing and last a long time</li>
    <li> Very good protection with a pleasant scent. I will purchase this again.</li>
    <li> My husband loves this cream and it has helped his face stay bump free and very soft. He has sensitive skin. The smell is very nice too.</li>
    <li> Nice shave cream.keep in mind this is NOT a soap. It comes as a thick cream in the container.I liked this stuff and it wasn&#x27;t that expensive. Easy to lather, smooth shave,scent was a little perfumey for my tatsye otherwise happy with this shave cream.</li>
    <li> Once again Amazon comes through with a fantastic price and delivery.  I highly recommend this product for any one with dry skin.  My only comment to the consumer,  Less than a pea size amount in the palm of the hand, sprinkle water on it and rub both palms together will give you an ample amount of suds to complete a shave.  You will like this product.  Six.3 fluid ounces will last me more than 18 months.</li>
    <li> This is the best stuff, have tried others but nothing is this good,</li>
    <li> Use the product all the time and love it    Received great service    Had a problem and the seller corrected everything</li>
    <li> Nice, smells good, provides good coverage and lubrication. Makes a stout lather.</li>
    <li> I love to try different shaving creams and I have to say this is one of the best if not the best that I have ever tried.</li>
    <li> I have bought this product before and I love it.&lt;br /&gt;It looses a star because it is not offered in a tube anymore. This hard round container is not very good for travelling</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for years to shave my legs and arms.  It&#x27;s think and creamy when applied and makes razor shaving a snap.  Plus, it&#x27;s cruelty free - that is no animal testing for the product or any of the ingredients used in it.  The Body Shop is well known for it&#x27;s cruelty free products.  I don&#x27;t like all of their products but this is one of the great ones.  Oh, and it lasts almost forever!</li>
    <li> Best shave soap/cream I&#x27;ve found.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a better shaving cream. Normal brands at stores are basic...not very moisturizing...not very slick when shaved with. I used a high quality shaving scrub. But it dried my face out with the exfoliating affect. This new purchase has been great. Smells good...not over powering; clean smell. The shave is slick...smooth. Does not overdry skin. A little used...goes a long ways. Very happy with purchase. Will buy again!!</li>
    <li> I will never go back to regular shaving cream. The smallest amount protects my face and makes for a fast, close, and easy shave.</li>
    <li> After decades of using regular canned shaving cream I tried this and I like the way it feels. Don&#x27;t forget you&#x27;ll need a brush to apply it, then recommend a moisturizing after shave.</li>
    <li> Great scent, fantastic lather and great slickness. It&#x27;s always in my line up.</li>
    <li> Never saw it. It was a gift to a friend.</li>
</ol>
