    <li> This is the best mousse I have tried for fine thinning hair.  It is nit too stiff like some mousse can be.</li>
    <li> My first time buying- will buy again. I like it! It&#x27;s nice and light, doesn&#x27;t weigh down my very thin hair, and has a frsh almost minty smell to it. I&#x27;m not so sure that my hair looks &#x27;thicker&#x27;, but it does hold nicely and has plenty of body and bounce!</li>
    <li> the moose was disappointing for me. It dried my hair out and made it hard to style. I found it to be too stiff for my fine hair</li>
    <li> Arrived quickly and exactly as expected.</li>
    <li> I use this with the Bosley shampoo, conditioner and hairspray.  They all make my hair much fuller and I will continue to use them.</li>
    <li> I bought this along with a starter pack of Bosley products.  Works great for styling curly hair with a diffuser.</li>
    <li> great for volume and body.  Works great for my fine hair.</li>
    <li> I am quite disappointed by all the Bosely products I purchased. The only difference between this mousse and my other mousse was the price. Very disappointing. Didn&#x27;t work at all.</li>
    <li> This is pretty good mousse for my  shorter hair , you only need a small amount for nice shine &amp; volume.It has a light &amp;#34;minty&amp;#34; fragrance. Some other brands I&#x27;ve tried have very heavy or fruity smells which I really don&#x27;t like.</li>
    <li> Does wonders with my hair it&#x27;s so fine this helps control it.</li>
    <li> I found this works best for my hair.  I have fine hair and it helps when styling it.  I would recommend this to others.</li>
    <li> I ordered the mousse. The invoice says mousse. The bottle I received was hairspray which I decided to keep. Besides smelling horrible, it works great.</li>
    <li> I have suffered with fine, thinning hair as long as I can remember. My hair stylist recommended this to me and I love it!! I lose less hair and my hair seems fuller. I have used the entire product line and have been very happy with all of it. The hair spray stinks, however.</li>
    <li> Assists with thickening hair and protecting color.  Suggest using a blow dryer to amplify the effect.  Requires very little product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s Okay, I see no purpose for me; maybe it would be useful for someone with long hair.  I will use it more often once my hair become longer.</li>
    <li> Gives my hair a lot of body.</li>
    <li> is light and works very well.</li>
    <li> It does what it says, volume with no itching or flaking of the scalp! Easy to use and I will buy it again!</li>
    <li> I have been using the Bosley products for about a year now and have been very satisfied with the result I am getting.  I plan to continue to use their products.</li>
    <li> Love this mousse.  Had used it before. Will buy it again.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent product.....and most reasonably priced on Amazon.  I compared prices even directly from the manufacturer and Amazon has the best prices.  I was told by others that this product prevents your hair from falling out at such a fast rate as normal...therefore making your hair thicker and fuller.  I have been using it for a couple of months now and found it to be true.  My hair looks better and fuller than ever before.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t believe how much this has helped my thinning hair look thicker! Buy this if you are a woman with thinning hair! It really works.</li>
    <li> The shampoo, conditioner and thickening treatment work great but the mousse doesn&#x27;t make my hair easy to comb. I end up with tangles in my hair that are difficult to get out and I&#x27;ve never had that problem before. I just use a different mousse that makes my hair slick enough to comb through without pulling it out.</li>
    <li> Got it on time. A great product.</li>
    <li> Love this mousse. It makes my hair thicker and the style holds so much better. Plan to buy another for my sister. Have told several friends about it. Thanks also for the great price. They sell it on a shopping network for much more.</li>
    <li> What a waste of money!  Forget about buying this and save your money.</li>
    <li> It makes my hair tangle more.  I am losing about the same amount of hair when I try to pick it out.  I have returned to my old conditiioner &amp; detangler.</li>
    <li> Product came as pictured with fast shipping! Thank you.</li>
    <li> It has not even been a month and I can tell a BIG difference !!!</li>
    <li> This product adds volume to limp hair and helps me create the spiked style I want.BOSLEY VOLUMIZING &amp; THICKENING MOUSSE</li>
    <li> It is good but I used too much, which tool longer time to dry and felt sticky. Would suggest that a little of this product goes a long way.</li>
    <li> Bosley products work well for my fine soft hair. I&#x27;m wavy, even curly in hot, humid weather, but cool, dry days leave me limp.&lt;br /&gt;I also like wash and wear hair and refuse to blow dry or do any of the tricks my stylist pushes on me. I put this mousse on damp hair, style it and tweak as it dries.For me that works. Last shampoo I used too much and thought my hair would be stiff, but by the second day it acted as a thickener and just gave me more body. I like this product. I&#x27;d say for cheekbone length hair, a golf ball sized pump will do the job of moderate control.</li>
    <li> Adds fullness to my thin, lifeless hair. Results last all day. I use this with the leave-in nourisher.</li>
    <li> It leaves my hair feeling stiff especially after I applied the thickening treatment. I&#x27;m not sure if this product is doing any good.</li>
    <li> I have only been using this product for a few days. It is the best mousse I have ever tried. I have thin fine hair and it adds a lot of volume to my hair. I would definitely buy it again!</li>
    <li> So far this product is working great for me! Glad I tried it</li>
    <li> no fragrance,. Perfect!</li>
    <li> I ordered this product because I was trying to repair my hair following chemo. I was using a similar product which after a long time managed to stop my hair from falling out but I was looking for more, the fullness I&#x27;d had before. So I ordered this product and in a short while my hair started falling out again. Keep in mind my situation may be different than many others but I feel that my purpose is what the product was advertised for.</li>
    <li> I dont see the same results as with the hair spray from the same brand. It seems like any other product sold at pharmacies or supermarkets.</li>
    <li> My BF has been trying the whole bosley system for a couple years now.  At first, we did notice some fine baby hairs... but he gave up with the system just this month.</li>
    <li> Immediate results. It brought life back to my hair. Much thicker hair now. And my color lasted longer between appointments. I love it! Thank you so much Bosley.</li>
    <li> This products does just what it says; makes your hair feel thicker and holds your style!</li>
