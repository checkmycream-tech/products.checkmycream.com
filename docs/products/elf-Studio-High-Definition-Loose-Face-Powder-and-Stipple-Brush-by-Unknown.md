      <li>elf HD powder is, for the price, an excellent product.  </li>
      <li>and it does a great job of creating a flawless make up</li>
      <li>I thought this would be great to use to set my highlight</li>
      <li>However the powder is great quality,</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t cover all the uses, but for example, it is great for the Wayne Goss Foundation trick and eliminating undereye creasing.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Great for girls who highlight/contour.</li>
      <li>Love this!!</li>
      <li>Otherwise very nice.</li>
      <li>Just as good as MUF HD powder.</li>
      <li>Because this is a good product..</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m very satisfied with this purchase.</li>
      <li>I loved the stippling brush, it&#x27;s great for foundation because it lightly distributes the product all around your face.</li>
      <li>OMG I love this powder!  </li>
      <li>Instead, I use it as a finishing powder, just a light application to seal in my makeup after I&#x27;ve finished everything and, for that purpose, it is absolutely AMAZING!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m so happy it&#x27;s saving me so much money!  </li>
      <li>Love the brush for applying foundation.</li>
      <li>I love this brush.</li>
      <li>LOVE</li>
      <li>Love this powder.  </li>
      <li>I use it for cream blush and liquid highlighter mostly.</li>
      <li>I love the finish it gives me after I have applied all my makeup.  </li>
      <li>but the loose powder is wonderful.  </li>
      <li>- I am extremely fair and if I apply too much it does make me look ghostly.</li>
      <li>so why not rate it so others can enjoy it..</li>
      <li>However, you should use a light hand with it</li>
      <li>The powder is so light on my skin</li>
      <li>All it takes for a flawless finish is a fluffy powder brush.  </li>
      <li>I will definitely be buying more of this powder and highly recommend it!!! :)</li>
      <li>The great thing is that it hold my look throughout the entire work day which normally I would have to touch up my face.  </li>
      <li>My makeup stays fresh for hours.  </li>
      <li>I look beautiful in my pictures, hardly see my wrinkles.  </li>
      <li>Works just as good as make up forever&#x27;s HD powder at half the cost.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s okay for sensitive skin , but doesn&#x27;t do a whole lot for shine.</li>
      <li>The brush works just as well as my old MAC one that broke and bought this b/c I needed a cheap brush because I was in a pinch at the time.</li>
      <li>The stipple brush is ok, just not very dense -</li>
      <li>I am mostly a high end makeup girl but the E.L.F products are really impressing me.</li>
      <li>Clearly I need to learn how to use it!</li>
      <li>I bought this powder and brush set online because there&#x27;s no Target near me.</li>
      <li>The powder, on the other hand, is good for setting your makeup without making you look heavy; I&#x27;m not a fan of loose powder</li>
      <li>and she said not to waste your money on the MUF, that ELF&#x27;s powder was exactly the same thing.</li>

<li> /&gt;The brush, however, is cheap and useless.  </li>
<li> I use a big fluffy brush to apply it evenly over my face.&lt;br /&gt;The brush I use for foundation application instead of the powder</li>
<li> I have other elf brushes that do not have this issue.  </li>
<li> Other brushes seemed to give me a heavy finish which I hated because it didn&#x27;t made me look natural, but since this one has less hairs, it doesn&#x27;t take as much product.</li>
<li> Honestly not sure what to do with this.</li>
<li> Not sure why I got it...</li>
<li> It is not perfectly milled, but if you dispense into the lid and use from there, the larger particles will self-sort out.  </li>
<li> Not many products do though.</li>
<li> You can hardly tell it&#x27;s there.  </li>
<li> It hasn&#x27;t broken me out at all.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I thought this would be great to use to set my highlight but it just turns it white.</li>
    <li> I bought this because I needed a translucent powder and it came with the stipple brush which mine had just broke so it was perfect timing. The brush works just as well as my old MAC one that broke and bought this b/c I needed a cheap brush because I was in a pinch at the time. I was planning on buying another MAC one but why spend the money when this one works just as well. The powder is so light on my skin I couldn&#x27;t even feel it and it gave me what I needed and wanted perfectly. I am mostly a high end makeup girl but the E.L.F products are really impressing me. I will definitely be buying more of this powder and highly recommend it!!! :)</li>
    <li> I was only thinking I order the brush but the loose powder is wonderful.  I love the finish it gives me after I have applied all my makeup.  The great thing is that it hold my look throughout the entire work day which normally I would have to touch up my face.  Will definitely reorder the loose powder again.</li>
    <li> Works just as good as make up forever&#x27;s HD powder at half the cost. Would totally recommend it to anyone!!</li>
    <li> Just as good as MUF HD powder. Love the brush for applying foundation.</li>
    <li> Because this is a good product.. so why not rate it so others can enjoy it.. I wear this myself</li>
    <li> elf HD powder is, for the price, an excellent product.  It is not perfectly milled, but if you dispense into the lid and use from there, the larger particles will self-sort out.  I can&#x27;t cover all the uses, but for example, it is great for the Wayne Goss Foundation trick and eliminating undereye creasing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brush, however, is cheap and useless.  I have other elf brushes that do not have this issue.  I recommend buying the powder only.</li>
    <li> I bought this powder and brush set online because there&#x27;s no Target near me. However the powder is great quality, my foundation and concealer stay on all day. It hasn&#x27;t broken me out at all. I use a big fluffy brush to apply it evenly over my face.&lt;br /&gt;The brush I use for foundation application instead of the powder and it does a great job of creating a flawless make up look. I&#x27;m very satisfied with this purchase.</li>

    <li> I loved the stippling brush, it&#x27;s great for foundation because it lightly distributes the product all around your face. Other brushes seemed to give me a heavy finish which I hated because it didn&#x27;t made me look natural, but since this one has less hairs, it doesn&#x27;t take as much product. The powder, on the other hand, is good for setting your makeup without making you look heavy; I&#x27;m not a fan of loose powder but I&#x27;m learning how to apply this one without a problem, can&#x27;t complain</li>
    <li> I look beautiful in my pictures, hardly see my wrinkles.  Love this powder.  I am 61.</li>
    <li> OMG I love this powder!  It has replaced my $34 Urban Decay powder!  I saw a YouTube video review where the makeup guru was comparing MakeUpForever&#x27;s HD powder with ELF and she said not to waste your money on the MUF, that ELF&#x27;s powder was exactly the same thing. And after having used both, I heartily agree.  This powder is invisible on the skin.  It doesn&#x27;t change the shade of my foundation, it simply sets my makeup for the day.  You can hardly tell it&#x27;s there.  And there is a lot of product in the jar, unlike UD or MUF.  All it takes for a flawless finish is a fluffy powder brush.  My makeup stays fresh for hours.  I only wish ELF made it in a pressed powder form.  This is a HG product for me.  You can get this powder at Target for $6 or if you have Amazon Prime.  I&#x27;m so happy it&#x27;s saving me so much money!  I heartily recommend this product.</li>
    <li> VERY white powder, so you have to apply it sparingly. Otherwise very nice.</li>
    <li> Honestly not sure what to do with this. Not sure why I got it... It&#x27;s white. Clearly I need to learn how to use it!</li>
    <li> Flawless finish! LOVE</li>
    <li> I love this brush. It can be used with liquid, cream or powder products. The bristles are soft but firm enough to work well with cream foundation. I intend to purchase the smaller size of this brush.</li>
    <li> Not the best quality. After applying lightly it left my face looking ghostly and didn&#x27;t blend well. The container spills even though the lid is on.</li>
    <li> I got these products individually off of the ELF website ($3 for the Stipple brush and $6 for the HD Powder).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have all three versions of the HD powder (translucent, corrective yellow and shimmer). It&#x27;s great! It leaves your face looking absolutely flawless! However, you should use a light hand with it and I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it as a setting powder - I am extremely fair and if I apply too much it does make me look ghostly. Instead, I use it as a finishing powder, just a light application to seal in my makeup after I&#x27;ve finished everything and, for that purpose, it is absolutely AMAZING! I will repurchase this over and over again, although one container lasts forever ($6 on the ELF website). The stipple brush is ok, just not very dense - I use it for cream blush and liquid highlighter mostly.</li>
    <li> Love this!! Totally softens/blurs. Great for girls who highlight/contour.</li>
    <li> this is the perfect translucent powder for setting under eye concealer AND putting on blotted lipstick to make it matte. will repurchase when I run out</li>
    <li> I like the sheerness of it.</li>
