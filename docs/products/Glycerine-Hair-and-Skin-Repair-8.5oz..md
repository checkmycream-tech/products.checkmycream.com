      <li>i gotta stock upon some more fore the summmer time.</li>
      <li>This is better than any lotion or lotion/glycerine mixture I have ever tried.  </li>
      <li>Love all zymox  products.  </li>
      <li>This glycerin is thicker than what I normally use, it will be great in winter when my skin is drier than in summer.</li>
      <li>I mix this with my leave-in conditioner great for keeping my color treated natural hair healthy.</li>
      <li>So far, I liked the product and find it to be superior quality.</li>
      <li>This is a great product for natural hair.</li>
      <li>I use this for my skin and most importantly my hair.</li>
      <li>it makes my skin smooth and look healthy.</li>
      <li>However: sticky, doesn&#x27;t spread that easily, takes a while to absorb.</li>
      <li>After just one use, I have noticed a huge change in my hair&#x27;s texture and moisture retention.</li>
      <li>My skin has been smooth all winter.</li>
      <li>Definitely worth purchasing!</li>
      <li>Just as I expected it to be &amp; great packaging</li>
      <li>The price is more than reasonable and the quantity is justifiable.  </li>
      <li>I really liked that this product was so natural.</li>
      <li>Again, thanks Amazon for offering products to consumers that are economical, authentic, and user friendly.</li>
      <li>This is probably the most natural product at the store.</li>
      <li>i abosolutely love this product it keeps my hair and my ruff skin amazinglly soft.</li>
      <li>My wife and I have spent a fair amount of money on skin care products over the years with marginal results.  </li>
      <li>I recieved my items right away.  </li>
      <li>IS VERY SOFT AND MANAGEABLE!!!</li>
      <li>THIS PRODUCT IS EXACTLY WHAT</li>
      <li>Ordering more as soon as possible!!!</li>
      <li>Most body lotions claim to have moisturizing agents but they usually leave my skin wanting more.</li>
      <li>This, and there whole line of products worked!</li>
      <li>My mother is responsible for that!</li>
      <li>My skin is super sensitive so it may just be me.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t use it during the day, except I might on my face because for some reason it sinks in there much more readily.</li>
      <li>This really helps.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know if I really needed this.  </li>
      <li>I have VERY course and kinky hair.  </li>
      <li>but I took off one star because the flip top cap does not snap closed.</li>
      <li>This works like a charm, add a generous amount (but not too much) to your regular body lotion, give it a little shake to distribute the oil evenly and you are good to go.</li>
      <li>The bottle arrived with tape across the cap so the company must be aware of the issue but hasn&#x27;t taken action to replace the defective caps.</li>
      <li>but I have high hopes for it.</li>
      <li>i live in ohio where we are not surrounded by water</li>
      <li>i am currently in a dry climate but you wouldnt even be able to tell because I mix my daily lotion with Africare glycerin and my skin is soft.</li>
      <li>This stuff does a far better job than anything we&#x27;ve used in the past and at a fraction of the price.  </li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t used this product much, so I can&#x27;t tell what it actually does for my hair.</li>
      <li>I add it to my lotion and it makes my skin soft.</li>
      <li>again in all of the Youtube videos I watch on natural hair care, so I decided to give it a try.</li>
      <li>The combination helps to retain moisture in my natural hair as well helps with curl definition.</li>
      <li>The only reason I&#x27;m not giving 5 starts is because it&#x27;s only my first use so far</li>
      <li>I have only been using this a few weeks now and so far it seems to work really well.</li>
      <li>I use it after a shower and it really softens my skin that can get rough and dry during winter.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s smooth, odorless, but a little sticky (just a little, not enough not to use it).</li>

<li> This stuff works wonders for my skin and especially my dry hair.</li>
<li> Any itchy or burning spots are calmed down by rubbing a little of this in.</li>

<li> It does wonders for my hair and skin, and it&#x27;s so thick, one bottle will last me and my sister at least another month and a half.</li>
<li> I will write another review in a few months.  </li>
<li> I would recommend it to anyone who has an issue with hard to manage kinky hair.  </li>
<li> I just started using it on my hair, so I am not sure how it&#x27;s working yet!</li>
<li> You can&#x27;t go wrong with this purchase.</li>

    <li> love it worked well making bath salt for Christmas gifts.  Great for skin and hair</li>
    <li> Rosewater &amp; Glycerin an ageless facial conditioner wonder worker!</li>
    <li> For the last two weeks my daughter hair has improved.</li>
    <li> It is the first I used on my hair and worked the best. I wish they had bigger bottle and prime eligible shipping.</li>
    <li> Mixes with any regular hair or skin product wet or dry&lt;br /&gt;Great value, long use for only a small amount needed</li>
    <li> This glycerin is thicker than what I normally use, it will be great in winter when my skin is drier than in summer.</li>
    <li> I also use this on my face my arms and my legs along with my lotions my skin feels great</li>
    <li> THIS PRODUCT IS EXACTLY WHAT I WAS LOOKING FOR I COMBINE IT WITH OTHER OILS AND BUTTERS FOR MY HAIR AND MY HAIR IS VERY SOFT AND MANAGEABLE!!!</li>
    <li> I have been using this oil for over a month on my skin and hair an it makes my skin smooth and look healthy. I will definitely order this product again</li>
    <li> I like this product,I&#x27;ve used it for one week, it works and my skin goes better! I&#x27;ll be back, thank you!</li>
    <li> i abosolutely love this product it keeps my hair and my ruff skin amazinglly soft. i gotta stock upon some more fore the summmer time. i live in ohio where we are not surrounded by water but when u put some glycerin in your hair it draws moisture from the air to your hair so it can remain moisturized throught the day. and the same for the skin. love love love!</li>
    <li> I use this for my skin and most importantly my hair. I put it on my scalp that helps with itching and dandruff.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a white girl but I don&#x27;t think glycerin knows the difference. What I like: overnight skin and hair conditioning, no fragrance, no animal testing. However: sticky, doesn&#x27;t spread that easily, takes a while to absorb. I don&#x27;t use it during the day, except I might on my face because for some reason it sinks in there much more readily. This is a good treatment for when you go to bed or if you have nowhere to go that day. This is probably the most natural product at the store. I won&#x27;t say it&#x27;s my HG but I appreciate the results. Definitely less heavy than vaseline.</li>
    <li> Should get 6 stars.  Love all zymox  products.  I am taking care of my mother&#x27;s elderly dog who had horrible skin problems.  This, and there whole line of products worked!</li>
    <li> I use this on my problem skin. Any itchy or burning spots are calmed down by rubbing a little of this in. It&#x27;s smooth, odorless, but a little sticky (just a little, not enough not to use it).</li>
    <li> Return it.  Never try it so can not tell about the product is good or not.  Try from another retail and it is good.</li>
    <li> I have VERY course and kinky hair.  NOTHING has moisturized my hair like this stuff!  I would recommend it to anyone who has an issue with hard to manage kinky hair.  It&#x27;s a great moisturizer thus promomting hair growth.</li>
    <li> This is a great product for natural hair. I use it in my oil and water mixtures for my dreadlocks!</li>
    <li> Great seller, great product, A++</li>
    <li> I am currently using retin-a, which SEVERELY dries out your skin. This really helps. One of my eyelids were so dry that I couldn&#x27;t blink properly. I tried to use my face moisturizer but that didn&#x27;t help at all. Out of impulse, I took this from my mom, which she uses for her hair, and I decided to apply it on my eyelids. It worked wonderfully. Great stuff.</li>
    <li> Great for skin! I add it to my lotion and no more rough skin especially on feet! Great product!&lt;br /&gt;Reccomend.</li>
    <li> Love this. Good job Hydrating my skin</li>
    <li> This stuff works wonders for my skin and especially my dry hair. I use it after a shower and it really softens my skin that can get rough and dry during winter. For my hair i use it to seal my ends after using my leave in conditioner and my hair is so soft and moisturize that i don&#x27;t need to put any other product in it. I love this stuff!</li>
    <li> I really liked that this product was so natural. It does wonders for my hair and skin, and it&#x27;s so thick, one bottle will last me and my sister at least another month and a half.</li>
    <li> Just as I expected it to be &amp; great packaging</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know if I really needed this.  I will use it to see the outcome.  I will write another review in a few months.  The arrival was timely.  I recieved my items right away.  Packaging was nice and neat too.</li>
    <li> The product is great but I took off one star because the flip top cap does not snap closed. The bottle arrived with tape across the cap so the company must be aware of the issue but hasn&#x27;t taken action to replace the defective caps.</li>
    <li> This is better than any lotion or lotion/glycerine mixture I have ever tried.  My skin has been smooth all winter.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t used this product much, so I can&#x27;t tell what it actually does for my hair. It feels good though.</li>
    <li> My hair loves it!!! The only product that makes my hair maintain its curl pattern. Ordering more as soon as possible!!!</li>
    <li> I have n&#x27;t tried any other brands. So far, I liked the product and find it to be superior quality.</li>
    <li> I have been adding glycerin to my body lotion for as long as I can remember. My mother is responsible for that! As a brown skin female the last thing you want is to look ashy. There is nothing more unattractive than that! Most body lotions claim to have moisturizing agents but they usually leave my skin wanting more. This works like a charm, add a generous amount (but not too much) to your regular body lotion, give it a little shake to distribute the oil evenly and you are good to go. Before you know it, your skin will be looking healthier than you have ever seen it.</li>
    <li> This product is great and is backing up its intended purposes.  The price is more than reasonable and the quantity is justifiable.  Again, thanks Amazon for offering products to consumers that are economical, authentic, and user friendly.</li>
    <li> I have only been using this a few weeks now and so far it seems to work really well. I have extremely dry skin during the winter, and this makes a difference. I just started using it on my hair, so I am not sure how it&#x27;s working yet!</li>
    <li> Love this product. i am currently in a dry climate but you wouldnt even be able to tell because I mix my daily lotion with Africare glycerin and my skin is soft.</li>
    <li> 100% glycerin is 100% glycerin. Didn&#x27;t have any issues at all with this product. I would buy this one again.</li>
    <li> I use this product with a mixture and grape seed oil and water to help.  The combination helps to retain moisture in my natural hair as well helps with curl definition.</li>
    <li> This product is great. I add it to my lotion and it makes my skin soft. It hasn&#x27;t caused any breakout and that makes it great for me.</li>
    <li> I tried this and it breaks me and make my skin feel sticky. It just didn&#x27;t work for me. My skin is super sensitive so it may just be me.</li>
    <li> I mix this with my leave-in conditioner great for keeping my color treated natural hair healthy. Adds great sheen and softness.</li>
    <li> I have enjoyed my products and will be ordering more of the Beyonce Pulse Eau De Parfum Spray for family members</li>
    <li> Excellent service and excellent product.  Will buy again.</li>
    <li> I have been seeing glycerine come up time and again in all of the Youtube videos I watch on natural hair care, so I decided to give it a try. I love it! After just one use, I have noticed a huge change in my hair&#x27;s texture and moisture retention. The only reason I&#x27;m not giving 5 starts is because it&#x27;s only my first use so far but I have high hopes for it. Definitely worth purchasing!</li>
