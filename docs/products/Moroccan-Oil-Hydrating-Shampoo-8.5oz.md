<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> was different than the other OILS i have had from salons, and it smelt very bad&lt;br /&gt;not the same product in stores</li>
    <li> My stylist recommended this shampoo (and the conditioner) and they are fantastic! I have straight hair and this shampoo makes my hair thicker and increases the volume. I have my hair colored professionally and this shampoo doesn&#x27;t strip the color. The conditioner is great also. I highly recommend both.</li>
    <li> My favorite shampoo.  I would recommend trying it at least, to see if it suits your particular hair.  I have thick hair, with blonde highlights, and this product leaves my hair in very good condition.</li>
    <li> hard to watch at times but important to watch</li>
    <li> Received as promised!  Great product - have used for years!</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo.  It makes your hair feel full and not flat.  Perfect for girls with extensions.  I love it</li>
    <li> This shampoo is great and has a great fresh smell.</li>
    <li> I have been using Moroccan oil products for a long time. It is gentle on my highlighted hair and leaves a shine that enhances the color. Very good product.</li>
    <li> Excellent  I tried wen shampoo and was having bad hair days when I used this the first time it was so much better even better than my older shampoo</li>
    <li> This is the best hair product I&#x27;ve ever used. It has helped repair my damaged hair. Keeps my red hair color from washing out which is hard in general. I love it!</li>
    <li> Fantastic shampoo at a great rate. Thank you!</li>
    <li> Really didn&#x27;t do to my hair what the salon stuff did. Not sure why. Not bad and I enjoy the smell, but not what I was hoping for.</li>
    <li> Love how shiny my hair is after using this product.  Works best if used in conjunction with the conditioner!</li>
    <li> Perfect for dry and damaged hair. Has made my hair so much healthier and less frizzy. Might also have to do with the products I use after the shower but I still see results with just this product. I use the shampoo and conditioner together, and I highly recommend that because these products are meant to be used together and need to be because  together they reach the the full effect of this set.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one thing about the shampoo is that it is sulfate free, and it doesn&#x27;t lather up and get foamy like a regular shampoo. I have really greasy hair and need a good clean every time I was my hair (2-3 times a day). I need to mix this with a regular shampoo in order to get my hair cleaned. So please keep that in mind!</li>
    <li> I had been a big fan of the Moroccan Oil Moisture Repair shampoo and even the volume shampoo but this product is terrible. It made my hair feel dirty and dried out. Not sure if they changed the formula but I will not buy it again.</li>
    <li> Superb product for my son&#x27;s very curly hair...No frizz...very moisturizing...highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I really like this shampoo.  It makes my hair squeaky clean!</li>
    <li> We can not live without using this shampoo and conditioner in our house.  My daughter has very thick hair that tangles very easily.  When we use these products her hair does not get all tangled.</li>
    <li> Best shampoo I have ever used for my hair which is very fine.  Gives it great body.  I hope they never change the formula!  I received both shampoo and conditioner....they worked exactly like the products I bought from the salon.  After reading the one star reviews, I&#x27;m afraid to order</li>
    <li> Has a greasy feel to it and made my hair fall flatter than usual.  Great conditioner though.  Not worth the price.</li>
    <li> This product is highly recommended! My hair were all burned from the bleach but with this shampoo in 3-4 weeks wow really huge different! And also leaves your hair with an amazing scent !</li>
    <li> Have a Keratin treatment and the shampoo did not hydrated my hair.  After shampoo and conditioning with Moroccan Oil Hydrating, my hair was style frizzy. Not worth the money!</li>
    <li> it was recommended by my hair stylist after I have done keratin hair treatment. my hair seems to be dry around winter so i thought od buying it. it is very helpful and worth a try!</li>
    <li> I bought this because I have the oil. Thinking it was going to have a great effect on my hair, I was mistaken.</li>
    <li> Smells good and changes the texture of your hair by the first treatment. Believe it. I prefer to pay more for mine shampoo and conditioner because i know how much it has helped my hair.</li>
    <li> Great shampoo but the best mask conditioner leaves dry frizzy hair Like Mine soft and smooth</li>
    <li> Amazon put a picture of the shampoo and the conditioner together and I made a mistake and bought only the shampoo instead of buy both. Really desapoint with Amazon.</li>
    <li> This works so well with my hair. I have very long hair that tends to get dried out at the ends. This helps keep it hydrated and I don&#x27;t have to wash my hair as often. It also smells great!</li>
    <li> My favorite hair care brand, hands down. Purchased from amazon.com, not another seller, so I felt better about buying this online (some sellers will swap out some or all of an expensive product for something cheap...so your source matters). This was definitely the real deal, and a great price. Will be getting my moroccanoil fix from amazon.com from now it</li>
    <li> This shampoo is so good for damaged hair.My hair is not damaged but it gets dry.Smells so good too!</li>
    <li> A complete waste of money, made my hair hard and stiff, had to wash with another shampoo! I recommend designs essentials hydrating shampoo! A complete waste! I spent 25 dollars and want my money back! Im shocked it was so terrible!</li>
    <li> The shampoo has no lather, which I found disappointing. Very nice smell, however. Conditioner was very good. Would purchase conditioner again.</li>
    <li> Amazing. I used it as part of a hair treatment with another MoroccanOil products and loved the results.</li>
    <li> Funny after I ordered what the reviews stated was a conditioner and shampoo- and The picture was of Moroccan oil shampoo and the bottle of conditioner! Now the picture has changed to just the conditioner, which is all I received in the mail which I was LED to believe I was getting both products! I would&#x27;ve never bought from this company if I knew they&#x27;d change their picture of the item right after my purchase. DO NOT buy from them. I am an avid amazon shopper and am completely disgusted in the lie about this product which led me to purchase it. FAKE FAKE FAKE.</li>
    <li> Was looking for the product everywhere, and it was so easy to order and also, receive it in due time</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t understand why the photo has shampoo &amp; conditioner while it is ONLY a shampoo!! There is a contradiction between the photo, reviews and the product description! Isn&#x27;t it misleading? In some reviews it was mentioned both shampoo and conditioner!! I do not think that putting a photo of just one shampoo would be that difficult and also changing the reviews which are irrelevant with the product! I am disappointed!</li>
    <li> Delivered on time, product was as appeared.</li>
    <li> Keeps my hair silky shiny and strong. I will continue to buy through this avenue as it is convenient and speedy.</li>
    <li> Picture shows 2 bottles - shampoo and conditioner but actual product is only shampoo.  Fortunately I was able to cancel my order as I noticed it immediately</li>
    <li> Love it!Everytime I try another shampoo I always go back to moroccan oil hydrating.Makes my hair very healthy looking and pretty.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff let me start with that. The smell is awesome. My hair looks and smells great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shampoo when i first used it, thought i had grabbed the conditioner by mistake. it is very thick! it lathers nicely and smells great. That being said, I think the shampoo leaves a little to be desired by itself. After rinsing my hair felt  like straw. Definitely glad I bought the conditioner with the shampoo. The conditioner is fabulous! I don&#x27;t have to use tons to cover my hair and with only a minute of absorption my hair is soft and manageable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave this product only four stars for a couple of reasons. #1. The way my hair feels after using the shampoo, and #2. The cost. It is really expensive.</li>
    <li> I treat my hai with the same brand, but had never experienced the shampoo and conditioner.  I was a bit hesitant about the shampoo due to the reviews about it, but I had an excellent experience. My hair never shined like this, it is amazing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S.: I have a curly and colored hair.</li>
    <li> Fake!!  This is NOT Moroccan Oil Shampoo!&lt;br /&gt;Do not purchase!  Does not even have the same color or texture or smell of the real Moroccan Oil Shampoo!!  Do not buy!!!</li>
