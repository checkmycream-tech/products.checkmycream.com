### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>I touch up my boys lines and they look great all the time!  </li>
      <li>Was perfect.</li>
      <li>They are very good looking also.     </li>
      <li>Great product, works well.</li>
      <li>Great trimmer and great price</li>
      <li>Make it great for trimming beards.</li>
      <li>The three guides fits great and will not pop out.</li>
      <li>Great for shape ups.</li>
      <li>Great tool.</li>
      <li>Great trimmer.</li>
      <li>Great price.</li>
      <li>Excellent and easy to use.  </li>
      <li>The lady at the store laughed, and said they stopped stocking the Bling because everyone assumed it was junk because of the looks of it.</li>
      <li>for trimming necks or around ears - this is superior to every trimmer i have gotten the wife.  </li>
      <li>The performance has been extremely good, and I even shave my head with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Good product.</li>
      <li>I also liked the size I fits grate in my shaving kit and it has 3 size adapters encase</li>
      <li>Very cool!</li>
      <li>with that said, it&#x27;s does a great job and edging and getting a pretty close shave.  </li>
      <li>great for touch ups and very reliable</li>
      <li>Best purchase ever, when my current one goes out.</li>
      <li>Very light and easy to control.  </li>
      <li>If anyone knows of clipper blades that fit this model that are rust proof</li>
      <li>Come on Wahl, that&#x27;s just being cheap.  </li>
      <li>Worth the Price!</li>
      <li>I shaved my full beard and my full head of hair</li>
      <li>Much faster than my AA-operated Crest Spinbrush, for example, which gets arguably more use.</li>
      <li>A good option for travel, I suppose, if you&#x27;re going somewhere without power or with different outlets/voltages.  </li>
      <li>The first one I bought is still going strong after a year of use.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;d understand if this was a $12.00 quick clipper</li>
      <li>I like it better than my full size Wahl that is a plug in the new one</li>
      <li>Im a stylist/barber, bought these for fun and they never leave my station now.  </li>
      <li>( probably going to switch to rechargeable batteries), but definitely worth the cordless feature.</li>
      <li>but they came right out of the box so close to zero</li>
      <li>I dropped the first one on the bathroom floor and it never worked right again.</li>
      <li>as a hairdresser I know that companies like Wahl make good clippers that don&#x27;t rust and not for much more than I paid for this one but after ONE day left in the shower and NOT soaking in any water, hung upside down with the strap that&#x27;s included in the package I jump in the shower this afternoon and find the blades are both rusted already.  </li>
      <li>Thanks!</li>
      <li>When I first opened this trimmer I had to test out the power.</li>
      <li>Good close shave, use it on my face everyday, never grabs my skin.</li>
      <li>Its small yet powerful for its size and the fact that it runs on a single AA battery is even more amazing.</li>
      <li>The free flow motion from this cordless trimmer gives you more room to move it a around whether its turning it upside down or twisting it left and right.      </li>
      <li>The clipper itself clips very close</li>
      <li>liked it so much that I went back to Sally&#x27;s to get a second one to use at home instead of my Outliner II.</li>
      <li>The blades looked like they would cut very close and the wider blade looked like it would make the job quicker.</li>
      <li>It had more power than I expected.  </li>
      <li>It only uses one battery at a time, but it goes through it pretty quickly.  </li>
      <li>They feel solid and are precisely built and exactly the quality you would expect from professional Wahl trimmers.</li>
      <li>The only reason I rated them a 4/5 stars is because they showed up with signs of rust on the blade that i had to clean with oil.</li>
      <li>They cut very close to the edge which makes them great for trimming up around the ears and other tight areas</li>
      <li>The Wahl Bling Trimmer is a decent trimmer.  </li>
      <li>Light weight, holds very well in your hand as you trim your neck and other areas</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t think it would be powerful enough</li>
      <li>I love these clippers, they are actually a replacement set after my 5 year old pair finally wore out.</li>
      <li>I know that any self-respecting barber or stylist would look at the faux \\&quot;chrome\\&quot; on this little trimmer and assume it was junk, but it has been my favorite travel trimmer by far.</li>
      <li>For the price....what an amazing trimmer, blades cut close, but for an extra close cut where the hair flies off with almost no effort, I recommend getting a Double Wide Wahl T-blade, and be careful...</li>
      <li>I love and hate the battery feature because I go through batteries fairly easy</li>

<li> the Double Wide T blade set to zero overlap is sharp.</li>
<li> Still, a solid little trimmer.  </li>
<li> These little trimmers are the real deal and a serious tool for ultra close trims.</li>
<li> These trimmers are extremely lightweight but have enough power to cut thru a thick beard.</li>
<li> Yeah it&#x27;s a bit gimmicky...</li>
<li> so I like that at least.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> The Wahl Bling Trimmer is a decent trimmer.  I used it for my facial hair.  The Wahl Bling Trimmer does not shave as close as a razor.  It did last me for years and I shave every day.  I like the fact that it is battery operated.  The Wahl Bling Trimmer is comparable to the Andis T-Edjer II.</li>
    <li> Met all my expectations.</li>
    <li> When I first opened this trimmer I had to test out the power. So I tried to stop the blade but couldn&#x27;t. Great trimmer. Its small yet powerful for its size and the fact that it runs on a single AA battery is even more amazing. The three guides fits great and will not pop out. I was sold when I saw these trimmer for the fact that there wouldn&#x27;t be a cord in my way. Make it great for trimming beards. The free flow motion from this cordless trimmer gives you more room to move it a around whether its turning it upside down or twisting it left and right.      Another trimmer like this that I have is the 5 star version, the Wahl G-whiz trimmer. These two always get noticed by my customer when they are looking over at my clippers and trimmer.</li>
    <li> These are just like the larger Wahl Clippers except miniature. They feel solid and are precisely built and exactly the quality you would expect from professional Wahl trimmers. They are very good looking also.     I bought these for personal use and they have plenty of life per battery for my touch-ups. I know they adjust to zero overlap but they came right out of the box so close to zero why bother?     These little trimmers are the real deal and a serious tool for ultra close trims.</li>
    <li> Best purchase ever, when my current one goes out. Im buying another</li>
    <li> Hi all,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well as a hairdresser I know that companies like Wahl make good clippers that don&#x27;t rust and not for much more than I paid for this one but after ONE day left in the shower and NOT soaking in any water, hung upside down with the strap that&#x27;s included in the package I jump in the shower this afternoon and find the blades are both rusted already.  Come on Wahl, that&#x27;s just being cheap.  I&#x27;d understand if this was a $12.00 quick clipper but I&#x27;ve bought MANY clippers over the years less expensive than this that didn&#x27;t suffer with this glaring end user issue.  Shame on you!  The clipper itself clips very close so I like that at least.  Won&#x27;t be buying this one again though!  If anyone knows of clipper blades that fit this model that are rust proof let me know.  Thanks!</li>
    <li> Good close shave, use it on my face everyday, never grabs my skin. It does eat up batteries, buy rechargeables.</li>
    <li> I know that any self-respecting barber or stylist would look at the faux \\&quot;chrome\\&quot; on this little trimmer and assume it was junk, but it has been my favorite travel trimmer by far. At home I use an Andis Outliner II to shave my beard and head; so I&#x27;m used to something that performs well. I got my first Bling trimmer at Sally&#x27;s beauty supply just hoping to find something small that cut well. The blades looked like they would cut very close and the wider blade looked like it would make the job quicker. The performance has been extremely good, and I even shave my head with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I liked it so much that I went back to Sally&#x27;s to get a second one to use at home instead of my Outliner II. The lady at the store laughed, and said they stopped stocking the Bling because everyone assumed it was junk because of the looks of it. I told her how well it cuts, and I just got my second one on Amazon. The first one I bought is still going strong after a year of use.</li>
    <li> This trimmer is a lot smaller than I thought it would be.  It comes with a lanyard so you can literally where it around your neck like &#x60;bling&#x27;.  Yeah it&#x27;s a bit gimmicky...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But with that said, it&#x27;s does a great job and edging and getting a pretty close shave.  It does not come CLOSE to replacing a razor; I think a few reviewers said they didn&#x27;t have to do a real shave with this.  But I think that that&#x27;s an exaggeration.  Still, a solid little trimmer.  Great for shape ups.</li>
    <li> great for touch ups and very reliable</li>
    <li> These trimmers are extremely lightweight but have enough power to cut thru a thick beard. They cut very close to the edge which makes them great for trimming up around the ears and other tight areas</li>
    <li> Im a stylist/barber, bought these for fun and they never leave my station now.  I use them every day and when they burn out, i will replace.  I have dozens of clippers/trimmers, some &#x27;ultra close&#x27; for lining up and not ONE of those over $100 trimmers cuts as close as this bling.  cant say enough.  Get one, try it.  Heck, get 5.  Im buying them as a gift for my stylists</li>
    <li> I love these clippers, they are actually a replacement set after my 5 year old pair finally wore out. The only reason I rated them a 4/5 stars is because they showed up with signs of rust on the blade that i had to clean with oil. They function well; I guess they just came from a city by the ocean.</li>
    <li> It trims well, but I have noticed some trims are not as short as other people said it would be. I tend to have coarse hair and it definitely leaves some beard stubble. It runs on 1 AA battery and it lasts a long time! Very cool!</li>
    <li> I shaved my full beard and my full head of hair I didn&#x27;t think it would be powerful enough so I tried it and worked grate I just wish it was rechargeable but I will just have to get some rechargeable AA&#x27;s. I also liked the size I fits grate in my shaving kit and it has 3 size adapters encase I want to grow a beard again I like it better than my full size Wahl that is a plug in the new one is so much smaller with out sacrificing power.</li>
    <li> Great trimmer and great price this is my second. I dropped the first one on the bathroom floor and it never worked right again.</li>
    <li> Not a bling called something else but close enough</li>
    <li> Very light and easy to control.  It had more power than I expected.  I touch up my boys lines and they look great all the time!  Worth the Price!</li>
    <li> for trimming necks or around ears - this is superior to every trimmer i have gotten the wife.  the sides stick out a bit and not flush which helps with trimming.</li>
    <li> Great product, works well. I love and hate the battery feature because I go through batteries fairly easy ( probably going to switch to rechargeable batteries), but definitely worth the cordless feature. Good product.</li>
    <li> Great tool. Great price.</li>
    <li> Was perfect. Replaced one that was lost in a move.</li>
    <li> Excellent and easy to use.  Light weight, holds very well in your hand as you trim your neck and other areas</li>
    <li> A good option for travel, I suppose, if you&#x27;re going somewhere without power or with different outlets/voltages.  Otherwise I would just get a corded version.  It only uses one battery at a time, but it goes through it pretty quickly.  Much faster than my AA-operated Crest Spinbrush, for example, which gets arguably more use.</li>
    <li> For the price....what an amazing trimmer, blades cut close, but for an extra close cut where the hair flies off with almost no effort, I recommend getting a Double Wide Wahl T-blade, and be careful...the Double Wide T blade set to zero overlap is sharp.</li>
