      <li>not a matte finish but a nice, healthy glow....</li>
      <li>This face lotion is great for that fresh feeling.</li>
      <li>4 stars because I wish it had even more of a cool feeling!!</li>
      <li>It serves that purpose very well but works as a great multi-purpose cream as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>They love it</li>
      <li>Love this stuff.</li>
      <li>I love this moisturizer more then any face cream ive tried</li>
      <li>Good sized bottle, worth the money.</li>
      <li>I bought it at Nordstroms for $25 (plus $2 more for tax) for the 2.5 oz.  </li>
      <li>never felt more ripped off in my life?</li>
      <li>Guess I should have read item discription better</li>

      <li>This stuff is amazing, it really leaves your face clean and it smells good too.</li>
      <li>Clean, fresh and not grease!!</li>
      <li>/&gt;It is super refreshing and wakes you up when you put it on.</li>
      <li>My face feels more energized and fresh after using it.</li>
      <li>This lotion is fantastic, but if you buy it you&#x27;re getting ripped</li>
      <li>This one has a nice scent, but it&#x27;s got a much greasier feel than the MenScience.</li>
      <li>I tried this and the MenScience Advanced Face Lotion.</li>
      <li>But other than that, seems like a good product, and I love Amazon :)</li>
      <li>/&gt;this is five stars, makes your face look more vibrant before going out , feeling fresh, and confident, i absolutley love it&lt;</li>
      <li>/&gt;However, the pricing here is a complete scam: on Kiehl&#x27;s own site [...]</li>
      <li>/&gt;i must have this everytime before i go out and right out of the shower and after a shave&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I love Kiehl&#x27;s and especially Facial Fuel Moisture Treatement that I have been using for years.</li>
      <li>First thing - Don&#x27;t buy here, it retails for $20 at the manufacturer&#x27;s website.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I apply a much smaller amount on the top of my face than I do on the bottom of my face.  </li>
      <li>I love Kiehls and this is NOTHING about he product, but in fact about the retailer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can buy the same product direct from Kiehls for $21!!</li>
      <li>you can get a 4.8oz for the price of this 2.5oz, and they even offer free shipping above $50 (the shipping charges on this item are also a real rip-off).&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
      <li>but much cheaper--</li>
      <li>I have oily to normal skin with a light beard and find that facial fuel helps reduce the itchiness.</li>
      <li>I foyu have men (or older teens) in your life</li>
      <li>so my teens and twenty two year old like it!</li>
      <li>have both products in front of me, and they are chemically identical, and look and smell exactly the same in my hand.</li>
      <li>Either way, it definitely costs more than other products, but I received this as part of a Christmas gift pack and, four days later, am ready to swear by it.</li>
      <li>Dont buy this 35$ for .5 oz with shipping wow</li>
      <li>I use it nearly every day.  </li>
      <li>don&#x27;t have a lot of experience with other products, so I can&#x27;t compare, but for the money it is definitely worth it.</li>
      <li>My skin is a bit sensitive and I especially like that there is no heavy fragrance.</li>
      <li>I love the way it has all these little particles that scrub my face and exfoliate, and I enjoy the faint scent.</li>

<li> I&#x27;m not sure how, but it almost feels like mint hits your skin.&lt;br</li>
<li> It&#x27;s very expensive to purchase and is cheaper on Nordstroms website for a larger quantity.</li>
<li> Helps after shaving and in the winter with harsh cold temps.</li>
<li> : I rate it on a par with Biotherm&#x27;s, which is almost impossible to find in the USA.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> My husband loves this product, but it&#x27;s a bit pricey, so when I saw the review saying that the product was the same as a Loreal product, I ordered the Loreal. Definitely NOT the same product. Don&#x27;t be fooled. One reason my husband loves the Keihl&#x27;s is because it doesn&#x27;t have a heavy scent. The Loreal product is so heavily perfumed that I can&#x27;t even be in the same room when my husband is wearing it. It&#x27;s like a overscented candle. Does it work the same? Maybe, but were going back to Kiehls.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing, it really leaves your face clean and it smells good too. You only need to use about the size of a nickel at a time.</li>
    <li> I love Kiehls and this is NOTHING about he product, but in fact about the retailer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can buy the same product direct from Kiehls for $21!! or the larger one for $30&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DON&#x27;T BUY HERE.....</li>
    <li> I will just say this product works!  I have not tried the other item that some indicate is the same and it might be.  For me, when you have dry and difficult skin problems and you find something that really works, just buy it!</li>
    <li> This face lotion is great for that fresh feeling. Ideal for that out of the shower freshness!! Clean, fresh and not grease!! not a matte finish but a nice, healthy glow....for me this a great finish to being clean! 4 stars because I wish it had even more of a cool feeling!!</li>
    <li> Just wanted to respond to the reviewer who felt that the L&#x27;Oreal Mens Expert moisturizer was the same but much cheaper-- if you look at the PER OUNCE cost, they are about the same, with the Kiehls possibly costing less give or take a dollar or two. L&#x27;oreal is about $12 for 1.7 oz, whereas this is $29 for over 4 oz. Either way, it definitely costs more than other products, but I received this as part of a Christmas gift pack and, four days later, am ready to swear by it.</li>
    <li> This lotion is fantastic, but if you buy it you&#x27;re getting ripped off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is the identical lotion as L&#x27;Oreal Men&#x27;s Expert Hydra-Energetic Anti-Stress &amp; Fatigue All-In-One Moisturizer, which costs a fraction of the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B00160Q0GQ LOREAL Mens Expert SPF-15 Hydra-Energetic,Anti-Stress &amp; Fatigue All-in-one Moisturizer - 1.6 Oz]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;L&#x27;Oreal owns Keihls.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have both products in front of me, and they are chemically identical, and look and smell exactly the same in my hand.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. Makes your face feel smooth and smell great. I use this every morning after I get a good shave in.</li>
    <li> Note: I didn&#x27;t buy through Amazon (but I should have!).  I purchased this in Orlando FL as an impulse buy at the mall (over payed).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a great moisturizer.  I use it nearly every day.  Just enough fragrance to wake me up in the morning.  Supposedly it&#x27;s got a bunch of good ingredients.  All I know is that my face feels good when I use it.  And it continues to feel good throughout the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this not specifically as a moisturizer.  I was looking for a good after shave balm.  It serves that purpose very well but works as a great multi-purpose cream as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have combination skin.  I apply a much smaller amount on the top of my face than I do on the bottom of my face.  That method works well for me.</li>
    <li> Kiehls facial fuel energizing moisture treatment for men is as the names suggests, an energizing and invigorating boost for the face.</li>
    <li> Dont buy this 35$ for .5 oz with shipping wow never felt more ripped off in my life? Guess I should have read item discription better</li>
    <li> I love Facial Fuel, it&#x27;s an excellent moisturizer and I&#x27;ve been using it for years: I rate it on a par with Biotherm&#x27;s, which is almost impossible to find in the USA.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, the product itself, gets a 5-star.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, the pricing here is a complete scam: on Kiehl&#x27;s own site [...] you can get a 4.8oz for the price of this 2.5oz, and they even offer free shipping above $50 (the shipping charges on this item are also a real rip-off).&lt;br /&gt;The 2.5oz is around $20&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Avoid.</li>
    <li> Read this advertisement well. It&#x27;s very expensive to purchase and is cheaper on Nordstroms website for a larger quantity. Also not as advertised. I received the UV SPF cream. Not what I wanted.</li>
    <li> First thing - Don&#x27;t buy here, it retails for $20 at the manufacturer&#x27;s website.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second - the product is amazing.  I love the way it has all these little particles that scrub my face and exfoliate, and I enjoy the faint scent.</li>
    <li> i wish you had another supplier. i have used this product before and of all kinds i have tried this is the best i have found.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t normally use moisturizing cream, but I bought this after an article I read on the best mens&#x27; skin care products.&lt;br /&gt;It is super refreshing and wakes you up when you put it on. I&#x27;m not sure how, but it almost feels like mint hits your skin.&lt;br /&gt;It cools, and the Cream doesn&#x27;t leave an oily build up.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t have a lot of experience with other products, so I can&#x27;t compare, but for the money it is definitely worth it.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s kiehls, it&#x27;s great</li>
    <li> I love this moisturizer more then any face cream ive tried&lt;br /&gt;forget anything you bought at wallgreens&lt;br /&gt;this is five stars, makes your face look more vibrant before going out , feeling fresh, and confident, i absolutley love it&lt;br /&gt;i must have this everytime before i go out and right out of the shower and after a shave&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;once you buy this your going to be hooked! i promise!</li>
    <li> I love Kiehl&#x27;s and especially Facial Fuel Moisture Treatement that I have been using for years. In fact I got my Dad hooked on it as well. I have oily to normal skin with a light beard and find that facial fuel helps reduce the itchiness. My face feels more energized and fresh after using it. My skin is a bit sensitive and I especially like that there is no heavy fragrance. Nice to put on in the morning after the shower or before going out in the evening. The only thing that I would like is if it had an SPF. It might seem a little pricey but it&#x27;s well worth it as you only need a small amount (size of a dime) to apply.</li>
    <li> I purchased this moisturizer for my boyfriend.  I haven&#x27;t given it to him yet, but I tried it and it doesn&#x27;t feel oily or greasy.  It smells like mint; it has menthol in it.  I bought it at Nordstroms for $25 (plus $2 more for tax) for the 2.5 oz.  I don&#x27;t know why this one is $31 for the 2.5 oz.  The 4.2 oz at Nordstroms was $35 (not including tax).  Just wanted to warn you!  But other than that, seems like a good product, and I love Amazon :)</li>
    <li> I foyu have men (or older teens) in your life this stuff is great. They love it and hey, everyone needs to moisturize. Kiehls makes very good creams . And they dont look foofy so my teens and twenty two year old like it!</li>
    <li> Non-greasy quality product. Good sized bottle, worth the money. Helps after shaving and in the winter with harsh cold temps.</li>
    <li> I tried this and the MenScience Advanced Face Lotion. This one has a nice scent, but it&#x27;s got a much greasier feel than the MenScience. I&#x27;d recommend that brand over this one.</li>
