### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>The pellets were the best.  </li>
      <li>Excellent product---still wish it came in pill form, but I will take it any way I can get it.  </li>
      <li>The efficacy of this product is superb.</li>
      <li>Good luck!</li>
      <li>I was taking pro-adapt with good results, but when I switched to Progon, I felt an increase in my satisfaction.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Love it!</li>
      <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m looking for another product that is more cost effective but performs as well.</li>
      <li>This is a newer one for me, but I believe is more effective.</li>
      <li>It gets into my system more effectively than if I were to rub it on my skin.</li>
      <li>I liked the pill form of this better, but this is better than nothing and MUCH better than the dreaded cream form.</li>
      <li>It works great as a first aid kit addition as well.</li>
      <li>Ok, so from a luteal progesterone of .3, it is now 5.5 with my method.</li>
      <li>Love it</li>
      <li>The tablets were better, the cream works best for me, but after a while you run out of places to put the cream on without repeating the same areas.</li>
      <li>Gets into the top of the dropper as well and leaks from the plastic.  </li>
      <li>Seems to help menopause symptoms better than the phyto bl-4x</li>
      <li>and I have used it for more than three weeks.  </li>
      <li>The pellets worked flawlessly, (3 pellets a day, a bottle lasting 80 days).  </li>
      <li>But I can&#x27;t be sure it&#x27;s because of this product.</li>
      <li>As I do miss the pellets so much more, it took my body some getting used to with this, but</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t have to take as much as it is more concentrated.</li>
      <li>Given the sublingual tablets were discontinued so this one is definitely a better choice than the original liquid replacement.</li>
      <li>The little tablets were perfect before changing.</li>
      <li>I understand the tablets are no longer available</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s also really great for women that may be low progesterone and trying to get pregnant.</li>
      <li>The first bottle top cracked as well.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using ProgoB-L 4x for 3-4 weeks and hot flashes have calmed down a great deal!</li>
      <li>Oh well, I will start my search again for a natural product that works with honest claims.</li>
      <li>I wanted a full effect</li>
      <li>Helps tremendously with my hormonal swings.</li>
      <li>It tastes better than the older version that kept tasting rancid.</li>
      <li>This product is easy to rub in, but I don&#x27;t know how much of it</li>
      <li>It was sealed and fresh from the factory.  </li>
      <li>Right now I use approx.</li>
      <li>I feel less moody, and a bit more energetic.</li>
      <li>I will need to increase the dose to get it higher.</li>
      <li>I believe this product is working to reduce my hot flashes.  </li>
      <li>(estriol is a superbly safe estrogen that is actually breast protective and</li>
      <li>Ok, I&#x27;m going to try to be as brief as I can.</li>
      <li>the bonus is that it will reduce those horrid hot flashes).</li>
      <li>A bonus is that I don&#x27;t have to take as high a dosage to get the same, or better, results.  </li>
      <li>It does not deliver as strong a medication as the prescription pills, but definitely helps with menopause symptoms.</li>
      <li>and I do not know how much I am getting as it is inconsistent in this form.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve found Dr. Lee&#x27;s books to be very revealing and helpful when making decisions about progesterone use, and his rationale for transdermal dosing convinced me to go this route.</li>
      <li>Why is it only filled part of the way, and the dropper doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
      <li>This natural progesterone works very well for me and is simple and easy to take, just a couple drops on the tongue twice a day.  </li>
      <li>This method seems to create a steady level of the hormone, and avoid the digestive system altogether.  </li>
      <li>I sometimes use more than called for, depending on how psychotic I feel:)</li>
      <li>This really works and it helps my body to heal itself naturally.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know whether this works or not, but I have been using it for a few weeks, and I feel better,</li>
      <li>Those who actually swallow it after holding it under the tongue will probably note even higher P levels in the blood (luteal phase).</li>
      <li>I used to take anti-depressants and no longer do because of natural hormones.</li>
      <li>I have struggled for nearly 10 years.</li>
      <li>The progesterone absorbs directly through the skin, is stored in the fat cells, and released as needed.  </li>
      <li>Oh of course natural stress occurs, and I am going through menopause</li>
      <li>I feel like it&#x27;s a weird product, but she says it&#x27;s safe, and much safer than synthetic progesterone.</li>
      <li>Also the bottle isn&#x27;t even half full when it arrives so at 15-20 drops per day, it only lasts around 3 weeks.</li>
      <li>I know who is big into natural therapies.</li>

<li> do you know how long a bottle lasts???  </li>

<li> The bottle was half empty when it arrived...</li>
<li> In fact, I don&#x27;t even swallow it after 5-10 minutes, I spit it out because swallowing the progesterone (like the oral capsules) really gets converted weirdly in my liver and turns into</li>
<li> Not fun.</li>
<li> Taking any less drops than that</li>
<li> Very disappointing to pay that much and have it advertised as 10 mls when you are only getting less than 5 mls.</li>
<li> This is worse than going back to having periods, for Pete&#x27;s sake.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m switching to something else.  </li>
<li> I feel this product is way over priced for the small amount you get.  </li>
<li> No more night sweats, no more loss of sleep, I&#x27;m calmer and not always on edge.  </li>
<li> and I know a bottle lasted at least 2 months.  </li>
<li> The thick part of the product cakes to the bottom of the bottle</li>
<li> i HATE this new formula.  </li>
<li> Not a good value.&lt;br</li>

<li> Not a good one.</li>

<li> Too expensive for something that does not work.  </li>
<li> It&#x27;s not as difficult to use as the cream, which takes forever to rub in.</li>
<li> so I put the drops under my tongue and it has an awful taste, due to the oils used.  </li>
<li> I still break out, just not quite as nearly as bad as the compounded creams or compounded oral capsules.</li>
<li> Too bad they were mandated to change it.</li>
<li> Bad packing.</li>
<li> I was a bit shocked and thought maybe it was a mistake</li>
<li> I am disappointed in the newer formula as it clumped and solidified at the bottom</li>
<li> I have horrible PMS and this stuff has been a lifesaver!</li>
<li> It has little even didn&#x27;t takes for one month !!!!!!!!</li>
<li> I break out horribly and get quite irritable, bloated.</li>
<li> Very disappointed!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> i HATE this new formula.  The pellets worked flawlessly, (3 pellets a day, a bottle lasting 80 days).  Have had nothing but trouble with this new formula.  My doctor has me taking up to 15 drops a day (I am post menopausal)... do you know how long a bottle lasts???  3 weeks.  Taking any less drops than that (orally) causes spotting.  This is worse than going back to having periods, for Pete&#x27;s sake.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m switching to something else.  Too expensive for something that does not work.  Too bad they were mandated to change it.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know whether this works or not, but I have been using it for a few weeks, and I feel better, so I&#x27;m assuming it&#x27;s because of this product. My doctor recommended it to deal with menopause symptoms. I feel less moody, and a bit more energetic. But I can&#x27;t be sure it&#x27;s because of this product. It&#x27;s not as difficult to use as the cream, which takes forever to rub in. This product is easy to rub in, but I don&#x27;t know how much of it I&#x27;m getting. Nowhere on the package does it say what the dose is. I use two drops twice a day for 20 days, and then stop for five days, and start again. That&#x27;s what my doctor said to do. I feel like it&#x27;s a weird product, but she says it&#x27;s safe, and much safer than synthetic progesterone. There are no other chemicals in this, so it seems purer than the cream, which contains things like Polysorbate 80 and other chemicals that I prefer to avoid.</li>
    <li> Really messy and difficult to apply without it getting everywhere.  Drips from the dropper sides making accurate dosing next to impossible.  Gets into the top of the dropper as well and leaks from the plastic.  The first bottle top cracked as well.  As soon as I find something else comparable, I&#x27;ll be switching unless these problems are addressed by the manufacturer.</li>
    <li> I used to take anti-depressants and no longer do because of natural hormones. This is a newer one for me, but I believe is more effective. I&#x27;ve used it for about 9 mo or so. I sometimes use more than called for, depending on how psychotic I feel:)</li>
    <li> Given the sublingual tablets were discontinued so this one is definitely a better choice than the original liquid replacement. It tastes better than the older version that kept tasting rancid. I don&#x27;t have to take as much as it is more concentrated.</li>
    <li> Use this product every day; recommended by my naturopathic doctor.</li>
    <li> Why is it only filled part of the way, and the dropper doesn&#x27;t work. Bad packing.</li>
    <li> This product was suggested to me by my naturopath. It does not deliver as strong a medication as the prescription pills, but definitely helps with menopause symptoms.</li>
    <li> I liked the pill form of this better, but this is better than nothing and MUCH better than the dreaded cream form.</li>
    <li> I have been using this produce for 4 months now, it has changed my life. No more night sweats, no more loss of sleep, I&#x27;m calmer and not always on edge.  Oh of course natural stress occurs, and I am going through menopause so it will happen, but a lot less frequently.  Thank you!</li>
    <li> Excellent product---still wish it came in pill form, but I will take it any way I can get it.  It was sealed and fresh from the factory.  No complaints</li>
    <li> I believe this product is working to reduce my hot flashes.  I was taking Phyto B tablets and I know a bottle lasted at least 2 months.  The liquid lasts 1 month and is the same price as the tablets were.  I understand the tablets are no longer available so I&#x27;ll continue using the liquid.</li>
    <li> It has little even didn&#x27;t takes for one month !!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I have been using this for about a month and believe I see an increase in my energy level and mood.</li>
    <li> As I do miss the pellets so much more, it took my body some getting used to with this, but once it did- it works! Love it! Keeps my cycle very regular!</li>
    <li> Ok, I&#x27;m going to try to be as brief as I can. I do not tolerate progesterone well at all. I have struggled for nearly 10 years. I break out horribly and get quite irritable, bloated. Not fun. Finally, I have found a way to raise progesterone without horrible side effects. I still break out, just not quite as nearly as bad as the compounded creams or compounded oral capsules. I don&#x27;t have any other side effects with bezwecken other than breakouts (I guess I will just have to live with that over the risk of breast/uterine cancer due to estrogen dominance). I use these under the tongue and rubbed into gums. In fact, I don&#x27;t even swallow it after 5-10 minutes, I spit it out because swallowing the progesterone (like the oral capsules) really gets converted weirdly in my liver and turns into I don&#x27;t know what metabolite. Not a good one. Ok, so from a luteal progesterone of .3, it is now 5.5 with my method. Those who actually swallow it after holding it under the tongue will probably note even higher P levels in the blood (luteal phase). I will need to increase the dose to get it higher. Right now I use approx. 6 drops each day on days 15-28. Good luck! P.s. I also like the bezwecken oil with progesterone and estriol (estriol is a superbly safe estrogen that is actually breast protective and the bonus is that it will reduce those horrid hot flashes).</li>
    <li> This really works and it helps my body to heal itself naturally. I will keep this on hand at all times. It works great as a first aid kit addition as well. Try it and you will like it.</li>
    <li> Seems to help menopause symptoms better than the phyto bl-4x</li>
    <li> This product says its a 10 ml bottle. The bottle was half empty when it arrived... Whats up with that? Very disappointing to pay that much and have it advertised as 10 mls when you are only getting less than 5 mls. I was a bit shocked and thought maybe it was a mistake but I see others have noticed that as well.</li>
    <li> The bottles that I bought only had 1/4 of a bottle of liquid in them.  Very disappointed!</li>
    <li> This did not work for me and I have used it for more than three weeks.  The pellets were the best.  I feel this product is way over priced for the small amount you get.  I wanted a full effect so I put the drops under my tongue and it has an awful taste, due to the oils used.  Oh well, I will start my search again for a natural product that works with honest claims.</li>
    <li> I am disappointed in the newer formula as it clumped and solidified at the bottom and I do not know how much I am getting as it is inconsistent in this form. It also did not last as long as I think it ought to. Feels wasteful . Will look for something else now. The little tablets were perfect before changing.</li>
    <li> Have discontinued prescribed medications because this product!</li>
    <li> Helps tremendously with my hormonal swings.</li>
    <li> This was recommended by a respected doctor I know who is big into natural therapies. I am using this as a supplement to the bio-hormone therapy I receive. This oil is topical but the doctor said to put 2 drops on your tongue and work it around your gums twice a day. It gets into my system more effectively than if I were to rub it on my skin. I am sold on it and will continue to use it probably the rest of my life.</li>
    <li> This natural progesterone works very well for me and is simple and easy to take, just a couple drops on the tongue twice a day.  Progesterone creams can be unpredictable in both dosage and absorbability, but I&#x27;ve found this oil to give me the right dosage in a predictable manner.  Shake the bottle vigorously before each use!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit 4/22/16: I&#x27;ve switched from taking the dosage buccally (ie. via the mucous membranes in the mouth) to rubbing it into the skin.  The progesterone absorbs directly through the skin, is stored in the fat cells, and released as needed.  This method seems to create a steady level of the hormone, and avoid the digestive system altogether.  A bonus is that I don&#x27;t have to take as high a dosage to get the same, or better, results.  I&#x27;ve found Dr. Lee&#x27;s books to be very revealing and helpful when making decisions about progesterone use, and his rationale for transdermal dosing convinced me to go this route.</li>
    <li> The tablets were better, the cream works best for me, but after a while you run out of places to put the cream on without repeating the same areas. I use a combination. Have been using Bezwecken Progon products for 4 years and it&#x27;s crucial to my life. I have horrible PMS and this stuff has been a lifesaver! It&#x27;s also really great for women that may be low progesterone and trying to get pregnant. My doc is moving me to a compounded progesterone oral pill. So hopefully it&#x27;ll work as well.</li>
    <li> Have used this product for years. Love it</li>
    <li> My review is mixed. The efficacy of this product is superb. I was taking pro-adapt with good results, but when I switched to Progon, I felt an increase in my satisfaction.&lt;br /&gt;My dissatisfaction is in the packaging and the amount of product in the bottle. As stated elsewhere, it runs out of the bottle and out of the rubber cap. The thick part of the product cakes to the bottom of the bottle so I can&#x27;t get it out. Also the bottle isn&#x27;t even half full when it arrives so at 15-20 drops per day, it only lasts around 3 weeks. Not a good value.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m looking for another product that is more cost effective but performs as well.</li>
    <li> Thank God for Bezwecken!  Finally a replacement for Phyto-B!  I&#x27;ve been using ProgoB-L 4x for 3-4 weeks and hot flashes have calmed down a great deal!</li>
