### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>/&gt;This is the best eye cream I have used.  </li>
      <li>I thank the seller that the purchase was excellent.</li>
      <li>My favorite Eye cream !!!!</li>
      <li>Excellent service,price and product!!</li>
      <li>I did my homework and researched the ingredients - an impressive list.  </li>
      <li>This eye cream works great!  </li>
      <li>Hydroshield is wonderful.</li>
      <li>This fragrance-free lightweight emulsion is incredibly hydrating.</li>
      <li>It might be great for some people, but I won&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
      <li>so I was happy to find this product.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a great product.</li>
      <li>Love this stuff!!</li>
      <li>This was a huge mistake!!</li>
      <li>Love this cream!</li>
      <li>that I learned about the really effective treatments for skin care.  </li>
      <li>I purchased from a site through Amazon that I was really happy with; I received my order within the same week that I placed it and at a very good price.</li>
      <li>You can easily find that the wrinkles under your eyes are disappearing!</li>
      <li>I have been using this for about a month and love the moisture.  </li>
      <li>I purchased this solely based on how much I love Dr. Denese Hydro Shield Ultra Moisturizing Face Serum.  </li>
      <li>After reading all of the claims made by Neutrogena Nx, you should be able to make a decision on whether or not you want to give it a try or stick with Dr. Denese.  </li>
      <li>It does not eliminate wrinkles, but it truly minimizes them and keeps the skin plumped up for the better part of a day.  </li>
      <li>The thing is great, and the shipping is fast as well.&lt;br /&gt;It</li>
      <li>It is so refreshing when applied.  </li>
      <li>There are many creams and potions out there that have retinol listed in the ingredients, but the ones in drug stores and markets don&#x27;t have what is called &amp;#34;stabilized&amp;#34; retinol.  </li>
      <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure if this was an eye cream as well</li>
      <li>I love it.  </li>
      <li>Love Dr. Denese&#x27;s products.  </li>
      <li>This is still what I fight to this day, although things are better.  </li>
      <li>I have very sensitive eyes and skin works great .</li>
      <li>Because their audience is so huge, many companies want to get their products on TV because they can sell thousands and thousands of whatever product they are selling.  </li>
      <li>This stuff is amazing -- super-thick, it doesn&#x27;t take much to moisturize and protect my face.  </li>
      <li>I purchase the spatulas and clean them after each application.</li>
      <li>Most of Dr Dense is fine for my sensitive skin - but this and the lifting cream were too strong and caused burning.</li>
      <li>So, if I were to compare Dr. Denese HydroShield Eye Emulsion with Retinol Nx for the eye, I would most certainly recommend the Neutrogena product.  </li>
      <li>It is nothing more than pure, stabilized retinol.  </li>
      <li>still use many of Dr. Denese&#x27;s products, but you caught me on this one because it isn&#x27;t one that I can really recommend.  </li>
      <li>This is another one of her products that I used for several months to give it a good trial period.  </li>
      <li>The color and consistency were different and it didn&#x27;t have a good effect on my skin.  </li>
      <li>He said that most of us try to use too many &amp;#34;things&amp;#34; and it isn&#x27;t necessary.  </li>
      <li>SOOTHED, SWELLING REDUCED QUICKLY AFTER APPLICATION&lt;</li>
      <li>you know it&#x27;s not cheap to be beautiful, but Amazon helps you out.</li>
      <li>Because I loved the facial retinol, I had no doubts that the other Nx products would be just as good.  </li>
      <li>I would like it if Dr Denese would put more in a jar for the price, but when I try I new brand</li>
      <li>I can finally say that yes, I have fine lines and wrinkles, but they have been dramatically smoothed out and that gives me a more youthful appearance.  </li>
      <li>If it continues to get better, that&#x27;s great, but if not, I&#x27;m happy as things are.  </li>
      <li>It is not really for me because it does not absorb or soak in like the serum or like a good cream would.  </li>
      <li>No return on beauty products I rather understand, but there should be some kind of credit, or recourse when a product actually harms your skin!!</li>
      <li>These, too, were caused by sun damage during the early years of my life when no one knew any better about protection from the sun.  </li>
      <li>Goes on a tad oily, but soaks right into the skin</li>
      <li>you are interested in reading about these products, just go to QVC.com and Search Neutrogena Nx, and it will bring up a screen where these products are pictured and described.  </li>
      <li>I was interested in it because of dryness around my eyes.</li>
      <li>really works!</li>
      <li>I really like the whole line so far, but this is by far, my favorite!</li>
      <li>I am in my early 40&#x27;s and needed something a little moisturizing and this is great.</li>
      <li>SkincareKiosk has great prices on Dr. Denese products and I do buy several other items of hers from them.</li>
      <li>My concerns were with fine lines and wrinkles (especially under and around my eyes) and some sun spots that appeared as brown splotchy spots on my cheeks.  </li>
      <li>You can see an obvious reduction of the fine lines under my eyes after applying it.  </li>
      <li>I have used this product in the past and liked it very much.  </li>
      <li>He was very blunt in saying that all a person needed were the 3 Nx products, and their skin would improve to a state beyond which aging skin cannot go.  </li>
      <li>It feels very silky when you put it on.</li>
      <li>It really does do what it says it will.</li>
      <li>I absolutely love all of her other products though.</li>
      <li>I liked the product, but am not sure if I would purchase it again.  </li>
      <li>He said that any reputable dermatologist including himself would tell anyone that RETINOL is the one and only thing that has really been proven to deliver younger looking skin.  </li>
      <li>This particular Neutrogena Nxproduct may indeed be on store shelves for all I know.  </li>
      <li>I realize that the price is high, but so are Dr. Denese&#x27;s products.  </li>
      <li>I wanted it to help firm my eyes more.</li>
      <li>I am picky with these types of products and most seem to be a waste of money.  </li>
      <li>What is more important is that it lacks some ingredients that can be irritating to sensitive under eye skin.  </li>
      <li>The product seemed to be very old.  </li>
      <li>They, too, are designed to last 90 days, so it may take you a while to experiment with it at first to see how far the product in the tubes go.  </li>
      <li>I am sensitive to retinol and it seems to be in all creams now</li>
      <li>I use this eye cream regularly and really like the texture.</li>
      <li>I am 61 years old.  </li>
      <li>They last 90 days for me without skimping on how much to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>No, this is a whole different ballgame, and I decided to pay attention.  </li>
      <li>I purchased this eye cream several months ago and found that it really made a difference around my eye area.</li>
      <li>It is thick and almost more like a leave on mask.  </li>
      <li>It comes in a small bottle with a pump that gives you exactly the right amount to use each time.  </li>
      <li>In other words, you can do as you see fit and maybe spend lots of money trying different things (</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t understand it, I have used Dr Denese products many times, but this was a total waste of a lot of money!!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using Dr Denese Hydroshield Emulsion for nearly 2 months, using it daily.</li>

<li> but I tried it twice, horrible!!!  </li>

    <li> This was a huge mistake!! It burnt my skin!! It pains me to write this but I tried it twice, horrible!!!  I don&#x27;t understand it, I have used Dr Denese products many times, but this was a total waste of a lot of money!! No return on beauty products I rather understand, but there should be some kind of credit, or recourse when a product actually harms your skin!!</li>
    <li> I use this eye cream regularly and really like the texture.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for about 4 years.  If I had crowsfeet lines before, I don&#x27;t have than anymore. I am 61 years old.  It really does do what it says it will.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s been hard for me to find a moisturizer that agrees with both my skin and foundation.  This stuff is amazing -- super-thick, it doesn&#x27;t take much to moisturize and protect my face.  Small container, but it lasts a long time.  Goes on a tad oily, but soaks right into the skin and then it isn&#x27;t.  Love this stuff!!</li>
    <li> I would not be without this product ever again if I can help it.  I am picky with these types of products and most seem to be a waste of money.  I really like the whole line so far, but this is by far, my favorite!</li>

    <li> I purchased this eye cream several months ago and found that it really made a difference around my eye area.I decided to check on Amazon before making another purchase to see if I could save some money.Ladies you know it&#x27;s not cheap to be beautiful, but Amazon helps you out.I thank the seller that the purchase was excellent.I ordered it one day and two days later I received it!! Excellent service,price and product!! Thank you again.</li>
    <li> The thing is great, and the shipping is fast as well.&lt;br /&gt;It really works! You can easily find that the wrinkles under your eyes are disappearing!</li>
    <li> As some of my reviews have already mentioned, I started a regular skin care cream about 4 years ago.  I need to say that it was a targeted anti-aging routine.  My concerns were with fine lines and wrinkles (especially under and around my eyes) and some sun spots that appeared as brown splotchy spots on my cheeks.  These, too, were caused by sun damage during the early years of my life when no one knew any better about protection from the sun.  So, I am paying that price now.  But, I&#x27;m not going down without a fight, and I began this regimen I spoke of.  I began with and still use the products that Dr. Denese recommended.  This is another one of her products that I used for several months to give it a good trial period.  Prior to this, I hadn&#x27;t found any brand for damage around the eye that produced results.  This is still what I fight to this day, although things are better.  I wasn&#x27;t seeing results with the product I am reviewing here.  But, since I didn&#x27;t know what else to try, I kept on going with it.  It wasn&#x27;t until I heard about Neutrogena Cosmeceuticals from a dermatologist who practiced in Los Angeles with the &amp;#34;rich and famous&amp;#34; that I learned about the really effective treatments for skin care.  He said that most of us try to use too many &amp;#34;things&amp;#34; and it isn&#x27;t necessary.  He said that any reputable dermatologist including himself would tell anyone that RETINOL is the one and only thing that has really been proven to deliver younger looking skin.  This doctor struck me as someone who could be trusted, and I listened to his advice.  There are many creams and potions out there that have retinol listed in the ingredients, but the ones in drug stores and markets don&#x27;t have what is called &amp;#34;stabilized&amp;#34; retinol.  This doctor worked for Neutrogena Cosmeceuticles which is not the same thing as the Neutrogena we all know from seeing it in stores.  No, this is a whole different ballgame, and I decided to pay attention.  He recommended a product for the face made by Neutrogena called Retinol Nx.  It is nothing more than pure, stabilized retinol.  It comes in a small bottle with a pump that gives you exactly the right amount to use each time.  I love it.  I never go a day without it.  Without getting too wordy here, I then started using the other two products they came out with in the Nx line.  One is called Retinol Nx eye cream, and the other is Neutrogena Nx for the neck, hands, and décolleté. Because I loved the facial retinol, I had no doubts that the other Nx products would be just as good.  And they are.  So, if I were to compare Dr. Denese HydroShield Eye Emulsion with Retinol Nx for the eye, I would most certainly recommend the Neutrogena product.  I have been using these three items since I heard this dermatologist explain what they now know about skin care, and he simply said that trying to use all kinds of other ingredients may moisturize or relax the skin around the eye, but they don&#x27;t have clinical results that prove their effectiveness against wrinkles.  He was very blunt in saying that all a person needed were the 3 Nx products, and their skin would improve to a state beyond which aging skin cannot go.  In other words, you can do as you see fit and maybe spend lots of money trying different things (like I did), but nothing will take you any further in erasing wrinkles than Retinol.  So, I stopped using the Dr. Denese product we are discussing here and went with Neutrogena.  I can finally say that yes, I have fine lines and wrinkles, but they have been dramatically smoothed out and that gives me a more youthful appearance.  If it continues to get better, that&#x27;s great, but if not, I&#x27;m happy as things are.  If you want to try Neutrogena Cosmeceuticals, the only place I know of to get it is from QVC.  Because their audience is so huge, many companies want to get their products on TV because they can sell thousands and thousands of whatever product they are selling.  This particular Neutrogena Nxproduct may indeed be on store shelves for all I know.  I know that I am getting it at the lowest price on QVC, and I have these three products shipped to me automatically every 90 days.  That way I don&#x27;t run out, and I am guaranteed that there will be enough supply of it for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are interested in reading about these products, just go to QVC.com and Search Neutrogena Nx, and it will bring up a screen where these products are pictured and described.  After reading all of the claims made by Neutrogena Nx, you should be able to make a decision on whether or not you want to give it a try or stick with Dr. Denese.  I realize that the price is high, but so are Dr. Denese&#x27;s products.  The cost is offset, however, by the fact that one unit (tube or bottle) lasts 90 days.  That&#x27;s a really long time, and I can vouch for the fact that they truly do last that long.  That&#x27;s why with the facial Nx, you get a measured drop.  Using that measured amount lasts 90 days.  The other creams for eye and neck areas, are creams that come in tubes.  They, too, are designed to last 90 days, so it may take you a while to experiment with it at first to see how far the product in the tubes go.  They last 90 days for me without skimping on how much to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I still use many of Dr. Denese&#x27;s products, but you caught me on this one because it isn&#x27;t one that I can really recommend.  For me, it didn&#x27;t work.  I am much happier with Neutrogena Nx at least for my face, eyes, and neck areas.  Do some reading on the QVC web page and then make your decision.</li>
    <li> This fragrance-free lightweight emulsion is incredibly hydrating. It is so refreshing when applied.  I did my homework and researched the ingredients - an impressive list.  What is more important is that it lacks some ingredients that can be irritating to sensitive under eye skin.  It is NOT oily, NOT greasy, NOT watered down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using this product  daily for 45 days, I can report the following changes in my eye area:&lt;br /&gt;Upper Eye Crepiness GONE&lt;br /&gt;Upper Eye Redness GONE&lt;br /&gt;Fine Lines Under Eye INVISIBLE AFTER APPLICATION&lt;br /&gt;Crows Feet DIMINISHED&lt;br /&gt;Occasional Puffiness: SOOTHED, SWELLING REDUCED QUICKLY AFTER APPLICATION&lt;br /&gt;Under Eye Skin FIRMER, STRENGTHENED&lt;br /&gt;Under Eye Skin LIGHTER IN APPEARANCE&lt;br /&gt;Under Eye Dark Shadows IMPROVED&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the best eye cream I have used.  A bit expensive, but for this formula, worth it.&lt;br /&gt;Just wish Dr. Denese would supply a spatula with her jar products.  I purchase the spatulas and clean them after each application.</li>
    <li> Love this cream! I am sensitive to retinol and it seems to be in all creams now so I was happy to find this product. I am in my early 40&#x27;s and needed something a little moisturizing and this is great.</li>
    <li> My favorite Eye cream !!!! I have very sensitive eyes and skin works great . There is no smell , and you can see a difference in days.</li>
    <li> Most of Dr Dense is fine for my sensitive skin - but this and the lifting cream were too strong and caused burning.</li>
    <li> This product seemed to always make it&#x27;s way into my eyes. I absolutely love all of her other products though.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for about a month and love the moisture.  I had previously purchased this somewhere else and found it now at Amazon.  I will continue all my purchases now for Dr Denese through Amazon because of the price difference.</li>
    <li> I like the way this moisturizes. It feels very silky when you put it on. I would like it if Dr Denese would put more in a jar for the price, but when I try I new brand I aw lays come back to this one.</li>
    <li> This eye cream works great!  You can see an obvious reduction of the fine lines under my eyes after applying it.  It does not eliminate wrinkles, but it truly minimizes them and keeps the skin plumped up for the better part of a day.  I have been using this for over two years, morning and evening.  It&#x27;s a great product.</li>
    <li> I purchased this solely based on how much I love Dr. Denese Hydro Shield Ultra Moisturizing Face Serum.  It is not really for me because it does not absorb or soak in like the serum or like a good cream would.  It is thick and almost more like a leave on mask.  It might be great for some people, but I won&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Dr Denese Hydroshield Emulsion for nearly 2 months, using it daily. I was interested in it because of dryness around my eyes. A small amount of product provides lots of moisture without being greasy. It absorbs well and keeps the area hydrated all day long.  No more dry flakes around my eyes! I purchased from a site through Amazon that I was really happy with; I received my order within the same week that I placed it and at a very good price. This product does what it promises, it works for me and I&#x27;ll purchase it again from the same company when I need to order again.</li>
    <li> Love Dr. Denese&#x27;s products.  Hydroshield is wonderful.</li>
    <li> I do believe that this product actually works on the \\&quot;hash\\&quot; lines under the eyes.  I wasn&#x27;t sure if this was an eye cream as well so I do follow it with an eye moisturizer.  SkincareKiosk has great prices on Dr. Denese products and I do buy several other items of hers from them.</li>
    <li> I liked the product, but am not sure if I would purchase it again.  I wanted it to help firm my eyes more.</li>
