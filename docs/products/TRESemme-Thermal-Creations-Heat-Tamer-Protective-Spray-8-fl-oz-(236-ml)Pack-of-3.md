<li> Just be careful when you spray  it, all of the excess product that ends on your floor turns it into ice skating</li>
<li> I use this stuff everyday and it makes a world of difference when I flat iron.</li>
<li> Product doesn&#x27;t weigh hair down in any way...</li>
<li> My hair is noticeably shinier and significantly less frizzy when I use it.</li>
<li> I almost killed myself on a night visit to the bathroom.</li>
<li> Use this everyday and my hair doesn&#x27;t get fried when I flat iron it or have a burnt smell, however after a few weeks the spray nozzle broke :(</li>
<li> I would give it five stars but the sprayer feels awkward.</li>

    <li> It&#x27;s good, no complains so far. Best price!</li>
    <li> I use this stuff everyday and it makes a world of difference when I flat iron. I use it in conjunction with chi&#x27;s blow dry spray and my hair feels softer than before I flat iron. Can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
    <li> I use it every time I need to use heat on my hair. But i can&#x27;t tell if it did protect my hair. Since I bought the 3 bottles as one package, I will continue use it just hope it does work.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never used a thermal protectant before trying this product, so I&#x27;ve nothing to compare it to. It has a great fresh clean scent and I prefer the trigger to a &amp;#34;pump&amp;#34; nozzle. Product doesn&#x27;t weigh hair down in any way... good stuff for the cost. I&#x27;ve not seen any heat damage to my hair since using this product.</li>
