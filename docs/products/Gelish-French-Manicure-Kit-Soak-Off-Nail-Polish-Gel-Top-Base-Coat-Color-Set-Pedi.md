      <li>I read many reviews before choosing this.</li>
      <li>LOVE LOVE LOVE</li>
      <li>Might be more oil in their nails??  </li>
      <li>I found that it was easier just to create my own smile line with an art paintbrush that my daughter had.</li>
      <li>I was very pleased to learn that even a novice like myself would be able to achieve a nice gel french manicure.</li>
      <li>I have only used this product one time, with a 54 watt UV light, and I am feeling very confident that I will be able to perform my own gel manicures at home for a fraction of the cost of going to the salon.</li>
      <li>I bought this as a set to go with a uv light also purchased on Amazon.</li>
      <li>I also bought an LED light on amazon as well.</li>
      <li>just like the professionals do but dont cost so much if you have the time to do your own nails.</li>
      <li>The white is beautiful too and is easy to shape the smile line.  </li>
      <li>I bought a set of Orly white tip guides, watched a quick tutorial online, and my first home gelish manicure looks as good as the salon!  </li>
      <li>These ARE full sized bottles, and you do get four bottles as pictured.  </li>
      <li>If you want good French Manicure Kit, this is the right choice.</li>
      <li>I am SO thrilled with Gel Nails in general</li>
      <li>This French manicure kit is amazing...</li>
      <li>I swim for an hour every day and my manicure lasts for weeks, rarely chips.  </li>
      <li>This is a great set and the first one I bought I had for over 2 years before it got a little sticky</li>
      <li>It is my first time doing my nails with gel nail polish</li>
      <li>That said, my sister and my girlfriend don&#x27;t have nearly as good of wear or trouble with the soak off.  </li>
      <li>Gelish goes on better than Shellac, and seems to be stronger and last much longer.  </li>
      <li>Easy and simple to use.</li>
      <li>This pink might work better on someone with a darker complexion.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this product if you have a UV nail dryer!</li>
      <li>Also when I got the package it was very damp inside.</li>
      <li>but I really like the Gelish product lineup too.</li>
      <li>Even with my first attempt with these I was getting compliments left and right.</li>
      <li>Keep in mind that you need an LED/UV light to dry the gel polishes.</li>
      <li>Highly recommended.</li>
      <li>I wanted a sheer pink, so I ordered the simpler sheer and the sheek white which I love and it looks more natural.</li>
      <li>When I bought this kit, I was completely new to the Gel Manicure.</li>
      <li>Product easy to apply very long lasting for over 2 weeks will recommend to family and friends.</li>
      <li>I was expecting the pink to be more of a clear pink, but it is not.</li>
      <li>I had gotten it done by a professional once and loved them but couldn&#x27;t understand why they were so expensive.</li>
      <li>The white runs, and getting a good smile line is extremely difficult due to the running.  </li>
      <li>It goes on thick, so be sure to dab off the applicator brush prior to application.</li>
      <li>I have been using OPI base and top coat and have been seriously disappointed, but this Gelish top and base coat is awesome and will last for two weeks or more!</li>
      <li>one trick I found is to apply the white tip BEFORE the 2 coats of the clear pink.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Gelish products are normally great.  Here&#x27;s why I gave this set 2 out of 5 stars:  I don&#x27;t like the pink or the white colors in this set.  I was expecting the pink to be more of a clear pink, but it is not. I won&#x27;t be using it, again.  The white runs, and getting a good smile line is extremely difficult due to the running.  (I am experienced with this product, and this should not be happening.)  In addition, this white is too sheer.  I had to use two coats, which I don&#x27;t like doing - it&#x27;s a waste of time.  I may try my other brand of white to see if it will work with this brand.  These ARE full sized bottles, and you do get four bottles as pictured.  I have fair to medium colored skin.  This pink might work better on someone with a darker complexion.</li>
    <li> When I bought this kit, I was completely new to the Gel Manicure. I had gotten it done by a professional once and loved them but couldn&#x27;t understand why they were so expensive. Even with my first attempt with these I was getting compliments left and right. People didn&#x27;t believe I had done them myself!  Now I have gotten a lot better at it and my nails look nice all the time! I love Gelish!</li>
    <li> It is my first time doing my nails with gel nail polish and I love it! I also bought the LED light ad it works perfect.</li>
    <li> I read many reviews before choosing this. In the description it said you would get simpler sheer and sheek white. What I got was little princess which is a creamy pink and artic white which is too thick. I wanted a sheer pink, so I ordered the simpler sheer and the sheek white which I love and it looks more natural. Also when I got the package it was very damp inside. I wrote the company, but never heard from them. I&#x27;m very disappointed since I have ended up spending more money to get what I want! So beware you may not get what you ordered!</li>
    <li> I have been using Shellac for a couple of years but decided to try Gelish... I am so happy I did!  This French manicure kit is amazing... one trick I found is to apply the white tip BEFORE the 2 coats of the clear pink.  This prevents the white from separating from the rest of the polish after a few days.  Gelish goes on better than Shellac, and seems to be stronger and last much longer.  Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Instead of paying $30 each visit, why not buy the bottles and do your nails yourself. I bought these as a gift for my mother and she loved them. Keep in mind that you need an LED/UV light to dry the gel polishes. I also bought an LED light on amazon as well. Stick with LED and reduce your chances of getting cancer.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a set to go with a uv light also purchased on Amazon. I bought a set of Orly white tip guides, watched a quick tutorial online, and my first home gelish manicure looks as good as the salon!  I imagine in a matter of a few months I will break even on the cost.  I wish I had known about this product long ago.  It goes on thick, so be sure to dab off the applicator brush prior to application.</li>
    <li> I have been using the Gelish products for a few years now and have not been disappointed.  This is a great set and the first one I bought I had for over 2 years before it got a little sticky and I decided to replace it.  This product stays on my nails forever...actually takes a long, long time (30-60 minutes) to soak off for me.  That said, my sister and my girlfriend don&#x27;t have nearly as good of wear or trouble with the soak off.  Might be more oil in their nails??  I swim for an hour every day and my manicure lasts for weeks, rarely chips.  Only thing I would prefer is if the white in this set was a brighter white.</li>
    <li> The color is good and easy to apply.  I did have some problem with some of them peeling.  I bought the prep coat and it seems to be better.</li>
    <li> The foundation was not ok, the brush</li>
    <li> My wife has been paying close to $50 each time she gets her nails done. She found ths polish on Amazon and is the same brand the salon uses. She got a LED curing light along with this polish and now she does her own nails at a fraction of the cost!</li>
    <li> I was very pleased to learn that even a novice like myself would be able to achieve a nice gel french manicure. I have only used this product one time, with a 54 watt UV light, and I am feeling very confident that I will be able to perform my own gel manicures at home for a fraction of the cost of going to the salon. I used this product with the  Orly nail guides, which I would not recommend. They were difficult to place and left behind a very sticky residue that was hard to clean. I found that it was easier just to create my own smile line with an art paintbrush that my daughter had. We are ordering a nice nail brush on Amazon soon. I am very happy with this polish.</li>
    <li> Very good product. Product easy to apply very long lasting for over 2 weeks will recommend to family and friends.</li>
    <li> Awesome product!  I have been using OPI base and top coat and have been seriously disappointed, but this Gelish top and base coat is awesome and will last for two weeks or more! The white is beautiful too and is easy to shape the smile line.  I will buy this product again.</li>
    <li> I loved the idea of this. But when I got it and actually did it you have to cure every time you put a layer on and by the time your done you have a inch and a half of cured gel nails. they are so big. I guess the plus is that you can just peel them off.</li>
    <li> Good product, good transaction.</li>
    <li> My girlfriend loves these and uses them all the time. I can&#x27;t tell you much more than that - I&#x27;m a dude after all....</li>
    <li> need to buy more love it!</li>
    <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE this set!  I am SO thrilled with Gel Nails in general but I really like the Gelish product lineup too.</li>
    <li> just like the professionals do but dont cost so much if you have the time to do your own nails.</li>
    <li> So easy to learn and use!  And I love how it smooths itself!  Great product which I will purchase over and over.</li>
    <li> This is a must have for people starting off with the Gelish.  Great value compared to what you pay for them separately.</li>
    <li> If you want good French Manicure Kit, this is the right choice. Love it!</li>
    <li> I just used this product for the first time and it works great! It is just like going to the nail salon! I highly recommend this product if you have a UV nail dryer! Easy and simple to use.</li>
    <li> Very good quality...salon manicures at home!</li>
    <li> It last for 3 weeks. Very happy with this product. The quality of this product is above my expectations. A+</li>
