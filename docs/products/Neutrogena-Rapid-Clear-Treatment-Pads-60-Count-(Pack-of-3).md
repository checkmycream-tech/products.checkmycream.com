      <li>I really love this product.</li>
      <li>Love this product.</li>
      <li>Ordering more today.</li>
      <li>I started using these pads in High School, and they were great.</li>
      <li>but afterward it smelled pretty good.</li>
      <li>This stuff really works!!!</li>
      <li>They&#x27;re easy and quick to use</li>
      <li>My skin is smooth, clearing up fast, and just looks healthy.</li>

      <li>and if I&amp;#34;m lucky, the break out doesn&#x27;t happen.</li>
      <li>I just started using these, so I can&#x27;t comment on how quickly they work yet.</li>
      <li>I use a super mild face wash, this stuff, and then a moisturizer after it dries</li>

      <li>Well worth the money</li>
      <li>The initial smell was very strong like rubbing alcohol</li>
      <li>I have used the most expensive skin care systems that are sold and can honestly say Neutrogena does the job well at a much more reasonable price.  </li>
      <li>I have really fine and sensitive skin and wanted something to get rid of like dirt on a deeper level.</li>
      <li>I do recommend this for people with really fine and sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>if you really want, you won&#x27;t save 10 cents but its worth it.  </li>
      <li>Ask a dermatologist for a further review on the benefits of the actual product, but for my personal needs this transaction was perfect!</li>
      <li>Is does exactly what is says it does.</li>
      <li>This summer before I headed out of the country for an archaeological dig in the desert I pick up a 60 pack of these to get through most of the 6-7 weeks I&#x27;d need.</li>
      <li>I first bought these on the recommendation from my son&#x27;s dermatologist.</li>
      <li>These are the only products that have made a difference and they are so much better than the prescription the doctor prescribed.</li>
      <li>and I get occasional hormal acne mostly on my chin.</li>
      <li>, it turns out to be that rare time I have acne any more, so I know the pads are doing the trick any other time...</li>
      <li>This product worked to clear it up quickly.</li>
      <li>I suffer from breakouts from time to time and the Neutrogena&#x27;s Rapid Clear pads help tremendously.  </li>
      <li>The only issue I see forming is that the fragrance is really amazingly strong.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t make my face super red like most \\&quot;leave on\\&quot; topical acne solutions.</li>
      <li>and there is some type of mold growing that is absolutely repulsive.  </li>
      <li>Suffered acne my whole life, and this stuff just straight up rocks.</li>
      <li>the gentle cleanser may have missed.</li>
      <li>If you have perfume sensitivities, remember this is going to go on your face very close to your nose.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend!</li>
      <li>The perfume smell is just too much and won&#x27;t even wash off.</li>
      <li>If you like cleanser cloths, you should give these a try, particularly if you have skin that tends to be more oily than dry.</li>
      <li>These likely will not make your acne disappear, but should help you with keeping your face clean and refreshed and limiting break outs.  </li>
      <li>It left my skin very soft and smooth.</li>
      <li>when I knew I&#x27;d be doing a lot activity, particularly in the Florida summer humidity.</li>
      <li>I found this product to be gentle on sensitive skin and to shrink pores.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Even with a very routine schedule of washing my face, for years as an adult</li>
      <li>This product really works to clear your face.</li>
      <li>and occasionally I&#x27;ll forget my Rapid Clear Pads and sure enough</li>
      <li>Used a lot of different products without success.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s strong enough that I might actually choose another wash or cream</li>
      <li>My son who is a teenager and is dealing with occasional break outs also uses these and they also work pretty well for him.</li>
      <li>Neutrogena has several different products for troubled skin and you have to find the ones that work best for you.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;d use a a different cleanser in the morning and these pads before bed and saw a noticable improvement with consistent use.  </li>
      <li>You do have to be careful depending on your skin, because these pads are strong, so they will dry out your skin sometimes too much.</li>
      <li>My daughter uses this with the Neutrogena Rapid Clear Acne Elimninating Spot Gel, twice a day.  </li>
      <li>This will clear your acne up practically over night, I use it once in the morning and</li>
      <li>I also use them at night, after washing my face, to help clear out excess oil and dirt</li>
      <li>But that&#x27;s about the only thing I can say I really like about this.</li>
      <li>I am a mature woman</li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t seem to make a difference if I use them during the day or not, as far as skin-drying goes.    </li>
      <li>I got them for him but wish I had gotten them earlier for my older teenager.</li>
      <li>Daily, I&#x27;d get out of the shower, quickly take a pad, rub all over my face, apply lotion, then be done and moving on to other things.</li>
      <li>The one time I got a break out was when I forgot to use them for a few days, and it cleared up quickly when I started using them again.</li>
      <li>If I use it too often my face turns red - I have very sensitive skin.  </li>
      <li>After a few months&#x27; use right before going to bed I noticed a considerable improvement in my skin(less pimples).</li>
      <li>My 14-year-old son has been using these pads for about a year, and they make an enormous difference in his quest for clear skin.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;It is smooth on one side and slightly rougher on the other side , so you can choose</li>
      <li>I found it useful to cut them in half so that they&#x27;re not too wet for my son.</li>

    <li> This is a must-have product for me.  I suffer from breakouts from time to time and the Neutrogena&#x27;s Rapid Clear pads help tremendously.  I have used the most expensive skin care systems that are sold and can honestly say Neutrogena does the job well at a much more reasonable price.  Neutrogena has several different products for troubled skin and you have to find the ones that work best for you.  My daughter and I use these and have been extremely pleased with the results.</li>
    <li> This works great after the gym or before you go to bed. It works great!</li>
    <li> This stuff rocks, I guess I&#x27;ve been doing it wrong the whole time by just using face washes and expecting my skin to clear. Suffered acne my whole life, and this stuff just straight up rocks. It doesn&#x27;t make my face super red like most \\&quot;leave on\\&quot; topical acne solutions. I use a super mild face wash, this stuff, and then a moisturizer after it dries and I have no dryness/flakiness at all. My skin is smooth, clearing up fast, and just looks healthy. I&#x27;m very pleased and will definitely purchase again.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t particularly love face-care pads; I&#x27;d far rather just use face wash and lotion, but these pads do fill a gap in my routine. I use these anytime my face is sweaty or dirty throughout the day, like after exercise or just a hot day in the sun. It tides me over well until I can actually wash my face. I also use them at night, after washing my face, to help clear out excess oil and dirt the gentle cleanser may have missed. These can be a bit drying though, so I&#x27;ve cut down on my use of the pads during my night routine since winter started. I use these every other night or less. Doesn&#x27;t seem to make a difference if I use them during the day or not, as far as skin-drying goes.    I&#x27;m a big fan of Neutrogena products, and these pads are definitely world&#x27;s ahead of the other two acne-care face pads I&#x27;ve used before. If you like cleanser cloths, you should give these a try, particularly if you have skin that tends to be more oily than dry.</li>
    <li> This product really works to clear your face. I am 50+ and still have an occasional breakout around my mouth. This product worked to clear it up quickly. It also takes off makeup including mascara. I am a believer.</li>
    <li> I have seen results with this product.  I use it once a day, only at night.  If I use it too often my face turns red - I have very sensitive skin.  From my experience, these pads work as well as Proactive does.  Highly recommend them, I will be buying more when my 3-pack runs out.</li>
    <li> This will clear your acne up practically over night, I use it once in the morning and once in the evening.  The only problem I have with it is when i order online, every time there is at least one where the pd didn&#x27;t make it in before it was sealed and there is some type of mold growing that is absolutely repulsive.  Go to CVS and buy it if you really want, you won&#x27;t save 10 cents but its worth it.  As for the post with the allergies.  CHECK THE LABEL AND USE YOUR BRAIN</li>
    <li> I just started using these, so I can&#x27;t comment on how quickly they work yet. They don&#x27;t seem overly drying and they don&#x27;t sting -- I&#x27;ve used a lot of Neutrogena acne products, and none of them have stung or really dried out my skin. The only issue I see forming is that the fragrance is really amazingly strong. If you have perfume sensitivities, remember this is going to go on your face very close to your nose. It&#x27;s strong enough that I might actually choose another wash or cream once I use up the jars I got. EDIT: I&#x27;m returning these. The perfume smell is just too much and won&#x27;t even wash off. Yikes.</li>
    <li> Even with a very routine schedule of washing my face, for years as an adult I&#x27;ve had mild cases of random acne.  So as I got into my 30s and totally frustrated with nothing working I tried this product and it just worked.  I use it at night before bed (every night) and I almost never get any kind of acne any longer.  I travel a lot and occasionally I&#x27;ll forget my Rapid Clear Pads and sure enough, it turns out to be that rare time I have acne any more, so I know the pads are doing the trick any other time...</li>
    <li> Background information: I bought this product yesterday afternoon.... I&#x27;ve notice since I moved to the south my skin hasn&#x27;t been responding well to the humidity and my skin was EXTRA oily which was causing me to break out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Product: I seem this in rite aid and picked it up. It was pretty cheap for 60 wipes. I used it after I got out of the shower. The initial smell was very strong like rubbing alcohol but afterward it smelled pretty good. I noticed my skin wasn&#x27;t as oily!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The next morning, although my existing pimples were still there, no new pimples appeared!!! and the existing ones didnt get worse for the first time in weeks! It left my skin very soft and smooth. I really love this product. It makes my skin feel clean and fresh. And it seems to be working great!</li>
    <li> I first bought these on the recommendation from my son&#x27;s dermatologist. My teenage son has special needs and is not successful using an acne wash. The doctor said that these are great pads. I got them for him but wish I had gotten them earlier for my older teenager. She likes them a lot too. I found it useful to cut them in half so that they&#x27;re not too wet for my son. The bonus is that they go a lot farther too! They have really helped keep his acne under control and they&#x27;re super easy to use twice a day. Love them!</li>
    <li> This stuff doesn&#x27;t do anything for me. I have probably used about 40/60 of the wipes, and I&#x27;ve been waiting for results that are just not going to come. First of all, I have very annoying, acne prone skin. It&#x27;s oily on the t-zone, but is very dry on the cheeks. So I guess it would be called \\&quot;combination skin.\\&quot; I don&#x27;t have very bad acne, but I do have bumpy, un-smooth skin, with a couple of pimples at a time. When I started using this I loved the convenience of it, so of course I was praying it would work for me. Daily, I&#x27;d get out of the shower, quickly take a pad, rub all over my face, apply lotion, then be done and moving on to other things. But that&#x27;s about the only thing I can say I really like about this. It just doesn&#x27;t work for me at all.</li>
    <li> My 14-year-old son has been using these pads for about a year, and they make an enormous difference in his quest for clear skin.  If he runs out, it&#x27;s obvious after a few days.  They&#x27;re easy and quick to use and I have never been tempted to try a different brand.  I highly recommend!</li>
    <li> These likely will not make your acne disappear, but should help you with keeping your face clean and refreshed and limiting break outs.  After a few months&#x27; use right before going to bed I noticed a considerable improvement in my skin(less pimples). I&#x27;d use a a different cleanser in the morning and these pads before bed and saw a noticable improvement with consistent use.  Once I stopped my \\&quot;before bed\\&quot; routine, my skin took a turn for the worse so apprantly these work.  In terms of irriation, I&#x27;d say these shouldn&#x27;t give your avarage skin any issues used once or twice a day... my few cents.</li>
    <li> Is does exactly what is says it does. Clears and dries acne!!!! Definitely a must buy. Ordering more today. Five star</li>
    <li> Hard to say much about this. I used these pads before and simply decided to save some money this way. Ask a dermatologist for a further review on the benefits of the actual product, but for my personal needs this transaction was perfect!</li>
    <li> I found this product to be gentle on sensitive skin and to shrink pores.&lt;br /&gt;It is smooth on one side and slightly rougher on the other side , so you can choose&lt;br /&gt;which works best for you.Love this product.</li>
    <li> This stuff really works!!! Used a lot of different products without success. Very Happy!!!</li>
    <li> My daughter uses this with the Neutrogena Rapid Clear Acne Elimninating Spot Gel, twice a day.  These are the only products that have made a difference and they are so much better than the prescription the doctor prescribed.</li>
    <li> I wanted to save a couple bucks so I tried a store brand that purported to do the same thing as the Neutrogena brand.  The problem with the other product was that it had a horrible fragrance.  So, I came back to the Neutrogena brand have never left.</li>
    <li> great product. work perfectly for me..have tried alot of things but didnt work this product did wonders for me.</li>
    <li> These pads work fairly well. I am a mature woman and I get occasional hormal acne mostly on my chin. I hate it! I have found that these pads help with a break out flare up, and sometimes I&#x27;ll feel something coming on my face and I&#x27;ll use these in that area twice a day and if I&amp;#34;m lucky, the break out doesn&#x27;t happen. You do have to be careful depending on your skin, because these pads are strong, so they will dry out your skin sometimes too much. You have to find what works for you. My son who is a teenager and is dealing with occasional break outs also uses these and they also work pretty well for him. Good over the counter acne product.</li>
    <li> I started using these pads in High School, and they were great. I&#x27;d picked them up every once in a while since then when I knew I&#x27;d be doing a lot activity, particularly in the Florida summer humidity. However, without this incentive of feeling absolutely disgusting and knowing the gardening/archaeology/running would lead to a break out I never integrated them into my daily routine (of which, Ia admittedly, had almost none). This summer before I headed out of the country for an archaeological dig in the desert I pick up a 60 pack of these to get through most of the 6-7 weeks I&#x27;d need. Once again, they were one of the best purchases for the trip I made. The one time I got a break out was when I forgot to use them for a few days, and it cleared up quickly when I started using them again. Needless to say, after 60 days of having to have a skin routine (or face acne, dried out, peeling and oily skin), I still have one and continue to use these pads everyday. Well worth the money</li>
    <li> I have really fine and sensitive skin and wanted something to get rid of like dirt on a deeper level. So I decided to use these wipes and it made me break out really bad on my whole face. I do recommend this for people with really fine and sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> I have been using them for quite a while and they are great, neutrogena products have the quality you need and expect, i use this pads at night.</li>
    <li> Your body is like a car. Some cars take diesel, some take bio fuel and some take electricity. This product is like diesel. If you use diesel on an electric car, it will have no effect or it may worsen the results, however on a diesel car this will work flawlessly.&lt;br /&gt;Some people work well with salicylic acid and some work with benzol peroxide and others with sulfur.&lt;br /&gt;Try this product out, it may or may not work for you, but just in case, buy some sulfur based products and maybe try other alternatives.</li>
