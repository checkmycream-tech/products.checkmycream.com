      <li>Great products.  </li>

      <li>I buy this mascara all the time at Ulta and have loved it</li>
      <li>Good deal .</li>
      <li>/&gt;This worked best the very first time.  </li>

      <li>Truly amazing.  </li>
      <li>But I needed up loving it anyway.</li>
      <li>I liked it so well</li>
      <li>Absolutely LOVE this product, I will not buy another brand or kind ever again.  </li>
      <li>I was using Tarte mascaras before this, which are nice too, but this is a bit cheaper and does give me more length.  </li>
      <li>Better than Lancôme.  </li>
      <li>My favorite mascara of all time.</li>
      <li>As the saying goes, if I had a dollar for every mascara that I have tried, I would be wealthy.  </li>
      <li>I like this wand and the regular flawless definition</li>
      <li>Totally not necessary, which I think is best for the health of one&#x27;s lashes.)  </li>
      <li>I just love this mascara.  </li>
      <li>I have used many department store and boutique mascaras.</li>
      <li>Love this mascara...</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been looking for a healthy mascara.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried many different mascaras but this one so has been the best.</li>
      <li>It stays put like a waterproof mascara and washes off easily at the end of the day.</li>
      <li>This mascara stays on all day without smudging, and comes off easily in the evening.</li>
      <li>It stays on well throughout the day and comes off easily with an eye-makeup remover.</li>
      <li>Easy to remove.  </li>
      <li>Light feel without clumps.</li>
      <li>Lashes retain a nice gentle curl, and the mascara washes off with ease at the end of the day.    </li>
      <li>I love the idea of a curling mascara and was willing to spend quite a bit</li>
      <li>My lashes are super long and not &amp;#34;spider&amp;#34; lashes lol, they look fantastic.</li>
      <li>Was exactly what was advertised and product arrived when it was suppose to!  </li>
      <li>I was looking for a more natural mascara to replace the stuff I was buying at the grocery store.</li>
      <li>Since then, kind of clumpy and definitely not producing any visible curl.</li>
      <li>Love Bare Escentuals</li>
      <li>My lashes are nice and long and I get compliments on my lashes.</li>
      <li>it drys too quickly and when u wanna do one more layer it clums since is already dry .</li>
      <li>The price on Amazon was better than buying directly from Bare Minerals, and the same price as eBay, but with free shipping.</li>
      <li>so I am pretty particular about my makeup.</li>
      <li>Despite that, I still really like this mascara.  </li>
      <li>doesn&#x27;t flake, and there continues to be a gentle curl.</li>
      <li>It really did lengthen my eye lashes.</li>
      <li>Now application is very clumpy.  </li>
      <li>I use two coats to get the amount of color/thickness I want, which isn&#x27;t overly much.  </li>
      <li>After reading the reviews I expected more.  </li>
      <li>I have naturally straight lashes</li>
      <li>With most mascaras when I&#x27;ve tried this, it&#x27;s made my lashes a crunchy, flaking mess, or it just made them really clumpy, but it worked with this one!  </li>
      <li>The curl is quite significant even when several layers are applied.</li>
      <li>I may try washing the brush completely clean before next application.  </li>
      <li>I have spent years searching for a mascara that stays on my eyes during the day and that can be removed easily.</li>
      <li>I love the mascara but would buy it from a different distributor next time.</li>
      <li>Even if I get a good curl going with a basic eyelash curler, it will go limp within a matter of minutes.</li>
      <li>It also stayed on during some eye watering from the cold without smudging, which is quite impressive for a natural mascara.  </li>
      <li>I would highly recommend not buying anything from this distributor.</li>
      <li>When I first applied this, a couple of coats, I was pleased, but wished I could get more length (and thickness/darkness, though they don&#x27;t claim this mascara does this) for my naturally quite thin and short lashes.  </li>
      <li>No thick coating.  </li>
      <li>I have lost fullness in my eyelashes and this just gives it right back to you.  </li>
      <li>I decided to try this since I love other Bare Escentuals products.  </li>
      <li>I now use a brow brush to comb through my lashes to remove any clumps and a wet cotton swab to clean under the lashes.</li>
      <li>Bare Escentuals has some great products and I&#x27;m never afraid to try something new because I have yet to be disappointed.</li>
      <li>No messy application.  </li>
      <li>Despite this, I highly recommend this mascara to anyone looking for a mascara with a lasting curl.</li>
      <li>I little bit pricey, but worth it.</li>
      <li>Longer, darker lashes that open up my smallish eyes and still looks natural.  </li>
      <li>I like that it has less chemicals, but it didn&#x27;t work very well.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Truly amazing.  Doesn&#x27;t smudge, smear or flake.  Not full of bad ingredients.  Made my eyelashes reach my eyebrows!  It is truly amazing.  Looks like I used an eyelash curler but I didn&#x27;t.   I hope they never stop making this!!!</li>
    <li> The best mascara I&#x27;ve ever used!  No clumping, adds volume, length, and curls.  The price on Amazon was better than buying directly from Bare Minerals, and the same price as eBay, but with free shipping.</li>
    <li> I have lost fullness in my eyelashes and this just gives it right back to you.  Not goopy or blobby.  Easy to remove.  Better than Lancôme.  Bare Escentuals has some great products and I&#x27;m never afraid to try something new because I have yet to be disappointed.</li>
    <li> I use bare escentuals because they don&#x27;t react negatively with my skin.  Great products.  All I use.</li>
    <li> I have allergies so I am pretty particular about my makeup. I have never felt a sensitivity after using this product for days on end and sometimes not washing it off before bed. It stays on well throughout the day and comes off easily with an eye-makeup remover.</li>
    <li> Light feel without clumps.</li>
    <li> terrible brush would not buy again</li>
    <li> Love Bare Escentuals but this didn&#x27;t work as advertised. Bought for curl, did&#x27;t curl or lengthen</li>
    <li> As the saying goes, if I had a dollar for every mascara that I have tried, I would be wealthy.  I decided to try this since I love other Bare Escentuals products.  It goes on thin and evenly, without globs or a mess. This mascara stays on all day without smudging, and comes off easily in the evening. I liked it so well, I am going to purchase some for my daughters as a present.</li>
    <li> Doesnt irritate my eyes as some do.</li>
    <li> I have used many department store and boutique mascaras. This one is definitely one of my favorites. It curls and plumps my lashes without clumping.</li>
    <li> Just average.  After reading the reviews I expected more.  I usually use Lancôme and will stick to that.  This formula is flaky and didn&#x27;t do anything to enhance my lashes.</li>
    <li> I just love this mascara.  My lashes are nice and long and I get compliments on my lashes. My lashes don&#x27;t clump.  I little bit pricey, but worth it.</li>
    <li> When I first applied this, a couple of coats, I was pleased, but wished I could get more length (and thickness/darkness, though they don&#x27;t claim this mascara does this) for my naturally quite thin and short lashes.  Later in the day I decided to try a touch-up, and that seems to be the trick with this mascara for me-- apply another coat after my first coats have dried!  With most mascaras when I&#x27;ve tried this, it&#x27;s made my lashes a crunchy, flaking mess, or it just made them really clumpy, but it worked with this one!  I love the result!  Longer, darker lashes that open up my smallish eyes and still looks natural.  Also, I have severe allergies, dermatitis, eczema, hives, etc. and have no problem with this.  It also stayed on during some eye watering from the cold without smudging, which is quite impressive for a natural mascara.  The only thing I&#x27;m finding takes getting used to is the brush-- the instructions in the box claim the brush is part of the magic, but I find it a bit awkward to work with.  I was using Tarte mascaras before this, which are nice too, but this is a bit cheaper and does give me more length.  I feel like I have to use a lot of it, but I will definitely purchase this again!</li>
    <li> After 40 years of wearing makeup I finally found a non irritating, non flaking mascara!  Thank goodness I found this product!</li>
    <li> I love the idea of a curling mascara and was willing to spend quite a bit but this was bad, bad, bad.  Perhaps I got a batch from 1982.  Not sure, but it was natsy.  Sticking to Clinique.</li>
    <li> Absolutely LOVE this product, I will not buy another brand or kind ever again.  My lashes are super long and not &amp;#34;spider&amp;#34; lashes lol, they look fantastic.</li>
    <li> Love this mascara... I like this wand and the regular flawless definition both</li>
    <li> I am Japanese-American, and it is very difficult for my hair to keep a curl. Even if I get a good curl going with a basic eyelash curler, it will go limp within a matter of minutes. Once I apply mascara, there&#x27;s no hope that it will stay curled.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fortunately, this mascara is able to darken and curl my eyelashes wonderfully. The curl is quite significant even when several layers are applied. The curl lasts all day which is AMAZING. The mascara doesn&#x27;t clump. I already have long lashes, so the \\&quot;lenghtening\\&quot; part of this mascara wasn&#x27;t noticeable to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It tends to flake a bit at the end of the day, probably around 8 hours of wear. Despite this, I highly recommend this mascara to anyone looking for a mascara with a lasting curl.</li>
    <li> I have spent years searching for a mascara that stays on my eyes during the day and that can be removed easily. This mascara has it all! It stays put like a waterproof mascara and washes off easily at the end of the day. Plus, it looks great on!</li>
    <li> My favorite mascara of all time.</li>
    <li> For the price I didn&#x27;t get what I expected. I don&#x27;t see my eyelashes curling as I expected.  However,  you don&#x27;t get a clumping mess with this brand. I&#x27;d like to have it in brown if it curled.</li>
    <li> Eh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This worked best the very first time.  Since then, kind of clumpy and definitely not producing any visible curl.</li>
    <li> Gift for daughter.  Received timely and very happy with it.  A good product and the service was very good and quick.</li>
    <li> I recommend it. It really did lengthen my eye lashes. Did not irritate my eyes.  Good deal . I&#x27;ve tried many different mascaras but this one so has been the best.</li>
    <li> I think I have finally found MY mascara after decades of searching.  Have used it for a week.  Lashes look great all day and ARE still curled even at the end of the day!  (Lash curler not used once this week.  Totally not necessary, which I think is best for the health of one&#x27;s lashes.)  No messy application.  No thick coating.  Each lash is defined.  I have long lashes to begin with, so cannot say I noticed lengthening aspect.  I use two coats to get the amount of color/thickness I want, which isn&#x27;t overly much.  Initially, I didn&#x27;t think I&#x27;d like the narrow brush, but I think the brush is one of the reasons for the No Mess application and lash definition, and maybe the curl.  Unless something changes as I use more of the tube, I have found my perfect mascara.    09/13/14 Update:  I have used this mascara every day since I wrote the above review. Application did get &#x27;clumpier&#x27; and messier as days went by. I now use a brow brush to comb through my lashes to remove any clumps and a wet cotton swab to clean under the lashes. Despite that, I still really like this mascara.  It lasts all day.  Lashes retain a nice gentle curl, and the mascara washes off with ease at the end of the day.    10/25/14 Update:  Still using this mascara every day.  Now application is very clumpy.  I dab the goopy tip of the brush in a tissue before applying the mascara. Lot of cleanup necessary around my eyes after application. At this point, I suspect the brush is the issue. I may try washing the brush completely clean before next application.  Still like the mascara as it stays on all day, doesn&#x27;t flake, and there continues to be a gentle curl.</li>
    <li> Great Service!  Was exactly what was advertised and product arrived when it was suppose to!  Will order again from this company!</li>
    <li> I buy this mascara all the time at Ulta and have loved it but when I received it from this company, it was completely dried up. I&#x27;ve never experienced anything like this before. I would highly recommend not buying anything from this distributor. I love the mascara but would buy it from a different distributor next time.</li>
    <li> suckkkkkkkkkks big time! it drys too quickly and when u wanna do one more layer it clums since is already dry .</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a healthy mascara.  I tried this based on the reviews here on Amazon.  This mascara went on clumpy and straighten my curled lashes within 1/2 hour.  I have naturally straight lashes so I curled them before applying mascara.  Very disappointed with the product and the descriptions is not accurate.  It should read &amp;#34;Bare Escentuals Clumpy Definitely Uncurl Lashes&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> Does not glide on; flakes midday. Not what I expected.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a more natural mascara to replace the stuff I was buying at the grocery store. I like that it has less chemicals, but it didn&#x27;t work very well. I am.going to stick with my. $6. Mascara from walmart.</li>
    <li> This was not what I was thinking it was But I needed up loving it anyway. I would buy it again.</li>
</ol>
