      <li>I have tried so many moisturizers looking for something that was gentle, effective, and didn&#x27;t make my nose break out.</li>
      <li>Rich texture.  </li>
      <li>It has not disappointed.  </li>
      <li>Does anyone that isnt a paid review want to weigh in on true results from this?</li>
      <li>This takes longer to absorb than others i have used, but my skin is so much softer and more glowy.  </li>
      <li>Love the glow it gives my face and has made my skin come alive!  </li>
      <li>/&gt;It is definitely worth a try if you want to get your skin glowing again.  </li>
      <li>it smells so fresh)  </li>
      <li>Blends right into my skin and leaves no residue.  </li>
      <li>my dry skin just soaked this up - after a week, deep wrinkles were nearly gone - skin supple and smooth - feels so good!</li>
      <li>The big pimple eventually went away and I have not gotten any more pimples.</li>
      <li>I out the oil on first and my face does feel a bit greasy.</li>
      <li>I have gotten used to it and don&#x27;t notice it now like I did the first time I opened the jar.  </li>
      <li>The texture is almost whipped, the scent is subtle, the effect  is the best part , it will leave even the most parched dry skin , soft and moisturized,glowing just like the jar says!</li>
      <li>My skin is sensitive and this face cream is top of the line, as far as I am concerned.</li>
      <li>Lines are softer, skin looks smooth and feels silky, some may need to spot apply this cream on dry areas, others will want to use this on full face and neck/chest.</li>
      <li>It is a very rich cream and gives your skin a lot of moisture even in dry weather or in the winter when we are enclosed in heated rooms.</li>
      <li>had they not put so much scent in it.</li>
      <li>I really like it.  </li>
      <li>It feels very hydrating but not greasy.</li>
      <li>so cant say much yet.</li>
      <li>Thanks Amazon for this product - Glow Renewal Day/Night Cream.</li>
      <li>It is very well.</li>
      <li>Modern day baby boomers, myself included, would expect a lighter fragrance.  </li>
      <li>and I have used others that cost 5x as much , in fact there is a jar of Clinique moisture surge collecting dust on my vanity, this just works so much better and costs half as much.....</li>
      <li>My new go-to!</li>
      <li>I am an older woman</li>
      <li>I consider myself and older lady now at 55.</li>
      <li>I am looking for a little more moisture, and for this I use either a BB cream or my tinted moisturizing after applying.</li>
      <li>I like the plain day cream better.</li>
      <li>That is enough to smooth across my face and get the glow back that I had in my youth.  </li>
      <li>My skin has a healthier glow and is very soft.</li>
      <li>When i have used other creams, they absorbed quickly but didnt moisturize quite enough.  </li>
      <li>Not sure if it this or the oil thats not absorbing good</li>
      <li>Like some reviewers noted, I did get a  big pimple on my cheek and a couple smaller ones that cleared up as quickly as they came out.</li>
      <li>It goes on very smoothly and is not too thick or sticky...</li>
      <li>can hardly tell I smoke 4 packs of Misty 1,000&#x27;s :)</li>
      <li>I am a mature women with normally clear skin, but this product made me break out frequently.</li>
      <li>Works well on mature skin.</li>
      <li>I was very pleasantly surprised with this cream.</li>
      <li>Leaves my face feeling refreshed, soft, and with a</li>
      <li>Skin feels soft and silky.</li>
      <li>I am in my early 40&#x27;s and</li>
      <li>After you put it on, you can&#x27;t feel it, but your skin feels soft.  </li>
      <li>I have sensitive skin prone to breakouts, and this cream hasn&#x27;t irritated it at all.</li>
      <li>so ill use it without the oil tonight to see but first and for most these people test on animals</li>
      <li>Not an exceptional product, but with L&#x27;Oreal you can&#x27;t go wrong.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not sure if it do everything it&#x27;s said to do, but I enjoy using it.</li>
      <li>but my lips were super dry yesterday and they were still dry after applied this to my face</li>
      <li>And since I barely put any on my face, the smell is almost nothing when the cream is on</li>
      <li>I was tired of paying a lot of money and not being satisfied.</li>
      <li>used to try a new cream every 3 months, but this is my third jar of this stuff and it won&#x27;t be my last.  </li>
      <li>However, I barely dab two fingers into the cream to get a very tiny amount of the cream on them.  </li>
      <li>The only downside is that it has no SPF , so you will still need to apply one during the day, I use this over my bedtime Retinol treatment and the peeling and redness is gone, and when applied under my make up, it helps it to go on smoother and keeps my skin soft all day in a dry office....</li>
      <li>have very dry sensitive skin.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I love this product!  I am in my early 40&#x27;s and my skin just loves this product:)  This is the one thing I keep re-ordering.</li>
    <li> I am an older woman but I use Proactiv, which does make my skin a little dull/dry.  I thought I&#x27;d try this to see if it would work without giving me blemishes.  I really like it.  It gives my skin a nice youthful glow with no blemishes.  However, I barely dab two fingers into the cream to get a very tiny amount of the cream on them.  That is enough to smooth across my face and get the glow back that I had in my youth.  (I use Proactiv at night only and use this in the daytime.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, the cream does have a heavy perfume smell as other reviewers have noted.  I have gotten used to it and don&#x27;t notice it now like I did the first time I opened the jar.  And since I barely put any on my face, the smell is almost nothing when the cream is on me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is definitely worth a try if you want to get your skin glowing again.  It is not giving me a permanent glow, but then I am barley putting any on.  It is doing just what I had hoped it would do.  I am very happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> Best product I&#x27;ve used for the money.  Works well on mature skin.</li>
    <li> Could be more moisturizing&lt;br /&gt;Susan C.</li>
    <li> I like the plain day cream better.</li>
    <li> Beyond moisturizing!  Feels great on and is as my staple!</li>
    <li> I have tried so many moisturizers looking for something that was gentle, effective, and didn&#x27;t make my nose break out. I&#x27;ve only used this for one week and I already see a difference in my skin. It&#x27;s smoother, pores seem smaller, no break outs on the nose or anywhere else, and it gives me a subtle glow. I&#x27;ve tried products that cost eight times more than Paris Age Perfect Glow and don&#x27;t work as well. Also, ordering it online from Amazon was $7 cheaper than Target. It&#x27;s a steal.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s an excellent cream -- very rich and smooth. I&#x27;m not sure if it do everything it&#x27;s said to do, but I enjoy using it.</li>
    <li> I gave this to my mother in law and she loved it....or that&#x27;s what she said lol</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a long time L&#x27;Oreal user.  Have tried some of the other Hydra-Nutrition creams. This is the best. Blends right into my skin and leaves no residue.  Skin feels soft and silky. Rich texture.  Love it.</li>
    <li> I was very pleasantly surprised with this cream. It&#x27;s very rich and smells great. It feels very hydrating but not greasy. I have sensitive skin prone to breakouts, and this cream hasn&#x27;t irritated it at all. It makes my skin luminous and provides a great pre-foundation layer.</li>
    <li> my dry skin just soaked this up - after a week, deep wrinkles were nearly gone - skin supple and smooth - feels so good!</li>
    <li> My skin is sensitive and this face cream is top of the line, as far as I am concerned. I use it twice per day since i am a little older, I find I need to keep my face hydrated.  I would not hesitate to buy this product again.  I know it works...</li>
    <li> I was buying this at CVS for $5 more.  Great value, excellent product.  :)</li>
    <li> this cream is great! my skin looks awesome. the texture is so nice. very happy with this item. skin is glowing</li>
    <li> Leaves my face feeling refreshed, soft, and with a glow.(And it smells so fresh)  I get so many compliments when I use this face cream!! I LOVE IT!</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive skin but found this line doesn&#x27;t leave it red nor flaky as other products can do .</li>
    <li> I think this is a good product and leaves the skin moisturized as it says.  Not an exceptional product, but with L&#x27;Oreal you can&#x27;t go wrong.  I am looking for a little more moisture, and for this I use either a BB cream or my tinted moisturizing after applying.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried a lot of face cream and this one is best.  Better than Mary Kay, clinique, juice beauty, murad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have very dry sensitive skin.  I tend to get a little flakiness on my forehead and cheeks.  After cleansing my skin is always tight and dry and itchy.  When i have used other creams, they absorbed quickly but didnt moisturize quite enough.  This one moisturizers A LOT.  It gives my skin a dewy glow which i have never had before because I&#x27;m dry.  This takes longer to absorb than others i have used, but my skin is so much softer and more glowy.  I have seen a decrease in wrinkles because of this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used to try a new cream every 3 months, but this is my third jar of this stuff and it won&#x27;t be my last.  My new go-to!</li>
    <li> I love this brand and this cream, specifically, and I depend on Amazon to bring it to my daughter&#x27;s house, an she takes it to me. Great job of Amazon, tks a lot!!</li>
    <li> The best high quality face cream, you get ever buy for this price. It is really one of the best in the market.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t feel it lives up to the hype....not good.</li>
    <li> My skin always feels a little dry even in humid Louisiana.  I  have tried numerous products, and heartily recommend this one.  After you put it on, you can&#x27;t feel it, but your skin feels soft.  I bought it locally, but for whatever reason, it has not been stocked lately.  So glad to have found in on Amazon and at a cheaper price.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m in love with this product! I have not use drugstore products in years. I&#x27;m in my 40&#x27;s and my skin can get dry. I was tired of paying a lot of money and not being satisfied. I decided to try drug store products that have been around for a while and i started with Oil of Olay. I was so disappointed. I&#x27;d never used L&#x27;Oreal before but I decided to give it a try. Like some reviewers noted, I did get a  big pimple on my cheek and a couple smaller ones that cleared up as quickly as they came out. I decided to keep using the moisturizer. The big pimple eventually went away and I have not gotten any more pimples. Maybe my skin just needed to get used to the products. My skin has a healthier glow and is very soft. I will definitely look into other L&#x27;Oreal products and maybe replace what I&#x27;m currently using.</li>
    <li> Just bought this and have been using with the oil they sell. I out the oil on first and my face does feel a bit greasy. Not sure if it this or the oil thats not absorbing good so ill use it without the oil tonight to see but first and for most these people test on animals so I won&#x27;t buy this again. Second the ingredient list looks like what the professor used to create Frankenstein. Does anyone that isnt a paid review want to weigh in on true results from this? Ive only had it two days so cant say much yet. Skin moist and I have dry skin but my lips were super dry yesterday and they were still dry after applied this to my face so......im in limbo on this. Its $22+ so its up there in price to contend with other brands that deliver</li>
    <li> can hardly tell I smoke 4 packs of Misty 1,000&#x27;s :)</li>
    <li> I love this cream and the way it goes on to my skin. It makes my skin glow. I like wearing it under my makeup.</li>
    <li> I chose this cream due to other reviews, the brand and the results.  It has not disappointed.  It is a very rich cream and gives your skin a lot of moisture even in dry weather or in the winter when we are enclosed in heated rooms.</li>
    <li> It does give a person that glowing affect.</li>
    <li> WORKS GREAT.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DEB K</li>
    <li> Has a perfume smell, wish it didn&#x27;t ..too strong.</li>
    <li> I bought this cream and was looking forward to trying.  As soon as I opened it, that heavy(old lady) perfume smell gave me a headache.  I consider myself and older lady now at 55. This stuff smells like creams did back in the seventies.  I put it on my face and it felt and looked terrific.. so, I don&#x27;t know if I can stand to continue to use it because of the odor.  Very disappointed.  Modern day baby boomers, myself included, would expect a lighter fragrance.  I want performance not perfume.</li>
    <li> The latest in the Age Perfect Line, for those who want/need intense moisture but want a softer feel to the product, well this delivers!  The texture is almost whipped, the scent is subtle, the effect  is the best part , it will leave even the most parched dry skin , soft and moisturized,glowing just like the jar says! Lines are softer, skin looks smooth and feels silky, some may need to spot apply this cream on dry areas, others will want to use this on full face and neck/chest. The only downside is that it has no SPF , so you will still need to apply one during the day, I use this over my bedtime Retinol treatment and the peeling and redness is gone, and when applied under my make up, it helps it to go on smoother and keeps my skin soft all day in a dry office....love this cream and I have used others that cost 5x as much , in fact there is a jar of Clinique moisture surge collecting dust on my vanity, this just works so much better and costs half as much.....love it!</li>
    <li> It is so heavily scented that I can&#x27;t use it. It would be very nice had they not put so much scent in it.</li>
    <li> I am a mature women with normally clear skin, but this product made me break out frequently. It says to use am and pm, but I found it a bit too heavy and greasy for daytime usage.  I am buying something else and will use the remainder of the jar as hand cream.  Too bad, it&#x27;s not cheap.......</li>
