    <li> like it for the hold, but leaves white flakes on your hair</li>
    <li> Best hairspray in the world.</li>
    <li> too wet, too expensive for being that wet</li>
    <li> Super firm hold, layerable, smells divine, and is never, ever sticky. Got a bottle on an Aveda shop guy&#x27;s recommendation right after it came out a few years ago, and haven&#x27;t bought any other type of hair spray since. Love it. If they ever discontinue this stuff, I *will* picket their corporate headquarters.</li>
    <li> I AM VERY PLEASED WITH THIS PRODUCT.  IT KEEPS MY HAIR IN PLACE ALL DAY AND  MY HAIR LOOKS VERY HEALTHY AND I HAVE NO DANDRUFF. I WILL RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT TO MY FRIENDS AND FAMILY MEMBERS.</li>
    <li> I ordered three items of Aveeda. One was this Pure Abundance Hair spray.  Condtioner came within a very short while. Still waiting on the shampoo but the hair spray just arrived yesterday. Well, I used a tad on my hand to feel it and the odor of this product blew me away. Unlike another poster stating a devine smell,  this smell was all but devine.  It had a strong medicinal, alcohol, smell.  I could not use this product and smell this bad.  I called Amazon and they are taking care of this. Never again, will I buy health/beauty products on line.</li>
    <li> I normally go thru a huge bttle of hair spray in about a month. This product has last me for 3 months. It has great hold and does not make your air stiff.</li>
    <li> As one reviewer already said...smells GREAT.  Makes me feel like I just stepped out of a spa.  This product really holds, and I have noticed a substantial difference in volume.  It can be a bit stiff, but I find that hand-combing through it will leave a style perfectly in place, but with plenty of movement.  I&#x27;ll never buy anything else - but I WILL purchase this from my local salon from now on - price is actually cheaper AND I get my Aveda points.  Sorry Amazon!  Great product, though.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for several years and I simply love it. It holds without being too firm, but is just enough that I can spray it and still work with my hair. Great product.</li>
    <li> Although I love the Pure Abundance shampoo and conditioner, i can do without this product. I see no difference in volume. Now for an updo, when you dont want a single hair to move, it would be fine, but you cant comb through it without breaking hair.</li>
    <li> Recieved this product very fast...holds my hair well when i curl it. Con..Only wish it gave the more natural look then the stiff look and I dont spray alot. Otherwise a good product</li>
    <li> my hair is very fine and soft. This product gives it really the volume. It makes my hair a bit stiff if used in abundance but for a hold it&#x27;s perfect for my hair.</li>
    <li> Very expensive but works well</li>
    <li> Bought this while I was in New Orleans. Got suckered in by the giant television screen displaying a model with big voluminous hair! Took it home, tried it and nothing! My hair is flatter to my scalp than if I&#x27;d used no product at all!  And it smells awful! I live 2 1/2 hrs. from where I purchased it. Would be a waste of gas to return the product.:/</li>
    <li> Another great Aveda product. My hair is thin and wavy, and this makes my hair look full and holds the style. I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> It is great!! I just love the hair spray. Its the only hair spray that helps style and keep my hair in place.</li>
    <li> Another gift and I use the product also.</li>
    <li> This is by far the best hairspray for my fine textured hair.  I have tried many other brands/formulas but, nothing compares to this.  Great hold and still a natural look to the finished style (No &#x27;Something About Mary&#x27; gloop: )&lt;br /&gt;The spray comes out light and you can layer to make as firm a hold as you desire.  The scent is great!  Love Pure Abundance, as well as the whole scent line.  This has been my stand by product for ten years now.  It can&#x27;t be beat IMO.</li>
    <li> Been using it for almost 20 years. The stuff works great, no real fragrance.</li>
    <li> Great hold. Clean feeling.</li>
    <li> I learned about Aveda products the last time I got my hair cut.  Love the smell, it is Rosemary and basil if I&#x27;m not mistaken.  This spray does a great job of holding without being stiff of sticky.  I will order this again.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent product.  I am very satisfied!</li>
    <li> Oniy hairspray I use!</li>
    <li> Best hair products on the market.</li>
