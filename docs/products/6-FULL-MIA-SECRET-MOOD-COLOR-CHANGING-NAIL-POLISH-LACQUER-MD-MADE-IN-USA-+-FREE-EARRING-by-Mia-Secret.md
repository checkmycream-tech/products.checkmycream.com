    <li> Nail Polish is too light and chips off easily. Excellent color change but doesn&#x27;t stay on long. It starts chipping immediately after application.</li>

    <li> Didn&#x27;t change colors at all. And the eating are junk. Sticker earing would have been better. The polish doesn&#x27;t change no mater how thick you put it on. Wish I could return it but I don&#x27;t want to pay for shipping, plus some of the polish color my niece likes even tho they don&#x27;t change color like they are supposed too. Just wish I could have saved some money. It&#x27;s not even worth the one atar rating</li>
