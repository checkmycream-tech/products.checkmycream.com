      <li>Really good mask.  </li>
      <li>You get a good product for what you pay for.&lt;br</li>
      <li>so you can conform it to your face if it doesn&#x27;t fit perfectly.  </li>
      <li>I love this blindfold!</li>
      <li>Very Comfortable, Very Cheap, Very nicely designed&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
      <li>These are good at blocking out light</li>
      <li>It looked pretty good on the website, but even better in person!</li>
      <li>Works great for pin the tail on the donkey ;)</li>
      <li>Enjoy!</li>
      <li>Just dont mess with other brand, buy form the best, its very nice quality, is the best !</li>
      <li>Perfect for sleeping or keeping your significant other wondering what you are doing.</li>
      <li>With the time change I needed a cheap and easy way to &amp;#34;go dark&amp;#34; at 530 pm every night.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Couple of quick cuts with the sissors and its much better.</li>
      <li>Works fairly well and is very cheap, but you get what you pay for because it started coming apart after only a month.</li>
      <li>Absolutely great for getting that extra light out if your eyes when sleeping on a plane or taking a nap.</li>
      <li>The mask blocks out all of the light.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m really light sensitve.</li>
      <li>It is comfortable and does the job.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s comfortable on your face</li>
      <li>but if it doesn&#x27;t fit the profile of your nose,  you can see under it and it lets in light.  </li>
      <li>Wife likes it when we play and to block out light for sleeping too.</li>
      <li>meaning, it blocks out all light.</li>
      <li>Those who said it lets light in the bottom have not adjusted the Velcro strap.</li>
      <li>you can blink freely.</li>
      <li>The blindfold lets a lot of light get in through the bottom.  </li>
      <li>Not necessarily sexy looking, but does a great job of keeping the light out!</li>
      <li>and they responded quickly.</li>
      <li>So for a cheap price you get alot haha.</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s holding up so far :-)</li>
      <li>soft, comfortable, oversized so really blocks out the light</li>
      <li>;)</li>
      <li>But I must admit, it&#x27;s VERY uncomfortble!</li>
      <li>Like most people mentioned you can see out the bottom a little, especially if you got a big honker like me lol.</li>
      <li>as it rests above the nose and will let light through.&lt;br</li>
      <li>There might be a teeny bit of light leakage through the nose, depending on the shape of yours, but really tiny.</li>
      <li>ill definitly buy again, thanks amazon for another great buy ; ill recomend it for anyone who likes and who want the best</li>
      <li>/&gt;It really does help for sleeping, and it could also be double as a fun toy in bed.</li>
      <li>It blocks out most light, but is uncomfortable by the noise.</li>
      <li>the eye cover is very soft,  </li>
      <li>They need to be a little more supple, and also to have a wire or flat bendable metal at the nose</li>
      <li>Other than that it&#x27;s exactly as described.</li>
      <li>Basically the portion that goes directly over your eye bulges outward, so that if you have your eyes open when the mask is on your eyelids and eyelashes won&#x27;t touch the material.</li>
      <li>: strap could be broken easily.</li>

    <li> I love this blindfold!</li>
    <li> the eye cover is very soft,  but it&#x27;s padded almost like a bra. It&#x27;s comfortable on your face but if it doesn&#x27;t fit the profile of your nose,  you can see under it and it lets in light.  They need to be a little more supple, and also to have a wire or flat bendable metal at the nose so you can conform it to your face if it doesn&#x27;t fit perfectly.  Not bad, but not a perfect seal either.</li>
    <li> My girl loves this blindfold!! She says it&#x27;s the best fitting one we have gotten!!</li>
    <li> The mask blocks out all of the light. Perfect for sleeping or keeping your significant other wondering what you are doing.</li>
    <li> Just dont mess with other brand, buy form the best, its very nice quality, is the best ! ill definitly buy again, thanks amazon for another great buy ; ill recomend it for anyone who likes and who want the best</li>
    <li> I use this to sleep with. And it does the trick... meaning, it blocks out all light. But I must admit, it&#x27;s VERY uncomfortble! I bought it and don&#x27;t even use it. Money wasted.</li>
    <li> It is comfortable and does the job. There might be a teeny bit of light leakage through the nose, depending on the shape of yours, but really tiny. If your head moves a lot the (Velcor) strap might slip on your head, but it tightens well.  I had a question about the invoice and they responded quickly.</li>
    <li> With the time change I needed a cheap and easy way to &amp;#34;go dark&amp;#34; at 530 pm every night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The mask works well BUT will not work well with some one who uses a cpap machine (Me!) as it rests above the nose and will let light through.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is a &amp;#34;bra&amp;#34; for your eyes (the look anyway) but ...if you can not see anyone ...who cares?;)</li>
    <li> The blindfold lets a lot of light get in through the bottom.  I was hoping for a complete black out.</li>
    <li> Could not function without these. Have four pairs. Keep one in my suitcase at all times. I&#x27;m really light sensitve.</li>
    <li> It looked pretty good on the website, but even better in person! Absolutely great for getting that extra light out if your eyes when sleeping on a plane or taking a nap.</li>
    <li> Works fairly well and is very cheap, but you get what you pay for because it started coming apart after only a month.</li>
    <li> I work nights, and this product works perfectly. Those who said it lets light in the bottom have not adjusted the Velcro strap. Best feature: not pushing against my eyelids- you can blink freely. Next time I put an order in, I&#x27;m grabbing a second one.</li>
    <li> Works great for pin the tail on the donkey ;)</li>
    <li> It blocks out most light, but is uncomfortable by the noise. Couple of quick cuts with the sissors and its much better. You get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> Really good mask.  I like the inside of it, it doesn&#x27;t touch your eyes so you can open them.  I&#x27;m going to use it when I go for my MRI.</li>
    <li> works as says it does...easy to adjust and use what else is there to say about a blindfold over than it works?</li>
    <li> This blindfold seams to be very good , I&#x27;m very happy with it and recommend this , easy to put on and wear</li>
    <li> Pros: Very Comfortable, Very Cheap, Very nicely designed&lt;br /&gt;Cons: strap could be broken easily. But that is about it. You get a good product for what you pay for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It really does help for sleeping, and it could also be double as a fun toy in bed. So for a cheap price you get alot haha. Enjoy!</li>

    <li> girl friend likes how it is used!</li>
    <li> soft, comfortable, oversized so really blocks out the light</li>
    <li> Great blindfold. Does not put pressure on your eyes. Wife likes it when we play and to block out light for sleeping too. Great price.</li>
    <li> Like most people mentioned you can see out the bottom a little, especially if you got a big honker like me lol. Other than that it&#x27;s exactly as described. The stitching on the straps doesn&#x27;t look to be the greatest but it&#x27;s holding up so far :-)</li>
