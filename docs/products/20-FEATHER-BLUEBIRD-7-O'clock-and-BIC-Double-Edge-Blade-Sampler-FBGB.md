### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>me, the Wilkinson Sword blades were the best over-all in terms of shaving comfort, closeness of shave and length of time</li>
      <li>For this purpose this product is perfect.</li>
      <li>This pack helped me realize that the Gillete 7O&#x27;Clock blades were the best for me.</li>
      <li>Then buy the blade that works best for you.</li>
      <li>When I started shaving with a DE razor, I did not know what blades would work best for me.</li>
      <li>Hope to make a decision soon on which blade works best for me.</li>
      <li>Sharks are the best.</li>
      <li>Feather seems to be touted as the best so now I can compare</li>
      <li>I wanted to join others in recommending this sample pack for those trying to find which blades work best for them.  </li>
      <li>I found feather the best.</li>
      <li>Let me start by saying I agree with all those that recommend trying a variety of blades to determine what works best for your skin/beard type and razor.</li>
      <li>But the feathers were the best.</li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t tried before to find the perfect shave for me.</li>
      <li>I started with the bics and was impressed.</li>
      <li>and I have to say the Bic and Feather brands perform the best for my face.  </li>
      <li>This was perfect.</li>
      <li>, I got a very good shave from all.</li>
      <li>This was a great help in finding the blades that worked best for my face.  </li>
      <li>Great multi-pack to help you decide what type of blade works best for your face/skin type.  </li>
      <li>, good to figure out what works best for you.</li>
      <li>so I bought this variety pack and happy I did.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Really great package though</li>
      <li>This was a great opportunity to try some blades</li>
      <li>Just purchased DE razor, so this was a great package to let me feel out each blade.  </li>
      <li>The bics are great.  </li>
      <li>Happy shaving.</li>
      <li>but they&#x27;re all great at delivering results.  </li>
      <li>Great for those straight/safety blade novices out there.</li>
      <li>I liked the 7 O&#x27;clock&#x27;s best and have been using them ever since.</li>
      <li>Great variety of quality blades.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve already found 1-2 favorites, but the ability to try the others was great.</li>
      <li>Nice sample kit to figure which blades you like and works best for your skin and shaving style or preferences.</li>
      <li>Good package and great price.  </li>
      <li>so this makes sure that you&#x27;re getting the best blade for you.</li>
      <li>I used each of these blades and like most folks have said the Feather are the sharpest and the best in my opinion.</li>
      <li>These are one of the most popular blades out there, great for figuring out which quality blade is perfect for you face.</li>
      <li>then jumped in with the Feather Blade which was easily the best of the set.</li>
      <li>Great razors love the variety!</li>
      <li>Good set of blades to try and figure out which ones you like.  </li>
      <li>good selection.</li>
      <li>Now that I&#x27;ve tried all the blades, I can say this is a really good set.</li>
      <li>Have been using these blades and all are good.</li>
      <li>Good sampler pack.</li>
      <li>Good quality blades.</li>
      <li>but you do get a good selection.</li>
      <li>I like this combo pack for the fact that it includes a good variety of blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>/&gt;Yes, good product, came as advertised.</li>
      <li>Good package for finding out what works for you.</li>
      <li>the feather.&lt;br /&gt;The rest of them just play a tug of war with every hair on my face, with a fair chance of razor burn.&lt;br</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a good starter pack.  </li>
      <li>All the blades were of good quality.</li>
      <li>I purchased this variety pack and also the Wilkinson Sword and Astra Superior Platinum  DE Blades.</li>
      <li>but it is a fairly diverse range of quality blades.</li>
      <li>Its the perfect starter pack to learn which blade is best for your skin and facial hair.</li>
      <li>so I&#x27;m sure my never again blades would work great for others.</li>
      <li>Both are good blades with a nice edge.  </li>
      <li>but I wanted to try out a sampler to see what would be best for my face and this is exactly what I wanted.  </li>
      <li>The Gillette 7 O&#x27;clock blades were a pleasant surprise, I will get more of these soon.</li>
      <li>I found the bluebirds usable and the feathers to be amazing</li>
      <li>Nice way to get into safety razor shaving</li>
      <li>razor gets its own blade.</li>
      <li>absolutely the best shave I have ever had.</li>
      <li>When I ran out of blades, I decided to do some research on the absolute best makes and models of double-edge blades.  </li>
      <li>I would rather stick to the derby extras, way more inexpensive and great quality, won&#x27;t pull and its smooth on your face.</li>
      <li>Surgical sharpness, great for super close shaves.</li>
      <li>Good price and quick shipping, too!</li>
      <li>This is a great variety pack for a starter, definately worth the price.</li>
      <li>Good way to try many different razors to choose what&#x27;s best for you.</li>
      <li>I found the Gillette to also be a good blade, providing a smooth shave without pulling.  </li>
      <li>Gives you a good idea of the quality of some of the better razors available.</li>
      <li>Shipping was quick, and packaging was good.</li>
      <li>and I didn&#x27;t need 100 blades that I wasn&#x27;t sure</li>
      <li>so I ordered 100 more.</li>
      <li>I was also able to share some with family to try also.</li>
      <li>I found the Feather&#x27;s to be the sharpest and more durable</li>
      <li>so I decided to hold off and get more EXP using another blade.</li>
      <li>Yes, this costs more than a pack of any of these blades</li>
      <li>although not my favorite</li>
      <li>Although many people prefer the Feather Brand, I found these blades a bit too aggressive for me, leaving razor burns and more nicks.</li>
      <li>This will help you find out which blades work better for you.</li>
      <li>The bic seem better than the blades that came with my Merkur razor.  </li>
      <li>top blades</li>
      <li>The gillettes are more so so.  </li>
      <li>so I took the recommendations of those &#x27;in the know&#x27; and tried a sample pack to see which blades felt better.  </li>
      <li>the feathers and Derby&#x27;s are ok the 7O&#x27;clocks</li>
      <li>Most favorite.</li>
      <li>Sure beats the overpriced multi-blade razor heads that must be replaced every 3 or 4 shaves.  </li>
      <li>like my face better.</li>
      <li>(In my case, I had already tried one of the four, but you can&#x27;t have too many Feather blades.)  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;d even say it was enjoyable.  </li>
      <li>With everones face being so different, you may need more razors to find the one that works best for you.</li>
      <li>I needed some more aggressive razors and these are perfect for different levels of sharpness.</li>
      <li>Got more nicks with the gillette and bic.</li>
      <li>My first double-edge safety razor was made by Feather, so of course it came with the (legendary) Feather Hi Stainless blades.  </li>
      <li>This is a good and reasonably priced sampler pack of blades.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s great to be able to sample different blades...</li>
      <li>Good selection for new de shaving.</li>
      <li>Good sampler of blades if you want to be exposed to new brands.</li>
      <li>I was new to this type of razor, and thought the multi-pack would be a good way to choose which blades I preferred.</li>
      <li>If this is your first time buying go for a better set with more blades.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Have been using these blades and all are good. Haven&#x27;t found difference in feeling when shaving but Feather should be sharpest of them all.</li>
    <li> Everyone has different opinions about razor blades, but here&#x27;s mine: Most everyone regards Feathers as the industry standard, no argument here. The Gillette 7 O&#x27;clock blades were a pleasant surprise, I will get more of these soon. The BlueBirds seem very similar to the Egyptian Sharks that are my daily go-to blade. And the less said about the Bic&#x27;s the better.</li>
    <li> Sharks are the best. Able to compare the others but wasted a lot of blades. Should have just went with the Sharks.</li>
    <li> Although I would recommend buying a larger variety of blades at first, this is a good starter set to help you decide which blade is right for me. I personally find the feather blades to be of the best quality and the Derby to be the worst.</li>
    <li> Great variety of quality blades. I needed some more aggressive razors and these are perfect for different levels of sharpness.</li>
    <li> glad i got the sample pack, as this was my first time using a safety razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the feather blades are without a doubt the best of this pack, the gillette on the other hand gave me crazy razor bumps on my chin and neck, and i threw them away after the first blade</li>
    <li> Blades arrived on time and as advertised. All the blades were of good quality. I didn&#x27;t throw any of them away, I got a very good shave from all. The Bics are a little too mean for my neck and jaw line but are still useable.</li>
    <li> Great pack of sampler blades, not only do you get a diverse choice of blades but they&#x27;re all great at delivering results.  Stupendous price for the number of blades and shaves I have acquired.  Not only are they inexpensive, but considering these razor blade brands, you will undoubtedly experience a closer and cleaner shave.  Sure beats the overpriced multi-blade razor heads that must be replaced every 3 or 4 shaves.  These stay clean, sharp, and durable 3 or 4 shaves in.  Moreover, when used properly with a stainless steel DE razor (the multi-blade razor gets dirty and needs replacement after a year or two of use), you will experience a different, more enjoyable, and closer shave then ever before.  I definitely recommend wet shaving and using these 4 brands for those who want to avoid paying exorbitant prices and want to look better for a longer period of time.  Ohhh, and did I mention how enjoyable and nostalgic wet shaving is?  Happy shaving.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only made my way through the Blubirds, but picked this pack for it&#x27;s inclusion of what seemed like the most common and widely available blades. I have heard that the Feathers were the sharpest and not many of the combo packs contained these blades.</li>
    <li> Bought because I wanted to try the Feather blades. Received 2 Bluebirds, 1 Bic, and 1 Gillette 7 O&#x27;clock.  Bic are good just don&#x27;t last very long. Bluebirds feel like they pull the hair out instead of cutting.  Haven&#x27;t tried the Gillette yet.</li>
    <li> Im new to shaving with a saftey razor and I didn&#x27;t need 100 blades that I wasn&#x27;t sure would work for me. This was perfect. I got to try a few different types of blades without having mass amounts of ones that I didn&#x27;t want.</li>
    <li> I switched over to wet shaving about 6 months ago and will never look back.  I had no idea what I was doing so I took the recommendations of those &#x27;in the know&#x27; and tried a sample pack to see which blades felt better.  Everyone&#x27;s face is different as is everyone&#x27;s tolerance for dragging a sharp piece of metal across hairy skin.  I found the Feather&#x27;s to be the sharpest and more durable (they last about 4 shaves).  I liked the Derbys and Bluebirds equally but found that they lasted about 3 shaves on my face.  I wasn&#x27;t too crazy about the 7&#x27;oclocks and will hold them in reserve in case I ever get caught without a Feather.  Try wet shaving, much closer shave, and far less expensive than cartridges.  I also noticed that I tend to &#x27;slow down&#x27; and pay more attention to what I am doing.  I&#x27;d even say it was enjoyable.  What do I do with all of these old blades?!  I used an old empty Altoids tin.  When I fill it up I&#x27;ll hammer it down and toss it to let it rust away...</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s great to be able to sample different blades...I&#x27;ve already found 1-2 favorites, but the ability to try the others was great. I was also able to share some with family to try also. Breaking the blade in half doubles the total. Thanks!</li>
    <li> This is probably the best straight razor set for anyone just starting out with wet shaving.  Gives you a good idea of the quality of some of the better razors available.</li>
    <li> A nice little sampler set of blades to go with my very first Merkur.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I heard that the Feather Blade was the sharpest out there, so I decided to hold off and get more EXP using another blade. I started with the Blue Bird and it was pretty good. The BIC unfortunately felt pretty bad. It felt like I was shaving with a cheap single blade disposable razor. I stopped using it immediately.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I then jumped in with the Feather Blade which was easily the best of the set. Extremely sharp and smooth shave. I didn&#x27;t even hear the rasping sound of my rough facial hair being cut. It simply glided right over with ease.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this set to anyone wanting to try out blades for the first time. The Feather blades already make it worth it, and the rest are sort of a bonus if you end up getting a better feel out of it.</li>
    <li> Great for those straight/safety blade novices out there. Feather brand is the stand out of these blades and the rest do not even come close to the ease and comfort that Feather provides when shaving.</li>
    <li> Not much to say that hasn&#x27;t already about this pack. I was looking for a sampler pack with small numbers of each type in case some were bad. For this purpose this product is perfect. Now I&#x27;m not stuck with 10 of the Gillette&#x27;s that I&#x27;ll never use because it feels like a snow plow dragging across my face. I also didn&#x27;t think it would be necessary to try 10 different brands to find one I liked, figuring if I couldn&#x27;t find something nice in this size sampler it was probably a problem with my technique and not the blades.</li>
    <li> I highly recommend a starter pack for double edged razor shaving. Everyone is different and you cannot rely on popular opinion to choose a razor that works for you.</li>
    <li> Over priced, but it&#x27;s nice to try out different blades. The Gillette blades are absolute crap, the Feather blades are were my favorite. I will be buying a 100 pack of the Feather blades.</li>
    <li> What can be said that hasn&#x27;t already been said?  It&#x27;s four different brands, five blades each.  It&#x27;s a good starter pack.  The only downside to this purchase is that they sent me the sampler pack via FedEx SmartPost (which is a FedEx shipment but it is handled by USPS for delivery).  Had I known that was their preferred shipping method, I would have probably used a different seller or changed my shipping options.  I loathe SmartPost - nothing but horror stories.  But the product itself is solid and worth the price they charged.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WISH4STAR...stop using SmartPost!  Seriously!</li>
    <li> nice selection of different blades to try for the price.  the old saying &amp;#34;your mileage may vary&amp;#34; definitely applies to double edge razors. some people swear by feather, others wont use anything but gillette or bluebird.  the only way to figure out which is right for you is to try a few until you find your best fit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;very happily leaving the expensive and eco-angry world of cartridges behind.  sometimes the old ways are better!</li>
    <li> The Gillette 7o&#x27;clock have become my regular choice. Each brand is different, you should find one to your liking.</li>
    <li> Just purchased DE razor, so this was a great package to let me feel out each blade.  After a  few weeks, felt brave enough to try the Feather, well worth the wait and will chose this one for now on.</li>
    <li> Even though this set is pricey, I chose it because it had a small selection of what seems to be the most popular blades. I use these in an Edwin Jagger De86bl, so this review applies to that particular razor and blade combination.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Blue Bird: Solid razor. No complaints. Nothing special, nothing terrible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bic: Tied for last. Dull after two shaves, pulls at the hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Feather: Tied for last. Surgical sharpness, great for super close shaves. Left me with the most nicks, however. Unforgiving blade, you will cut yourself if you touch the razor to your face at even a slightly incorrect angle. Dulls after one, maybe two shaves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;7 O&#x27;Clock: Most favorite. These are what I will be using from here on out. Not Feather sharp, but lasts long and maintains its edge. Very forgiving with the De86bl. Least amount of nicks, comfortable shave, lasts up to five shaves on my (not thick) beard.</li>
    <li> I wish I would have never tried this. Other than confirming that Feather is amazing, this pack is garbage. I could only use the Bic for about 4 days before changing them out. I wouldn&#x27;t even try Blue Bird of the 7 O&#x27;clock if I were you, they were like shaving with a meat grinder. I never tried feather blades until this pack. Save your time, money, and face, go with Feather and have a smooth day.</li>
    <li> I bought this to try out the Bic and Feather blades. I was not dissapointed with any of them and will definetley be ordering the 100 pack of Bic blades absolutely the best shave I have ever had.</li>
    <li> Good package for finding out what works for you. Made me realize that I needed to go ahead and buy a 100pack of feathers. Liked the feathers and blue birds the most. Got more nicks with the gillette and bic.</li>
    <li> With everones face being so different, you may need more razors to find the one that works best for you. Feather is awesome as it is expensive. Its a great blade to go to when you miss a day shaving but for a daily shave it might be too expensive and actually over shave your face. If this is your first time buying go for a better set with more blades. You will not need 5 of each to figure out if you love/hate a blade. I found feather the best. While Bic and Bluebird marred my face badly and Gillette did alright for a daily shave but only with the grain. Also, I have extremely sensitive skin and VERY course facial hair.</li>
    <li> Feathers are still considered to be the sharpest razor blade currently in production, but, frankly....they&#x27;re scary sharp.&lt;br /&gt;BIC&#x27;s are nearly as sharp as Feather...for about 1 shave, then they get as dull as a butter knife.&lt;br /&gt;7&#x27;OClock green box is just so-so...it&#x27;s is neither sharp enough nor dull enough to either cut my beard or be annoying.&lt;br /&gt;Bluebird is a pretty good blade.  It&#x27;s not super sharp, but, it&#x27;s sharp enough, doesn&#x27;t tug and lasts for several shaves.  it&#x27;s on my list of blades to keep...although not my favorite so far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This selection would have gotten 5 stars, but, for the fact it&#x27;s just a so-so sampler...nothing exciting, mostly just run of the mill.</li>
    <li> Great razors love the variety!</li>
    <li> A fantastic starter kit. I worked my way up to the Feathers and never looked back.  Yes, this costs more than a pack of any of these blades but you do get a good selection. Pony up and explore. Then buy the blade that works best for you.</li>
    <li> This is not a bad sampler pack that are meant for double edge razor. By far, the Feather blades were the sharpest blades in the pack and favorite. You definitely need to shave carefully with these blades or else you would nic your face pretty bad. The Gillette and Bic blades where the next in line. The blue bird didn&#x27;t really do it for me. Everyone has a different preference of what they demand from their blades and this sampler pack provides four different types.</li>
    <li> Good way to try many different razors to choose what&#x27;s best for you.</li>
    <li> This is a great variety pack for a starter, definately worth the price. The feather pack of ten this has is worth the price itself. These are one of the most popular blades out there, great for figuring out which quality blade is perfect for you face. I know there are better variety packs, but they are more expensive. I like the feathers since they are a lot sharper. I would rather stick to the derby extras, way more inexpensive and great quality, won&#x27;t pull and its smooth on your face. I&#x27;d say, give them a try and for the price, you&#x27;ll like them.</li>
    <li> I heard different blades have different quality so I bought this variety pack and happy I did. Feather seems to be touted as the best so now I can compare</li>
    <li> This is a good and reasonably priced sampler pack of blades. I highly suggest picking up a sampler pack if you are new to wet shaving. This will help you find out which blades work better for you. Everyone&#x27;s face is different and their choice of blades will be different.</li>
    <li> Good selection for new de shaving.</li>
    <li> Decent assortment for the budget conscientious looking for an assortment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ended up going to a third party website (West Coast Shaving) and was able to cherry pick my blade sample packs for around $2 each.</li>
    <li> wanted to try the sample pack as the ones contained are recommended by long time wet shaving enthusiasts. the feathers and Derby&#x27;s are ok the 7O&#x27;clocks like my face better. Feather is highly recommended but I didnt find the one blade I used so far to be that \\&quot;awesome\\&quot;. the product sample pack served its purpose..Trial pack....</li>
    <li> I wanted to join others in recommending this sample pack for those trying to find which blades work best for them.  I found the Gillette to also be a good blade, providing a smooth shave without pulling.  The Bluebirds have been OK thus far, a little less effective than the Gillette for me.  The Bic blades for some reason are completely unusable!  I mean, instant pull and pain, and I tried it in a couple different razors with a second blade.  I had Bic in a previous sample pack that was OK, but these were awful.  I don&#x27;t know what has changed, but you are in effect getting 3 packs of 5 blades to use with this sample pack.</li>
    <li> This was a great help in finding the blades that worked best for my face.  Highly recommended. Everyone likes a different type of blade so this makes sure that you&#x27;re getting the best blade for you.</li>
    <li> Good set of blades to try and figure out which ones you like.  Be careful with the feather!</li>
    <li> Bought these over a year ago and still haven&#x27;t used half of them. Cartridge razors are a scam!</li>
    <li> I have thick coarse facial hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only blade in the pack that&#x27;s worth anything is the feather.&lt;br /&gt;The rest of them just play a tug of war with every hair on my face, with a fair chance of razor burn.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t bother if you have thick facial hair just buy a feather, or your just gonna end up having a bad shave.</li>
    <li> My first double-edge safety razor was made by Feather, so of course it came with the (legendary) Feather Hi Stainless blades.  When I ran out of blades, I decided to do some research on the absolute best makes and models of double-edge blades.  Luckily for me, the online &amp;#34;wet shave&amp;#34; community is very prolific!  It turns out that the Feather Hi Stainless blade is considered top notch, and one of the sharpest (if not THE sharpest) blades on the market.  None the less, I read countless recommendations to try different combinations of blade and handle, and that results vary by face (i.e, person).  Hence, the countless sampler packs that you see online.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I did my research, and came up with a list of about six top-of-the-line blades that I wanted to try; this sampler pack includes four of them!  (In my case, I had already tried one of the four, but you can&#x27;t have too many Feather blades.)  At a little over 50 cents a blade, it is one of the best deals for double-edge blades on the market.</li>
    <li> What is it:&lt;br /&gt;Sample pack of DE razor blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I liked:&lt;br /&gt;Came exactly as advertised with the blades listed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great way to get an intro to various DE razors when starting out and try a good variety of razor sharpness and types.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Each face is different, so the only way to know what&#x27;ll work for you is to keep trying different blades until you find one that works well!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I didn&#x27;t like:&lt;br /&gt;Nothing - this pack came as advertised.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would I buy it again/recommend it?&lt;br /&gt;Yes, good product, came as advertised.</li>
    <li> I like this combo pack for the fact that it includes a good variety of blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At the end of the day, you can tell the quality difference between the Feather blades and everything else in the pack.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You get what you pay for, but since it is so cheap, you might find a blade that you like in the pack.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well worth the money to learn what is good (or bad)</li>
    <li> I need to be clear and state I purchased this to go along with my De89. I started with the bics and was impressed. I like the 7Oclocks as well. The Blue Birds and the Feathers I have been advised to wait and compair after a few weeks with the Bics and Gillettes. Like most im expecting a lot from the feathers but was somwhat surprised at the sharpness and smooth finish of the Bics and Gillettes. Especially compared to the Derby that came with the razor. The Derby&#x27;s are just too dull for my face wasnt getting a close shave and will probably toss the rest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Each face is different and so far I have preferred the Gillette. Will review in another month after I try the Feathers and Blue Birds but those seem to be widely regarded as great</li>
    <li> I have only tried the bic and gillette so far.  Both are good blades with a nice edge.  The bic seem better than the blades that came with my Merkur razor.  I would definitely consider buying them separately as they seem to work well on my face.  The gillettes are more so so.  Worth the price if your looking for some variety.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t tried the razor blades yet but I wanted to try out a sampler to see what would be best for my face and this is exactly what I wanted.  Shipped quickly.</li>
    <li> Great multi-pack to help you decide what type of blade works best for your face/skin type.  I liked the 7 O&#x27;clock&#x27;s best and have been using them ever since.</li>
    <li> After a few years of using the same blades (Derby), I got the itch to try a few brands that I hadn&#x27;t before, and this package fills the bill. Shipping was quick, and packaging was good.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve notice the different blades have a different &#x27;feel&#x27; and this is a good sample pack to decide which ones I like. I haven&#x27;t finished them all but I am leaning towards the feather and bluebird as my favorites.</li>
    <li> Everything got sent quickly. I&#x27;m personally not a fan of the blue bird, and would rank it as follows:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Feather, Bic, Gillette, Blue Bird.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Really great package though, good to figure out what works best for you.</li>
    <li> This was a great opportunity to try some blades I haven&#x27;t tried before to find the perfect shave for me. Good quality blades.</li>
    <li> I purchased this with the intent of finding &amp;#34;my&amp;#34; preferred blade and I have to say the Bic and Feather brands perform the best for my face.  A decent buy if you&#x27;re looking to experiment with different brands.</li>
    <li> I think any of these sampler packs are a great way to try out different blades. I prefer packs like these that include five blades per brand so that I can give each one a real run for its money. I&#x27;m not going to comment on how each blade has worked for me because my face is not your face. I will say that I was surprised how short some brands last on my punim compared to others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I try each of these blades in both a fancy-pants [[ASIN:B002RBF1PO Edwin Jagger]] razor and one of those super cheap [[ASIN:B0050HO9MI Chinese specials]] that you can find here on Amazon*, and one thing I have noticed is that if the blade is going to feel lousy on my face it will feel lousy no matter which razor I use. The same goes for if the blade feels great. And if I&#x27;m not going to like a particular razor-and-blade combination, I usually know it within the first shave or two.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Each razor gets its own blade. I don&#x27;t switch one blade between razors. Each razor gets an entire run with a blade before I move onto the other razor (usually a week in my case).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I&#x27;d really like to see with these blade samplers is the ability to pick the individual brands in a four, five, or six brand sampler from a larger selection of available brands. That way one could try different blades without having to buy some that have already been tried and dismissed.</li>
    <li> Love the ability to try different razors all in one pack, feather seems to be sharpest, and my favorite, followed by the bic.</li>
    <li> I used each of these blades and like most folks have said the Feather are the sharpest and the best in my opinion. Blue Bird is next, they are not too bad a blade either. 7 O&#x27;clock and Derby are terrible with Derby being the worst. Next time I need blades I will be ordering Feathers.</li>
    <li> New to the D.E. thing. This helped me learn I am a Feather guy. Just like the sharpness so I ordered 100 more.</li>
    <li> That ws to sample a number of makers products quickly. I just returned to double edge razors and with the change in distribution that drove me away the first time still in place I found that I had to develop new brands. Very little in the way of these razors are sold in the us OTC any more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found the gillettes to be about as bad a a razor can get...the blue birds were not much better. The bids were nearly as good as the merkur which reminded me of the old wilkinson sword brand. But the feathers were the best. These are the closest to a barber shave I ever had. And contrary to belief I did not nick my self once on the sharper blades in the past six months..only on the Gillette. These btw are nothing like the gillettes of old.</li>
    <li> Let me start by saying I agree with all those that recommend trying a variety of blades to determine what works best for your skin/beard type and razor. I purchased this variety pack and also the Wilkinson Sword and Astra Superior Platinum  DE Blades. As background I have been shaving for more than 30 years (my first razor was the Gillette Atra) and I have been using a Feather Double Edge Safety Razor for about 2 months.&lt;br /&gt;For me, the Wilkinson Sword blades were the best over-all in terms of shaving comfort, closeness of shave and length of time it stays sharp. I need to shave every day and these blades last about 1 week. Although many people prefer the Feather Brand, I found these blades a bit too aggressive for me, leaving razor burns and more nicks. The  7 o’clock blades I found to  also be a good shave but did not last as long. In my experience, the BIC blades were the worst, both in terms of comfort, sharpness  and lasting.&lt;br /&gt;For those that haven’t tried wet shaving, I highly recommend it. Shaving used to be a chore, but as another reviewer said, shaving now almost seems to be a hobby.  Maybe it is just the newness of wet shaving and it may wear off, but for now, I like it.&lt;br /&gt;Of course, I was fed up paying exorbitant amounts of money for the multi razor blades, but now I spend my money trying different shaving accessories.  Maybe it is a mid-life crisis but since I cannot afford the Corvette, I spend a few dollars on accessories...&lt;br /&gt; My first brush was boars hair but I heard so much about the badger hair I had to try it. I must say, it is softer and lathers the soap better, and I only lost a few bristles. OK, so I only spent $12 on the brush, but it is worth it.&lt;br /&gt;As far as shave soap, I am using Vander Hagen soap which came in their Premium Shave set along with the boars hair brush and shaving cup. Works well enough (makes ok lather and I shave with it) but it is almost gone after 2 months.  I have tried the Arko shaving sticks, but they don’t work well for me and I have just order the Proraso soap. Let’s see if there is any difference.&lt;br /&gt;And lastly, since I, too, am nostalgic for the “Good Old Days”, I purchased the Club Pinaud After Shave. It kinda does smell like the barber shop when I was young and that makes me feel young … at least in my head! And it works.</li>
    <li> Good little sample. You get 5 each from various blade brands. I am not talking as an expert on blades (like some other reviewers), only as a novice to the DE razor game, but the variety is big enough that you can sample which brands are best for you.</li>
    <li> Got my brother a safety razor after I became a convert. Its the perfect starter pack to learn which blade is best for your skin and facial hair.</li>
    <li> the blades that come in this sampler are all of higher end blades. Feather is wicked sharp and Bluebird is extra smooth ( for me ).</li>
    <li> I got this sample pack to try out various brands before buying any one brand in bulk. I didn&#x27;t expect there to be so much difference but there certainly is. I&#x27;ve got two of these brands on my never again list and I&#x27;m now fine tuning my decision between the other two. I think it&#x27;s a matter of finding the right beard for my blade so I&#x27;m sure my never again blades would work great for others.</li>
    <li> every face is differnt. I reccomend trying a mix of blades. I&#x27;m finding blades here I like and don&#x27;t like.</li>
    <li> They blades came very fast and just as described!  I will not need to buy another blade for my razor for a long time!</li>
    <li> Good sampler pack. Pretty much confirms what most say - just go ahead and order Feathers; they are definitely the best. For me, the Bic blades weren&#x27;t bad either though - edge seemed pretty durable. Blue birds were pretty marginal and the gilletes not much better. Of course, everyone&#x27;s face and razor are different.</li>
    <li> Now that I&#x27;ve tried all the blades, I can say this is a really good set. The Feather brand are Japanese steel, and act like it. Super sharp, but wear out quickly. Don&#x27;t try and use them too long or you&#x27;ll get a lot of nicks. The Gillette aren&#x27;t as sharp, but work well and last longer. The Derby are my favorite and seem to last the longest. The others are pretty average and work just fine for about 10-15 shaves. Will probably purchase again when I use up all of this order.</li>
    <li> Good package and great price.  Received shipment quickly.  Blades all came in individual sealed packs.  Hope to make a decision soon on which blade works best for me.</li>
    <li> Personally, the BIC&#x27;s work for me, but this is a great starter pack for anyone getting into traditional double edge shaving.  Good price and quick shipping, too!</li>
    <li> I bought these to go with my safety razor.  I was new to this type of razor, and thought the multi-pack would be a good way to choose which blades I preferred.</li>
    <li> good selection. top blades</li>
    <li> A variety pack of razor blades is always recommended to anyone who is just getting started with using a safety razor. A blade that works wonderfully for one person may give a terrible shave to another. It is essential that you try each blade for yourself to see how they work for your face (or whatever else you need to shave).</li>
    <li> So far this has turned out to be a great same pack. I&#x27;m slowly going through each brand and trying to pick my favorite.</li>
    <li> When I started shaving with a DE razor, I did not know what blades would work best for me. The merkur blade that came with my razor tore my skin up like crazy. I ordered this sample pack and tried each blade, multiple times. This pack helped me realize that the Gillete 7O&#x27;Clock blades were the best for me.</li>
    <li> The bics are great.  Seriously one of the sharpest alternatives to Feather.  This is now one of my faves.  These, Gillette yellow, and Astra SP are my go-to blades.</li>
    <li> As always with blades it comes down to personal preference and the type of facial hair/skin you have. I bought this to try out as a new DE shaver using the long handled Merkur razor. I only liked two of the blades out of the boxes included in this sampler. unfortunately they were the last ones I had tried as it seemed that most people recommend not trying the Feathers as a new DE shaver. I found the bluebirds usable and the feathers to be amazing they never cut my skin unlike any of the other blades and they also leave almost zero irritation and give a closer shave. I have a lot of hair on my neck that grows in random directions and the other blades did not seem to deal with this well(this may be my fault because I&#x27;m having trouble figuring out how to shave with the grain when it goes 4 different directions). So if your in a similar situation give the Feathers a try and remember to go slow and use basically zero pressure.</li>
    <li> Nice sample kit to figure which blades you like and works best for your skin and shaving style or preferences. I have found that some blades are sharper and last long ( 6-10 shaves) and others are not as sharp but, provide an excellent shave nonetheless and last maybe 3-4 shaves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this sample kit based on value, price and as tool to decide which blades to use on an ongoing basis.</li>
    <li> Good sampler of blades if you want to be exposed to new brands. I didn&#x27;t care for the BIC or Gillete ones myself, but that is the whole point of buying a sampler pack. To discover which brands work well for your face.</li>
    <li> This may be only four packs but it is a fairly diverse range of quality blades. I would recommend this first over some of the larger samplers. First of all, it does not have Derby Extras in it which is a major plus. Derby&#x27;s are so common that my actual razor came with a box of them. The 7 O&#x27;Clocks I got were the RUSSIAN factory versions, which are fantastic but I&#x27;m not sure if they are even being made now. These are stacked in the picture in order of sharpness, the BlueBirds being somewhat mild and the 7&#x27;s being a notch below Feathers.</li>
    <li> Nice way to get into safety razor shaving</li>
