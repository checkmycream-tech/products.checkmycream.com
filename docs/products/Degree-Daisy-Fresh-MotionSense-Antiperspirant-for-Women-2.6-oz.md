      <li>Worth the money.</li>
      <li>There is residue on skin and clothing if you&#x27;re not careful, and like many long-wear formulas, this doesn&#x27;t wash off with a quick rinse of soap and water.</li>
      <li>Smell is good, but doesn&#x27;t seem to work as well as other deodorants I have tried.  </li>
      <li>It was delivered right away.</li>

      <li>This is my new go to over Dove.</li>
      <li>It feels sticky, doesn&#x27;t seem to last long, and the scent is extremely strong.  </li>
      <li>Have used this product this entire hot, sticky summer with no odor or wetness.</li>
      <li>I have sensitive skin and this doesn&#x27;t cause any type of irritation whatsoever.</li>
      <li>It does leave some white powdered residue on your armpits, but it is not noticeable unless you&#x27;re really close.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this product especially if you are in such a sensitive situation like me!</li>
      <li>Much sooner than the expected delivery amazon gave me.</li>

    <li> Smells great. Great product</li>
    <li> Smells great, goes on smooth, works strong!</li>
    <li> Great scent for me. All I use.</li>
    <li> Not loving the scent.</li>
    <li> Although this isn&#x27;t my favorite scent, I love Degree MotionSense. It keeps me smelling good all day since it&#x27;s only activated when moving. This scent isn&#x27;t as strong as another I&#x27;ve tried (forgot which one), but it does smell fresh. It&#x27;s very light though. The deodorant goes on very easily and doesn&#x27;t leave any film on my skin. I haven&#x27;t noticed any stickiness either (as someone else stated). I have sensitive skin and this doesn&#x27;t cause any type of irritation whatsoever. I will definitely purchase more.</li>
    <li> Great product,  woorks very well. Worth the money. Shipping was fast and packaged well.</li>
    <li> Keeps you dry. Smells great!</li>
    <li> What can I say?  It works, it cost is reasonable and it is shipped free.</li>
    <li> I have been using Dove gel deodorant and Dove Cucumber scent, but this is the best deodorant I have used so far. I tend to sweat a lot, and this antiperspirant does the trick. It smells good too. It does leave some white powdered residue on your armpits, but it is not noticeable unless you&#x27;re really close.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not a big sweater at all and this deodorant couldn&#x27;t even keep up with the little bit that I do sweat</li>
    <li> I have purchased Degre before but this did not seem to be of the same quality. I can&#x27;t express what it is but it feels a bit gooey.</li>
    <li> Smell is good, but doesn&#x27;t seem to work as well as other deodorants I have tried.  I&#x27;ll be switching back to Secret.</li>
    <li> Peach smells amazing! My favorite brand antiperspirant.</li>
    <li> Definitely not life changing for me. Works very well, the Daisy scent is nice and light. This is my new go to over Dove.</li>
    <li> Works / protects well, I would definitely buy again. That said, none of these &amp;#34;invisible&amp;#34; products are ever invisible .. There is residue on skin and clothing if you&#x27;re not careful, and like many long-wear formulas, this doesn&#x27;t wash off with a quick rinse of soap and water. It&#x27;s best to loofah-soap this product off.</li>

    <li> Works well, but I did not get a cap. It came with the safety cap that comes with all new anti-perspirant but did not have the cap that you replace each day after use.</li>

    <li> One of my favorites. It works well and smells great.</li>
    <li> Chose 5 stars since package arrived on time and no damage to package.</li>
    <li> LOVE IT. LOVE THE SCENT</li>
    <li> Love this scent and cannot find it in stores where I live. Works great! Timely delivery too.</li>
