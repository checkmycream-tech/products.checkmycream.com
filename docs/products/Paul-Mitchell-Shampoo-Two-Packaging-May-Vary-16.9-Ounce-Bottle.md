      <li>Paul Mitchell makes the best shampoos out there.  </li>
      <li>It does the trick, smells great, and gives manageable results.  </li>
      <li>I was happy with reviews and bought 2.</li>
      <li>Does a great job, leaves hair great looking.</li>
      <li>And my bottle costs $7 which is great since each bottle lasts for me about 4-8 months.</li>
      <li>It does smell good.  </li>
      <li>Nice to have essentials like shampoo delivered to your home.</li>
      <li>A very good product and a reasonable price.</li>
      <li>-- it smells great (kind of like a lemon tree or sweet lemonade) and makes my hair shiny and smooth.  </li>
      <li>This shampoo was shipped very fast with great communication from the company.</li>
      <li>We love this shampoo.  </li>
      <li>We love the lemon smell, and everything about this shampoo.</li>
      <li>I have oily hair in the morning and most of the time my scalp itches.</li>
      <li>My hair is shiny and soft, healthy and looks and feels amazing.</li>
      <li>This is perfect for squeaky-clean hair, as it removes all excess oils and what few conditioning products I do use.</li>
      <li>This product smells GREAT, like a sweet lemony smell that is unisex and actually lasts.</li>
      <li>Gets my hair squeaky clean</li>
      <li>It has a great very mild aroma and leaves my hair much more manageable than the last shampoo I was using a definite A+++</li>
      <li>I could not use this frequently without alternating with a gentler shampoo and must use some light conditioner on the ends of my hair when I do use it, but I can feel safe that this will not cause build-up and will remove build-up from my hair.</li>
      <li>I was so happy when I found it on amazon for cheaper than other Paul Mitchel shampoos sell for in stores!</li>
      <li>The fresh lemon scent stays all day and the price is the lowest that I have found.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;d just advise to not use this as a regular daily/weekly shampoo as it&#x27;s made for kind to CLARIFY.</li>
      <li>Shampoo 2 can definitely be used every day without any kind of buildups or dulling of shine.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not one to spend much money on beauty products, but I will happily pay the money for this shampoo as long as I live.</li>
      <li>Then I asked my mom to send me something that would help, knowing she would know exactly what would help, and she sent me paul Mitchell shampoo two.</li>
      <li>I really can&#x27;t  use anything else and don&#x27;t know what I&#x27;d do if Paul Mitchell ever stops making it!</li>
      <li>Thanks Paul Mitchell!</li>
      <li>So I searched on Amazon and this product came out first on&lt;br /&gt;the list.</li>
      <li>After the first time I used it, I immediately felt the difference</li>
      <li>and I love the deep cleansing capabilities of this shampoo.</li>
      <li>I have bushy bi-racial natural hair and use this once a month to give my hair a clean slate.</li>
      <li>The Shampoo two does ok, but it really dries the back of my head out!  </li>
      <li>no matter how gunk I have in them without using too much shampoo.</li>
      <li>really work well for my oily hair.</li>
      <li>It definitely leaves your hair squeaky clean.</li>
      <li>It feels fine right after shower, but gets greasy again&lt;br /&gt;in half a day.</li>
      <li>After the first use she had soft shiny hair.  </li>
      <li>Now we can&#x27;t live without it!</li>
      <li>I cannot recommend this for normal to dry hair or scalp more often than once a week, and there are perhaps other clarifying shampoos that are gentler than this one for those hair and scalp types.</li>
      <li>Makes my hair feel shiny and soft and manageable.</li>
      <li>A few weeks later, and I can safely say I&#x27;ll never use another shampoo again.</li>
      <li>I am wondering how the product gets such high reviews.</li>
      <li>I have long, straight strawberry-blond hair that gets oily if I don&#x27;t shampoo every morning.  </li>
      <li>have normal hair with an oily scalp, and in need of regular use of a clarifying shampoo.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not perfect, but it&#x27;s the best I&#x27;ve found for use with hard water.</li>
      <li>I have very long, very straight, very flat, unstyled and uncolored</li>
      <li>One lather gets rid of a few weeks worth of build up and grime but doesn&#x27;t leave my hair stripped at all.</li>
      <li>I live in a really hard water area and this is the only shampoo that not only gets  my hair clean but</li>

    <li> I have bushy bi-racial natural hair and use this once a month to give my hair a clean slate. This product smells GREAT, like a sweet lemony smell that is unisex and actually lasts. One lather gets rid of a few weeks worth of build up and grime but doesn&#x27;t leave my hair stripped at all. My hair feels bouncy and shiny before even following my shampoo with a conditioner. And my bottle costs $7 which is great since each bottle lasts for me about 4-8 months. I&#x27;d just advise to not use this as a regular daily/weekly shampoo as it&#x27;s made for kind to CLARIFY.</li>
    <li> I have oily hair. It feels fine right after shower, but gets greasy again&lt;br /&gt;in half a day. I got annoyed and decided to find some shampoo specialized&lt;br /&gt;for greasy hair. So I searched on Amazon and this product came out first on&lt;br /&gt;the list. I was happy with reviews and bought 2. But I am totally disappointed&lt;br /&gt;by the product. It smells pretty bad, which is fine. The problem is that it&lt;br /&gt;doesnt really work well for my oily hair. I feel no difference from whatever&lt;br /&gt;I used before. I am wondering how the product gets such high reviews. Maybe&lt;br /&gt;I just have very different hair.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for close to 3 years and I love the deep cleansing capabilities of this shampoo. Gets my hair squeaky clean no matter how gunk I have in them without using too much shampoo. Plus I like the subtle lime-lemon scent. The only unfortunate thing is that it is a little hard to get in stores and online for a reasonable price and amazon frequently goes out of stock. I recommend that you stockpile.</li>
    <li> I live in a really hard water area and this is the only shampoo that not only gets  my hair clean but \\&quot;lifts\\&quot; off my hair and rinses away with the dirt.  I really can&#x27;t  use anything else and don&#x27;t know what I&#x27;d do if Paul Mitchell ever stops making it!</li>
    <li> Paul Mitchell makes the best shampoos out there.  I have used Shampoo 2 for years and have never had any issues with it -- it smells great (kind of like a lemon tree or sweet lemonade) and makes my hair shiny and smooth.  I have long, straight strawberry-blond hair that gets oily if I don&#x27;t shampoo every morning.  Shampoo 2 can definitely be used every day without any kind of buildups or dulling of shine.  I recommend any of Paul Mitchell&#x27;s products!!</li>
    <li> It definitely leaves your hair squeaky clean. I only use it on my scalp since I have oily hair. It is lemon scented but it is not overpowering or unpleasant.</li>
    <li> One of the best shampoos I have used. Makes my hair feel shiny and soft and manageable.</li>
    <li> This shampoo was shipped very fast with great communication from the company. It has a great very mild aroma and leaves my hair much more manageable than the last shampoo I was using a definite A+++</li>
    <li> A very good product and a reasonable price. Nice to have essentials like shampoo delivered to your home.</li>
    <li> We love this shampoo.  It does the trick, smells great, and gives manageable results.  No more oily looking hair.  My daughter uses it on a daily basis for a while now.  Will buy again.  Thank you for carrying it, Amazon!</li>
    <li> I have oily hair in the morning and most of the time my scalp itches. I was hoping this would get rid of the oily hair or the itch, but I still get it every morning, and when I use this shampoo, it stops the itch a little, but it does not completely get rid of it :-(</li>
    <li> Growing up, my Mom (a hairdresser) always bought paul mitchell hair products and I never really noticed the difference between using them and other brands. Then I got married and moved to Germany, and my hair became very oily and disgusting. I tried several different things but nothing helped. Then I asked my mom to send me something that would help, knowing she would know exactly what would help, and she sent me paul Mitchell shampoo two. After the first time I used it, I immediately felt the difference and since then I only use shampoo two. My hair is shiny and soft, healthy and looks and feels amazing. Even my husband uses it. We love the lemon smell, and everything about this shampoo. Now we can&#x27;t live without it!</li>
    <li> I tried this shampoo because my hair is oily in the front, but not int the back.  I was looking for something to replace the shampoo that had worked well for quite a while; in other words, I could wash in the a.m. and my bangs still did not look oily and nappy by the end of the day.  The Shampoo two does ok, but it really dries the back of my head out!  I&#x27;m still using it though, so what can I say?  It does smell good.  I would definitely recommend this shampoo to someone with oily hair.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my teenage daughter.  We have tried everything for her oily hair and I find this is the only product that has worked on her hair.  With other shampoos she still has to use baby powder to soak up the oil after shampooing and blow drying.  After the first use she had soft shiny hair.  Thanks Paul Mitchell!</li>
    <li> No exaggeration, this is life-changing. I have incredibly thick hair that gets oily within hours of showering and looks terrible. I&#x27;ve been struggling to find a shampoo to help with this and nothing has worked. I used this shampoo once and could already tell a difference. A few weeks later, and I can safely say I&#x27;ll never use another shampoo again. I&#x27;m not one to spend much money on beauty products, but I will happily pay the money for this shampoo as long as I live.</li>
    <li> I ordered this shampoo for my boyfriend who has issues with oily hair unless using this shampoo daily. We looked at Target, Walmart, Walgreens, Rite Aid, Kroger, and Publix none of which carried Shampoo Two. I was so happy when I found it on amazon for cheaper than other Paul Mitchel shampoos sell for in stores!</li>
    <li> I have very long, very straight, very flat, unstyled and uncolored hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have normal hair with an oily scalp, and in need of regular use of a clarifying shampoo. This is perfect for squeaky-clean hair, as it removes all excess oils and what few conditioning products I do use. I could not use this frequently without alternating with a gentler shampoo and must use some light conditioner on the ends of my hair when I do use it, but I can feel safe that this will not cause build-up and will remove build-up from my hair. I cannot recommend this for normal to dry hair or scalp more often than once a week, and there are perhaps other clarifying shampoos that are gentler than this one for those hair and scalp types.</li>
    <li> Does a great job, leaves hair great looking. We use it after swimming in the pool to take out the chlorine.</li>
    <li> Our water is hard as a rock. I could NOT get the darned shampoo out of my hair until I bought this one. It&#x27;s not perfect, but it&#x27;s the best I&#x27;ve found for use with hard water. And they don&#x27;t test on animals.</li>
    <li> Removes all product residue without treating your hair harshly.  The fresh lemon scent stays all day and the price is the lowest that I have found.</li>
