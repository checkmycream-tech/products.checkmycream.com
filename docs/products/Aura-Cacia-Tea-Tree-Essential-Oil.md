<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Received it on time and is great!</li>
    <li> This is a repurchase.  I used up one.  It&#x27;s pretty effective in clearing up blemishes and can use by itself.  No need to dilute.  I use this one before any chemical solutions.</li>
    <li> I used this when I had a toothache, and while the taste is not something I relish, it did the job of cutting the swelling and pain better than anything else I was using.  It is good for bug bites and blemishes as well.  Aura Cacia is a reputable company that I trust.</li>
    <li> Aura Cacia is my go-to brand... affordable, but good quality. We use this for acne breakouts, and it works wonderfully! Good strong smell, not fake or &amp;#34;watered down.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> Excellent product.  I&#x27;ve been using Aura Casia oils for many years and am always satisfied.  Thank you</li>
    <li> Great scent! Satisfied</li>
    <li> Good tea tree oil....</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used another brand but ran out so I bought this. Good for scars, makes them fades fast. I also like to put it in my hair.</li>
    <li> First of all, I am not a fan of tea tree oil smell, but it is so useful and this brand is one of the only ones I like and will buy just on brand alone. Great for itching bug bites, and other homeopathic things.</li>
    <li> Very well packaged, natural, potent and worth every cent.  Highly recommend these for those into alternative medicines/healing/wellness.  Aura Cacia makes a great product.  Their quality control is a standard I feel comfortable with.</li>
    <li> After a lot of researching I settled on this product to make my own oil cleanser. This is great, has a nice soothing aroma, and a few drops go a long way.I can see this lasting me a long time, since you just need a little bit.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite oil!&lt;br /&gt;it smells great and makes for great toothpaste when added to coconut oil and baking soda!&lt;br /&gt;controls the bacteria level in mouth</li>
    <li> I ordered this product but received lavender instead. Packaging stated it was tea tree oil but that was not what was inside. I contacted the seller as well as amazon and no response. I&#x27;m sure the product would be fine but instead I wasted money. Very disappointed that the service and lack of attention to detail is so poor. Waste of money</li>
    <li> I have used other products from Aura Cacia and they are all outstanding products as is this Tea Tree oil !</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t guarantee it is working on my zits, but I go to bed smelling good haha</li>
    <li> Very awkward plastic dispenser at the top of bottle. Smell is an overwhelming turpentine scent. It has a strong drying effect on the skin. I will use it to chase insects away since the odor is devastating and has staying power. I will not order again.</li>
    <li> I was concerned when this package arrived because the weather was freezing and so was the bottle of this oil. I am a regular user of tea tree oil and familiar with this brand. I normally buy it at my health food market but the price was better here. Well....maybe I wont do that again because I feel as if the extremely cold temps during shipping may have compromised the oil. Not sure if the seller could have helped this, prob not, but nonetheless I have an oil that smells a little different than other bottles of the same brand I purchased elsewhere and I can&#x27;t accurately contribute it to anything else.</li>
    <li> Where do I start!  I use this oil for everything.  I use it for acne, in shampoo for an itchy scalp, bug bites, and rashes it works!  I will make sure I keep some at all times.  I was not too happy with the packaging from Amazon.  When it arrived oil was all over the bottle.  I think I will continue to purchase it from a nearby store.</li>
    <li> This really works and I see the difference  in my skin it is much healthier.</li>
    <li> I got this to add to my children&#x27;s shampoo to repel lice when their school had a huge lice breakout. It seems to be working nicely. The smell is nice. And a little really goes a long way so it should last us a very long time.</li>
    <li> Love this.  I put this oil in with my hair conditioner and it helps with scalp issues.  I also apply it directly to acne and it works great.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I wanted. Smells lovely and clean. I add it to my homemade cleaners (dish &amp;#34;soap&amp;#34;, all purpose cleaner) as well as homemade beauty products. I also have the Juniper oil and love that as well. Great products. Thanks!</li>
    <li> I love this stuff.  I use it all the time.  So except no substitute.  Pure essential oil &amp; none of that watered down stuff.</li>
    <li> This doesn&#x27;t smell very good for me, but it do have a cooling effect when used for face.</li>
    <li> Nice aroma and works great on my feet</li>
    <li> Excellent product, is less expensive to buy it here on Amazon!!!!  With this brand you cannot go wrong, the oils are authentic...</li>
    <li> Good quality oil at reasonable price, I&#x27;ve been using these for years</li>
    <li> received timely and intact</li>
    <li> This oil doesn&#x27;t come with a dropper so it&#x27;s not easy to measure. It seems very pure though, and does the job.</li>
    <li> This is great at preventing mold and mildew in my cloth wipe solution.  Used along side the lavender Aura Cacia essential oil it freshens and cleanses!  Love it!</li>
    <li> I would recommend this tea tree oil.  I use it often and I&#x27;m pleased with its value. I usually mix it with olive oil to apply to the skin.</li>
    <li> In my experience, any product from Aura Cacia can be relied upon. Good quality, accessible essential oils are a gift and absolutely necessary for daily life in my house. Tea tree oil in particular is multifaceted in its benefits for home and body health.</li>
    <li> I use this with a rubber gum stimulater every day for about 20 years now and it has gotten rid of the bleeding gums I used to have in my 20&#x27;s and 30&#x27;s.</li>
    <li> Almost done with the bottle. Tea Tree oil is really helping me control my breakouts. Pimples disappear in 2-3 days of applying and cystic acne takes about 3-5 days to settle down and &amp;#34;deflate&amp;#34; for me. I use this everyday and I am kind of scared that my skin might get used to it and stop working. Anyways, I just want to add that UPS is horrible, I use to like them but recently the packages I&#x27;ve been getting from them are tattered and dirty, this one&#x27;s package particularly came beat up, smashed up, and re taped with clear tape.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I was looking for. Looking forward to using this oil for a lot of home remedies and learing more about all of it&#x27;s great uses.</li>
    <li> We bought this for a pet mouse with mites.  Worked great.  We also use it for acne.  A dab twice a day shrinks the zit and I love how it smells.  Great value.</li>
    <li> This bottle did not come in the product box and leaked into the bubble wrap. It is pretty sticky so don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll order any more. The other 2 bottles came in the product box &amp; didn&#x27;t have any damage.</li>
    <li> Was sent an item I did not order, very disappointed usually I get what I order but recently no luck. I ordered tee tree oil was sent eucalyptus.....ugh</li>
    <li> I use this in my hair and body butters and a little goes a long way.  The packaging is great and doesn&#x27;t leak like some bottles can</li>
    <li> Ive started to take my beauty routine to a more natural state with fewer harsh chemicals. I have acne-prone skin and started a night routine of a little Vit E oil with a drop or two of this Tea Tree oil mixed together on a cotton ball. So far, my skin is looking better and is less irritated.</li>
    <li> We love these oils from this brand Aura Cacia. This is a very strong oil yet enjoyable.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for years.  I love the convenience, and the price of ordering this product through amazon!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always used tea tree oil for bug bites, or anything that is itchy, because it helps dry out the skin as soon you put it on and lessens the desire to scratch all day.  I purchased this bottle and found two new uses of this amazing oil! Tea tree oil is also great for tension headaches (apply to your temples) and for curing Athlete&#x27;s Foot!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The uses are endless and this specific bottle is a very high concentration of tea tree oil for a great price!</li>
    <li> Aura Cacia is one of my favorite go to brands for essential oils, because I know I can trust their quality.  One of the most well known and respected essential oils is tea tree, due to its antibacterial, antifungal and antiviral uses.  It can be diluted with oil for treatment of scrapes, or vaporized for a refreshing treatment.  My top use for this oil is for earaches.  I take several drops of tea tree oil diluted with about a tablespoon of organic castor oil, then pour into the affected ear.  Let sit for at least thirty minutes and then put a cottonball in the ear.  We use every time an earache is suspected, and it kills the bacteria in the middle ear without irritation.  It can also be diluted with water and sprayed on itchy skin, and bug bites.</li>
    <li> Has a very strong scent but not unbearable. More cleansing</li>
    <li> I love using this to steam my face or directly on a cotton pad diluted by a bit of water to treat my acne.</li>
    <li> great tea tree oil. i use it with my facial moisturizing serum and it smells amazing and helps clear up my skin. will definitely be refilling once i run out!</li>
    <li> I was going to buy tea tree oil at the store but it was wayy too expensive for a similar size. I use it for my hair, face, body, everything. It even helped heal a cut I had!</li>
    <li> Bought because I had ripped skin off from glue that landed on my thumb from a glue gun and burnt it ....This cleared up my thumb better than any antibiotic ointment would have.</li>
    <li> This oil is wonderful for my face. I recommend​ it.</li>
    <li> The bottle was leaking when I got this, and it was half empty :(</li>
    <li> I have come to trust this brand over the years. It seems to have a consistent potency, and be one of the more effective tea tree oils out there.&lt;br /&gt;Over the years, it has been used on cuts, scrapes, scratches, and even burns and bruises! My teenager finds it effective for clearing up acne too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is always in my medicine kit!</li>
    <li> Aura Cacia has an extensive essential oil product line, which is great, considering that many oils lay claim to performing certain therapeutic functions. Yes, one can put a certain oil into a diffuser for optimal aromatherapy for what ails you. However, it seems like any of these oils will provide a general sense of well-being, so being selective isn&#x27;t high priority for those who don&#x27;t have specific needs. To me, Tea Tree isn&#x27;t any different than Lavender; both seem to calm and soothe, as well as cleanse. I understand that certain oils carry a stronger aroma than others, so this may be a factor to those who are sensitive. I recommend this brand of essential oils for people who just want to feel a general sense of well-being.</li>
    <li> gift... arrived just fine</li>
    <li> I recently had a bad reaction to some Vitamin C serum someone sent me. It had oil in it which may have blocked my pores. Anyway I started breaking out and it wouldn&#x27;t stop. I stopped using the serum but my skin was not clearing up. So I read a book on essential oils and decided to try this oil again. I&#x27;d used it before but had forgotten about it. Anyway within days of using it my skin started to all clear up. I put a few drops in my regular face cream and also used it along with a toner on a cotton pad. Then I started applying it straight to the skin where needed. In a few days my skin will be all cleared up. Whew! Tea Tree oil to the rescue. If you&#x27;ve never used this before realize that it is very strong. You should test some out on your inner arm before applying it on your face. So far I&#x27;ve had no bad reactions and have only had good things happen. I&#x27;m so glad I had a bottle of this when I needed it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;~The Rebecca Review&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S. Don&#x27;t use this for oral health in any way. Keep away from mouth! It is toxic if ingested.</li>
    <li> I like the design of the bottle.it won&#x27;t be leaky.  the smell is fine. I made a spray(water+20% alcohol+a few drops of tea tree oil),it is kind of antiphlogistic. very useful on itchy skin !</li>
    <li> we love the tea tree oil. it has been great for our skin and detox bath</li>
    <li> love this stuff, smells great, too</li>
    <li> Used it for acne and it works.  Used another brand with better reviews and ended up returning since it did not work on acne and smelled different.</li>
    <li> It smelled a little funny, but seemed to work well enough.  I would buy the organic version instead.</li>
    <li> I use this and mix it with Aura Cacia Jojoba oil as a conditioner for my hair.  Apply to scalp and leave on for about 30 min and rinse. My hair smells so refreshing and my scalp is nourished and never dry!</li>
    <li> I used this to heal an infection on my nose piercing. Could tell the difference after just a day! Does not smell great, but it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
    <li> Great oil quality - pure product. Thank you!</li>
    <li> Awesome stuff.  Use it our shampoo and my daughters use it on their faces for pimples.</li>
    <li> I use tea tree oil for nearly every health issue, from teeth cleaning to bug bites, cuts, and skin rash. It even protects my plants from insects when sprayed as a mist. I trust the Aura Cacia brand and have several of their oils as they are reasonably priced and easily available. It seems like each day I can find another use for tea tree oil.  Used it yesterday before shampooing to treat scalp that was itchy from allergies this time of year and also massaged into my feet before and after a day tromping around at the state fair in order to reduce odor, swelling, and aching.  Search it out.  You will like this product.</li>
    <li> I bought this to clear up some acne, but so far I have not noticed any difference. I have been using it for about two weeks and nothing has changed. Acne is still as bad, or worse, than it was before.</li>
    <li> Great product! I added it to homemade deodorant</li>
    <li> I love this product it really works to sooth the scalp.  I would recommend it and the brand to others.  the price was great as well.</li>
