      <li>This is a lighter oil product than most oils.</li>
      <li>and it got rid of most of the flyaways AND made my ends look healthy.</li>
      <li>If you would love to look like you haven&#x27;t washed your hair in days, this is it!!&lt;br /&gt;Even</li>

      <li>This Awapuhi Ginger Dry Oil is a great product!  </li>
      <li>Definitely worth the wait to be delivered! :)</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s so light</li>
      <li>It soaks in fast, smells amazing, and it tames frizz like nobody&#x27;s business.</li>
      <li>I have only used a couple times but it is a comparable product at lower the cost with great results.</li>
      <li>looking good (i have natural wavy hair)</li>
      <li>so I use a little more than a pea size drop.. more like a penny sized drop :P</li>
      <li>Originally, I purchased this product just for my extensions</li>
      <li>but I am pretty sure that it is quality when used correctly.</li>
      <li>honestly i have the thickest most coarse hair i have ever seen.</li>
      <li>very light and doesn&#x27;t leave my hands feeling really greasy.</li>
      <li>Very nice dry oil.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve now gone through the whole bottle and need to get more ASAP.</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t live without this product! :)</li>
      <li>This vendor ships quickly &amp;</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve even waited on a shower for a few days and my hair is still smooth and smells great.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t weigh it down and smells great.</li>
      <li>this thing is great it does not weight my hair down.</li>
      <li>/&gt;By the way this costs about the same on amazon as it does in the store so your choice which is more convenient!</li>
      <li>I love awapuhi in general</li>
      <li>so barely any gets the top of my head</li>
      <li>I have tried so many products for my hair (mostly expensive) and this one is by far the BEST!</li>
      <li>Just need a little, warm it between hands before lightly applying.  </li>
      <li>My extensions and leave out were unbelievably soft and frizz free.</li>
      <li>It has a very light fruity sent that still somehow manages to overpower the burnt hair smell that often comes with flat ironing.</li>
      <li>but I mean 3.3 oz makes it great for traveling</li>
      <li>(I don&#x27;t represent any of these 3 products, I simply want to share that I&#x27;ve finally found a combo that makes a healthy difference in my hair!)</li>
      <li>I love awapuhi dry styling oil!</li>
      <li>Mind you, my hair is type 3c, and very kinky coily.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend giving it a try and you can&#x27;t beat the price!</li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t leave an oily residue in hair but definitely makes it soft and healthy feeling.</li>
      <li>Now my hair feels and looks better than it has in a long while!!!!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s light, easy to apply, smells clean, and doesn&#x27;t leave hair stiff like other products can</li>
      <li>when I had a perm, I would put in organix Macademia Nut conditioner, and rub this oil lightly through my hair, and air dry.</li>
      <li>Like any other oil just go really easy on it.</li>
      <li>And my ends have stayed looking healthy even though I didn&#x27;t apply it for a few days and have since washed my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>This is a product I normally order from Paul Mitchell but decided to give it a try on Amazon.</li>
      <li>Oh well, live and learn.  </li>
      <li>Feels very soft.</li>
      <li>it has NEVER been this soft before in my life</li>
      <li>but now I want to use this product for my natural hair.</li>
      <li>It didn&#x27;t make my hair frizzy because my hair is just idk sensitive</li>
      <li>It makes my hair soft, silky, and shiny.</li>
      <li>SAME exact type of product, same benefits.</li>
      <li>this should last a normal person</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m Hawaiian, and have thick, curly hair that during the winter, gets dry and frizzy and the macadamia nut oil really makes it so soft and frizz free.</li>
      <li>Originally got a small sample of this product on the back of the shampoo bottle...tried it once and was hooked ever since.  </li>
      <li>My hair was so bouncy and silky when I flat ironed it, and my dry scalp felt really refreshed</li>
      <li>If it&#x27;s weighing down your hair, you&#x27;re probably using too much.</li>
      <li>I have thick, frizzy, wavy hair that I blow dry straight and use hot rollers for volume.</li>
      <li>My hair was shiny and soft without putting the Organix Awapuhi dry oil in my hair.</li>
      <li>and when my hair is dry it is silky soft, not frizzy at all and</li>
      <li>As far as the \\&quot;repairing\\&quot; part, haven&#x27;t used it long enough but time will tell.</li>

<li> /&gt;the bottle is teeny tiny, but even with my ridiculous horse-hair it doesn&#x27;t take much to do the trick!</li>
<li> And I&#x27;ve found that using this product along with Ted Gibson&#x27;s \\&quot;Build It\\&quot; and the HSI 1\\&quot; flat iron is the way to silky, bouncy, volumized hair!  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This stuff is the best smelling oil I have smelt so far.&lt;br /&gt;Its very light and doesn&#x27;t leave my hands feeling really greasy.</li>
    <li> I swear by this product!!!! I dye my hair almost every other week and my hair is DEAD. I normally use Fekkai&#x27;s Brilliant Glossing creme after every shower just to comb through my hair without it breaking but it can get pricey!! Then my boss introduced this to me and I AM SOLD! Plus It&#x27;s smells AMAZING! Now my hair feels and looks better than it has in a long while!!!! I can&#x27;t live without this product! :)</li>
    <li> Oh well, live and learn.  My roommate has the Macadamia Nut oil and I&#x27;ve used it and love it!  I&#x27;m Hawaiian, and have thick, curly hair that during the winter, gets dry and frizzy and the macadamia nut oil really makes it so soft and frizz free. .Hoped this one would work as well (and hoped for the bonus of smelling like ginger flowers - nope.) but, while it&#x27;s not bad it&#x27;s not as good.  That&#x27;s okay, I&#x27;ll just continue stealing my roommates!  &#x3D;)  Kidding, I&#x27;ll just get the Mac Nut instead next time.</li>
    <li> If you would love to look like you haven&#x27;t washed your hair in days, this is it!!&lt;br /&gt;Even using a tiny bit weighs my hair down. It may not be the same for other&#x27;s.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s just sitting under the sink now.</li>
    <li> With just a little dab this oil did the trick for me. It didn&#x27;t make my hair frizzy because my hair is just idk sensitive I guess you could say. I go to the salon every week and get under the dryer with rollers for like an hr and then get it straightened. That&#x27;s the kind of hair I deal with, a bit NAPPY!! So, if I use the wrong product at the end of the day it just looks frizzy. This made my hair sleek with a little shine but not to the extent where your hair just gets oily and then you feel like you have to wash it. It just worked great and I only use it twice a week and wash my hair once a week. I would definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> love love love love love!!! I love this product! I love organix! when I had a perm, I would put in organix Macademia Nut conditioner, and rub this oil lightly through my hair, and air dry. My hair would dry, and within an hr or two, I would have flawless bounce and curls. Mind you, my hair is type 3c, and very kinky coily. I love this! ANd the smell is to die for!</li>
    <li> Originally got a small sample of this product on the back of the shampoo bottle...tried it once and was hooked ever since.  It&#x27;s light, easy to apply, smells clean, and doesn&#x27;t leave hair stiff like other products can and it doesn&#x27;t weigh the hair down.  One only needs a very small amount to be effictive.  I would definately recommend trying it.</li>
    <li> This oil is not greasy when it&#x27;s used on towel dried hair.  I would recommend it.  I put amount smaller than the size of a dime in my shoulder length thick almost straight hair then blow dry.  It works great on fly away hair.</li>
    <li> Bought this for about a quarter of the price had had I purchased the paul mitchell awapuhi oil. SAME exact type of product, same benefits. Only bummer is it&#x27;s not a pump container, hard to get the same amount of oil each time. Works well on all types of hair</li>
    <li> Great substitute for Paul. Mitchell Awapuhi Ginger oil. Searching for Paul Mitchell and found this for 1/2 the price.  Keeps my hair from getting dry but you don&#x27;t even know it&#x27;s there.</li>
    <li> This is a product I normally order from Paul Mitchell but decided to give it a try on Amazon. I have only used a couple times but it is a comparable product at lower the cost with great results. This vendor ships quickly &amp; I would recommend their product &amp; services.</li>
    <li> i have VERY VERY thick coarse long hair. honestly i have the thickest most coarse hair i have ever seen. ever. (&amp; it&#x27;&#x27;s a curse, not a blessing) my hair is itchy and unpleasant when it touches my neck, back or arms. i hate my hair, always have, until i started using this product which has made my hair SUPER soft!! it has NEVER been this soft before in my life, i can&#x27;t get over it, it&#x27;s nuts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i put this on my wet hair when i get out of the shower, starting at the bottom and working my way up so barely any gets the top of my head (so it&#x27;s not oily) and good god this stuff makes my hair so nice. i&#x27;ve actually bought a ton of Organix products now because this one works so well &amp; can&#x27;t wait to try them all out! SOOOO excited!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the bottle is teeny tiny, but even with my ridiculous horse-hair it doesn&#x27;t take much to do the trick! about a quarter sized plop for each side of my hair is enough for me, keep in mind i have enough hair for at least 3 people. this should last a normal person quite a while!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By the way this costs about the same on amazon as it does in the store so your choice which is more convenient!</li>
    <li> i have the macadamia oil by organix and i love it so i decided to try this one, and is not that good, also it makes my hair look oily and heavy</li>
    <li> I have only used the product once but I am pretty sure that it is quality when used correctly. Like any other oil just go really easy on it.</li>
    <li> This is one of the best products I&#x27;ve ever used on my hair.  It doesn&#x27;t weigh it down and smells great. Gotten compliments on how great my hair looks.  As far as the \\&quot;repairing\\&quot; part, haven&#x27;t used it long enough but time will tell.</li>
    <li> I was recommended by a stylist to use the Organix Moroccan Oil products to get the frizz out of my wavy Malayasian hair extensions. However, everywhere I went the Moroccan Oil products were either sold out or too expensive. I saw this one and like that it provided protection and repaired dry, damaged hair. I washed my hair and conditioned my hair with this line of products. My extensions and leave out were unbelievably soft and frizz free. My hair was shiny and soft without putting the Organix Awapuhi dry oil in my hair. I put the Awapuhi dry oil on the ends of my extensions and in my leave out. My hair was so bouncy and silky when I flat ironed it, and my dry scalp felt really refreshed and my flakes were all gone. Originally, I purchased this product just for my extensions but now I want to use this product for my natural hair. The smell of these products are unique...between a grape and a floral scent. Absolutely love Organix Awapuhi products!</li>
    <li> I used to buy this at Walmart, but it has disappeared from my local store, so I tracked it down on Amazon. This is a lighter oil product than most oils. It doesn&#x27;t leave your hair or skin greasy, and it doesn&#x27;t build up and require a daily shampoo. It works especially well on the dry ends of long hair. It makes a great styling oil.</li>
    <li> ITS SO GOOD NO WORDS JUST BUY IT YOUR HAIR Wi THANK YOU!&lt;br /&gt;No frizz , no build up and it dose not way your hair down.</li>
    <li> This brand is great. It makes your hair feel great. Anybody that colors their hair should give it a try.</li>
    <li> So I tried this stuff on a whim, and it blew my mind. I&#x27;ve now gone through the whole bottle and need to get more ASAP. It soaks in fast, smells amazing, and it tames frizz like nobody&#x27;s business. The best part is, my hair actually looks shiny and healthy, NOT GREASY. Be forewarned you need A TINY DROP. If it&#x27;s weighing down your hair, you&#x27;re probably using too much. My hair is halfway down my back and about two dime-sized drops is plenty.</li>
    <li> this thing is great it does not weight my hair down. I don&#x27;t like blow drying my hair after I wash it but that leaves it to become a frizzy ugly mess.. but using this oil I just have to put it on my damp hair and go out and about and when my hair is dry it is silky soft, not frizzy at all and looking good (i have natural wavy hair).. I do have long hair so I use a little more than a pea size drop.. more like a penny sized drop :P so I wish the bottle was bigger because it is so tiny! but I mean 3.3 oz makes it great for traveling lol the smell is delicious while its in the bottle... i cant really smell it on my hair which might be good for people who don&#x27;t like smells.. i like smelling life fruits and flowers lol</li>
    <li> Very nice dry oil. Doesn&#x27;t leave hair greasy or weighed down. Feels very soft. Haven&#x27;t used long enough to judge &amp;#34;repairing&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> I have thick, frizzy, wavy hair that I blow dry straight and use hot rollers for volume. I have tried so many products for my hair (mostly expensive) and this one is by far the BEST! It makes my hair soft, silky, and shiny. My hair always looks great when I use it. I highly recommend giving it a try and you can&#x27;t beat the price!</li>
    <li> I loved this styling oil.  I love awapuhi in general -- I love the scent of it so this styling oil smells great to me.  It also worked nice on my hair.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s so light and it smells so good. It leaves my hair so moisturize. A little bit goes a long way.</li>
    <li> I get really ugly split ends and crazy flyaways after flat ironing and needed something light but cheap to put on my hair after straightening. I will say I used this on possibly the worst hair day ever and it got rid of most of the flyaways AND made my ends look healthy. And my ends have stayed looking healthy even though I didn&#x27;t apply it for a few days and have since washed my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not to mention, it smells amazing. It has a very light fruity sent that still somehow manages to overpower the burnt hair smell that often comes with flat ironing.</li>
    <li> AMAZING styling oil!! Works perfectly without being too oily and tames frizz all day and night. Definitely worth the wait to be delivered! :)</li>
    <li> Read about this product in &amp;#34;Style&amp;#34; magazine.  It does work.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t leave an oily residue in hair but definitely makes it soft and healthy feeling. As always, this smells divine!</li>
    <li> I love awapuhi dry styling oil! I have thick, frizzy hair that is difficult to deal with. While other people search for volume mousse, I&#x27;ll be looking for something that flattens out my hair while still giving it that shine and silkiness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This styling oil does it all. Not only does it take a very small amount of product per use (and is not greasy), but my hair stays soft until the next shower. I&#x27;ve even waited on a shower for a few days and my hair is still smooth and smells great. What more could you want? :-)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve discovered the secret to soft, bouncy hair!  This Awapuhi Ginger Dry Oil is a great product!  Just need a little, warm it between hands before lightly applying.  And I&#x27;ve found that using this product along with Ted Gibson&#x27;s \\&quot;Build It\\&quot; and the HSI 1\\&quot; flat iron is the way to silky, bouncy, volumized hair!  I&#x27;ve tried a ton of different products and these 3 used together are the ticket!  (I don&#x27;t represent any of these 3 products, I simply want to share that I&#x27;ve finally found a combo that makes a healthy difference in my hair!)</li>
