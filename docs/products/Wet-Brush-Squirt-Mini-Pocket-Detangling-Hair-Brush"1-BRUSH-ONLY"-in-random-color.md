      <li>So glad to have this brush.  </li>
      <li>Never in my wildest dreams would I have ever thought I&#x27;d be able to brush her hair while washing it.  </li>
      <li>Having it in a more sparkling color would have made it more appealing for kids.</li>
      <li>I love these brushes, this mini is always in my purse.</li>
      <li>However, these are the most pain-free brushes I&#x27;ve ever tried.</li>

      <li>I don&#x27;t know who came up with this concept, but I hope she is getting rich!  </li>
      <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The seller got it to me quick, the packaging was as nice as any retail store.  </li>
      <li>It works just as good as the large brush</li>
      <li>These seemed to be made more cheaply than others I&#x27;ve purchased.  </li>
      <li>The Wet brush is the best brush I&#x27;ve ever used!  </li>
      <li>Best wet squirt</li>
      <li>works on my daughter&#x27;s hair which knots easy.</li>
      <li>It makes hair brushing extremely easy</li>
      <li>It easily brushes through the snarls that can cause stress.  </li>
      <li>I love the full size brushes, but this one seems flimsy and the bristles are easily bent.  </li>
      <li>Be sure to also get the full size version for home.</li>
      <li>I bought this item about two weeks ago and it worked fine</li>
      <li>Best brush to use on little girls.</li>
      <li>It goes through your hair so smoothly and doesn&#x27;t snag, pull or rip your hair.  </li>
      <li>If you get a lot of tangles in your hair this is such a great purchase.</li>
      <li>She wakes up with smooth and detangled hair.</li>
      <li>These tiny ones are great for my purse</li>
      <li>Brushes great, gets all of my daughters fine long hair.</li>
      <li>The best brush ever for little kids!  </li>
      <li>I should mention that I originally bought my first, full-sized brush (bought more to keep at work, etc.)</li>
      <li>and it work pretty good, way easier on my hair than my normal comb.</li>
      <li>Love, love, love these brushes for long hair!!!  </li>
      <li>Bought this for my gym bag and it works just as well as the full size.</li>
      <li>She&#x27;s 5-years old and uses it to brush her own hair.  </li>
      <li>I will still use the big one on a daily basis but the squirt is a great addition for trips and nicely sized for toddlers-kids.</li>
      <li>LOVE THEM SO MUCH...</li>
      <li>Great product and actually works as promised, I highly recommend this product to anyone who&#x27;s hair breaks easily or has a tender head.</li>
      <li>I hope to be able to give her plenty more of these in the future!</li>
      <li>The wet brush is amazing!</li>
      <li>it just didnt untangle my hair the way it did the first week or two that i use it!</li>
      <li>it really works!!</li>
      <li>great for a little purse.</li>
      <li>Great little  brushes for children and adults.</li>
      <li>but, after a week, it stopped untangling my hair nice and easy and stared doing what every other hair brush does ( tugging on my hair like if it was the rope used in tug-a-war)</li>
      <li>Turns out, this one for some reason is not as effective as the bigger sized one.</li>
      <li>These little brushes do the same awesome job as the full size ones.</li>
      <li>Went right into the trash.</li>
      <li>Plus it&#x27;s really east to clean.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Love these brushes, no more crying from my 2 year old when I brush her hair!</li>
    <li> Best brush to use on little girls. Bristles are soft. Great handle.</li>
    <li> Great brush to keep in your purse!</li>
    <li> Let me start by saying that I am a HUGE fan of the full-sized Wet Brush. My hair is waist-length, naturally wavy and very thick, so it&#x27;s hard to find any brush that will comb through it without tangling. The full-sized Wet Brush works amazingly well for me, so I decided to buy two of the Squirt mini brushes, one for my shower to comb conditioner through my hair, and one to keep in my purse. Unfortunately, the mini brush is nowhere near as good as the original. It only has about half as many bristles per inch as the original, the bristles are further apart and have different tips on the end of the bristles. Because of this, it won&#x27;t penetrate into the thickness of my hair, and the bristles just bend. It&#x27;s basically completely useless. If you&#x27;re thinking of buying another Wet Brush, skip the Squirt and get the original.</li>
    <li> Great brushes...I.have very thick long hair and these brushes go right through my hair with no problem. :)</li>
    <li> Perfect addition to my purse! Not bulky and works great. Love this brush.</li>
    <li> These seemed to be made more cheaply than others I&#x27;ve purchased.  I returned them and ordered from someone else.</li>
    <li> My hair is a bit thick and the tines on this brush are too flexible for my hair.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know who came up with this concept, but I hope she is getting rich!  It really works on wet or dry hair without ripping the hair and with very little pulling!  This Mini is not really pocket size, but fits nicely in the bag I carry along with all the girls&#x27; &amp;#34;stuff&amp;#34; in it.</li>
    <li> How have I never had a wet brush before? These little things rock. Have purchased multiples for family and friends. The do not tug or pull on hair at all. Even brushing wet, unconditioned hair - it glides through. This is a great size for travel, to keep in your car, purse, etc. Would be great on kids hair to painlessly detangle.</li>
    <li> I was very happy with a purchase of this product last year so bought two more.  As soon as I opened the package, the smell was so terrible that my daughter could not even have the brushes in her bathroom.  I&#x27;ve tried soaking them, cleaning them and the smell is still just awful.  DO NOT BUY unless you have no sense of smell...</li>
    <li> Brushes great, gets all of my daughters fine long hair. It doesn&#x27;t tangle or knot and she likes to use it in mommy too.</li>
    <li> A very small brush that gets the job done! I was hesitant because I thought it would be too small for my below the shoulder length hair, but it works great for touch ups while out if the house. Be sure to also get the full size version for home. These are great brushes!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If this review has been helpful to you, please click yes below. Thank you.</li>
    <li> the bristle tops were not completely covered on mine, making it hurt a bit when in use</li>
    <li> The only brush my toddler lets me use.</li>
    <li> One for me and one for the granddaughter.  Works way better then a regular brush.  I like this small one for traveling.</li>
    <li> I have the full-sized brush, and compared to that, this little one doesn&#x27;t do nearly the same job. I have very thick long hair, and like the large brush mainly because it reduces the amount of hair that comes out when brushing and detangling. This little brush performs much the same as a regular comb - more hair than I would like is left in the teeth at the end. It&#x27;s still a good brush if you haven&#x27;t tried the large one, but even for traveling, I would recommend taking the large one if possible.</li>
    <li> The Wet brush is the best brush I&#x27;ve ever used!  It detangles without pulling or ripping my hair and actually gets the knots out very easily.  Pretty amazing!  I keep this mini brush in my work bag or purse and it&#x27;s a great portable brush!</li>
    <li> My sister loves these brushes and hinted that she would like a small version to have in her desk at work... I got these as stocking stuffers for a couple family members.</li>
    <li> I like this little brush to carry with me. It works well with long hair.  It easily brushes through the snarls that can cause stress.  It is a nice size and easy to use on both wet and dry hair</li>
    <li> I have the regular Wet Brush and it works better at detangling my super fine and long hair. It worked so well that I bought the Squirt Mini for travel because I don&#x27;t want to be without it. Unfortunately the mini just doesn&#x27;t cut it. The bristles get pushed down into the brush rendering it useless. The regular wet brush doesn&#x27;t have this issue.</li>
    <li> we never really used this one because we have the full size wet brush, its very soft and does not heart your scalp</li>
    <li> So glad to have this brush.  No more arguing with my daughter.  She doesn&#x27;t mind her hair being brushed anymore.  What a relief.</li>
    <li> We didn&#x27;t notice any odor and it&#x27;s made a huge difference in washing our 2 year old&#x27;s hair.  Previously, it was a battle to comb/brush her hair.  Now, it&#x27;s become at least manageable because of this brush.  It doesn&#x27;t pull her hair like combs do but it still digs into the hair enough to get through, unlike the brushes with lots of fine bristles.  Also, although others have mentioned that there are too few bristles, we have not found that to be a problem.  All in all, this brush has really made bath time easier for us and our daughter  Couldn&#x27;t be happier with this product.</li>
    <li> my daughter screams at me waaaaay less with this brush. :)</li>
    <li> We have had 3 other wet brushes and this was definantly not a legit wet brush. The rubber or plastic ends started falling off within the first week and the bristles are pushing down inside the brush head!</li>
    <li> Best brush ever, better than tangle.</li>
    <li> I love these brushes, this mini is always in my purse.</li>
    <li> Bought 2 for my granddaughters and one for me...LOVE THEM SO MUCH...</li>
    <li> This brush is smaller than the original Wet Brush, true, but the spacing of the bristles is pretty far apart. It also has a smell that is petroleum-ish, but also a little funky.  I have washed it a few times and the smell is still pretty strong.  The larger ones that I bought also smell.  I should mention that I originally bought my first, full-sized brush (bought more to keep at work, etc.) at Sally&#x27;s and it did not have an odor.</li>
    <li> I recently purchased this for a trip.. As soon as it arrived my toddler fell in love with it and doesn&#x27;t share it with me so a second one is on its way. My biggest concern was if it would be as good as the original size wet brush, and it definitely is. I&#x27;ve tried it couple mornings after shower and no problem detangling my hair without any pulling (I have long, very fine, color treated hair). I will still use the big one on a daily basis but the squirt is a great addition for trips and nicely sized for toddlers-kids.</li>
    <li> We have the full size wet brush and needed the mini version too to keep in my purse. This brush is amazing!  I no longer have to chase my daughters around the house to brush their hair!</li>
    <li> This is smaller than what I thought, the handle is, but it serves its purpose. I have fine thin hair and when it gets close to the time it needs cutting my hair tangles for no reason and this brush does not pull and break the hair. The bristles on it are very flexible but I think that is why the design works.</li>
    <li> Her hair is very long and a very tender scalp - this thing is amazing, absolutely no problems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The seller got it to me quick, the packaging was as nice as any retail store.  Way to go</li>
    <li> works great for my little toddlers hair!</li>
    <li> Great for toddlers hair. Mine is just getting to that point where a baby brush from the hospital won&#x27;t get through the thickness of her hair. Great brush to allow her to practice herself or fix her hair myself while she is trying to escape!</li>
    <li> Item is as expected. Bought it for my 1.5 year old. Works on wet or dry hair. Fits her little hand, but also big enough for mine.</li>
    <li> I had bought one of these previously and it worked so well that I bought this one in case anything ever happens to other and they discontinue this.</li>
    <li> These are great. Does not pull my hair. I keep a mini in my purse for work or the gym and i keep the bigger one at home</li>
    <li> I bought the normal size wet brush for my hair and wanted a small travel size for my purse and this was perfect&amp; cheap! The wet brush is amazing! My hair always tangles and this brush makes it so easy to get them out wet or dry hair.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a cute size and it is great detangling hair ;) I would highly recommend the wet brush</li>
    <li> Ordered this for my almost 2 year old daughter and she seems to like it. Doesn&#x27;t hurt her when I brush her hair. Would buy again.</li>
    <li> This had the worst checmical smell ever, nothing i would ever want to put in my toddler&#x27;s or my hair.  I tried to soak it for 2 days to get the smell out but didn&#x27;t work.  Went right into the trash.</li>
    <li> Works just like it&#x27;s larger counterpart but portable.  Hair brushing is no longer a chore but a pleasure to do.  Woo Hoo!!</li>
    <li> Love, love, love these brushes for long hair!!!  These tiny ones are great for my purse and  I also keep one in the car.</li>
    <li> I am a HUGE fan of the regular-sized Wet Brush.  (I own 2!) So you can only imagine how excited I was to receive the mini one.  I wanted to find a brush was compact so that I can take it with me on travel.  I was so disappointed with how poorly the mini brush worked - it did not penetrate my hair deep enough to brush it.  I really feel like I wasted my money.</li>
    <li> works on my daughter&#x27;s hair which knots easy.</li>
    <li> I LOVE and cannot rave enough about the full size wet brush.  Having said that, I really wanted a more travel friendly size of the wet brush, which is why I got this one. Turns out, this one for some reason is not as effective as the bigger sized one. The original size one just glides through my and my daugthers super tangled wet hair, but this one is definitely not the same.</li>
    <li> My daughter doesn&#x27;t complain as much when I brush her hair when I used this brush. It also seems to work better.</li>
    <li> This thing works wonders.  We have given it to most of my daughter&#x27;s friends, and they in turn have bought them for relatives!  It does work on curly hair, but only use it when the hair is soaking wet with conditioner (that actually holds true for all hair types, ideally, but one should NEVER EVER brush dry curly hair as that will create a huge pouf!).</li>
    <li> My daughters and I all have different hair types (long, fine and curly; med-long, med-fine and straight; short, thick and wavy) and this little brush cuts through all our tangles without ripping our hair out or causing tears!  We use this size for travel and the larger size in every bathroom of our house.</li>
    <li> If it wasn&#x27;t for the awful smell when you take it out of the package I would give this 5 stars.  About a week after I opened it the smell went away - but that first week was so bad that I had to cover the handle with a napkin so the smell wouldn&#x27;t get on my hands.  I was worried about the smell but then it disappeared.  This brush takes out every single knot in my daughters hair without any tears.  I brush her hair in the tub and then again before bedtime.  She wakes up with smooth and detangled hair.</li>
    <li> This brush is a miracle.  HOwever, note: you are only getting one brush.  I accidently thought I was getting all 5.  Wishful thinking.</li>
    <li> I really like the full size wet brush,  but the mini does not work as well.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my wife and she loves it!!! Best wet squirt she&#x27;s ever had! Not too big and not too small!! It was perfect! I hope to be able to give her plenty more of these in the future! Thank you wet squirt!</li>
    <li> Works great at not hurting when brushing the tangles out.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m in LOVE with my wet brush. Bought this for my gym bag and it works just as well as the full size. Must have for travel. These brushes are amazing, no more ripping out hair!</li>
    <li> Great little  brushes for children and adults. Good to comb out teased hair if you tease you hair. My hair is thin and I have to tease it a little</li>
    <li> Bristles keep sucking back into the paddle.</li>
    <li> great for travel or kids</li>
    <li> It is well made and the perfect size for my two year old&#x27;s hands. He loves to brush his hair. Can use wet or dry, Tangles disappear effortlessly. I even tried it on my long hair when it was wet and it work pretty good, way easier on my hair than my normal comb.</li>
    <li> Oh. My. God.  I&#x27;d just decided that there was NO product known to man that I could possibly use to brush - or even approach - my daughter&#x27;s head with, without blood-curdling screams and pseudo-convulsions.  But then came this brush.  I think we now own 4 of them: One for the shower, one for the bathroom counter, one for the travel bag and one for my purse.  You HAVE to use it on wet hair though, hence the name &amp;#34;wet&amp;#34; brush.  But what a difference it makes.  Never in my wildest dreams would I have ever thought I&#x27;d be able to brush her hair while washing it.  I was convinced World Peace would come first.  Whoever invented this amazingly simple yet perfect brush, I&#x27;m sending you a hug. :)</li>
    <li> The best brush ever for little kids!  Seriously,  My hairdresser used this brush and I HAD to buy it for my daughter&#x27;s hair.  It&#x27;s the perfect size and somehow manages to get thru her tangles easily.  LOVE IT.  BUY IT!</li>
    <li> This is the only brush brand I can use on my daughter (we come from a long line of tender scapled people!)  She&#x27;s 5-years old and uses it to brush her own hair.  The handle on this model is small, too small for an adult, in my opinion.</li>
    <li> This the neatest little brush.  My daughter keeps it in her bag she carries around.  It does really well on her hair.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical when I first heard about this &amp;#34;miracle&amp;#34; detangler, but after my first use on my 5 year old I knew I would recommend this to all our friends. Seriously, the girl didn&#x27;t cry the whole time and her hair was tangle free!</li>
    <li> I have a full size version of this same brush and use this one for traveling.  It&#x27;s much easier to use when you grab smaller strands of hair at a time to detangle right out of the shower.</li>
    <li> My wife loves these brushes for getting out tangles.  They are a real problem for her and this is the first brush we&#x27;ve found that works without raising the pain meter.</li>
    <li> Amazing for brushing without pain!</li>
    <li> I have fought with my 10 year olds tangles her entire life, the Wet Brush has changed our lives, we love love love it.</li>
    <li> Anyone with a child that has long hair MUST get this!</li>
    <li> This one breezes through my hair with nary an ouch or a stumble. No snagging, no knots, no pulling or ouchies. Either wet or dry, it works slicker than a whistle and gives volume to my skinny oh-so-fine long hair strands. I&#x27;ve ordered another for a 4 year old greatgranddaughter who loves to swim and run but hates to be brushed. If it works on her hair, I&#x27;ll be ordering a truckload. :)</li>
    <li> I bought this item about two weeks ago and it worked fine but, after a week, it stopped untangling my hair nice and easy and stared doing what every other hair brush does ( tugging on my hair like if it was the rope used in tug-a-war)</li>
    <li> I love this brush. I got a small one for my daughters and a big one for myself. It is great for my daugthers hair that is thin and tangles easily. it doesn&#x27;t pull at all or break the hair. it&#x27;s a great brush!</li>
    <li> Been using this on my daughter for over a year and now also use it for myself.  Detangles well without pain!</li>
    <li> my husband loves his brush</li>
    <li> I bought a few &amp;#34;Wet Brush&amp;#34; brushes and they are amazing. I bought a couple brushes for my 11 yr old niece as well who shares in the same fine, detangly hair type that I have. This little squirt brush is my favorite and can easily travel anywhere, purse, beach bag, etc., without taking up any room.</li>
    <li> These little brushes do the same awesome job as the full size ones. These are handy to keep in your purse.  I will NEVER buy another brush! I have considerably less breakage from using these brushes.</li>
    <li> I recently bought the larger wet brush for my hair and was so pleased with it that I purchased this one for my weekend bag. I love it! It works just as good as the large brush and it is so small. I thought that it might not work as well because of the size but I was pleasantly surprised. If you get a lot of tangles in your hair this is such a great purchase. Especially if you are looking for a brush for your car, or travel bag, or purse it is the perfect size.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would highly recommend this brush! It&#x27;s small but sturdy and gets all of your tangles out quickly.</li>
    <li> My grand daughters have long hair (4 and 9).  I takes a ton of conditioner to get thru their tangles after a shower.  Who knew these would be miracle brushes.  Why hadn&#x27;t I heard of these before?  Now, we can get thru their wet tangles WITHOUT conditioner.  The girls even carry them around with them and tell their friends about them.  Amazon, keep carrying these detangling hair brushes -- lots of females will want them.</li>
    <li> THE best brushes for getting tangles out!</li>
    <li> Needs case if stored in pocket book otherwise bristles bend and become unglued from pad that holds them</li>
    <li> Perfect size for purse or pocket &amp; it works just as well as the larger size!! I love it !!</li>
    <li> First of all, I absolutely love the Wet Brush, and use it daily. I have 3 different Wet Brushes so that I&#x27;m never without. The detangling power of the Wet Brush is in it&#x27;s flexible bristles. This mini brush has very few bristles (it&#x27;s a mini) and they are a bit shorter than the regular Wet Brush, meaning that there is very little to detangle your hair. I have very fine, thin hair that isn&#x27;t prone to tangling and have a very difficult time using this brush.  As a travel brush, the bristles are easily bent and squished, so don&#x27;t plan on throwing it in your purse or backpack!</li>
    <li> Works like a charm and a confortable brush yet the finnicky girl still complains that it pulls on all the snags</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t believe this brush actually goes through my hair so easily.  It is amazing</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re like me and you wince in pain while brushing through your wet hair, look no further than this amazing brush!  The difference between any other brush and the Wet Brush is astounding.  It goes through your hair so smoothly and doesn&#x27;t snag, pull or rip your hair.  I have two of these brushes--I have this small one for my 4 year old daughter and the larger one for me.  I highly recommend this brush!</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t believe the hype when I read it in the description. But these hairbrushes truly ARE amazing. We have ordered them for the whole family, from Grandma to Granddaughter. They detangle without the usual screams and tears. (from granddaughter, not grandma!) And they deliver a scalp massage that feels heavenly. We all love these brushes and use them daily.</li>
    <li> Works really well on long,wet hair.  No more screaming because of tangles. Small-fits in purse or beach bag.</li>
    <li> I have long hair that hangs down my backside. Although I have a lot of hair, the individual strands are thin and prone to tangles. I was very skeptical about this brush because I felt that all brushes were fairly equal and visually, these hairbrushes weren&#x27;t significantly different from the ones I already owned. However, these are the most pain-free brushes I&#x27;ve ever tried. It makes hair brushing extremely easy and I contribute it to the flexibility of each hairbrush bristle. By being flexible, it&#x27;s less likely to fight against my tangles and break my hair. I noticed significantly less hair left on this brush after each use and I use this brush on both my wet and dry hair. I highly recommend this product and will be purchasing the full-sized one soon.</li>
    <li> I have been using two brushes for years, one soft bristle brush and one regular detangling brush. The wet brush does the job of both, I love it! It&#x27;s really gentle, doesn&#x27;t pull out your hair, but it actually detangles your hair. Plus it&#x27;s really east to clean. This purse size version is very convenient.</li>
    <li> Love this brushes very much and I have them in different sizes but I wanted one for my purse since both my daughter and I have long hair. Love them!!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t think this brush is the real Wet Brush. The markings are not the same and it doesn&#x27;t work as well.</li>
    <li> I love the full size brushes, but this one seems flimsy and the bristles are easily bent.  Not suggested if you are looking for a travel brush to keep at the bottom of you purse....</li>
    <li> so this is my thrid wet brush the first onework so well and then about a month after using it it just stop working! funny it just didnt untangle my hair the way it did the first week or two that i use it! it felt like it was ripping my hair out! so i decided to buy this one plus another big one and it was garbge!!! it was ripping out my hair and some of the brissols didnt even go through my hair! I think all there brush are made differently! will not buy again!!!!</li>
    <li> just as described and works fantastically,  doesn&#x27;t seem to pull as much hair out as other brushes&lt;br /&gt;Will buy more as gifts</li>
    <li> Detangles every knot in my curly hair without ripping hair out and its size makes it very portable!  I recommend it to anyone with curly hair! it really works!!</li>
    <li> I have long, fine hair and this brush is small and compact but very effective!  I have been using it for a couple weeks and I am starting to see wear bc the brissles are so fine, but I am happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> The best small brush I have ever had!!! I Love Love Love this Mini Pocket hair Brush. Very small and can fit anywere.</li>
    <li> This brush works so well on my daughter&#x27;s hair.  It has helped cut down on the whining and screaming that usually accompanies hair-brushing time!  I have the larger sized wet brush in the bathroom, and then keep this smaller one in my daughter&#x27;s swim bag or for traveling.</li>
    <li> Bristles are too flimsy...not as good as the original size wet brush :(</li>
    <li> Great product and actually works as promised, I highly recommend this product to anyone who&#x27;s hair breaks easily or has a tender head.</li>
    <li> My daughters love this product. I have bought many wet brushes, I keep them in the cars and the house.</li>
    <li> Not only did I receive a miniature version of my favorite brush for my purse... THEY SENT ME A PURPLE ONE!!!  My favorite color!  Great job, very happy!</li>
    <li> Great hairbrush! Slides easily thru my long wet hair! I highly recommend this hairbrush!</li>
    <li> these are nice for small places. great for a little purse.</li>
    <li> Great brush. I use it to brush my wet hair after showers. No tangles or pulls with it.</li>
    <li> I have the regular size Wet Brush for my own hair and love it for getting out tangles without pulling. I decided to try the squirt brush for my Lhsa Apso dogs tail as she never lets me brush her long tail, which accumulates tangles, because it pulls. I decided to try this and it works perfect. I can brush her tail and she lets me and it doesn&#x27;t pull at all. I only gave 4 stars because my brush has a few bristles that bend a bit wonky and not sure if it&#x27;s just the particular brush I got or if they are all like this given it&#x27;s pretty small...</li>
    <li> Love the brush, regular size.&lt;br /&gt;Small brush has same material and feels the same but is too small for a pocket brush, for an adult.&lt;br /&gt;My 4 year old daughter uses it and loves it!</li>
    <li> I ordered this brush in addition to the regular-sized brush. It works well gently brushing through tangled hair. You cannot specify the colors you would like. The one that I got is plain black. Having it in a more sparkling color would have made it more appealing for kids.</li>
    <li> I have very fine hair that loves to be tangled.  I use lots of conditioner in addition to leave in conditioner.  This brush is the most gentle and effective brush ever!  It does not rip out or break off your hair.</li>
