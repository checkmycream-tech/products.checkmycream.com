<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> All the great reviews seem to be written the same person. Dang im good!</li>
    <li> Check them out for yourselves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) Most of the profiles of these stellar 5 star reviews were created no earlier than October 1014&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) Most of the reviews for this product were written within a 7-day window of January 24, 2015.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3) Sure, they have many other reviews in their profile, but there is a definite pattern of the type of products they all reviewed. Crazy.</li>
    <li> Amazon, have you not noticed that almost every reviewer is not a verified buyer nor do the so called buyer wrote any other reviews?  Zero.  People who are balding will believe anything and can be taken advantage of.  Please look into this.</li>
    <li> Nobody wants to see that hair thinning up top. There are so many products out there that are supposed to help, but the science is always fuzzy and you never know what will be any good on your particular head! I have this a shot and used as directed for a few months. I noticed my scalp responding nicely after some time and will continue with this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Application is quick and easy and I simply have to remember to apply it as instructed. It doesn&#x27;t feel bad at all on my scalp. I think my friends are starting to notice that my hair is starting to come back, which makes me very happy. They&#x27;ll all be jealous. A couple of them could stand to give this a shot. I&#x27;ll recommend it to them in private!</li>
    <li> My brother and boyfriend both are balding and I know it bothers them. So I bought this in the hopes it would work. Quite frankly, my expectations were low.  But, wow after just a few weeks what a difference! Hair is sprouting and thickening in areas that were previous bald or only wispy.  I&#x27;ts been very nice to see that ,and to bring a smile to their faces as well.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been losing my hair since I was 19! It was getting frustrating and I didn&#x27;t want to take a prescription product. I was a few haircuts short of completely shaving my head, but instead I ordered this a few weeks ago and I&#x27;ve been very pleased with the results so far. Hair is starting to regrow in my bald spot and there haven&#x27;t been any side effects. It&#x27;s very easy to use and I&#x27;ve incorporated it into my morning routine. I will definitely buy more  Infinite Growth and I&#x27;ll recommend it to my balding friends and family.</li>
    <li> My husband suffers from a receding hairline and premature balding from wearing a cap too often and while it didn&#x27;t bother me, he was really starting to feel self conscious about it. I did some research, and heard great things about Infinite Growth so decided to pop it in the cart for him to try. All I can say is - WOW. I couldn&#x27;t believe the results he got from it. His hair was thicker, growing over areas that it wasn&#x27;t covering before, and you could see he was loving it. Infinite Growth is without a doubt one of those hair growth products that goes above and beyond!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried many hair growing products but not got any success. Yet this product works wonder. I was able to regrow my hair and got back my charming face. Firstly, I thought that this is just another product that will have just false promises but then I thought to give it a try. When I have used many products then why not one more? I decided to proceed with it and was amazed with the results it has given to my hair. And the best part of this product is that it has no side effects.</li>
    <li> My husband just loves this product. He has been using it for a while now and he simply likes the features that this product has to offer. The price is also affordable and the results are amazing. We have bought Infinite Growth for our friends and family and they are also hooked on to this product. I am even sending it overseas to India also as they did not find a similar product over there. This product is just perfect in everything.</li>
    <li> I have not tried this product personally for myself, but my partner, who is in his late 20&#x27;s, has experienced the rather embarrassing symptom of pre-mature thinning of the hair. This is also a genetic thing - it runs in the family. Frustrated, I have spent a pretty penny trying all sorts of products, from over the counter things to natural concoctions - none of which worked. I came across Infinite Growth last month, hoping for the best. And it turned out to be what I asked for! Within a few weeks, I could see a drastic change. My partner&#x27;s hairline had been restored, and his hair was thicker and fuller than ever! There were none of the nasty side effects encountered using previous products. I would absolutely recommend this product to people to try. It worked for us!</li>
    <li> I bought the Infinite Growth system for my husband several months ago when I began to see how much hair loss was effecting his well-being and self-image at work. Having already tried a number of other products on the market - pills, serums, patches and more - he was feeling quite discouraged at the time. After just a couple weeks using Infinite... he was looking ten years younger and beaming with confidence everywhere he went. I am so happy to have found this product and been able to give such a priceless gift to my loved one going through the complicated and emotional aging process. I am happy to recommend Infinite with flying colors to anyone going through the same!</li>
    <li> If you are looking for a miracle treatment for hair growth, Infinite Growth may be what you have been searching for.  It is formulated specifically for men with any thinning or balding hair issues that may be present.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You may be also happy to know that this product was made in America.  Can&#x27;t get any better than that.  If you are tired of hair growth products causing nasty side-effects, Infinite Growth actually contains no drugs and is very easy to use.  Infinite is not pricy and very affordable.  This is also a plus when searching for an effective hair treatment.</li>
    <li> Within a few days of using this product, my husband&#x27;s hair started &amp;#34;filling&amp;#34; back in. It has a clean smell, and works very quickly. I have no idea what is in this product, but it sure beats the heck out of getting a hair transplant!</li>
    <li> I used to have much hair loss because of stressfull work .As a result my hair used to fall very  badly .Iam really depressed by the condition of my hair .But then I found this amazing produuct which worked very great for me ..With in no time my hair fall reduced .I was very afraid to use this .But with  my cousin suggestion i have brought it and it really worked .My hairfall stopped ..very very happy ti use this ..</li>
    <li> My roommate started balding several years ago. We discussed his hair loss and to try to counter the hair loss, he said that he did not want to try medicines. So he chose supplemental ways to improve his hair loss. Taking Infinite Growth the the Biochanin-A from Red Clover was one thing that he tried. He wears his hair short and so we kept a log of when he started this supplement, and a couple of others to see if one or all of them made a difference. This product seems to be working for him. It took a couple of months to see some of the new hairs start to emerge and grow again. One thing is for sure, he loves the results.</li>
    <li> This growth spray is great.  My mom and dad have tried all kinds of things.  Their hair has been thinning and bald patches are almost showing, and they feel this is working for them.  They use it everyday.  I am hoping it continues to work and thicken up their hair and make the follicles that hair fell out of stimulated and grow some more hair for them.  It is not easy getting older and they are seeing great results so far. Awesome stuff for them.  I am sure it would work faster on younger people that have hair loss issues.</li>
    <li> Never would have thought that a product like this actually would have worked. The thing is that it did. I was starting to notice that I was thinning on the top. I am a slightly younger than most so this freaked me out a little bit. My doctor recommended a few prescription products but they all were ridiculously over priced and were not guaranteed to do anything. So i decided to take a bit of a gamble and stumbled upon this. It was reasonably priced and it actually worked. i couldn&#x27;t believe that it actually worked but it worked. Use this product! I swear to you that it will grow your hair back!</li>
    <li> This is a surprisingly useful product that few know about. I have noticed, among many young men in their twenties, that hair loss is becoming increasingly common. While I don&#x27;t know what the cause is, this product is a definite solution. It&#x27;s easy to use, drug-free, and affordable. A perfect gift for any man in your life!</li>
    <li> This product is absolutely amazing. I highly doubt i would go anywhere else for results like this! I have always struggled with hair loss since high school, as well as my father and his father. I would strongly recommend this product to anyone seeking the absolute best results. Compared to name brands like Rogain, Infinite growth really raises the bar as far as quality and legitimacy. Very pleased with this product</li>
    <li> My boyfriend was a confident man until his hair started to thin at the ripe old age of 28. So I had to help him and his dad because I found out his father started to lose his hair in his late 20&#x27;s. I heard about this amazing product from a co-worker so I bought two. I was skeptical but when I felt and saw how his hair started to became fuller,thicker and stronger. I was at a loss for words. This product began to noticeably work in about a month&#x27;s time on both of my guys. Thanks for giving me my confident guy back and bonus points with my future in laws :)</li>
    <li> Amazing! Infinite growth has reversed time for my dad! My sister and I purchased this on a whim and gave it to him a couple of months ago for his birthday. The main factors in our decision to buy this was that it was safe and easy to use, and drug free. Its a bit cheaper here on Amazon  though, the website my sister originally purchased them from was selling them for $52.99. Anyway, my father had a classic thinning spot in the middle type situation, and he had a charity event coming up in a couple of months that he wanted to shape up for, he had tried miracle hair on his own at first, but he did not like the fact that it was very easy to remove the miracle hair with styling and he just didn&#x27;t like the overall look of it. So thats when my sister and I started  doing our reasearch  and found Infinite Growth. My dad started with a daily regimen of spraying Infinite growth on the thinning spot, and after about 5 weeks, we started to see the bald spot disappear! The hair got thicker, and was shiny as well! At the charity ball someone even referred to my dad as &amp;#34;having a great head of hair to match his great mind!&amp;#34; He loves it he still uses it, my dad buys it from amazon now and has been using it ever since! We noticed his hair looks healthier while using it, Its amazing my dad looks 10 years younger!</li>
    <li> Thanks to Infinite Growth for this wonderful product. My husband started using this product to recover his lost hair. We were really surprised with its results. Within few days of using this product, the results are clearly visible. At the same time, using this revolutionary hair growth product regains the lost confidence. Trying to purchase one more bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those people with thin hair, it is definitely a worth trying product. Happy with it and thanks!</li>
    <li> My boyfriend was balding and was embarrassed by it so I was looking for something help him out. I&#x27;ve always seen these products on TV and was always skeptical about them, but honestly since I wasn&#x27;t using it I thought what the heck. It helped a lot and I can see a vast improvement so I recommend it.</li>
    <li> My dad recently became depressed about his thinning hair. It had not bothered him until he wanted to start dating again, but all of a sudden he was really down about his appearance. I had heard good things about this product and thought it couldn&#x27;t hurt to give it a try. Well, it really works! I have no idea what how exactly it works, but the results are undeniable. My father is happier and more confident than he has been in years. I would definitely recommend this product!</li>
    <li> When I saw the toxic hair growth products that my dad used to buy, I was incredulous. With the help of my sisters, I did research on nature-inspired remedies for hair loss. That&#x27;s when I found Infinite Growth, which was completely drug-free. I begged my Dad to throw out his old, ineffective products and to give this one a try. He eventually gave in, and found out that he loved it! Infinite Growth has helped my dad to re-grow his hair follicles and his self-esteem.</li>
    <li> I recently had a baby, and as anyone in the same position can attest, your once luscious pregnancy hair begins to thin and become dull once you lose all those wonderful hormones. About a month ago I became fed up with my thinning and lifeless hair and bought a month&#x27;s supply of Infinite Growth, skeptical that I would see any real results but figuring I had nothing to lose. Now, just four weeks later, my hair is noticeably shine ear, fuller, and has more body and life. I started getting those there&#x27;s something different about you comments, and even my husband has noticed that my hair has regained some of its former luster. I would recommend this product to anyone looking to give their hair a boost, especially new moms who know exactly what it&#x27;s like to want to feel better about the way you look.</li>
    <li> As a 40-something year-old, I wasn&#x27;t surprised when I started losing a little hair. That&#x27;s natural. But when I stepped into an elevator once that had mirrors on all sides, it dawned on me that I was REALLY thinning... that tiny spot on the top of my head was a lot bigger than the last time I noticed. I asked my daughter and she reinforced what I suspected: &amp;#34;Yes, dad, you&#x27;re balding.&amp;#34; Now I&#x27;m not so vain that I would go to extreme measures. No swoops, no implants. And the bald look is still &amp;#34;in&amp;#34; so I figured if I couldn&#x27;t find a fairly quick and relatively inexpensive solution, I&#x27;d just buzz it all off. Again, the daughter steps in a begs me not to cut off all my hair. So I started shopping around. I tried a few things from the drugstore, which did absolutely nothing. Then a friend suggested Infinite Growth. Guess what? It&#x27;s working. My hair is getting fuller and thicker. And I didn&#x27;t have to get a bank loan to fund it. Just cost around $50. I am very satisfied with this product and highly recommend it! My daughter no longer calls me &amp;#34;Baldy&amp;#34; and isn&#x27;t worried I&#x27;m going to buzz all my hair.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve seen some progress</li>
    <li> I have been experiencing just a little bit of hair loss. And this product has changed my life alot. Not only did it grow back the hair that was gone in certain spots it even grew the hair that I already had in my head. I never again will have problems with turning bald with this product. I don&#x27;t know what it is but this product just has some secret formula in it.</li>
    <li> All FABRICATED reviews.  Look at all the 5 Star reviews, see what else these phonies behind a keyboard have reviewed and it&#x27;s either the ONE product or the same products all across the board.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What a shame a product can&#x27;t stand on it&#x27;s own and potential customers can&#x27;t come to Amazon and expect HONEST reviews by REAL customers: Shine White, TruFormula, NuNutrients,OmegaBoost, InfiniteGrowth.</li>
    <li> It’s funny to find this while searching for answers in a different way. Anyway, at first this line of thought was just to ignore the fact that my hair wasn’t coming back, but something must’ve been happening under the surface because one day you could see results. Great product, see some results.</li>
    <li> My wife says she sees results, and that’s great. I love that she’s happy with my hairline. She says she loves me either way but the hair has given me a spring in my step. I enjoy the entire situation nonetheless. Beware though, it took a while to see results and I used it twice a day.</li>
    <li> not sure yet, using for a month, no result yet. will keep trying.</li>
    <li> AHHH! Finally something that works.  And I don&#x27;t mean, meh, it kinda worked, it almost worked too well.  I definitely need a haircut every two weeks on the dot.  I bought some for my brother who had worse hair loss and I did, and he saw pretty good results too.  It takes some time, but be patient and let it do its thing.  Real easy to use, no unpleasantness, and no synthetic chemicals.  Natural red clover extract made right here in America.  I am really glad I bought this product.</li>
    <li> As a male who struggles with the always present threat of male-pattern baldness, I&#x27;m always skeptical of products that promise \\&quot;natural\\&quot; hair regrowth.  I&#x27;m also very picky about what products I will apply to my body (if it&#x27;s not natural, it&#x27;s not for me).  I&#x27;ve tried several all-natural, organic hair growth formulas but found that none work as efficiently or as easily as Infinite Growth.  What made this product stand out to me is that the chemical (if you can call it that) they infuse into this is from a plant extract that, upon further research, has been found to treat certain diseases such as type 2 Diabetes and aid in cancer.  No, I&#x27;m not saying using this will cure either of these, but you can never be too safe about the substances you subject your body to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In less than a month&#x27;s time, my receding hair line is all but nonexistent and I have Infinite Growth to thank for that.  It&#x27;s also made domestically in the US, so that is a plus for FDA approval!  It&#x27;s so easy to use, I urge all men suffering from the impending threat of baldness to give this a try.  You will hopefully be just as pleased as I am with this product.</li>
    <li> Honestly, there are so many things I like about Infinite Growth. I got this for my husband since his hair is thinning. He was not very keen to try this product. However, since we both like his hair, he tried it. He was pleasantly surprised once he saw more hair on his head again. He was not worried about the ingredients. Instead, he just doubted it would work. I am happy that I ordered another USA product. I am also glad that it has no drugs! We will buy this again in the future.</li>
    <li> Infinite Growth works! Purchased this as a gift for my close guy friend because he started to feel very insecure about his hair thinning. I asked him to try this product because I heard great things about it and because it is safe to use. He was open-minded and gave it a try. He started using it daily by spraying Infinite Growth on the problem areas every morning and after a month or so; we started to see results! He continues to use this product and I also noticed the boost in his confidence. This was his first time trying a product like Infinite Growth and he is pleased with the outcome. Also, a plus is that this product is reasonably priced and I am so glad that I purchased it for him.</li>
    <li> This right here has to be the best hair growing method there is on the market. This product shows super fast results! You will not be dissappointed. I amveey haply with this product and the results it has given me. I highly reccomend anybody struggling with hair loss to buy this.</li>
    <li> My brother-in-law has been feeling down about is thinning hair as he ages. When I saw this product, I knew it was just the right thing for him. Let&#x27;s just say I was right on. He has been using this product for a few weeks and he has noticed a lot less hair shed. My sister is so happy because her husband is smiling again. This is a great product and highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Male pattern baldness is certainly a problem no man wants. It is something that can affect a man&#x27;s confidence. There is help in different forms, but this product is  about a more natural way. Takes a couple of weeks to see results in the form of new hair growth. I recommend this, the product does work!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know if any of you guys have tried Rogaine, but it&#x27;s pretty expensive. And, since losing hair is a continual problem, I wanted to find something for my boyfriend that was cost-effective for the long run. My boyfriend has had a full head of hair since I&#x27;ve known him, but since he&#x27;s reaching mid-40s, his hair seems to be thinning in the back. No one&#x27;s made a big deal about it, but I definitely notice and while I will love him without hair, it&#x27;s been really bothering him. Thank goodness for Infinite Growth! You can&#x27;t tell that his hair is thinning in the back anymore. His hair looks richer and smoother than it did before and it&#x27;s all natural..no drugs found in this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Listen up, men! Just to reiterate, most women will still find you attractive with or without your hair. It&#x27;s your anxiety over your hair loss and your obsession with it that is unattractive. Also, I&#x27;m not going to a wedding or a formal event with a man in a baseball cap.&lt;br /&gt;If you are self-conscious about your thinning hair, why not take care of it? There are so many more things in life to appreciate...don&#x27;t let hair loss be the one thing you obsess over everyday. Try this product...my boyfriend and I are big fans!</li>
    <li> I love, love love this product!! I have thin dry hair and I started using this product a month ago because I was looking for something that would help me to grow new hair as well as maintain the healthy hair that I do have. This product does just that! It makes a claim and it backs it up. I love the way that my hair looks and feels now, I have grown a couple of inches and I can&#x27;t even tell now where the thin spots were. I have tried other products such as pills to help grow hair and I have not see the same success that I do now with this product.  if you are looking for something to help with your own personal hair growth issues that is also easy to use; this is your product!</li>
    <li> I have to say that chemicals sometimes do more than all natural products, but my hair can only take so much before it needs a change. I do a lot with my hair and it was starting to thin so I tried Infinite Growth. It was great! My hair I much healthier and I can actually see a change in hair growth. Again, I could not be happier that it is actually natural. I tried making handmade products at home but it never comes out the same as the websites you read about them at. This product was simple to use and it actually worked. I recommend for anyone else.</li>
    <li> I’m not a scientist. Let’s get that out of the way. But I know that this chemical I did not see in other products for hair loss—I know because I’ve tried. I’ve tried them all. And none of them worked for me. But this one is promising. I swear I see a little bit of growth but I’ll wait a few weeks or months and update you guys. So far, so good. I am glad to see this is an alternative to other hair growth products and I think it might work for you if other things haven’t.</li>
    <li> Positive thinking isn’t bad, but I swear I see some good results. Try it yourself.</li>
    <li> All I can say is it WORKS. My husband unfortunately lost his hair line and middle at the age of 28. We are both 31 now and are both nurses. We are very careful what we put on and in our bodies. I was quite skeptical when he showed me this product.(He has tried 2 other products which produced no results. He still was bald after months. Reluctantly  I gave him the ok to order it on Amazon. The box arrived. He started the treatment that very same night and within 1 week he had traces of her growing in the middle and I couldn&#x27;t believe his hair line actually came back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After two months he needed a full hair cut. He was so proud to go to the barber shop. He had been shaving his head at home completely bald for 4 years. I was so happy because he was happy. He is my best friend and I love him so much!The advice I can give is buy the product it works and there is nothing to loose except more hair.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve purchased this item based on the reviews it got, however later I&#x27;ve discovered that the reviews are all fake.  Basically, they are not Amazon Verified purchase and they have all been posted around the same day / date.  Don&#x27;t be fooled.</li>
    <li> so far , so good. need to take longer to see more results.</li>
    <li> Directly slows hair loss and stimulates hair regrowth through addressing the cause of hair loss.&lt;br /&gt;Infinite Growth works by containing natural Biochanin A, an inhibitor of 5-alpha-reductase which slows the conversion of testosterone into DHT, therefore slowing the hair-loss and re-growth cycle.&lt;br /&gt;Natural and drug free; won&#x27;t cause harmful side effects.  Eases inflammation and promotes stronger hair follicles.&lt;br /&gt;Applied through an easy to use spray bottle, allowing full and easy application over the entire scalp.&lt;br /&gt;Manufactured in the USA within an FDA approved environment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bought this product for my brother he&#x27;s only in his early thirties &amp; he was starting to lose his hair... His hair is now stronger &amp; has grown a inch since using the product its only been 2 wks since he&#x27;s been using it &amp; we&#x27;re already seeing a difference. &amp; It&#x27;s easy to use it you just have to apply it with a spray bottle over your whole head. I recommend this product to any balding man.</li>
    <li> Most of these reviews are manufactured and false. I wish amazon would do something about this i depend on objective reviews to pick quality products.</li>
    <li> No results whatsover... should i have used water.</li>
    <li> It works and I will order again! I recommend this product!</li>
    <li> Someone is submitting fake reviews. The truth is that no hair product guarantees hair growth. The 5 stars is a fabrication.</li>
    <li> Have not notice an improvement.</li>
    <li> Most of the comments are false. The few that are verified purchase speak poorly of the product. Amazon should be more careful. Requested my money back to amazon.</li>
    <li> I was expecting this to have a nasty smell like other serums i tried but it didnt. Seems to be effective so far.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my father cause he thinks that all the chemicals hes put in his hair was the reason he was losing it and this one didnt have any its all natural so he tried it and i guess he likes it cause hes been buying it ever since. So 5 star for this.</li>
    <li> I use this product twice a day and I almost gave up. After about five months and almost nothing, I see a little bit of thicker hair on the top of my head. I did a dance. I feel great and I think that confidence extends to my actions and every day interactions. Nice product.</li>
    <li> I’ve found that for per inch hair growth cost per dollar, But not for Infinite Growth. I’ve crunched the numbers and for my personal use it’s the most bang for your buck. It really works on getting my hair back. Nice product.</li>
    <li> There&#x27;s nothing better than an effective FDA approved hair growth solution and I finally got what i wanted. My brother had been suffering from receding hairline and at his age, it could bring him a lot of embarrassment. I heard about this product, and ordered for him. After using it for a over a month, we could see a lot of improvement. It is safe to use and comes in a easy to carry spray bottle. Overall, a great buy!</li>
    <li> I watched my father over the years go from dreads, to a mini Afro then bald.  Yes, having a bald head can be sexy for some men, but my dad loved his hair.  He tried countless old remedies, grease, shampoos, and natural supplements until he got fed up and started to consider getting hair implants. That is when I had to step in and stop him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I told him it had to be something to help him regrow his hair naturally, and that he just hasn&#x27;t found the right products.  I did some research and came across Infinite Growth.&lt;br /&gt;It was simple to apply all over the head, it doesn&#x27;t have a funny smell, its natural, its light, works in a couple of weeks for most, If you don&#x27;t like it, you can get your money back, and the product is at a reasonable price.  What the heck right?  Turns out it worked!&lt;br /&gt;My father can&#x27;t stop smiling.  He begs my mother to rub her hands through it, lol.  I just glad I could help.&lt;br /&gt;I would&#x27;ve posted pictures, but he would&#x27;ve killed me if I let the world know he used to be bald four months ago. So worth the money.  Infinite Growth is the way to go.</li>
    <li> I have tried other hair regrowth products and they seem to have a disguisting smell. This product does not smell bad at all. I would recommend it!</li>
    <li> Not only is my hair growing back, but it is growing back stronger than ever. I love this product.</li>
    <li> Hey, when age starts to creep on ya’, nothing else to do but try one’s hand at technology and products to lessen the blow. If you’re hairline is receding and you begin to feel your age, give Infinite Growth a try.</li>
    <li> The reviews here are false, many on same day all un-verified purchasers. Check internet for other reviews that are real.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried it now for a week and I must say that I do think it&#x27;s going to work for me. I&#x27;m not really that bald but since it was a giveaway I thought why the heck not try it. I think it&#x27;s making my hair thicker so overall I&#x27;m all smiles!</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t buy this product so I don&#x27;t know if it works</li>
    <li> This product changed my life. As a college student, my hair is very important to me and this product turned my hair growth around! I now have thick, full hair and I owe it all to this product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m one of the very few actual Verified Purchasers. I got duped in by all the fake reviews on here. I wish Amazon would scrub out the spammers with fake reviews. Unfortunately after a month of use (exactly as followed on instructions), it does not work and too late to return to get my money back. No signs of growth what-so-ever. It actually feels like its just purified water in the bottle- looks like water and has no smell or texture.  Feels like I got scammed. I recommend saving your money and not purchase this.</li>
    <li> Oh man I was ready to come on here and give Infinite Growth  0 out of 5 stars because I was seeing absolutely zero results but I decided to hold off until my supply was gone. Good thing! I started seeing hair come back around two and a half months and it’s slowly been coming back since then. In my superstitious brain I am still threatening that 0 star review. Keep growing, hair!</li>
    <li> This hair regrowth treatment is something I bought because my hair started to recede many months, if not years ago. I found it easy to use but it was tough to sit and wait and hope for something to happen and have nothing happen. Easier to not apply anything and accept my hair fate. Well, my hairline is creeping back, I am happy to say. It’s not that much and it took a while, but it’s slowly coming back. I’m happy with what’s going on so I will continue to use it.</li>
    <li> A little patience and this product will deliver it&#x27;s result. Let the chemicals do their dance on your skull and let them do the work for some few months. Patience is a virtue.</li>
    <li> This product actually works. My hair has grown more than I could have even imagined. The sparse spots have grown back, and my hair is fuller and thicker. I love this product and would recommend it to anyone!</li>
    <li> Total scam - most or all reviews have been generated by fake reviewers and you cannot find one thing related to Infinite Growth on the web. The content seem to be just water, I applied for 3 months and saw absolute no difference. Lesson learnt: you can&#x27;t always go off on Amazon reviews, the 5 stars is misleading and all made up - I ended up using fakespot.com to validate the reviews and it turned out over 90% were fake - a little too late~</li>
    <li> I bought this product for my father. He normally just lets his hair grow a bit longer and tries to cover up and hide the bald and thinning areas. Needless to say, it doesn&#x27;t look so good. My mother called me one day and told me that she&#x27;d had enough of this madness and asked if I could help her find a new product for him to try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It took some convincing as he had pretty much given up trying products after many failed attempts with rogaine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of my friends used this product to refill his receding hairline. He had good results and told me that I should have my old man try it. After reading a couple positive reviews online.. I was convinced.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I won&#x27;t lie and say that this product is a bottle of magic, but you can definitely notice a difference. Not to mention my father seems happier, more confident, and wants to go out more often.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh, and my mother is happy too! I&#x27;d highly recommend this product to anyone on the market.</li>
    <li> I have brought this product for my husband. I am so excited that I did. He use to have a lot of bald spots and patches in his hair. I would tell him to cut his hair to make it even but he refuses to cut his hair. I had to buy him a product that would help his hair grow fast. When I searched through amazon looking for a product I found this one and seen that it had great reviews so I ordered it for him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am so happy that I ordered this product. It is worth my hard earned money. When my husband used this product within a week I did see those bald patches filling in very slowly. Now that a month went by my husband&#x27;s hair looks great and his hair is now filled in and looks even. I am no longer embarrassed to walk with him as his hair looks so much better. He is so excited that I brought this product for him and now his friends come to me and ask me where have I brought this product from and what is the name of this product and I just laugh but I give them all the information. I will continue to buy this product for my husband and I would continue to recommend this product to any of his friends that ask me. This product also helped changed my husband&#x27;s self-esteem.</li>
    <li> I originally bought this for a friend. They used it for awhile.  It worked so well for them, I had to get more and try it for myself.  Will definitely recommend this to others.</li>
    <li> This is one of those products that are named for what they do. Infinite growth does just that, it grows your hair when you feel that nothing else can work. The product is trustworthy and reliable. It is a product that will definitely please you and would not let you down.</li>
    <li> I was going bald a bit on the top of my head, and also my hairline was receding. I didnt want to use Bosley because of the extreme cost. I decided I wanted to use a product that is cheaper but that will also work. I looked up a bunch and there was this product. Infinite Growth is really amazing, as I seen results within the week of using this. This product is safe and reliable. I recommend this to everyone.</li>
    <li> I am so glad a friend of mine turned me on to this product. I hit 35 and my hair just started to thin to the point of where my stylist while being diplomatic basically told me I couldn&#x27;t wear my hair as long as I like (bob to the shoulder) and cut my hair super short so you couldn&#x27;t tell it was thinning. I did like the pixie but really wanted to go back to my preferred style. I was telling a friend of mine who also suffers from thinning hair, although you can&#x27;t tell anymore. She recommended this to me and wow I am so glad. It&#x27;s tough as a guy to lose your hair but as a woman, it&#x27;s a double whammy. But now with this I don&#x27;t have to worry about that.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this Infinite Growth. I love the way it makes my hair feel and I actually think it has made my hair grow...I was not sure when I purchased it, but it has truly made a difference. I have almost used my first bottles and will be ordering more!</li>
    <li> I got this product for my uncle who has a receding hairline and I noticed that in a few weeks there was a major difference! There were, as I fondly call them, little seedlings sprouting where there was nothing but skin before. And he&#x27;s so much more confidant now, much like the silly and exciting man I knew in when I was younger, and he looks so much younger! (It was a bit awkward watching him get hit on during my cousin&#x27;s birthday dinner) I would recommend this product to anyone. Especially since his brothers are now lining up to buy it.</li>
    <li> I bought Infinite grow for my dad as a joke. he has been balding for years. well I am happy to say he used it. my dads hair is growing back very nice. soon he  will look 20 again. thank you for restoring so self confidence in my aging dad</li>
    <li> I was freaking out after I went on vacation and got a really bad burn on my head. Many of the hairs on my head burned off and it was a really deep burn. I was thinking well guess I was loosing hair anyways might as well try something. After one month of using DasGro and Infinite Growth at the sametime I have much thicker and way more hair than I had before. Im not sure what one worked but hell now I want the bold spot on the back of my head gone now that the front is fine. I will keep using both this and the infinite growth. Im going to leave the same review for DasGro because I really am not sure what one of the two products worked better be buying more of both.</li>
    <li> Overstated product with many fabricated fake reviews.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for a month and have not noticed any improvement whatsoever. If anything changes I&#x27;ll update</li>
    <li> I bet I will never see my hair days of my 20’s again, but after half a year of using this product I see a tiny bit of growth and I love it.</li>
    <li> I am a high ranking member of my company and it is vital that I have a look that is consistent with high ranking members of companies. Without saying too much, I am going bald and this could potentially have professional repercussions on me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; So I found this product and thanks to Infinite Growth I have staved off that fear for now. Who knows how long it’ll last (I’m in my late 40s) but for now I am safe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Every trip to the restroom at work had five to ten minutes of me staring in the mirror and making sure everything was okay with my hair and scalp. Now I don’t have to worry. I apply it every morning before work and I’m good to go.</li>
    <li> I bought it to make sure that my suspicion of fake reviews on Amazon.com is true. I do have some thinning due to male [attern baldness but this did nothing for my hair, it is nothing but a fake snake oil. Avoid like a plague.</li>
    <li> The serum itself works well, it doesn&#x27;t leave any stick residue when it dries on your scalp and doesn&#x27;t have a bad smell. Nice product and easy to use.</li>
    <li> My husband has been balding for awhile and I know it bothers him, So when I saw this I decided it couldn&#x27;t hurt and had my husband try it in hopes that it would work. To be honest we both didn&#x27;t expect much, he has tried other products that didn&#x27;t work. He used it as directed and after a couple of weeks hair was starting to come in where it hadn&#x27;t been years!! It was also thickening his hair in places where it was very thin. He will continue to use it and we will order more. We are both very excited about this product. I was given this product at a discounted rate in exchange for my honest and unbiased opinion.</li>
    <li> Been using this product for many weeks into months and I finally saw some buds of hair sprouting from my scalp. My hair has been receding for many years now but I didn’t bother with treatments because I was worried about chemicals and whatnot, but this product seems safe. I would recommend a little patience.</li>
    <li> Buy this up and be prepared to wait a bit. Hair growth is hard work and is a long process. Sometimes hair growth happens and isn’t even visible for a few weeks.</li>
    <li> This was my last resort for hair loss products. I noticed it’s a little different than other name brands so decided to jump in. I am considering surgery even though it is scary and expensive. I applied it to the problem area, my hairline and the top of my head. Kept doing it for weeks, for many weeks. Twice a day, just don’t think about it. Well, my hair seems a little thicker there now. I’m glad I did it, and hopefully it improves to the point where I’m no longer considering surgery.</li>
    <li> Updated review: I have very bad balding and don&#x27;t know what its caused by, but this stuff didn&#x27;t really work on front of head area to grow my hair back.  I was able to grow some hair at back of head after 4 weeks of use, but its so faint that you can&#x27;t really see it.  I was hoping this was a miracle product but it didn&#x27;t work completely for me.  If I can get the hair to grow back like my regular hair, I will be amazed...but I might be one of the few that has severe hair loss where no product will work.  Just wanted to share my experience, hope it works for you, I might be too late or to severe of case.  I&#x27;ve used one bottle of it and decided to get another one.</li>
    <li> Just purchased the product. It does seem a bit watery, but it arrived as described.</li>
    <li> used it for about four months, no improvement.</li>
    <li> I wanted to take preventative measures against going bald myself, so I decided to research a hair growth that can solve my problem and I ended of finding this infinite growth from Amazon to keep myself from losing hair. So far so good! I see a better result, there some little hair growing on top of my head.</li>
    <li> I started losing my hair since I was 20… I tried many different brands of hair regrowth but they didn&#x27;t work at all. One of my friends recommended Infinite Growth hair regrowth treatment because it had worked for them. I decided to give it a try and have great success. It took about 3 months of consistent use but i am finally happy with the way my hair looks.</li>
    <li> So far I like what Im seeing and feeling. Theres some fuxx on the top of my head, and a bit at the front where I started losing it first. I just wanted to say thank you for this product, works outstandingly.</li>
    <li> PROS  - I used it in combination with Rogaine and it reversed my hair loss.  - Reasonably priced for it&#x27;s level of effectiveness  - No strange smell (the Rogain foam STINKS, this stuff is odorless)       CONS  - slightly expensive for the ammount  - works slowly      RECOMMENDATION     Buy this instead of the Rogaine foam or in conjunction with Rogaine.</li>
    <li> I was taking this pill for six months that said it would cure my baldness. Well it never worked and I kind of felt ripped off by the hair loss industry. It took a year or so to try a new thing again. I didn’t want to get my hopes up. That attitude was good because it took a little while to get going but now I am seeing a fuller head of hair and I couldn’t be happier. Thanks Infinite Growth.</li>
    <li> I bought this product thinking for almost 40 bucks I would at least have enough to get me through a month, well its about a 2 week supply and they say give it 2 months for results?  I won&#x27;t buy it again, too expensive for the amount</li>
    <li> Not sure about this. I&#x27;m pretty sure I&#x27;ve gotten played here. I bought this for my boyfriend. It took a long time to get to me, far and away the longest of any other product I&#x27;ve tried. No helpful insert in the package to give you more information or detailed instructions or drug interactions, warnings, etc. I looked this company up and couldn&#x27;t find it on any reputable health site, mostly what came up was Amazon. When he opened the spray bottle, it smelled like water. Absolutely no smell what-so-ever. All the other reviews on this product are written by people that only have one review or have written many reviews and they give them all 50 products 5 stars. No one is that agreeable. I feel embarrassed I bought into it. This is a verified purchase. I will update later though on the off chance it actually does something.</li>
    <li> My dad has been bald since I remember, and my son is almost 6 years old and I remember that was the time when I started to notice my dad&#x27;s hairline. I wanted to take preventative measures against going bald myself, so I decided to use Infinite Growth to keep myself from losing hair. So far so good! I haven&#x27;t lost any hair since I&#x27;m using it, so I&#x27;ll keep using it to prevent hair loss.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s very expensive for something that looks to be mostly water. The 4-5 star reviews are probably fake. I&#x27;m just upset I threw away $40.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for about five or six months and I am beginning to see results. My smile is spreading on my face as I type this out. Buying more for the road and my results shall prosper! Very happy with results.</li>
    <li> My sisters husband used Infinite Growth last year and had recommended it to me when I started to lose hair. I&#x27;ve been using it twice daily with Rogaine and I can say it really has been working much better than using Rogaine alone&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will update this review after I have the final results, hopefully with a full head of hair!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The results that I do have so far are just slightly thicker in the areas that were thinning, not that dramatic of a difference but I think I have to use it longer to see real results.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s too early , I&#x27;ve only been using this product for about 3 weeks.</li>
    <li> noticed reviews were fake so I sent it back</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s expensive, there&#x27;s no signal of any change, and a I have used as the indication says. Results? Not at all. Waste of money and time.</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t do anything in my hear, the liquid looks suspiciously like water...</li>
    <li> Let me tell you a story. When I was 11 years old, I got my first grey hair. By 16, I was already balding. I felt humiliated at school, I actually got clearance to wear a hat during class because I was so self conscious about my hair. As I got older (and balder), my hair seriously impacted my social life.. I was afraid to go out in public because I wasn&#x27;t confident in how I looked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using this product, I&#x27;ve noticed immediate results. My hairline is coming back, and I don&#x27;t have to wear a hat everytime I go out in public anymore. If you&#x27;re like me, and want your hair back, USE THIS PRODUCT!</li>
    <li> My father uses this and has been very happy with the results. The spray does not have a noticeable smell and he has reported no itching, discomfort, or other side effects. If you follow the instructions and use it as directed for two months, you will see results. You just need to give it time to work.</li>
    <li> Good stuff!!! Swear by it and will keep using it until I&#x27;m old enough to really be bald.</li>
    <li> I am a 50 yr old female with pattern hair loss, I decided to give this product a try because I started to feel embarassed. Within 2 months my hair is so much thicker than before. You have to make sure you use it consistenly. This product works wonderfully and I would recommend it to anyone who is experiencing hair loss.</li>
    <li> FAKE REVIEWS. Look closely and you will find that nearly none of the reviews are &amp;#34;Verified Purchases&amp;#34;. The rest of the story you can figure out on your own. I was duped into trying this product like most guys willing to shell out a few bucks in the off chance it will help stop hairloss or even grow some back. Well, not suprisingly, I have seen no results. I guess your results could vary but no luck here. I&#x27;ve been using it along with a caffeine shampoo. I think I will next try some of the natural vitamins to see if they provide any results.</li>
    <li> i&#x27;ve been taking biotin for awhile to try to stop my hair from falling out. I think biotin works well, but it wasn&#x27;t until I started using this product that I really started to see differences in my hairline. It&#x27;s gradual so you have to be patient, I dont think it&#x27;s going to work overnight for anyone! I used it for 3 months and only see slightly more hair, I&#x27;m not sure how long it really takes..</li>
    <li> I dont know what all the hype about this product is about. I know they have been promoting it heavily in a lot of barber shops, so I decided to go for it and buy some. It does work, but it took 6 months for me to see any results. I guess if you&#x27;re patient as a pastor on Sunday then its a good product for you, but I&#x27;m looking for faster results.</li>
    <li> did not do any thing for me after two bottles.</li>
    <li> SCAM ALERT - Fake 5-star reviews &#x3D; fake or sub-par products&lt;br /&gt;BUYER BEWARE - All these 5-star reviewers are NOT &amp;#34;Verified Purchase&amp;#34; + many are reviewing these other products the same day - all likely to be fake -&lt;br /&gt;http://smile.amazon.com/s/ref&#x3D;bl_sr_hpc?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;field-brandtextbin&#x3D;Omegaboost&amp;node&#x3D;3760901&lt;br /&gt;http://smile.amazon.com/s/ref&#x3D;bl_sr_hpc?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;field-brandtextbin&#x3D;Live+Garcinia&amp;node&#x3D;3760901&lt;br /&gt;http://smile.amazon.com/dp/B00KYXSF00/ref&#x3D;pdp_new_dp_review&lt;br /&gt;http://smile.amazon.com/dp/B00OI4ANG0/ref&#x3D;pdp_new_dp_review&lt;br /&gt;http://smile.amazon.com/dp/B00PWSAXAM/ref&#x3D;pdp_new_dp_review&lt;br /&gt;http://smile.amazon.com/dp/B00O2OHOBI/ref&#x3D;pdp_new_dp_review</li>
    <li> My hair has been receding for many years now but I didn’t bother with treatments because I was worried about chemicals and whatnot, but this product seems safe. Been using this product for many weeks into months and I finally saw some buds of hair sprouting from my scalp. Just be patience.</li>
    <li> Something that touts hair loss prevention should cost a lot more than this product, especially one that has the kind of results this one does. I put on the spray every night before bed and I’ve seen my hair line battle back like world war one soldiers fighting for a trench. But this stuff is such a bargain. Maybe it doesn’t work as fast as I would like (what does, though?) but hair is hair. The only thing cheaper is a hat, so go that route if you want. But if you want hair go ahead and buy it.</li>
    <li> I’ve used other products with foams and whatnot and it’s all a hassle. I guess Infinite Growth got the formula down because after years of trying to get my hair back some of it is coming back onto the top of my head. I am very happy with my results and my wife is happy that I’m happy.</li>
    <li> My hair is coming back in thanks to this product. You have to put in the time, twice a day and just spray it on. The chemicals in this seems different than other products, that’s why I think it works.</li>
    <li> I used it for a couple weeks with no results but I guess maybe you just can’t see it? It seems to work. I sprouted little hairs and gradually it’s getting thicker and thicker. Recommended.</li>
    <li> Thanks to Infinite Growth I am feeling a little more confident, a little more masculine. My hair was actually long before, so when it started to fall out it was more embarrassing, like a guy with long hair and a bald spot. I cut it short and started all the products and found out they didn’t work until I got to this one. I applied it twice a day and I have to say that I don’t know if I’ll ever have long hair again but I think I’ll have full hair once again sometime down the road.</li>
    <li> My wife doesn’t care about my hairline, but my confidence is up ever since I used this product and it brought it back down. I am strutting around the house and dancing.</li>
    <li> I think I’m turning back the wheels of time here. Of course, the wheel doesn’t spin fast. It’s taking months to sprout little hair growth and it’s nothing like I was when I was in my 20s, but it’s more like what it was in my late 30s to 40s. I am encouraged by the results and I hope it has good results for you too.</li>
    <li> Went to my salon last week and my stylist noticed that my hair was drastically thinning. She suggested I try hair regrowth treatment to see if it would make a difference… I decided to give Infinite Growth a try. The spray made my hair feel so much thicker. Thank you Infinite Growth :)</li>
    <li> Product is user friendly and arrived in a prompt / packaged manner.  Infinite Growth is a most interesting science given to us, in maintaining the age management years of our life.   jimmy</li>
    <li> I was skeptical to use this product at first but decided to give it a try. I have been using it consistently twice a day and added a vitamin supplement as well for about 3 month. I have started to notice some fullness in my hair. This product takes time, but it works :)</li>
    <li> bought 2nd bottle, but I did not see nor notice that hair regrow. should I buy 3rd bottle?</li>
    <li> I’m thinning up top and I use this product. I had to take a risk because to let it breathe I stopped wearing hats all the time to cover my bald spot. But now I’m exposed, so people are going to know me as the bald guy. Well three months later and I have a little bit of growth. I’m going to need a little more to be considered “not bald” but I will keep going with this.</li>
    <li> Really appreciate this product and I will update this review once I have a time to try it.</li>
    <li> Thanks for the free sample from super cuts. I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to know but it seems good so far.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very happy to buy this product from Amazon, it is far more expensive if you buy it at the salon or barber shop. Tthe serum itself works well, it doesn&#x27;t leave any stick residue when it dries on yoru scalp and doesn&#x27;t have a bad smell. I think it&#x27;s been working well for the past few months.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t get any results</li>
    <li> My fiance had been complaining to his family and I about him growing too old and loosing too much hair. He complained to us as if his greatest fear was to have bold spots in his amazing hair or loose all of his hair. He&#x27;s birthday recently just passed and I decided to buy this product as a funny joke. Little did I know, Infinite Growth works 1000%. I thought my hunny was starting to look slightly different as the days went by, I hadn&#x27;t known he was actually taking this stuff. He&#x27;s happy that he&#x27;s hairs are growing back in, and if he is happy, I am happy. So thanks Infinite Growth! I no longer have to hear my fiance complain about becoming bold.. at least not for another decade or so.</li>
    <li> My dad and I are both skeptical of everything my mother buys. So when she ordered this it was just another day. My dad has been balding for years and pretty much accepted the face he would be bald one day, but my mother insisted and maybe he tried it just to prove her wrong. But guess what? We were proven wrong. The stuff actually did work! My dad&#x27;s hair has started growing back and my mom rubs our noses in it every chance she gets.</li>
    <li> My dad has been dealing with hair loss for years. With 10+ years of hair loss, we&#x27;ve tried everything and by that I mean all hair growth products you can imagine such as Rogaine to natural hair growth vitamins to scalp therapy methods. Nothing seemed to work. When I heard about Infinite Growth, I decided it would not hurt to give this one a try too. With disbelief that it would work, I was not expecting miracles. But a miracle I got. Within 3 days, my dad&#x27;s hair looked fuller and darker and we knew that this was the product for us. No longer is he a slave to hair loss. Infinite Growth really does help you grow infinitely inside and out.</li>
    <li> Bought it for my dad who is very skeptical since he has tried similar products before but none of them had any real results, and after having the product for a couple of weeks but refusing to use it, he finally decided to give it a try!&lt;br /&gt;For everybody surprise after 4-5 weeks we could notice the difference on his hair, he started growing hair on almost every bold spot he had, and it look and feel just like his normal hair!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Things positive of this product:&lt;br /&gt;-Easy to use&lt;br /&gt;-Consistent Results&lt;br /&gt;-Not expensive&lt;br /&gt;-and of course You&#x27;ll grow your own hair!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended, you have nothing to loose by trying it, and if you have tried similar products before you&#x27;ll forget about them after you try &amp;#34;Infinite Growth&amp;#34; cheaper here than in other stores also!!</li>
    <li> So I decided to purchase this product for my husband due to his excessive lost of hair. We have search in search for a good hair growth product but nothing would work. So we finally got fed up and decided to seek professional help so we scheduled an appointment with our doctor and he highly recommend this product so we just had to give it a try and their it was the BEST product my husband has ever tried and it actually works! My husband now has his lovely hair back and it&#x27;s much healthier.</li>
    <li> A good guy friend of mine had premature balding. He was still fairly young but balding ran in his family. He said that he had started using this product a few months ago, and I definitely noticed the difference! His hair began growing back thicker and his hairline returned not too long after he started taking it. No side effects, no sickness! I think this product is really a great choice! I&#x27;d definitely recommend this to any guys I know!</li>
    <li> I bought this for a friend who was going through a lot of stress and literally losing his hair because of it. After a few weeks of using this his hair started growing back and he&#x27;s been feeling more confident. I would definitely recommend this to everyone who&#x27;s having similar issues. Great product and worth the price.</li>
    <li> Bought as a joke for my grandfather, he&#x27;s been going bald since he was like 50. Just thought it&#x27;d be a funny joke to send his way but it turned out to work really well. The top of his head is now much more full of hair. Its not like &amp;#34;spray on- receive hair&amp;#34; but it does work well. It takes a bit of time and use to make it work but trust me(and grandfather) it does work wonders.&lt;br /&gt;8/10 would recommend</li>
    <li> Works very well! I am 26 and started noticing hair loss on my crown. Had receding temples for 6 years, but very slowing receding (mainly temples). I didn&#x27;t mind the maturing (or maybe slightly receding) hairline since I always had a big forward, but I was very worried when I saw my hair at my crown get noticeably thinner. Infinite Growth stopped my hair from receding further and hair has grown back on my crown (no longer is there any noticeable thinning) and excellent hair growth near front of my hair line.  Works great. I started to see results quick. I had significant shedding in the first month, but now my hair looks FANTASTIC!!!</li>
    <li> I do a little ritual before bed each night after I started noticing that my hair was thinning and my hairline was receding. It’s a little bit of a joke but I do a chant and rub this spray into my scalp. I do a dance too. But my hair is coming back! And I don’t think I have magical powers so it must be this product, the one that says it works on hair loss. I believe it. I would say every three months so far I’ve looked a year younger, for the past 9 months. Or you can ask me for my chant.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work for me. Made me shed a lot. Too good to be true for the price.</li>
    <li> I am encouraged by the results and I hope it has good results for you too. Recommended product to those who have problem with their hair.</li>
    <li> I see some hair growth in 3 months.</li>
    <li> I got this for a good guy friend of mine for Secret Santa and he loves it! He saw growth on the top of his head within the first week of using it! He&#x27;s been using it for almost a month now and he says his hair is almost as thick as it was in his teens. He feels way more confident now. He told me that he doesn&#x27;t have to worry about getting fake hair when he&#x27;s in his 30s now! :)</li>
    <li> My dad was never bothered by his hair loss until his 56th birthday. Somehow, he started being a little nervous and I decided to bring something new for him  to feel more confident. I tried Infinite Growth, and he felt younger after a few weeks. I started seeing more and more hair growing. Thank you, Infinite Growth, for making us happy!</li>
    <li> Even the Least Vain Man Succumbs&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hubby is one of the least vain men I have ever met.  He&#x27;s never paid much attention to changing or being bothered by his physical appearance, despite the fact that he&#x27;s really thin.  We always tease him that our dog, a golden retriever, probably weighs more than he does!  Despite his slight frame, he&#x27;s always been blessed with a head of thick hair - until he hit his mid-fifties and his hair started to thin.  It was barely noticeable at first but then by the beginning of last year, I could really tell that he was losing his hair not only along his forehead but also in the back.  He began mentioning it after he went for a haircut or after washing his hair which is what made me realize that this was a big thing for him - bigger than him even being thin.  Despite all these signs about him obsessing about his hair, I was still surprised when I found the box of Infinite Growth in the bathroom one day.  I casually commented on it and my husband mumbled something about trying &amp;#34;something new&amp;#34;.  Well, the &amp;#34;something new&amp;#34; appears to be working.  I can see it in the back.  My husband&#x27;s bald spot is less pronounced and his hair appears to be thicker.  I asked my husband what he&#x27;d done to his hair and how come it looked so much more fuller.  He told me it was the stuff in the bathroom.  The only &amp;#34;stuff&amp;#34; he has in the bathroom is the Infinite Growth.  I&#x27;m not sure HOW it works but judging from my husband&#x27;s hair now, it IS working!</li>
    <li> My husband as always had his &amp;#34;hair issues&amp;#34; And so wearing a beanie or some sort of other hat was just his thing.. But i knew he was a little down about losing hair, so I bought this as a birthday gift. At first he laughed and said &amp;#34;Hun, i&#x27;ve tried all these hair care products...&amp;#34; And I replied with &amp;#34;You never tried this one!&amp;#34; So he has now been using it for about 2 months now and we can notice a huge difference! Honey is getting his hair back! A+ product, i also love how it doesn&#x27;t have a harsh smell and is very easy to use and the directions are point on and helpful! Highly recommended :)</li>
    <li> Ah the inevitble woahs of getting old.  My new years resolution for 2014 was to get back in shape and start taking care of my appearance.  As a recently divorced, middle aged man, I was starting to get pretty stressed out with all of life&#x27;s obstacles. I read reviews for this product and thought I would give it a shot.  I waited over a year to post a review because I wanted to speak from the heart.  Infinite growth has not only exceeded my expecatations, but it has changed my life.  I saw results so quick and soon became my old self.  My old confident, outgoing, self. This product rocks, what are you waiting for?!</li>
    <li> I wish I could stop time - doesn&#x27;t everyone over a certain age?! Although I think my hubby and I have aged fairly gracefully, there are a few things that make me wish we could turn back the clock - starting with HAIR! Every time I look at old photos of my hubby, I really see how much hair loss he has incurred over the years. I bemoan my own hair - for all the gray, but luckily it is still very thick. I have been telling him for years to try new shampoo or some kind of product, but he really has no vanity. So when I saw this and the glowing reviews, I figured I would buy it for him and see. Although we can&#x27;t do much about his receding hair line, it has really helped with the spot that he was starting to get near the back of his scalp.</li>
    <li> There are so many products out there that are supposed to help with balding, but the science is always fuzzy and you never know what will be any good on your particular head! I gave this a shot and used as directed for a few months. I noticed my scalp responding nicely after some time and will continue with this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Application is quick and easy and I simply have to remember to apply it as instructed. It doesn&#x27;t feel bad at all on my scalp. I think my family are starting to notice that my hair is starting to come back, which makes me very happy. They&#x27;ll all be jealous. A couple of them could stand to give this a shot. I&#x27;ll recommend it to them in private!</li>
    <li> Such a great product. I bought this for my husband since his hair was starting to thin out in the front. After using the product his hair has started to grow back thicker and healthier. Its really easy to use with the spray bottle and it has amazing results. I would recommend this product to anyone that has thinning hair or is looking to stimulate regrowth in certain areas. Its easy to use and the results are better than what you expect.</li>
    <li> I’ve found that other hair loss products were not working for me. I picked this up as a last resort because Infinite Growth definitely does not have a brand name that I recognize. Sorry, guys, but it’s true. My final hail mary pass was caught and here I am with a little more hair on my head after about a month of use. I believe it was because the unique ingredient in Infinite Growth wasn’t available in other products that I used. Thank goodness I found it.</li>
    <li> It’s easy to sit and say we shouldn’t place so much importance on certain aspects of looking pretty or handsome. I started to lose my hair and I always said I wouldn’t care, but the little digs and loss of respect from people really affected me. I was at a cliff—should I just shave it all off or I could try to go in for treatments to regrow my hair? Well I know if I shave it all off I’ll look like a cue ball so I go for the other option. Infinite Growth luckily works after a few weeks (what a few weeks though! Whew!) and I am glad I don’t have to shave my head and endure ridicule from my friends and family. I still don’t agree that we should place that much importance on hair but words hurt and for now I am happy.</li>
    <li> Just when you thought you have tried everything, from sprays to creams. I have been in search for a product like Infinite Growth for years. I never once gave up hope because I knew one day I was find a product that could do just what it said it would do. I am not ashamed to say Infinite Growth helped me regain my confidence.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For years a walked around with thinning hair and now my hair is back. I love my new hair. I have been receiving compliments and people think I am lying. They ask me who is your doctor? I replied with a laugh and simply state I use Infinite Growth!!</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t work at all. Fake advertising and taking more money</li>
    <li> Everyone knows Rogaine because they have a stranglehold on the market. It’s all name brand products because there are offerings like Infinite Growth out here that do almost exactly the same thing for a good price lower. I’ve used both products and all things being equal I am happy with both. So now compare the prices and Infinite Growth comes out on top.</li>
    <li> Seeing a little bit of sproutage. I’m optimistic about what’s happening on my head. It’s thickening. Excited about the future.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried many hair regrowth products over the course of the past few years and I think this is the one that is working the best. That said, I do use many products so I&#x27;m not sure about how effective it really is. I can just say when I started using this one it was when I started to see the most regrowth up top.</li>
    <li> My husband is very happy with this purchase. after using for a couple of times  became apparent results. hair has become more dense and silky. significantly decreased hair loss. Spray applied very comfortable and has a pleasant aroma!</li>
    <li> Wow I&#x27;ve  just about loss all hope. I&#x27;ve used every over the counter hair product known to man.  Pills ointments shampoos And nothing worked untill I found Infinte Growth.  These guys hit the mother load in a few short weeks I have my hair line back I wash cut and groom my awesome hair like it did ten years ago. My confidence is at an all time high this product has given me back my youth.  I will continue to use these products for life and would encourage anyone with balding and hair thinning problems to treat yourself to a New  lifestyle.</li>
    <li> We purchased infinite growth for my huaband a few months ago because he was having a lot of thinning and was becoming very self-conscious we tried a few other store bought and home remedies with no luck, so we figured we would give infinite growth a shot and we are very pleased with the results. It took a few weeks til we starting noticing any difference but it really started showing and it seems to continues to improve. I am so thankful for my husband&#x27;s regained confidence!</li>
    <li> I recommend this product because I have been using INFINITE GROWTH last 3 weeks. This is an excellent product I found on amazon. And I can say one thing you will recommend this product to your friends also...</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been trying to add fullness to my hair after noticing a significant loss of volume. In the time that I&#x27;ve been using infinite growth, I&#x27;ve noticed a significant drop in the amount if hair I&#x27;ve been losing and the hair around my temples has begun to display new growth. I wholeheartedly recommend this product for anyone experiencing hair loss.</li>
    <li> My dad has been dealing with thinning hair over the pass 6 months. It really changed his confidence. I bought this Infinite Growth hoping it would work for him. His hair growth is truly amazing!! We started seeing results in a little over 2 weeks.</li>
    <li> This spray is a good product to buy to prevent your hair from thinning. In addition, if you are currently losing hair, I recommend this product because it has helped me out a whole lot. I am now starting to see a regrowth of hair at a fast rate.</li>
    <li> This product works really well for my husband. It made his hair more stronger. After a month from using the we saw excellent results. He got tired of looking at the bald spots on his head it so he bought this for and I&#x27;m glad he did. Now his head is looking even better.</li>
    <li> liking the way it feels on my head and I think it works, can&#x27;t say yet because it&#x27;s only been 2 weeks.</li>
    <li> Got it for a friend who was losing his hair and he loves it. He has a fuller head of hair and even looks a few years younger!!&lt;br /&gt;If you are losing your hair be sure to try this awesome product.</li>
    <li> Works like a charm!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased this product to regrow a patch of hair on the side of my scalp, I sprayed and worked in the spray to the scalp as instructed, after about 2 weeks of use I saw instant results! The hair follicles seems to come back alive and I felt good as new!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: Works like it says it does, been using 2 weeks no complaints, easy to apply&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: Bottle too small for the price, up the quantity and maybe I&#x27;ll buy 2 bottles next time.</li>
    <li> I was really hopeful this would work, it didn&#x27;t for me.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t believe on this reviews. .&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s seen to fake.. people is writing with no time to have a good results on it.. fake</li>
    <li> I looked into it—some other products I cannot use concurrently with my drug cocktail that I am currently on. Unfortunately, because it was all working for me. I had to move on to a new hair loss prevention item, and I’m glad I can tell you all that it works and it’s making this old man look and feel about 20 years younger. I’m happy with my results.</li>
    <li> I am too young for hair loss. I am only about 25 and it’s tough, because I was losing hair even when I was 24 or 23 I think. I started wearing more hats and things to cover it up, but once I was able to get over it, I looked for results. Didn’t matter how many times buddies would make fun.</li>
    <li> Have been using it for three months now and see no results.  Will keep using two more bottles that I now have and see what the results are.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a while for my thinning hair as I age. When I hit menopause, my hair thinned considerably and I needed to do something. Hair products in the stores were not helping my predicament. I&#x27;ve noticed growth coming in that is stronger - not as thin as my other hair, and will continue to use this for a few months. Nothing dramatic has happened, but definitely seems to strengthen my hair follicles and bring back hair to areas that had thinned.</li>
    <li> My dad tried this out and he really liked it. It slowed his hair loss.</li>
    <li> I seem to be getting some results after a little more than a month of use however I&#x27;m concerned about the price jumping from $40 to $60 in exactly that amount of time with no explanation. $40 was a fair price given the small size of the spray bottle but $60 for the same size seems like it warrants an explanation.</li>
    <li> Clearly fake reviews all done on the same days and not verified purchases. And most done in subpar English to boot! Don&#x27;t get scammed!</li>
    <li> I used the first bottle and got no results. However, since after I stopped using it, my scalp is itchy and I am loosing my hair. I wish it was water as many verified purchasers are saying, but I am getting side effects. I got fooled by fake reviews.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been suffering from hair loss for quite some time. I have tried so many different products, vitamins and medication to help my hair grow back but nothing has happened so far as to my satisfaction. I was then recommended Infinite Growth by my friend who had been using it for some time now. At first I was skeptical since nothing worked for me in the past so I decided to give it a try anyway since I didn&#x27;t have much to lose.  It is a miracle for sure. After 5 weeks of using it, I can see my hair being filled in in places I tried to cover before. I can pull my hair back in a ponytail and not worry about the receding hair line or the bald spots. This product is not only safe and effective, but very easy and clean to use. There&#x27;s virtually nothing to prep. I can put it on and go about my chores, and it&#x27;s very convenient since I am always in a time crunch. If you are in doubt, then don&#x27;t be because if this worked for me, I am sure it will for you. Overall, I am very pleased and glad I tried it and will be purchasing more.</li>
    <li> Many promise but so few actually deliver.  That is how I have always felt about products promising to regrow hair.  However a friend introduced me to Infinite Growth and I have never regretted it.  My hair regrowth has bee fantastic.  It gives me a sense of confidence where before I was always a bit conscious o my hair loss and how people received it.  Those thoughts are now a thing of the past.  And I am as happy as can be.</li>
    <li> My husband has an obsession with his hair .. an obsession I&#x27;m not sure I fully understand. Anyways, genetically, it&#x27;s unfortunate that the men in his family (at least, on his mother&#x27;s side, and supposedly that&#x27;s where it comes from) bald at an early age and there have been many times I&#x27;ve come to find new hair growth products on our bathroom counter. The thing with most of the ones he has purchased, at least from what I have seen and heard from him, is that they may eventually start working, but if you stop, then the hair falls out and you are left in the same condition you started out with (so it&#x27;s expensive to upkeep). And I don&#x27;t want to jinx him or anything, but this product actually works ! He used it for a while and then we noticed that there was some growth. He kept on using it and then stopped using it for a while (okay, that was mainly on accident because he didn&#x27;t bring it with us on vacation) and the hair didn&#x27;t fall out, stop growing, or start growing in very thin. And this product is very reasonably priced compared to some of the others he has purchased .. I really don&#x27;t want to know how much he has spent on all his products !</li>
    <li> Infinite Growth is awesome. My friend began losing his hair early, before age 30. He was upset of course, &amp;#34;this only happens to older men,&amp;#34; he said.  I found Infinite Growth and purchased it, he began using it immediately.  The results were wonderful, he began to see new growth and it didn&#x27;t take forever. Now he&#x27;s happier and more confident. I suggest this product to any man suffering hair loss.</li>
    <li> My dad has been bald as long as I can remember (and there&#x27;s really no hope for him). After seeing this product, I sent the link to my brother who started balding at 25, which was definitely not a fun thing for him. He&#x27;s tried other products in the past and none have really done what they said they would. It took a few weeks, but one day I looked at him and noticed a definite difference. New hairs, as well as a thickness his hair hadn&#x27;t had before. I know he&#x27;s absolutely going to keep using it to see how much more it&#x27;s going to improve!</li>
    <li> I have always had a thick set of hair but after having kids and a stressful job I started noticing that it was becoming a little thin on top in different places.  I saw an ad about this miracle product called &amp;#34;Infinite Growth&amp;#34; that grows hair and stops from thinning.  I took a leap of faith and decided to  order &amp;#34;Infinite Growth&amp;#34;  I was so surprised that in as little as one month my hair was looking like it did when I was 20.  I have bought 4 more bottles and have also let my brother and dad know about &amp;#34;Infinite Growth&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> After using this product It took a little while, like few months before I see some hair growth on to of my head.  I’m pretty happy with the results and will continue to use this product.</li>
    <li> My hair is returning and I am feeling very positive about the results. I have been using this product for a few months and have gradually seen my hair growing back. Infinite Growth has been heaven sent, I have used many other products to prevent hair loss, but none have ever worked as well and this one is very affordable. It only took a month to work, and I am enjoying the results and expecting future success.</li>
    <li> As men,  we often have that fear that genetics will deal us the unfortunate cards of male pattern baldness.  Having seen it with my father, I expected it to happen to me and now that I&#x27;m in my late 20&#x27;s I noticed thinning patches in my hair.  I wanted a solution, and did not want to try hair plugs or drastic measures right away.  Looking for a product that could help I chose Infinite Growth.&lt;br /&gt;What drew me to the product was the addition of Red Clover Extract, which I know is a powerful supplement, even being tested on cancer patients.  I admit I was a little skeptical, but I gave it a week to see.  I was amazed as I saw my hair coming back! Looking less thin, and slowing the balding process.  I could see new growth and my confidence came back about my hair.  I will continue to use Infinite Growth to slow and reverse the effects of hair loss.</li>
    <li> My husband has been literally terrified of losing his hair for as long as I can remember. His father and older brothers all have the dreaded widow&#x27;s peak so he decided to nip it in the bud and try to stop it early. He has tried just about everything,but keeps going back to Infinite Growth excusively now. He says it&#x27;s the best. If it stops his hair loss,and makes him have less anxiety, I love it too,and will continue to buy it for as long as he wants.</li>
    <li> I really like this product because it&#x27;s safe and doesn&#x27;t have anything that harms the body (aka an excess of chemical products). That was what initially won me over. Because my boyfriend has some bald spots on his head, I thought he could try this product out and to our surprise, it worked wonders! I was skeptical at first because I was on Amazon and not at a more well known hair care store but this product is worth every dollar.</li>
    <li> Nothing makes you feel old as much as watching your hairline recede, and seeing once thick hair grow thinner every year. After I turned 40 I noticed how much my hair had thinned. Worst of all I was starting to get that infamous bald spot many men get on the top of the head. I am so glad I found Infinite Growth and gave it a chance. I&#x27;m extremely skeptical of products like this, probably because of how flooded the airwaves seem to be with commercials for products which everybody knows do not work.&lt;br /&gt;A friend recommended Infinite Growth and the price was right to take a chance. And I am so glad I did. I started to see results within a few days, and now my hair is thick and full again, the bald spot is gone, and I feel like I&#x27;m in my 20s again!</li>
    <li> I love my fiance just as he is. But he always had just one thing that he would change instantly, and that was his receding hairline. After years of trying to convince him he was perfect even with the hair loss, i finally decided to support him in his attempt to get a restorative hair treatment. We dug through magazines and search engines to come across Infinite Growth. It&#x27;s been three full months of using the product, he has his hair back and he finally felt confident enough to stand at the end of the aisle and take all the pics he wanted on our special day.</li>
    <li> Most of us desiring to buy products that can grow you hair, we all know how important it is to obtain not only fast but also durable results.  I have been using Infinite growth for more than two weeks and I have seen a change in how healthy it is and my hair started even getting some length. I am glad I chose this product. I will certainly buy it again!!</li>
    <li> My boyfriend&#x27;s father was never bald, but had a very strong receding hairline that left the top of his head without a lot of hair and my boyfriend inherited the gene as well. We never thought to try anything until we saw Infinite Growth and decided to give it a whirl. We couldn&#x27;t believe the results and that we had waited so long to try something....how lucky that the first something was the winner!!</li>
    <li> Okay, so thinning hair runs in the family, my moms hair has thinned, my dad is bald... You get the picture. I looked into products for my younger brother,  I noticed a year or so ago that his hair had been falling out more than usual. We talked about how my older brother is almost as bald as our dad and he&#x27;s not even 30... So I got this product for him. He has beautiful hair ladies, I mean show stopping shimmering healthy hair. Since he started taking this, the thinning has stopped, and he is so excited. Personally i liked how it doesn&#x27;t have drugs/side effects, he likes having a full head of hair.</li>
    <li> My hair was thinning on the sides. From too many years of pulling it too tight for ponytails. I started to use it because my dad had a bottle and it helped with his balding so even though it is a male product I decided to try it anyway and  in a few weeks time I really notices that the bald spots over my ears were starting to grow back. So I myself bought a bottle and continued using it ove the last month and a half. And the differance is significant I definitely recommend this to anyone having hair loss issues</li>
    <li> This stuff is Amazing!!!! My friend is in his early thirties already loosing hair. It was something that was very embarrassing to him. Whenever we would go out it was always a discussion as to which hat or what he would put on his head. I ran across the infinite growth product about 6 months ago and brought it to his attention. At first he was very skeptical because he&#x27;s tried so many home remedies and over the counter products, but within the first week there was progress and he was like a new man, confident completely raised ! Id definitely give this 5 stars.</li>
    <li> Infinite growth gave me a fuller head of hair.  I had grown increasingly insecure about my thinning hair so I tried this product.  Gradually, the hair got thicker and that growth continues.  I&#x27;m happy to have found this product.</li>
    <li> Looking for a product to slow down some balding issues for my husband, I purchased this product for the Christmas holiday season. My husband and I have been very pleased thus far with the results. Places on his scrap where he was losing hair not only has ceased with the constant fall out but, likewise he&#x27;s growing new hair a bit thicker in nature than before. It is nice to have a hair growth product that truly works the way it was intended!</li>
    <li> I have been working as a hairstylist for almost 10 years, the most common question I get from my male clients is about hair loss and hair thinning. I used to recommend whatever I could to help slow the process, but these products take forever to see results and men don&#x27;t have the patience sometimes.&lt;br /&gt;I am an frequent amazon user, I look up products and items to help my client achieve their looks in an affordable manner: I stumbled upon Infinite Grow. I decided to purchase it and give it to a long time client of mine that hasn&#x27;t had much luck with other products out there. After a month of him using it, he came in for a cut and I could literally see new hair growing in. On average it takes 8-12 weeks to see any results with professional products. It really penetrates down into the follicle and boots growth and stops thinning before it occurs. I have been letting all my male clients know about this stuff and I can&#x27;t wait to see more results!!!</li>
    <li> Works great I got this for my dad. He was losing way too much hair, I mean he&#x27;s up there, but not that up there lol. So I just purchased this on a trial basis, I was curious to see if this type of stuff really works. To my surprise my dad has hair again lol. It works, it took about 2 months to see anything, but it&#x27;s definitely working.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m writing this review on behalf of a really good friend of mine whom I bought the Infinite Growth for. He always had the coolest hair growing up, I mean seriously the fullness and thickness of his hair was the envy of all the girls growing up around him. However, with age comes many changes as we all know and for him it was in those lustrous locks of his. My friend&#x27;s hair started thinning and quite naturally he started to freak out. A really great friend of mine had experienced the same thing with her husband almost a year ago and had recommended Infinite Growth. His results were drastic so I thought I&#x27;d tell my friend. Well, he&#x27;s been using this product for the last 3 months and his hair is already a lot thicker and overall, it just looks so much healthier. You can already see the fullness. He&#x27;s elated, and I am too (partly because I don&#x27;t have to hear his wining anymore ha).</li>
    <li> I started to lose my hair about twenty years ago when I was 18. I&#x27;ve never been too interested in pharmaceutical solutions to hair loss. They never seem to work and the side effects often make it not worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried a lot of hair regrowth products over the years and while they are generally better than they were 15-20 years ago. I&#x27;ve been searching for a natural non surgical solution to hair loss for some time now and feel I have found it in Infinite Growth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s simple to use, has no side effects and uses herbs and other natural ingredients to stimulate hair growth. After four months of regular use, my hair is definitely thicker and noticeably fuller.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m very pleased with the results and plan to continue using Infinite Growth for the foreseeable future.</li>
    <li> Infinite Growth is a formula used to promote hair growth.  It contains Biochanin A which means it has cancer prophylactic qualities.  Priced just under $40, it&#x27;s a great hair growth formula.  It is a easy to use formula and it has no harmful side-effects.</li>
    <li> Being a woman who&#x27;s hair is thinning around the edges I jumped right in after seeing this product I still wasn&#x27;t sure at first because just like you I had to check the reviews to see if it was worth mostly all i saw were five star reviews which made me give it a try and I am glad I did because I am already seeing a big difference  all in all it&#x27;s a must try and the price is not bad</li>
    <li> After my best friend completed chemo, she once again began to grow hair.  She was frustrated with having to continue to wear wigs.  I spoke to another friend of mine who recommended Infinite Growth.  The results were amazing.  My friend began to grow her hair back at a faster rate.  Her hair came back in thicker and so beautiful.  Her hair looked so healthy.  She was so happy.  I completely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Infinite Growth has worked complete wonders for my fiancé. About a year ago, he gave up on repairing his hair loss. Nothing seemed to be working for him and the hair loss continued to worsen. Upon hearing about Infinite Growth from a friend of mine and how her husband had seen results within the first month, I decided to purchase the product for my fiancé. Although not being to excited about using the product at first due to his little faith in its effectiveness, within the first month we both noticed growth and his confidence skyrocketed. Today, six months later my husband thanks me nonstop for introducing Infinite Growth into his life. There are absolutely no more bald spots and very few spots of thinning hair on his head. This product is a keeper, for my fiancé and I. We&#x27;ll always be loyal buyers.</li>
    <li> Infinite growth is AMAZING! After months of growing out my hair, I was disappointed with the results. I have never had issues with growth or loss and it seems the older I get, the more sparce my hair becomes. My uncle mentioned that he had recently began using infinite growth and although he had only been using it a short time, he was blown away by the results. Out of desperation I ordered a bottle. After just a few weeks I was amazed at how full my hair started to look and feel. Not only did my exsisting hair begin to grow more rapidly; I also noticed a great deal of new growth. It has now been just over 3 months since Infinite Growth has came into my life and I love my hair! This product is great for men and women!</li>
    <li> There are many hair treatments out there and my husband has tried many of them for his hair growth and finally he gave up. Then one day he came home with this new product called &amp;#34;infinite growth&amp;#34; and said he has heard good things about it and it really WORKS. I didn&#x27;t believe him because he has said same kind of things about other hair loss treatments. But I can tell now that Infinite Growth really works!!! In just 5 weeks of use, me and my husband started noticing his hair getting thicker and his head looked more black. We strongly recommend the product and believe me it really is different then other hair treatments in the market.</li>
    <li> So my young, 27 year old, husband had a dilemma: he had stopped washing his hair. He wouldn&#x27;t tell me for a while, but finally brought me into the bathroom after washing his hair to show me why. His hair was falling out, pretty badly at that. His heart was breaking because his hair is gorgeous if I do say so myself. Anyway, I went right to work to find something to solve his new-found hair problem. I got a few things at the store that didn&#x27;t seem to make a difference after weeks and week of using, and then I found this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I cannot rave more about this spray! It&#x27;s made my husband so happy to know that his hair will stay on his pretty head. He uses it religiously everyday and has had wonderful results. Within a week, the amount of hair lost during a wash was halved at least. His hair is now back to its luscious and full curly glory. He loves the stuff so much he&#x27;s preemptively given a bottle to his younger brother. From him: &amp;#34;I don&#x27;t like my wife shopping, but I&#x27;m so happy she bought this&amp;#34;. (Happy I bought something *shock*)</li>
    <li> No idea about this product. But I only see fake reviewers. unable to find any information regarding this product outside amazon.com. not sure if it is a genuine product.</li>
    <li> I am a 40 year old female with history of thinning hair. Spent a TONN of money on all different kinds of products and nothing seemed to work on my patches of thinning hair. Decided to give this product a try as a last result and within 3 months of using it everyday i&#x27;m beginning to see results. AWESOME!!</li>
    <li> Not bad for the price, seems to work and I&#x27;ll pay anything for my hair. Only complaint is that it&#x27;s not a foam, but the good thing is, is it doens&#x27;t leave any sticky residue or weird smell. The reason why I like the Rogaine foam is because you can really see it disolve into your scalp, Infinite Growth doens&#x27;t do that. The good thing about Infinite Growth is it is a spray pump so its very easy to apply. I do it 2 times a day.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing a baseball cap for the past few years after I noticed how thin my hair was getting. I was pretty upset about my loss of hair, as it was particularly noticable when I put get in my hair. Well I&#x27;ve been trying to use this product now for the past 2 months, and it seems like its been working so far! I&#x27;m losing less hair and I&#x27;ve stopped wearing hats as much. hopefully the results continue.</li>
    <li> I started loosing hair about 5 years ago, and by the start of this year, i practically have a bald head on the front. During these 5 years, barring a hair transplant surgery, i had tried almost every option that is out there including application of raw onion extract ( high sulphur contents allows keratin to produced for hair regrowth ). Before this i was using Rogaine, and with no improvement , i had given up and accepted the fate of my hair. I accidentally landed on this product page while surfing here, and after reading such positive comments, decided to give it a shot. I have been using this product for 2 weeks now. I still feel that it is a bit too early to write a review, but this product seems to be working. I do not see new hair growing in the bald area, but certainly the places where little bits of hair are still present, they seem to have grown long, and i do not recall seeing this length for a really long time. This product has raised my hopes again, and i would like to wait and use the entire bottle once, before coming to a conclusion, but initial results seems to be positive.</li>
    <li> I would say that five to four percent of my hair is back after using this product. I know that doesn’t sound like a lot but I have been using it for only four or five months. It’s amazing, really. I think people can tell the difference from before. They ask if I’ve lost weight or gotten new glasses. Nope, it’s all Infinite Growth. Feels good, and makes me feel more confident. I like it. Thanks Infinite Growth.</li>
    <li> I would say to buy two bottles for six months of use. Three months is good for a trial but the process is slow. If you are like me and would like to give it a good trial period extend it out to six months. If it doesn’t work then forget it, but for me I’m glad I stuck it out as I have a little bit of hair I think filling out the top of my head.</li>
    <li> Read through the reviews, looks like all are fake reviews. none of the reviews here are \\&quot;Verified Purchaser\\&quot;.</li>
    <li> I have used a bunch of products to help me gain back hair. However, the products I would choose from did not really help.. I was pleased and found more hair growth within a week.</li>
    <li> I do not suffer from hair loss or thinning but I have family and friends in the Caribbean who do and last summer I bought Infinite Growth for a friend and now the calls are coming in one after  the other, &amp;#34;It Works, my hair is growing and I am not bald - we need more of this!&amp;#34; So I need to stock up on this because coming summer I will need at least 20 to bring with me.</li>
    <li> I been losing strands of hair lately and was worried about baldness. Luckily my friend recommended me this product and tried it out. Not only did the hair shedding stop but also I noticed an increase in hair growth. Also there was no side effects upon using this product which is awesome.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 50 and have thick greying brown hair. Although through heredity I have not have had much hair loss, I have had some receding over the past few years at the front of my scalp. I have been trying different products to address this. During my teen years I wore my hair very long as I was in a heavy metal band. Now after retiring from an office job, I&#x27;m growing it out again, but with the receding hairline, it is not the same.&lt;br /&gt;I decided to try Infinite Growth a try after reading some of the reviews here on Amazon. I was very impressed with the results, the hair has come back where it once was. I&#x27;m happy with my youthful hair look. I&#x27;d recommend it and am here doing it now!</li>
    <li> I was pretty upset about my loss of hair, as it was particularly noticeable when I put get in my hair. Well I&#x27;ve been trying to use this product now for the past 2 months, and it seems like its been working so far! I&#x27;m losing less hair and I&#x27;ve stopped wearing hats as much. Awesome product very effective.</li>
    <li> I have been using it for the last 4 weeks and it seems it is started working. I am seeing new hair cells are being activated. I hope after 2 months I can see my hair thick and as it was when I had my full hair on my head</li>
    <li> When I heard about this product I wasn&#x27;t sure what to think or if it would work. I called my brother anyway and told him about it. He bought it and began using it and in a short amount of time he had results. It was amazing. I wish they had something like this for women. Great product for the market.</li>
    <li> My dad had a noticeable bald spot on his head for years. It made him feel insecure about going out and seeing people. I am grateful to Infinite Growth because my dad no longer has that bald spot. He no longer feels insecure around people, and has become very sociable.</li>
    <li> I bought this product for a buddy of mine. For some reason he started balding at a much earlier age than expected. After applying for a couple of weeks, his hair loss did indeed slow. His hair grew back a little too. I think this product would be really effective if used early on. I don&#x27;t know if it will salvage horribly balded heads, but it slowed the process for my friend.</li>
    <li> Since I started using this I&#x27;ve noticed how my hair is starting to regrow. I was really skeptical at the beginning but I&#x27;m happy I gave it a try as it really didn&#x27;t disappoint me. In a few weeks i&#x27;m starting to see results and i&#x27;m just amazed. I definitely  recommend this to everyone!</li>
    <li> Infinite growth is a great hair regrowth treatment and if you have hair loss issue like myself, then you will love the option that infinite growth gives. I’ve struggled with male – patterned baldness for a while and after trying out lots of other hair regrowth treatment, am glad I stumbled across infinite growth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What stood out for me?&lt;br /&gt;The natural biochanin A it contains – There are tons of products out there that have lots of chemicals, my preference would be all natural elements. While am aware, it’s hard to find one that would be 100% natural, this works for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ease of Use: I’ve purchased some other products that are a hassle to use. The easy spray feature of infinite growth stands out for me, I didn’t have to follow any complicated list of instructions to apply it. I could cover my entire scalp just like it’s stated on here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To sum it up, am very happy I found a treatment that works just as it says, am totally satisfied with my purchase and I would be purchasing more in the future.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried rogaine to no avail. I thought that surgery or some cosmetic treatment was the only solution but I stumbled upon this product. This product has helped me grow more hair than I would&#x27;ve every thought. My hair not only started growing but my hair didn&#x27;t feel dead. I was kind of skeptical in the beginning but with everything, I give it 90 days and I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
    <li> My grandfather is pretty old and has loss a lot of hair in the middle towards the front of his head I&#x27;m guessing due to his aging . So I bought this product and it really been slowing down his hair loss. Which now is stimulating hair growth slowly !!</li>
    <li> bought infinite growth after a lot of research online for my husband, his hair were thinning and greying, he has been used the product for last 6 months and have seen visible improvement in hair quality and regrowth. compared to the other hair growth product he has taken in the past, this really worked for him.</li>
    <li> My husband has been losing his hair for many years, but in the last year it seems that process has speeded up quite a bit and he’s getting a bit self conscious and wanted me to find something to help slow and maybe even reverse the hair loss. In looking for a hair loss product, I was hoping to find something more natural because the idea of him just applying a bunch of chemicals to his head wasn’t very appealing. That’s where Infinite Growth comes in!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Infinite Growth is a natural, drug free product which makes me feel better than the chemicals that most hair loss products contain. He has pretty sensitive skin and this doesn’t irritate his scalp at all! He really likes how easy it is to use- all he has to do is spray it on and rub it in, no mess, no fuss! It’s also manufactured in the USA which is always nice. He hasn’t been using it long enough to see hair regrowth yet, but he’s not losing anymore and he’s really happy with the product so far. I received this item at a promotional discount for my honest and unbiased review and all opinions are based on my own (in this case my husband’s) personal experience with the infinite growth.</li>
    <li> I purchased infinite growth hair regrowth treatment for my boyfriend. If you know anything about men you know they can be very prideful and sensitive about certain things. He&#x27;s taken pills before, and even used some cream, it didn&#x27;t work. He&#x27;s in his mid thirties and his problem area is the middle of his head. When he saw I purchased it, i could tell he was a bit upset. I thought he wouldn&#x27;t use it, but i caught him using it one day. He&#x27;ll sneak a spray here and there. It&#x27;s been 3 weeks and it&#x27;s starting to fill in some. I like how the treatment comes in a spray bottle, no mess you have to mix and apply or pills to take. He&#x27;s happier to have to a product that actually works, I&#x27;m happy I found it for him, even if he won&#x27;t admit it lol. I received this product at a discounted price in exchange for my honest review.</li>
    <li> You know my dad hair was thinning out and he was afraid of havingbto cut hair hair of 50 years off his head. So I got scared for him and researched the best product for hair thinning and I found this one. I told my dad, he try this for a month and see if you can stop the damage being done. It was hard convincing him to use the product but to this day, when you go in the bathroom, I can see a bottle hiding.</li>
    <li> So my husband decided to try this out &amp; he loved it, he was very nervous because he didn&#x27;t know wether or not it was going to help him or make the hair loss a little worse, his hair became so much fuller &amp; it was really strong new growth , if you&#x27;re a male losing your hair &amp; you&#x27;re curious to try something, I&#x27;d suggest you try this!</li>
    <li> My husband has severe hair loss his dad started going bald at 25 so we&#x27;ve been trying so many different products to help him but we&#x27;ve been lucky with this we&#x27;ve actually been able to see results and see a stop in the hair loss what I like the most is that it is dad approved in the USA it&#x27;s not foreign with all types of drugs</li>
    <li> When my father was losing his hair he tried close to 6 or 7 different product before using Infinite Growth. His hair loss problem was something he cared about and I bought this for him when I saw an ad for it. This product was a lot less messier than products he had tried before and it was simple to use as well. There isn&#x27;t much preparing to do when it comes to applying the product, and he goes on doing everyday things after he puts it on. It also didn&#x27;t have any adverse side effects, he hasn&#x27;t had any bad irashes, itches, or sickness. For the price I knew it was worth it considering all those other products he has used that had these side effects. I definetly recommend this to anyone if you have a balding/thinning hair problem!</li>
    <li> My brother has been struggling with hair loss for the past 5 years, and has literally invested thousands of dollars on treatments that simply did not work, some even made his hair fall out more rapidly!! After several very positive recommendations, I purchased Infinite Growth as a cheer-up gift in the winter and to get his hair growth started and hopefully improved for the summer time. So far, the results are actually tangible, and it&#x27;s only been a few months. He has already asked where to buy more! I am so proud to have actually helped someone I love with something that actually works. The products that didn&#x27;t work were so demoralizing, since he was already struggling with self-esteem issues from hair loss. I am so grateful to have found Infinite Growth, for trusting my friends who promised that it works, and to see the smile on my brothers face now that he is experiencing an actual reversal of a problem he thought he&#x27;d have to live with forever. Yay!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband after he complained about his hair thinning, it really bothered him. He was skeptical about trying it but after seeing the improvement he was ecstatic! Im glad I bought it.</li>
    <li> Easy to apply and definitely effective.  I used the spray on certain spots on my head that were noticeably thinning. After about two months, I started seeing improvements. Friends and relatives even mentioned that I looked more &amp;#34;youthful.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Being extremely sensitive to my hair loss, I felt Infinite Growth would be worth a try after a friend recommended it. I have not experienced any undesirable symptoms and feel safe that the product is advertised as primarily natural ingredients. There is also not any weird smell or color that indicates I am using a hair product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I apply this product twice a day, though the frequency may vary for other users. Regardless, I find it worth the price and would no doubt recommend it to a friend.</li>
    <li> I purchased this after seeing all the great reviews here on Amazon. I was semi-skeptical at first, as I had the perception that hair-growth products were more placebo than anything else. I can&#x27;t believe how horribly wrong I was. This was a gift for my father, who once had a full mane of long, flowing hair. He is now approaching baldness, and so I purchased this in an attempt to save the little hair he has left. His hair has began to REGROW in places where it was balding. I can not believe it. I am beyond thrilled with the results of this product. I can&#x27;t even express the amazement that I feel right now. We will be using this product more in the future.</li>
    <li> My Dad&#x27;s hair has always been thin, even as a young man, It has always been something he was self conscious about, however, nothing he tried ever worked. However, a friend of mine, told me about this product. She said her father used it, and it worked. I bought some for my dad knowing that he hadn&#x27;t tried this one Yet. Unlike the other products, this one really worked. After two months, you could see a major difference. My dad looks younger now than he did when I was a kid!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a big fan of Infinite Growth, I&#x27;ve been losing my hair for awhile now and trying a few different products to try and save my hair. I had only mild success with other products and always go nervous over what chemicals were in those other products. But not only has infinite growth been giving me great results in my hair regrowth it&#x27;s also made from natural products so I&#x27;m not afraid of what I&#x27;m using. Plus it&#x27;s easy to use with a spray on container which makes the process of putting it on so much easier. My fuller head of hair has given me such a renewed sense of self confidence, I&#x27;m so grateful to Infinite Growth.</li>
    <li> Okay my experience is a little out of the ordinary but when I first used Infinite Growth hair spray I saw results immediately. Then nothing for weeks. And then it started to work again a bit. I think results will vary for different people, and it’s tough because for me to keep purchasing something that MIGHT work seems foolish. But results speak and my hair is important to me. I’m going to keep applying it daily because so far I’ve seen no negative and only positives, even if it is inconsistent when. Maybe my diet has something to do with it. I’ll keep track and update if necessary. But for now, great!</li>
    <li> DHT is one of the leading hair loss reasons and the chemicals in Infinite Growth hair loss prevention keeps it out. I don’t even look that bald, I started using this product as a preventative measure. But my hair was falling out in clumps, and I had this product on hand because I know my family history. Use it twice a day and in a couple months I think I see that my hair isn’t falling out as much. I would keep using it to make sure no more damage is done.</li>
    <li> Don’t get plugs, don’t use other products. It’s easy to say that now that I’ve found what makes hair grow on my head, but for me, if I had found this earlier it would have been a lot easier. I use it twice a day and it’s been a lot better than all these other foams and whatnot that take forever to dry. My hair growth is back and I’m happy with it.</li>
    <li> Being a professional executive, I was always conscience of my thinning hair.  It started in my 20s and has progressed slowly since then.  Infinite Growth has slowed the thinning process.  Now my hair is beginning to grow back!  I&#x27;ve tried lots of products but this one is the real deal!</li>
    <li> My fiance started using this product back when we first got engaged because he didn&#x27;t want to have massive bald spots in our wedding photos. Fast forward just three months and he now has a full head of hair after using this product! I never usually buy into these kinds of products, but for the price, I thought I&#x27;d give it a try (much cheaper than having them retouch wedding photos let me tell you!). Boy am I glad I did! Now we can look back on our special day and see a happy young couple in love. This product is worth every penny and then some!</li>
    <li> Purchased this product for my dad who was balding in a few areas. My dad was very pleased with the results. although his hair hasn&#x27;t totally grown back he&#x27;s seen a great improvement. FYI...my dad is 87 so with the hair that did grow back, he&#x27;s doing the happy dance.Thanks Infinite Growth!</li>
    <li> I bought this product for my uncle recently and it has worked wonders.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We have a history of hair loss in the family not really due to old age but to stress.&lt;br /&gt;So I decided to take a look around and see what I could find and I came across this product so I decided to order it and wow!&lt;br /&gt;My uncle has had amazing success with this product.&lt;br /&gt;He started using it and his hair started growing back at a really rapid rate. I was surprised that I had not heard more about this product.&lt;br /&gt;It is so worth a try! Excellent results but not as expensive as other products.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve done quite a bit of searching and research for hair growth products. My dad is 51 and has began thinning in the front. Being that he&#x27;s in sales, it made him self conscience, so he asked me to check out different items. I&#x27;ve searched and this is product #3 that he has tried out. It&#x27;s been the only one with results. After about 2-3 weeks of use, he began seeing a difference and now, his hairline looks normal again. It&#x27;s not instantanious.... but it does work! Worth the $ spent</li>
    <li> The first I would like to start by saying that I was worry of using this product because I don&#x27;t have much of hairs, and I was hoping to find something accelerated growth wouldn&#x27;t hurt. I have to say I love this product. I used it for month now and it was amazed. First of all, I use it as suggested in the directions. Hopefully it will get better and better result but I really happy for now. So far so good. Thanks to this product my hair looks and feels amazing. :)</li>
    <li> I love this product.  I am in my forties and have thinning hair.  I started using Infinite growth and the hair thinning stopped.  My hair is returning and I feel 20 years younger!  I would definitely recommend this my friends!</li>
    <li> I was cutting my friends hair the other day who is 21 and he started to talk about how he noticed his hair line started receding,&lt;br /&gt;I had heard about this product from a friends dad actually and thought maybe he could try and use it for his hair line!&lt;br /&gt;about a month went by and I got a text from his saying that it really helped him out and you can&#x27;t even tell that his hair line had receded at all.&lt;br /&gt;It was amazing, now I see him and he doesn&#x27;t have to wear hats out all the time and he even pulls his hair back into a ponytail without being embarrassed about any hair loss!</li>
    <li> I have been bald for years now...not because my hair fell out, but because it stopped growing (mostly on the top of my head).  I decided to try this product about a month and a half ago and I can confirm that this actually does work.  It&#x27;s been about 6 weeks and I notice a significant regrowth of my hair.  I am excited to see the results after a few more weeks.  I&#x27;m hoping that by the 3 or 4 month mark, I will have more visible hair on my head....I really can&#x27;t wait to be able to COMB my hair again.  I highly recommend this product to anyone looking to get their hair back!</li>
    <li> I bought this product for my husband. He had been embarrassed about his recently thinning hair so I decided to helpd as much as i could. We decided it would be best to stop the hair loss before it was too extreme. I bought this product for him to try. He says he loves it! He says he can see a difference in he hair and that the product is much simpler to use than other hair regrowth products. Hair loss can be a sensitive subject for some men, thankfully they can order this product with peace of mind.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my dad who&#x27;s been single for over a year now. His confidence in the dating game was fading as he was slowly losing his hair pun intended!) So when my payday came around I got this for him (talk about an awkward gift!) and he agreed to try it! Needless to say his current girlfriend has been living with us for a few months now!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We started noticing it instantly how much better his hair looked and you could see it in everything he did how much better he felt about himself. Everything from ordering food to getting the paper to even going on public transport he just felt so much better about himself. This stuff made him more than just have a healthy head (in a very short time might I add!) but also gave him a healthy self-esteem!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I could not recommend it more and for this steal of a price, you would be down right mad to not give it a go! What have you really got to lose? Well, certainly not hair!</li>
    <li> Natural and drug free; won&#x27;t cause harmful side effects.  Eases inflammation and promotes stronger hair follicles. My friend is do it and I don&#x27;t know exactly the secret but it is working on him.  I ma feeling happy because he was feeling a little home sick. Right now he is hanging out more and I think he is feeling more secure and for sure handsome. haha Crazy man. I love him and I love his product!</li>
    <li> My heart broke each time I’d see my husband staring at the mirror and looking at his balding head. Such a proud man but, insecure about his thinning scalp. I knew I had to find something for him and my friend mentioned the Infinite Growth System to me. Getting it is one thing and convincing my husband was another.  It took two weeks to convince my husband to give it a try; I mean really what did we have to lose? It’s been two months and the results are AMAZING! Hubby is smiling from ear to ear when he looks in the mirror now. The Infinite Growth System is a really great product.</li>
    <li> When you are losing your hair, you feel very self conscious and think everyone is looking at your hair.  It is even worse when you are a young man.  I really didn&#x27;t want to go bald and after some research I was on the hunt for something to help me from losing my hair.  I had looked at many products but they just didn&#x27;t seem right for me.  I was glad when I looked on Amazon, they had many choices for me and I didn&#x27;t even have to go out.  I quickly decided on this product and put in my order.  A couple of days later I soon received it and was quickly putting it to the test.  This was so easy to use with the spray bottle I only needed to aim and spray the designated areas.  Within a month I was no longer losing hair but growing it.  When I noticed the fresh growth it brought tears to my eyes.  What kind of value does one put on a new lease on life.  I am very happy and will continue to use.</li>
    <li> Got this product for my brother because I know his hair loss bothers him.  I was hoping it work, not thinking it really would, but, wow! after just a few weeks what a difference! Hair is sprouting and thickening in areas that were previous bald or only wispy. I&#x27;ts been very nice to see that ,and to bring a smile to his faces as well.</li>
    <li> My husband who is aging quite well except for the thin of his hair . I discovered this product and he start using it and we see a remarkable difference already !! Great product will recommend to others.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been starting to lose my hair since my 20&#x27;s. And let me tell you, I&#x27;ve been through TONS of different products, herbs, medicines over the years. I was finally recommended this product by a co-worker. It stood out to me because it had no side effects and used more natural ingredients; nothing harmful. Also, I noticed his hair has gotten fuller as he&#x27;s been going through the same thing as me. I figured because of that, I&#x27;d give it a try and it is a lot more affordable than other products I have tried. I waited to make it a review, because it usually takes time to see results. I&#x27;m so happy that 2 months in, I had so much fuller hair. It&#x27;s thick, and has a slight shine to it now. In the shower, I don&#x27;t see as much hair falling out. In fact, it&#x27;s been getting less and less. I will be sure to keep using this product.</li>
    <li> This product states its for men, but I am female and I use this product.  After going through a cancer diagnosis, my entire body fell apart.  My hair specifically became dry and brittle, it would break off and it was thinning.  I didn’t like take Biotin because I was already taking enough pills each day.  It took a little while to notice, but my hair felt healthier overall.  The spots that were thinning had some new hair growth and felt thicker and I even had baby hairs around my forehead.  I’m about 1/2 way through my first bottle so I can’t wait to see the results after I finish.</li>
    <li> I bought this product for my dad. He was having a hard time dealing with his hair loss do I figured he could use a confidence boost. I was surprisingly intrigued by how well this product actually worked. It really worked and he started to regain hair in the places it was lost. Definitely recommend this product!</li>
