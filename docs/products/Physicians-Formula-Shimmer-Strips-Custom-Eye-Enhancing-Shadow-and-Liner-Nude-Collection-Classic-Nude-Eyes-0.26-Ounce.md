<ol>
      <li>Just beautiful!</li>
      <li>This is probably the best neutral eye palette I have used.</li>
      <li>The eye shadow is great quality, and does not crease on my eyelids.</li>
      <li>Great colors that don&#x27;t smudge</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m just loving this shadow and liner!</li>
      <li>Nevertheless, I&#x27;m very happy with the colors included and the palette has proved to be very useful.</li>
      <li>Just love the way it enhances my eyes!</li>
      <li>Nice colors.  </li>
      <li>Nice colors.</li>
      <li>perfect for sheer overlay or worn to work and for play.  </li>
      <li>That was my fault though, as I probably should have read more about it.</li>
      <li>that being said, I still LOVE this pallet.</li>
      <li>Love this shadow palatte</li>
      <li>I think this would be a great starter eye shadow pallet, especially for someone who does not already have a huge makeup collection.</li>
      <li>It applies smoothly and lasts.</li>
      <li>Very nice, I could not find this in any of my local stores.</li>
      <li>Ladies you will love this eyeshadow as it mimics a higher end nude shadow palette.</li>
      <li>Nice and shimmery, and inexpensive as far as eyeshadow goes.</li>
      <li>The set had a nice selection of colors for the natural tone look.  </li>
      <li>The colors are beautiful if you can manage to get them on your brush, I seem to be having to force mine a little bit.</li>
      <li>I wanted to love this product, the formula is what drew me to it as i have sensitive skin on my eyes.</li>
      <li>Colors were as expected, goes on very nicely and in a nice case to travel with since it is small.</li>
      <li>Love the different shades and the price!</li>
      <li>I have watched a lot of Beauty Gurus on YouTube using the real Naked pallet, and I do not think you can get anywhere near those colors or looks with this Physician&#x27;s Formula pallet, so don&#x27;t buy this if you already have a huge collection of natural-toned eyeshadow</li>
      <li>I just wish the strips weren&#x27;t so narrow, with more makeup.</li>
      <li>I use it pretty much daily.</li>
      <li>and you are expecting to get the exact same colors or looks of a higher-end product for a lower price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I have sensitive eyes but doesn&#x27;t seem to irritate at all.</li>
      <li>It has enough colors that it is the only eye shadow pallet I really ever need in my makeup collection.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not a fan of the little sponge that comes with it, there is no way to get it clean without getting it wet, which doesn&#x27;t help when using multiple colors.</li>

<li> i wasn&#x27;t crazy about the brush that was included.</li>
<li> I like this eyeshadow, though it is very difficult to apply using the included wand.</li>

    <li> I bought this pallet from Walmart last year because I heard it was a &amp;#34;dupe&amp;#34; for the Naked pallet. I have watched a lot of Beauty Gurus on YouTube using the real Naked pallet, and I do not think you can get anywhere near those colors or looks with this Physician&#x27;s Formula pallet, so don&#x27;t buy this if you already have a huge collection of natural-toned eyeshadow and you are expecting to get the exact same colors or looks of a higher-end product for a lower price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With that being said, I still LOVE this pallet. The eye shadow is great quality, and does not crease on my eyelids. It has enough colors that it is the only eye shadow pallet I really ever need in my makeup collection. I have had it for a very long time, and yet I still have not &amp;#34;hit pan&amp;#34; with it. I think this would be a great starter eye shadow pallet, especially for someone who does not already have a huge makeup collection.</li>
    <li> The colors are beautiful if you can manage to get them on your brush, I seem to be having to force mine a little bit.</li>
    <li> Great colors that don&#x27;t smudge</li>
    <li> Nice colors. A little hard to get enough powder to really show up, but no biggie. I have had compliments.</li>
    <li> This is probably the best neutral eye palette I have used. Nice and shimmery, and inexpensive as far as eyeshadow goes. It applies smoothly and lasts.</li>
    <li> Colors were as expected, goes on very nicely and in a nice case to travel with since it is small.</li>
    <li> Nice colors.  They go on well.  Wet them for deeer shades.</li>
    <li> I like this eyeshadow, though it is very difficult to apply using the included wand.</li>
    <li> This palette arrived on time. Although, I was expecting it to be a LOT larger. That was my fault though, as I probably should have read more about it. The length is like smaller than the length from the tip of my finger to the palm of my hand. Nevertheless, I&#x27;m very happy with the colors included and the palette has proved to be very useful.</li>
    <li> The fact that all the colors are so small and close together makes it hard to apply one color at a time, must be for sample purposes.</li>
    <li> The set had a nice selection of colors for the natural tone look.  i wasn&#x27;t crazy about the brush that was included.</li>
    <li> I adore this eye shadow palette. The case is adorable--black lace over a nude solid fabric. This is my go-to eye shadow and it is always in my purse now. I use it pretty much daily.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t leave comments.</li>
    <li> Very nice, I could not find this in any of my local stores. Ladies you will love this eyeshadow as it mimics a higher end nude shadow palette.</li>
    <li> perfect for sheer overlay or worn to work and for play.  Love this shadow palatte</li>

    <li> I just wish the strips weren&#x27;t so narrow, with more makeup.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m just loving this shadow and liner! Just love the way it enhances my eyes! Just beautiful! First time I have tired Physicians Formula!!</li>
    <li> Love the different shades and the price! I have sensitive eyes but doesn&#x27;t seem to irritate at all.</li>
    <li> I like the colors and texture of this product.</li>
    <li> I wanted to love this product, the formula is what drew me to it as i have sensitive skin on my eyes. But the small size of the color pallets and and how close together they are with no separation makes it impossible to use blending brushes without picking up the other colors. I&#x27;m not a fan of the little sponge that comes with it, there is no way to get it clean without getting it wet, which doesn&#x27;t help when using multiple colors. I&#x27;m sad, as I love the concept of the company and the colors offered but I just can&#x27;t use them. I wish I hadn&#x27;t already opened all the boxes or I would return the unused ones.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve purchased this product before and the colors are different than in store, I recommend heading to the store on this one</li>
