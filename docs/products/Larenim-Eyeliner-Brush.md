      <li>good quality for the price.</li>
      <li>I tried it out and it applied my gel liner very smoothly.</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
      <li>I love this eyeliner brush, and use it with Fran Wilson cake liner.  </li>
      <li>It looks more like a brush that would come in a kids painting kit.</li>
      <li>It seems to be of good quality and they shipped it very fast</li>
      <li>I find the long length to be perfect.</li>
      <li>and maybe it would make it more sturdy and precise</li>
      <li>(Yes, you might be thinking why don&#x27;t I just use liquid liner instead of gel, however I feel like liquid liners don&#x27;t stay put on my eyes and smears too easily when used alone)</li>
      <li>I could have gone out shopping at a store and gotten one comparable, but this was so easy to order from home.</li>
      <li>Smooth lines, and durable</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s hard to find a good eyeliner brush for cake eyeliner, but this is good.  </li>
      <li>Draws a perfect, thin line and takes a lot less time to perfect.  </li>
      <li>The brush is very soft and easy to clean</li>
      <li>to do the job right, you have to have the right tools.</li>
      <li>Also, it has a nice long handle, so it doesn&#x27;t get lost in my makeup brush holder.</li>
      <li>Was surprised to find it runs smooth with the cake eyeliner.  </li>
      <li>Was not nearly thin enough for what I was looking for and did not draw a very accurate line.</li>
      <li>Larenim Eyeliner Brush -purchased because it was listed as vegan-looks and feels sturdy and very soft-I will try and update after first time use, hopefully it will work well</li>
      <li>Very fine point when wet and holds the shape during application.  </li>
      <li>If you want to use this eyeliner brush to draw a FINE line above your lashes, this brush will not do the job well.  </li>
      <li>The brush is fine enough to get away with this, but I&#x27;d still like a real point on the brush.  </li>
      <li>Hard to find good eyeliner brushes.</li>
      <li>It could be a lot better not as expected.</li>
      <li>I had got this eyeliner brush for my sister to apply gel liner and it is works really well.</li>
      <li>I guess the old saying is right....</li>
      <li>To get a perfectly straight line, I would expect a brush that felt like it had a little more substance.  </li>
      <li>The handle has a decent length as well which is a plus.</li>
      <li>This brush is thin and precise; I had no problems with the application and got a very clean line.</li>
      <li>I am so glad that I purchased this little gem.  </li>
      <li>and I am always looking for new brushes to do the job.  </li>
      <li>Not stiff enough.&lt;br</li>
      <li>along\\&quot; with an old lip liner brush with my eyeliner for years</li>
      <li>Soft brush that applies evenly.</li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t found any product to beat it, because I like a nice thin line.</li>
      <li>The bristles are dense enough to be stury enough to deliver a nice defined line, but thin enough to be able to make a thin line.</li>
      <li>I buy a new eyeliner brush at least once a month because you can&#x27;t get a nice thin line anymore once the brush is spread out and tufty.</li>

<li> Soft brush that applies evenly.</li>
<li> I haven&#x27;t found any product to beat it, because I like a nice thin line.</li>

<li> I started wearing makeup a long time ago, and cake eyeliner was the thing then.  </li>
<li> YES the bristles are long, but I like it.</li>
<li> Some of my eyeliner brushes are too thick, so you would think that too much product would get on - but somehow when applied to my eyes, it just doesn&#x27;t apply smoothly or dark enough.</li>
<li> I use it both for wet eyeliner or dry.  </li>
<li> It should&#x27;ve been a bit less big</li>
<li> This one has lasted 3 times as long as any other I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s possible that the &amp;#34;hairs&amp;#34; are just a little long for me, so I may end up cut them a little shorter.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve used other brushes with longer bristles, which bent making it harder to control.</li>
<li> The handle is WAY too long, the bristles too thick, not tapered, and it is definitely not what I wanted.  </li>
<li> helps me make a finer line than other brushes.</li>
<li> I should have read the reviews before I wasted my money.</li>
<li> So far, my favorites are still Mac 210 (expensive) and Sonia Kashuk 05 (inexpensive).</li>
<li> I like this brush, but it is a little stiff</li>
<li> My only disappointment with this brush is that the point is not really a point.  </li>
<li> The brush is too thick and the tip is not well tapered.</li>
<li> The bristles fray and start to bend out when trying to make a thin line.</li>
<li> Because it&#x27;s thin, you can make a line any thickness you want (by going over the area), which gives you a lot of control.  </li>
<li> LIKE I SAID IT IS VERY THIN.</li>
<li> and it just wasn&#x27;t cutting it for me.  </li>

    <li> Does not work well for eyeliner.</li>

    <li> YES the bristles are long, but I like it. helps me make a finer line than other brushes. definitely recommend this.</li>
    <li> I like this brush, but it is a little stiff and I&#x27;m hoping with use it will soften up a bit. It seems to be of good quality and they shipped it very fast and it was packaged well.</li>
    <li> My only disappointment with this brush is that the point is not really a point.  The brush is fine enough to get away with this, but I&#x27;d still like a real point on the brush.  Call me a perfectionist!</li>
    <li> The eyeliner brush is fairly priced for a quality product. Hard to find good eyeliner brushes. Soft brush that applies evenly.</li>
    <li> The bristles fray and start to bend out when trying to make a thin line. It looks more like a brush that would come in a kids painting kit.</li>

    <li> I buy a new eyeliner brush at least once a month because you can&#x27;t get a nice thin line anymore once the brush is spread out and tufty. This one has lasted 3 times as long as any other I&#x27;ve tried. I won&#x27;t be trying any others- this one is it for me!</li>
    <li> I like this eyeliner brush alot.  I could have gone out shopping at a store and gotten one comparable, but this was so easy to order from home.</li>
    <li> Too flimsy. Not stiff enough.&lt;br /&gt;My sister ordered this using my account, and this is what she has told me.</li>
    <li> This brush isn&#x27;t what I was looking for, and I&#x27;ve thrown it away.  The handle is WAY too long, the bristles too thick, not tapered, and it is definitely not what I wanted.  I should have read the reviews before I wasted my money.</li>
    <li> Larenim Eyeliner Brush -purchased because it was listed as vegan-looks and feels sturdy and very soft-I will try and update after first time use, hopefully it will work well and if so I will definitely order more.great value and timely shippment</li>
    <li> If you want to use this eyeliner brush to draw a FINE line above your lashes, this brush will not do the job well.  The brush is too thick and the tip is not well tapered. I have used eyeliners (liquid, cream, cake, and gel) for years and I am always looking for new brushes to do the job.  So far, my favorites are still Mac 210 (expensive) and Sonia Kashuk 05 (inexpensive).</li>
    <li> Smooth lines, and durable</li>
    <li> It did not work as well as I thought with  cake eyeliner</li>
    <li> I stumbled across this brush on accident and I&#x27;m glad I did. The price was great too as I got it under $5. Some of my eyeliner brushes are too thick, so you would think that too much product would get on - but somehow when applied to my eyes, it just doesn&#x27;t apply smoothly or dark enough. This brush is thin and precise; I had no problems with the application and got a very clean line. Maybe I can now get away with just using gel liner and not bother with lining over the eyes again with a liquid liner! (Yes, you might be thinking why don&#x27;t I just use liquid liner instead of gel, however I feel like liquid liners don&#x27;t stay put on my eyes and smears too easily when used alone) The handle has a decent length as well which is a plus.</li>
    <li> I am so glad that I purchased this little gem.  I \\&quot;limped along\\&quot; with an old lip liner brush with my eyeliner for years and it just wasn&#x27;t cutting it for me.  This brush is PERFECT.  Draws a perfect, thin line and takes a lot less time to perfect.  I guess the old saying is right....to do the job right, you have to have the right tools.</li>
    <li> I had got this eyeliner brush for my sister to apply gel liner and it is works really well. I tried it out and it applied my gel liner very smoothly. The brush is very soft and easy to clean</li>
    <li> good quality for the price. was looking for something with a shorter brush length than this one, but it works well regardless.</li>
    <li> It could be a lot better not as expected. It should&#x27;ve been a bit less big and maybe it would make it more sturdy and precise</li>
    <li> HAVE NOT USED IT YET, BUT HOPE IT WILL BE WHAT I WANT.  LIKE I SAID IT IS VERY THIN.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s hard to find a good eyeliner brush for cake eyeliner, but this is good.  I started wearing makeup a long time ago, and cake eyeliner was the thing then.  I haven&#x27;t found any product to beat it, because I like a nice thin line.</li>
