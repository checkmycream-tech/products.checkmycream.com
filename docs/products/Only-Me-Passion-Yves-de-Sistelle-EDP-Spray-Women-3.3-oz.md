<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I think my idea of fruity is different than others. It smelt a tiny bit sweet, but definitely not fruity at all. Floral perfumes give me a headache which is why I was looking for something fruity, but sadly, I am writing this review with the beginings of a headache. Also, I know this was pretty cheap, and you can totally tell! I smell a little like a hooker. Sorry to those who love this perfume and get compliments, but I do not like this one and will be asking Amazon if I can return it even though it&#x27;s opened. Again, I apologize if I offended anyone by my last comment.</li>
    <li> Smells ok but do not last long.</li>
    <li> I buy for my daughter for the second time and she is in love with perfume. Arrived earlier than expected. Very good packaging. I would order it again.</li>
    <li> I love this perfume so much. It&#x27;s light and fruity but not sickeningly sweet. I love it so much that I put it on when I&#x27;m at home in my pajamas just for the sake of smelling it. The fact that it&#x27;s insanely cheap is a huge bonus. I&#x27;ll be wearing this for a long time.</li>
    <li> Awesome perfume.  I have been using it for over three years now. Try it you will not regret it ever.</li>
    <li> My friends at work say how good I smell. One of the girls constantly tells me she wants to eat me... I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s the perfume!</li>
    <li> I have recently tried a few new perfumes and this one is my favorite. It has a citrus scent and it&#x27;s not too overwhelming. I prefer to wear it during the day.</li>
    <li> This product arrived within 2 days even though it wasnt 2 day shipping. was 3 times less than the hut at the mall wanted to charge me and was packaged perfectly. perfect condition shipped super quick and smells absolutely fantastic. you will not find this product in the stores for this price so go try the perfume in the store see if you like it then buy it here on amazon. screw you \\&quot;world of perfume\\&quot; hut in the mall!! i could buy three bottles for youre price!</li>
    <li> Bottom line... Women and men have completely different preferences when it comes to smells.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The most popular and highest price&#x27;d women&#x27;s perfumes SMELL LIKE CRAP to 99% of guys ladies. 99% of guys like SWEET smells (watermelon, apples, etc). Ladies -- do not trust your own noses, unless you are married and could care less what guys think! :-)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This perfume is basically &#x27;liquid man magnet&#x27; in a bottle.</li>
    <li> I love this perfume! My boyfriend bought this for me in a mall &amp; paid about three or four times the price for this same exact item.</li>
    <li> It took a couple of weeks for the perfume to get here, but I was happy when it did! Nothing was wrong with the package or the box that the perfume came in, there was bubble wrap to ensure no breakage which was very nice of them to do. The fragrance smells very strong and fruity so you have to be careful if strong perfumes give you headaches.</li>
    <li> Awsome!!!&lt;br /&gt;I really love this perfume its the best purchase ever!&lt;br /&gt;I love the scent!&lt;br /&gt;I buy it for ever!!! :) thks!!!</li>
    <li> Glad i found this on here for under $20, especially since its $40 at perfume stores, love the fruity smell</li>
    <li> Do you want to bring the men to the yard?&lt;br /&gt;Well let me tell you you will be beating them down with a stick.&lt;br /&gt;All I can say is I purchased this for my girlfriend for Christmas and it swept me away as if I had jumped into my own Music Video Named Candy land. When you want to be exotic, fun, this is the fragrance for you!!&lt;br /&gt;So I purchased this for my girlfriend and was telling her is she didn&#x27;t like it I will get her another one and keep that one( Hint)&lt;br /&gt;She didn&#x27;t buy into that because she loves it!! So I got one for myself.&lt;br /&gt;The Scent of a woman is like no other especially when you find the right one:)</li>
    <li> I bought this perfume at swap shop in Miami while on vacation. Once I ran out I hit up Amazon to see if they had it. I love this perfume, smells yummy.</li>
    <li> My girlfriend loves this perfume. I couldn&#x27;t have picked a better one.</li>
    <li> It is nice soft scent and it stays that is what I like</li>
    <li> Reminds me of Chanel Chance...soft and fruity.  I only wear Only Me, Chanel Chance, and a very inexpensive body oil named Egyptian Musk.  This fragrance is for the lady who doesn&#x27;t want to trigger someone&#x27;s allergies.</li>
    <li> Love it. Will be back for more! The scent is so nice. And for the price, the is a great deal.</li>
    <li> Very nice smell. However it doesn&#x27;t last very long so I have to reapply it throughout the day. Would recommend though.</li>
    <li> This was a blind buy.I had heard rave reviews on it an decided to give it a shot.It diddnt fail to impress! First day I wore it I had random people telling me I smelled so good!Its super fruity an somewhat floral.Its a delecious smelling fragrance.Everyone loves this scent.Its  great price, an great product all around.plus, the packaging an bottle is sooo pretty!</li>
    <li> Smells like cheap perfume.</li>
    <li> If you are looking for a perfume that will turn heads then you need to purchase Only Me!  I can hardly ever go anywhere without receiving or overhearing a comment about how good I smell.  I have never gotten that reaction from any cologne or spray.  I can guarantee that this fragrance will fit ANYONE&#x27;S preference!  I wish I could give it 10 stars!</li>
    <li> I bought this at a mall kiosk for MUCH much more. But I would do it all over again because this is the most amazing smelling perfume I&#x27;ve ever owned. A man on here made the comment that it&#x27;s &amp;#34;liquid man magnet&amp;#34; that&#x27;s no lie. This stuff drives my man insane... the smell also lasts all day long unlike a lot of other perfumes Ive tried. Plan to stock up in fear that it will disappear some day.</li>
    <li> My cousin &amp; I work at the same job, she walked past me one day wearing this fragrance and I knew I had to have it. It smells great light &amp; fruity. The price was fantastic. I would recommend this to any one who likes fruity &amp; floral smells.</li>
    <li> I purchased this fragrance and frankly it has a smell that I personally can not abide. I&#x27;ve no doubt others find it pleasant, I dont.  I tried to return it and found out that I can not return it!  Something about hazardous material.  Had I known that I would not have bought it.  I don&#x27;t recall reading anywhere that it could not be returned, but I guarantee I would have thought twice before my purchase had I been made aware of that fact.  Now I have something that I do not want, but can&#x27;t return it. I will add the smell is not bad, just not for me.  Good thing it doesn&#x27;t cost much.</li>
    <li> Smells great . Will purchase more</li>
    <li> Love the product/scent, wish there was a way to get more of it out of the bottle w/o waste.</li>
    <li> I have fond memories behind this perfume. GREAT PRICE for a GREAT PERFUME</li>
    <li> One of my favorites I truly love it</li>
    <li> After falling in love with the scent of this perfume, I just had to purchase it. Whereas many perfumes smell floral-y and mature, this reminds me of being a child again. It&#x27;s very sweet, candy-like, and playful. This fragrance is also great because it&#x27;s inexpensive. If you shop around, you could get a 3.3 oz bottle for nearly $20, which is great seeing that an 0.8 oz bottle of Angel by Thierry Mugler goes for $70. So if you&#x27;re on a tight budget and looking for a satisfying scent, this is the one. I definitely will keep purchasing.</li>
    <li> This perfume reminds me of one of Escada perfumes (can&#x27;t name exactly), very sweet and delicious scents. Two thumbs up for nice sweet smell, but it only lasts for 10 minutes. I wish it lasts longer but I can&#x27;t complain much since I only paid for $14.&lt;br /&gt;The bottle looks really nice and it is made in France.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this smell of this! I saw it in the mall but it cost way too much, like $30 for the bottle I think it was. I got this and another bottle for the same price! Love them both.</li>
    <li> I love this perfume for all that was said previously. It&#x27;s a deliciously light and sweet scent, of flowers and fruits, soft scent, so perfect now for spring time and summer, it&#x27;s a must wear. I love flowers and sunny days, this perfume was made for me. It was sent to me as a gift, and I&#x27;m totally happy with it, from the first moment, I loved it! I will be looking forward to buying many more perfumes such as this one, but for now, it&#x27;s a huge fave of mine. The passion fruit scent with a hint of lavender.. it&#x27;s absolutely dreamy..</li>
    <li> Smells awesome and came quickly!</li>
    <li> I simply adore this perfume. Each and everytime I wear it I get so many compliments especially by men. Make sure you don&#x27;t make the mistake of leaving it an extremely high temperatures or in the sunlight because it does change the smell. I&#x27;ve had to order it numerous times because of that.</li>
    <li> This fragrance is lovely--sweet and floral and not too strong. I get tons of compliments on it--one coworker said I &amp;#34;smelled like a ray of sunshine&amp;#34;. Not sure what that means, but I&#x27;ll take it.</li>
    <li> pERFECT. i LOVE YOUR PROMPT SERVICE.  THANK YOU AGAIN.</li>
    <li> Very pleased with the order&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great value, excellent Perfume for day use. Shipping was fast, over all great experience.&lt;br /&gt;I will order more and recommend it to friends!</li>
    <li> I bought this perfume because of the good reviews, so I decided to try it, and boy it did not disappoint. I am a sweet perfume scent kind of girl, so this perfume is right up my alley. The perfume is a very sweet scent, it is all about flowers and fruits. SO there are Jasmine, rose, passion fruit and hint of lavender. The passion fruit scent is what you smell most wearing this perfume, so if you not into passion fruit this scent might not be for you. I get so many compliments everytime I wear this perfume, so it is a keeper for me. The scent only last for about 5 hours. SO if you are into sweet scent I say get it, you will not regret it.</li>
    <li> i like this scent it different not to much but not to little either i wish i came in a bigger bottle thought :))</li>
    <li> If I had to describe this scent, I would say sweet. This fragrance is for someone in their teens/early 20&amp;#34;s. Not a fan,but I guess that&#x27;s what I get for ordering perfume online. If you like the smell of cotton candy,you&#x27;ll like this perfume. I like the smell of cotton candy, but not on my body :)</li>
    <li> is excelent... good quality, nice desing, and perfect present, thanks so much</li>
    <li> Nice price fruity smell great for collection</li>
    <li> Has a really nice fruity/ floral type scent!! Worth buying. I have found however, that the scent does not last very long after you put it on... That is my only complaint.</li>
    <li> My wife loved the feminine scent. Unfortunately the fragrance does not last long on her skin. The price is so low that it&#x27;s not a problem - she just resprays after a few hours. My young daughters also love the smell.</li>
    <li> I picked up a barely used bottle of this at a garage sale....An older man outside of town has a summer long garage sale. I go all the time ! He get&#x27;s items from storage units and sells them......and yeah. I took a wif of this and was like OMG!!!! It smells delicious. I get so many compliments when I wear it ! For a while I didn&#x27;t even know the name. I would just tell people I picked it up from a garage sale hahaha. Then I thought damn I need to try and find this online so I can buy more ! I became familiar with the name. It sounds super cheesy but this is one of my all time fav scents.</li>
    <li> I love fruity scents and this is definitely a sweet smelling perfume :) I apply it at 9 am and have to reapply at 12 pm, but I&#x27;m fine with that. I was going to buy this at Fragrance Outlet but they were selling it for $40+, so I bought it on Amazon for about $20.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite.  Not too floral and not over powering like some perfumes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely one I would get again.</li>
    <li> I have heard this more than a few times!  Not a day goes by that I don&#x27;t get complimented for this fragrance - and you can&#x27;t beat the price.  Seller got it to me super fast too!</li>
    <li> This makes a great gift for the wife or girlfriend. I love the scent of this perfume on my wife, it makes her smell divine.</li>
    <li> Girlfriend absolutely loves it. The other reviews mentioning that it wears off sooner than expected are spot on. This favors more of a summer/spring dinner date use.</li>
    <li> I was in the mall today and bought this perfume for about 15 minutes. I will tell you why. I went into a store looking for Ralph Rocks. Apparently it is no longer being made. The woman showed me this perfume and it reminded me so much of it. I fell in love. She showed me other fragrances as well. I ended up purchasing all four for $258.00. She told me this perfume would typically cost $89. Well I got into my car and immediately look for this fragrance and found it here on Amazon for $19.00. I then looked up all the other ones and the same purchase would have cost around $80 for all four bottles.  Long story short I took the pefume back and exchanged them all for Be Delicious, Black, and Brittney Spears. I knew how much they normally cost so I knew that was the only way to compensate for that since they do not do returns only exchanges. Now I only overpaid by $60. Which is a lot easier to swallow than $200.  I am not usually a sucker but I definetly got duped today. Anyway, when I got home the second time, I came immediately in my office and purchased the perfume. It smells AWESOME!!! AND I love it even more knowing I can get it here for only $19. It is a super fresh light scent that smells amazing. I cannot wait for it to arrive.</li>
    <li> This is a sweet, feminine scent that I smelled originally at a friend&#x27;s house. From the bottle (size, style, scent) I expected it to be at least $40-$60, so imagine my great surprise to find it on here around $13! For 3.4oz nonetheless! While perfumes and scents can&#x27;t really be reviewed like a functional item, I can only say if you like sweeter floral scents with a bit of spice on the end go for it! ONE DOWNFALL: I do feel like it wears off after a few hours, though the scent on my clothes will last for days so maybe my nose just gets used to it.</li>
