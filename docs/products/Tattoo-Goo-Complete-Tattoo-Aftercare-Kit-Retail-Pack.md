      <li>I&#x27;m very sensitive to products and this one was perfect.</li>
      <li>Love the smell.</li>
      <li>The Tattoo Goo lotion was even more of a joke.</li>
      <li>came across this entire kit, and decided the price was great!</li>
      <li>My favorite was the circular cream</li>
      <li>and I still love the design.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>ok,</li>
      <li>Aquaphor was/is much better for the skin/scab relief.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One side note, don&#x27;t expect the balm to disappear into your skin, it is more of an ointment, like A&amp;D ointment or chapstick, it moisturizes but also protects by making a layer on your skin.</li>
      <li>Love it.</li>
      <li>the start of transaction to delivery it was smooth sailing!</li>
      <li>Love the spf stick. :)</li>
      <li>So I knew I wanted more of that.</li>
      <li>The antibacterial soap is a must have for new tattoo the after crime to perfect for keeping your tats in perfect condition in color or black.</li>
      <li>From what I can tell the best thing is simply what works to keep the tattoo clean, moisturized and away from the sun without making you breakout in a rash.  </li>
      <li>The salve also is awesome for other injuries.</li>
      <li>lotion is nice too, not fancy, but also doesn&#x27;t cause me to break out which is nice with my sensitive skin.  </li>
      <li>It works tremendously!</li>
      <li>This product helped my tattoo to heal very fast!!  </li>
      <li>It helps with the color, and it not oily but really light.  </li>
      <li>The pic had a nice travel bag which would have made it much easier to store &amp; put in bag &amp; go.</li>
      <li>It is made with natural products, smells nice (mostly like rosemary), and is convenient to carry around.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>(it is the smell of the sunscreen chemical, not this particular brand), but I have used it in a pinch and it goes on nicely.  </li>
      <li>specially the fist week of the tattoo.</li>
      <li>The price is right!</li>
      <li>It sits on top of your skin, and leaves a very oily surface.</li>
      <li>, I have also done extensive searching online at various tattoo shops and websites trying to determine what works best.  </li>
      <li>though it took some time ACM was quick to respond to my issues, and once they figured out the issue, they apologized and got my stuff to me quickly.</li>
      <li>anti-bacterial soap smells like what they use in a hospital, it is good enough soap and seems gentle on my skin.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Everything is useful in this package.</li>
      <li>Wow love this stuff</li>
      <li>This is my official favorite thing to use on new and old tattoos!!!!</li>
      <li>Thank you very much.  </li>
      <li>I bought this after I got my first tattoo.</li>
      <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One side note, don&#x27;t expect the balm to disappear into your skin, it is more of an ointment, like A&amp;D ointment or chapstick, it moisturizes but also protects by making a layer on your skin.y issues with this kit or any of the individual products nor has anyone else I know who has used them.  </li>
      <li>I love this product, I used it for my first tattoo, but not for my second (which I regret)</li>
      <li>When I got my first tattoo they gave a a tin of the salve.</li>
      <li>You do need to apply it several times a day (3-6), but I find that to be the case with most lotions</li>
      <li>I like being able to take care of my new tattoo and my old ones.</li>
      <li>I have a full arm sleeve with TONS of color, and a full shoulder back piece as well.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t think you need to buy the whole kit necessarily, but I highly recommend buying at least the balm, it is wonderful and worth the price of the kit alone.  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t think you need to buy the whole kit necessarily, but I highly recommend buying at least the balm, it is wonderful and worth the price of the kit alone.  </li>
      <li>I highly recommend this product to anyone that wants to keep their tattoos looking fresh.</li>
      <li>pure curiosity).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>My colors look so vibrant!</li>
      <li>I am gonna have to go and get the whole tat redone.</li>
      <li>I had no scabbing and it made the healing process fast and painless.</li>
      <li>this stuff worked really well for the aftercare of all my tattoos.  </li>
      <li>It really pulled the colors out of my tattoos.</li>
      <li>had this kit the whole time.</li>
      <li>It kept the color in my tattoos very well as well.</li>
      <li>The canister of Tattoo Goo balm was very oily, and doesn&#x27;t seem to penetrate the skin.</li>
      <li>and it really depends on what body part</li>
      <li>It reminded me of the cheap no-name brand lotions you find at your local drug store.</li>
      <li>Ask your tattoo professional what they recommend, and I&#x27;m sure they&#x27;ll agree with what I had to say above.</li>
      <li>this is personally the only thing i suggest you put on your tattoos as it carries a full line of products in one pack for all your needs a year later my tattoos are as good as new thanks</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s water based, which is very cool (no greasy feeling), but it seemed to be TOO watery, ad didn&#x27;t really penetrate the skin or ease the dry scab areas.</li>
      <li>Right now I&#x27;m using it on old tattoos &amp; I</li>
      <li>If you have a new tattoo this product is a must buy!</li>
      <li>The lightly scabbed areas of my tattoo sleeve remained dry, and I found myself just washing the goo off in fear that the skin would crack.</li>
      <li>The product came EARLY!!</li>
      <li>The Dial soap bar worked much better, and got the dead skin and plasma off like it</li>
      <li>After I got my second one 2 weeks later I was so glad to have this because me and my friends who got tattoos together used it frequently.</li>
      <li>, I emailed the seller, and despite it being Christmas Eve, they got back to me right away.  </li>
      <li>It works and helps with the drying out and itching of new tattoos.  </li>
      <li>I have seen improvements in my old tattoos as well as the new one I just got!</li>
      <li>I love the way my tats looks after using just a little of product!</li>
      <li>Stick to the high-quality lubriderm which will for sure penetrate the skin, and keep the lightly scabbed areas soft enough to not crack, but tame enough to not stop the healing process.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Ok, I figure perhaps the seller is shipping the other items at a later date.  </li>
      <li>However, there was some mix up, they originally told me that I only ordered the one item from them and the other items were ordered from another seller.  </li>
      <li>Anyway when I first used the soap it had been almost two weeks into healing and the first time I used it all the scabby crap off the top of the skin brushed right off</li>
      <li>I use the deep cleansing soap on my tat once daily then use the lotion as much as i need.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve had ink put on my entire arm that took nearly a year to complete...</li>
      <li>People complain on reviews that it doesn&#x27;t foam up, well not all soap foams especially when it is made with allot of natural ingredients like tattoo goo is.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> We have used this product with each and every tattoo we have gotten. It helps to keep the skin moisturized during the healing process. I highly recommend this product to anyone that wants to keep their tattoos looking fresh.</li>
    <li> I love Tattoo goo! When I got my first tattoo they gave a a tin of the salve. So I knew I wanted more of that. The salve also is awesome for other injuries. I just burnt myself cooking and used the salve on it and it helped allot. Both the salve and the lotion work great to stop the itching and seem to keep my skin moisturized. The soap is awesome! People complain on reviews that it doesn&#x27;t foam up, well not all soap foams especially when it is made with allot of natural ingredients like tattoo goo is. Anyway when I first used the soap it had been almost two weeks into healing and the first time I used it all the scabby crap off the top of the skin brushed right off it was so nice!&lt;br /&gt;I am never using anything else but tattoo goo! And am keeping some extra salve around for burns.</li>
    <li> I bought this kit for my previous tattoo and I just recently bought some of the balm again for my current tattoo as well as giving these gifts as kits to friends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Each one of my tattoos has come with different after-care instructions, from different shops, one even provided a small cup of the goo they preferred, I have also done extensive searching online at various tattoo shops and websites trying to determine what works best.  From what I can tell the best thing is simply what works to keep the tattoo clean, moisturized and away from the sun without making you breakout in a rash.  Since everyone has different skin, allergies, and sensitivities it is hard to find consistent information.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Personally I have tried a variety of lotions and soaps with varied results, but I LOVE the Tattoo Goo balm (the small tin of green goo).  It is made with natural products, smells nice (mostly like rosemary), and is convenient to carry around.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The anti-bacterial soap smells like what they use in a hospital, it is good enough soap and seems gentle on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The lotion is nice too, not fancy, but also doesn&#x27;t cause me to break out which is nice with my sensitive skin.  You do need to apply it several times a day (3-6), but I find that to be the case with most lotions and it really depends on what body part it is used on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tend not to use the sunscreen stick as most sunscreen makes me ill (it is the smell of the sunscreen chemical, not this particular brand), but I have used it in a pinch and it goes on nicely.  I do like the fact that I don&#x27;t need to touch any sunscreen in order to protect my tattoo.  I have since found zinc oxide based sunscreen that comes in a tube like this as well and I still love the design.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Best of all, if you lose your aftercare directions, or for some reason you never got any, this kit has some printed inside as a reminder of how to use their products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the end I have never had any issues with this kit or any of the individual products nor has anyone else I know who has used them.  I don&#x27;t think you need to buy the whole kit necessarily, but I highly recommend buying at least the balm, it is wonderful and worth the price of the kit alone.  I have used it throughout the healing process and after as it keeps my skin moist and makes my tattoos look great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One side note, don&#x27;t expect the balm to disappear into your skin, it is more of an ointment, like A&amp;D ointment or chapstick, it moisturizes but also protects by making a layer on your skin.y issues with this kit or any of the individual products nor has anyone else I know who has used them.

    <li> Tattoo Goo is awesome and this set was great!  Thank you very much.  It has everything anyone would need to properly care for his/her tattoo.</li>
    <li> After paying a lot for my 1/2 sleeve tattoo, I wanted to protect it from fading if and when it gets sun exposure!&lt;br /&gt;I came across this entire kit, and decided the price was great! Even though I only wanted the stick sunblock I know I will be adding to my 1/2 sleeve tat, so I will use the other products in the near future.&lt;br /&gt;From the start of transaction to delivery it was smooth sailing! And I was totally pleased when I opened my mailbox to see my order within a day! I will be a returning customer!&lt;br /&gt;AAAAA ++++++</li>
    <li> I purchased this product the same day I got my tattoo and it can two days later. I had no scabbing and it made the healing process fast and painless. It is awesome! I did not use the soap, but I used the lotion and the circular tattoo goo. My favorite was the circular cream specially the fist week of the tattoo.</li>
    <li> I like being able to take care of my new tattoo and my old ones. Everything is useful in this package.</li>
    <li> Just buy the Goo, it&#x27;s the best! The lotion works well but the Goo is the big product in this pouch.</li>
    <li> I would surely recommend these products to anyone who is considering getting a tattoo! I use the deep cleansing soap on my tat once daily then use the lotion as much as i need. My colors look so vibrant!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always used this product for all my tats. It&#x27;s great and rally works. Lasts forever too. The price is right!</li>
    <li> This single kit will last forever...if used properly, it&#x27;ll last about a year with it being used near daily.  I&#x27;ve had ink put on my entire arm that took nearly a year to complete...had this kit the whole time.</li>
    <li> This is the best stuff to use keeps color bright &amp;the sunscreen color block is awsomeworks very well on dark skin</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Tattoo Goo with all of my ink and have never had an issue.  I decided to try the kit and have been very happy with it.  The one thing I&#x27;d like to point out is mine came in a box, not with a reusable bag like the image shows.</li>
    <li> Love it. Great product and a good deal. I&#x27;ll keep shopping with them again</li>
    <li> Awesome kit. works wonderful</li>
    <li> I bought this after I got my first tattoo. After I got my second one 2 weeks later I was so glad to have this because me and my friends who got tattoos together used it frequently. I thought that maybe my husband would like the sunscreen as well for his older tattoos since they are in directly sunlight everyday.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t get me wrong, I have no bad experiences with this, but I got this along with something else and definitely like the other stuff better.</li>
    <li> Wow love this stuff my tattoo looks great! Best</li>
    <li> I have used Tattoo Goo products for my last three tattoos.  I like them, they are well priced, work well, and frankly I like the smell of the Tattoo Goo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since I was running out, I decided to just order the package.  One stop shopping.  I paid and was charged...ok, but then I get the package, and all I have is the small pot of Tattoo Goo.  Ok, I figure perhaps the seller is shipping the other items at a later date.  No big deal, but I see no communication in the package.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, I emailed the seller, and despite it being Christmas Eve, they got back to me right away.  However, there was some mix up, they originally told me that I only ordered the one item from them and the other items were ordered from another seller.  I was confused, because I didn&#x27;t find that information anywhere.  After getting in touch with an amazon associate, I was informed that ACM Global is indeed the company I ordered from, and I ordered only from them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, sent another email, and the ACM associate answered immediately on December 26th, they apologized and sent out the rest of my kit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great product, good price, and though it took some time ACM was quick to respond to my issues, and once they figured out the issue, they apologized and got my stuff to me quickly.</li>
    <li> Better than advertized!!!  This product helped my tattoo to heal very fast!!  Love the smell. Also, I received this product promptly.</li>
    <li> I love this product, I used it for my first tattoo, but not for my second (which I regret) but Ill definitely be using this , I don&#x27;t like the new packaging, old one came in a clear plastic resealable bag, now in a cramped little box</li>
    <li> I have a full arm sleeve with TONS of color, and a full shoulder back piece as well. I&#x27;ve always been told to use Aquaphor, Dial antibacterial soap, and Lubriderm throughout the tattoo healing/care process, but I decided to grab this kit to see what it was all about (pure curiosity).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) The canister of Tattoo Goo balm was very oily, and doesn&#x27;t seem to penetrate the skin. It sits on top of your skin, and leaves a very oily surface. The lightly scabbed areas of my tattoo sleeve remained dry, and I found myself just washing the goo off in fear that the skin would crack. Aquaphor was/is much better for the skin/scab relief.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) The Tattoo wash was somewhat of a joke. There was no lather when you worked it into your skin, and you didn&#x27;t have that \\&quot;clean\\&quot; feeling once you were done. The Dial soap bar worked much better, and got the dead skin and plasma off like it should&#x27;ve.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3) The Tattoo Goo lotion was even more of a joke. It&#x27;s water based, which is very cool (no greasy feeling), but it seemed to be TOO watery, ad didn&#x27;t really penetrate the skin or ease the dry scab areas. It reminded me of the cheap no-name brand lotions you find at your local drug store. Stick to the high-quality lubriderm which will for sure penetrate the skin, and keep the lightly scabbed areas soft enough to not crack, but tame enough to not stop the healing process.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4) I haven&#x27;t used the sunscreen stick yet, but I&#x27;m putting my money on it to be just as gimmicky as the other products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, this package (and products for the matter) seem to be a joke. No wonder the shops don&#x27;t carry this stuff. Ask your tattoo professional what they recommend, and I&#x27;m sure they&#x27;ll agree with what I had to say above.</li>
    <li> If you have a new tattoo this product is a must buy! I have seen improvements in my old tattoos as well as the new one I just got! This product speeds the healing process of the tattoo, and makes the ink shine! It is awesome! It works tremendously! God bless the creator of this product! I also think that tattoo shops all across America should offer this product to their customers!</li>
    <li> this is personally the only thing i suggest you put on your tattoos as it carries a full line of products in one pack for all your needs a year later my tattoos are as good as new thanks</li>
    <li> This is my official favorite thing to use on new and old tattoos!!!! It really pulled the colors out of my tattoos. And helped my newest one heal faster</li>
    <li> I absolutely love the tattoo goo! this stuff worked really well for the aftercare of all my tattoos.  The balm was probably the best part of the kit. Its not sticky or icky like using Aquaphor. It kept the color in my tattoos very well as well.</li>
    <li> I use this brand every time I get a tattoo. It arrived on time and in perfect condition. Although the zipper on the bag fell off a week after using it, the rest of the products are great.</li>
    <li> The product came EARLY!! Everything is perfect. Right now I&#x27;m using it on old tattoos &amp; I see the difference. I&#x27;ll be getting a new one within the next few weeks &amp; can&#x27;t wait to use it. The only problem is there was no clear travel bag, all the products came loose. The pic had a nice travel bag which would have made it much easier to store &amp; put in bag &amp; go.</li>
    <li> I have 12 tattoos and keep them beautiful with these products. The salve is awesome for healing new tattoos. The antibacterial soap is a must have for new tattoo the after crime to perfect for keeping your tats in perfect condition in color or black. This kit has everything you need. A must have</li>
    <li> I love the way my tats looks after using just a little of product!.. I yet need to try the healing cream..</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very sensitive to products and this one was perfect. Love the spf stick. :)</li>
    <li> This is a item I always purchase when I get my tattoos. It works and helps with the drying out and itching of new tattoos.  It helps with the color, and it not oily but really light.  I would recommend this than anything else to help with the healing process of the tattoo.  I healed in about a weeks time.</li>
    <li> Do not buy this crap.  It dried my tattoo out and made it fade very bad.  I am gonna have to go and get the whole tat redone.</li>
