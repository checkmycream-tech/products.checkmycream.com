      <li>they are both the perfect color and look very natural.</li>
      <li>It very easy to use and tames those stray brows</li>
      <li>I recommed finding a color that best matches your natural brows, they have a couple options to choose from.  </li>
      <li>Wish there was more pencil and eliminate the highlighter end.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t have to deal with a sharpener - I just twist the handle to get more.</li>
      <li>I love this pencil.  </li>
      <li>I would gladly recommend this product.</li>
      <li>Love this product.</li>
      <li>love the wax, used with eyebrow powder</li>
      <li>This is my favorite &amp;#34;go to&amp;#34; eyebrow tool.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s so natural.i love all the colors.</li>
      <li>I love this</li>
      <li>I have never been able to apply other pencils that looked &amp;#34;real&amp;#34;, and flawless.  </li>
      <li>It stays where you put it and it is easy to remove.</li>
      <li>so it&#x27;s easy to put on.</li>
      <li>Overall great product.</li>
      <li>The trick is to use light sweeping strokes, not to press hard and try to draw a perfect line.  </li>
      <li>but I quickly lost it.</li>
      <li>If you do sweeping strokes it gradually blends into your brows and looks more natural.  </li>
      <li>This looks the most natural on my brows.</li>
      <li>This might work for somebody who has truly golden eyebrows, but it didn&#x27;t work for me.  </li>
      <li>Not all &amp;#34;blonde&amp;#34; shades are alike and this is the right shade for me.</li>
      <li>think it is the &amp;#34;wax&amp;#34; product that makes it easy to apply and creates very natural looking brows.  </li>
      <li>were as expected and have reordered more and also got some for my sister!</li>
      <li>I like this product very much</li>
      <li>The &amp;#34;Gold&amp;#34; end highlighter is a quick and easy way to look like I have taken time on my eye makeup but really only used this product.  </li>
      <li>but Colorstay does exactly what the name implies</li>
      <li>I love this product, it makes my very very blonde eyebrows visible.</li>
      <li>I am so glad I can get this blonde eye brow pencil on amazon.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s so hard to find a good brow pencil for blonde hair, and having a nice highlighter attached is very enticing.</li>
      <li>My complexion is fair and my natural hair color Medium to Dark Brown.  </li>
      <li>I like this pencil because it lasts longer and it comes in the right shade for me (Blonde).  </li>
      <li>It goes on smooth and is not oily like eyeliner or some other borw pencils.  </li>
      <li>My hair is light blonde and white (I&#x27;m 58), but my eyebrows are dirty blonde, and this pencil was just too &amp;#34;golden&amp;#34; and bright for me.</li>
      <li>This is the only brow product that I have found that looks natural.  </li>
      <li>I use only the blond tinted wax end and not the gold highlighter end, for a totally natural and youthful look.</li>

<li> I use only the blond tinted wax end and not the gold highlighter end, for a totally natural and youthful look.</li>
<li> It is impossible to make the brow too dark when using the blond, which is a great color for blonds, red heads, or grey haired ladies.</li>
<li> Unfortunately, the blonde is a little dark from my light golden blonde hair; it makes my eyebrows look</li>
<li> I&#x27;m middle aged and don&#x27;t need glitter underneath my eyebrow.  </li>
<li> all-90s grunge and fake, but it would work on someone with light brown or dark blonde hair.</li>
<li> It doesn&#x27;t pull the skin like dry pencils can.</li>
<li> This lasts long and it&#x27;s a wide pen</li>
<li> I like using the highlighter on my browbones, the inner corner of my eyes, and down the bridge of my nose.</li>
<li> While really thin brows were &amp;#34;in&amp;#34; during the &#x27;70&#x27;s, they didn&#x27;t grow back to look like normal brows by the &#x27;90&#x27;s.  </li>
<li> It makes my brows look thicker and fills in the empty spots.</li>
<li> I wish the other end of the pencil was the brush instead of the brow highlighter...</li>
<li> Revlon discontinued this item and it is the only eye brow pencil that I have found that works for me as a blonde that is not too dark or fake.</li>
<li> This is one of the few brow pencils that matches my dark blond hair.</li>
<li> I have very pale to the point of not really seeing my eyebrows.  </li>
<li> But the shade was just a touch too dark, and each time I have bought this, the highlighter piece has fallen out!</li>
<li> I usually just use the brow side, but sometimes I will use the highlighter.</li>
<li> Brown looks ridiculous.</li>
<li> I guess it&#x27;s just poorly constructed.</li>
<li> the highlighter is kinda useless though</li>
<li> :(</li>

    <li> Best eyebrow pencil out there!  Only problem is the ability to find it!!!!</li>
    <li> This is my favorite &amp;#34;go to&amp;#34; eyebrow tool. The tinted eyebrow pencil works perfectly to enhance the brows without making them appear drawn on. I never use the shimmery gold highlighter, although some might like it.</li>
    <li> I like this product very much and I got it for a GREAT price. I like both products (the eyebrow wax and the brow enhancer) ... they are both the perfect color and look very natural. I would gladly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> This is awesome stuff!  While really thin brows were &amp;#34;in&amp;#34; during the &#x27;70&#x27;s, they didn&#x27;t grow back to look like normal brows by the &#x27;90&#x27;s.  Pencils wear off, smudge, etc. but Colorstay does exactly what the name implies: The COLOR STAYS on.&lt;br /&gt;I think it is the &amp;#34;wax&amp;#34; product that makes it easy to apply and creates very natural looking brows.  My complexion is fair and my natural hair color Medium to Dark Brown.  The brow end of the enhancer is the perfect color without making my brows darker.  The &amp;#34;Gold&amp;#34; end highlighter is a quick and easy way to look like I have taken time on my eye makeup but really only used this product.  Since Revlon seems to have discontinued it, I buy the Brown Enhancer whenever I see it so I will never run out!</li>
    <li> I love this pencil.  The crayon is the perfect consistency for brows. It goes on smooth and is not oily like eyeliner or some other borw pencils.  The trick is to use light sweeping strokes, not to press hard and try to draw a perfect line.  If you do sweeping strokes it gradually blends into your brows and looks more natural.  I recommed finding a color that best matches your natural brows, they have a couple options to choose from.  The brush that comes with it is a great idea but I quickly lost it. :( I wish the other end of the pencil was the brush instead of the brow highlighter...that would prevent me from losing it.    Overall great product.</li>
    <li> I have very pale to the point of not really seeing my eyebrows.  I have never been able to apply other pencils that looked &amp;#34;real&amp;#34;, and flawless.  This is just perfect and so very easy to apply.</li>
    <li> I wish I liked this product more than I do! It&#x27;s so hard to find a good brow pencil for blonde hair, and having a nice highlighter attached is very enticing. But the shade was just a touch too dark, and each time I have bought this, the highlighter piece has fallen out! I guess it&#x27;s just poorly constructed. I&#x27;ll wait for the next upgrade...</li>
    <li> This might work for somebody who has truly golden eyebrows, but it didn&#x27;t work for me.  My hair is light blonde and white (I&#x27;m 58), but my eyebrows are dirty blonde, and this pencil was just too &amp;#34;golden&amp;#34; and bright for me.</li>
    <li> Highlighter end is too sparkly. I&#x27;m middle aged and don&#x27;t need glitter underneath my eyebrow.  Wish there was more pencil and eliminate the highlighter end.</li>
    <li> love the wax, used with eyebrow powder it&#x27;s the best thing I&#x27;ve ever used. the highlighter is kinda useless though</li>
    <li> This is the only brow product that I have found that looks natural.  It very easy to use and tames those stray brows</li>
    <li> This pencil is the only wax that works on my eyebrows.  It makes my brows look thicker and fills in the empty spots.</li>
    <li> Perfect, highly recommend this seller</li>
    <li> were as expected and have reordered more and also got some for my sister!</li>
    <li> I am so glad I can get this blonde eye brow pencil on amazon.  Revlon discontinued this item and it is the only eye brow pencil that I have found that works for me as a blonde that is not too dark or fake.</li>
    <li> Throw the Estee Lauder in the trash and buy Revlon. I use only the blond tinted wax end and not the gold highlighter end, for a totally natural and youthful look. The wax coats the brow hairs and fills in any sparse areas. It doesn&#x27;t pull the skin like dry pencils can. It is impossible to make the brow too dark when using the blond, which is a great color for blonds, red heads, or grey haired ladies. It stays where you put it and it is easy to remove. This is the best brow product I have ever used. I use it every day.</li>
    <li> I love this it&#x27;s so natural.i love all the colors.</li>
    <li> I had my husband purchase this eye pencil on Amazon for me because I can no longer find it in our local stores. I hope Amazon doesn&#x27;t discontinue it because I think Revlon is doing just that.  I like this pencil because it lasts longer and it comes in the right shade for me (Blonde).  Not all &amp;#34;blonde&amp;#34; shades are alike and this is the right shade for me.</li>
    <li> Revlon&#x27;s Colorstay Brow Enhancer is pretty great-- I especially love the highlighter. Unfortunately, the blonde is a little dark from my light golden blonde hair; it makes my eyebrows look all-90s grunge and fake, but it would work on someone with light brown or dark blonde hair. I like using the highlighter on my browbones, the inner corner of my eyes, and down the bridge of my nose. Just don&#x27;t forget to blend, because the waxy texture tends to look crayon-like without it!</li>
    <li> wish stores still carried - this is a wonderful brow liner</li>
    <li> I have snow white hair. This looks the most natural on my brows. Brown looks ridiculous. This lasts long and it&#x27;s a wide pen so it&#x27;s easy to put on.</li>
    <li> This is one of the few brow pencils that matches my dark blond hair. I like that I don&#x27;t have to deal with a sharpener - I just twist the handle to get more. I don&#x27;t use the highlighter side.</li>
    <li> I love this product, it makes my very very blonde eyebrows visible. The brow highlighter side is great, gives it a more lifted look. I usually just use the brow side, but sometimes I will use the highlighter.</li>
    <li> Are they discontinuing the product? This product is a life line for me and it is gone out of every store and can not be found on the web. Someone inform me please. Love this product. Don&#x27;t need the highlight side of the pencil, but the shade part is GREAT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
