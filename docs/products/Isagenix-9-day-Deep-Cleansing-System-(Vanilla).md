      <li>Arrived before the scheduled time, which I was happy about.  </li>
      <li>Works great.</li>
      <li>I just don&#x27;t see how this can be good for you</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t have as good of results this time.</li>
      <li>Shake mix has a good flavor.</li>
      <li>none of it tastes good.  </li>
      <li>This process started out good.</li>
      <li>Nothing in the claims made by ISAGENIX are proven facts,they are their own studies &amp; results which have been proven to be NOT</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s like doing Insanity as opposed to exercising on your own.  </li>
      <li>Gaining weight is very easy,</li>
      <li>It is a good system, just didn&#x27;t quite work as quick as I had hoped.</li>
      <li>Package was filled with some sort of chemical odor and now product sits in garage to de scent!</li>
      <li>A.ways come out of the 9 days feeling like I have more energy, losing the weight I need to and able to stick to the diet.</li>
      <li>Maybe the chocolate tastes better, but for the price I&#x27;m not about to try.</li>

      <li>Takes dedication and will power to stick with the cleanse, but overall, I am happy with the product.  </li>
      <li>Hey these people want to get rich off your suffering,they don&#x27;t</li>
      <li>Be smart healthy people,it will change your life.</li>
      <li>I wish that I purchased the 30 day system, but I wasn&#x27;t sure I wanted to spend that much money.  </li>
      <li>The vanilla shake is good but the snacks are gross.</li>
      <li>The seller made the first part easy</li>
      <li>I know it doesn&#x27;t sound like much</li>
      <li>I honestly don&#x27;t think I can try it again and actually finish.</li>
      <li>Hey it&#x27;s your choice,do it the right way or keep failing.</li>
      <li>Like most individuals that attempted this program, I gained some pounds back, but I&#x27;m a CrossFitter (I know some people are probably cringing right now...</li>
      <li>The first day I was so hungry</li>
      <li>I never had the hunger issues that others have pointed out and the program gave me a nice little boost.</li>
      <li>Losing 23 lbs that fast is not recommended, and I know that, but I knew I had the self control to sustain after the fact.  </li>
      <li>I found the shakes to be more filling than any of the other ones I have tried and they contain 36 grams of protein.</li>
      <li>I have been on another program and losing weight steadily for about a year.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;d make sure that you definitely research the seller if you&#x27;re venturing outside of company to purchase the product.  </li>
      <li>It is not as satisfying as fried chicken, mashed potatoes and chocolate cake, but it gives better results.</li>
      <li>The Isagenix 9 day Deep Cleansing System really works!  </li>
      <li>I gained 6 back in the first 3 days.</li>
      <li>I suggest buying directly through isagenix</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not something I&#x27;d recommend over the long haul, which I&#x27;m sure the company realizes since they also have a 30 day program, but I guess it comes down to expectation management and a lot of self control.  </li>
      <li>The other reviews are right.....</li>
      <li>but if you make sure it is super cold</li>
      <li>and not a wise &amp; healthy one.</li>
      <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think this program is all about personal preference and knowing what you&#x27;re capable of as an individual.  </li>
      <li>and I ended up losing 11 lbs in the first nine days and a subsequent 12 pounds by following an ACTUAL sensible eating regimen in the following 10 days.  </li>
      <li>I will buy direct next time.</li>
      <li>Why would anyone want to go through this expensive kind of torture to lose weight is beyond my understanding.</li>
      <li>losing it is not.&lt;br /&gt;You need to have patience &amp; change your bad eating habits for healthy real foods &amp; keep it up for a lifetime.&lt;br /&gt;Most</li>

<li> losing it is not.&lt;br /&gt;You need to have patience &amp; change your bad eating habits for healthy real foods &amp; keep it up for a lifetime.&lt;br /&gt;Most</li>
<li> If I were a nutritionist, I&#x27;d probably bad mouth the product as well, but as a person and athlete that was willing to succumb to my dieting laziness, I was fine with fasting and deficit dieting.  </li>
<li> He went completely off of it for a few years and gained the weight back</li>
<li> order was not complete.  </li>
<li> The cleanse days are extremely difficult and are more or less mind over matter.  </li>
<li> It will help you loose weight if you follow the system but will not change your lifestyle.....</li>
<li> I&#x27;ll start off by saying that I did the 9-Day Cleanse (11 days, if you want to get technical) about a year and half ago</li>
<li> so the ten pounds that I gained afterwards was from what I believe to be muscle gain and a little bit of fat.&lt;br</li>
<li> at 51 i changed my nasty eating habits for healthy real foods &amp; lost the weight by eating some 5-6 times a day.</li>
<li> Was not what I expected, all the bottles were samples.</li>
<li> One of the few products that actually works in 9 days IF you follow directions!</li>
<li> If it&#x27;s easier to follow the direction of someone because you don&#x27;t know what you&#x27;re doing or are too lazy to come up with a program, then so be it (personal preference).  </li>
<li> I chugged it down for two days and was close to gagging each time.  </li>
<li> It was not easy to get the beverage down and was I ever hungry.</li>
<li> like any crazy diets you need to keep buying &amp; taking this diet depending on how much weight you need to lose.</li>
<li> just wanted to lose a few pounds before vacation.  </li>
<li> Don&#x27;t waste your time and money.</li>
<li> Don&#x27;t waste your money or time</li>
<li> This system is for people who are in shape and want to lose a few pounds.  </li>
<li> It was not easy to go with no food.</li>
<li> I was faint by 4pm, I felt ok throughout the day just a little tired, but sad</li>
<li> You can have 6 almonds, 1 apple, 1 small salad with balsamic vinegar (no oil) and all the celery you want.  </li>
<li> problem with losing weight in most cases are people that don&#x27;t want to change their nasty unhealthy eating habits &amp; they expect to lose the weight stupidly fast like these crazy unhealthy diets.</li>
<li> I have used this Isagenix products to do a 9 day cleanse in the past and will continue to use it as the Isagenix product line works!</li>
<li> If you are serious about losing some pounds and inches, try it.</li>
<li> I&#x27;m sorry</li>
<li> In my research on these products it is my conclusion &amp; opinion that this is nothing but an expensive scam &amp; fraud.</li>
<li> I had the worst headache, nausea, and overall fatigue</li>
<li> I am a person that suffered with being over weight all my life,i was miserable &amp; tried everything including stupid diets similar to this one,and yes i failed &amp; got depressed time after time.&lt;br /&gt;Now</li>
<li> Crazy diets come &amp; go,so will this one.</li>
<li> fail on these stupid diets because they can&#x27;t keep taking this expensive fake awful tasting food replacement forever &amp;</li>
<li> I realized it wasn&#x27;t that bad considering the amount of weight I had lost.</li>
<li> I ended up getting sick on day two of the pre cleanse</li>
<li> This is a terrible product.</li>
<li> The &amp;#34;Snacks&amp;#34; are disgusting!</li>
<li> the shakes are not tasty they are nasty!</li>
<li> This product tasted so disgusting</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Works great. I lost 8 lbs in 2 weeks</li>
    <li> Package was filled with some sort of chemical odor and now product sits in garage to de scent! For this price you would of thought that it came with instructions. IT DOESN&#x27;T. I will buy direct next time.</li>
    <li> Shake mix has a good flavor. The &amp;#34;Snacks&amp;#34; are disgusting! Like pressed shake powder. I threw them out! The cleanse still has a gross taste but if you make sure it is super cold it is do-able. This was my second time using this product. I didn&#x27;t have as good of results this time.</li>
    <li> It is a good system, just didn&#x27;t quite work as quick as I had hoped.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money or time</li>
    <li> The shakes and snacks were unedible. The main principle is good, so I can follow the guideline with my own supplemented shakes. I had the vanilla. Maybe the chocolate tastes better, but for the price I&#x27;m not about to try.</li>
    <li> There isn&#x27;t a low enough star to describe the taste of this product.  I&#x27;m sorry but it just isn&#x27;t tasty at all.  I chugged it down for two days and was close to gagging each time.  The juice  is the same.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work at all wouldn&#x27;t recommend it it also didn&#x27;t come with the proper materials as if you were to buy it off the website.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste your time and money.</li>
    <li> This process started out good. Shake day was no problem.Cleanse day is another story. It was not easy to get the beverage down and was I ever hungry. I do not eat much on a daily basis. It was not easy to go with no food. Speak to your physician prior to starting this product. Shakes taste YUMMY so I will continue the shake days.</li>
    <li> Why would anyone want to go through this expensive kind of torture to lose weight is beyond my understanding. In my research on these products it is my conclusion &amp; opinion that this is nothing but an expensive scam &amp; fraud. They tell you \\&quot;it&#x27;s not a diet\\&quot; shacks, supplements &amp; snacks in a bottle &amp; fasting-IS A DIET! and not a wise &amp; healthy one. Of course you are going to lose weight drinking shakes &amp; fasting.&lt;br /&gt;This like any crazy diets you need to keep buying &amp; taking this diet depending on how much weight you need to lose. Nothing in the claims made by ISAGENIX are proven facts,they are their own studies &amp; results which have been proven to be NOT CONVINCING!&lt;br /&gt;Anyone can achieve successful weight lost if they change their eating habits by eating healthy real foods.&lt;br /&gt;The problem with losing weight in most cases are people that don&#x27;t want to change their nasty unhealthy eating habits &amp; they expect to lose the weight stupidly fast like these crazy unhealthy diets. Gaining weight is very easy,losing it is not.&lt;br /&gt;You need to have patience &amp; change your bad eating habits for healthy real foods &amp; keep it up for a lifetime.&lt;br /&gt;Most fail on these stupid diets because they can&#x27;t keep taking this expensive fake awful tasting food replacement forever &amp; when they do stop using the weight comes back with a vengeance. Hey these people want to get rich off your suffering,they don&#x27;t care.&lt;br /&gt;Who am I? I am a person that suffered with being over weight all my life,i was miserable &amp; tried everything including stupid diets similar to this one,and yes i failed &amp; got depressed time after time.&lt;br /&gt;Now at 51 i changed my nasty eating habits for healthy real foods &amp; lost the weight by eating some 5-6 times a day. Hey it&#x27;s your choice,do it the right way or keep failing. And i am talking about massive weight loss here 100lbs &amp; over. Crazy diets come &amp; go,so will this one. Be smart healthy people,it will change your life.</li>
    <li> Works great! I lost 11 lbs and my husband lost 15 lbs and we have kept it off for almost a month now. The vanilla shake is good but the snacks are gross. I found the cleanse days to be easier than the shake days. I would recommend Isagenix.</li>
    <li> One of the few products that actually works in 9 days IF you follow directions!</li>
    <li> Arrived before the scheduled time, which I was happy about.  Takes dedication and will power to stick with the cleanse, but overall, I am happy with the product.  Some of the tastes are a bit different and take some getting use to.  I ordered the vanilla and my daughter ordered the chocolate.  I would order the chocolate if I do this again.</li>
    <li> On time, all was there.  For me there are two steps to losing weight, waiting for this product and then going through with it.  The seller made the first part easy</li>
    <li> This product tasted so disgusting I had to hold my nose to drink it.  The first day I was so hungry I was faint by 4pm, I felt ok throughout the day just a little tired, but sad I was driving home u thought I was going to pass out.  I had the worst headache, nausea, and overall fatigue I&#x27;ve ever had.  I ended up getting sick on day two of the pre cleanse so I never started the actual cleanser with just the liquid.  I just don&#x27;t see how this can be good for you, shake days are only about 1,000 calories, cleanse days are about 300...the shakes are not tasty they are nasty! The snacks were gummy, chalky just gross.  I can see the reason one would lose weight, YOUR STARVING YOURSELF for 11 days.  I honestly don&#x27;t think I can try it again and actually finish.</li>
    <li> Works for my husband...he looses weight  on this system.  He went completely off of it for a few years and gained the weight back and so know he is on it again. It will help you loose weight if you follow the system but will not change your lifestyle.....you have to change yourself to keep the weight off unless you are forever using this to maintain your weight.</li>
    <li> I have been on another program and losing weight steadily for about a year. I heard about this product and wanted to give it a try. I found the shakes to be more filling than any of the other ones I have tried and they contain 36 grams of protein. I never had the hunger issues that others have pointed out and the program gave me a nice little boost. I will probably use this 9 day (actually 11 day) program once a month to speed me towards my goal of 100 lbs to lose. It is not as satisfying as fried chicken, mashed potatoes and chocolate cake, but it gives better results. If you are serious about losing some pounds and inches, try it. It works.</li>
    <li> I have used this Isagenix products to do a 9 day cleanse in the past and will continue to use it as the Isagenix product line works!</li>
    <li> order was not complete.  Product returned</li>
    <li> This is a terrible product. I starved myself for 11 days, yes this lasts for 11 days not 9 and only lost 10 lbs. I gained 6 back in the first 3 days. I would not recommend this product to anyone. THIS IS A SCAM!!!!</li>
    <li> The Isagenix 9 day Deep Cleansing System really works!  I wish that I purchased the 30 day system, but I wasn&#x27;t sure I wanted to spend that much money.  I lost 7 lbs. in the 9 days.  The cleanse days are extremely difficult and are more or less mind over matter.  When I was on day two of the fasting, I thought there is no way I&#x27;m doing this again.  That was only until I got on the scale and my attitude totally changed.  I realized it wasn&#x27;t that bad considering the amount of weight I had lost.</li>
    <li> I tried this on the advice of a friend who does fitness &amp; nutrition counseling.  I&#x27;m not overweight....just wanted to lose a few pounds before vacation.  The other reviews are right.....none of it tastes good.  But for 9 days, it&#x27;s not the end of the world.  I added berries to the shakes, which improved the taste.  On the cleanse day, you don&#x27;t have to starve and only drink the juice.  You can have 6 almonds, 1 apple, 1 small salad with balsamic vinegar (no oil) and all the celery you want.  I know it doesn&#x27;t sound like much but it does get your through the day.  This system is for people who are in shape and want to lose a few pounds.  It does work!</li>
    <li> Was not what I expected, all the bottles were samples. I suggest buying directly through isagenix</li>
    <li> Just an amazin product.  Have done the 9 day cleanse twice a year for the last 4 years.  Never feel hungry.  A.ways come out of the 9 days feeling like I have more energy, losing the weight I need to and able to stick to the diet.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll start off by saying that I did the 9-Day Cleanse (11 days, if you want to get technical) about a year and half ago and I ended up losing 11 lbs in the first nine days and a subsequent 12 pounds by following an ACTUAL sensible eating regimen in the following 10 days.  Losing 23 lbs that fast is not recommended, and I know that, but I knew I had the self control to sustain after the fact.  Like most individuals that attempted this program, I gained some pounds back, but I&#x27;m a CrossFitter (I know some people are probably cringing right now...lol) so the ten pounds that I gained afterwards was from what I believe to be muscle gain and a little bit of fat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think this program is all about personal preference and knowing what you&#x27;re capable of as an individual.  It&#x27;s like doing Insanity as opposed to exercising on your own.  If it&#x27;s easier to follow the direction of someone because you don&#x27;t know what you&#x27;re doing or are too lazy to come up with a program, then so be it (personal preference).  If I were a nutritionist, I&#x27;d probably bad mouth the product as well, but as a person and athlete that was willing to succumb to my dieting laziness, I was fine with fasting and deficit dieting.  It&#x27;s not something I&#x27;d recommend over the long haul, which I&#x27;m sure the company realizes since they also have a 30 day program, but I guess it comes down to expectation management and a lot of self control.  I&#x27;d make sure that you definitely research the seller if you&#x27;re venturing outside of company to purchase the product.  Good luck!</li>
