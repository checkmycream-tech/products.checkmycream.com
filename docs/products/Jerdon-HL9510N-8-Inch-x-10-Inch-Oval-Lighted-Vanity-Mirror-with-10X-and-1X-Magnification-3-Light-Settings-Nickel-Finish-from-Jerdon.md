<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Perfect size for bathroom counter .gave as gift daughter in-law loved it.</li>
    <li> Good mirror but I wish the light was brighter</li>
    <li> I ordered this lighted mirror as a backup to the 10x mirror I purchased some years ago.  It is not as good as the one I bought at Nordstrom originally.  I also find the little 15x spot mirror a distraction and not useful.</li>
    <li> The mirror was delivered promptly.  After plugging it in and turning the  switch that controls the light three times to the highest setting, I was disappointed that it wasn&#x27;t brighter.  Otherwise, quality is great, mirror is well made.  Magnification is good enough, just needs to be brighter illumination. You will have to supplement the lighting.</li>
    <li> This mirror is attractive enough on your table, but there&#x27;s practically no light.  It has 3 settings dim, dimmer, and dimmest. Save your money.</li>
    <li> dimensions of mirror are what they said they were but mirror could stand to be a couple of inches larger in diameter. Good product though.</li>
    <li> I purchased this mirror based on the good reviews that it had. I needed a good makeup mirror that magnifies and especially with good lighting. This mirror is even better than I thought it would be. The lighting is perfect for putting on makeup and you can see every last detail as you work. I can see more detail than when wearing reading glasses. There is a small circle of extra magnification on the bottom of the mirror that is super for plucking hair in places you would not see just looking in the mirror. The mirror is heavy and well made, and beautiful. It is very steady on the base and not tippable. Love this mirror it is worth every penny and any female would adore it for her vanity and putting on makeup.</li>
    <li> Wonderful design, but the light is too dim. I could have saved a lot of money sticking with my regular mirror and vanity lighting. The 15x inset is helpful but takes up 1/3 of the 10x side of the mirror.</li>
    <li> Light is not bright enough.  Liked my old one better!</li>
    <li> This high-quality product is perfect for my needs.  I love the 15x insert--I use it daily.  This mirror is taller than I had expected.  (I had a smaller Jerdon mirror previously but the glass shattered somewhere in baggage handling.) This one is too large for travel, but for daily use it is wonderful!  I highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> The mirror was advertised as 10x magnification. Magnification was no different than a 5x mirror I already owned. In fact after reading the enclosed insert it stated the mirror only magnified 5X although the box and mirror stated 10x. The mirror lighting was poor. I am returning the mirror</li>
    <li> I almost was scared off by online reviews of this mirror, but I did order it and I love it.  Good lighting, good magnification.  I use it for tweezing and for putting in contact lenses.  Works great!</li>
    <li> DO NOT buy this mirror if you absolutely need a 10X Magnification, it is no more than 5X and it even states that in the instructions that come with the mirror. The box and sticker on the mirror both say 10X which is a lie and false advertising. I set my 10X mirror that I already have beside it and there is a HUGE DIFFERENCE in the Magnification, such a shame because it is a beautiful looking mirror. And what also stinks is that when you send it back you have to pay a 15% restocking fee and if you initially got free shipping they are going to also deduct some shipping charges from your credit even tho you got free shipping and on top of that you have to pay for 100% shipping to return it!! VERY DISSAPOINTED!!</li>
    <li> While I was growing up my mother always had one of the 3 paneled make up mirrors that had the different light settings in the bathroom so she could see to put on her makeup..through the years her eyes have worsened.  When I went to visit her for Thanksgiving I noticed she was having alot of trouble seeing in that old thing and she made the comment she wished she could find one with 10x magnification.  Well I looked everywhere for a 3 panelled lighted mirror for her but couldnt find one anywhere so \\&quot;settled\\&quot; on this one.  And am very happy I did...I had it delivered to her and it arrived 4 days before Christmas...when she saw what it was she immediately tried it out...within minutes she was calling me and actually crying the words \\&quot;thank you\\&quot;  she LOVES it..and the little circle with the 15x makes it even easier for her to see!  I would highly recomend this to any one who has a mother they love as much as I do mine &#x3D;)</li>
    <li> As some of the other reviewers stated, the light is not bright enough even on high. The measurements are a little deceiving since the 8\\&quot; wide includes the light area and your actual mirror \\&quot;viewing area\\&quot; is narrow and the insert makes it even less. I do question the 10x mirror. Even though everything (Box and mirror labels) indicate the larger mirror is 10x, the information insert that was included stated that it was 5x which seemed more accurate to me, but I am sure that is just a matter of perception. I did not include the fact that the mirror had two scratches on it as part of the review, because that fact really doesn&#x27;t factor into the merits (or demerits)of the mirror as a unit.</li>
    <li> Quality product. Great price! It was a bit larger than I imagined, but it works beautifully. The different light settings come in handy as well as the 3 different magnification levels. The 15x small mirror takes getting use to without going cross eyed, but I&#x27;m getting the hang of it. Looks nice with brushed nickel in the bathroom.</li>
    <li> The description says this mirror is 10X, but when I got it, it had a sticker on it saying it was only 5X.  The lights is not as bright as I would like it, I need other bright lights around it.  It is okay, but I wouldn&#x27;t purchase it if I had known it was only 5X.</li>
    <li> this mirror is very nice, but too big for my bathroom - just took up too much room - be sure to measure the space where it is going to go - otherwise, it seemed very well-made and good magnification</li>
    <li> 10 X magnification is not enough for me to do my eyebrows and the tiny 15 X magnification circle is not large enough, nor is the light all that great. Going back to BB&amp;B to replace the one I broke. Loved that one.</li>
    <li> Product did not include a replacement bulb.  Write-up did not state that the lighting was not natural.  I did not see clearly, or in my case at all, the return policy that included a 15% restocking fee.  I returned the item and was charged the fee.  Buyer beware.  This is my first purchase on Amazon and likely my last.  Certainly my last with this company.</li>
    <li> Quality is great but not as magnifying as I would have liked</li>
    <li> Not as magnified as they claim and so dim that you might as well not have the light. A real disappointment! I returned it.</li>
    <li> This is the second of two Jerdon mirrors that ordered.  Both seemed like good mirrors and looked good. BUT neither had the magnification that was advertised.  I saw other comments but I thought folks may have been wrong but heed these comments:  the magnification is not what it is advertised!!</li>
    <li> The first one sent was broken and had wonderful people to talk to they immediately sent me another mirror and paid all the postage. The second mirror is fantastic. Amazon you are really great to work with</li>
    <li> Love all the magnification choices.  Fully swivels so I can use it on many different counter levels and see what I need to see.&lt;br /&gt;Like that it has 3 levels of light.  Only drawback is that it gets hot.</li>
    <li> We bought these for twin daughters for their 22nd birthdays.  This product is superior and I also spent considerable time reading others&#x27; reviews.  It is not something that someone would buy for themselves.  However, it is a bit of luxury for them and we are happy to give this to them.  Lighting anywhere (especially in an apartment) might be difficult, so this is a great gift for some pampering.</li>
    <li> The halo lighting works well, along with the 10x magnification, in avoiding errors in makeup application.  This mirror is far superior to the one I had been using.</li>
    <li> The is a well made mirror.  Magnification and standard sides are perfect.  Only complaint is that the lighting could be a little brighter.</li>
    <li> The three levels of lighting are not as significant as described.  The light is sturdy and well made but not what I was expecting.</li>
    <li> Gave as a gift. Recipient loves it. Would recommend.</li>
    <li> I really like this mirror. It has three lighting options and the magnification is super. i would reccomend this product.</li>
    <li> I wanted this and husband got it for me. I didnt realize the 15 magnification was only a small dot on the mirror. Really too small to use the 15. Can only use the larger mirror for makup, which is nice. But still dissapointed. I thought it was 15 on one side and 10 on the other. Not what I expected.</li>
    <li> Absolutely exactly what I was looking for.  I have a drawer full of mirrors that were not right.  The 15X magnifying spot is the perfect thing for touching up eyebrows with a pencil and tweezing.&lt;br /&gt;Makeup looks great under the varying lights.  Thanks for a great product which will get many years of happy use.</li>
    <li> I wish the super magnification area was larger...and the lighting is not quite bright enough for me...I need the additional light from the vanity area to really be able to see.  I also find that I am not really thrilled with the oval shape..I used to have a round mirror and I find that I can see much better with the round shape.  It&#x27;s very sturdy, but that means it&#x27;s a pain to pick it up to look at the back of my head.  IT IS BEAUTIFUL...but I find myself using my large round hand mirror almost more than using this one...even though this is on the shelf and the hand mirror is in the drawer and I&#x27;m basically lazy :-)&lt;br /&gt;If looks matter, you will love this....but function does suffer :-(</li>
    <li> 1st one broke but they sent another right away</li>
    <li> Its big and love the magnifying mirror.  Lights could be a little brighter, but still good.  Definitely would recommend it.</li>
    <li> the first time I used it the small mirror popped out .. have not been able to fix it .. the mirror heats up from the light and when u heat up glue it melts .. what a mess.. the only reason I did not return it is I threw out the box .. it was a xmas gift from my daughter...</li>
    <li> After a frustrating and fruitless search for replacement bulbs for my last illuminated mirror, I went back to the drawing board and found the Jerdon HL9510N.  I could NOT wait for it to arrive - I missed seeing me up close and personal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Jerdon&#x27;s three levels of illumination are more than adequate.  The 15X magnification insert was a little difficult to get accustomed to - however, I am getting there. The 10X magnification is ample while I transition.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only issue with the Jerdon, so far, is that it heats up.  When I try to turn the mirror from regular to magnified, after it having been on for awhile, that heating up is an unpleasant sensation.  Now, should the Jerdon prove to become the burden my last mirror was in terms of bulb shopping, I will be revising - but otherwise, this mirror is well made and worth the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just a note:  I would have gladly given it 5 stars if it didn&#x27;t get as hot as it does around the borders.</li>
    <li> Great mirror with 2 magnifying views. The light is more &amp;#34;warm&amp;#34; than white, but has 3 settings.&lt;br /&gt;Sturdy and attractive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A good buy.</li>
    <li> Great magnifying mirror.  My first purchase for this type of makeup mirror.</li>
    <li> yPrior to this I had a Conair mirror with the same features. I would have ordered the same Conair mirror had it been available. But, it&#x27;s been discontinued and so has the replacement bulb. So, i had searched this site for the equivalent .... Conair&#x27;s replacement had the wrong finish, so I went with the Jerdon. Even though the Jerdon has 3 lighting levels, who uses the first 2??? I find myoself going straight for the brightest level! Also, it was important to me that my mirror have the 15X spot mirror (for plucking brows !!!) - which this has, but it somehow does not appear to light up my brows the way the Conair used to. So, somewhat let down because if the Conair had the the finish that fit my bathroom decor, i have a feeling that it was the better unit...... hmmm .. So there in lies the real issue....&amp;#34;function or design&amp;#34;????????</li>
    <li> I compared this 10x mirror to an 8x one and the 8x had more magnification, also light was dim and yellowish, very disappointed.</li>
    <li> Really, I think the magnifying part doesn&#x27;t delivery what it claims to be and it is too small...nice design otherwise,</li>
    <li> This is the greatest vanity light.</li>
    <li> Quality is good, aesthetics are good,  item as described, and the light is 3-way. I only don&#x27;t love it because I&#x27;m not a fan of it being oval and I wish the small round 15X magnifier was a just a tad bigger in diameter. All in all, I reccomend this if it&#x27;s what you&#x27;re looking for.</li>
    <li> Got it for my wife.  All  I know is this mirror allow her to see lot more detail without wearing glasses.</li>
    <li> The light on this remains dim, no matter how high it&#x27;s set. The inset is almost unusable, and the larger mirror is set oddly for the face.</li>
    <li> I was buying a lighted mirror to help see with make-up application on these dark winter mornings. This mirror, however, does not fit the bill. It reminds me of a soft evening light. Not nearly bright enough to help with eyebrow care or application of eyeliner. A big disappointment in that regard. It does seem well made and sturdy. Plenty tall enough for table top use. You won&#x27;t have to scrunch down too awfully much to use this. The mirrors are clear and even. Not what I was looking for though. Returning it.</li>
    <li> Does not produce a good light.  Love the height of the mirror.  But that is all.</li>
    <li> I am disappointed in this mirror.  The size is right, the lighting is very dull.&lt;br /&gt;the magnification is more like 5x than 10x.&lt;br /&gt;The spot mirror is more rrepresentative of a 10x magnification.</li>
    <li> My old Sharper Image lighted mirror finally blew both of its lights and I cannot find the right bulbs for it.  So I decided to purchase  a new mirror and one that hopefully had a 10X magnification as my eyes aren&#x27;t as strong as they once were!  This mirror more than meets my needs.  It has a lovely finish that fits right into my bathroom decor and the 15X insert is fantastic for finding and pulling out those pesky chin hairs as well as eyebrow plucking!  I&#x27;m so happy I took the chance and ordered this mirror.  I nearly didn&#x27;t because of a review that the insert magnification was too strong for that individual.  But it works just fine for me and the 10X is great for makeup applications without having my glasses or contacts on.  I highly recommend this mirror as the lighting effect is spot on with the ability to change it to three different levels depending on your needs.  This cost less than my old mirror but works so much better.  A great find and buy!</li>
    <li> Nice but the bulbs for the light get hot. You can feel it on your face of up close doing makeup.</li>
    <li> This mirror looks nice and is well made. Unfortunately, the little 15x mirror gets in the way of seeing into the larger mirror. Also, the little 15x mirror is too small to use effectively.</li>
    <li> I would give this 5 stars but the lights are SO dim!  I am very disappointed as in order to use it and get the full use, I have to sit by window or outside.  Kind of a bummer when it&#x27;s time to go out on the town at night...</li>
    <li> This lighted mirror made for a happy wife. It has the usual magnification but also a more powerful insert. The lighting is quite adequate but, at the same time, gentle. When our old one died, and I could not find a replacement bulb, I found this treasure.</li>
    <li> I would recommend this mirror to anyone! It is the perfect size and has 3 light brightness adjustments also! It looks nice in the bathroom and the style is very modern.</li>
    <li> I used to use a 5x mirror and I&#x27;m only in my early 40&#x27;s and now need a little more magnification to see my eyebrows, uggg.  The little insert that is 15x works perfect for this while the 10x part works for everything else.  I love this mirror.  The only complaint I have would be the amount of light it puts out isn&#x27;t quite what I would want for daily use.  It has three graduating light levels and they are very close (almost the same).  I wish the were larger differences getting brighter when needed.  I use this mirror everyday.</li>
    <li> very pleased.It is of very high quality,the lighting is good.</li>
    <li> Great and being oval fits on the vanity better than a round one.</li>
    <li> Very happy with this mirror. Enough magnification so I can apply my eye makeup and the light is great. Only drawback is, because I don&#x27;t have a proper vanity I have to use it on the sink counter, which means I have to stoop to use it. Wish it could be raised and lowered.</li>
    <li> Great mirror for up close details. Easy on the eyes and magnification work well!</li>
    <li> Exactly what I needed.  Recently had cataract surgery and traded my almost microscopic close up vision for distance vision correctable to 20/20. More than an even trade, but can no longer see my face close enough for eyebrow tweezing, etc.  This does the job!!!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s great looking. It has 3 light levels which i didn&#x27;t even expect.  Unfortunately, the 15 power mirror works !!!!!</li>
    <li> I love this mirror!  It works great and is also very attractive.  The only suggestion for improvement is to make the mirror not quite so tall.</li>
    <li> I like this mirror and I got it especially for the little super magnification mirror set in the 10x side of the mirror.  I thought it would be helpful for eyeliner application, but it gets in the way of using the mirror as a whole.</li>
    <li> I think I prefer the round mirrors. It seems that I can see more of my face in the round. I&#x27;ve just had it for a couple of days, maybe I&#x27;ll get used to it. Light is good and the mini X15 mirror is nice for doing my eyebrows.</li>
    <li> Excellent quality and service.</li>
    <li> The lighting is so weak it is not serving the purpose I ordered it for. Bummer. Looks nice though.</li>
    <li> the necklace was beautiful. Thank you</li>
    <li> The mirror is attractive enough and I like the small 15x magnifier at the bottom.  I wish the light were brighter, though. It just barely escapes qualifying as inadequate.</li>
    <li> I was a wee leery after reading some of the reviews about this mirror, but I am happy to say it is fantastic. No, the lighting isn&#x27;t bright, so if that&#x27;s what your looking for keep looking, but everything else is spot on. I did have my old make~up mirror on stand by just in case this wasn&#x27;t what I wanted, but tossed it after using this one. The spot mirror is great, really shows all those little hairs and crazy eyebrows, and I have no problem with the magnification. GREAT FIND!</li>
    <li> This lighted mirror worked great when first purchased. Once the bulb blew out and a replacement bulb had to be purchased, the mirror isn&#x27;t as bright as it originally was.  Magnification is good.  Wish the replacement bulbs were as good or better than the originally installed one.</li>
    <li> My wife loves it she says it is great was one of the best gifts I could have given her</li>
    <li> The switch is not working. I can only use this light when I plug and unplug the mirror.&lt;br /&gt;For the amount of money I  paid, it should have lasted longer than 9 months.</li>
    <li> i bought this for my wife and she loves this mirror because her hole face fits in the oval mirror in round ones you have to keep moving your face to see all of it, not in this one, well made, look great</li>
    <li> The item arrived quickly and as promised. Best mirror I&#x27;ve every had.</li>
    <li> Great concept, but it needs to be brighter.</li>
    <li> Have a really nice Jerdon 10X  circular mirror which I love but thought this mirror might be better because of the added 15X smaller area for easier spotting of stray brows.  One side of the mirror is 5X, flip it over and the other is 10X with the added 15X area to bottom. The 3 speed light switch is annoying as you can barely see any light when it is even at the highest setting so you will need additional light to see your face so this fails as far a lighting goes.  Now as to size---this is a very narrow oval mirror and i find it annoying as you have to keep moving the mirror up or down to see entire face when applying foundation (the older circular mirror was much more practical)  And to add to the misery of the oval shape the 15X portion is a MAJOR distraction when just doing basic foundation or blush application.  This mirror would be great if truly a circular mirror so entire face could be easily seen without moving the mirror several times for basic use.  Tried to reverse the 15 X to the top---the cord is connected there and you might have a fire hazard over time doing that.  I have this a 4 star but really wanted to give it a 31/2 star as it is ok and you can adjust to it over time but I would not buy this again. I&#x27;d stick to the 10X circular mirror and buy a cheap 15X to use when checking the eyebrows for a more pleasant and practical experience.</li>
    <li> This is a great mirror ! Pretty and made well .</li>
    <li> I really wanted to like this mirror simply because it looked fantastic on my vanity.  The magnified mirrors are nice too.  However, I returned this beautiful mirror because the light was inadequate.  It has a bit of a yellow hue and is not very bright.  So, I found that I was not applying my makeup very well.  Once I am in my car in the driveway in full daylight and sneak a glance at myself in the rearview mirror, I am appalled at what a terrible job I did with my makeup even though it looked fine while sitting at this mirror.  Basically, I am saying this mirror lied to me by telling me I looked good.  Need full white light at my mirror to know the ugly truth BEFORE I go face the world - LOL  :-P</li>
    <li> The light on this mirror--even at its brightest setting--is simply not bright enough. If you need a mirror for plucking and tweezing, the magnification is fine, but the light isn&#x27;t sufficient. Would not spend the money again on this mirror.</li>
    <li> I am so happy with this mirror (even though it doesn&#x27;t hide my wrinkles!) It sits high enough on the counter that one can sit straight, hands free, and see to apply makeup, pluck eyebrows and curl one&#x27;s hair.  I feel it was well worth the price of the mirror.</li>
    <li> I first learned of Jerdon mirrors while staying in a hotel a few years ago.  I was very impressed with the quality of light and magnification.  I determined that when my current mirror &#x27;died&#x27; I would buy a Jerdon.  It did; I did.  I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased with my mirror!  I would highly recommend this product to anyone who would like a quality make up mirror at a fair price.</li>
    <li> I bought this for a gift for my daughter. It&#x27;s awesome. She loves it!</li>
    <li> It was thicker than what I was expecting and takes up a bit more space then I thought it would.  By the picture, I thought it was more streamlined and thin (sleeker)</li>
    <li> This is a quality mirror and it is lovely to use at my make up desk.  It is exactly as described, and I would recommend it!</li>
    <li> THE LIGHT IS NOT BRIGHT ENOUGH FOR ME.</li>
    <li> I initially bought this mirror because it was so large and it had various magnifications, but today after 5 months of having this mirror, the little magnification mirror fell out leaving a huge hole. I tried to stick it back in but it doesn&#x27;t fit flush to the mirror the way it did. I barely used the mirror so I feel like this is a complete waste of money. I think the light bulb melted the glue causing the little mirror to fall out. I also dislike this mirror because the lighting is yellow not white which makes your makeup look weird when your in public. You think you&#x27;ve done such a beautiful job just to find out it was deceiving you all along. If you can replace the bulb with a white bulb than you can fix that problem but the mini mirror falling out was so disappointing, I know I will definitely NOT be repurchasing.</li>
    <li> love the mirror but the light is so poor that I have to use another lamp. I tried higher wattage bulbs but the wires started overheating (they were still pretty low wattage).</li>
    <li> Absolutely love it. Would recommend it to anyone. Researched at many stores before I purchased it. It is really great!</li>
    <li> Purchased this mirror not happy with it, it says its a 10X and a 15X the mag on this mirror is not a 10X not happy</li>
    <li> Fulfilled all my needs..love, love, love the magnifications .. Lights could be brighter. Still great for the price and would recommend to others</li>
    <li> As a 25+ year user of lighted vanity mirrors this is by far the worst I have ever purchased.  Returning product today.  It uses 2 candleabra incandelescent bulbs, one 15W the other 25W.  If only 40 watts on High isn&#x27;t bad enough, there is a beige toned spray coating around the mirror to soften the already dim light.  Don&#x27;t waste your time or money.  Also, this is NOT 10X magnification!</li>
    <li> I would not recommend spending your money on this mirror. It appears in the photo that it&#x27;s a circular mirror, even though they say oval. The oval one I received is very tall and the image is distorted. It is NOT distortion-free glass in any sense of the word, which is extremely disappointing for the price. Also, it is NOT a 10X mirror. Even the included directions list only a 5X mirror (although the box claims 10X). I have a lighted 5X and when holding them side-by-side, my old mirror wins by quite a considerable amount over this so-called 10X! And that is what I was trying to replace. Very disappointed. Because of the distortion, the 15X insert (and I now question it may only be 10X) is difficult to use. I had a Christmas gift card to finally purchase something special and have already thanked the giver again and expressed what a nice item I got with the gift card once I found and ordered it, so returning it now isn&#x27;t as easy; not to mention because of the 15% restocking fee and loss of further funds via the shipping charges deducted (based on others&#x27; reviews of their refund deductions and the requirements to pay 100% shipping to return it). I would have to pay to send it back and not receive my entire gift card amount either. I&#x27;ll be keeping it, but I&#x27;m not happy. And I&#x27;m definitely keeping my 5X mirror and using this one in a limited way, likely being disappointed every time I look into it. Next time I will be purchasing locally and looking for distortion-free glass, even though I will probably pay more.</li>
    <li> Great quality, works great. Love that it has 3 light settings and the 15x small mirror is excellent!</li>
    <li> Excellent mirror. . . .just the right height.  Lighting &amp; magnification is good enough for tweezing &amp; applying makeup, but it&#x27;s always a good idea to double check what you look like in natural light before leaving the house.</li>
    <li> I purchased thinking the magnified spot would help me see my pesky little facial hairs better however I had to stick my Tweezerman 10X mirror on top.  At least, it is a good stand for my Tweezerman.  I would not recommend but realize that other&#x27;s eyesight may be better than mine.  In principle, I like the idea of the mirror but it doesn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
    <li> My wife had been asking for a magnified make-up mirror for awhile, finally decided to see what I could find her. This is everything she was asking and more than expected. Worked out great and Kudos to me! :)</li>
    <li> I tried to like/love this, but as others have posted the lighting is really really low.  The 3-way switch starting acting up within 2 weeks and just gave up yesterday.  The ability to return this item expired May 2nd!!!  So now I&#x27;m stuck with it.  And I&#x27;m stuck having to unplug it to turn off the light!  A piece of $80 junk.</li>
    <li> I had used one like it in a boutique hotel and just had to have it! It&#x27;s a really great one and has regular view and the flip side magnified and then more magnification in the small circle! The light is great and I&#x27;m really happy with it!</li>
    <li> Purchased this in May and stop working 8 months!!!  Over priced junk!</li>
    <li> It is fantastic! Better than I expected to get as a gift. I would recommend it to anyone looking for a multi-magnified lighted mirror for anything to do on their face. Thanks!!</li>
    <li> Rearranged a few things in the house, and suddenly found myself in need of a vanity mirror. I was a bit nervous about this because it isn&#x27;t entirely inexpensive as vanity mirrors go, but it might be cheap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It isn&#x27;t. Excellent build quality and heft. Clear reflection in the three sizes of mirror surface (just learning that I need to do a much better job on the eyebrows -- yikes! -- and I didn&#x27;t see that spot on my cheek before...huh) and three levels of light, which at any level is not glaring or uncomfortable to use. Really good quality. Score.</li>
    <li> My father loved the mirror in the Hilton Riverside New Orleans.  This mirror is close enough to make his wish come true.</li>
    <li> Really like it.  The only negative my wife says about it is the cord gets in the way.  Would have been nice to have a rechargeable battery instead.</li>
    <li> Perfect for what I needed.  Mirror light is not as bright as my makeup lights on the vanity but works well with three settings.</li>
    <li> i would give a 5 star if light was brighter.....very dim</li>
    <li> Couldn&#x27;t get dressed without it. Wow can you see all.</li>
    <li> This is a nice mirror but the light isn&#x27;t bright enough.</li>
    <li> I bought this mirror specifically for the 3-inch spot mirror. I needed the 10X magnification for applying makeup, but the 3-inch spot mirror (15X magnification) is what sold it for me, because it&#x27;s perfect magnification for plucking eyebrows! Love that feature! I like that the light is controlled by a turn-switch, rather than being controlled by tapping the base, because my previous mirror was touch-control and was constantly being turned on or turned off accidentally. I gave four stars because, while I do love using this mirror, I would prefer the mirror to be larger (it&#x27;s a bit smaller than I was used to), and, the when light is on, the mirror gets very hot.</li>
    <li> This product is great.</li>
    <li> Advertised as 10X magnification - it is NOT.  The one I was wanting to replace is a 5X and this one I ordered was weaker.  It is a very nice mirror, just improperly described.</li>
</ol>
