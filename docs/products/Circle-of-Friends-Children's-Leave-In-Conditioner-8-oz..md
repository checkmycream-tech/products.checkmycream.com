      <li>Great product.</li>
      <li>Amazing product!</li>
      <li>Good frizz-hold through moisturizing.  </li>
      <li>In fact, it&#x27;s quite frizzy without a good leave-in conditioner.</li>
      <li>It worth the price :D</li>
      <li>It smells wonderful, but more importantly, it works nicely.  </li>
      <li>This smells AMAZING.</li>
      <li>Has a nice scent though</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a nice benefit.</li>
      <li>This is worth the $8.00!!!</li>
      <li>I have tried all kinds of products on her hair &amp; this by far has been the best conditioner.</li>
      <li>It is very light and fruity smelling.  </li>
      <li>It smells amazing and makes it easy to brush thier hair.</li>
      <li>Perfect for a young child with hair of fine or medium texture.</li>
      <li>Leaves my hair smooth, shinny, and smell nice.</li>
      <li>I have even used it myself as a rinse-out and I love it.</li>
      <li>One thing, if you let your kid put it in her head make sure to use caution with the amount.</li>
      <li>It also smells fabulous!  </li>
      <li>To my surprise, Maya&#x27;s frizzy and curly hair became much more manageable.  </li>
      <li>Smells great and leaves her hair very soft.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s always nice to find a hair product that actually works for us and induces compliments on how good our hair smells.  </li>
      <li>and when they returned the following morning, their hair was still perfect, soft, it was like magic!</li>
      <li>and you know what, they had my childrens needs down perfectly!</li>
      <li>Even in the morning it is smooth and easy to brush.</li>
      <li>Does great to detangle as long as hair is sprayed with water before brushing however this product has an overwhelming fragrance</li>
      <li>The fresh scent is pleasant, and much better than the alcohol smells of most commercial leave in conditioners.</li>
      <li>But it&#x27;s a light product, I don&#x27;t think it would do for kinky curly hair which would need a heavier product.</li>
      <li>It smells light and fruity and the scent isn&#x27;t overpowering at all.</li>
      <li>This fit the bill on both counts.  </li>
      <li>If you are too liberal your kid could have greasy hair when it dries (smooth clean smelling greasy hair).</li>
      <li>Christmas Day, she opened her stocking and Santa brought her this special stuff for her hair- to share with her brother too-</li>
      <li>I have thick wavy hair and this product is perfect.</li>
      <li>This one smells like fresh Papayas.</li>
      <li>Amaya papaya leaves their hair so soft and it&#x27;s easy to comb through.</li>
      <li>It makes our hair soft and easy to comb through.</li>
      <li>Styled with NO PROBLEM AT ALL FOR THE FIRST TIME...</li>
      <li>I have this for my son and not only does he love</li>
      <li>After swimming and showering, their hair is so soft and tangle free that a comb glides through it.  </li>
      <li>A little goes a long way and the scent is very pleasant.</li>
      <li>and guess what, in the mid-afternoon they where going to see their other dad, so I had them both shower, and get dressed up nice....</li>
      <li>and this is the only product I&#x27;ve found that lets me do her hair (relatively) easily.  </li>
      <li>All the products I buy at the big box stores are so strong smelling and make their hair sticky and sometimes frizzy.</li>
      <li>I actually bought it for my dogs, hoping it would be a good detangler for their long hair.</li>
      <li>The combination seems to work really well.</li>
      <li>A real timesaver for hurried mornings.  </li>
      <li>This is the only stuff that works to get her hair brushed and looking nice again.</li>
      <li>My hair is curly and tends to get dry very quickly, this moisturizer keeps it moisturized for the day.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend for parents whose toddlers have curly hair.</li>
      <li>I spent money on Salon s/c, the cheap stuff s/c, followed commercials for s/c,</li>
      <li>I normally use a rinse out hair conditioner which I would not be without..  </li>
      <li>One squirt is more than enought to add to my long, straight, dry hair.</li>
      <li>HIGHLY RECOMMEND, ESPECIALLY THIS PARTICULAR</li>
      <li>I have three kids, a 4 year old 2.5 year old and 9 month old.</li>
      <li>even ordered Lori Davis s/c from the old infomercials....</li>
      <li>I am an adult, and bought this for myself.  </li>
      <li>so do I it leaves his hair feeling soft and managable.</li>
      <li>I wanted a conditioning product for my young daughter that that I wouldn&#x27;t have to worry about rinsing out and getting in her eyes</li>
      <li>My daughter has really curly, very thin hair that matts and tangles up very easily.</li>
      <li>We&#x27;re all pretty physically active - my kids play sports</li>
      <li>I have tried hundreds of products over many years and usually they&#x27;re too light and don&#x27;t weight it down enough, or too heavy and sticky.  </li>
      <li>BUT what I found was that this product did not leave my hair soft and manageable as I had hoped it would.. in fact my hair seemed to be &#x27;flat&#x27; after using it...</li>

<li> My daughter has really curly, very thin hair that matts and tangles up very easily.</li>
<li> We&#x27;re all pretty physically active - my kids play sports</li>
<li> I have tried hundreds of products over many years and usually they&#x27;re too light and don&#x27;t weight it down enough, or too heavy and sticky.  </li>
<li> BUT what I found was that this product did not leave my hair soft and manageable as I had hoped it would.. in fact my hair seemed to be &#x27;flat&#x27; after using it...</li>
<li> She has very soft yet dry tight curls.</li>
<li> We will use this as long as it&#x27;s on the market!</li>
<li> This product had my hair leaving dry and not as I read.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve used it on them on both  wet and dry hair</li>
<li> so I will give this one a second chance and see what happens but am still not sure its something I would want to use in the future.. ...</li>
<li> You can put it in wet or dry hair.</li>
<li> their hair would still remain dry, stiff and especially my daughters hair- tangled.  </li>
<li> So every morning, I wet her hair a little, get a tiny amount of this leave in conditioner, and comb it through her hair as a detangler.  </li>
<li> My 2 daughters are half Caucasian, half Asian and have unruly, curly hair.</li>
<li> My kids and I have extremely curly hair.</li>
<li> so sticky hair products don&#x27;t work well with our active lifestyles.  </li>
<li> The sickening sweet smell of this turned conditioner me off completely!</li>
<li> My daughters have thick 3 type hair , but this didnt work and it did not give enough slip.</li>
<li> It doesn&#x27;t weigh down hair or make it too oily.</li>
<li> This product is not what I expected,it still left their hair a bit stiff and hard to detangle.  </li>
<li> in fact I noticed little benefit at all...  </li>
<li> Even with that their hair gets all crazy and sweaty at school and very tangled.</li>
<li> I usually have to use this product every 1 or two days after using it.</li>
<li> I dont know if I mentioned they have fine chicken feather like hair that is crazy</li>
<li> Unfortunately, I couldn&#x27;t leave it on long enough for it to work because the thought of having a dog that smelled like that was too awful.</li>
<li> My 3-year-old daughter has very thick, curly hair</li>
<li> My girls HATE getting thier hair brushed because it can be quite painful because of how active they are and how thier hair ends up at the end of the day.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s difficult to find a leave-in conditioner that has medium hold and doesn&#x27;t make our hair sticky.</li>
<li> (she&#x27;s quite dramatic!).</li>

    <li> I wanted a conditioning product for my young daughter that that I wouldn&#x27;t have to worry about rinsing out and getting in her eyes (she&#x27;s quite dramatic!). Secondly, we needed something that would allow me to comb through her hair and detangle.  This fit the bill on both counts.  Smells great and leaves her hair very soft.</li>
    <li> I bought this Maya Papaya conditioner on a whim to show my daughter whose name is Maya and Maya Papaya is her nickname.  To my surprise, Maya&#x27;s frizzy and curly hair became much more manageable.  This product is also an excellent detangler.  It is very light and fruity smelling.  Perfect for a young child with hair of fine or medium texture.</li>
    <li> My granddaughters are in a chlorinated swimming pool every day during the summer.  They have curly hair, and the brush-out afterward used to be grueling.  We&#x27;ve learned to apply this conditioner to their hair before they put on their swim caps.  After swimming and showering, their hair is so soft and tangle free that a comb glides through it.  Thank you Maya Papaya!</li>
    <li> Great product. Leaves my hair smooth, shinny, and smell nice. I would order it again n again. It worth the price :D</li>
    <li> My daughter, almost 2, hates to have her hair brushed, but it is so necessary as she has bunches and bunches of curls.  So every morning, I wet her hair a little, get a tiny amount of this leave in conditioner, and comb it through her hair as a detangler.  It smells wonderful and she lets me do it! A real timesaver for hurried mornings.  I highly recommend for parents whose toddlers have curly hair.</li>
    <li> My 2 daughters are half Caucasian, half Asian and have unruly, curly hair. All the products I buy at the big box stores are so strong smelling and make their hair sticky and sometimes frizzy. Amaya papaya leaves their hair so soft and it&#x27;s easy to comb through. I&#x27;ve used it on them on both  wet and dry hair and it&#x27;s never left their hair crunchy. A little goes a long way and the scent is very pleasant.</li>
    <li> well as I have only used this once I think perhaps I should give it another chance.. BUT what I found was that this product did not leave my hair soft and manageable as I had hoped it would.. in fact my hair seemed to be &#x27;flat&#x27; after using it...in fact I noticed little benefit at all...  I normally use a rinse out hair conditioner which I would not be without..  so I will give this one a second chance and see what happens but am still not sure its something I would want to use in the future.. ...</li>
    <li> My daughter has really curly, very thin hair that matts and tangles up very easily. This is the only stuff that works to get her hair brushed and looking nice again. The spray stuff doesn&#x27;t even come close. Smells great!! We will use this as long as it&#x27;s on the market!</li>
    <li> My hair is curly and tends to get dry very quickly, this moisturizer keeps it moisturized for the day. I usually have to use this product every 1 or two days after using it.</li>
    <li> I wanted a leave in for my daughters so it would be easier to detangle.  This product is not what I expected,it still left their hair a bit stiff and hard to detangle.  My daughters have thick 3 type hair , but this didnt work and it did not give enough slip. Will not re-purchase.  Has a nice scent though</li>
    <li> I have thick wavy hair and this product is perfect. It smells light and fruity and the scent isn&#x27;t overpowering at all. But it&#x27;s a light product, I don&#x27;t think it would do for kinky curly hair which would need a heavier product.</li>
    <li> My 3-year-old daughter has very thick, curly hair and this is the only product I&#x27;ve found that lets me do her hair (relatively) easily.  Plus, she loves the smell.  I also like Circle of Friends detangler spray.  The combination seems to work really well.</li>
    <li> This leave-in hair conditioner works great!  My kids and I have extremely curly hair. In fact, it&#x27;s quite frizzy without a good leave-in conditioner. I have tried hundreds of products over many years and usually they&#x27;re too light and don&#x27;t weight it down enough, or too heavy and sticky.  It&#x27;s difficult to find a leave-in conditioner that has medium hold and doesn&#x27;t make our hair sticky. We&#x27;re all pretty physically active - my kids play sports and I exercise five days a week, so sticky hair products don&#x27;t work well with our active lifestyles.  Of all the hundreds of types and brands of hair products I&#x27;ve tried over the years, this is only the third one I&#x27;ve found that works well for us.  It also smells fabulous!  It&#x27;s always nice to find a hair product that actually works for us and induces compliments on how good our hair smells.  It&#x27;s a nice benefit.</li>
    <li> The sickening sweet smell of this turned conditioner me off completely! I actually bought it for my dogs, hoping it would be a good detangler for their long hair. Unfortunately, I couldn&#x27;t leave it on long enough for it to work because the thought of having a dog that smelled like that was too awful. I&#x27;d rather have a stinky dog.</li>
    <li> I am the father of two wonderful kids I adopted as infants from Guatemala.  They are each 50% Guatemalan/50% Mayan, Mestizo as it is nicknamed in Guatemala.&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, after trying... maybe close to 40-50 different types of shampoo and conditioner in their hair, I was so flustered- their hair would still remain dry, stiff and especially my daughters hair- tangled.  I spent money on Salon s/c, the cheap stuff s/c, followed commercials for s/c, even ordered Lori Davis s/c from the old infomercials.... Same result. UNTIL---- Christmas Day, she opened her stocking and Santa brought her this special stuff for her hair- to share with her brother too- and guess what, in the mid-afternoon they where going to see their other dad, so I had them both shower, and get dressed up nice.... And, I put the conditioner in their hair after the showers.... Styled with NO PROBLEM AT ALL FOR THE FIRST TIME... and when they returned the following morning, their hair was still perfect, soft, it was like magic! The company makes all different conditioners based on ethnicity/heritage/culture and you know what, they had my childrens needs down perfectly! HIGHLY RECOMMEND, ESPECIALLY THIS PARTICULAR \\&quot;CIRCLE OF FRIENDS MAYA PAPAYA\\&quot;FOR ANYONE WITH CENTRAL AMERICAN ETHNICITY.....</li>
    <li> I am an adult, and bought this for myself.  It smells wonderful, but more importantly, it works nicely.  Good frizz-hold through moisturizing.  Not greasy, perfect balance.  The fresh scent is pleasant, and much better than the alcohol smells of most commercial leave in conditioners. This one smells like fresh Papayas.</li>
    <li> My daughter is 1/2 Native American &amp; 1/2 African American. She has very soft yet dry tight curls. Her hair is moody &amp; a pain to brush for both of us. I have tried all kinds of products on her hair &amp; this by far has been the best conditioner. It detangles and moisturizes but doesn&#x27;t leave any greasiness or weight on her hair. I have even used it myself as a rinse-out and I love it. This is worth the $8.00!!! As an added bonus this stuff smells great!</li>
    <li> This product had my hair leaving dry and not as I read. the only thing is the scent of it but this is not the product that would recommend.</li>
    <li> I have three kids, a 4 year old 2.5 year old and 9 month old. My two oldest daughters began taking swim lessons at the age if 12 monhts. THey have been taking class twice a week for basically the last three years. They spend a lot of time in a pool that dries out thier hair and gets it all tangled. I use a circle of friends swimmer spray before they go in (when I can tackle them to the ground and spray it on thier baby chick feather like hair). Even with that their hair gets all crazy and sweaty at school and very tangled. I dont know if I mentioned they have fine chicken feather like hair that is crazy but they do. My girls HATE getting thier hair brushed because it can be quite painful because of how active they are and how thier hair ends up at the end of the day. Even when I shower them it gets tangled in teh shower. I&#x27;m not sure exactly how they manage it but they do. Anyways this leave in conditioner is a LIFE SAVER! I just pump a quirt or two in my hands after the shower and smoothe it through thier hair. It smells amazing and makes it easy to brush thier hair. I use a comb and its very simple. Even in the morning it is smooth and easy to brush. Amazing product! One thing, if you let your kid put it in her head make sure to use caution with the amount. If you are too liberal your kid could have greasy hair when it dries (smooth clean smelling greasy hair).</li>
    <li> Does great to detangle as long as hair is sprayed with water before brushing however this product has an overwhelming fragrance and I prefer products without one.</li>
    <li> This smells AMAZING. I use it in my hair and my daughters hair. It makes our hair soft and easy to comb through. I will buy again.</li>
    <li> I have this for my son and not only does he love so do I it leaves his hair feeling soft and managable.</li>
    <li> I have to confess: I bought this for my daughter, but then I stole it for me. It smells wonderful. One squirt is more than enought to add to my long, straight, dry hair. You can put it in wet or dry hair. It doesn&#x27;t weigh down hair or make it too oily.</li>
