      <li>The Corlys Violets Cologne is a very appealing fragrance to me.</li>
      <li>glad to find it!</li>
      <li>The price is great, ( I bought 4 and got free shipping too )</li>
      <li>Was thrilled to find it and bath my daughter in it..</li>
      <li>Love loved it...</li>
      <li>Very, very pleased. :)</li>
      <li>they came quickly, they were packed very well, the bottles are really nice with a pretty wrap, and best of all, IT SMELLS GREAT !!</li>
      <li>Love it.</li>
      <li>I am going to re-order for sure.  </li>
      <li>Was able to find it  on line,thank you Amazon..</li>
      <li>Many of the Violetta colognes have a strange/chemical odor.  </li>
      <li>It smells lovely, like the violet pastilles my grandma used to carry in her purse.  </li>
      <li>our wonderful cuban neighbors,used the Royal Violets by Agustin Reyes,thats all they had back then....</li>
      <li>If you&#x27;re hoping to find sweet violet, don&#x27;t buy this stuff !</li>
      <li>but of powder which I enjoy.</li>
      <li>I love Corlys Violets Cologne it has such a light sweet scent, I even use a splash on my puppy after his bath !!!</li>
      <li>It smells exactly like that Violet candy that I love plus a</li>
      <li>and it smells just as strong as when I first put it on.</li>
      <li>I will be ordering more for my mom,which brought back good memories of south fla back in the day......</li>
      <li>I do realise that true violet scent is ephemeral, in the sense that you lose the ability to smell it quite quickly, so it may be that other companies try to \\&quot;up\\&quot; the scent factor, but there has to be a happy medium between the natural elusive scent of violets and a full-bore chemical assault.</li>
      <li>Corlys seems to have gotten it right.</li>
      <li>I will continue looking for a pretty floral violet without the powder.</li>
      <li>I love it &amp; it is now my daily cologne!</li>
      <li>It was too cloying ,not fresh smelling, like someone who would use it instead of bathing kind of cover up.</li>
      <li>This Violet perfume is the real deal.</li>
      <li>You rub your hands with it as a disinfectant and gently pat your hands on your face a bit to freshen up.  </li>
      <li>This one is the real deal.  </li>
      <li>It smells like very strong baby powder, and is so heavy and lingering it made me feel as though I was suffocating.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>Classic.</li>
      <li>It is ever so slightly gourmand without being sickeningly sweet - a powdery violet with just a hint of candy.  </li>
      <li>The bottle was much larger than I expected, the scent very much violet and soft.</li>
      <li>I tried many other violet scented colognes but there always seemed to be harsh off-notes.</li>
      <li>ITS REALLY SOFT ALMOST LIKE BABY POWDER MIXED WITH VIOLET.GREAT DEAL FOR THE PRICE.</li>

    <li> This Violet perfume is the real deal. It smells exactly like that Violet candy that I love plus a but of powder which I enjoy. The scent seems to last on me a long time like I put some on a few hours ago and it smells just as strong as when I first put it on.</li>
    <li> The Corlys Violets Cologne is a very appealing fragrance to me. My nose detects a slight green note to it which adds to its appeal. The only problem is that there is something in it which doesn&#x27;t agree with my sinus area, because I received a headache after using it. I will try again to see if it truly is headache causing to me. I hope I can adjust, because it is a wonderful scent.</li>
    <li> Love this awesome a splash on babies after bath!!</li>
    <li> I used this cologne for myself, but I think it would be a great cologne for newborns. Has a baby powder smell with a slight hint of violet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I absolutely loved this product.</li>

    <li> When I lived in Turkey, I became fond of a tradition they have in restaurants.  At the end of the meal, your server brings a bottle of &amp;#34;cologne&amp;#34; to the table and pours some in your hand.  You rub your hands with it as a disinfectant and gently pat your hands on your face a bit to freshen up.  This is the type of cologne you would use for that as it is inexpensive and not overbearing.  It smells lovely, like the violet pastilles my grandma used to carry in her purse.  It is ever so slightly gourmand without being sickeningly sweet - a powdery violet with just a hint of candy.  I keep it on my bathroom counter vanity, as well a small atomizer of it in my purse to use after changing diapers on the go, etc.  I am going to re-order for sure.  At this price, I&#x27;ll take a ten gallon drum!</li>
    <li> Not all Violettas are created equal.  This one is the real deal.  Many of the Violetta colognes have a strange/chemical odor.  Not this one!  My kids love to put it on and they smell like delicious cuban babies!  Everyone is happy!</li>
    <li> This smells too powdery for my taste but some may like that. I will continue looking for a pretty floral violet without the powder.</li>
    <li> Everything is coming up Violets! If you like violets you will so-o-o-o-o appreciate this. You do not need to splash this on, use it like a cologne.</li>
    <li> I love Corlys Violets Cologne!!  Every time I use it (which is every day) I get compliments on how nice it smells!  I love it &amp; it is now my daily cologne!</li>
    <li> Love it. Is delicious</li>
    <li> and it is delight to use and have this cologne very nice</li>
    <li> Wish the fragrance would last longer...</li>
    <li> This smells amazing!!!</li>
    <li> The price is great, ( I bought 4 and got free shipping too )they came quickly, they were packed very well, the bottles are really nice with a pretty wrap, and best of all, IT SMELLS GREAT !! Very, very pleased. :)</li>
    <li> LOVED THIS COLOGNE. ITS REALLY SOFT ALMOST LIKE BABY POWDER MIXED WITH VIOLET.GREAT DEAL FOR THE PRICE. I WILL GET IT AGAIN.</li>
    <li> Horrible! Smells Awful!!!!</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re hoping to find sweet violet, don&#x27;t buy this stuff ! It smells like very strong baby powder, and is so heavy and lingering it made me feel as though I was suffocating.&lt;br /&gt;I even had to wash my hands with baking soda to eliminate the terrible stench.</li>
    <li> I love Corlys Violets Cologne it has such a light sweet scent, I even use a splash on my puppy after his bath !!!</li>
    <li> Did not care for the fragrance. It was too cloying ,not fresh smelling, like someone who would use it instead of bathing kind of cover up.</li>
    <li> it was the scent we were looking for! it reminded us of our youth in the islands when our mothers,sisters and lady cousins use to wear them. we are re-living those moments with this unforgetable scent! glad to find it!</li>
    <li> The best Violet Cologne ever.  My grandchildren have been using it since they were born. All of them.</li>
    <li> Raised in Hialeah in the 50s.....left in1975...our wonderful cuban neighbors,used the Royal Violets by Agustin Reyes,thats all they had back then....Love loved it...Once I had my baby girl in 1981.,Back home to visit Miami Springs. Was thrilled to find it and bath my daughter in it..Now a GrandMother in St.Augustine,Fl.  Was able to find it  on line,thank you Amazon..I ordered both..My 1st choice now is Corlys Violets..softer smell...But happy with both..I will be ordering more for my mom,which brought back good memories of south fla back in the day......</li>
    <li> Classic. I know its a splash bottle, put it in a travel size atomizer to take anywhere anytime to refresh.</li>
