<li> worst ever does exactly what my brush can do if i just spin it in circles..terrible product</li>
<li> and I&#x27;m getting mad compliments.</li>

    <li> This sponge is awesome.  It is a great tool to help your hair look great!</li>
    <li> This was a great investment. Anyone spending $35 for the other coil sponge is wasting their money.</li>
    <li> This thing arrived quickly! I was very impressed with shipping. I received this brush and immediately had to find out how I&#x27;d look. I tried it from watching all the Youtube videos and reading online reviews. I have to say that I am impressed! I have very light almost platinum Blonde natural hair and the product makes it look so cool in between bleaches all while giving me an edgy, new natural look. Many reviews tell of these kind of products leaving residue on your hair it is too early for me to tell whether or not this product does. I will keep you updated.</li>
    <li> Love it got it much sooner then the estimated date of arrival. Got a new doo and I&#x27;m getting mad compliments.</li>
    <li> Loved this brush! It got the job done, I&#x27;m very happy.</li>
    <li> It works just how it says but I find the brush to be oversized. It&#x27;s not something that you can carry in a purse or bag.</li>
    <li> Great product very satisfied A+</li>
    <li> worst ever does exactly what my brush can do if i just spin it in circles..terrible product</li>
    <li> The curl sponge met all my expectations.</li>
    <li> Everything about it is right except that the holes close to the edge are cut off so its like a half a circle hole</li>
    <li> The sponge is falling apart and it leaves the pieces that fell off in my hair.</li>
    <li> Great product creates nice twists/curls with wet/dry hair. Only problem is when you press down to hard over a period of time the sponge will begin to deteriorate.</li>

    <li> Works good. Durable too</li>
    <li> My son asked for this sponge and he uses it everyday. He says it meets his expectations.</li>
    <li> Great product for starter locs, or for a curly look to your hair</li>
    <li> Great product love it</li>
    <li> It wasn&#x27;t bad, but I like the old version better because it was softer with the holes all being the same, creating a uniform look.</li>
    <li> Love it!! Works great!!!</li>
    <li> It serves its purpose of being a sponge for hair. But if you have big, strong hands, dont do it.. Its starting to crumble in my hands after only 2 uses. It doesn&#x27;t say titan like the picture shows. I guess I got an old version. And the holes are getting larger..</li>
    <li> Sponge works, but wears out fairly fast if you are using it often.</li>
    <li> My grandson loves this brush</li>
