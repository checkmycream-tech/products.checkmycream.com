      <li>Fantastic!</li>
      <li>but this cream isn&#x27;t magic.</li>
      <li>This night cream is truly fabulous!</li>
      <li>We are always looking for that magic ingredient - maybe it is how they mix it -</li>
      <li>and I just love this product.</li>
      <li>This is much better &amp; you pay the price you see &amp; don&#x27;t get charged every month.</li>
      <li>I really can&#x27;t tell a lot of difference in the Argireline, but my skin looks good after using it for approx 4 weeks.</li>
      <li>This cream is pretty nice.  </li>
      <li>So far, it is a pleasant product to use every day.</li>
      <li>works fantastic at plumping the skin and decreasing the amount of fine lines around the eyes -</li>
      <li>its worth 100 times more than all those pricey beauty products out there.  </li>
      <li>Goes on smoothly.</li>
      <li>It is light, doesn&#x27;t cause sensitivity, came from Greece quickly and easily.</li>
      <li>But I would recommend a good micro scrub to be added to your daily or nightly regime.</li>
      <li>Thanks Amazon !!</li>
      <li>As a night cream, it really makes skin look well hydrated and smooth.  </li>
      <li>Definitely worth a try.</li>
      <li>Keeps my skin fresh and glowing.  </li>
      <li>:) I can only be happy that the price on this product has gone down too</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not terribly expensive and is worth it.  </li>
      <li>Very reasonable.</li>
      <li>and I haven&#x27;t even finished my first jar</li>
      <li>has a fresh scent doesn&#x27;t burn or sting and I have very sensible skin.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s extremely lightweight, has a nice smell, and goes on silky.</li>
      <li>No bad reaction on my sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>and yes, the results are for real.</li>
      <li>I really like this stuff.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;The combination of Matrixyl, Argireline, Hyaluronic Acid and manual stimulation really does stimulate the production of collagen beneath the skin, filling the wrinkles and reversing the aging.</li>
      <li>Some friendly advice, micro-scrub works wonders which allows this product to be extra beneficial.  </li>
      <li>highly recommend this product for any age.</li>
      <li>I will use the full jar before final judgement but think I will add my old standbys just to not allow the wrinkles to get too out of hand.  </li>
      <li>I put this on after the occasional use of my derma roller to open my pores and it&#x27;s helped me smooth out my crow&#x27;s feet.</li>
      <li>- After lots of research, I bought this along with Crazy Beautiful Face Cream and a derma roller.</li>
      <li>pours, fine lines and uneven skin tones have diminished.</li>
      <li>This by far exceeds all my expectations.</li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t be fooled by the free anti-aging cream they have on the PC they say just pay shipping it ends up with you paying a few hundred.</li>
      <li>I am 58 years old</li>
      <li>Makes my skin feel so soft.</li>
      <li>My skin feels supple, young, and glowing when I use this product.  </li>
      <li>I scrub my face twice a day (only because I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin).</li>

    <li> got this for my mom and she loves it wears it every night before bed time.</li>
    <li> This is the best anti-aging cream I have used. Don&#x27;t be fooled by the free anti-aging cream they have on the PC they say just pay shipping it ends up with you paying a few hundred. This is much better &amp; you pay the price you see &amp; don&#x27;t get charged every month.</li>
    <li> AMAZING - After lots of research, I bought this along with Crazy Beautiful Face Cream and a derma roller. My wife has been them for only 3 weeks, along with a moisturizer to give the Matrixyl, water to bind with. THIS WORKS. The years are rolling back. She looks amazing and I can&#x27;t believe it&#x27;s just getting started.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The combination of Matrixyl, Argireline, Hyaluronic Acid and manual stimulation really does stimulate the production of collagen beneath the skin, filling the wrinkles and reversing the aging. Don&#x27;t waste your money on expensive serums. The three chemicals and manual stimulation are the keys to turning that clock backwards.</li>
    <li> me encanto este producto, lo volvere a comprar, quisiera los demas productos de esta marca, los efectos son rapidos  e increibles. gracias</li>
    <li> This cream is pretty nice.  It helps with the wrinkles.  I will be buying this again unless I find something better.</li>
    <li> I like the texture and feel of this cream. A very good buy for the price. I really can&#x27;t tell a lot of difference in the Argireline, but my skin looks good after using it for approx 4 weeks.</li>
    <li> It has made a big change in my face looking younger. And helping my wrinkles to fad away.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product for any age.</li>
    <li> Not what I expected, wrinkles and sags still there, how long am I suppose to use this? I know I have only used this 2 weeks but Botox users get immediate results.</li>
    <li> This product takes a long time to arrive.  still have not received it.  been almost 3 weeks and they dont provide tracking information to track the package.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this cream!  works fantastic at plumping the skin and decreasing the amount of fine lines around the eyes - I look 20 years younger when I use it - great quality for the price - will repurchase for sure!!</li>
    <li> I found this after hearing about the ingredients on Dr. Oz. It is light, doesn&#x27;t cause sensitivity, came from Greece quickly and easily. Will buy again. Very reasonable.</li>
    <li> This is the second time I have ordered this product.  I use it under the eyes and in the crow&#x27;s feet area and between my eyes.  It has a temporary botox effect relaxing those wrinkles and giving a younger look.  It takes a while to arrive since it is mailed from Europe, but once you try it, you&#x27;ll want to keep it on hand.</li>
    <li> I really like this stuff.  As a night cream, it really makes skin look well hydrated and smooth.  It&#x27;s not terribly expensive and is worth it.  Only complaint is shipping time(2 weeks).  Have bought it before and will againl</li>
    <li> The best neck cream have ever used but does not get rid of wrinkles just softens them</li>
    <li> My wife has not stopped using this product. It&#x27;s a shame we have to order it from Greece and cannot purchase it in stores here in the U.S. but it keeps my wife smiling and yes, the results are for real.</li>
    <li> This night cream is truly fabulous! It&#x27;s extremely lightweight, has a nice smell, and goes on silky. I discovered this one after doing some research on hyaluronic acid and its benefits. I put this on after the occasional use of my derma roller to open my pores and it&#x27;s helped me smooth out my crow&#x27;s feet. People always comment on my skin! :) I can only be happy that the price on this product has gone down too, it&#x27;s a steal if you ask me! After I tried it, I bought one for my mom and now she&#x27;s hooked. Definitely worth a try.</li>
    <li> This is a game changer, my skin improved just about overnight. It does what it says. Smells and feels wonderful on my skin. If you&#x27;re serious about helping yourself look younger, this would be the product to buy.</li>
    <li> I love the texture and ease with which it is applied..  Just hope it does the job.  So far, it is a pleasant product to use every day.</li>
    <li> This product is really great it made my skin softer and definitley less deep lines on my forehead. My cheek had a lot of deep wrinkles and they are less noticible</li>
    <li> My skin feels supple, young, and glowing when I use this product.  Thanky you Regal Anti-Aging Night Cream!&lt;br /&gt;You are the best!  I would definitely buy this again and intend to.  You folks should give it a try.......It&#x27;s like nothing you have ever experienced.</li>
    <li> has a fresh scent doesn&#x27;t burn or sting and I have very sensible skin. my lines are slowly fading and my skin seems uplifted and pores diminishing. I would recommend this to everyone</li>
    <li> Very disappointed.  Dr. Oz said the ingredients are spot on for decreasing deep wrinkles but not so.  I did see tightening and firming but not more than with other products.  I do love the scent!  I will use the full jar before final judgement but think I will add my old standbys just to not allow the wrinkles to get too out of hand.  We are always looking for that magic ingredient - maybe it is how they mix it - but this cream isn&#x27;t magic.</li>
    <li> I love this product! It will be in my nightly regime from now on.  This is my second jar and I notice my face doesn&#x27;t get that wrinkled pillow look in the morning that, at my age, would last for hours.  Keeps my skin fresh and glowing.  Makes me happy! It is thick but I only use a dab and it goes a long way.  Night time when the skin can absorb and heal, this product is wonderful. I have problem skin and I have not had a break out on it.  Some friendly advice, micro-scrub works wonders which allows this product to be extra beneficial.  I scrub my face twice a day (only because I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin). But I would recommend a good micro scrub to be added to your daily or nightly regime.</li>
    <li> Love this cream absolutely love it!!!! Makes my skin feel so soft. Believe it or not my Husband even noticed a difference!! Thanks Amazon !!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this for about a year and keep re-ordering it. Goes on smoothly. No bad reaction on my sensitive skin. Contains agirilene a wrinkly reducer. Relatively inexpensive.</li>
    <li> Saw no change!! used every night would not buy again was pricey would not recommend to buy it  save your money!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I have been using this serum almost 4 weeks.  I have to say it is absolutely the best cream I have ever used. I have spent a fortune on creams and beauty products.  This by far exceeds all my expectations. my face has made some pretty awesome changes and for the better without a doubt.  pours, fine lines and uneven skin tones have diminished. I am 58 years old and I just love this product. and I have to say.  I just can&#x27;t believe the price of this product.  its worth 100 times more than all those pricey beauty products out there.  GREAT STUFF!!  Just ordered my second jar and I haven&#x27;t even finished my first jar</li>
    <li> Excellent product...My neck is truly firming up...along with crows feet..</li>
    <li> This night cream softens my skin but ooh does it have a nasty smell to it. I not order it again</li>
    <li> Fantastic! Works GREAT!</li>
