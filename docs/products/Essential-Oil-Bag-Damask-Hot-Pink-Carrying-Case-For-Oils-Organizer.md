    <li> I like the design and fabric BUT there is no padding what so ever. I got it to carry glass oil bottles in but probably won&#x27;t use it much because of no padding to protect the glass bottles. A little disappointed!</li>
    <li> Very cute bag for my essential oils.  Seems to be made well but I thought the material could be a little heavier but all in all I feel I will enjoy this bag.  Bought it for traveling!  Received promptly and package well.</li>

    <li> practical to carry essential oils</li>
    <li> Love the fabric. Only down side is the mesh inside its hard the get the bottles out with ease. But it does what it needed to.</li>
    <li> Would definitely order again</li>

    <li> Great for traveling and protecting essential oil bottles. Each bottle is held upright in its own compartment. The pattern and style is really nice as well.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a nice bag but I was hoping for vinyl lining just in case the oils leaked.</li>
    <li> Very quick shipping and it is perfect for carrying my Young Living Oils and a 2 oz bottle of carrier oil. It fits perfectly in my coach purse so I can have my favorite oils with me at all times. Thank you!</li>
    <li> Was exactly as I needed. I love it and have used it on many trips so far.</li>
    <li> This is so perfect for carrying Young Living Essential Oils in your purse!  Even fits the longer bottle like Deep Relief.  I will be recommending this product to all my YL friends!</li>
    <li> So pretty. Just what I was looking for.</li>
    <li> Great price! Holds oils perfectly</li>
    <li> Love the size and quality.  The pockets seem very well made and I think will last a long time.  Zipper is good quality too.

    <li> It does is job but I&#x27;m looking for something better...</li>
    <li> This is a really safe way to travel with your oils. I even used it to bring some oils over to a friends home to let her try some. I have even put a larger glass spray bottle in it and stood it upright in bag to keep it from breaking or spilling.  I only wish it came in brown instead of black..</li>
    <li> This is a great bag; it is even better in person! The shipping was also super fast! Thank you for a smooth transaction :).</li>
    <li> Just what I thought it would be</li>
    <li> Flimsy material &amp; structure. Not accurate with picture</li>
    <li> Zipper broke shortly after I first used it. Useless to me at this point.</li>
