      <li>It&#x27;s a good shampoo/conditioner combo for my 6 year old son.</li>
      <li>The shampoo smells good and makes my daughters hair soft without conditioner</li>
      <li>isn&#x27;t very economical for hers</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s hard to find a shampoo for kids that doesn&#x27;t have a mix of conditioner as well, so I was happy when I found this one from L&#x27;Oreal (love the brand).</li>
      <li>Great price, soft on my scalp for an adult.</li>
      <li>This stuff is super concentrated.  </li>
      <li>It made the bath mor fun and no complaints about soap in their eyes.</li>

      <li>Very gentle.</li>
      <li>My daughter has lots of hair (long, but very fine) and it tangles a lot, so I need to purchase conditioner separately.</li>

      <li>The bottle says it&#x27;s extra gentle and tear free</li>
      <li>I cant comment if this is really &amp;#34;no-tears&amp;#34;, but I have yet to hear any complaints.</li>

      <li>Much easier on the skin and fewer chemicals.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s the whole reason why we bought it...</li>
      <li>After using this I was surprised that his hair was much softer!</li>
      <li>They don&#x27;t mind getting a little soap in their eye and &amp;#34;Turbo&amp;#34; is a favorite movie of theirs.  </li>
      <li>They aren&#x27;t quite ready to use the adult shampoos and conditioners but they also don&#x27;t want to use the shampoos and conditioners labeled for a \\&quot;baby\\&quot;.  </li>
      <li>normal quility</li>
      <li>but still can&#x27;t use adult shampoos and conditioners, get this!</li>
      <li>My children are now five and eight years old.  </li>
      <li>my child in big delight, thanks</li>

      <li>My 4 year old grandson has used this for 2 years.  </li>
      <li>So if you have young children who aren&#x27;t \\&quot;babies\\&quot; anymore</li>
      <li>I will be very lost when it is discontinued, as I haven&#x27;t found a close second choice for my family.</li>
      <li>Come on guys the ENTIRE reason i purchased this particular type of this shampoo was because my son loves turbo the movie, not how to train your dragon.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not happy, my sons favorite character is mater</li>
      <li>This does not dry out his hair and he loves the smell.</li>

    <li> low bubble. orange smell. normal quility</li>

    <li> ...it made my son&#x27;s skin itchy after a shower.  We have since switched to Method body soap.  Much easier on the skin and fewer chemicals.</li>
    <li> Good price with a nice smell.</li>
    <li> Kid loves taking a shower since I bought this!</li>

    <li> The kids loved it and it smelled good too.  It made the bath mor fun and no complaints about soap in their eyes.</li>
    <li> I ordered L&#x27;Oreal Paris Kids Mango Orange Mater Shampoo and I got a 1/2 spilled Panguins from Madagasscar Shampoo... I&#x27;m not happy, my sons favorite character is mater it&#x27;s the whole reason why we bought it... Now I have a 1/2 bottle of shampoo bc it leaked wouldn&#x27;t buy again</li>
    <li> Great shampoo and very soothing for hair</li>
    <li> Ok i know it says&amp;#34; packaging may vary&amp;#34; HOWEVER do not advertise it as Turbo if ya&#x27;ll are going to send how to train your dragon! I thought it meant we may not get turbo but burn, skidmark, chet, ect. Come on guys the ENTIRE reason i purchased this particular type of this shampoo was because my son loves turbo the movie, not how to train your dragon. Very unhappy. Will not do this again.</li>
    <li> Smells great, cleans the kids hair perfectly.</li>
    <li> Good price for good kids shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;Love this product. Nice smell .</li>
    <li> The kids love it  and it smells great! IT was a great price too! We will get it again! It is now on our Subsribe and Save list!</li>
    <li> Nice smell. Kids use without difficulty.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s hard to find a shampoo for kids that doesn&#x27;t have a mix of conditioner as well, so I was happy when I found this one from L&#x27;Oreal (love the brand). My daughter has lots of hair (long, but very fine) and it tangles a lot, so I need to purchase conditioner separately. I buy both - shampoo and conditioner - from the same maker and I am very happy with the results: tangle free, clean, nice smelling hair!</li>
    <li> I am on auto subscribe for this shampoo.  My grandsons love it and I get it at a good price to boot!</li>
    <li> nice kids shampoo with lots of suds.</li>
    <li> I was using California Baby shampoo &amp; body wash on my toddler, which I&#x27;d been using since he was a baby. I figured it was time for something more fitting for his age. After using this I was surprised that his hair was much softer! The smell is nice too. Mine came with a picture of How to Train Your Dragon 2, is just &amp;#34;orange&amp;#34; (not orange mango), and says &amp;#34;2 in 1 shampoo&amp;#34; on the bottle.</li>
    <li> This shampoo smells great and the kids actually like using it!  Win-win!  I cant comment if this is really &amp;#34;no-tears&amp;#34;, but I have yet to hear any complaints.</li>
    <li> Very good item, good price, good character for my son. this is best.</li>
    <li> My son loves it.&lt;br /&gt;Nice smell and gentle on the eyes</li>
    <li> This is a great all-around shampoo.  I use it on grandchildren, but also keep it in the guest bathroom for guests of all ages.  I use it myself, and it is what I fill my travel vials with, because you never need a conditioner with it.  It is just great, and must be PH balanced, because I have sensitive skin.  When it arrives, I pour it into a decent looking bottle, since I can&#x27;t bear the ugly cartoons, but it works very well, and I live with it!  I will be very lost when it is discontinued, as I haven&#x27;t found a close second choice for my family.</li>
    <li> It is a gift.My friend&#x27;s daughter like it.</li>
    <li> It works, but the size and price are silly considering what you spend for it elsewhere. I ended up buying shampoo for my son from bath and body on sale. Better value, and he appreciates that it looks a little more grown up (10 y/o).</li>
    <li> Great price, soft on my scalp for an adult.</li>
    <li> perfect for kids. smells nice and lathers well</li>
    <li> My kids love it and the smell.  They don&#x27;t mind getting a little soap in their eye and &amp;#34;Turbo&amp;#34; is a favorite movie of theirs.  Might be nice to try this on my hair!</li>
    <li> I adore how this smells in my son&#x27;s hair :)  He loves the cute snail on the front from Turbo.  One bottle arrived with a dragon from a movie he has never seen and he still thought it was very cool.</li>
    <li> The shampoo smells good and makes my daughters hair soft without conditioner</li>
