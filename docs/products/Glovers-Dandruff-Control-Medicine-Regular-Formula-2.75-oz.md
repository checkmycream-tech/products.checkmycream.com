      <li>if you really have stubborn dandruff  -- this is the product to use -  works like magic.</li>
      <li>this seller and it arrived rather quickly.</li>
      <li>a old school product you can mix with your favorite grease and watch how your hair really grows.</li>
      <li>Works well mixed in with your favorite scalp grease.</li>
      <li>it grew it wonderfully not only controlled the dandruff but made our hair healthy.</li>
      <li>I am sure if you just wash your hair it should have the same result.</li>
      <li>Exactly what I wanted</li>
      <li>I Cant say enough about how Glover&#x27;s really helps the scalp and makes the hair healthy.</li>
      <li>and I got to feeling very dizzy after applying it.  </li>
      <li>It comes highly recommended!</li>
      <li>Didn&#x27;t see much if a difference.</li>
      <li>and I must say it smells much lighter than it did years ago...</li>
      <li>Love it, I am seeing much growth since combining it with my other hair regiment.</li>

      <li>NEW stuff is called dandruff control</li>
      <li>Its stinky but works I got this for my step daughter and I and no more inching and flasks love it</li>
      <li>Seems to be diluted with other ingredients to reduce the sulfur smell, which probably makes it less effective.</li>
      <li>the dandruff was gone and my hair grew so fast i mixed in in with my hair grease and applied it maybe twice a month</li>
      <li>I&#x27; am putting this in my 14 month old daughter hair so can some one please let me know how they used it</li>
      <li>Wake up with a mess, but after shampooing, it&#x27;s all clean and clear scalp.</li>
      <li>It is not the same dark strong scented product from years ago.</li>
      <li>I used it a couple times, saw little to no difference which wasn&#x27;t worth the greasiness.</li>
      <li>I couldn&#x27;t tell how the old ingredients differed from the new because the Mange Med. was written in plain English and the Dandruff Control was written in the chemical formula.  </li>

<li> Well he did not tell her how long to leave it on.</li>
<li> The smell is a challenge, but I mixed it wirh other hair products to help mask it.</li>
<li> Came on time as expected....</li>
<li> However,  I hope it still has the same strength and affect to make hair growth as it use to :/</li>
<li> So far, this is the ONLY thing that has worked completely, other than expensive Nizoral, and this one works almost immediately.&lt;br</li>
<li> Unfortunately I ran out and couldn&#x27;t find the old stuff and bought the Glovers Dandruff Control Med.  </li>
<li> Now that I&#x27;m older, I have lost hair due to bad dye jobs and perms.  </li>
<li> I got an old bottle of Glovers Mange Medicine and it really worked... smelled horrible, but worked.  </li>
<li> Not sure.</li>
<li> Comb and wash out the flakes and then enjoy freedom from this horrid disgusting debilitating disorder!!!</li>
<li> smells a little bad but its tolerable.</li>
<li> The smell is not that bad.</li>
<li> It smells awful</li>

    <li> Always a good product.  Just can get it in Florida.</li>
    <li> Love the product for flaky scabs on scalp. Glovers is a namebrand that I always trust to deliver.</li>
    <li> It is not the same dark strong scented product from years ago. I&#x27;ll give it a few weeks to see how it works on the hair, but I don&#x27;t expect much.</li>
    <li> It smells, but it gets the job done!!!!</li>
    <li> Stinky but really a good product for your hair.  This stuff really works to help make your scalp healthy.</li>
    <li> I used it a couple times, saw little to no difference which wasn&#x27;t worth the greasiness.</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t used enough yet.  Not sure.</li>
    <li> if you really have stubborn dandruff  -- this is the product to use -  works like magic. Would recommend to my friends</li>
    <li> I see improvement; will continue to use.</li>
    <li> Nice! Nice product for the ladies. My wifw loves this product as it compliments her body chemestry. Next I need to get some stuff for myself. lol</li>
    <li> Seems to be diluted with other ingredients to reduce the sulfur smell, which probably makes it less effective. Didn&#x27;t solve my scalp probme.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this twice now. Use these (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00I80XBMS/ref&#x3D;oh_details_o03_s01_i01?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;psc&#x3D;1) to get rid of excess skin, and then rub this into my scalp and cover it with a towel for the night. Wake up with a mess, but after shampooing, it&#x27;s all clean and clear scalp. So far, this is the ONLY thing that has worked completely, other than expensive Nizoral, and this one works almost immediately.&lt;br /&gt;It does smell like sulfur...not the best of smells. Makes my dogs sneeze and my spouse wrinkle her nose.</li>
    <li> I got an old bottle of Glovers Mange Medicine and it really worked... smelled horrible, but worked.  Unfortunately I ran out and couldn&#x27;t find the old stuff and bought the Glovers Dandruff Control Med.  I didn&#x27;t work as well and I got to feeling very dizzy after applying it.  I rinsed it out, but it took awhile for the dizziness to go away.  I definitely think it was from the Glovers Dandruff Control Med.  I couldn&#x27;t tell how the old ingredients differed from the new because the Mange Med. was written in plain English and the Dandruff Control was written in the chemical formula.  But I am scared to use this Dandruff Control Med again.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t see much if a difference.</li>
    <li> This is a very good product for eliminating a dry scalp of dandruff.  I would recommend it for anyone who has a dandruff problem.</li>
    <li> The item arrived in a timely manner. I have been using it for a coupla weeks now, and I&#x27;m pleased with how I am regrowing hair in my problem areas. The smell is a challenge, but I mixed it wirh other hair products to help mask it. Overall I am a happy customer!  :)</li>
    <li> It works great to control my itchy scalp been using for years. Great item I love it highly recommended. .</li>

    <li> I like this product I used it like the reviews say too do it&#x27;s a keeper</li>
    <li> Works like I thought it would. My hair has grown and breakage has been reduced since I started using the product a out 5 weeks ago. The smell is not that bad.</li>

    <li> I HAVE KNOTS AND TANGLES PROBLEMS TRYING TO GET IT OUT OVER 30 YEARS NOTHING WORK.&lt;br /&gt;GLOVERS MANE GROW MY HAIR THAT IS THE GOOD THING. I CAN NOT GET THE KNOTS AND TANGLES&lt;br /&gt;OUT. CAN YOU HELP ME?  THANK YOU</li>
    <li> I chose this product because it has been the same one my grandmother has use for years. I told her I could find it for her online since she couldn&#x27;t find it in the store at the time. I hurried to purchase it. She was nagging. So now she&#x27;s satisfied.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s magic . Grows hair.</li>
    <li> Excellent product. Feels great on the scalp; just ignore the smell it just works.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommned it for deep conditioning and repair.</li>

    <li> I love Glovers Dandruff Medicine, it made my hair growth, especially my edges that are so difficult. I would recommend this product to everyone.</li>
    <li> I Cant say enough about how Glover&#x27;s really helps the scalp and makes the hair healthy. I will buy this product again.</li>
    <li> Works but smells yuk, just like sulfur.. Makes my scalp itch</li>
    <li> I just ordered this and I plan to mix it with Sulfers 8 to make my hair grow. From what I have seen and read, Sulfer is good for promoting hair growth and the body needs it...I will also be using MTG by Shaley&#x27;s because it also contains Sulfer...    UPDATE: 11/06/2014 I received my order yesterday and used it on my hair last night and I must say it smells much lighter than it did years ago...However,  I hope it still has the same strength and affect to make hair growth as it use to :/</li>
    <li> I used this product many, many years ago and could not find it anywhere.  It is still the same good product except it did not seem to smell as strong as it used to.  I was very pleased with this purchase.</li>
    <li> Reminds me of childhood!</li>
    <li> a old school product you can mix with your favorite grease and watch how your hair really grows. Amazing product!</li>
    <li> this is a great product when i used it consistently the dandruff was gone and my hair grew so fast i mixed in in with my hair grease and applied it maybe twice a month</li>
    <li> This was used on our heads when we were kids. 40 years later, it still works wonders. I am glad I made the purchase.</li>
    <li> great for hair when you add into petroleum jelly, castrol oil, vitamin E, these four ingredients together will make your hair grow stop drandruff, breakage and hair has healthy glow. Glovers mane is a GREAT PRODUCT, and I recommend this product HIGHLY.</li>
    <li> It did the job, however I had to wash my hair multiple times to get out the smell.  I don&#x27;t remember it smelling &amp;#34;this bad&amp;#34; when I was a kid.&lt;br /&gt;I will probably try to mask it next time though.</li>
    <li> This scalp treatment works great! I got a great price frame this seller and it arrived rather quickly. Defibetly a 10/10 in satisfaction.</li>
    <li> guessing it works for your hair been using it</li>
    <li> My mom used this product when we was kids, mixed into your choice of hair balm/ oil/ or grease to sooth the scalp. It was used when kids got ringworm and was left with a bald spot. So...... you may want to try on thinning hair areas, it may work!!! That&#x27;s what I&#x27;m going to do!!</li>
    <li> Its stinky but works I got this for my step daughter and I and no more inching and flasks love it</li>
    <li> Came on time as expected.... And the product was in New Packaging... I remember using it for my hair growth when I was young, it made my hair grow exceedingly fast !</li>
    <li> Used this when I was a teen to help heal dandruff.  Now that I&#x27;m older, I have lost hair due to bad dye jobs and perms.  Still smells but works great in healing your scalp.</li>
    <li> Not the real thing, don&#x27;t buy, mines came opened it looked old and used</li>
    <li> All these products and their sellers are great</li>
    <li> wonderful stuff to grow hair.</li>
    <li> Many many years ago, my mom lost a great deal of her hair from the stress of child birth. Her doctor told her get some glovers dog mange medicine and put&lt;br /&gt;it on your head an rub it in. Well he did not tell her how long to leave it on. She put it in her hair, put up her hair and covered with a bun cover and went to work. She left it on for a week! People kept asking what is that smell. She never did tell them. Once it is washed out there is NO smell left.&lt;br /&gt;This NEW stuff is called dandruff control but it is the same stuff. I used it after I had given birth too! I recognize the smell and consistency. However, this one does have some shampoo in it. MY mom had the most beautiful full head of hair, and I must say so did I. I got this to try it again as I am getting older. It seems to have done that magic again. I am sure if you just wash your hair it should have the same result.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for years. It has always been my go to product when my hair is in need of conditioning or to relieve scalp itching! It comes highly recommended!</li>
    <li> Exactly what I wanted</li>
    <li> Ok, but leaves hair a bit greasy even after a few shampoos.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Smells halfway between bacon and flatulence.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Instantly neutralizes an irritated scalp.</li>
    <li> Yes I love it and I recieved it as promised. I used it years ago my mother used it on my hair and my siblings hair it grew it wonderfully not only controlled the dandruff but made our hair healthy. I used it in my girls hair also . Its a wonderful product</li>
    <li> Love it, I am seeing much growth since combining it with my other hair regiment.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product since the 1960&#x27;s for hair growth and scalp issues.  Nothing does what this product does! I will purchase a couple more so I don&#x27;t run out.</li>
    <li> This medication is likes Buckley&#x27;s cough syrup.  It smells awful but it works!  There is no cure for my scalp condition Seborrheic Dermatitis but this stuff gives me the most relief I have had in 20+ years.  When I use it, yes the flakes are raised but then I just comb them out wash the hair and I have relief for a month.  This is much more tolerant than that maddening itch I will get in my scalp.  For persons who have this problem, I highly recommend this product.  Forget the odor. Comb and wash out the flakes and then enjoy freedom from this horrid disgusting debilitating disorder!!! Thank you Glovers!!!</li>
    <li> product is great. smells a little bad but its tolerable. I mix it with sulfur hairgrease and apply twice a week.</li>
