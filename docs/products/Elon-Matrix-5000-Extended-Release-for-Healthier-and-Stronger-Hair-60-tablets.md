<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> It states on the label to allow 6 months to notice the effects of this vitamin...so i&#x27;m not sure yet if they are helping. These were recommended in a magazine article.</li>
    <li> im not sure if this is doing anything for my hair as i have not noticed much,but ive only used one bottle so it may work if used longer,i dont know.</li>
    <li> This product broke my scalp out as I battle with psoriasis, but felt it was a great price and free shipping you can&#x27;t beat that.</li>
    <li> I had thinning hair and this is the best product I have found.  I keep thanking my dermatologist for recommending this product.</li>
    <li> Nothing to aid about it.   I made my research at amazon.com, choose de item, bought it right the way, as usual, and the package arrived to my final destination.  Congratulation Amazon.com.  Iwan</li>
    <li> I have used this product for years, Every now &amp; then I will take a break but I always go back to it. There are no side effects &amp; I notice how quickly my nails &amp; hair grow &amp; how much stronger they are when I am taking Matrix 5000. I would recommend to anyone especially if you want to give your hair &amp; nails a boost.</li>
    <li> These vitamins are fantastic. It takes about a month for you to start seeing results. The hair really start looks healthier and fuller. Easier to manage and the hair has a beautiful shine. The growth you can really  see a change. I am 48 years old and I have been using this product since October of 2008 and I will never stop using it. If you have tried everything to get your hair looking great, this may be the product for you. Just take the capsules once a day and you will be set.</li>
    <li> I bought this product about one month ago.  This product works!  It is so amazing.  I bought this product because I burned my scalp from hair dye.  There was this size of a thumb print that was bald and very shinny.  You would think that no hair would ever grow in that area.  I started to panic.....Now after taking it for about a month, I see hairs now sprouting from that bald spot!</li>
    <li> These  pills saved my nails .My nails were so soft that I couldn&#x27;t let them grow because if  they hit something , they were folding back and was so painful and nerve wrecking and also my thumbs were breaking from the middle on tips .end of the story since I&#x27;m taking these pills my nails started becoming firm and strong and also my hair started growing faster and shinier . thank god .</li>
    <li> I have used this product in the past for hormonal hair loss. It was recommended to me by my dermatologist. Although I don&#x27;t think it can stop or slow the shedding, it most definitely helps to grow back a lot of what you have lost. After several months, you will notice better growth.   It also does wonders for your nails.</li>
    <li> As of right now (45 days) i can not really say, if it helps or not. But I orderd a second bottle, because i know you have to take vitamines for a period of time to see a result. Will update. UPDATE Now four months later I think it is a good vitamin. You can not expect wonders by hair lost, but I can say my hairline got fuller. I use the vitamin togehter with \\&quot;rogain for men\\&quot; with adviese from my Doctor. Like by everything you have to keep taking it. I will keep taking the vitamin because even my hairdresser regonized that the hair got better.</li>
    <li> Product worked for me ; good product</li>
    <li> Although I haven&#x27;t finished my first bottle, I do see some results. I will continue and of course purchase more of this product. I also noticed my nails on my hands and feet have grown faster than usual!</li>
    <li> These pills are excellent for people who have thinning dry hair.  After having a really bad perm which left me with balled-spots in July, I really thought my hair would never be the same.  But after using these pills (buying two bottles), my hair has grown long enough to put in a pony-tail.  I will continue to buy this product and I definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> I think it worked. Too expensive though. I&#x27;m just buying biotin for my hair. It&#x27;s a lot cheaper and works just as well</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for a month now. My nails have been growing like crazy ever since. They are strong too which is something I haven&#x27;t experienced in ages. Not only are my nails doing great, but so are my skin and hair...being the softest they&#x27;ve been in months. I have recommended this product to all of my female friends and family members.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been taking this product for 2 weeks and I&#x27;m amazed at how this has changed my hair.    I&#x27;ve been experiencing hair loss since I was 38 and it hasn&#x27;t slowed down any.  I realized that I needed to do something so after research I decided to give these vitamins a chance.     In 2 weeks, I no longer have a hand full of hair after I wash my hair or a clump of hair in the shower drain.    It&#x27;s too early yet to see if I&#x27;ll have any regrowth but at least the falling out has changed to \\&quot;normal\\&quot; hair loss.    I love this product!</li>
    <li> This product really works! My hair stopped falling and as a result I see more volume more density, I&#x27;ve been taking it for 3 months only and I can see a big difference. I want to take it for at least one year to see the results. I truly recommend it  to any one who has thin and dry hair like me.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for 3 months now. It was recommended to me by my dermatologist for excessive hair loss, hair thinning, and also wanting to grow my hair longer. I am Indian in descent and my hair was at the top of my bra length when I first went to see the dermatologist. At first, I did not buy this specific brand, as it was a bit more expensive than an off brand (Windmill biotin) my pharmacy had in stock. I used a whole bottle of Windmill biotin in the same dosage (5000), for 3 months. I didn&#x27;t notice a difference in hair loss - in fact I felt as though I lost even more hair. I believe my hair did get longer, although at the same time it also got much thinner and fragile. When I went to my dermatologist and told him this, he said he couldn&#x27;t really comment on the Windmill brand because he hasn&#x27;t ever recommended it to his patients in the past. He told me to purchase Elon next time, and try it out for 3 months because he has told his mom, sister, wife, along with many other patients to use it for hair issues similar to mine. After using it for 3 months I have noticed that my hair has gotten much longer, and also thicker! As an added side effect, my nails are also much stronger and less prone to breakage. My hair is now grown to the bottom of my bra length, just to give you an idea of the growth I have seen. Also, I have noticed that a lot of baby hairs around my forehead have grown in approximately 2-3 inches! My hair feels much thicker and when I put it in a pony tail I have 2x the amount of hair now!! I am very happy with this product and intend to keep using it daily.&lt;br /&gt;Also, I know a concern I had before taking biotin supplements was if I would grow insanely long hair all over my body. As a female I didn&#x27;t want to grow a mustache/beard or super long leg hairs. This has NOT been an issue for me. My dermatologist did say that it shouldn&#x27;t happen too.&lt;br /&gt;EDIT: I have been using this product for approximately 11 months now. I am still taking only1 pill per day, and my hair is now all the way down to the small of my back. I have attached a photo of my hair so you can see how healthy it looks! (My hair is probably about twice as long as you can see in the photo. I just wanted to take a picture without my face so you are only seeing from the shoulder down.) I have had amazing results with this product and will continue to keep taking it daily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you found this review helpful, please click the YES button below.</li>
    <li> Well I will my star rating if something happens but so haven&#x27;t seen any results some starting about 2 weeks ago.</li>
    <li> This hair product was recommended to me by OBGYN female doctors who are treating my menopause symptoms naturally.(Phytotherapy)  I had severe hair loss due to hormome fluctuations.  It has helped tremendously, my hair has grown back so much quicker and feels so much fuller.  I highly recommend this product.  Great for skin and nails also.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;High potentcy, no side effects at all!!</li>
    <li> Great!!! received on time and as expected👍</li>
    <li> I have been using this now for several months. I originally began using it because my hair was thinning both in quality and quantity, but I saw no improvement &amp; discontinued it. However, my fingernails had begun to split with ridges that kept them pitted; nothing I tried helped. Then, my toenails began to come unseated from the beds, and my podiatrist recommended Elon Matrix. After only 30 days, I could see a big improvement in all my nails. For the first time in years, I can actually pick up a pin or open a necklace clasp without breaking a nail. Realizing it isn&#x27;t a medically-conducted, double-blind study, this stuff still works for me.</li>
    <li> well, ive been taking these for 3 months and havent noticed any visible changes in my hair yet. my derm told me it takes about 6 months to see results so im still waiting. will post again and let you guys know in 3 more months!! ugh!</li>
    <li> I just had a baby 3 months ago. As soon as I stopped taking my prescription prenatal vitamins and switched to another brand, my thick, gorgeous pregnancy hair started falling out!! Of course there&#x27;s no way to tell if it was the vitamin switch or just hormones, but either way I was NOT going to let that happen!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ordered this product based on the good reviews, and expected to possibly see results in a month or so as other users reported. To my surprise, within a week, my hair has almost completely stopped falling out. I can&#x27;t wait to see my hair in a month and add to my review! I will definitely keep this product as part of my health and beauty routine. Worth it!!!</li>
    <li> Love this stuff wouldn&#x27;t be without it. Totally changes the texture and brings your hair back to life! Healthy, healthy hair!</li>
    <li> Love these vitamins! a few years ago I had problem with my nails after I had acrylics and I went to the dermatologist and he recommended these vitamins to me for my nail. I&#x27;ve been taking them for 4 month and my hair grew so fast and became silky and strong. Nails haven&#x27;t been better since! I tried other biotin vitamins and it seems like they don&#x27;t work as well as these vitamins. if you are looking to grow out your hair and make it healthier, thicker and more beautiful this product is for you! I will definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> I just started using this product &amp; I see my hair growing healthier. I have very thin hair &amp; my hair breaks easy. When I started using this product I took my chances based on other reviews &amp; rating. I&#x27;m glad I did. My hair start to grow even instantly &amp; fullier. Including my sides where the hair is always fragile.  I recommend this product to family, friends, &amp; whom ever have hair growth problems.</li>
    <li> Love this!!  Started using this supplement and Nioxin shampoo for thinning hair.  The results are amazing!!  Would highly recommend, my hair is completely different than it was a couple months ago!!</li>
    <li> I have been suffering from hair loss since going through menapause 12 years ago.  Most of the hair loss was on the crown of my head.  Almost like male pattern baldness.  You could see my scalp especially under florescent lighting.  After reading the reviews on this product I thought it was worth giving it a shot.  It really took patience on my part.  I noticed that my hair had stopped falling out after about 3 months.  I thought I was seeing some improvement in hair growing back at around 7 months.  My hairdresser commented about my hair looking thicker (she didn&#x27;t know I was doing anything special and I didn&#x27;t tell her).  I have just completed 9 months.  The hair on my scalp has filled in to some extent and I am hoping with continued use it will fill in even more.  The rest of my hair is full and shiny.  I would really recommend this product to anyone having hair issues.</li>
    <li> I think this product works when used consistently. My nails are stronger since I have been using this product.  This is my third bottle.  I cannot say my hair grew any faster but I do see less hair on the floor.</li>
    <li> This product does work well....but not from just 1 bottle!! I would highly recommend this vitamin. It added shine and my hair is so healthy now. Have been using this for approx. 1 year.</li>
    <li> I guess I must be lucky because once I finished only 60 pills, there was a very  noticable difference.  For me, it really works, but I keep it my little secret.  My hair was always brittle and it is restored.  My friends and family are amazed at how much hair I have now!</li>
    <li> Only been taking for few weeks and I&#x27;m starting too see results....good results.</li>
    <li> My dermatologist recommended this product but I waited to buy it on line since I knew I could get a better price.  Over the last year my hair has been falling out profusely due to hormonal changes.  After taking Matrix 5000 for the last 3 weeks I noticed all the shedding has stopped!  Yeah!  I&#x27;m ordering more right now!</li>
    <li> I have never seen any results from this product.  I am going to try something else that gets better reviews.  It does depend on the reason for hair loss.</li>
    <li> still,too early to see it works</li>
    <li> I have never wrote a review but read reviews prior to most purchases. I figure its my turn to help.....I have been takin Elon Matrix for hair for approx 3 months and have noticed such a chane in my hair. My hair has grown and is so healthy. If you want results over night this is not the answer but after using for several months I will never be without</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t say if it works or not but I can tell you that this is a tablet, not a capsule.  This is important information for those of us who have trouble taking pills.  I had to return them and decided to go with \\&quot;NOW Biotin vcaps\\&quot;.  I would like to try these still if I could find them in capsule form.</li>
    <li> have not see any change yet</li>
    <li> i love these vitamins for my hair and nails. It really made my hair grow.</li>
    <li> This product truly works for me.  I have been using it for about 10 months now and I have noticed a tremendous amount of hair growth. My eyelashes are fuller, the hair on my head grows in thicker and faster, one downside is that I am constantly having to shave, but that is well worth it to me.  I had tried almost everything out there geared toward hair growth and nothing seemed to work.  This product really does work and you will see results, but you need to be patient.  It may take a bottle and a half, but you will see a difference. So many sites these days will tell you, you can&#x27;t grow hair faster, this product proves them all wrong, honestly it works and well.  I will buy Matrix 5,000 again and again, as I have been for the last few months.</li>
    <li> I have been using the product for about 4 months. Let&#x27;s just say the &amp;#34;jury is still out&amp;#34;. My hairdresser says she thinks my hair is thicker. She even asked what I was using so her husband could try it.  I really can&#x27;t tell if it is growing but do believe it has slowed down falling out. I am optimistic that it will be better after several months use.</li>
    <li> My dermatologist recommended 5,000 mcg of Biotin, ideally taken in two doses, morning and evening, for strengthening and thickening my hair. I chose the Elon Matrix because of the positive reviews and because my research indicated that silicone dioxide and cellulose, which are also in this supplement, can help hair growth. I break it in half and take half in the morning with breakfast and half in the evening with dinner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Results after 4 months: Hair is growing much faster. How do I know? I dye it using permanent dye and I now have a ridiculous amount of roots growing in at two weeks -- I can&#x27;t go longer than that without dyeing or it starts to look crazy. I used to go 3 weeks to a month between dye jobs. I seem to be losing less hair as well, though it&#x27;s hard to measure that except in \\&quot;horror units\\&quot; -- I&#x27;ve gone from horrified to merely somewhat disappointed when I look at how much of my hair falls out when I shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve also noticed that my nails are difficult to clip. I mean, they have gotten tough! I wasn&#x27;t taking these for nails, but it&#x27;s a nice side effect. As for my skin -- I didn&#x27;t notice anything different until I had major foot surgery. I&#x27;d had the same surgery on my other foot a year previously. But this time, the identical huge and horrible incision healed MUCH faster and much better! I wasn&#x27;t expecting that, but I&#x27;m guessing it&#x27;s partly because of the vitamins.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s so rare that supplements have a measurable effect that I had to review this one. It&#x27;s expensive but just for the effects on my surgical wounds alone it would have been worth it.</li>
    <li> My dermatoligist recommended Elon Matrix.  I didn&#x27;t expect new growth overnight.  The product is produscing new growth after using the 1st bottle.  I am in the half way point of the 2nd bottle.  There is new growth anf I am pleased.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Barbara D.</li>
    <li> After the birth of my second child, my hair started falling out.  The rate of regrowth just couldn&#x27;t keep up with the rate of loss.  It had become so bad that when I looked at my hairline in the mirror, I could actually see my scalp through my hair!  I wanted to do something about it, but I didn&#x27;t want to use a shampoo treatment because I really like how shiny my shampoo makes my hair. Last year I was reading an article in Women&#x27;s Health magazine and I learned about Elon Matrix 5000.  I ordered a bottle and after 2 months I saw HUGE results!    After a month I started seeing changes.  My hair is falling out less and the regrowth is catching back up to what it was before I even had my kids!  It&#x27;s much thicker.  It&#x27;s also growing faster.  I&#x27;m so glad I have my pre-baby hair back!    I couldn&#x27;t be happier with the results!  I have ordered 2 more bottles of Elon Matrix 5000 and will probably continue to use it!  If you try it, be sure to wait the full 2 months to see the results, it takes a while for everything to grow back and to see the improvement!</li>
    <li> At first, I was hesitant about trying this product because of past experiences with supplements claiming to fix this or that. I am African American with an autoimmune disease known as Graves Disease. With Graves Disease, your hair either becomes brittle or breaks off. Since taking this product, I have had massive growth of hair and not to mention my nails are white and healthy. Now, the humor is I have to shave once a week because sometimes you have to be careful what you ask for. Hair all over and I do mean hair all over. This product is rated a 100. Will continue to use forever. ~Mimi~</li>
    <li> I always order this product.</li>
    <li> I have just completed taking my first bottle of Elon Matrix and I notice a huge difference in my nails.  They are stronger and growing well.  Certainly, I hope this continues.</li>
    <li> This product was recommended to me to use by the head of the Dermatology Department at our medical school here in town. I had a brief bout with alopecia areata and he suggested that I get Matrix 5000 to use all the time. I even got my husband to use it as he is70 with slight thinning of his hair. So far it is doing its job very well.</li>
    <li> I use dthe matrix for 60 days I did see an immedaite change in my hair.  I did notice it did not shed as much as it previously did. I will give it another try to see if there is additional results.</li>
    <li> Just started using, no results yet.</li>
    <li> Really great product! Was having an issue with hair loss after an accident and this helped with regrowth. My nails also grew like crazy. Used it once a day and I&#x27;m on my second bottle and love it.</li>
    <li> My wife swears by this product.</li>
    <li> I like the product. It strengthens my hair and helps it grow faster. I don&#x27;t think it makes hair thicker but prevents it fromfalling out too much.</li>
    <li> I dont know what to say. I usually dont buy into herbal medicine, but to appease my mom i started taking biotin about a year ago. a couple months later, i noticed my hair was thicker and way fewer were falling out in the shower. Its been about 18 months and i&#x27;ve been off propecia for over a year and havent seen any drop in my hair quantity or quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;give it a whirl for 1-2 months...you&#x27;ll be impressed!</li>
    <li> Went to see my hairstylist and he noticed a change in my root color.. I am a natural blond and now look like I have highlights .The roots are a little darker.. Does anyone else have this happening?&lt;br /&gt;I have used this product for just over 45 days and the results are amazing.. Hair, eyebrows and nails are growing like crazy.</li>
    <li> my wife swears by this stuff</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had problems with hair and nails and this product, which was referred to me by my Dermotologist has made quite a difference and given me some confidence back.  Great product.  Thanks</li>
    <li> I bought these a little while ago and I forgot I had them. I bought them because I started seeing thinning in my hair. I started taking them everyday for almost three weeks. I thought I noticed some improvement in my hair, but I&#x27;m not sure if it was just optimism or it was really improving. However, I started getting horrible breakouts all over my face. I will get a few pimples here and there every once in a while, but these were huge and all over my face. I realized that they started appearing right after I took the Matrix pills. I stopped taking the pills and my face cleared up in about a week. I am very sensitive when it comes to taking medications, so it could have been that these vitamins did not mix well with my body. I can tell you that they made my nails grow very long and very fast. I didn&#x27;t really need help with my nails, so I didn&#x27;t see it as a reason to continue using them. I wouldn&#x27;t have continued using them even if I saw an improvement in my hair because the breakouts were too severe to handle. Like I said above, I&#x27;m not saying that these will cause breakouts in everyone. Some people react differently to medications. Some people may be able to take these and they may not affect their skin at all. I&#x27;m not one of them, unfortunately. I just figured I would warn anyone who has sensitive skin, or is sensitive to medications, about a side effect that you may encounter when taking these.</li>
    <li> I love elon matrix 5,000.  It has thicken my hair.  I have been using for about three years and would not to without it</li>
    <li> Love this product, have been using it forever! I ca. See a real difference in my nails especially. The package arrived fast and simple</li>
    <li> I have very dry brittle hair, caused from medication and I would say hormonal changes. I started taking these vitamins about 2 months ago and have noticed that my hair, nails and skin isn&#x27;t as dry anymore. My daughter also takes the hair vitamins and believes that they&#x27;re the best hair pills that she&#x27;s taken and she&#x27;s tried a few including Hairfinity, which did not work for us.  I will keep using these hair vitamins.</li>
    <li> I highly recommend.  It&#x27;s not only good for my hair it made my nails look great too.  Worth the cost and having to order every 60 days.</li>
    <li> Wife uses this regularly and is very satisfied.</li>
    <li> i like it it&#x27;s very good&lt;br /&gt;and i just start using it from 2 weeks&lt;br /&gt;i like it it&#x27;s very good</li>
    <li> I am an African American Female that would recommend this product to anyone! These Vitamins were initially recommended from my Dermatologist a few years back because of severe hair shedding.  I used this product on and off, however; I have consistently used this product for 3 months straight and have noticed remarkable progress.  I did not see any results until about 1 month.  Only downside to this product is initially I begin seeing minor blemishes on my face, couple strains of hair on my chin that you can hardly see, and minimal stomach cramping but this only lasted about 1 week or so and was then resolved. Once these symptoms were resolved, My skin looked very healthy and clear. My hair is growing faster, for example I had just had a relaxer and usually it takes about 2-3 weeks to see new growth, When I got my relaxer, within less than one week I had new growth that was seen by the naked eye. So in summary, This is worth the buy and dedication to assist with hair growth, Thicker hair, Healthier hair, Lesser shedding, and good healthy skin.  Will update once I have my relaxer in may with measurable results. I hope this helps.</li>
    <li> I have been taking Elon Matrix 5000 for Hair for a few years now. I recommend it to others who are moaning about lifeless and thinning hair. I take the recommended dose (I have seen that others have doubled it to get results) and within a few weeks noticed that my hair - limp and fine and thinning - had some body! I was very impressed and continue to take it.</li>
    <li> We always use the Elon Matrix 5000 vitamins and like them a lot.  They really help if you have thinning hair.</li>
    <li> Two or three days after I started taking one pill a day my hair stopped failing out excessively.  The product works as advertised, and is recommended also my dermatologist.  Thank God for this product!</li>
    <li> 3rd bottle and also using the lanolin on my nails. NO change in nails - hair more difficult to judge...it goes through phases</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for over a year, my hair has become healthy and is growing.  It took about 2 months to start see results.</li>
    <li> Dermatologist said try.  &amp;#34;Tub drain&amp;#34;indicates the vitamins are working.  If not the hair, the vitamins are probably doing some good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pleased with shipping and seller.  Recommend.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for many years and it is great for thinning hair.</li>
    <li> I swear by these hair vitamins they work very well. it does take awhile for them to kick in to be honest it may take until the second bottle. But once it kicks in it really kicks in. it also makes my eyebrows grow a lot so im always having to pluck them so that&#x27;s kind of a pain. when my friends see me they ask how I got my hair so long and I give them this name and next thing you know it they are taking them too!</li>
    <li> This I a great ! It really works!</li>
    <li> No problems with this order</li>
    <li> If you take these everyday then they will definately work. After 2 kids my hair was down to thin strands. After a month of these pills I saw ALOT of new hair growth, well worth the money. Now, 4 months later, my hair is lush and still growing out. My dermatologist actually recommended them to me!</li>
    <li> good stuff for your hair &amp; nails.</li>
    <li> I have been taking these for over a month, my nails have grown like weeds and are very strong, I can see a visible difference in my skin texture, smoother and vibrant still waiting to see if I have any change in hair growth, but I will definitely keep taking these as part of my daily vitamin regime, very satisfied customer here!</li>
    <li> One of my daughters post-partum friends suggested trying this to help my fingernails which had begun splitting. It started working in under a month. I&#x27;ve continued using it and I&#x27;m very happy with the results.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for two weeks now.  Please remember that we are all of different chemical make ups.  Along with relaxation techniques and eating right my hair is no longer falling out.  I find that I have to pluck my eyebrows a bit more regularly but the balding spots not so noticeable anymore.  I will continue taking this supplement if it means keeping my hair.  05/01/13 - I&#x27;m still on this.  I now find that my eyebrows are a bit fuller and healthier which means a bit more plucking but the hair is HEALTHY!  I am also on a Zinc and D as an additional supplement. Being an advid athlete I put the hair through some paces, washing every day - no curling irons and a hair diffuser with hair pudding and I&#x27;ve got the best looking locks around!  Top it off with hair wax at the near tips and you have hollywood hair! Keep at it!</li>
    <li> I really cannot tell if it has any effect on my hair or not.  I was told that I needed to take it for 2 months.  I am on my second bottle, so we will see.</li>
    <li> Never, never had naturally strong nails. After a year of Elon Matrix, they are remarkably strong. Although it takes longer for hair to grow in and longer to see the impact, I can tell you that my hair is my &amp;#34;new hair&amp;#34; is not breaking or looking frizzed.  Good stuff.</li>
    <li> These are the best vitamins for hair. My dermatologist first recommended these to me and I bought them for many months straight from them. Until I found this vendor. They make your hair stronger and will keep it growing with continued use. The bottle says you should see full results in 4-6 months, but I begin to see result in 7-8 weeks. So I think it depends on, what type of condition you have, how serious your condition is, etc.. My condition was not too bad, but I do have Alopecia areata, I did use and have been using the vitamins for more that a year and can&#x27;t say enough good things about what it&#x27;s done for my hair &amp; for my nails.</li>
    <li> I wrote a review for this product over a year ago and want to give an update.  I don&#x27;t know what I would do without this product.  I take both this and the Matrix 5000 without vitamins, once a day.  Before I started taking the product, my hair would come out in the shower and it was thinning from loss of hormones as a naturally occuring aging phenomenon.  After just a few  months of use,hair loss had stopped,  there was new hair growth all over my head and my hair was somewhat stronger.  Now, after two years of taking this product daily, my hair is extremely strong and much thicker.  New hair continues to sprout,  so I have masses of new, short little hairs that will grow out to full length over time and masses of older growth that is now about 4 inches long. This product doesn&#x27;t just make the texture of your existing hair fuller and stronger, which makes for better volume....it actually causes you to have a tremendous amount  of new hair growth that is REAL volume.  I can&#x27;t say enough about how grateful I am for this product.  I used to never leave the house without putting in mousse after washing my hair.  I  haven&#x27;t had to use mousse to add volume to my hair in over a year.  If you want a volumizing shampoo, the best thing ever is a shampoo by Kevin Murphy called Angel Wash.  There are no sulfates to strip the moisture and color out of color treated hair and  hair is left soft, very full looking and shiny.  Get this product at a salon that carries it.  It&#x27;s expensive but worth every penny.</li>
    <li> The product is ok. I do notice a difference in my hair but I cant really be sure if it is because of the vitamins alone or because the vitamins are a part of my new hair care regimine. I do think that with other elements such as drinking more water, taking multivitamins, getting enough sleep, you will see a difference in your hair...I cant really say that my hair is growing faster but I notice that it is growing out much stronger and thicker...hope this helps!!!</li>
    <li> I had hair breakage and never thought my hair would grow back, i started using this prooduct about 1-2 monthes ago and my hair is shinier (growing), my nails are longer and strong and my face looks amazing. i just ordered my new bottle today, its affordable and can work for everyone. It takes about a month to see any type of change so be patient, this does not steer you wrong.</li>
    <li> I have been using these vitamins for about 2 months. They were originally suggested by my dermatologist. I have seen a very noticeable change in my hair. It has grown so much in that little amount of time. I noticed at first around the edges and back starting to grow and then before I realized, my hair is coming back and growing wonderfully.I highly recommend them.</li>
    <li> this product helps to improve my hair stength and health-looking, but it really increased my appetite, I put on some weight since I started taking it. I&#x27;m trying to workout now to get rid of the extra weight because I like the result on my hair.</li>
    <li> I originally bought this product through my dermatologist to help with thinning hair and an irritated scalp.  It takes a month or so to notice a difference, so you need to be a little patient.  It really changed the health of my hair and scalp.  Before using it, my hair was getting skimpy--parts of my scalp sort of showed through.  Now my hair is much healthier and noticeably thicker.  No trace of scalp shows. I&#x27;m really happy with the results.</li>
    <li> It really works. Must buy.</li>
    <li> No notable difference in my hair - maybe a little shinier - not as much fallout.  However, do think my nails have benefited!  They grow faster and stronger.</li>
    <li> Is better than commercial brands such as General Nutrition, etc.  does not have a lot of additives.</li>
    <li> My hair is living proof that the product works</li>
    <li> Stronger nails, less hair loss.</li>
    <li> The best product on the market!! I have been using these supplements for 6 months and have significant improvement in my skin, hair &amp; nails. I have even had people stop me and ask if I take hair vitamins, and I proud share this product with them!</li>
    <li> Love it!!! love this product, I can see a diference already, it&#x27;s been only a couple of weeks, very happy, recommend to friends and family!!!</li>
    <li> That has been \\&quot;dermatologist recommended\\&quot; product.  Have been using for about 4-5 years.  It&#x27;s not like my hair started to grow right away - but I would say it got better a little bit.  But I would recommend to use Elon Matrix Complete (with multivitamins: same for the hair + vitamins.</li>
    <li> i ordered this product cause i had problems with my hair falling out a lot. So i decided to give it a shot. Now, i read on different websites that this amount of Biotin can cause break-outs. But on amazon it got so many positive reviews and apparently no side effects, so i said what the heck.&lt;br /&gt;I got mixed feelings about this product, thats why i gave it 4 stars: I LOVE IT cause after only 2 weeks of using it ive noticed a Huge difference in my hair- way more stronger than before and it is growing faster, BUT i have break outs! unfortunately. So the bottom line is: its a miracle to my hair, but its causing damages to my face.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll finish the bottle and will see if im going to reorder it again...</li>
    <li> We love this product. It serves its purpose well. Thank you for creating such a wonderful good.</li>
    <li> These vitamins  are of good quality and would recommend</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m on my 3rd bottle what will be my last. Had a chemical burn and maybe got 10% of my hair back. In 90 days it may have just grown on its own</li>
    <li> I have always used Biotin for my hair and nails but wasn&#x27;t taking a strong enough strength.  Since I have started Elon, I have noticed less hair was falling out and new growth.  It&#x27;s a little too soon to tell but I feel there will be an improvement.  I will continue using this product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Matrix 5000 since July.  I have noticed my part start to fill in more and less hair seems to be falling out.  I also have much more acne all over my face and on my neck behind my ears.  I&#x27;ve read several things online that Biotin in large doses causes this.  After taking Biotin for 2 months at full strength, I&#x27;m now taking 1/2 pills (2500 mg) to see if this helps at all. I&#x27;ve been doing this for 3 weeks now and have yet to see the acne clear up any.</li>
    <li> This product worked for strengthening my hair and nails.  The results take several months but then you notice the improvement.</li>
    <li> Thought it would help, my dermatologist recommended it, but nails brittle and tearing, soft as before, no change!!</li>
    <li> When I used the vitamins everyday my hair felt fuller and appeared healthier. But they must be taken consistently to work.</li>
    <li> Hi,I tried different product for my hair but nothing reaaly worked. Thanks to &amp;#34;Elon...&amp;#34; my hair stopped falling and I noticed growing them so fast. They became more stronger and shiny. I got so many compliments about my hair. The result I noticed after 1 month taking  Elon. Thanks the company,finally I found right product for myself.</li>
    <li> I had a problem with my thinning hair. After a month of use of this, I started to notice the baby hair growing. The hair strands become thicker and strong. I am giving it a 4 stars rate because of the price. It is quite expensive. But over all is it does work!</li>
    <li> I have been taking this product for 8-10 months.  My fine, wavy hair is growing in thicker.  Don&#x27;t really like the wiry texture but it gives body and my style doesn&#x27;t go so flat.  Overall a plus.  Don&#x27;t think it increases the number of hairs.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been taking these as directed by my dermatologist for about 3 years now.! I like them. My hair is thick, strong, and long. I usually take 2 every other day as I&#x27;m forgetful.&lt;br /&gt;-Please note: If you&#x27;ve considered taking the Hairfinity pills... These are MUCH MORE safer and better alternative. The Hairfinity pills does make your hair grow; however, it THINS the ends badly.! Most have to cut their hair because the thinking is so bad. There are several YouTube videos.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also helps my nails grow as well.! My skin is another story. I have VERY oily skin and acne-prone. Let&#x27;s just say these pills alone will not help. But hair and nails EXCELLENT.!</li>
    <li> too expensive and no results</li>
    <li> Really works great!!!!!</li>
    <li> I have been using Matrix 5,000 for over one year.  It definitely has helped the texture and strength of my hair and my nails.</li>
    <li> My doctor told me that I will start to see results in about 2 to 3 months and I am coming towards the end of my second bottle (each bottle lasts two months). I can definitely say that there is a huge drop in hair loss and I am very happy about it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have psoriasis and so i have pitted nails. I am hoping for more improvement on the nails but the improvement I have seen so far for the nails; I am not sure if it has got to do with Elon or the XTrac laser treatment I received but since it helped with my hair, I would give it the benefit of doubt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am going to continue purchasing it from Amazon and use it on a regular basis.</li>
    <li> No longer my hair loss</li>
    <li> it really didn&#x27;t work or me</li>
    <li> Been using it now for seven months and my nails are like steel, and grow constantly. I will continue to use this product.</li>
    <li> I have only used 1 bottle so far in conjunction with Rogaine and they have stopped the large amount of hair loss.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve taken these vitamins for years.  They are great!</li>
    <li> This vitamin is really great. My Doctor gave me samples. I used them for a month and my hair was in the best condition it&#x27;s ever been in. My hair feels silky soft and is very healthy. I will continue to use this product daily.</li>
    <li> Used this product before. No complaints.</li>
    <li> My dermatologist recommended this product for menopausal thinning of my hair. The hair in the area of the crown of my head had become very, very fine and &amp;#34;blow away&amp;#34; whispy. I wasn&#x27;t sure it would really do anything. My hairdresser noticed the improvement before I did. Over the past several years I have run out of it a few times and each time my hair returns to it&#x27;s previous thinness. I wouldn&#x27;t say my hair is real thick - It never has been - but there is a definite improvement.</li>
    <li> My wife bought this to strengthen nails.  We bought first bottles from Dermatologist office and bought replacement online to save a trip.  After almost 6 months, nails are still breaking.  Will try one more bottle and if no improvement, will quit taking.</li>
    <li> Works great!  Definitely notice hair grows faster and stronger.  Nails do too.</li>
    <li> My hair has been thinning and I find taking Matrix 5000 has helped</li>
    <li> I got these vitamins because of my friend. After only a month her hair and nails were growing like crazy and she had really shiny healthy looking hair. I needed some help with mine hair and nail so I got this. And let me tell you it works. I didnt have to wait long to see a results. Try it you wont regret it</li>
    <li> Still waiting to see results. Too early to tell if it helps.</li>
    <li> It made my fiancee happy to get it.  That is all it was supposed to do, and it did.  Thats all any of this stuff does.</li>
    <li> The differences are noticeable during the first bottle. The hair is thicker, darker and stronger. We ordered two more. Nothing else work before. Thanks.</li>
    <li> I love these vitamins.  My hair and nail condition has improved immensely since I started taking them. I will order more.</li>
    <li> Ineffective for me; tried it for 6 months.  I&#x27;ve switched to using Biotin (a significantly less expensive vitamin supplement) after noticing that the main ingredient in Elon Matrix was Biotin.</li>
    <li> it was recommended by my doctor.&lt;br /&gt;it works good, my hair is growing a little.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend people to use it.</li>
    <li> i have beeen using this product for the last 2 months have not seen any change yet.  The new order however does not have the same quality as the bottle just finished.  The Manager of the company that manufactures this drug indicated to me that the product might be counterfieted and that the American wholesale is not one of the recommened distributor that amazon used. he also admitted that the company had problem with manufacturing of these tablets due to its rotten smell and tase.&lt;br /&gt;I do not trust the quality and its legitmacy of the claim of this drug.</li>
    <li> These are the most awesome vitamins!!!  My friend&#x27;s dermatologist had recommended them to her when she was having a problem with her nails separating from the nail bed and in just a few weeks they were back to normal.  I was having a problem with my nails spliting, breaking and peeling and now they are so long I have to file them back.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for almost 10 years now.  It is great for you hair and nails.  Prior to using this product My nails would peel and split.  Now they are hard and long</li>
    <li> I have very fine hair and my dermatologist recommended this product for increased hair growth. While she sells it in her office, the price was less expensive on Amazon. Will continue to buy this product.</li>
    <li> I did not see any significant improvement in my hair and nails.  Maybe I didn&#x27;t take it long enough. I don&#x27;t know what else to say.</li>
    <li> I am not sure about this product, seems like I have lost more hair since I have started taking this.  Does this happen?  Perhaps more falls out and then it stops falling out?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ok, now seems to be working great. No hair is falling out.  Yeah!</li>
    <li> Works great. Have alot of new growth!</li>
    <li> Just began taking these  hair vitamins I will have good hair growth. I&#x27;m excited about these hair vitamins.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Elon Matrix 5000 for about a year now.  My hair is stronger and healthier, and I will continue to use this product.</li>
    <li> My hair is thin, it&#x27;s always been thin.  I&#x27;ve tried many, many products of this nature and so far I have not found one that works.</li>
    <li> I love love love this product! Thanks to previous reviews I purchased it and am thrilled with the results. I have noticed a lot of new sprouts of hair and they are growing quickly. Being late 40s and hormones that get depleted with age causing hair loss in the very front of my hair line....uggg I was desperate to find help. I&#x27;ve used TONS of other products, but only with one bottle I have seen results. Be patient and take as directed, you will be HAPPY too!</li>
    <li> Used it for about five months; faithfully the first three or four months then started tapering off because I didn&#x27;t notice much change in my hair.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only been taking this for about a month, but my thinning hair seems to be coming in a little fuller. I&#x27;m 22 with slightly gray/ thinning hair and military, so I don&#x27;t have A LOT of hair, but what hair I do have seems to be making progress. I say buy it and try it.</li>
    <li> I read the blogs and reviews of others who used this product. And decide to try for myself and these vitamin actually worked, I started using Elon Matrix after I stop getting perms. And my hair is growing and its much healthier</li>
    <li> Great for helping hair become strong and thick.</li>
    <li> Thicker hair, just as expected.</li>
    <li> This is my second bottle and I didn&#x27;t start seeing a difference until the end of the first bottle but I definitely had another 2 inches of growth on top of my normal growth.</li>
    <li> I have very bad hair and nails.  I&#x27;m hoping this product, recommended by my hair dresser, will help.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for 2 years now and have no complaints. I have noticed that my nails are much stronger and my hair has slowly grown a bit (I am mixed with very curly hair). The changes took about 4 months for me to notice. My hair isn&#x27;t excessively long but for the first time it reaches past my bra strap! I plan to continue using this product.</li>
    <li> I bought this product after reading all the reviews, hoping it would help my hair which is getting thinner, due to a very strong medicine that I have to take. Maybe I did&#x27;nt take it long enough, not sure, but there was no difference that I could notice, so I went back to using Reservage, which I had been using before, which does seem to help.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about a year and my hair is doing great! I haven&#x27;t experienced any breakouts because as promised, this is for skin too. I work out and drink plenty of water that helps as well but this product is great. A little on the expensive side but u get what u pay for!</li>
    <li> My stomach started acting up when I started taking it. Maybe it works for other people but not me. I threw it out.</li>
    <li> Very good product.  Time released was recommended and seems to be working.</li>
    <li> This was recommended by my dermatologist. My hair grew back thicker. I thought my nails were growing stronger but this last week that just seemed to all begin cracking and I&#x27;ve done nothing different.</li>
    <li> I was going thru hair thinning due to pre menopause. My hairdresser suggested I try Matrix 5000. I started this product about 1 1/2 mo&#x27;s ago and I noticed results after about 2 weeks. I love this product, it has helped my hair grow in the thing spots as well as my skin is softer and my nails are growing crazy. :) Amazing product.</li>
    <li> DEFINITELY PLEASED WITH THIS PRODUCT. THERE HAS BEEN A DEFINITE INCREASE IN HAIR GROWTH. NOW I WON&#x27;T LEAD YOU TO BELIEVE I EVER HAD LONG LUXURIOUS HAIR BUT AFTER A MAJOR ILLNESS A AND RECOVERY I HAD VERY THIN SPOTS AND LESS THAN AN INCH OF HAIR ON MY HEAD. NOW WITH ELON AND &#x27;NATURE&#x27;S WOMEN SECRET 73&amp;#34; ALL THOSE SPOTS HAVE FILLED IN AND MY HAIR HAS SHOWN SIGNIFICENT IMPROVEMENT</li>
    <li> I have been using matrix 5000 for the past 6months for FPB. I am 32 years old and have thinning and miniaturization occurring mainly on the my temples and crown. I told one pill per day. At the end of 6 months I have not noticed any increase in my hair length or density. I have only noticed the shedding continue and the hairs get finer. I don&#x27;t think the Biotin exasperated the problem but I don&#x27;t think it helped either.</li>
    <li> loved it, been using it one month and buying another supply. my hair is noticeably thinker fuller everyone sees a differences.</li>
    <li> Recommended by my dermatologist, these vitamins have really made a difference.</li>
    <li> Pricey, yes, but it works and there is nothing available over the counter to replace this combination.  My hair got shiney and quit falling out.  Next my&lt;br /&gt;nails started growing and not breaking all of the time.  Lastly I noticed I didn&#x27;t need lotion as much as I used to. After the first month I started taking my pill every other day because my hair was so oily.  Got smart and use a pill splitter and take one half every day.  My dermatologist is thrilled.  I just wish there was a cheaper option, but I am thrilled with the results. So is a friend now using the product!</li>
    <li> My hair has improved over the years using these vitamins.  Good transaction</li>
    <li> See above. I am writing additional words to match what it is that i wrote in the title. Seriously, I got what I wanted.</li>
    <li> I Luv matrix 5000. My hair and my nails grow really fast when I take these pills . I will buy this again.</li>
