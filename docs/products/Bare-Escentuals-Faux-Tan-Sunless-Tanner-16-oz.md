      <li>SO worth the money!!!!</li>
      <li>a nice, beautiful tan look with out the time it takes to stay out in the sun or use a tanning bed.</li>
      <li>I have used many sunless tanning lotions as I&#x27;m very fair skinned</li>
      <li>So I&#x27;ve shopped around quite a bit for a good self tanner that doesn&#x27;t make you look orange.  </li>
      <li>Works good..</li>
      <li>I purchased this product when Sephora carried it awhile ago, and loved it.</li>
      <li>I am quite fair complexion and with using this product you would never know that.</li>
      <li>This one is close, but not quite as good.  </li>
      <li>I have used this lotion for quite some time as I like to give a product a fair shot.</li>
      <li>I have tried just about every kind you could think of, including attempts to make my own!</li>
      <li>The smell is great, like a very light cherry almond.</li>
      <li>I think it turns out great and get many compliments.</li>
      <li>, nice consistency, smells good, that&#x27;s</li>
      <li>Love it!</li>
      <li>I had read reviews on this and love it!</li>
      <li>Just make sure to use sparingly on your face or you&#x27;ll end up looking likeSnooki!</li>
      <li>(I would not have the \\&quot;raw\\&quot; Faux Tan on my body before wearing clothing or touching bed sheets!</li>
      <li>They are not joking the tan really is better than what you would get from the sun!</li>
      <li>It also fades away perfectly without any funny patches etc.</li>
      <li>Most amazing tanning product I&#x27;ve ever used!</li>
      <li>I love this sunless tanner!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m so glad I did!</li>
      <li>The brush gives you perfect coverage, my skin looked airbrushed and it dries fast!</li>
      <li>Easy to apply, with end result being a great tan color - nothing orange about this product.</li>
      <li>This product really is amazing</li>
      <li>It has a nice cherry almond scent while applying but be warned that it does turn into a self tanner scent after a while</li>
      <li>I am loving the fact I don&#x27;t have to be a slave to it</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m very fair, so I apply one coat at a time and let it set, and it looks like a real tan!  </li>
      <li>so it basically equates to a monthly membership at the tanning salon--except this is better for you! :)</li>
      <li>I would just like to let all the women out there know that this sunless tanner is by far the best.  </li>
      <li>when I wake up I have a nice healthy bronzed glow.</li>
      <li>I let the color develop over night, and when I woke up the color was even more amazing.</li>
      <li>you can barely smell it and what you do smell is very pleasant.</li>
      <li>One of my favorite things about faux tan is the scent....</li>
      <li>I love this product.  </li>
      <li>Leaves you feeling &amp;#34;sticky&amp;#34; for many hours after application.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I have used it twice now and have had a stunning tan for two weeks, the likes of which I haven&#x27;t had since I was a kid and could play on the beach all day.</li>
      <li>My favorite sunless tanner.</li>
      <li>and this is by far the best available.</li>
      <li>I love it</li>
      <li>Make sure you&#x27;re showered, exfoliated, and shaved.</li>
      <li>You&#x27;ll get an authentic tan</li>
      <li>It saves my skin, which I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll appreciate even more in 20 years.</li>
      <li>Here&#x27;s what I love about this product:    </li>
      <li>and she&#x27;s tried many tan lotions</li>
      <li>Sure</li>
      <li>Love it</li>
      <li>Make sure you use a glove for even application.</li>
      <li>Applying it was really easy with the brush, like ridiculously easy!</li>
      <li>Smells pretty good, esp compared with self-tanners.  </li>
      <li>Otherwise, I loved the color that I received even after the first application.</li>
      <li>However, a lighter application of the product on top of moisturizer should be fine.</li>
      <li>Works great and looks natural without streaks.  </li>
      <li>The color is completely natural - it gave me a beautiful golden glow!</li>
      <li>The lotion goes on visibly, so it&#x27;s easy to see any spots you&#x27;ve missed.  </li>
      <li>(So easy)....</li>
      <li>This is so easy to apply.</li>
      <li>I am light skinned and it gave fast color but did not look good on my hands and was spotty on my face.....</li>
      <li>I was a huge Fake Bake Flawless lover, but came across a great review for Faux Tan.</li>
      <li>I was using a drug store brand on my face before and although it worked fine</li>
      <li>Its a great and safe way to keep your tan all year long.</li>
      <li>and I think I will be able to maintain a great tan with a weekly application and maybe an extra one for special occasions when I want to be darker.</li>
      <li>but overall its a great product.</li>
      <li>I am light skinned and try as I might, cannot get a tan.</li>
      <li>in any light.</li>
      <li>I never noticed a self tanner smell with it, even in the morning it still had a light almond scent.</li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t go on skin as smoothly as some others I have used.&lt;br /&gt;4.</li>
      <li>I have fair skin, but this product still looks really natural on me and</li>
      <li>I use it on my face which is also fair and freckled and it also looks totally natural.</li>
      <li>It is super easy to apply with the brush and you can see where you have missed easily.</li>
      <li>I can not say it enough, the tan color is insanely beautiful, healthy, real looking, TAN.</li>
      <li>Quick, easy and works like a charm.</li>
      <li>The best daily tan I have found so far!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This is so easy to apply. I prefer to rub it in with my hands, but this ALWAYS gives me a natural looking fan, never orange, and no funky smell.</li>
    <li> Love it! for being pale skinned it does not make me look orange and when I am tan it gives my skin that sun kissed look I love it!!</li>
    <li> This is the best sunless tanner I&#x27;ve ever used.  It doesn&#x27;t smell like others I&#x27;ve tried or streak.  It also gives you a natural looking suntan instantly, none of that orange color.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> RECIEVED MY PACKAGE IN A VERY SHORT AMOUNT OF TIME. GOT IT BEOFOR IT SAID IT WOULD. WOULD ORDER IT AGAIN. BEATS GETTING A SUNBURN</li>
    <li> I would just like to let all the women out there know that this sunless tanner is by far the best.  I&#x27;ve used it for two years straight and everyone thinks I go to the tanning bed.  Its a great and safe way to keep your tan all year long.</li>
    <li> This gives you quick color. I am light skinned and it gave fast color but did not look good on my hands and was spotty on my face..... also i had to wear gloves or my palms were discolored and I had to scrub them with a brush to remove the color even after using sunblock as suggested.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s true what they say about this product. I was doubtful, except that my sister-in-law (who&#x27;s also my close friend and has been through every self-tanning product with me over the years and knows her stuff) said she was getting wows from everyone regarding the natural look of her tan. On her recommendation alone, I ordered the big bottle and am so glad I did!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did not buy the brush - couldn&#x27;t afford it, but thought if it is so much better than other self-tanning lotions, I should be able to do it without a brush, like I did the others.  (BE will not like me for saying that, but to be fair, my sister-in-law and everyone else raves about the brush!!) Instead I used those thin throw-away latex gloves and they worked beautifully.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Okay, so I started with clean exfoliated skin and shaved legs. Btw - if you want to do this right, exfoliate for 3-5 days straight before you self tan.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did not put on moisturizer all over. The bottle stresses elbows and knees only, so that&#x27;s what I did. I also moisturized my feet and hands (front &amp; backs before putting on the gloves) because they sport your dryest skin. Dry skin is an enemy of a smooth and even-colored self-tan. Stand in GOOD lighting, and a full length mirror helps but is not necessary. Oh, because I am older, I also lightly moisturized my neck. (note: I did not &#x27;Faux Tan&#x27; my face because I prefer to not use self-tanner on my face).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Method: I applied a SMALL pump worth of Faux Tan on my hand and started on a foot (tops only and leave the last half of each toe alone (there is obviously rougher skin there which will soak up the tan gel, and you do not want color in your cuticles and toenail crevices). Then I did one \\&quot;pump\\&quot; onto my hands and rubbed on one leg (from knee down) as I would moisturizer. I continued on that leg, covering knee and thigh, front and back, paying attention to even distribution of color. If you want to, wear old underwear (you don&#x27;t mind discoloring) and stop applying where it starts. You&#x27;ll get an authentic tan line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Next I did my left arm from wrist up, front and back and continuing past elbow to upper arm. Then in one smooth \\&quot;sweep\\&quot;: left shoulder, left part of chest, neck (only the part that&#x27;s exposed and would get sun naturally!) right part of chest and right shoulder. Then start at right wrist up until you get to shoulder.  Last is midriff - which is very easy. (I could even do the lower back on my own. But I needed help for one part only: had to call hubby in for the upper back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottle says to wait at least an hour before water contact. I did - and, because I do this in the late morning or afternoon, I can shower just about any time before bed. (I would not have the \\&quot;raw\\&quot; Faux Tan on my body before wearing clothing or touching bed sheets! It will stain).  Showering is smart. The \\&quot;color guide\\&quot; is all that comes off, and you will see it going down the drain - but it is not your tan - if you&#x27;ve followed directions. (I think if you moisturize all over first, as some do for instance, you may be asking for trouble in these area: color coming off with successive showers and color on clothing and bedding.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Okay, I recommend this product highly because I think they have really excelled with Faux Tan. I have used it twice now and have had a stunning tan for two weeks, the likes of which I haven&#x27;t had since I was a kid and could play on the beach all day. This makes you feel like you have --  like you are sun-kissed!</li>
    <li> It went on pretty smooth, looked pretty natural, but did rub off on my clothes.  I was going to give it a two, but changed it to a three.</li>
    <li> Finally a self tanner that looks natural! I am really pale and burn in the sun and have tried every self tanner out there. I found this one a couple months ago and loooovvve it! It looks very natural and when it fades it fades evenly. I did not buy the body brush but have just been using latex gloves when putting it on and that seems to work well. It has a nice cherry almond scent while applying but be warned that it does turn into a self tanner scent after a while (but goes away as soon as you shower). Also, a little bit goes a long way and the solution is tinted so you can see exactly where you are applying it.</li>
    <li> This product is so amazing, I recommend it to anyone who wants a natural looking tan but does not want to sit in a tanning bed. I have fair skin, but this product still looks really natural on me and no one can tell that it is actually a self-tanner--let alone \\&quot;fake\\&quot;. I definitely recommend getting the body brush to put it on though. I only apply this product once a week since I don&#x27;t need much to make my skin look tanner than normal. The only \\&quot;negative\\&quot; is that you will probably get some transfer of color on your sheets. I simply just use older sheets when I use the product. In my opinion all the \\&quot;pro&#x27;s\\&quot; definitely outweigh the one \\&quot;con\\&quot; though.. I usually shower, shave, exfoliate and then apply this product at night time and during the time I sleep the product gradually darkens, so when I wake up I have a nice healthy bronzed glow. It may seem a little pricey but it&#x27;s worth every dollar, plus it lasts a while if you only use it once a week--so it basically equates to a monthly membership at the tanning salon--except this is better for you! :)</li>
    <li> I have used many sunless tanning lotions as I&#x27;m very fair skinned and I like to have a little bit of color throughout the year. In the winter of course I am very pale, and in the summer I have a hard time finding time to sneak away for some time in the sun.  So, I have resorted to using sunless tanning lotions. I have used this lotion for quite some time as I like to give a product a fair shot. All in all, it&#x27;s not bad. I will say it does give you some color instantly, which is nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My main issues with this product are as follows:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Stains your hands horribly if you do not immediately wash them thoroughly with soap and water. (which many others are guilty of as well)&lt;br /&gt;2. The scent - just not for me. I don&#x27;t feel like it smells clean on skin.&lt;br /&gt;3. Doesn&#x27;t go on skin as smoothly as some others I have used.&lt;br /&gt;4. Leaves you feeling &amp;#34;sticky&amp;#34; for many hours after application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And like many others, it will rub off on clothing and other fabric items.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not a bad lotion if you want some color for a special occasion (and the large bottle will last you a good while), but not the one for me.</li>
    <li> The best self tanner ever made! I love it, I would never use anything else again.  I have tried just about ever self tan product out there and this is the best.  No orange color and the scent is great. You only need a tiny amount so this bottle will last you forever!  Thank you for a great product!</li>
    <li> I use yellow rubber gloves for the easiest application with no streaks.  I cut off the gloves at the wrist so the tops of the goves don&#x27;t get in the way when applying the cream. I&#x27;m very fair, so I apply one coat at a time and let it set, and it looks like a real tan!  If I want my tan to look a little darker, I wait a couple days, and apply another light coat to darken it.  I only need to apply a light to medium coat once a week. The tan would continue to look good for almost 2 weeks, but I don&#x27;t wait that long to let it fade out.  And it does fade out VERY naturally, too, it&#x27;s awesome! In the summer, I only need to apply it once a week to have a natural looking tan.  All the way around, I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Apply this with the Bare Escentuals Tanning Brush (So easy)....What a beautiful tan.....I look like I have been on a tropical vacation and it lasts! Most amazing tanning product I&#x27;ve ever used! No need to ever go to the tanning bed again..</li>
    <li> WEAR GLOVES would be the main thing I would stress when using this product.  It will save you alot of hassle trying to clean your hands.  Otherwise, I loved the color that I received even after the first application.</li>
    <li> ................. just wondering why people are buying it on here when I got it for $49 on QVC (including the brush)</li>
    <li> This stuff is perfect! As a life long St Tropez fan, I tried this brand on a whim are seeing the good reviews. I&#x27;m so glad I did! This color is a milk chocolate with absolutely no orange, and on top of that, it offers immediate, beautiful color. Also, you don&#x27;t need a lot, and can dilute it with some lotion. Not streaky. Good chocolatey color, yayyy! Ima bronze goddess!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m Irish and have pale skin.  This tanner is perfect.  I put it on a night (use the brush - if it doesn&#x27;t come with the order, you should buy one) and in the morning, take a shower and wash it off.  If you apply to your feet and hands, make sure you use a washcloth and wipe them down making sure to get in between your fingers and toes - they can leave dark spots.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This gives the perfect tan.  I buy this ALL the time.  I was foolish in my 20&#x27;s and went tanning in the beds for years - yes, eventually I developed melanoma.  So I&#x27;ve shopped around quite a bit for a good self tanner that doesn&#x27;t make you look orange.  I usually buy it on QVC though - they have specials a couple times a year and you&#x27;ll save a bit of money, but if I ever run out, I&#x27;ll buy it on here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I definitely recommend this!</li>
    <li> My favorite sunless tanner. But wear it when you have time to tan as it will rub off on clothes, wet or dry.  Apply, wear bikini around house while drying a few hours then proceed with caution. It is a beautiful brown color with no orange color at all and I am a red head.  Tans darkest and lasts longest when worn at least 14 hours without water exposure.</li>
    <li> This products works well as a sunless tanner. I do use more frequently because I want to stay the same level of color.  This is the best one I have used.  I have been going to tanning beds for years and this year I decided I did not want use tanning beds any longer.  No one can tell the difference in my tan this year.  I would recommend this product highly.</li>
    <li> My wife loves it she says it&#x27;s the best self tan lotion she&#x27;s ever used and she&#x27;s tried many tan lotions</li>
    <li> I have been using this product since it first came out and cannot live without it! I am light skinned and try as I might, cannot get a tan. This product gives me a natural looking tan and does not look orange at all! I have become an expert at putting it on... I never use the gloves and always apply with my hands. To avoid staining your palms do a body part at a time then wash your hands with soap, dry them, then proceed with the next body part (ex. do an arm, wash hands, do the other arm). I typically will apply twice if I have not used the product in a while and I need to achieve a darker \\&quot;tanned\\&quot; look the following day. I apply the product all over and then wait an hour - two hours before applying a second coat. Application needs to take place 8hrs before showering. Best suggestion is 2-3 hours before you go to bed to let it soak in for the night. This product really is amazing and I would give it ten stars if I could. If you are even slightly on the fence about purchasing it, don&#x27;t be, it is well worth it!!!</li>
    <li> I have to admit, I was skeptical about spending so much money on a fake tan, when everything else (and I mean EVERYTHING) has turned me orange, streaked, or left those \\&quot;I just fake-tanned!\\&quot; marks on my knees and ankles.     I actually bought the large bottle with the blending brush from the QVC website with my fingers crossed, and was blown away by how well it worked! Here&#x27;s what I love about this product:    1) The buffing brush leaves no streaks and no marks on your hands. Also it makes the entire process quick, easy, and very neat.   2) The lotion goes on visibly, so it&#x27;s easy to see any spots you&#x27;ve missed.  3) The color LASTS. I did it the night before leaving for a beach vacation, and after four days of swimming in the ocean, and one very sweaty yoga class, I still had probably 60% of the color left on my skin  4) The color is completely natural - it gave me a beautiful golden glow! (And I&#x27;m pale like a vampire.)    My advice would be to do it at night before you go to bed. Make sure you&#x27;re showered, exfoliated, and shaved. The tan will develop overnight (the only con so far is that I got some slight color transfer onto my sheets) and in the morning, you can quickly rinse excess product off in the shower before dressing.     I can&#x27;t imagine going through my enormous bottle quickly - I&#x27;ll probably be good with a weekly application - but you can be sure I&#x27;m going to keep re-ordering as long as BE keeps making this product!</li>
    <li> I have and will continue to use this item because it gives me a great sun kissed color without any streaking! I do not believe in tanning beds anymore due to a loss of a close friend with skin cancer and this gives me an even better color for my pale complexion!</li>
    <li> Very difficult to get it to look even and natural, even if you already have a tan.  Stir it well with regular lotion if you want to look a little more natural.  Not bad, if you mix it.  Smells pretty good, esp compared with self-tanners.  Stains your hands.</li>
    <li> I am back for the large bottle, after buying the smaller one with the application brush about a month ago. I am very fair and freckled and have tried every self-tanner out there and this is by far the best available. Lisa Robertson on QVC convinced me to try it, although I purchased here, after watching her presentation where she was literally on her knees preaching the wonders of this, she was pretty funny she was so desperate to convince the viewers (so thanks Lisa)!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does not turn you orange, it smells of Almonds when you apply it and after a shower there is no smell. It is super easy to apply with the brush and you can see where you have missed easily. The color transfer is nil after a shower, although be prepared to think you&#x27;re washing your tan off (you&#x27;re not) and a little but not bad before a shower. You have instant color as soon as you apply it and then within 4 hours the full color develops. I use it on my face which is also fair and freckled and it also looks totally natural. I have had quite a few compliments on my tan from other women which is always a good sign you&#x27;re not overdone or orange!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The color really lasts well and I think I will be able to maintain a great tan with a weekly application and maybe an extra one for special occasions when I want to be darker. It also fades away perfectly without any funny patches etc. Sure it&#x27;s pricey but you get what you pay for and this is the best, no doubt!</li>
    <li> I love this product.  I have tried several tanning products and the color from this one is very natural looking.  I&#x27;m very happy with it.  Wear gloves or a miit when using to keep your hands from coloring.</li>
    <li> Works good.. last only thing bad after smell</li>
    <li> I love this sunless tanner! I have used several different tanners over the years (I also have a history of going to tanning beds, but stopped after having a few funny-looking moles removed!). This tanner is AWESOME! The dark color of the tanner makes it easy to apply so that you don&#x27;t miss any spots and you get an even tan and, because the color of the tanner is so dark, you get an instant base color. The color of the lotion is REALLY dark, almost black, but once you rub it in evenly, the color looks great.   Also, this doesn&#x27;t have the nasty smell like most other self tanners. I would compare the smell of the lotion to almonds.   If I had to log one complaint it would be, like some other reviewers have stated, that the lotion WILL stain your hands. As I said, the color of the lotion is very dark so it will stain the palms of your hands and if your hands tend to be dry it will stain them even darker. You could try to coat your hands with moisturizer or sunscreen before applying the tanner, as some have suggested, but I find the this makes it difficult to blend the self tanner in well. You could also try latex gloves, but I find that this also makes it difficult to blend well and the gloves tend to want to slide off while you&#x27;re applying, which can get really frustrating. My method is to just suck it up and use your bare hands to rub in the tanner and when you&#x27;re done use a clean kitchen sponge (the green and yellow kind - the green side used for scrubbing) and hand soap to really scrub the tanner off of the palms of your hands. Take a few extra minutes to make sure you do this well and I promise you won&#x27;t have any staining left on your hands and your tan will look so good and very natural. The directions recommend that you don&#x27;t use this product for your face - probably because it is so dark - but I do use just the tiniest bit for my face. I think it turns out great and get many compliments. Just make sure to use sparingly on your face or you&#x27;ll end up looking likeSnooki!</li>
    <li> I had read reviews on this and love it! It does dry quickly son if it is applied with hands, do so quickly and wash. Using a brush to apply works very well too but takes a bit more time.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this self tanner for 2 years now and its awesome! I first only used it on my face... it never broke me out, but I don&#x27;t have skin prone to blemishes. My one small bottle just ran out so I ordered the big bottle this time. It works just as well on my body... I should have been doing this for years too... just got tired of all the other body self tanners I tried bc you had to keep up with them so much. Not this one- one application lasts for several days! One of my favorite things about faux tan is the scent.... you can barely smell it and what you do smell is very pleasant. I was using a drug store brand on my face before and although it worked fine I simply couldn&#x27;t handle the sickly sweet smell it had- made me gag! Faux tan also dries super fast... I usually use latex gloves when putting it on my body. I can wear clothes almost as soon as I&#x27;m done... although I usually opt for something black just in case.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> This is a good product, however I&#x27;ve been around for a while, and I remember this same self tanner, different names, much cheaper brands out in the 90s, this same size bottle actually for 5.00 bucks.  I loved it back then, worked really well, then everyone stopped making it.  I tried for years to find the same type of self tanner, never could find it.  The one difference between this and the older types in the 90s, was the older types would last longer, a week, didn&#x27;t wear off and gradually wore off after showering, after that week.  This one is close, but not quite as good.  I give it a thumbs down for the price, which is outrageous, I could afford it, but would rather pay 20 for it.  Otherwise I say this product works well, nice consistency, smells good, that&#x27;s it&#x27;s brown out of the bottle helps, the coloring is natural, you can layer if you want to get really dark.  It last on me about 4 days even with showering, but it does wash off and fade through those days.</li>
    <li> I am a self-tanner junkie. I have tried just about every kind you could think of, including attempts to make my own! I was a huge Fake Bake Flawless lover, but came across a great review for Faux Tan. I read a few more good reviews and jumped head first into it. I bought the big bottle of it and the brush, which I had to buy seperately but is a very crucial part of it! Pretty spendy impulse buy, but I am here to tell you...it was INCREDIBLY worth the money. I guess I got lucky lol.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shipping was fast, and when the package came I opened it and immediately wanted to try it. I hadn&#x27;t showered (so obviously my skin wasnt exfoliated) yet that day but I went ahead and applied it anyway, thinking if it turned streaky or looked bad I would just scrub it off in the shower later. Applying it was really easy with the brush, like ridiculously easy! No more pale hands and orange palms either from having to use hands to put it on. It took me literally 10 minutes to do my whole body. The brush gives you perfect coverage, my skin looked airbrushed and it dries fast! The smell is great, like a very light cherry almond. The color pay off was immediate. The base color is a greenish brown, and gives the best TAN *BROWN* I have ever,ever seen from a self tanner. I can not say it enough, the tan color is insanely beautiful, healthy, real looking, TAN. no streaks, patches, or weird orange tones...in any light. I could see this being great on any skin type, even if you are pale, its just a very natural tone. I let the color develop over night, and when I woke up the color was even more amazing. They are not joking the tan really is better than what you would get from the sun! I showered and was nervous, I could see a lot of color coming off. I thought oh well, I&#x27;ll just re-apply. When I got out of the shower and dried off, I was so amazed the deepness of the tan was actually still there! I am loving the fact I don&#x27;t have to be a slave to it, I don&#x27;t have to keep re-applying it every day to maintain it....it maintains itself very well, and you dont need to moisturize it like crazy. I&#x27;d say you&#x27;d only need to apply it once,maybe twice a week at most. And when you&#x27;re nearing the day that you need to re-apply, you don&#x27;t look scaly and dry and patchy like I&#x27;ve found with other products. I never noticed a self tanner smell with it, even in the morning it still had a light almond scent. It didnt rub off on my sheets overnight either! I will seriously never use any other self tanner, or tanning bed, ever again! I literally can&#x27;t find anything wrong with this product!! SO worth the money!!!!</li>
    <li> I have used this tanning product for about 3 years now and really like it. It doesn&#x27;t have that gross smell that most self-tanners have and it&#x27;s immediately visible so you know if you&#x27;ve missed anywhere. I always apply it with the kabuki brush that my initial purchase came with -- so my hands aren&#x27;t ever stained.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You do need to be sure to let the lotion dry before getting dressed--it will color your clothes (though I have yet to have it actually stain something permanently).</li>
    <li> Love it ~ Use it almost daily and acts as my foundation.  Everyone compliments me on my tan all the time.  I am quite fair complexion and with using this product you would never know that. I do have a few issues with even color on my lower legs BUT I&#x27;m sure that has to do with a little skin condition that I have.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product when Sephora carried it awhile ago, and loved it. They had done away with it for the season and because no other product was comparable, I found and bought it on Amazon. I have used spray and liquid self tanners from the grocery store and none of them came close to the results I received from Faux Tan. This product was the only product that I could put on my face and have it look completely natural. It blends very nicely, and you don&#x27;t need much, so the money goes a long way. It lasts for a few days once applied, and fades nicely. I am now a busy mom with almost 3 kids, and love that I can get a nice, beautiful tan look with out the time it takes to stay out in the sun or use a tanning bed. It saves my skin, which I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll appreciate even more in 20 years. I would HIGHLY recommend this product!</li>
    <li> Works great and looks natural without streaks.  If you want a tan without being in the sun this is perfect.  I wish it lasted longer but overall its a great product.</li>
    <li> Most excellent product.  Quick, easy and works like a charm. I will always buy!</li>
    <li> My mom and I use this and we&#x27;ve loved it since we found it! It goes on fast and easy. It does only last 24-48 hours though.</li>
    <li> Have used for a few years but now it is turning me orange so I switched xentan</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve bought this twice.  One bottle lasts me an entire summer season and beyond. And the color is very natural.</li>
    <li> Easy to apply, with end result being a great tan color - nothing orange about this product. Word of caution - apply VERY lightly where skin is thick and/or rough (i.e. heels, sides of feet by soles, knees, etc.) it will stain very dark. However, a lighter application of the product on top of moisturizer should be fine. Also, apply sparingly around your wrists where they crease by your hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did purchase the brush (it&#x27;s super soft and easy to use) and really like the even distribution the brush provides, plus by using the brush my palms do not stain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend this product. My &amp;#34;tan&amp;#34; lasts for about two weeks before another application is needed.</li>
    <li> I like this purchase as it doesn&#x27;t streak and dries quickly.  Very nice and does not leave an odor.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you.</li>
    <li> The best daily tan I have found so far! Natural color and gives an even color. Would not think about using anything else.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for a long time, and it is by far the best self tanner I have found. I love the large size because it goes fast! Make sure you use a glove for even application. I like the St Tropaz glove at Sephora.</li>
