    <li> Best hard-hold hairspray I&#x27;ve found.</li>
    <li> when this stuff said \\&quot;hard hold\\&quot; i was skeptical- i&#x27;ve tried hundreds of dollars worth of product that made the same claim. but since this wasn&#x27;t expensive at all, i&#x27;d tried it. O-M-G. this spray is true to its word. it hardens your hair immediately. and the best part is, you dont need to douse your hair in it(major damage). the can is fairly big, so i expect this to last me quite awhile. it also give hair a subtle shine to it. 5 STARS!</li>
    <li> Great hairspray for all kinds of weather. Will hold all day .More expensive than others but&lt;br /&gt;well worth it.</li>

    <li> Waste of money.. I do not know if what I received is a fake product.. I tried the product in a store and I fell in love with it but it was too expensive. So I bought it here. It is horrible all it does is to leave my hair full of white spots. Do not buy this, it a waste of money and do not get fool by the previous reviews. Very disappointing!</li>
    <li> its pricy but there is no other hair spray that has the hold and its great wouldnt use anything else</li>
    <li> Love this hair spray!</li>
    <li> This is a fantastic product!!!!  I highly recommend this hairspray.  It has super stong hold; works great with fine hair too!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s expensive so that it why it doesn&#x27;t get all stars and the spray nozzle clogs sometimes. The smell is actually appealing. It holds really well and washes right out with shampoo in the shower. Doesn&#x27;t weigh hair down and keeps the style in tact. I am a repeat purchaser of this product.</li>
    <li> You can walk through a wind storm with this hairspray.  You need very little and it holds so beautifully.  Wherever you want that poof of hair or swirl or lift this hairspray will do whatever you want.  It lasts all day long too.  I only use this hairspray for many, many years.  It&#x27;s the best you can buy anywhere.</li>

    <li> good stuff-priced right</li>
    <li> Love this stuff! Works well with curly, hard-to-hold hair!</li>
    <li> This stuff, it&#x27;s kind of amazing.  It doesn&#x27;t dry crunchy, but it has great hold.  I&#x27;ve used it to do about every hairstyle I can think of to keep my bangs hidden away while they&#x27;re growing out.  It&#x27;s done so well people didn&#x27;t even realize I had bangs.  I also used it for an updo, and it survived me going out a playing a very rough ball game.  I walked away with perfect hair.</li>
    <li> I have been using this hairspray for the past 5 years.  There is nothing better.  I am allergic to perfume and many products with smell and this one does not have a scent, holds your hair without the stiff feeling - just a great product</li>
    <li> This by far is the best hairspray product that I have ever used!!!!! I have very fine, thin hair that has a hard time holding curl. Not long after styling my hair and spraying it, less than an hour later the curl would just fall out. Now I blow dry my hair, spray all over with the hairspray, and use my curling iron. The curl stays for a very long time. It washes out easily to. This will be the only hairspray that I will ever use.</li>

    <li> Wonderful hairspray.  Really holds hair and is easily combed out without residual buildup in hair!</li>
    <li> BEST HAIR SPRAY EVER.&lt;br /&gt;It holds my hair (I have thick long hair) for whatever do I put it up as. It also doesn&#x27;t flake and it is light. Just love it and I won&#x27;t buy anything else.</li>
