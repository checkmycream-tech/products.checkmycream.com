      <li>Perfect for a quick tan.</li>
      <li>It is super awesome.  </li>
      <li>The color is a golden beachy tan that looks great!</li>
      <li>So what I did was take a towel shake it real good and then spray it on a towel first to get any of it out of the nozzle before applying on myself.</li>
      <li>and I am so glad I did!</li>
      <li>I was referred to this product, and told it was amazing.</li>
      <li>This stuff is amazing...</li>
      <li>but from what i heard it is amazing.</li>
      <li>I was most impressed with how natural it is on the hands and feet, its a great product.</li>
      <li>Absolutely the best!</li>
      <li>it wasn&#x27;t the \\&quot;offensive\\&quot; overpowering disinfectant kind of odor you may be wondering about, trust</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s a nice color.</li>
      <li>This self tanner was kind of blotchy when sprayed on and stained by rug.</li>
      <li>Toma&#x27;s airbrush tan is one of the browner colors I&#x27;ve ever used to be quite honest.</li>
      <li>but because it&#x27;s an aerosol and considered hazardous r something</li>
      <li>Even have their friends loving it.</li>
      <li>The results are nice as I stated, but the result is not as even as sunlesspro.</li>
      <li>No streaks and a nice tan.  </li>
      <li>As long as you have some makeup pads, you will have a beautiful and flawless tan.</li>
      <li>And FYI Amazon won&#x27;t let you return it because they say it&#x27;s considered Hazardous Materials</li>
      <li>Perfect, natural bronze tan!!!</li>
      <li>I am giving this product three stars because the color is beautiful golden tan color not orange ..</li>
      <li>I have tried Sun Labs and Jergens, both good, but this is definitely the best of the trio.</li>
      <li>I love it for my chest and face, kind of splotchy for the arms and legs.</li>
      <li>The best natural tan you get in convenience of your home.</li>
      <li>It does however transfer easily!</li>
      <li>There is no weird, self-tanner smell either, its great.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m naturally very fair skinned and the color still looks natural.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll buy more when I run out.</li>
      <li>I love this product.  </li>
      <li>I was able to use this product to help blend in the tan line.</li>
      <li>have received many compliments over the years on my &#x27;tan&#x27;</li>
      <li>This was yet another recommendation from a favorite beauty blogger that I follow.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;d recommend making sure your skin is hydrated and also smoothing the product in after you spray it on.</li>
      <li>I grabbed it thinking that it would be better than the L&#x27;Oreal which was just the tiniest bit too orange for my liking.</li>
      <li>U will not get a better tan in salon.</li>
      <li>Love Tomas, but stick with the cream.</li>
      <li>and my girls have tried many products.  </li>
      <li>and they love this product.  </li>
      <li>You better be in a bubble when you spray this bc</li>
      <li>Okay.</li>
      <li>Make sure to rub it in.  </li>
      <li>, I may apply two coats back-to-back to get more of an impact.</li>
      <li>how many times have you ordered something on a menu you never ate before</li>
      <li>I love the color it provides and it is buildable.</li>
      <li>once that didn&#x27;t work and seller sent me a new one, which was great.</li>
      <li>The best way to achieve the darkest color is to put a layer on and it let dry before applying another layer.</li>
      <li>so you have to hope the seller takes your word for it and sends you a new one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am suuuper fair, and use this mostly on my chest and neck every couple of days.</li>
      <li>, I had concentrated areas, I rubbed it in with my hands and then then had to wash my hands about a dozen times to be sure I didn&#x27;t have super brown palms :) They did show brown and not orange</li>
      <li>It wasn&#x27;t as easy to spray as I thought.</li>
      <li>it was easy to blend any splotches out, and like I said, try to limit loooong strokes of continuous spray.</li>
      <li>Goes on easily</li>
      <li>It does however give you a nice color not fake.</li>
      <li>Eventually I pressed on the very back of the sprayer and it came out beautifully.</li>
      <li>As someone else mentioned, if they would only change the nozzle it would be perfect, but it still works very well the way that it is!</li>
      <li>if u need something quick!  </li>
      <li>I also tried this product per the recommendation of one of my favorite beauty bloggers (Cara of Maskcara!), and it really suited my purposes well.</li>
      <li>I have started using this tanner primarily for my face, chest and neck.  </li>
      <li>The spray lightly mists the skin</li>
      <li>I bought this product and it smells fabulous.</li>
      <li>I followed the directions with light applications</li>
      <li>I have fair skin naturally.</li>
      <li>If you consider that you&#x27;ll probably get about two or maybe three uses per bottle, and average the cost per ounce of Toma&#x27;s I think you&#x27;ll quickly realize that it&#x27;s your best bang for your buck.</li>
      <li>Toma&#x27;s provides a GREAT looking color, deep and rich without any orange.</li>
      <li>I am normally pretty fair skinned although I do tan nicely if I go regularly, and this spray leaves a nice brown color and doesn&#x27;t appear orange.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> After reading all the wonderful reviews I thought this would be a great product.  I made one application.  It was splotchy even though I did exactly as it stated for application. Very fake look and after leaving a message to the seller (2 days after receiving), I have not received any response. It is 1 week shy of 30 days and feel I deserve a refund!  Will not purchase their products again...EVER!</li>
    <li> This self tanner was kind of blotchy when sprayed on and stained by rug. i wish i would of just bought one.</li>
    <li> I recently have quit basking in the sun and turned to self tanners with so many out on the market it is hard to pick and chose one that will go with your skin tone &amp; not turn orange. I bought this product and it smells fabulous. I love the color it provides and it is buildable. IF you are looking for an instant tan that is maybe for an even or an evening out this is it. But remember this does wash off. You have to make sure that after applying you let it dry on your skin for longer than the can says because it will come off on your clothes if not dry. The color is a golden beachy tan that looks great! The draw back I had is that the nozzle after using I think lets some of the product settle in it so upon spraying again the next time it kind of comes out on the skin as a splattered effect. So what I did was take a towel shake it real good and then spray it on a towel first to get any of it out of the nozzle before applying on myself. Make sure you hold the can at least 6 inches away from skin, then spray away. When using on my face I apply it on a sponge then wipe on face, I do not spray directly on face because it will clog your pores and get into your hair! :)</li>
    <li> Toma&#x27;s provides a GREAT looking color, deep and rich without any orange. I also really like Fake Bake Airbrush, but the nozzle clogs easily. Toma&#x27;s is identical as far as color depth. It is a beautiful bronze, like a trip to the Caribbean. The down side of the product, its every where. I use it in my shower to contain the spray, this helps a lot. The coloring is even and natural looking on the body as well as on the hands, elbows, and feet. It is worth it. There is no weird, self-tanner smell either, its great. I was most impressed with how natural it is on the hands and feet, its a great product. The spray lightly mists the skin so when you apply it to the feet or hands it creates a natural blending in with your palms and soles, not the weird line Mystic or other self-tanners create. I absolutely would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> You better be in a bubble when you spray this bc it gets EVERYWHERE</li>
    <li> Toma&#x27;s airbrush tan is one of the browner colors I&#x27;ve ever used to be quite honest. The smell is citrus and the color is beautiful, however, if you&#x27;re one to use gloves with a spray tan, this product will smear and look a little funky...It won&#x27;t come out uneven when you shower, though.</li>
    <li> I also tried this product per the recommendation of one of my favorite beauty bloggers (Cara of Maskcara!), and it really suited my purposes well. I am pretty fair-skinned and sometimes just need a little tan boost. I no longer use tanning beds, so I thought this would be nice to add a little dimension to my face and neck. My face gets covered in a lot of SPF during my skincare and makeup routine, so it usually ends up looking a little pale compared to my arms and legs, even in the summer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t do a continuous spray, just a few little blended blasts where needed. I think that is how some other reviewers could improve their at-home self-tan routine- too much product from a can like this will easily create patches and streaks! I acknowledge that there was some slight spitting from the container, but the product goes on so feather-light it was easy to blend any splotches out, and like I said, try to limit loooong strokes of continuous spray. It really is a nice product, and seeing as I don&#x27;t use it for full-body, it will definitely last me awhile!</li>
    <li> I have 4 teen girls and they love this product.  The best natural tan you get in convenience of your home. No streaking or &amp;#34;orangey&amp;#34;.  Live in Utah so a base tan helps when the cold weather hits.  I buy this in several quantities at a time.. Best stuff out there and my girls have tried many products.  Even have their friends loving it.</li>
    <li> They really need to rethink the spray cap. I&#x27;ve gotten 4 bottles that don&#x27;t spray because the sprayer is broken or clogged.</li>
    <li> Color is bronze, with no hints of orange which is all great... however this nozzle sprays the formula our much too thick and there are times were large brown dots splatter onto my skin, which I have to then rub in for even coverage, otherwise it&#x27;s like adding freckles to your body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent is decent and does not leave behind any foul after odors, and the formula dries fast.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If they could just fix the nozzle on this one it would be a 5 star product, but due to the way it flies out of the nozzle I had to remove a star.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had been using SunlessPro spray tan, which works perfectly but the price is killer. I figured I would try Tomas for a cheaper solution. The results are nice as I stated, but the result is not as even as sunlesspro. You get what you pay for I suppose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all though, color is gorgeous, but you will have to rub it in if it comes out funky or in splattered dots. Otherwise you end up with an un-even looking tan.</li>
    <li> Came out blotchy like I had freckles. I follow a beauty blog for a girl who swears by it though... [...]</li>
    <li> Goes on great but I&#x27;m not a fan of the smell. I put it on before bed so I have plenty of time to let it dry.</li>
    <li> I had a wierd arm tan from a t-shirt and needed to wear a halter dress for my best friend&#x27;s wedding.  I was able to use this product to help blend in the tan line.</li>
    <li> Never used this before and needed a quick tan for beach night at the casino,,,,boy, was it quick..being a first timer, I kinda got a little too much on legs, but thank god its winter and I can cover them till it wears off!  I&#x27;m good now, but good to know there&#x27;s a product out there if u need something quick!  Thanks again..  I will know how to use it next time!  Lol</li>
    <li> Ordered this tanner for my face and chest as opposed to an all over body tanner. Goes on easily and it&#x27;s a nice color. It could definitely be used as a all over body tanner too. Color is natural and smell is not bad like with some other self-tanning products. Good choice for your fake n bake summer tan!&lt;br /&gt;Ordered after recommended by Cara @maskcara</li>
    <li> Perfect, natural bronze tan!!!! I love it for my chest and face, kind of splotchy for the arms and legs.</li>
    <li> When I first got this, I thought it was a dud. I could not get it to come out! Eventually I pressed on the very back of the sprayer and it came out beautifully. It was actually brown, not at all orange-y, and it hasn&#x27;t caused me any trouble whatsoever (no clogged pores! :D). I use it on my face and chest, sometimes arms, and you can hardly even see a tan line where it cuts off because the spray makes it so gradual, however, very build-able. I have tried Sun Labs and Jergens, both good, but this is definitely the best of the trio.</li>
    <li> I have pale skin, but this gives me good color.  Make sure to rub it in.  It does not last very long, but when applied, dries very quickly.</li>
    <li> Sucky product! It smells really awful and I wanted to return it but because it&#x27;s an aerosol and considered hazardous r something</li>
    <li> This is the only &amp;#34;spray&amp;#34; tan that actually works for me without looking dotted or discolored.  Just make sure you allow it to dry without touching it.</li>
    <li> Coming from someone who has used a tanning bed for 8 years, this product is awesome! Just as the other reviewers have said, I did have issues with the way it sprays sometimes. However, it is a simple fix to just use a make up sponge to rub the excess in. It takes some practice but it is very functional once you get the hang of it! The color is absolutely gorgeous. The best way to achieve the darkest color is to put a layer on and it let dry before applying another layer. This is one of the best smelling ones that is probably on the market. It is a citrus smell and it does dry relatively faster than the other ones that I have used! As someone else mentioned, if they would only change the nozzle it would be perfect, but it still works very well the way that it is! I probably got about 6-8 full body tans out of one can but I did not use it every week, only when I was going somewhere and wanted to appear tan.</li>
    <li> I really like this product,I use it on my face.good color,not orange.I plan on buying keeping this in stock always</li>
    <li> I bought this after maskcara recommended it. I am pretty fair with freckles and wanted a little color. This is the first tanner I&#x27;ve used and I love the even coverage it gives me, especially on my face. The smell isn&#x27;t horrible and it&#x27;s easy to apply. I&#x27;ll buy more when I run out.</li>
    <li> I was referred to this product, and told it was amazing. Unfortunately they changed their spray bottle, and the product sprays on terrible. Definitely would not recommend it!</li>
    <li> **update** I still really like this, but taking off a star because this is the 2nd time I&#x27;ve received a can that doesn&#x27;t wok properly. Frustrating. First I got a can that wouldn&#x27;t spray at all, then I just got one (different seller) that sprays all thick and wonky. I look like I got too close to a car that drove through a mud puddle right next to me. :( And FYI Amazon won&#x27;t let you return it because they say it&#x27;s considered Hazardous Materials so you have to hope the seller takes your word for it and sends you a new one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am suuuper fair, and use this mostly on my chest and neck every couple of days. The color is instant and natural looking. One bummer is that it does come off on my sheets but it washes right out. Doesn&#x27;t stain my countertops or clothing. (I know I should be spraying it in the shower, but I don&#x27;t have a mirror!) As far as the sprayer issues- sometimes it sprays large drops. All you have to do is wipe the nozzle if you notice it&#x27;s getting drippy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway... really happy with this. I did get a can once that didn&#x27;t work and seller sent me a new one, which was great.</li>
    <li> This was recommended and smells great and works great too! Use a little or a lot, looks natural. Wash hands as soon as you are done.</li>
    <li> This product is actually good. The sprayer on the can is not perfect though. I just use it on my face and neck as an extra tan boost in addition to the bronzer that I use. I have fair skin naturally. This product works for me. It gives me a light amount of color that looks natural. I put it on after my face moisturizer and before my primer. I use the product every time I&#x27;m wearing make-up. The bottle also lasted a long time! My last purchase was in early January 2015 and I&#x27;m just re-purchasing this now in late March 2015. It&#x27;s definitely worth it for the price. I would not recommend this for using for a full-body tan. I think it&#x27;s better just for giving small areas some color. I&#x27;d recommend making sure your skin is hydrated and also smoothing the product in after you spray it on.</li>
    <li> I am giving this product three stars because the color is beautiful golden tan color not orange .. It does however transfer easily!</li>
    <li> One of my favorite summer and winter beauty products!! I have a skin condition and this takes care of that.</li>
    <li> There wasn&#x27;t anyway to &amp;#34;rub it in&amp;#34;.  I followed instructions exactly and it was spotty.  I have tried 100&#x27;s of self tanners.  I guess I will just continue my search.</li>
    <li> I have used the L&#x27;Oreal spray tan on my face and neck successfully in the past, which worked out well for me because it went on very evenly and landed in all the little crevices that it would be hard to get in with lotion (like the ears, who wants a tan face but white ears?). A blogger recommended this for the face so when I saw it at Sally Beauty Supply I grabbed it thinking that it would be better than the L&#x27;Oreal which was just the tiniest bit too orange for my liking. This was a waste of money. It sprays on terribly, and leaves little droplet of tanner on me instead of spraying out a nice even mist, so I have to spray it on, then rush in with my tanning towel to rub it all in before it dries in order to get a remotely even looking tan. I gave it two stars instead of one because it does have a good color to it, not at all orange, but I won&#x27;t buy this again.</li>
    <li> Works great! Use it for my face only.</li>
    <li> Number 1 I&#x27;m a male. Number 2 I live in Miami Beach FL. You may be wondering why someone in Miami Beach FL would use this product. After all, isn&#x27;t getting a tan on the beach (the traditional way, from the sun) what thousands of people take vacations and travel great distances to come there TO DO ? Right? Well yes, that&#x27;s true. But vacationing here and living here permanently are two entirely different experiences, and I won&#x27;t go into all the reasons why here &amp; now but even though you may not understand or find it hard to believe at first I will tell you \\&quot;from an insider&#x27;s perspective\\&quot; that there are an abundance of alternative tanning facilities in use besides the use of this product. However, they are both time consuming and costly, unlike this product. And, you don&#x27;t have to deal with traffic, other people, etc. You can&#x27;t beat the convenience factor. Or the price. I checked. If you consider that you&#x27;ll probably get about two or maybe three uses per bottle, and average the cost per ounce of Toma&#x27;s I think you&#x27;ll quickly realize that it&#x27;s your best bang for your buck. To be honest with you, I was a little edgy the next day after I showered off the bronzer. I wasn&#x27;t as dark as I thought I should have been. But, I was definitely noticeably tan, compared to previously. Well, have you ever gotten too much sun and came indoors, saw the redness, knew you had gotten at least a mild sunburn, but then a few hours later when you see yourself again the redness is even more pronounced, like the sunburn had continued to \\&quot;come out\\&quot; while you weren&#x27;t paying attention. Well that is exactly what happened to me with this product. Today is a Wednesday and I put it on last Saturday night. I could re-apply right now, but to be honest with you, I still have a rich enough color that I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s necessary before tomorrow at the least. And, if you read about some kind of funny smell, let me tell you, some people are more sensitive that others, and others are just plain ole whiny people. Okay. Smell, schmell. I noticed a feint mild smell that to me was about as much to complain about as when you take the cap off of a bottle of rubbing alcohol. ?So what? big deal.. after about 15 minutes I was oblivious to it.. it wasn&#x27;t the \\&quot;offensive\\&quot; overpowering disinfectant kind of odor you may be wondering about, trust me- it&#x27;s crumbs. And, when you consider how cheap this stuff is, and how nice a glow you get, and the convenience I mentioned, that very slight medicinal type scent is a small concession to concede. And that&#x27;s why I&#x27;m taking the time to type this, because I&#x27;m getting ready to order a couple more.. I&#x27;m gonna show some to some friends of mine as a conversation item....  Think about this.. for about what costs at a fast food franchise two meals ... how many times have you ordered something on a menu you never ate before but it&#x27;s not like you were going broke over it just trying it out.. you could do a lot worse than this time...</li>
    <li> I was not able to use this at all. The sprayer was broken so it did not spray easily.</li>
    <li> After reading the reviews I thought I could tolerate the smell but it really bothered me.  It wasn&#x27;t as easy to spray as I thought.</li>
    <li> the color is ok but the push button is difficult to use and to aim at ones self.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t understand all the hype? It comes out splotchy so you don&#x27;t have a lot of control over the spray nozel, it just spews it out so inconsistently! Definitely rub some lotion on top to even it out. AND WASH YOUR HANDS! DRIES SO FAST!</li>
    <li> I purchased this a few days ago at a Sally store and I am pretty happy with it.  I use a make-up applicator sponge to do my face and neck and I stand in the shower to spray everywhere else and I also use the make-up sponge to even out the sprayed area. If you hold it the recommended distance it leaves a nice fine spray but the sponge helps if you go a little heavy in some areas. It doesn&#x27;t have much of an odor at all and it does dry quickly.  I am normally pretty fair skinned although I do tan nicely if I go regularly, and this spray leaves a nice brown color and doesn&#x27;t appear orange.  Its just enough to give you some color where ever you may want it.  I have not had any trouble with my elbow or knee area but I do not direct the spray over those areas but I will spread it lightly over with the make-up sponge.  I do not see any uneven streaking or blotching.  I have used other self tanners in the past that leave you orange or blotchy after they start to wear off and have the strong odor. This does not do any of this. I would definitely recommend it. I am not trying to get super dark with this, rather just a little color now that fall is here so I cant speak for how it looks if you are trying to get to that deep dark color.  I think I would try the lotion the next time instead of the spray only because it does make a mess which is why i stand in the shower so i can rinse it away. I have not worn glove and the only place on my hands i have got the spray is on my finger tips im spraying with or sponging with but seems to wash right off if you do it right away.</li>
    <li> This was my first tan in a can but it is AWESOME!!! I will be ordering again definitely! !!</li>
    <li> This is some of the best stuff right here!</li>
    <li> SPLOTCHES EVERYWHERE... STREAKY... FAKE LOOKING</li>
    <li> Works really well and stays on my face through about 3-4 days of washing.</li>
    <li> Absolutely the best! U will not get a better tan in salon. I use this so I don&#x27;t have to damage my skin outside or in a tanning bed. As long as you have some makeup pads, you will have a beautiful and flawless tan. Product is amazing!! I love it so much that I keep a spare put up so I don&#x27;t ever run out!</li>
    <li> Found this product on pinterest. Have not tried it out yet but from what i heard it is amazing. I am def going to put it on standing in the shower as to not get it all over my bathroom. I mainly purchased this for my back, stomach, and face area.</li>
    <li> I am an avid Pinterest user, I found a blog for how to stay tan when you cannot be outside all the time. I really liked this product!</li>
    <li> I was hopeful for this. I prepped my legs for the tan (they were my test since I can cover with pants) by washing, exfoliating, lotion on knees and ankles, shaving etc. i proceeded with the tan as directed and holy cow was it TERRIBLE. It spit a huge glob right off, and the spray is not even. It spray in subtle puffs so you end up looking like you have a disease. It also sticks to your pores on your legs making you look like your covered in blackheads. I didn&#x27;t even get through one leg before I raced back to the bathroom. Luckily, crest mouth wash instantly removed all the tanner from my leg. 15 bucks literally washed down the drain. What a waste. I am going to try the fake bake flawless this time. I should have in the first place. DON&#x27;T BUY THIS.</li>
    <li> I chose this tanner based on a recommendation I had read on a blog I follow and I am so glad I did! The color comes out very natural looking - not orange at all and since it&#x27;s a spray, it&#x27;s super easy to apply.  I&#x27;m naturally very fair skinned and the color still looks natural. I apply to my face and neck every 3-4 days.  I&#x27;d recommend using it for your body as well, but it may be kind of expensive since you&#x27;d go through the product pretty quickly.</li>
    <li> Love Tomas, but stick with the cream. This runs and streaks</li>
    <li> not sure how anyone makes this product work.... it&#x27;s impossible to get an even distribution and it&#x27;s REALLY dark!</li>
    <li> I have started using this tanner primarily for my face, chest and neck.  It is super awesome.  I still use lotion for the rest of my body to save money, but the color is great and it doesn&#x27;t break me out.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve applied this self-tanner twice now. The first time I was concerned b/c when I sprayed, I had concentrated areas, I rubbed it in with my hands and then then had to wash my hands about a dozen times to be sure I didn&#x27;t have super brown palms :) They did show brown and not orange so that was positive. I followed the directions with light applications but I didn&#x27;t notice a huge difference though for this next time, I may apply two coats back-to-back to get more of an impact. The smell of this one is really good and I typically use a lotion formula b/c I haven&#x27;t had luck with a spray but this one sprays well and consistently. It does go EVERYWHERE though so I have to wipe down the bathroom when I&#x27;m done. Also, stand on a mat or else you&#x27;ll turn the bottom of your feet brown when you move around and pick up residue from your tile floor.</li>
    <li> I have been using the lotion for 10 years and swear by it for natural looking color!  Only last summer did I notice the product enhancing the pores on my legs, as another person posted.  Take your time for best results.  I suggest putting a moisturizer on after showering and immediately follow with the tanner, thoroughly massaging into skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have received many compliments over the years on my &#x27;tan&#x27; and when I share my secret, people are surprised.</li>
    <li> I love this product.  I only use it on my face and neck area, but haven&#x27;t found it to clog my face and gives great, natural color.</li>
    <li> My teenage daughter has been using this product for about a year, applying it before special events.  The color gives her an even, all over bronze color with no orange.  I have had one can clog, but washed the spray cap off and it worked again.  I spray her down with 2 light coats.  You can get 2 full body tans out of one can.  As another reviewer stated, there have been times when it has &#x27;spit\\&quot; when I spray which has left freckle sized spots.  I used the corner of a paper towel to touch the spot and they absorb into the towel and are gone.  For the price, this product can&#x27;t be beat.  Looks better than some expensive professional spray tans she has gotten.</li>
    <li> This stuff s horrible.  Streaks like you would not believe. I am fair skinned and have sunless tanned for years.&lt;br /&gt;I will not be buying this again.  Spray mechanism left tanner running down my leg.</li>
    <li> Such a nice spray. I use it on my face almost daily and it doesn&#x27;t clog pores or give you an orange color. I do exfoliate my face daily so some gets scrubbed off every day too!</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing... I use it on my face and legs... smells good too.</li>
    <li> Bought this product along with Sun Laboratories overnight tan...I usually use the lotion on my body and decided to use this one for my face, hoping for a more even application. While the color (luckily) turned out nicely, this product did not absorb very well into my skin and ended up all over my pillow while I slept, completely staining it. The lotion did not end up on my sheets or pajamas. Will not be using this product again overnight, which really limits my ability to use it as I hate to walk around all day wearing it while it sets.</li>
    <li> This spray is so natural looking and so easy to use. It sprays evenly and layers naturally. Use to hide veins, bruises or tan lines on your body. Perfect for a quick tan. Best spray tan ever</li>
    <li> This was yet another recommendation from a favorite beauty blogger that I follow. I am very pasty pale and ordered this so that I could have a little color as a base for my makeup. I must say, I love how it goes on and looks so natural. It comes out in a fine mist for a subtle hint of color. What I don&#x27;t like: it smells like tanner, it washes off so I have to reapply every day, the bronzer can rub off onto clothes.</li>
    <li> It has a great color, however not worth coming in the airbrush can since the nozzle is definitely NOT a fine spray, so half the time I have to rub it in. Will splotch if not rubbed in or blotted carefully.</li>
    <li> I have tried a LOT of self tanners and this is my least favorite. The spray comes out in streaks, it makes a mess, and it gathers in pores. Even rubbing it in is not worth it.</li>
    <li> So far, i really like this product, my husband cannot smell it -which is always a big deal. He can always tell when I have used tanner. It is very nice for use on shoulders and back, hard to reach places. I will purchase again.</li>
    <li> Not bad but sprays out sometimes too much tanner in a glob even if you shake the can properly. It does however give you a nice color not fake. You do have to blend in quickly with a gloved hand as if you wait it peels off.</li>
    <li> Toma&#x27;s works great.  No streaks and a nice tan.  My daughter and I will continue to use this product in the future.</li>
    <li> Used this product in the past with great success. This new formula is awful. Will not go on smoothly, streaky, and makes skin look dirty not tanned. Maybe I&#x27;ll use it to go as PigPen for Halloween.</li>
    <li> Great! Even coverage, beautiful color, non-offensive smell. Shipping wasn&#x27;t a problem. The cost was also great. I bought a couple of other products at the same time and I use them together to keep my fake tan lasting! ;-)</li>
    <li> I bought this same product at Sally&#x27;s Beauty, and the sprayer clogged up. I saw it on Amazon and bought it and the sprayer  still gets clogged but not as bad, you have to keep rinsing it,and it just doesn&#x27;t spray well, and that is upsetting because I love the tan it gives you, very natural, not orange at all.</li>
