<li> Sure, my pores would shrink a little, so it would be less noticeable, but without caking on the foundation, you could still see the tiny black specks on my nose.</li>
<li> They were small, med and large.</li>
<li> This is because the natural oils in my pores become oxidized, and turn black.</li>

<li> Cheap but lame.</li>

<li> All 6 inches long.  </li>
<li> You can see them very well in the pores on my nose, like little black speckles.</li>
<li> I don&#x27;t recommend this to everyone because it could be very harsh for sensitive skin.</li>
<li> Nothing ever totally removed the black dots out of my pores.</li>
<li> But this stuff loosened every single plugged pore on my nose!</li>
<li> just as expected.</li>
<li> I could not find any other retail store.  </li>
<li> I have been Using Loofah sponges for years and these by far are the worse, because they never get softer even after boiling.</li>
<li> I cut then in half, so</li>
<li> Too hard; could only use one as the rest were too hard.</li>
<li> I received a bad batch that were moldy and was given a fresh pack as replacement.</li>
<li> Like I said before, this could be too harsh on the skin for some people</li>

    <li> Received order today, Friday, April 17, 2015.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you very much.</li>
    <li> I use these loofas when washing my dishes. Much preferable to plastic plastic plastic.</li>
    <li> I love this loofa what more can I say thy work great just if u have any cuts on u please be careful b/c it dues hurt when u use this and go over a cut when washing with a loofa.</li>
    <li> I have been Using Loofah sponges for years and these by far are the worse, because they never get softer even after boiling. Loofah sponges should in my opinion have a little give to them but these stay hard and dont get even slightly softer.</li>
    <li> always have loved these their great for exfoliating the skin and leaving it soft and new after use in bath or shower</li>
    <li> The loofahs were very good quality, my only complaints were, I got 3 diffrent sizes. I thought they were all going to be the same size in the 3pack that I bought. Not the case here. They were small, med and large. Mabye I didn&#x27;t look good enough when I purchased.&lt;br /&gt;  They arrived on time fast shipping. Packaging was okay doesn&#x27;t take special handling I mean there loofahs. All in all pretty good. Would purchase again.</li>
    <li> This loofa came very quick! Very gentle and effective! I use 1-2 times a week. Works great for self tanning</li>
    <li> Just love how my skin feal after using it, excellent and cheap way for exfoliation.</li>
    <li> They are good for exfoliating.  The don&#x27;t get soft like some other sponges, but I don&#x27;t know how to thoroughly clean them without ruining them???</li>
    <li> Nice quality.  Good price.  Great for cutting into pieces for soaps.</li>
    <li> Too hard; could only use one as the rest were too hard.</li>
    <li> They are huge love them !</li>
    <li> This was a gift for a man who needed to exfoliate all over.  He says it is helping! Yay!</li>
    <li> This review is not on this specific loofah, it is just my experience with using a loofah. I didn&#x27;t purchase mine from here. I got one of these loofahs at a local shop near the sponge docks, here in Florida. I would have never in a million years think to buy this, until the owner of the shop told me how great it is for exfoliating. I have bought multiple exfoliating scrubs, hoping to loosen the plugged sebum in my nose. The difference between blackheads and plugged sebum is that blackheads can go away and not come back for months, but plugged sebum is kind of &amp;#34;chronic&amp;#34;, and will reappear every few days. This is because the natural oils in my pores become oxidized, and turn black. You can see them very well in the pores on my nose, like little black speckles. Since my nose makes natural oils everyday, this is reoccurring. I&#x27;ve done my research and some people have this problem, some don&#x27;t. The best thing to do is to just keep up with a solid skin care routine and maintain it. Basically, keep unplugging them when you wash your face. However, I couldn&#x27;t find a product that could ever unplug the sebum in the first place! I have tried blackhead strips, charcoal scrubs, apricot scrubs, oil-cleansing... You name it! Nothing ever totally removed the black dots out of my pores. Sure, my pores would shrink a little, so it would be less noticeable, but without caking on the foundation, you could still see the tiny black specks on my nose. I have wanted so badly to just be able to go out without foundation because my skin is pretty clear and decent on its own. But because of the plugged sebum on my nose, it was never an option. THIS LOOFAH IS A MIRACLE! (All caps for extra emphasis.) I don&#x27;t recommend this to everyone because it could be very harsh for sensitive skin. But this stuff loosened every single plugged pore on my nose! I wet the sponge in the shower, then applied a charcoal cleanser (which I have used before and only shrunk my pores, but not loosened the sebum)to my entire face. I then scrubbed the cleanser into my face using the loofah, focusing mostly on my nose. I rinsed it off and got out the shower, and OMG! All the black specks were gone! I will continue to add this to my skin care routine and now be able to just apply a moisturizer and go! No more heavy foundations for me! Like I said before, this could be too harsh on the skin for some people but if you have a similar problem like me, definitely give it a shot!</li>
    <li> I received a bad batch that were moldy and was given a fresh pack as replacement. I didn&#x27;t ask for this, but I&#x27;m very happy. Great service. Thank you</li>
    <li> The package contained one nice sized loofah and an assortment of small bits of loofah of various sizes. Cheap but lame.</li>
    <li> The loofahs do a great job</li>
    <li> As promise deliver on time works great, and  great price good quality Thanks</li>
    <li> They don&#x27;t feel &amp;#34;too abrasive&amp;#34; for me which is subjective...  Nice shape when received not flattened.  Look like the picture.  Smallest was 3 inches in diameter others were 3.5 - 4 inches across.  All 6 inches long.  Ordering more now.</li>
    <li> Wished they were a bit smaller but still work.</li>
    <li> The recipient used to be a committed shower user.  Now she is a bath addict. Need any  more be said?</li>
    <li> Despite prolonged soaking, I haven&#x27;t been able to soften these sponges to the point where I can use one.  I checked online and read that soaking in water and bleach will soften them.  I haven&#x27;t tried that yet.</li>
    <li> To  hard, might as well use a rock</li>
    <li> This product is not recommended.  It smells bad or weird when it is wet.  I wonder how this product is processed.</li>
    <li> I liked the size and shape.&lt;br /&gt;Cleaned well and uniform and easy to apply to my recipe.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this product without any hesitation.</li>
    <li> This loofa is way better than towels and other body cleaning agents! The best thing about this loofa is that the parts are integrated and the strands doesn&#x27;t easily fall off.</li>
    <li> These are huge! I cut then in half, so it&#x27;s like getting 6! They are better for exfoliating than the nylon pouffs.</li>
    <li> As advertised, as needed.</li>
    <li> They worked really well for what I needed them for</li>
    <li> The product came ahead of schedule which was great; however, it wasn&#x27;t what I was expecting. I got three loofas, but one was really tiny and the other two where huge. I had planned on a project that needed these to be uniform in shape (like the picture) and sadly they were not.</li>
    <li> These are listed as being about 6 inches, and that&#x27;s just what they are. Perfect size for my hand.</li>
    <li> These were a great bargain and shipped fast. I sliced them up into one inch slices and then used them in soap molds to make exfoliating bars of soap for holiday gifts. Just added a bit of festive colors and some peppermint oil. They were a hit.</li>
    <li> Excellent for scrubbing skin.</li>
    <li> I bought these for my nephew. He loves them. We used to bring them from back home but now no on has traveled there so I had to order them.</li>
    <li> These natural loofas work great for exfoliating. I can tell the difference how itchy my skin feels during the day when I use the natural loofa as compared to a non natural loofa. Will definitely buy these again!</li>
    <li> The loofas were the size pictured on the site. May buy more for gifts and crafts.</li>
    <li> I just started using it and I&#x27;ve noticed a bit of an odor.  Hopefully this goes away soon.</li>
    <li> A MUST HAVE TO EXFOLIATE, NATURAL, CALMING RELIEF</li>
    <li> Product received as advertised. All three are the same size. Loofah exfoliates as I&#x27;d hoped. I will be ordering again .</li>
    <li> Love the feel. Great seller. Taking a shower makes a great shower. The Loofa is like an experience that every day should have.</li>
    <li> I think these are great loofah sponges. They are larger than the ones are used to get at Target.  I grew frustrated because Target was usually out of stock. I could not find any other retail store.  I&#x27;m not sure why other reviewers say that they are small.  I think that they are perfect size and even a lot larger than i thought they would be.</li>
    <li> These were smaller than I had hoped. I wanted a LARGE/WIDE loafer. I kept them just because, but I wasn&#x27;t very happy with size. I will not be buying again. I have had larger/wider loafers (bought in Africa) these had good texture, they will scrub your body good,- I was just mad that they were tiny</li>
    <li> So far, so good.  Seems like any good loofah I&#x27;ve used.  Great price.</li>
    <li> The sponges were of a substandard quality they were extremely small and tore apart after using it once. I will not be buying these again</li>
    <li> just as expected. excellent and very good</li>
    <li> Perfect loofa sponges....what is there to say??</li>
    <li> I love loofahs! I love using something natural, not processed. I also love that these will not take years to break down in landfills. They hold their form and are sturdy for months. If I had space, I&#x27;d grow my own. This was a great deal in my book.</li>
    <li> 100% Satisfied with this product.  Fast ship&lt;br /&gt;and the folks were very Professional.&lt;br /&gt;Many Thanks!</li>
    <li> As others posted this product comes in irregular shapes.  I am using them for personal use and in homemade soaps so it&#x27;s not the end of the world for me, although a fair frustration.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 34 years old and I&#x27;ve used all my life this natural sponges that come from a dry pumpkin as shower scrub (also known as zacate).&lt;br /&gt;I got them in four different countries and this ones are the worse I ever got. Actually, they are so hard they are useless. Others become soft once they are wet.&lt;br /&gt;Usually I cut them lengthwise to use the inner side as a rougher surface. but this time they where all super stiff. I was so happy to find them in amazon...</li>
