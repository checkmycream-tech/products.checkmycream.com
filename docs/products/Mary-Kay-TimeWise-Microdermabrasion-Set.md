<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> The set arrived in great condition, and it&#x27;s a fantastic product! Very pleased!! 😊</li>
    <li> Provides really good micro abrasion facial scrub. I also like the SPF protection built info lotion that you use after applying the micro abrasion.</li>
    <li> This is an amazing product - makes your skin look new when used weekly!!!  I can&#x27;t live without it. Love it!</li>
    <li> Mary Kay&#x27;s Microdermabrasion set is wonderful! I am in my late 20&#x27;s and I use this twice a week after my daily face washing routine. It helps get those dead cells off your face leaving it soft and smooth. Would highly recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> This product is great.  Use it three times a week and you will see the difference in the smoothness of your skin and a clarity.  Excellent service and price.</li>
    <li> This product didn&#x27;t do a whole lot for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does exfoliate gently...but I&#x27;ve had better results using a gentle Buff Puff.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff!  I have some large pores on my nose where I get some tough blackheads and this makes them soooo much smaller.  The only reason I gave it a 4/5 is because I wish they came in bigger bottles!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Mary Kay TimeWise Microdermabrasion for several years and I absolutely love it!  I would recommend this over and over again.  I use it every other day to exfoliate my face.  This helps reduce blackheads and the appearance of large pores.  It&#x27;s also great for fine wrinkles. I&#x27;ve tried many other exfoliating products and this is by far my favorite!</li>
    <li> I received several compliments on how good my skin looked.  It works really good and the lotion makes your skin feel so good.</li>
    <li> OK I am always skeptical of products, especially expensive ones. My mom bought it for me, and I was disappointed with how small the bottles are. I tried it one time and I was so impressed that I bragged about it to everyone. I have KP (little tiny bumps) and little black dots in the pores of my nose (not blackheads, had them my whole life)... and after only one time, my skin was super smooth and those black spots were 90+ % gone! I was shocked. I wish I could use this system everyday because it just makes my skin absolutely glow. It also reduced some visibility of scars and pores, but I can&#x27;t say it does too much for wrinkles.</li>
    <li> Mary Kay&#x27;s Microdermabrasion Set works wonders on the skin when used once a week. It consists of an exfoliating scrub and a special moisturizer, though the moisturizer runs out long before the scrub so I often just use my regular moisturizer after my shower (and that seems to work just fine). The scrub removes impurities and leaves the skin feeling fresh and revitalized, as well as silky-smooth. It is supposed to make you look younger, and I&#x27;m just starting to approach the age where that matters! :-) The only downside to this product is the price, which is pretty steep. However, the scrub lasts a long time, so it isn&#x27;t a bad value in the long run.</li>
    <li> I was very nervous trying something like this instead of going to my derm.  I have acne scarring and am trying to go for budget-friendly alternatives that will have results.  I have used the product twice so far and have noticed a slight difference.  After using my skin does feel very smooth.  It took FOREVER for the products to arrive though which was kind of a bummer.</li>
    <li> As a current Mary Kay consultant of only 21 years of age, I am not experiencing wrinkles just yet. I use the basic skin care set but I don&#x27;t feel results like what this product gives me. After using the Microdermabrasion just once, it completely removes the dead skin and totally rejuvinates the skin. Smooth as a baby&#x27;s bottom. I absolutely love this product and would recommend it to anyone! Plus, if the price is too expensive, become a consultant and get it at 1/2 price!</li>
    <li> It has being Three Months since i&#x27;ve been used the Microdermabrasion set, i have not seen big change. However, it&#x27;s good for dry Skin. It fade little bit my scares acne, but this is not the way i was told it worked. I was expecting from this product openes the pores, but it does not go into the skin. it does not go deep. So far i&#x27;m in my second set, but my deep scar acne still on my face. The product so small I do not know how many I will need to get way of my scar acne. Besides, my acnes still pop up. However, do not give-up because it is very good for dry/sensitive skin. No matter how dry and sensitive your skin is, it helps. This product need a good bleaching bar soap along with it to help get way of the scar acne faster. As i said, do not give it up because it is a good help for people who have very sensitive and Dry skin like me, this is keep me still using it. For the dry and sensitive skin, you&#x27;ll see the change right away, but for the acne scars, you won&#x27;t see in two weeks as the producers said. I&#x27;m going to my third set twice a day, my light acne scars are starting to fade up. I meant for the deep scars, i have not seen big change. It workd very slow on that.</li>
    <li> Works better than any other exfoliant out there.</li>
    <li> This microabrasion formula is excellent. My face feels so smooth after finishing the routine past cleansing. My face looks better, too. I am very happy with the Mary Kay line of facial cleansing and moisturizing products!</li>
    <li> One use and I&#x27;m happy, smooth, silky skin right away.</li>
    <li> Mary Kay makes my  face feel really cleansed,softer. My dermatologist told me to keep using it. My skin is really bad,this stuff really works wonders!</li>
    <li> I am so happy I was able to find this product at Amazon.I have used it before and I love what it does for my skin. I am telling my friends check Amazon for this product.</li>
    <li> It cleans my skin and it feels very smooth. I can recommend it to my friends. Up to now I am using this product.</li>
    <li> I love Mary Kay, and this is a must for every woman over 35! Your skin will be noticeably smoother, softer, and it reduces wrinkles. I also use the timewise set from MK and I am not sure if its a combination or just this product, but I have noticed that my skin is &#x27;tighter&#x27; looking, or firmer. I just turned 48 about a week ago and I still have people think that I am in my 30&#x27;s.</li>
    <li> I love mary kay products. They are a little more expensive than most cosmetics but the quality is top notch. The products are not tested on animals and come from&lt;br /&gt;a company that believes in the golden rule. I am happy with the set.</li>
    <li> Very fast shipping! Only concern in that the product is not the same as the picture shown, it is the older version of this product. Still a good buy.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product from a Mary Kay party with no expectations in mind. I know a couple people who love their set, but they didn&#x27;t really give me any information on what the products did for them. My Mary Kay consultant told me to use it 1-2 times per week with my sensitive skin, BUT I&#x27;ve been using it every night before bed for the past 2 weeks &amp; seeing GREAT results. Smooth skin, reduced pores, no oil throughout the day, acne scars deminishing quickly, no new acne appearing, and glowing skin. I&#x27;ve used many products on my skin to deal with acne, including Accutane, and this product impresses me more than anything thus far.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t afford to order it right now (I&#x27;m buying my favorite products every few months when I have the extra money. Waiting on the lip mask now, and this is probably next on my list), but I tried a sample a few months ago at a Mary Kay party. The host instructed us to only do half our face, and I immediately noticed a huge difference. My skin was so glowy and smooth, I wanted to do my whole face. It makes your skin feel like butter and super clean (even though it doesn&#x27;t technically clean your skin). It even lasted hours after the party and into the next day. My makeup went on much smoother the morning after.</li>
    <li> This was a life-saver for me when I was preparing for my wedding day and trying to get my face picture-perfect after some acne treatments. My dermatologist approved and I was so pleased with the results.</li>
    <li> amazing!!!!!! I had recieved a small sample of the mary kay timewise microdermabrasion duo from a friend. I finally decided to use it after i threw it in my bathroom vanity for weeks. I couldnt believe how soft my skin was!!!! no joke!!! I looked up how much it was on the mary kay website because at this point i had to have it!!! Well needless to say it was very expensive threw mary kay. 55 bucks to be exact!!! i found it for alot cheaper here and it came quick same exact product as the sample i had used and my skin is looking great!!!! one of my best purchases i have ever made and i dont normally put creams and products on my face, i tend to have break outs. I have combo oily skin and im in my early 30s i figured what do i have to loose right? my skin already looks like crap from pimples!!! FYI, makes your pores look smaller to.</li>
    <li> As a Mary Kay Consultant, I was eager to try new things and I was getting married and didnt want to pay $150+ for a try at Microderm. So I got this product and it is GREAT! I am very impressed!!!! It lasts a long time as well so it&#x27;s a great investment. I highly suggest this product!</li>
    <li> This combination works perfect for my skin.  I have used Mary Kay Products for numerous years and love it.</li>
    <li> Have used this product for about three weeks and have noticed a smoother complexion but nothing yet with the pore issue---which is what I purchased it for based on a review that it would minimize large pores.</li>
    <li> Not my favorite microderm produce - Oil of Olay has an excellent one that you can buy online or at the drugstore.  Mary Kay is gentle on the skin but I didn&#x27;t feel it did as much as other similar products.</li>
    <li> Gave this to my daughter in law as it was on her wish list.  She loves it and used right away.</li>
    <li> I used a sample of this product and liked it so much that I am now looking for a cheap alternative. I have never used any of the OTC microderm products before so I can&#x27;t compare this to anything else, but I can say that if I could afford it I would stay with this one. The crystals in step one are very small and uniform (better than Cosmedicine Medi-Morphosis Self-Adjusting Exfoliator, and they don&#x27;t dissolve), and the base isn&#x27;t heavy - definetly more crystal than cream. You use it on wet skin after cleansing so the water is really the vehicle. It rinses easily and there is no residue from moisturizers or creams that other products might leave. Step two is a light lotion that is meant to soothe and protect your skin, and is very nice. I couldn&#x27;t tell which step was better, because the lotion really leaves a nice velvety finish without talc or greasiness. I give the product 4 stars because I don&#x27;t know yet how it compares to Loreal or Olay. I suspect that it is much better than Neutrogena, based on the reviews left for that product.</li>
    <li> You cannot go wrong with this set. This set cleans your face of built up dirt and grim. The gritty face rub leaves your face a little red but that goes away. After the scrub, apply the cream. You do not need a lot. Too  much and you will be clogging your pores again. I always wash my face first with Mary Kay cleanser and then do the scrub. Do not do this more than once a week.</li>
    <li> Mary Kay Micro is great with any skin type and definitely gives you fast results. We usually recommend you use about 3 times a week to get optimum results.  If you are noticing your skin getting more sensitive then cut back to once a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I must say I was surprised to find Mary Kay products on Amazon, but what isn&#x27;t these days?? As an a actual current  beauty consultant for Mary Kay, I see nothing wrong with someone wanting to reach out to women and help them be able to afford our wonderful products. I myself offer 30% off to my regular customers and free shipping when they don&#x27;t live close enough for me to take it to them personally. I even hold phone consultations to talk about their skin needs and check up with them weekly over the phone or email, so sometimes I never meet my clients person to person. So really what is the real difference? Our job is to help educate and help women with feeling more beautiful about themselves no matter where they are located or what their \\&quot; Budget\\&quot; is. Other than having less customer quality control and it being against our rules and regulations for sales, I don&#x27;t see anything wrong with it, so as long as they are able to stand by the 100% money back guarantee that only a current consultant is able to provide. Just don&#x27;t get caught! &#x3D;-)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you would like to know if something is current just go to our website. I do recommend finding a local rep who can offer the 100% money back guarantee and send you samples and flowers and get the real service you deserve as beautiful women!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Micro is great with any skin type and definitely gives you fast results. We usually recommend you use about 3 times a week to get optimum results.  If you are noticing your skin getting more sensitive then cut back to once a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sincerely,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Coty Geiser&lt;br /&gt; So you know this review is from a real consultant ....

    <li> I love this product!! My skin looks and feels so much smoother after just one use!! And with continued use, lines and sun spots start to fade. Very affordable for microderm too :)</li>
    <li> I think this is a good set I really like the moisturizer feels really soft and nice on my face</li>
    <li> Love these reduced my blackheads and the lotion make my skin extremely soft. Although I do have extremely dry skin and this is good to use once a week and no more than that. Also excellent price ! I had been wanting to try this for quit sometime now but didn&#x27;t want to pay the obnoxious price. Will be ordering again on e I run out.</li>
    <li> this product is awesome, you can really feel the sandy particles in the wash which is good for a reall good exfoliating, shipment came on the button</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. After using this set you will have soft skin. Especially step2 is very good for very sensitive skin. I use step2 every morning and night.</li>
    <li> My skin doesn&#x27;t look any better after using it regularly. It also doesn&#x27;t look worse (which I&#x27;d hope for since this isn&#x27;t cheap), but the only thing I really get out of this is the thought that I may be doing something good for my skin, without actually seeing anything.</li>
    <li> This was first introduced to me by my sister years ago.  I used it for quite a long time and started taking it for granted. I then decided to try another from the natural product line I am currently using.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After over a year, I have concluded that the MK brand gives the best results.  My skin looks porcelain smooth, and I am loving it.</li>
    <li> Great product and great seller. great to do business with. About the product lets just keep it short it really does what it says. Good results great price.</li>
    <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE IT!!!!!</li>
    <li> This item came fast. It was brand new. I am glad I bought it from Amazon because I didn&#x27;t see too many results. I used it but I didn&#x27;t see my pores getting smaller. I just felt like it was a nice scrub for my face. Yes it cleaned my face well and took off a layer but I didn&#x27;t see what was so great about it. I am not that impressed to say the least.</li>
    <li> I have been looking for a microdermabrasion set for quite some time.  I have always used some type of exfoliater, but I wanted to use something more for my skin.  This set makes my skin feel so soft and smooth after I use it.</li>
    <li> Love Mary Kay&#x27;s skin care products. Recommend!</li>
    <li> I love this brand and it is an excellent product to have. A good deal even more a bonus than through other vendors.</li>
    <li> By far one of the best skin products I&#x27;ve ever used. I have oily/combination skin and large pores that clog and constantly cause problems. A dermatologist recommended this product at least 3 times a week for my skin type/issues. Within one use I saw great results and after 2 months my pores are practically erased. No more need for facials. For anyone with problem skin, this product is an absolute life saver!</li>
    <li> I am very particular about my face products. I had gone on vacation and realized I left my face wash at home. I used this product (It was all my mom had at the house) and was AMAZED!!! Instant love. I ended up taking the product home with me. Eventually it ran out and I noticed my skin getting dull again. Black heads and hormonal acne (I am 36 yrs old) started moving in. I ordered This kit on Friday and had a Saturday delivery. As son as it arrived Saturday I used it - and INSTANTLY my face looked better. It is now Tuesday and my skin is beautiful. I am at a point in my cycle where my skin should be an absolute mess, but it&#x27;s not. It&#x27;s perfect.&lt;br /&gt;I am in LOVE with this product.&lt;br /&gt;I originally only used step 1 because that was all my mother had on hand at the house. I am now using step 1 &amp; 2 (2 is the replenish - after wash). I can&#x27;t really say how much step 2 is doing for me. I am still using my own moisturizer because I do feel a tad bit dry with just the replenish, but it doesn&#x27;t matter. Step 1 is incredible, even alone. I am hoping the step 2 will do more in terms of fine lines.&lt;br /&gt;Yes - I fully recommend this product.&lt;br /&gt;I have a very oily T-zone and very dry elsewhere on my face. Since this works great on my combinantion skin - I imagine it can be used on Dry or Oily skin</li>
    <li> Just what I ordered, good communications and well handled!!!!</li>
    <li> Amazing! My skin feels incredible after using this.</li>
    <li> This broke me out bad! It gave me cyctic acne, which I&#x27;ve NEVER had! It might work for others, but it didn&#x27;t for me.</li>
    <li> If you are looking for some serious exfoliating, and really want to pamper yourself, then this is what you need!  I&#x27;m not getting paid for any of this, but just think that other people should be as happy as I am with this!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottles are sort of smaller than I thought they would be-but that is okay since you really don&#x27;t use too much of them at all.  Just a tad bit of the tube, and you are silky smooth instantly.  It almost feels like little grains of sand just taking away all of the dead skin cells, and then a new face comes out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It arrived fairly quickly, much faster than I anticipated.  I use the lotion that comes with it, however I&#x27;m sure it wouldn&#x27;t be a big deal to substitute your own if you feel you must.  I like all of it though, so I&#x27;ll continue to use it all :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope it works for all of you too!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hannah</li>
    <li> This is the only product that will get rid of the many bumps on my chin and forehead. I have tried countless others and this is the only one that gives noticeable results! Not to mention  it leaves my skin feeling baby soft and replenished!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Mary Kay Products for 3 years since I was 47 years old. My skin has never looked better. The microdermabrasion is such an amazing exfoliator. I leaves your skin feeling so soft and smooth. The moisturizer replenishes my skin with all the moisture needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Geneen</li>
    <li> Ive used this before and saw it at twice the price, so I really wondered about it, but it does seem to be Mary lay. Either that, or a great knock-off.</li>
    <li> I have used Mark Kay products for years. These prices are cheaper than the reps prices.</li>
    <li> My friend wanted me to try this.  I have very sensitive skin and was very reluctant to try it. Also, I have a lot of redness in my skin (not rosacea but very red) and was worried this product would make it worse.  Well, let me tell ya....loved it!!! Made my face feel so smooth and it&#x27;s like my face wanted to soak it up! Use on your neck too!  Really would recommend this even for sensitive skin!</li>
    <li> This product is great and totally work the money spent. I am 21 years old and using this product to even out my skin tone, which it has done. I also feel its made my pores a lot smaller and just makes my skin feel fresh and fantastic.</li>
    <li> Love it. Arrived on time. Packed nicely. Price was great . Brand new.  Use it once a week as described. Makes skin very smooth feeling.  would order again</li>
    <li> Really liked the results,</li>
    <li> Skin feels amazing after use.</li>
    <li> I am writing a review after I finished the entire bottle. I love this microdermabrasion kit. It&#x27;s awesome, feels great on the skin, and really feels like I was getting rid of dead skin cells on a weekly basis. Need to order again soon.</li>
    <li> I normally don&#x27;t like to write reviews, but I thought I would leave a review for people who are looking into buying this. I have sensitive skin that has never been able to use scrubs on my face. Every time I used a scrub it would be too harsh for me and leave my skin red or irritated. Normally I&#x27;d be able to use scrubs for a week or 2 before my skin would get worse. I had my doubts when I bought this, since it seemed like every other scrub. However after 2 months of using this, once a week, I have to say I&#x27;m very impressed. It has done wonders for my skin, don&#x27;t get me wrong my skin isn&#x27;t completely clear but I can see a noticeable difference in my skin. I&#x27;d say only once since I&#x27;ve used it has it kind of made my skin irritated but other than that one time it&#x27;s been great. I&#x27;m not sure what they put in this thing, but even though it seems like the scrub is harsh it doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin at all. I would say if you want to get rid of dead skin cells without irritation this would be the product for you. However, if you think this is going to magically clear your skin over night, it&#x27;s not. Overtime, it has done wonders for me and that is all I&#x27;m going to say.</li>
    <li> This is a quality microdermabrasion. Step 2 feels gentle on skin</li>
    <li> Love it, my skin feels so soft n clear. Great price.</li>
    <li> I wish I could also use this everyday but I also enjoy using the 3 in 1 cleaner though. I love how the microdermabrasion kit makes my skin glow and even my boyfriend noticed.</li>
    <li> I am very disappointed in the packaging of the Day &amp; Night cream.  It is very wasteful &amp; expensive for what you get.  When I am done with what I have I will not be ordering any thiong from your company.</li>
    <li> Not worth the money and Mary Kay does animal testing.  They went against their word and they do animal testing because they didn&#x27;t want to pass up the money they could get from selling the the Chinese market and in China animal testing is required.  I won&#x27;t buy their products any more.</li>
    <li> Love this product.  My skin is aging and I need to clean away the dead cells.  This is easy to use and once a week on my skin is wonderful.  Brightens my face, and reduces the appearance of fine lines.  The results are immediate, you don&#x27;t have to use it for 3 weeks to see results. Love this product.</li>
    <li> I received a free sample of this product last week and decided to give it a try. Oh no I shouldn&#x27;t have!!! My skin is actually not very sensitive usually. This thing, I used as directed and the step 1 felt actually abrasive but I guess that&#x27;s how it&#x27;s supposed to feel because it is a microdermabrasion kit. I only used the step 1 on my face. Then I used the step 2 all over my face and down to my neck (I always use my moisturizer down to my neck) and finally I went to bed. Next morning I had a horrible itching sensation in my neck, it was so strong that I had to scratch, but the sensation was so strong that I gave my self bruises from all the scratching. I had to run to the drugstore to buy aloe gel to help me with the dermatitis I had developed. However, that was not the worst part. The worst part was that I developed eczema in some parts of my face. My skin is inflamed, purple-red, itchy, dry, feels like sand paper, I mean it is eczema. I had never had one but my sister has.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now I&#x27;ve had to buy a bunch of creams and balms to deal with the problem this kit gave me because I can&#x27;t stand my skin. I&#x27;m pretty sure it was the step 2 that caused me most of the problems because that&#x27;s what I used on my neck. Probably the most ironic part is that the kit didn&#x27;t even reduce my pores at all. I&#x27;ll have big pores and lines any day if I can have my eczema-free skin back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is not worth it, it is SO NOT WORTH IT.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s okay... although I feel like it was not the same stuff I tried when I was buying it with a rep. Felt a bit watered down.</li>
    <li> $20 cheaper than buying it from a Mary Kay rep. Makes my skin so smooth and radiant! Love it alot!</li>
    <li> Have always loved this product and getting it at this price makes me love it even more. My skin looks and feels amazing!</li>
    <li> This is the best microderm abrasion on the market! I use it faithfully once a week.  I prefer to use my regular moisterizer over the replenishment one in the kit.  I highly recomend this product.</li>
    <li> Have been using this for years Great product Skin feels so smooth after using.Would recommend this to anyone Thank you</li>
    <li> this set reallky works to take off dead skin and moisturize...your face will look so much smoother and make up will go on better...only use maybe once a week or it will irratating</li>
    <li> This is one of the best products I have ever used for my skin. Mary Kay is a great brand that does wonders for my skin. I like how firm it feels after using this product, and clean. My face looks cleaner and people have also used the term &#x27;brighter&#x27; after I use this. Refine, step 1: It has scrubbing beads (so only scrub hard like me if you really want to clean, plus those beads feel good :)  --but scrubbing hard is not necessary). This exfoliates and cleanses pores deeply, shrinking pores (if you have an issue with that), and removing dead skin and black/whiteheads etc. (if you have those things), or makes them easy to remove afterwards (if it did not remove during the wash, which it usually does).  Replenish, step 2: This is a very soothing crème, feels nice and smooth when putting on (a thin layer is all that&#x27;s needed). What&#x27;s also cool about this is that if it&#x27;s hot, you don&#x27;t really sweat, you have more of a dewy feel, and it keeps you cool. Just 1 or 2 times a week is all you need to use this product (more than that is just too often). This will all depend on the condition of your skin. This is also beneficial to preventing (early signs of) aging with skin, and starting to use this in your 20s like I have is a smart move. I highly recommend this product to ages ~25+, and, for your regular skin cleansing days, use the Mary Kay Timewise 3 in 1 cleanser. It&#x27;s a lot gentler for such regular use, but still very effective.</li>
    <li> Loved it love it and will love it again</li>
    <li> This set was packaged and delivered with other items I had ordered as well!  It came quickly and Beautifully packaged!  Like I posted with the other items.......it was like coming home from a MK Party!  Thank You!</li>
    <li> I have Sjogren&#x27;s syndrome (the driest skin you can imagine), and this made my face smooth and soft for the first time in years! I am so happy with it. This was my first treatment, and I plan to use it again, so we will see if it continues to wow me!</li>
    <li> This product really works and she has great prices. I love it and will continue to buy it. Use it 2-3 times a week and look great!</li>
    <li> Arrived quickly and in good condition.  This product is excellent as a dermabrasion to use a couple times a week to brighten up your skin.  No issues at all with this purchase.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product on and off for several years. There is a significant difference in my skin when I use Microdermabrasion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will continue to use this product and I encourage others to use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you for the speedy, safe delivery of an excellent product!</li>
    <li> always loved this product. if u like to scrub ur skin this is the ultimate skin scrubber. feels like very fine sand. they don&#x27;t absorb or wear down as u scub so u can continue as long as youd like. reccomend using in the shower though because they&#x27;re so small you&#x27;ll never rinse it all out just at the sink. haven&#x27;t found anything that can give me that silky smooth feeling.... and can&#x27;t beat this price either!</li>
    <li> I use this product about 3 times a week and can see an improvement.  It is getting rid of stubborn whiteheads and does a terrific job cleansing pores.  And it has never irritated my skin.</li>
    <li> Makes my skin smooth after using it,!!arrived in Time.the reason I gave only 4stars is that my skin turn really red after I use it..but it don&#x27;t bother me coz I got a sensitive skin..all in all it&#x27;s worth it</li>
    <li> I read the reviews for this product before I bought it and there were really good reviews on it so I decided to buy it. I have used this product for 4 weeks now and I don&#x27;t see any difference in my skin. I wouldn&#x27;t buy this product again.</li>
    <li> Got so fast my head is spinning Thank you. this is a great at home product and makes your face feel scrubbed clean and refined smooth as a baby. I saved 20$ dollars ordering it here instead of directly through Mary Kay.</li>
    <li> I tried this stuff at a Mary Kay Party and was hooked. I ordered it and tried it. I have been hooked ever since. It cleanses my face and reduces the look of blemishes. THE price is GREAT .They charge double at Mary K.</li>
    <li> love it I want more, left my shin smooth and moisturizes, nice stuff, wish it wasn&#x27;t so exspensive, thank you</li>
    <li> To those who received expired product, it is most definitely because Mary Kay will not buy back product from consultants after a year. Also, this price (while lower than retail) is still profiting the seller. The Microderm retail price is $55 meaning the consultant purchased it for 27.50. So while the seller is not making a large profit, she is selling expired product which is so not good to use. As a consultant myself, I would recommend finding a consultant who can offer you free product when you host a Skin Care Party. You can usually get up to 20% off based on your guests&#x27; purchases and sometimes can earn extra perks for bookings and referrals.</li>
    <li> My face is too sensitive for this product.&lt;br /&gt;I did not read a negative review. If I had, I would not have purchased it.</li>
    <li> I am 48 years old with sensative skin which changes from normal/oily - in summer to normal/dry in winter. So, I was looking for something which will take off dead skin cells but not damage my skin. This set is great_ very easy to use, no redness after, works just great for me.</li>
    <li> Love it! Mary Kay is a quality cosmetic line. This set will deep cleanse the face and leave it soft and new.</li>
    <li> LOVE THIS! Great microdermabrasion set. Not too abrasive. Arrived just as good as from a Mary Kay rep in person!</li>
    <li> As described, fast shipping, great product. Thank you!</li>
    <li> This is a great product -- but I don&#x27;t suggest using it every day. Once or twice a week keeps my adult skin clear of acne. When I run out and go a couple weeks, almost guaranteed a pimple will pop up on my chin. My forehead is prone to be on the rough, bumpy side and this microderm helps that out as well. Before finding this MK product on Amazon (had some bad experiences trying to buy from an MK rep once my normal person got out of the business), I tried some exfoliating products from the big box store. Once was too soapy and didn&#x27;t scrub, one had huge bits off scratchy stuff and was better suited to feet. I gave up and came back to MK. The abrasive is very fine, but very smooth. The lotion feels great afterwards.</li>
    <li> Very happy with product and service by vendor.</li>
    <li> mary kay microdermabrasion, i use it once a week. it is a wonderfull product</li>
    <li> the best product on the market for the price...has been using it for years...skin is so soft after it..absolutely love it</li>
    <li> I love how my face looks and feels after using this!</li>
    <li> Mary Kay products can ONLY be purchased from a legitimate Independent Beauty Consultant. Mary Kay Inc does NOT sell their products any other way. If you are purchasing MK products from Amazon or Ebay they are 99% of the time stolen! If not then they are legally violating their contract and can be prosecuted. Please dont support these criminals. Please support legitimate business owners who do not violate ethical business practices.</li>
    <li> I would recommend this product</li>
    <li> Perfect, leaves my skin smooth and perfect. Absolutely. Recomended</li>
    <li> I find this product a waste of money. I like many other Mary Kay products, but I have found that a small amount of honey with a teaspoon of sugar does the same job as this set for about a nickel.</li>
    <li> I use this product once a week and like it much better than facial masks. It leaves my skin feeling smooth and clean.</li>
    <li> Why paying 50-55$ to a MK representative when can get this for less than 25$ ? Right ? Great product awesome results</li>
    <li> This came in the mail quickly. I am in love with this stuff. I use it about 3 times a week and it makes my face and neck feel smooth. Ive had these hard white bumps on my face and some if them have actually started to come off. I have been using this product for about a month and Im expecting for some if the other bumps to come off.</li>
    <li> This is one of the best products I&#x27;ve ever tried  with other products I would brake out but not this one I recommend this to everyone skin feel do soft and clean love it</li>
    <li> I have been using the microdermabrasion from Mary Kay for about two years and LOVE IT!  I use it twice a week and it keeps my skin fresh and feeling amazing.</li>
    <li> The microdermabrasion is the best defoliant I&#x27;ve found and I would buy it more often if it wasn&#x27;t so expensive</li>
    <li> This is a great product. I&#x27;ve been using it for years- helps to clear up breakouts and minimize pores. Love it.</li>
    <li> Terrible shipping speed but product is great</li>
    <li> try it. am sure you won&#x27;t be disappointed. instant glow - can use just before a party and be ready for compliments</li>
    <li> I had tried the sample and found it to work so well I bought the regular size.</li>
    <li> caused my skin to break out. didn&#x27;t solve dry skin problem. worse than a waste of money.</li>
</ol>
