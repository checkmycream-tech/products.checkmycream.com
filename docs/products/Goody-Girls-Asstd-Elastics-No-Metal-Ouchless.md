    <li> Fyi, these are the smaller-size rubberbands. (I didn&#x27;t know this when I purchased.) Not good for really thick hair. We can still use them, but I really wanted the regular size so I can use them too. Oh well...</li>
    <li> The colours I like alot. The smaller elastics have way more stretch then the bigger ones (kinda weird). It works well for a small child that has fine or thin hair.</li>
    <li> Smaller than I thought they would be, otherwise good</li>
    <li> my daughter loves all the options.</li>
    <li> These are my favorite kind of hair elastics because I can get them around my daughter&#x27;s pony tail at least three times. She&#x27;s almost 4 and has super thick hair. However... They are not the actual colors pictured! The picture shows a set of lightly colored pastel elastics, but what I got was darker, more primary colors. I especially wanted more white elastics, but got none in the set I ordered.</li>
    <li> I bought light color, it came in dark color. Disappointed and the quality is bad</li>
    <li> good assortment of colors and sizes. Some hold better than others but good if you have girls with different thickness of hair. would accomodate most I think.</li>
    <li> My 3 year old loved these! They are thin and colorful and worked great in her hair. Cute color options.</li>
    <li> Nice one very beauty on my girl hair ..</li>
    <li> easier on your long hair than some products</li>
    <li> These were a gift.  They were thrilled at the variety.</li>
    <li> These elastics stay put in my 5 year-old&#x27;s hair! I switched to these from the little rubber bands because my daughter&#x27;s hair was starting to break, and so were the rubber bands. These elastics are brightly colored and cute and stay put all day through Kindergarten!</li>
    <li> Smaller than what I thought; but nice all the same</li>
    <li> Tiny but cute, work as expected. Pretty durable and comfortable. Not too much issue with getting caught even in thick curly hair. Great for braids!</li>
    <li> My 3 year old really likes being able to choose her colors. These have worked very well for us and don&#x27;t seem to catch her hair at all.</li>
    <li> These are nice hair ties. Exactly as pictured. Doesn&#x27;t bream the hair.  No metal piece. Colours are beautiful too. Excellent service!</li>
    <li> They arrived quickly and look very good, better than shown.  My niece will love them Christmas morning.</li>
    <li> very nice and different! good elastic!</li>
    <li> Cute hairbands that don&#x27;t tangle in my daughters curly hair like many others.  Light pastel colors work with her clothing and she has plenty to pick from.</li>
    <li> My daughter is 4 and never lets me put her hair up. I have tried all manner of hair bands, and they always pull her hair when putting them in and taking them out OR they slip out after five minutes. I finally found these and they are perfect. The colors are really cute, and they have different textures. No more complaints from my daughter. I was skeptical to buy them because they are more expensive than other hair ties, but they were worth it. They stay in all day, don&#x27;t stretch out easily and she lets me do her hair every day now.</li>
    <li> Very cheap and bad quality, Too expensive for quality.</li>
    <li> I am only giving four stars because the thicker bands are great. The thin ones do not hold at all.</li>
