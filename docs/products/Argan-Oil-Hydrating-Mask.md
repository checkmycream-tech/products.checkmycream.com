      <li>products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will be picking up more of this product and using it daily to see if it helps to balance things out for me.  </li>
      <li>I ended up having to use a homemade olive oil hot oil treatment to get the results I desired.</li>
      <li>and when i rinsed it off my hair felt super soft!</li>
      <li>My hair is dry and damage, i&#x27;ve dyed my hair way too many times and used lots uf hot tools... but this hydrating mask does make miracles happen.</li>

      <li>My hair does feel and look much healthier now.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s much thicker and my hair feels silkier when I use it.</li>
      <li>This and the normal conditioner keep my hair hydrated until I have to shampoo it!</li>
      <li>I leave it on for about an hour to an hour and a half nearly every time I wash my hair and it leaves it so smooth, soft, shiny, and easy to work with.</li>
      <li>She highly recommends it.  </li>
      <li>Smells amazing, but it does not deep condition my hair has other conditioners have.</li>
      <li>Black 15-in-1 (fast, easy, and helps when styling on days</li>
      <li>I really wanted to like this product, especially since the Argan Oil treatment from this brand is incredible, but unfortunately it did nothing to benefit my 4C hair</li>
      <li>I need to use another rinse in order to leave my hair soft because this product does not do it (and i think it has to do because i straight my hair)</li>

      <li>Would highly recommend this for the way it makes the hair so soft.</li>
      <li>Now, this didn&#x27;t bother me because I think it smells divine, but if this is a turn-off to you, then you may want to steer clear from this product.</li>
      <li>It makes your hair is soft and shiny.</li>
      <li>The 1st time I was hesitant (my fine hair goes limp easily with conditioners), so I used a small amount and rinsed it out after about 5 minutes.</li>
      <li>&#x27;n Only hydrating mask, I didn&#x27;t expect much...</li>
      <li>I have very long, fine hair, don&#x27;t wash it daily, and the result was oily roots and dry, crunchy ends.</li>
      <li>Use too much and your hair may feel slightly oily and 2)the smell is a little bit strong and it lingers.</li>
      <li>, my hair is long but very fine , a little bit will go long way</li>
      <li>I kept it in overnight, put my hair up, and the next morning, my hair was shiny, soft, and tangle-free.</li>
      <li>With that said, I absolutely recommend this product to anyone with dry, chemically-treated hair looking for a deep conditioner.</li>
      <li>I have fine, straight, limp, color-treated (slightly dry) hair and products either leave my hair limp, or frizzy.  </li>

<li> /&gt;Thanks for the other reviews as I was wondering how frequently it could be used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> When I washed my hair, it didn&#x27;t feel as soft as it does with other conditioners.  </li>
<li> I also credit it with helping me to keep my relaxer viable for an extra week, so that saves on salon costs in the long run.</li>
<li> /&gt;It left my hair really dry and stringy.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
<li> I left this on for 10 minutes before rinsing out, then let air dry.  </li>
<li> ingrediant was simply too harsh for my natural hair.</li>
<li> My hair was soft and shiny, but too flat and limp.</li>
<li> so I&#x27;m hoping these results continue long term.</li>
<li> I do not know if you are supposed to leave in on this long</li>
<li> I really like this luxurious hair mask; my hair is vey thick and tends to be dry</li>
<li> I let it continue to air dry, and the result was incredibly soft, shiny, slightly wavy, voluminous hair!  </li>
<li> I noticed it looked a bit frizzy around my hairline as it began to dry, so I pumped 2 squirts of Aveda phomollient and ran it through my hair.  </li>
<li> I used this product after clarifying my hair and doing a protein treatment, and it felt like every single strand on my head was infused with moisture.</li>
<li> Often times my super thick hair like to frizz everywhere after being blow dried, but not when I use this!</li>
<li> After styling it was softer and shinier, with less frizz throughout the day and into the next day.  </li>
<li> product was left on my hair for 15 minutes (5 minutes longer than recommended...) and rinsed out, following a shampooing with my usual moisturizing product.  </li>
<li> My hair is very, very dry, and this mask made detangling a breeze both while it was on my hair</li>
<li> Also makes flat ironing my hair much less of a hassle.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> expected more shine and smooth result after sitting under the dryer for 30 minutes. But my hair smelled heavenly for days!!</li>
    <li> I purchased a trial size of this from Sally&#x27;s, thinking it would be like any other product I&#x27;ve tried and been disappointed with.  I was wrong.  This stuff is amazing!  I have fine, straight, limp, color-treated (slightly dry) hair and products either leave my hair limp, or frizzy.  I left this on for 10 minutes before rinsing out, then let air dry.  I noticed it looked a bit frizzy around my hairline as it began to dry, so I pumped 2 squirts of Aveda phomollient and ran it through my hair.  I let it continue to air dry, and the result was incredibly soft, shiny, slightly wavy, voluminous hair!  I am going to Sally&#x27;s tomorrow to buy a case of this!</li>
    <li> I am a relaxed African American who has recently decided to learn to care for my hair on my own and not run for a relaxer as soon as a hint of new growth comes in. This product is a miracle in a jar! I shampooed with the one n only moisturizing shampoo and followed up with the hydrating mask. I let it sit on my hair with a plastic cap for 10 min like the product instructed and my hair is like butter. My hair is very, very dry, and this mask made detangling a breeze both while it was on my hair and once I rinsed it out. The consistency is thick and it smelled DELICIOUS!!! I hope this product is never discontinued, if so I may have to buy up every jar in the country! You will not be disappointed.</li>
    <li> Smells good and makes my hair feel amazing</li>
    <li> Smells amazing, but it does not deep condition my hair has other conditioners have. I would recommend It&#x27;s a 10.</li>
    <li> This stuff works wonders on my straight, fine hair. Helps control the frizzies, too. Very good price for the amount of product.</li>
    <li> So, I just washed my hair with the same brand shampoo and then I put the hydrating mask on. It makes my hair feel so smooth. I actually have left it on for a day and wore my hair out. I do not know if you are supposed to leave in on this long but it is actually a great styling product. My curls are defined and look awesome.</li>
    <li> I picked up a packet of this product at Sally Beauty Supply locally, on a whim.  My hair is 40-something, color treated and about 40% gray.  I&#x27;m caucasian, with thick, coarse, wavy hair while growing up, but with hormonal fluctuations (possible thyroid issue) my hair&#x27;s texture has become even coarser and often fuzzy.  Very tough to keep it under control and looking healthy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product was left on my hair for 15 minutes (5 minutes longer than recommended...) and rinsed out, following a shampooing with my usual moisturizing product.  After styling it was softer and shinier, with less frizz throughout the day and into the next day.  Unfortunately the next day without it, brought back the same issues.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While not promoted as a daily treatment, I think if used daily it might just be a saving grace for my hair.  The product has a pleasant scent and rinses cleanly.  I didn&#x27;t get an oily build-up on my hair with one use, which is sometimes an issue for me using other Argan oil products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will be picking up more of this product and using it daily to see if it helps to balance things out for me.  I recommend it to anyone with unruly, course textured hair who wants to restore softness and shine to their hair.</li>
    <li> My wife has been using the hydrating mask for many years.  It keeps her hair very healthy  It does not allow for split ends or straw  like hair.  She highly recommends it.  Is easy to use  and works as advertised.</li>
    <li> I use this twice a week after using a purple toning shampoo mixed 50/50 with this lines shampoo. That combo keeps my very light platinum almost white blonde hair very happy and hydrated! I was turning around and reconditioning my ends every day with ion and pureology. This and the normal conditioner keep my hair hydrated until I have to shampoo it!</li>
    <li> i want to like the product but you need to use a little is too greasy for my hair , my hair is long but very fine , a little bit will go long way</li>
    <li> I use this once every two weeks and it perks my hair up.  It leaves my hair very soft with body.  I love it.</li>
    <li> I am African American and Korean and have a 3C curl pattern. I love this mask it rejuvenates my curls helping to reduce frizz and leaves my hair super hydrated.</li>
    <li> Love the product. Works great and does just what it is supost to do.  But it came to me cracked and some had leaked out in shipping.</li>
    <li> I really like this luxurious hair mask; my hair is vey thick and tends to be dry and this is what I use as an everyday conditioner.  It&#x27;s a nice alternative to the much more expensive MoroccanOIl intensive hair mask.  Worth the price.</li>
    <li> OMG this made my hair sooooo super soft. I have 3C / 4A hair texture that is extremly full of coils. Works great for detangling my texture. Love the smell of this stuff too.</li>
    <li> Smells great and works.  This was the best price too.  Will be buying again and again and again and again</li>
    <li> Nice product but I prefer the moisture mask. It&#x27;s much thicker and my hair feels silkier when I use it. The moisture mask comes in the tube.</li>
    <li> Got a free sample and have used it 4 times. The 1st time I was hesitant (my fine hair goes limp easily with conditioners), so I used a small amount and rinsed it out after about 5 minutes. I didn&#x27;t get great results. A few days later I tried it again but used too much. My hair was soft and shiny, but too flat and limp. The 3rd time I finally figured out the right amount for my hair and that leaving it on for 10 minutes is perfect. Even my husband said my hair looked good and smelled good! He rarely says either of those things so that got my attention. My slightly wavy hair is getting drier and coarser with age (40&#x27;s and now 50&#x27;s) so I&#x27;m hoping these results continue long term. Finding a product that makes my hair soft, shiny, smooth, and attractive to see, touch AND smell... well, I&#x27;m going to buy more!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for the other reviews as I was wondering how frequently it could be used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other products I&#x27;ve tried: keratin leave-in conditioner (worked well initially), leave-in conditioning cream (helped some), Black 15-in-1 (fast, easy, and helps when styling on days I don&#x27;t wash my hair, but leaves my hair a bit stiff). None of these made my hair smell nice even though the product itself smells fine, but my body tends to react uniquely to scented products.</li>
    <li> I got it at Sally&#x27;s Beauty Supply Store and I love it. I use it when I finish washing my hair. I use the product and leave it on for 10 minutes. It makes your hair is soft and shiny. It takes away the frizz. I recommend this product to everyone.</li>
    <li> I love this hair mask so much. I leave it on for about an hour to an hour and a half nearly every time I wash my hair and it leaves it so smooth, soft, shiny, and easy to work with. Often times my super thick hair like to frizz everywhere after being blow dried, but not when I use this! Also makes flat ironing my hair much less of a hassle. Love love love it. :)</li>
    <li> I got a 1 oz sample of the hydrating mask from Sally&#x27;s. I didn&#x27;t use it at all. I have very long, fine hair, don&#x27;t wash it daily, and the result was oily roots and dry, crunchy ends. My hair would tangle constantly. I tried olive oil treatments, but that just left my hair clumpy and lifeless. And leaving my usual conditioner in my hair softened it a little, but left it sticky and tangled. In desperation, I fumbled through my drawer and found the little tube of One &#x27;n Only hydrating mask, I didn&#x27;t expect much... But I was shocked at the difference. I wet my hair down, took about a quarter-shaped glob and ran it through to the ends. (It&#x27;s very thick and creamy) I kept it in overnight, put my hair up, and the next morning, my hair was shiny, soft, and tangle-free. I LOVE this stuff. My lil sample is running out, so I ran out and bought two 8 oz- one for my mom too. I will use it EVERY time I wash my hair from now on. I thought my hair was just fine, but it looked like straw compared to after using this product. Just a little bit made my hair shine like gold and it feels like silk. Definitely recommend it to anyone who is having problems with their hair, even if you don&#x27;t think you need it. My only issue with the product is that it has a really strong perfume smell, which stays on your hair. I don&#x27;t mind the smell that much, but some might be bothered by it.</li>
    <li> Smelled nice&lt;br /&gt;Expected to give me better result, especially since i use it for more than a month..&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t think I will bought it again</li>
    <li> smells so good makes hair very soft</li>
    <li> This product didn&#x27;t do what I expected it to do.  When I washed my hair, it didn&#x27;t feel as soft as it does with other conditioners.  My hair is relaxed and I needed something to protect and hydrate after taking braids out and this just didn&#x27;t do the trip.  I ended up having to use a homemade olive oil hot oil treatment to get the results I desired.</li>
    <li> My hair is dry and damage, i&#x27;ve dyed my hair way too many times and used lots uf hot tools... but this hydrating mask does make miracles happen. I applied it after shamppoing my hair, left it on for about ten minutes and when i rinsed it off my hair felt super soft! My hair does feel and look much healthier now.</li>
    <li> I really wanted to like this product, especially since the Argan Oil treatment from this brand is incredible, but unfortunately it did nothing to benefit my 4C hair type.&lt;br /&gt;It left my hair really dry and stringy.&lt;br /&gt;I couldnt detangle it very well either.&lt;br /&gt;The only good thing was the smell and the shine it added to my hair.&lt;br /&gt;Some ingrediant was simply too harsh for my natural hair.</li>
    <li> I like it because it leaves my hair soft, shiny and flows but the only bad thing is my hair falls out a lot after using this product I got it at Rickey&#x27;s for about 13$ recommend by a employee. She said it&#x27;s a 10 hair mask is better but it was too expensive but now I&#x27;ll try it because I don&#x27;t like how my hair falls out with this product.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product on a whim at my local beauty store and I am so, so glad that I did! It&#x27;s amazing! I have relaxed 4a hair that tends to be a little dry and is prone to breakage. I used this product after clarifying my hair and doing a protein treatment, and it felt like every single strand on my head was infused with moisture. In fact, my hair was so moisturized, I didn&#x27;t even bother with a leave-in (and I never do that!) because I felt it would be too moisture for my hair - I just sealed with botanic oil and wrapped my hair up. I loved it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two things to keep in mind with this conditioner: 1) a little goes a long way! Use too much and your hair may feel slightly oily and 2)the smell is a little bit strong and it lingers. Now, this didn&#x27;t bother me because I think it smells divine, but if this is a turn-off to you, then you may want to steer clear from this product. With that said, I absolutely recommend this product to anyone with dry, chemically-treated hair looking for a deep conditioner.</li>
    <li> I like the way it hidrates hair. I need to use another rinse in order to leave my hair soft because this product does not do it (and i think it has to do because i straight my hair) anyways i love the way my hair looks after a single use</li>
    <li> Amazing product. I actually leave it on. Hydrates my hair and it curls nicely with it on. cheap too compared to other products</li>
    <li> This product is so good you don&#x27;t have to use a lot of it.  Just a small amount does the job and detangles your hair.</li>
    <li> I have nappy hair, and the mask straightens those naps. I can actually comb through my hair when I use this. Would highly recommend this for the way it makes the hair so soft.</li>
    <li> I tried a 1 oz packet of this at Sally&#x27;s and was hooked.  This is the best conditioner since it leaves hair really soft.  I have relaxed hair and have replaced my other conditioners with this product.  I also credit it with helping me to keep my relaxer viable for an extra week, so that saves on salon costs in the long run.</li>
