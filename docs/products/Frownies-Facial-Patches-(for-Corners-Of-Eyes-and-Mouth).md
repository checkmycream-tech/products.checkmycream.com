      <li>As soon as I finish this I need to order more.</li>

      <li>Use them at sleep time and let the magic be done, you don&#x27;t even feel them.</li>

      <li>The patches work better than I thought.  </li>
      <li>This  not something I feel satisfied about.</li>
      <li>But I don&#x27;t think I will be purchasing any more of these.</li>
      <li>This was an ok product</li>
      <li>you must have a very good anti-aging treatment and regimen to achieve maxumum results and you must use daily.</li>
      <li>The patches do not have a nice smell, and they often stick out from my face.&lt;br /&gt;There is no disappointment on what the product promises, is perhaps just not something for me.</li>

      <li>just make sure your face is clean when applied.</li>
      <li>A must have to maintain muscle tone and to diminish fine lines.  </li>
      <li>Hints I can offer are: Don&#x27;t use the huge perforated sections of the square if you don&#x27;t have to.</li>
      <li>Each morning, it is smooth under the taped area and not scrunched and wrinkled.</li>
      <li>Cut sections to fit your face and use.</li>

      <li>Me, I&#x27;ll just get Botox &amp; go to bed - sticker free.</li>

      <li>Cheap paper, and they don&#x27;t work.</li>

      <li>It really does not work !!!</li>
      <li>+ hours per night, exercise, eat a clean diet, drink your weight in lbs..</li>
      <li>They are a much more natural and healthy approach.</li>
      <li>I clean with Cetaphil, apply vitamin E oil and then glue these on.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Seller did make things right with a little coaxing &amp; their shipment time was great!</li>
      <li>Upon removal  my skin was bright red and irritated.  </li>
      <li>Works great when I&#x27;m disciplined and consistent enough to use them!</li>
      <li>Someone with free time may have success.</li>
      <li>Feel somewhat like potato chips glued to your face (though I never tried that one), and I really need to give them a better chance than just the three nights I tried.  </li>
      <li>They really work I make sure no moisturizer where they are going, spritz them with water, rub the patch to spread.</li>
      <li>I have used them a full 30 days as was recommended to see results.</li>
      <li>not bad for the price</li>
      <li>These frownies are pretty easy to use and they provide minimum results.</li>
      <li>They pushed in more new wrinkles than they took out!  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> If you&#x27;re old enough to need this product, you&#x27;re probably old enough to remember that brown paper shipping tape you used to seal your packages for mailing. No amount of pretty packaging and personalized stickers can disguise the fact that these are basically glue backed paper tape. I&#x27;m going to do a test at home; one side of my face using frownies, the other side using packing tape, and I&#x27;ll see if I&#x27;m not right.</li>
    <li> I use these in place of botox. I had a bad reaction to botox and find this physical approach to training your muscles to relax (which keeps the wrinkles from forming) works great. I recommend them to all ages because if you use them earlier, you can avoid the natural progression of facial wrinkles. They are a much more natural and healthy approach.</li>
    <li> I have used them for a long time and they really work for me, people have a hard time to believe I am 73.</li>
    <li> In my opinion, clear invisible good sticking tape seems to work better on keeping the crease from going back to place.  When i had these on my face they seemed to feel like they weren&#x27;t quite tight enuff to keep the wrinkle out of place.  Tape works better and you&#x27;ll save yourself the money.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been a user of the forehead patch for years...so I thought I would try the eye ones. Nope. It left red marks for several hours around my eyes. But I have fairer skin...it may work just great on less sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> They are like a cardboard, uncomfortable to sleep with and it very hard to take them off from  face. They are terrible.</li>
    <li> After hearing about these for years, I found them to be difficult to use.  They feel like a brown paper bag on your skin.  I think they may be bad for your skin.</li>
    <li> As soon as I finish this I need to order more. They really do give the lines a break through the night. I wear them overnight.</li>
    <li> I stated in my review of the other Frownies patches that these patches do work rather miraculously.  But I have very sensitive skin and wearing these patches all night for a few nights caused my skin to break out only where the patches were.  If your skin is sensitive or breaks out easily, just be aware. Perhaps only wearing them for 3 hours and then taking them off to allow the skin to breathe overnight is a remedy for that.</li>
    <li> The patches work better than I thought.  They do not remove lines completely, however they do dramatically lessen the deepness of the lines.  I am happy with this product and will/would buy again.</li>
    <li> I still can not believe that these things actually work. I tried them as a bit of a lark, thought what could it hurt? Have to say I was pleased with the initial results and have continue to be impressed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Frownies are a kind of stiff craft-like paper with a natural gum adhesive on one side. They come in squares with perforated sections to tear off and use on the desired areas of the face. To apply the Frownies you simply massage the area of application for about 15 seconds, wet the backside of the Frownie patch with either toner mist or plain old water, gently lift the skin adjacent to the application area, to smooth the area, and apply the Frownie patch. Ideally the patch should be left on overnight, but if this is not possible you can still get good results with 2-3 hours of use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The idea behind these things is that you retrain the facial muscles by temporarily freezing the area. (Much like Botox.) I also think that when you remove the patch, the area is slightly irritated and you get some temporary swelling, thus you see less wrinkling for a short period of time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using these things for about a month now and can absolutely say that they have helped. Especially in the () area beside the mouth and nose. Hints I can offer are: Don&#x27;t use the huge perforated sections of the square if you don&#x27;t have to. Cut sections to fit your face and use. When applying to the () area, leave a bit of room to the side of the nose - they become extremely irritating when they harden up if the patch is brushing against the curved side of the nose. Remove these things in the shower if you can - or at the very least thoroughly wet them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One other issue of note - some say that surgical tape is just as effective for use in this manner and is a good deal less expensive. Nexcare flexible clear tape has been reported to yield pretty much the same results. I have not tried the tape being happy with this product, but those looking for an even more affordable solution, might want to check it out.ght want to check it out.</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B00027DMSI Frownies Forehead &amp; Between Eyes, 144 Patches]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These patches seem to help  reduce the expression of frown lines but will not make them go away in an 80-year-old face.  It might help prevent frown lines if you start using them early on, like when you are forty.</li>
    <li> These have been working very well for me. The main reason for wanting to try them was that I sleep on my side and would wake up every day with my eye all scrunched and wrinkled. I was beginning to get pretty substantial crows feet lines, and was sure the side sleeping made it worse. But I&#x27;ve been using these for at least a year every night and think it&#x27;s really made a difference. Each morning, it is smooth under the taped area and not scrunched and wrinkled.</li>
    <li> This product works exactly as it is designed to. And it&#x27;s stopping me from making faces in the middle of the night that lead to more wrinkles! Thank you!!</li>
    <li> They will not stay on. Tried everything to get them to stick, without success. Very&lt;br /&gt;Disappointed. But, I bought a &amp;#34;Just the Pillow&amp;#34; and it&#x27;s terrific, keeps my skin from mooshing into wrinkles while I sleep, have already seen improvement!</li>
    <li> Couldn&#x27;t get them to stick</li>
    <li> These are very uncomfortable to wear.  They feel like packing tape on my skin.  Hardens and is uncomfortable.</li>
    <li> I use these every night and can see a difference.  I sleep on my side and was seeing terrible sleep limes under my eyes.  this  product stops that.</li>
    <li> These frownies are pretty easy to use and they provide minimum results. The issue I had is sometimes they did not stay on, some of the patches did not stick properly. Other than that, they&#x27;re just ok.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for nearly ten years. I always get compliments about how young I look. I think these are part of why I look young. It helps reduce wrinkles when used regularly.</li>
    <li> When I wake up in the morning the lines around my mouth are almost gone, but very soon they reappear.. I have been using them for a month now, so maybe I have to &#x27;&#x27;try&#x27;&#x27; a bit longer..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do have to say that the frownies for wrinkles between the eyebrows, the number &#x27;&#x27;11&#x27;&#x27; lines do work wonders, they are gone and stay away when I use them!</li>
    <li> These are the best thing ever  - I use these for my forehead (tear them in half) and I am devoted to Frownies.  When I forget to use them for more than a few days, I notice that the crease between my eyes gets noticeably worse.</li>
    <li> This is a great product that does work if you use the Frownies consistently. Frownies relaxed the muscles in these areas and soften the lines.</li>
    <li> I discovered this product about a year ago by word of mouth. A few other ladies I know (who, by the way, do not look their age as a result) passed the secret on to me.  I have been using Frownies for about a year now with outstanding results.  I used to have noticable frown lines on my forehead and some wrinkles around my eyes.  Since using this product, these lines have all but gone away, and when they do start to resurface, I make sure I use my Frownies that night and they smooth back out.  I noticed results after the first useage, but the more I used them, the longer the results would last.  Now I get looks of shock every time I tell someone my age, and I have Frownies to thank for it!  I highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> No lotion was used, they did not stay on, not worth the money paid.I Sent it back for a refund.</li>
    <li> Despite excitedly believing in the concept of Frownies, they caused me to break out with zits after a few days &amp; after a couple weeks of no results at all I stopped using them.  Zits are much more unattractive than smile lines.  I had no trouble getting them to stick on at night or come off in the morning.  My face is usually fairly relaxed but I could feel how the Frownies stopped me from moving my face even more.  People with highly developed facial expression wrinkles will probably notice a bigger change &amp; I think they are worth trying if you can find at a local drug store where they are pretty cheap.</li>
    <li> Painful, and stupid. Caused more wrinkles and got stuck to my face! Rip off, do not bother with this EVER.</li>
    <li> Cheap paper, and they don&#x27;t work. I know they have been around forever, but I guess 50-somethings have been gullible for a long time, too. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> Not nice to use, difficult to get to adhere to skin and does not do what product is claiming to do. Wouldn&#x27;t purchase again.</li>
    <li> in the beginning i personally felt like it worked and seen a little deference but it became really uncomfortable, so i had eventually stopped using it so i can&#x27;t really say how it was over all... so 3 star.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m half embarrassed that I even bought this product, but pushing sixty aren&#x27;t we all looking for a miracle wrinkle remover?  Well, this isn&#x27;t it.  I think I could do the same thing with duct tape at night as this product does.</li>
    <li> Love to know who writes all these raving reviews about products that help remove wrinkles--not one has worked and neither with this one unless you are under 30 with few wrinkles--Got wrinkles go to a cosmetic surgeon and get them removed correctly &amp; safely--not putting glue on your face!</li>
    <li> Bought this for my mum she loves it. She uses it in conjunction with Wenmedics Wrinkles fade and the result is AMAZING</li>
    <li> I must admit I am not super happy with this product. Perhaps is me, not being able to use it properly. This  not something I feel satisfied about. The patches do not have a nice smell, and they often stick out from my face.&lt;br /&gt;There is no disappointment on what the product promises, is perhaps just not something for me.</li>
    <li> I was excited to try these and ordered them very recently.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried them once (for crows feet) - they were very fiddly to separate (like cardboard paper with perferations on them) - they come in a concertina folded style all in one pack, so to speak.  I didn&#x27;t expect that - I thought they would come already in size, separate and ready to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It looks and feels like cardboard, it was very uncomfortable and I didn&#x27;t like it one bit - I took them off more or less straightaway - so I can&#x27;t honestly say if they work or not - but my eyes were very sore and it felt like sandpaper residue on my skin afterwards which was difficult to remove.  My eyes were sore for a day or so.  Note: I don&#x27;t have super sensitive skin so I was surprised at this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, looks like they work for a lot of people - however, I personally don&#x27;t like beauty products that are hard work and uncomfortable so for me, it was a no no.</li>
    <li> They work ok but the ones for the &amp;#34;smile&amp;#34; wrinkles started leaving a mark on my cheeks no matter how I placed them, so I just stopped using them.</li>
    <li> This was not what I thought it was.&lt;br /&gt;After receiving it, and reading the labels, and directions, I realized that all it does is stretch the skin.</li>
    <li> I stuck with them every night for a while. These days, I remember to put them on 3-5 times a week. They really do make a difference.</li>
    <li> Pretty good product, wished it lasted longer! Does help with some wrinkles temporarily:-) wish they had a product sort of like a headband too help keep skin taut while using or otherwise?! I would buy it.</li>
    <li> This was an ok product</li>
    <li> I followed the directions exactly and they did nothing. Please do not waste your time or money on this product. It does not work.  They are stickers you wet and stick on your face over night.</li>
    <li> I am a loyal fan of the frownies.  They have naturally eased the wrinkles I have in the eye and mouth area.  I am a side sleeper and typically, I wake up with creases.  The frownies prevent this from happening.  I can&#x27;t sleep without them now.</li>
    <li> Not working.  Not a good product.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t return them, it was too much trouble. They may work for others but didn&#x27;t for me. that&#x27;s all.</li>
    <li> If you can sleep with stickers on your face, well then you go right ahead. It will wrinkle free you for a few hours until you start moving. Me, I&#x27;ll just get Botox &amp; go to bed - sticker free. Thank you and good night.</li>
    <li> They are like licking stamps and sticking them to your face. They are sharp and very uncomfortable. I can&#x27;t get my money back because I used 1 square. I will be happy to mail you mine instead of wasting your money. Once it is stuck to your face, it creates a wrinkle on both sides where your have stuck the patch. I don&#x27;t like to leave negative feedback but this was not good. You could use scotch tape as well.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t put these around your eyes.  Upon removal  my skin was bright red and irritated.  Took hours for the redness to start subsiding.  I was horrified.</li>
    <li> thank you very much Frownies really good! No wrinkles for  in forehead! It is very to use and it is worth every penny no doubt ! It&#x27;s much more better than use Botox ! I am really happy!</li>
    <li> Love &#x27;em.  Easy to use and they work.</li>
    <li> hard to work with, not easy to apply</li>
    <li> It is a great alternative, highly recomend it!! Use them at sleep time and let the magic be done, you don&#x27;t even feel them.</li>
    <li> I used these patches for years, it will not improve the skin structure or remove wrinkles for a prolong period of time, you have to use it daily, but if you are not ready for injections yet the using of these patches will help to look a little bit better for the current day only.</li>
    <li> Work wonders with no surgery. Easy to use.</li>
    <li> I had a healthy skepticism upon purchasing these but was hoping for the best.  I am a side sleeper and noticed how I&#x27;m getting crows feet and forehead wrinkles based on the way I sleep.The first night I tried them-they were not uncomfortable-and in the morning-no wrinkles!  I encourage anyone to try these! Not only are they cheaper and less painful than Botox or fillers-but use the rose petal spray to wet them and enjoy some aromatherapy side benefits too!</li>
    <li> The patches have to be moistened to stick.</li>
    <li> I really like this product because it diminishes the appearance of wrinkles, especially if it is used every night, and it has never harmed my sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> If used correct as directed they really work I use with the derma roll..... and they work great I use the 1.0 and the 1.5</li>
    <li> It made me break out after a few days, so I quit using them.  Plus the edges are harsh.  I noticed a small difference, but didn&#x27;t use them long enough to get real results.</li>
    <li> The shapes can be a little confusing, but they work the same as the ones for between your eyes, so who cares. All the same, all o.k.</li>
    <li> They reallly work!  I&#x27;m a side sleeper and have wrinkles on the left side of my eye and face.  Really reduced the wrinkles!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m in my early 40&#x27;s and have started to get laugh lines (not so funny), and I tried these. They actually feel really hard after applied to y face, and don&#x27;t hold as well as they should. In the morning, it kind of hurts to pull them off. I went back to my mom&#x27;s method of using the clear bandaid tape.</li>
    <li> Product received as described and on time.</li>
    <li> They really work! I dont have any corner of eye wrinkles but I did have some fierce marionette lines as well as the forehead 11&#x27;s. I use the section that would go on the corner of the eyes, between the eyebrows. Very effective and comfortable to sleep in. Does the job...A+.</li>
    <li> Once I moisturizer they don&#x27;t stick. If you are of the age where you use these, you are also of the age when moisturizing and especially your eye realm are essential.</li>
    <li> I spent a year frowning I guess. I was 52 and my husband spent 7 months on life support after open heart surgery. He died. I had to move everything all by myself, horses, house, pets to another state and start completely over. Then life got much better! I was/am happy, but geeze, my face! I always looked like I was frowning even when I was smiling. I realized I had these deep furrows between my eyes. I&#x27;ve been using these every night for a month and those line are almost all gone! When I get up and remove the patch they are gone. By the end of the day, they are slightly there. I do now notice that I do frown un intentionally and I&#x27;m correcting that too to stop the lines from forming. They really work I make sure no moisturizer where they are going, spritz them with water, rub the patch to spread. Then I pull the lines away with my fingers and stick the patch on holding it in place until it&#x27;s dry. Every night. In the morning I use a moist towlette to gently remove it. I love them. I&#x27;m turning 54 this week and I look much better now. I am thinking something like this for the whole face would be neat, to sleep with everything smoothed out all night. I will check on that. I&#x27;m getting the mouth patches too.</li>
    <li> I disn&#x27;t like the product.</li>
    <li> This is a horrible product and does not do as it is stated rather it is horrifically uncomfortable and a waste of money and sleep.</li>
    <li> What a waste of money for small - very small box box sealing tape. Tried it twice so far and it&#x27;s a really bad idea.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a good product.  I just never could find time to use them. Someone with free time may have success.</li>
    <li> Slight improvement but not obvious</li>
    <li> I bought these as well as the frownies for the forehead and between eyes. But I started using the frownies for the corners of the eyes on my forehead instead, as I don&#x27;t have much lines by my eyes. The lines around my mouth are a little deeper, so I see I&#x27;ll have to use these for longer, but so far I&#x27;m pleased. I do wish that they were softer but I don&#x27;t mind the rigidity too much.</li>
    <li> A noticeable effect on wrinkles after a night of wearing this, but sometimes it is difficult to keep it on, especially if you yawn you can feel it coming out of place.</li>
    <li> Use them everyday...recommend by dermatologist&#x27;s office</li>
    <li> I have never actually reviewed a product before so here goes.  I have been using this product for two weeks now, and my one forehead line is almost gone, and my 11s were gone immediately.  I am 29 but I spent 5 years in and out of the hospital fighting cancer and organ failure.  The air is really dry in there plus I smoked up until 2 years ago, but this product makes me look my age.  I look forward every day to seeing the major line I have on my forehead slowly disappear.  I have done the retin a for over a year, and I even mix my own creams which has really helped, but I had gone pretty much as far as I could go with topical creams.  I don&#x27;t want botox at such a young age, due to the inevitable spock brow and bunny line look it brings.  These things are amazing to me.</li>
    <li> This was a total waste of my money and my opinion is don&#x27;t waste yours cause you&#x27;ll regret it. Let nature take it&#x27;s course.</li>
    <li> I love, love, love this product!  I had Botox in the past and I liked the effects but can&#x27;t afford to keep it up.  I must say these do the trick!  I only wish they made Frownies for the whole face.  I have even put them on that sagging skin under the chin and it has really helped.  If you are thinking of trying these you but aren&#x27;t sure-go ahead.  Just keep in mind you have to use them daily (nightly).  When you stop for a few days you can see the difference.</li>
    <li> A purchase for my mom. It&#x27;s her beauty secret. It does train your muscles in your face to relax.</li>
    <li> They were all stuck together, like they had already been wet. I haven&#x27;t been able to use them. What a total waste of money!</li>
    <li> these help&lt;br /&gt; fast shipping</li>
    <li> Feel somewhat like potato chips glued to your face (though I never tried that one), and I really need to give them a better chance than just the three nights I tried.  Of course no miracles occurred as yet and that wasn&#x27;t expected.  I&#x27;ll be giving them another try when I feel like cutting and pasting again.  Two or three weeks, or months for results??  I don&#x27;t know about that one…….  RESF</li>
    <li> Wrinkles are much better in the morning, but they do come back in the late afternoon.  Hoping with time it will get better and better and last longer.</li>
    <li> Works great when I&#x27;m disciplined and consistent enough to use them!</li>
    <li> They seem to work well if you use them regularly but they do take a little getting used to as the material is hard a bit like cardboard. I can&#x27;t see why a softer material couldn&#x27;t be used? Anyway give them a go if you&#x27;ve got a but of patience.&lt;br /&gt;Two months later and I&#x27;m still using them regularly, definitely worth sticking with, pardon the pun. You do get used to the stuff texture after a few uses and they definitely work</li>
    <li> I bought the eye gels which I loved , so I decided to invest in these. Big mistake they are uncomfortable like crazy, made my skin red and irritated not to mention they made my nasal labial folds worse. Don&#x27;t buy this product. Posting under my husband&#x27;s account for reference I am a woman 28 years old.</li>
    <li> These are little miracle workers.</li>
    <li> I have been using Frownies for years, usually purchased via mail order companies, but now with the ease and quickness of Amazon you can get them within a week.  I try to apply these between my eyes almost every night, and even if I miss a night my frown lines are much improved. I know this product is the eyes/mouth one, but I find this one better for my forehead creases than the regular forehead Frownies (however I often keep both in my medicine cabinet).  If you don&#x27;t want Botox or can&#x27;t afford it, this is a reliable alternative that really makes a difference.  Don&#x27;t pay attention to the naysayers who tell you it is uncomfortable, you hardly feel it on your face because they use a super-light all natural vegetable adhesive that leaves no morning residue.  One thing:  don&#x27;t over-water the shiny adhesive side before applying, and do keep a firm hand over the Frownie for about a minute or so to keep it adhering, otherwise they occasionally peel off in the night.</li>
    <li> don&#x27;t know that these actually work… they&#x27;re just &amp;#34;okay&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> my mother wanted these so I ordered them for her. She said they were ok but after you apply them they dry hard like card board and she doesnt see much of a diff. in the wrinkles she was using them for.</li>
    <li> I have used these for years.  So has Raquel Welsh, who I saw on a daytime TV show. She said that is her secret, I am a believer.  I have been using them also and I am 61, people can&#x27;t believe it when they see my real age.  No plastic surgery or botox for me......now if they would just come out with a product for the inevitable turkey neck or jowls I will eventually get would be awesome!</li>
    <li> These feel awful on my face to sleep with. I&#x27;d rather have my smile wrinkles.</li>
    <li> It really does not work !!!&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t apply on my face, is only paper, do you understand me ???</li>
    <li> Wanted to  try these for years.  Very disappointed.  They pushed in more new wrinkles than they took out!  I am 67 with very nice skin for my age.  I read instruction &amp; followed them diligently.  Took forever since I used them in several areas.  All they did was push in more wrinkles &amp; who pays for that. lol  Might work on younger skin for \\&quot;11&#x27;s\\&quot; for temporary improvement for a big event?  I tried them just in that area &amp; there was just not enough improvement to warrant the time &amp; trouble for me.  I&#x27;ll use Roc serum for that--better &amp; easier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seller did make things right with a little coaxing &amp; their shipment time was great!</li>
    <li> they work. They are great until you forget they are on and answer the door wearing one.. Otherwise, if you wear them, you will see a difference,  downfall is you need to wear them often, to see a real difference I need to wear them overnight.</li>
    <li> These little patches are a cheap alternative, to Botox.  I have noticed a difference in the appearance of the creases on my face.</li>
    <li> not bad for the price</li>
    <li> Difficult to take off</li>
    <li> Extremely uncomfortable and if I made it through the night with it on my face, I&#x27;d have a wrinkle where the tape ended.</li>
    <li> This is like putting a really bad sticky tape on your skin, I didn&#x27;t see results and they really hurt when you take them off</li>
    <li> Unfortunately I did not care for them... they will not stay put.  I am returning.</li>
    <li> Very uncomfortable and itchy... Didn&#x27;t make it thru one night!. Hard like cardboard stuck to your face - save money and use an envelope flap instead!!</li>
    <li> Sadly I have to report that I am not using my frownies....I vought them for some deep creases that had developed around my mouth.  But they are uncomfortable to wear and don&#x27;t stick as well as I hoped when used with face cream.</li>
    <li> Very uncomfortable to wear overnight and that is the recommended time to wear them. Obviously if this product keeps you awake you will look awful in the morning</li>
    <li> Use these consistently--get results!</li>
    <li> I noticed a furrow forming between my eyebrows so I ordered these. The first day I put one right between my eyebrows and did housework in it, then slept with it on. In the morning the furrow was gone. This is day 2, I didn&#x27;t use it last night and the furrow is still gone. Yay!</li>
    <li> I am very careful with my skin and avoid sun bathing because of getting wrinkles. However I was getting creases from sleeping on my side. I use Frownies to avoid this. They are a bit fiddly to apply, but they work for me!</li>
    <li> Totally useless. Don&#x27;t work at all.</li>
    <li> Loved them! I notice when I DON&#x27;T use them though. I scrunch up my face because I am very expressive but noticed a difference in my fine lines (crow&#x27;s feet!)</li>
    <li> If anyone is the ultimate sceptic, it is I....&lt;br /&gt;Nonetheless, I bought these patches since I was getting &amp;#34;that look&amp;#34; .  I am not a candidate for surgery yet I wanted some of those wrinkles to disappear....well...I bought these patches, used them at night, and I actually did feel that they helped firm my skin a bit.  Even 10% is worth it....I thought.  I used them for a total of 8 weeks....and then went to a lotion.  It is tedious to put these patches on every night....but not that bad.&lt;br /&gt;I would say gives these a chance before you have someone cut your face up.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Frownies for over a year now for a deep crevice that was starting vertically on my forehead from frowning.  When used EVERY NIGHT regularly it works GREAT.  It has significantly reduced this deep crevice to where it&#x27;s barely noticeable!  If I stop using them it comes back, but if you use them on a regular basis they really do work!!</li>
    <li> Chemical peel worked best.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t expect miracles but it does work until you start to squint or focus again heavily.  I use these at night and upon waking, the wrinkles are definitely diminished.  It helps for those important morning meetings!  I bet Botox to the area and then the nightly use of this afterward would do the trick on a more permanent level.  Admittedly, I do not use the recommended products with these as my face is very sensitive to products, even if they are all natural.  I clean with Cetaphil, apply vitamin E oil and then glue these on.</li>
    <li> I have heard for years about how celebrities and beauty mavens rave about these Frownies patches.  I purchased a set and find them to be bulky and uncomfortable.  I don&#x27;t see how anyone could leave them on for hours.  I think a piece of scotch tape would be about as effective.</li>
    <li> The only down side to this is that it doesn&#x27;t make for much spur of the moment romance!  But it really does work.</li>
    <li> Unfortunately had too hard of a time trying to get them to stay on.  Really disappointed!</li>
    <li> Does nothing. Don&#x27;t waste your money....buy a good cream or get Botox! I moly gave one star because I had to....I wanted to give zero.</li>
    <li> These work great.  Of course the fix is only temporary (darn) but for looking better for hours these are the best.  I haven&#x27;t had them long enough to say what they will do over time.</li>
    <li> Simply put, a big waste of money. These are impossible to use and therefore, they do nothing to enhance wrinkles or anything else.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using these for years and they really work. I started to see an improvement after the first use.</li>
    <li> No it did not meet my expectations.......not comfortable and after two weeks saw little diffrence</li>
    <li> Maybe I started too late :o(  but I wore these every night and never saw even the smallest bit of improvement. Waste of money.</li>
    <li> They Worked very well and it made my wrinkles less visible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The patch for the dimples is not long enough.</li>
    <li> I tried these because I have the start of a wrinkle around the corner of my mouth, I have used them for several months and have not noticed any improvement, the wrinkle is not getting in worse though, that may be something due to the patches.  But I don&#x27;t think I will be purchasing any more of these.</li>
    <li> Product is just ok.  Not going to change the beauty world with this one.  Hard to get off once product dries on face so they you are forced to yank and tug the skin.  Kind of defeats the purpose.</li>
    <li> I discovered these years ago, when I was trying to invent something similar. I gave up when I realize they perfected it. Other brands use more expensive materials, but the glue and paper of Frownies is so stiff, it does the job perfectly. There is nothing to improve on They nailed it 100 years ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like anything else you can buy for your skin that&#x27;s under $20 - this is not plastic surgery. If you want it to work, you have to be consistent. When I stop using it, my wrinkles come back. When I use it consistently, my skin is as smooth as a 17 year olds. I am an actress and don&#x27;t want to look plastic or frozen, so this is a perfect solution for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only downside is getting into bed the night before a big audition and letting your boyfriend see you with paper glued to your forehead. Luckily, he loves me and we joke about it.</li>
    <li> I have used Frownies for a number of years.  They are great in between botox injections and probably would work in lu of botox.</li>
    <li> what a waste of money. Nearly pulled my skin off! I have no idea why anyone thinks these are helpful for creases!</li>
    <li> Mouth ones - keeps my mouth shut while sleeping.</li>
    <li> I did not like this product.  While you sleep they get really hard and not very comfortable.  I used them for a while and did not see any difference.  They start to peel off around the corners and before the night was over i was having to take them off.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for years and have nothing but good to say about it. It keeps the lines and some sagging at bay and that makes me happy. Great product!</li>
    <li> I had read some favorable comments about Frownies years ago and thought I&#x27;d give them a try.  Wearing Frownies may produce all the desired results but it&#x27;s not for me.  If you aren&#x27;t bothered by several stiff pieces of heavy paper on your face every night or concerned about your husband seeing you, give it a shot.  Less invasive, can&#x27;t hurt.</li>
    <li> I love these!  I have badly shrouded eyes and really need a lot of help in that area.  These are easy to use and I can customize them with scissors where necessary.  I apply them at night and the &#x27;lift&#x27; lasts for a long time into the next day.  Only criticism I have is that they are a little hard to remove as you really have to soak them to get them off so don&#x27;t apply them where they stick to your eyebrows or hair.  I only wish they could come with something like this that could be covered with some make up!</li>
    <li> High end product, I feel the skin become soft after using, like face returned to 18 years old, is very good</li>
    <li> I thought the product will attach to my face like a bandage. This is not the case!  It&#x27;s like putting a piece of a cardboard on my face. It stiffs and does not conture to the face. I feel unconfortable to have these pactches on my faces even at night to go to sleep. I tottally wasting the money on this product. I already open the product and use a few pieces. Therefore, I cannot return it. NOT RECOMMEND!</li>
    <li> People rave about this, but I&#x27;m not a very sensitive person and after a few months still haven&#x27;t seen any result yet. But I hope one day I&#x27;ll see the difference</li>
    <li> The first couple of days that I used these I thought that I&#x27;d stumbled upon the miracle cure for my smile/forehead lines.  Alas, after about a week I noticed that when I removed the frownies in the morning my lines were diminished, but within hours they were back.  I never really experienced the muscles in those areas losing strength.  I have used them a full 30 days as was recommended to see results.</li>
    <li> I saw this advertised on one of the morning news shows and thought why not try it.  To my surprise it really does work just make sure your face is clean when applied.</li>
    <li> excellent, fast deleviry</li>
    <li> Waste of money! Total crap, they don&#x27;t even stay on.</li>
    <li> I bought this one for my wrinkles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I fell asleep, I mop and mow. So I attatched it to my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Better than before. It is good to protect face wrnkles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But, smell is not good. Any way I recommend it.</li>
    <li> very uncomfortable to use</li>
    <li> These are very uncomfortable to wear - they are basically heavy paper with glue on them.  It&#x27;s impossible to sleep with them on and there is no way you&#x27;d want anyone to see you wearing them.  I will say that they did soften the lines but removal of the &#x27;frownie&#x27; resulted in red marks left on the skin.  I do not recomend these!</li>
    <li> they help if you remember to use them</li>
    <li> A must have to maintain muscle tone and to diminish fine lines.  must use nightly between the eyebrows, corners of the mouth, and corner of the eyes.  you must have a very good anti-aging treatment and regimen to achieve maxumum results and you must use daily.</li>
    <li> The stickers are too big so I had to cut them to fit my face properly.  Also, the glue is messy, and because the stickers are big and hard, they don&#x27;t adhere well/evenly on your face.  Too much of a hassle, so I stopped using them.</li>
    <li> If your skin is in really good shape already, and you take pains to sleep 8+ hours per night, exercise, eat a clean diet, drink your weight in lbs.. in oz, divided by 2, of filtered water daily, drink minimal (1-2 0z) quantities of wine with  a meal, once a week, eat pure, organic food, then this product as well as its sibling, Frownies for the forehead and between the eyes, will help you look MUCH younger. I have assiduously guarded against the son, and pass for 20 years younger. I will use it faithfully for all time. Botulinum toxin? No thank you.</li>
    <li> I really wanted this product to work, unfortunately, I&#x27;ve notice absolutely NO change with this product. The good thing is, they were inexpensive.</li>
    <li> Buy a manila envelope and cut into triangles, you will have the same exact product.</li>
    <li> I have used frownies for years.  I wish they made them clear, but they don&#x27;t and I wear them to bed so not a deal breaker.  They stay put and with consistent use (I use mine around my mouth about 2 times a week and around my eyes and forehead almost daily - every once in awhile I don&#x27;t wear them).  I notice within days if I haven&#x27;t used them.  Easy and cost effective.</li>
</ol>
