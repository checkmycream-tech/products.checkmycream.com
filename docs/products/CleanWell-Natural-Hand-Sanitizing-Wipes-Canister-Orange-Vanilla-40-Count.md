<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I do not know what Orange Vanilla was supposed to smell like when I purchased this, but I was not expecting awful.  The reviews from 2011 must have had a different formula.</li>
    <li> It has a scent that takes a little getting used to and they are very very moist when first opened. I&#x27;m used to EO products. This is very different. Not necessarily worse or better. Just different.</li>
    <li> I think this is a good value but I haven&#x27;t gone through these very quickly because of the scent so probably won&#x27;t be buying again.</li>
    <li> I actually use these to wipe my kitchen counters instead of chlorox wipes.</li>
    <li> Very pleased with the quality of this product.  Enjoy having a healthier option to clean and disinfect surfaces.  Especially like the fact that they are alcohol free and gentle on the skin.</li>
    <li> Those wipes are gentle and non toxic and we use them on hands as well as on toys. We love the smell (it is strong it&#x27;s true, but we love everything that smells \\&quot;natural\\&quot; vs chemical) and with the subscribe and save option, it&#x27;s a steal !</li>
    <li> Like these- I was worried about the smell based on other reviews but I didn&#x27;t find it too strong/unpleasant (and I hate perfumey stuff).  More importantly, my kids (who didn&#x27;t like my homemade alcohol and essential oil wipes) don&#x27;t haveNy problem with these.  I would recommend &amp; am re-ordering them!</li>
    <li> Use these or Honest Co diaper wipes to clean my toddler&#x27;s hands when we are out and without access to a sink and soap. Good for cold season!</li>
    <li> I bought these to take to work since I deal with the public and handle their money.  It has a wonderful scent, much like an orange creamsicle!  It&#x27;s also mild on my hands, a must during these dry winter month.  I&#x27;m glad I found this product on Amazon; I never would have otherwise.  All commercial products use harsh alcohol and other ingredients to make them sanitizing, but they&#x27;re all too drying on my skin.  I like this so much I also bought their hand pump soap as well!</li>
    <li> Work well and sanitize. They smell like a chemical not Orange and Vanilla.</li>
    <li> Great product and great price.  Does have a strong odor but I really like it.  I have VERY sensitive sinuses and the smell doesn&#x27;t bother them at all so I would say the product is organic.  Thanks amazon, another great product.</li>
    <li> I ordered these to keep around the office, since we don&#x27;t have a sink in our area. They work great, but the smell: mothballs and creamsicle. Its not Awful, but its not great either. When I need more, I will get the EOS ones that smell like lavender instead.</li>
    <li> Very nice sent. Nice to know they are safe for kids. We love them and the hand spray too.</li>
    <li> Over-powering smell. Much too strong. May do the job but hate the smell.</li>
    <li> Great item, not overly scented like other  wipes.  I use them at school, they work just fine.</li>
    <li> I liked the idea that these are all natural but they have a strong herb like smell the kids didn&#x27;t like.</li>
    <li> This is just what it says and does a great job of hand cleaning and disinfecting without drying out your skin.  I would give it a 5 star but the smell is sort of like that orange handscrub that mechanics use.  My son said so too... but still is a great product and will buy again.  (Alcohol based is too drying and I am sensitive to alcohol on skin... so this is best product!)</li>
    <li> As other reviewers say, the wipes are soapy and small. However, if you&#x27;ve used them you know they do not dry out your hands. For an all natural sanitizing wipe, these cannot be beat. We&#x27;ve all be so sick here I&#x27;ve taken to using these to sanitize the bathrooms, door handles and countertops. We&#x27;ve (including 3 kids all under 4) been using these wipes for a week all the time (due to being sick) and have had no issues with dryness. Our hands seemed dryer just using plain old soap, so something in there is conditionings (oats and aloe I believe).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think these are a great alternative to chlorox wipes. I wish they sold it in a spray solution so I could really harness the cleaning power!</li>
    <li> These smell awesome and do a great job.</li>
    <li> This company is awesome, hands down. Price, great. Smell, great. I wish they sold these in the bigger canisters like they do the Botanical scent.  They are the only natural product that I have found works wonders on my black granite kitchen counters without leaving streaks or water spots. I use these and then use a conservative mist of my vinegar + water cleaning solution to get any excess soap from the wipe up. I also use them on all my stainless steel with no residue that other stainless cleaners, even natural cleaners, leave behind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ALSO, and this is a big also, they get out all marks like magic from my light gray microfiber sofa and light carpets. Anyone who has a cat knows how they just like to hairball (yes, I&#x27;m using that as a verb) all over, whenever, with no warning, and also sometimes throw up. These wipes are the PERFECT solution to getting it all up with no stains.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PLEASE STOP USING the big, not natural brands (like Lysol) that use harmful ingredients. They are not worth it. They also smell chemically/not pleasant. Any claims that only those toxic brands are proven to kill 99.9% of germs is a lie, there is way too much science out there proving that natural essential oils kill the same amount of germs without the toxicity. AND they smell hella better!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also use the tiny antibacterial sprays they make. Love &#x27;em.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m germaphobic but dislike strong chemicals so this product suits me fine.  The smell took some getting use to but now I like it.</li>
    <li> They get the job done just have to squeeze out extra liquid Each wipe</li>
    <li> I was really happy when I discovered the CleanWell line of Sanitizing products. My other favorites are the pocket sanitizer with the same Orange Vanilla scent as these wipes have, and the 8 ounce Foaming Hand Sanitizer which seems to have little or no scent. The CleanWell products use no alcohol and none of the sanitizing agents that are likely to cause allergic reactions in some people. \\&quot;CleanWell is made with a patented formulation of thyme oil. CleanWell is free of triclosan, benzalkonium chloride,and alcohol. &#x27;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The use of other alcohol based sanitizers and the use of regular soap to clean my hands was making my hands very dry and rough. I was actively searching for a product that would be kind to my hands, but I really didn&#x27;t expect to find anything this good. Thanks to CleanWell my hands are no longer rough and red. Thank you CleanWell and thank you Amazon for expanding your availability of these fine products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;JP</li>
    <li> I ordered these based on all the good reviews, but sadly, I have to disagree.  While they are natural and gentle, I just couldn&#x27;t get past the smell. The orange vanilla scent is there, but masked heavily by a soapy smell.  And it&#x27;s incredibly strong.  Wanting to get the odor off of my hands after using only one wipe, I washed them with a lavander scented soap.  Even after washing, my hands still smelled of that orange vanilla soapy smell! Also, when using these wipes, they don&#x27;t really wipe clean, but produce a soapy slime that I needed to dry off with a dry towel.  I ordered these to be portable in the car, so between the soapiness and the awful smell, it wasn&#x27;t very condusive to my needs.  There&#x27;s better stuff out there.</li>
    <li> Does not smell orange, it smells herbal.</li>
    <li> I love the concept of these.  The only problem, however, is the soapy residue that gets all over little one&#x27;s hands.  Other wise they are great.  It would be nice if the container wasn&#x27;t so bulky.  I throw a bunch in a ziplock sometimes.</li>
    <li> These are wonderful hand wipes. Very soft, moisturizing, and smell good! Some reviewers have mentioned an unpleasant smell, but I really like the smell. It is a light, clean vanilla citrus scent that makes my hands smell and feel clean. The smell doesn&#x27;t last a long time anyways, and is much better than the astringent/ rubbing alcohol smell of conventional hand sanitizers. Best of all they have a great ingredients list with no harsh chemicals or toxic ingredients. I like to keep a container in the car as they are great on the go!</li>
    <li> These are wonderful!  I keep them everywhere, in the car, in the house, in my purse.  I bought little loksaks and keep them stashed in about every bag I take with me.  They smell so nice and fresh, with no chemical smell, and are really soft and sudsy when you use them, so you really get a clean feeling.  They are even safe for babies/faces.  I love these!  Great price for prime/subscribe.</li>
    <li> I love these because not only are they pretty inexpensive but they are bio-degradable, flushable and smell nice. It says these wipes are for face and hands but I use them on kitchen and bathroom surfaces. It claims to disinfect with natural ingredients. Orange-vanilla takes a little getting used to but it is a pleasant odor!</li>
    <li> I use these to wipe down high chairs in restaurants, tables my baby will touch, and shopping carts. It&#x27;s a powerful cleaner but without chemicals. I love that it kills germs, smells nice, AND is safe for my infant&#x27;s face and hands. To us, that&#x27;s the trifecta ;) I carry a few in a Baggie, I don&#x27;t lug this big container around. I love them.</li>
    <li> We bought these to keep in our car for our boys&#x27; hands.  They get a bit soapy but we like that they stay moist and get their hands clean.</li>
    <li> The price for these sanitizing wipes is really great, so I decided to give them a try. They contain aloe leaf juice, oil of oregano and oil of thyme. I use as many organic and all natural products as possible, and I do like the scent of orange creamsicle, so that was also appealing.  Their size is perfect for quick hand cleaning, and I also appreciate that they are non-drying. While I would describe the initial scent as a slightly \\&quot;mediciny,\\&quot; the overall scent is still orange-vanilla, and the \\&quot;mediciny\\&quot; part dissipates quickly enough. I like these sanitizing wipes very much and will purchase them again in the future.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: 2012-05-29 I am officially a repeat customer. The more I use these, the more I LOVE them. I keep them throughout the house and have found them to be wonderfully handy.</li>
    <li> These wipes are all-natural with no alcohol so feel better about giving these to my kids rather than the kind found in our local grocery store.  The canister fits perfectly in my car cup holders.  The smell is a little different... but I like it fine (and the kids don&#x27;t complain about it).  The wipes are a good size and moistness, but wish there were more than 40 in a canister (I feel a little cheated that the canister is not full).</li>
    <li> The smell did not bother me, but I started getting a rash and could only pinpoint the use of these wipes. I don&#x27;t think it is a bad product, however.</li>
    <li> These wipes are great. I keep them in my diaper bag, in our vehicles and in the stroller. The smell was strange to me at first but I think that&#x27;s because I was used to those \\&quot;Wet One&#x27;s\\&quot; sensative wipes, that use chemicals to sanitize. Now that I use these wipes I actually like the \\&quot;herby\\&quot;-orangey smell. My mother in law loves these wipes and they actually converted her to buying the wipes, hand soap, antibacterial spray and the method spray! I absolutely love that they are a safer alternative to other sanitizers.</li>
    <li> Good product. Works well.</li>
    <li> This does not smell like Orange Vanilla.  The active ingredient is an oregano oil and it is very overpowering.  Not necessarily something I would want to use on my little one.</li>
    <li> Leaves a lot of white froth/soapy residue when you use it to wipe anything - hands or surfaces. End up having to wipe the froth/soap off with tissue. Wanted to like this but not thrilled with it, would not buy again.</li>
    <li> I really like these. They fit right in the cup holder of my car, do not dry out my hands and have a light scent that I can well tolerate. The only downside is that they can be a little pricey for only 40 wipes.</li>
    <li> Love both scents of this kid and environmentally friendly hand and face wipes. Keep a container everywhere for everything! Def recommend !</li>
    <li> I adore these wipes! I keep them in my diaper bag and use them for everything. I keep them in my kitchen and use them for baby spills.  LOVE THEM</li>
    <li> Unbearable scent. Worst I have ever seen. I rarely review, this is bad. 0 stars, get wet ones wipes. That&#x27;s all there is to say</li>
    <li> Definitely the best priced &amp;#34;Safe Wipe&amp;#34; on the market, which I priced &amp;#34;everywhere&amp;#34;.  The smell is just &amp;#34;really strange&amp;#34; and stays around for a long time, which I&#x27;m sure is because of the essential oil ingredients.  If you&#x27;re sensitive to smells, this may not be your product.  I got past it, due to a &amp;#34;higher concern&amp;#34; with dangerous chemicals, so it&#x27;s still a &amp;#34;winner&amp;#34; with me.  I use these on &amp;#34;everything&amp;#34;, including toys, hands, carseat, interior car surfaces baby touches, door handles, etc.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve ordered this several times now and as usual, everything went really well! It was on time and in good condition. I can&#x27;t really ask for more than that!</li>
    <li> These are good. I like that they are soapy. It is good. You can get two good cleanings out of the wipes.</li>
    <li> These are THE BEST hand sanitizing wipes out there.  I have them close at hand (pun intended) at all times.  They are the best because:&lt;br /&gt;1)  They are all natural&lt;br /&gt;2)  They foam up really nicely&lt;br /&gt;3)  The foam cleans up and sanitized your hands nicely, but doesn&#x27;t leave sticky film&lt;br /&gt;4)  The are the perfect size wipe</li>
    <li> I use these on my 18 month old child after a meal. They have a little more moisture than most wipes I&#x27;ve used and I can clean her hands, face and high chair tray with one wipe.&lt;br /&gt;I have seen reviews that say these stink, but I really like the scent. It&#x27;s exactly what it says- orange, vanilla.</li>
    <li> These wipes work great! The scent is yummy smelling and not too overpowering. I keep the canister in my car for quick hand and face wipes for my two kids. Love that we can get clean and disinfect without harsh or drying chemicals.</li>
    <li> Great for babies and toddlers. My daughter loves them smell so much she tries to eat them whenever we use them on her.</li>
    <li> These seem to work very well.  Smell like thyme, but I kind of like that smell.  I can feel comfortable with my daughter shucking her thumb immediately after applying.</li>
    <li> The smell is a little off and the wipes aren&#x27;t very soft.</li>
    <li> I like the ingredient list of these wipes.</li>
    <li> I had to throw out the whole three pack after using one wipe. The smell was terrible, I can&#x27;t believe anyone uses these!</li>
    <li> It is very hard to find a natural antibacterial hand wipe.  Love this one!  I sent one to school as part of my child&#x27;s supply list and have one in my car to wash my kids&#x27; hands when we aren&#x27;t by a sink.  Works great for disinfecting nasty shopping carts as well, without all of the harsh chemicals on the wipes offered by the stores.</li>
    <li> I chose this 3 packed sanitizing wipes for my kid&#x27;s school.  Good thing is the ingredients are natural, but  there are no seals for individual bottles.  Some of them will be dried before my kids uses them.</li>
    <li> We used these at our daughter&#x27;s wedding for guests to clean their hands after placing their thumbprint on a memory sheet for the bride &amp; groom.  Despite the claim of an orange vanilla scent, they were still very antiseptic smelling.  They were also quite thin, but they did the job OK.</li>
    <li> Love that these are all natural sanitizers, bought the to use on toddler hands instead of chemical sanitizers. Only problem is that they smell terrible.</li>
    <li> Great. Item. Buying again. Nice price</li>
    <li> I ordered this product because my child is constantly sick I wanted something I can take in the diaper bag to wipe her hands in an effort to keep her well.  I also wanted something I can use as well that&#x27;s gentle enough so I can touch my children when I&#x27;m done wiping my hands.  This product was so hopeful until I opened it and used a wipe. There&#x27;s a VERY faint hint of orange but no vanilla. What is smells like is the primary ingredient. It smells like dandalion stems or stinkweed. It isn&#x27;t pleasant and my child hates the way her hands smell when I used it on her.  If it smells that bad, then I wouldn&#x27;t want my child to put her hands in her mouth after using the wipes (which she does cause she&#x27;s 16 months).  This product smells BAD!  So beware.  I will never purchase this again.</li>
    <li> I bought these because I like the fact that they&#x27;re all natural but the smell is so terrible I really don&#x27;t want to use them because every time I use them the first thing I want to try to do is run to the nearest bathroom and wash my hands with anything that will get the horrible scent off my hands. Other than the sent the product is great. The fact that it&#x27;s all natural is a big win for me. I&#x27;m going to try another scent from this product maker and see if I have better luck.</li>
    <li> I like using natural products for my children so this is what we use for disinfectant wipes when we are out and about. They leave your hands a little slimy feeling but as soon as they dry the feeling is gone. They are nice and wet. I have left the container open a few times (accidentally overnight) and they didn&#x27;t dry out. I like the size of the container, It is small enough to keep in my diaper bag yet big enough to use several times before having to replace it. The wipes are just big enough to wash my hands with, but easily do my daughters.</li>
    <li> I bought a three-pack of these wipes and they&#x27;re great. They smell really good (orange vanilla). I&#x27;ve been using them as make-up wipes before I wash my face at night and I&#x27;ve also been keeping one container in my car. Very handy! I also use the wipes made for the bathroom as well.</li>
    <li> The good:&lt;br /&gt;Oregano Oil is very good for disinfecting naturally.&lt;br /&gt;They leave my hands feeling soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bad:&lt;br /&gt;Oregano Oil is very pungent. I don&#x27;t smell the orange vanilla at all. I only smell the oregano oil.&lt;br /&gt;Oregano Oil is very spicy, so if you have this on your fingers, you need to be careful not to rub your eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I appreciate the effort, and them trying to do something natural, but these need a whole lot more orange vanilla in them, or less Oil of Oregano. I use OoO a lot for other things, so I&#x27;m used to the smell and don&#x27;t mind it, but also don&#x27;t prefer it. I would have preferred it to smell like the scent it is advertised to be.</li>
    <li> Unlike some wipes these smell great. I use them to clean my desk at work because the clorox ones are just way to strong for me. I love these.</li>
    <li> These cover hands and face with a soapy film. I plan to send back</li>
    <li> Here&#x27;s what I use these fabulous wipes for:&lt;br /&gt;- Cleaning baby&#x27;s hands and face before she leaves daycare.  I also sanitize her pacifiers at daycare every day.&lt;br /&gt;- Wiping down toys at home periodically.  Cleaning ALL baby items, including those fabric ones you can&#x27;t throw in the washer. I feel better at least giving them a good rub down with one of these.&lt;br /&gt;- Sanitizing library books before baby handles them.&lt;br /&gt;- Sanitizing new toys/books for baby.&lt;br /&gt;Anything else you can think of.  Although the scent is distinct, it doesn&#x27;t linger on things like some other sanitizer scents do.  And it smells better than any of them, and is safe for baby to put her hands/toys/books right in her mouth after sanitizing.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve already gone through two shipments of these in less than 6 months! I love that Cleanwell uses thyme oil rather than alcohol to clean and disinfect, so I am comfortable using it on my baby&#x27;s hands, her face in times of dire necessity, after changing poopy diapers in the car (no sink!), on highchairs at restaurants, and even on toys that have fallen on the floor. Oh yes, and in airplanes because my baby wanted to touch every surface she could reach.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have also tried the hand sanitizing spray in the original scent, but much prefer these since you can wipe off the dirt. Also, I prefer the orange vanilla scent over the original. Granted, my hubbie and sister are not partial to it! However, I find it pleasant and even soothing.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent product to have in a car when you have a toddler that touches everything. It&#x27;s also quite useful if you can&#x27;t wash your hands right away. It&#x27;s very moist, so it leaves my kid&#x27;s hands quite wet but I guess it&#x27;s better than the alternative (not enough cleaning power)! Highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> I got these in a Citrus Lane box and they are pretty terrible.  They leave a sticky residue after you use them and have a really strong smell.  They don&#x27;t really seem to get any of the gunk off of my baby&#x27;s hands and face either.  They are not like regular baby wipes at all.  I would try something else!</li>
    <li> These wipes have a mild, pleasant scent.  They do a great job of cleaning and don&#x27;t irritate sensitive skin.  As long as you keep the lid fully closed, they stay moist inside the container at room temperature.</li>
    <li> Because these aren&#x27;t toxic, I can wipe anything down and not worry about our 19mo old who puts everything in his mouth or our 7mo old who teethes on a lot of things. We keep one of these in the kitchen, one in the car, and one in the diaper bag. If we eat out, I wipe down the table before the kids play in their high chairs or before our toddler eats off the table. Sometimes the kids snatch the wipe from my hand and suck on it. I know they won&#x27;t be harmed if that happens. I also use the wipes to clean the boys&#x27; hands if they get strapped into their high chairs and I&#x27;ve forgotten to wash hands first.</li>
    <li> These wipes bubble up and actually clean your hands or a surface.  Baby wipes are fine but these sanitize and are mild too. Perfect to take along with you.</li>
    <li> I was excited to purchase these to use on my 2 year old. The smell is very strong and she gets upset when I take one out. I dont blame her, I won&#x27;t use it on myself either. For a natural product it smells strong like chemicals, not a pleasant vanilla orange smell like I was expecting.</li>
    <li> Wipes are to dry but that may be a good thing because the smell of this product will make find some soap and water fast.</li>
    <li> These wipes are AMAZING and a must have for all moms!</li>
    <li> I just couldn&#x27;t handle the orange vanilla scent. It reminded me of some kind of chewable tylenol memory from being sick as a kid.</li>
    <li> Love , love , love these. i have bottles stashed all over. They are safe for kiddos, and smell great.</li>
    <li> Product took a little long to arrive. Seems to dry out a little quickly. Still think product is a great alternative to the toxic chemicals of the commercial products though.</li>
    <li> Oh these smell really bad, worse than a hospital smell of disenfectant.  i don&#x27;t think anything of the product is natural.</li>
    <li> Good price and decent product. Wish the wipes were a little more wet, I like to really squeeze that sanitizing liquid under small fingernails and these are rather dry. Scent is just OK, but not bad and no chemical smell. Overall I preferred using the babyganics ones, but had to stop due to them causing rashes on my hands (chemical fragrance). Glad I&#x27;m not allergic to these and they work well enough. I keep them in a little plastic bag in the diaper bag as the canister is too big for portability.</li>
    <li> When I leave a public place with my kids I always believe their hands are gross. I think I am a partial germ-a-phob! These are anti-bacterial and all natural. I don&#x27;t worry about them and I like my kids hands to be bacteria free for a few moments. I keep some in each vehicle and it&#x27;s the first thing we do when we get in. I would buy the a again.</li>
    <li> These are a little too wet for my liking. Having to dry your hands after using a wipe kind of defeats the purpose.</li>
    <li> Gives me confidence that my kids aren&#x27;t putting the nasty in their mouth that they touch all the time.  The smell of the wipes (orange) takes some time to get used to, but after a while you don&#x27;t notice.</li>
    <li> love these wipes and decided to buy so many because they don&#x27;t sell them in Canada anymore.  wish they would come back to canada.  so i highly recommend them in you live in the USA</li>
    <li> These are OK--I am scent sensitive and after reading some of these reviews I was worried how it would smell.  They don&#x27;t smell great, but at least it is not too strong.  Sort of a herbal vanilla citrus.  I find the wipes very soapy, to the point of almost needing something dry to wipe off the residue.  After using, hands felt moist (aloe looks like a main ingredient) and did not have any negative skin reaction.</li>
    <li> I love Cleanwell products and often buy their hand sanitizing wipes in the original scent. I saw these and decided to try it, but am disappointed with the smell. The orange scent is overpowering and not pleasant at all. I would stick with the fresh original scent instead.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure how long they will stay &#x27;wet&#x27; (a reason I usually avoid wipes and prefer a pump sanitizer), but they are great for using around our chickens and rabbits... keeps us from having to run to the sink 50 times</li>
    <li> I love these wipes, even my fiancee does. They smell nice, are soft to the touch, and are gentle enough to use everywhere. Perfect for vacation, especially amusement park trips, and my modeling. I never leave home without these!</li>
    <li> Keep this in our cars.</li>
    <li> My family was looking for a natural alcohol-free hand sanitizer to use during the flu season. I have some health concerns that can make getting sick dangerous, but my son is allergic to all of the artificial ingredients in most hand sanitizers. These wipes are just what the doctor ordered. Love them! The scent is nice, too. Think of something that smells like italian herbs mixed with citrus. That&#x27;s the smell these wipes have. Love them!</li>
    <li> I use these to wash my toddler&#x27;s hands and face before and after a meal. He gets really messy and crusty at meal times, so these are great and non-irritating. Thyme oil is a great all natural disinfectant. My husband does not like using them on the child&#x27;s face because he thinks they are too &amp;#34;soapy&amp;#34;. It absorbs and doesn&#x27;t seem to irritate the tender baby skin, though. They are handy!</li>
    <li> These wipes are one of my favorites. I have two young children, so I constantly have to wipe down little hands when we&#x27;re out of the house. They smell great, are non-drying, and are the perfect moistness.&lt;br /&gt;I just have two small complaints, about packaging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First: I wish they had a travel size in the orange vanilla scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second: They don&#x27;t fit in (my) cup holders, and since I keep these in my car, it&#x27;s somewhat hard finding a convenient spot for them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not that it&#x27;s hard to put several in a little Ziploc baggie.... ;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, a great product, and I will continue to buy!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Added note: I noticed some reviewers thought these were too foamy... I was worried about that myself when I first bought them, but all you have to do is rub your hands together and it soaks in.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve found that when they&#x27;re a bit more moist, it makes it easier to clean my kid&#x27;s hands :D</li>
    <li> We love these wipes! We bring them everywhere we go and use them to clean toys, tables at restaurants, hands, etc. The smell is hard to describe, but is fresh and not too strong. I love that they are made naturally, so I don&#x27;t have to worry when using them on something my infant daughter touches. Because we live in Colorado, the fact that they keep my hands moisturized and doesn&#x27;t dry them out like alcohol-based sanitizers is also a huge plus! I am so glad I found these wipes on Amazon, as we were previously buying them at Whole Foods for $4.99 each! Highly recommend them!</li>
    <li> These really smell like oregano oil.  There is a faint smell of orange vanilla afterward, but the oregano scent sticks around too much for my family to use these.  I realize the benefits of oregano oil, but my children and I don&#x27;t want to smell like it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure how sanitary things actually get from these but I like them. They do smell like weird chemical creamsicles but it doesn&#x27;t bother me too much. I&#x27;m happy to have something more natural to sanitize my hands with.</li>
    <li> Great smelling (antibacterial) wipe.  I really do hope it kills the germs that it claims too because we wanted something safer for our daughter to use when she jumps back in the car, or touches yuky stuff, etc.  These smell great and were one of the safest ratings on skin deep website</li>
    <li> I use this in class and it&#x27;s terriffic.  The kids like it and it cleans up nicely.  Especially like how it closes.</li>
    <li> our favorite hand sanitizing wipes. a real necessity when one has a toddler and I always keep a tube in our backpack. the smell is herbal (thyme and orange), which I really like because it leaves a faint food-like smell on the hands rather than a flowery or chemical odor.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s true what the others say, the smell is not great, but not completely awful and the wipes are very sudsy. Despite those two issues, I will keep them &amp; use them up. Will I order again, the jury is still out....</li>
    <li> I bought these based on all the reviews and that they were all natural. But I think it smells dreadfull and is really foamy. It also left a sticky feel on my hands. Used one and now don&#x27;t know what to do with the rest of them. Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> I try to buy non-toxic products for my kids, and my home. This hand sanitizing wipes are great and very mild on my kids skin. I even clean surfaces with them. My daughter loves the smell... she says it smells like vanilla!!!! They do have a strong smell but we like it. They are also great to clean diaper pails... leaves them smelling fresh!!!!!</li>
    <li> My son loves the play with the &amp;#34;bubbles&amp;#34;; they foam up when really squeezed.  They work well, and leave only a mild sent.  Rate well on ewg.org (so truly earth and people friendly).</li>
    <li> Do not buy these! They smell horrible and are very wet and thin.</li>
    <li> very pleased. normal hand wipes but no poison or toxic ingredients.</li>
    <li> Love these. I keep one canister in the car, and one in the house. With 4 kids, these come in SO HANDY.</li>
    <li> good wipes, a bit pricey, but worth it for an alcohol-free sanitizing wipe.</li>
    <li> I was so excited to try this product but it was a let down.  While it does clean your hands it DOES NOT smell like orange or vanilla.  It&#x27;s has a really bad scent to it.</li>
    <li> Love these wipes.  They smell great -- fresh and clean without being overpowering.  They also don&#x27;t dry out my kids&#x27; sensitive skin, which other wipes seem to do.  We bring these on trips and have them at the food tables when we&#x27;re hosting families @ our house.  I have these on Subscribe &amp; Save and can&#x27;t recommend them enough.</li>
