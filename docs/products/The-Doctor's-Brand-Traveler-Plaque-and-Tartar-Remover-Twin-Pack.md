      <li>I do however love the product.</li>
      <li>love them, and it&#x27;s the best price, but if I had known there were only 2</li>
      <li>I have used this product for years extremely satisfied</li>

      <li>They were both very excited when I gave it to them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

      <li>Great little product.</li>
      <li>Having basically good teeth with minor \\&quot;modifications\\&quot; after a lifetime of contact sports, getting into scraps with unsavory people, and being a bouncer for several years, this tool comes in handy to keep my choppers clean and clear until I can get home to brush &#x27;em.  </li>
      <li>But the price is right</li>
      <li>RECENTLY, SO I WENT ONLINE AND PURCHASED MORE.  </li>
      <li>Much easier to use that a toothpick, and it has a cap!</li>
      <li>The regular denta-piks work much better.</li>
      <li>I prefer them over wooden toothpicks that easily break</li>
      <li>My husband had one of these - a certain pet got it.  </li>
      <li>This really works to remove tarter.</li>
      <li>You&#x27;ll be surprised how useful this is, even after brushing/flossing/rinsing.</li>
      <li>WHEN THE TWO SIDES GOT WORN FROM MUCH USE</li>
      <li>I really like this &#x27;pik&#x27; because of its size and usefulness.  </li>
      <li>Highly recommend.</li>
      <li>that was pointier and worked just a little better between my front teeth.</li>
      <li>THE NEW ONES</li>
      <li>Husband can&#x27;t live without.</li>
      <li>I like to travel as light as possible, but I always have this and a Leatherman Style on my key ring with me at all times.</li>
      <li>Can&#x27;t be much of a review, it is a single piece, no moving parts and does exactly what it is meant to do.  </li>
      <li>We were unable to find these in the local pharmacy and were happy to find them here.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using this exact brand for at least 3 years and purchased this 2 pack for friends of mine who are jealous at my fast ability to fix whats stuck in my teeth when not at home.  </li>

    <li> I HAVE USED THESE FOR YEARS.  I FINALLY LOST MY LAST ONE RECENTLY, SO I WENT ONLINE AND PURCHASED MORE.  I WAS SO DISAPPOINTED WHEN THEY ARRIVED.  AT LEAST MINE STAYED TOGETHER FOR A LONG TIME AND WHEN THE TWO SIDES GOT WORN FROM MUCH USE, I PUT A LAYER OF ADHESIVE TAPE ON ONE SIDE TO SNUG IT UP WHEN I SLID THEM TOGETHER.     THE NEW ONES, I HAD TO PUT TAPE ON THEM ALREADY FOR THE TWO PARTS TO STAY TOGETHER.    MAYBE THE REASON THE MANUFACTURER DOESN&#x27;T MAKE THEM WITH A SCREW ON TOP IS SO WE WILL LOSE THEM AND HAVE TO REPLACE THEM.</li>
    <li> GETS THE GUNK OUT FROM BETWEEN THE TEETH BUT I PREFER PLASTIC OR FLOSS.</li>
    <li> These are the perfect size for travel and keeping in the car or desk. The pick isn&#x27;t the sharpest point but does work fairly well. My one complaint is I lose them often so if you misplace small items buy several.</li>
    <li> I really like this &#x27;pik&#x27; because of its size and usefulness.  However, I had one in the past that was pointier and worked just a little better between my front teeth.</li>
    <li> Compact effective device for removing food that can get stuff between your teeth.  I like to travel as light as possible, but I always have this and a Leatherman Style on my key ring with me at all times.</li>
    <li> I bought this awhile ago but lost them. They come in handy and fit in a purse.</li>
    <li> Have used these for many years and they used to be easy to find in Walmart or the drugstores. Now I can&#x27;t find them anymore. So glad Amazon had these and at a good price. They are good for carrying in your purse when you travel and at home take no room to store.</li>
    <li> By twin pack with two separate packages shown I assumed that I would receive a total of four but in fact this is for one package!  I do however love the product.</li>
    <li> Great little product. My husband and I both carry one of these in our cars. Much easier to use that a toothpick, and it has a cap! Highly recommend. Delivered as scheduled.</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;ve got narrow spaces between your teeth, this won&#x27;t work for you. Not worth returning so I&#x27;ll donate charity.</li>
    <li> Love to keep these in my purse and at my desk.</li>
    <li> We were unable to find these in the local pharmacy and were happy to find them here. They are a good product.</li>
    <li> Stocking stuffers.  I owned one for quite a few years, but I used it for something I shouldn&#x27;t have, and I&#x27;ve been sorry.  But, found these and decided to let others know about them.  You won&#x27;t be sorry with this purchase.  I do keep a few alcohol wipes in my purse.</li>
    <li> They work, but are not as nice as the full pen sized aluminum cased tool I lost. But the price is right and I can share the extra with my lady</li>
    <li> I love having one of these around, be it at home, work, or in the car for eating on the fly. Having basically good teeth with minor \\&quot;modifications\\&quot; after a lifetime of contact sports, getting into scraps with unsavory people, and being a bouncer for several years, this tool comes in handy to keep my choppers clean and clear until I can get home to brush &#x27;em.  There is a plastic or maybe \\&quot;gentle\\&quot; version of this product that&#x27;s even better, but I haven&#x27;t been able to find them. If you have any spots in your teeth that tend to trap stringy veggies like asparagus and celery, or any food, pick these up and keep them around when you&#x27;re not at home.  Be careful, the pointy metal is pretty sharp!</li>
    <li> Works great to take tangles out of fishing line, plus clean your teeth!</li>
    <li> Fast service, excellent merchandise.</li>
    <li> Excellent and portable. I have used this product for years extremely satisfied</li>
    <li> This really works to remove tarter.</li>
    <li> shipped with four 4 sets, good product, reasonable price. I&#x27;d give it 5 stars and recommend it to other people.</li>
    <li> We have been looking all over for these.  Husband can&#x27;t live without.</li>
    <li> I have issues with residual food between my teeth.  I have used these for years and they have reduced dental treatment as they also remove tartar build up.  One goes with me wherever I go.  They do not cause a separation between the teeth like a toothpick tends to.  They are much more effective than the plastic equivalent.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t be much of a review, it is a single piece, no moving parts and does exactly what it is meant to do.  I wouldn&#x27;t be with out it, great to remove food from all those annoying little food traps.</li>
    <li> Who needs dental floss on the go when this fits perfectly into my tiny wallet?  I&#x27;ve been using this exact brand for at least 3 years and purchased this 2 pack for friends of mine who are jealous at my fast ability to fix whats stuck in my teeth when not at home.  They were both very excited when I gave it to them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s especially good at getting between molars close to the gum-line!!!  It works great for the rest of your teeth as well!!</li>
    <li> It says 4 travel pics, but you actually just get what&#x27;s in the picture - 2 travel pics.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love them, and it&#x27;s the best price, but if I had known there were only 2, I would have ordered an extra pack.</li>
    <li> Great product and the price is right.  Brushing and mouthwash just tickle the bacteria that cause plaque.  These guys carry conveniently.</li>
    <li> Besides as tooth pick, I use it as sim card tool on iPhones as well, the only improvement needed is to make the snap close last longer, or threaded, I threw at least 5 away due to the cap and the hook part always detaching .</li>
    <li> These are durable and reusable.  I carry one in my purse, and keep one handy in my kitchen as well as my bathrooms to remove any food caught in my teeth.  I prefer them over wooden toothpicks that easily break and you can&#x27;t reuse.</li>
    <li> My husband had one of these - a certain pet got it.  We couldn&#x27;t find one anywhere locally.  That&#x27;s why we got the twin pack - we will be prepared!!</li>
    <li> Beats a wooden toothpick!</li>
    <li> I was very happy with my order!!!</li>
    <li> I would give these 5 stars if they had a better latch to keep the pick top from coming off.</li>
    <li> This is a great little item. Bought on for me and one for each of my aduly kids. They like it as well. Good stocking stuffer.</li>
    <li> This has lasted me for YEARS.  I use it everyday.  You&#x27;ll be surprised how useful this is, even after brushing/flossing/rinsing.</li>
    <li> Not very effective. The regular denta-piks work much better.</li>
