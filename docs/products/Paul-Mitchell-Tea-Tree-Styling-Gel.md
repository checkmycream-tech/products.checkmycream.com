      <li>I have used this product for years and can say it is my favorite hair gel.  </li>
      <li>I love this gel -</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s better than the 5-star Pantene produce I was using.</li>
      <li>This is my favorite styling gel.</li>
      <li>Truly I cannot speak highly enough about this product, just order it off Amazon at this great price and be satisfied.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s just as light</li>
      <li>Been using this for several years and it works great.  </li>
      <li>Feels smooth, not sticky.</li>
      <li>It is my preferred gel, smooth, does not stay in your fingers.</li>
      <li>I made the mistake of picking up their holding gel at a salon a friend works at, and the styling gel is far and away superior.</li>
      <li>This one is great, I am using it for long time and will continue to do</li>
      <li>Good dry hold and washes out easily too.</li>
      <li>Best stuff to use on my hard to manage hair</li>
      <li>Nice smelling and gives soft hold that is not sticky.</li>
      <li>I was so excited the very first time I used this gel.  </li>
      <li>It has a fresh clean scent too.  </li>
      <li>This clear gel offers great hold and ease of use.</li>
      <li>Looks like they filled it with a much cheaper product!</li>
      <li>, I am very pleased that this product has not lead to hair thinning but it might have actually helped my hair stay strong.&lt;br /&gt;Would recommend it to everyone looking for hair gel.</li>
      <li>The style holds for multiple days without shampooing and still feels nice.</li>
      <li>This one is by far my favorite.</li>
      <li>The smell is a huge selling point, but I also found that it was effective in holding my hair the way a gel should, without making it feel stiff or crispy.</li>
      <li>I purchased our first one from a salon</li>
      <li>Been using this gel for several years and love it.  </li>
      <li>They list as 6 oz, but somewhere there is some fine print to say you only get 2 oz.</li>
      <li>I got a travel size of this gel to try out and really like it.</li>
      <li>You don&#x27;t need much but even if you over do it, your hair won&#x27;t be too weighty.  </li>
      <li>This is not the real thing.</li>
      <li>Otherwise, it&#x27;s good as long as you don&#x27;t need it to be super firm.</li>
      <li>I have very short hair, and this does a great job of holding a &amp;#34;tousled&amp;#34; look without being stiff or sticky.</li>
      <li>I have naturally wavy hair - this product is just right.  </li>
      <li>Finally a styling gel that allows those with sensitive hair and scalp to use confidently without the reactions from highly perfumed products.  </li>
      <li>This is my second bottle, I will most likely stick with this gel.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend it.  </li>
      <li>For some reason, this gel is not being sold anymore in the area where we live.  </li>
      <li>I have very sensitive scalp and any type of hair gel</li>
      <li>I bought my first gel at a local beauty supply store, and now buy it on Amazon.  </li>
      <li>My hair still feels soft and manageable and not sticky.  </li>
      <li>At the same time, it&#x27;s much cleaner than pomade or wax.  </li>
      <li>I put my hair up just about every day and this product makes my thick, wavy hair much more manageable.</li>
      <li>My hair is thin, so I need a styling gel that prevents fly-away hair and gives it more body.</li>
      <li>Scent is pleasant and subtle, not overwhelming.</li>
      <li>The seller shipped fast and actually got a larger size than expected.</li>

<li> This is cheap and fake.</li>
<li> /&gt;It holds my style all day, but doesn&#x27;t feel crunchy or stiff, and has a natural look that isn&#x27;t too shiny or sculpted looking.  </li>

<li> I have had long and short hair styles in the past but this product can be used with either.&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
<li> No real communication, just one &#x27;form&#x27; letter as a reply.</li>
<li> When I purchased this gel, I got a few others to try at the same time to compare.</li>
<li> it gives a wet look</li>
<li> Just a little dab will do ya, so the bottle lasts a long time.  </li>
<li> Will last a long time as it works well with just a small amount!</li>
<li> As you can see from all the other reviews, this stuff is the bomb.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve tried other gels, pomades, and waxes -- but this is the one I&#x27;ve</li>
<li> Like a bucket full of fried chicken on the day you come off your diet.</li>
<li> but when my hair is longer, it has trouble holding it firmly and actually weighs down my hair when the other firm Paul Mitchell gel</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> use it every day and just purchased a second tube.</li>
    <li> It works as described. It&#x27;s better than the 5-star Pantene produce I was using. It&#x27;s just as light and it doesn&#x27;t flake. Best of all, it holds for hours w/o the crunch!</li>
    <li> Disappointed, was looking for wax and found this. Purchased didn&#x27;t paying attention it&#x27;s a gel not a wax. Box look the same....</li>
    <li> A great styling gel for anyone who has scalp psoriasis. It can make y hair a bit dry so I use it in conjunction with John Frieda Freeze Ease cream.</li>
    <li> Before purchasing, I read a review that stated this made her hair feel healthier.  I&#x27;ve had the same result.  The style holds for multiple days without shampooing and still feels nice.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for almost a year now and have been very pleased with it. Holds up all day &amp; has a nice feel.</li>
    <li> Love this Gel! Scent is pleasant and subtle, not overwhelming. Feels smooth, not sticky. Big volume for home use to last a long time.</li>
    <li> Good gel but when my hair is longer, it has trouble holding it firmly and actually weighs down my hair when the other firm Paul Mitchell gel I own performs much better. Otherwise, it&#x27;s good as long as you don&#x27;t need it to be super firm.</li>
    <li> This is the best style gel I have ever used.  You don&#x27;t need much but even if you over do it, your hair won&#x27;t be too weighty.  This holds my style and it goes on without feeling waxy and pasty.  It has a fresh clean scent too.  My hair still feels soft and manageable and not sticky.  It gives body at the roots and  holds all day even in humid weather.</li>
    <li> When I purchased this gel, I got a few others to try at the same time to compare. This one is by far my favorite. The smell is a huge selling point, but I also found that it was effective in holding my hair the way a gel should, without making it feel stiff or crispy. What more could you want?</li>
    <li> This gel works well. Doesn&#x27;t leave the white flakes in your hair like other gels do and holds all day. The seller shipped fast and actually got a larger size than expected.</li>
    <li> I love this gel - it smells great and does not flake. It has a good holding capacity. I have had long and short hair styles in the past but this product can be used with either.&lt;br /&gt;Also, I am very pleased that this product has not lead to hair thinning but it might have actually helped my hair stay strong.&lt;br /&gt;Would recommend it to everyone looking for hair gel.</li>
    <li> This is a great product. Been using for over a year already. Good dry hold and washes out easily too.</li>
    <li> Worked well, great volume, and no scalp residue! Love the nice fragrance too. Will last a long time as it works well with just a small amount!</li>
    <li> In the winter months I tend to let my hair grow out a little. I have naturally wavy hair - this product is just right.  It holds my hair how I want it, but without that crunchy &amp;#34;I put a bottle of glue in my hair&amp;#34; look.  The scent is subtle and a little is all that is needed.  This is my second bottle, I will most likely stick with this gel.</li>
    <li> I have very thin hair, and this product gives me the most hold of any gel I have tried.</li>
    <li> As you can see from all the other reviews, this stuff is the bomb. Just use a little bit on your hair mixed with a little water and watch your hair turn into exactly what you want it to be. Truly I cannot speak highly enough about this product, just order it off Amazon at this great price and be satisfied.</li>
    <li> DO NOT BUY! This is not the real thing. I purchased our first one from a salon and then when looking for a refill I ordered this one. This is cheap and fake. Looks like they filled it with a much cheaper product! Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> Bait and Switch ripoff. They list as 6 oz, but somewhere there is some fine print to say you only get 2 oz. They would not cancel my order. No real communication, just one &#x27;form&#x27; letter as a reply. \\&quot;Sorry, we can&#x27;t help you\\&quot;.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite styling gel. It is of medium thickness, it has the perfect consistency to give my hair the firmness needed to blend the hair together and make it stay where I want it. Other gels I&#x27;ve used work initially but when they dry, the hair begins to separate. My hair is thin, so I need a styling gel that prevents fly-away hair and gives it more body. It&#x27;s a great product.</li>
    <li> Best hair gel ever. I have very sensitive scalp and any type of hair gel makes my hair feel itchy after few hours. This one is great, I am using it for long time and will continue to do so I guess.</li>
    <li> Holds medium, sticky fingers.</li>
    <li> I got a travel size of this gel to try out and really like it. I&#x27;ll be purchasing this larger size. I have a very dry, itchy scalp, and it&#x27;s hard to find products that don&#x27;t irritate it. I also recommend the shampoo/conditioner.</li>
    <li> Been using this for several years and it works great.  Just a little dab will do ya, so the bottle lasts a long time.  Good smell and does not flake.  I was going to try other products and spent a crazy amount of time researching, only to come back to this as it&#x27;s a good price and it works......I don&#x27;t need much more than that.</li>
    <li> Have a problem with flaking. This sure doesn&#x27;t flake and your hair stays in place all day</li>
    <li> I have used this product for years and can say it is my favorite hair gel.  I highly recommend it.  It is firm but dries so you can brush thru it.  Very happy with it.</li>
    <li> Nice product  -not flakey.</li>
    <li> Finally a styling gel that allows those with sensitive hair and scalp to use confidently without the reactions from highly perfumed products.  This clear gel offers great hold and ease of use.</li>
    <li> Nice hold, no residue.</li>
    <li> For some reason, this gel is not being sold anymore in the area where we live.  No store carries it, etc.  Glad I found it online.  It is my preferred gel, smooth, does not stay in your fingers.</li>
    <li> I like that it gives a wet look but the hold isn&#x27;t enough for my thick frizzy hair.</li>
    <li> One of the best gels that can control curly hair.  This is my second tube and going to keep using it.  The best that I have tried in gels and I&#x27;ve been through many of them.</li>
    <li> Another Paul Mitchell winner!</li>
    <li> I have tried lots of hair gels over the years and this one is absolutely the best for getting the job done.  Not sticky and the smell is lovely.</li>
    <li> My son loves this gel.</li>
    <li> Nice smelling and gives soft hold that is not sticky. You will like it just give it a try and you&#x27;ll be hooked!</li>
    <li> Been using this gel for several years and love it.  I&#x27;ve tried other gels, pomades, and waxes -- but this is the one I&#x27;ve &amp;lt;ahem&gt; stuck with (pardon the pun).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It holds my style all day, but doesn&#x27;t feel crunchy or stiff, and has a natural look that isn&#x27;t too shiny or sculpted looking.  At the same time, it&#x27;s much cleaner than pomade or wax.  Also like that it&#x27;s very easy on my hair - some products dry out my hair, whereas this stuff almost seems to condition it.</li>
    <li> Best stuff to use on my hard to manage hair</li>
    <li> You want to look your best? Use this. Seriously. It not only holds your hair in the perfect place- it also smells awesome. Like a bucket full of fried chicken on the day you come off your diet. Yeah- that good.</li>
    <li> My go to hair product. I made the mistake of picking up their holding gel at a salon a friend works at, and the styling gel is far and away superior.</li>
    <li> Smells great, works wonderfully.  You cannot go wrong with Tea Tree Styling Gel.  I would recommend this product to a friend.</li>
    <li> I was so excited the very first time I used this gel.  I bought my first gel at a local beauty supply store, and now buy it on Amazon.  I have very short hair, and this does a great job of holding a &amp;#34;tousled&amp;#34; look without being stiff or sticky.</li>
    <li> I put my hair up just about every day and this product makes my thick, wavy hair much more manageable. It doesn&#x27;t leave my hair sticky and I think it would work great for most hair types. My hair would not make it through the day without this product.</li>
