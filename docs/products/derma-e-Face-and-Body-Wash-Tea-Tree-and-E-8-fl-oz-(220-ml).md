### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>My newest bottle does not have this problem, so I&#x27;m happy.</li>
      <li>Good product.  </li>
      <li>Great wash and reduces redness and swelling effectively</li>
      <li>great for acne, itchy skin and more.</li>
      <li>Tea tree is a natural anti-fungal, so it&#x27;s wonderful for any skin funguses, feminine itchiness and more.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I have mostly been dealing with hormonal breakouts and cystic acne on my cheeks.</li>
      <li>I have been using this product for more than 10 years</li>
      <li>They are well pleased with the results.</li>
      <li>Not produce more flare ups.</li>
      <li>My daughter uses it for psoriasis and works fantastic!</li>
      <li>mentioned before it is drying, but hasn&#x27;t caused a rebound oiliness resulting in more breakouts.</li>
      <li>It might be too much together, however on my body it works great.</li>
      <li>for now I must say this has done a better job than all the rest of products I have used over the years.</li>
      <li>I told him I could get some more.</li>
      <li>and I don&#x27;t find it irritates my skin even though the tea tree scent is really strong.</li>
      <li>I bought it for myself, but couldn&#x27;the tolerate the strong odor.</li>
      <li>many many thanks.</li>
      <li>The bright blue ink was rubbing off.</li>
      <li>It feels cool on skin, does not burn, or cause irritation for me.</li>
      <li>The added aloe vera helps, calms mild redness.</li>
      <li>have tried many products; mainly the staples of problem skin treatment: BP and SA, sulfur based products, differin, antibiotics, tretinoin, AHA&#x27;s, BHA&#x27;s- from that to almost every home remedy for some relieve of my problem skin.</li>
      <li>I had pretty good skin when I was younger</li>
      <li>if you don&#x27;t plan to use this everyday, it&#x27;s a great product to keep in your bathroom.</li>
      <li>I have sensitive skin that can break out with many face washes and creams.  </li>
      <li>it is very gentle on my skin and does the job.  </li>
      <li>This works pretty well</li>
      <li>I alternate days I use it twice and once a day which has kept my problem skin content which is okay at this point.</li>
      <li>This face and body wash clears up your skin more quickly than other benzoyl peroxide washes I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t smell too strong to me, but has a definite hint of tea tree smell.</li>
      <li>Not that i didn&#x27;t expect it, but twice a day is a bit much in</li>
      <li>It seems to deep clean the skin</li>
      <li>Grateful for this product and many other Derma E products!</li>
      <li>Now that my skin is getting older</li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t dry me out, feels clean, and I think it helps battle fungal issues.</li>
      <li>Live and Learn.</li>
      <li>I also have very sensitive skin</li>
      <li>Do prefer the old bottle to this dispenser, Thank you!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s the same brand, but it&#x27;s just a large tube of body wash made for eczema.</li>
      <li>I am not bothered by the smell, so the benefit far out weighs that for me.  </li>
      <li>You can smell the tea tree oil in it, so if you are sensitive to the smell of tea tree oil, I don&#x27;t recommend using it.  </li>
      <li>I like the natural antibacterial properties of the tea tree oil and love that I don&#x27;t have to use soaps filled with dyes, perfumes, &amp; other irritating ingredients while out.</li>
      <li>Which is why i am looking for a product currently to provide that light weight moisturizing, without the added other effects of oiliness, sheen, tacky, or breakouts.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m typically not a reviewer writer as much as I am a readier of them, but I tend to have a strong bias because there happens to be an abundance of fake reviews and company hired reviewers on these types of products..</li>
      <li>After using this product (as directed) for a very short period of time I developed a SEVERE case of blistering,unbearable itchy red crusty patches all over my neck, nose, forehead and cheeks.</li>
      <li>VitaCost is where I typically stock up on this product, but I needed it fast, so I settled for purchasing via Amazon this time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>/&gt;Amazon usually has awesome prices, but this product is a little expensive.</li>

<li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for the past 5 years.</li>
<li> Needless to say, I will be buying this for a long time to come.</li>
<li> so it&#x27;s been a hard adjustment.</li>
<li> at least I feel.</li>
<li> I would like to preface my comments by saying that I have an almost identical review of the Derma e Soothing Skin treatment, the reason being there may be minimal differences in the two products but in my experience they both produced horrible, almost identical complications, just on different areas!</li>
<li> Sadly, coming years and $$ late in my journey.</li>
<li> I really HATE the smell of tea tree oil</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I bought it for myself, but couldn&#x27;the tolerate the strong odor. My daughter uses it for psoriasis and works fantastic!</li>
    <li> I have sensitive skin that can break out with many face washes and creams.  I use, both, Derma E face wash/body wash with tea tree oil/vitamin E and face cream with tea tree oil/vitamin E and have had no breakouts.  You can smell the tea tree oil in it, so if you are sensitive to the smell of tea tree oil, I don&#x27;t recommend using it.  I am not bothered by the smell, so the benefit far out weighs that for me.  Grateful for this product and many other Derma E products!</li>
    <li> I have had a lot of skin problems for the last couple of years since my 4th pregnancy. I had pretty good skin when I was younger so it&#x27;s been a hard adjustment. I also have very sensitive skin so a lot of stuff will fix one problem but create another. I have mostly been dealing with hormonal breakouts and cystic acne on my cheeks. I&#x27;ve tried dozens of different cleansers and creams, medicated and not. I really HATE the smell of tea tree oil but after battling this for so long I decided to take a chance on derma e&#x27;s tea tree and e cleanser after coming across it at a store. Within a week I could see a lot of improvement. I ended up ordering the tea tree skinbiotic treatment cream and since using them together my skin is so much clearer and improving everyday.</li>
    <li> Clears skin in matter of time</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m typically not a reviewer writer as much as I am a readier of them, but I tend to have a strong bias because there happens to be an abundance of fake reviews and company hired reviewers on these types of products..at least I feel. I was stetchy buying this. I think I only did because it was advertised at the bottle of a product that actually came to buy. Because it was only $11 for the size of the product i figured what the hell, why not..again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried many products; mainly the staples of problem skin treatment: BP and SA, sulfur based products, differin, antibiotics, tretinoin, AHA&#x27;s, BHA&#x27;s- from that to almost every home remedy for some relieve of my problem skin. I&#x27;m a healthcare professional, I understand my case, attempt to be hygienic, eat right, exercise, control my intake of &amp;#34;the bad foods&amp;#34; especially on night shifts. But to no avail  at times. Until I tried this face wash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is drying. Not that i didn&#x27;t expect it, but twice a day is a bit much in that it causes skin tightness and its worse will cause minor flaking, but nothing in comparison to BP products. I alternate days I use it twice and once a day which has kept my problem skin content which is okay at this point. Which is why i am looking for a product currently to provide that light weight moisturizing, without the added other effects of oiliness, sheen, tacky, or breakouts.&lt;br /&gt;But for now I must say this has done a better job than all the rest of products I have used over the years. For the little it stays on the skin it does work. It is a gel, somewhat loose, but not runny. It doesn&#x27;t smell too strong to me, but has a definite hint of tea tree smell. It feels cool on skin, does not burn, or cause irritation for me. The added aloe vera helps, calms mild redness. I assume the other ingredients and the tea tree have helped with the healing process. I have noticed previous areas that would normally get redder, peel, sometimes even bleed, and then scab repeatedly until healed all from BP use..actually does not happen. Previous sores just get smaller and heal completely. This i like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As mentioned before it is drying, but hasn&#x27;t caused a rebound oiliness resulting in more breakouts. Everyone&#x27;s skin is different of course.  So, for $11. I&#x27;d say money well spent. Sadly, coming years and $$ late in my journey. But oh, well. Live and Learn.</li>
    <li> So uhh.... I received a different product than what I ordered. It&#x27;s the same brand, but it&#x27;s just a large tube of body wash made for eczema. I like the product I received even though I don&#x27;t have eczema, but why on Earth didn&#x27;t I get the one I ordered</li>
    <li> The summer heat really can make your skin difficult to deal with. It gets too oil or two dry. You never know what is going to happen next. This face and body wash clears up your skin more quickly than other benzoyl peroxide washes I&#x27;ve tried. It seems to deep clean the skin and I don&#x27;t find it irritates my skin even though the tea tree scent is really strong. One thing however - don&#x27;t get this in your eyes. It stings and will make them bloodshot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;~The Rebecca Review</li>
    <li> Used exclusively as a facial wash.  No longer have oily skin, lasts all day</li>
    <li> Great wash and reduces redness and swelling effectively, I wish it were cheaper, but you can&#x27;t have everything</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for more than 10 years and I swear by it.  Do prefer the old bottle to this dispenser, Thank you!</li>
    <li> Good product.  I&#x27;ve used it for a long time.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for the past 5 years. It&#x27;s simply amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s great for acne, itchy skin and more. Tea tree is a natural anti-fungal, so it&#x27;s wonderful for any skin funguses, feminine itchiness and more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have combination skin and don&#x27;t find this product over-drying (and I use the product twice a day). Now that my skin is getting older I don&#x27;t like to use salicylic acid products (not to mention the damage that S.A. can cause to sheets, towels and clothing) as they are way too over-drying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amazon usually has awesome prices, but this product is a little expensive. VitaCost is where I typically stock up on this product, but I needed it fast, so I settled for purchasing via Amazon this time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even if you don&#x27;t plan to use this everyday, it&#x27;s a great product to keep in your bathroom.</li>
    <li> I use this daily for my face and body.  Doesn&#x27;t dry me out, feels clean, and I think it helps battle fungal issues.</li>
    <li> this brand is my favourite brand to use for my psoriasis.  it is very gentle on my skin and does the job.  many many thanks.</li>
    <li> I would like to preface my comments by saying that I have an almost identical review of the Derma e Soothing Skin treatment, the reason being there may be minimal differences in the two products but in my experience they both produced horrible, almost identical complications, just on different areas! After using this product (as directed) for a very short period of time I developed a SEVERE case of blistering,unbearable itchy red crusty patches all over my neck, nose, forehead and cheeks. I stopped use of the product ASAP, but after 5 or 6 weeks of trying to undue the damage caused by this product it still is not completely resolved.</li>
    <li> This product works well for healing my eczema. I do need to be extra vigilant about putting moisturizer on after my shower as the tea tree oil can be drying. I had a problem with the one tube of this that I purchased... The bright blue ink was rubbing off. I&#x27;m allergic to dyes, so I was upset that this was happening. I was trying to heal my skin... Not produce more flare ups. My newest bottle does not have this problem, so I&#x27;m happy. I also pack a travel bottle of this in my purse to use for hand washing in public. I like the natural antibacterial properties of the tea tree oil and love that I don&#x27;t have to use soaps filled with dyes, perfumes, &amp; other irritating ingredients while out.</li>
    <li> This works pretty well, I have switched back to my previous wash but only because I am trying to figure out which one, this one or the face lotion in this same brand, is making my face oily. It might be too much together, however on my body it works great.</li>
    <li> A friend has a teenage son,who has skin problems. I knew this product is what he needed. His mother uses it too. They are well pleased with the results. Her son actually hid it from his mom, to keep it for himself.. I told him I could get some more. Needless to say, I will be buying this for a long time to come. I also use this...HOPE YOU TRY IT TOO!!</li>
