      <li>This moisturizer is great, and it smells amazing...</li>
      <li>I have found that using this gel makes my skin look good</li>
      <li>and at the kiosks they&#x27;re like 200$ lol definitely better off getting it from here</li>
      <li>but I do not care for this moisturizer because it makes your face feel too sticky and also there is alot of fragrance  in the product so it would not be good for a person with any kind of sensitivities.</li>
      <li>And I am in LOVE!</li>
      <li>I love this moisturizer!</li>
      <li>I love this product, just use a good moisturizer after.</li>
      <li>I LOVE it.</li>
      <li>I love De ja Vu products</li>
      <li>Please see my review on the peel for more info.</li>
      <li>I love this product.  </li>
      <li>That&#x27;s how much I love the product</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s takes a long time to find the perfect product that meets all the needs of your complexion.  </li>
      <li>A light moisturizing gel that is perfect for daily use.</li>
      <li>It has a light pleasant scent, which at first worried me becaue</li>
      <li>I am a HUGE fan of the Deja Vu cosmetics line and the Vita Gel ranks at the top of my list.  </li>
      <li>And if I plan on putting on makeup after I&#x27;ve put the cream on, my foundation smooths on sooooo evenly and nicely if I put the vita gel on first.  </li>
      <li>After two uses fine lines are going away</li>
      <li>This product along with the one below are fabulous buys.  </li>
      <li>this is really cheap compared to what sales people are trying to sell this for.</li>
      <li>Though it is sticky when applying as it dries on your face it leaves a smooth texture.</li>
      <li>it must be expired to be that cheap</li>
      <li>This is a super moisturizer.</li>
      <li>Which leads me to believe it was absorbed by my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I can comment on this product right now</li>
      <li>I put it on right after I wash my face</li>
      <li>(Im almost 8 months pregnant with an already large baby).</li>
      <li>Well, I had heard all that jazz before and wasn&#x27;t interested.  </li>
      <li>The results weren&#x27;t pretty.  </li>
      <li>When you apply a small amount on your face, not only do you get a nice feel but drys really nice.</li>
      <li>I love that it soaks into my skin and doesnt leave any residue or make me oily or leave me over dry.</li>
      <li>Gel is very sticky and does not moisturize.  </li>
      <li>This moisturizer is the real thing.  </li>
      <li>Very effective, especially when used following their facial peel.</li>
      <li>Ive been using this particular product for about 3 months now.</li>
      <li>The main Deja Vu site had it priced at around $160 as well.</li>
      <li>Maybe De Ja Vu does this tight sticky thing so a persons face could look tighter , I cant say for sure</li>
      <li>If you have sensative skin that&#x27;s prone to breakouts, I highly recommend this.</li>
      <li>a sales rep tell me this product normally sells for $159.99</li>
      <li>and it is new and not expired.</li>
      <li>II also want to note the that it does a really good job of provding me the proper about of moister with only a little amount of product.</li>
      <li>This product is the same exact thing</li>
      <li>Just a small dab covers my whole face and leaves my skin soft and smooth without an unsightly oily sheen.  </li>
      <li>I have sensitive skin and tend to have reactions with lots of products but not DeJaVu so natural!</li>
      <li>I put it on my face at night and wake up to clear, refreshed skin.</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s unbelieveably soft.</li>
      <li>My skin is less red and fine lines disapear</li>
      <li>In my search, I have found no other product that comes close!</li>
      <li>I am also pregnant, and rub it on the skin on my belly every few nights and have not seen not one stretch mark yet</li>
      <li>months later I am in complete amazement!  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve only done one application so far.</li>
      <li>I tried countless lotions - even moisturizers developed specifically for people of color.&lt;br /&gt;One</li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t had any issues with my skin since I started using it, it doesn&#x27;t cause breakouts for me, and no dry skin problems.</li>
      <li>and I find that this not only does it job by moisturizing my normal to dry skin</li>

<li> It was itching so bad</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> icky smelling and feeling.</li>
    <li> I was hesitant to purchase this product since there was only one review. However, I have used other dead sea products before and decided to try it. And I am in LOVE! Creamy lotions clog my pours almost instantly...so I decided to search for a gel moisturizer . Words cannot describe how well this works! My skin feels moisturized but with no residue. After two uses fine lines are going away and I&#x27;m not breaking out at all! It has a light pleasant scent, which at first worried me becaue I thought my skin might be sensative to it but I have had no issues with it what so ever....If you have sensative skin that&#x27;s prone to breakouts, I highly recommend this.</li>
    <li> Gel is very sticky and does not moisturize.  Have used deja vu for a while and very happy with product line.  Will not purchase this product again.</li>
    <li> I love this product, just use a good moisturizer after.</li>
    <li> I love this product.  I&#x27;ve been using it for about 3 years.  I put it on right after I wash my face and I feel it tightening up my skin as it&#x27;s drying on my face.  And if I plan on putting on makeup after I&#x27;ve put the cream on, my foundation smooths on sooooo evenly and nicely if I put the vita gel on first.  I&#x27;ve been buying it at a kiosk at my mall for the past 3 years, but when I went to buy it yesterday I saw the kiosk was gone! That&#x27;s how much I love the product, that I looked for it on Amazon when my kiosk was gone! I swear by it!</li>
    <li> This moisturizer is great, and it smells amazing... I haven&#x27;t had any issues with my skin since I started using it, it doesn&#x27;t cause breakouts for me, and no dry skin problems. and at the kiosks they&#x27;re like 200$ lol definitely better off getting it from here and you won&#x27;t be sorry!</li>
    <li> I am forty and been using this eye gel for 6 years. It works well. If I had a rough nights sleep or been crying this gel fixes the bags.</li>
    <li> This moisturizer is like nothing I&#x27;ve used before.  It instantly absorbs into the skin.  I use the daily moisturizer with it in the morning and the night time repair at night.  I have had no break outs, no dryness, no blotchy redness.  This product is wonderful.</li>
    <li> Everything is not for everyone. I purchased the gel and my face felt like it was on fire. It was itching so bad I had to wash my face about 3 times before it would stop burning.</li>
    <li> I have found that using this gel makes my skin look good but I don&#x27;t like the tight feeling once this product has dried.</li>
    <li> i can not live without the lotion. its amazing, leaves your skin beauty and feel great.</li>
    <li> Very effective, especially when used following their facial peel. Please see my review on the peel for more info.</li>
    <li> Once I discovered DejA Vu products I was hooked. I have sensitive skin and tend to have reactions with lots of products but not DeJaVu so natural!</li>
    <li> I love De ja Vu products but I do not care for this moisturizer because it makes your face feel too sticky and also there is alot of fragrance  in the product so it would not be good for a person with any kind of sensitivities.Maybe De Ja Vu does this tight sticky thing so a persons face could look tighter , I cant say for sure, I just know for me I tried to return the product but I was not able to because it was opened, yet how could anyone know unless you try a product.  GO FIGURE</li>
    <li> I love this moisturizer! I have combination skin and this moisturizer doesn&#x27;t make me oily and moisturizes my face at the same time!</li>
    <li> As an African American (pronounced Black) man, I had struggled for years to find a facial moisturizer that did the job without leaving my skin oily.  I tried countless lotions - even moisturizers developed specifically for people of color.&lt;br /&gt;One day I was stopped by a vendor at a mall kiosk and given a nail health pitch.  Well, I had heard all that jazz before and wasn&#x27;t interested.  So I asked the woman if there was anything she could do for my oily face.  She showed me this product and told me it would take away all my troubles.  Of course I was skeptical but the sample she applied to my skin actually did what she said it would do.  Still skeptical, I made the purchase.&lt;br /&gt;6 months later I am in complete amazement!  This moisturizer is the real thing.  Just a small dab covers my whole face and leaves my skin soft and smooth without an unsightly oily sheen.  I just depleted that 1.7oz jar a few days ago and went back to a leading moisturizer.  The results weren&#x27;t pretty.  Yeah, my skin is moisturized but I&#x27;m blinding people by the shine on my forehead.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve just ordered another jar of Vita Gel and will use this from now on.  In my search, I have found no other product that comes close!</li>
    <li> Ive been using this particular product for about 3 months now. I LOVE it. I put it on my face at night and wake up to clear, refreshed skin. I am also pregnant, and rub it on the skin on my belly every few nights and have not seen not one stretch mark yet (Im almost 8 months pregnant with an already large baby). I love that it soaks into my skin and doesnt leave any residue or make me oily or leave me over dry. Its the perfect balancer for my combo skin. I bought it from my mall kiosk, but i think I&#x27;ll be buying it from amazon from here on out.</li>
    <li> I have just tried this product at few times. Seems very nice and does not cause my face to break out. I do wish it had a softer smell.</li>
    <li> This product along with the one below are fabulous buys.  My skin is less red and fine lines disapear and it&#x27;s unbelieveably soft.</li>
    <li> As with all cosmetics it&#x27;s takes a long time to find the perfect product that meets all the needs of your complexion.  This one is it for me.  I suffer from Rosacea and I find that this not only does it job by moisturizing my normal to dry skin but I&#x27;ve noticed that I&#x27;m not suffering as greatly from the Rosacea.  It has helped me in lessening the redness that  Rosacea causes.  I&#x27;m certainly not saying that this will work for other suffers in the same way, but it definitely seems to help me.  II also want to note the that it does a really good job of provding me the proper about of moister with only a little amount of product.</li>
    <li> this is really cheap compared to what sales people are trying to sell this for. I had a sales rep tell me this product normally sells for $159.99 but he&#x27;s gonna $50. Pretty questionable in my opinion. The main Deja Vu site had it priced at around $160 as well. But it sells for under $20 here?! So it makes you wonder....are you getting the same thing here vs. there? My answer is YES! This product is the same exact thing and it is new and not expired. When I saw the price I figured it must be expired to be that cheap but NOPE, it&#x27;s NOT. In fact it doesn&#x27;t expire for another 2 years!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All I can comment on this product right now is that it is not like a cream because its a gel. So it is also sticky like the gel you would put in your hair! I&#x27;ve only done one application so far. Though it is sticky when applying as it dries on your face it leaves a smooth texture. When I washed my face at the end of the day there was no layer of stickiness that felt as if it was being washed off. Which leads me to believe it was absorbed by my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I cannot comment on the long term effects of the moisturizer as I just started using it myself. But at least you know you can purchase with out hesitation, as it is the same product as in the stores.</li>
    <li> I am a HUGE fan of the Deja Vu cosmetics line and the Vita Gel ranks at the top of my list.  A light moisturizing gel that is perfect for daily use.</li>
    <li> This is a super moisturizer. When you apply a small amount on your face, not only do you get a nice feel but drys really nice. Great producted.  I have been using this line for a year or so and won&#x27;t change.</li>
