    <li> Thank goodness Amazon sells these travel sizes, so you&#x27;re not obligated to cancel shipments if ordering from their website.  Seemed to make my hair dryer.  After using one entire tube, as directed, I could actually see frizz while my hair was wet!  That&#x27;s a new one!  I wasn&#x27;t at all happy with the results after letting my hair dry.  I need to stop believing these infomercials!</li>
