    <li> This was purchased as a Christmas gift.  He had just run out, so it arrived right on time!</li>
    <li> Smells AMAZING! Both my 12 year old son and 32 year old husband LOVE it! The container is a neat little bonus as well!</li>
    <li> Ladies, this is the cologne you want to buy your man this season!! WOW is all I have to say!  It is certainly one of the best I&#x27;ve smelled, very masculine.  Thank you, Marc Ecko!!!!</li>
    <li> My day 1 fragrance. SMELL IT. AHHH YEAHH.</li>
    <li> i plan on buying more of this stuff and i will continue to buy as long as it is a cheap price.</li>
    <li> Its scent is just like I remember from a few years ago but the staying power is not. After a couple of hours I can smell nor can my girlfriend. Displeased with it because of that sole reason. Newer ones seem watered down.</li>
    <li> Because it met my expectations 100% ...the price was within my budget ..and they made sure the package made it safe.</li>
    <li> Great price for the amount you get.  I absolutely LOVE the smell.  My husband loves it as well.  Get nothing but compliments.</li>
    <li> One of my favorite colognes. This gets me tha most compliments outta everything i wear. And dosent give me headaches like some other fragrances.</li>
    <li> great price ....and came with extras!</li>
    <li> Try it you wont regret.</li>
    <li> Marc ecko puts out some great cologne!!! This cologne should be in every man possession!! It&#x27;s smell real good!! Go out and cop that!! I have received a abundance of compliments!! The ladies heads will turn!! Please trust me!!</li>
    <li> This stuff smells amazing and women will LOVE it.  I have not found one woman that doesn&#x27;t say &amp;#34;You smell so good&amp;#34; when I wear this.  Last night a girl I was hanging out with said those wonderous words, &amp;#34;Oh my God, you smell so good.&amp;#34;  Let&#x27;s just say what happened next made my night ;) I highly recommend this cologne.  It&#x27;s Marc Ecko so I think it&#x27;s a perfect it for a young guy in his teens or 20s (I&#x27;ll be 24 in a month).  My only complaint is it doesn&#x27;t last a while, but at the same time you can put on like 10 sprays and it&#x27;s not overpowering which is really nice.  There is NOTHING worse than an overpowering cologne and this cologne has a perfect subtlety to it.</li>
    <li> Clean irresistible scent. Wonderful purchase!</li>
    <li> I WAS LOOKING FOR MY SON SOMETHING THAT WAS NOT TO OLD FOR HIM THIS SMELL GREAT!! MY SON IS 15 AND HE LOVES IT THE SMELL IS NOT TO LOUD JUST RIGHT!!</li>
    <li> Great perfume. Loved it!</li>
    <li> Good smell, lasts a long time and you dont need much. Love the bottle and design. The package that the bottle comes in is a giant spray paint can made of plastic, I keep my caps in it.</li>
    <li> Bought this as a gift for my boyfriend. The packaging is great - the durable outter plastic &amp;#34;tube&amp;#34; protects the cologne and makes it easy to transport. The smell is wonderful and something that he and I both love!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my boyfriend for Christmas and he loves it and I love it on him. And I live the container it comes in</li>

    <li> It smells very much like Acqua Di Gio in my honest opinion. Maybe a slight more \\&quot;citrusy.\\&quot; Very clean and sporty. The bottle and the packaging are very nice but mine also arrive cracked. But that&#x27;s just the outter box so it doesn&#x27;t matter to me. For the price, it&#x27;s really good and looks awesome on your dresser or shelf.</li>
    <li> Great colonge, smells great</li>
    <li> Whenever i wear this to work and bless the hallways with this scent the females go crazy...one lady told me i smell Delicious :)</li>
    <li> This perfume has a very nice crisp scent. It is very clean and light. I will purchase this fragrance again.</li>
    <li> Always get praises when wearing this product,,, usually wear Armani... but get as many compliments with this product. plus is a lot cheaper</li>
    <li> I love the packaging! The perfume came in just as it said it would. I love the scent but my brother thinks it smells like gum lol anyways buy it! for me it smells amazing!</li>
    <li> I am allergic to strong smells and this is a mild delightful scent . Great!! I will continue to buy this.</li>
