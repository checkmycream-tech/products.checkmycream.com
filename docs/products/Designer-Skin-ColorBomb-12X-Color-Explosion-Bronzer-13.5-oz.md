      <li>I have used this brand for years and is still one of my favorite bronzers...</li>
      <li>I couldn&#x27;t resist trying this one even though I have too many lotions already.</li>
      <li>FINALLY A SELF TANNING THAT HAS A REFRESHING SENT &amp; works beautifully!!!</li>
      <li>The smell was extremely potent, too purfumey and gave me a headache.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried so many name brand self tanning lotions.</li>
      <li>I have tried many lotions sine</li>
      <li>i love designer skin lotions &amp; you can not beat these prices</li>
      <li>and I have never been able to see a difference after tanning once, until now.</li>
      <li>:)</li>

      <li>Arrived quickly and this stuff really works well to get a good tan going  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not the most powerful bronzer available</li>
      <li>It literally smells like a cheap at-home self-tanner.</li>

      <li>I compare the smell to the smell of cheap self tanning lotions.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used many different bronzing and tingle lotions and this is by far the best.</li>
      <li>There are many other amazing bronzers that are at or around this price point that are SO much better and give you better quality results.</li>
      <li>I love the way it smells right after I get finished tanning.</li>
      <li>First of all, when I received this in the mail I opened the box, and the lotion had leaked all over!!</li>
      <li>Buy this lotion at a salon or site you trust, very worth it...</li>
      <li>I originally tried this product in a packet from my tanning salon.</li>
      <li>Two, it turned my feet and hands bright orange, and left orange streaks on my arms and legs.</li>
      <li>my salon charges about $75-$90 for the full size bottle.</li>
      <li>The good smell doesn&#x27;t last.</li>
      <li>The smell is light, fresh, and citrusy.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> i love designer skin lotions &amp; you can not beat these prices,that is all i have to say about this item</li>
    <li> Love!!! Gives great color FAST!! Not streaky or bad smelling either. Will buy again!</li>
    <li> This tanner defiantly helps me come out of the tanning bed dark after only a few times tanning!</li>
    <li> Love all the Designer Skin products, this one has become a quick favorite.  I use it to tan, but also use it when I want to build a nice bronzed glow that doesn&#x27;t look &#x27;orange&#x27;. The scent is wonderful, sweet and not &#x27;tanning product&#x27; smelly. Be sure to wash your hands right after applying as it will stain your palms which doesn&#x27;t look natural!  Just bought my second bottle from the seller today - they are prompt and courteous!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love love love this product. I&#x27;ve used many different bronzing and tingle lotions and this is by far the best. It leaves you tan as if I just walked off of the beach. It looks like it wont do much because the lotion is so light but it leaves you brown. Im in love with this lotion and I highly recommend it for people with pale skin trying to get a quick tan.</li>
    <li> I recently tried this lotion and LOVE IT!!!  I got dark sooo fast, it&#x27;s now my regular lotion.  I made the mistake of paying more for it at my salon, but will be buying again online instead for a better price.  But still, lotion was well worth it.  Smell is pretty good, not really strong.  No streaking or problems.</li>
    <li> Very excited to use. Just checked my mail, and my lotion was there today! I have used this lotion before, but that was when I bought it from the actual tanning salon. Now, i will only buy my lotions very amazon. Same quality, but waaaay cheaper.</li>
    <li> This product is silky, gives great color and smells great!!! For an added bonus- mix it with Bombshell- dark,dark,dark!! You will love how u look!</li>
    <li> I got a sample packet of this lotion at my tanning salon. I am so glad I tested it before I just went and bought it. It rubs in nice and smooth but it smell exactly the Jergen&#x27;s self tan lotion. I don&#x27;t like that smell so if you know how strong and weird that well is you know what this lotion smells like. It gave a good tan and felt very nice but the smell was just to much, and I like smelly lotions.</li>
    <li> I bought this product about a month ago. I do like the smell a lot, but if you don&#x27;t spread this lotion on evenly you will have streaks on where you missed.</li>
    <li> I love this lotion! I have tried many lotions sine I worked @ a tanning salon and this one gave me instant results. I love the way it smells right after I get finished tanning. Since it has DHA in it which is the same thing that self tanning/ spray tans have, over time having it on the smell changes a little but I still think its a great lotion! :)</li>
    <li> I originally tried this product in a packet from my tanning salon. I knew I loved it from the day I tried it. my salon charges about $75-$90 for the full size bottle. I decided to check it out on amazon. I wasn&#x27;t sure if it would be listed on here where the product is so new but it is! The price you cant beat, the smell is amazing, and the color is natural and deep. If your looking for a bronzer without the orange then this product is for you! The lotion is light and absorbs quickly and keeps your tan fresh and radiant. I WILL be buying this again!</li>
    <li> Color bomb is absolutely my favorite tanning lotion. It smells amazing and gave me an awesome tan. I switched between it and Phoenician to keep from getting too much bronzer, but I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s necessary. It&#x27;s totally worth the price here, especially considering my tanning salon sells it for $90!</li>
    <li> This product works great! It came highly recommened at my tanning salon but Amazon&#x27;s price was so much cheaper! So I ordered it and loved it! Goes on smooth,great color and great post tanning smell! Will order again!</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t resist trying this one even though I have too many lotions already. It&#x27;s everything you&#x27;d expect from Designer Skin. It absorbs really quickly, as all of their juice-based lotions do, without feeling sticky or greasy. It&#x27;s not the most powerful bronzer available so it didn&#x27;t make much of a difference on my skin, but I think beginning to medium experienced tanners will get some nice visible results from this. The smell is light, fresh, and citrusy. It actually smells IDENTICAL to Black. I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if DS used the same fragrance and called it something else. I recommend this lotion to anyone who is eager to try something new.</li>
    <li> smells amazing imo, does have a self tanner after smell verrry slightly nothing bad. hydrating, easy to blend, and the color is insane i love it! just bring hand sanitizer or hand wipes into the room with you and wash your hands after you&#x27;re done tanning or els you will be stained. designer really stepped it up with bronzers this year! LOVE it!! and try to rotate this with a maximizer with no bronzer and it&#x60;ll give you the best results.</li>
    <li> Best tanning lotion I&#x27;ve ever used. I noticed results right away. I tan less then I did before switching to this lotion.  Love it!!!</li>
    <li> This is nothing against the seller, this particular lotion gives an orange hue on your skin and stains hands regardless of how careful you are with washing your hands after use.</li>
    <li> first off i am like the whitest chick with natural redhair ever.&lt;br /&gt;well after using almost all the bottle I hate the say that I am a orange oopma loompa.. i hate that and the stuff stinks when you come out of the tanning bed. I almost have to immediately cover up the awful smell with some sort of moisturizer that smells far better than that. I even went to my salon and they have discontinued to use it due to the many complaints of the coloration after a few times in a bed. I hope the next bottle i get will be far more superior than this.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure what lotion they put in this bottle but I repeat it is NOT the lotion you think you are purchasing! I&#x27;ve worked in a tanning salon for long enough to know this lotion and to know a bronzer when I see it and this is by NO means Colorbomb let alone a bronzer!  It smells great and it might help me with a tan, but that doesn&#x27;t matter, what matters is that this lotion is a FAKE. I will never do business with the seller again!</li>
    <li> Im in love with my color bomb lotion. It leaves my skin just the right color and smells super delicious.</li>
    <li> No thanks, it smells disgusting &amp; I just didn&#x27;t care for it overall.  I give it 2 stars.  It did get me somewhat brown but it stained my hands very bad.</li>
    <li> I have purchased this product at the tan salon and it is very much different than the product i purchased on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;Seems like a totally different product. I was trying to save some money but in the end just cost me more. I wont be purchasing&lt;br /&gt;any more.</li>
    <li> USE THIS LOTION AT THE TANNING SALON AND LOVE IT, CLEAN SMELL AND DON&#x27;T FEEL ALL YUCK WHEN USING IT AT LUNCH</li>
    <li> Arrived quickly and this stuff really works well to get a good tan going  just be careful when using it without SPF.</li>
    <li> My teenage daughter loves it.  She only has to go in the salon once a week with this one and she is dark for the week.</li>
    <li> Highly Satisfied as always!</li>
    <li> I bought mine at a salon for 54 (including tax) and it really is awesome! I would buy it online for cheaper BUT i dont trust them, especially since I bought  Millenuim Black Storm 60x bronzer for 15.00 and I think its a fake... Buy this lotion at a salon or site you trust, very worth it...</li>
    <li> This product turned my skin so orange! I could never rub it in enough for it to blend and not look streaky! I tried just to do my legs, and my arms ended up with orange splotches! ANY contact with your skin turns orange. Definitely not worth the money...I have stopped using mine!</li>
    <li> Ive tried a ton of D.S. lotions and fell in love with all of them, this on the other hand not at all. Only tanning lotion that has ever left me streaky!!! I wash my hands after rubing it on and they still turn orange! streaks on my feet/legs.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried so many name brand self tanning lotions. They all work, but some fade off with blotches &amp; have a destinct odor!! FINALLY A SELF TANNING THAT HAS A REFRESHING SENT &amp; works beautifully!!!</li>
    <li> way cheaper online than in the tanning salon and worth the money I paid. It was less than half than what it was in the salon and I used every last drop. I don&#x27;t tan easily but this made my tan intensify so much! I will probably go with a stronger intensifier next time but would gladly go back to this as well. It smells good also. Which to me is a huge plus!!</li>
    <li> Tried this in packets in the tanning salon. Loved the color that it gives me, but most of all I love the way it doesnt give me that &amp;#34;smell&amp;#34; that most tanning lotions and bronzers have.  Just make sure that you have baby wipes or a wet washcloth with soap on it to wipe your hands off right after you put lotion on.</li>
    <li> Smells amazing! Gave me a great color and didn&#x27;t leave me with that tanning bed smell, I didn&#x27;t have any problems with orange streaks or stained hands.</li>
    <li> It was suggested that I get this product.  So I purchased it after reading reviews and it seemed to work for allot of people.  I am very fair skinned along with freckles.  I ended up putting this on to tan and it stained my hands along with looking splotchy on my legs.  It is very frustrating for me when going to a tanning bed and the room is dark and you can&#x27;t really see if there are going to be darker spots or it hasn&#x27;t been blended in very well.  It takes a while for the stains to go away and it is embarrassing.  Please let me know what I am doing wrong.  It seems to look OK on the stomach and face but on the legs and hands it is blotchy.  Any help would be appreciated.  I am a first time tanner have been only doing it for a couple of months and was using High Society Tanning Bronzer.  It seemed to work.  The salon does not sell that anymore, since then I have purchased Color Bomb which was recommended by the tanning salon.  VERY DISAPPOINTED!  Now I have a full bottle of this and I am not happy with it.  It is sad that there isn&#x27;t a way to get your money back, but this is a lesson learned.  Still wanting to get opinions of what is the best tanning bronzer on the market today.  Thanks.</li>
    <li> The bottle was full, clear that it was never used and compared to the real bottle at my salon, it smelled and felt exactly the same! :) i recomend this lotion for woman with white, fair or dark skin tones! It makes you 2-5 shades darker with ONE tan! Use it!!!</li>
    <li> Provides a nice color an hour or so after you finish tanning. Not a huge fan of the smell, but that&#x27;s a minor thing to me. I primarily just want a good lotion, that doesnt leave me feeling dry, and gives me some color. Would buy again.</li>
    <li> Great product. Has good bronzer. Doesnt streak. Very happy, would buy again. If you dont tan well, this will help.</li>
    <li> It Was A Good Lotion With A Good After Scent</li>
    <li> I bought this because I usually love Designer Skin products but this was my first bad experience. This lotion smells wonderful and goes on well but then after you tan the smell changes and it is not pleasant. I even tried to wash it off and put on some Bath &amp; Body lotion and the smell would not go away! I compare the smell to the smell of cheap self tanning lotions. On top of that I don&#x27;t even really think it works that well I didn&#x27;t get any darker after a couple of uses.  Just my opinion or course but I will not buy this again I will stick to the lotions I know smell good and work....</li>
    <li> This is great tanning lotion for indoors and cheaper then the salon</li>
    <li> It smells GREAT!!!!!!!  And you will get great color. Although is is a bit of a process to get color fast with.</li>
    <li> This lotion is wonderful. They smell the quality. I really loved the price. I saved a ton no buying at the tanning place.</li>
    <li> The only lotion that i buy is Designer Skin. I have never had a problem with any of their lotions turning me orange. This Lotion turned me orange on my feet, hands and wrists. It does smell amazing, just like most all of their other lotions.</li>
    <li> I bought this product at the tanning salon (big mistake) for nearly $50, and I was expecting good results since the consultant said it was \\&quot;the new hit thing.\\&quot; Well, I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s just me, but one, it smelt terrible. Like shower immediately terrible. Two, it turned my feet and hands bright orange, and left orange streaks on my arms and legs. And three, other than the orange streaks, I saw no color difference. Neither did anyone else. I used it for about a month with four different tanning beds, and I never saw any change except I started turning the color of a pumpkin.</li>
    <li> This stuff works!!!! Its amazing. Last time I got a month of tanning I eas useing designer skin spellbound and that stuff worked alrite.  It smelt amazing but didn&#x27;t getme dark. This stuff got me realllllly dark! I love it!!!</li>
    <li> Love this product - smells amazing and really maintains your tan.</li>
    <li> I really do like this color bomb tanning lotion. Seems to be the real&lt;br /&gt;Deal for half of the price of what tanning salons charge. I&#x27;ve enjoyed using it but if you don&#x27;t wipe off or wash off after you apply it  it will turn your skin orange right in between your fingers. I also got a skin rash on my left hand but could be a reaction between my skin and the lotion. Other than that it is a great product!!</li>
    <li> With just one visit to the tanning bed and using this I noticed I got remarkably darker! Color Bomb is an amazing lotion!</li>
    <li> This lotion smells great. I get lots of compliments at the tanning salon. And, the results are fantastic! My tan looks awedome</li>
    <li> allstar tanning i will never purchase from you again!i recieved my designer skin coco de ville and colorbomb combo with both lotions wrapped in saran wrap they were both leaking all0ver the pakage!both l0tions are also very runny!never had a designer skin lotion like this.N0T G00D!</li>
    <li> I got this lotion when I first began tanning and I knew it had DHA and bronzers in it because I wanted that immediate and delayed color. Initially, the lotion smelled great, nice consistency, felt moisturizing. The ATO is HORRIBLE. It literally smells like a cheap at-home self-tanner. The good smell doesn&#x27;t last. Very streaky and orange as well. There are many other amazing bronzers that are at or around this price point that are SO much better and give you better quality results. Worst lotion ever.</li>
    <li> I got Color Bomb with a Groupon I bought. A months worth of tanning and a free bottle of lotion at my local tanning salon. I have only used it once but I already like it. It smell great and I have never been able to see a difference after tanning once, until now. I haven&#x27;t tanned in years and I have gotten really white but after one time use I see a difference. I believe everyone skin is different and what may work for me may not work for the next person, but I love the lotion already!!</li>
    <li> First of all, when I received this in the mail I opened the box, and the lotion had leaked all over!! So I saved what I could, and when I tried it out, the lotion was horrible. The smell was extremely potent, too purfumey and gave me a headache. And there was not a lot of bronzes in it and I didn&#x27;t receive much color from it. Horrible lotion, and I will never order from this company again.</li>
    <li> I have used this brand for years and is still one of my favorite bronzers...</li>
    <li> This lotion rubs in smooth and evenly. LOVE IT!!!! I told my co-worker about it and she had me order her 2 bottles of it today.</li>
    <li> I like this lotion a lot, it smells good and works even better. I am a fair skinned person and got an awesome tan within a month of using it. Be sure to wipe your hands though because it can leave them a little streaky. Retail price is around $80 also.</li>
