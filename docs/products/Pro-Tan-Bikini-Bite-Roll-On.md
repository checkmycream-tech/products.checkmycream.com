      <li>Still a good product for competition.</li>
      <li>I was very pleased.  </li>
      <li>i got my order very promptly and got it for the best price anyone had to offer</li>
      <li>I would use it again, but wish there was a product that was somewhat more effective and easier to use.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m a figure competitor that has a nice size lady bump on my back side, so I need my bikini to stay in place perfectly when I&#x27;m on stage.</li>
      <li>I ordered it to use for a bikini competition and it worked well keeping my suit in perfect place for the entire day.</li>
      <li>Works okay for things that aren&#x27;t being pulled on, but to keep the costume shorts from riding up, we like IT STAYS better</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m sure there are ways to avoid that though.</li>
      <li>Thankfully I was able to borrow bikini bite in spray form from another fitness competitor.</li>
      <li>Thank goodness I was able to borrow some from another competitor.  </li>
      <li>Better than anything else I&#x27;ve ever tried.</li>
      <li>I know that bikini bit overall is a very good product but the one I purchased was defective and the glue substance was literally pouring out getting all over my hands and clothes.</li>
      <li>Easy to use, roll on..washes off easily with soap and water</li>
      <li>and it worked just fine.</li>
      <li>Great stuff definitely recommend but make sure the area your putting it in is dry product works great though thank u</li>
      <li>It work pretty good when you first put on</li>
      <li>It does stick, which is great, but I think the spray would have been much better, and not as messy.</li>
      <li>Came on time - just as expected - great.</li>
      <li>Definitely did a good job holding my suit in place.</li>
      <li>I have an ample gluteus maximus so for my first figure competition, I was nervous about keeping my booty in my posing suit!  </li>
      <li>This is just the right amount of \\&quot;stick.\\&quot;</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been competing for several years and this is hands down the best product on the market.</li>
      <li>It worked really well and washes off with just soap and water, unlike the spirit gum that must be removed with a special remover.</li>
      <li>It took a while to get the product to dispense, and even though I put a good amount on, there was still a little bit of slippage during my time on stage.</li>
      <li>I had to run it under hot water (as it instructed on the bottle) for quite some time before it freed up.  </li>
      <li>All of this happened on the first day of using this product.</li>
      <li>Thanks so much!</li>
      <li>It also provided a little humor for me as EVERY girl at the show was carrying around a bottle of this amazing stuff.  </li>
      <li>Fast shipping, though roller ball was glued shut.  </li>
      <li>Bikini Bite really works.</li>
      <li>I really like this product.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend!</li>
      <li>Love this stuff, you never have to worry about slipping out.</li>
      <li>Highly recommended!</li>
      <li>the roll on is kind of messy.</li>
      <li>went back to my original</li>
      <li>I do not recommend this product for trying to keep thigh high stockings in place.</li>
      <li>Used this to try and keep my thigh high socks in place and the product did not keep hold.</li>
      <li>I opened the product, but the product would not come out of the container - the roller ball was completely stuck.  </li>
      <li>Exactly what I expected.</li>
      <li>I was not able to use it because the applicator was not working well, luckily they had some there for me to use.</li>
      <li>Worked well for the first few minutes</li>

<li> The product was heard inside, but somehow dried to the ball and made it completely un-useable.  </li>
<li> Not sure what the issue was since it was brand new.  </li>
<li> 2 other girls on our team got the same thing even though they all were wanting to order the spray.</li>
<li> Did not hold quite as well as expected but</li>
<li> I DID NOT REALLY WORK FOR WHAT I WANTED</li>
<li> I used this instead of Spirit Gum to keep Mustache and Beard from slipping around while helping Santa out.  </li>
<li> We ended up just sharing one and returned the other 2.  </li>
<li> Other than that annoyance</li>
<li> I kept reapplying it but as soon as I would sit down or bend over adhesive would give out.</li>
<li> I my have to reapply after a few hours</li>
<li> I found out the hard embarrassing way!</li>
<li> Difficult to get the product to prime.  </li>
<li> I thought maybe I had just misread it and ordered the wrong thing but</li>
<li> My swimsuit bottom still crawled up my butt, needless to say, I still won 1st place.</li>
<li> I got one with a bad bottle, the ball doesn&#x27;t spin to dispense the product.</li>
<li> totally disappointed.  </li>
<li> I also used it to hold an annoying bra strap in place..</li>
<li> it doesn&#x27;t stick to anything very bad.</li>
<li> Doesn&#x27;t hold your bikini on place but DOES leave a disgusting glue-like film.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Bikini Bite really works. This product can be used for photo shoots, competitions, or even to hold a girl&#x27;s unmentionables in place for an evening out.</li>
    <li> The performance brands bikini bite helped keep my suit in place.</li>
    <li> Great price for competitions</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a figure competitor that has a nice size lady bump on my back side, so I need my bikini to stay in place perfectly when I&#x27;m on stage. This product gets the job done. I my have to reapply after a few hours but I still think it&#x27;s a great product. Better than anything else I&#x27;ve ever tried.</li>
    <li> Worked well for the first few minutes then it didn&#x27;t stick, I&#x27;d go with the spray.</li>
    <li> I use this for NPC competitions and it is just perfect.  Some adhesives do not stick well enough and some tear your skin when you try to remove your suit.  This is just the right amount of \\&quot;stick.\\&quot;</li>
    <li> worked great for my fitness competition! no problems with it...it does feel like taking a bandaid of though when you peel off your garment. I&#x27;m sure there are ways to avoid that though.</li>
    <li> It worked but it ended up being the roll on instead of the spray. I thought maybe I had just misread it and ordered the wrong thing but 2 other girls on our team got the same thing even though they all were wanting to order the spray. We ended up just sharing one and returned the other 2.  Other than that annoyance like I said it did work for our WNBF bikini competiton.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been competing for several years and this is hands down the best product on the market. Period. Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t hold your bikini on place but DOES leave a disgusting glue-like film. Don&#x27;t even bother.</li>
    <li> this stuff is amazing! i got my order very promptly and got it for the best price anyone had to offer</li>
    <li> Difficult to get the product to prime.  Did not hold quite as well as expected but overall did what I needed.</li>
    <li> it doesn&#x27;t stick to anything very bad.</li>
    <li> This did not keep my bikini in place after a short time!</li>
    <li> I had to use this for a bikini competition, and it worked fairly well. It took a while to get the product to dispense, and even though I put a good amount on, there was still a little bit of slippage during my time on stage. I would use it again, but wish there was a product that was somewhat more effective and easier to use.</li>
    <li> Does what it&#x27;s made for -to hold bikini in place on your skin -but it doesn&#x27;t pull or tear the skin. Its like a roll on glue stick. Worked great for my fitness competition!</li>
    <li> Works okay for things that aren&#x27;t being pulled on, but to keep the costume shorts from riding up, we like IT STAYS better</li>
    <li> Definitely did a good job holding my suit in place.</li>
    <li> Worked great for my competition!!</li>
    <li> Product worked great - I applied two coats the day before and one coat the day of competition - no streaking at all.</li>
    <li> It work pretty good when you first put on but when you go from standing to sitting it came off the skin. Still a good product for competition.</li>
    <li> this stuff does not work at all.  totally disappointed.  went back to my original It Stays Body Adhesive which does work</li>
    <li> my butt was big enough to keep everything in place but i let another girl borrow it.  Her suit stayed on great... getting it off was another thing.  It stays on, you may lose some skin but your suit will not fall off</li>
    <li> Great stuff definitely recommend but make sure the area your putting it in is dry product works great though thank u</li>
    <li> I really like this product. It holds my competition bikini in place and it doesn&#x27;t leave any residue on the fabric when it&#x27;s removed (and the suit is properly washed).</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t get the product out of the thing to even try it.  I got one with a bad bottle, the ball doesn&#x27;t spin to dispense the product. Please send me another!</li>
    <li> I ran it under hot water still wouldn&#x27;t work :/</li>
    <li> Fast shipping, though roller ball was glued shut.  I had to run it under hot water (as it instructed on the bottle) for quite some time before it freed up.  Works great unless you sweat.  I found out the hard embarrassing way!</li>
    <li> keeps those clothes in place</li>
    <li> Came on time - just as expected - great.</li>
    <li> I know that bikini bit overall is a very good product but the one I purchased was defective and the glue substance was literally pouring out getting all over my hands and clothes. All of this happened on the first day of using this product. Thankfully I was able to borrow bikini bite in spray form from another fitness competitor. I will not be purchasing the roll on again.</li>

    <li> I have an ample gluteus maximus so for my first figure competition, I was nervous about keeping my booty in my posing suit!  Anyone who has done a figure competition knows that feeling.  Bikini Bite did its job and did it well.  I was very pleased.  It also provided a little humor for me as EVERY girl at the show was carrying around a bottle of this amazing stuff.  Bikini Bite is very popular amongst the competition world.</li>
    <li> Roller ball was defective.</li>
    <li> The product worked for me.  Although when I received it - it had leaked all over itself within its plastic wrap.  No biggy, I cleaned it up and it worked just fine.</li>
    <li> I was not able to use it because the applicator was not working well, luckily they had some there for me to use.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff, you never have to worry about slipping out.</li>
    <li> Worked great... bought it because of a suggestion by a reviewer for silicone inserts. They held well throughout a 12 hour shift.. I also used it to hold an annoying bra strap in place..worked like a dream. Easy to use, roll on..washes off easily with soap and water</li>
    <li> Good stuff.  Will buy spray plus roll on for competitions.</li>
    <li> the roll on is kind of messy. It does stick, which is great, but I think the spray would have been much better, and not as messy.</li>
    <li> I ordered this product to use for a competition.  I opened the product, but the product would not come out of the container - the roller ball was completely stuck.  The product was heard inside, but somehow dried to the ball and made it completely un-useable.  Thank goodness I was able to borrow some from another competitor.  Not sure what the issue was since it was brand new.  Going to purchase the spray version</li>
    <li> Great product!! Placed order Sunday afternoon, received Tuesday afternoon with standard shipping! Exactly what I expected. Thanks so much!</li>
    <li> I used this product for a bikini competition last year and this didn&#x27;t work for me. My swimsuit bottom still crawled up my butt, needless to say, I still won 1st place.</li>
    <li> The bikini bite worked great!  I ordered it to use for a bikini competition and it worked well keeping my suit in perfect place for the entire day.</li>
    <li> DID NOT KEEP BATHING SUIT IN PLACE I DID NOT REALLY WORK FOR WHAT I WANTED IT TO WORK DID NOT SAVE ME FROM KEEPING MY BATHING SUIT IN PLACE</li>
    <li> Purchased to use for dance costume to keep legs of leotard in place and open back. Works great. Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> Used this to try and keep my thigh high socks in place and the product did not keep hold. I kept reapplying it but as soon as I would sit down or bend over adhesive would give out. I do not recommend this product for trying to keep thigh high stockings in place.</li>
