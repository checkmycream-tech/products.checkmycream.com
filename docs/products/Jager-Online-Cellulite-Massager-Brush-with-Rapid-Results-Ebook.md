<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Nice tool for removing cellulite. I keep and use it in the shower. Just add some of your body wash and rub it on the problem areas. You can also use it for a massager for your head for stress and hair growth. This massager can also be used with cellulite cream remover or a machine. There is a free bonus rapid results ebook with the product.  I was able to receive this for free and this is my honest and unbiased review.</li>
    <li> Using this product without lotion or soap will rip your skin off.</li>
    <li> Great tool to massage cellulite. Easy to use in the shower.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about a week and I&#x27;m not ready to give it five stars yet as lets be honest...cellulite takes a while to go way if ever. I use it in the shower when I&#x27;m all soaped up on my legs and arms and then again when I apply lotion.  It definitely gets the blood flowing in these areas. It&#x27;s easy to use but it&#x27;s still too early to tell if its going to work or not.  Will update soon...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did receive as a free item during a promotion the company held for an honest review.</li>
    <li> Not what I thought - it is very hard and does not feel good at all.</li>
    <li> Good for circular motion on scalp without pulling hair like rollers do. If hair is thick, better to do when in tub when hair is wet and flat.</li>
    <li> 2 cheap pieces of plastic that would not stay together. returned it</li>
    <li> Using this brush for over two months haven&#x27;t seen any improvements as yet but I will continue using it as it massages so good</li>
    <li> Honestly I don&#x27;t use it regularly to notice a difference in my skin ,, but I recommend it because it feels really good when use it for massage , reduce the stress and soften the skin</li>
    <li> Great quality product, just started using this and can see it is a simple, yet effective way to increase blood circulation to those &#x27;troublesome areas&#x27; ahem aka ones thighs and butt! Glides easily over the skin when used with soap.</li>
    <li> Nice item. It feels good as a massager.</li>
    <li> I tried the anti cellulite massager without expecting too much since I have been disappointed by other products in the past. I immediately liked the way it fit snugly in my palm and it looked good. After using it daily in the shower for the past few weeks I admit that the cellulite on my thighs is becoming less noticeable and the skin appears firmer and smoother. I will continue using it since I like the massagy feeling.</li>
    <li> So far I really like it. I use it with lotion after the shower</li>
    <li> I LOVE this Cellulite Massager/Head, Hair Massager Brush!&lt;br /&gt;My had fits perfectly between the handle and around the brush making for a very tight grip.&lt;br /&gt;I have only recently received my order, so I cannot speak to the benefits of removing cellulite, but I can say this brush gives a wonderful scalp and body massage!&lt;br /&gt;The soft, raised rubber points provide wonderful stimulation without tangling my hair or scratching my skin.  Exfoliates the skin and is easy to clean off dead skin in warm soapy water.&lt;br /&gt;Jager Online provided super fast shipping and wonderful order follow up.&lt;br /&gt;Highly Recommend to anyone seeking a well made dual purpose massage brush.&lt;br /&gt;I received this product in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using for over two weeks and I do see improvement in my skin, you really have to make some pressure and keep doing it while it is confortable with your skin of course, if you use it without pressure, not daily, not at least a minute per zone, you wont see changes!! believe me it works but you have to do it right, btw bruises sometimes are normal, the skin will get used to the pressure and it will be fine :)</li>
    <li> I like this massage brush.  Feels like I am increasing circulation when I use it.  I can&#x27;t give it a five star yet because I can&#x27;t attest to whether or not it actually helps with the cellulite..  I am doing one leg as a test and will be back to change it to a five star if it shows visible differences!  But meanwhile it does feel like it helps &amp;#34;liven&amp;#34; up my skin!</li>
    <li> I use this almost every day on my thighs... has not made any visible difference to my cellulite at all.</li>
    <li> I have been using this massager in the shower with Finulite cellulite soap and then finishing off with Naturalico cellulite cream after my shower and I am happy to say there has been a very noticeable decrease in the rippley look of my thighs. I will continue to use this product as well as the others. The massager has a nice design to fit my hand without flying all over the place when soapy.</li>
    <li> I thought it vibrated. It doesn&#x27;t</li>
    <li> The two pieces broke apart the second time I used it and I have incredible difficulty reconnecting. Once I did, it disconnected yet again.</li>
    <li> I purchased this for a friend and she loves it. I have a virtually identical product made by Methode Jeanne Piaubert that retails for four times the cost. Galenic/Elancyl also has a similar massager,  also at four times the price. This is an excellent product at a great price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In addition to cellulite reduction,  this massager will help the skin retain it&#x27;s firmness and elasticity during, and after, weight loss. It&#x27;s best used in the shower with a good quality firming shower gel. Just rinse off the soap for easy clean-up. (You can also use it to massage in body cream or oil but then you need to wash the massager thoroughly. I usually apply creams after showering. )</li>
    <li> just started using it.</li>
    <li> I just recently received this product, and I haven&#x27;t been using it long enough to give it a full review.</li>
    <li> Use it in the shower all over body. Works great.</li>
    <li> Opens but don&#x27;t know why. Used it a few times but feel/saw nothing. Just not what I expected at all.</li>
    <li> I just love the invigorating way my body feels after using this cellulite massager and the quality is exceptionally good. ALSO a lifetime guarantee!! I highly recommend this massager to anyone who needs to reduce cellulite and increase blood circulation to selected parts of your body.</li>
    <li> Great little gadget.  I use it while sitting in my infra-red sauna and in the shower.</li>
    <li> Its very nice one. I have just started using it couple if days ago so it would be hard to tell its effect but i feel it may have a good result coz when i use it i feel it makes my skin more firm.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product, I noticed instant results! I&#x27;m a fairly fit person, but have always struggled with a cellulite patch right under my bum... So I decided to purchase this product. So worth the purchase! I recommend applying coconut oil before using this brush though, it makes it easier to use. I highly recommend to anyone with stubborn cellulite:)</li>
    <li> The item seems to work well but to be honest I have not noticed a reduction in my cellulite, then again I never really took much note of it at all to begin with, and what I have doesn&#x27;t really bother me. I will say that using this item is relaxing experience though, and I enjoy it being used on every inch of my body just as a massager.</li>
    <li> i&#x27;ve been using it for 2 weeks and i see no change at all</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t seen results get but I use it every shower.</li>
    <li> Spring is here, so you know what that means! Have to get in shape for summer! This Cellulite Massager works very well. I have already had success with it. I use it when I’m in the shower by rolling it over my legs. I can report that with regular use it is working! My legs are looking firmer and smoother!</li>
    <li> It’s a great product. Works well and easy to use.</li>
    <li> What a massager it is!!! Its simply wonderful. I feel my head rested and massaged overtime I use.</li>
