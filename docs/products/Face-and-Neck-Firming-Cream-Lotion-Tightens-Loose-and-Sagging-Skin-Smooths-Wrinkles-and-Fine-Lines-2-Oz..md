<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Great stuff.  Seems to give my face a bit of a pick me up.  Smells nice too.</li>
    <li> I LOVE it!  I&#x27;ve been using a very similar product, but like that this one seems to have a bit more firming effect.  I&#x27;m so glad I found it on Amazon....thank you!</li>
    <li> This is a good value. The skin on my neck is very sun damaged and this has definitely made it look better. More hydrated, less visible discoloration in about 3 weeks of use. I&#x27;m not sure that it&#x27;s quite as good as Strivectin&#x27;s product for this area, but nor is it nearly as expensive.</li>
    <li> EXTREMELY HAPPY! I spend a ton of money on products and I am constantly trying new ones.  THIS IS THE ONLY product that I&#x27;ve notice a difference with!  I use this on my neck and on my belly button (I had lose/wrinkled skin from having a baby) and I cannot believe the difference.  I&#x27;ve probably been using it for two weeks at the most.  Will DEFINITELY buy again!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this at night in case I have an adverse reaction to it. So far, none. No redness, no irritation and my skin does feel smoother and softer. The only thing I don&#x27;t like is the slightly unpleasant smell. It&#x27;s not so bad that it will make me stop using but it is still noticeable.</li>
    <li> This is a great product. When previously reviewed I was mistaking it for another product I had ordered.  This Neck Firming cream is a good buy.</li>
    <li> No irritation on my sensitive skin. Glides on smoothly. Slight aroma but goes away quickly. Not sure of major differences but there is some tightness on skin quite immediately. Not sure if I would purchase again just yet.</li>
    <li> It might work for you, but for me nahhh doesnot deliver</li>
    <li> At 44, the aging process is well on its way. With that said, I am always on the lookout for affordable, effective products that will slow said process down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I stopped using my usual moisturizer for the 5 days I&#x27;ve had this-there has been a noticeable reduction in the fine lines/crow&#x27;s feet around my eyes and the deeper lines on my neck-so much so that my other half actually noticed and mentioned it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The feel is light, it absorbs very well and quickly, and the fragrance is very pleasant/not overpowering. It is also safe for all skin types.</li>
    <li> As age comes, wrinkles pop up like no other, I have focused on my face but never thought of taking care of my neck. After noticing my neck showing wrinkles I had to find a cream that is soothing and also not so strong to my sensitive skin. I have tried many different brands, they either made my skin break out or it never really helped my wrinkles go away. This cream is perfect for my skin, it has not irritated my skin and the cream absorbs leaving no residue. I have noticed my skin softer and smoother. I will be getting this again and also giving this cream out as a gift to all my ladies in my life. This is a great cream to have in your beauty collection.</li>
    <li> I do not like the smell but it seems to be working.</li>
    <li> Really fast delivery and just what I wanted!! Thank you for making great products like this  this affordable and for such superior service!!!</li>
    <li> It seems to moisturize well in this dry winter air.  But, I haven&#x27;t noticed a difference in my wrinkles.  I&#x27;m 37 and I am trying to slow down the aging process a bit. I&#x27;ve been using it for a month.</li>
    <li> I started using the Keshima Face &amp; Neck Firming as soon as I received it, which was about 5 days ago.  I used it morning &amp; night, and I can very honestly say, that so far, it is absolutely the best face &amp; neck cream I have ever used!!  It has a nice clean smell, it goes on smoothly, it&#x27;s not at all sticky, as some creams tend to be, easy to blend, and a little goes a long way!!  And the price is unbelieveable for the quality of this product!!  I have paid much more for products that could not compare to Keshima, and I say this in all honesty.  I&#x27;m 73 yrs old, and I know a good face cream when I use it!!  I love, love it, and will purchase this face cream again!!  Thank You, Keshima,  N. McTeague</li>
    <li> I adore this product! Everything about it.. Scent, texture, results! I want more!</li>
    <li> I like this product a lot!  It absorbs very well and smells clean.   I have really sensitive skin and I have to be careful what I use on it, and this product works better (and is easier on my skin) than some much more expensive ones I&#x27;ve tried.  I will buy again and again.</li>
    <li> I liked the way it made my skin feel tighter, but the wrinkles were still visible.  I also was glad that they stick by their promise to refund if not completely satisfied and were checking on my progress while I was using the cream.</li>
    <li> Love this product will order agsin</li>
    <li> I can feel the tightening effect and it is not at all greasy. However, it sometimes does not absorb well if not rubbed in quickly.</li>
    <li> Love it! I&#x27;ve tried everything...L&#x27; Oreal Revitalift, Olay Regeneritst, Pro X to name a few and did not receive the results that I have with Keshima. My face glows, looks and feels firmer. The scent and packaging are wonderful.  Placing my second order!</li>
    <li> I really like it very smooth on my face..I think I can get it more thanks...</li>
    <li> Ok ladies and gentlemen let me first just say I am in my 50&#x27;s, have taken good care of my face, butttttttttttttttttttt started to notice the creepiness right in front of my neck, even when I swallowed, talked, etc....  I have used and done EVERYTHING even Dr. Perricone&#x27;s sub cold &amp;#34;D&amp;#34; , Algenist, facial exercises for the neck, etc.... and to no avail.  I found this cream and said what the heck let me try this since the price was very good, especially compared to Dr. Perricone&#x27;s which is over $100, and Algenist at $84.  Ok first day nothing really, 2nd day I literally yelled out OMG!!!!!!  THE CREEPINESS WAS GONE!!!!!!!  I THOUGHT I WAS SEEING THINGS, HAD TO CHECK OUT MY NECK IN THREE DIFFERENT MIRRORS.  So it definitely has worked for me.  I pump three times and put the cream on morning and night, and I apply just like how Dr. Perricone instructs you to put on his cream, in an upward motion, starting at the bottom of the neck, all the way up to the chin, behind the ears, and slightly behind the neck.  I will continue to use this as long as it works, ingredients stay the same, etc...., and as always some things may work for others, and may not work for the next person, but has most definitely worked for me.  Now let&#x27;s see if Keshima can keep it at this wonderful price.</li>
    <li> Prior reviews helpful and accurate</li>
    <li> I have been using this product along with the eye cream for about 2 weeks and I see significant change.  My face and neck are a lot firmer and do not see as many winkles on my neck.  I will definitely keep using this product.</li>
    <li> This is great and the eye cream is too!!!!</li>
    <li> I see a little change but not much. It hasn&#x27;t done much for the sagging skin on neck but my complexion does look better which is a good thing. I am hoping over time will see more improvement.</li>
    <li> Smells great- a nice lemongrass lavender combo. Goes on nice and smooth. It&#x27;s not greasy at all. Hopefully I&#x27;ll see nice results!</li>
    <li> I had been using a different firming cream when I read the reviews on the Keshima.  I wanted a product that would help with fading dark/age spots in addition to firming.  This product works well.  I am beginning to see fading of age/dark spots after two weeks of use.  The firming part works well.  I think the reviewers seeing significant change in only a few days probably were not using a different product prior to beginning the Keshima cream.  I will definitely reorder.  Some people complained about the smell I was pleased it has a citrus scent, so much better than the other product I was using.  I think any firming cream that is effective has some type of scent.  This one is not offensive maybe because I find citrus pleasant.  Great value for how well it works.</li>
    <li> I just returned from a visit with my daughter who lives out of state. After 2 days we were having breakfast and she said &amp;#34;Mom, I don&#x27;t know what it is but your skin looks great. It&#x27;s hard to describe, it looks lifted, tighter. Not sure but just great. What are you doing?&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;I told her about Keshima and thought &amp;#34;Oooo must be working!!!&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;Keeping up with it for sure.</li>
    <li> Love the texture and very hydrating. looking forward to seeing the result</li>
    <li> Mrs. William C using product: It&#x27;s nice but hasn&#x27;t helped my crepe-y neck problem. Guess I&#x27;m too far gone. The sales person was really nice, though, when she contacted me to find out how I liked the product early on. By then I had only used it for a week or so. Now it&#x27;s been several months and still no improvement.--The product was shipped and received quickly.</li>
    <li> it didn&#x27;t tighten the way it was hyped to do,</li>
    <li> Used this cream for a month and did see some change in my neck firmness. Most of the cream is absorbed when applied but still feels a little greasy. It probably varies from skin type to skin type. (I have combination)</li>
    <li> It is a wonderful product. I highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> have not used long enough to determine if it will work or not.</li>
    <li> This is a new product for me and I&#x27;ve really loved it - it is fabulous for the neck.</li>
    <li> I love the smell of this cream!  It feels great when on because it is not greasy at all.  It feels as if it completely gets obsorbed as there is no shine left on skin yet the skin no longers feels tight/dry.</li>
    <li> I have seen very promising results with this neck and face cream. Skin is smoother and more radiant. It is not going into the jars of face cream graveyard.  I&#x27;m going to order a second one which rarely happens.</li>
    <li> It only takes a small amount and you can feel your skin tighten immediately.  After using this product for 2 months now i definitely see a difference in my neck and jawline.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical as this is new and SO many products promise to firm aging skin, so few deliver.  This one does a fairly good job I have to say.  I&#x27;m 60 with a wrinkled neck from decades of sunning, and it does help.  You have to use it for a while to see the results though.  Might reorder it..</li>
    <li> This product is great. It firmed my skin in a matter of 2-3 days. It also makes my skin seem much brighter with less wrinkles.</li>
    <li> This cream instantly changed my skin. It smooths, softens and tightens the pores. It takes the place of age -reducing cream and those &#x27; magic blur&#x27; creams that soften the look of your complexion. If you want plumper, softer, younger -looking skin, I recommend Keshima.</li>
    <li> I really like the mild scent it has and the creamy texture.  It isn&#x27;t heavy&lt;br /&gt;like some can be.  In the month I have had it, I have noticed less wrinkles&lt;br /&gt;and softer skin.  I really like the product.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product! I saw a difference after just a couple of uses, and the price is awesome! This product works much better than a cream I was using that cost 4 times as much, I will definitely be ordering it again!</li>
    <li> This product really works . I have used many high end products that has never worked -- this one is great value for money</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s okay but I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
    <li> Love the way my skin feels after using this. Great fragrance too! Haven&#x27;t been using it long enough to say it is helping to firm my neck but I really like this cream! Love the bottle too!</li>
    <li> I like the results I&#x27;m getting. Face and neck look firmer. The smell is not as pleasant as I would have expected</li>
    <li> love love love. Smells great and works great too!!</li>
    <li> did not see much difference from regular creams I use</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed improvement on my neck , yet. The price is OK.</li>
    <li> I waited to respond because I wanted to try the product and have a truer sense of the value.  Bottom line, I really love it!  I do see a difference in the time I have been using it and have urged others to try it as well.  It&#x27;s so rare that a product actually lives up to it&#x27;s claims and Keshima Face and Neck Firming Cream absolutely does.  I will reorder soon!</li>
    <li> Tonight trying it for the first time!  Stay tuned!</li>
    <li> This is a really nice serum. I noticed a difference after just a couple days.</li>
    <li> I have only used it for a couple of days now. I have only bought one neck cream from neutrogena and was not pleased. This one I am hopeful for. I did a couple of years of back to back tanning in a tanning bed and I have creases on my chest and neck. So far I like the product. Its lightweight and does not leave a build up on residue like my other one did. I am going to have to edit this when I try it for alot longer.</li>
    <li> I have been using this neck cream for 2 weeks now. I see an improvement in my neck. The lines are not as noticeable. This cream makes you face and neck so soft.</li>
    <li> I love this product!  Good texture!  Good scents! My neck area feels moisturized, smooth and firm.  Will reorder.</li>
    <li> Fabulously creamy, zesty smelling and it works to peel off the layers of old skin without making you red.  I&#x27;d put this up there with Rhonda Alison, which is three times the price and does and equally good job.  I think they are offering an amazing product at a wholesale price. I do use three or four squirts, so two bottles will be better for a month than one.  I have a big face!  Excellent product.</li>
    <li> Personally, I prefer using anti-aging products right now to prevent fine lines, wrinkles and all the fun stuff that comes with aging. I bought this neck firming cream while it was on promotion to try it out for myself and to express my unbiased opinion based on what the cream did for me. I am one of those people who usually focus on my face and not too much on my neck (yes, bad habit lol); well at least I put sunscreen on my neck :) Anyway, I have been using this religiously for about two weeks now (I only use it on my neck) and I have noticed a slight improvement on my neck as far as moisturizing my neck. I have about two fine lines (running horizontally) on my neck and it&#x27;s gradually helping with improving the appearance of these lines. I am also incorporating some neck exercises which helps with these lines so hopefully this will go away soon lol. I really have not noticed these lines until I got pregnant and they were just screaming at me every time I looked at the mirror. Now I just want them to go back to where they came from. Overall, this is a great product ladies and gents and please have REALISTIC expectations and don&#x27;t expect it to work overnight.</li>
    <li> So far I am extremely pleased with this product.  I see a noticeable difference in the fine lines around my eyes and mouth.  Will definitely order again.  So happy I discovered you.</li>
    <li> So far I have been using this product with no problems. I have not noticed much of a difference in my skin yet but it smells good and I do not break out, which is something. The only problem I have is that it is a little to greasy for day time use. Perfect for a night cream though.</li>
    <li> smells amazing and in one week I have noticed firming. awesome product and great price.</li>
    <li> The KESHIMA Ultimate Anti Aging Firming Lotion for Face &amp; Neck is one of the best  cream - lotion I have ever used.  I have found that Face and Neck lotions are either heavy, sticky yet this lotion is very light, The bottle and  box are both very nice and thats very good.  I just love this cream.&lt;br /&gt;I have noticed my face and neck much firmed after only a couple of weeks.</li>
    <li> Saw no change in skin at all.</li>
    <li> This cream really works!  I turned 50 last year and while my face is pretty wrinkle free the neck is another story.  I don&#x27;t have deep lines in the neck area but my neck is thin and the saggy skin under chin and around jawline was really starting to bother me.  I apply this cream morning and night to neck area only..  You can actually feel it tightening seconds after you apply.  I&#x27;m very happy with the results.  The price sold me on ordering this product through Amazon and I&#x27;m so glad I did!  I will definitely be reordering! :)</li>
    <li> This is an interesting product I must say. I tried it because I wanted to get rid of the neck lines that are forming even though I&#x27;m only 30.&lt;br /&gt;The fragrance is good and it is very lightweight, It has been 2 weeks now, and I&#x27;m still using to see if there will be any major improvement on my neck lines. I did feel that the skin on my face and neck got tighter after applying the moisturizer but yet to see the neck lines disappearing.</li>
    <li> Love how this makes my face feel.</li>
    <li> The cream didn&#x27;t help with firm my neck.</li>
    <li> After I apply this cream leaves my skin very soft, smooth feels hydrated.</li>
    <li> Firming along my jaw area was barely noticeable. I have minor jowls that I hoped would be improved with this cream but was disappointed. Would not order again.</li>
    <li> I dont normally take the time to write reveiws, but this time i had to.  AlI can say is WOW!!!  Seeing is believing!  I have not even used this stuff for a week and what a difference i see. I think i just found my new face cream!</li>
    <li> Adds a large amount of elasticity and moisture to dry, crepey areas of the face and neck.  Well absorbed.</li>
    <li> Parts of my skin had dry patches that nothing seemed to help and within three days of using this, my dry patches are gone and my skin feels firm and soft.  Thank you for a product that makes a difference!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for about two months now and cannot tell any difference in my skin. I like the texture of the creme. It does not leave a greasy after film, or stickiness (I have combination skin). I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll be buying it again as I really can&#x27;t tell any difference from before I started using it. Hope in a bottle?  I gave the product 3 stars as an overall rating, it wouldn&#x27;t get any if it was based on effectiveness.</li>
    <li> This one is the good one...does work good must use daily...</li>
    <li> I am a natural skeptic, so I was thinking I would most likely be in the group of people that this didn&#x27;t work for. I didn&#x27;t mind the lemony smell, which I was worried about because of the negative reviews and I am often sensitive to smells. To me it just smells like a lemon &#x27;clean&#x27; smell. But my huge surprise was that the very first time I put this on my neck I could instantly feel something happening. I did not expect it at ALL! This is only day 2 and I honestly wish I would have taken some &#x27;before&#x27; pictures of my neck, because I really think this is seriously working.</li>
    <li> Have been uusing for a week or so and have not noticed any difference</li>
    <li> So far this is doing a great job.</li>
    <li> I recently started losing weight after being overweight most of my life. I have started to notice that I am getting a lot of loose skin on my face and neck and was really getting self conscious about my looks. I started using the Neck Firming Cream by KESHIMA a few weeks ago and I am really liking the results. My skin is starting to look really good. I have noticed that it is better hydrated and not flaky like it use to be. My face looks healthier and I am starting to notice that the skin is not as loose as it was when I started using this cream. I&#x27;m so grateful that I was able to purchase this at a discount in order to try it out and share my experience with it.</li>
    <li> Did nothing for me at ALL... Big waste of money</li>
    <li> So far, I really like this. It seems to work quickly on my dry skin, and isn&#x27;t greasy like some tightening lotions. The scent is herbal - it smells like Lemon Verbena, which I like but some might not love. (Go smell some lemon verbena before you buy it and you&#x27;ll get the idea.) Have used it side by side with Strivectin, and get similar results at a much lower cost. On my second bottle now, and anticipate buying it again.</li>
    <li> Great product for the price. I&#x27;ve tried lots of expensive products that didn&#x27;t work as well. Leaves my face and neck hydrated not oily. Doesn&#x27;t break me out like most products and my makeup goes on smooth.</li>
    <li> I enjoy using this firming cream very much. ­ it¹s doing a good job for me.  Nice, pleasant scent and good consistency, not too thin and not too thick.  Very soothing to use and provides a great result.</li>
    <li> Decent moisturizer, but I didn&#x27;t notice any firming</li>
    <li> Saw results immediately! Loved it! Will say that after about 4 hrs results started to fade</li>
    <li> It is okay because it&#x27;s easy to use and you get alot. Maybe I haven&#x27;t used it long enough.</li>
    <li> I do like the feel and scent of this cream.  I&#x27;m not sure it is firming anything but it feels good to use and so I like it.  Probably wouldn&#x27;t buy it again over another cream, unless I see amazing results in the next week or two. :)  But, as I said it feels good and my skin is very soft and smooth...I suspect it does a bit of plumping and that is not such a bad thing.</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure about this product, because it seemed inexpensive compared to some of the other firming creams, but, I have to say, after using it for about 3 weeks, I really believe it is working!!  The lines on my face seem much less pronounced, and my jowls, not horrible yet, but just starting to &amp;#34;grow,&amp;#34; truly seem to be reduced in size.  The scent is a very light lemon, which I find very nice, and, so far, it is not at all offensive to my coworkers, either.  I am hoping for even better results over the next couple of weeks.  Give it a try!!</li>
    <li> Still using - can&#x27;t determine results yet.</li>
    <li> I love the way it feels on my face and neck, and it makes my skin look younger</li>
    <li> product is great - been using it about 2 weeks now; dispenses nice amount of product; makes my skin look dewey, fresh, and youthful, and I&#x27;m 67 yo!!!</li>
    <li> Just had to write a review to tell how much I like this product.  First thing I noticed was the lemon smell, oh so clean smelling.  I have crinkly cheek skin and after applying the lotion for a week, I am noticing a major difference.  I will definitely purchase this again.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my wife... And she absolutely loves it! Couldn&#x27;t believe how fast and how quick it worked!!</li>
    <li> I used this on my face and neck for about three weeks now, the only thing I noticed was that it consistently made my face very shiny, which I didn&#x27;t like, so now I just use it on my neck, only.</li>
    <li> Definitely worth the money! I started seeing a lot of very fine wrinkles on my neck and was looking for a cream to help smooth them out a bit. This product had great reviews, so I decided to give it a shot. I&#x27;ve been using the cream for about a week now, morning and night, and can definitely see the difference already! The wrinkles are much softer and much less defined than they were before! Exactly the effect I was looking for! Great product! I would definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> I love it!  I have only been using it about three days now but the results on my neck are amazing.  I&#x27;m 51 and my face still looks good by my neck was really sagging. I was thinking I&#x27;d either have to live with it or get a neck lift.  Your product has been an amazing transformation.  I feel,like my self again when I look in the mirror!  TY</li>
    <li> excelent product ,I really recomend it. I fell mi skin smooth and tight</li>
    <li> This really works! I just ordered it again..and I have tried many creams before. .This is the best result I have ever had, hands down. LISA, Washington DC</li>
    <li> I am 67 years old and started using the Keshma Face and Neck Firming Cream twice a day since I received it on August 3, 2015.  The product does exactly what it promises to do.  It has really helped to firm up my neck and face, especially my neck.  I don&#x27;t have the sagging skin that we women get as we age.  I will purchase this product again.</li>
    <li> I just started using it.  I like the fact that you can use on your face and eyes, you don&#x27;t have to buy eye cream, saves money.</li>
    <li> I really like this cream.  In all frankness, I don&#x27;t really notice any difference in &amp;#34;firmness&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;wrinkles&amp;#34; with any cream, including this one.  But my skin feels very moisturized from this cream (which I am using as a face/neck cream during the day).  I also find the scent very pleasant.  Obviously, that&#x27;s a matter of preference, but I like it -- it is somewhat gingery.  I am someone who frequently buys much more expensive creams.  While I would not compare this to the creams that contain Retin-A or acids, I think this is very good as a regular moisturizer, and very well priced.</li>
    <li> Great consistency and seems to actually be tightening my skin!</li>
    <li> Have been using this product for  almost 2 months as directed.  No difference before/after.  Did not work for me at all.  I gave it 2 stars because it does smell nice and very easy to apply.</li>
    <li> I love this cream!!!  I have received so many compliments on how I look since I&#x27;ve started using this cream.  I will definitely be ordering more.</li>
    <li> I have only used this a few times since receiving it but I totally think it is working.  At the very least my skin feels better. edited to update now that I have used a bit more.  This is pretty amazing cream!  My skin looks fresher and more youthful.  I would highly recommend this to anyone one.</li>
    <li> Have been using this product for a few days now and I really like it.  I have sensitive skin and this product does not irritate it.  My skin feels much more hydrated, softer and smoother.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product in the morning and at nighttime, primarily on the neck area. I noticed a positive difference immediately.  The wrinkles have diminished and my neck area looks much firmer.  I also like the fact that the cream lasts all day long. This is the first product that I have bought that has given me positive results.</li>
    <li> Keshima Face &amp; Neck Firming Cream is a wonderful product!  Love it!</li>
    <li> Awesome product!  Seeing results already, and it&#x27;s been a week. Thank you for the opportunity to try and review this product.  Will buy again!</li>
    <li> While it goes on silky &amp; it has a pleasant smell to it, the verdict is still out on its effectiveness...nothing has changed. I only use it on my neck, which is my concern. Most of these creams that claim to work don&#x27;t. While I&#x27;m not optimistic, I will give it 4 weeks (as was suggested) or until I run out. I may or may not change my review.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing, after arriving on time and as expected I started using this product and I saw a difference in only 4 days. I am 69 years old but was blessed with good skin, i had started noticing fine lines around my chin area. After using this and I know this is hard to believe but they are less noticeable. This is an amazing product, I love the pump dispenser. I have to be very careful with any new product because they usually break my sensitive skin out, but this product has not. I use it morning and night and I have very dry skin, but my skin feels very good in the morning not dry at all. I will update this review after  using it for 4 weeks, I will be trying other products by this company.</li>
    <li> Been using for ten days cansee noticeable difference in lines on forehead and puffiness under eyes</li>
    <li> This is the best cream I have ever used!  It has a wonderful smell.  It makes my face feel so fresh and clean!  I would highly recommend this product to anyone that want to try something new!  Thank you for such a good product!</li>
    <li> No change that I can see, still using everyday...</li>
    <li> I clearly see more firmness in my face. I believe that it also tightens my neck to a point, but at 58 I think the neck just won&#x27;t look like at 40 anymore. Overall, great product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used it for a while now, it&#x27;s okay on my face but didn&#x27;t make any difference on the neck.</li>
    <li> I like how it feels and my skin feel tighter</li>
    <li> I like the company, and the product seems to help my skin.</li>
    <li> This cream goes on clean, has a nice light scent and has really helped with firming my neck skin.</li>
    <li> I love this Face &amp; Neck Firming Cream made by Keshima. The bottle is very nice and expensive looking. It has a pump style top which is much more sanitary than dipping your fingers into the bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cream itself goes onto my face smoothly and soaks in quickly. It doesn&#x27;t leave behind any sticky or greasy residue. This cream also doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin. I haven&#x27;t had any breakouts or itchiness since using this firming cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this product for 5 days now and my skin definitely feels tighter and smoother. I feel like the small lines around my eyes do look less noticeable. My skin feels soft and moisturized.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very impressed with this firming cream. Although I did received this cream at a promotional rate; this review is based 100% on my own experience with this product.</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t given it a chance to really work but so far it good</li>
    <li> This serum seems to be superior to other products I&#x27;ve purchased. It makes my face feels smooth. It seems to be helping to lesson dark circles about my eyes. I can feel the tightening as soon as it is applied. I&#x27;m very happy with the product.</li>
    <li> I really like this cream and just ordered another one.  I love the fantastic smell - for a busy mother like me it feels like being in a Spa for a few seconds after the application. I use it more as a preventive measure, therefore, I cannot say much about the firming effect. But the skin looks very radiant after the application in the morning, which is a big plus.</li>
    <li> This cream has become a staple in my skin care regimen.  It goes on smoothly and absorbs quickly.  It does smooth and tighten the skin as stated, especially effective. In the neck area.  Doesn&#x27;t flake off like some serums do and you can use it alone or with an additional moisturizer if you need your moisturizer before applying make-up.  Sometimes I use some moisturizer and sometimes I don&#x27;t but it works both ways.  What I like most about this product is that I can trust it to work.  It leaves no skin irritation at all.  I would recommend it to friends without hesitation.</li>
    <li> My skin is very sensitive and I was afraid I may have a  break out but I am very excited my face accepted new face cream. I love that my skin looks healthy. I will buy again.</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t seen any improvement.</li>
    <li> So far, love the product. Have not used it long enough to notice a difference. Had a very polite email from the seller.</li>
    <li> I have used medium to high end and never finished  product..... no matter what mirror  I look into there is a definate change...firmer.....softer and diminished lines....I was not paid to write this review I did because every women should be the best she can be..thank you AMAZON and the staff who created this quality product at  Reasonable price And 100% results....3 pumps start at neck with upward motions to forehead...10 days you will see results!!!!</li>
    <li> This is probably the best face cream I have ever used.  My skin has not felt this good in years.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t used this long enough to know whether or not it firms anything up but it does smell nice &amp; most importantly I can wear it under my makeup.  :)  I do like it &amp; not every lotion works well before applying makeup.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried many products to help my skin without results.  I&#x27;m very satisfied with Keshima Face &amp; Neck Firming Cream, and have just ordered another one, which is rare for me!</li>
    <li> Happy! I definitely see a difference!</li>
    <li> Leaves my skin really soft and lasts all day. Do not expose your skin to the sun when wearing.</li>
    <li> I have only been using this a short time, but I like the cream very much makes my skin soft, and takes the edge off my wrinkles.</li>
    <li> I started using this product on July 8 and have not noticed any change. Hopefully, I will see some improvement in the next couple of weeks.  Update: It&#x27;s been 2 months of use as instructed. I&#x27;m sorry to report that are no positive results. The face cream smells good though. :)</li>
    <li> Two stars because I aint seen nothing yet. Waiting. I have been using it for a month.</li>
    <li> i love this product. I&#x27;ve only been using this for less than a week and so far I&#x27;m loving it. It&#x27;s not sticky which I love. I love the smell too. But because of the little time that I have been using it that&#x27;s why I only give 4 stars. I can&#x27;t wait to see how effective it is in a few weeks so I can write another review. But overall I do recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I waited to post a comment because I wanted to see how this product would work first. I definitely noticed an improvement on my neck. Will order it again.</li>
    <li> Absolutely terrible.  Does nothing.</li>
    <li> I bought this at a reduced price and asked to do a review. I have tried this and really love it so far after a couple weeks&#x27; use.  I do feel like I can see a difference in the skin/wrinkles on my neck.  So far, so good.  My skin just looks healthier and &amp;#34;plumper&amp;#34;/nourished overall.  I just might be hooked!  Thumbs up!</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t really tell how much firming it&#x27;s doing bt so far it doesn&#x27;t break me out like a lot of other lotions &amp; moisturizers. I would buy it again.</li>
    <li> This face cream is awesome.  I have used several face and neck firming creams but this one is outstanding.  I have been using it for approximately two weeks and I am seeing results in regards to firmness.  This cream has a light, pleasant fragrance.  I will definitely purchase this product again.</li>
    <li> I love the product but not the inner pump because it fell off in to the bottle. It does have a nice fresh lemon scent as others have said. It instantly absorbs and feels wonderful. But about the lifting effect,,, I think at this point I need a crane. Too much to expect from anything that comes in the form of cream, oils , serums or what ever. Surgery on my horizon. No wrinkle problems per say, just look like my skin is sliding down my skull.</li>
    <li> Not sure if it&#x27;s working but it smells really good.</li>
    <li> The product is smooth and a nice fragrance. Too soon to tell if it is helpful.</li>
    <li> So far I have been using this product and I like it.  My face is very sensitive to face products and I find this very gentle on my skin.  It is light weight and not greasy.  I like it!</li>
    <li> It was okay - didn&#x27;t noticeably tighten. I ordered crepe erase instead and like it better so far.</li>
    <li> it is a very nice cream and the smell is nice</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t get it. Bought this because of great reviews, used it for several weeks, and it did nothing for me. Also, it&#x27;s too goopy.</li>
    <li> Was with some old friends this weekend and one of them remarked that I was looking younger!!!! I will be continuing to use this product! It is very non greasy and absorbs into the skin so well.</li>
    <li> Love this on my neck! No greasy feeling from it! Light and pleasant smell.</li>
    <li> have not seen noticeable firming but it has only been a week,  the one thing I DO notice is that about 5 minutes after I put it on, my face is dredged in sweat, and I mean dripping sweat!. It draws out fluids like unreal!</li>
    <li> just got it took awhile to get this product so can&#x27;t review yet</li>
    <li> It has helped my turkey neck quite a bit</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t really notice anything.  It goes on nice.  Not a fan of the scent.  Will use it up to give it a fair chance.</li>
    <li> this is a great lotion.</li>
    <li> I really believe this is a good product as I have seen great results.  However for me it made my skin break out but I do have very sensitive skin.  But I want to say that the owner of this product contacted me several days after I had been using this and I told her my issue.  Today I got an email for a full refund.  I could not believe it.  I did not ask for it or indicate that I would like one.  Things happen and my skin just happened to be to sensitive even though I did start to  notice a difference.  It is SO nice to deal with a wonderful seller like this.  I would highly recommend any product she sales not only because its probably a good product but because she is an honest and wonderful business woman and we need more like her!  Thank you so much Myriam, KESHIMA.  You rock!</li>
    <li> You will truely notice a difference in your face and neck in a matter of a couple days.  I am 62 and I take good care of my skin. However I was searching for a product that firmed the face and neck. I will buy Keshima firming cream again. If you are looking for a firming cream you should try this product. Mary M.</li>
    <li> buy it!  It is a good product. I can even put it on my eyes</li>
    <li> Great product very satisfied with the purchase</li>
    <li> Not sure how much tightening is going on but my skin looks healthier and younger.  Noticed it right away on my chest area and my make-up looks better.  A little heavy for my combination skin, but I use it on my jaw area and lower cheek, neck and chest.  Wish I could use this on my whole body!  56 year old skin looks much better and I will be buying more.</li>
    <li> Been using this product for 1 week,  and I do not like the smell of it(smells like medicine).  Do not like anything about it so far.  Have not seen any good results.</li>
    <li> I DO love this product!  It&#x27;s made such a difference in my skin.  I&#x27;ve been using it twice a day for about 3 weeks now and have seen so much improvement.  I&#x27;m 66 years old though and am having some issues with the sagging skin on the neck and developing &amp;#34;jowls&amp;#34;.  I&#x27;m not sure much can be done to correct that beyond surgery but I&#x27;m still hopeful I will continue to see improvement.</li>
    <li> Did not work for me. Caused a red rash. I purchased it due to all the good reviews, but I had a different experience with this lotion.  Returned for a refund.</li>
    <li> Noticeable improvement within a week. Now on my third one and apply 2x daily. Just need 3 dabs on finger tip for face &amp; neck!</li>
    <li> I have been using this as directed, have seen no noticible change in my skin. I don&#x27;t like the fact it has no sun sceen in it, so maybe because I have to put other product on top is affecting its benefits. I likely won&#x27;t reorder it. I do love the smell though.</li>
    <li> I have only had this for a few days but I&#x27;ve been using it every day and so far I like it.</li>
    <li> Dont know yet. Ill let you know. Update.  I have used as directed two months now and have not seen ANY improvement. Save tour money this product does not work as claimed.</li>
    <li> Too early to tell.  So far I see no results, but have only been using it less than a week.  Was told to give it 4 weeks so this is what I will do.  I&#x27;ll be back with my comments re: results.</li>
    <li> hasn&#x27;t done a thing for me doesn&#x27;t firm my neck and I&#x27;ve used it the way the instructions said</li>
    <li> Wife likes it very much. Makes her skin feel firm. She says it has a strong lemony scent that&#x27;s not bad but just a little overpowering.</li>
    <li> I love the feel of my face and neck! I have been using this for the past 5 days, and my face and neck are so smooth!! I feel the lines around my eyes and forehead tightening! Great stuff!!</li>
    <li> Has helped but I need to give it more time before I can truly pass judgement on it.</li>
    <li> It did not work for me , I used about a month but could not see a result. I know things work different on every one , It did feel good on my face and maybe if I used it longer I could see a difference. My daughter is using it now to see if it helps her .</li>
    <li> Okay...I&#x27;m not one for hype nor am I one for flattery. Therefore, I choose not to share untruths and push products that fall short of being superb! In a nutshell this product goes above and beyond. Not only does it tighten your skin but it does so immediately...I tell you no lies! I didn&#x27;t have a lot of loose skin, but what was there is now GONE! Thanks Keshima:).</li>
    <li> Love this stuff!  Feels great when putting on face and neck.  I have been using for about two months now and I can see an improvement with the elasticit in my neck area and it is great on the face as well; a little tighter skin on face area. I put on a nice moisturizer and Vitamin &amp;#34;C&amp;#34; Serum.  Great product!</li>
    <li> I loved it and it works well</li>
    <li> This is a great product for your face and neck.. not a miracle.. but.. really worth using..</li>
    <li> This is so good and I have noticed the lines around my eyes have definitely got smaller</li>
    <li> I just started using this product and so far I am not feeling the moisture in the cream. I am going to keep using to see if there is any improvement in lifting the jawline a bit. I know it takes time in using a product so I am not giving up yet. The scent is nice, like lemongrass...I will get back to you after using for a good two weeks.</li>
    <li> item is not as creamy as before. Seen to be watered down.</li>
    <li> It did not meet my expectation.  It didn&#x27;t firm my loose skin.</li>
    <li> I love this product.  I&#x27;m convinced I saw some improvement within a week in the elasticity of my face and neck.  I would definitely order this product again.</li>
    <li> Did nothing, waste of money</li>
    <li> Feels and smells nice, but it&#x27;s not much different than other creams.</li>
    <li> Yes, I did receive the product and so far have been very pleased with it.  It has a lovely light fragrance and I have been using it every morning prior to other moisturizing lotion I wear under my makeup.  I think it compares nicely to much more expensive creams which I have not been able to afford lately.  I would order this product again and recommend it to anyone looking for a great product at an affordable price.  I gave it 4 out of 5 stars only because I would wait to see how it works after using for a month.</li>
    <li> Amazing product , I&#x27;m in the beauty industry with access to many things to help with aging , this cream does as promised,  I&#x27;m only 3 days in and notice a difference!!</li>
    <li> After using for a few weeks, I can see some improvements and hope to continue to see more improvement!</li>
    <li> Luv this stuff and it smells amazing!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m an Image Consultant &amp; Stylist, and have sold and used probably 100 skin care products over the years. Just recently I began to notice the crepey skin on my neck, after a serious rash that damaged my skin. I am a redhead and have very delicate, thin, fragile skin like my Grandmother. My sister and I, I am noticing, have some saggy issues with our facial skin in our mid 40s. We both eat and drink very healthily, but I don&#x27;t think I was drinking enough water while I was testing this product, which I began in the early summer. Although I did not see the results that I was hoping for in 1 month like many other reviews, I did notice how fantastic this product is and I continue to use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will continue to use it because most of the ingredients are natural, which is important to me and hard to find! (especially hyaluronic acid which is supposed to be incredibly effective, especially if you take the supplement to dissolve in your mouth, which I haven&#x27;t tried yet. I wanted to give this product a fair test to use it on it&#x27;s own without the internal use.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I LOVE THE LEMONGRASS SMELL and the WEIGHT of the product, which is PERFECT &amp; CRITICAL under your makeup in the morning. Not greasy or sticky AT ALL. (They nailed it!) Absorbs quickly. I love the packaging, pump, the amount that comes out in a squirt ( I use 2), the look of the packaging, and I think the price is VERY reasonable and fair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also important to me is my interaction with the company. I received personal attention from the owner, which tells me a great deal about the quality of this company. I would definitely want to order these products from this owner, who is so concerned with her product&#x27;s effectiveness, and I would feel comfortable wholeheartedly recommending her products to my clients, knowing that they would be well cared for. Service is VERY important to me. I also would much rather support a female entrepreneur who is passionate about the quality of her products, wouldn&#x27;t you?!?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use another heavier product with hyaluronic acid at night that has a 2.5% retinol, which you cannot use during the day. I&#x27;m drinking more water and when I don&#x27;t drink alcohol, I notice my skin looks MUCH BETTER. I&#x27;m going to keep this up on a cleanse to give this product another chance to do even better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also found that I liked using my homemade vitamin C serum first, before applying this. Now that I&#x27;m using the 2 in conjunction, I&#x27;m liking the results even better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ordered this for my mom, and will add her review when I talk to her about her results, and liked the products reviews so much I asked to review it. I&#x27;m very impressed and will continue to test it while getting the proper hydration.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please, if you really want to get the best results, don&#x27;t do what I did! Drink lots of water and avoid alcohol and caffeine! And if you&#x27;re already getting great results without trying as hard as I do, LUCKY YOU!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you, Keshima, and I will be watching you for Organic or Nearly Organic products in the future!&#x27;t you?!?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use another heavier product with hyaluronic acid at night that has a 2.5% retinol, which you cannot use during the day. I&#x27;m drinking more water and when I don&#x27;t drink alcohol, I notice my skin looks MUCH BETTER. I&#x27;m going to keep this up on a cleanse to give this product another chance to do even better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also found that I liked using my homemade vitamin C serum first, before applying this.

And if you&#x27;re already getting great results without trying as hard as I do, LUCKY YOU!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you, Keshima, and I will be watching you for Organic or Nearly Organic products in the future!</li>
    <li> Works well and quickly, smells good, has nice texture. I&#x27;m using it on my face as well, and those pesky lines between my eyebrows that I couldn&#x27;t get rid of even with two months of retinol are softening up.</li>
    <li> I was going to return this because although the reviews said \\&quot;light fragrance\\&quot;, the smell was way too strong for me and made me sneeze, but I am upgrading my review to a 5-stars because they did not make me return it. With their guarantee, they refunded my money anyway!</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t used this long enough to see is it&#x27;s working.  One thing I love about this cream is the wonderful scent of lemon grass.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m really liking this product so far. At first I added too much lotion and my face immediately got oily. All you need is 1 pump and it goes a long way. It does have a ginger like scent to it...I looked at the ingredients but I didn&#x27;t see ginger but I did see licorice so I think that could be the scent. It&#x27;s not so bad through since the smell disappears right away. I had small blemishes that never disappeared, after using this for a week those blemishes are slowly fading. I also did breakout when I first started using this, I feel it was detoxing my skin and bringing all the bad stuff out. Now my skin looks great in the morning. I received this at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.</li>
    <li> I love this lotion:-) I use it at night before going to bed. Its very moisturizing ,smells great. I feel it is also working to smooth wrinkles...</li>
    <li> Could not tell any difference.</li>
    <li> Product does exactly as stated.  I have used many of these for much more and been far less satisfied.  I highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I am loving this cream. Will purchase again :)</li>
    <li> My husband and I both use this product and it clearly has had a positive result for both of us.  I already ordered a second bottle to have on hand so that we don&#x27;t run out!  Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> Keshima is a great product and exceptional value.  I&#x27;ve used other very expensive brands and the firming and tightening results have been amazing in a very short time.</li>
    <li> Some improvement.....my neck is most likely beyond repair.</li>
    <li> I am very happy with the product and def notice it working. I had gotten it mostly for my neck but ran out of my regulat face lotion and have been using it all over. The smell is really nice as well and it&#x27;s not too thick or too thin on consistency which is important to me.  I also notice it doesn&#x27;t dry my face out like other lotions that tighten so my makeup is going on better</li>
    <li> I have to say this product is the best I have found on the market and the price point is fantastic.  It really does work with a noticeable difference a matter of days and anxious to see what a full month can do.  I&#x27;m not the only one noticing a difference as my husband and a few friends asked what I was doing different.  The customer service is excellent, shipping was very fast and I am very happy.  I will be ordering again not just for myself, but as gifts as the price point is perfect.  Very happy customer and I love the product.</li>
    <li> If this product so &amp;#34; wonderful &amp;#34; WHY pic &amp;#34; after &amp;#34; is Photoshoped? I  am editing the pictures often and I know what I am talking about . What I see complete lie and this fact turn me off from product</li>
    <li> Love this lotion makes complexion feel and look younger.</li>
    <li> Made me break out in red splotches after first use. I have sensitive skin, but don&#x27;t have problems with Mary Kay, The Body Shop, or Jergens products. The citrus fragrance was not pleasant as others mentioned. If you have sensitive skin, I recommend you stay away.</li>
    <li> Awesome product!  Saw results within days</li>
    <li> There has been no change in the neck skin at all since I started using this cream.</li>
    <li> I love this product. I tried it hoping to replace the much more expensive Perricone Cold Plasma Sub-D. Now that I have used it for a while I feel that it is equally as effective as the higher priced product.The Cold Plasma says it is only for the neck and décolleté but this firming cream is also for use on the face. I think it goes on well, but sometimes I like to spray my face with a little toner before applying as it seems to make it absorb into the skin better.</li>
    <li> Great product!!! Excellent result!!! I will buy this product again.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical. I&#x27;ve been taking great care of my skin for a long time and nothing worked on my neck. I&#x27;m still young, but I&#x27;ve always had deep neck creases, which drove me nuts. I&#x27;ve even used prescription Retin-A on my face &amp; neck for a couple of years and didn&#x27;t see results on my neck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using Keshima for 4 weeks now and I kid you not, I have NO neck creases! They have turned into faint lines that have no depth. I can&#x27;t wait to see what I look like in another month or so! AND, no animal testing!!  :-D</li>
    <li> I am actually dumbfounded by this product. I&#x27;m in my mid-fifties, and am very particular about my skin care and have been for years. I get comments all the time about how I look younger than I am etc. every now and again I go on a hunt for a firming cream...my neck and my heridtary puffy eyes are a constant fight. I bought this firming cream on a whim because of all the positive reviews. From day one the puffiness around my eyes is almost non existent ...I&#x27;m in awe. I&#x27;ve never seen anything like it. My hats off to this product. Buy it! Worth it. And the scent is strong, but pleasant to me...and I&#x27;m very picky about scents. Excellent!!</li>
    <li> I got this product as a promotion.  I&#x27;ve been using it for about a week and I really like it!  It is a nice, light moisturizer.  It soaks in nicely and feels nice on.  It has a pleasant, lemony fragrance.  I&#x27;m guessing this is due to the small amount of lemongrass oil that is in it.  It is somewhat firming.  I&#x27;ve lost a fair amount of weight and have lose skin under my chin.  It has helped a bit with that.  Longer use will tell!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I never would have probably tried this product if it weren&#x27;t for the promo and, depending on my results as I use it longer, may purchase again!</li>
    <li> So far I&#x27;m liking it, but need more time.  I&#x27;ve only had the product for a few days.</li>
    <li> This totally works!  I&#x27;ve used daily for almost 2 weeks now, missing only a day or 2, and feel it has totally improved the &amp;#34;crepe-iness&amp;#34; in the neck area!</li>
    <li> Great Product you will love it.</li>
    <li> Excellent product that really works.  The seller is awesome and replaced my first one when the pump broke free of charge.  Not many sellers like that anymore.  Thank you so much.  Recently had facial and was told I have beautiful skin tone and face.  Thanks again and will order more!</li>
    <li> I am very happy with the results.  I have only been using this product for approximately two weeks and can see a noticeable difference. I was skeptical about what my results would be, however, so far I am truly pleased and looking forward to the possible results 2-3 months down the road.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for the past week and a half and have noticed a considerable different in my skin----especially a BIG reduction in the “crepes”  in my neck.  I really like the product.  I also use the eye cream since I have an inherited eye droopyness-----has tightened my eye area , and hope the improvements continue!!!</li>
    <li> I have only had this product for two weeks, and am so pleased with results. I will definitely reorder, and will also check out other skin products by KESHIMA. Better than anything I&#x27;ve tried from other products.</li>
    <li> This cream is absolutely fantastic, and has done wonders for my facial and neck areas.  My neck and face were beginning to show signs of aging, you know--- the crinkly neck and droopy jawline look. Within a week of usage, I noticed both my neck and face have a smoother and more youthful appearance.  I am in love with this product!!</li>
    <li> I really like this product a lot. The smell is heavenly (light lemony scent) and there is no greasy residue.  I will purchase this again!!!</li>
    <li> Absolutely no noticeable difference in the appearance of my neck.  In other words, I still need a neck lift.</li>
    <li> I have used all kinds of face creams on my face and neck I am so glad I found KESHIMA,  I really like!</li>
    <li> Excellent face and neck cream. I am working in the Marshall Islands and this cream protects my face  from the  very hot sun. I will continue ordering the Keshima neck firming cream. After one week of using it, I can see the difference. My small wrinkles around my eyes are almost gone. Thank you.</li>
    <li> The cream is not bad.  It&#x27;s not great. I am mostly disappointed with the constant e mails I received from the seller asking if I liked the product. I found that extremely irritating.</li>
    <li> I really like this face cream. you can feel it firming when you put it on. Smells great and it makes my face feel smooth.</li>
    <li> I purchased the cream after seeing an ad, and a sale price. What woman in middle age isn&#x27;t looking for beauty products to improve appearance?  The order came within 2 days, and I have used the product for a week.  I loved the consistency, which is thicker, and I used it as a base for my makeup. The scent of lemon is subtle and very pleasant. I use the cream at night also, and it seems to have smoothed my skin, especially my forehead and neck. I can update when I&#x27;ve used it longer, but so far, I&#x27;m very pleased. Update, August 17, 2015.  I have now used the product for 6 weeks and I love it. I see a marked improvement in my face and neck skin, tightening, and softening. I totally love this product. I saw mentioned that it came with a pump container, and mine did not. It would be great if it did, to get the most product from the container.  This is the best of many creams and lotions I&#x27;ve tried. It really does work.</li>
    <li> Very disappointed in the product been using for over 2 weeks no change in my skin...</li>
    <li> love the way it feels on my face</li>
    <li> good product at good price!</li>
    <li> I have only been using this cream for a few weeks, so I cannot yet say whether or not it tightens facial/neck skin.  However, it is a good moisturizer and application goes on smoothly.  A little goes a long way (I use one pump for my face and two pumps for my neck/chest area).  I have used products that are much more expensive and this rivals every one of them, for a fraction of the cost.  I have already reordered my second bottle and I will continue using it morning and night.</li>
    <li> I am 62 and have noticed that the skin on my neck is starting to sag. Since using this lotion, my neck seems to be getting smoother.  The lotion is light, not greasy at all, absorbs quickly, and smells great!!  I have only been using it for 2 1/2 weeks so believe the results will be even more fantastic!!</li>
    <li> I will continue to use this product.  I can really feel a mild tightening sensation.  Doesn&#x27;t seem to clog pores.  It is very competitively priced.</li>
    <li> I use it daily to remove the wrinkles on my neck. I have used it for over a month. This neck firming cream actually works. I has removed the crease lines on my neck.  There were no side affects- no burning or itching or rash. I have used other neck products that have made me break out in a horrible rash. My neck looks smooth all day! No more turkey neck!</li>
    <li> I was beginning to notice age in my face recently. I don&#x27;t believe in plastic surgery so I found this alternative. I love it. I have only been using it about a week and I already notice my face and neck being firmer and not saggy. I love this stuff. any woman wanting to feel younger and not so saggy should try this lol</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s been 3 weeks of using this product but I can see small improvements already. Don&#x27;t expect drastic change overnight. Neck, more than any part of your face, needs more time to correct. But I see that sagging decreased and skin became firmer. If using this product for a long haul, you can expect good results.</li>
    <li> Has a lemony scent .Love it.Face does not feel gunked out.Very refreshing!</li>
    <li> Love this cream much better than Periconne neck and face and the price is a lot better, will definitely buy more!</li>
    <li> Goes on great! Very smooth. No disgusting smell and seems to be working good.</li>
    <li> This product is incredible! Love the smell and can feel the firming action as it&#x27;s drying on my skin. After less than 2 weeks of use I&#x27;ve noticed a difference and a vendor told me the other day that I look younger and younger every time he sees me!  How can you beat that?? Love it and will definitely be re-ordering!</li>
    <li> Absolutely wonderful product. It makes my feel young again...</li>
    <li> I am 50 and have sagging skin on my neck and jaw line. I have been using this cream for about a week now and have actually notice SOME difference already. Am excited and hopeful for even more good results. Smell is pleasant and it does seem to moisturize nicely as well. We shall see what the results are by the time I am out before I decide if I will continue to keep buying on a regular basis...am hopeful tho.</li>
    <li> Great product.  I could see results after just a few days.</li>
    <li> I was surprised at how well this cream tightened my skin.  I&#x27;ve been using a competitor&#x27;s cream for a few years, but this worked just as well, and for half the price!  I&#x27;ve even had a few people mention that I looked healthier.  Will continue to purchase.</li>
    <li> This neck and face cream is great!  I noticed  immediately how soft it made my face and neck.  When I awake in the morning, I feel a more firmer complextion.  I will continue to use it.</li>
    <li> Had a strong smell and didn&#x27;t do anything.</li>
    <li> Very creamy.  We shall see how it works, but it absorbs well into the skin, and is not thick.</li>
    <li> so far so good  makes my skin smooth and soft</li>
    <li> I LOVE the product and plan to order more in the future. I promise I will be sticking with this face cream.  It keeps my face smooth, goes on nice, not watery or oily, lasts long and I see a noticeable difference.  I am a true believer in this product..</li>
    <li> I have recently received the Keshima Face &amp; Neck firming cream and so far love&lt;br /&gt; it. It seems to agree with my skin type perfectly (which very few products&lt;br /&gt; do). It leaves my skin very smooth without a greasy feeling. Definitely&lt;br /&gt; will order again.</li>
    <li> Just started using this a few days ago. Very nice product, simple to use. I use it every morning and before bed just like the directions say.  My skin already feels nice and smooth, not sure about firming just yet, as it&#x27;s only been a couple days, but will update on that later on after I&#x27;ve had a couple weeks to use it.</li>
    <li> I received it on time and I really like it. Seems to be as good if not&lt;br /&gt;better than the expensive stuff I used before! I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll buy it again&lt;br /&gt;when I run out.</li>
    <li> I have been using this cream for a week and I had some crepe skin on my neck and now its gone! This stuff really works and the price is reasonable!!!</li>
    <li> Works great for my neck I&#x27;m just 32 but this neck firming cream is the bomb love it recommended</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always been conscious of my sagging &amp;#34;double chin&amp;#34;. I didn&#x27;t know there was any way to get rid of it, except for losing weight and hoping that it firms up. I was given the opportunity to test this product, and share my experiences and feedback. I&#x27;m already somewhat impressed with this product, as my skin has started to firm up under my chin. They&#x27;re not huge results, but results none the same. Every day I get closer to that look I want. I love that this cream has a light fresh scent that&#x27;s not overpowering. It goes on smoothly without any clumping, and dries to leave your face feeling smooth as well. I started out using this twice a day, once in the morning and once at night. Now I am only using it at night before bed. I think this is a great quality product, and am definitely going to buy it again. I would recommend this to anyone that is looking to firm up that under-chin area or even the jaw line area.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about a week now and have seen a decrease in the appearance of my forehead wrinkles. It also has made the skin on my neck very soft. It does not feel heavy when applied and does not leave my skin feeling oily. I really am enjoying this product and will add it to my &amp;#34;must haves&amp;#34; list for beauty care.</li>
    <li> The older I get the more I worry about my skin and am always looking for a way to help myself look and feel better ,so when I was offered this product during a promotion I was more than happy to give it a try. I have only used it a few days, but I have used it morning and night. It comes in a very pretty bottle and it has a very light citrus smell, which is very pleasant. I can absolutely see a difference in my skin and neck, I have very sensitive skin and it did not bother it at all. This is a very nice product. I would recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for about a week now, primarily on my neck and chin area. My skin feels much more refreshed and moisturized, but I have not seen any changes in wrinkles (I have a few fine wrinkles due to mainly ignoring the neck area for the last 10 years). I would not expect to see any changes at this time, and expect that the increased moisture should at least protect the skin from much more pronounced aging.&lt;br /&gt;I do have to say that the fragrance of this cream is AMAZING: it smells like lemons/citrus fruit, and is very pleasant. I put this cream on in the morning and before bed, and have noticed that I am now looking forward to this part of my skincare routine. The product does tend to be a little sticky after application on my skin (I live in an area where temperatures tend to be higher, and at this time of year the humidity is higher as well). However, in the morning I lightly dust my skin with setting powder, and my neck remains well-moisturized for the rest of the day. In the evening, I only notice the stickiness right after I apply the product, and the sensation quickly goes away.&lt;br /&gt;Pros: great smell&lt;br /&gt;  fantastic moisture&lt;br /&gt;  easy to use/put on--goes on smoothly&lt;br /&gt;  potential to slow aging/wrinkles due to excellent skin hydration&lt;br /&gt;  price: for this price, the product is quite comparable to others in its category from more expensive manufacturers&lt;br /&gt;Cons: feels a little sticky right after application, but this is easily remedied with setting powder that is part of the morning makeup routine&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I feel like I will continue to use this product as part of my daily skincare routine. I feel that it was money well spent.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love the Firming Cream. I have told friends and family. I am sure they will be placing orders. I will be ordering this product on a regular basis.</li>
    <li> I can tell a slight difference in the firmness of my skin after just a few days of use. Nice texture, absorbs well, no greasy feel, odd scent (but not unpleasant, just unusual - it dissipates quickly). Pump dispenses the perfect amount for neck, upper chest, and face. I imagine this bottle will last at least a month with 2x/day use.</li>
    <li> Makes my neck so soft and smooth</li>
    <li> I saw an immediate difference after only two days of use. My skin has a radiant glow and its smooth &amp; supple.</li>
    <li> You will be amazed - I have bought several high priced creams only to be let down each and every time.  This cream will deliver - you must do it faithfully morning and night and trust me you will see a difference.  At 59 I was ready to accept the aging in my face but now I can actually do something about it, and best of all you look natural. The company stands behind their product as well, they acutally e-mailed me wanting to know what I thought.  Can&#x27;t remember the last time I bought something and the selller wanted my honest opinion, guess when something works why not!!!</li>
    <li> This is a rip off! I used this day and night and noticed no improvement what so ever... when I look in the mirror, it looks like my neck got fatter :/ I&#x27;m not impressed!!</li>
    <li> I have tried my fair share of anti-aging skin lotions but this one really stands out from all the rest. It goes on so smooth and makes my skin feel silky soft, not greasy. After I wash my face I apply this to my face and neck before I put my make up on. I love that it&#x27;s so gentle on my sensitive skin yet effectively tightens and firms my skin, eliminating wrinkles and fine lines on my face and neck. My skin feels so soft &amp; hydrated. It also has a pump dispenser that allows me to get just the right amount without waste or contamination. Best of all it is made in the USA and NOT tested on animals, two things that are important to me as a consumer.</li>
    <li> I have never really noticed any wrinkles or creases in my neck until I used this amazing neck frame and realized how smooth and beautiful it leaves your neck. This cream is not all oily and doesn&#x27;t dry all stiff. It just dries gradually and it leaves your skin soft and smooth. I got it on promotion but I&#x27;m definitely getting another.</li>
    <li> Really nice product.  The texture feels good on my skin. It moisturizes and i can feel the firming action. I will purchase this product again.</li>
    <li> This product has really made a difference in my skin on my face and neck. Smoother and less lines. Also, I LOVE the scent!</li>
    <li> I think I&#x27;ve found what I&#x27;ve been looking for. I will have to use it for awhile to know the full benefits of it but I think I&#x27;ll like it. If it firms, I&#x27;m all for it. It has a nice little smell to it. Nothing over powering at all. Makes my face soft too.&lt;br /&gt;Super fast shipping and nice clean packaging. Thank you</li>
    <li> I love this cream. I have used this for about a week now and have noticed a huge difference in my skin. The skin on my neck and jaw is tighter and smoother. This cream has a light fresh scent and it works just as well as some of the more expensive creams that I have used.</li>
    <li> This is my first experience using firming cream, but I am nearing 40 and am becoming more and more aware of my skins appearance and the need for products like this.  I really like that this is a product made in the USA.  I can trust that quality standards are in play, and I feel safe using this on my face.  The cream is nice and thick, and a little goes a long way.  It feels good going on and has a pleasant fragrance.  I have only been using this for a few weeks now, so I haven&#x27;t noticed any amazing results yet, but will update my review in a few months.  For now, I apply this under my make-up and before bedtime, and it feels great.</li>
    <li> I love this cream.  I will buy again and again. It is super hydrating and it smells great! I have noticed a decrease in fine lines around my eyes. I am very pleased with this product. I have been using for about 3 weeks.  I did notice instant and all day hydration right away.</li>
