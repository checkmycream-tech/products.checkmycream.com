      <li>very good price is recommended, if used at home is fine</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m very satisfied</li>
      <li>I am a \\&quot;brother\\&quot; who has not been to the barbershop for 20 years, because I cut my own hair.  </li>
      <li>These are nowhere as nice as the others.</li>
      <li>Well kind of anyways</li>
      <li>Anyway, I think this will be a good product for most people.</li>
      <li>Just what I needed to cut our hair,nice and sharp,no pinching,pulling,etc,  clean,and handy.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s nice.</li>
      <li>Having used Wahl&#x27;s before I was looking at their product for my own set of clippers.</li>
      <li>Honestly, for the price, I could get two haircuts out of this</li>
      <li>I always wanted to cut my own hair</li>
      <li>AMAZON,  VERY HAPPY  WITH THIS CLIPPER SET VERY QIUTE TO USE.  </li>
      <li>I used to own one of these</li>
      <li>but it was kind of a hassle and the \\&quot;book\\&quot; that comes with</li>
      <li>and you can cut your own hair for years vs $20 for one hair cut.</li>
      <li>but it wasn&#x27;t catching everything when I did try.</li>
      <li>It gets really warm after 10-15 minutes.</li>
      <li>It is well worth the price - a great deal.</li>
      <li>the clipper is very light, in fact too light to do a good job.</li>
      <li>good morning, I just got my hands on the purchased product, excellent sending, excellent case in which the product but comes time to try and use the same will not start, I plugged into different outlets and no lights in the manual has no power specification, which causes discomfort</li>
      <li>The clipper was made with very cheap plastic and some scratch was seen.</li>
      <li>Very good deal on a combo pro 14-piece hair clippers and price just fit into budget if you are looking to cut your our kids hair for the first time.</li>
      <li>They cut very smoothly in fact.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m loyal to Wahls and this was a good deal.</li>
      <li>The Wahl 79450 Combo Pro 14 - Piece Complete Styling Kit, it&#x27;s a very good item 100 % recommended for me</li>
      <li>The clipper, though cheap and light-weight, does not give a nice cut for my hair.</li>
      <li>shipped on time satisfied</li>
      <li>Be sure to oil the blades before every session.</li>
      <li>I think it may need the guards to guide the hair in better.</li>
      <li>For the price I love it.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll just continue to make do with it and replace it with a better product eventually.</li>
      <li>The price was fantastic!</li>
      <li>and I appreciate it all the more.</li>
      <li>thinking i would love the clipper.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m sure.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve gotten about 15 uses out of it, so it has more than served its purpose, even if i have to throw it out today.</li>
      <li>I love Wahl products</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll have them for a while. :)</li>
      <li>- I am sure Wahl didn&#x27;t have this use in mind.  </li>
      <li>this provides everything most people would get at a barber shop.  </li>
      <li>The battery powered clippers are much better than I would have ever bet before I owned them.  </li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m ok with that.  </li>
      <li>I have tried more expensives models of this brand, and they are better, but this looks and work pretty good for the price.</li>
      <li>Very cool I love it...</li>
      <li>Most importantly the item was defective.</li>
      <li>I got everything I expected out of this product and it works wonderfully.</li>
      <li>Other than that, this is a great product!</li>
      <li>Easy to use.</li>
      <li>advice to you is to avoid these brands and buy something more powerful like the \\&quot;Wahl 79900N\\&quot; which also adjusts the clipper blade height without having to use a guard/comb and most of all, AVOID BUYING FROM \\&quot;Brand</li>
      <li>Serves me right not to Google the words best clipper next time.</li>
      <li>trimmer and guards are fine though.</li>
      <li>I bought this for my husband and son and it works just fine.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used Norelco and Conair and they&#x27;ve worked just fine.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Spend a few more dollars and get a better set. The blades are dull and pull more than they cut.</li>
    <li> On the first hair cutting of the family it fought to get through my son&#x27;s hair.  It wasn&#x27;t that long and yet this clipper did not work well.  On the second hair cut in my family it started emitting a very loud sound.  I thought it was the way the clip was attached to the clippers, but it still did it even after trying to fix it.  I&#x27;m disappointed.  Much lower quality than I expected from a Wahl.</li>
    <li> The only reason I gave it 3 is because before the 1st use, I had to apply the oil to the blades which was annoying as that kept sticking to my hand and made the trimmer very slippery and fidgety in my girlfriend&#x27;s hand who was trying to give me a proper haircut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After cleaning all the oil, the trimmer worked perfectly fine though, so no complaints there. But I have used a few other trimmers in the past and have never applied any kind of oil to those.</li>
    <li> If it would be possible to give this product 0 or even below zero stars, I would. I tried to shorten my beard with the trimmer today and the only thing it did was to pluck out some hair and stop when more there were more than 4 hairs to cut at once. I did not even try the battery powered second option, because those are usually worse than the ones with an outlet. Anyway, I would never buy this product, because even $19 is too much for this.</li>
    <li> When I used this clipper, it would stall while trying to cut my hair. The motor and blades would stop moving. Since my hair was only about 3/4 inch long and I was cutting it to 1/4 inch, I don&#x27;t see any use for this clipper. It cannot perform it&#x27;s intended purpose. I will be returning it for a refund. Save yourself the trouble and buy something else.</li>
    <li> Me gusto mucho la presentación de este producto, funciona bien y tiene los implementos minimos para realizar de manera correcta un corte de cabello junto con un buen manual explicativo para principiantes como yo, sin embargo pensé que el sonido de la cortadora iba a ser mas silencioso, pero no fue así.</li>
    <li> My first clippers were Wahl brand and I loved them.  When they finally died I tried to get a deal and switched to Oster brand.  They were not nearly as good so I switched back to Wahl.  This product damages their brand.  I could not even get 1 complete haircut before the blades were putting 3 stripes in my hair.  After 3-4 trims they were completely dull.  I threw them away, shaved my head with a razor and wrote this review.  Do not spend your hard earned money on this specific product.</li>
    <li> Excellent product and very easy to use!!  I just purchased this product in replacement for the same one that I had that lasted 7 years and was used frequently.  I used it to cut my 3 sons and husband&#x27;s hair.  I feel I definitely got my money&#x27;s worth if you add up all the haircuts I would have paid for in the 7 years so I didn&#x27;t want to take any chances by ordering any other one.</li>
    <li> The trimmers stopped working after a year or so...</li>
    <li> I used to own one of these and I decided to buy another...well, turns out that either the product was a fake/counterfeit/after-market/not original, as I immediately noticed that it wasn&#x27;t running up to full throttle until after using it for a while. By the 3rd use, the clippers were hardly moving and hardly producing sound. It suddenly quit working without warning...I was so mad I put it in the trash where it belongs...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;...I am not too pleased with this because I paid almost $30 for this back then and didn&#x27;t even use it past a couple months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My advice to you is to avoid these brands and buy something more powerful like the \\&quot;Wahl 79900N\\&quot; which also adjusts the clipper blade height without having to use a guard/comb and most of all, AVOID BUYING FROM \\&quot;Brand Variety\\&quot; because they sold me junk and did nothing to help.</li>
    <li> We ordered the clippers to continue shaving my sons head at home.  There isn&#x27;t an adjustable blade on this one, so our choices are too short or not short enough.  Beard trimmer was great for the hubby!!</li>
    <li> It is my 3rd set clippers. I bought it in April 2009. The whole kit looks pretty cheap, from the box to the blades. The box cover did not even fix. The clipper was made with very cheap plastic and some scratch was seen. There is huge noise when turn on. Finally unable to cut in 6 months. Just pull hair. I am very good in maintaining. It must be product defect. Try to contact the manufacture: To send this back for repair will cost $11 postage. Not worth to exchange with another cheap one. This was bought on amazon.</li>
    <li> These are wonderful clippers, and the seller got them to me in an expedited fashion!</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t have much hair left but these blaze right through it!</li>
    <li> I have tried more expensives models of this brand, and they are better, but this looks and work pretty good for the price. the on/off switch its a little hard to move, but once you have practiced stop being a problem. So if you are not planning to spend a lot of money in a device like this, you should get this one.</li>
    <li> Wahl 79450 HomePro 14-Piece Styling Kit with Clipper and Trimmer    very happy with this purchase!  And the quick delivery!</li>
    <li> The trimmer not only cuts hair, but skin as well - Be careful! the clipper is very light, in fact too light to do a good job.</li>
    <li> I got them for my bro he has a thing for cutting hair but he appreciate them. thanks a lot!!!</li>
    <li> its a shame that i bought this product thinking that what was promised in the product description was exactly what the customer will get.  But i actually gave it away to a friend so he can play with it.  The product didnt not met mine expectations i will have to buy another one due to the fact that this product just didnt even work to trim my bear which is a lot to say</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t complain about the quality or the features. For this price this is a steal.</li>
    <li> Okay but not great. Was louder than expected and a bit heavy</li>
    <li> The trimmew was fine . the clipper was not that good. it pulls if you go too fast.  Probably lacks power.  Price sometimes makes a differance. Kept it for the trimmer but will continue to use my old clipper</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a fairly good product for the money. The wall plug razor is the loudest razor I&#x27;ve ever used. Does a decent job of cutting the hair with minimal effort.    The attachments that come with it are useful, however not practical to use.    So due to the loudness of it, and the cheap construction I only give it 3/5 stars.</li>
    <li> Just as good as one you would by in the store</li>
    <li> This is an excellent product.  We have a Japanese Chin that enjoys being groomed and this Wahl does a great job.  It is quiet, sharp, lightweight and effortless to use.  It is well worth the price - a great deal.</li>
    <li> The instructions said everything is oiled and adjusted for immediate use out of the box, but I double checked to make sure the blades were aligned correctly. When I went to use it, it would reach my hair and then just stop. The clippers would not cut. I read the instructions further and checked about the power adjustment on the side. It stated clearly that the screw should only be turned as far as you can without the clippers getting very noisy. Once it gets noisy, turn it back a bit till it stops. Well I played with it only to find it was already set to max power without noise. But they would not cut at all.    So I decided to turn it till it was noisy, and they cut. They cut very smoothly in fact. But it sounded like a lawn mower was cutting my hair. You would absolutely need ear protection to use them like this, but it was seemingly the only way to get them to work. The only reason I give it 2 stars is because they do in fact cut smoothly, but the sound is intolerable. I would not recommend these to anyone.</li>
    <li> Looking for an alternative to the sometime cumbersome corded heavier hair cutting clippers I had in the past, I was initially excited to see this cordless offering from a hair clipper company I have had such excellent results with in past years.  I decided to try the cordless version for convenience and weight concerns. The first thing I noticed about the system was the cheap plastic construction of the product. The next thing was the underpowered cutting motor. The first time I tried the cutter I used it plugged into an outlet to see what kind of performance I would receive with full power.  It was only moderately effective in its cutting ability.  The motor emitted a whiny underpowered sound. After fulling charging it per manual, the resulting motor strength was less than the plugged in strength. The third time I was going to use it, and as I was removing the head to make sure all was aligned properly, the thin flimsy plastic support guides that held the cutting head in place broke off making the clipper worthless. The cordless version was 3x more expensive than their corded ones, and in my experience and opinion with them, a major waste of money!  Wahl makes exceptional corded hair cutter systems with solid durable motors and related parts. I for one will stick with the corded versions, and endure the heavier weight as a workout tool!</li>
    <li> When this trimmer isn&#x27;t making a horribly loud vibrating noise, it works quite well. The mini-clipper is passable. As for the loud noise, in order to make it stop, I have to give the clipper a tap on the counter. This works almost every time. I don&#x27;t recommend this styling set. I should have returned it, but I&#x27;ve had it for over a year. I&#x27;ll just continue to make do with it and replace it with a better product eventually.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d been using my aunt&#x27;s Wahl Clippers for a while and decided it was finally time to buy a pair of my own.  The trimmer was fabulous, but the clipper pulled my hair and didn&#x27;t cut it short enough or evenly.  After 30 minutes of literally crying and shaking from how much it hurt, my girlfriend and I gave up.  I&#x27;ll be returning it and purchasing a stronger set of clippers.  I know that I have think hair, but it was unbearable.  Trimmers and guards worked fine though.</li>
    <li> I got this simply because of the price, for $20 bucks you cant go wrong, costs $15 to get a haircut so i figured that if i got 2 uses out of this, i would have gotten my money&#x27;s worth. I&#x27;ve gotten about 15 uses out of it, so it has more than served its purpose, even if i have to throw it out today. You also get the cool little trimmer which i think works even  better than the big clipper but just not as durable because it has started sounding weird, as opposed to the nicely silenced sound it had in the beginning, but then again: Money&#x27;s worth.</li>
    <li> I have had this Wahl clipper kit for a couple of months, and simply stated, everything in the kit works extremely well.  And the kit is very inexpensive.  A great value for the home barber. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The 120V clippers are hefty.  They are solidly built, sharp and powerful enough for a thick beard.  The battery powered clippers are much better than I would have ever bet before I owned them.  They are serious, powerful clippers.  It should be noted that the clipper guide combs only fit the 120V clippers.  There are no guide combs for the battery clippers, but they are made for trimming, not hair cutting.  Also, the 2 AA batteries go in a little weird, one has to be put all the way in the bottom of the battery compartment before the other one goes in off to the side but on top of the other battery. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Both clippers work extremely well, but the consumer friendly details of the kit make this an exceptional value. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;This set is packaged in a re-useable, plastic, foam padded box with a plastic latch that REALLY IS big enough to hold all of the parts included in the kit.  No more messing with a cheap, torn, (and flimsy) cardboard box.  Also, the clipper oil is not not in a plastic bubble pouch, it is in a small, screw top squeeze bottle.  You actually can use the oil more than once, it doesn&#x27;t leak out all over the box during storage.  You can actually lubricate the clippers more than once which should make them cut well for years. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;These are quality clippers and the kit is a great value.  This Wahl clipper kit is made for the long haul; powerful, sharp clippers and a kit that was made for years of home use. &lt;br /&gt;</li>
    <li> I like this product, course is cheap and I don&#x27;t expect to much for this one, but for what I want the trimmer is more than fine, I don&#x27;t like the material is a kind of bad plastic, remember me recicle things.    Anyway grab it if you just one cut you extra hair in your body.</li>
    <li> My husband loved this</li>
    <li> I bought this trimmer to trim my dog, but it is so loud as to be unusable.  It is loud enough to require someone standing right next to you to yell to be heard. It is louder then my vacuum cleaner and lawn mower.  You&#x27;d think it would have to be sporting a gas powered 2-cycle engine to be this loud.  There is an adjustment screw on the side, but this only helps slightly, and mostly changes the cacophony&#x27;s proportion of buzzing to rattling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as clipping ability: they seem fine, but their usability is largely hampered by the need to wrap multiple bath towels around them to tone down the noise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought these a few years ago, tried several times to adjust them or work around the noise, then gave up and put them on a top shelf.  I recently saw them sitting there and thought to myself \\&quot;they couldn&#x27;t have been as bad as I remember\\&quot;.  My memories were accurate.</li>
    <li> AMAZON,  VERY HAPPY  WITH THIS CLIPPER SET VERY QIUTE TO USE.  i CAN CUT MY HAIR AT 2:00 AM AND MAKE NO NOISE.</li>
    <li> For someone who wears their hair buzzed this provides everything most people would get at a barber shop.  Many barbers no longer use a straight razor to get a clean edge around the ears &amp; at the back of the neck.  They use an electric trimmer like the one found in this set.  I said \\&quot;I can do that\\&quot; and did.  At $20 per haircut at the barber, one cut at home paid for the product.</li>
    <li> Use this on a weekly basis. Holds up well. The trimmer is great for around the ears. Just the right amount of accessories. One minor flaw is the case could be a \\&quot;little highe/longer. Just a tad.</li>
    <li> Very cool I love it...anything to complain about</li>
    <li> Having used Wahl&#x27;s before I was looking at their product for my own set of clippers. My sister who cuts hair for a living suggested I purchase Wahl&#x27;s as well. I got the clippers, and they already have paid for themselves double over I&#x27;m sure. Myself and a few buddies cut our hair on a weekly basis to stay proffesional looking. Clippers do a very good job on balding, as well as basic fades / high and tight cuts. The trimmer that is included is very nice as well, all though a little loud. But I certainly wouldn&#x27;t think about getting a replacement for it unless it breaks. Over all I&#x27;m very happy with this purchase, and look forward to many haircuts with it.</li>
    <li> Such a cheap set of clippers, I was really surprised. Normally Wahl is known for quality, but this has to be at the very bottom of their product line. It looks and feels so cheap and the sparse few guides it comes with are made with such crappy plastic that the combing teeth are all bent and crooked. The small trimmer uses AA batteries instead of a built-in rechargeable, and there are no guides for the smaller clipper at all. Skip this set and spend a little more on something that will last and actually be built well enough to give at least one good haircut. I saw these on sale and snatched them without researching due to my familiarity with the Wahl brand. Trust me, this experience has absolutely ruined whatever positive opinion I&#x27;d previously had of Wahl. Will be a lot more cautious when I consider their products in the future.</li>
    <li> This purchase represents a saving at home, besides allowing you to create different styles my son cut and always be fashionable. very good product. I&#x27;m very satisfied</li>
    <li> I bought this to save money and time on trips to the barber every two weeks for my son&#x27;s fast growing hair.  He&#x27;s got thick hair that we like to keep \\&quot;buzzed\\&quot; short.  The first time I used the clippers, he complained that they really pull at the hair.  I realized they were jamming up with each strip of hair I buzzed.  The little trimmer that is included never jammed but still pulled at his hair.  I&#x27;ve decided to send it back.  Reasonably priced but not worth the pain.  NOT RECOMENDED FOR THICK HAIR.</li>
    <li> i recieved the item a while back and have been using it since this is a very good buy and worth the price shipped on time satisfied</li>
    <li> Well I don&#x27;t think there is really much you can say about a clipper set, is there? I&#x27;m loyal to Wahls and this was a good deal. It shaves pretty well though I find I have to go back over areas a time or two to make sure I get it all the same length. I think it may have to do with the way the guard is and not a fault of the clipper itself. I&#x27;ve had it for maybe a month now and it has kept up well the four or so times I&#x27;ve shaved my head since. The little trimmer that comes with it is pretty nice and powerful for running on AA batteries. It trimmed down my facial hair and cleaned up my neck very fast when my old trimmer took some pressing and a few passes. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I only have two minor complaints about the actual product itself. It gets really warm after 10-15 minutes. Normally this might not be a big deal but if you have a big head like I do and have to make sure you get it all done properly it can start to get too hot to want to use. The other thing is that it isn&#x27;t too great for no guard shaving. Now granted I only tried it once but it wasn&#x27;t catching everything when I did try. It could be that I was just holding it at the wrong angle to get it, which is easy to do in a mirror, but I thought it was worth noting just incase. I think it may need the guards to guide the hair in better. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Also, something kind of odd and nasty, Amazon sent me an open used one. Now for $15 I wasn&#x27;t going to bother returning it or complaining. I just cleaned it off with some alcohol wipes and got rid of the left over hair(Yuck!) and it was good to go but it really is worth stating because I think I would have got something else if I&#x27;d have known I would get a used one.</li>
    <li> Bought it because I&#x27;m traveling and I left my older Whal set at home. So far works perfectly fine, just like the other one I&#x27;ve got.</li>
    <li> I ordered this product about a month ago, and since then have used it twice.  So far, no complaints, can&#x27;t ask for anything better for the price!</li>
    <li> Two shipments received and both contained broken combs. Not only does Wahl pack these to guarantee breakage, but these combs would break in a few cuttings anyway - extremely flimsy. Wahl chose to use the cheapest plastic available (the same plastic your garbage bags are made from) and sacrificed quality in doing so.    The cutter may be great, but I&#x27;ll never know and I recommend that you don&#x27;t risk trying to find out if it is.</li>
    <li> We always use this kit the best.</li>
    <li> I got the product in time but didn&#x27;t use it for a month. When I opened it, it was a used item with even hairs on the blade. Most importantly the item was defective. As it was one month old since I received the package. I couldn&#x27;t even returned it. Complete wastage of money.</li>
    <li> The Wahl 79450 Combo Pro 14 - Piece Complete Styling Kit, it&#x27;s a very good item 100 % recommended for me</li>
    <li> I am a \\&quot;brother\\&quot; who has not been to the barbershop for 20 years, because I cut my own hair.  Ever since I started doing that, I have only used Wahl clippers, and I have never been disappointed.  The price is right for this cutting and trimming set.  I use the plug-in clippers for the basic cutting, and the cordless unit for perfecting my Quo Vadis.  I highly recommend the set.  The smallest guide comb is made of pretty flimsy plastic, but that is my only complaint.</li>
    <li> been using it regularly big money saver self hair cuts and no travel to get it cut</li>
    <li> Great price and does the job. Easy to use.</li>
    <li> This product looks as good as it performs, which is great. I know and trust the Wahl name itself to make A high performance product and they acheive that here, the trimmer&#x27;s are so light-weight you can use them anywhere with ease</li>
    <li> Gracias. Excelente Producto.</li>
    <li> This is a powerful little machine which does a great job cutting hair.  I must confess a reason I got it was to trim my Cocker spaniel&#x27;s hair - I am sure Wahl didn&#x27;t have this use in mind.  But this clipper has power and easily cuts through even her thick hair.  I still need to experiment, but the many attachments promise excellent results.  And I like the little beard trimmer - it&#x27;s real handy!</li>
    <li> This was my second Wahl product and I am still disappointed. The first item I had was beard and mustache trimmer I received as a gift. Didn&#x27;t work, slow speed, didn&#x27;t cut. That was more than ten years ago so I thought I&#x27;d give &#x27;em another try. My mistake. Same problems. I&#x27;ve used Norelco and Conair and they&#x27;ve worked just fine. I recommend those brands, but do not purchase Wahl.</li>
    <li> Not as good as I thought.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t cut thick hair very well, the speed is to slow.</li>
    <li> Poor quality. I got this as a gift for my husband. He said it pulled his hair and would not function properly. We will be sending it back this week.</li>
    <li> I bought these to replace a Wahl trimmer that I had for 15 years until I dropped it onto a concrete floor. Bye bye clippers... The larger trimmer in this set is OK for the price, but it pales in comparison to a Wahl that cost just a little more. I only use it once a month, so it&#x27;s good denough. If I used it more frequently I&#x27;d be less tolerant of the relatively flimsy build quality. The guards attach somethwat firmly, but I find myself constantly checking them. The clip-on mechanism doesn&#x27;t inspire a ton of confidence.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The little trimmer in this set is just about useless. It uses AA batteries, not an internal rechargable battery, which kind of stinks. It&#x27;s also woefully underpowered - trimming anything thicker than a single eyelash bogs it down. I didn&#x27;t buy the set with any expectations of using this smaller unit, though, so the set overall is still &amp;#34;good enough&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> My husband loves this thanks</li>
    <li> Although I paid less than $20 for this set I was disappointed when I used it.  No where on the ad does it state that you need batteries for the trimmer and the combs are extremely flimsy.  Unless you make sure they are lined up perfect they leave a crazy gap when you&#x27;re cutting hair. It did cut my sons hair but it was kind of a hassle and the \\&quot;book\\&quot; that comes with it is very hard to understand.</li>
    <li> Product is terrible.  The cutting edge is not parallel to the blades and cuts much sorter on one side than the other, including my skin!  Also the product becomes extremely hot after several minutes of use, so much that I could no longer hold it and had to wait a while just to finish.  I would not recommend this product to anyone and will spend my money with another company in the future.</li>
    <li> it does a 3 star job of shaving my head but that&#x27;s about it. it could be better but it could be worse. would behoove you to spend a few extra bucks and go to a better model up the line.</li>
    <li> Wahl has always made a quality item and like always this is another one... I was very please with this products and use it everyday. I would suggest this item to anyone who is in search of a good set of clippers....</li>
    <li> I just cut my hair for the first time and they worked fantastic! I love the lengths of the guides you get with it, they&#x27;re perfect, and it was very easy to use. Honestly, for the price, I could get two haircuts out of this and I&#x27;d be saving money, but it&#x27;s very heavy duty and I get the feeling I&#x27;ll have them for a while. :)</li>
    <li> Belongs in a kids playroom not good quality</li>
    <li> Like the title for my review, it ain&#x27;t commercial grade. But it is completely adequate. Price is cheap. Been using it myself for awhile cutting my own hair and no complaints.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The battery powered trimmer is the real bonus. I shave maybe once a week. The trimmer takes me down to stubble that a double edge makes short work of. It is a real mustache trimmer to boot. I also use it for buzzing the hair from around my ears.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would I recommend it? In a heart-beat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Okay, drawbacks.&lt;br /&gt;The little vial of cutter-head oil is puny and leaks. The two comb heads for right-side and left-side is silly at best. The brush for cleaning the cutter-head is a joke.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the price is right and I&#x27;m quite happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> The motor on these clippers is very weak and cannot even cut head hair. Product is complete garbage</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t believe Amazon would sell something like that to its customers. It&#x27;s extreeeemely noisy that I immediately put them away. Simply don&#x27;t buy this! Huge disappointment in Amazon prime</li>
    <li> I bought this to replace basically the same model I had purchased a few years before. The first time I purchased this product it worked very well for about three years and then wires in the the cord finally must have worn because it worked only when the cord was bent a certain direction. So far this model works equally well. A good product for the price, and I got a few years use out of the last one before having to replace it. I liked it enough to buy the same model again.</li>
    <li> It was not the clipper you want it&#x27;s the one I could afford . This one bogs when cutting my hair clipped in a crea clip . It nicked me manscaping ohh boy the blending comb has 1/2 the comb teeth of a &amp;#34;real comb&amp;#34; Gee! Ouch!! Is this the toy dept or a shop of horrors? Serves me right not to Google the words best clipper next time. It is no better that I expected. My one hope is that is a well toy and I can snag  myself for years to come.</li>
    <li> The product does not work ... bring it to a service and told to come damaged...</li>
    <li> Maybe spend more if you&#x27;re actually serious about cutting. For my needs, I guess its adequate. Anybody else, I&#x27;d assume would be pissed.</li>
    <li> I got everything I expected out of this product and it works wonderfully. The only reason I was hesitant to give it a 5 star rating was because it&#x27;s noisy, however that was not in the original expectation and I can handle having a noisy buzzer since it does its job. My previous buzzer was cheep and I didn&#x27;t realize how awful it was until I used someone else&#x27;s buzzer, so having a tool that actually cuts hair in one or two go-through&#x27;s is like a dream and I appreciate it all the more. Thank you! I recommend this product to beginners and amateurs, but I do not believe an expert or well-experienced stylist would want to use this product simply for the sake of how much it vibrates and how loud it is when using it. Other than that, this is a great product!</li>
    <li> Very good deal on a combo pro 14-piece hair clippers and price just fit into budget if you are looking to cut your our kids hair for the first time.</li>
    <li> Clipper broke 30 days after purchase.&lt;br /&gt;Wahl will fix for free.&lt;br /&gt;Clipper works A-1 when it works.&lt;br /&gt;For this price I ordered a second clipper to use as backup</li>
    <li> this product has been very useful to me,combs for lateral cuts with ascending height give me a professional finish quickly</li>
    <li> good morning, I just got my hands on the purchased product, excellent sending, excellent case in which the product but comes time to try and use the same will not start, I plugged into different outlets and no lights in the manual has no power specification, which causes discomfort and I buy to Venezuela and from here I find it more cost resend the product for exchange and manufacturer and seller giving the only solution is to forward the product</li>
    <li> The clipper, though cheap and light-weight, does not give a nice cut for my hair. I would have returned it but i threw away the carton when i received it thinking i would love the clipper. Unfortunately I&#x27;m stuck.</li>
    <li> Arrived broken...returning...seem like it would be a decent trimmer set for lightweight purposes if it hadn&#x27;t had broken teeth/blade</li>
    <li> I have had sideburns all my life. I have hated them all my life, but I can&#x27;t afford to get them removed twice a week. Last time I was getting a haircut I asked the hairdresser what I could do, and this was her recommendation. Now, at the age of 71, I no longer have sideburns. I found this an inexpensive and useful product. I noticed that one user said her son complained that it pulled his hair. Just for the record, it does not pull my hair. My guess is that either he has very thick hair, or else he is black and the back-and-forth on each hair strand between curled and flat is making his hair catch on the machinery. He might try using a curl relaxer to see if that stops the pulling. Anyway, I think this will be a good product for most people.</li>
    <li> The product came and smoked the first day i did not use it twice its sa sad that was a real con</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this set on my husband for about a year now, once every month. At $17 per haircut at the barber, one cut at home paid for the product. I&#x27;ve been very happy with the quality. Some points to keep in mind:&lt;br /&gt;- Be sure to oil the blades before every session. Use a small drop and spread it with the brush provided.&lt;br /&gt;- Very thick and long hair does get pulled if you try to cut too deep in one go. The solution is to lightly skim the clipper over thick hair multiple times, clipping off about 1/2 inch at a time.&lt;br /&gt;- I haven&#x27;t found it to be noisy, but it does vibrate a lot and will fatigue your hands if you hold it for a long time. My solution was to switch it off whenever I complete one section of hair and am surveying/combing the next one.</li>
    <li> Work great, lots of extras in the handy storage case. The clippers are easy to use and powerful. The cordless trimmer is a real plus too. The only thing I would like would be a cordless clipper, but every one I have tried has no power so I stick with corded models. $26 bucks and you can cut your own hair for years vs $20 for one hair cut. Sure the gang down to the barber shop is fun to see every couple weeks but that&#x27;s a lot of money in these times.</li>
    <li> horrid, couldn&#x27;t cut thru the hair of the dog!</li>
    <li> I always wanted to cut my own hair so I decided to give this product a try.Well I used for the first time and followed the directions it wasn&#x27;t to bad to do for the first time.As time goes by it will get easier to do takes getting use to.I enjoyed cutting my own hair.I highly recommend this product</li>
    <li> Rust on blades after two uses.</li>
    <li> works very good I just had my first hair cut</li>
    <li> GREAT PRICE, WORKS WELL, ATTACHMENTS GO ON EASILY, AND THE TRIMMER WORKS GREAT ON MY BEARD. ALL AROUND A DECENT PRODUCT</li>
    <li> Nothing special here.  No bells or whistles.  It does it&#x27;s job and I&#x27;m ok with that.  I do wish I paid a little more money to get the one that has the little lever that lets you adjust the trim.  This was a lightening deal that was ending within minutes, so I didn&#x27;t stop and think about what I did like about my previous ones.</li>
    <li> saves us money, comes with a case and protective sleeves for the big blade along with oil for the blades</li>
    <li> bought these to replace my old ones and love the case it comes in, has a cover to protect blade and a mini shaver for traveling. great product for the price.</li>
    <li> The trimmers are very very loud and the clippers don&#x27;t cut very well it would be best to buy the more costly ones you get what you pay for .</li>
    <li> Just what I needed to cut our hair,nice and sharp,no pinching,pulling,etc,  clean,and handy. fits my hand good so I don&#x27;t get tired  Thank You Wahl for the hair clippers,great price also  Joe Fisher</li>
    <li> The offer not really worth it .. The main hair clipper is very loud and smoke started coming in my first use may be after 2 min of running .. The small trimmer is working fine so far .. Since I dnt want spend more money to send it back am keep it and try to satisfy my self with item ..  May be in future I dnt prefer amazon ..  Let see</li>
    <li> For the price I love it. You can&#x27;t go wrong</li>
    <li> Mine didn&#x27;t smoke or anything like the other peoples&#x27; did, but I have the same basic recommendation which seems to be popular across the board.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t buy this off amazon. Don&#x27;t buy this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The clippers themselves for me, and it seems for others, worked for maybe 2 minutes before completely breaking down. It seems highly prone to overheating at low temperatures. No, it didn&#x27;t actually catch my hair, and no, I didn&#x27;t leave it on for 15 minutes straight. I actually know how to use these things. Proper use, and it won&#x27;t last more than 1 or 2 haircuts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The trimmer and guards are fine though. Oil is okay, small bottle. It&#x27;s nice. But not worth the price, as it is not what is advertised.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDIT: So I give this thing 3 stars now, instead of 1.  It seems I was wrong, it didn&#x27;t overheat, and it didn&#x27;t spontaneously die. It seems you just have to be rough with the power switch and \\&quot;snap\\&quot; it into the \\&quot;on\\&quot; position instead of pushing it into the \\&quot;on\\&quot; position. For some reason that I can&#x27;t figure out without tearing the thing apart, a greater velocity of power switch switching determines whether or not it actually turns on. This uniquely cheap but interesting mechanism is probably worth buying the product alone, though it isn&#x27;t what is advertised.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all though, the product functions as advertised, but with a questionably reliable power switch.</li>
    <li> EXCELENTE PRODUCTO ES LO QUE PEDÍ MUY RÁPIDO Y EFECTIVO FÁCIL DE USAR RECOMIENDO ESTE PRODUCTO GRACIAS BUEN PRECIO COMPRARE OTROS MAS ADELANTE</li>
    <li> excelent seller and product</li>
    <li> Case vibrates excessively making loud noises.  The motor on this model is not strong enough to smoothly and cleanly cut thick hair (eg. Asian hair) on the first pass.  It binds and pulls hair unless moving VERY slowly and leaves patches of uncut hair.  Based on the performance of the plug-in unit, I did not attempt the battery powered smaller cutter.</li>
    <li> Works great and arrived in a timely manner.</li>
    <li> excellent product for the price is very good has good strength and very good price is recommended, if used at home is fine</li>
    <li> I have other Wahl clippers. These are nowhere as nice as the others. I didn&#x27;t realize the trimmers can&#x27;t be used without being plugged in. All my others were. My fault for not checking the description thoroughly. That&#x27;s what tends to happen when you buy things on Amazon&#x27;s sale days. I didn&#x27;t want to miss the deal! Now I wish I would have.</li>
    <li> As described, not the best I&#x27;ve used but good for the price.</li>
    <li> Great equipment to maintain hair between stylist visits.</li>
    <li> Product works great.  I use it predominately for keeping my beard trimmed, but it&#x27;s also good for keeping my neck and around my ears trimmed up in between hair cuts.  I like the fact that it plugs into the wall.  Because of that there&#x27;s no lack of power.</li>
    <li> No me enviaron como aparece, vino un modelo sin tijera y sin caja para guardar. el estuche es un bolso</li>
    <li> I had a Conair and I had to keep tuning it to quiet if back down, so haircuts took a long time.&lt;br /&gt;Now I zipped through our six boys and a Dad.  I can even talk while cutting! I hope it&#x27;ll last.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll check back in with a year.</li>
    <li> Works great. My hubby loves it</li>
    <li> BROKE AFTER 1st USE..</li>
    <li> for family use is ideal, very good product</li>
    <li> I love Wahl products but I was not very impressed with this product.  There is no adjustable lever for the blades to bring up and down.  This is  truly just a basic kit with NO extras.  The small cutter is AWESOME!  I would of acually paid the price just for that piece.</li>
    <li> Great product, very low price. Highly recommend for dudes with beard - just be careful, a beard that is TOO NEATLY TRIMMED can give the wrong impression - that creeps me put as much as a unkempt matted beard-o.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband and son and it works just fine.  The price was fantastic! We&#x27;ll see how long it lasts!</li>
    <li> el producto llego en  excelentes condiciones, llego en el tiempo pactado y lleno mis expectativas sobre el producto. los recomiendo. very good</li>
    <li> impossible use in korea ,</li>
    <li> Very complete combo, good price, includes a pencil-like pouch, not a hard one like in the photo. my only complain is that you can adjust blades separation</li>
    <li> My husband is happy with this purchase. Exactly what product description said. Works well and does a very nice job.</li>
    <li> Excellent product. It is exactly as I bought it</li>
    <li> El producto y el tiempo de entrega cumplio al 100% mi expectativas. sin duda alguna volveria comprar. recomiendo hacer compras con este vendedor.</li>
    <li> I had this machine from a few months ago and is really good. So far I had no problems with it and is a good quality item, once you have all the pieces on the bag it&#x27;s really practical to travel with it</li>
    <li> Cheaply made but cuts. Well kind of anyways</li>
