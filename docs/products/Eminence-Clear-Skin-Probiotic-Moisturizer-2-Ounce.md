<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This stuff has made my skin break out very badly.. I had no problems before using the stuff.  Threw it in the garbage... Again - another product where the packaging does NOT look anything like what they sell at my salon.. I don&#x27;t trust that it&#x27;s the real thing</li>
    <li> This was my second Emenience purchase and like the first purchase (Poppy and Pear Microdermabrasion) the product didn&#x27;t disappoint. I recently switched birth control and as a result, I have been experiencing hormonal breakouts. I browsed around online and read great things from Emeniece&#x27;s Care Skin Probiotic Line. I have a few cleansers in rotation, so I knew I didn&#x27;t need the Probiotic cleanser, but I was hopeful that the moisturizer would live up to the hype. When I got home from work (around 4:30) I quickly washed my face and then applied the moisturizer. I immediately noticed a tingling sensation that lasted about 30 seconds and then went away. Around 9 pm I went upstairs to do a proper cleanse to completely get rid of any makeup from earlier and I could already tell a difference in the appearance of my blemishes. I&#x27;m not going to lie to you and say that in a few hours my zits were totally clear, but the texture if my skin looked better than it had in about 2 months. I&#x27;ve been using this moisturizer once or twice a day for about a week now and my hormonal breakouts are almost completely gone. I know it&#x27;s a bit pricey, but I think it&#x27;s worth it considering how much money I&#x27;ve spent in the past on products that didn&#x27;t deliver.</li>
    <li> I have tried other brands of moisturizers which leave my face like I have moisturizer on! This moisturizer is very light to the skin but does its thing all day long! Would highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> This is by far one of the best products for oily skin. It will last a very long time as you only need just little.</li>
    <li> I have acne from being on fertility drugs and this moisturizer has helped immensely. The acne was getting noticeably worse through time and when I started using this moisturizer, it seemed to slow the growth of new pimples. I would buy again! It has a tingly sensation when applied, which is refreshing. I only apply it during the day. Even though I have some ace, my skin is pretty dehydrated and this is not heavy enough for night use on my skin.</li>
    <li> This was a lifesaver for my skin! I bought it because I am pregnant and could not use my usual acne medication and I use it along with the probiotic cleanser and it is GREAT. Cleared up my skin pretty well and my face is never oily or dry anymore (I have combination skin). I use to have oily skin by the end of the work day but not anymore! Definitely worth the money if you have tried other things only for them not to work!</li>
    <li> Seems to be a bit watery.  I am a user of this product and will not purchase from amazon again.  Will pay the higher price at the spa.</li>
    <li> This light creamy face cream feels a bit tingly to me. I like to wet my hands a little first then apply all over. I chosed this moisturizer since having clear even skin tone is my main concern. On a bad day I&#x27;m red due to extractions &amp; acne scars, so if the ingredients are as helpful as eminence says they are, then I&#x27;m in good shape with this face cream.</li>
    <li> By far, the best moisturizer I&#x27;ve ever used. I&#x27;m on RetinA and deal with acne issues. This product feels so good and nourishing, especially on my dry days. Smells good, not greasy. Skin is so much clearer.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t expect that I would be able to received the products right away.  In the package, there was a sample which I thought its nice so the client can get to know the other products of Eminence.  There was also a piece of chocolate included which I ended up eating first before even looking up the products :-)  Overall, I&#x27;m very satisfied.  Can&#x27;t wait to try the products and see how its going to work on my face.</li>
    <li> I recently had a facial, and the aesthetician used this product. My skin tingled (in a good way), as if it was starving and finally was able to \\&quot;eat.\\&quot; I know that sounds like a weird description, but my skin was starving for a good product, and this is the one! I only use it at night (because I use a moisturizer with an SPF during the day),and every night I look forward to putting this on my skin. A little goes a long way--thankfully, because it&#x27;s pricey. But definitely worth it.</li>
    <li> It makes my skin feeling fresh and and I can feel the organic ingredients tingling in my skin. That&#x27;s when I know it&#x27;s working. I&#x27;ve been using this for a while for my scars and acne, and it has been so much better than using my own home ingredients from honey, lemon, and sugar. This stuff has actual ingredients that target the acne and the scars, lightening the scars and controlling the acne. I love this stuff.</li>
    <li> Item was described perfectly! This product works great for my skin!</li>
    <li> Refreshing product for sensitive skin.  I use a tinted moisturizer during the day, but this is my night product. Nongreasy, skin feels great in the am</li>
    <li> Amazing! nice scent! Gives your face a soft tingle and it is working on my dry skin and forehead! Love this!</li>
    <li> Moisturizes while minimizing acne issues. Great skin shield from the environment too.</li>
    <li> Nice lightweight moisturizer that helps to keep breakouts in check!  I have normal/combination skin and live in New England so it&#x27;s been a very dry and cold winter, so by itself this moisturizer wasn&#x27;t as hydrating as I need for the harsh winter season.  However, I do use it nightly with the rest of the Eminence Clear Skin line, then in the morning I use the Bright Skin or Red Currant moisturizer with SPF 30 (sun screen is non-negotiable to keep our skin beautiful, ladies!).  This combination of AM vs PM moisturizers gives my skin the PERFECT balance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If my skin does seem like its heading towards a breakout, I will use this Clear Skin Moisturizer in both the AM and PM.  I am 35 and almost 8 moths pregnant, making my skin susceptible to hormonal changes, so I try to follow the dynamics the best I can.  This moisturizer is perfect for hormonal changes that increase breakouts while being refreshing and non-greasy!</li>
    <li> This is a good, skin clearing product.  It&#x27;s a little light for me, I layer a serum with it since i use this as my night cream.  But anyone with oily skin (not simply combination) should find it to be a great weight.  It doesn&#x27;t have the nearly edible scent of more eufora products but it&#x27;s also not offensive.</li>
    <li> Really works well. I can tell when I run out.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I wanted.</li>
    <li> NOT THE REAL PRODUCT. Arrived with seal broken. Eminence products have seals firmly affixed and difficult to remove, not just laying on top. Usually buy Eminence products from local spa, but thought would try this because so much cheaper. TOO GOOD TO BE TRUE. Different scent and texture from real product- I compared to what I have at home. The real deal is awesome. I love Eminence. This product is not it. Returning mine, along with the other 2 &amp;#34;Eminence&amp;#34; products I purchased.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff.  It feels so good on my skin and its amazing!</li>
    <li> i wanted to like this cream , i have a normal-oily skin the cream is good nothing amazing it won&#x27;t change skin tone or texture at least for me .It feels good but a bit greasy sometimes and the feeling of the mint- eucalyptus is something i don&#x27;t like  too much i like the fact that is organic but a bit expensive i prefer suki line  is organic and more effective in results.</li>
    <li> Still noticed that I break out with this product. My face is super sensitive, so was hopeful this product would do OK on my skin. Others might have success but this isn&#x27;t for me.</li>
    <li> This is disgusting! How could they send me lotion whose seal has CLEARLY been opened before?? What are they playing at?</li>
    <li> Took the risk even though many have mentioned packaging complaints but as others have mentioned, mine arrived with no outer seal, and the inner seal was stuck in the cap. When it came loose, it was all bent and wrinkled, as if someone had taken it off prior. The smell was slightly funny, but I&#x27;m not sure if that&#x27;s normal. I tried it just to see, and it was very sticky on my face. Other reviewers said it was the best feeling lotion they ever used. I&#x27;m pretty sure mine was old/used or both. Returned ASAP and going to order from a more reliable source.</li>
    <li> I like the tingling sensation I feel after putting it on. It also has a (very minor) exfoliating effect; every night I use it, I wake up the next day feeling like a thin layer of dead skin came off. My skin looks more radiant in the morning. Also, my acne issues are minimal, so if you have serious acne challenges, you may need a stronger product.</li>
    <li> Good product! Non greasy! Fresh scent. Fresh sensation. Makes your face feel soft and significantly helps with reducing redness and inflammation! Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> great moisturizer.. i love all my eminence products!!</li>
    <li> Great product! Really cleared my skin up, and hasn&#x27;t irritated my skin at all. I love the texture and smell.</li>
    <li> Works great, and is helping clear my skin of acne.</li>
    <li> First of all, I love the Eminence skin care line, so when I came upon this moisturizer I had to give it a try.  I have a slight acne problem, and ever since I started using this I breakout much much less. It&#x27;s the only moisturizer that does not leave me oily at the end of the day which was always the case.  It&#x27;s expensive, but definitely worth it! :)</li>
    <li> I have been using the Eminence product line since September and I love it. I have acne prone combination skin and have been trying to find a product that doesnt make my skin more oily. The moisturizer has worked for the winter weather. I will have to see how it goes in the summer</li>
    <li> Was as stated and her 3rd order so I know she likes it!!</li>
    <li> This moisturizer works excellent so far. My face acne is beginning to heal and it leaves a conditioned yet matte finish... So is great for combination/oily complexions. Only sad part is seller didn&#x27;t package well and when I revived the product some had leaked out :( this is horrible considering the high expense. Please package and seal it better!!!!!</li>
    <li> I have used several Eminence moisturizers and have loved them all, except for this probiotic moisturizer. After successful experiences with the whip moisturizers, I thought I’d branch out and try the probiotic. Like with other Eminence moisturizers, my skin feels soft and smooth after application, but since using this product I&#x27;ve have incredible breakouts all over my face. I gave it a couple weeks to see if it was due to this product or other factors, but my skin has only gotten worse. I have fair, sensitive skin and this has been one of the worst product reactions I&#x27;ve experienced. Returning immediately and switching back to Eminence apricot or persimmon moisturizers which have been divine and caused no breakouts.</li>
    <li> I love this product. I use very little per use. I dilute one dab with water and cover my face with a very thin layer. It moisturizes but does not leave my face shiny. Also, it works on my complexion that is sometimes blotchy and uneven with small blemishes.</li>
    <li> For being organic this really is the best moisturizer i have ever use! absorbs right away and keeps my face shine free all day! which is something i cant say about any moisturizer! I usually use products that are made for oil and this really is better than any of them! I would recommend this to anyone who has occasional break outs or oily skin, it gentle yet effective!</li>
    <li> I love everything from Eminence. When I was pregnant with my son, my face broke out like crazy! After trying different lines, I had my facial girl tell me to try this Clear Skin line by Eminence, and I have never gone back. I use the Clear Skin wash, the spot correcting serum, and this moisturizer. The combination has done wonders for my skin. I will never go back to anything else.</li>
    <li> The seal was broken which makes me suspect the product is not an original Eminence product.</li>
    <li> The lotion is a bit thick, and can cause a little bit of a break out.</li>
    <li> Between this and the peel I bought my face is clear, smooth and almost poreless! Breakouts are under control too.</li>
    <li> best moisturizer I&#x27;ve tried. I love how tight it makes my skin feel.</li>
    <li> I had a facial in a spa with other Eminence products and enjoyed how they felt.  I was soo excited to get this and try it.  It has not helped any with the acne and has also caused itching.  I stopped using it for a week and tried again just to verify that this was the culprit.  The itching came back.  Didn&#x27;t notice any redness, but there was a slight rash. It really makes my skin feel so smooth, so I am very sad that I wasn&#x27;t able to use it more.</li>
    <li> The seal was just laying on top of the jar which made me nervous. The product seemed okay, it looks like many people have this problem maybe it is the way the product is packaged?</li>
    <li> Great all day moisturizer, no breakouts or heaviness with this product. It is light and a little goes a long way. Just wish it had spf in it.</li>
    <li> Really enjoy this mask. Leaves a cooling feeling on the face and makes my face feel clean. I have severely acne-prone skin, and while I don&#x27;t know if it helps, it definitely does not make me break out.</li>
    <li> Great moisturizer. Wonderful cooling sensation after application. Non-comedogenic.</li>
    <li> I totally agree with Busy Mom.  This is not the real product.  I have previously bought my products from a spa.  Not only was it not sealed, but the consistency and scent is not there.  I thought I would try the product through Amazon because of the price, but I will NOT order again.  Disappointed.</li>
    <li> Do not buy eminence if you have adult acne. This product made my face worse.</li>
    <li> I got a sample of this from an actual Eminence boutique and I loved how light it was. However, after purchasing this moisturizer off of Amazon, I noticed that it goes on thicker and dries in such a way that leaves my skin feeling very tight. I wasn&#x27;t sure what was going on so my friend (who bought the same moisturizer from the boutique) gave me a weeks worth of hers and definitely my skin does not have that taut, sticky feeling that the one I purchased from this site is leaving.</li>
    <li> This is a great product. But being used to the others in the Eminence line that smell so good you could eat them, I was disappointed. It smelled a little medicinal...</li>
    <li> Like that you can add drops of water to thin as needed. A bit pricey for what it is but like it. Feels good on skin! Great smell!</li>
    <li> Happy to find this on amazon. Estitian introduced me to this and I love it! Light, non-greasy, tingles when first goes on. Perfectly balanced, non-greasy, non-drying. Love that is organic and good for me.</li>
    <li> This really helps my skin so much - eminence is literally the only skin care line I can use on my skin now without breaking out.</li>
    <li> Recommended by an esthetician, it does what it needs to do.</li>
    <li> Perfect for my combination facial skin.  I&#x27;m 40 and at times my face breaks out especially around the lips and chin.  My esthetician recommended this organic produce. I totally love it. It has a tingly minty feeling.  It doesn&#x27;t  take much to cover the face and neck.  And also lightens facial scars.  I&#x27;ve used it for the past year. In fact,all the Eminence products are highly recommended.  Totally safe.  You just have to find that combination that works for you.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t say I&#x27;ve seen any noticeable changes in my skin, but I am definitely pleased with this moisturizer. It absorbs into the skin quickly and hydrates my face overnight.</li>
    <li> Good moisturizer for acne prone skin. Leaves skin feeling refreshed and soft.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing!</li>
    <li> This is one of my favorite items that Eminence makes.  It feels amazing on my skin, I use the cleanser as well. There really is nothing better for acne prone skin.</li>
    <li> My skin feels refreshed, clean and soft after applying. During the summer, I use it both morning and night. In the winter, I recommend using this as a day cream and a more moisturizing cream at night. That&#x27;s only because my skin tends to dry out quite a bit in the winter weather!</li>
    <li> I tried this lotion last night before bed, and immediately I was sold on this product, has a \\&quot;cooling\\&quot; feel as its soaking into my skin, felt tingly, which I personally like that feeling.  My only slight con: It does smell a bit medicinal, so some people may not like that smell, but it doesn&#x27;t bother me too much personally.</li>
    <li> I bought this item at retail stores before so that I know that there should be a manufacturer seal.  The manufacturer also advises to discard remaining product if open for more than 6 months.  The product is not sealed and it is a huge issue to me: I don&#x27;t know if it has been used and returned, and I don&#x27;t know how long it has been opened.  I gave it to a friend who is willing to risk her skin for a potentially expired product.  This is the last time I buy skin care products from Amazon.</li>
    <li> Great moisturizer! I have sensitive skin and this is the only product that has helped me through my dry days. I am also prone to acne and I have felt as of this probiotic moisturizer also helps with that.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this moisturizer!  It leaves your skin soft and smooth and free of break-outs.  Great on sensitive skin.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I tried this product out of desperation when some medication I was taking caused my skin to break out and a dermatologist suggested a  $1500 treatment plan plus $80/month prescription topical cream.  I moved to the entire Eminence VitaSkin line as a last ditch effort before spending a fortune with the Derm.  I&#x27;m on my second container and won&#x27;t use any other cream.  People complement me on my skin now and I have my confidence back.</li>
    <li> Love love love this!!!</li>
    <li> I like this moisturizer.  It smells pretty nice and feels really refreshing and cooling.</li>
    <li> This is one of the nicest moisturizers I&#x27;ve used. It absorbs quickly and feels great. It has a nice fresh scent as well.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m used to these products coming sealed and this one had no deal and seemed used. Is it safe to use??</li>
    <li> I have been using this for over a year.  I saw great improvements with first jar. I will buy again.</li>
    <li> This is the only cream that keeps my face balanced and clear. I love this stuff. Worth every single penny.</li>
    <li> This is a great moisturizer! I have acne-prone skin and I&#x27;ve experienced far fewer breakouts since using this (even while pregnant). The container is small but using it twice a day lasts about 6 months so I really feel like I get a good value. Before applying I get my finger tips a little damp, quickly dab the water on my face, and then use a little moisturizer. I have to use a little more in the winter with the extreme dryness we experience in the upper Midwest.</li>
    <li> I have been introduced to Eminence line of organic skin care products in salon I went for my facials and body care.  They exclusively carry Eminence line and use them on their clients.  Initially I really enjoyed the aromatherapy these products have.  Stone crop mist for example leave one relaxed long after treatment is done.  My skin is occasionally prone to breakouts so esthetician recommended I use probiotic line moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Probiotic diet is so popular these days, that just the name of the product prompted me to use it.  I was very pleasantly surprised.  I used product in the evenings only (it does not have SPF so I did not use it during daytime).  Product is very light and not greasy at all.  Skin absorbs it immediately.  Fragrance is also pleasing and one feels good going to bed with such cream on the face.  For me, the best part is in the morning.  In the shower, one can feel face so smooth and soft it is as if I just applied cream on the face.  Not to mention that over time, my skin completely cleared and pores became smaller.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I became devoted follower of this skin care line.  Not only is it beneficial for one&#x27;s skin (it is completely organic), but the company that makes it cares about the environment.  They package their products carefully and all of the containers can dissolve into the earth.  They also plant trees.  I have tried other products made by this company and enjoyed them all.  One of the rare product lines that really made me happy every time I picked up anything to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is not available in department stores and can be found ony in the salons that are authorized dealers for this product line, or on Amazon through online sellers.  Amazon is definitely worth using for purchases of the product.  Often times, price is better compared to the prices in the retail stores.  Some Amazon sellers ship products for  free.  Seller I purchased product from was very generous and enclosed sample for Eminence eye care product (lavender), which I tried and it is sublime!re product (lavender), which I tried and it is sublime!</li>
    <li> The seal was broken and there was crusty yellow around the edges I would return it but packaging got thrown away, it&#x27;s not the same product I&#x27;ve gotten from my salon</li>
    <li> I love this it stop my skin from ageing I am 54 and my skin looks 35 Highly recomend it</li>
    <li> I am 30 and have mild rosacea and acne-prone skin. This moisturizer did not help with my acne. I also don&#x27;t think it made my skin feel or look awesome either, which is what all the other Eminence products do that i&#x27;ve used. There were no noticeable changes after using this for over a month.</li>
    <li> I have adult acne and oily/combination skin, so I was looking for something that would not clog up the pores. This is an outstanding cosmetic line that is not tested on animals (I am a huge animal fan) and still does the job of moisturizing and clearing the skin. I would recommend using it with the other probiotic products of the same brand to get the best results. Eminence is the only product I will use from now on.</li>
    <li> And won&#x27;t use anything else. It takes a little time to get used to using so little product, but it makes it last longer and it&#x27;s not as effective if you use too much. I love the way it smells and how it glides on my skin. Works great with preventing inflammation. I apply my herbal spot serum on problem areas after, and when I know I will be out and about I use a small amount of persimmon and cantaloupe day cream.</li>
    <li> I am really enjoying this cream even though its smell first seemed somewhat awful to me. In fact, if you try to analyze what you are smelling you will recognize some of the ingredients : cucumber, tea tree oil, etc. and honestly I&#x27;d rather have it smell this way, than be full of perfume. Overall nice cream. The only minus is the packaging - it was very hacky, unorderly, and the the seal was off. I&#x27;d say the company needs to invest a little into better packaging. I would not mind paying extra 50 cents for it, so that I don&#x27;t have to feel uncertain about the product origins when it arrives.</li>
    <li> I really like that this is natural. The tea tree helps with acne. This lotion feels cooling to me but it could b irritating to really sensitive skin at 1st I suppose. It lasts me a couple months using it twice a day and it is way way cheaper on Amazon than at a salon. I&#x27;d give it 5 stars if they put it in a pump because u gotta open it then wash ur hands the apply it or use a disposable spoon or popsicle stick to keep germs out if it what a pain!&lt;br /&gt; I use this along with PCA&#x27;s 5% Benzoyl Peroxide wash (recommended by a dermatologist &amp; is great) and Murads Anti Acne Anti Aging serum (that is the one product that makes the biggest difference in my adult acne-if I run out of that serum I break out. This lotion complements those products nicely and moisturizers without causing breakouts or using parabens:)</li>
    <li> I was skeptical about this product, until my esthetician gave me samples to try.  I noticed an immediate improvement of the texture of my skin.</li>
    <li> Love love love the smell of this Eminence product!&lt;br /&gt;Works great too</li>
    <li> I love this lotion it is by far the best I have Ever used and it makes my skin do smooth and it is non greasy. It really has been good on my oily skin and it calms the redness on my face. This will be my life moisturizer!</li>
    <li> For the reviews on here that say &amp;#34;it doesn&#x27;t do much to clear up acne&amp;#34;, that statement is kind of misleading. Clearing up acne takes work and no one can rely solely on a moisturizer to clear up acne. Hopefully my background can give a better picture for those struggling with acne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I was 21, I started breaking out specifically around my jaw line. Everyone told me it was hormonal. I started off with Proactiv, then went to harsher products. These small acne spots eventually turned into huge cysts on my jawline and neck. It was so embarrassing. I was using extra strength creams to clear up the spots, but all it was doing was drying my skin out with these harsh chemicals. I would look in the mirror and realize the skin around my eyes was pulling because everything was so dry. I then started trying different combinations of birth control to see if hormones would clear it up, also a bad idea, and it never worked. I finally stopped doing anything chemical. It wasn&#x27;t until I moved in with my best friend that she noticed her hair was really drying out (a problem I was having as well but never noticed because of my face). We ended up getting a shower filter for the shower head and thus began the road to clear skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Along with the shower head, I got a new pillow and pillowcase (7, so I change it every night- your pillow carries so much bacteria!!) I only started washing my face with the shower water. And another thing was I threw out all these chemical products and started using natural stuff. I started off as using baking soda for an exfoliant and apple cider vinegar as a toner. I never really understood the point of these products until I started researching and I NEVER used a moisturizer before. All that changed when I got a facial using Eminence products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My facialist told me that toners are important because it restores the pH of the skin. I did some research and found that the acid mantle of the skin, the pH is normally around 5, and when we cleanse with a soap, generally it raises the pH to about 7. This imbalance can create irritation and lead to break outs, a natural toner can bring the pH back down and prep your skin for a serum or moisturizer. I have never before used a moisturizer, and honestly I can say after using this product, I not only notice a huge difference in my skin&#x27;s oil production, but I have significantly less breakouts than when I&#x27;m not using it. That&#x27;s crazy to me! My skin literally drinks this stuff up. It&#x27;s amazing and yes it pricey, but it&#x27;s worth every penny. This would go in my &amp;#34;I can&#x27;t live without this&amp;#34; pile. Once at an airport, they almost, *almost* took it away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Right now my skin care routine is:&lt;br /&gt;Wash morning and night with the Eminence Probiotic Cleanser (about every 2-3 days I also sprinkle a little of the Strawberry Rhubarb Exfoliant, or baking soda to exfoliate all dead skin)&lt;br /&gt;Tone morning and night using 1 part apple cider vinegar and 1 park filtered water and 25 drops of lavender essential oil&lt;br /&gt;At night I use a home made serum (1 tbsp jojoba oil, 12 drops lemon essential oil, 12 drops tea tree oil, 12 drops of frankincense oil)&lt;br /&gt;During the day I use Andalou Pure Pore Serum Willow Bark, (whole foods for 22$)&lt;br /&gt;Finish with this moisturizer both day and night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With this routine (and my shower head filter!) my skin only has 1 or 2 breakouts around my period, it&#x27;s not perfect, but I can deal with that!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve also noticed the scars and the red marks has significantly decreased and I think that&#x27;s due to the essential oils and this moisturizer!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great great stuff, give it a try :)5, and when we cleanse with a soap, generally it raises the pH to about 7.

    <li> This made my break outs worse.  It did soften my skin and take care of some dry patches.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never had a moisturizer that felt so good on my face.... it hasn&#x27;t cleared up my acne yet but from what I&#x27;ve seen it doesn&#x27;t cause breakouts. I&#x27;ve never had a moisturizer that didn&#x27;t cause breakouts and was JUST the right amount of hydration. (to the point where u don&#x27;t feel greesy At all. anyone that rated this moisturizer below a 5 needs to be slapped. nuff said.</li>
    <li> My skin started to feel very dry and thirsty after using this.  Upset I spent the money!  I&#x27;m going back to Clinique.</li>
    <li> Great moisturizer, not greasy at all and leaves my face feeling smooth. My only complaint is the medicinal smell. It&#x27;s not pleasant at all, but fades away quickly. I may however try a moisturizer with SPF for day time during the summer and only use this at night.</li>
    <li> I have sensitive, acne-prone skin, so I had hoped that this would be my saving grace.  The moisturizer is light and greaseless, which I liked.  It didn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin at all.  The probiotic part, however, didn&#x27;t seem to help prevent breakouts.  I recommend this for a quality moisturizer, but don&#x27;t hold on to hopes that it will clear up your acne.</li>
    <li> Will not ever go a day without this stuff! My skin does not take well to anything with glycolic acid after a few days of use eventhough I love the smoothing&amp;glowy skin glycolic acid provides, so I bought this to see if it compares. It does! The smallest bit goes a very long way&amp;leaves my skin moisturized, smooth, and clear of blemishes. I love that I can use this in the morning before makeup application, too. It absorbs beautifully into the skin without being greasy and leaves a smooth base before makeup.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product 4 months now and I love it. I have acne prone, mixed skin so it is great esp for the winter months. Will have to see how it does the summer</li>
    <li> Thank you!  I have been using Eminence products for the last 6 months and completely love them.  My skin is looking great!</li>
    <li> This is truly the best moisturizer that I have ever tried. It is hydrating enough to help me avoid dry skin, we live in the desert so this is really a problem. Yet it is not greasy or heavy at all. I actually find that the days that I emit it from my routine, that my skin feels more oily and I am more prone to breakouts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I apply the moisturizer I dilute it just a bit by wetting the fingers on one hand and then putting a small amount of product on the forefinger of my dry hand. Then I rub them together and then onto my face. Just enough for my skin!</li>
    <li> This is moisturizing without leaving me greasy. It also doesn&#x27;t feel tight or dry like some clear skin moisturizers do. I like the minty tingly feeling I get when I first put it on.  FYI, I have combination to oily skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t have bad breakouts before but this seem to be keeping the occasional problems at bay for the most part. I bought it for it mostly for it&#x27;s silky feel and because it&#x27;s all natural.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wouldn&#x27;t expect it to clear up very troubled skin but it will not cause a breakout.</li>
    <li> I used this moisturizer along with the other items in the clear skin line for a few months and my acne is worse than it was before I started using it.</li>
    <li> I have been using the cleanser and moisturizer for about six months and I love it. At first I was concerned because I still had some blemishes appear (maybe about a month), but now clear skin all the time. This is a great product, and I love that it keeps acne away without the usual harsh chemicals.</li>
    <li> I am pushing 50. When I am starting to get a little breakout I use this lotion and it gets it under control before it&#x27;s too late. I mix a little mineral makeup in with it to make a liquid foundation.  Works great.</li>
    <li> My aesthetician recommended this and I&#x27;ve been using it ever since. I have very sensitive skin and my poor nose has had multiple MOHs surgeries as well as scar revision surgery, and this moisturizer is soothing, with no irritation and no offensive odor. Of course I buy it now from amazon and not the place I get my micropeel facials, but price and convenience are worth a lot.</li>
    <li> The results of smoother skin texture is visible immediately. Great product!</li>
    <li> This is a great moisturizer once your skin gets used to it. I started using this and the cleanser right away twice a day and started getting some serious dry patches around my mouth (it&#x27;s hard to prevent the cleanser getting everywhere). I reduced the cleanser to once a day and was careful to only use the moisturizer on my skin. After that, the dryness went away and it&#x27;s keeping my skin clear.</li>
    <li> Received the wrong item</li>
    <li> I generally love Eminence products - this moisturizer did nothing to improve my acne prone skin - although it does feel very refreshing going on - and still left it somewhat dry. I way prefer the Stone Crop moisturizer, although it is not expressly for acne prone skin, I find that if my skin is hydrated it isn&#x27;t as oily.</li>
    <li> Purchased this after it was shown on the Today Show and I love it.  It smells great and leaves your face feeling soft.  Looking forward to trying additional products.</li>
    <li> Is great! this is the third time I&#x27;ve ordered it. I had very bad acne and constantly am going between florida and new york. This works great in the humidity of florida and the dryness of a bad winter. Def recommend it</li>
    <li> I have combination skin that is dry/oily by turns and depending on what time of day it is. As a result, most face products clog my pores and make me break out, or conversely make my skin taut, dry, and itchy. This moisturizer is perfect for me though; not too heavy and not too light. I use it mostly at night, but sometimes during the day when I feel more dry, under the persimmon cantaloupe SPF cream. I use it right after I wash my face, when it is still damp. A little goes a long way when there is already moisture on your face. My skin has never been this clear, this consistently. I am using it with the mineral cleansing concentrate face wash, and occasionally the strawberry rhubarb dermafoliant, and I love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also has a nice fresh cucumber scent and doesn&#x27;t have harsh chemicals. People always recommended products with salicylic acid or other drying agents in them because my skin gets oily, but they made the oiliness even worse along with my acne. This is very gentle and balancing.</li>
    <li> Great lotion.  The scent is fabulous.  Skin feels refreshed when using</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m updating this review to be a little more thorough as I have tried the line a second time.  I have incredibly fair, sensitive skin that burns if I&#x27;m in direct sun for more than five minutes. Mild acne has followed me into adulthood, and even worse, I don&#x27;t leave my skin alone all the time like I should.  I have tried Eminence Clear Skin Probiotic twice now, and twice it has made my skin break out worse. I don&#x27;t necessarily blame the product, my skin just doesn&#x27;t take to any beauty concoctions as well as it does to healthy eating, not touching my skin, regular exercise, and using do-it-yourself natural cleansers and moisturizers at home with minimal ingredients.  Although none of their products have worked for me, I have increased the stars because I believe the company does use better ingredients than that of store bought products and they are truly trying to share healthy skin with their customers. What I did like about this product is that it isn&#x27;t made or sold in large batches, which should help keep freshness! I&#x27;m pretty paranoid about the freshness of any beauty product, whether in the store or online. You just don&#x27;t know how long something has been sitting and in what temperature conditions. So kudos to this company for doing their part to try and keep freshness! You also don&#x27;t need to use much, so while it is a small batch, it should last you, which is why you want fresh! :)  If I were to keep buying into the industry, I&#x27;d probably stick with companies like Eminence or Origins, which use better and more unobstructed ingredients, but the best thing for me is none of them. Diet, exercise, and diy home concoctions are my answer to healthy, young looking skin.  For some this line will be gold, for others like myself, not so much. I say you have to try it for yourself, reviews on beauty products can only take you so far because your skin is not the same as the reviewer&#x27;s.  Good luck to all you ladies and gents trying to find the fountain of youth and clear skin.</li>
    <li> Feels great.  Just as good as some of the very expensive moisturizers I have used in the past.</li>
    <li> I really wanted this product to work for my acne prone skin, but after 6 weeks, I have to conclude it is not for me.  I like the texture of this product, the way it feels on my skin, and the overall philosophy of Eminence, but apparently my skin require a different solution.</li>
    <li> I think its expired, not as potent/effective as what I Purchased at the spa.</li>
    <li> Light moisturizer, very refreshing.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve purchased this product before at a salon and loved it.  The product I purchased through Amazon seemed different.  First, the seal was broken when it arrived and some leakage had occurred.  And the product feels different on my face, sort of tacky like a mask which wasn&#x27;t the case with my first purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m disappointed because it&#x27;s hard for me to find a product that works for me and given this experience, I won&#x27;t buy this again.</li>
    <li> THIS IS A GREAT DAILY MOISTURIZER FOR OILY SKIN, NON GREASY AND DOES NOT CAUSE PIMPLES. DOES NOT DRY YOUR SKIN EITHER</li>
    <li> This moisturizer rocks. My skin is much more hydrated, but does not feel greasy at all. Definitely a product I will continue to use.</li>
    <li> Love this moisturizer!  I have been using this for over a year and love it!</li>
    <li> I really like this stuff. It&#x27;s very light, and it has a wonderful cooling, soothing effect. It certainly doesn&#x27;t clog pores or cause any problems, but it also seems only minimally effective in managing acne. However, as a moisturizer and soother for troubled skin, it is perfect.</li>
    <li> I meant to order the masque so I&#x27;ll reorder that item, but I really like this product. Feels great</li>
    <li> Excellent product!! Eminence is the best......</li>
    <li> Product might be great, but i ordered the mask and got the moisturizer. :-/</li>
    <li> Love this moisturizer. Not sticky or heavy, it&#x27;s perfect for combination or hormonal skin.  I&#x27;ve used it all through my pregnancy and my face has remained glowing and radiant, helping balance any hormonal changes on my skin.  Will continue using it from now on.</li>
    <li> I LOVE eminence, but this moisturizer is just okay. i have problem skin and it hasn&#x27;t helped at all after two months.</li>
    <li> This is a great moisturizer, it leaves my skin feeling hydrated and non-greasy. I have noticed fewer breakouts since using it.</li>
    <li> LOVE IT!!! This is a great moisturizer i love it not only because it&#x27;s an organic product but also because it doesn&#x27;t leave your face oily or anything it&#x27;s so fresh on your face, feels like you&#x27;re feeding your skin. My skin glows and stays hydrated throughout the day.</li>
    <li> bought for my 25 year old - she loves this and asked for it again for her b-day.&lt;br /&gt;She has breakouts and said this is perfect for moisturizing but not causing zits.</li>
    <li> Love this moisturizer. It has a minty like fresh tingle when first applied. My skins soaks it up fast, and doesn&#x27;t become oily later in the day... It&#x27;s not a heavy moisturizer, but good for every day. It&#x27;s only been a few weeks, but no signs of causing any irritations that may cause acne. Ans I wear an SPF over it, still not too thick.</li>
</ol>
