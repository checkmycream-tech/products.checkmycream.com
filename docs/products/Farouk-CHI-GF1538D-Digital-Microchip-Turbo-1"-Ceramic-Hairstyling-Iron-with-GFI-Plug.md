      <li>I love this product!  </li>
      <li>I still love it though!</li>
      <li>Over all it is better than any straightener that i have ever bought!</li>
      <li>All my friends like to come over to use it too because it is better than all of their hair straighteners!</li>
      <li>I love this straightener!  </li>
      <li>I decided to purchase this product for the first time  after seeing the results on my best friend&#x27;s hair.</li>
      <li>Love the fact that it can straighten or curl!</li>
      <li>I have ahd this CHI since 2004 and it still looks like it is brand new and works perfect!  </li>
      <li>I use that setting because it seems faster and more effective.</li>
      <li>Even after a year of frequent use and a lot of wear and tear, it continues to work perfectly and heat up to 350 in under 2 minutes.</li>
      <li>It has made my hair so beautiful and straight.</li>
      <li>I love the temperature gauge on this Chi.</li>
      <li>(yet you also have to make sure to turn it on, not just plug it in.  </li>
      <li>I love the guards that keep me from smacking the plates together</li>
      <li>Does it work on most people&#x27;s hair?</li>
      <li>I get better results with this straightner if I let it sit for 10 to 20 minutes before I begin to use it</li>

      <li>It took forever to recieve it because i used the free supersaver shipping, which i will never do again!</li>
      <li>ok so I ordered this iron in 2009.</li>
      <li>Love it.</li>
      <li>I love this straightener.</li>
      <li>A bit bulky but the heat adjustment settings more than make up for the inconvenience.</li>
      <li>The best part is the digital thermonitor.</li>
      <li>I love how shiny it leaves my hair.</li>
      <li>My sister uses it more than I do now since I have given up trying to straighten my hair.   </li>
      <li>I still think Chi Flat Irons are the best you can buy! :)</li>
      <li>I have beautiful soft silky hair after I use it.</li>
      <li>But the product itself was pretty good, if you dont use a heat protector or the oil product that chi sells then it doesnt straighten as well.</li>
      <li>It has not damaged my hair as much as I thought it would, so I think this was a really good buy :)</li>
      <li>and I loved it so much that I had to buy another.  </li>
      <li>Compared to my original curling iron that I have used for over 10 years I found the CHI to work faster and better</li>
      <li>It was not as smooth on my hair, and my hair kept getting stuck between the plate and the handle.</li>
      <li>I bought a cheap one and used that until the \\&quot;ceramic\\&quot; coating disappeared and it started pulling all my hair out.</li>
      <li>Does it stay product free clean?</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s totally worth it to buy this product, though!  </li>
      <li>I love how hot it gets</li>
      <li>Well worth the money!</li>
      <li>But if used with the product and straightened in small sections then it works beautifully!</li>
      <li>My original Chi stopped working after a couple of years</li>
      <li>I bought this digital one after my Original Chi&#x27;s  (which I loved) switch</li>
      <li>It was a great product but not much of a deal online.</li>
      <li>, I felt like it didn&#x27;t get hot enough, but this one has a temperature control and gets very hot and does a great job with my hair.  </li>
      <li>It gets up to the highest temperature quickly,</li>
      <li>Easy to use and great results in very little time.</li>
      <li>My hairdresser just has a normal Chi, but I always love the way my hair looks after she uses it</li>
      <li>Arrived quickly and was exactly as advertised!  </li>
      <li>I was happy with my first minus the fact it did not have an auto shut-off.      </li>
      <li>Straight as a board all day!!</li>
      <li>She has always had really curly hair and the CHI left it so straight and added a beautiful shine.</li>
      <li>Found the same thing at targe for 20 dollars more!</li>
      <li>I would highly recommend this product if you are looking a great flat iron!!!</li>
      <li>It is so much better than my old Chi iron and the fabric coating keeps the heat contained when close to the hairline.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s worth the money</li>
      <li>It was well worth the money</li>
      <li>*Note to future customers....if you really want it to work find a good heat protecting spray or else you might have crispy hair.</li>
      <li>I was really excited to use this Chi because it looked nice and the digital feature seemed really neat.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve had this for a few weeks and it works very nicely.  </li>
      <li>Heats up  super fast and straightens without burning -- leaves hair smooth and soft ...</li>
      <li>So-so  I have to be honest and say I have never tried to straighten my hair with this when my hair was wet.</li>
      <li>Absolutely a must have!</li>
      <li>This is my first Chi.</li>
      <li>This my first hair straightening iron.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve had many different straiteners</li>
      <li>But if you turn the heat higher then it doesnt matter.</li>
      <li>It also gets extremely hot</li>
      <li>I bought this flat iron back in 2009 and almost 4 years later, it still works wonderfully.  </li>
      <li>My fiancé bought me this flat iron over a year ago and I absolutely love it.</li>
      <li>I love Chi flat irons.</li>
      <li>Worth paying for - we had the $20 one not hot enough, took for ever and ripped at the hair - this is really good and takes 1/2 the time.</li>
      <li>I loved this one even more - I have very thick wavy hair that can be out of control most of the time, but with this it become slick, shiny and straight!</li>
      <li>My old Chi would keep its heat throughout using and would straighten my hair so quickly.</li>
      <li>Its still working just as if it is brand new!!</li>
      <li>Handle can get a little warm</li>
      <li>I have always wanted one, but could never convince myself to spend that much money.</li>
      <li>but I am having a lot of fun with it so far.</li>
      <li>Does it heat up fast?</li>
      <li>It cannot hold its heat very well at all.</li>
      <li>Now I can have curls and straight hair.</li>
      <li>Highly recommended!</li>
      <li>Thanks</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s completely straight.  </li>
      <li>I must say that after receiving this flat iron I went to use it and was loving it till I looked at the digital thermostat.</li>
      <li>a decent straight but not bone straight.</li>
      <li>I purchased my first 1\\&quot; Turbo CHI about 9 years ago and I  just decided to replace it for my bithday this October as my old one had a lot of wear and tear.</li>
      <li>and I was a little hesitant to buy this one because the other one didn&#x27;t work that great</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>

    <li> Worth paying for - we had the $20 one not hot enough, took for ever and ripped at the hair - this is really good and takes 1/2 the time.</li>
    <li> I purchase  my product since 3/18/2010 and you take my money on my ACCount (Credit Card) and i don&#x27;t receive my product yet what&#x27;s happends please give me some information  Thanks</li>
    <li> Sometimes I have to keep bumping up the heat but I think that is just a saftey feature. Other than that no problems. Love it.</li>
    <li> I must say that after receiving this flat iron I went to use it and was loving it till I looked at the digital thermostat. As I was flat ironing my hair the temperature would decrease, so I thought there was something wrong with my iron. No where did I ever read that this iron would do that. So I thought I was going to have to return it till I went to a friends house who happens to have the same iron. She has short hair and it didn&#x27;t do that to her, I happened to have long hair and hers did the same thing. Long story short I then realized that this iron just decreases in heat if you are running it through long hair... I still love it though! Just thought you might like to know this info if you have long hair...</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had the chi ultra before, but not the digital one.  My original Chi stopped working after a couple of years and I loved it so much that I had to buy another.  I loved this one even more - I have very thick wavy hair that can be out of control most of the time, but with this it become slick, shiny and straight! The price was unbeatable.  I would definitely purchase this again and recommend it to who ever is even thinking about it.</li>
    <li> I love Chi flat irons. I have very curly, difficult, sometimes frizzy hair and always grew up thinking it was just stuck that way. Every other iron I&#x27;ve tried just gave me frizzy sort of straight hair, but no where near silky and smooth. The Chi iron does just that. I have beautiful soft silky hair after I use it. People can&#x27;t even tell my hair is naturally curly when I&#x27;m done. I bought this digital one after my Original Chi&#x27;s  (which I loved) switch had a melt down after over 2+ years. Now with this digital one I won&#x27;t have that issue. Now I can have curls and straight hair. It&#x27;s the best of both worlds!!!</li>
    <li> This my first hair straightening iron. I am very pleased with my CHI. Compared to my original curling iron that I have used for over 10 years I found the CHI to work faster and better and my hair lasted until my next shampoo. I love how shiny it leaves my hair.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this for a few weeks and it works very nicely.  It flat irons quickly and less time then other ones I have used.</li>
    <li> I love this straightener!  My last CHI went out after years of use (daily) so I ordered this new one.  MY only problem...I didn&#x27;t order it sooner so I would have a spare when my other one went out!  I have semi curly, frizzy hair...not anymore!! Straight as a board all day!!</li>
    <li> I read a lot of reviews before purchasing this hair straightener, then finally decided that i should buy it! It took forever to recieve it because i used the free supersaver shipping, which i will never do again! But the product itself was pretty good, if you dont use a heat protector or the oil product that chi sells then it doesnt straighten as well. But if used with the product and straightened in small sections then it works beautifully! and will stay straight for a few days! Also the heat does lower as you straighten hair. But if you turn the heat higher then it doesnt matter. I havent figured out how to use it to curl hair but I am having a lot of fun with it so far. All my friends like to come over to use it too because it is better than all of their hair straighteners! Over all it is better than any straightener that i have ever bought!</li>
    <li> I thought I&#x27;d try the Chi because it was cheaper than the Paul Mitchell (the brand which I had previously owned).  When I got this Chi in the mail I used it once and decided to return it because I decided it was very low quality compared to the Paul Mitchell.  It was not as smooth on my hair, and my hair kept getting stuck between the plate and the handle.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had many different straiteners and I must say that this one is the best.  I used to have the basic chi and I was a little hesitant to buy this one because the other one didn&#x27;t work that great, I felt like it didn&#x27;t get hot enough, but this one has a temperature control and gets very hot and does a great job with my hair.  I would definately recommend this product to anyone.  It&#x27;s AWESOME!!!</li>
    <li> Easy to use and great results in very little time. My Wife Loves this gift.</li>
    <li> Absolutely a must have! I don&#x27;t know how I ever survived without.  It is so much better than my old Chi iron and the fabric coating keeps the heat contained when close to the hairline. A bit bulky but the heat adjustment settings more than make up for the inconvenience.</li>
    <li> Love my CHI ! Heats up  super fast and straightens without burning -- leaves hair smooth and soft ...</li>
    <li> The wife loves it and uses it daily.</li>
    <li> Did not heat up correctly.  Do not buy - ? knock off?</li>
    <li> Arrived quickly and was exactly as advertised!  Love the fact that it can straighten or curl!</li>
    <li> It was a great product but not much of a deal online. Found the same thing at targe for 20 dollars more!</li>
    <li> I love this straightener. It works really really well, and it heats up almost instantly. I love how hot it gets and I especially love that I can set it to turn off so I never forget, and leave it on.</li>
    <li> So I have had this CHI for over a year now. I have VERY thick curly/wavy Half mexican hair. Needless to say the CHI does a so so job on my hair....while living in FLA probably doesn&#x27;t help keep it straight either! My sister uses it more than I do now since I have given up trying to straighten my hair.   Does it heat up fast? YES  Does it stay product free clean? Yes....until about a year after purchase  Does it work on most people&#x27;s hair? YES  Mine? So-so  I have to be honest and say I have never tried to straighten my hair with this when my hair was wet. I always blow dried my hair first then used the CHI.   *Note to future customers....if you really want it to work find a good heat protecting spray or else you might have crispy hair.</li>
    <li> This flat iron does not work as well as other chis. The best part is the digital thermonitor. The iron is not very hot and your hair will take hours to get extremely straight. I do not suggest it for anyone with long hair. This product  does damage to the hair just like any other straightener.</li>
    <li> I purchased my first 1\\&quot; Turbo CHI about 9 years ago and I  just decided to replace it for my bithday this October as my old one had a lot of wear and tear. I decided to purchase this product for the first time  after seeing the results on my best friend&#x27;s hair. She has always had really curly hair and the CHI left it so straight and added a beautiful shine. The new 1\\&quot; CHI turbo now has a microchip which indicates the temperature. The 1\\&quot; is also great if you want curl your hair tips in or out. I would highly recommend this product if you are looking a great flat iron!!!</li>
    <li> I bought this flat iron to replace my old 1 inch Turbo Chi that was a few years old and began to malfunction after I accidently dropped it in water. I was really excited to use this Chi because it looked nice and the digital feature seemed really neat. Once I started to use this product I was EXTREMELY disappointed. I have long, thick hair that takes high heat to straighten and this straightner cools down so quickly. It cannot hold its heat very well at all. My old Chi would keep its heat throughout using and would straighten my hair so quickly. I get better results with this straightner if I let it sit for 10 to 20 minutes before I begin to use it but I still have to run it through my hair at least three times to get it straight. I gave this 3 stars because it is a Chi and it is still a good product but it is a disappointment compared to the older version I had. If you have thick, long hair this probably isn&#x27;t the straightner for you but I think it will work for people with thin or short hair. My next straightener will probably be a Paul Mitchell or BaByliss.</li>
    <li> I love this product!  It straightens my fine, thin hair very well.  It also gets extremely hot so I usually have to go over each part of my hair once and it&#x27;s completely straight.  The only downside to this product is that you usually have to go over longer hair more than one time which takes a little longer.  I didn&#x27;t expect this with a Chi.  It&#x27;s totally worth it to buy this product, though!  I still think Chi Flat Irons are the best you can buy! :)</li>
    <li> This is my second CHI turbo flatiron.  After a few years, my first died. **sniff, sniff** I was happy with my first minus the fact it did not have an auto shut-off.      The new CHI turbo now has the auto shut off which is a big plus!  (yet you also have to make sure to turn it on, not just plug it in.  even so, it&#x27;s a minor first step and the auto-off outweighs it)      The other feature I like with it is the digital temp reading.      Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> My wife is happy so I am happy. So far we have no complaints about the product, other than the GFI plug doesn&#x27;t allow her to have her hairdryer (also GFI) and this flat iron plugged into the 2 plug outlet at the same time. I don&#x27;t understand women&#x27;s hair regimens, but apparently that might be a detriment to some. Good value for the pricetag though.</li>
    <li> I loooooove this flat iron! It has made my hair so beautiful and straight. I would suggest spending the extra $10 for the digital setting.     I however, do not suggest the CHI hair products. I wanted soft hair and they left my hair feeling coarse.</li>
    <li> This is my first Chi. I have always wanted one, but could never convince myself to spend that much money. I bought a cheap one and used that until the \\&quot;ceramic\\&quot; coating disappeared and it started pulling all my hair out. I love the temperature gauge on this Chi. My hairdresser just has a normal Chi, but I always love the way my hair looks after she uses it so I started shopping around. I got this one because of the price and the temperature gauge. It gets up to the highest temperature quickly, as little as 30 seconds I believe. The highest is 400 degrees. I use that setting because it seems faster and more effective. I&#x27;m sure there are some guidelines as to the correct temperature, but I haven&#x27;t seen them and there are no instructions included. I like the cord because it swivels so you don&#x27;t have it wrapping around stuff. I like the felt on outside so you can hold it if needed but not burn your hands. The only improvements I could suggest is to add a locking mechanism to lock it closed and a stand for in between uses. Still works great though. I love the guards that keep me from smacking the plates together so I don&#x27;t break them accidentally. My hair looks much softer and healthier than it did with my old flat iron. I use the same hair products as before so I know it is the Chi that makes the difference for me. My hair is short and thick.</li>
    <li> My fiancé bought me this flat iron over a year ago and I absolutely love it. Even after a year of frequent use and a lot of wear and tear, it continues to work perfectly and heat up to 350 in under 2 minutes. Before this flat iron, I was going through at least 2 a year. It was well worth the money and if it stopped working now, I would have no problem buying another one. I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Wife uses it to curl and straighten.  Been using it for a few months and no complains.  Handle can get a little warm but it&#x27;s not hot.</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t straighten my natural hair at the time. Ladies who have thick kinky hair, i suggest you invest in a FHI heat platform. It&#x27;s worth the money and it got my hair a decent straight but not bone straight.</li>
    <li> I bought this flat iron back in 2009 and almost 4 years later, it still works wonderfully.  The design, color and features of the flat iron are very good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only con I have for this is that if my hair is slightly wet, the temperature drops when flat ironing.  So-make sure your hair is dry if you&#x27;re going to use this flat iron.  It has not damaged my hair as much as I thought it would, so I think this was a really good buy :)</li>
    <li> I have ahd this CHI since 2004 and it still looks like it is brand new and works perfect!  Well worth the money!</li>
    <li> ok so I ordered this iron in 2009. Here it is 2015. No lie this iron is awesome!!! Its still working just as if it is brand new!! love it!!</li>
