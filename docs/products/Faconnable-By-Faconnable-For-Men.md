<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Im satisfied with this product, and transaction</li>
    <li> Loved this cologne my husband been using this for many years we used to pay 70.00 but now with tuccini u can find affordable fragrance. Thanks</li>
    <li> Father&#x27;s day gift for my dad, he loved it.</li>
    <li> Great scent. Fast shipment</li>
    <li> This is my husbands favorite cologne, it is getting harder &amp; harder to find.  This was a great price and a very quick ship, really you couldn&#x27;t ask for anything more!</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t beat the price on Amazon.  Very light aroma.  Great way to start the day.</li>
    <li> A classic clean scent.  I wore this for several years and then sort of forgot just how good this is.  Just rediscovered it and it&#x27;s moved back to the top of my list.  Put this on after a post-workout shower and you&#x27;ll feel like you just walked out of an old time barber shop. Lightly sweet aquatic blend of mint, citrus and amber with hints of musk and sandalwood. Sweet without the frat-boy syrup (Curve?). Crisp and masculine without smelling like a dirty pub (Halston Z-14?). Equally at home with Levi&#x27;s and a white T-shirt, or a Ralph Lauren purple label suit.  A few spritzes and you&#x27;ll feel like a million bucks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Solid sillage (not excessive) with moderate to good longevity.  More of a day scent, but works in the evening for semi-formal occasions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Starts clean and citrusy, sweetens over a few hours, and finishes with a warm, comfortable, masculine scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[...] lists it as follows:&lt;br /&gt;Top Notes- Mandarin, Orange Blossom, Wild Mint&lt;br /&gt;Middle Notes- Jasmine, Geranium, Rose&lt;br /&gt;Base Notes- Sandalwood, Musk, Amber</li>
    <li> I love this stuff and my girlfriend does too. She Loves it so much I gave her my bottle and bought another one</li>
    <li> smells good but not overly intense like a lot of smells do. Girls like it a lot, kinda a 90&#x27;s smell in my opinion.</li>
    <li> Like: Georgio for women, Faconnable for men . The Best !!!</li>
    <li> great smell and have used for years...recently, the pump/spray mechanism has not worked well after a couple weeks use..</li>
    <li> Just love this scent and so do the ladies,always getting compliments. And its nice and refreshing and lite,great for the warm summer months.</li>
    <li> i got this as a gift a long time ago and have been trying to find it love the smell and im female,but my husband loves it too so its a win win thanks so much oh and you cant beat the price</li>
    <li> My husband just loves the smell of faconnable. You guys have raised the price so much until it is out of our reach. Lower the price and you will bring back a regular user.</li>
    <li> Excellent product and excellent service!</li>
    <li> NOT LIKE THE REVIEW SAY. TOO TOO SWEET. SWEET FOR ME IT IS NOT A MASCULINE SMELL AT ALL. IT STINKS.</li>
    <li> I love this cologne when purchased from Marshall&#x27;s or Dilliards. I ordered two and had to request a refund immediately after spraying it on my skin. The scent I smelled was that of rubbing alcohol and I knew right away that I had counterfeit or old cologne. It&#x27;s sad because this is a very nice smelling cologne and I get compliments every time I wear it.&lt;br /&gt;But I should have known that $21 was way to low and was too good to be true. I&#x27;ll stick with the discount stores or high end mall stores for this one from now on.</li>
    <li> A gorgeous scent. A lovely blend of mint and sandalwood with floral and citrus notes. Starts as a fresh minty cologne. The dry down is more woody</li>
    <li> This product is good and smells good. Also I bought it in good price. The product stays on the cloth for several hours.I bought it from Amazon.</li>
    <li> This is a classic men&#x27;s cologne.  Just like Channel 5 it never goes out of style and the ladies always find it not overwhelming but very chic.</li>
    <li> A must have in any collection..glad I found it and at half the price...I must say this is in my top 10 and will try to use it sparingly this time..because I had a hard time finding it the second time..I hate trudging though dept stores..going to the counter and asking them about a sent and the person looks at me cross eyed like they never heard of it..and then offering me angel man or C.K.one..REALLY...BAAA..over rated and expensive..don&#x27;t get me wrong I have both and others...now if I could only find a bottle of francesco smalto at this price..man that would be great...OH WELL... Faconnable...under rated hidden gem enough said...happy hunten..</li>
    <li> Great scent for a night out on the town . I been meaning to purchase it for years and finally did. You won&#x27;t be sorry .</li>
    <li> The delivery is fast.the parcel was well-packed.it does not hurt.the parfume is real-delicious and lasting fragrance.thank you.my father was happy!</li>
    <li> Absolute creamy, soapy airy frag! Stays on pretty much all day on my skin and I get mucho compliments. One of the best in my ever growing collection</li>
    <li> This product has gotten me more comments than any other cologne I&#x27;ve worn, in a positive way.  Not real strong smelling, just right and lasts all day.</li>
    <li> Great scent for casual use!  Not too strong and not too weak.  I alternate between &amp;#34;Faconnable&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;CK one&amp;#34;, and &amp;#34;Acqua Di Gio&amp;#34; for casual use and &amp;#34;Dolce &amp; Gabbana&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;Terre d&#x27;Herm&amp;egrave;s by Hermes&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;Creed Aventus by Creed&amp;#34; for evening wear.</li>
    <li> Great item!! I have been stopped by women in a mall asking what I am wearing because they caught a sniff as I walked by and it smelt so nice.........JB</li>
    <li> Love this scent . Such a great name too !</li>
    <li> This cologne is a sleeper considering the quality and cost!  If you collect colognes, this is a must for the arsenal!!</li>
    <li> For the price is very nice fragance, fresh and sweet. this was for a gift and it was perfect! thnaks.</li>
    <li> My favorite cologne. An excellent fragrance that smells great, but is not too overbearing. What a classic scent. I have been wearing it off and on since 1996.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use to buy it at Nordstrom, but I now save $50.00 by buying through Amazon.com. Same tin, same bottle, same fragrance.</li>
    <li> I have been using Faconnable glasses for quite a long time but I hadn&#x27;t tried its eau de toilette. After reading the reviews here I thought I should give it a try. People wrote how mild scent it has so on and so forth. After I got it my first impression was, what the hell. It is not mild, it is actually quite strong. I was a little bit disappointed but as I didn&#x27;t pay much, it was not a big deal. However, after may be 30 minutes I noticed that it does have really mild and excellent scent. Oh my God,I loved it and it became one of my favorites.</li>
    <li> Thank you very much for the quality of the product is good and I highly recommend it, just continue like delivering quality products and competitive.</li>
    <li> believe it or not, this has been my personal scent since i discovered it in 1997. i had to use others before amazon came along (this is a really tough one to find in stores, actually) but would buy 2 or even 3 at a time when i did find it in any store.</li>
    <li> This is a great product</li>
    <li> this perfume is one of may favorite perfumes of all time.&lt;br /&gt;first time i bought it when i was 15 years old, in 1998, and i was so in love with its scent.&lt;br /&gt;as time pass by, i forget its name, even though sometimes when i go to cologne shop, i describe to them how this perfume looks like and ask them if they have it, and their usual answer to me:\\&quot; do you remember the cologne name ?\\&quot; and my usual replay:\\&quot;if i knew, i wouldn&#x27;t bother to describe exactly how it looks like!\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;anyway, last week i was in NYC, and i went to cologne shop and i asked them specifically about this one \\&quot;same conversation happened\\&quot; , but fortunate for me, the guy who works in that shop gave me a catalog and he told me \\&quot; you will find all different kind of perfumes in this catalog\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;so, while i was looking thoroughly in that catalog, i finally found it :D , but unfortunately the price was 55$,&lt;br /&gt;so, while i was in that shop, i looked for this one in amazon i found it for 20$  \\&quot; 35$ difference  \\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;so, i order it, and received it in less than 5 days,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;at the beginning, i was disappointed by first few sprays since it wasn&#x27;t the same scent, but after i spray it few times, the scent become exactly the same scent that i used to have 15 years ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i highly recommend every one who purchase this perfume for the first time to judge it after first few sprays&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am so happy to purchase this product, and i will definitely purchase it again.</li>
    <li> This is one of my favorites fragrances and the price was unbeatable. Even the local flea market could not compete</li>
    <li> I have had a lot of complements on this scent, and no complains.  I definitely would recommend this scent to anyone with taste.</li>
    <li> I really love this perfume, smell really good on my skin, and has a really good price.no complaints. fast shipping, good quality!!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> it is superb mens cologne!</li>
    <li> A mis treinta y pico de a&amp;ntilde;os he utilizado gran cantidad de fragancias y esta sin duda es la mejor de todas para usar durante el d&amp;iacute;a, simplemente deliciosa. Les recomiendo la compra, pero si lo hacen desde afuera de los estados unidos como es mi casa, tienes que tener en cuenta de que ahora el transporte de este producto en los aviones es algo complicado.</li>
    <li> My son and i saw this item in Chicago at a Nordstrom&#x27;s.  While in the store, I ordered for us off of Amazon for less money.  An aroma that my 14 year old son AND I both like.  Very rich aromas</li>
    <li> This is a nice smelling fragerance for men and I enjoy wearing this all the time, product was delivered on a timely manner and packaged properly.</li>
    <li> I got this for my husband because he loves his colonges. This smells very good. He was very happy with his gift. This is a great colonge for anyone trying something new and different.</li>
    <li> El Agua de Colonia Faconnable tiene una refrescante fragancia C&amp;iacute;trica. Ideal para usar despu&amp;eacute;s de un ba&amp;ntilde;o. No es un perfume de olor fuerte.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Este vendedor es muy responsable, el producto me lleg&amp;oacute; en excelentes condiciones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Si van a adquirirlo desde Venezuela recomiendo que usen el servicio de la empresa TEALCA, porque MailBoxes NO ACEPTA enviar perfumes y pierdes la compra.</li>
    <li> I have used this for 15 years and love it!</li>
    <li> I am not a guy, but I bought it for a dear friend. It smells just wonderful, and he likes it very much. It is not heavy, but light either, and the best thing about it is that it lingers on-- sometimes you can have just a whiff. And I think the tin box is amazing. Wish they would make more of this kind!</li>
    <li> Great price on Amazon! Probably the best for the money. Nice masculine scent using natural ingredients. My favorite is Guerlain, but it costs 3 times as much. I use this for my daily cologne, and the Guerlain for special occasions or when I am going out with my wife.</li>
    <li> I paid $70 for my first bottle at Nordstrom, this one is as good. It appears to be the real deal and at least is not a stolen tester! Which is what you would get from Ebay!</li>
    <li> This perfume is excellent, I love it, bought it first for my cousin then I bought another one for my self. I recommend it.</li>
    <li> Grace Kelly and Cary Grant casually tearing along in a sporty convertible along the cliffs above Cannes in \\&quot;To Catch A Thief\\&quot;. One lovely gloved hand of Miss Kelly lightly caressing the steering wheel at sixty miles an hour; is there anything more alluring or jam packed with high voltage glamour and seduction? This is the epitome of what we think of as classic French Rivera high octane sophisticated &amp;eacute;lan. The lifestyle of the rich and famous before Robin Leach leached the soul out of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There still remains an inkling of this lost allure within the elegantly crafted bottle of Faconnable for Men. One spray of this elixir of masculine elegance and you are transported to the south of France. It is twilight cocktails on the terrace of the Casino at Monte Carlo in a white Tux, a swim out to the float of the beach of the Carleton Hotel. It is the grand staircase and red carpet of the Cannes Film Festival. It is serious as a high stakes game of Baccarat and as much fun as fireworks after midnight with a barefoot bejewled movie star at your side.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It opens bright and arrestingly with its well chosen top notes of mint, orange blossom and mandarin orange that does give it a smell of a well made martini. That dissipates quickly into a lush intoxicating Mediterranean garden of jasmine geranium and rose. Toward the end of the middle Sandalwood announces the dry down followed shortly by rich amber and an ethereal musk that dance seductively around the sandalwood in a smoky slinky dance. It lasted all night on my skin and I awoke with traces of the dry down still in evidence.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now listen boys, this one is for grown ups! Faconnable for Men is too subtle and complex for simpler younger tastes unless you are a young man who really wants to stand apart as original, daring and smart. In that case welcome to the world of men of confidence, wit, grace and disarming charm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5 Platinum stars *****</li>
    <li> Love this cologne. Nordstom&#x27;s carried for years, but dis-continued. Amazon and the subsequent supplier  did a great job&amp;#62;&lt;br /&gt;Was very glad to find and purchase.</li>
    <li> The best perfaum for casual occasion.. Smell sweet combined with a little wood smell. A really really good perfaum!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks.</li>
    <li> Best Eau De Toilette for men there is. Using it constantly.</li>
    <li> Like some of the 5 star reviews of this product I too like the smell and have received numerous compliments on the fragrance by perfect strangers.  However and unfortunately the pump mechanism for the cologne is awful.  It worked fine in the first couple of usages and then barely pumps well after that.  In addition the poor pumping results in a slow leak from he cap area.  As I store my cologne on my wooden dresser, the result of this leak has left a stain that has blemished it to the point where I will not purchase this product again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is a shame, it is a great fragrance.  Just a horrible spray mechanism.</li>
    <li> Faconnable By Faconnable For Men. Eau De Toilette , one of my favorites fragrances, give it a try, I love it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve spent $45-$55 dollars for the same perfume in the department store. I&#x27;ve been wearing this scent ever since it first was introduced. I get compliments on it all the time and although I have a nice selection of other scents...I always come back to Faconnable. This is the lowest price I&#x27;ve paid yet and the quality appears to be the same. Why pay more?</li>
    <li> Both products were Father&#x27;s Day gifts and they were well reveived by my hisband.</li>
    <li> on time... I get the same and with the same description... very good i like that very much. please keep it up</li>
    <li> Great scent, recommend.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know how to perfectly describe this scent but to me it smells pretty fresh. Its really good and most definitely under rated!</li>
    <li> I like this product.  I read a review about it when looking at it originally that called it &amp;#34;citrusy&amp;#34;.  That&#x27;s a good description.  Has a citrus sent that seems very clean.</li>
    <li> I like the clean scent that it offers but it does not project well or last. Not bad thoug for roughly $30.00</li>
    <li> Great aroma last all day</li>
    <li> Im satisfied with my purchase it was the real thing and it shipped quickly....</li>
    <li> Super fresh and clean!  This one is just about as classic and classy as it gets.  It really smells like an old-school gentleman&#x27;s scent, but not in any way an &amp;#34;old man&#x27;s&amp;#34; scent.  It is just about perfect for office wear, and is good for casual wear too.  If you do not want to wear something that has any chance of offending somebody, and that just plain smells good, this is a great choice.  My only knocks on it are that it does have great longevity (~4 hours is about all I get), and it is just a little too weak for cold weather.  But if you are going to be inside, and have a travel atomizer to reapply for those long days at work, this one is a sure shot.  A daytime go-to for sure.</li>
    <li> Packaging is very good, bottles would never break...Great fragrance...FRA</li>
    <li> I remember when this cologne first came out several years ago (maybe 10 or more, not sure) I had a very unique and distinguishing smell to it. I loved the way it turned heads from females and even guys had to stop and ask what I was wearing. By the time I went they the bottle, it was no longer on the shelf for whatever reasons beyond my understanding-I couldn&#x27;t find it anywhere. Most stores said they no longer carried the fragrance and it was discontinued bring my search to an abrupt end. Recently me and my wife we&#x27;re on the computer looking for a few things to throw an 80&#x27;s party and found great success finding items from the past that are no longer in circulation or discontinued. With the way my luck was going I thought I would try to find this cologne and Amazon had it to my surprise! I went crazy and was so amazed to find it after so many years! Thanks, Amazon!!! Your the best! ;)</li>
    <li> In July of 2014 I paid about twenty five dollars for this. It is now one hundred thirty five dollars. It is a fine product but now it is ridiculously overpriced.&lt;br /&gt;I now use BVLGARI or Chanel. This is my opinion, if you like it and find the price attractive by all means buy it. I like my two choices more.</li>
    <li> Not only that this fragrance is not so easy to find any more, but it is also very reasonably priced at Amazon. I started using Faconnable about 15 years ago and still love it to this day. Give it a try, maybe you will join me.</li>
    <li> This product was ordered as a gift. I was greatly disappointed when it arrived in damaged condition, and I had to purchase a different gift at the last minute.</li>
    <li> My fiancee was allover me after one whiff of this classic scent. It smells very good. I was told by my father this was a must for the fragrance collector. I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase as well as price and delivery timeframe. Excellent seller and product.</li>
    <li> fast delivery, good price, aroma stays for long time, it doesnt smell cheap and my husband loves it . Will get it again!</li>
