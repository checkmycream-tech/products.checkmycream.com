      <li>This system is for more than just a jumpstart to weight loss.  </li>
      <li>Nothing happened and after about 5 minutes I felt better.</li>
      <li>The shakes are completely healthy and designed to give your body what it needs.</li>
      <li>I hear the chocolate is better.</li>
      <li>They are just trying to make more money for themselves.</li>
      <li>If anything I was more hungry because my satiety never does well with just a liquid diet.</li>
      <li>and I wasn&#x27;t able to continue losing any weight like I wanted to met my goal.</li>
      <li>I have five more pounds to go.</li>
      <li>Wasn&#x27;t able to continue losing weight.  </li>
      <li>so I added a lot of water, ice, and and cinnamon most times.</li>
      <li>Oh, and my spouse has been prescription-drug free since he did this program!</li>
      <li>I was so impressed that I started the program the next month and lost 9lbs myself, and had lost my cravings for sugar.</li>
      <li>I probably drink a gallon of water a day when I am doing Isagenix and even more on the deep-cleanse days.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s way over-priced because on top of the product I had to pay outlandish postage and got socked for import duties.  </li>
      <li>I was happy with my progress, my clothes were fitting, but clearly my body needed a meal!  </li>
      <li>I was happy with my progress, my clothes were fitting, but clearly my body needed a meal!  </li>
      <li>Everything else tastes pretty good.</li>
      <li>I have no interest whatsoever in becoming an Isagenix distributor</li>
      <li>Is it easy?</li>
      <li>You need a strong will to stick to this program.</li>
      <li>I do not sell it and I am a huge Isagenix fan.</li>
      <li>Lost 4.8 lbs - for me it is huge-</li>
      <li>ad follow precisely</li>
      <li>but I would like another way to buy their productswithout being provided with a great deal of information that pertains only to their multi-level marketing plan.</li>
      <li>I did this last year (Feb/2014) and got great results.</li>
      <li>Awesome product to do a first cleanse - read directions carefully</li>
      <li>Okay first of all it is not always cheaper to order through an isagenix associate</li>
      <li>Nothing worth doing is easy.</li>
      <li>I have kept off the weight (187 to 170), but have not been totally clean with my diet and look forward to the &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34; feeling this helps to achieve.</li>
      <li>The shakes are good, and easy to do at work, as long as you have some ice and a shaker bottle (which you can buy for $4).  </li>
      <li>This was hands down the easiest and most pleasant weight loss and health lifestyle program I have ever tried.</li>
      <li>Granted, this works mostly because you&#x27;re not eating much</li>
      <li>Even my kids love it and trust me they don&#x27;t like much.</li>
      <li>It is not at all sweet</li>
      <li>It arrived fast and I was able to start on time.</li>
      <li>Dr. Becky Maes (formerly Natrajan) and Dan Maes have embraced TriVita&#x27;s mission, superior quality products and proven business model.</li>
      <li>The Cleansing Liquid is a fruit juice flavor and it is not bad at all....</li>
      <li>The shake days were actually pretty easy.</li>
      <li>I did this to jump start a diet...hoping that I would quickly drop a couple of pounds and use that as motivation to keep at it.</li>
      <li>Bottom line is it&#x27;s better for our digestive systems and over all health to get into the habit of eating a variety of real food and in the right portion.  </li>
      <li>Overall I was very pleased with this program</li>
      <li>Overall I was very pleased with this program</li>
      <li>I was not perfect in my regime, but I feel great and plan on continuing...and by the way, INCHES matter, as the scale may not show the true results if you have toned up, thus I am very glad to have my beginning measurements.  </li>
      <li>I wasn&#x27;t prepared with my normal healthy food &amp; snacks since I foolish thought, like others had posted, I wouldn&#x27;t be hungry or lack energy with the Isagenix.  </li>
      <li>Relying on a powdered so called magic bullet/miracle product isn&#x27;t the way  to live life.    </li>
      <li>As of the next morning I was down 5.5 lbs, felt great, tons of energy, no cravings, and clothes fitting!  </li>

      <li>They are 100% dedicated to your success and helping you experience wellness and create wealth for your life</li>
      <li>I do not think it was worth the money.</li>
      <li>I lost 8 lbs in 4 days, but I don&#x27;t think it was worth it.  </li>
      <li>Everyone&#x27;s chemistry is different just as everyone has a right to their own opinion.  </li>
      <li>I found it to be pretty easy to stick to, even though you don&#x27;t eat much.  </li>
      <li>cause I normally eat A LOT!!!</li>
      <li>I mostly had 400 calorie meals, which meant 800 calories for the day, plus the 240 calories in the shake, so I was eating a little more than 1000 calories per day.</li>
      <li>My testitmonial is that I am 55 yrs old, lost 20 lbs in 2 months EASILY.</li>
      <li>Easy and fast, taste better then other products.</li>
      <li>Overall I am always pleased with this product.</li>
      <li>the first day.</li>
      <li>I wanted to try the 9 day to see if I liked the product before I spent a lot of money on the 30 day system.</li>
      <li>It did help keep me focused on my goal at first but eventually did nothing</li>
      <li>\\&quot;I see that Isagenix medical advisor, Becky Natrajan, MD, may be \\&quot;excited about the results\\&quot;, - but not that excited.    </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s actually an 11-day plan where the first two days before the 9-day cleanse are \\&quot;pre-cleanse\\&quot; days which are nothing more than the \\&quot;shake</li>
      <li>Came with only the basics nothing more.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I LOVE Isagenix! Their products have given me energy and health that I haven&#x27;t had in years. The systems are flexible to your goals and lifestyle so you can have sustainable results if you know the products well and how they are formulated to work. I would advise to listen to your body and work closely with an Isagenix Consultant to get the best prices and most out of the product. I buy the 30 day cleansing and fat burning system for about $270 plus $20 or so for shipping, the 9 day is $149. The consultant I work with is professional and has never pressured me in any way. I get a lot of good nutrition information from her FB page &amp;#34;nutrition solutions for your fit family&amp;#34;. No fuss, no muss, no &amp;#34;pyramid scheme&amp;#34; nonsense.  If you want all the amazing benefits look up my consultant mychoicemychance.isagenix.com.</li>
    <li> Everyone&#x27;s chemistry is different just as everyone has a right to their own opinion.  I think these products are great.  The shakes are good, and easy to do at work, as long as you have some ice and a shaker bottle (which you can buy for $4).  The Cleansing Liquid is a fruit juice flavor and it is not bad at all....I have heard the powder form is less appealing.  My testitmonial is that I am 55 yrs old, lost 20 lbs in 2 months EASILY. I was only walking minimally, but am now motivated to add the exercise component.... I was not perfect in my regime, but I feel great and plan on continuing...and by the way, INCHES matter, as the scale may not show the true results if you have toned up, thus I am very glad to have my beginning measurements.  And the company gives you a 30 day money back guarantee on any new products you don&#x27;t like.  They were great to work with as I returned one snack product (dutch chocolate wafers).  I would encourage others to try this program, whether you choose to become an associate and pass opportunities to your friends or not...I have not, but people have definitely taken notice and ask.  This was hands down the easiest and most pleasant weight loss and health lifestyle program I have ever tried.</li>
    <li> The first time I bought this  product, I followed the instructions and lost a few pounds. The second time I ordered it, I wasted the product. I tried it a third time, but never finished. I think that I&#x27;m done. In my case, I used it a year ago and I don&#x27;t regret it, but I am not going to use it ever again. You need a strong will to stick to this program.</li>
    <li> The product that I wanted for the best price around.  Was delivered in an expeditious manner.</li>
    <li> I did this last year (Feb/2014) and got great results. As a matter of fact, Im on my second day of another cleanse. The beginning is tough because of the whole mind set thing, but after a few days its much easier. Helped me to see how much crap I was putting into my system that I didn&#x27;t need. Really helped to change my whole attitude toward eating, energy etc. Actually I felt like some of the aches and pains that I dealt with, actually subsided. My energy level jumped way up. It takes a commitment, but after you spend the $$, it helps with the motivation. Nothing worth doing is easy. 9 days is not that long and if your energy crashes on a fast day, a half apple and or almonds really help. Last year I lost almost 30 lbs and 2 inchs in my waist. The cleanse is what started it. I have kept off the weight (187 to 170), but have not been totally clean with my diet and look forward to the &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34; feeling this helps to achieve. I did not purchase from Amazon, instead a friend that sells it. There is just a couple dollars difference. The strawberry shake is the best!</li>
    <li> If you follow the plan you will lose weight!  I found it to be pretty easy to stick to, even though you don&#x27;t eat much.  Even the days when you just do the juice cleanse you don&#x27;t feel that hungry.  I usually get headaches but with this I only had one the first day.  Granted, this works mostly because you&#x27;re not eating much, it is a great kick start if you need it and have a plan to maintain afterward.  It is expensive, but I would get it again.</li>
    <li> Yuck! This stuff tastes horrid. I could barely get it down, which didn&#x27;t keep me motivated to stay on the plan. I ended up quitting cause I couldn&#x27;t make myself drink anymore of it. I hear the chocolate is better. I just wasted money. :-(</li>
    <li> I recently purchased the 9-day cleanse, (again), directly from Isagenix.  My weight fluctuates and I jokingly refer to my diet plan as the yo-yo diet.  Anyway, this will be my 3rd time that I&#x27;ve used the 9-day plan over the past several years.  It&#x27;s actually an 11-day plan where the first two days before the 9-day cleanse are \\&quot;pre-cleanse\\&quot; days which are nothing more than the \\&quot;shake days.\\&quot;  Anyway, as others have pointed out, the cleanse was not originally designed as a weight loss tool but it sure as he** is marketed that way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You will receive a tri-fold brochure along with a measuring tape and chart to log in your progress where you will record both your loss of pounds and inches-so yes, it is marketed as a weight loss guide.  What disappoints me most about Isagenix is that when you buy their products, they seem to focus 90-95% of their attention on the multi-level marketing aspect of their company and approximately 5-10% of their efforts on the product that you just purchased and the goal(s) of the customer.  Their marketing kind of reminds me of those late night info-mercials with the Vietnamese real-estate guru driving around in a Mercedes SL and traveling the waterways in yachts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll continue to purchase their products as they seem to provide me with a good jumpstart to weight loss.  My goal is to lose about 7-10% of my current body weight and the 9-day cleanse points me in the right direction.  Once I&#x27;ve met my weight loss goals I will then go to the common sense things that most of us already know-eat in moderation, avoid simple carbs, and drink plenty of water.  The hard part is maintaining that common sense approach and thus the yo-yo cycle continues.  :-)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It seems to me that the company should branch off into 2 areas-one for the multi-level wholesalers and the other directed at the end-user of the product.  I have no interest whatsoever in becoming an Isagenix distributor but I would like another way to buy their productswithout being provided with a great deal of information that pertains only to their multi-level marketing plan.</li>
    <li> This product was expensive! It had to think long and hard before ordering it, but it was worth every penny. No hunger pangs, no cravings, weight loss as advertised. I&#x27;ll definitely use it again in the future when I need to get my weight loss jump-started.</li>
    <li> I ordered this off Amazon and waited until I had the days to do it. I didn&#x27;t do the 2 day pre-cleanse (which really drags the 9 day cleanse out to 11 days), but just started on the two day deep cleanse. The berry cleanse does taste icky, just mix it with warm water to dissolve, then mix with a little cold and suck it down quick! I didn&#x27;t read the directions carefully, so only used one scoop (instead of 2 for the deep cleanse) the first day. As people said, the first two days are the hardest, but with the Natural Accelerator capsules I did have energy. The so-called Isagenix \\&quot;snacks\\&quot; were awful- tasted like vanilla rolaids. I refused to eat them after the first time, and ate 2 raw almonds (same calories) instead when it called for the snack. After two days of the deep cleanse, I was very happy to discover I&#x27;d lost 5 pounds, since I only expected (from what I read of the product) to lose 6 to 7. I shouldn&#x27;t have started celebrating just yet. The shake days were very easy to follow. I didn&#x27;t like the taste of the shake, but it was bearable with ice cubes and a little cinnamon sprinkled on top. It is not at all sweet and it did give me energy. I opted for the 400-600 calorie meals for lunch and dinner as opposed to drinking shakes, as I would rather eat real food and that was very doable. I mostly had 400 calorie meals, which meant 800 calories for the day, plus the 240 calories in the shake, so I was eating a little more than 1000 calories per day. The bad new is, after starting to eat \\&quot;real food\\&quot; on the shake days, I went up a pound and stayed there for the rest of the 7 days. While I was supposed to do two more cleanse days at the end, I didn&#x27;t because I had tennis one day and a run the other, and couldn&#x27;t operate without the shake calories. So, all in all, I lost 4 pounds in 9 days, which isn&#x27;t bad, but not the amazing results I&#x27;d hoped for. I totally went off it the day after it was over (Sunday), but am back on it as a shake in the morning and two 400-600 caloriewell-rounded meals for lunch and dinner, with a half an apple or almonds for a snack. I plan to keep doing it until my shake runs out and hopefully I will get down to my desired weight- I have five more pounds to go. So, I would recommend the product, with reservations. Know that it tastes bad and if you want to continue it, it is an expensive option unless you&#x27;re a rep of Isagenix and stay away from those nasty \\&quot;snacks\\&quot;.</li>
    <li> This system not only gives you a great kick start to weight loss, it also seems to increase your energy level which is great.</li>
    <li> I ordered the 9day program. I got the vanilla flavor and although I am not crazy about it, it wasn&#x27;t horrible. I am 5&#x27;6, and before the cleanse I was 130 lbs. and consider myself \\&quot;skinny-fat\\&quot;. I have long skinny legs and arms but have always had issues with my mid section. I did this cleanse thinking that it would help with my issue but unfortunately it didn&#x27;t. I followed the system and basically starved myself cause I normally eat A LOT!!! I was hungry the entire time I was on this darn program. I wanted to eat the world, but I didn&#x27;t. I stuck to it, worked out every day as I normally do, drank lots of water constantly. The only thing this made me do was pee every 5 minutes, but I guess it was because of all the water I drank. Today is day \\&quot;9\\&quot; and I gained 1.7 lbs and didn&#x27;t lose an inch anywhere. It claims that gives you energy... NOT! I am very upset because I had really high hopes. I am extremely disappointed with this product and will never purchase it again.</li>
    <li> I have been using Isagenix on and off over the years whenever I feel that my appetite is getting a little out of hand and I would like to lose a few pounds. It really does stop the cravings and because you are reducing your calories - you do lose weight. Its definately not easy and requires dedication - but once you see the results, its totally worth it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would like to point out that I used order this product from Isagenix but always found it very annoying that you had to pay an annual membership fee. I used to think that it gave a discounted price but it does not at all. I came across this 9-day system on amazon and it is exactly the same price that I paid on isagenix.com AND there is no commitment.</li>
    <li> Easy and fast, taste better then other products. I&#x27;m always on the go and don&#x27;t have time to seat and wait. My shake is ready in a minute.</li>
    <li> The goal of the people who sell this stuff to you is to get people onto their pyramid scheme where you do a 9-day cleanse and then become a lifer incorporating their shakes into your regular diet along with doing the deep cleanse (basically not eating) once a week.  Bottom line is it&#x27;s better for our digestive systems and over all health to get into the habit of eating a variety of real food and in the right portion.  Relying on a powdered so called magic bullet/miracle product isn&#x27;t the way  to live life.    An FYI:    \\&quot;I see that Isagenix medical advisor, Becky Natrajan, MD, may be \\&quot;excited about the results\\&quot;, - but not that excited.

    <li> Loved it! I would absolutely purchase it again.</li>
    <li> Did the job, however I was very hungry. When I completed the system and introduced my body to foods again, I felt great. Works great and in 9 days.</li>
    <li> Product didn&#x27;t really seem to do much for me although I got tired of all the requirements in one day&#x27;s time. Think maybe I didn&#x27;t take it as serious as I should have.</li>
    <li> Loved it! It is rigorous but works! Lost 4.8 lbs - for me it is huge- my body is very resistant. I am going to try 30- day system</li>
    <li> Shipped fast. Product as described. Didn&#x27;t lose much weight but I did notice a difference in how I felt. Warning: You will probably be extremely hungry during cleanse days. I wasnt expecting that so I had cheat moments the first two cleanse days which might be why I didnt lose as much as I wanted to. But the last 2 cleanse days went well knowing that I would be hungry and just to suck it up. I would try this product again.</li>
    <li> I wish I could give it 0 stars. On my first day, I woke early and was committed to taking each product at the time recommended to me on the pamphlets and info boards. By noon, I&#x27;d been physically ill once. By 6p, I couldn&#x27;t stop vomiting and when there was nothing left in my system - I dry heaved until 2am, when I called someone to take me to the ER. (All of the team leads on the info boards told members it was normal and that my body was responding to toxins leaving my body.) By that time, I was dehydrated from the puking and had a migraine. I was given IV fluids, dilaudid, and anti-nausea meds. The doc checked out my Isagenix bottles and told me not to take it anymore.&lt;br /&gt;Isagenix made me prove the doctor&#x27;s orders before giving me a partial refund - and told me that I must&#x27;ve been too toxic for the products.&lt;br /&gt;I wouldn&#x27;t wish this product on my worst enemies. This was an awful and expensive experience.</li>
    <li> Wasn&#x27;t for me.  I couldn&#x27;t stomach the taste of shakes.</li>
    <li> Awesome product to do a first cleanse - read directions carefully ad follow precisely - I recommend getting a person to do it at the same time as a support system.</li>
    <li> 3 days in and I gained weight.  I could not starve myself as this program requires.  Sipping on gross &#x27;juice&#x27; 4 times a day and working a high stress job are not a good combination.  Lead to me grabbing junk food to get through the day.  I wasn&#x27;t prepared with my normal healthy food &amp; snacks since I foolish thought, like others had posted, I wouldn&#x27;t be hungry or lack energy with the Isagenix.  Shake days weren&#x27;t too bad but I don&#x27;t see any difference from other shake based diets.  The shakes actually taste much worse than others.  I would prefer my own veggie smoothies.&lt;br /&gt;I thought I&#x27;d try Isagenix to quickly loose holiday pounds but I&#x27;ll stick with slowly dropping them through healthy eating.</li>
    <li> This system is for more than just a jumpstart to weight loss.  I came across this product 5 years ago because my spouse had developed an addiction to prescription meds and was having some pretty terrible side effects as well.  When I realized what was happening, I called my local chiropractor, rather than the Dr. who kept the prescriptions coming, and asked him for help. (He is very informed on holistic approaches to medicine).  He told me about this program, so we bought it.  Within two nights, my spouse was feeling better, sleeping throughout the night, without the aid of the prescription drug, and had rid his system completely of the cravings for that, and the side effects of the other medicine he was taking.  The 10lbs he lost at the end of the program was just an extra bonus!  I was so impressed that I started the program the next month and lost 9lbs myself, and had lost my cravings for sugar. Oh, and my spouse has been prescription-drug free since he did this program!</li>
    <li> Yuck. Much like I would imagine drinking spit!</li>
    <li> I ordered this cleanse to complete my last 9 days of 8 weeks of diligent dieting after a couple of months of over-indulging while my husband was deployed.  Prior to, I&#x27;d done 5 strict weeks of Body for Life and lost 7lbs (I only had 15-20 to lose). It arrived fast and I was able to start on time. I didn&#x27;t do the first two pre-cleanse days because I thought you needed extra shake powder to do so and the instructions weren&#x27;t clear about this. A little research on my part would have answered the question but oh well. Honestly, the first deep cleanse day was REALLY hard and I probably considered quitting three times an hour. The thing that kept me honest was the amount of $ I had invested!  Once I got through that day the second deep-cleanse day was totally fine.  This thing is really mind over matter. On the 3rd morning I&#x27;d lost 3 lbs!  The shake days were uneventful. Frankly I think the shake powder is pretty bad-tasting (I had vanilla, but the cleanse liquid was tasty) so I added a lot of water, ice, and and cinnamon most times. I tried adding fruit a couple of times but got heartburn both times. As the days went on I did cheat a bit (6 almonds here and there, an apple, a green salad one day) but never anything truly unhealthy. I think I was just hungry and the looser my clothes got, the less motivated I was to starve!  Plus the Isagenix Snacks are NOT delicious at all!  I did stick to my normal workouts on the shake days, no working out on deep cleanse days. By the last two cleanse days I&#x27;d lost a lot of steam. Day 8 I had an apple and some almond butter during the day.  I did, by the way, have TONS of energy throughout the whole 9 days and felt very light and no cravings other than just to eat in general. On day 9 I started the day feeling good but fantasizing about getting back to my Body for Life eating with 5-6 small meals per day. Around 11 am I was out shopping and was all of a sudden overcome by nausea, stomach cramps, and sweating. I sat down for a minute and honestly thought I was about to vomit or worse in public so rushed to the bathroom. Nothing happened and after about 5 minutes I felt better. But it was then that I decided enough was enough. I was happy with my progress, my clothes were fitting, but clearly my body needed a meal!  I ate (a very unhealthy taco bell) lunch, and later had a shake for dinner. As of the next morning I was down 5.5 lbs, felt great, tons of energy, no cravings, and clothes fitting!  Overall I was very pleased with this program and I&#x27;d definitely do it again!  I wouldnt consider a longer course or long-term use because I think there are much tastier protein powders out there and I think the Natural Accelerator and Isagenix Snacks are gimmicky and near-useless. One thing I found highly annoying about this company is the way they flood the Internet with positive reviews by people selling the product, making it very difficult to find an unbiased Isagenix review. Hopefully mine will help!  Oh, and there was not enough powder to make all the cleanse liquid required but since I dropped out early it didn&#x27;t end up mattering. I would say I was at least 1 serving (2 scoops) short. I suspect it&#x27;s because they go by weight and don&#x27;t factor in that little moisture-preventing packet buried in the powder.d honestly thought I was about to vomit or worse in public so rushed to the bathroom.

    <li> It arrived a day late. Came with only the basics nothing more. It did help keep me focused on my goal at first but eventually did nothing and I deviated to my own plan which then kicked in better. I found other options at just about any grocery or vitamin store which are so similar and yet a fraction of the price. I do not think it was worth the money.</li>
    <li> I got this in the mail today and there were absolutely no instructions included.  I had to go online and find the web site of someone who sells it and has, kindly, posted the instructions.  I bought it through Amazon because I didn&#x27;t want to deal with the pressure of the multi-level marketing that I understand goes with it.  I guess the trade off is not getting all the information that you need.  Perhaps I will post again after I use it!</li>
    <li> I lost 8 lbs in 4 days, but I don&#x27;t think it was worth it.  It felt like I was starving myself instead of doing something good for my body and my health.  I also got rather hangry.  The protein shakes are delicious though!</li>
    <li> The product is having the desired effect, however, it is NOT a 9-day program. one of the main elements of the program is the shake mix, however, based on the 2 scoops instructed twice per day the shake mix only lasts for 4 days so not enough to complete the 9 day program. The other products have enough quantity for the program.</li>
    <li> Terrible for this price. Me and my co worker tried it and it was bad for both of us. First u feel soooo tited all the time, second u cant sleep bc u r hungry and weak, third makes my stomach hurt . I stopped after 4 days bc i had black under mu eyes . Same for my co worker . She stopped after 5 days.</li>
    <li> I ordered this product after one of my friends had great results with the 30 day system. I wanted to try the 9 day to see if I liked the product before I spent a lot of money on the 30 day system. I needed something to put me back on track after the holidays. I am on my last deep cleanse day and I have lost 5 1/2 lbs. Now, my weight usually fluctuates so it&#x27;s hard to go by weight. But overall I feel a lot less bloated and just feel generally better. The first 2 deep cleanse days were really hard because you can&#x27;t eat, but I managed through it. The isa snack things are horrible, I had to gag them down with a lot of water. Everything else tastes pretty good. The shake days were actually pretty easy. I mix a handful of frozen fruit with my shakes and they are really good. I didn&#x27;t feel hungry or have any side effects on Shake days. I ordered the 30 day system and am going to start that tomorrow. I am hoping for some great results!</li>
    <li> This product met all my expectations.  The 9-day program is a wonderful way to initiate trying to lose weight - gives you a real boost to continue to reach your goals.</li>
    <li> So far this cleanse has been to me and for my body. I am now on day 5 and have already lost 7 pounds. Its a great way to jump your body into a healthier living life style, I was also impressed with the taste of the  berry cleanse flavor. My first thought at looking at the powder and mixing it was that it was going to taste awful but I was wrong it was actually good and I enjoyed it better when its cold instead of room temperature. I have been sharing information about this product to other family and friends and will but it again when in need. I was also impressed that the seller mailed it to me right on time and in great shape. The only thing that was missing from the package was the measuring tape that was listed to be there with the instructions and dvd. I would purchase from this seller again and will keep you all posted on my total weight loss after my 9 days is over.</li>
    <li> I did this to jump start a diet...hoping that I would quickly drop a couple of pounds and use that as motivation to keep at it. Not the smartest thing as this is more for cleansing purposes; therefore, my review might be bias in this regards. Having said this, it didn&#x27;t help me drop any pounds or curve my appetite. If anything I was more hungry because my satiety never does well with just a liquid diet. I also didn&#x27;t feel that it cleansed my body much. The chocolate flavored snacks that were suppose to help with cravings did nothing. At one point I was eating them as if they were candy given their good taste. Overall, this didn&#x27;t work for me but then again I can&#x27;t say it would work for others given that people&#x27;s bodies react differently.</li>
    <li> The service was fast.  Maxine was very courteous with excellent costumer service abilities.  I ordered my shipment on a Sunday and received the package within 3 days.  The product is good, it makes me feel satisfied. I am on my 4th day into the program. I am very happy, I will definitely buy from Maxine again.</li>
    <li> Tried it for a few days but  couldn&#x27;t keep it up. Taste awful</li>
    <li> I tried the 9 day program and it was a stuggle to get through the whole 9 (its really 11 days). The taste of the shakes are horrible and the snacks are even worse... The only thing that was drinkable was the cleanse for life.  I am very disappointed because I wanted to love this product like the other reviewers.  It was impossible to even like...</li>
    <li> Okay first of all it is not always cheaper to order through an isagenix associate so don&#x27;t believe that. They are just trying to make more money for themselves. My product was not expired and worked great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Isagenix worked great for me. I lost 8 pounds on the 9-day system. Is it easy? God no. Is it impossible? Also no. There isn&#x27;t a diet out there that doesn&#x27;t require a clear mind and goals. The people complaining about the tastes of the product seem to have unrealisitc expectations to me. Does the chocolate shake taste like a hershey bar? Nope but it is definitely tolerable and after those deep cleansing days I was practically drooling for it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely encourage others to try this diet.</li>
    <li> I love Isagenix, but you can get a less expensive price, money-back on return orders, and much more support if you sign up with the company directly. Plus, if you like the product, you can become an associate and make some extra spending money while helping others with their health and wellness goals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;healthymommies.isagenix.com</li>
    <li> Great for cleansing and weight loss!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s way over-priced because on top of the product I had to pay outlandish postage and got socked for import duties.  Not worth it!</li>
    <li> Isagenix is not a quick fix. It is life changing so for those who tried it (without really doing it all the way) for a short time and then decide to bad talk the product I see that as misinformation. I do not sell it and I am a huge Isagenix fan. Even my kids love it and trust me they don&#x27;t like much. I have never felt sick or like throwing up. The shakes are completely healthy and designed to give your body what it needs.</li>
    <li> Wasn&#x27;t able to continue losing weight.  Weight loss stopped at a point and I wasn&#x27;t able to continue losing any weight like I wanted to met my goal.</li>
    <li> Overall I am always pleased with this product. It says it is a 9 day program, but it is truly a 11 day program. The first 2 days are &amp;#34;pre-cleanse&amp;#34; days (shake days) It is easiest to start here, to go right into the deep-cleanse days is setting yourself up for failure. Doing the 2 days of shakes to start gets your body to eating less to start with and lets you build up to the first 2 cleanse days. To me the biggest key to making this work without being hungry all the time is to drink water, a lot of it. I probably drink a gallon of water a day when I am doing Isagenix and even more on the deep-cleanse days. I never seem to be hungry when I am dong this cleanse but I always have a water with me and am drinking it all day long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the taste, it is a health product, not a milkshake, what do you expect? It is decent tasting, just put up with it for the 11 days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;More than anything, what it does for me is gets my body used to eating smaller portions after the cleanse is over.</li>
