      <li>Other than that it&#x27;s superb!</li>
      <li>So happy to find this gel - it gives it just enough body to blow-dry it and have it keep its shape.  </li>
      <li>I was suprised how quickly my package arrived, since it came from the East Coast</li>
      <li>This product doesn&#x27;t give me &amp;#34;extra body&amp;#34;, which is great for me, I don&#x27;t need extra body as my hair has more than enough.</li>
      <li>I wondered if I&#x27;d have trouble using my electric brush curler, but it worked great.  </li>
      <li>The bottle is very large and I barely use a 1/4 pump of it, about a dime-sized blob for my hair which is very fine and about shoulder-length.</li>
      <li>Pretty runny consistency</li>
      <li>Does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to</li>
      <li>This gel is great for holding thick hair all day.</li>
      <li>I then rub my hands all through my hair, kind of making my hair full and messy.  </li>
      <li>I am unable to review this product except to say the results are always excellent.</li>
      <li>great product, I have been using this gel for 10 years at least.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s OK, it leaves my hair very crunchy and stiff (which I just scrunch my hair to get rid of crunchiness), which is better than frizzy</li>
      <li>And when dry brushes with more volumn.</li>
      <li>My hair is incredibly fine and fragile.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;d recommend this product to anyone, but especially to those searching for help for their fine hair.  </li>
      <li>Very highly recommended.</li>
      <li>Your wheat-free sculpting gel absolutely made my day.</li>
      <li>Much cheaper than a beauty supply store.  </li>
      <li>why is there a posting on the bottle that says 100% percent free when the producy cost the same as in any store.</li>
      <li>The price was great, and it&#x27;s the only product on the market that controls my hair without making it look stiff</li>
      <li>I have not found any other gel that I love for my hair.</li>
      <li>I have used other Paul Mitchell gels and this one is just okay.</li>
      <li>My husband uses this every day and he has very short, thick, wiry hair and it does a great job.  </li>
      <li>I have a lot of hair, but it&#x27;s very fine, and I have a hard time finding any product that will hold it.  </li>
      <li>some strands stay hard as with most gels.</li>
      <li>I orderd this product and received something completely different.&lt;br /&gt;Very</li>
      <li>this product helps me define each and every curly for a really afro centric curly look.</li>
      <li>is completely gone from your hands.  </li>
      <li>I have natural curls</li>
      <li>my hair is curly and I&#x27;m of african americal decent.  </li>
      <li>I have thick, but fine hair, that wants to be flat.  </li>
      <li>and I have fine, thick hair.  </li>
      <li>The price has increased during the past year and a potential customer may want to compare carefully the price with other competitive gels; however, the product itself is good.</li>

    <li> Use it all the time and love this product.</li>
    <li> As someone with extremely curly and frizzy hair, I bought this off a recommendation from a friend. It&#x27;s OK, it leaves my hair very crunchy and stiff (which I just scrunch my hair to get rid of crunchiness), which is better than frizzy I suppose. My understanding is that this product is not CG-friendly, so be careful if you are doing the CG method and look at the ingredients. The bottle is very large and I barely use a 1/4 pump of it, about a dime-sized blob for my hair which is very fine and about shoulder-length.</li>
    <li> This gel is great for holding thick hair all day.</li>
    <li> Very pleased with product.  I have thick hair and this product helps keep my hair style in place all day.</li>
    <li> satisfy but too thick</li>
    <li> The product arrived in a few days and the packaging held up. I was suprised how quickly my package arrived, since it came from the East Coast and I&#x27;m on the West Coast. I would definately order from this company again.</li>
    <li> Been using this for years. I love it!</li>
    <li> If you have curly hair you must have this. Plain and simple. It is the only thing that holds my curls without frizzing or weighing them down. I have used it for years and will continue to repurchase forever.</li>
    <li> good packaging and shipping.  great product, I have been using this gel for 10 years at least.  It is not sticky and gives the hold I need.</li>
    <li> I have super fine totally straight hair- worst ever!  My hair is so fine when I would try and use a curling iron it would literally slip out!  What to do?  Use this product of course!  Shampoo hair, rub about quarter size dollop on your hair, let dry... Bam!  Hair no longer slips out of the curling iron... It&#x27;s not sticky, it doesn&#x27;t attract dirt... Just love this product...</li>
    <li> I have used this gel for years and years.  (I shudder to think of what my hair would be like without it.)  I have thick, but fine hair, that wants to be flat.  After I wash my hair and dry it, use the curling iron, and comb it out, I put some gel on my hands and rub together.  I then rub my hands all through my hair, kind of making my hair full and messy.  (WASH YOUR HANDS THOUROUGHLY, until the &amp;#34;slick&amp;#34; feel is completely gone from your hands.  Otherwise, when you dry your hands on a towel, it will discolor your towel.)  Let the gel dry on your hair, and you will have loads of body and texture until you wash your hair again.</li>
    <li> Best product ever to make your hair feel much fuller.</li>
    <li> Using this for years.  Love it.</li>
    <li> Excellent product.  Excellent price.  Much cheaper than a beauty supply store.  Does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to do.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll buy it again when I run out.</li>
    <li> I have wavy, frizzy hair. This product doesn&#x27;t give me &amp;#34;extra body&amp;#34;, which is great for me, I don&#x27;t need extra body as my hair has more than enough. I use this product to tame my frizzy hair. It also takes my wavy hair gives me more defined, sexy curls. Even in Florida&#x27;s rainy weather, it&#x27;s amazing! I tried switching to the &amp;#34;curl&amp;#34; Paul Mitchell products, but they don&#x27;t work for my hair. My hair gets puffy as soon as it starts to dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only down side to this product it that, probably since I use a lot (I have long, thick hair) some strands stay hard as with most gels. Other than that it&#x27;s superb! This gel made me apreciate and love my curls!</li>
    <li> Great price, wife&#x27;s happy.</li>
    <li> I LOVE THIS PRODUCT.  IT DOES IT JOB WITHOUT BEING GREASY AND ALOWS YOU TO HAVE THE HOLD AFTER STYLING YOUR HAIR.</li>
    <li> My hair is incredibly fine and fragile.  I was looking for a sculpting gel that didn&#x27;t contain wheat.  The first time I used Paul Mitchell Extra-Body Sculpting Gel, it made my hair feel so thick I wondered if I&#x27;d have trouble using my electric brush curler, but it worked great.  No tangles!  I liked it so well I took it along when I went to the hairdresser.  My hairdresser was also impressed with it, even though she sells an excellent line of hair products, including a gel that unfortunately contains wheat.  Thank you, Paul Mitchell!  Your wheat-free sculpting gel absolutely made my day.</li>
    <li> Love it! I have been using this product since I was about 16. I have not found any other gel that I love for my hair. I have natural curls and I always get complimented on my hair and asked what products I use. Perfect for me!</li>
    <li> MY FAVORITE HAIR PRODUCT EVER!! I DO NOT USE ANYTHING ELSE!!</li>
    <li> This is my husbands favorite gel and l love the sizing, good price.</li>
    <li> The price was great, and it&#x27;s the only product on the market that controls my hair without making it look stiff</li>
    <li> I orderd this product and received something completely different.&lt;br /&gt;Very disappointed...will try one more time...hopefully someone else&lt;br /&gt;in the house can use what was sent.Not worth the trouble to try to&lt;br /&gt;return...</li>
    <li> My husband uses this every day and he has very short, thick, wiry hair and it does a great job.  I have also used this off and on with successful results as well and I have fine, thick hair.  A small amount works so a bottle this size lasts us a year.  Great value!</li>
    <li> I have used other Paul Mitchell gels and this one is just okay. I would say for guys try Paul Mitchell&#x27;s men line of hair gels. For this product it says anyone can use but the product is just so so. Pretty runny consistency but it does the job.</li>
    <li> why is there a posting on the bottle that says 100% percent free when the producy cost the same as in any store. Sounds like false adverising to me</li>
    <li> I have a lot of hair, but it&#x27;s very fine, and I have a hard time finding any product that will hold it.  So happy to find this gel - it gives it just enough body to blow-dry it and have it keep its shape.  I do use a finishing spray along with it, but could not be happier with the product.  Yes, it seems pricey, but I only press the pump once and it is plenty of product for my medium-length hair.  I imagine it will last a long time.  Very highly recommended.</li>

    <li> Great gel!  If you want more body in your hair and have it keep it&#x27;s shape this is the gel to use. I put in on my hair after I wash it when it is wet. And when dry brushes with more volumn. And if you want to spike your hair this keeps your hair in place even in heavy wind.</li>
    <li> Our daughter is a beautician and a must have product is Paul Mitchell styling gel. Since we have in house hair service, after shampoo she works the gel into my wife&#x27;s hair, blow dry with styling brush and voila a magnificent hair do. This product is used in the salon where our daughter works so I make sure there is a supply so she can style. I am unable to review this product except to say the results are always excellent.</li>
