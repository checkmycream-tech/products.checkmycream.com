      <li>Warm.  </li>
      <li>The parfum has a great scent , that stays very long on your body and this is awesome for the price.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very warm and sweet.  </li>
      <li>Best smelling young men&#x27;s spray we have ever found</li>
      <li>This is some of the Best Body around it is Sweet and HOT</li>
      <li>I buy this for my husband, cause it makes him smell like warm cinnamon and almond cookies, easy on the nose.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve never been complemented more on a cologne scent than this one.</li>
      <li>Shipping was outstanding.</li>
      <li>Everyone will love this.  </li>
      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>just OK..</li>
      <li>One of the favorite fragrance.</li>
      <li>My boyfriend has a variety of Bod Body Sprays, and I love them all.  </li>
      <li>I love the way my husband smells wearing this.</li>
      <li>Favorite scent of cologne ever.</li>
      <li>Large bottle of cologne (2.5 ounces) at good price.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s OK if you going nowhere special</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s sweet, sexy, scintillating, tantalizing.  </li>
      <li>This is probably, hands down, the best fragrance that I have ever smelled on a man.  </li>
      <li>and I love to wear this for myself, as I love wearing certain men&#x27;s colognes in the wintertime.  </li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t let the cheap price deter you.  </li>
      <li>They simply love the smell of a fresh clean cologne.</li>
      <li>Apply it very lightly, as too much will be overpowering.  </li>
      <li>for the manufacturer&#x27;s claim that this cologne has an \\&quot;explosive effect on women\\&quot;, my grandson and I have to be honest in stating that we have not encountered any empirical evidence that this statement can be supported.</li>
      <li>Just for fun, I tested this embarrassingly cheap cologne...</li>
      <li>/&gt;However, Body Heat has a nice masculine smell and is not over whelming.</li>
      <li>Sweet.  </li>
      <li>Purchased this for someone because I love the smell so freaking much.</li>
      <li>Not a bad fragrance, just not for me.</li>
      <li>If you are familiar with Bond 9 New Haarlem, then you will love this one.  </li>
      <li>Very nice, modern scent -- not too flowery or sweet and definitely not your dad&#x27;s &amp;#34;Old Spice&amp;#34;.</li>
      <li>a fresh bold sent.</li>
      <li>The reason for the three stars, is that the cologne isn&#x27;t what it used to be, i had it as a body perfume back in 09, and i would put it and stays all the day, and retains its warm and slightly sweet fragrance even for couple of days -no</li>
      <li>Intriguing.</li>
      <li>I honestly can say that I have a lot of female friends and every time they hug me, they wont let me go.</li>
      <li>Had nice comments from several women</li>
      <li>Price is right also.</li>
      <li>Really rich, spicy, masculine sweet cologne.  </li>
      <li>I  ENJOY THE SOFT SMELL</li>
      <li>Smells strongly of vanilla and musk, so if you like the sweetness of JPG Le Male, try it.  </li>
      <li>does he know that it&#x27;s really for me.    </li>
      <li>i get complements from the ladies when i wear this&lt;br /&gt; and always want to know what it&#x27;s called  REALLY</li>
      <li>THIS IS THE CLOSEST TO A REAL  CHICK MAGNET</li>
      <li>My husband said he wants to use it for himself because he likes the way it smells, too.  </li>
      <li>My husband is very fussy and likes wearing this fragrance.  </li>
      <li>It has a light smell that seems to mellow after a short period of time.</li>
      <li>He has used several men&#x27;s colognes over the last year and most have been over powering.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this.  </li>
      <li>Surprised by the high pricing.</li>
      <li>WOW!  </li>
      <li>Mixed with clean male skin, it is irresistible.</li>
      <li>Seems to work well with my personal body chemistry, which is really what cologne is all about.  </li>
      <li>Save more by buying mutiples over 35 dollars for free shipping worked out since these seem impossible to find in any store around.</li>
      <li>When I asked him what he was wearing, he told me that he was wearing something called, \\&quot;Body Heat.\\&quot;  When he last purchased one of the Bod Body Sprays, it came with a free sample of Body Heat, which was on one of those little moist towelettes.  </li>

<li> IT DOES NOT LAST ALL DAY, THE SMELL DOES NOT LAST LONG</li>
<li> Did I mentioned that it also last all day long!</li>
<li> He gets more compliments from the ladies but unfortunately it&#x27;s getting harder to find.  </li>
<li> Only one ive found in a year was part of a sample gift set including 3 other scents.</li>
<li> I&#x27;m amazed how long lasting it is and how little bit of it you use.</li>
<li> He says he only uses a small amount, but the entire house smells and you can smell him coming from 50 feet</li>
<li> Not anymore, or at least not in the same strength...</li>
<li> Little</li>
<li> I have been using body heat for a few years now,and the sent never gets old.&lt;br /&gt;Its</li>
<li> Reminds me of Pi (Givenchy) and Raw Vanilla (Coty).  </li>
<li> Not sure if it&#x27;s being discontinued.</li>
<li> BEEN HARD TO FIND.</li>
<li> At least or me.</li>
<li> Needless to say, I don&#x27;t think he minded it one bit.  </li>
<li> Hope I&#x27;m wrong.</li>
<li> Men --- If you want to drive her crazy, buy it.    </li>
<li> Women --- If you want to drive yourself crazy, buy it.    </li>

    <li> BEEN HARD TO FIND. HAPPY TO ORDER THIS. I  ENJOY THE SOFT SMELL</li>
    <li> My son says he loves this product,  according to him girls can&#x27;t keep away!</li>
    <li> Women are asking me, is that you? You smell so good!</li>
    <li> Just the perfect name for a body spray. I&#x27;ve never been complemented more on a cologne scent than this one.I honestly can say that I have a lot of female friends and every time they hug me, they wont let me go. They simply love the smell of a fresh clean cologne. This body spray will always be my best friend. Did I mentioned that it also last all day long!</li>
    <li> bought as a gift. they loved it</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s OK if you going nowhere special</li>
    <li> My boyfriend has a variety of Bod Body Sprays, and I love them all.  However, one day a couple of weeks ago, he arrived at my house.  I went to hug him, and he smelled absolutely wonderful.  His face, his neck, his chest ... WOW!  I was literally sniffing his face!    When I asked him what he was wearing, he told me that he was wearing something called, \\&quot;Body Heat.\\&quot;  When he last purchased one of the Bod Body Sprays, it came with a free sample of Body Heat, which was on one of those little moist towelettes.  He rubbed it on his check, his neck, and his face.  Well, that was it for me!  I searched until I found it, and now it is one of his Christmas gifts.  Little does he know that it&#x27;s really for me.    This is probably, hands down, the best fragrance that I have ever smelled on a man.  I can&#x27;t begin to find the words to describe it.  It&#x27;s sweet, sexy, scintillating, tantalizing.  I swear!  I was literally grabbing his face in my hands so that I could sniff his skin.  Needless to say, I don&#x27;t think he minded it one bit.  He giggled and laughed at my response.    Men --- If you want to drive her crazy, buy it.    Women --- If you want to drive yourself crazy, buy it.    I will definitely be keeping my man stocked with this fragrance.  It&#x27;s incredible!</li>
    <li> One of the favorite fragrance. Shipping was outstanding. I am vary happy with this deal......</li>
    <li> This is some of the Best Body around it is Sweet and HOT and if you put it on all the ladies will like you</li>
    <li> Awesome cologne and reasonable price.  Had nice comments from several women so it&#x27;s all good!!</li>
    <li> I love the way my husband smells wearing this.</li>
    <li> I went out cologne shopping for husband.  I am what you would call a \\&quot;high-end\\&quot; purchaser, and would have paid quite a bit for a nice cologne.  Just for fun, I tested this embarrassingly cheap cologne...I was floored.  Really rich, spicy, masculine sweet cologne.  I bought it immediately and bought a back-up bottle.  This ranks with some of the high-end fragrances.  I highly recommend this.  I had to steal sniffs of it after I brought it home.</li>
    <li> THIS COLOGNE IS VERY PLEASANT AND I USE IT ALOT, BUT IT DOES NOT LAST ALL DAY, THE SMELL DOES NOT LAST LONG AT ALL. BUT I STILL LIKE IT!</li>
    <li> Favorite scent of cologne ever. Surprised by the high pricing. Save more by buying mutiples over 35 dollars for free shipping worked out since these seem impossible to find in any store around. Only one ive found in a year was part of a sample gift set including 3 other scents.</li>
    <li> I buy this for my husband, cause it makes him smell like warm cinnamon and almond cookies, easy on the nose. I have had several surgeries for my nose, and take medicated rinses which enhance my sense of smell. So to me it matters!!!</li>
    <li> Sex in a bottle!  Smells strongly of vanilla and musk, so if you like the sweetness of JPG Le Male, try it.  It also has that juxtaposition of sweet/raunch that Angel for women has.  Intriguing. Apply it very lightly, as too much will be overpowering.  Just a bit will be aphrodisiacal. Mixed with clean male skin, it is irresistible.</li>
    <li> The reason for the three stars, is that the cologne isn&#x27;t what it used to be, i had it as a body perfume back in 09, and i would put it and stays all the day, and retains its warm and slightly sweet fragrance even for couple of days -no joke. Not anymore, or at least not in the same strength...i can see that now it is muskier but fades in like 4-5 hours. Nonetheless, i still appreciate the fragrance</li>
    <li> Large bottle of cologne (2.5 ounces) at good price. Very nice, modern scent -- not too flowery or sweet and definitely not your dad&#x27;s &amp;#34;Old Spice&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> Great men&#x27;s cologne!  My husband is very fussy and likes wearing this fragrance.  He gets more compliments from the ladies but unfortunately it&#x27;s getting harder to find.  Not sure if it&#x27;s being discontinued. Hope I&#x27;m wrong.</li>
    <li> I have been using body heat for a few years now,and the sent never gets old.&lt;br /&gt;Its a fresh bold sent.I love it.Yes I would recommend it.</li>
    <li> i get complements from the ladies when i wear this&lt;br /&gt; and always want to know what it&#x27;s called  REALLY IT GETS THE LADIES ATTENTION  !!!!!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt; THIS IS THE CLOSEST TO A REAL  CHICK MAGNET YOU CAN GET  !!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> my husband always get compliments when he wears it&lt;br /&gt;thanks again for offering this product at a fraction of the cost&lt;br /&gt;not a knock off cologne</li>
    <li> Someone told me about this cologne.  I&#x27;m amazed how long lasting it is and how little bit of it you use.</li>
    <li> Purchased this for someone because I love the smell so freaking much.</li>
    <li> Not what is based on reviews I read here.  just OK..</li>
    <li> At least or me. Not a bad fragrance, just not for me. Gave it to my sons. No feedback yet.</li>
    <li> I purchased this cologne at my grandson&#x27;s request. He has used several men&#x27;s colognes over the last year and most have been over powering. He says he only uses a small amount, but the entire house smells and you can smell him coming from 50 feet away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, Body Heat has a nice masculine smell and is not over whelming. It has a light smell that seems to mellow after a short period of time. It is definitely an improvement from the off the shelf colognes at the local drug store.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the manufacturer&#x27;s claim that this cologne has an \\&quot;explosive effect on women\\&quot;, my grandson and I have to be honest in stating that we have not encountered any empirical evidence that this statement can be supported. However, we are not totally discounting this claim, since we have not conducted a statistically bona fide sampling of how women are effect by the fragrance. We will keep you posted on any further developments should they arise.</li>
    <li> I am a woman and I love to wear this for myself, as I love wearing certain men&#x27;s colognes in the wintertime.  It&#x27;s very warm and sweet.  My husband said he wants to use it for himself because he likes the way it smells, too.  Reminds me of Pi (Givenchy) and Raw Vanilla (Coty).  Not a dupe, but in that same family of scents.</li>
    <li> Best smelling young men&#x27;s spray we have ever found</li>
    <li> Seems to work well with my personal body chemistry, which is really what cologne is all about.  Price is right also.</li>
    <li> Just walk up to her, whisper in her ear, &amp;#34;You, me, VIP,&amp;#34; and you&#x27;re set.</li>
    <li> The parfum has a great scent , that stays very long on your body and this is awesome for the price.</li>
    <li> If you are familiar with Bond 9 New Haarlem, then you will love this one.  Don&#x27;t let the cheap price deter you.  This is a great fragrance.  Sweet.  Warm.  Inviting.  Everyone will love this.  Good for men or women.  Very attractive scent.</li>
