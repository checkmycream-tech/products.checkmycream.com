      <li>I would surely recommend these shadows to a friend or anyone.</li>
      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>I am extremely satisfied</li>
      <li>Love this</li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t really found the perfect way to use this eyeshadow, but I think its worth a try if you are wanting purple.</li>
      <li>I love this color eye shadow-</li>
      <li>Some of the prettiest most pigmented shades on the market.</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;d imagine it&#x27;s mostly for evening wear, although I used it for daytime use as well.  </li>
      <li>The silver at the top is very glittery which is awesome because it&#x27;s rare that you find this type of eyeshadow in a set like this.  </li>
      <li>It came in great time and packaged very well.</li>
      <li>I love these eyeshadows.</li>
      <li>I just love wearing it like this day and night....</li>
      <li>I also top my outer-v with lorac pro palette matte shade in brown.  </li>
      <li>and it gives them a really sexy smoky feel and look.</li>
      <li>Love the purple.</li>
      <li>Nice and smooth.</li>
      <li>the glitter section is my favorite</li>
      <li>Have 4 more just like it.  </li>
      <li>Again, I don&#x27;t love them.</li>
      <li>i like more emerald, jewel toned greens,</li>
      <li>I couldn&#x27;t have chosen a better eyeshadow.</li>
      <li>I get so many compliments and nobody can believe that I&#x27;m wearing drugstore makeup.  </li>
      <li>The top shadow is chunky, but I like to top it off with stilas foil eyeshadow and you wouldn&#x27;t believe all of the compliments I receive on my shadow.  </li>
      <li>all are very rich and flattering...</li>
      <li>They are beautiful and classy.</li>
      <li>The colors were nicely pigmented, and lasted long with the use of a primer, for night time you can easily change up the effect by applying the glitter, it looks beautiful..</li>
      <li>The colors are bright, and very purple.</li>
      <li>easy to clean off and easy to clean your brushes.</li>
      <li>Goes on smooth.</li>
      <li>I love the colorful purple selection in this palette.</li>
      <li>Again, it&#x27;s very rare to find this element of \\&quot;glitter\\&quot; in an eyeshadow set</li>
      <li>Still very easy to work with the colors and very blendable, and even though the colors are frosted, they don&#x27;t show up as shiny or tacky-looking.</li>
      <li>You can go more natural (using the light colors) or sultry sexy (using the darker colors) all with the colors provided here.  </li>
      <li>The idea is great and maybe another type of application would work better, maybe wetting the brush a little, I don&#x27;t know.  </li>
      <li>Wife wants more and will order again.</li>
      <li>these are probably chalky and yucky, but when you use Urban Decays primer potion and mix this with it and then apply you get the perfect color combination with shadow that will last all day.</li>
      <li>You can wear the colors whatever way you would like, I personally like the lighter colors more :)</li>
      <li>Beautiful with green eyes.</li>
      <li>Pretty colors, personally wouldn&#x27;t wear all of them, just have one I really think looks ok, but love the glitter!</li>
      <li>When I put them on wet which is my favorite way to wear it these colors still maintain their shine but almost as if they are matted which I love</li>
      <li>The purple triangle to the right is also very glittery, much like the silver at the top.  </li>
      <li>I liked the colors but just had to add a little more to make it work better and last longer</li>
      <li>They are great for someone not sure how to do their makeup, these are foolproof.</li>
      <li>Kinda a small amount of eye shadow but the color combinations will work great.</li>
      <li>They blend smoothly and they appear very soft.</li>
      <li>Though the dry look is great especially for summer ;-)  </li>
      <li>The other colors will complement nicely.</li>
      <li>If you like cool purples and more minty pale greens</li>
      <li>I REALLY like this shade and use it often.</li>
      <li>It looks really trashy</li>
      <li>Very silky and blendable colors...</li>
      <li>and I don&#x27;t really like the colors in either pallet a whole</li>
      <li>and I really like this as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not a big fan of quads or eyeshadow kits/sets but this one, by far, is my favorite that I&#x27;ve ever purchased.  </li>
      <li>I love the commercial that sows this same exact color</li>
      <li>Beautiful colors and an unbelievable price!!!</li>
      <li>When you do get it on it&#x27;s a very junior high look.</li>
      <li>glad to see the price came down.</li>
      <li>The colors are vibrant from lightest to darkest.</li>
      <li>My wife loves this particular eyeshadow and it is no longer found in stores</li>
      <li>Highly recommended if you like pink/purple.  </li>
      <li>The dark liner shade is the only one that&#x27;s a warm purple.</li>
      <li>you could put a thick layer on the lid and put a light layer of color on top to get a slightly similar look.</li>
      <li>They are beautiful, they come in purple, pink, blue , green, and brown.</li>
      <li>Maybelline New York Eye Studio Color Explosion Luminizing Eyeshadow in Amethyst Ablazed is one of my favorites.</li>
      <li>Maybelline New York Eye Studio Color Explosion Luminizing Eyeshadow, Caffeine Rush 05, 0.09 Ounce]]</li>
      <li>I love the way the colors go one dry and wet.</li>
      <li>The light pink shade at the bottom is the basic lid color.  </li>
      <li>Absolutely on parr with my Urban Decay Palettes.</li>
      <li>Colors were pigmented and showed up very well against my blue eyelids.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Very silky and blendable colors...all are very rich and flattering...my only irritation with this product is the luminizer...very little pay-off and travels all over the face, not sticking well to the shadows.  The idea is great and maybe another type of application would work better, maybe wetting the brush a little, I don&#x27;t know.  Still very easy to work with the colors and very blendable, and even though the colors are frosted, they don&#x27;t show up as shiny or tacky-looking.</li>
    <li> Kinda a small amount of eye shadow but the color combinations will work great. Love the purple. The other colors will complement nicely.</li>
    <li> The colors are vibrant from lightest to darkest. Great way to make my brown eyes &amp;#34;pop&amp;#34; a bit.</li>
    <li> Have 4 more just like it.  Love this</li>
    <li> Beautiful with green eyes. These are beautiful purples . the glitter section is my favorite some of them are very shimmery and other or flat but you can pick and choose which colors go on your eyes , this is very beautiful colors.</li>
    <li> U cant find these in the stores anymore so i buy them from amazon. They are beautiful, they come in purple, pink, blue , green, and brown. They are great for someone not sure how to do their makeup, these are foolproof.</li>
    <li> Pretty colors, personally wouldn&#x27;t wear all of them, just have one I really think looks ok, but love the glitter!</li>
    <li> i bought it from walmart the 2nd week it came out. it was like 15 bucks. glad to see the price came down. now the glitter ends up all over the place. not a problem for me because i like glittery skin but for others its a problem. you could put a thick layer on the lid and put a light layer of color on top to get a slightly similar look. shadows are great all over the light-medium purple works for a light blush aswell. the colors are alot darker than shown in the picture but very beautiful and silky. easy to clean off and easy to clean your brushes.</li>
    <li> All of it was broken due to poor packaging - colors not what I&#x27;d expected - I wouldn&#x27;t order again.</li>
    <li> I love these eyeshadows. They are beautiful and classy. You can wear the colors whatever way you would like, I personally like the lighter colors more :)</li>
    <li> Looks great, has the shimmer my Girl friend was looking for it has a metallic look to it &amp; this is what she loves.</li>
    <li> I love the colorful purple selection in this palette. The color&#x27;s are bright and I love them. Goes on smooth.</li>
    <li> I get lots of compliments whenever I wear this!</li>
    <li> I personally love sparkles in my eye shadows. Not only does each color have sparkles in each color, there is a sparkle layer in it as well. Maybelline&#x27;s eye shadow lasts longer on me than any other brand. I love it. I can not find this product in any stores anymore. I am extremely satisfied</li>
    <li> The colors are bright, and very purple. The silver is verrrry shimmery. I haven&#x27;t really found the perfect way to use this eyeshadow, but I think its worth a try if you are wanting purple.</li>
    <li> My wife loves this particular eyeshadow and it is no longer found in stores so it was great finding it on Amazon. Made her very happy.</li>
    <li> Beautiful colors and an unbelievable price!!!</li>
    <li> wonderful beautiful colors</li>
    <li> I love the Maybelline Eye Studio Color Explosion Luminizing Eyeshadow. Needs a shorter name though. This purple set is one of my favorites, the sparkle shade picks up all colors.</li>
    <li> The eyeshadow in this compact are just the colors I was looking for.</li>
    <li> I have this in two colors, the Amethyst Ablazed, and Forest Fury. I purchased them at the same time when they were brand new. I wish I had only gotten one, to try it out. Then I would not have wasted my money on the second. I am a sucker for purples and greens and I don&#x27;t really like the colors in either pallet a whole lot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Amethyst pallet has blue based, cool purples, not warm purples. The dark liner shade is the only one that&#x27;s a warm purple. I REALLY like this shade and use it often. It looks great with brown eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Green pallet has a limeish color and a minty blueish color. Again, I don&#x27;t love them. i like more emerald, jewel toned greens, richer. The liner is a deeper forest green and I really like this as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The luminizer is terrible. I used it once with both color pallets and I will never use it again. It&#x27;s just glitter. It looks really trashy and it doesn&#x27;t stay. It&#x27;s hard to get on the makeup brush (I don&#x27;t use the spongey thing) then it doesn&#x27;t stick well. When you do get it on it&#x27;s a very junior high look. An hour later, and it&#x27;s fallen all over the place. I recommend skipping this step and just using the regular eyeshadows and liners.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The eyeshadows blend together nicely and have good color coverage. If you like cool purples and more minty pale greens then these two pallets are good enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As it is for me though, I only use the liner with both.</li>
    <li> Used for make up on a costume with blue skin.  Colors were pigmented and showed up very well against my blue eyelids.  The silver is very striking and shimmery.</li>
    <li> Bought this to wear for my wedding, it was sooooo beautiful, and matched my dress perfectly! I couldn&#x27;t have chosen a better eyeshadow. And the glittery powder at the top just made it perfect and glamorous!</li>
    <li> This is for people who don&#x27;t like the Color Tattoo line because it&#x27;s a cream.  This is a powder set.  What&#x27;s nice about these is that the colors in this set go nicely for daytime use as well as for the evening as well.  What I like about this set is that you can diversify your look by the use of the colors provided.  You can go more natural (using the light colors) or sultry sexy (using the darker colors) all with the colors provided here.  The light pink shade at the bottom is the basic lid color.  The silver at the top is very glittery which is awesome because it&#x27;s rare that you find this type of eyeshadow in a set like this.  The purple triangle to the right is also very glittery, much like the silver at the top.  Again, it&#x27;s very rare to find this element of \\&quot;glitter\\&quot; in an eyeshadow set and I&#x27;d imagine it&#x27;s mostly for evening wear, although I used it for daytime use as well.  I&#x27;m not a big fan of quads or eyeshadow kits/sets but this one, by far, is my favorite that I&#x27;ve ever purchased.  Highly recommended if you like pink/purple.  I also recommend [[ASIN:B004Y9L6WE Maybelline New York Eye Studio Color Explosion Luminizing Eyeshadow, Caffeine Rush 05, 0.09 Ounce]] as well if you like golds/browns.</li>
    <li> The colors were nicely pigmented, and lasted long with the use of a primer, for night time you can easily change up the effect by applying the glitter, it looks beautiful..</li>
    <li> I chose this rating because it was the best. These are my favorite colors. They blend smoothly and they appear very soft. I would surely recommend these shadows to a friend or anyone.</li>
    <li> I liked the colors but just had to add a little more to make it work better and last longer</li>
    <li> It looks way bigger than the actual package is! Very small for the price and shipping! Just go to your local store to buy this!</li>
    <li> I am replacing an old one with this one. Can&#x27;t find it elsewhere. It came in great time and packaged very well. Beings i have hazel green eyes this color group is great for me. Hard to find color that pops like these. Very happy with the item and seller. I would definitely order again. Be happy and buy. A+++ peace</li>
    <li> Great product and is exactly as described. Great value for the money and nice selection of colors. Wife wants more and will order again.</li>
    <li> Shades a little too dark.</li>
    <li> Relieved it in less than half the estimated time (:</li>
    <li> Maybelline New York Eye Studio Color Explosion Luminizing Eyeshadow in Amethyst Ablazed is one of my favorites. I love the way the colors go one dry and wet. Nice and smooth. When I put them on wet which is my favorite way to wear it these colors still maintain their shine but almost as if they are matted which I love and it gives them a really sexy smoky feel and look. When wet you also get a heavier look with your color so it&#x27;s great for nighttime. I just love wearing it like this day and night....I just go lighter with my brush strokes during the day-but I still prefer the smokey look with matted shine/sparkle during day than putting it on dry. Though the dry look is great especially for summer ;-)  The blue and Amethyst are two of my favs along with their Pink Punch!</li>
    <li> I love this color eye shadow- they stopped making it and I haven&#x27;t found a comparable one since</li>
    <li> I love the commercial that sows this same exact color the girl on it looks great so I had to get the look</li>
    <li> love these colors!! its ahrd to find amazing bright colors that go on the color they look.</li>
    <li> I get so many compliments and nobody can believe that I&#x27;m wearing drugstore makeup.  I&#x27;m a makeup Junkie I live at Ulta and Sephora, but here lately I&#x27;m discovering theres a lot to go on about with these shadows.  Used alone these are probably chalky and yucky, but when you use Urban Decays primer potion and mix this with it and then apply you get the perfect color combination with shadow that will last all day. I also top my outer-v with lorac pro palette matte shade in brown.  The top shadow is chunky, but I like to top it off with stilas foil eyeshadow and you wouldn&#x27;t believe all of the compliments I receive on my shadow.  Try it!!!</li>
    <li> I have been using and loving this compact (and all other shadows in this line) for years, I have emptied the blue, green, and purple varieties of color explosion twice now.  Some of the prettiest most pigmented shades on the market. Absolutely on parr with my Urban Decay Palettes. You cannot go wrong with this product.</li>
