      <li>It doesn&#x27;t smell good.</li>
      <li>And now with the sport coming out it still smells great and kind of fruity/sporty.</li>

      <li>It has a kind of overwhelming fragance.</li>

      <li>Its for THEM to like :)</li>
      <li>the ladies will love you more if you wear this woman magnet scent....</li>
      <li>/&gt;The ladies love it.</li>
      <li>Extremely satisfied...</li>
      <li>I will always love that perfume.&lt;br /&gt;Code</li>
      <li>Though this is my favorite</li>
      <li>I just love this cologne!(I&#x27;m posting this under my wife&#x27;s Amazon account because I don&#x27;t have one)</li>
      <li>I love the smell and everything about it.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m really glad that i buyed this</li>
      <li>and I love it.</li>
      <li>i love wearing this fragrance at nite...</li>
      <li>but the reviews misled me, its scent is just okay</li>
      <li>Definitely my favorite.</li>
      <li>I have gotten so many complements from the girls.</li>
      <li>SO BE ADVISED, this scent is SEXY.</li>
      <li>I got a sample of this in a magazine and thought it was a nice twist on the original.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a great young men&#x27;s scent.</li>
      <li>still use this cologne from time to time, but not always since it is extremely strong.</li>
      <li>Its good, citric, IMO it is kind of similar to issey miyake.</li>
      <li>I felt he would enjoy this spray better than the original .  </li>
      <li>Perfect aromoa blend of citrus and floral smells, reminds me of orange blossums a little bit, if you have ever ridden Disney Lands California Adventure \\&quot;Sorin over California\\</li>
      <li>It would wear just as well out, though, and has a memorable, unique, bold scent without being overpowering.</li>
      <li>and i proudly say armani,Ill def be ordering another bottle in the future.</li>
      <li>O have been using this product for the last month or so, and have had a great response from people about it.</li>
      <li>Is not like original Parfum</li>
      <li>Well worth the money!</li>
      <li>Although it depends on each person&#x27;s skin, this perfume has a unique scent.</li>
      <li>I find that is true in myself.</li>
      <li>The top notez really take u away...</li>
      <li>Can be overly strong when first applied, so use sparingly.</li>
      <li>It smells nice and crisp and you don&#x27;t need more than one spray to last throughout the day.</li>
      <li>He was pleased not to have gotten the original Code as he felt it was too old for him.</li>
      <li>I really like it, and perhaps more importantly, my girlfriend really likes it, too.</li>
      <li>long lasting and one of the best fragrances i&#x27;ve used</li>
      <li>Original code has been around for years, and is a wonderful, classic scent, but overly complex for every day.</li>
      <li>This is my favorite cologne by far.</li>
      <li>I smelled a perfume while walking into walmart that instantly brought back days of summer and a beautiful girl I had known some years ago.</li>
      <li>If you&#x27;re a single guy, you better get this!</li>
      <li>I already own the regular Armani Code and love this one just the same.  </li>
      <li>but I believe this cologne alone is responsible for getting me pregnant.  </li>
      <li>In fact, it is strong enough that more than one spray is overpowering, which is good because the bottle will last long.</li>
      <li>If you can find it in the store first, go smell it before ordering it.</li>
      <li>one of my favorites, maybe the first.</li>
      <li>Exactly as it should be.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve had women stop me and ask what I was wearing.  ; )  </li>
      <li>I really like this cologne!</li>
      <li>You should have this one because womans really like the smell!</li>
      <li>Great smell, long lasting.</li>
      <li>Sport is a new cologne, released in June of 2011, so it is a young scent, with a fresh, clean, crisp smell.</li>
      <li>I really enjoy wearing it, and will continue to do so in the future.</li>
      <li>I am a regular wearer of Giorgio Armani Code, and I have to say I also enjoy this sport version as well.  </li>
      <li>I just wish it were available in a smaller travel size.</li>
      <li>I really like this stuff.</li>
      <li>It really popz</li>
      <li>I asked Amazon if I could pay for a new top piece from the manufacturer, as a long shot.</li>
      <li>I bought this because many other perfumes could not ship to my address for some reason.</li>
      <li>I feel like I identify with this scent, because like me, it is original, currently under appreciated and destined to become a classic.</li>
      <li>I picked up about 6 different samples from the cologne girl at Dillard&#x27;s who was nice enough to fill me up some little sample bottles of different new or popular colognes.</li>
      <li>I was really surprised that good guy Amazon not only said this wasn&#x27;t possible, but they wouldn&#x27;t let me exchange it for another bottle of the same cologne.</li>
      <li>Very clean but long lasting fragrance...</li>
      <li>Aspect manly but very soft scent.</li>
      <li>I have been buying the Code Sport since I first received it as a present a year ago</li>
      <li>The Sport is so simple, clean and fresh, that I want to take it with me, to spray on after the gym, or maybe to squirt a little in the car, on my clothes, stuff like that.</li>

    <li> Smells AMAZIN!! GET IT!</li>
    <li> Armani code sport is a great choice , I love it&#x27;s smell , it&#x27;s neither very heavy or light , well at least it&#x27;s what i like . I&#x27;d recommend it .</li>
    <li> I have been buying the Code Sport since I first received it as a present a year ago and it&#x27;s my fav, besides being voted the fav by women.</li>
    <li> I love this scent for men!  I&#x27;m sure I will purchase this item again!  I received my order in a timely fashion.</li>
    <li> I just love this cologne!(I&#x27;m posting this under my wife&#x27;s Amazon account because I don&#x27;t have one) I&#x27;ve been wearing it for about 2 years now and women just love it! I always get the&amp;#34;Wow you smell good!&amp;#34; comment at least 3 to 4 times a week but natural body scent also has a lot to do with it. If you&#x27;re a single guy, you better get this!, it&#x27;s on point with the ladies!!</li>
    <li> Its good, citric, IMO it is kind of similar to issey miyake. Long lasting and girls really like. Not loving it but I like it.</li>
    <li> Great perfume. My boyfriend loved it. And also dud I. It smells really good. Will defintely buy it again soon.</li>
    <li> My boyfriend wears it &amp; I adore it. The scent lasts a very long time. His clothes smell like it even after being washed! Well worth the money!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not impressed with the smell but the women seem to like it. If you can find it in the store first, go smell it before ordering it.</li>
    <li> Unfortunately, I only got to use a little bit of this. The sprayer popped off while using it in my car, flew to the back and got lost under the seat after it fell through the seatbelt hole. I asked Amazon if I could pay for a new top piece from the manufacturer, as a long shot. I was really surprised that good guy Amazon not only said this wasn&#x27;t possible, but they wouldn&#x27;t let me exchange it for another bottle of the same cologne.</li>
    <li> Georgio Armani I ordered this version of Code for my son who is going to be 30 this year.  I felt he would enjoy this spray better than the original .  It arrived in plenty of time to wrap for Christmas and was well received by my son.  He was pleased not to have gotten the original Code as he felt it was too old for him.</li>
    <li> Great smell, long lasting. Can be overly strong when first applied, so use sparingly. I&#x27;ve put it on in the morning, worked all day, went to the gym, and was told I smelt great after the gym workout. So yeah, great cologne.</li>
    <li> its item that i looked for,and it is on top of my expectations! I&#x27;m really glad that i buyed this</li>
    <li> I really like this cologne! You should have this one because womans really like the smell!</li>
    <li> the ladies will love you more if you wear this woman magnet scent....compliments galore did i receive from the ladies</li>
    <li> I bought this because many other perfumes could not ship to my address for some reason. I thought this one would be a good choice but the reviews misled me, its scent is just okay but not the best.</li>
    <li> HAVE TO BEAT THE WOMEN OFF WHEN I PUT THIS STUFF ON THIS WOULD MAKE LINUS SMELL GOOD lUCY WOULD BE ALL OVER HIM.</li>
    <li> Although it depends on each person&#x27;s skin, this perfume has a unique scent. It goes well on the day and night. Aspect manly but very soft scent. one of my favorites, maybe the first.</li>
    <li> Perfect aromoa blend of citrus and floral smells, reminds me of orange blossums a little bit, if you have ever ridden Disney Lands California Adventure \\&quot;Sorin over California\\&quot; that&#x27;s what the smell reminds me of.</li>
    <li> Is not like original Parfum</li>
    <li> Excelente Producto y vendedor Muy atento lo recomiendo al 100% era Justo Lo Que estÃ¡ba Buscando saludos desde venezuela Erick Lopez</li>
    <li> This is one of the best smelling perfumes I&#x27;ve had. It&#x27;s Armani code but it has that citrus smell instead of powdery.</li>
    <li> I already own the regular Armani Code and love this one just the same.  Not very strong but I always get compliments wherever I go.</li>
    <li> I wear this at work, and I almost always get compliments or questions. Definitely my favorite. It lasts a long time as well.</li>
    <li> What can i say imput this on and im even more popular.  Man i smell gooooood.  Thats it im a beast and so is the cologne… .</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this cologne! I have gotten so many complements from the girls. It smells nice and crisp and you don&#x27;t need more than one spray to last throughout the day. In fact, it is strong enough that more than one spray is overpowering, which is good because the bottle will last long. Really great, fully recommend.</li>
    <li> I get compliments on this everywhere I go, as a man I never tire of hearing the words &amp;#34; wow you smell good&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite cologne by far. I.went to macys ti get it like I always do, and the cost was $92.  Though this is my favorite I couldn&#x27;t justify spending that amount on a bottle of cologne.  That night it hit me... why not check Amazon?  So happy I did!! After shipping and taxes I paid less than half!  Extremely satisfied... and I smell good too :)</li>
    <li> I bought this one as a birthday gift, and my friend loves it! It looks like it&#x27;s really good for guys!</li>
    <li> I am a regular wearer of Giorgio Armani Code, and I have to say I also enjoy this sport version as well.  Similar, with a bit of a sharper edge to it.  Exactly as it should be.</li>
    <li> My husband has the Armani Code and I love it. I got a sample of this in a magazine and thought it was a nice twist on the original. Can&#x27;t beat the price on Amazon!</li>
    <li> There is a difference between Code and Code Sport. Love the Sport! I&#x27;ve had women stop me and ask what I was wearing.  ; )  A little goes a long way!</li>
    <li> The Delivery was fast, the product came in perfect condition, The smell is amazing and i get compliments on it all the time, its not overpowering and it lasts for a long time. people ask me what is it that im wearing and i proudly say armani,Ill def be ordering another bottle in the future. after all you can&#x27;t go wrong with armani. smelling good with armani ftw.</li>
    <li> In a cologne, I like to stick with classics. Sometimes a scent is well received because it has been around long enough for people to associate it&#x27;s smell with a good memory. I find that is true in myself. I smelled a perfume while walking into walmart that instantly brought back days of summer and a beautiful girl I had known some years ago. I will always love that perfume.&lt;br /&gt;Code Sport is a new cologne, released in June of 2011, so it is a young scent, with a fresh, clean, crisp smell. Masculine, but not dark or overly complex. I picked up about 6 different samples from the cologne girl at Dillard&#x27;s who was nice enough to fill me up some little sample bottles of different new or popular colognes. Gucci Guilty, LeMale, Burberry, and several others.&lt;br /&gt;I liked Guilty, but the one that really stood out to me was the Aramis Code Sport. Original code has been around for years, and is a wonderful, classic scent, but overly complex for every day. The Sport is so simple, clean and fresh, that I want to take it with me, to spray on after the gym, or maybe to squirt a little in the car, on my clothes, stuff like that. It would wear just as well out, though, and has a memorable, unique, bold scent without being overpowering. I feel like I identify with this scent, because like me, it is original, currently under appreciated and destined to become a classic. I really like it, and perhaps more importantly, my girlfriend really likes it, too.</li>
    <li> I would give this cologne a 5 STAR rating but I believe this cologne alone is responsible for getting me pregnant.  The husband likes to wear this scent when I&#x27;m mad at him and it makes me so angry that I can&#x27;t stay mad at him, and anyway, sexual encounters usually entail. SO BE ADVISED, this scent is SEXY.</li>
    <li> Just got this in the mail yesterday and love the wonderful fragrance. I have the armani code and have been a big fan. And now with the sport coming out it still smells great and kind of fruity/sporty. If you are a fan of cologne you can&#x27;t go wrong with this purchase. Great price amazon&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
    <li> O have been using this product for the last month or so, and have had a great response from people about it. I really enjoy wearing it, and will continue to do so in the future.</li>
    <li> I really like this stuff. It smells a bit similar to Acqua Di Gio but in a way that it only smells familiar and not easily recognized right away. I like that and the difference it adds.</li>
    <li> Great smell. My girlfriend loves it and that is all that matters!!!</li>
    <li> I keep a bottle at home and one at the gym. I just wish it were available in a smaller travel size.</li>
    <li> Very clean but long lasting fragrance... The top notez really take u away...i love wearing this fragrance at nite... It really popz</li>
    <li> this is my 3rd bottle of Armani Sport. long lasting and one of the best fragrances i&#x27;ve used and i have used quite a lot</li>
    <li> This is one of the best colognes out in the market. I love the smell and everything about it. My husband had used this specific brand for the last 3 years and now does not want to change.</li>
    <li> Good and strong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I still use this cologne from time to time, but not always since it is extremely strong.</li>
    <li> I like it, and would give this 4 stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HOWEVER&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ladies love it. And, in the end, eau de toilette is not for you to like. Its for THEM to like :)</li>
    <li> I wanted to get my boyfriend a cologne so I went to Macy&#x27;s and smelled this one and ordered it off Amazon because it&#x27;s cheaper and smells just as great!  When I have it to him he loved it!</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t smell good. It has a kind of overwhelming fragance. My wife says that it&#x27;s not a sexy cologne. I&#x27;m still looking for someone to to give it away.[[ASIN:B00554ABIC Giorgio Armani Code Sport for Men Eau De Toilette Spray, 2.5 Ounce]]</li>
    <li> I bought this as a Christmas gift for my brother. It&#x27;s a great young men&#x27;s scent. I&#x27;d def recommend this. I think it would gear towards ages 19-35</li>
    <li> Shopped AMAZON for the best price on a spray bottle of this cologne, was THE best price at the time for SPORT CODE by ARMANI, so much so that I ordered two bottles for my husband! Smells great, manly, heavenly, handsome, you name it, we love it! Came well packed, very satisfied, will order again!</li>
