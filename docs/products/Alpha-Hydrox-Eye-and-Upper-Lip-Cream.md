### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>and I&#x27;m very happy with the line</li>
      <li>Great cream, Can&#x27;t beat it!</li>
      <li>Excellent product, great price.</li>
      <li>Great product.</li>
      <li>Great pricing online with this vendot.</li>
      <li>Was happy to find Alpha Hydrox on Amazon.  </li>
      <li>Hopefully it will be good</li>
      <li>Feels good on the skin.</li>
      <li>GOOD TIME SHIPPING</li>
      <li>But the amazing thing has been my lip line.  </li>
      <li>Nice for price and does not ball up under make up application.</li>
      <li>But I really liked the results, until that allergic reaction</li>
      <li>so I&#x27;m sure it will be awhile before I see any kind of results.  </li>
      <li>but if I was to pick a favorite this would be it.</li>
      <li>I love all of the Alpha Hydrox products.</li>
      <li>My skin looks better than it has in years.</li>
      <li>I love the shower gel.</li>
      <li>Can&#x27;t ask for more than that.  </li>
      <li>This is especially good for dry eyes!</li>
      <li>I have other Alpha Hydrox products, which I love, but this one is especially great.  </li>
      <li>Also I have to say the products have a strong chemical smell and taste if you happen to accidentally get some on your lips.  </li>
      <li>I used to have to keep my foundation and powder away from the upper lip area because it just sat on the surface and never looked good, but since I&#x27;ve been using this cream that skin is as healthy as the rest of my face.</li>
      <li>I live in a hot, humid country and have oily skin with a tendency to whiteheads and as time passes the fine lines are becoming more defined.</li>
      <li>The cream itself is light and non greasy and makes under my eyes look soft and smooth</li>
      <li>It is also very reasonably priced.</li>
      <li>Went with only using it at night with another eye cream on top of it.</li>
      <li>This one is more concentrated for those upper lip lines and under eye wrinkles.  </li>
      <li>This has really smoothes out my eyelids and actually makes eyebrow maintinence better.  </li>
      <li>Before the skin was puckered and beginning to get lines, I&#x27;m 53 but have been noticing problems for at least 3 years, but now it&#x27;s nice and smooth.</li>
      <li>Certainly no lessening of the fine lines or the whiteheads when compared to other more easily attainable products.</li>
      <li>This product is very lightweight, and within hours seems just to be gone.  </li>
      <li>It is also very inexpensive.  </li>
      <li>It is a reasonably price cream that works.  </li>
      <li>didn&#x27;t notice any real difference in my skin or improvement</li>
      <li>I have used other eye area products that have a more substantial consistency, and thus remain in place, protecting and moisturising, and hopefully working on lines and wrinkles, throughout the day or night.  </li>
      <li>I have pretty soft skin, but do breakout and have ingrown hair issues.  </li>
      <li>Thought I&#x27;d give these products a try, this one in particular as the moisturisers are not recommended for the eye area.  </li>
      <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
      <li>I thought this one would be fine because I used the first one I ordered sooooo, I ordered a second one and then all of a sudden, red under eye itchy rash.  </li>
      <li>Wow!  </li>
      <li>Dayum I&#x27;m still old...</li>
      <li>The body lotion makes my skin soft.  </li>
      <li>The eye cream is gentle enough for me to use eventhough</li>
      <li>I had to return it because (1) it&#x27;s not recommended for people who wash their faces with soap (which I do) and (2) Not recommended for people frequently exposed to sun (I live in southern California!).  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using this cream for several months now and can really see a difference in my upper lip area.</li>
      <li>Be careful, however, this isn&#x27;t a product to use, if you are out in the sun much.</li>
      <li>The ridge between my lips and the facial skin on my upper lip is so soft.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Great product. Have used off and on for years.Great pricing online with this vendot. Speedy mailing. Less than a week all the time. Have used them before and will use them again</li>
    <li> I started using this product at the end of September of 2009.  Made a little difference in the eye area, but didn&#x27;t do a thing for the upper lip area.  I use it day and night.  So I don&#x27;t recommend this product.  I will try something else when I run out.</li>
    <li> It is a reasonably price cream that works.  Can&#x27;t ask for more than that.  Don&#x27;t waste money on expensive stuff, this works just as good.</li>
    <li> I had to return it because (1) it&#x27;s not recommended for people who wash their faces with soap (which I do) and (2) Not recommended for people frequently exposed to sun (I live in southern California!).  This info should be provided in online product description since there&#x27;s a 15% restocking fee on returns.  Refund, however, was prompt.</li>
    <li> Wow!  I have other Alpha Hydrox products, which I love, but this one is especially great.  I have pretty soft skin, but do breakout and have ingrown hair issues.  This has really smoothes out my eyelids and actually makes eyebrow maintinence better.  But the amazing thing has been my lip line.  The ridge between my lips and the facial skin on my upper lip is so soft.  I actually have demonstrated for people that I would not ordinarilly let touch my lips.  And my lips are softer.  I am using less lip balm.  I know, the product says upper lip not lips.  But once I smear it is on my upper lip it goes everywhere.  Plus it worked so well I was just amazed.  It is also very inexpensive.  I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Bought this along with a few other products in the line. I live in a hot, humid country and have oily skin with a tendency to whiteheads and as time passes the fine lines are becoming more defined. Thought I&#x27;d give these products a try, this one in particular as the moisturisers are not recommended for the eye area.

Also I have to say the products have a strong chemical smell and taste if you happen to accidentally get some on your lips.  Not available locally and for me not worth the cost of delivery so will not purchase again.</li>
    <li> I have only used this for about 2 weeks now. Tried using it in the morning and at night but it seems to make my under eye area feel dry. Went with only using it at night with another eye cream on top of it. So.. i&#x27;ll have to let you know after i use it for a while longer.</li>
    <li> This is especially good for dry eyes! If you have RA or Sjogrens type dry eyes, this helps me immensely.</li>
    <li> Feels good on the skin. I&#x27;ve only used it for a few weeks so its too early to tell long term.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this cream for several months now and can really see a difference in my upper lip area. Before the skin was puckered and beginning to get lines, I&#x27;m 53 but have been noticing problems for at least 3 years, but now it&#x27;s nice and smooth. I used to have to keep my foundation and powder away from the upper lip area because it just sat on the surface and never looked good, but since I&#x27;ve been using this cream that skin is as healthy as the rest of my face. I also use the Alpha Hydrox Nourishing Cleanser, AHA Souffle and Night Replenishing Cream and I&#x27;m very happy with the line but if I was to pick a favorite this would be it.</li>
    <li> I have started using Alpha Hydroxy, and I am looking much younger.  This one is more concentrated for those upper lip lines and under eye wrinkles.  Be careful, however, this isn&#x27;t a product to use, if you are out in the sun much.</li>
    <li> Excellent product, great price.</li>
    <li> Dayum I&#x27;m still old...but now I&#x27;m old and poor. I might as well just go to Lowes for some Spackle.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t notice any results with this product. I would not purchase this product again I was not satisified. I read the reviews before I purchased the product.</li>
    <li> I am not terribly impressed with Alpha Hydrox Eye and Upper Lip Cream. It is gentle for use in the eye and lip area, but I am a little disappointed by the lightweight of the cream. I have used other eye area products that have a more substantial consistency, and thus remain in place, protecting and moisturising, and hopefully working on lines and wrinkles, throughout the day or night.  This product is very lightweight, and within hours seems just to be gone.  When I need to replenish I will probably seek out a different product.</li>
    <li> while it will not get rid of your wrinkles, it does diminish them.  A little of it goes a long way.  It is also very reasonably priced.</li>
    <li> Great cream, Can&#x27;t beat it!</li>
    <li> I love all of the Alpha Hydrox products. My skin looks better than it has in years.</li>
    <li> I just recently got this product so I&#x27;m sure it will be awhile before I see any kind of results.  The cream itself is light and non greasy and makes under my eyes look soft and smooth</li>
    <li> GOOD TIME SHIPPING BUT THE CREAM DOES NOT DO WHAT IT SAYS</li>
    <li> I used the Alpha Hydrox products years ago when the big box discount stores carried them.  Was happy to find Alpha Hydrox on Amazon.  The eye cream is gentle enough for me to use eventhough I have rosacea.  Everyso often I use it on my face as a nightime treatment without any irritation. This is not a replacement for prescription Retin A.  Also, I use the Alpha Hydrox body lotion and shower gel.  The body lotion makes my skin soft.  I love the shower gel.</li>
    <li> I really like this under eye cream but sadly, I&#x27;m allergic to every under eye cream I&#x27;ve tried.  I thought this one would be fine because I used the first one I ordered sooooo, I ordered a second one and then all of a sudden, red under eye itchy rash.  So I&#x27;ll jus have to use regular lotion under my eyes.  But I really liked the results, until that allergic reaction and I know it&#x27;s not the cream because as I said, I&#x27;m allergic to EVERY under eye cream I&#x27;ve used.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for several weeks and can&#x27;t tell any difference in my skin. I probably will not purchase this again.</li>
    <li> Like the Alpha Hydrox  products. Bought this to try it out. will see, too soon to say. Hopefully it will be good I will see.</li>
    <li> Nice for price and does not ball up under make up application. Would probably order again.</li>
    <li> didn&#x27;t notice any real difference in my skin or improvement</li>
