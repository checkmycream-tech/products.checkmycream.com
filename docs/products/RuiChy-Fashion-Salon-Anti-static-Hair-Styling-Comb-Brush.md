      <li>I Love this comb set.  </li>
      <li>What a great price for how much you get.</li>
      <li>but I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll find a use for some of the others as well.  </li>
      <li>Overall very happy with my purchase.  </li>
      <li>:)</li>
      <li>I bought this kit full of combs and found that there are more combs than I know what to do with.  </li>
      <li>They&#x27;re cheap plastic.  </li>
      <li>Dont forget to break these puppies in or theyll break some scalp!(rub teeth on a surface to smooth).</li>
      <li>The combs work great ,very thin and on flimsy side,but they work great</li>
      <li>Finally, a full set of styling implements to deal with my hair no matter the condition, or situation.</li>
      <li>Its probably wasn&#x27;t the same quality , I don&#x27;t know for sure.   </li>
      <li>It certainly would not withstand commercial use, as I only used it lightly one time on my own hair and the metal teeth just fell off.</li>
      <li>They arrived quickly and after a \\&quot;first use\\&quot; cleaning, they made my daily hair styling so much easier!</li>
      <li>These combs are very flimsy.</li>

      <li>No my hair is not thick, and I was very surprised.</li>
      <li>Instead of having to pick and choose down the long aisle of a drug or beauty store, I now have a full set.</li>
      <li>The other combs are decent though.</li>

    <li> They&#x27;re cheap plastic.  They&#x27;ve got rough seams.  The ten pieces include some duplicates, so not really ten different combs.  But they do work.</li>
    <li> Dont forget to break these puppies in or theyll break some scalp!(rub teeth on a surface to smooth). Some came slightly bent, oh well crymore</li>
    <li> Finally, a full set of styling implements to deal with my hair no matter the condition, or situation. Instead of having to pick and choose down the long aisle of a drug or beauty store, I now have a full set. Packaged neatly and at my fingertips. They arrived quickly and after a \\&quot;first use\\&quot; cleaning, they made my daily hair styling so much easier! What a relief.</li>
    <li> Great for the price..</li>
    <li> like I&#x27;m pleased and recommend I recommend it to other customers are very versatile and the quality I expected&lt;br /&gt;thanks</li>
    <li> slow shipping but I like them</li>
    <li> These combs are very flimsy. I am a black woman with natural hair and I can&#x27;t even comb my hair with any of these combs without them bending which defeats the purpose of the comb.</li>
    <li> I bought this kit full of combs and found that there are more combs than I know what to do with.  I use about three regularly but I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll find a use for some of the others as well.  Overall very happy with my purchase.  :)</li>
    <li> The combs work great ,very thin and on flimsy side,but they work great,It comes with a package thays great to store it in overall very happy</li>
    <li> i like this set, it has every comb u can imagine. the price is great because i wanted to buy one of these combs from sally and it was 7 dollars.</li>
    <li> I bought this same set from the 99cent store.  Its probably wasn&#x27;t the same quality , I don&#x27;t know for sure.   I honestly don&#x27;t think $10 is good if I payed $1 for ok quality</li>
    <li> These are horrible combs.  The biggest one broke the 2nd time I used it, while combing my hair.  Yes, I have thick hair, but I&#x27;ve never broken a comb before!  I gave one to my oldest daughter and she dropped it on the tile floor the next day - yup, it broke too.  Crazy!</li>
    <li> I Love this comb set.  There is one for every member of our family.  What a great price for how much you get.</li>
    <li> Foe the price, this comb set is good. The comb set  is a gift for my daughter, she&#x27;s a hair dresser so she will tell me more about it, so Iwill post again to let you know about the quality of it!</li>
    <li> Wanted black combs not yellowish.</li>
    <li> This was not as good as I hoped it would be, the teasing comb with the metal pick on it fell apart the 1st time I used it.

    <li> TSA stole the set. said they where considered weapons but while I had them they combed hair.</li>
    <li> VERY GOOD QUALITY OF COMBS. PEACE. I NEEDED EVERY TYPE OF COMB IN THIS SET BECAUSE THEY ALL SERVE DIFFERENT PURPOSES. I WOULD ORDER AGAIN. PEACE.</li>
