      <li>I used it as a winter face moisturizer and loved it but for summer is a little to moisturizing in my opinion in humid weather.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I have no words to express how I feel. I have not seen my skin look so bright in ages. I simple product so light and amazing. A MUST!</li>
    <li> its a create moisturizer for the skin, however theres a smell that i dont really like...but it doesn&#x27;t really bother me,all i did was mix it with a lotion and it&#x27;d smells good with the same effect :D however i would not recommend this moisturizer for people who has OILY skin, because it is REALLY moisturizing. I have combination skin, only oily on my T-zone and rest are normal skin. However I would recommend it for Dry skin, and normal skin as optional. The formula is like a regular lotion with a bit liquid substance (just a bit). Overall it is a good moisturizer for me because i live in the northern hemisphere, it tends to get really cold, and it would dry out my skin if I dont use any moisturizer.</li>
    <li> The best lotion ever! It makes me skin so smooth and hydrates it. It&#x27;s very light and it doesn&#x27;t make your skin super oily. The scent is not that pleasing but it&#x27;s okay kinda smells citrusy.</li>
    <li> I have extremely sensitive skin and I am very afraid to try any new products, but this works great on my skin.  It is extremely light so perfect to wear under makeup.  I also LOVE the way it smells.</li>
    <li> My holy grail moisturizer. This product is what convinced me that Korean skincare truly is the best. Honestly, I hadn&#x27;t had a moisturizer that worked so perfectly for me until this one. I hope it never ever gets discontinued, because I want to continue using this for years to come.</li>
    <li> i love the face shop product cauz they r very natural nd moisturizing~ nd it is a great moisturizer to keep~</li>
    <li> I have obnoxious skin when it comes to moisturizing because I have both dry and oily spots. This amazing lotion is strong enough for the really dry parts and mild enough for the oily parts. I don&#x27;t know how they do it! What i do know is my search for the perfect facial lotion is finally over! Yay!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m repeat customer.  I just love this product.  I have very sensitive skin that prevents me from trying most of stuffs but this line works great for my skin. It also seems gentle enough that I let my daughter use a bit when she wants to be pretty.  :). I got this one for my sister, too</li>
    <li> I already received my package yesterday and I must say it was shipped faster than I had accounted for. The lotion had a cute container but I must say I wasn&#x27;t a fan of the lotion&#x27;s smell. It has a pretty weird smell and it reminds me of old people??? Idk how to explain it. Also, the lotion is light to the feel so that was nice and it does moisturize like it says but I wish it was more creamy to the face. Overall it was a good product.</li>
    <li> This moisturizer is so much better then any other ones. One ful squirt and it covers my entire face. My skin is soft</li>
    <li> I would not recommend this product for oily skin.</li>
    <li> My skin is still dry with it.  I was hoping it would moisturize better.  I had high hopes for this one.</li>
    <li> I love it. I been looking for a moisturizer that works since my skin get really dry. Even in the summer time.. Its not thick and it keeps my skin hydrated.</li>
    <li> It feels like there&#x27;s nothing on my skin plus it smells amazing and all u need is like a little small amount to get all over ur face smell is ok if ur a person who doesn&#x27;t like fragrances get this if it like me and love ur face to smell get it anyway only cus it makes ur face feel awesome :D</li>
    <li> This would be great for a younger girl, very light and does moisturize. My faces tends towards being dry, especially during the winter months, so this didn&#x27;t really suit for what I needed.</li>
    <li> I love it. The only daily moisturizer product I&#x27;ve used so far.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not as expensive as I expect and it&#x27;s better than I thought</li>
    <li> Feels very lightweight when you apply it and sinks in pretty quickly. It hasn&#x27;t interfered with my makeup and all, and has not broken me out. Should be suitable for combination to dry skin and also sensitive skin. The smell is very light and goes away quickly. I definitely recommend this is you are looking for a light, everyday moisturizer to put on under your makeup or as part of your evening skincare routine.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t use anything but this during the day and it is so smooth and makes my skin soft. I love it and order it repeatedly.</li>
    <li> I have been a faithful Okay face moisturizer w/ SPF 15 since my teens but I&#x27;ve been trying to change my routine and come across this moisturizer. I have combinational skin and this moisturizer works great. I live how its non greasy but moisturizing at the same time. It can go under make up but I would suggest using primer first as it could cause to sweat during summer. I used it as a winter face moisturizer and loved it but for summer is a little to moisturizing in my opinion in humid weather. Overall great product that I will use in my winter stash.</li>
    <li> Quick delivery and I like the bottle and design. It&#x27;s a nice milky texture, but I don&#x27;t use it every day.</li>
    <li> I like this. It&#x27;s light and doesn&#x27;t feel greasy. Some may not like the smell(a bit earthy), but it kind of grew on me. Great for summer, but I don&#x27;t think I would use this in the winter months.</li>
    <li> I am hapy witth this product....it absorb well to your skin...leave your skin with a nice touch...will keep using it :-)</li>
    <li> This moisturizer is the best I&#x27;ve ever used, and I have been on the hunt for the perfect face moisturizer my whole life. Its incredibly moisturizing, lightweight and non-greasy. My skin rejoices the second I put it on. I am acne prone, and I noticed using this I don&#x27;t break out as much- I think its the moisturizers capability to deliver that replenishing stuff you need without clogging up your pores. And my skin drinks it up- after applying you&#x27;re not left with any film or greasy-ness, just skin that feels refreshed and rejuvenated. Really recommend this product!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PS- delivery was a whole month faster than what was quoted. Thank you!!</li>
    <li> This cream goes on smooth a little tingly but I seem to always go back to it.  Shipping was pretty quick.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t tell you enough how much I really like this product. It smells wonderful, has no bad additives, and moisturizes very nicely without leaving skin oily. I will definitely purchase this product again. I purchased this from ACLASS, they hava a great reputation, shipped my item to me unbelievably fast, and sent a nice note and free sample. Will definitely purchase from ACLASS again :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-very happy customer ^_^</li>
    <li> The product was not as good as I thought.</li>
    <li> Very much like this moisturizer, my skin feels silky even in the morning after overnight sleep..</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t live without it every morning, it smells great and not making my face feel greasy.</li>
    <li> I use this with [The Face Shop] Rice Water Bright Cleansing Foam and the Tonic with essential and all three together works wonders. My skin feels smooth and soft as a baby&#x27;s bottom. I would kiss my face if I could. I cannot stop touching my face. It has a light sent and it does not leave residue behind it absorbs well and even if you have oily skin the tonic would be good for you but if you need extra use both or all three together. I have combination skin, I&#x27;m not prone to acne or anything like that but I live in a dry state and really need the moisture. I hope this helps some what. I never write reviews but I had to for all three of these products. these are the first products that I&#x27;ve ever written a review for and its worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good Luck&lt;br /&gt;XOXO&lt;br /&gt;&#x3D;)</li>
