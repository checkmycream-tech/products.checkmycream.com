      <li>This is my favorite toothpaste, and I really prefer this form factor (neater, cleaner and easier to store).  </li>
      <li>The only downside is that this is a lot of toothpaste, probably better for families (or people who really love brushing their teeth</li>
      <li>After trying many different mint toothpastes, I have come to love this one.</li>
      <li>Mild flavored mint.  </li>
      <li>Great product for that middle phase where they don&#x27;t want bubblegum toothpaste, but adult flavors are still too hot!</li>
      <li>It does help you keep your teeth white, and you will find yourself brushing your teeth more because you enjoy the taste.  </li>
      <li>Handy little guys, and keeps bathroom clean.</li>
      <li>This isn&#x27;t a replacement for your recall exams with your favorite dentist in no way, but rather up-keep until your next check</li>
      <li>I bought this on Amazon Subscribe and Save, and after purchasing at least two different kinds before that I did not end up liking too much, I was very glad that this toothpaste has a good flavor and works well.</li>
      <li>I have been able to find this at my local stores as well.</li>
      <li>Love this toothpaste, only brand I use.</li>
      <li>The bottle is also fantastic - so much easier to use and keep clean than the traditional squeeze tubes.</li>

      <li>I keep mine upside down because it is very easy to use that way.  </li>

      <li>Fast shipping and Prompt service</li>
      <li>I have been buying these types of toothpastes for a long time now because I don&#x27;t like the mess of the flip top or the hassle of the screw top; yes I am that</li>
      <li>We were very surprised when we first tried the \\&quot;Herbal</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve seen a gradual increase in the whitening of my teeth, but I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s mostly due to the fact that I&#x27;ve also used whitening strips.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t often get excited for purchasing toothpaste on amazon, but this is different.</li>
      <li>Love the fact that you can sit it upside down on the cap side.</li>

      <li>Crest Whitening Expressions Line are great in the flavor department and getting that fresh, cold mouth feeling every morning and night.  </li>
      <li>I highly recommend trying this toothpaste.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s soft and the minty flavor is not overly menthol, no bad pasty residue left over</li>
      <li>recommend keeping the bottle upside down so that it will flow easily onto the toothbrush.  </li>
      <li>My husband loves this minty flavor and I love not having a messy tube of toothpaste on his bathroom vanity!</li>
      <li>When you turn the container upside down all the gel flows to bottom of the container and is readily available to use.</li>
      <li>I became accustomed to using these dispensers a few years ago when that seemed to be all that was available.  </li>
      <li>As far as the whitening, I would have to disagree because I do not see any difference.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I think that this is the best Tasting toothpaste on the market. I had a difficult time locating it in my  local supermarkets\Drugstores. It then occurred to me why not try to buy it on Amazon? Saved me a lot of time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Economical-I have two sons and I have found that they use less of this product than a typical toothpaste. There is definitely less toothpaste leftover in the sink when they&#x27;re done brushing. We also use all of the product in the container, this is not the case when we used toothpaste from tubes. When you turn the container upside down all the gel flows to bottom of the container and is readily available to use. The flip top ensures that my kids never lose the top like they used to do with toothpaste tube caps. What more can you ask for?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> comes in a big pack and they are very good to have around since sometimes I have friends or family come and they might forget theirs, but they dont&#x27; have to go get more at the store and I never really ever run out.</li>
    <li> awesome! I will buy these toothpastes again.</li>
    <li> Delivered before estimated. Good value! Great produce....</li>
    <li> Best type of dispenser for a great toothpaste. Small standing container.  Mild flavored mint.  Perfect for traveling.  Hard to find in local drugstores.</li>
    <li> I bought this based on reading reviews. It has very pleasant taste and leaves your mouth feeling very clean. The bottle is also fantastic - so much easier to use and keep clean than the traditional squeeze tubes.</li>
    <li> I have sensitive teeth, and this toothpaste is great. I couldn&#x27;t find it in our store and was afraid it was discontinued. But, TADA, I found it on Amazon!</li>
    <li> love these, carry one in my bag all the time!</li>
    <li> Tastes great, and works good. This might be my favorite toothpaste.  Great packaging.  You won&#x27;t waste any toothpaste.  I highly recommend trying this toothpaste.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t seen this in retail stores in years. When I stumbled upon it on Amazon, I immediately ordered 2 4-packs and am glad I did. I like everything about it but the price. I understand supply and demand, but this price is excessive.  I&#x27;ll still buy it, though.</li>
    <li> My husband loves this minty flavor and I love not having a messy tube of toothpaste on his bathroom vanity!</li>
    <li> I have been buying these types of toothpastes for a long time now because I don&#x27;t like the mess of the flip top or the hassle of the screw top; yes I am that lazy!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Crest Whitening Expressions Line are great in the flavor department and getting that fresh, cold mouth feeling every morning and night.  As far as the whitening, I would have to disagree because I do not see any difference.  My teeth are clean and have been cavity free to this point.  There is no plaque build up or discoloration.  This isn&#x27;t a replacement for your recall exams with your favorite dentist in no way, but rather up-keep until your next check up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the Herbal mint... it is just that.  We love minty strong toothpastes in our home.  We were very surprised when we first tried the \\&quot;Herbal Mint\\&quot; and it wasn&#x27;t as minty strong but more tea like, hence the herbal part LOL.  I wasn&#x27;t going to purchase again, but found us drawn back to where we don&#x27;t recognize the difference anymore.  If it sounds like your cup of tea then you will enjoy this change of pace.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We recommend keeping the bottle upside down so that it will flow easily onto the toothbrush.  Another keeper is the little \\&quot;running low\\&quot; sticker on the side that reminds you that it is time to get another bottle soon.  A bottle lasts about a month in a half in our household; maybe a bit longer.</li>
    <li> Great buy and perfect for travel size</li>
    <li> After trying many different mint toothpastes, I have come to love this one. It tastes much more intensely like natural mint than other toothpastes I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
    <li> Love that I can still find online since they don&#x27;t have the gel in stores anymore for the herbal mint. Would order from the company again and again. Fast shipping and Prompt service</li>
    <li> Love the fact that you can sit it upside down on the cap side.</li>
    <li> Nice flavor. Easy to dispense. Does not foam well.</li>
    <li> not much to write for toothpaste. the flavor is extremely mild, so you don&#x27;t really get a huge refreshing taste in your mouth after, but it tastes good and is a good price. Would buy again</li>
    <li> I bought this toothpaste for when I travel around and do not want to have a restriction on size. The taste is great and now I have replaced this as my pain tooth paste</li>
    <li> I have been using this toothpaste for several years now.  It has a strong flavor and smell that stays with you for a while.  It helps keep you having fresh breath and a nice taste after brushing.  It does help you keep your teeth white, and you will find yourself brushing your teeth more because you enjoy the taste.  I have noticed that my gums don&#x27;t bleed with this toothpaste, maybe it is safer?  I keep mine upside down because it is very easy to use that way.  I have been able to find this at my local stores as well.</li>
    <li> The toothpaste is strong-scented and very effective; it comes in a well-protected plastic bottle, which, incidentally, makes it convenient to carry while traveling as well.</li>
    <li> Very minty and refreshing! Good deal for how many you get. No complaints from me or the teeth! If you&#x27;re a fan of mint and a fan of a nice, refreshing mouth, definitely scoop this deal up!!</li>
    <li> Good toothpaste, or rather, it is the toothpaste I usually use.  What can you say about toothpaste?</li>
    <li> I bought this on Amazon Subscribe and Save, and after purchasing at least two different kinds before that I did not end up liking too much, I was very glad that this toothpaste has a good flavor and works well.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s toothpaste! Hard to find in stores so ordered online.</li>
    <li> My whole family uses this toothpaste-- my seven year olds favorite.</li>
    <li> Love this toothpaste, only brand I use. Great deal!</li>
    <li> I became accustomed to using these dispensers a few years ago when that seemed to be all that was available.  I still like them because they are clean and neat.  There&#x27;s no &amp;#34;sag in the middle of the tube&amp;#34; to deal with.  I just don&#x27;t seem to be good at squeezing from the bottom.  I like the herbal mint flavor too.</li>
    <li> The paste isn&#x27;t bad, but the high ratings here do not tell the full story. I would imagine that people were just used to this and were happy to find it online. It doesn&#x27;t do anything for me as the mint flavor is too weak.</li>
    <li> A quality toothpaste at a reasonable price.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t often get excited for purchasing toothpaste on amazon, but this is different. I&#x27;ve used this toothpaste for quite a while and was sad to see that none of my local supermarkets carried this type of toothpaste any more. Why do I like it so much? Let us count the ways..    1. The design of the toothpaste is great. The tubular squeeze design eliminates the messy caps with traditional toothpaste, not to mention the annoyingness of squeezing out the toothpaste evenly.     2. The herbal mint leaves the mouth very refreshed. You are left with a very clean feeling after brushing.    3. I&#x27;ve seen a gradual increase in the whitening of my teeth, but I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s mostly due to the fact that I&#x27;ve also used whitening strips. Even as a heavy coffee drinker, using both products have given me whiter teeth than I started out with.    4. Great low price on Amazon with a 4 pack! What&#x27;s not to like?!</li>
    <li> MUY BUENO,PARA USO DE VIAJE LO RECOMIENDO,ES DE UN SABOR SUAVE Y ES RECOMENDABLE CUANDO LAS PERSONAS ANDAN DE VIAJE ,SOBRE TODO EN CARRETERAS O RESTAURANTES.</li>
    <li> Came in bulk, we won&#x27;t need toothpaste for awhile.</li>
    <li> My kid loves this.  Great product for that middle phase where they don&#x27;t want bubblegum toothpaste, but adult flavors are still too hot!</li>
    <li> Please don&#x27;t ever discontinue this item!!!! :)</li>
    <li> Great taste and flavor. Makes your mouth feel very clean.</li>
    <li> Handy little guys, and keeps bathroom clean.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s soft and the minty flavor is not overly menthol, no bad pasty residue left over funkiness.&lt;br /&gt;this is what i prefer over every other toothpaste. as long as i can this will be the only one i will use/buy/etc.</li>
    <li> PERFECT!  GOOD PRODUCT. THANK YOU!</li>
    <li> My Favorite Toothpaste!</li>
    <li> Love this stuff.  Could no longer find in stores.  So glad available thru amazon.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite toothpaste, and I really prefer this form factor (neater, cleaner and easier to store).  And the quantity for the price is quite good.  The only downside is that this is a lot of toothpaste, probably better for families (or people who really love brushing their teeth I guess).</li>
    <li> Great flavor and gel viscosity/texture. Great color. Very convenient dispensor/container. Minimal storage area on shelf.&lt;br /&gt;However, the lid and tip tend to &amp;#34;gum up&amp;#34; from excess semi-dried gel. Otherwise, a great &amp;#34;toothpaste&amp;#34;!!!</li>
    <li> Nice Crisp. !&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Easy carry for travel</li>
    <li> My wife uses this and keeps buying it so I guess it must be good!</li>
    <li> Good toothpaste  but must be kept down in upright position during cold weather. Good taste cleans very well.</li>
