      <li>It minimizes pores and deep cleans without stripping skin of natural moisture.</li>
      <li>this works well to take off makeup and dirt and not dry out my skin.</li>

    <li> Only a 3 because just got it yesterday!! Heard good things is why I purchased. Hope I like it. Just used first time. Only use a tad, will make face burn if use a lot. Just from first use, said to use a small amount on package..</li>
    <li> very good product....I highly recommend it</li>
    <li> It washes away all the dirt and oil from the face. Leaves my face fresh and clean. I have been using it for few years now and would recommend it to a friend for sure.</li>
    <li> This is a great product just like so many of their other products. This is moisturizing and easily gets eye makeup off which is a double bonus. Definitely one of my favorite cleansers.

    <li> I have clear skin but wanted to change my cleanse to something natural! My skin had been %100 clear of ALL impurities for over 3 months when I decided to give this a try. When i began using this I began to get huge red pimples under my skin! Something i used to get like once a year if any! Now I was getting about 2 or more a week! This also made my skin scar prone. Even the tiniest bump would leave a red mark after it went away! Without ever popping a single pimple! I used this for 2 months hoping my skin was just getting used to the new wash but NO! After my skin was horrible i finnaly went back to my old cleanser and the bumps all began to go away and my skin is now clear again! I don&#x27;t know what the problem was but I know it gave me red, itchy, huge bumps I had never had! I do not recommend this!!</li>
    <li> I was introduced to this when I had a facial - of course paid much more for it then.  Love the way this cleans my face although I was skeptical at first since I have combination and sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> I love this cleanser. It deep cleanses without being harsh. It minimizes pores and deep cleans without stripping skin of natural moisture. Being older, this is very important to me.

    <li> Best products on the market!</li>
    <li> This is the best formula, I have ever used as a cleanser. Makes for glow and look younger too! Will buy, again! AAA++ Fast-Shipping too!! (edit)&lt;br /&gt;0 comments</li>
    <li> I have only been using this wash for a few days now, but I absolutely love it. It not only smells amazing, but it cleans my skin gently and effectively unlike any other product. I have oily skin that loves to get irritated and broken out and this is seeming to help keep it clear and beautiful. The second day of use a woman stopped me to tell me how lovely my skin is. I would have to recommend this to ANYONE with skin even similar to mine.</li>
    <li> Love it!  This is a great cleanser,  and I use it twice a day. It was recommended by my estitician.</li>
