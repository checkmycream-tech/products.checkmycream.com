      <li>VERY SATISFIED WITH THIS PURCHASE.</li>
      <li>I was very excited to find a replacement on Amazon!</li>
      <li>I took the lid with the tray and attachments under the assumption that everything would be effectively stored in one location via the lid somehow nesting or attaching with the tray.  </li>
      <li>I bought based on brand name AND the appearance that the case/holder effectively keeps the attachments organized.  </li>
      <li>Perfect in package, not used and looks like it came directly from store</li>
      <li>- The foil attachment doesn&#x27;t do a good job at all for \\&quot;cleaning up detailed areas\\&quot;  - no comb, brush or lubrification in the box.  </li>
      <li>I went to attach the charger (fitting it into the slot in the tray for this purpose) and looked for a nice location to place the stand.  </li>

      <li>THANK YOU FOR THIS SALE, you purchase GLADLY ..</li>
      <li>I would like the battery works for more time.</li>
      <li>My beard is much more sculpted and controlled than it ever was before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>This Remington replaces my Remington PG200 that finally wore out after 5+ years of very good service.</li>
      <li>Cheaply made, but for the most part they get the job</li>
      <li>Heads are easy to change.&lt;br</li>
      <li>My boyfriend loves it &amp; it helps that it&#x27;s packaged for travel easily.</li>
      <li>Easy to use and its rechargable.</li>
      <li>/&gt;The trimmer did fine on my side burns for a month or so.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t have use for all the attachments on this device, but would still recommend it as a cheap device for beard maintenance in a pinch.</li>
      <li>Its light and handles well in hand.    </li>
      <li>I primarily use it to trim my beard and the hair around my ears.</li>
      <li>There are a lot of cheap parts that can break.  </li>
      <li>This product is a cheap piece of junk, but it works.  </li>
      <li>This product works fine till it is time to clean the trimming head.</li>
      <li>Originally I bought this to trim my neck and burns and for the nose hair trimmer.  </li>
      <li>+ the motor runs fine at adequate speed when plugged in or on battery.  </li>
      <li>But for finishing touches, you&#x27;re better off with a straight rasor like a Mach 3 Turbo if you want a clean shave.</li>
      <li>* Fits nicely in hand, soft rubber</li>
      <li>Recommended for anyone who wants to trim their beard and nose-hair who can&#x27;t afford anything better.  </li>
      <li>My last Philips unit had broke, thought the Remington would be a good replacement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>This case is only good for storing the device on your bathroom shelf.  </li>
      <li>They sent what Remington is currently selling, which is not as good as the Pg360.</li>
      <li>Verdict: Decent for beard maintenance or removing most of it if you want to.</li>
      <li>and they are adequate,</li>
      <li>great little trimmer for the price.</li>
      <li>Would be nice to have a beard comb for the bigger trimmer too.  </li>
      <li>Instead of trimming nice and even, it left holes in my beard in places.  </li>
      <li>Not having shaved the big 3day weekend as a test, the whole job of shaving and trimming took more than 15mins, of which only 2 or 3mins was spend using the comb attachment over the beard and did a good job of it.     </li>
      <li>Instead, you will need to find a place to toss the lid and remember its location if/when you want to travel (assuming you elect to utilize the tray/stand vs. tossing it all in a small box).</li>
      <li>I love this trimmer well the only thing i use is the foil shaver it works like magic its better than other brands ive used..</li>
      <li>if you want a clean shave, use a normal razor.    </li>
      <li>but it looks like the engineers put more thought in the design of this larger comb attachment than they did for the beard comb attachment.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this razor!!</li>
      <li>and as i travel the power converters does not work for 240volt only 120volt, most products these days are dual voltage.</li>
      <li>I have used this Remington beard trimmer package for 3 or 4 months, and overall I am satisfied with it.  </li>
      <li>When that didn&#x27;t work I started rinsing it out (which really shouldn&#x27;t be done because it&#x27;s already lubricated) and tapping it many times against the sink to knock out the hair, and that helped for another couple weeks but eventually the motor simply couldn&#x27;t move the head</li>
      <li>Nice black and silver color.&lt;br /</li>
      <li>it works better with dry skin.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not interested in a super close shave, so trimming is fine.  </li>
      <li>The kit has enough tools, works fine.</li>
      <li>Stores in its own little box.</li>
      <li>You can shave with it, but you don&#x27;t get a very close shave</li>
      <li>I wasn&#x27;t overjoyed, but I hadn&#x27;t paid much, so</li>
      <li>BEST IMPOSSIBLE.</li>
      <li>Realistically I expect this product to last about a year - two if you&#x27;re lucky.  </li>
      <li>+ decent job for thinning/tapering with the plastic comb attachment  </li>
      <li>Will most likely refuse to hold a charge after several months of use as well.</li>
      <li>If you are on a tight budget and want to trim your beard with something better than scissors, this is the product for you.  </li>
      <li>Highly recommended.</li>
      <li>This thing tries to do so many things with all its various attachments, but like the old saying goes: Do one thing and do it right.    </li>
      <li>: it comes with a nice hard case to keep everything together.  </li>
      <li>The blades is much shaper than his old Remington.  </li>
      <li>But the most time wasted is messing around with the foil attachment for the \\&quot;finishing touches\\&quot;.</li>
      <li>So, it seems I must buy a new charger or new shaver.</li>
      <li>Actually works pretty well.  </li>
      <li>I cannot rate the performance of the product because it went back in the box after the first inspection.  </li>
      <li>trimming probably isn&#x27;t the typical use for this product, but I still thought it should last more than a couple months at doing it.</li>
      <li>The trimmer shaved some areas clean, left tufts in others, and generally was inadequate to the task of trimming hair, which is its only purpose.</li>
      <li>Let&#x27;s be clear about what it is.  </li>
      <li>* Delicate plastic parts, more of something like an elf would use instead of a man.&lt;br /</li>
      <li>** product complete with a battery that lasts about one minute.</li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t work when plugged directly in power</li>
      <li>Nothing has broken yet, but it does not hold its charge very well.ts to trim their beard and nose-hair who can&#x27;t afford anything better.  </li>
      <li>There are no pictures to show the right way to use this trimmer in the manual, the only pic shows only the features of the device.    </li>
      <li>The foil does ok for the cheeks if you puff them but not good for the neck.</li>
      <li>so I only use it for my neck and that is slow, it really helps to clean it a couple of times during each</li>
      <li>My beard trimmer hasn&#x27;t broken yet, and so far I am satisfied.  </li>
      <li>My beard trimmer hasn&#x27;t broken yet, and so far I am satisfied.  </li>
      <li>The PG360 offers the same grooming services, but seems to be even of even quality than the PG200.</li>
      <li>- low motor speed yet still a bit loud    </li>
      <li>Panasonic ER224S All-in-One Cordless Hair and Beard Trimmer (Silver)]] for this little \\&quot;lump\\&quot; in the design to keep the trimmer at the right angle on your face.</li>
      <li>The smaller clear comb attachment only goes over the smaller trimmer head.</li>
      <li>At first the largest head worked well but within a few weeks it started getting clogged</li>
      <li>have not used the other trimming attachments - just the main trimmer and foil.&lt;br</li>
      <li>* Typical modern manufacture piece of plastic crap.&lt;br</li>

    <li> I have had the Pg360 for several years, and it has been great! As time has gone on however, the batteries will not hold a charge any longer. I was very excited to find a replacement on Amazon! However, the company took 3 weeks to actually get it to me. When it arrived I was so busy with life that I didn&#x27;t discover until a week later that the company had sent me the wrong item. They sent what Remington is currently selling, which is not as good as the Pg360. However, time had passed, and packaging gone, that I could no longer return the item. My Pg360 head fits onto the body of the new shaver, not great, but it works. I am disappointed that Remington isn&#x27;t making the Pg360 any longer, and that the company that I received my item from Amazon not only took a very long time, but also sent me the wrong item. But, also on me for not checking prior to getting rid of the packaging. Oh well.. guess I will go with this until it dies too.</li>
    <li> I cannot rate this product low enough.  Pros: it comes with a nice hard case to keep everything together.  Cons: everything else.    Last week I purchased this product and attempted to trim my beard with it.  I set it to a 3 and attempted to trim my beard.  Instead of trimming nice and even, it left holes in my beard in places.  Today, I attempted using it again only this time it came out much worse.  It is now on its way to the municipal dump.    Remington, you&#x27;ve lost my confidence in your products.</li>
    <li> I love this trimmer well the only thing i use is the foil shaver it works like magic its better than other brands ive used..</li>
    <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;* Fits nicely in hand, soft rubber grip.&lt;br /&gt;* Nice black and silver color.&lt;br /&gt;* Heads are easy to change.&lt;br /&gt;* Eyebrow trimmer works well.&lt;br /&gt;* Nose trimmer works well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;* Adjustment settings are hard to see, and difficult to move accurately.&lt;br /&gt;* Typical modern manufacture piece of plastic crap.&lt;br /&gt;* Delicate plastic parts, more of something like an elf would use instead of a man.&lt;br /&gt;* Shaver is tiny, really too small to shave your entire face with (I have a beard so I only use it for my neck and that is slow, it really helps to clean it a couple of times during each use)&lt;br /&gt;* Does not work on cord, battery must be charged.&lt;br /&gt;* Could be sharper.&lt;br /&gt;* Travel case is worthless, lid is difficult to put on and requires tape or rubber band to hold it closed, and there is zero room for the charger.&lt;br /&gt;* I ordered one but they sent two, double check your order, they won&#x27;t take it back in this case. Amazon loves to automatically increase the quantity, probably accounts for 25 percent of sales.</li>
    <li> I got this for my husband.  He loves it.  The blades is much shaper than his old Remington.  He has it last 2 years and still works great!  Best buy!</li>
    <li> I cannot rate the performance of the product because it went back in the box after the first inspection.  I bought based on brand name AND the appearance that the case/holder effectively keeps the attachments organized.  I opened it up and ran through the attachments.  I wasn&#x27;t overjoyed, but I hadn&#x27;t paid much, so I thought that I&#x27;d give it a try anyhow.      I went to attach the charger (fitting it into the slot in the tray for this purpose) and looked for a nice location to place the stand.  I took the lid with the tray and attachments under the assumption that everything would be effectively stored in one location via the lid somehow nesting or attaching with the tray.  No luck.      With just a smidgen of design thought, this could be a tight \\&quot;unit\\&quot; that you could toss in a bag for travel.  Instead, you will need to find a place to toss the lid and remember its location if/when you want to travel (assuming you elect to utilize the tray/stand vs. tossing it all in a small box).</li>
    <li> The package arrived on time &amp; was in great condition upon receipt. My boyfriend loves it &amp; it helps that it&#x27;s packaged for travel easily. I highly recommend this razor!!</li>
    <li> EXCELLENT. PRODUCT IN GOOD CONDITION. BEST IMPOSSIBLE. VERY SATISFIED WITH THIS PURCHASE. THANK YOU FOR THIS SALE, you purchase GLADLY .. OK OK OK</li>
    <li> This product works fine till it is time to clean the trimming head. Your hair will collect inside trimmer head. Without cleaning the trimmer head will cloged.This will slow down trimming functions and may stop all together. The cleaning of this hair is neccessary for proper maintenance of the trimmer. (It is never mentioned). Now you will find that the hair in side the trimmer is impossiblet to remove. The hair becomes traped inside holding moisture. This will start the rust process in the trimer head. The trimmer will have a short life cycle and eventually death of your trimmer.The trimmer functionality is now at its end. Time to buy another will happen at the lease convient moment. Your trimmer is now a junk trimer which neededs to have proper depositied techniques. (The trimmer has a storage battery inclosed  in the trimmer body).</li>
    <li> Originally I bought this to trim my neck and burns and for the nose hair trimmer.  Unlike another reviewer, I found the nose hair trimmer a little awkward and couldn&#x27;t reliably get at everything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The trimmer did fine on my side burns for a month or so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I then started trimming my entire head - I&#x27;m not interested in a super close shave, so trimming is fine.  At first the largest head worked well but within a few weeks it started getting clogged and I couldn&#x27;t unclog it. I took the head apart after every use and cleaned it out.  When that didn&#x27;t work I started rinsing it out (which really shouldn&#x27;t be done because it&#x27;s already lubricated) and tapping it many times against the sink to knock out the hair, and that helped for another couple weeks but eventually the motor simply couldn&#x27;t move the head anymore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Head trimming probably isn&#x27;t the typical use for this product, but I still thought it should last more than a couple months at doing it.</li>
    <li> S*** product complete with a battery that lasts about one minute. Will most likely refuse to hold a charge after several months of use as well.</li>
    <li> I have used this Remington beard trimmer package for 3 or 4 months, and overall I am satisfied with it.  Let&#x27;s be clear about what it is.  It is NOT a shaver.  It is NOT a set of hair trimmers.  It is also NOT a body groomer.  Whatever it may be advertised as this product is specifically a beard trimmer with an attachable nose-hair trimmer.  It is also NOT a high quality product that will last for years.  It is very cheap, but it gets the job done.  If you are on a tight budget and want to trim your beard with something better than scissors, this is the product for you.  Let&#x27;s look at some of the features:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-\\&quot;Travel Case\\&quot; has no way of actually securing itself closed unless you put rubber bands around it.  The travel case also does not have room to store the charger.  This case is only good for storing the device on your bathroom shelf.  It is also designed so that you can charge the unit while the unit is in the storage case, but only while it is standing - not while it is laying down with the lid on for storage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Charger.  The unit can be used 2 or 3 times before it loses power and must be recharged.  The charger cable itself looks very weak, but I haven&#x27;t had any problems with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Nose hair trimmer.  Actually works pretty well.  I think this is the most reliable feature of this unit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Various attachments of trimmers and clips.  Cheaply made, but for the most part they get the job done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The attachments make it easy for short beard lengths and longer beard lengths but are useless for medium beard lengths.  You can trim your neck and around your ears.  You can shave with it, but you don&#x27;t get a very close shave and it takes a long time.  You can&#x27;t use it to cut your hair because it is not powerful enough.  This thing is not very durable.  There are a lot of cheap parts that can break.  Realistically I expect this product to last about a year - two if you&#x27;re lucky.  This product is a cheap piece of junk, but it works.  Recommended for anyone who wants to trim their beard and nose-hair who can&#x27;t afford anything better.  My beard trimmer hasn&#x27;t broken yet, and so far I am satisfied.  My beard is much more sculpted and controlled than it ever was before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: Now it has probably been around 9 months that I have been using this trimmer approximately two times per month. Nothing has broken yet, but it does not hold its charge very well.ts to trim their beard and nose-hair who can&#x27;t afford anything better.

    <li> Is the best grooming kit even better that new products.&lt;br /&gt;But I would like the battery works for more time.</li>
    <li> The trimmer shaved some areas clean, left tufts in others, and generally was inadequate to the task of trimming hair, which is its only purpose. I&#x27;m not a beginner, by any means, but this product was apparently tested on a flat sheet of paper. Once the curves of a face are introduced, it&#x27;s impossible to keep the grooming angle and the blades engaged. The product skipped, caught, cut me once when the guides tangled in my 1/4\\&quot; beard, and didn&#x27;t leave any part in a condition I&#x27;d consider acceptable.    When my beard grows back, I&#x27;ll be trying something else.</li>
    <li> This Remington replaces my Remington PG200 that finally wore out after 5+ years of very good service. The PG360 offers the same grooming services, but seems to be even of even quality than the PG200. I primarily use it to trim my beard and the hair around my ears. I also use the nose hair trimmer when needed. I have used the other accessories (shaver, etc.) and they are adequate, although not as thorough as a stand alone shaver would be.     When traveling, the charge lasts me about eight days, but at home the unit stays in the charger and never runs out of juice.    Because the travel kit was included with the unit, I packed everything to insure that I could use it on trips. It works well.    I would recommend this groomer to any friend or family member. In my opinion, Remington is continuing to make a quality unit at a very fair price.</li>
    <li> great little trimmer for the price. Highly recommended. Easy to use and its rechargable. Stores in its own little box.</li>
    <li> Not the best. I&#x27;m buying one from Salon Centric instead. Cosmetologist girlfriend!</li>
    <li> just what we wanted...and cheaper than the one at Target...bonus features,too...with all the extras it was a very wise find...</li>
    <li> I have only had the shaver a few months and it always worked well. However, the charger has gone south. So, it seems I must buy a new charger or new shaver. Think the \\&quot;quality\\&quot; should be for all the parts so the total package didn&#x27;t make it a year.</li>
    <li> i agree with the previous reviewer, it&#x27;s not a shaver, its a trimmer. Don&#x27;t expect a close shave.    pro:  + it does a good job of trimming the beard with the trimmer by itself   + decent job for thinning/tapering with the plastic comb attachment  + always lubricated if you keep it dry. You can rinse underwater but not recommended  + the motor runs fine at adequate speed when plugged in or on battery.  + last a long time on battery.    con:  - 14-16 hrs for 1st charge. Don&#x27;t know the future charges yet. maybe charge it once a week? (2 or 3 trim+shaves)  - The foil attachment doesn&#x27;t do a good job at all for \\&quot;cleaning up detailed areas\\&quot;  - no comb, brush or lubrification in the box.  - not a travel case, it doesnt stay closed, you need an elastic around it.   - 2 size trimmers: smaller 17mm for face, 30mm for head. The smaller clear comb attachment only goes over the smaller trimmer head. Would be nice to have a beard comb for the bigger trimmer too.  - low motor speed yet still a bit loud    Here&#x27;s the deal: Not having shaved the big 3day weekend as a test, the whole job of shaving and trimming took more than 15mins, of which only 2 or 3mins was spend using the comb attachment over the beard and did a good job of it.     But the most time wasted is messing around with the foil attachment for the \\&quot;finishing touches\\&quot;. And yet it leaves hairs behind on the neck line. if you want a clean shave, use a normal razor.    It is not a wet-dry shaver either. it works better with dry skin. The foil does ok for the cheeks if you puff them but not good for the neck. After a shower, don&#x27;t count on it. In this case the best this trimmer can do is trim your beard.    Verdict: Decent for beard maintenance or removing most of it if you want to. But for finishing touches, you&#x27;re better off with a straight rasor like a Mach 3 Turbo if you want a clean shave. This thing tries to do so many things with all its various attachments, but like the old saying goes: Do one thing and do it right.    Notes: There are no pictures to show the right way to use this trimmer in the manual, the only pic shows only the features of the device.    Also the face comb attachment is very small (17mm wide), the lack of a \\&quot;guide bump\\&quot; or little lump at the underside of this attachment makes it difficult to keep the trimmer at the same angle everywhere which makes it hard to trim the beard evenly for beginners.     I don&#x27;t have use for all the attachments on this device, but would still recommend it as a cheap device for beard maintenance in a pinch. Its light and handles well in hand.    i haven&#x27;t tried the hair cutting attachment but it looks like the engineers put more thought in the design of this larger comb attachment than they did for the beard comb attachment. Yet the motor doesn&#x27;t inspire confidence for hair cutting.    NB: See the video from Daniel Will-Harris about the [[ASIN:B000F4USF8 Panasonic ER224S All-in-One Cordless Hair and Beard Trimmer (Silver)]] for this little \\&quot;lump\\&quot; in the design to keep the trimmer at the right angle on your face.</li>
    <li> I bought this for beard trimming and for the miniature foil razor, for goatee grooming.  My last Philips unit had broke, thought the Remington would be a good replacement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The mini foil razor snags whiskers which hurts.&lt;br /&gt;The plastic guide for a #3 or #4 trim on the beard is badly designed so unless you have the unit aligned exactly right, it trims unevenly - so I end up with a #4 in some places and a #1 (or less) in others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have not used the other trimming attachments - just the main trimmer and foil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would NOT recommend this unit.</li>
    <li> Great condition and exactly what I needed. Perfect in package, not used and looks like it came directly from store</li>
    <li> I bought this to replace an older model and what a disappointment. I rate this a D+ Grade I&#x27;m tossing it out JUNK I say.</li>
    <li> I bought this for one specific reason:  trim my beard.  And Remington lost my loyalty soon after purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1.  You can&#x27;t use trimmer while on the charger if the battery is dead.  There is current going to the trimmer, why is this a problem?&lt;br /&gt;2.  It took only two months for the plastic trimmer cover piece to break.  Attachments are going to be removed and put on multiple times a week, they need to be durable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I won&#x27;t be buying another of these, ever.</li>
    <li> Works well this is my second one in 10 years</li>
    <li> Not happy with product. the info in the amazon page did not say anything about voltage and as i travel the power converters does not work for 240volt only 120volt, most products these days are dual voltage.</li>
    <li> The kit has enough tools, works fine. Doesn&#x27;t work when plugged directly in power (so can&#x27;t use when battery is down)</li>
