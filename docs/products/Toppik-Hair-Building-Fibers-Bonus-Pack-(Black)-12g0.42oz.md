      <li>In terms of hair quality this stuff is good</li>
      <li>Good luck to all of you out there.</li>
      <li>It is very easy to apply.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>literally no one could guess what I did to my thinning hair after all :) Just keep it all horizontal within 15cm distance and adapt your head position and rotations accordingly, this should be a very easy task.</li>
      <li>I could not have been more happier.</li>
      <li>I am able to sleep comfy without worrying that it will smear or rub off.</li>
      <li>I love the spray bottle....</li>
      <li>Also, use the applicator for much better aim.</li>
      <li>It is only one word to describe this product and that is INCREDIBLE ,I did not believe that it work</li>
      <li>This worked just fine until I slept overnight.  </li>
      <li>In the morning it had peeled/rolled off leaving a huge bare spot once again on the very top of my head.  </li>
      <li>so it will last for a good time I hope.</li>
      <li>Thanks to amazon prime we were able to get this in time for him to use before work.</li>
      <li>Enjoy ;)</li>
      <li>I rubbed a freshly squeezed lemon juice into my hair and scalp.</li>
      <li>I rarely write reviews but am doing so for this product because of the extent to which it has changed things for me.</li>
      <li>but hairillusion is a little better real hair quality but also costs more so...</li>
      <li>The Spray Applicator is a huge added value to the building fibers itself, I use it only in the special occasions</li>
      <li>Of course,this was my first time and my husband noticed</li>
      <li>This is the review after my first use.</li>
      <li>I also did scalp massage with hot oil and just before washing my hair</li>
      <li>I thought of buying a wig but was unsure of the experience when hit with a hot flush.</li>
      <li>It filled in where she had cut it in too short and you couldnt even tell he had anything in his hair.</li>
      <li>fast ship....</li>
      <li>I have lost hair on the top of my head towards the front due to menopause.</li>
      <li>Guys dont even listen to the ones that claim it doesnt fit, its common sense that you would have to remove 2nd lid first before you install applicator sprayer device so it can fit.</li>
      <li>I only wish this product was advertised more widely (without increasing the cost to us customers).</li>
      <li>I am a 29 years old male and my hair start thinning from like 7 or 8 years ago, I&#x27;ve tried most of the famous hair thinning formulas, products and supplements, I spent a small fortune on these products trying to fight the thinning invasion.</li>
      <li>do think the product would work just fine for the usual thinning issues.</li>
      <li>Finally, after much search, I came across a site where a young woman explained various tips for concealing thinning frontal hair.</li>
      <li>I am a very young woman in early 30s and started losing hair a few years ago.</li>

    <li> I am a 29 years old male and my hair start thinning from like 7 or 8 years ago, I&#x27;ve tried most of the famous hair thinning formulas, products and supplements, I spent a small fortune on these products trying to fight the thinning invasion. finally I gave up to the power of nature and decided to try building fibers on the days I do care for the look on.  The Spray Applicator is a huge added value to the building fibers itself, I use it only in the special occasions so it will last for a good time I hope. literally no one could guess what I did to my thinning hair after all :) Just keep it all horizontal within 15cm distance and adapt your head position and rotations accordingly, this should be a very easy task. Enjoy ;)</li>
    <li> This worked just fine until I slept overnight.  In the morning it had peeled/rolled off leaving a huge bare spot once again on the very top of my head.  I feel like a circus freak if I venture out but I guess I have to wear hats/turbans for the rest of my life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do think the product would work just fine for the usual thinning issues.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my husband due to him going to an idiot who cut his hair wrong. It looked so bad. Thanks to amazon prime we were able to get this in time for him to use before work. It filled in where she had cut it in too short and you couldnt even tell he had anything in his hair. It looked great, doing the trick. His hair looked longer and fuller.</li>
    <li> This is a great product to cover up! It looks like you have fuller in minutes and will last until your next shower.</li>
    <li> It is only one word to describe this product and that is INCREDIBLE ,I did not believe that it work but it does!</li>
    <li> I rarely write reviews but am doing so for this product because of the extent to which it has changed things for me. I have lost hair on the top of my head towards the front due to menopause. It is a traumatic experience adding years and depleting self-confidence. Visits to doctors and hair dressers resulted in vitamin regimes, hair products -conditioners, thickeners, etc. - you name it, I have bought it, but to no avail. I thought of buying a wig but was unsure of the experience when hit with a hot flush. Hair grafting was not an option due to health conditions. Finally, after much search, I came across a site where a young woman explained various tips for concealing thinning frontal hair. One of the tips was using Toppik. I turned to my first-to-go-to site, Amazon, for customer reviews and decided to try the product. It is ALL THAT IT says it does. I cannot express how grateful I am for such a product. I have used it for the past 45 days and do not get comments about my thinning hair from family members who I have not met for awhile. I only wish this product was advertised more widely (without increasing the cost to us customers).</li>
    <li> Works as advertised.  I&#x27;m impressed. It covers thinning spots without the fake look. Use hair spray after application to keep it in place. Also, use the applicator for much better aim.</li>
    <li> The product works great. It is very easy to apply.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only con is be very careful in a rainy day</li>
    <li> I am a very young woman in early 30s and started losing hair a few years ago.I parted my hair,teased them in different ways to disguise it and it worked for sometime.Recently, after the birth of my second child,9 months later(still nursing) I came to a point when my scalp(pretty wide) started showing through each time I parted my hair on any side.I got severely (suicidal thoughts type)depressed.So,desperate for a solution I would stay up till 3am to find out an answer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I researched a lot and bought Saw Palmetto(anti-dht),biotin,prenatal vitamins,ovega-3,lysine and also started to include plain yogurt,spinach and carrots in my diet.I also did scalp massage with hot oil and just before washing my hair I rubbed a freshly squeezed lemon juice into my hair and scalp.These things might work but I did not think I had enough time to let it all work. I wanted something \\&quot;now\\&quot; while I continued with these remedies.I have not tried minoxidil but I do not want to buy it for the rest of my life.I also read about hair transplant but that would be my last choice.So,I bought a very expensive wig.Of course,this was my first time and my husband noticed and I broke down.I went to a couple of salons to have it styled but they refused due to liability issues.Anyhow,a few days later I Google searched and found out about hair fibers and I decided to give this product a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Meanwhile,it was being shipped,I found out women could have hormonal imbalances and products like Yaz,yasmin,spironolactone,desogen might work but because I am nursing, I will have to try those later.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once I got \\&quot;Toppik\\&quot; in the mail,I was desperate to try it.Opened it,unscrewed the lid,attached applicator and sprayed it on my scalp.Initially,it looked like dots on my scalp and I thought I was doing something wrong.I tried to spray all over the scalp for an even look and also sprayed hair surrounding the scalp and combed with a wide toothed brush to spread it out and lo,it looked like a miracle had happened.I never had this look of dense hair until 15 years ago! I could not have been more happier.I kept looking in the mirror and could not believe what I saw.I did not use any hair spray yet.I will write a review a few months later.This is the review after my first use.Good luck to all of you out there.Just an FYI,might work if you have wide parts but not if you a big bald spot because you might need some hair to tease it around.For me,it worked like a God given gift,absolutely amazed!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want before and after pictures,email me at emailme2de@yahoo.com.</li>
    <li> Guys dont even listen to the ones that claim it doesnt fit, its common sense that you would have to remove 2nd lid first before you install applicator sprayer device so it can fit.

    <li> Fake . Not good at all</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t make my hair look any different.</li>
    <li> used it befoe i&#x27;m really impressed by the way it works</li>
    <li> fast ship....good product... I love the spray bottle....try it you&#x27;ll like it...</li>
    <li> Great product and an answer to my prayers. I am able to sleep comfy without worrying that it will smear or rub off. A God-send!</li>
