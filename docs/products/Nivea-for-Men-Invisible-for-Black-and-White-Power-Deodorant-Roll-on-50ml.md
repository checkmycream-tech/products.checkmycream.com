      <li>Perfect for travel.</li>
      <li>Internet is the best option.</li>
      <li>Very good product.  </li>
      <li>It smelled great, promised not to stain.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a great product</li>
      <li>Always my best partner, it doesn&#x27;t leave any marks and stains on clothes and quite effective.</li>
      <li>/&gt;This is a great roll-on product.  </li>
      <li>Good product, nothing to complain</li>
      <li>We are customers for life, for sure!</li>
      <li>I will order more!</li>
      <li>Plus it is very effective with a mild and pleasant fragrance.</li>
      <li>Glad I was able to buy it on Amazon as it works great.  </li>
      <li>but they did nothing, and I&#x27;m not using the product, but the one I ordered before the cool kick spray is a great one.</li>
      <li>Definitely a top product and as to why you can&#x27;t get a liquid-roll on in the US</li>
      <li>scent is nice, light, and clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It also smells more like a cologne than a deodorant.</li>
      <li>Found this in Europe when I had to buy more deodorant.  </li>
      <li>Love Nivea.  </li>
      <li>I ordered this as I was so pleased with the women&#x27;s version.</li>
      <li>Using these for years and was happy to find them online after moving to the US from Europe, because Deodorants in the US suck major!!!</li>
      <li>It has excellent odor-fighting capabilities, keeping me smelling fresh even after a long day of work.  </li>
      <li>For some reason not all Nivea, to include the deodorant, is available in the US.  </li>
      <li>This is a cheap roll-on liquid immitation from Thailand.</li>
      <li>Best product for black shirts!</li>
      <li>The good smelling odor is actually released as you sweat, unlike the deodorant I had been using.</li>
      <li>This stuff will go quickly if you use it two times a day (i.e. after gym and in the morning), so get the 3 pack</li>
      <li>I found the women&#x27;s equivalent far superior to American antiperspirants for not only pleasant light smell but also for not marking clothing and for being long-lasting.</li>
      <li>After searching high and low for a deodorant that (a) works great and</li>
      <li>This works very well, keeps me dry, smells good and lasts all day.  </li>
      <li>Great product that never leaves a mark on my shirts, but the deodorant really only last about 6 to 8 hours.</li>
      <li>It is only sold in the UK, apparently, but through the magic that is Amazon, we are able to purchase for him and have it shipped.</li>
      <li>Thank you very much.</li>
      <li>and it will last you two months or more.</li>
      <li>I have been using this product since it was first introduced.</li>
      <li>At first I had high hopes for this product.</li>
      <li>keeps me dry, has a nice smell and doesn&#x27;t cause yellow buildup under the arms of my dress shirts.  </li>
      <li>My husband and I have searched high and low for a deodorant that keeps him smelling fresh and clean but also doesn&#x27;t leave white stains on all of his clothing.</li>
      <li>Even after a long day in the heat, no smell -- and even better not a single stain on any of his shirts.</li>
      <li>Deodorant, which feels sticky for some time after application, works well for up to 48 hrs but not so if exercising or in high stress.</li>
      <li>(b) won&#x27;t stain my shirts, I decided to give Nivea Invisible for Black and White a try -- and I&#x27;m thrilled that I did.  </li>
      <li>Can&#x27;t live without it now almost.</li>
      <li>Besides, my skin is quite sensitive and easily gets irritated, yet no allergic reaction occurs due to the use of this product.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s in an attractive small glass container, albeit a bit heavy.</li>
      <li>I have had a hard time wearing white t shirts and for me there is nothing better to wear around the house on a hot summer day.  </li>
      <li>The roll on idea is cool but it just becomes a sticky mess in my armpit.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Would never use this one, rather  use Nivea for Men Fresh Active Deodorant Antiperspirant - that one worked and didn&#x27;t stink by end of day.</li>
      <li>Finally.....after living in the US for 4 mths and being driven crazy by the chalky, dry, cakey stuff they call deodorant over here (and having my armpits irritated and my clothes discoloured), I managed to source the great product I was using back home in Australia.</li>
      <li>Worth the few extra steps needed to obtain it.</li>
      <li>Also, it is true that this does not show on clothes, especially my dark shirts.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m a 25 year old active young man that was looking for a product to stop the yellow and white stains on my shirts from happening.</li>

    <li> I&#x27;m a 25 year old active young man that was looking for a product to stop the yellow and white stains on my shirts from happening. This product may in fact due that but in turn you get terrible wetness protection and are left with visibly wet underarms.</li>
    <li> I ordered this as I was so pleased with the women&#x27;s version. My husband has not tried it yet. I found the women&#x27;s equivalent far superior to American antiperspirants for not only pleasant light smell but also for not marking clothing and for being long-lasting.</li>
    <li> After about two weeks of use, I can confirm that this is definitely invisible. No marks whatsoever. It also smells more like a cologne than a deodorant. It&#x27;s a great product and I plan to use it regularly!</li>
    <li> Great product that never leaves a mark on my shirts, but the deodorant really only last about 6 to 8 hours.</li>
    <li> My husband and I have searched high and low for a deodorant that keeps him smelling fresh and clean but also doesn&#x27;t leave white stains on all of his clothing. We have tried everything under the sun -- at least on this continent -- until we heard about this product. It is only sold in the UK, apparently, but through the magic that is Amazon, we are able to purchase for him and have it shipped. It works 1000% as advertised. Even after a long day in the heat, no smell -- and even better not a single stain on any of his shirts. We are customers for life, for sure!</li>
    <li> I started ordering this deodorant from Amazon after I discovered it while traveling in Europe.  All I see here are sticks or gels which leave an unpleasant deposit, or roll-ons that are messy.  This roll-on is not sticky or wet; rather it rolls on a thin coat that dries quickly.

    <li> This is a cheap roll-on liquid immitation from Thailand. Do NOT buy!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am from Europe and wanted the comforts of products I used at home, but these do not resemble them at all.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product since it was first introduced. Before that I was sufferring from embarrassing yellow and white stains. Besides, my skin is quite sensitive and easily gets irritated, yet no allergic reaction occurs due to the use of this product.</li>
    <li> Using these for years and was happy to find them online after moving to the US from Europe, because Deodorants in the US suck major!!!</li>
    <li> This works very well, keeps me dry, smells good and lasts all day.  After running and working out for around 2 hours at the gym, it is still working well.  Also, it is true that this does not show on clothes, especially my dark shirts.</li>
    <li> I was also recommended this by collegues in Europe.  I was a bit skeptical but it works with no problems and it seems to last all day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mine took about 6-7 weeks to arrive and it was mailed for Paraguay in a padded envelope.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a very bad deodorant and useless, I wanted to cancel the order and refund it and called the customer service but they did nothing, and I&#x27;m not using the product, but the one I ordered before the cool kick spray is a great one.</li>
    <li> The roll on idea is cool but it just becomes a sticky mess in my armpit. Even if I let it dry for 10 minutes, my shirts just stick to it. Not what I was hoping for.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s in an attractive small glass container, albeit a bit heavy. Deodorant, which feels sticky for some time after application, works well for up to 48 hrs but not so if exercising or in high stress. It delivers as its name promises, i.e., creates little to no staining on skin or clothes. Perfect for travel. Worth the few extra steps needed to obtain it.</li>
    <li> I found this while traveling in Singapore and have been ordering it online since. I</li>
    <li> Always my best partner, it doesn&#x27;t leave any marks and stains on clothes and quite effective. Can&#x27;t live without it now almost.</li>
    <li> I have had a hard time wearing white t shirts and for me there is nothing better to wear around the house on a hot summer day.  This stuff will not give you tees the yellow pits - you will be amazed.</li>
    <li> No discoloration of my clothes at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent is nice, light, and clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It always takes about 3 weeks + to get the order (I think this product line must not be carried in the U.S.) which is why I order the 3-pack.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a great roll-on product.  I&#x27;ve had trouble with deodorants &amp; antiperspirants as they usually irritate my skin. But not so with this product, at all.</li>
    <li> Found this in Europe when I had to buy more deodorant.  Glad I was able to buy it on Amazon as it works great.  The good smelling odor is actually released as you sweat, unlike the deodorant I had been using.</li>
    <li> Not too heavy and washes off the next day.</li>
    <li> Finally.....after living in the US for 4 mths and being driven crazy by the chalky, dry, cakey stuff they call deodorant over here (and having my armpits irritated and my clothes discoloured), I managed to source the great product I was using back home in Australia. Definitely a top product and as to why you can&#x27;t get a liquid-roll on in the US, now that is another question........</li>
    <li> Best product for black shirts! No more white deodorant stains.  Wish they would sell this in USA market.  It is a name brand company after all..</li>
    <li> Very good product.  Love Nivea.  Been using the cream since I was a child.  Started using the deodorant after my trip to Germany two years ago.  For some reason not all Nivea, to include the deodorant, is available in the US.  Internet is the best option.</li>
    <li> Hooked on this stuff while working in Singapore in the summer. Couldn&#x27;t find anywhere in the US. Have bought dozens since returning 18 months ago and never plan to go back to US stick or Axe-like sprays ever. Also have noticed fewer stains in undershirts. always a plus. This stuff will go quickly if you use it two times a day (i.e. after gym and in the morning), so get the 3 pack and it will last you two months or more.</li>
    <li> Good product, nothing to complain</li>
    <li> At first I had high hopes for this product. It smelled great, promised not to stain. After a few days, I noticed that I still sweat. It&#x27;s like the product was either counterfeit or had expired. This was purchased from &amp;#34;Star LLC.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> keeps me dry, has a nice smell and doesn&#x27;t cause yellow buildup under the arms of my dress shirts.  I will order more!</li>
    <li> The expected. Thank you very much.</li>
