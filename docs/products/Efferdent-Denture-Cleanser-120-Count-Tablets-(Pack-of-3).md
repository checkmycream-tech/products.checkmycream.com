    <li> Cleaning your dental appliance with a toothbrush actually scratches its surface and creates grooves that bacteria can thrive in.  I have two retainers that I wear every night, and these tablets are all I use. Just drop one in warm water, then drop your appliance in, and you get a much more thorough cleaning. I switched to a local generic brand (cheaper) but they have the same effect.</li>
    <li> I will order from them again, their service is great asnd the prooduct is whast they say.</li>
    <li> Cleans well will buy again</li>
    <li> A very good product. Both my husband and myself use.  Works well. Easy to use. Very nice to have it available in a pack of 3.</li>
    <li> I use this to clean my retainer and I also soak my tooth brush in it.  The price on Amazon is much better than the local grocery store.</li>
