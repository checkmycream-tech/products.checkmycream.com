      <li>I suggest buying or using your own earrings.</li>
      <li>I would reccomend to anyone who buys this to use your own (sterilized) piercing jewlery as the studs that came with this caused my ears to become infected and</li>

      <li>The gun works great, quick and painless.</li>
      <li>I would recommend you get your own earrings when you use this product to replace these with once the hole is punched and you are able to change them.</li>

      <li>You are better off buying a needle set</li>
      <li>but I love my ear lobes</li>
      <li>would work better then this.</li>
      <li>i didn t expect more</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Would pierce through entire ear. Please do not buy this.</li>
    <li> idk if its just me but mine got rusty after about 5 months but it was very good for the price might buy again</li>
    <li> Yall are tripping mine worked fine. Pierced my ears, lips, and eyebrow and it worked with out a hassle.</li>
    <li> The piercing gun came sooner than I thought. I use the gun immediately when it came. I didn&#x27;t have any problems with it. I pierced my son&#x27;s ear and my daughters nose. It came out fantastic and happened without any glitches or jamming. I am super excited about this piercing gun and I totally recommend it.</li>
    <li> Not what I expected but I guess it&#x27;s okay</li>
    <li> I only had it for a week and I used it twice</li>
    <li> Works great, pierced my nose. Will recommend.</li>
    <li> Works well just be careful because the back of the earring sticks in the gun. Don&#x27;t pull away after you pierce! Take your time and it works perfect. Be sure to line up the earrings first because some of them are crooked.</li>
    <li> I have successfully pierced my ears several times with it. The gun works great, quick and painless. However, I would not recommend using the piercing studs that come with it. I (painfully) replaced them with better silver studs after about 4 days of my ears getting seriously infected. Its definitely worth purchasing some hypoallergenic piercing studs seperately.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve pierced my second and third hole as well as my sisters second. It works great (: it gets stuck sometimes but it doesn&#x27;t hurt. They get infected really easily even if you clean them, but put neosporin on the affected area twice a day and it will go away in 3 days (:</li>
    <li> Ok for the money. Im worried about how it shoots so fast and sometimes goes in crooked. But good thank you   Ok ive used it since my last review and I didn&#x27;t feel a thing bc it happens so fast. Lets just say now ive got six on each ear! I love this tool! :-) :-)</li>
    <li> Great product. Sticks Every now And then. But vitamin E oil helps with that. Has been used about 10 times since bought. The rings that comes with it is good for piercing, I advise that you put in a real ring after being pierced.</li>
    <li> I pierced my 2 years old daughter&#x27;s ear and it&#x27;s horrible !!! I tried to use a kids gold earings but it didn&#x27;t fit in the gun hole so i used the earings that came with it but they suck!! It stucked in her ear and i coudn&#x27;t take it out easy and she cried a loooot :(:( her one ear now is pierced with a little blue color around because she bleed :( and now she don&#x27;t want to pierce the other one !</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t come w/ instructions but there&#x27;s very easy short tutorials on YouTube!</li>
    <li> This unit will get stuck upon punching hole. It was very difficult to remove without the earring being removed causing pain and discomfort. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> I really like this gun, I have used it a lot...I did not really like the studs bc there were a lot that were not made correctly so they caused errors in the guns performance. I would recommend but make sure you pay attention to the quality of the stud you use.</li>
    <li> Works awesome! Super easy to figure out and very easy to use! Pain free! However the gun does get Stuck so I gave it a 4. Other than that works awesome I did my ears 6 times right away! It was easy and very fun !</li>
    <li> I ordered it on a July 1st recieved it July 6th.! I pierced my nose and four other people&#x27;s noses works perfectly.!</li>
    <li> pierced my lobe with this without any problems. the studs that come with it are very sharp and go through the lobe with ease</li>
    <li> Absolutely no problem. After reading the reviews, the studs are in better condition than I would have expected. I didn&#x27;t put the back in the machine while shooting, and the earring still got stuck, but I just wiggled it around some and it came out ok. It actually went so smoothly that I took it out and did it again because I missed the first time by a little bit. 4 stars cuz it got stuck both time, but seriously, it wasn&#x27;t THAT stuck.</li>
    <li> The gun works well, I like that it does not force a closer onto the other end of the earring, and supplies gentle rubber closers. It makes care for the new piercing easy, as you can allow them to properly swell and heal. It has plenty of force, and is all metal so it&#x27;s easy to sterilize. I thought the &amp;#34;cheap&amp;#34; earrings looked fine for studs and felt no need to get different ones, also I don&#x27;t think other studs would work with this gun as it&#x27;s made for these specific studs. I easily pierced myself multiple times and saved myself some $$$ as opposed to going to a local piercer, so I&#x27;m very happy with this purchase!&lt;br /&gt;WARNING: As a note I learned AFTER piercing my cartilage that you shouldn&#x27;t pierce cartilage with a gun due to blunt force trauma and possible breaks in the cartilage which will grow and look weird. So if you want to pierce cartilage buy a needle kit, they are even cheaper anyway!</li>
    <li> Really nice, I&#x27;ve used to make 3 piercings since purchase.... The piercing studs kinda suck, though and will turn the hole black if left in too long. I left in for a day or two until swelling went down then swapped with a gold stud. Gun works great, no jams.</li>
    <li> Pierces ears. Not much I can say. I used it on my wife&#x27;s ears and we didn&#x27;t have any problems at all. She&#x27;s happy with it and I can&#x27;t complain.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s fine for ear lobes but nose lip and more it gets stuck I had to go to the ER to get it removed but I love my ear lobes</li>
    <li> Could not use it at all.  It was poor quality and the piercing studs were not what I wanted to use for ear piercing.  I found this product useless.</li>
    <li> Hard to figure out with no directions and earing backings are rubber. They fall off and are hard to put on.</li>
    <li> first off, there is no clear instructions on how to use this product. I tried a few times on the piece of styrofoam that came along with the gun, and it got stuck. sI gave it a shot on my ear and it did not come out of my ear, it was impossible I eventually had my dad remove it. Do NOT get this product.</li>
    <li> This item does as described,but when using diff. piercing studs it might not fit in the gun properly which may cause difficulty. Studs included are hideous. Everything is from &amp; made in china. A case was included, but it was cracked and there was no mirror. Do they not have a qc dept? I suggest going to sally&#x27;s &amp; getting the little manual piercer, as this gun is not universal &amp; too bulky. If you&#x27;re doing this as someone who is piercing multiple people I would suggest investing in a $70 gun along with better piercing studs.</li>
    <li> The gun is great, but the earrings start rusting. I would recommend you get your own earrings when you use this product to replace these with once the hole is punched and you are able to change them.</li>
    <li> i accidentally unscrewed the thingyamajig and two pieces fell out. i am happy that i didnt lose those things because i&#x27;d be s*** out of luck. but once i was able to figure it out (pull lever back and press side piece to puncture) it was a piece of cake. do be careful about the stud getting stuck in the stud part, because that sh*** hurts when trying to pull the stud from the gun. so i would just place the stud only so far into the socket. like let it be lose enough to where the stud can fall out of the gun if held upside down. i pierced my right ear 6x already and my left 4x AND i pierced my nieces ears with no problems. no lie, its almost kind of addicting. only tried it on ears though. i cant say how it will end up if you try your nose or lip or anything.</li>
    <li> It works very well but before you use it way ha video online because it does not come with instructions. Otherwise a great gun:-)</li>
    <li> Fast refund, not what I expected.</li>
    <li> I want a new one because mine came and all the earrings were scattered everywhere and opened and the gun didn&#x27;t even work. It only went half way threw my ear and the earring was stuck.</li>
    <li> 1st time i used it it bite me lol but other then that it works real good and like it just was thinking thye trigger would have been different thats all</li>
    <li> The rings supplied are cheap (but that was expected).  The gun feels substantial and worked well (some rings felt a little loose in the gun, but still worked fine).</li>
    <li> I read the reviews and had the same experience that one person mentioned about the earring getting stuck in the gun after the ear was pierced. That happened when I pierced my daughter&#x27;s ear using the earrings that came in the package. I used gem studded earrings from Walmart and that worked so much better. Also, I took the advice of another buyer that said not to add the back enclosures to the gun.</li>
    <li> actually works pretty well. studs are ugly but it seems it&#x27;d be easy to switch.</li>
    <li> I received the piercing kit about 3 weeks of it&#x27;s estimated arrival date. Nothing fancy, but it got the job done. It didn&#x27;t hurt at all when I pierced my second lobe holes and my helix, and I haven&#x27;t had any problems. The earrings are not the best-looking, but no problems with them! The gun works great and is easy to use.</li>
    <li> I picked this up going off some other reviews of the product....not even close.  Sure this will punch a stud thru your earlobe, but thats about the end of it. We tried to  do a nose like everyone boasted they did, the stud would break the skin and push back into the gun and get lodged.  There&#x27;s no power behind it to at all, it&#x27;s not adjustable, and if you want to do something other than a normal ear pierce, spend a couple more bucks and buy something better.</li>
    <li> never know the gun was so small. very clean and in place. well recommend to anybody who is buying this product</li>
    <li> I received the ear piercing gun. Only the gun no instructions,  no studs as advertised. Waiting for my refund</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s the cheapest gun I ever seen and the earrings that come with it are ao cheap. Never this one.</li>
    <li> I was really disappointed with this. It fell apart before I even got to use it. It is very cheap quality. Hopefully I can get mine to get fixed. Overall just not happy with it.</li>
    <li> Never ever use a piercing gun. Always go to a professional and make sure they use a needle! Yes it&#x27;s a little bit expensive but its a safe way to go. What is the cost of your heath and safty?</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s nice and compact, even comes with it&#x27;s own case. The only problem is the rubber backs tend to stick to their groove and it&#x27;s hard to not tug on your freshly pierced ear.</li>
    <li> This gun was a piece of crap. It broke multiple times, the earring wouldn&#x27;t release, the gun broke while I was piercing my ear, so I had an earring and gun stuck in my ear while I&#x27;m bleeding with no way to get it out</li>
    <li> Cheaply made. The mirror was not properly glued on the box and t fell off when opening it. The earrings that come with it look very cheap and I&#x27;m fearful to use it.</li>
    <li> I was TERRIFIED when I saw this \\&quot;Piercing gun\\&quot;, it didn&#x27;t come with ANY instructions, So I Practiced on some foam a few time before doing it to myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Put earring in Gun, DO NOT ADD THE BACK, they get stuck!&lt;br /&gt;2. Cock back the gun&lt;br /&gt;3. Put gun in place , and \\&quot;Pull Trigger\\&quot; doing so will close the space between the needle and your ear&lt;br /&gt;4. Pull down the \\&quot;safety\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BAM your ear is pierced!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;IF it seems to stick (the earring) Twist the knob on the back part :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just got mine in the mail this afternoon, Did 8 piercings tonight with it (2 in my ear, BFs, BFFs and Roommates)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Im a little scared of the \\&quot;studs\\&quot; that came with it, So I&#x27;m most likely going to change them out in a few days.</li>
    <li> I liked it! No pain but it was kind of difficult to keep the stud in. All and all good piercing gun!</li>
    <li> I bought this to use for a friend- feeling that I could operate it easily as it was not my first time using a gun. I was disappointed but the INCONSISTENT force of the gun. It ended up just bruising the ear without actually piercing and causing some bleeding. After a few attempts, we decided to just head to the piercing parlor. I encourage people to NOT but this gun. Spend the extra money for a quality gun and leave the stress behind.</li>
    <li> I would reccomend to anyone who buys this to use your own (sterilized) piercing jewlery as the studs that came with this caused my ears to become infected and also the small backing to become pushed in and stuck in my earrlobe.</li>
    <li> I got this gun to pierce my  grand daughters ears. I have one but could not find it. the gun comes with no instructions of information. It also had some bent studs and the backs are not what I expected. Also fatter earlobes seem to be a problem. You have to be very careful where you finally pierce because stud moves. It works but I&#x27;m not really impressed with this gun.</li>
    <li> I was able to get good results with this device. I wish there were a way to find out which post are compatible with out buying and then realizing the post don&#x27;t work. The post that came with it were decent, they did the job.</li>
    <li> The gun itself is sturdy, it did not come with instructions but was easy enough to figure out and worked fine. The earrings, are junk! They are a cheap metal which turned our ears black and caused infection. We had to take them out and heal the hole. They also were not star shaped, they were concave rounds. Kind of ugly. Over all, it&#x27;s a good purchase for the gun only. Don&#x27;t bother with the junk earrings.  Also, I would NOT use this for anything other than the ear. There is very little room to work with.</li>
    <li> Not too good I don&#x27;t like it terrible stud is too small for my lip</li>
    <li> This gun is super cool it pierced me without any pain&lt;br /&gt;But I have a high pain tolerance some of the studs didn&#x27;t fit&lt;br /&gt;But for the price no big deal&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m satisfied&lt;br /&gt;Shipping was on time</li>
    <li> it arrived very quickly, however when it didit came in a bubble wrapped evelope. the earrings inside stabbed my mother when she got it out of the mail to leave inside for me, later it stabbed me as well when i picked it up. i then couldnt help but wonder just how many people it had stabbed and cut along the way here and it just grossed me out. should of been boxed or packaged better. sadly my troubles with this do not stop there. i open the case and the contents are broken (mirror and marker).  also there was no guide on how to use the gun.. not very happy with this purchase overall.</li>
    <li> I purchased this to pierce my ear lobes. I didn&#x27;t have any problems with the gun itself the earrings however were cheap but thanks to the reviews i read before my purchase. I purchased different piercing earrings and they still fit in the gun. The gun took a little time to figure out though since it came with no instructions.</li>
    <li> very good product i was very please,easy to use.good job with your product,i will shop next time with you,thanks you</li>
    <li> Bought this kit, got it a few days later. The gun itself is compact and easy to use. My only problem is that I did not recieve any of the 49 pairs of piercing studs. Left a complaint and waiting to hear back. IF my order is corrected I will definitely leave a 5 STAR rating. If not then at least the Gun is well worth the $10</li>
    <li> I bought this to pierce my nose and it did so with ease and zero pain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pros:&lt;br /&gt;Inexpensive&lt;br /&gt;Fast&lt;br /&gt;Easy&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cons:&lt;br /&gt;Nothing is sterile&lt;br /&gt;No instructions included&lt;br /&gt;The studs are big, ugly, and all the same&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How I did it:&lt;br /&gt;Although this came with no instructions, it was easy to figure out. You put the gun in place and squeeze what looks like the &amp;#34;trigger&amp;#34; to hold the area to be pierced in place (this &amp;#34;trigger&amp;#34; does not fire the gun), then adjust it. The tension knob on the back of the gun can be tightened or loosened. I made the tension so it would reach my nose when the gun was fired, but would come just shy of hitting my skin, which would hurt. Once the tension is adjusted to a comfortable level, remove the gun. Make sure your hands are very clean, sterilize the bejesus out of the entire gun and earring with alcohol. Do the same with the body part you are going to pierce! Do NOT skip the alcohol sterilization! Put the stud in the business end of the gun (there&#x27;s a little hole that it fits in) with the sharp side pointing out. Mark the area to be pierced. Pull the tension knob all the way back to cock the gun. Carefully line up the gun with the mark you made. Give a shout out to your dead homies and ancestors, take a deep breath, count to three, chicken out. Count to three again, shout as if you are going into battle, chicken out. Get some courage for crying out loud woman! You&#x27;ve given birth, you can do this! Count to three again, make sure the gun is still lined up properly. Touch the actual trigger (that little metal flap above the &amp;#34;trigger&amp;#34; area) and wonder what all the fuss was about. Then think about what else you can pierce, because you are a bada$$ and are drunk with power now!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*I am not a doctor, I just play one on tv. Always use common sense and good judgement...especially when you are putting holes in your body. When in doubt, go to a professional! You can sue them if they mess up. You can&#x27;t sue yourself (at least not that I know of).</li>
    <li> It did the job, the only complaint was that getting the gun to realease from earing was a little difficult but manageable.</li>
    <li> I bought this and it came in earlier that expected which who doesn&#x27;t love when that happens! Because i am allergic to most metals i ordered different earrings (so can&#x27;t really say how they are), i used the gun to pierce my cartilage but it didn&#x27;t go through the last layer of skin so i had to pop it through with my fingers. If you&#x27;re planning on piercing cartilage you may not want this but otherwise it works well, is cheaper and in my opinion cleaner than going to some place on the mall. Best of all it didn&#x27;t hurt at all!</li>
    <li> This item was the worst piercing gun I have ever used. The movement was very jerky and caused pain. Very dissatisfied.</li>
    <li> STURDY!  Lots of earrings/piercers included.  It has a major amount of pressure, so piercings are fast and successful.&lt;br /&gt;I did pinch two fingers while fiddling with it, but that was my fault.&lt;br /&gt;Recommended.</li>
    <li> You get what you pay for, this item would not pierce through the ear. I tried on 2 separate occasions and it did not go through all the way and the 2nd time the earring stud got stuck in the gun. This is not a good buy, don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> This is awful and dangerous.  They cannot be cleaned properly and they can cause blunt force trauma to wherever the piercing is placed.  Piercing guns should barely be used for ear piercings.  And &amp;#34;professionals&amp;#34; at the mall or wherever are rarely trained how to use it. If people who do this professionally are not very good at it, you won&#x27;t do very well by yourself at home.  DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT. GO SEE A REAL PIERCER.</li>
    <li> So I got this today and the gun got completely stuck! I cannot get it unstuck! I&#x27;m not very happy :/</li>
    <li> THIS IS WAS AN AMAZING PRODUCT I THOUGHT IT BE CRAP WITH HOW CHEAP I GOT IT BUT I T WORKS AMAZING AND I USE IT ALL THE TIME ON MYSELF AND OTHERS THank you deff will recemend</li>
    <li> Smaller than it looks in the photos.&lt;br /&gt;Construction is iffy and hard to clean but otherwise solid.&lt;br /&gt;Studs are basic metal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No real complaints.</li>
    <li> Got here fast. Works properly however it is rather loud. Try not to jump when it goes off.</li>
    <li> Item came as described and earlier than expected , I have used the product 5 times and it does work but now the trigger is sticking. It definitely Is not the same quality ear piercing guns that you find at the piercing shops.  There is a reason it is so inexpensive and the next time I will be purchasing the $69.00 gun.</li>
    <li> This gun is very hard to hold. The metal handle is small and slick.  The starter earrings, that come with the gun, the posts are to short and the backs are hard to use with the gun. Very painful when the earrings don&#x27;t want to come off of the gun. For the price, and if your not using on a child or on your self, you might like it.</li>
    <li> Works Great I&#x27;m loving it</li>
    <li> I do not own one and I never will but I reccomend to NEVER buy one they are horrible to use and I could give a whole medical and science lesson on these guns</li>
    <li> Dissatisfied because none of the studs came with it like the description says. Bought other studs but they are too small for it. Not worth the money if you can&#x27;t do anything with it.</li>
    <li> The earring gun works great. The studs sent with gun have cheap backs , the backs come off easily and  you lose earring. Boy it hurts pushing the earring back through! OUCH!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been piercing ears and body parts for years I bought this cause I just wants to pierce my 8 month olds ears so I bought this thinking it was gonna be decent for the price . U can&#x27;t use any other piercing studs except the ugly big round silver ones that come with it and after I pulled the trigger it only went halfway through and got stuck . Totally traumatized my daughter I bought another for the same amount from another company and worked 10x better and it was universal with piercing studs</li>
    <li> Yes, it does a good job. For the price cant beat.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s good, I like it.</li>
    <li> Couldn&#x27;t firgure out how i was supposed to pierce someone with it let alone myself but i kinds just want my money back</li>
    <li> I had no idea what to expect when I was purchasing this item. First of all, it shipped extremely fast. I received it only 4 days after ordering. I was really happy about that. Unfortunately, it doesn&#x27;t come with any instructions at all so I had to figure out how to do it myself. Once I figured out how it worked I used it and it worked perfectly. I it comes with 96 earrings and backs for the earrings. I don&#x27;t recommend using the earrings that comes with it. They irritated my ears and made my earlobes swell up and itch. Obviously I was allegoric to them. if you have that problem certain jewelry I suggest buying or using your own earrings. I pierced my ears with the earrings they provided because they fit perfectly in the gun, but then I took them out immediately and used my own earrings and after I did that my ear swelling went down and healed up. I do recommend buying this product. It is worth it for the price compared to going to and getting your ears pierced elsewhere! Good luck!</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t buy. Waste of money.</li>
    <li> this gun only works correctly three out od ten times and the earings arent preety or a variety pack like it leads you to think my six year old doesnt cry when they draw blood but cried when the gun messed up and i had to pry her ear off a ring stuck in the gun. it came fast but its junk....</li>
    <li> When I received this, first of all it&#x27;s smaller and scarier looking in person. The marker that it came with was cracked in half! So that was useless. The studs were all scattered in the box and the gun had to be reassembled because someone didn&#x27;t assemble it correctly. But with all the bad stuff I have to say about it, it DID in fact pierce my ears and I haven&#x27;t had an issue with it. I honestly wish I would have spent a little more for a better kit, but it&#x27;s done and I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll be piercing at home anymore.</li>
    <li> We haven&#x27;t used it yet, There was no instructions included with the tool.&lt;br /&gt;It would have been nice to have some instructions.</li>
    <li> Not a bad ear gun, the earrings aren&#x27;t the best but it gets the job done.</li>
    <li> Mine did not pierce straight and no matter how careful I was, every piercing go infected.  I bought a different brand after and had no problems.</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t used it yet, but expect to be as good as the other one.</li>
    <li> The gun doesn&#x27;t come with instructions, the stud earrings get stuck in the gun after you pierce so its painful trying to get them unstuck. If you are allergic nickle, do NOT use the studs. I found out the hard way.</li>
    <li> I used it for my triples and doubles and also my sisters ears. I also pierced my lip with it and it work so well. No complaints on it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend for beginner pierces!</li>
    <li> Love it fast shipping&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s like a travel size percings kit</li>
    <li> I was skeptical to buy this because of the reviews but the after i relized how to use it, you pull the back and then press the trigger so it shoots the earring in, it worked really well. since it so cheap i didnt expect much but ive already pierced over 20 ears with it and its still working well.</li>
    <li> I needed to repierce my ears as I had stopped wearing earrings years ago. Buying this was cheaper than having my ears pierced. If your careful and take your time this works fine and is better than the old needle and thread method. One word of caution; The earrings that come with this are not hypoallergenic or even stainless steel. If your sensitive to metals you would need to take the gun where ever you can buy piercing earrings and fit stainless steel or hypoallergenic earrings to the gun. I had to switch into my good earrings about 2 weeks after I pierced my ears as my ears itched and stayed red and irritated around the piercings. As soon as I changed to gold the irritation healed.</li>
    <li> The gun itself works wonderful if you don&#x27;t use the backings. I pierced the upper cartilage of my ears, no pain whatsoever was quick and simple, and then I put on the backings.  I read reviews on how the gun would get stuck and didn&#x27;t want that, and the backings most of the time fell off the gun while I was trying to position it on my ears anyways..lol  There was no instructions on how to use the gun, but toying around with it before you pierce you&#x27;ll figure it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The earrings itself are cheap and will irritate sensitive ears.  After a couple of days these started to irritate my ears causing redness and swelling, I was able to change them out to another pair of studs that don&#x27;t irritate.  But these earrings are fine to actual pierce with, just be aware of irritation and have another pair of studs on hand to change them out with if need be.</li>
    <li> i did piercings on both sides of my lips with this. its easy to use and it costs a hell of alot less than going to someone to open them for you.</li>
    <li> the gun didn&#x27;t work, but the earrings were nice</li>
    <li> never even used it it was manufactured impractically and doesn&#x27;t look anything like in the pictures advertised, TOTAL RIPOFF.</li>
    <li> works great! I pierced my ears and a couple of other peoples ears. even pierced cartiledge easily. the earrings that came with it are kinda cheap and crappy, and the backs dont stay on them. but the gun itself is solid and works great</li>
    <li> I pierced our daughters ears with this and she said it felt like a little pinch. The earring did give me a little difficulty detaching from the gun when I pierced her ear. Not sure about other piercing s because we only intended to do the ears.</li>
    <li> This gun got stuck on my nose and over and over again i&#x27;d punch it through trying to get it out ..... horrible experience</li>
    <li> The gun Works well. Earrings to pierce with suck though. And there are no instructions. And nothing is in a sterile package.</li>
    <li> More often than not the back of the earring gets stuck in the gun and causes more pain than necessary. If this happens it can be fixed by filing the the area that holds the back so that it is open a little more to where the backs no longer stick.</li>
    <li> I love this piercing gun! I have pierced my ears with needles and that was painful. This gun makes the process quick and next to painless. we had a small issue with the tension but other than that great! I love this thing. I did my friends ear and both of mine. As to the mirror thing people so frequently complain about...have another person or go into your bathroom and use that. I personally don&#x27;t care about it not coming with the small mirror for 8 bucks you can&#x27;t go wrong with this gun. It has a robust, industrial look and comes with a ton of silver ball studs. I am planning on buying another one soon.</li>
    <li> I ordered this in the middle of February, and it had said I was supposed to arrive toward the end of March.&lt;br /&gt;I got the gun on the 25th of February, so it came in a timely manner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The gun works great, and its metal so its really easy to sterilize.&lt;br /&gt;Only problem I ran into was one of the studs pierced the ear, but then came back out and stayed in the gun.&lt;br /&gt;It was a problem with the stud though, not the gun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The mirror was also broken, but I didn&#x27;t really give a crap about it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re looking for a piercing gun I suggest it.</li>
    <li> Wife has used this gun about 10 times and works but its not perfect. seems to stick every once and while. the provided studs are wrothless and either are broken and damage when received. The price and the build of the gun is wroth the money, suggest buying better studs to use with the gun.</li>
    <li> its actually a really good product i had been searching for a gun for a while and finally found one. this works really great and is helping me make a lot of money! Came very fast and on time. All in all a very good product.</li>
    <li> The gun sucks! It broke like nothing and the earring studs are cheap. I disliked it so much. So not worth it</li>
    <li> We received this and my grandgirls pierced each other&#x27;s ear cartilage the very same day in the very first try. The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is because the earring sometimes sticks in the gun. Over all, a great purchase and it came with the piercing studs!</li>
    <li> Have not used this yet. But looks easy enough. Will try it out soon.</li>
    <li> This is easy to use and relatively painless. Just wash your hands, use alcohol wipes and peroxide to sterilize everything, and you are good to go. I did four piercings on myself with this today and it was easy and painless. Some soreness is to be expected afterward but the initial piercing pain is very minimal.</li>
    <li> Great product for the price!!! I love all the studs that come with the piercing gun.  I like that it comes with a storage case.</li>
    <li> the free studs where bent up and the case was cracked open from where they stuffed every thing in .</li>
    <li> no one should ever get one of these because i damages your tissue... unsafe if you want some thing pierced get a kit with needles never a gun</li>
    <li> It s good for the price..i didn t expect more</li>
    <li> Recently bought this piercing gun, and it has exceeded my expectations ten-fold.  VERY easy to use, painless, and quick!  Pierced both my ears, and my lip with no complications.  Just a reminder to those who are thinking about buying this, pierce first, then put the back on it.  It&#x27;s much easier than doing it all at once because the back gets caught in the gun from time to time.  Other than that, I couldn&#x27;t have asked for a better product!</li>
    <li> U can notn I repeat u can not use on lip or nose. Beware</li>
    <li> Works great.  No problems at all.</li>
    <li> Gun is easy to figure out, the reason for 4/5 stars is because of earings are horrible. I had a allergic reaction. So I would buy different earings but the gun is awesome.</li>
    <li> Came with everything and did everything as promised. I have done several piercing a now from cartilage to lobes and it worked perfectly</li>
    <li> Terrible product do not buy it unless you want your ears infected with the cheap metal!!!!! No!!! Stay away!!</li>
    <li> You guys are seriously idiots if you&#x27;re trying to pierce anything other than your earlobe with this.&lt;br /&gt;These guns are not designed to pierce through the cartilage of the upper ear, or to pierce any part of the body other than the ear lobe. Some U.S. states and some countries in Europe have already banned piercing guns for use on cartilage, including ear cartilage and nostrils. Improper usage of piercing instruments upon areas of the body not intended for their use can lead to additional problems. Jewelry that is too short for the tissue, or inappropriately shaped, especially jewelry used in the mouth, can embed itself into the body, with the wound effectively healing over it. This can require the surgical removal of the jewelry in some cases and can lead to abscesses, infection and severe scarring. In many piercings, the narrow gauge of the jewelry used by piercing guns can lead to tearing and other ongoing trauma that expose the body to infection and cause permanent scarring.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, with normal use, this is a great piercing gun for such a low price.</li>
    <li> I see mixed reviews with these types of items, some great, some awful. Though for me, I will say the price is good, the item shipped quickly and the gun worked fine. Im a happy customer.</li>
    <li> Very cheaply made. Spend the couple extra&lt;br /&gt;dollars and get the bretter one.its worth the brettrer one if you plan on using it.</li>
    <li> I got this for fast and almost painless piercing for my ears what I got was a gun that stuck all four times in my ear and only pierced my ear half way!! You are better off buying a needle set would work better then this.</li>
    <li> I pierced my daughters ears with this tool many times, it works great every time. There are some good you tube videos using this great product. It is small and everything came in the kit as stated.</li>
    <li> Easy enough to use but the thing broke in about a weeks time and I barely used it, very disappointed.</li>
    <li> I have pierced several ears and hasn&#x27;t got stuck once.I recommend only using on the ears, cause when I did my nose it swelled up and was sore for days. Also I had to leave the stud in until the swelling went down to put a regular nose ring in. I don&#x27;t recommend it for piercing eyes, lips, nose, etc. because your more likely to swell and have infections. I would recommend hollowed needles for other body piercings.</li>
    <li> FIVE STARS!! Got here quick. And who ever is saying it sucks, they did something wrong. This product is fantastic. How ever you should sterilize the studs.</li>
    <li> This is an easy to use piercing gun. SANITIZE the entire gun and studs with rubbing alcohol first!! Put your chosen stud in, adjust tension, pull back the lever, and BAM - ear is pierced. It&#x27;s a little difficult to get a straight shot on your ears all by yourself, so get a buddy to help. Yes, you do have to wiggle the stud out a bit because it sticks in the gun, so expect to have to do that. The back of the stud - little soft plastic or silicone jobs - that came with the kit just stink. They fall off during regular wear and are a total waste of time. The studs are okay, basic cheap metal stars. Tried other backs - butterfly kind - but they would not fit the studs. I would definitely get a different set of studs to pierce with since you have to wear them for a while so you can heal. Worth the cost, so I could do several sets of piercings myself and not spend the $60+ per set at the tattoo shop.</li>
    <li> Worked great and feels well made for being so inexpensive. I suggest cleaning and re-oiling moving parts for a smoother operation.</li>
    <li> LOVE it, pierced my nose and,it worked amazing. Only bad thing was it came with no instructions but easy to figure out!!</li>
    <li> This product is not quite what I had expected, but by no fault of the company. My own lack of knowledge for this type of product is what led to my disappointment. Overall, the product was exactly what it had described it would be. I would definitely order from this company again.</li>
    <li> I really love this product was able to use this gun to pierce my lip as well.&lt;br /&gt;The shipping was really fast&lt;br /&gt;overall good gun</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m excited that I got this product in such a timely manner. I&#x27;ve already used it and. I haven&#x27;t had it even 24 hours. Product was exactly as described and even better than the description.</li>
    <li> I purchase this piercing gun about a week ago and well I&#x27;ve pierce my ear already I have 4 piercings in both of my ears total of 8 I get so many complements ahhh I&#x27;m so happy and since I have a lot of studs left i will try and pierce ppls ear why not make some cash out of it :D I love it (:</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s built kinda crappy. It pierces well but it&#x27;s really hard to get the piercings centered correctly into your ear.</li>
    <li> Both the gun and the studs are JUNK</li>
    <li> This product is not worth the money. It came missing pieces as well as broken stuff.&lt;br /&gt;The cost and time to return it is outrageous.</li>
    <li> got the kit today and its pretty cool&lt;br /&gt;I thought the gun would be bigger but ehhh&lt;br /&gt;the gun works great I have already done about 10 piercings&lt;br /&gt;made a about $100 also selling better ear rings an what not&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If your interested in buying this do it</li>
    <li> This piercing gun works well, it comes with gold studs, which are really cute.&lt;br /&gt;The only problem I faced is that the stud will stick in the cartridge on occasion, which is not only painful but annoying.&lt;br /&gt;This can be fixed easily by using a pair of (clean) pliers to hold the back side of the piercing and then removing the stud from the gun...But still, kind of a drag.</li>
    <li> The gun itself works fine. I recommend cleaning it before you use it; when I opened mine there was some kind of gunk on the handle. The studs it comes with are fine for piercing, but I didn&#x27;t leave them in my ear; I switched it out with studs of my own. I put a third set of holes in my lobes and pierced my cartilage. I&#x27;ve read a lot about piercing guns not being safe to use for cartilage piercing, but so far I haven&#x27;t had any problems. The packaging was also pretty sloppy, but other than that, it&#x27;s a decent product for the price!</li>
    <li> I have used the gun so many times it&#x27;s not even funny. It does what it is supposed to. One tip, place a little Jojoba oil or petroleum jelly in the slot that holds the stud to help keep it from sticking to the gun.</li>
    <li> I love it but they need to make some more with different sizes and plus they need to upgrade but for right now I love it need to find some more product</li>
    <li> This product came with no instructions.  I&#x27;m wary of using it because of this reason.</li>
    <li> My gun came on monday it didnt have any instructions it was supposed to be a body piercing gun what a performance trying to pierce my lip i wouldnt recommend buying it 2 stars</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s no good I will never buy again don&#x27;t buy it crap a pice of junk I put it in th e trash</li>
    <li> Couldn&#x27;t even use it because the hole where the earring is suppose to go wasn&#x27;t snug enough to hold it in place. Wouldn&#x27;t of been able to pierce straight. This is the first time I write a bad review.  I&#x27;d give this a ZERO star if I could. Also the earrings that come with it are fake so if a person has sensitive skin this would not be recommended for them.</li>
    <li> Did not work poor quality.</li>
    <li> When I used it on someone else the stud got stuck in the ear,other than that it was what I needed and I pierced my nose without a problem.It did take some time to figure out how to use i but,after some help from my husband and looking some things up after that, it was simple,but like I said they need to send instructions with this product,,because  if your not familiar with a pierceing  gun you will not know how to use without so sort of guide.</li>
    <li> Crappy and the earrings that&#x27;s come with it suck and feel very cheap</li>
    <li> I am 62 years old.  Who knew I could pierce my own ears.  Nothing to it.  Easy, painless, I love it.</li>
    <li> When the gun got to me, it was broken. Oh, they also gave me flower studs. Why? This was a RIPOFF.</li>
    <li> Do not buy! It was cheaply made and would probably hurt you!</li>
    <li> Easy to use works great bo complants.</li>
    <li> Horrible!!! It came with no instructions i had to read it online and guess which part is which, some of the earrings were crooked and some of the earrings where dirty. Also DO NOT PUT THESE EARRINGS IN YOUR EAR IF YOU ARE ALLERGIC TO CHEAP EARRINGS Ive had these in for a week and my ears are already infected so think twice before you buy this</li>
    <li> New, clean, and shipped on time... great buy..</li>
    <li> Works pretty well I enjoy it</li>
    <li> Once I figured out exactly how to use it, which was finding someone using it on youtube.  There was no instruction with the kit. I almost sent it back. But it works great. Pierced both my ears. Thanks</li>
