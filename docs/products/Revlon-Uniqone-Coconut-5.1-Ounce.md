<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Not bad, detangles moisturizers , repairs overworked bleached blonde hair, protects from hair dryer , gives body.</li>
    <li> This is an awesome product.</li>
    <li> I use Uniq Coconut in my hair every single day.  It helps smooth my hair out and makes it very soft.  I do use another product afterwards, but alone it works wonders as well.  I use the second product, which is basically an oil for the ends of my hair, due to the amount of time it takes me to blow dry my hair, it re-moisturizes my ends...  Great product and it smells wonderful and light.</li>
    <li> Works great, but I don&#x27;t care for the fake coconut smell. I was expecting something that didn&#x27;t smell like tanning lotion.</li>
    <li> I like this better than the original. The smell is wonderful- reminds me of summer at the beach.</li>
    <li> This product is great for all kinds of hair very light wt</li>
    <li> Amazing product !!!! Amazing service 👍👍👍</li>
    <li> I received my item now ! The smell a bit to strong but fades on application on my hair if u like the coconut smell u will be okaye but i love the orinal scent from the red bottle i ll mix the two i guess lol</li>
    <li> My hair feels fabulous!</li>
    <li> It did not work as I expected and the smell of coconut is too heavy.</li>
    <li> My absolute favorite hair product. Being a blond, my hair gets dried out easily. This literally changed the texture of my hair, from dried out and frizzy, and prone to breakage...to soft and smooth, easy to comb through. Love Love LOVE it.</li>
    <li> Smells great!  Makes my limp hair smooth and full.  I&#x27;ll be buying more.</li>
    <li> May be a bad batch...smell is good but doesn&#x27;t seem to Work as well in my hair as the last few times I&#x27;ve used it.</li>
    <li> Love this product, my hairdresser gave me a sample and I am hooked- love it!</li>
    <li> makes my hair feel so good and smooth after wash and set.</li>
    <li> Love this product. It speaks for itself. My package was damaged and the bottles weren&#x27;t in the box.</li>
    <li> I have curly frizzy hair, always struggling to find someone who knows how to cut it and style it. I found a new hair stylist and she used this product on my hair after the hair cut. OMG!!!! This product is Phenomenal!!! It kept my curls defined and soft and also healthy looking FRIZZ FREE!!! My hair stylist highly recommended that I start using it and she was right!!! I wish I would&#x27;ve found this product years ago. I can honestly say this is the BEST thing I have ever used on my curls. I&#x27;m so pleased with the results, just amazing!</li>
    <li> My stylist recommended me to use this product after shampoo and conditioning, on wet hair and to leave it on for the rest of the day. It feels SO silky! LOOKS healthy and SMELLS delicious! Like if you were at the beach!! It does not leave any waste on my hair and never fells greasy. I am curley haired but I had a strightening treatment a month ago, so this seems to be a perfect complement and even when my hair is long, I don&#x27;t need to use too much; just 5 clicks and my hair is perfect all day long!</li>
    <li> Fast delivery and great product!</li>
    <li> Great seller and awesome product!!!</li>
    <li> Nice product, but I prefer the original version</li>
    <li> My stylist uses this and the amazon price is a better deal.  I have fine, colored hair and it seems to make comb outs easier and my hair appear thicker.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent product.  I&#x27;m only grading it 4 stars instead of 5 because I&#x27;m not crazy with the smell of coconut in my hair.  Love!!!! The smell of the red one.</li>
    <li> I love this hair product!  Leave-in conditioner, slight amount of oil for protection from heat and environment and mild-medium control.  Love the smell &amp; silky feel of my dry hair!</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed much improvement in hair structure, texture or shine.  I have experimented with varying amounts and have learned not to use too much or hair appears greasy and weighed down</li>
    <li> best product in my bathroom!!</li>
    <li> received product from stylist first, was blown away at feel, looks and feel of my hair.  Got one of each red for daily use, white coconut for beach feel...neitherare too strong smellwise.  they both work fantastic</li>
    <li> Love!! This stuff I&#x27;ve tried everything to soften my daughters hair (she&#x27;s African American/Caucasian) and this stuff is AMAZING</li>
    <li> I found this in my Aunts salon a while back and gave it a try. It is an amazing product and has a wonderful smell of coconut, which I love! It detangles my hair and keeps the frizz a bit tame. Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> Great product. Detangles my hair and makes it so soft.</li>
    <li> Best conditioner ever</li>
    <li> Great product! Great service !</li>
    <li> This is the only spray that has many a real difference in my daughters&#x27; hair!! Love it!! Great smell, light spray, does  not make hair dirty. A must for long hair.</li>
    <li> This product is one I can count on to make my hair soft and manageable.  I&#x27;m hoping that another scent may be developed.....peppermint????  :)</li>
    <li> The best thing in the world for your hair!!  I&#x27;ve tried different hair products and this one works great!! Make sure to apply when hair is wet, smells delicious!!! My hair stylist recommended this and I decided to give it a try, Im glad I did!</li>
    <li> Great sender I would highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Fiancè LOVES this product! Makes her hair super soft and easy to brush through.</li>
    <li> I ordered this before and loved it but this bottle I just ordered seems old or something. It smells different, has a weird consistency and leaves my hair greasy. Not happy..</li>
    <li> I love this stuff and use it on mine and both my daughters hair.  It has helped my youngest daughters (8 yr) very bad ends and all of our hair has grown faster and longer.  She no longer had the very damaged ends.  This is the 3rd bottle I have gotten.</li>
    <li> Great fast conditioning for pre-styling. Smells wonderful too!</li>
    <li> Love the smell.  And, love that it keeps my hair moisturized and clean after a lot of swimming.</li>
    <li> Fast delivery and love this stuff</li>
    <li> The best for my hair.!</li>
    <li> It ok .  I like it.&#x27;s a 10 better. I have coarse hair. It&#x27;s a 10 softens it better</li>
    <li> i justl love love love this product! my hair is beautiful now!</li>
    <li> Great for the hair.  Detangles wet hair as promised.  Arrived very quickly and as promised.  I use it all the time now.  Great transaction.</li>
    <li> I finally found something I like! I love the smell it makes my hair soft and beautiful all day long.</li>
    <li> This product is great as a detangler, for controlling friz, hydrating my hair and leaving it feeling soft with a natural shine. Because of the friz control my curls are smooth and defined</li>
    <li> Leaves your hair healthy and soft. Love the smell</li>
    <li> Excellent - gave me the shine I wanted....</li>
    <li> Works well, but I prefer the other fragrance</li>
    <li> This product is great I love it and its a cheaper price than a salon.</li>
    <li> My hairdresser used the regular scented one in the red bottle one time at an appointment and I loved the way my hair felt afterward. I love the light scent of coconut with this version. It makes my hair easier to detangle, and makes it silky smooth when I dry it. Plus it makes my hair so soft that I use it every time after after I wash my hair. Great product.</li>
    <li> The product functions as well as the,&amp;#34;original flavour&amp;#34;. However, for how pungent the original is, I&#x27;m let down that the coconut scent isn&#x27;t as strong. Kind of a let down since I love coconut so much... oh well. Guess I&#x27;ll just stick with the original which always gets me noticed!</li>
    <li> Love the product and it smells great!</li>
    <li> Great product and love the coconut smell.</li>
    <li> I have to agree with some of the other posters, this one is not as good as the original. It leaves my hair full of static and does nothing to impart the softness the original UniqOne does.</li>
    <li> Like it better than the regular.</li>
    <li> I love the way this smells! Not really sure if does anything for my hair though! I have straight, healthy hair, so I don&#x27;t really need it do anything. It supposedly protects your hair from the heat of blow drying and straightening, so that&#x27;s a plus! My stylist gave me a sample and I love the smell so much I started using it regularly!</li>
    <li> I love the way it makes my hair smell.</li>
    <li> Same as original Unique 1 but smells very good...that is if you like coconut.  Leaves my hair soft and very manageable.</li>
    <li> Awesome haircare, fast shipper!</li>
    <li> I LOVE this stuff!  I have always used the red bottle, saw this and had to try it.  It smells GREAT and the smell does not last after you dry your hair.</li>
    <li> I have super thick hair and use a ton of conditioner!  I love Uniqone--not only its conditioning properties but the smell too!</li>
    <li> LOVE THE SMELL AND HOW IT MAKES MY HAIR FEEL</li>
    <li> Love this. I bought it because my stylist used it on my hair and I liked it. It has made my hair feel thicker and I loose less hair on a daily basis. (This item was purchased and reviewed by my wife)</li>
    <li> This is the second time I have purchased UniqONE and I just love this product. I love how it makes my hair smell, gives it so much shine, and easily untangles my curls. I cannot recommend this product enough to people with curly hair.</li>
    <li> Great stuff. My daughter has extremely curly blone enthnic looking hair and I spray this on it every morning after her bath and it is a great detangler. The brush or comb glides right through. It also eliminates the need for other products I would normally need to use in her hair to tame it like a hair serum or conditioner. This is like a miracle in a bottle. I also use it in my hair which is heavily colored. It keeps it soft and conditioned plus I love the delicious coconut smell.</li>
    <li> arrive on time and in good condition , I&#x27;m glad I made a good deal</li>
    <li> They use this at my hair salon.....it helps smooth my hair and it has a nice light coconut sent! I would definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> My new favorite hair product. It has really helped undo and prevent the damage that has been done to my hair. LOVE IT!</li>
    <li> My favorite hair treatment. This is the only product I use now!</li>
    <li> Used previously - good product</li>
    <li> Great product.  I just like the smell of the Original better, and I&#x27;m usually a huge fan of coconut smells, in general.  Just wish this was a little stronger.</li>
    <li> Smell delicious if you like me,  adore the coconut scent&lt;br /&gt;I put the product in my hands and all over the hair like a mouse&lt;br /&gt;the hair feel soft after use it</li>
    <li> This stuff is AMAZING!!!</li>
    <li> Love the way this one smells compared to the original one!</li>
    <li> All ok... But the boxes came without the plastic protection.... Except this all ok!!!</li>
    <li> I love how this product feels on my hair and how it also holds the style.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been a long-time &amp;#34;original&amp;#34; Uniq One user since first discovering this product at my hair salon, so I was very excited when the Coco version came out recently. While the new coconut scent is amazing, I personally don&#x27;t think it works quite as well as the original in the red bottle. I&#x27;m giving this product 4-stars, but I would give the original formula 5-stars. Still, an absolutely wonderful detangler for wet hair. Recommended!</li>
    <li> Leaves your hair soft!</li>
    <li> Leaves your hair soft and shiny without being greasy.</li>
    <li> Super nice fragrance.......grat for the hair as  the original</li>
