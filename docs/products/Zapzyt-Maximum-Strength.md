      <li>so MAYBE my problem isn&#x27;t debris clogging the pores, maybe its my bacteria laden hands all over my face (&#x27;cause I love touching perfection).</li>
      <li>This has been my safe zone for......years and years.</li>

      <li>Great product, highly recommend it.</li>
      <li>Like everything we have tried, this stuff works great in the beginning, but the amazing thing, is, it also, keeps on working years later.</li>
      <li>It is light and has no oder.  </li>
      <li>If I have anything important to add, I will.</li>
      <li>This stuff was cheap</li>
      <li>clean using neutrogena natural purifying cleanser, then zapzyt, then a good noncomedonegenic lotion.</li>
      <li>I think it&#x27;s definitely worth the trade!</li>
      <li>I also have the Zapzyt facial scrub and it smells nice and feels refreshing</li>
      <li>It is a bit drying, but with plenty of lotion, I&#x27;ve been able to keep it from being too much so.</li>
      <li>I got my friends to begin using it and my husband who all thought I had natural great clear skin.</li>
      <li>My skin is very sensitive, having reactions to most cosmetics and cleansers, but not this.  </li>
      <li>wonderful product, really works to dry out acne and its a clear formula (you can&#x27;t see it on the skin)</li>
      <li>has been trying one product after another with zero success.</li>
      <li>Gets the job done as expected at a good price.</li>
      <li>Been to dermatologist tried so many different cremes, ointments, antibiotics, eating right, drinking right, no sweets, no dairy, been there done it over and over and then again.</li>
      <li>Effective to dry up blemishes.</li>
      <li>The use of the scrub first, then the Zapzyt, then the moisturizer has kept me pretty much acne free and less oily better than the Neutrogena line they used to have &amp;#34;customized&amp;#34; to you (for $50 a month!)</li>
      <li>but I really wanted to give it the praise it deserves!</li>
      <li>You can see the difference in appearance after the first use.  </li>
      <li>Probably got 5,000.00 or more in different products for acne (prescriptions from dermatologists, Pro Activ, etc.).</li>
      <li>After one week, most of my acne is healing up and no longer red and swollen!</li>
      <li>Noticed a difference on the FIRST night</li>
      <li>Just make sure to use it every other day in the first few weeks with a great moisturizer.</li>
      <li>In a matter of hours I basically got a 1st degree burn that caused the skin surrounding the zit to turn bright red and then flake off for the next three days.</li>
      <li>Not to mention it shiped fast and is pretty</li>
      <li>really works...but will discolor your sheets if it gets on them.</li>
      <li>Couldn&#x27;t ask for more than is expected.</li>
      <li>it helped me with very stubborn acne and acne sports. .</li>
      <li>so I think it&#x27;s been working really well.</li>
      <li>and I would apply Oxy brand benzoyl peroxide with absolutely zero results.</li>
      <li>My skin is so sensitive and this is very gentle.</li>
      <li>In fact, a particular cyst keeps on recurring</li>
      <li>Tried everything, nothing seemed to help the main problem areas on my chin, jaw and forehead.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve had mild acne since the fifth grade and my entire life</li>
      <li>Highly recommend.</li>
      <li>My skin is very oily, and this helped to eliminate it as well as keep my skin clear.</li>
      <li>I had acne on my buttocks and this stuff shrank it and prevented new breakouts from forming.  </li>
      <li>Live and learn, baby.</li>
      <li>really does dry out the entire area which is why I make sure to only apply it to the blemish.</li>
      <li>It dries out my acne really fast, So you kind of have to be careful using it everyday.</li>
      <li>No, a few days without this stuff and forget it!</li>
      <li>and I haven&#x27;t developed any new acne.</li>
      <li>It took some time for my face to clear up</li>
      <li>I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product to people that have sensitive skin though.  </li>
      <li>Just DO NOT GET IT NEAR YOUR EYES AND GO TO BED.</li>
      <li>I have adult onset acne.</li>
      <li>It clearly says do not get near or in eyes.</li>
      <li>and I have noticed considerable improvement in existing acne</li>
      <li>but it clears it up completely and keeps it clear.</li>
      <li>This is a reasonably priced acne spot treatment that actually works!  </li>
      <li>This is a terrific low cost solution which is worth every penny.</li>
      <li>I would much rather dry skin over a blemish any day!</li>
      <li>and I will gratefully return to my old standby, Kiehl&#x27;s blue herbal spot treatment.</li>
      <li>so I decided to try this award-winning facial gel to see what would happen, despite knowing that I have epically sensitive skin from birth.</li>
      <li>(use it only on the acne - not your whole face because it will really dry it out) and wear it under make-up or without make-up.</li>
      <li>It has also somehow made my very oily face less oily in general, and it can be worn under makeup.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s not harsh or leaving my skin dry.</li>
      <li>works very well, results in less than two days</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> GREAT STUFF!!!  Can&#x27;t find this in the regular drug store</li>
    <li> So after seeing SabsBeauty on YouTube use this product, I purchased it on Amazon for about $5 and have been using it 1x a day ever since along with St. Ive&#x27;s Green Tea scrub and Olay&#x27;s B12 Clarity Cream. The use of the scrub first, then the Zapzyt, then the moisturizer has kept me pretty much acne free and less oily better than the Neutrogena line they used to have &amp;#34;customized&amp;#34; to you (for $50 a month!) ever did. My skin is very oily, and this helped to eliminate it as well as keep my skin clear.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried every single product out there, including prescriptions from my doctor (Benzaclin, Benzamycin, etc.) I&#x27;ve had mild acne since the fifth grade and my entire life has been trying one product after another with zero success. I&#x27;ve tried the pads, gels, scrubs, masks, ProActiv, literally everything and nothing worked. This stuff was cheap so I figured I&#x27;d try it and I&#x27;m glad I did. It took some time for my face to clear up but it clears it up completely and keeps it clear. If you have sensitive skin, you might want to follow up with a lotion afterwards or try to use less because it is a little drying. I also have the Zapzyt facial scrub and it smells nice and feels refreshing but it doesn&#x27;t work as well as this gel does. I definitely recommend everyone give this a try.</li>
    <li> Effective to dry up blemishes.</li>
    <li> Really good product. Gets the job done as expected at a good price. Couldn&#x27;t ask for more than is expected.</li>
    <li> Excellent cream.  My teenager uses it every day and it works so well.  It is light and has no oder.  I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product to people that have sensitive skin though.  I tried to use it and it made my skin get really red with a rash.  It is perfect for teenagers with some what oily skin and the start of pimples.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t get many blemishes on my face but when I do I turn to Zapzyt. I had never heard of this cream until my husband and I got together. Boy was I missing out all those years!&lt;br /&gt;A little goes a long way and this tube has lasted us both a couple of years. I typically apply it before I go to bed and by the time I wake up it had dried out the blemish and removed the swelling and redness.&lt;br /&gt;It really does dry out the entire area which is why I make sure to only apply it to the blemish. I would much rather dry skin over a blemish any day! My skin is only dry for a few hours after so I think it&#x27;s definitely worth the trade!</li>
    <li> My children and myself have acne flare ups. I guess it never ends no matter what age. Been to dermatologist tried so many different cremes, ointments, antibiotics, eating right, drinking right, no sweets, no dairy, been there done it over and over and then again. Probably got 5,000.00 or more in different products for acne (prescriptions from dermatologists, Pro Activ, etc.). Bought this in a hurry one time on my way out of town for any flare up surprise pimples. And I was soooooo glad to see how well it works. Like everything we have tried, this stuff works great in the beginning, but the amazing thing, is, it also, keeps on working years later. Just DO NOT GET IT NEAR YOUR EYES AND GO TO BED. I did, and had some irritation around my eyes, and my eyes kinda stung a little when I woke up. It clearly says do not get near or in eyes. It think I paid $6.00 bucks for a tube, which lasted a while, and my teenagers, like it better than ProActiv, and any of the expensive prescriptions that don&#x27;t work that the Dermatologist prescribed for acne.</li>
    <li> I have used everything imagineable and this works great. I used to use Panoxyl cream until they discontinued but this is identical.</li>
    <li> wonderful product, really works to dry out acne and its a clear formula (you can&#x27;t see it on the skin) so you can spot treat (use it only on the acne - not your whole face because it will really dry it out) and wear it under make-up or without make-up. No cover up needed.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried everything the dermatologist prescribed, but nothing works as well as this in my case.  This is a very good product.</li>
    <li> If I could tell every teenager to try this ZapZyt face wash and cream I WOULD (AM NOW). Just make sure to use it every other day in the first few weeks with a great moisturizer. I never had a problem, but friends of mine have. Forget those expensive face washes and &amp;#34;magical&amp;#34; creams. This has been my safe zone for......years and years. I got my friends to begin using it and my husband who all thought I had natural great clear skin. No, a few days without this stuff and forget it!</li>
    <li> I have adult onset acne. You know, because suffering through horrible back acne as a teenager wasn&#x27;t enough, my body felt that my face needs a little humility in my older years. I have seen a dermatologist, I tried prescription stuff, Benzaclin, Retin A.  I have spent $$$ at upscale stores for $$$ dream in a jar that never panned out. My face was slowly getting worse over time, bigger pores, more blackheads and the area was spreading from my t-zone onto my cheeks and neck. I recently caused extreme peeling and irritation on my face in my overzealous use of Salicylic acid so I needed something else. I had read that salicylic acid was used to remove dead skin that caused acne whereas benzoyl is used to killI bacteria in the pores. Hmm, I thought, my skin is oily and I DO have a bad habit of leaning my face into my hands (a lot) so MAYBE my problem isn&#x27;t debris clogging the pores, maybe its my bacteria laden hands all over my face (&#x27;cause I love touching perfection). Anyway, I was desperate and so on a whim I grabbed this. Lo and behold a few days later my blackheads are fading and a few are gone. It is a bit gritty but I feel like that scrubs it into the pores, also I haven&#x27;t noticed any white chalky residue like some other reviewers have mentioned about other benzoyl products. Meanwhile, I have had no issues with burning and since I use a good lotion after every application of Zapzyt I have not had any issues with dryness or flaking skin like I did with the salicylic acid. AND DID I MENTION IT IS CHEAP!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I clean using neutrogena natural purifying cleanser, then zapzyt, then a good noncomedonegenic lotion. Some nights I use reviva 10% gycolic acid lotion. It&#x27;s been a week and I am pleasantly pleased.</li>
    <li> This is a reasonably priced acne spot treatment that actually works!  My skin is very sensitive, having reactions to most cosmetics and cleansers, but not this.  As long as this product has dried you can apply  makeup and sunscreen over it, so that you can fight that annoying zit all day.  I typically spot treat at night, and by the time I wake up the zit has either dried up or become reduced and is no longer painful.  This is a terrific low cost solution which is worth every penny.</li>
    <li> Best OTC product out there wish it was readly available all the time</li>
    <li> Item as described. This is yge last place i looked for this itrm cause in my country it doesn&#x27;t ship. Very happy.</li>
    <li> This cream helped bring my cystic acne down in one day but it left a dark mark on each spot. My skin was very dry after use and left me with ugly scars.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried other over the counter products and nothing compares to this. works very well, results in less than two days and I wouldn&#x27;t try anything else. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m amazed at how well this stuff works! I&#x27;m 20 years old, never had an issue with acne or breakouts while a teen, but suddenly a switch flipped and my face was breaking out like crazy! Tried everything, nothing seemed to help the main problem areas on my chin, jaw and forehead. Saw this in store for about $4, figured I&#x27;d give it a try. So glad I did! Noticed a difference on the FIRST night I used it! One warning though, DO NOT get it on your eyelids! I did this by mistake and my eyes swelled up! It is a bit drying, but with plenty of lotion, I&#x27;ve been able to keep it from being too much so. After one week, most of my acne is healing up and no longer red and swollen! It also has cleared up the blackheads on my nose that I&#x27;ve had most of my life!</li>
    <li> Strongest product I used, just have something incase there is skin discolor from vanishing pimple. Use only if skin other products don&#x27;t work.</li>
    <li> I had a cyst on the side of my face that lingered around for two weeks, every night I had to drain it and I would apply Oxy brand benzoyl peroxide with absolutely zero results. I went out and bought zapzyt, applied it, and it&#x27;s already beginning to go away within 24 hours.</li>
    <li> Unfortunately, I still get the occasional, ahem, pimple. In fact, a particular cyst keeps on recurring so I decided to try this award-winning facial gel to see what would happen, despite knowing that I have epically sensitive skin from birth. Not smart.  In a matter of hours I basically got a 1st degree burn that caused the skin surrounding the zit to turn bright red and then flake off for the next three days. So, I basically got a chemical burn and the zit remained...nice! If I could give this product zero stars I would and I will gratefully return to my old standby, Kiehl&#x27;s blue herbal spot treatment. Live and learn, baby.</li>
    <li> This product changed my sons life, we tried lot of product prescribed by my dermatologist none worked. With this product we started to see improvement on the next day. I&#x27;m so happy we found it. If you&#x27;re child has severe acne this is the product to get.</li>
    <li> Works great been using it for about 3 years now</li>
    <li> A good product, a good seller, a good price. Sorry for the abbreviated review, but it annoys me that Amazon compels reviews to be so long. If I have anything important to add, I will. Otherwise, it’s hard to expand on the virtues of a USB cable, paper towels or socks.</li>
    <li> This is the best Acne treatment gel I have ever found. Nothing works like Zapzyt, I would recommend it to anyone who has acne trouble. It&#x27;s a life saver.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only been using it for a week and I have noticed considerable improvement in existing acne and I haven&#x27;t developed any new acne. It has also somehow made my very oily face less oily in general, and it can be worn under makeup. It made my skin a bit dry where I used it a lot but nothing bad. Best acne product I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
    <li> really works...but will discolor your sheets if it gets on them. pillowcases....my son has ruined 3 sets of pillow cases&lt;br /&gt;it has a bleaching agent in it...ruins towel too, he wiped his face on.</li>
    <li> You can see the difference in appearance after the first use.  The ripe acne will take longer to heal.  I had acne on my buttocks and this stuff shrank it and prevented new breakouts from forming.  The only thing is, you should wear white underwear or it will bleach and ruin your clothiers.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. It dries out my acne really fast, So you kind of have to be careful using it everyday. It&#x27;ll dry out your skin. I use it on really big ones and it definitely brings down the swelling. If i use it a few times a day, it&#x27;s usually gone within a few days.</li>
    <li> this is the best on the market!</li>
    <li> I have been using ZapZyt for years now! It is the only thing that has ever helped my acne. I get it at my local store but I really wanted to give it the praise it deserves! My skin is so sensitive and this is very gentle. I recommend it :)</li>
    <li> I like this cream it&#x27;s not harsh or leaving my skin dry. It looks like it has been working alright, I have always had acne so there is never a day without something but I have seen that there are a bit less and they&#x27;re are smaller so I think it&#x27;s been working really well. Not to mention it shiped fast and is pretty inexpensive.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll be ordering this product again.</li>
    <li> Awesome...&lt;br /&gt;ok so this is an update for my previous review ..&lt;br /&gt;this is the best product ever..it helped me with very stubborn acne and acne sports. . I almost never have breakouts. . Very few on my period. .which goes away after I use this product. .&lt;br /&gt;p.s. I use this every night..and I use moisturizer and sun screen in the mornings. .&lt;br /&gt;:) I&#x27;m happy with this product. .buy it!&lt;br /&gt;I still have 2 pack... they really last long..</li>

    <li> Great product, it works great and doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin, I use it on my chin and haven&#x27;t broke out in months. Great product, highly recommend it.</li>
