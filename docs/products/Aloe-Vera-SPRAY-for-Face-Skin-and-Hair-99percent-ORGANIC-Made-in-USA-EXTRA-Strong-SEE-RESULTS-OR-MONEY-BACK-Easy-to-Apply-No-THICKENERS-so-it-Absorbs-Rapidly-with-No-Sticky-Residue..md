<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Great value for organic skin moisturizer. They sent me a coupon for this and i would buy it without. Seems to be a really unique and quality aloe product.</li>
    <li> I use this spray exclusively in my hair. I love that is 99% Pure, and I like to spray it in my hair as is. My hair is left feeling moisturized and healthy. I even it add it to my leave in before blow drying. I only am giving it for stars because of the smell. Idk it smells natural, it&#x27;s just I personally don&#x27;t like it. However my fiance says my hair smells just fine after using it. Other than that though, it&#x27;s a top notch product. And a he&#x27;ll of a lot easier  to use than using the actual aloe leaf pulp that you&#x27;ve scraped out yourself!&lt;br /&gt;I received this product at a discounted price in exchange for an honest review</li>
    <li> Living in FL getting a little too much sun happens; I keep this in the fridge for such situations and it is cool to the skin when applied and helps take the ouch out of a sunburn.</li>
    <li> This is product is phenomenal!  Having the spray is quite convenient for those harder to reach spots, but have the gel too which was equally amazing.  I have shared this with a friend who has a very serious skin condition in which absolutely nothing else has helped. The soothing and healing qualities have been nothing short of miraculous and results were immediate for myself as well!  This worked wonders and completely eradicated a very serious irritation to the skin. I&#x27;m so thankful this product was shipped incredibly fast and without an expedited shipping request.  This is a superior bottled aloe product that is incomparable to any other brand on the market in my opinion, and I truly hope it will always be available.  It has been a God send, and feeling really lucky to have had this aloe!  Thank you so much Seven Minerals for supplying such quality products and for being such a wonderful company to do business with!  I will be ordering this again and again!</li>
    <li> A huge relief for sunburns and kitchen burns. Spray it on and the burning sensation turns nice and cool.</li>
    <li> Super light. I&#x27;m very glad I found this aloe spray. My body soaks in this spray. Besides being practically all organic, the product isn&#x27;t tested on animals. I&#x27;ll definitely buy this again. I&#x27;ve been using it all over my body (except my face) and have been watching one scar in particular. If the scars dismishes in the next few weeks, I&#x27;ll post a picture under this review.</li>
    <li> product smells nice, goes on easy and is dry almost right away. It can be used for many things, aftershave, sunburn, skin conditioner and is 99% organic</li>
    <li> Aloe Vera Skin &amp; Body SPRAY - 99% Organic...Seven Minerals....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product Description&lt;br /&gt;Seven Minerals Aloe Vera Skin and Body Spray is an excellent daily moisturizer for entire body. It softens and revitalizes chapped, sun-exposed, moisture deprived skin while helping normal skin retain moisture. Aloe Vera has the ability to protect and heal epithelial tissue, which is a layer of cells in the skin covering the body. It also helps stimulate fibroblasts, the skin cells responsible for wound healing and the manufacture of collagen. By reducing inflammation and stimulating new cells, it allows wounds to heal quickly while minimizing scarring. Aloe also has natural antibacterial and antifungal qualities. WHY IS IT A LIQUID UNLIKE A REGULAR GEL? To create an Aloe Vera Gel one should add artificial thickeners. It is possible, but there is no need. Did you know that the skin absorbs Aloe Vera four times faster than water? Any thickener would make the skin absorption process slower. In addition to being more natural, the liquid consistency gives the advantage of using the sprayer - you can cover your skin more evenly and reach the places that were hard to reach before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;pro&#x27;s of product:&lt;br /&gt;FASTER RESULTS - Our Extra Strong Formula of USA-grown Organic Aloe Vera will deliver faster results than regular Aloe Vera gels.&lt;br /&gt;ABSORBS RAPIDLY - Our Aloe Vera Spray does not leave a layer of an artificial thickener on your skin - it absorbs rapidly, leaving your skin smooth and silky.&lt;br /&gt;EASY TO APPLY - Spreads thoroughly. Very convenient and easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;The product is well blended, odor-free, and absorbs very quickly, leaving absolutely no oily residue. It is %99 organic and convenient and easy to use having a spray. It works great on sunburns; dry/itchy skin, minor scrapes and burns, bites, as a moisturizer, and so much more. A must have in any home.  I use on my 3 year old grandson who has dry itchy skin and it stops him from scratching the blood out of his little legs.  I also use on my dry itchy skin and the spots go away when I apply to my skin after a shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Important Information:&lt;br /&gt;Ingredients:&lt;br /&gt;Certified Organic Aloe Vera (99.75%), Citric acid (to stabilize pH), Ascorbic acid (Vitamin C), Potassium sorbate (to prevent mold).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Directions:&lt;br /&gt;Apply directly to the skin and let it air dry for best results. Use it for healthier skin, hair, sun burns and also as an aftershave. It can be added to massage oils, daily facial care products, shampoos and hair conditioners. Regular use soothes the skin leaving it soft and supple with a healthy glow ★ Does not require refrigeration ★ Caution: For external use only. Keep out of reach of children. Avoid contact with eyes. If irritation, redness or discomfort occurs, discontinue use.&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure: Product was provided for review, thank youout of his little legs.

    <li> I am so glad I got this product. I spent a little too much time in the sun last weekend and ended up with a sunburn. This really eased the pain of the burn and was so much easier to put on than regular aloe vera. Spray, rub in, and done. Of course, even with aloe vera gel, I could still slightly feel the burn, however, this greatly reduced the pain and I can tell it definitely helped the healing process. Four days later and I look like I have a nice tan - not peeling, like I usually would, after the sunburn. The bottle is large and I haven&#x27;t had any issues with the sprayer clogging. I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s going to last a very long time. Highly Recommended!</li>
    <li> My skin loves this Aloe Vera, it leaves my skin soft and moisturized. As well, it protects my skin from the sun. It is very lightweight and doesn&#x27;t leave any residue. This works very well for dry skin, sunburn and aftershave. I am using it a lot in this summer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product at a discounted rate in exchange for my unbiased review.</li>
    <li> Love it! Helps keep my skin hydrated. I applied the seven minerals Aloe Vera Spray before using my home made 6/6 butter/oil hair and body butter blend. My skin feels like heaven. Super soft with a healthy glow. I also love the spray nozzle. It applies a nice mist onto the skin so I&#x27;m not waisting all that precious aloe. I will definitely be purchasing this item again and again and again. This time I purchased this item at a reduced price for my unbiased opinion.</li>
    <li> My husband got sunburned because he forgot to put his suncreen last fourth of July weekend on the beach.&lt;br /&gt;We are used to using an aloe gel from CVS to treat any sunburns or just to apply it as an extra protection after sometime under the sun.&lt;br /&gt;We love aloe vera and we are faithful believers of this plant, that why we purchase this spray, it is made of 99% aloe vera in spray version.&lt;br /&gt;I have researched that the gel formula actually makes the absorption slower because of the added thickeners.&lt;br /&gt;Unlike the gel, the spray is absolutely and straightforward. You get only the goodness of aloe vera.&lt;br /&gt;My husband liked it so much and he said it saved him from any unnecessary rubbing of the skin. since all he had to do is spray it.&lt;br /&gt;It has a hint of aloe scent that makes it more refreshing. The skin absorbs it way faster than the gel formula.&lt;br /&gt;My husband&#x27;s skin is healing very well and rapidly thanks to this product. We love it and we will repurchase when we ran out.&lt;br /&gt;This is very useful especially it&#x27;s summer time, our skin should get all the help.&lt;br /&gt;I used a promo code to purchase this product for testing</li>
    <li> *** I paid full price for this, and apparently no one else did **** lol&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ive been using the &#x27;Fruit of the Earth Aloe Vera&#x27; for the past year-ish and wanted to find an organic alternative. This was by far the best ingredients and price, but i find myself still reaching for the Fruit of the Earth one instead... it heals my skin/ acne OVERNIGHT.&lt;br /&gt;This just doesn&#x27;t do much for my skin, which is weird since is suppose to be straight aloe vera?? I honestly just feel like im spraying water on my face. It didn&#x27;t even do anything for my sunburn. And yes i reapply it etc.</li>
    <li> I love this aloe very spray. This helps me keep my skin moisturized and the spray nozzle makes it easy to apply. I&#x27;ve been using this every day after a shower and has kept my skin soft throughout the day. The spray has no scent so it&#x27;s perfect when I put perfume on. This spray also comes in a pretty big bottle and seems like it&#x27;ll last me at least a couple of months since I use it every day. Overall I&#x27;m happy with the way it makes my skin feel. Definitely a great alternative to coconut oil and lotion. This would definitely be great for anyone that has itchy/dry skin or sunburned skin. I will definitely buy more of this when it runs out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have received this product at a promotional price for product review purposes.

    <li> My 4 year old daughter recently burned herself on my hot curling iron. I ran and grabbed this aloe vera skin spray by Seven Minerals and immediately sprayed as much as I could on her palm and fingers. Not only did it stop the burn from further damaging her skin, but it helped relieve the pain. Instead of a nasty 3rd degree burn, she had a minor 1st degree thanks to the aloe. I continued to use the aloe spray for the next couple of days on her hand and it has healed beautifully. I&#x27;m thankful, and so is my daughter, that the spray works for more than just sunburn.</li>
    <li> My husband works outside all day and even though he puts sun block he sometimes gets burned... he loves this stuff because he can just spray it on there and it instantly feels better... i love this stuff and will keep repurchasing...</li>
    <li> I was able to get this product at an amazing discount with amz review trader.. It works awesome!! have used it on my hair and my skin. I get lots of bug bites even being outside for a few minutes and this worked amazing on the bites and also on my son&#x27;s dry skin.</li>
    <li> Love this Aloe Vera Skin and Body Spray. I really love that it is 99% organic. The aloe vera quickly absorbs into my skin and is not greasy. I love that it is lightweight, feels like spraying water, but makes my skin feel so soft. I have never been a big fan of gels, too thick and messy. Aloe Vera contains many vitamins  and minerals that are excellent for the skin. Also aloe vera produces at least six natural antiseptics, which are able to kill mold, bacteria, fungus, and viruses. I keep mine in the fridge so I can get a refreshing mist after being outside in the sun.  After doing some research, I see that it is also safe to spray on my dogs. Aloe Vera spray can be used to treat certain skin conditions in dogs. It helps with itching. It can be rubbed on wounds to promote healing. I am really happy I had an opportunity to try this at a reduced price for an honest review. This has become my favorite new product. I recently ordered 3 more bottles. Love it!! Thanks Seven Minerals for having such an awesome product.</li>
    <li> This is an aloe vera spray but it seems more like water.  It does feel refreshing when spraying it on my skin so I like that.  It will feel nice on a sunburn but I&#x27;m not sure it will actually help a sunburn like aloe vera normally does.</li>
    <li> I use aloe vera juice on my hair.  I am not an expert on aloe vera but this works just as well as any other aloe vera juice I have used.  Slightly nervous about it bc it doesn&#x27;t have to be refrigerated.  The good thing about it not needing to be refrigerated is that I can keep it in the restroom with my hair products.  I will be changing the bottle to a regular spray bottle because the pump is a little tough to pump.  I received a discount for my honest review.</li>
    <li> This is really nice, you just spray it on and it disappears into your skin without any greasy residue. It seems to work well at excellerating healing, and makes a great conditioning spray for your face too.</li>
    <li> i love the feel of aloe vera on the skin specially right after being exposed to the sun so purchasing this aloe vera skin and body spray at a fraction of the cost is a treat for me.  aloe vera really helps the skin recover from sun damage and this product being in liquid form assures me that my skin is absorbing it fast and well.  i am impressed that bottle sprays on well and delivers an even mist.  i have discarded the gel form i have and is now enjoying the benefits of aloe vera on my body as well as my face.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love Aloe Vera but I had never known that a spray form was available until I saw this Aloe Vera Skin &amp; Body Spray! After finding out that there actually is a spray form I just HAD to have this in my house! My back is very prone to getting sunburned and I can&#x27;t tell you how many times I&#x27;ve needed Aloe Vera applied to my back but had no one home to help me apply it so this spray form will definitely come in handy for when I need Aloe Vera on my back with no one around to help since this spray will reach hard to reach areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Aloe Vera Skin &amp; Body Spray doesn&#x27;t have an overly powering smell but I can smell a hint of the Aloe Vera which I really enjoy personally. This spray also absorbs very quickly and without leaving and residue or making your skin sticky. I&#x27;m a huge believer in Aloe Vera and now I&#x27;m a even bigger believer in the Aloe Vera Skin &amp; Body Spray! I would HIGHLY recommend!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**I received a discount on this product for testing and reviewing purposes and this is my honest and unbiased opinion**</li>
    <li> I have always used the gel form of aloe Vera for burns, sunburns etc. When I came across this spray form, I had to try it out. I LOVE it. It sprays right on, right where you need it. It absorbs quickly and effectively into the skin. There is no stickiness and NO STICKY GREASY HANDS afterwards. It helps put moisture back in that sunburnt skin and definitely helps soothe it. It helps heal the skin quicker than any other method I&#x27;ve tried for sunburn and burns. This spray doesn&#x27;t require refrigeration. And it doesn&#x27;t leave that sticky funky layer/ feeling on your skin.</li>
    <li> I purchased this liquid aloe for use in blending all natural facial products. Having no thickeners, it blends wonderfully with rose water and essential oils to create witch hazel free natural toners and cleansers. It even makes for a wonderful redness reducing toner all by itself! This is great for anyone looking for remedies for acne and other skin complaints.</li>
    <li> This product works so great  with my natural hair. I am black and I highly suggest it to those natural  ladies out there.</li>
