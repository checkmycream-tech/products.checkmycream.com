      <li>Very good stuff, I love it.</li>
      <li>Smells good</li>
      <li>A good value for the price.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Still, it was really good.  </li>
      <li>I shampooed once and it felt good</li>
      <li>It smElle nutty, sweet and so delicious I like to just smiss the soap</li>
      <li>The scent is great and the ingredients are much better for your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Works great, good smell, rinses easily.</li>
      <li>The first time i was impressed with the product.</li>
      <li>That said, I love the scent!</li>
      <li>have commented that they liked it as well.  </li>
      <li>(Amusingly, however, \\&quot;spinich poweder\\&quot; (sic) is in Amazon&#x27;s ingredient list for this product (at this writing), but the label on the soap I got says cinnamon powder instead of \\&quot;spinich\\&quot;).  </li>
      <li>Well the title says it all, but I&#x27;ll add that this soap has a very slippery texture which makes it perfect for shaving with.</li>
      <li>Smells great and it gets your hair clean.</li>
      <li>This particular shampoo bar has a wonderful fragrance that I quite like.</li>
      <li>I first read about this product on a shaving-related blog, and loved the idea of a manly, old-fashioned shampoo bar with a great scent.</li>
      <li>This shampoo bar is really good as a shampoo but make note that it is strongly scented of bay rum and ginger (I think)</li>
      <li>The fragrance is a very strong pumpkin/cinnamon and though this may be what some think of when they are looking for a Bay Rum.  </li>
      <li>It smells very strong of cinnamon.</li>
      <li>Wow, this stuff is great!  </li>
      <li>, I shampooed again, just to make sure my hair was good and clean and also washed my face.</li>
      <li>It smells nice, but did not work for my fine hair.</li>
      <li>I love this soap.</li>
      <li>You may have better luck.</li>
      <li>So I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect.</li>
      <li>Seems more like someone was shooting for pumpkin spice and decided Bay Rum would be a better sell</li>
      <li>It lathered up really well and had a great scent.</li>
      <li>I absolutely love it and used it again tonight in the shower.  </li>
      <li>i love it</li>
      <li>cause it&#x27;s now my favorite shampoo.</li>
      <li>Now, I love the bay rum smell (it also reminds me a lot of brown windsor soap, which I also love), but if I use too much of this shampoo I feel like I&#x27;m walking around in a bay rum cloud (and not the good kind) for the rest of the morning.</li>
      <li>i love that is has no chemicals</li>
      <li>LOVE</li>
      <li>Love, it i will buy again and again.</li>
      <li>Sounded completely interesting, and for under 10 bucks....</li>
      <li>For that, I love this bar.</li>
      <li>Love that is is handcrafted in the USA.</li>
      <li>I LOVE these bars!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>is the deal, I actually love this.  </li>
      <li>and I love the scent of Bay Rum.</li>
      <li>Lathers well and leaves hair very clean without over drying.</li>
      <li>Instead of a long review let me just say that I am impressed with this shampoo.</li>
      <li>I really wanted a good Bay Rum aroma, but this smells overwhelmingly like Cinnamon.</li>
      <li>This smells delicious and leaves the hair with such a clean, un-grimy texture.</li>
      <li>but if your looking for a fairly strong bay rum smell</li>
      <li>The scent on the first batch was strong which I liked.</li>
      <li>To me it smells more gingerbread-y and like a pumpkin spice latte than true bay rum.</li>
      <li>Lathers great, leaves hair feeling clean and soft.  </li>
      <li>Feels great on the scalp, wonderful mannish scent (not too strong), rinses out completely, and leaves hair soft &amp; shiny -- not dry.  </li>
      <li>If Taconic can&#x27;t even get the product to match the name (\\&quot;Bay Rum\\&quot;), or the ingredient list to be accurate, I don&#x27;t know that I would ever want to risk buying anything from them</li>
      <li>Be perfect for the gym bag in place of messy bottles of shampoo.</li>
      <li>Rinses easily and leaves hair and scalp squeaky clean.</li>
      <li>Leaves hair clean and easy to comb.</li>
      <li>A bonus is that the bathroom it also lightly scented as well.</li>
      <li>and it smells fantastic.</li>
      <li>I also recommend using it lightly:</li>
      <li>Terrific smell, great lather.  </li>
      <li>I gave 3 stars because it smells nice and seems to use quality, responsible ingredients.</li>
      <li>, It has a light, clean smell with a hint of Bay Rum.</li>
      <li>With a bar shampoo, once you figure out how many passes over your hair you require to do the job, there is always a consistent amount of product used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It just feels naturally clean.</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t expect this to be a cologne, just to give me clean hair</li>
      <li>hair has not felt this clean in years.</li>
      <li>It does lather up well and rinses clean with no oily residue.  </li>
      <li>Not as chemically treated, but maybe just ... clean?</li>
      <li>Leaves my hair feeling fuller and squeaky clean.  </li>
      <li>If the scent was more of Bay Rum and not so much cinnamon</li>
      <li>It lathers quickly</li>
      <li>Great scent, but it does wear down quickly...</li>
      <li>good strong fragrance, to a typical but quick melting glycerin soap</li>
      <li>Bay Rum is by far my favorite scent for my shaving soaps and aftershaves, so I was excited to try this one.</li>
      <li>And this along with their Bay Rum shaving cream from Taconic are two of my favorite finds so far!  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m pretty excited with the quality of this shampoo.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I only got this two day ago and have fallen in love with it. Following the included instructions I did indeed cut the bar in half so it will last longer. I also keep the half I am using in a wire soap rack so it can drain and dry between each use. I have a lot of hair so it usually takes more than one or swipes about my head to get it to really lather up but lather it does. Smells wonderful, feels refreshing and leaves my hair looking great. ~Dave</li>
    <li> This smells great, create a thick lather quickly and leaves my hair soft and controlled. I plan using this as long as it is available.</li>
    <li> Just tried this Taconic Shave Bay Rum Shampoo Bar for the first time this morning.  I absolutely love it and used it again tonight in the shower.  It lathers quickly and I can tell this is going to last a long time, because a little goes a long ways.  I cut the bar in two pieces, as recommended in the instructions that came with the bar, to make it last longer.  I will definitely buy this again and I would recommend this to anyone. Leaves my hair feeling fuller and squeaky clean.  Did I say it had a great by rum scent?</li>
    <li> So I have been into this whole manventure into non standard self care products...actually, I&#x27;ve been feeling kind of down (- man points for admitting) so I have been trying out new ways to pamper myself, ya know, DE razors, brush shaving, old time skin care etc. and came across this shampoo.  Sounded completely interesting, and for under 10 bucks....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here is the deal, I actually love this.  I have been an American Crew guy for years now, and this has an interesting Clove and Orange scent, I guess they call that Bay Rum, but I&#x27;ve never smelled bay rum.  Lathers great, leaves hair feeling clean and soft.  Not that coated quick shampoo conditioner combo fake soft, like really soft, how hair should feel soft.  I cut little chunks off about a square inch at a time.  Last just as long as my 20.00 American Crew bottle, and I know what everything in this is.  Hope they keep making this, cause it&#x27;s now my favorite shampoo.</li>
    <li> I have very fine, thin hair.  This shampoo makes it feel soft and thicker without wrong it sow.  It smElle nutty, sweet and so delicious I like to just smiss the soap</li>
    <li> Great scent, but it does wear down quickly...</li>
    <li> Okay, the only possible downside for this soap is the scent--it smells strongly of cinnamon and not any bay rum I have smelled before. That said, I love the scent! I have never shampooed with soap before, so I was shocked at how clean my hair was after the first application--I mean very literally squeaky clean. I love this soap.</li>
    <li> Instead of a long review let me just say that I am impressed with this shampoo. I shampooed once and it felt good, I shampooed again, just to make sure my hair was good and clean and also washed my face. WOW is my impression, squeeky clean, hair and face. After drying my hair feels softer than I have ever felt it and my face feels great also. From the feel of it this could also be used as a shave soap. I will not be using any other shampoo. Edit: I just bought my second bar (apr 2016) and noticed a reduction in bar size, 5oz not the advertised 5.5oz. The bar is a good bit smaller but but still the the same fine product. It is disturbing that a product is falsely advertised even if it is agood product. Shame on Taconic</li>
    <li> Warning, don&#x27;t get in your eyes, and keep it away from kids. Got a very small amount in my right eye and it burnt like fire. Had to use saline eye flush for an hour before burn left. It should have a warning label. This morning my eye is still red, and considering talking with my lawyer on product liability issue.</li>
    <li> This is my first experience with a solid shampoo. So I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect. I like it. I cut a third of the bar as that would fit in my soap dish. It doesn&#x27;t take much to make more lather than you can possibly use. I just rub the bar once around my head and it lathers up big time. In two weeks of twice daily use I have used about half of the piece I cut, so about a sixth of the bar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not a bay rum expert. I use Col. Conks Bay Rum shave soap and it smells fantastic. This is not even close. It smells very strong of cinnamon. With that said it is a pleasant scent. Frankly as soon as I rinse it the smell is gone. I didn&#x27;t expect this to be a cologne, just to give me clean hair and it does that very well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How does it clean?&lt;br /&gt;My hair has not felt this clean in years. It is so soft and light. It just feels naturally clean. For that, I love this bar. I will continue using it for years to come.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping. ..this is one of the best soaps I have purchased.  Would recommend.</li>
    <li> great smell... my son loves this fragrance.... we try to keep plastic bottles and cans out of the ocean.... so this is shaving foam and body scrub and shampoo... we also supplement with J R Liggett&#x27;s Ultra Balanced&lt;br /&gt;Shampoo bar.</li>
    <li> Works great, good smell, rinses easily. Lasts a long time.  A good value for the price.  Easy to carry when traveling without worrying whether changes in air pressure will pop open the shampoo bottle, since it&#x27;s not a bottle at all--just a bar of shampoo soap.  If you like bay rum soap, shave cream, or after shave, this shampoo is great to add.</li>
    <li> This soap was not at all what I expected.  The fragrance is a very strong pumpkin/cinnamon and though this may be what some think of when they are looking for a Bay Rum.  I just don&#x27;t care for it and I would not recommend it to anyone else.</li>
    <li> Tried this product after using Taconic Shave Barbershop Quality Bay Rum Shave Soap with Antioxidant-rich Hemp Seed Oil.  I&#x27;m pretty excited with the quality of this shampoo.  Lathers up quick with only a couple of swipes of the bar on my wet hair.  Rinses easily and leaves hair and scalp squeaky clean.</li>
    <li> It smells nice, but did not work for my fine hair. My hair immediately felt thick and waxy. I tried to give it a week or so to settle down, and ignored the instructions and tried applying a thin lather, and even tried a vinegar rinse. It just never worked out. My husband has coarse hair, so he&#x27;s going to give it a go.  I gave 3 stars because it smells nice and seems to use quality, responsible ingredients.</li>
    <li> Very good stuff, I love it. Smells great and it gets your hair clean. And yes for the love of god don&#x27;t get suds in your eyes, I haven&#x27;t but come on anything other than baby shampoo burns like living hell.</li>
    <li> Well the title says it all, but I&#x27;ll add that this soap has a very slippery texture which makes it perfect for shaving with.</li>
    <li> ^&lt;br /&gt;This is a wonderful product. The scent is great and the ingredients are much better for your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No more waste as is common with bottle shampoo when you dump too much into your hand. With a bar shampoo, once you figure out how many passes over your hair you require to do the job, there is always a consistent amount of product used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the way to shampoo your hair.</li>
    <li> This stuff is awesome. Smells great. Lathers well and leaves hair very clean without over drying. Excellent bay rum scent.</li>
    <li> This shampoo bar in no way smells like Bay Rum. Not even close. I tried my very best to pick out a hint of bay and cannot find it in the scent. It does, however, smell so much like pumpkin spice that I don&#x27;t believe this was ever intended to be Bay Rum. Seems more like someone was shooting for pumpkin spice and decided Bay Rum would be a better sell so they just renamed it.&lt;br /&gt;I gave it 3 stars because I like the idea of solid shampoo bars and worked well. It left my hair clean and light. Just don&#x27;t expect Bay Rum. Plan on pumpkin spice that is heavy on the cinnamon.</li>
    <li> There was something about this soap that almost smelled a little like a cake or pastry.  No joke.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still, it was really good.  I was just left craving a bay rum muffin after showering,...</li>
    <li> I was really looking forward to the bay rum scent but was dissappointed.  There is no smell to this soap.  It does lather up well and rinses clean with no oily residue.  If it only had a scent I would order again.</li>
    <li> This is a great soap and it has a  wonderful feeling to wake up to every morning - I&#x27;d buy it again !</li>
    <li> I really wanted a good Bay Rum aroma, but this smells overwhelmingly like Cinnamon. There is very little in the aroma that reminds me of the family&#x27;s Bay Rum tree.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No wonder, the ingredients on the soap bar I received say:  \\&quot;water, saponified *safflower oil, saponified *coconut oil, saponified *castor oil, *cinnamon powder, and essential oil blend. *certified organic ingredient\\&quot;.  If there is any Bay Rum in the \\&quot;essential oil blend\\&quot;, there is not enough to perceive over the Cinnamon and other things in the \\&quot;blend\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cinnamon was not mentioned in the Amazon product listing ingredients, or else I would have been suspected that the product wouldn&#x27;t smell like Bay Rum. (Amusingly, however, \\&quot;spinich poweder\\&quot; (sic) is in Amazon&#x27;s ingredient list for this product (at this writing), but the label on the soap I got says cinnamon powder instead of \\&quot;spinich\\&quot;).  If Taconic can&#x27;t even get the product to match the name (\\&quot;Bay Rum\\&quot;), or the ingredient list to be accurate, I don&#x27;t know that I would ever want to risk buying anything from them again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ETA:  I see from looking at other reviews that the scenting of this product is very inconsistent.  You may have better luck.</li>
    <li> This shampoo bar is really good as a shampoo but make note that it is strongly scented of bay rum and ginger (I think) so your hair will carry the scent for quite a while. I like the scent and a couple folks have commented that they liked it as well.  A bonus is that the bathroom it also lightly scented as well. I&#x27;ll buy it again soon.</li>
    <li> Wow, this stuff is great!  Terrific smell, great lather.  Doesn&#x27;t take very much - I think I am using a lot more of the product than I need too because I haven&#x27;t quite figured out how much lather is going to result from just a little soap.  Love that is is handcrafted in the USA.</li>
    <li> The bay rum smell is great.  Does a great job on my hair.  Lasts a while due to me being a male with short hair, and cutting off portions to use instead of letting the whole bar be exposed to moisture and depleted quicker than needed.  I keep the slices that are in use in a soap dish that has a lid and also has a raised bottom with slits also in the bottom to allow drainage.  This has been very smart due to the shampoo bar being very soft and prone to &amp;#34;melting&amp;#34;.  I have not used even half of the bar, and it&#x27;s been two months since I started using it.  Very happy with this shampoo bar.</li>
    <li> I love using bar shampoos and especially love the Basin products.  Unfortunately Basin is getting harder and harder for me to come by so I thought I&#x27;d try a different brand.  While I love the fragrance and the overall look of this bar I found that it doesn&#x27;t rinse well out of my hair and my hair feels a little &amp;#34;coated&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;waxy&amp;#34; after I shampoo if I&#x27;m not extremely diligent about rinsing extra long.  I really have to pre-lather in my hands to wash with suds rather then using the bar directly on my hair which would never rinse out.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been on a Bay Rum buying frenzy.  And this along with their Bay Rum shaving cream from Taconic are two of my favorite finds so far!  Great smelling shampoo bar.  Followed the instructions and cut it in half.  It last a few months.  Longer then I expected.  I would recommend getting a soap dish that allows the water to drain off to maximize your bar.  Would purchase again.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t think I&#x27;d like a &amp;#34;shampoo bar&amp;#34;, but now I&#x27;m hooked, it&#x27;s all I use.  Leaves hair clean and easy to comb.</li>
    <li> Very good! I think my hair is growing back!</li>
    <li> First off this is my second purchase of this producr. The first time i was impressed with the product. It lathered up really well and had a great scent. That said I ordered 3 bars so i wouldn&#x27;t run out. The second purchase was so unimpressive that I&#x27;m contemplating sending the unopened packages back. The scent on the first batch was strong which I liked. The scent on the second was nonexistent, it smells like lanolin with absolutely no bay rum odor whatsoever. It seems almost like the person that was supposed to add the bay rum forgot. My suggestion is to stay away from this product until the company can get their quality control issues worked out. I realize with hand made items there will be variances but this is too much to be just differences in each batch.</li>
    <li> Wow where to start?? I bought this looking for a bay rum scented soap. The first issue is, it smells NOTHING like bay rum. It smells like a pumpkin pie with too much cinnamon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bar creates almost zero lather. I&#x27;m not sure how people wash their hair or their body with this. It feels rubbery against the skin, and it dissolves FAST. Even as I tried to work a lather up in my hands, I could feel it getting mushy.&lt;br /&gt;At $9 a bar? Yeah, no.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: After 3 showers, yes 3, the half bar I&#x27;ve been using (followed the recommendation to cut bar in half) has completely turned to a mushy pulpy mess and completely dissolved while using it. Dont waste your money.</li>
    <li> This works much like the shave soap bars. It lathers very well and cleans very well, too. The only reason I gave 4 instead of 5 stars was I don&#x27;t love the smell. It smells fine, just not what I expected compared to other bay rum shave products. I will definitely buy another shampoo bar by Taconic again. I&#x27;ll just try a different scent. Worth the money if you&#x27;re into this kinda thing.</li>
    <li> I was introduced to shampoo bars by a buddy of mine. I was a bit skeptical at first, but thought what the heck? Well, I&#x27;m hooked. I LOVE these bars!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have short, thick, hair. These little bars make a good, quick, full, fragrant lather. Bay Rum is by far my favorite scent for my shaving soaps and aftershaves, so I was excited to try this one. To me it smells more gingerbread-y and like a pumpkin spice latte than true bay rum. That&#x27;s the only reason I took off a star. I don&#x27;t even use conditioner anymore. My barber made the comment about how full and soft my hair is now. LOVE IT!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One downside, the bars don&#x27;t last very long. But I have cut the bars in half, and make sure you let them dry between uses and you&#x27;ll get longer life out of them!</li>
    <li> Smells good but if your looking for a fairly strong bay rum smell this IS NOT it, It has a light, clean smell with a hint of Bay Rum.</li>
    <li> ooh, I do Bay Rum and now I can use it in the shower. Thanks! And very good job!</li>
    <li> good strong fragrance, to a typical but quick melting glycerin soap</li>
    <li> Love, it i will buy again and again. Going to venture getting a different scent as well.</li>
    <li> This is the second shampoo bar I&#x27;ve purchased.  I&#x27;m a big advocate of chemical-free shampoo and conditioner bars.  And the results on my hair and scalp are much better than anything I&#x27;ve used previously.  This particular shampoo bar has a wonderful fragrance that I quite like.</li>
    <li> I first read about this product on a shaving-related blog, and loved the idea of a manly, old-fashioned shampoo bar with a great scent. The bay rum shampoo bar is exactly that. It works great and smells great too, but you should probably take a couple of precautions when you use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bar is very soft, for one thing. The label recommends cutting it in half and storing one piece away while using the other. You probably don&#x27;t want to leave it permanently in your shower where it can stay wet. I keep mine in a dedicated soap dish and let it dry outside the shower when I&#x27;m not using it. I also recommend using it lightly: I have short hair, and one orbit around my head gives me more than enough lather for hair and beard. Using much more than that introduces my main ... not so much complaint as alert ... about this shampoo bar. The blog I mentioned said the scent of this bar is \\&quot;quite mild,\\&quot; but I&#x27;ve found just the opposite. Now, I love the bay rum smell (it also reminds me a lot of brown windsor soap, which I also love), but if I use too much of this shampoo I feel like I&#x27;m walking around in a bay rum cloud (and not the good kind) for the rest of the morning. If I leave the bar sitting out, the bathroom starts to smell like a bay rum humidor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The main thing, though, is that this shampoo bar really does clean your hair. I&#x27;ve been using [[ASIN:B004C5S9DY Dove daily moisture shampoo]] for a long time, and after several weeks of using this shampoo bar my hair feels noticeably different. Not as chemically treated, but maybe just ... clean? Very possibly.</li>
    <li> I am 86.  This bar is great, and leaves my scalp thinking it&#x27;s about 56.  Easier to use than a squirty bottle.  Just rub it on and relax.</li>
    <li> Smells great but makes a bit of a mess in the shower. It is not water-hungry by any means and tends to get pretty runny. Doesn&#x27;t last as long due to this - the entire bar lasted perhaps two weeks for me. I&#x27;d buy again if it were cheaper.</li>
    <li> disappears so fast. i love it but it melts. even in the open metal grate, so it can dry, it still disappears. maybe someone else is using it and i am unaware. oh wait, no one else is using it. it&#x27;s just disappearing. i love that is has no chemicals though so it&#x27;s an even trade off almost. oh the people that whine it doesn&#x27;t smell like bay leaves blah blah blah. what a pointless argument. it smells awesome.</li>
    <li> It lathers perfectly, smells fantastic, rinses well and the little goes the long way! Highly recommended for the Bay Rum lovers!</li>
    <li> Great scent but don&#x27;t let water rest on it after use in shower….it will turn to mush.</li>
    <li> works great. a bit on the pricey side, but oh well. i cut it in thirds for use in the shower shampooing.</li>
    <li> I really liked the idea of a solid natural shampoo and I love the scent of Bay Rum. Unfortunately the bar I received smells overwhelmingly of cinnamon. It did lather very well and left the hair clean though. If the scent was more of Bay Rum and not so much cinnamon it would be excellent.</li>
    <li> Yes!  This is a GREAT shampoo bar.  Feels great on the scalp, wonderful mannish scent (not too strong), rinses out completely, and leaves hair soft &amp; shiny -- not dry.  Be perfect for the gym bag in place of messy bottles of shampoo.</li>
    <li> This smells delicious and leaves the hair with such a clean, un-grimy texture.</li>
