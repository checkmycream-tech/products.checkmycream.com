### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>After about an hour, my curiosity got the best of me</li>
      <li>I am happy to find a product that works for me!</li>
      <li>Excellent breath mint..</li>
      <li>/&gt;Overall, I&#x27;d say these are a great item!</li>
      <li>Best mints you can buy.&lt;br /&gt;Just</li>
      <li>Of all the mints I&#x27;ve tried, I like these best.</li>
      <li>and I wanted a couple for gifts (Awesome Wedding gift if you think about it)</li>
      <li>Incredibly grateful for this product</li>
      <li>These mints are incredible.  </li>
      <li>LOL)</li>
      <li>They just don&#x27;t taste that great...</li>
      <li>Works great.</li>
      <li>Excellent product, love them.</li>
      <li>Absolutely awesome and SO MUCH better than nicotine.</li>
      <li>This is good when you are dealing with clients.  </li>
      <li>My boss purchased some forever mint for everyone in the office and they are amazing.</li>
      <li>They are amazing.</li>
      <li>makes it very strong.</li>
      <li>Very strong mints,</li>
      <li>Makes my breath fresh and mouth feel great.</li>
      <li>and it freshened things right up great.</li>
      <li>, so the price was a bit better at the time than on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Works great underwater and shipped fast.</li>
      <li>And, admittedly, getting the gelly magic stuff that it becomes can be a pain to get out of your mouth if you want to eat lunch.</li>
      <li>These really do work great.</li>
      <li>Sure they are a bit pricey, but you get what you pay for.</li>
      <li>more like a mouthwash product.</li>
      <li>I would love them, in spite of the cost, except that xylitol, like all sweeteners for me, cause gas to build up in my stomach.</li>
      <li>Mint and gum are just distracting when having personal conversations so these are perfect.</li>
      <li>you probably won&#x27;t use them much more than that.</li>
      <li>I found this mint a bit too strong and unnatural tasting for my taste, but I&#x27;m sure others would like the strength</li>
      <li>and I found the flavor to be very good, but this is not a typical mint that you expect to be overly sweet.</li>
      <li>, I&#x27;d become a very loyal customer.</li>
      <li>It takes quite a while for it to get itself kind of stuck in place, so I did find myself moving it a bit at first.</li>
      <li>just fine.</li>
      <li>I woke up at 6:30 and much of the mint was still there - nicely adhered to my gum line.</li>
      <li>Please make available a sugar and sweetener free version.</li>
      <li>it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found the overall taste to be very nice.</li>
      <li>The main bottle is just as shown in the picture, so it kind of looks like a medicine bottle.&lt;br</li>
      <li>It is mild yet strong.</li>
      <li>Upon waking up, I felt like my breath was definitely much better than normal, but it got even better when I got some saliva on the remaining mint</li>
      <li>It was very nice being able to get close to my wife and kiss her first thing in the morning - I&#x27;m definitely a fan of that!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Some people don&#x27;t like having something stuck in their mouth for that long, but they&#x27;re great for me when I&#x27;m at work or singing in the choir so I never have to worry about my breath.  </li>
      <li>The flavor isn&#x27;t super strong, but it&#x27;s enough to keep my mouth tasting good.</li>
      <li>If ForeverMints came without any sugar/sweetener added (must breath mints be sweet?)</li>
      <li>It dissolves slowly and works perfectly.</li>
      <li>I do not feel they freshen as well as a true mint or gum, but you are also not chomping away or noticeably sucking on a mint.  </li>
      <li>The taste is ok but the mints do not stick to the gum line very well, just to the teeth.</li>
      <li>This will likely become one of my favorite wedding gifts because it is creative and very useful for a newlywed couple.</li>
      <li>Its not an overwhelming burst of flavor but a steady sweet stream that freshens your breath for hours</li>
      <li>it slowly  melts.i use two or three a day wil buy more great mints.</li>
      <li>Taste good and lasts a long time.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Definitely worth giving it a try - there&#x27;s no comparable product like it on the market.</li>
      <li>It lasted 2 hrs &amp; kept my mouth moist &amp; fresh.</li>
      <li>For me, I found that the best placement for me to leave it alone is pretty much above my first or second molar.</li>
      <li>If you want to stick one in your lip and leave it in all night so that you have fresh breath when you wake up</li>
      <li>These little micro-mints have done an amazing job!</li>
      <li>Just for fun, I put one in my mouth before bed and it REALLY lasted all night!</li>
      <li>love not being constantly thirsty, and minty fresh breath</li>
      <li>Not for someone who wants a quick mint.</li>
      <li>Once again, the flavor that continues in your mouth during the 2 hours is not extremely strong, but it is present and pleasant : )</li>
      <li>I ordered them directly on their website because they are doing a promotion where you buy 3 and get 1 free</li>
      <li>tried the first one during the evening</li>
      <li>The first one I tried lasted longer than two hours.</li>
      <li>I love these things, will definitely buy again</li>
      <li>What a waste of money - you&#x27;re better off getting some cheap mints at the check out register.</li>
      <li>It is not overwhelming like most strong mints.</li>
      <li>I definitely feel like my breath is fresh and clean.  </li>
      <li>These take a little bit of getting used to, but I love them!  </li>
      <li>Used these to replace nicotine mints (that whole oral fixation thing).</li>
      <li>and I found it much easier to leavethe mint alone at night since I fell asleep and forgot it was there.</li>
      <li>Very minty taste.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend forever mints!</li>
      <li>My wife&#x27;s first mint did last for a full 2 hours.</li>
      <li>The flavor is pleasant &amp; subtle.</li>
      <li>A bit more gentle, while being long lasting would have been a better product for my use, which was to keep my breath fresh and to prevent dry mouth during the night while sleeping.</li>
      <li>At 20 cents a mint, you&#x27;ll want to let it last the full 2 or 8 hours depending on when you use</li>
      <li>I love these and hope they take off so that the price will come down.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t fill your mouth constantly with a ton of minty flavor, but it is present for sure</li>
      <li>After I left it alone for a good 10 minutes (this is probably 20 minutes into my mint experience), it did seem to get more like a gummy gel with a hard center and stuck in place.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
      <li>If your body tolerates xylitol, I highly recommend this product.</li>
      <li>They stay in place and you can talk normally.</li>
      <li>I use these mints primarily at night - they last for several hours.</li>
      <li>I can chew about 2 pieces of xylitol gum before it starts to bother my stomach, but this mint, as tiny as each piece is, will cause bloating while the first piece is dissolving.</li>
      <li>I have a chronically dry throat and these have helped me SO much!!  </li>
      <li>I like them so much I am going to order a larger amount.</li>
      <li>So far, no mucosa irritation.</li>
      <li>Farther back, it wants to slide out since I had my wisdom teeth removed</li>
      <li>I enjoy the taste, it doesn&#x27;t burn my gums and it is so small that I don&#x27;t even know its there-</li>
      <li>Love these things, they truly do last at least 2 hours.</li>
      <li>My only honest question is if someone might say something down the road about a negative effect of having xylitol or peppermint oil right on your gum line over long periods of time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>/&gt;The mints are very small and they came with a nice little carrying case that you could slip into a purse or pocket.</li>
      <li>but unless you have a medical or social need for this mint..</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> These take a little bit of getting used to, but I love them!  I definitely feel like my breath is fresh and clean.  I don&#x27;t have to worry about speaking to clients face to face.</li>
    <li> My dentist recommends xylitol mints for dry mouth and plaque prevention. Of all the mints I&#x27;ve tried, I like these best. I use these mints primarily at night - they last for several hours.</li>
    <li> Excellent breath mint.. They are very small but will last for three hours,dissolving in your cheeks. Very minty taste.</li>
    <li> Excellent product, love them.</li>
    <li> These mints are incredible.  They last forever.  Some people don&#x27;t like having something stuck in their mouth for that long, but they&#x27;re great for me when I&#x27;m at work or singing in the choir so I never have to worry about my breath.  I do find that they last so long that I have to get rid of them at meal time!</li>
    <li> For the price, these mints are a total rip off. They do nothing for me.</li>
    <li> The taste is ok but the mints do not stick to the gum line very well, just to the teeth. I did not like them.</li>
    <li> Used these to replace nicotine mints (that whole oral fixation thing). These do the trick and do it well! They last a LONG time. a LONG long time. And, admittedly, getting the gelly magic stuff that it becomes can be a pain to get out of your mouth if you want to eat lunch. Doesn&#x27;t matter though. Absolutely awesome and SO MUCH better than nicotine. Incredibly grateful for this product</li>
    <li> On a whim I thought I would try these.  I am undecided.  They are a novel idea, a mint that you treat like chewing tobacco.  Just a few between the cheek and gum.  I do not feel they freshen as well as a true mint or gum, but you are also not chomping away or noticeably sucking on a mint.  This is good when you are dealing with clients.  I use two at a time, get about 2 hours out of them and have not had any issues with gum sensitivity.</li>
    <li> I like them so much I am going to order a larger amount.</li>
    <li> These really do work great. My husband spends all day at church on Sunday speaking with a lot of people and he was struggling with bad breath on this day. Mint and gum are just distracting when having personal conversations so these are perfect. They stay in place and you can talk normally. I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Works great underwater and shipped fast.</li>
    <li> Love these things, they truly do last at least 2 hours. Its not an overwhelming burst of flavor but a steady sweet stream that freshens your breath for hours and it never looks like you have anything in your mouth at all.</li>
    <li> I was a bit skeptical at first, but thought I&#x27;d give these a try. I ordered them directly on their website because they are doing a promotion where you buy 3 and get 1 free and I wanted a couple for gifts (Awesome Wedding gift if you think about it), so the price was a bit better at the time than on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The mints are very small and they came with a nice little carrying case that you could slip into a purse or pocket. The main bottle is just as shown in the picture, so it kind of looks like a medicine bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried the first one during the evening and I found the flavor to be very good, but this is not a typical mint that you expect to be overly sweet. I let it sit in my mouth for a bit before tucking it in my upper gum line. It takes quite a while for it to get itself kind of stuck in place, so I did find myself moving it a bit at first. It doesn&#x27;t fill your mouth constantly with a ton of minty flavor, but it is present for sure and I can see how it would help with dry mouth issues or if you are in a setting where you need to speak for a long time. For me, I found that the best placement for me to leave it alone is pretty much above my first or second molar. Farther back, it wants to slide out since I had my wisdom teeth removed so there is a gap back there. After I left it alone for a good 10 minutes (this is probably 20 minutes into my mint experience), it did seem to get more like a gummy gel with a hard center and stuck in place. After about an hour, my curiosity got the best of me and I pulled it out with my tongue to play with it. I actually bit into it because I wanted to see what it was like and biting it makes it very strong. My wife&#x27;s first mint did last for a full 2 hours. Once again, the flavor that continues in your mouth during the 2 hours is not extremely strong, but it is present and pleasant : )&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My wife and I also wanted to try it over night. We went to bed at about midnight and I found it much easier to leavethe mint alone at night since I fell asleep and forgot it was there. I woke up at 6:30 and much of the mint was still there - nicely adhered to my gum line. Upon waking up, I felt like my breath was definitely much better than normal, but it got even better when I got some saliva on the remaining mint and it freshened things right up great. It was very nice being able to get close to my wife and kiss her first thing in the morning - I&#x27;m definitely a fan of that!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;d say these are a great item! I&#x27;m a fan! This will likely become one of my favorite wedding gifts because it is creative and very useful for a newlywed couple. If you are a mint chomper like me, you&#x27;ll want to rid yourself of the habit. At 20 cents a mint, you&#x27;ll want to let it last the full 2 or 8 hours depending on when you use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found the overall taste to be very nice. The xylitol didn&#x27;t seem overpowering to me. My only honest question is if someone might say something down the road about a negative effect of having xylitol or peppermint oil right on your gum line over long periods of time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely worth giving it a try - there&#x27;s no comparable product like it on the market.</li>
    <li> When people catch onto these pharmaceutical grade mints, the candy mint business will suffer. Sure they are a bit pricey, but you get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> These mints last longer than 3 hours based on my experience. They are amazing. I usually pop 2 in my mouth and just forget about them. Not an overpowering blast of mint flavor . It is mild yet strong.</li>
    <li> I like the flavor, the size, and it lasts longer than 2 hours for me personally.  I quit smoking years ago and was still addicted to nicotine lozenges.  I finally decided to go cold turkey, but I was more addicted to having them in my mouth than the actual nicotine.  While looking for something that would last longer than 5 minutes I ran into these on the interwebz.  I&#x27;m so grateful to have found them!  They are expensive, but totally worth the price as far as I&#x27;m concerned.</li>
    <li> It dissolves slowly and works perfectly. Makes my breath fresh and mouth feel great. I love these things, will definitely buy again</li>
    <li> breath mints that actually work!</li>
    <li> I have a chronically dry throat and these have helped me SO much!!  I can even sleep with one and it helps throughout the night.</li>
    <li> I saw these reviewed in a magazine article, and since I am at school all day, teaching kids, I thought I&#x27;d give them a break and try this, to see if it would help. IT DOES! They last so long, and you can&#x27;t even tell that they are in! I don&#x27;t think I will ever buy another mint or gum again. These rock.</li>
    <li> These mints perform as advertised.The tiny mint melts into a gel in your mouth but stays well hidden the entire time.The first one I tried lasted longer than two hours. I took mine out before it ever fully dissolved, but the minty taste lasted even after brushing my teeth. I used mouthwash and I could still taste the mint in my mouth where it had lodged. I would love them, in spite of the cost, except that xylitol, like all sweeteners for me, cause gas to build up in my stomach. I know people tout this antibacterial, good-for-your-mouth \\&quot;natural\\&quot; sweetener, but its effect on me is no different than sorbitol or aspartame. I can chew about 2 pieces of xylitol gum before it starts to bother my stomach, but this mint, as tiny as each piece is, will cause bloating while the first piece is dissolving. If ForeverMints came without any sugar/sweetener added (must breath mints be sweet?), I&#x27;d become a very loyal customer. Please make available a sugar and sweetener free version. If your body tolerates xylitol, I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> They do what they say they do. But do you really want a weird slimy mint in your mouth for hours?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you need something like this because you have the worst breath in the world and just need something that will get you through a work day or a big event without gassing everyone around you with your dragon breath then these mints are for you. If you want to stick one in your lip and leave it in all night so that you have fresh breath when you wake up and you don&#x27;t mind the weird slimy feeling of the mint then these are for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you like eating mints like candy... these aren&#x27;t for you. They just don&#x27;t taste that great... more like a mouthwash product. They don&#x27;t taste terrible... just not good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buy one for a novelty... you might try it once... heck you might even convince yourself to try it twice... but unless you have a medical or social need for this mint.. you probably won&#x27;t use them much more than that.</li>
    <li> Last about 2 hrs but made my mouth dry</li>
    <li> I bought these for my mom after she saw them advertised on Glen Beck.  What a waste of money - you&#x27;re better off getting some cheap mints at the check out register.</li>
    <li> One mint definitely lasts for two hours if tucked up along the back gumline. The flavor isn&#x27;t super strong, but it&#x27;s enough to keep my mouth tasting good. I love these and hope they take off so that the price will come down.</li>
    <li> Taste good and lasts a long time. Zylitol is toxic and one of the ingredients.</li>
    <li> Works great. I forget the mint is still in my mouth. Lasts for hours.</li>
    <li> I have a problem with dry mouth. I&#x27;m constantly chewing gum &amp; buy them in bulk from Costco. These little micro-mints have done an amazing job! I am not easily impressed &amp; true to form when my husband found these mints on Amazon &amp; suggested that I try them, needless to say I was very skeptical. The price was a little steep &amp; lasting 2 hrs??? They came yesterday &amp; I tried them. The flavor is pleasant &amp; subtle. It is not overwhelming like most strong mints. It does soften &amp; stick to the gum line &amp; stays in place. I thought it would be annoying but I hardly noticed it was there. It lasted 2 hrs &amp; kept my mouth moist &amp; fresh. I am happy to find a product that works for me!</li>
    <li> I read about these in a magazine. Decided we would give them a try. I like the logic behind them. It can be a little difficult to get them to stick to your gum line at first, but it doesn&#x27;t take long to get the hang of it.</li>
    <li> The mint flavor is barely evident and the artificial sweetener doesn&#x27;t agree with me. Not at all what I expected.</li>
    <li> Very different mint than what you&#x27;re used to. This gently adheres to your cheek/gum and slowly releases its freshness over the course of 2-3 hours. I like its staying power. So far, no mucosa irritation. As a precaution, I change location with every use.</li>
    <li> Different type of mint. Lasts about 3 hours. Does refresh your mouth. Not for someone who wants a quick mint. Definitely a forever mint</li>
    <li> Best mints you can buy.&lt;br /&gt;Just follow the directions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love not being constantly thirsty, and minty fresh breath anytime.&lt;br /&gt;Every human should have these, there would be no more conversations where the bad breath makes you need to gag.</li>
    <li> I talk to clients all day at work, I&#x27;m not fond of the Altoid taste, and chewing gum is unattractive and unprofessional in my opinion. My boss purchased some forever mint for everyone in the office and they are amazing. I like that one bottle lasts me months! I enjoy the taste, it doesn&#x27;t burn my gums and it is so small that I don&#x27;t even know its there- unlike other mints. Just for fun, I put one in my mouth before bed and it REALLY lasted all night! I highly recommend forever mints!</li>
    <li> Works as advertised and lasts even longer.</li>
    <li> Disappointed that they contain Sucralose which is an artificial sweetener.  Blah!</li>
    <li> Very strong mints, the taste last along time.i keep it to the side of my cheek it slowly  melts.i use two or three a day wil buy more great mints.</li>
    <li> I found this mint a bit too strong and unnatural tasting for my taste, but I&#x27;m sure others would like the strength just fine. I&#x27;m not prone to liking things like Altoids either. A bit more gentle, while being long lasting would have been a better product for my use, which was to keep my breath fresh and to prevent dry mouth during the night while sleeping. (I didn&#x27;t want the sandman to be put off by stale breath. LOL)</li>
