### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Best I have ever used.</li>
      <li>Trimmer - Trim your beard and side burns for the perfect</li>
      <li>I wanted to like this Remington, but compared to the Norelco I have sitting happily on the counter in a beautiful dock, I can&#x27;t say I do.</li>
      <li>/&gt;He&#x27;s happy with it, so I&#x27;m happy.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>Great value for the money.</li>
      <li>The pop-up trimmer works great as well.</li>
      <li>My legs are happy.</li>
      <li>I am happy.</li>
      <li>The rotary shavers give great coverage, but the shave is not as close.  </li>
      <li>It also makes a great travel shaver since you will not be worried about losing it or damaging your &amp;#34;favorite&amp;#34; high-end</li>
      <li>all I had was this Remington PF7400, I would be quite happy with its performance and give it 5-stars.  </li>
      <li>This razor works great.</li>
      <li>that alone may justify the purchase as it is good for snipping off all the fiddly bits like sideburns and even nose hairs.  </li>
      <li>I think it gives him a good, close shave.  </li>
      <li>The cutter does a good job</li>
      <li>this is a good choice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>However, it is not as good as my [[ASIN:</li>
      <li>No frills, fairly priced.</li>
      <li>and I think that is a fair evaluation.</li>
      <li>What I got was a surprising close shave that was akin to a razor.  </li>
      <li>Overall, this is an impressive electric shaver that&#x27;s an excellent value!</li>
      <li>I was really impressed with it after I first used it.</li>
      <li>Not as &amp;#34;fast&amp;#34; as a blade, but it gets the job done effectively.</li>
      <li>This is a very nice basic men&#x27;s shaver that&#x27;s perfect as a starter for my teenaged son.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It is light, balanced and felt good in the hand.</li>
      <li>and I can honestly can&#x27;t say that those shavers are any better at shaving.  </li>
      <li>I find that the Remington foil shaver does give a good close shave with pretty good coverage too.  </li>
      <li>Good shave, trimmer to take care of sideburns, and can clean it under running water.</li>
      <li>He also found it charged quickly and held the charge for a good amount of time.</li>
      <li>This Remington works great for a quick and surprisingly smooth and close shave.</li>
      <li>I love this product.</li>
      <li>All in all he is pleased with the razor.</li>
      <li>I think that the battery should do better than that.</li>
      <li>Has more features than the Remington PF7300 F3 Comfort Series.  </li>
      <li>I love it, simply love it.</li>
      <li>The charging cable is like it never occurred to them to have an elegant dock like they used to have.  </li>
      <li>The Remington 7400 is constructed ok</li>
      <li>I have used lots of electric shavers over the years and each and every year they keep getting better.  </li>
      <li>Although the F4 doesn&#x27;t shave as close as a manual razor (I didn&#x27;t expect it would), it still gives me a nice and smooth shave.</li>
      <li>Remington works best for my husband when he holds it perpendicular to his face and uses a circular motion as it seems to allow the head to respond to the shape of his face and pivot properly.</li>
      <li>I have a $250 Braun razor for home use that is SLIGHTLY better.  </li>
      <li>it didn&#x27;t cost much more.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Provides a good, clean, smooth shave.</li>
      <li>Great electric razor - very close and smooth shave.</li>
      <li>This Remington is a very good electric razor, especially at this price point.</li>
      <li>My only issue with this great product is that the off switch is in a position that makes it very easy for me to accidentally turn it off when I am using it.</li>
      <li>Oh yes, Remington is a great brand for shaver, my Remington shavers all are around 10 years old or more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Also, make sure to charge it when the light starts flashing.  </li>
      <li>Remington recommends replacing the head on this razor once a year, so this is a really economical option (assuming the head stays effective that long).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>What he discovered is that it was much better than that and provided a clean, close shave.  </li>
      <li>but if you just want an easy to use cordless shaver</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve found that this particular unit does a good job removing whiskers without flaying my face.</li>
      <li>It was about time to buy new blades for mine though, so it was a good time to try something new.&lt;br</li>
      <li>As with most blade users, I like to keep an electric shaver around for quick touch-ups.</li>
      <li>It shaves close, is comfortable to use, easy to clean, relatively easy to charge, and portable.  </li>
      <li>I would simply say that this is a great purchase for anyone.</li>
      <li>Shaving Technology - This advanced feature sits between the foils to pre-trim longer hairs for a closer shave.&lt;br /&gt;Pivot &amp; Flex - Allows the shaver head to adjust and maintain close contact around the chin, jawline, and neck.&lt;br</li>
      <li>and I experienced no discomfort with moderate pressure.</li>
      <li>The Remington is light and comfortable to hold and use, it&#x27;s rechargeable and used cordless</li>
      <li>look.&lt;br /&gt;Washable - The shaver easily washes clean under the faucet.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I am talking about rub your face smooth.  </li>
      <li>Get it and enjoy.</li>
      <li>It is comfortable to handle and even moreso on the face.</li>
      <li>It is easy to clean, charges quickly, and provides a close shave.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s simple and easy to clean and does a good job.</li>
      <li>This is a nice new Remington brand electric shaver.</li>
      <li>To clean it then it just needs to be rinsed off under the sink faucet.</li>
      <li>It gets you clean in a jiffy.</li>
      <li>I particularly like the feel of it in my hand, well balanced and very easy to maneuver.</li>
      <li>Other than that works great and is smooth.  </li>
      <li>Low battery light is nice, but it only seems to light up after running the razor and isn&#x27;t that bright</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t say that is true for this shaver.  </li>
      <li>The Remington PF7400 is a really good basic electric shaver.</li>
      <li>For the price, it is a good back up or travel shaver.</li>
      <li>so I was lucky</li>
      <li>5-minutes quick charge.  </li>
      <li>The battery charges quickly and lasts a decently long amount of time, the shave could be closer/smoother, but it does a good job.</li>
      <li>The Remington PF7400 F4 is pretty good and well-built for a basic, no-frills electric shaver.</li>
      <li>He said it gives a nice close shave, better than his previous razor.  </li>
      <li>and I would say if available for under about thirty dollars is reasonably priced.  </li>
      <li>It has a trimmer, which is useful.  </li>
      <li>useful perk</li>
      <li>This is a good, basic shaver much like others he has tried.</li>
      <li>This is a basic shaver that does that one thing, gives a good shave at a very affordable price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>but it didn&#x27;t feel right after that.  </li>
      <li>They say to let it run down and charge it 24 hours once a year to keep the battery good.  </li>
      <li>It is easy to clean and that is a big plus.  </li>
      <li>It does not have all the &amp;#34;bells and whistles&amp;#34; of some of the more expensive models on the market, but at a $40 price point, it is a great starter or introduction/budget electric shaver.</li>
      <li>: This is a good, light, maneuverable shaver, it gives an acceptable but not exceptionally close shave</li>
      <li>/&gt;Bodybuilders: I would not use this as a body shaver simply for time and power, you might be better off looking into another device or product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Four</li>
      <li>/&gt;Things went like this, the first week I couldn&#x27;t believe what I&#x27;d been thinking.  </li>
      <li>It was close to but not quite as good as the pricey Norelco razor that I bought him a few years ago.  </li>
      <li>In the absence of any adjustment feature the design seems to be an appropriate balance between closeness and comfort</li>
      <li>What you get is a mid priced razor that fairly quiet and shaves surprisingly well.  </li>
      <li>And this is also a good choice for a teen learning to shave because it&#x27;s safer than using regular razor blades.</li>
      <li>Remington has introduced and affordable and functional shaver that is easily held and maneuvered making it simple to use.</li>
      <li>The battery is pretty good, though it&#x27;s only a NiMh and not Lithium Ion, but so far it&#x27;s only been charged once</li>
      <li>The middle blade part is the first I&#x27;ve had on a flat razor and what really makes it any kind of contest for me.  </li>

    <li> Remington has introduced and affordable and functional shaver that is easily held and maneuvered making it simple to use. The battery charges quickly and lasts a decently long amount of time, the shave could be closer/smoother, but it does a good job.</li>
    <li> I am not sure what else you would look for in a shaver, as this one provides everything a shaver would. Good shave, trimmer to take care of sideburns, and can clean it under running water. May be if you are a person with thick, coarse beard who requires 30 minutes shave every morning, then this shaver is not for you. The battery lasts about an hour or so with regular facial hair, so it fits 90% of population.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is light, balanced and felt good in the hand. A bit noisy when I used the trimmer; some amount of vibration but nothing excessive. For the price, it is a good back up or travel shaver. I am not can retire my travel Remington that require 2 AA batteries and only does a half decent job. Oh yes, Remington is a great brand for shaver, my Remington shavers all are around 10 years old or more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just keep in mind that while you can clean this shaver under running water, it was not made to do wet shave in the shower.</li>
    <li> Started out a decent shaver, but got louder after just a few days.</li>
    <li> I switched to electric razors years ago for two reasons.  I don&#x27;t have to get my face sticky with shaving cream in the morning and because the cost of normal razor blades was getting so expensive it didn&#x27;t cost much more.  I used flat ones before, but the ones with the three circular blades were always my preference.  It was about time to buy new blades for mine though, so it was a good time to try something new.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Things went like this, the first week I couldn&#x27;t believe what I&#x27;d been thinking.  I hated it.  The blades aren&#x27;t attached that well under the screen so I nearly lost one down the drain the second day cleaning them.  It was harder to clean, stayed damp even when put upside down in its little plastic thing, my face was irritated, and I almost tossed it.  However, as ridiculous as it seems it really does take a few weeks to &amp;#34;train&amp;#34; a shaver so I gave it time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Week two, I started to notice some things that were nicer than old flat ones, like the middle part that does a great job of cutting that random hair that sticks up when you shave.  The one that&#x27;s mocking you, MOCKING YOU, by not getting cut, but no luck there Mr. Hair.  The middle blade took you out you little SOB.  You know, it&#x27;s possible I really needed to start my vacation about then.  ;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Week three and I&#x27;m starting to enjoy it. The cutter does a good job and I&#x27;m finally getting used to cleaning it and shaking it properly to keep getting a damp face in the morning to a minimum.  The cheapo little plastic thing it sits in is really ingeniously simple.  The battery is pretty good, though it&#x27;s only a NiMh and not Lithium Ion, but so far it&#x27;s only been charged once which is only slightly worse than my efficient old one  They say to let it run down and charge it 24 hours once a year to keep the battery good.  Low battery light is nice, but it only seems to light up after running the razor and isn&#x27;t that bright so I was lucky I had my old one the one day it did drain or I&#x27;d have looked like I had mange that day at work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I always look at blades with any new razor and they were relatively comparable to other ones, so I may keep this going forward.  The middle blade part is the first I&#x27;ve had on a flat razor and what really makes it any kind of contest for me.  They recommend new blades once a year like my old razor, so it will probably just come down to which razor&#x27;s blades are cheaper when it&#x27;s time to replace them.mange that day at work.

    <li> This is a very nice basic men&#x27;s shaver that&#x27;s perfect as a starter for my teenaged son. It&#x27;s simple and easy to clean and does a good job. No frills, fairly priced. Recommended.</li>
    <li> The Remington PF7400 is a really good basic electric shaver. It does not have all the &amp;#34;bells and whistles&amp;#34; of some of the more expensive models on the market, but at a $40 price point, it is a great starter or introduction/budget electric shaver. It also makes a great travel shaver since you will not be worried about losing it or damaging your &amp;#34;favorite&amp;#34; high-end device.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Provides a good, clean, smooth shave. Not as &amp;#34;fast&amp;#34; as a blade, but it gets the job done effectively. Did not notice any &amp;#34;pinching&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;hair pulling&amp;#34; with this model (as others are prone to do). The battery life is about average and what you would expect from this price point, but honestly I typically just keep the cord attached to mine so that I never have to worry about power loss or &amp;#34;slow down.&amp;#34; Ergonomic grip and shaver head. Reaches all the areas you should need to reach without worry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bodybuilders: I would not use this as a body shaver simply for time and power, you might be better off looking into another device or product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Four solid stars. Nothing wrong with this product, but nothing outstanding either. Well above average though. Can&#x27;t really go wrong for the price.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never found a razor under $100 that provided as close a shave, or which caused so little irritation, as this razor does.  I have a $250 Braun razor for home use that is SLIGHTLY better.  But for traveling I&#x27;m not risking that much money, and this little gem does the trick and for this price can be replaced annually.</li>
    <li> I have used lots of electric shavers over the years and each and every year they keep getting better.  A model like this would have probably sold for $200 three years ago.  Blades on the other hand seem to be limited to just adding more blades which does not really make the shave much better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The PF7400 gives me a very close shave without any irritation and the batteries are good for approximately two days of shaving and then it needs recharging.  The overall unit I suspect from past experience will last about 1 year before the foil starts to develop holes or the blades just get dull.  This will still be a significant savings over buying expensive razors.  The Remington 7400 is constructed ok, it&#x27;s not a $250 Braun but then again it&#x27;s not supposed to be.  What you get is a mid priced razor that fairly quiet and shaves surprisingly well.  The bonus is that it will save you a bag of money over it&#x27;s lifespan.</li>
    <li> This Remington works great for a quick and surprisingly smooth and close shave. My husband has never used an electric shaver and has been using those pricey Gillette Fusion Blades that perhaps provide a slightly closer shave than this Remington, but the results are very close and those blades cost about 2\3 as much as this Remington electric foil razor.  What my husband really likes about the Remington is he can shave dry, and it&#x27;s a much faster experience as he doesn&#x27;t have to be so careful about knicking or cutting his face or neck (especially around the Adam&#x27;s Apple) as when he shaves with his regular razor blade. Remington recommends replacing the head on this razor once a year, so this is a really economical option (assuming the head stays effective that long).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Remington works best for my husband when he holds it perpendicular to his face and uses a circular motion as it seems to allow the head to respond to the shape of his face and pivot properly. The Remington is light and comfortable to hold and use, it&#x27;s rechargeable and used cordless and it holds a charge for plenty of time (about 40 minutes).  To clean it then it just needs to be rinsed off under the sink faucet. It also has a pop up trimmer for side burns. This Remington is a very good electric razor, especially at this price point. And this is also a good choice for a teen learning to shave because it&#x27;s safer than using regular razor blades. Overall, this is an impressive electric shaver that&#x27;s an excellent value!</li>
    <li> We acquired this shaver for my 17 year old, as his old one broke. He found that the Remington PF7400 worked quite well and gave him a very close shave. Normally he needs to shave 1-2 times a week, and after using this razor, he could go longer between applications. He also found it charged quickly and held the charge for a good amount of time. It did not pull his hair either, when he shaved after a longer period of time had passed from the previous time.</li>
    <li> Has more features than the Remington PF7300 F3 Comfort Series.  The shaving head swivels for closer contact with the chin , jaw and neck. It also lasts 10 minutes longer when charged (40 minutes). It also has an intercept blade to pre-trim longer hairs.. All that said, I have a tough beard and had disappointing results on myself. Had a friend try it and it worked for him.</li>
    <li> &amp;#34;It&#x27;s okay&amp;#34; really sums it up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I alternate between a triple blade razor and electric during the week.  I like the close shave of blades, but my electric is much easier on my skin.  I&#x27;ve tried multiple brands, but keep going back to Braun as I find their electric razors give me the closest shave.  I won&#x27;t say which model I&#x27;m using now, because comparing it to the Remington F4 is a bit like comparing a Porsche Cayenne to a Volkswagen Golf.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still:  The Remington F4 is inexpensive and does work.  It&#x27;s easy to operate and is relatively quiet (not any quieter than my current electric, but no noisier.) The channeled double-foil head does bring to mind the quality of pricier shavers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said, I didn&#x27;t get as close of a shave as I&#x27;d hoped for. Plus, the &amp;#34;Intercept Shaving Technology&amp;#34; that&#x27;s supposed to pre-trim longer hairs appeared to ignore longer hairs as often as it trimmed them.  Speaking of trimming, I found that the pop-up detail trimmer (for side burns, beards, mustaches) pops up at an odd angle and in an odd position. The way it pops up makes the body of the shaver block my view of the detail trimmer; making it nearly impossible to see the details I&#x27;m trimming.  Defeats the purpose, in my opinion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re looking to have an &amp;#34;emergency&amp;#34; shaver in case your go-to konks out, perhaps this might be a decent choice.</li>
    <li> I have a love/hate relationship with electric shavers.  I started out years ago with Remington shavers back when they were made like a tank.  I would&#x27;ve hoped the technology improved a bit while maintaining quality.  I can&#x27;t say that is true for this shaver.  It is the same tech from years ago, built into a slimmer but less durable package.  The charging cable is like it never occurred to them to have an elegant dock like they used to have.  Instead you put a plug in the bottom and they give you a cheap piece of plastic to stand the razor in upside down.  It is very unstable.  So much so, my new razor toppled off the shelf onto the floor and went into pieces.  I don&#x27;t think anything is broken, but the foils and everything all came off and I still haven&#x27;t found all the pieces which is also ridiculous there are so many.  I wanted to like this Remington, but compared to the Norelco I have sitting happily on the counter in a beautiful dock, I can&#x27;t say I do.</li>
    <li> I have the PF7500 F5 and this one, the PF7400 F4. There is a $10 list price difference on these with this version being the less expensive. According to Remington, this has a shorter battery life between chargers--60 minutes vs. 40 minutes. There is not much difference otherwise. I keep these plugged in so it&#x27;s not something I&#x27;ve tested. They pretty much shave the same, but I do feel a slightly different grip on the PF7500 F5 and prefer how it feels in my hand although the difference is pretty minor. I like foil shavers for my legs. My old Remington--which barely holds a charge after 11 years--was a treasure from when I first bought it. It was marketed to women, but Remington doesn&#x27;t seem to do that so much anymore. And really, a foil shaver is a foil shaver, whatever the color or words on the box. This one I am keeping for travel but I have a feeling my niece will shanghai it during her next visit. If I were to buy a new one of these two models, I would pick the PF7500 F5 despite the extra $10. It feels a little better and seems a little more powerful. But it&#x27;s a shaver. My legs are happy. I am happy. Much preferable to regular razors for convenience, comfort and safety.</li>
    <li> As with most blade users, I like to keep an electric shaver around for quick touch-ups. I&#x27;ve had a couple foil head electrics over the decades.  My experience has been that they tend to give a closer shave than the self-sharpening head types, sometimes too close for those of us with sensitive skin. I&#x27;ve found that this particular unit does a good job removing whiskers without flaying my face. In the absence of any adjustment feature the design seems to be an appropriate balance between closeness and comfort and I experienced no discomfort with moderate pressure. Despite the Intercept feature I wouldn&#x27;t be inclined to use it for heavy growth; I still rely on a blade for that. The position of the pop-up trimmer on the side of the razor is clumsy and not practical for anything other than chopping off sideburns. Bottom line: This is a good, light, maneuverable shaver, it gives an acceptable but not exceptionally close shave and I would say if available for under about thirty dollars is reasonably priced.  I note the majority of reviewers use the term entry-level to describe it and I think that is a fair evaluation.</li>
    <li> This electric shaver is decent.  It shaves close, is comfortable to use, easy to clean, relatively easy to charge, and portable.  Bottom line is that it works.  However, it is not as good as my [[ASIN:B009XI6BV2 Remington F7800]] which has a charging base station, digital battery life indicator, washable head, and 5-minutes quick charge.  It also gives me a closer shave.  What I do not like is that I don&#x27;t know how much charge is left in the battery.  It just starts flashing when it needs to be charged, which I suppose is good enough, but there are electric shavers that display approximately how much power is left.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If all I had was this Remington PF7400, I would be quite happy with its performance and give it 5-stars.  Having used other (and better) shavers, I cannot give this shaver 5 stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product Info:&lt;br /&gt;Intercept Shaving Technology - This advanced feature sits between the foils to pre-trim longer hairs for a closer shave.&lt;br /&gt;Pivot &amp; Flex - Allows the shaver head to adjust and maintain close contact around the chin, jawline, and neck.&lt;br /&gt;ConstantContour - Helps foils flex to quickly respond to facial contours.&lt;br /&gt;Pop-Up Detail Trimmer - Trim your beard and side burns for the perfect look.&lt;br /&gt;Washable - The shaver easily washes clean under the faucet.&lt;br /&gt;QuietDrive Advanced Motor - Engineered to vibrate less and be 20% quieter than a previous Remington model.</li>
    <li> I love this product. This razor works great. It is easy to clean, charges quickly, and provides a close shave. I was really impressed with it after I first used it. It is also very well constructed. I love it, simply love it. My only issue with this great product is that the off switch is in a position that makes it very easy for me to accidentally turn it off when I am using it. This may simply be attributable to the fact that I have smaller hands, but who really knows. I would simply say that this is a great purchase for anyone. Get it and enjoy.</li>
    <li> My husband tried this razor out and was expecting that, at the price, it would be acceptable.  What he discovered is that it was much better than that and provided a clean, close shave.  It was close to but not quite as good as the pricey Norelco razor that I bought him a few years ago.  On the other hand, this razor was considerably less expensive and works well for him otherwise.  He also tells me that it comes close in quality to a shave with a straight edge at the barber.</li>
    <li> I have used both foil and rotary electric shavers.  The rotary shavers give great coverage, but the shave is not as close.  I find that the Remington foil shaver does give a good close shave with pretty good coverage too.  It has a trimmer, which is useful.  It has one negative. It can not be run while it is plugged in and charging. So, it has to be kept charged.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S. After 18 months of satisfactory use, February 2017, I have found that the battery of the razor holds just enough charge for one shave. I think that the battery should do better than that.</li>
    <li> This is the 3rd Remington shaver we&#x27;ve ordered in 3 years. As far as quality and shave, I would call it mediocre to ok. On the average, they&#x27;ve lasted about a year each for my husband who shaves almost daily. His face isn&#x27;t very &amp;#34;full&amp;#34; in the hair department, but not scant, either.&lt;br /&gt;He doesn&#x27;t get an ultra-clean shave like that of a razor, but doesn&#x27;t have to deal with the razor problems, either.&lt;br /&gt;It just so happens that his other razor needed some replacement parts and this is a better deal that purchasing new foils, inserts, etc.&lt;br /&gt;He&#x27;s happy with it, so I&#x27;m happy.&lt;br /&gt;I do have to say that for a superior shave, he loved the Braun we used to have, but it died a terrible death.</li>
    <li> This shaver is a little lightweight to produce a close comfortable shave.  It is comfortable but you have to run it back and forth several times to get anything like a close shave.  I do like the popup trimmer and that alone may justify the purchase as it is good for snipping off all the fiddly bits like sideburns and even nose hairs.  It is easy to clean and that is a big plus.  I am thinking of just using this for the trimming on a regular basis and maybe to take on the odd trip.</li>
    <li> The Remington PF7400 F4 is pretty good and well-built for a basic, no-frills electric shaver. I have been using manual razors for as long as I can remember. Although the F4 doesn&#x27;t shave as close as a manual razor (I didn&#x27;t expect it would), it still gives me a nice and smooth shave. I particularly like the feel of it in my hand, well balanced and very easy to maneuver. The pop-up trimmer works great as well. It comes with a small brush, and it is easy to clean by rinsing the it under running water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a basic shaver, the F4 uses a NiMH rechargeable cell that takes 16 hours to charge for about 40 minutes worth of run time, and there is no quick charge option. If you don&#x27;t need a fancy shaver for heavy use, the F4 should suffice. For under $40, you get a basic but dependable shaver that costs a little more than a pack of premium manual razors. It&#x27;s economical and a money saver in the long run. Great value for the money.</li>
    <li> My husband likes this razor.  He said it gives a nice close shave, better than his previous razor.  He did say it was louder than his previous one.  Also, make sure to charge it when the light starts flashing.  His previous razor would just get slower as the battery drained, this one will just stop.  It comes with a stand, but since he stores his in a drawer, he would have preferred a bag.  All in all he is pleased with the razor.</li>
    <li> This is a basic shaver that does that one thing, gives a good shave at a very affordable price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used other shavers from Norelco and Panasonic that are 3 to 6 times more expensive and I can honestly can&#x27;t say that those shavers are any better at shaving.  Sure those have other bells and whistles but if you just want an easy to use cordless shaver this is a good choice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is a single led above the power button that gives you the status if the battery; green is good, red is bad.  It can&#x27;t get any simpler then that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One useful perk, it does have a pop up trimmer.  The included head cover/stand I found useless.</li>
    <li> The first time my husband used this, he expected to have a closer shave with a brand new shaver.  After using it for a few days, he came back and said it&#x27;s better than he originally claimed.  I think it gives him a good, close shave.  He often uses the pop up detailer and likes that.  This is a good, basic shaver much like others he has tried.</li>
    <li> Great electric razor - very close and smooth shave. Best I have ever used.</li>
    <li> I have a goatee and need a new shaver bad.  So when I got to try this product out I was hoping for one that would keep it short and close to my skin.  A 5 o&#x27;clock shadow at least.  What I got was a surprising close shave that was akin to a razor.  I am talking about rub your face smooth.  I usually shave my goatee off at least once or twice a year so I wasn&#x27;t to sad to loose it.  That is not where the three stars come in to play.  The on/off switch is right in the middle of the razor.  And lets just say that when you accidentally hit the on/off switch and shut the razor off and your hair goes through these tiny holes to be cut while you are still pulling on the thing...well the pain is like ripping your lips off with a piece of clamps that have grabbed a few of your chin hairs and decided to go in opposite directions at the same time.  It took me only about twice of accidentally hitting this button to adjust my grip but it didn&#x27;t feel right after that.  A close shave...button is in wrong spot....no adjustments to length...one shave which is gone. Other than that works great and is smooth.  Train yourself fast on how to hold this if you are cutting off anything larger than a shadow.</li>
    <li> This is a nice new Remington brand electric shaver. It is comfortable to handle and even moreso on the face. It gets you clean in a jiffy.</li>
