      <li>has a strong barber shop smell, but that is fine with me.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s stronger than Jonathan Dirt, which I also love, so I try to make sure I don&#x27;t use too much.  </li>
      <li>Wasn&#x27;t sure at first about this gel because I have never used it before</li>
      <li>this product is great if you want a super hold otherwise the other pinaud styling gel works fine.</li>
      <li>but it seemed full</li>
      <li>I recently cut my hair short and this gel is great for giving the hold and the perfect curly look without it becoming stiff.</li>
      <li>highly recommend :)</li>
      <li>I think it works great just as I imagine it would, its definetly a stronger hold than the original green one but</li>
      <li>The super hold works great while using much less gell.</li>
      <li>This was very reasonably priced and has good reviews overall, so I figured I&#x27;d try it.  </li>
      <li>Amazing old school product the works better and smells better than almost all other hair products I&#x27;ve used!</li>
      <li>It holds well and rarely causes flaking or dryness.</li>
      <li>And it definitely adds a nice shine to your hair also after the gel dries.</li>
      <li>Just use 3 fingertips worth.</li>
      <li>No overwhelming odor, just a calm, smooth, and pleasant smell.  </li>
      <li>I really like its fragrance which leaves your hair smelling clean and fresh.  </li>
      <li>That&#x27;s not necessarily a bad thing, since as with many things now a days, what&#x27;s old in new again.  </li>
      <li>Not crazy about the smell, but it sure does hold decent as far as I can tell.  </li>
      <li>My roommate uses it to slick his hair sometimes and it looks pretty fly.</li>
      <li>now if theyll only offer me a job for, say 70-80k to span the globe educating people on what theyve been missing, life would be great!</li>
      <li>Fast Shipping!</li>
      <li>I figured out a way to make my LA Looks gel do exactly what I want,</li>
      <li>Wife says I smell like an old man, but love that old time smell!  </li>
      <li>The scent is clean, not too masculine.</li>
      <li>Love the stuff &amp; a good price bests the high priced commercial brands hands down!</li>
      <li>good product hard to find in stores</li>
      <li>I have the right-part hairstyle and this works very well with what I want.</li>
      <li>It makes my ponytail stand straight and tall.</li>
      <li>When paired with Clubmans Eau de Qunine, it really shines.</li>
      <li>This stuff is the real deal.</li>
      <li>it delivered much quicker than I thought it would</li>
      <li>the only thing I did not like is that it does not have as nice of a scent as the original green one it does.</li>
      <li>I was hesitant to buy this product with an old fashion lable and somehting I would imagine in Floyd&#x27;s Barber Shop in Mayberry but the price was right</li>
      <li>My hair realizes that too, and will no longer stay nice and flat when I comb it back</li>
      <li>This is a classic Clubman Pinaud  product that really works, as with all of all the Clubman products.</li>
      <li>this just works brilliantly without the hair feeling all hard and dry.</li>
      <li>but nothing special simply Blah,</li>
      <li>I like the smell of the gel, and it does a decent job with my hair.  </li>
      <li>straight hair in the exact same place for the whole day, doing anything.</li>
      <li>High shine.</li>
      <li>i use the green when freshly cut for week or so, then this super hold as my hair gets longer.</li>
      <li>only question i have, and its an honest one, is how is this product not destroying axe, along with other competitors in sales?</li>
      <li>The price was more than reasonable compared to other quality hair gels such as Johnny B. Mode and E Maxxx Hold.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been paying $7.99 to $12.99 for name brand gels and this stuff does the exact same thing.</li>
      <li>It also washes out easier than other gels at the end of the day, so easier to clean up also.</li>

    <li> Best smelling, best hold, best shaping mans hair gel I have ever owned. Customer for life!</li>
    <li> Holds but It leaves the beard to hard.</li>
    <li> Love the stuff &amp; a good price bests the high priced commercial brands hands down!</li>
    <li> good product hard to find in stores</li>
    <li> this product is great if you want a super hold otherwise the other pinaud styling gel works fine.</li>
    <li> Great clean cut hold. High shine. I&#x27;ve tried american crew products then this. Clubman is superior.</li>
    <li> Great hold, looks good, definitely recommend</li>
    <li> Oh my god this thing is awesome. not sure where this brand has been hiding and why its not more popular. keeps my completely unmanagable hair in check all day. i tried to let my hair grow out for the first time and do a slick sideways look. but my hair with length just became insanely wavy and would ridiculously puffy with a bunch of other hair gels or it would need a very thick layer of gel. this just works brilliantly without the hair feeling all hard and dry. it also last a while. the second day all i ahve to do is moisten it a little bit and style it again and its ready to go. cant beat this for the price.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff.  It&#x27;s stronger than Jonathan Dirt, which I also love, so I try to make sure I don&#x27;t use too much.  It&#x27;s also stickier than the dirt, so I don&#x27;t want to put it on and then lay my head down on a pillow until it has dried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You get tons of it for only $7, so it&#x27;s way cheaper than Jonathan Dirt.  I use this for the weekdays, and the dirt on the weekends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love Clubman, rarely disappointed with their products.</li>
    <li> This stuff is the real deal. When I opened the container it had a piece of someone else&#x27;s hair in it but it seemed full so I tried it out and my hair stayed rock hard for days. Great scent too! Pleasant but not overpowering.</li>
    <li> Very good styling gel, definitely does the job.</li>
    <li> Great hold. Smells great</li>
    <li> Works well and seems to last forever.</li>
    <li> Hi, I&#x27;ve been using the American Crew Hair Gel, and this stuff does the same thing for FAR less money.  It&#x27;s also a MUCH bigger jar for $4 than the other brands.  This stuff has no real smell that I&#x27;m aware of.</li>
    <li> My personal taste did not care for this gel, it left too much residue ... even when used sparingly.</li>
    <li> I BOUGHT IT TO REPLACE THE LA BELLA STYLING GELL I HAD BEEN USING. I HAVE NOT BEEN USING IT, I GUESS IT IS THE SMELL.</li>
    <li> If you have a problem holding your hair style.....look no further. This is a classic Clubman Pinaud  product that really works, as with all of all the Clubman products. Bring on the hurricane.</li>
    <li> i used to use axe gel. my barber turned me on to this gel. its so much better quality &amp; the price is unbeatable! its like getting nearly 10x s the product for the money. i use the green when freshly cut for week or so, then this super hold as my hair gets longer. only question i have, and its an honest one, is how is this product not destroying axe, along with other competitors in sales? i had never heard of it prior to that day. im a believer in their product line now &amp; they have a faithful customer in me. now if theyll only offer me a job for, say 70-80k to span the globe educating people on what theyve been missing, life would be great! butseriously, this product line is what youre looking for, trust me</li>
    <li> Good product at a GREAT price. Fast Shipping!</li>
    <li> I used to buy this from my barber but he closed up and retired and I didn&#x27;t see it in retail stores. This has always worked well for me and as long as Amazon offers it I&#x27;ll continue to use it.</li>
    <li> I always used the green original gel and decided to try this one out for the stronger hold. I think it works great just as I imagine it would, its definetly a stronger hold than the original green one but the only thing I did not like is that it does not have as nice of a scent as the original green one it does. If they can simply put a better scent on it I think it would improve it 100% , as for the scent that it has its nothing bad but nothing special simply Blah, But overall I do recommend if you want a stronger hold.</li>
    <li> Amazing old school product the works better and smells better than almost all other hair products I&#x27;ve used!</li>
    <li> Very nice hair gel. Pleasing scent, holds my medium longish hair down all day. I&#x27;ve noticed that I don&#x27;t have to use as much as other gels to keep my hair down, and it doesn&#x27;t become as cement-like when you do. Holds my hair down even when I&#x27;m at work sweating all day. It also washes out easier than other gels at the end of the day, so easier to clean up also. Would recommend to a friend.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a recovering snob that used to spend hundreds on &amp;#34;hair products&amp;#34;. I&#x27;m embarrassed to even admit it. Then I stumbled into an old barber shop and found Frank Sinatra embodied in a hair gel. This stuff is great, has that classic smell and Downton Abbey swagger. Great hold with conditioning. Best gel on the market since 1800.</li>
    <li> I was using the regular hold Pinaud gel before I found this.  The super hold works great while using much less gell.</li>
    <li> great and affordable product</li>
    <li> Best gel I have ever used!</li>
    <li> I recently cut my hair short and this gel is great for giving the hold and the perfect curly look without it becoming stiff. A little goes a long way and it&#x27;s also great if you have longer hair. I know this because my friend uses it and receives the same results that I receive.</li>
    <li> Product is great for the price.  No overwhelming odor, just a calm, smooth, and pleasant smell.  Give it about 10 minutes to dry completely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a subtle hold, you&#x27;re not going to want to use this to spike up your hair, but rather a clean cut look, comb-overs, slicked back, etc.  I slick it back and slightly to the side and this this gel does the job.  I previously was using an Axe brand gel, but it was too glue-like; this is more of a water base type gel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have dry skin so I chose this product because its alcohol-free and does not flake.  Extremely satisfied</li>
    <li> have used pinaud products for more than forty years.&lt;br /&gt;same quality since I was a young man in the sixties</li>
    <li> Plenty of gel for the price, try using it with different levels of wet hair to see what you like, if you don&#x27;t mind a gel that makes your hair harder this is a great buy. And it holds well too.</li>
    <li> great product has that old time barber shop scent to it. Just a little bit works all day long. shipped fast was good</li>
    <li> Holds well, very handy to dip your fingers in it rather than squeeze out gel. I haven&#x27;t compared it with the extra hold version, but I don&#x27;t need to.</li>
    <li> Another winner. This holds so well that I use it in lieu of gorilla glue.</li>
    <li> Great smell, non greasy. Much better than other more expensive gels I have used. Generous quantity for price paid. Happy</li>
    <li> Great gel! It smells great and the hold is great also. I have the right-part hairstyle and this works very well with what I want. I also like how it has an open-jar design versus the bottles you have to squeeze. With this design, I can just simply open it and style my hair without getting the jar dirty like I did with the squeeze-bottle design. And it definitely adds a nice shine to your hair also after the gel dries.</li>
    <li> Hey, OK, I&#x27;ll admit it. I&#x27;m no longer a young man. My hair realizes that too, and will no longer stay nice and flat when I comb it back (I&#x27;ve been told it&#x27;s because of the gray)(that for some reason I don&#x27;t see; it still looks blond to me). Anyway, it seems like I&#x27;ve been on a constant hunt for a product that will keep my hair where I want it (I&#x27;m very fortunate and still have great hair)(so I&#x27;m told regularly). This was very reasonably priced and has good reviews overall, so I figured I&#x27;d try it.  It works well, though there&#x27;s never any doubt that you have product holding you hair in place. Plus, as others have noted, you will smell like that barber shop that you used to go to (and/or may still). That&#x27;s not necessarily a bad thing, since as with many things now a days, what&#x27;s old in new again.  I would buy it again (though I doubt I&#x27;ll have to; the tub should last a lifetime), and would recommend it.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent gel for both my husband and son. It has a nice light smell to it and works excellent to sculpt and stay in place for hours. highly recommend :)</li>
    <li> I thought the name of this gel was hilarious, so I bought it. They definitely aren&#x27;t kidding about the Superhold! It makes my ponytail stand straight and tall. It smells nice, too. My roommate uses it to slick his hair sometimes and it looks pretty fly.</li>
    <li> love this. its strong and holds my hair. has a strong barber shop smell, but that is fine with me. Works great, and great value</li>
    <li> I love all of the Pinaud products. This gel is great because it doesn&#x27;t flake.</li>
    <li> As a standalone, this gel works great to keep my medium length (4&amp;#34;) straight hair in the exact same place for the whole day, doing anything. Just use 3 fingertips worth. When paired with Clubmans Eau de Qunine, it really shines. Barely 1 fingertip worth, followed by a few splashes of quinine, gives it a natural hold that seems like you&#x27;re not even using product. I&#x27;ll be getting this again.</li>
    <li> I love this product! it delivered much quicker than I thought it would, I got it in two days. Wasn&#x27;t sure at first about this gel because I have never used it before but I am now a fan of the Pinaud Clubman hair gel. Its work great with no flacking, itchy scalp, and most importantly it holds perfectly.</li>
    <li> Have some of my old stuff left, so have only used it twice to try it.  Not crazy about the smell, but it sure does hold decent as far as I can tell.  Shipping was as much or more than the item.  God Bless.</li>
    <li> I was hesitant to buy this product with an old fashion lable and somehting I would imagine in Floyd&#x27;s Barber Shop in Mayberry but the price was right so I took a chance. Glad I did! I&#x27;ve been paying $7.99 to $12.99 for name brand gels and this stuff does the exact same thing. The smell is not bad but fairly neutral to me. There&#x27;s a nice hint of lemon but mostly a neautral to pleasent smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It holds all day long but without that concreate look &amp; feel. I will buy again for sure</li>
    <li> Caused itching :( will not buy it again. Hold is just OKAY...</li>
    <li> This is a great gel - I am a woman and I wear it because it works well on thick curly hair. The scent is clean, not too masculine. It holds well and rarely causes flaking or dryness. Perfect for humid days when extra hold is required. I buy it regularly, it is a must for me! I use this one for humid days and the regular in the winter.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t hold as well as my mens Redkin but love the smell of this product. Wife says I smell like an old man, but love that old time smell!  Good production at good price and recommend it.</li>
    <li> I like the smell of the gel, and it does a decent job with my hair.  I don&#x27;t like the fact that you have to scoop it out of a jar, though.  I figured out a way to make my LA Looks gel do exactly what I want, so I&#x27;m just using this as a back-up now.</li>
    <li> As advertised and delivered promptly.</li>
    <li> This gel does the job and holds your hair in place all day long.  I really like its fragrance which leaves your hair smelling clean and fresh.  The price was more than reasonable compared to other quality hair gels such as Johnny B. Mode and E Maxxx Hold.</li>
