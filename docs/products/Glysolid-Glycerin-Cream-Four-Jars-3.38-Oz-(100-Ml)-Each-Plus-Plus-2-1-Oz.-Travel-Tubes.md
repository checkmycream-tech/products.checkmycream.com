      <li>I am very pleased that it doesen&#x27;t leave a greasy feeling on your hands.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>I, also, used to sell very famous skin care line ($100-$200 face creams), but none of them come close to the effectivness of Glysolid.   </li>
      <li>my legs look great and smooth.</li>
      <li>This product hydrates my skin well as desired and has proven itself to be effective -</li>
      <li>Absolutely the best cream ever.</li>
      <li>Glysolid is the absolute best!</li>
      <li>The product is the best -just make sure you buy it from the right distributor...</li>
      <li>This particular source is excellent.  </li>
      <li>Over the years I have used many creams, lotions, balms...spend a lot of money on them.</li>
      <li>but i m getting better now.</li>
      <li>I will surely order more when this supply is used up.</li>
      <li>Love it  </li>
      <li>Also, if you wash your hands too often, put some lanolin on top of Glysolid on your hands as a protector and you will see how much better Glysolid will work.   </li>
      <li>I love glysoilid.  </li>
      <li>Love this product.</li>
      <li>Love this stuff.  </li>
      <li>If you thought that you&#x27;ve tried everything to help those stubborn dry hands and feet regain some moisture in the fall and winter months-and you haven&#x27;t tried Glysolid-then you haven&#x27;t found the best solution.</li>
      <li>This is THE BEST cream for dry skin.  </li>
      <li>This is the best skin conditioner for extremely dry skin.  </li>
      <li>I wish the product was more readily available in the US.  </li>
      <li>This seller is great, super fast shipping.</li>
      <li>LOVE IT &amp; worth the $$$ .</li>
      <li>Works great on everything you have that is dry.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried many different products and have found Glysolid to be outstanding.  </li>
      <li>I ordered it for the first time from Amazon and use it, but it was really easy to order it and useful for use.</li>
      <li>First bought in Italy and OF COURSE available on Amazon.</li>
      <li>I live in desert country where a good moisturizer is essential.</li>
      <li>I have used it on my daughters chapped face after a day of sledding and my winter dry heels both with amazing results.  </li>
      <li>i have used it for more than ten years.</li>
      <li>There are many prices for the same product.  </li>
      <li>They shipped fast too!</li>
      <li>Glysolid has helped tremendously in keeping my wintry skin in good condition--my dry thumbs and forefingers and heels especially.</li>
      <li>I have used Glysolid for many years as a dry skin product.</li>
      <li>yet it really moisturizes my skin and helps alleviate the dryness of the winter months here in the deserts of Arizona.</li>
      <li>thanks for  all  .</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t look like much</li>
      <li>If you will use only Glysolid on your face it might start flake because of high amount of allantoin in it, which is very healing but it speeds up the regeneration of the skin and as a result-too strong and too much exfoliation for the face skin.</li>
      <li>This stuff is amazing, and just a dab goes a long way-and lasts a long time.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this product.  </li>
      <li>I would highly recommend this seller and product to everyone.</li>
      <li>This cream is a must during New England winters.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m an ER nurse - hands in water all the time, &amp; live in the NE.</li>
      <li>on bottom of feet, cannot live without this product.</li>
      <li>The only items you need to keep your skin soft, supple and young are:  - glycerin based soap (I use on my face and body Clearly Natural 25% glycerin with vitamin E soap)  - face scrub (use 2-3 times per week)  - zinc oxyde sun screen (if you are outside for more than 15 min.)  </li>
      <li>This  source is very clear and does not try and trick you.  </li>
      <li>Learned about this product from a mani/pedi professional.  </li>
      <li>I no longer have that alligator look of old lady skin.</li>
      <li>The Glysolid definitely provided her much needed moisture.</li>
      <li>My skin feels so soft afterwards.</li>
      <li>It is very soothing and healing for really dry hands.</li>
      <li>I use it year round, but during the winter it is the only thing that keeps my hands moist and free of cracks.  </li>

    <li> This product hydrates my skin well as desired and has proven itself to be effective - I would buy this product again</li>
    <li> Glysolid has helped tremendously in keeping my wintry skin in good condition--my dry thumbs and forefingers and heels especially.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for about 10 years.  It is a great cream for exposed body part  when they are chaped.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff.  In fact I need to re-order.</li>
    <li> This cream is a must during New England winters.  I use it year round, but during the winter it is the only thing that keeps my hands moist and free of cracks.  My sister battles eczema and suffers during the winter.  The Glysolid definitely provided her much needed moisture.</li>
    <li> Glysolid cream is the best moisturizer I have ever used on my face(with Lanolin), hands, body and feet. Over the years I have used many creams, lotions, balms...spend a lot of money on them. I, also, used to sell very famous skin care line ($100-$200 face creams), but none of them come close to the effectivness of Glysolid.   The only items you need to keep your skin soft, supple and young are:  - glycerin based soap (I use on my face and body Clearly Natural 25% glycerin with vitamin E soap)  - face scrub (use 2-3 times per week)  - zinc oxyde sun screen (if you are outside for more than 15 min.)  - Glysolid cream (put a little of it after shower on damp skin on your face and body).   - Anhydrous Lanolin pharmaceutical grade (Australia). Put it after Glysolid on your face, eye area and lips at night as an extra moisturizer, protector and wrinkle fighter. Lanolin is the best known moisturizer and healer for the skin. You do not have to take my word for it. Read about it, try it and see for yourself. If you will use only Glysolid on your face it might start flake because of high amount of allantoin in it, which is very healing but it speeds up the regeneration of the skin and as a result-too strong and too much exfoliation for the face skin. That is why you need lanolin for face, plus to fight wrinkles. Also, if you wash your hands too often, put some lanolin on top of Glysolid on your hands as a protector and you will see how much better Glysolid will work.   By the way this deal 4 jars and a tube from this seller is the best deal for the money! They shipped fast too!</li>

    <li> Absolutely the best cream ever. i have used it for more than ten years. you have to try it  to see.</li>
    <li> Ultra moisturizing ! First bought in Italy and OF COURSE available on Amazon. It helped especially on chapped elbows and feet.</li>
    <li> I ordered it for the first time from Amazon and use it, but it was really easy to order it and useful for use.</li>
    <li> I used to hv very dry n itchy legs. I messed them by scratching but i m getting better now.</li>
    <li> If you thought that you&#x27;ve tried everything to help those stubborn dry hands and feet regain some moisture in the fall and winter months-and you haven&#x27;t tried Glysolid-then you haven&#x27;t found the best solution. This stuff is amazing, and just a dab goes a long way-and lasts a long time.

    <li> Glysolid is the absolute best! I&#x27;m an ER nurse - hands in water all the time, &amp; live in the NE. This is the only product that deliver results! LOVE IT &amp; worth the $$$ . You only need a small amount</li>
    <li> My hands get very dry and this is the only stuff I found that works.  Love it  will order again when needed.  It goes a long way</li>
    <li> This is the best skin conditioner for extremely dry skin.  We are senior citizen age and use it every day.  Makes a great difference in our skin texture and smoothness.</li>
    <li> Love this product. Use it on my face, elbows, knees, feet and anywhere that feels dry. It&#x27;s a must have for me.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product on my hands for a few years. It is very soothing and healing for really dry hands. It is unscented so you men with rough dry hands will appreciate this product.</li>

    <li> This is an excellent product.  Since I have been using it on my hands, my hands are no longer chapped in the winter season.  I have recommended it to friends.</li>
    <li> I did recommend this to a friend as I have found that it is a great product for your hands</li>
    <li> Learned about this product from a mani/pedi professional.  Only thing that keeps my feet from cracking.  And it&#x27;s good for the hands too!</li>
    <li> I have hands that get very dry and crack in the winter time.  This product is like magic!! I put in on my hands at night and then sleep in cotton gloves the very next day I can see a noticable difference.  I would not go through the winter without this on hand.  It doesn&#x27;t look like much but you only need a very small amount.  I have used it on my daughters chapped face after a day of sledding and my winter dry heels both with amazing results.  I have purchased other similiar products but return to this wishing I hadn&#x27;t even bothered to look anywhere else.  I had also purchased the lotion product they make for travel in my purse and when off snowmobiling.</li>
    <li> i will buy another  . and this product is very good .  thanks for  all  . i will buy again</li>
    <li> This is an awesome cream, the best one I&#x27;ve ever used, plus it works on my mothers rashes when nothing else would. I use this after a shower while I&#x27;m still wet, a little goes a long way, then is really penetrates. This seller is great, super fast shipping. I would highly recommend this seller and product to everyone.</li>
    <li> I purchase several containers of Glysolid each fall for the winter as my hands dry out and crack.  This produce greatly reduces&lt;br /&gt;damage to the skin and will continue to purchase each year. Thank you</li>
    <li> I would recommend this cream to fellow quilters and to others whose hands suffer from dryness.  This is truly wonderful.</li>
    <li> I love glysoilid.  I wish the product was more readily available in the US.  This particular source is excellent.  The other source that dominates Amazon does a lot of mystery and ambiguity in their product descriptions.  There are many prices for the same product.  This  source is very clear and does not try and trick you.  The product is the best -just make sure you buy it from the right distributor...this one.</li>
    <li> This is the best stuff ever. It helps my skin when it is extremely dry. My skin feels so soft afterwards.</li>
    <li> Everything went without a hitch! The best product ever!&lt;br /&gt;I use Glysolid on my heals, legs, arms and hands. I no longer have that alligator look of old lady skin. Brown age spots on my hands are gone. My salon girl is amazed. She started me on it for my heals.....my legs look great and smooth.</li>
    <li> I have very dry hands, this product not only soothes my hands, it has a healing effect. I am very pleased that it doesen&#x27;t leave a greasy feeling on your hands.&lt;br /&gt;I gave the travel sizes to friends and they also loved it . I will surely order more when this supply is used up.</li>
    <li> Any product from Germany is quality, have used for years, stays on after washing hands,&lt;br /&gt;great on bottom of feet, cannot live without this product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried them all - my hands and cuticles are always a mess.  This cream is the best.  I mainly use it at night because it is a little thick.  I highly recommend this product.  The cover doesn&#x27;t screw on, so not as convenient for travel.</li>
    <li> Great product!  Works great on everything you have that is dry. We use it on our hands, feet, lips, etc...</li>
