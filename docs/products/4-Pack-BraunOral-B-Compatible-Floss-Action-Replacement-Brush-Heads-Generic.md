<li> so sometimes it comes loose while I&#x27;m using it.  </li>

<li> I wish I had seen the other bad reviews, this toothbrush head is NOT the same quality as the original OralB.</li>
<li> Upon using them, however, the first one failed to work less than 2 weeks before the fitting stripped out and would not operate with the toothbrush base.</li>
<li> It is NOT worth the discomfort.</li>
<li> Unfortunately the generic replacement brand &amp;#34;snags&amp;#34; the inside of my upper lip causing tares.</li>
<li> They are a firm brush.</li>
<li> Pretty disappointed in the make quality of these heads.</li>
<li> They may be somewhat &amp;#34;compatible&amp;#34;, but they&#x27;re not great.  </li>
<li> So disappointed</li>
<li> Not compatible with Oral B.&lt;br /&gt;Shipped from China; very disappointing purchase.</li>
<li> The head doesn&#x27;t fully attach to the base</li>

<ol>
    <li> Not compatible with Oral B.&lt;br /&gt;Shipped from China; very disappointing purchase.</li>
    <li> Just what the Dr ordered. Will re order. All 4 of us use the same brushing systems and enjoy brushing daily.</li>
    <li> These are not compatible with the Oral B Pulse Sonic.  Now I guess I will be using these to clean grout.</li>
    <li> Fantastic. Fit my braun perfectly. They are a firm brush. At that price it is a great savings.</li>
    <li> Great price, item fits just as the brand name for less.</li>
    <li> I really like my new brushes. They are nice and soft but do a nice job cleaning.</li>

    <li> Works great, why pay extra.  Shipping was a couple weeks though.</li>
    <li> The package arrived sooner than I expected.  There&#x27;s a problem with the brushes.  They may be somewhat &amp;#34;compatible&amp;#34;, but they&#x27;re not great.  The head doesn&#x27;t fully attach to the base so sometimes it comes loose while I&#x27;m using it.  On the other hand, the price was very good!</li>
    <li> It took over a month to receive the toothbrush heads.  They do not fit onto my brush as the original oral-B heads.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t tell the difference between the brand name brush and these.  No problems.  I will buy them again.</li>
    <li> Price is right and the heads work just fine</li>
    <li> Unfortunately the generic replacement brand &amp;#34;snags&amp;#34; the inside of my upper lip causing tares. This has happened several instances and the tares take over a week to heal. The cost savings for the generic brand is not worth the discomfort and annoyance of the oral skin tares.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had two heads break on me within 15 brushing sessions. The electric toothbrush becomes obsolete once the gearing in the heads break. I&#x27;m assuming the gearing is of a cheaper quality than original heads. I am a light brusher and had never had Oral-B branded heads break on me. I suppose there&#x27;s a reason these are a third the price. Pretty disappointed in the make quality of these heads. Buyers beware. I suggest just waiting for a good deal of for the original Oral-B heads to come around and purchase then.</li>
    <li> These are NOT Oral-B toothbrush heads. They came from China and have nondescript German writing on them. These have NOT been approved by the ADA like the real Oral-B have.</li>
    <li> Replacement heads fit my Oral B perfectly!</li>
