      <li>This is a fantastic product that you should not hesitate to purchase!</li>
      <li>But my favorite part is that it has kept him from scratching.</li>
      <li>and this version is actually one of the best for anti-dandruff.</li>
      <li>It leaves your hair with a refreshing tropical fruity&lt;br /&gt;scent</li>
      <li>This has become my favorite shampoo.</li>
      <li>There are a lot of options in this line that mostly vary in scent.</li>
      <li>, I found it refreshing.  </li>
      <li>This is one of his 3 favorite scents.</li>
      <li>One thing I noticed is that this shampoo doesn&#x27;t lather well, and more may be needed for that effect.</li>
      <li>He was also pleased that his hair was noticeably softer and to me it even appeared a bit</li>
      <li>The smell is also nice which is a huge plus.</li>
      <li>This product also works up a very nice lather and quickly makes my hair feel clean.</li>
      <li>/&gt;He&#x27;s happy with Clear Men anti-dandruff products, and will continue using them.</li>
      <li>Most importantly, I don&#x27;t have snow-like flakes on my shoulders.  </li>
      <li>Easy to comb.</li>
      <li>Otherwise, this seems to be a very worthy product.</li>
      <li>My hair was easy to comb afterwards.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not so strong it will clash with cologne.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I like this aroma, as it&#x27;s fine for women users.  </li>
      <li>When I began using Pantene 2 in 1 Shampoo/Conditioner for fine hair [[[ASIN:</li>
      <li>This has been great for my teenage son.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Still, overall I am quite happy with this product.</li>
      <li>2-1 works well, leaving hair lightly conditioned.</li>
      <li>Works well to keep hair dandruff free.</li>
      <li>I like the smooth skin feel when I get out of the shower.</li>
      <li>enjoy it, you probably will too.</li>
      <li>My scalp was dandruff free and it never itched during the day.  </li>
      <li>It works gently on the scalp--nothing burning or itching--and may prove effective over time for those with dandruff.  </li>
      <li>However, I never felt comfortable using Pantene products because they are primarily marketed for women.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>And as far as anti-dandruff shampoos go, this Clear Men Scalp Therapy shampoo/conditioner works with the best of them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>The conditioner does it&#x27;s job and the 2 in 1 saves a bit of time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For best results combine with a stiff hair shampoo brush to get to the scalp.</li>
      <li>Effective Dandruff protection, clean feel, decent smell, and cheap price.  </li>
      <li>He was developing significant dandruff and itching.</li>
      <li>don&#x27;t have a dandruff problem, but now I don&#x27;t have to worry because if I do - I have this fresh smelling shampoo!</li>
      <li>rich, soothing lather.&lt;br /&gt;-Super cleansing without stripping hair.</li>
      <li>Either way though, it rinses out clean with no leftover feeling like you didn&#x27;t get it all out.&lt;br</li>
      <li>After using it, my scalp does feel clean.</li>
      <li>Nice texture, and leaves my hair *very* soft.</li>
      <li>And, this new addition certainly lives up to the excellent Clear name.</li>
      <li>He prefers the mintier ones, but this has a nice, masculine, clean herbal scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It does a good job cleaning the hair and scalp and rinses thoroughly without leaving the hair or skin feeling stripped or dry, which is important when treating a flakey scalp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>My hair felt clean and my normally uncontrollable curls behaved better.  </li>
      <li>My hair came out looking clean and fresh</li>
      <li>I may not be the most particular shampoo user but I am looking for a number of things.</li>
      <li>It is not as thick as many other antidandruff shampoos and gives a great lather with a pleasant and rather understated aroma.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I also felt that I had to use more of the Clear Men Scalp Therapy to get a full lather.  </li>
      <li>Easy and convenient 2 in 1, makes showering fast</li>
      <li>The smell is subtle, but noticeable at close range and very pleasant.  </li>
      <li>This shampoo wins on all of these things.  </li>
      <li>However, I was pleasantly surprised that my hair still maintained its healthy, shiny, voluminous appearance.  </li>
      <li>Clear Men Scalp Therapy product is a great option for daily use.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve found that Clear men Scalp Therapy, a combination shampoo and conditioner, does not have that effect, providing that I don&#x27;t use more than recommended.</li>
      <li>I have been using the Clear Men Scalp Therapy Anti-Dandruff Shampoo for many months.</li>
      <li>and this stuff clears it right up.</li>
      <li>It left my hair feeling luxuriously soft, bouncy, and shiny but, most importantly, I was dandruff free.  </li>
      <li>He really like the combination of the shampoo and conditioner in this bottle, it leaves his hair extra soft and it smells great.</li>
      <li>but it at least makes your hair look good and smell good with some minor relief from itching and flakes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I must confess, I am a huge fan of Clear shampoos and conditioners.</li>
      <li>My scalp occasionally itched but that was okay.  </li>
      <li>It took a couple weeks of consistent use to see a difference in the flakiness.</li>
      <li>I have pretty severe dandruff now and then--</li>
      <li>that was the first thing that I noticed.</li>
      <li>It seems to have a very light and fresh herbal scent - not at all what I associate with a \\&quot;man&#x27;s\\&quot; shampoo but certainly not flowery or perfumey.</li>
      <li>Positive:</li>
      <li>hair feels moisturized and has a lot of bounce - nice as conditioners sometimes weight my curly hair down.  </li>
      <li>Sure, it cleans my hair, but it isn&#x27;t doing anything for my dry scalp or to prevent dandruff.&lt;br</li>
      <li>that its white, creamy lotion will easily come out when squeezed.  </li>
      <li>I like that it doesn&#x27;t have a strong smell like Selsen Blue.</li>
      <li>/&gt;This is a creamy thick combination shampoo-conditioner that doesn&#x27;t smell medicinal but has a pleasant scent of passionfruit with components of mint and ginger.  </li>
      <li>Good suds, no medicine smell (hardly any fragrance at all).</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t seem nearly as effective as even Head &amp; Shoulders, let alone a more expensive solution like Selsun Blue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>Although, I&#x27;ve not noticed that the &#x27;conditioner&#x27; aspect makes much of a difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Hair is shiny and the light scent lasts for several hours.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I may not be the most particular shampoo user but I am looking for a number of things. Effective Dandruff protection, clean feel, decent smell, and cheap price.  This shampoo wins on all of these things.  I have used it for a couple of weeks with no sign of dandruff despite the fact that it seems to be a gentle shampoo.  It is not as thick as many other antidandruff shampoos and gives a great lather with a pleasant and rather understated aroma.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m impressed with this shampoo.</li>
    <li> I have a thyroid problem that leaves my skin dry, including my scalp at times.  When I tried Clear Men Scalp Therapy Scalp Comfort Anti-Dandruff 2 in1 Shampoo/Conditioner, 12.9 Fluid Ounce, I found it refreshing.  My hair felt clean and my normally uncontrollable curls behaved better.  There was an immediate ceasing of any dry flaking.  The additional and totally unexpected bonus was that my hands which had been dry and cracked and not responding to any lotion became normal again.  Within two days the dryness was gone and my skin looked like it was supposed to be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The downside to this shampoo--at least for me--was that no matter how hard I kept my eyes sealed tight, I always had them burning for about an hour.  I also felt that I had to use more of the Clear Men Scalp Therapy to get a full lather.  Otherwise, this seems to be a very worthy product.</li>
    <li> I have pretty severe dandruff now and then-- and this stuff clears it right up. I like that it doesn&#x27;t have a strong smell like Selsen Blue. If you have dandruff I&#x27;d recommend trying it.</li>
    <li> men&#x27;s shampoo and conditioner 2 in 1. smells great, very manly. Works well to keep hair dandruff free. Easy and convenient 2 in 1, makes showering fast</li>
    <li> Dandruff has been my long time nemesis and I continue to have to deal with it. Personally, the only true remedy has been using Apple Cider Vinegar but the havoc it wreaks on hair (what with the smell and dullness that result) makes something I don&#x27;t use often.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Clear Men Scalp Therapy product is a great option for daily use. It leaves your hair with a refreshing tropical fruity&lt;br /&gt;scent and the conditioner gives it good shine and lightness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shampoo itself is very thin and with little lather in the hair (probably due to the conditioner being mixed in), so if you like a thicker lather you&#x27;ll want to do a 2nd round to really get up the suds. Either way though, it rinses out clean with no leftover feeling like you didn&#x27;t get it all out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found the Anti-Dandruff capability to be about fair or okay. If you suffer from a bad case of dandruff, this shampoo is no cure but it at least makes your hair look good and smell good with some minor relief from itching and flakes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No particular downside here, it smells good, makes your hair look good and it gives some dandruff (flakes and itch) relief. Well recommended.</li>
    <li> My husband has used the Clear shampoos before and really likes them, this one is no different. He really like the combination of the shampoo and conditioner in this bottle, it leaves his hair extra soft and it smells great. He has an off and on product build up problem but so far with the use of this shampoo his hair is thoroughly cleaned and we have seen no problems with flakes.</li>
    <li> My husband has mild to moderate dandruff and a touch of psoriasis. He&#x27;s also very picky about the shampoos he uses. He claims otherwise, but there are dandruff formulations he just won&#x27;t use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He&#x27;s been using the Clear line for a few months now, and I&#x27;ve shampooed with it as well to see how it cleanses and smells. Pyrithione Zinc is very effective for his scalp issues, and he likes the way these shampoos feel and smell. There are a lot of options in this line that mostly vary in scent. They are all equally effective. This is one of his 3 favorite scents. He prefers the mintier ones, but this has a nice, masculine, clean herbal scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The 2-1 works well, leaving hair lightly conditioned. If your dandruff needs very regular treatment, of if, like my husband, you use the same shampoo every day by force of habit, you may need a deeper conditioning once a week. Hair is shiny and the light scent lasts for several hours. It&#x27;s not so strong it will clash with cologne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He&#x27;s happy with Clear Men anti-dandruff products, and will continue using them.</li>
    <li> I started using Clear a while back and this version is actually one of the best for anti-dandruff. The consistency is a little thicker because of the Conditioner -being a shampoo/conditioner in 1(makes it harder to squeeze out of the bottle) but the aroma is subtle and nice. It does help relieve the itching and it actually feels like it hydrates your scalp better than other shampoos. Maybe it just lets your scalp retain moisture, therefore it&#x27;s less dry and there is less flaking and itching.&lt;br /&gt;I enjoy it, you probably will too.</li>
    <li> I have recently replaced my very expensive previously best shampoo with this stuff. I am having even less dry, itchy irritation with this. Essentially no fragrance, which I consider a big plus. Nice texture, and leaves my hair *very* soft. I really like it.</li>
    <li> I was using a different product and my scalp was irritated, red, and flaky. This felt like a milder, calming version that slowly cut back, and then eliminated those symptoms. There is a slight tingle, but it is not irritating. The smell is also nice which is a huge plus. If you have an irritated scalp I would highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> This shampoo performs as well as any other name brand dandruff shampoo, possibly even slightly better.  The effect seems to be more pronounced with continuous use and a small bit of \\&quot;set time\\&quot; before rinsing.  The smell is subtle, but noticeable at close range and very pleasant.  The conditioner does it&#x27;s job and the 2 in 1 saves a bit of time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For best results combine with a stiff hair shampoo brush to get to the scalp.</li>
    <li> I really like the products put out by Clear and this is one of them. A little goes a long way and it doesn&#x27;t strip the hair the way that other dandruff shampoos can. Recommended</li>
    <li> Fit as expected. Excellent quality</li>
    <li> I must confess, I am a huge fan of Clear shampoos and conditioners. And, this new addition certainly lives up to the excellent Clear name. Here is my overall experience:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;-Fantastic fragrance. Think: minty meets herbal. Unisex. (Thank goodness for these grown-up products geared toward men. Not a lot of guys over twenty want to smell like Axe products.)&lt;br /&gt;-Slim, ergonomic bottle (it takes up very little space in one&#x27;s shower or gym bag).&lt;br /&gt;-Very rich, soothing lather.&lt;br /&gt;-Super cleansing without stripping hair. (My long hair was left smooth, shiny, and bouncy!)&lt;br /&gt;-Inexpensive but effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Not a single one!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used this after a \\&quot;long\\&quot; ninety-minute jog ... I walked out of the shower feeling invigorated. I cannot say enough positive things about Clear shampoos and conditioners (their other products still need a bit of refining though ... so proceed with caution there). This is a fantastic product that you should not hesitate to purchase!</li>
    <li> I loved the smell of this shampoo/conditioner-that was the first thing that I noticed. Also made my hair a firm more manageable after my shower. I always use a little gel in my hair to style-I have straight brown hair-and using some shampoos makes my hair feel brittle like. But that was not the case here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definately would purchase in the future!</li>
    <li> My husband and I usually use a 2-1 Dandruff shampoo by Head and Shoulders.  I find that I still have to use a separate conditioner with that product as it is too drying for my hair.  Clear Men Scalp Therapy is truly a 2-1 shampoo.  I don&#x27;t need extra products, so I am saving money by using this shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Both my husband and I liked the feel and the smell of the shampoo.  It seems to have a very light and fresh herbal scent - not at all what I associate with a \\&quot;man&#x27;s\\&quot; shampoo but certainly not flowery or perfumey. It seems more unisex in its fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair feels moisturized and has a lot of bounce - nice as conditioners sometimes weight my curly hair down.  My husband says his hair feels soft and clean and his scalp is noticeably less dry and his dandruff is under control equally well if not better than with his standard shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend the product and will be buying it again in the future.  We like to rotate a couple of shampoos to keep build up down on our hair and this product has made the rotation list.</li>
    <li> This shampoo has a slight herbal aroma when it&#x27;s first rubbed into wet hair.  That&#x27;s from the ginseng, mint and tea tree extracts in the shampoo.  I like this aroma, as it&#x27;s fine for women users.  This aroma doesn&#x27;t last once the hair is dry.  One thing I noticed is that this shampoo doesn&#x27;t lather well, and more may be needed for that effect. It works gently on the scalp--nothing burning or itching--and may prove effective over time for those with dandruff.  My hair came out looking clean and fresh and I even got a nice-feeling scalp out of this.  My hair was easy to comb afterwards.</li>
    <li> This has been great for my teenage son. He was developing significant dandruff and itching. (some day this poor kid is going to read all my reviews and kill me)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This shampoo is refreshing. It smells great, very fresh and manly. But my favorite part is that it has kept him from scratching. The itchiness is gone. I was glad it got rid of his irritation immediately. It took a couple weeks of consistent use to see a difference in the flakiness. It was reduced at two weeks. By the end of three weeks I couldn&#x27;t see a problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am happy that there is such a pleasant, affordable solution to the problem.</li>
    <li> My husband is very particular about his personal care products. Over the years I&#x27;ve bought a plethora of shampoos for him and most of the time he&#x27;ll give them a try just to shelf them and go back to his old favorites.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product on the other hand, much to my surprise, won his approval. He says this 2 in 1 shampoo/conditioner has a decent scent and was pleased with the consistency (not too thick, not too thin). He said the product smoothed in nicely and rinsed out completely without leaving that residue feeling that many 2 in 1 products and conditioners leave behind. He was also pleased that his hair was noticeably softer and to me it even appeared a bit thicker.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been really impressed with Clear&#x27;s line of products and this 2 in 1 is no exception. Great product!</li>
    <li> When I started using this anti-dandruff shampoo, I was a middle-aged, balding, overweight man. Now, I am a middle-aged, balding, overweight man with soft hair!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does a good job with the dandruff, it does make your hair softer and it smells nice.</li>
    <li> What is there to say about shampoo?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It either cleans your hair or it doesn&#x27;t. If you have dandruff (as I don&#x27;t), you&#x27;ll know whether or not a dandruff shampoo is efficient at reducing that problem. I usually wash my hair everyday since my scalp tends to get oily when I don&#x27;t, but that means my hair is often dry. I&#x27;ve found that Clear men Scalp Therapy, a combination shampoo and conditioner, does not have that effect, providing that I don&#x27;t use more than recommended. It has a pleasant scent and it does its job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommended.</li>
    <li> I have been using the Clear Men Scalp Therapy Anti-Dandruff Shampoo for many months. So, it was a natural to try this new Clear 2 in 1.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shampoo itself is a milky cream which emerges readily from the container. It is not oily or greasy and appears not to leave residues. The odor is pleasant, but not overpowering. After using it, my scalp does feel clean. My hair tends to curl. However, this shampoo seems to flatten my curls. You may or may not like that effect. The shampoo is only slightly irritating if you get it in your eyes.</li>
    <li> Sure, it cleans my hair, but it isn&#x27;t doing anything for my dry scalp or to prevent dandruff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I waited to write this review until I had used the entire bottle and had given the shampoo a sufficient amount of time to eliminate my dandruff or, at the very least, reduce it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This shampoo hasn&#x27;t been able to do either for me. Your results may vary, this has been my experience with the Clear Men Scalp Therapy Shampoo &amp; Conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The [[ASIN:B000052XZQ Neutrogena T-Gel Therapeutic Shampoo, Extra Strength, 6 Ounce]] will be my next choice to try and eliminate the dandruff.</li>
    <li> The texture and the smell reminds me of \\&quot;Head and Shoulders\\&quot;.  A small amount is enough for me to produce a headfull of lather; I do sport a college cut haircut though.  The result is a shiny and bouncy hair.  Easy to comb. Great product.</li>
    <li> Clear Men Scalp Therapy, Scalp Comfort, Anti-Dandruff 2 in 1 Shampoo/Conditioner is the only hygiene product I need in order to keep my scalp from itching and flaking.  I am nearly fifty years old.  Until only a few years ago, I suffered with an itching, flaking scalp.  I always walked around with \\&quot;snow\\&quot; on my shoulders.  When I began using Pantene 2 in 1 Shampoo/Conditioner for fine hair [[[ASIN:B003KVMS24 Pantene Pro-V Volume 2-in-1 Shampoo &amp; Conditioner 12.6 Fl Oz (Pack of 3)]]], the dandruff went away.  It left my hair feeling luxuriously soft, bouncy, and shiny but, most importantly, I was dandruff free.  My scalp occasionally itched but that was okay.  However, I never felt comfortable using Pantene products because they are primarily marketed for women.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  Later I used the Axe 3 in 1 Shampoo, Conditioner and Body Wash, Total Fresh ([[ASIN:B00AE07BC6 Axe 3 in 1 Shampoo Plus Conditioner Plus Bodywash Total Fresh, 12 Ounce]]).  Along with the Axe 3 in 1, I also used the Axe Anti-Dandruff Styling Cream ([[ASIN:B00AE07CPM Axe Anti-dandruff Styling Cream, 3.2 Ounce]]).  My scalp was dandruff free and it never itched during the day.  However, my hair didn&#x27;t seem as voluminous and bouncy as when I was using the above mentioned Pantene 2 in 1 shampoo and conditioner.  For the sake of this review, I gave up using my Axe Anti-Dandruff Styling Cream and used only the Clear Men Scalp Therapy, Scalp Comfort, Anti-Dandruff 2 in 1 Shampoo/Conditioner.  I was afraid that my hair would become flat, greasy and itchy.  However, I was pleasantly surprised that my hair still maintained its healthy, shiny, voluminous appearance.  It is also very soft to feel.  Most importantly, I don&#x27;t have snow-like flakes on my shoulders.  I can wear black without the fear of someone seeing my dandruff.  Also, my scalp doesn&#x27;t itch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  Tall and black, the plastic bottle for Clear Men Scalp Therapy has a distinctly masculine appearance.  The bottle is made to stand upside down so that its white, creamy lotion will easily come out when squeezed.  The Clear Men Scalp Therapy also has a masculine smell that is barely detectable.  At 12.9 fluid ounces, you get a lot of shampoo/conditioner for your money.  For those men who have dandruff issues, I highly recommend the Clear Men Scalp Therapy over the feminine Pantene products and the overpriced, faddish Axe products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Joseph B.

    <li> I normally use head&amp;shoulders as i find it works the best for my dandruff. But i&#x27;ve had this product for about 3 weeks now, and i havent had any issues with dandruff so it works as well. The smell is also pretty similar to head&amp;shoulders. This product also works up a very nice lather and quickly makes my hair feel clean. Overall, i can definitely recommend this product to others with dandruff issues.</li>
    <li> I have suffered from severe dandruff since I was 10 years old. I have tried everything from Head &amp; Shoulders, Selsun Blue, to Neutrogena&#x27;s  T-Gel shampoo. NONE of them would stop the itching and flaking completely and that is with daily use. I finally came across Clear Men Scalp Therapy 2-1 shampoo on clearance at a store, I thought, &amp;#34;what the heck, it is only $1.50 so I will give it a try&amp;#34;. After only using for a week, the itching and flaking completely disappeared! I then thought the store was crazy for getting rid of this product! Thank you Amazon.com for making this product readily available! By far the best product I have ever used for my hair!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d agree with what a few others have already written in their reviews: as an anti-dandruff shampoo, Clear is just average.  It doesn&#x27;t seem nearly as effective as even Head &amp; Shoulders, let alone a more expensive solution like Selsun Blue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do like the price and that it&#x27;s a 2-in-1 shampoo/conditioner combo, and the smell is non-offensive to an allergy-prone person like myself, but I can&#x27;t say that it will be replacing my usual shampoo any time soon.</li>
    <li> This has become my favorite shampoo. It is a thick cream that doesn&#x27;t fall off your hands like a gel. Just a small amount goes a long way. The fragrance is great. I live in a dry climate and have always had dry skin. This worked so well on my scalp, I&#x27;m using it as a body wash and noticing my skin is not drying out like it used to. I like the smooth skin feel when I get out of the shower. If only this had been available when I was using coal tar shampoo that smelled.</li>
    <li> Seems like your average dandruff shampoo. Positive: Good suds, no medicine smell (hardly any fragrance at all). Negative: Not obvious that it has any effect on dandruff.</li>
    <li> Clear Men Scalp Therapy Anti-Dandruff 2 in 1 Shampoo and Conditioner contains a medication, pyrithione zinc (1.0%), to treat dandruff caused by seborrheic dermatitis by helping normalize keratin production and killing yeast.  It will definitely sting the eyes so be careful while using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a creamy thick combination shampoo-conditioner that doesn&#x27;t smell medicinal but has a pleasant scent of passionfruit with components of mint and ginger.  It does a good job cleaning the hair and scalp and rinses thoroughly without leaving the hair or skin feeling stripped or dry, which is important when treating a flakey scalp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The orange cap opens by pressing and it leaked a small amount in shipping although it wasn&#x27;t open.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I read a comment on another review that the back label opens up for instructions and it does, although the only indication of this is a tiny arrow near the top of the label.</li>
    <li> Especially with dry weather, it&#x27;s pretty common for scalps to get dry and itchy. So it&#x27;s nice to have an anti-dandruff shampoo hanging around for those occasions. And as far as anti-dandruff shampoos go, this Clear Men Scalp Therapy shampoo/conditioner works with the best of them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The active ingredient in this shampoo is pyrithione zinc, which is quite common for anti-dandruff shampoos. So it&#x27;s effectiveness may not necessarily be any better or worse than the other options. Still, it seems to work quite well in this regard. Of course, it also has the additional perk of being a shampoo AND conditioner. Although, I&#x27;ve not noticed that the &#x27;conditioner&#x27; aspect makes much of a difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still, overall I am quite happy with this product.</li>
    <li> I like the way this smells, and although it is geared towards men - I kept it in my shower a few days to test it and am happy to say it works well on long, girl hair too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t have a dandruff problem, but now I don&#x27;t have to worry because if I do - I have this fresh smelling shampoo!</li>
    <li> Thought I would try this to see if it would invigorate my scalp.  I haven&#x27;t noticed anything positive or negative with using this.  This isn&#x27;t something I would order again for this reason as well as I&#x27;ve been told to avoid products that mix Shampoo with Conditioner.</li>
