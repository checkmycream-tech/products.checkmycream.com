      <li>This product is amazing.</li>
      <li>this really works great!!!!!</li>
      <li>I bought this cream and must say after one use I was thrilled.  </li>

      <li>Highly recommend this product, easy to find ,and definitely worth $10.00!!!!!</li>

      <li>Love this stuff.</li>
      <li>A Total win in my book!</li>
      <li>but it did make them, for lack of a better description,</li>
      <li>Turns out you&#x27;re better off using it BEFORE your bath.</li>
      <li>Most lotions absorb into the skin a lot faster so this doesn&#x27;t happen</li>
      <li>smell and feel of the lotion is just ok, which is why I didn&#x27;t rate this as 5 stars.</li>
      <li>This product didn&#x27;t eliminate my kp but it made it much better.</li>
      <li>At 68 and a sun baby when we didn&#x27;t know any better</li>
      <li>and I love it.  </li>
      <li>and we&#x27;ve tried so many products.</li>
      <li>This stuff is magical.  </li>
      <li>Okay, not too many things you&#x27;ll hear me say this about, what with me being a rationalist and all, but this stuff is MAGIC!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>My son already said he wants to get another jar for when his is gone because he&#x27;s happy with the results.</li>
      <li>I have many varieties of  &#x27;stuff&#x27; on my skin these days.</li>
      <li>and frankly I forgot about checking for bumps until last night when I went to scratch my arm and noticed that I didn&#x27;t have any more bumps!!!</li>
      <li>So far so good!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m happy with this &amp; would highly recommend it.</li>
      <li>Works if consistently used, but does not smell good at all</li>
      <li>I was pretty good at using it twice a day every day but may have missed a couple days.  </li>
      <li>He&#x27;s used this 4 times and there is significant improvement!</li>
      <li>This product is amazing have used it nightly for the past three days and have already noticed a huge improvement!!!!</li>
      <li>I was really surprised to see that gold bond was the ones to come out with a product like this, so glad they did!!</li>
      <li>The jar opened easily and the cream inside was literally watery.  </li>
      <li>It goes on very easily and absorbs right in.</li>
      <li>Good so far!</li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t seen a ton of improvement yet, but there is a little bit, and it is an excellent moisturizer.</li>
      <li>I am a huge fan.</li>
      <li>1 week in and already a huge difference on my arms.</li>
      <li>May not do much for bumps, but it&#x27;s an effective non sticky, not too smelly moisturizer.</li>
      <li>This product is has made me comfortable in tank tops now.</li>
      <li>My arms are finally smooth again!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>but it does smooth skin.</li>
      <li>I will continue to use this stuff until it runs out, and in the event my results improve, I will be happy to note that at a later time.</li>
      <li>See, I figured this would be fantastic to use AFTER my bath.</li>
      <li>I am just happy I found  something that  finally  works</li>
      <li>Despite the infrequent use, I&#x27;ve maintained smooth skin on my arms and thighs.</li>
      <li>My skin is so smooth, as opposed to how bumpy it was before.</li>
      <li>My skin look and feels so smooth.</li>
      <li>My new Favorite product!</li>
      <li>Since she began using this product she has noticed a significant difference in her skin.  </li>
      <li>Worth it!</li>
      <li>the smell reports are true.</li>
      <li>Fabulous!!!!can&#x27;t say enough good things about this product.</li>
      <li>I only use it at night because it doesn&#x27;t smell good</li>
      <li>I will give a month before I make a full judgement.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Helped kp even better than I expected. Great for all dry skin!! Not greasy and lasts</li>
    <li> Works better than I expected. As long as I keep consistent - it works well. When I stop it comes back though. 😫</li>
    <li> The absolute only thing that has worked on my grandsons skin.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t seen a ton of improvement yet, but there is a little bit, and it is an excellent moisturizer.</li>
    <li> I ordered 2 jars, came with no seal and no protective film.  The jar opened easily and the cream inside was literally watery.  Don&#x27;t know what was in it.  Quickly closed the jars, washed my hands and shipped back.</li>
    <li> I saw this advertised on tv (lol, i have a dvr and rarely see ads but caught this one, thankfully) and purchases it at Wal-mart for 9.98.  Pricey for me but it is 8 oz.  I&#x27;ve had great results!!!  I started on my forearm from elbow to wrist where I had tiny rough bumps. I saw improvement within a couple wks.  I was pretty good at using it twice a day every day but may have missed a couple days.  Now, about 6 wks later, that section is quite smooth.  I am using it on the rest of my arm and having great results!! It is non-greasy but it definitely leaves &amp;#34;something&amp;#34;, I can&#x27;t describe it.  I  have to wash my hands after use.  I high recommend this cream.</li>
    <li> knockn knock it works!</li>
    <li> Just as expected! Thank you.</li>
    <li> Definitely worth the purchase, has no smell and really makes the bumps start to dimish after a few applications.</li>
    <li> Have been using everyday for three weeks now with no results. And it smells horrible.</li>
    <li> Did not change skin.  Was very chalky as it dried on skin.  Looked liked my skin was dirty.</li>
    <li> seems to work on my 18 month old and getting rid of bumps but it does have a funk to it. the smell reports are true.</li>
    <li> Ordered for my almost 10 year old who has KP. It&#x27;s on his arms, upper thighs, and on his cheeks and we&#x27;ve tried so many products. He&#x27;s used this 4 times and there is significant improvement! He&#x27;s so excited, as am I, that we&#x27;ve finally found something that actually helps and is affordable.</li>
    <li> I wish this product was available earlier! I&#x27;ve had bumpy skin on my thighs and the back of my arms my whole life and never knew how to reduce the appearance or feel. I started using this lotion and noticed smoother skin within a week. After using this regularly day and night for the next three weeks, the appearance had significantly decreased. I don&#x27;t use this lotion as regularly anymore. I aim to use it daily but I sometimes I go days without using it. Despite the infrequent use, I&#x27;ve maintained smooth skin on my arms and thighs. The bumps didn&#x27;t come back even when I went over a week without using this lotion. I definitely recommend this for anyone with persistent bumpy skin on their body.</li>
    <li> This stuff is magical.  I have to make sure I have more ordered way before I am done with my current jar because I am terrified of running out.  Not only is my bumpy skin gone but itnleft my skin so soft.  This product is really unique!!!!!</li>
    <li> It might get rid of the bumpy skin but I will probably never find out because the lotion is too stinky to use.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t think this cream would do anything, but I thought &amp;#34;why not&amp;#34;, I already bought a hundred other different creams. I have been using this cream twice a day on the upper portion of my arms and frankly I forgot about checking for bumps until last night when I went to scratch my arm and noticed that I didn&#x27;t have any more bumps!!! I have been trying to get rid of my bumps forever and now they are gone. Yippee!!!!</li>
    <li> My adult son came over and asked me if I could order him some Gold Bond Rough &amp; Bumpy Skin Cream. I had never heard of it. He has small rough bumps on the backs of his arms and I do too but his are worse than mine. I usually just exfoliate and hope that will keep the roughness at bay. I came here but the price was super high at the time so I went looking elsewhere (A rarity for me. Amazon is my go to store.) and found it at Target for $8.99. That price was well within reason so I bought two tubs. Both my son and I have been using this cream for a few weeks. I have noticed that my skin is absolutely softer and less bumpy on my arms now. My son says he sees and feels improvement and hopes he will see more with time. This is a very rich cream and only a little but is needed. It absorbs fast, doesn&#x27;t smell weird or funky, and leaves skin feeling soft. It could be used anywhere that the skin is rough, bumpy or just needs extra hydration. Gold Bond is one of my favorites for really tough skin issues like my husband&#x27;s alligator hands so I knew I was getting quality. I like it and will continue using it to see if it eliminates all the roughness. My son already said he wants to get another jar for when his is gone because he&#x27;s happy with the results. But honestly,anything over $10.00 is too much to pay when you can easily get it cheaper. I have seen it selling for $38.00 a jar. Not cool and not worth that when you can pick it up for $9.00.</li>
    <li> This definitely does exfoliate rough skin and lightly moisturize dry skin.  I don&#x27;t know that it&#x27;s a miracle cure for &amp;#34;bumpy&amp;#34; skin, but there really isn&#x27;t a miracle cure for KP.  My daughter has been using this religiously for a couple of months now and has noticed a huge difference in the texture and appearance of her skin.  Even though she still has those evil &amp;#34;red bumps&amp;#34;, they are softer and less red than before, which is a huge accomplishment for a 14 y/o whose hormones definitely make KP worse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Her biggest complaint and the reason for knocking a star off is that it isn&#x27;t as moisturizing as it maybe could be for some reason and leaves her skin feeling, &amp;#34;weird&amp;#34; (how does that translate from teen to adult?) and so she also uses another lotion separately to balance out the weird feeling.  This may be due to the exfoliation causing her skin to dry out?  I don&#x27;t know.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this may be worth checking out if you have Keratosis Pilaris and just want something OTC that you can try to alleviate some of your symptoms, but don&#x27;t expect overnight or miraculous results.</li>
    <li> Definitely minimizes bumps! Does not help the associated redness on the backs of my arms but it does smooth skin. I only use it at night because it doesn&#x27;t smell good but it claims to minimize bumps and it does. Bumps do come back quickly if you skip a day.  So use daily.  I told my dermatologist about it so he can recommend it as well.</li>
    <li> I was born with a lot of bumpy skin and have always hated people asking me questions. I bought this cream and must say after one use I was thrilled.  It has made my skin so much smoother.. If you ever wondered if there was a way to get rid of bumps on your skin like I have. (even tried shaving them off)  this really works great!!!!!</li>
    <li> Awesome product!!!! I have dry bumpy skin and have tried everything! Just from rubbing cream into my hands after applying on my feet and arms was a very pleasant surprise! My new Favorite product!</li>
    <li> Works if consistently used, but does not smell good at all</li>
    <li> My granddaughter has always had rough and bumpy skin on her upper arms so I bought it for her.  Since she began using this product she has noticed a significant difference in her skin.  We have both noticed a big change.  I would recommend this product to anyone.</li>
    <li> Seems to be working as stated..........arms feel less bumpy for sure using everyday for a week.</li>
    <li> I saw my skin softening on the first application. Absolutely great product.</li>
    <li> I know I&#x27;m not using it as directed/indicated, but I&#x27;ve been putting it on my tush. I noticed a difference after a week. Trying to convince my husband to use it on his sometimes bumpy upper arms (psoriasis?).</li>
    <li> I like this. It isn&#x27;t very strong and it does smooth out the chicken skin on the back of my arms and around my knees. If you over apply, it feels filmy and can be rubbed off. I also apply to my elbows.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing have used it nightly for the past three days and have already noticed a huge improvement!!!!</li>
    <li> Smelled bad and didn&#x27;t work for me :(</li>
    <li> I have had issues with my skin for a long time and prescription medications did not even help.  Gold Bond Rough &amp; Bumpy has cleared it up.  My skin look and feels so smooth.</li>
    <li> Just what was looking for for my husband&#x27;s bumps on his legs. Working well.</li>
    <li> This stuff works wonders on my 4 years old skin. We both suffer from red tiny dry bumps on our arms. I lather him in this after a bath and put on full leg, arm pjs, so it all soaks in. I noticed the next day how much softer and less red his arms were. We will use it for a week straight and then not use the week after and his arms feel still feel soft. Of course they come back, but we just re-apply. Give it a try. The smell isn&#x27;t amazing, but its a lotion to heal. Fragrance just annoys his skin anyways. Its the only thing that has worked on skin so far. Worth it!</li>
    <li> This stuff really works on KP!! I have used a quarter of a jar and it is 80% clear...</li>
    <li> Truly reduces bumps on my arms</li>
    <li> I used it daily for two weeks, now just using occasionally. It did make my skin seem softer when I was using it daily. However, I wish it did not have the weird fragrance. Also, it is very filmy and leaves a sort of layer of grease on my skin that can get rubbed off onto other things even hours after applying. For example, I used this lotion on my legs then later was sitting with a leg resting against the side of a table and noticed a filmy grease got left all over the table. Most lotions absorb into the skin a lot faster so this doesn&#x27;t happen but this Gold Bond lotion takes FOREVER to absorb in. I&#x27;m afraid of it getting onto my clothes or possibly ruining something so that is why I am not using this product very often anymore.</li>
    <li> great stuff....made a huge difference!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had KP on my thighs and upper arms since I was a kid, but it&#x27;s started to spread to my chest- as if anybody needs another reason to feel insecure. After using this somewhat regularly for about a month, there&#x27;s definitely a difference.  Other reviewers said to exfoliate before applying, which I also do. This stuff isn&#x27;t greasy and won&#x27;t stain your fabrics, but it does have an odd smell like hot plastic. I used a prescription lotion in the past which had a similar smell but wasn&#x27;t as effective. Good so far!</li>
    <li> This product is amazing! My KP was greatly reduced (about 95%) and my skin feels so much better! Here are a few things to know when using the product: CONSISTENCY IS KEY! It takes a while for this product to really work well, and if you miss a few days of it you&#x27;ll backslide. At first, when I would go out of town for a few days, I would just leave it, but learned that I need to put some in a travel-sized container and take it with me. I put it on right after showering. Love this product!</li>
    <li> It does smell and it does not absorb that well but I thought hey if it works it will be worth it. I have KP on my arms and I hate wearing short sleeve shirts because of it. But after 4 weeks I saw no noticeable difference so I stopped using it.</li>
    <li> After using this product for two weeks, I think it&#x27;s a nice thick cream that feels really good going onto the skin, but I can&#x27;t tell any difference from other creams yet.  I would give it more time, tough.</li>
    <li> Did not expect it to be a cure for bumpy and rough skin but  IT WORKS so  I have no problem adding to my daily  body &#x27;lotion/cream&#x27; routine. At 68 and a sun baby when we didn&#x27;t know any better I have many varieties of  &#x27;stuff&#x27; on my skin these days. Some require derm doc and RX ointments but for the roughness and bumps on my chest and upper arms this stuff is amazing.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been self conscious of my arms since I was little. This product is has made me comfortable in tank tops now. My red bumps are so much smoother. I&#x27;m almost finished with my first jar and I will definitely be ordering more</li>
    <li> The cream is wonderful and working nicely.</li>
    <li> Just got it.  Just used it.  Goes on smooth,doesn&#x27;t take a lot, not greasy and skin feels good.  Has a little smell, but not unpleasant or strong, so it won&#x27;t compete with perfumes or body sprays.  I think it is just what I need for the back of my arms and have recommended it to my niece who has the same problem.  I can tell with continued use, it will help improve the texture of the backs of my arms.  The price was affordable.</li>
    <li> Product works as described.  Use it every day to get the best results.</li>
    <li> I bought this to try to treat my bumpy upper arms and legs. I don&#x27;t have any diagnosed condition, but I like to put on lotion before I go to bed, so I  figured I might as well use lotion that will make my skin smoother.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t use it long enough to be able to tell if it does the job because it has such a strong,  pungent, medicinal smell (even though it claims to be fragrance-free), and makes your hands and skin so sticky, it was hard to go to sleep with it on.  I had to go wash my hands after each application.  I would say this reminded me more of a medicinal cream than a lotion.  I rarely use it, now, instead I use Fruit of the Earth vitamin E skin care cream, which always serves me well.  May not do much for bumps, but it&#x27;s an effective non sticky, not too smelly moisturizer. You might like this and be able to put up with the negatives if you actually have a serious skin condition. If your bumps are just a minor flaw, then don&#x27;t bother.This stuff is too pricy to waste if you end up hating it.</li>
    <li> Highly recommend it.  Exceded my expectations.</li>
    <li> Smoothest lotion I have ever had and I&#x27;m seeing results with my KP!</li>
    <li> Omg!!! I just got this yesterday  and wow!!! This stuff is a miracle all these  year&#x27;s  I was told it was eczema  turned out it wasnt  it was KP anyhow I am so happy of the results within 24hrs. My skin is softer less bumpy I am just happy I found  something that  finally  works I don&#x27;t mind paying for this stuff at alll I really  recommend  this product  to anyone dealing  with kp :)</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t believe it...Our 4 year old has awful KP on his arms and legs. We have tried EVERYTHING and this is the only product that has helped! His skin is so much smoother and while the KP isn&#x27;t gone we have noticed a significant improvement in the color and texture of his skin. I have also been using it on my feet at night and they seem much softer and smoother too! We will definitely keep applying this to our son before bed..He has never complained about the texture or smell..A Total win in my book!</li>
    <li> Seems to be working. My grandson has a lot of acne on his face,shoulders and back. We&#x27;re trying everything to see what works.</li>
    <li> Excellent service and product as good as advertised.</li>
    <li> It smells funny ew...ive been usung it for over a month now and I dont see any changes</li>
    <li> You can see it work right away after a few applications. Very good product!</li>
    <li> This stuff really works.  I&#x27;ve only been using it for about a week and I can already feel the difference.  My skin is much softer.  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for about a year and I love it.  Started using it during the winter.  had very dry skin on my arms that I just couldn&#x27;t get rid of but this works like  charm.  I stock up now whenever I find it on sale.  It doesn&#x27;t just cover up the dry skin but seems to dissolve it if that makes any sense.  I almost gave it 4 stars just for the price but if you can find it on sale it is worth it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for 3 weeks now, and ive noticed a remarkable difference!!! My skin is so smooth, as opposed to how bumpy it was before. This stuff works very well and i noticed a difference by the 3rd day. I will continue to buy this product because its amazing!!!</li>
    <li> Product was exactly what we expected. The vendor shipped it out super quick. My fiancé uses the product and she loves it. It does work well but it smells a bit</li>
    <li> A relative suggested that I give this a try, considering that she has rough &amp; bumpy skin on her upper arms, which is where I&#x27;ve the same issue area. Been using us for several weeks, not daily - I&#x27;d say about 3x a week and after a month is when I began to notice the skin surface was clearer, less bumpy, and overall just very smooth. I didn&#x27;t like the initial feeling of the cream, so instead put it on nightly versus when getting ready for the day. It just feels like something is there, nothing bad, but using it at night and letting it work is what I&#x27;ve found best for me.&lt;br /&gt;Skin feels great and after years of it being something I didn&#x27;t like but ignored, this product proved to address those concerns for me. Imagine if I&#x27;d use it as directed, it&#x27;d be near flawless, but still like how the skin looks and feels now.</li>
    <li> I have really bad kp on my arms and shoulders. This product didn&#x27;t eliminate my kp but it made it much better. My skin is much softer and smoother after using this product daily.</li>
    <li> After a few weeks of use... not an arm bump in sight. I am a huge fan. Please try this if you have ever suffered from bumps on your arms. It is amazing! Hope it helps more people like me!</li>
    <li> WOW I purchased this cream yesterday, used it at bedtime last night on the backside of my arms and elbows and was shocked this morning to discover about 90% improvement! Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> This stuff is just what I needed when I was a teenager! I felt very self-conscious about my KP 30+ years ago - the nurse who would administer my allergy shots would comment, &amp;#34;you have the skin of a rhinoceros&amp;#34;! Thanks, lady. I started using a pumice stone to exfoliate and would moisturize after bathing, but this product is miles ahead anything else I&#x27;ve tried. Sadly, I passed my KP on to my daughter, but if she would use this cream with any consistency, she&#x27;d notice a vast improvement. Any youngsters reading this should take heart that KP does get better as you age, but it&#x27;s small comfort when you&#x27;re in the midst of dealing with it. Try this! It goes on very easily and absorbs right in. It has a mildly medicinal smell, being unscented, but it doesn&#x27;t linger. Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> See, I figured this would be fantastic to use AFTER my bath. Turns out you&#x27;re better off using it BEFORE your bath. That exfoliant does just that but with how the directions and reviews made it sound nothing like what I experienced. I put some on my legs and arms about 20 minutes ago. About 10 minutes ago I had to go wasdh my arms and legs off. I don&#x27;t see or feel any difference except my soap vanishing quicker and my water bill rising. I&#x27;m sorry Gold Bond, my parents love some of your products but to me, this one is a bust. Doesn&#x27;t smell too good either.</li>
    <li> Okay, not too many things you&#x27;ll hear me say this about, what with me being a rationalist and all, but this stuff is MAGIC!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I almost didn&#x27;t write this review, because I&#x27;m only going to repeat what so many others have said, but turns out, I am so amazed I can&#x27;t stifle myself, so here goes:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Among other charmingnesses that I&#x27;ve noticed since (&#x27;scuse me for getting personal here, but) menopause arrived, is that my skin is going wacko. The relevant example here is that after years of accepting smooth skin as only natural, all of a sudden my forearms turned into something akin to those spiky things put up to discourage drivers from escaping police during chases, or driving the wrong way out of parking garages.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know why, out of all the changes, this is the one that bugged me, but it did-- enough to look online to try to figure out what was up with it. I succeeded, and discovered it&#x27;s something called keratosis pilosis, or KP for short (why something so unendearing earns a nickname is beyond me; I&#x27;d prefer to call it yukskin, but that&#x27;s just me, I guess).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reason I&#x27;m going into such detail is so that if any of you out there have the same thing and are wondering if this might succeed in returning your skin to its former state, you&#x27;ll know that my experience might be relevant, and the answer is a great big glorious YES!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I could feel a change from-- get this-- the first application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mind you, it didn&#x27;t make the bumps vanish at that point...but it did make them, for lack of a better description, less spiky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It seemed to me that, day by day, they were gradually and consistently improving, but I didn&#x27;t trust this impression, chalking it up to wishful thinking...or maybe to having been brainwashed by having read the other reviews here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, it&#x27;s been three weeks, and there&#x27;s no longer any arguing with the results: although my skin is not as it was pre-menopause, in that there are still bumps, they are much smaller, and there is zero spikiness (meaning, the bumps are now neither hard nor sharp).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And even this is not totally accurate, because-- how odd is this?-- it&#x27;s actually only my right arm that still has any bumps at all. My left really is just smooth, which I&#x27;m hoping might be a harbinger of things to come for the laggard arm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since I am continuing, still, after three weeks, to see improvement as I daily apply this stuff, my guess would be that eventually both arms will be as they were in their days of glory (okay, after all this, I have to admit, I don&#x27;t really care all that much about the state of my arms, and probably wouldn&#x27;t have even noticed it but for the fact that I evidently have a habit of rubbing my arms while driving and stopped at lights, for want, I guess, of anything more edifying to do (I refuse to be one of those people who uses their phone or tablet behind the wheel, don&#x27;t get me started), and was, one day, suddenly shocked to discover this whole armSpikes thing out of nowhere).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, while I obviously can&#x27;t guarantee that anyone else will have the same happy experience I&#x27;ve had with this product, I would certainly say it&#x27;s worth giving it a shot if you, like me, grew tired of risking hand injury while rubbing your arm (or whatever), because I swear, it worked like magic for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Further affiant sayeth naught.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve began using this product for my kp. I&#x27;m hoping to see progress soon. My complaint with this item is its odor. It&#x27;s suppose to be fragrance free, however there&#x27;s a funky odor which makes it hard to want to routinely apply the cream.</li>
    <li> So far so good! Hopefully I&#x27;ll get the results I want!</li>
    <li> Rapid shipping.  Moisturizes well.  Well absorbed into skin without greasy residue.  Can use several times a day to help combat dry, bumpy skin.  Waiting to see if bumps to go away.</li>
    <li> Did not see any difference on my skin</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had KP on my upper arms for years, but this lotion has dramatically improved the appearance and texture of my skin. My arms are finally smooth again!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell and feel of the lotion is just ok, which is why I didn&#x27;t rate this as 5 stars. It doesn&#x27;t stink, exactly, but the smell isn&#x27;t great. It looks thick in the tub, but feels a bit watery when you put it on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I highly recommend this for anyone with KP.</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t seen the improvement everyone talks about.</li>
    <li> Have been using for two weeks, skin appears smoother. Scent not very pleasant</li>
    <li> I never really paid too much attention to the bumps on my arm. When I was able to be outside in the sunshine all of the time it wasn&#x27;t too bad. However, after moving to a climate with less sunshine and taking an office job with no windows I notice led that the KP was getting worse. I started looking around and found the rough and bumpy cream and decided to give it a try. It&#x27;s been a few weeks and I LOVE it! The difference is absolutely amazing. In trying it the first few days I found that putting it on right before bed works best for me. It comes on feeling a bit greasy. After a few minutes this feeling fades (except on my hands that I usually wash after putting on the cream), but I did find that humidity or sweat will pull the cream out (ew). A couple examples of this includes when I for some reason put it on a couple hours before I went on a run on a hot day. The second example is when I put it on and soon have to take my dog outside when it&#x27;s hot and humid. By just adjusting when I put it on It now works great for me.</li>
    <li> This product worked amazingly! Scent is not the best but is worth it. In six days it softened and reduced greatly. My family is starting to use this in replace of regular lotion. Highly recommend this product, easy to find ,and definitely worth $10.00!!!!!</li>
    <li> Fabulous!!!!can&#x27;t say enough good things about this product.</li>
    <li> This does actually work.  You have to use it every day but it will diminish the look of bumps, redness and keeps you moisturized.</li>
    <li> So I&#x27;ve only used this a couple days, not long enough to see results but it absolutely smell terrible. And the smell doesn&#x27;t subside over time. Not cool.</li>
    <li> I saw a difference within a few hours, looking forward to seeing the overall progression with regular use. smells nice , makes your skin soft. I think I will be using this for a while! I was really surprised to see that gold bond was the ones to come out with a product like this, so glad they did!!</li>
    <li> Where other lotions and creams failed, Gold Bond Rough &amp; Bumpy Skin Therapy is working.</li>
    <li> This cream really helps - makes my skin soft and some of the &amp;#34;bumps&amp;#34; have become a little less in size.</li>
    <li> This seems to work fairly well.  The person who is using this said they felt a difference in softness within a day and a reduction in bumpiness within a week.  It&#x27;s not gone by any means...but looks improved.  Time will tell in the long run just how &amp;#34;cleared&amp;#34; up bumpy skin gets.</li>
    <li> This cream works excellently!  I have mild KP and have always wanted to get my arms smoother and clearer in appearance.  After using this cream for a week or so I could already tell a difference.  Now I just apply it here and there to maintain.  Great product, you won&#x27;t regret buying it!  However, I would recommend purchasing it elsewhere if you want a cheaper price. I&#x27;ve seen it for I believe $9-10 at Target.</li>
    <li> Works great.  I felt a difference after first use.  Expensive but worth it.</li>
    <li> Walmart is much cheaper..1/2 the price.  Great product!</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. 1 week in and already a huge difference on my arms. Bumps are minimal and redness is going away. Highly recommend</li>
    <li> A new product from Gold Bond.  I&#x27;m so anxious to try it!  My order came on time!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks!</li>
    <li> I have a love/hate relationship with this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the plus side, it does what it says it does.  Softens skin and gets rid of those little bumps around my elbows.  On the other side, though, it has an unpleasant smell and it leaves my skin feeling sticky for hours after application.  Because of the smell and feel, I only use it at night but wish that I could put it on in the morning as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried several tubs thinking that the smell was due to an older batch or something but they&#x27;ve all smelled the same.  It&#x27;s an unpleasant chemical smell that is probably masked by artificial scents in other products.  As this is unscented, however, there&#x27;s nothing to mask it.</li>
    <li> Still waiting for the great results touted by others. After using this, I swear my skin seems even rougher and bumpier. It doesn&#x27;t even feel softer. Other reviewers have complained about the smell as well. I find the scent to be practically odorless. I will continue to use this stuff until it runs out, and in the event my results improve, I will be happy to note that at a later time.</li>
    <li> my daughter uses this. She said it didn&#x27;t smell.the best,  but worked while she was using it</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Amlactin ultra for a year now and saw this on commercials so I thought I&#x27;d give it a try. It does smooth the kp on my skin, but not a whole lot - the more severe parts are not much softer. It&#x27;s a very thin lotion texture. But the biggest problem is the smell.... It smells like rotten fish to me, and it doesn&#x27;t get absorbed all the way. It tends to stay sticky on top of my skin and slowly just peels/rubs into little balls of lotion??</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for two months. It definitely does make my skin smoother on my arms where there are red bumps. It faded the red bumps some but they are not disappearing. Over time that may happen or this may be as good as it gets. For the progress, I will keep using it.</li>
    <li> It helped my skin but it didn&#x27;t do as much as I hoped, I&#x27;d reccomend it though.</li>
    <li> Works as advertised. I noticed smoother, less bumpy skin after 2 weeks. The reason I gave it 4 stars: the formula takes hours to absorb into the skin and it&#x27;s uncomfortable to have sticky arms for a while.</li>
    <li> Started working in one use!</li>
    <li> I bought this for the backs if my arms but my son also has tiny bumps on his cheeks that it cleared up</li>
    <li> This stuff really works! I love it!</li>
    <li> smells terrible and the texture is kind of tacky and nasty. but i feel a difference.</li>
    <li> I bought this for the bumps on the back of my upper arms. I started exfoliating in the shower then applying this right after and it has definitly helped a lot though I don’t think these bumps will ever go 100% away. As other reviewers have said, it’s a little sticky once it’s on your skin but not a big deal if you’re using it in just one place like I do.</li>
    <li> This did wonders for my KP. My upper arms haven&#x27;t felt this smooth in a long time. I also use it on my hands and wrists to protect them from the harsh PA winter. This is definitely a good buy.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t belive this cream. I have noticed a dramatic difference in just a few days. So worth the money.</li>
    <li> It works on my elbows smoothing them it&#x27;s been 3-4 weeks .</li>
    <li> Been using this for about 4 wks &amp; notice a real difference.  The skin on my arms was extremely sensitive to the touch &amp; small bumps appeared after a long illness.  Today was the 1st it was not painful to apply skin cream to my arms &amp; my skin is much smoother.  Bumps hardly noticable.  Another plus for me was that I do not notice any smell at all &amp; I am very sensitive to smells/scents.  I&#x27;m happy with this &amp; would highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> My son uses this.  I really haven&#x27;t noticed much of a change yet but perhaps he doesn&#x27;t use enough of it.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing. Within a week I noticed a difference. This will be a definite repurchase</li>
    <li> I was amazed that this really works. I started to see a difference in a week or so. Bumps are all gone and my elbows are also much less rough.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s non greasy and seems to be working on my bumping skin.  I will give a month before I make a full judgement.</li>
    <li> I think its working.  I&#x27;ve only been using it a week, but I have noticed an improvement.  I don&#x27;t like the thick feeling texture on my skin, but I dislike the bumps more and its working; the thicker, the better.</li>
    <li> Works well for bumpy arms, but you have to use it every day (hence the word &amp;#34;daily&amp;#34; in the name).</li>
    <li> helps with bumpy skin</li>
    <li> All Gold Bond products are good</li>
    <li> I have had KP my entire life and have tried many products, and nothing has worked as well as this! This stuff is amazing!! I noticed a big difference within a week. My arms are so much smoother with most of the bumps gone. Love this!!</li>
    <li> Works great and smooths skin.</li>
