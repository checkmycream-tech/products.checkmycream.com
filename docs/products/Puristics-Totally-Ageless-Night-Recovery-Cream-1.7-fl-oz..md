### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>What a great find!</li>
      <li>love this product!!!!!  </li>
      <li>This product is very good for moisturizing your face and neck overnight.</li>
      <li>Tried it and can see a remarkable difference in my skin.</li>
      <li>Good that it does not have parabens.</li>
      <li>Smells good too.  </li>
      <li>This brand is fabulous, the lotions are the best and the prices can&#x27;t be beat.</li>
      <li>Either case, it was a good price for a fair amount of night cream</li>
      <li>Love this stuff!  </li>
      <li>I love this night cream!</li>
      <li>I absolutely love this moisturizer!</li>
      <li>After I&#x27;ve put it on, if anything rubs against my face it kind of balls up and rolls off.</li>
      <li>The product is good in that it feels light and \\&quot;pure;\\&quot; not loaded with fillers like mineral oil and fragrance.</li>
      <li>So shipping and handling will cost more.</li>
      <li>LOVE LOVE LOVE.</li>
      <li>I LOVE the fact that it has no scent.  </li>
      <li>(it was in a clearance bin at my favorite grocery store) and I am so glad I did.</li>
      <li>since the top doesn&#x27;t screw off I will have to puncture the container and put it in another jar.</li>
      <li>Glad I found this online.  </li>
      <li>, SO HAD TO BREAK OFF THE TOP</li>
      <li>My makeup even glides on better in the morning.</li>
      <li>Love the feel.</li>
      <li>product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was also very pleased with how quickly I received the product.</li>
      <li>It does not get rid of wrinkles, but it sure does help with hydration and lessening of fine lines.</li>
      <li>I think this night cream is really doing my skin some good.  </li>
      <li>This product goes on easy and does not have a strong, overpowering scent.  </li>
      <li>Since I started putting it on after I wash my face before bed, I have noticed a huge difference.</li>
      <li>I use it on my neck also and it keeps my skin feeling smooth and moisturized all day.  </li>
      <li>The price for natural product was too good to not give moisturizing another try.</li>
      <li>Worth a try!</li>
      <li>I found this originally at Bed Bath and Beyond.  </li>
      <li>Reasonable cost and just as effective as higher price items.</li>
      <li>I love the way it softens my face and that its gentle.</li>
      <li>The texture is very creamy and more of a cream than a lotion, as some of these products are.  </li>
      <li>Puristics night cream is easy to put on and feels good, not greasy or heavy.  </li>
      <li>I use this as a day moisturizer and it&#x27;s wonderful, especially in the dry winter heating season.  </li>
      <li>Being careful about putting toxic materials into or onto my body, I gave it a try and loved it.  </li>
      <li>I first bought Puristics because a friend suggested it.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product since it was first introduced.</li>
      <li>I may just be optimistic, but it looks like in a month or so, I may be able to forgo the foundation step in my daily makeup routine.</li>
      <li>I will purchase the recommended 3-pack moisturizer products from Amazon very soon!</li>
      <li>You&#x27;ll be better off paying a little more and buying from Puristics directly.</li>
      <li>After using other night recovery creams, I was so happy to find a cream that not only works well</li>
      <li>However, it really does not rub in well at all.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t need to use much.  </li>
      <li>It is greaseless but leaves your face feeling very moisturized.  </li>
      <li>I have spent fortunes on face creams but this is better than any of those.  </li>
      <li>In one week I have not a single new blemish and my face feels smooth.</li>
      <li>I normally don&#x27;t use moisturizer because everything I&#x27;ve tried is greasy and makes my face breakout.</li>
      <li>but I haven&#x27;t gotten any new ones.</li>
      <li>I have only positive things to say.</li>
      <li>I also love mixing it with a little foundation to wear as a lasting tinted moisturizer!</li>
      <li>When you get up in the morning your face is soft and ready to start your morning facial regimen.</li>
      <li>Makes my skin soft, but don&#x27;t know whether it helps any with the ageless part yet or not, still waiting for that result to show.</li>
      <li>This is not a lets get young wonder cream.</li>
      <li>I have sensitive skin</li>
      <li>Natural is the way to go with anything these days.</li>
      <li>I am 28 years old and came across this stuff by mistake.</li>
      <li>Very rich, a little goes a very long way, and the moisture lasts.</li>
      <li>I also had other creams block my pores and make my face break out--and I am way too old for that--and this has kept my skin clear.  </li>

<li> /&gt;Really, you have to wonder about a company that ships defective products, doesn&#x27;t offer to send a replacement, and gives you such strange instructions to fix a problem, and instructions that don&#x27;t work.  </li>
<li> I have very oily, sensitive skin, and this doesn&#x27;t irritate me at all, is thick and creamy, and makes my skin feel like butter!</li>
<li> The scents in most moisturizers drive me crazy all day and have an &amp;#34;old lady perfume&amp;#34; quality to them.  </li>
<li> Product old, yellow, runny and way past</li>
<li> Its a skin cream that replenishes and nourishes the skin after a long day.</li>
<li> I had previously bought this item at the Big Lots store.</li>
<li> If you have sensitive skin and have a hard time finding products then I would suggest trying this.</li>
<li> This also works well to make my skin look younger and although it is thick, it absorbs well.  </li>
<li> And the price is much less that what I even paid on clearance at Walgreen&#x27;s.  </li>
<li> I also use the night recovery cream in the morning since it is a little thicker than the day one.  </li>
<li> My advice government attorney is to use our tax dollars you waste and go buy another bottle.</li>
<li> This is heavy duty cream that sometimes acts like a filler.</li>
<li> No overwhelming perfume.</li>
<li> It is thick and creamy, but not at all greasy.  </li>
<li> Apparently they don&#x27;t care about replacing one container or the bad</li>
<li> (seriously, this was their advice).  </li>
<li> Now I am addicted to it.  </li>
<li> I tried another brand when I ran out, another that has natural ingredients too, but I was very disappointed.  </li>
<li> It is not too expensive either</li>
<li> I read reviews on here all the time from ignorant and angry people.</li>
<li> Box was dirty.</li>
<li> I&#x27;m very disappointed.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Puristics night cream is easy to put on and feels good, not greasy or heavy.  Smells good too.  Will order again.</li>
    <li> This product goes on easy and does not have a strong, overpowering scent.  Makes my skin soft, but don&#x27;t know whether it helps any with the ageless part yet or not, still waiting for that result to show. Good that it does not have parabens.</li>
    <li> The product is good in that it feels light and \\&quot;pure;\\&quot; not loaded with fillers like mineral oil and fragrance. However, it really does not rub in well at all. After I&#x27;ve put it on, if anything rubs against my face it kind of balls up and rolls off. If you have sensitive skin and have a hard time finding products then I would suggest trying this. I personally won&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
    <li> This brand is fabulous, the lotions are the best and the prices can&#x27;t be beat. I have sensitive skin but I have never had any issues with this brand.</li>
    <li> This is heavy duty cream that sometimes acts like a filler. Either case, it was a good price for a fair amount of night cream</li>
    <li> I had previously bought this item at the Big Lots store. Of course, when I went back it didn&#x27;t come in again. This product is very good for moisturizing your face and neck overnight. When you get up in the morning your face is soft and ready to start your morning facial regimen. I recommend that you try this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was also very pleased with how quickly I received the product.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff!  I used this, as I had found it on clearance and Walgreen&#x27;s.  Now I am addicted to it.  I tried another brand when I ran out, another that has natural ingredients too, but I was very disappointed.  Glad I found this online.  And the price is much less that what I even paid on clearance at Walgreen&#x27;s.  It does not get rid of wrinkles, but it sure does help with hydration and lessening of fine lines.</li>
    <li> I think this night cream is really doing my skin some good.  I think that my skin is softer, and possibly a bit firmer.  The texture is very creamy and more of a cream than a lotion, as some of these products are.  Worth a try!</li>
    <li> I normally don&#x27;t use moisturizer because everything I&#x27;ve tried is greasy and makes my face breakout. I found this at biglots for just a couple dollars. The price for natural product was too good to not give moisturizing another try. Since I started putting it on after I wash my face before bed, I have noticed a huge difference. In one week I have not a single new blemish and my face feels smooth. My makeup even glides on better in the morning. I may just be optimistic, but it looks like in a month or so, I may be able to forgo the foundation step in my daily makeup routine.</li>
    <li> I found this originally at Bed Bath and Beyond.  Being careful about putting toxic materials into or onto my body, I gave it a try and loved it.  They no longer carry it in any stores so thank God I can get it on Amazon.  I LOVE the fact that it has no scent.  The scents in most moisturizers drive me crazy all day and have an &amp;#34;old lady perfume&amp;#34; quality to them.  This also works well to make my skin look younger and although it is thick, it absorbs well.  I don&#x27;t need to use much.  LOVE LOVE LOVE.</li>
    <li> I first bought Puristics because a friend suggested it.  I have used it ever since--8 months.  I have spent fortunes on face creams but this is better than any of those.  It is greaseless but leaves your face feeling very moisturized.  I also had other creams block my pores and make my face break out--and I am way too old for that--and this has kept my skin clear.  I use it on my neck also and it keeps my skin feeling smooth and moisturized all day.  I also use the night recovery cream in the morning since it is a little thicker than the day one.  I have only positive things to say.</li>
    <li> Love the feel. No overwhelming perfume. Reasonable cost and just as effective as higher price items.</li>
    <li> I USE IT ASA MOISTURIZER BEFORE APPLYING MAKE UP. THE PUMP DIDN&#x27;T WORK, SO HAD TO BREAK OFF THE TOP</li>
    <li> I use this as a day moisturizer and it&#x27;s wonderful, especially in the dry winter heating season.  Very rich, a little goes a very long way, and the moisture lasts.</li>
    <li> I love this night cream! It is thick and creamy, but not at all greasy.  It is not too expensive either</li>
    <li> After using other night recovery creams, I was so happy to find a cream that not only works well but is SAFE!&lt;br /&gt;I love this product!!!!!  I am ordering my second cream.  Will continue to use it too!</li>
    <li> I would give this no stars, if that were possible.  The container has a pump that does not come off.  The pump doesn&#x27;t work and no product is dispensed.  I emailed Puristics and asked what to do.  After several days I finally got a response--they told me to stick a paper clip into the bottom of the container and that would allow the pump to prime and to get it working (seriously, this was their advice).  I tried it and of course it didn&#x27;t work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Really, you have to wonder about a company that ships defective products, doesn&#x27;t offer to send a replacement, and gives you such strange instructions to fix a problem, and instructions that don&#x27;t work.  Apparently they don&#x27;t care about replacing one container or the bad will they generate with their customers.  So if you want to pay for a product that doesn&#x27;t work, go ahead, but you have been warned.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product since it was first introduced. I love the way it softens my face and that its gentle. I haven&#x27;t notice my age spots getting lighter or anything but I haven&#x27;t gotten any new ones.</li>
    <li> I read reviews on here all the time from ignorant and angry people. The product is 12 dollars folks and you can pick it up at Biglots for a discount price. So shipping and handling will cost more. My advice government attorney is to use our tax dollars you waste and go buy another bottle. This is not a lets get young wonder cream. Its a skin cream that replenishes and nourishes the skin after a long day. It prevents aging or further aging. I am 28 years old and came across this stuff by mistake. Tried it and can see a remarkable difference in my skin. Natural is the way to go with anything these days.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very disappointed.  I can&#x27;t use this product because the pump doesn&#x27;t work and since the top doesn&#x27;t screw off I will have to puncture the container and put it in another jar.</li>
    <li> Product old, yellow, runny and way past it&#x27;s expiration date. Box was dirty. You&#x27;ll be better off paying a little more and buying from Puristics directly.</li>
    <li> I, too, came upon this product by mistake (it was in a clearance bin at my favorite grocery store) and I am so glad I did. I absolutely love this moisturizer! I have very oily, sensitive skin, and this doesn&#x27;t irritate me at all, is thick and creamy, and makes my skin feel like butter! I work at night, so I put it on in the morning before going to bed. I also love mixing it with a little foundation to wear as a lasting tinted moisturizer! I will purchase the recommended 3-pack moisturizer products from Amazon very soon! What a great find!</li>
