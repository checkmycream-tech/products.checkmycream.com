### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Best makeup ever!  </li>
      <li>Bought for my wife and she is happy with it.</li>
      <li>A great product.  </li>
      <li>This is a good product for the price.</li>
      <li>Good price, Good product.</li>
      <li>I do not know how to get across to everyone that this is the best makeup if you want coverage-heavy or light-</li>
      <li>I just LOVE this powdery makeup and will buy again and again!</li>
      <li>but I have used it for years and love it!</li>
      <li>I LOVE this makeup!  </li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t cover blemishes the way you&#x27;d probably want it to, but it gives the face a nice, even tone.</li>
      <li>I have very sensitive skin, and this powder is awesome-</li>
      <li>Best natural foundation and concealer on the market.</li>
      <li>Full coverage and totally good for your skin in an amazing range of shades.</li>
      <li>For me, it&#x27;s perfect, but be aware that if you are looking for a full coverage, thicker make-up, this is not for you.</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s my favorite mineral foundation.  </li>
      <li>I love it ...</li>
      <li>love this stuff, I&#x27;ve used it for almost 10 years now.</li>
      <li>I prefer this brand MUCH better.</li>
      <li>I love that line of foundation ...</li>
      <li>and is so much better than a liquid makeup.</li>
      <li>so this is a great product for me and lasts a good 6 months with daily use.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used other brands but this one is the best..</li>
      <li>You need a brush to apply it with and get the right shade for you but after that you will love it.</li>
      <li>Shipping was quick and I have this product in the higher jar, which I like better as it&#x27;s easier to get the powder from, but I guess you have to roll with the times..</li>
      <li>Goes on more smoothly, and blends much better &amp; coverage is better than that other brand.</li>
      <li>This is a great product for light coverage, but not full coverage.</li>
      <li>arrived quickly, just as described</li>
      <li>, I want it!&amp;#34;  I&#x27;ve been a loyal customer ever since, as my sister now is also.  </li>
      <li>Do not buy unless you like the dewy, fresh faced look.  </li>
      <li>The finish is beautiful, the colors natural,  so pure it seems like my skin actually improves from wearing it.  </li>
      <li>I use this product daily and like it very much,  It was on sale at your site and the reduced price was nice to get.</li>
      <li>I had used bare minerals/ bare essentials line of makeup for many many years UNTIL I found this brand.</li>
      <li>Thanks Amazon!</li>
      <li>I first saw it when my daughter in my beauty industry came over wearing it.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;It looks natural, smooth and it doesn&#x27;t cake up when you sweat or when u apply it ...</li>
      <li>although I did look for samples first, without success.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Complete waste of a great deal of money.</li>
      <li>This foundation is of the same quality as I have purchased in a department store, but the price is more reasonable.  </li>
      <li>It used to be hard to find, I was thrilled to find I could get it here!  </li>
      <li>Very professional and fast service.  </li>
      <li>Of course no one at a high end department store has heard of it</li>
      <li>Looks very natural.</li>
      <li>I like a natural look, not caked on make up</li>
      <li>A friend who&#x27;s also used Bare Minerals loves both, but says she thinks this one lasts longer.  </li>
      <li>I have tried quite a few makeup brands, and neutral has nearly always been right for me, so I felt safe in trying this expensive makeup...</li>
      <li>It seemed to go on too heavy and not appear natural, although to be honest I am not sure if this was primarily because of the wrong color issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>

    <li> This is a good product for the price. It doesn&#x27;t cover blemishes the way you&#x27;d probably want it to, but it gives the face a nice, even tone.</li>
    <li> LIKE YOUNGBLOOD PRODUCTS</li>
    <li> I LOVE this makeup!  The finish is beautiful, the colors natural,  so pure it seems like my skin actually improves from wearing it.  I first saw it when my daughter in my beauty industry came over wearing it.  I said &amp;#34;whatever you have on your face, I want it!&amp;#34;  I&#x27;ve been a loyal customer ever since, as my sister now is also.  A friend who&#x27;s also used Bare Minerals loves both, but says she thinks this one lasts longer.  It used to be hard to find, I was thrilled to find I could get it here!  Thanks Amazon!</li>
    <li> Works wonders on any imperfections. Been using for 10 years and don&#x27;t plan to stop.</li>
    <li> I do not know how to get across to everyone that this is the best makeup if you want coverage-heavy or light- and is so much better than a liquid makeup. Of course no one at a high end department store has heard of it but I have used it for years and love it! You need a brush to apply it with and get the right shade for you but after that you will love it.</li>
    <li> I ordered the neutral, and it is anything but! It is very yellow, and quite unlike the color shown on my computer monitor. I have tried quite a few makeup brands, and neutral has nearly always been right for me, so I felt safe in trying this expensive makeup...although I did look for samples first, without success.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also did not like the application of the makeup. I tried both sponge and brush. It seemed to go on too heavy and not appear natural, although to be honest I am not sure if this was primarily because of the wrong color issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ordered this makeup in a pinch because my preferred makeup was out of stock. Complete waste of a great deal of money. This makeup is incredibly expensive and cannot be returned. This was a very expensive lesson and I&#x27;m kicking myself for falling for all those too-good-to-be-true reviews.</li>
    <li> Best natural foundation and concealer on the market. Full coverage and totally good for your skin in an amazing range of shades.</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive skin, and this powder is awesome- no irritation at all!</li>
    <li> A great product.  Very professional and fast service.  Thank you.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for years and it&#x27;s my favorite mineral foundation.  It never looks chalky.  I always get compliments on my skin ( and I&#x27;m no spring chicken).  Looks very natural.</li>
    <li> This foundation is of the same quality as I have purchased in a department store, but the price is more reasonable.  I would purchase again.</li>
    <li> arrived quickly, just as described</li>
    <li> Bought for my wife and she is happy with it.</li>
    <li> Good price, Good product.</li>
    <li> I had used bare minerals/ bare essentials line of makeup for many many years UNTIL I found this brand. I prefer this brand MUCH better. Goes on more smoothly, and blends much better &amp; coverage is better than that other brand.</li>
    <li> love this stuff, I&#x27;ve used it for almost 10 years now.</li>
    <li> Bought this with another youngblood item. I felt the foundation to be heavy and not a nice blend. Color seemed off as well.</li>
    <li> I love that line of foundation ... I have spend money and try everything on the market ... Until I worked at a spa and started using this line ... It is a little expensive but I get my winter color and summer and sometimes in between and it last me for 2 years ...&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t go bad ... I love it ... I wish it was a little cheaper but I will keep buying it&lt;br /&gt;It looks natural, smooth and it doesn&#x27;t cake up when you sweat or when u apply it ...</li>
    <li> I use this product regularly and just recently discovered I can buy it on Amazon for less than through my consultant. This is a great product for light coverage, but not full coverage. For me, it&#x27;s perfect, but be aware that if you are looking for a full coverage, thicker make-up, this is not for you. I like a natural look, not caked on make up so this is a great product for me and lasts a good 6 months with daily use.</li>
    <li> Best makeup ever!  Do not buy unless you like the dewy, fresh faced look.  It has sheen it in.  I just LOVE this powdery makeup and will buy again and again!</li>
    <li> I use this product daily and like it very much,  It was on sale at your site and the reduced price was nice to get.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used other brands but this one is the best.. Shipping was quick and I have this product in the higher jar, which I like better as it&#x27;s easier to get the powder from, but I guess you have to roll with the times.. the price was about $10 less then at the Youngblood site too.. Let&#x27;s face it.. I don&#x27;t use this every day but when I need a foundation to last all day this is what I choose.</li>
