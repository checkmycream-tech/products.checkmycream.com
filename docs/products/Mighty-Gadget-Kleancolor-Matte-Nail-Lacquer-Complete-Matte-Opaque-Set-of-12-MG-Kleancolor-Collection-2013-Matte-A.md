      <li>Love these colors, shipping was extremely fast.</li>
      <li>If you want to wear it for a night it is good to use, but it doesnt last any longer.</li>
      <li>Overall good color variety</li>
      <li>I thought they would be perfect because of their thick consistency.</li>
      <li>Downside is they chip pretty easily</li>
      <li>love em ver vibrant  colors</li>
      <li>Quick delivery</li>
      <li>It dries quickly.</li>
      <li>Great formula and good coverage, the only thing I don&#x27;t like is the staying power, but it lasts quite a bit longer with a few coats of matte over coat.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very pretty.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;they NEVER last more than 3-5 hours!</li>
      <li>Definitely worth getting 😊</li>
      <li>the top clear coat just makes these matte colors pop (: and</li>
      <li>and they will be all right...</li>
      <li>I would not recommend buying this; there are a lot better polishes out there for the same price.</li>
      <li>the top coat i ALWAYS use is sally hansen quick dry!</li>
      <li>Fast shipping!</li>
      <li>Delivered speedy fast!</li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t last more than a couple of hours.</li>
      <li>There good colors I had to throw away a color because it was completely dried out</li>
      <li>I love the colors but the polish was very sticky it wasn&#x27;t smooth like other  Polish</li>
      <li>They go on smooth and dry pretty quick.</li>
      <li>Overall the product is okay, decent.</li>
      <li>Prompt delivery, very well packaged, all colors match the shades pictured well and, with the exception of the bright yellow, are quite opaque even with a single coat.</li>
      <li>It ships really fast ( like 4 days).</li>
      <li>I really like these</li>
      <li>so much</li>
      <li>Fast dry polishes are good for stamping, but these matte Kleancolor polishes dry way too fast for stamping.</li>
      <li>Super opaque, nice and creamy, color selection is decent and could use yellow instead of lime green.  </li>
      <li>I used the dark blue (262) with the Kleancolor light blue holo (135) and it came out kind of like a &amp;#34;starry night sky&amp;#34;</li>
      <li>I mostly do water marble on my finger nails but sometimes paint them solid and only doing water marble on one or two nails...</li>
      <li>The polish is MATTE, which means that it dries faster than normally.</li>
      <li>They were a little smaller than I imagined and they chip very easily.</li>
      <li>At first I thought it was a fluke that happened with the white bc</li>
      <li>They dry very fast that is a positive, the picture is accurate, Yet I do not like that this polish chips very fast, the yellow is not a nice color and the pain tends to make it clumpy on some spots and not on others, making it look like a cheep nail job unless  you use three coats ...</li>
      <li>The description is clear about that.  </li>
      <li>Some of the bottles had clearly been opened.</li>
      <li>don&#x27;t use a top coat that is glossy or shiny, loses the matte finish.</li>
      <li>This only happens with the yellow and the light pink...</li>
      <li>Super fast delivery, pretty colors &amp; none of them are broken!</li>
      <li>It just sucks that the nail polish comes off so easily.</li>
      <li>so it took some getting used to without having globs, but they dry quickly and last long.</li>
      <li>The colors are vibrant and beautiful, my problem is that with this MATTE nail polish it merely needs to be exposed to the air for about 5 minutes before it becomes so thick</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> It dries quickly. But I&#x27;m not sure I like the drab idea of matte nail polish. I can add gloss if need be. It would be good for nail art, however. Sometimes lids come off from brush, but need to be pushed back on and they will be all right...</li>
    <li> The colors are super bright, cute, and awesome! It ships really fast ( like 4 days). The only disappointment was that the white nail polish was kinda thick but the others were fine. None were broken or anything. I will but from this company again!</li>
    <li> I would give zero stars if I could. Some of the bottles had clearly been opened. The brush wasn&#x27;t even connected to the lid in some bottles. The polish itself didn&#x27;t cover well, and peeled off at the slightest touch. By far, my worst purchase ever.</li>
    <li> Awful, nails chip instantly</li>
    <li> love em ver vibrant  colors</li>
    <li> They are good but going off so easily ... Not staying for a long time ..</li>
    <li> Delivered speedy fast! The nail polish is really nice! I love the Matt finish and it goes on smooth and dries fast! Great price for lots of full size bottles of high quality polish. Will purchase again from thus company. 👍</li>
    <li> I do my nails almost everyday and I personally don&#x27;t usually see a difference in brands of nail polish. So when these came in the mail I was super excited. When I tried them out though, I was instantly disappointed. I have to give them credit that it is matte and thee colors are opaque, but it goes on your nail very unevenly, and there are lots of bumps. What I&#x27;m most disappointed about though is how long they lasted. I did my nails the night I got them, and when I woke up he next morning, all my nails were severely chipped. This happened when I tried it again and to my sister too. I would not recommend buying this; there are a lot better polishes out there for the same price.</li>
    <li> There good colors I had to throw away a color because it was completely dried out I tried adding thinner but it was so bad it wouldn&#x27;t even shake and the brush broke off so I tossed it but the rest were ok. I had to add thinner to a couple colors because they were border line gloppy and thick. I&#x27;m was a little disappointed but you can&#x27;t guarantee every thing. Overall good color variety</li>
    <li> I had never tried matte polishes before so don&#x27;t have anything to compare them to, but I like these polishes. They are thick so it took some getting used to without having globs, but they dry quickly and last long.</li>
    <li> Awsome assortment of colors.</li>
    <li> Made all my beautiful nails peel.....yuck</li>
    <li> Love these colors, shipping was extremely fast.</li>
    <li> Received all colors.  Love it!</li>
    <li> excellent product and when the time of delivery.</li>
    <li> Great formula and good coverage, the only thing I don&#x27;t like is the staying power, but it lasts quite a bit longer with a few coats of matte over coat. The matte does wear down as time goes on though.</li>
    <li> Chips same as a regular nail polish. The colors were matte.</li>
    <li> These nail polish rock!!!! They are most def matte. They deliver fast!!! But when i recieved My package one of the blue ones were cracked open!!!! Spilled everywhere!! But i have the other ones there awsome!!! I love it!!!</li>
    <li> Overall the product is okay, decent. They were a little smaller than I imagined and they chip very easily. I painted my nails and the next day at work they all chipped.</li>
    <li> This nail polish was very streaky and when it dried, it turned into a dried paint sort of way don&#x27;t waste your money</li>
    <li> i like the colors and visual image is great but the quality isnt that fabulous! the color chips and it drys to dry to where it looks like a crackle polish,</li>
    <li> Great price but they chip very easily. Doesn&#x27;t last more than a couple of hours.</li>
    <li> It dries fast which is great. It doesnt last long at all. If you want to wear it for a night it is good to use, but it doesnt last any longer.</li>
    <li> Polish has a horrible consistency! Chips after two hours and last maybe two days. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product to anyone.</li>
    <li> They dry very fast that is a positive, the picture is accurate, Yet I do not like that this polish chips very fast, the yellow is not a nice color and the pain tends to make it clumpy on some spots and not on others, making it look like a cheep nail job unless  you use three coats ... This only happens with the yellow and the light pink...</li>
    <li> Absolutely love and the colors are beautiful.</li>
    <li> I really like these, I had never seen matte finish polish before I got these but they work well as a base coat to create different designs and effects.  I used the dark blue (262) with the Kleancolor light blue holo (135) and it came out kind of like a &amp;#34;starry night sky&amp;#34; effect.  It&#x27;s very pretty.  I love mixing and matching colors and textures so these are great.  The lighter colors can come out a lttle streaky.  I think I have bought all of the Kleancolor collections on Amazon.  I have 52 bottles in all, but 2 were duplicates.  Price is great, averaged out to be about $1 per bottle.  Downside is they chip pretty easily so I&#x27;m constantly doing touchups.</li>
    <li> I mostly do water marble on my finger nails but sometimes paint them solid and only doing water marble on one or two nails...These are good for painting nails (with white base coat which I always do regardless of color or brand) the top clear coat just makes these matte colors pop (: and the top coat i ALWAYS use is sally hansen quick dry!</li>
    <li> The Yellow is not Matte Other then that they are great They go on smooth and dry pretty quick. I am quite happy with them. And they price is great..</li>
    <li> Super opaque, nice and creamy, color selection is decent and could use yellow instead of lime green.  And a deep green instead of 3 blues.  That way you can have every color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great for doing nail art when used as a base coat since it will make everything done with glossy polish on top stand out so much more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nothing truly bad to say about this polish other than it needs better variety.</li>
    <li> The colors are vibrant and beautiful, my problem is that with this MATTE nail polish it merely needs to be exposed to the air for about 5 minutes before it becomes so thick it&#x27;s nearly impossible to spread. I&#x27;m not sure if it is like this with all Matte nail polish or just this brand, however, I am extremely displeased with this product. At first I thought it was a fluke that happened with the white bc I used it so much to do French Tips; but now that I have used all the colors , I have discovered this happens with all of them. I recommend that you spend more and get a better product</li>
    <li> Great quality matte nail polishes and dries fast.</li>
    <li> Colors are fantastic and my friends and family all love the new look!</li>
    <li> Gorgeous colors, no dry clumpy crap. These polishes delivered as promised!</li>
    <li> Love ALL the colors &amp; shipping was fast. !!</li>
    <li> This really sucked it wasn&#x27;t good when it came I opened the white it was bad it already dryed up as for the yellow it was a different brand my opinion don&#x27;t waste your money on this</li>
    <li> POOOOR quality!&lt;br /&gt;they NEVER last more than 3-5 hours!</li>
    <li> The quality of the product is great, it goes on smooth and looks very good when dry, the product was also delivered a lot faster than I expected which was a plus. I had some problems with the order because I received some duplicates and was missing other colors but when I contacted them they were super helpful and nice enough to send me the correct colors, very happy with this product!</li>
    <li> Nice colors but they didn&#x27;t gave me the black one, the main color that I was n still looking for instead the add another color that is not show in the picture ugh</li>
    <li> I love these colors. Great quality &amp; great customer support, one of the polishes arrived damaged &amp; they replaced it &amp; sent it to me right away. Thanks!!!!</li>
    <li> They are matte for the most part. Fast shipping! Honestly it&#x27;s not perfect but it definitely worth the price!</li>
    <li> I love the colors but the polish was very sticky it wasn&#x27;t smooth like other  Polish</li>
    <li> Love it.  It is matte, so no gloss. The description is clear about that.  Great polish for the price. Quick delivery and I love the colors.</li>
    <li> This is a great variety pack of matte polish. The only thing I wished was that they also had a green and purple color, but I did not mark down for that as the product probably does not exist.</li>
    <li> i specifically purchased these polishes for stamping. I thought they would be perfect because of their thick consistency. However, for some reason the image wasn&#x27;t transferring correctly onto the stamper. It took me awhile to figure what the problem was. The polish is MATTE, which means that it dries faster than normally. Fast dry polishes are good for stamping, but these matte Kleancolor polishes dry way too fast for stamping.</li>
    <li> no llego solo un sobre vacio</li>
    <li> They dry out and become gooey after a couple uses.</li>
    <li> Beautiful, brilliant colors. However matte finish disappears after few days.</li>
    <li> Love the colors and the price! It just sucks that the nail polish comes off so easily. Other than that, it is a great product!</li>
    <li> Great price for the set! Nicely package. Would definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> Just started working with matte polishes. Remember. ..don&#x27;t use a top coat that is glossy or shiny, loses the matte finish.</li>
    <li> really nice colours good product</li>
    <li> Great but peel off too fast</li>
    <li> Prompt delivery, very well packaged, all colors match the shades pictured well and, with the exception of the bright yellow, are quite opaque even with a single coat. Goes on very smooth and dries to a lovely matte finish.</li>
    <li> Love them! Just got Em today &amp; ordered them not even a week ago! Super fast delivery, pretty colors &amp; none of them are broken! Definitely worth getting 😊</li>
