      <li>I only need one coat when I would use 2-3 with their other kind.</li>
      <li>It really builds my lashes and looks natural.</li>
      <li>It goes on a bit more dry (not as goopey as the other) and the tube lasts longer because you don&#x27;t need to use as much.</li>
      <li>This past year I have had many issues with allergies and eye make up.  </li>
      <li>Natural looking.</li>
      <li>Found this brand there and apparently everyone else loves it too</li>
      <li>This is the first mascara that doesn&#x27;t end up a mess all over the place.  </li>

    <li> Usually, I cannot wear mascara. With this mascara, my eyes do not itch and the mascara does not flake</li>
    <li> Horrible, huge waste of money. Probably the worst mascara I&#x27;ve ever tried. Lasts about 30 min before leaving black smudges under your eyes and starts to look dry and flaky. Cannot believe I paid almost $20 for this. Will never, ever buy again.</li>
    <li> Doesnt irritate my eyes and lasts all day and the price is great when on a budget.  I am so glad I tried this makep line.</li>
    <li> Love this product! lashes are nice and full yet washes off easily with soap and water.. never clumps and doesn&#x27;t smear.. well worth every penny ! !</li>
    <li> Hard to remove.  I can&#x27;t judge as to how it wears in heat and humidity which will be a BIG factor in if I re-order.</li>
    <li> So I love this brand&#x27;s concealer so I thought why not try a clean product for mascara. This one is pretty disappointing. No miracles here. Cleaner products don&#x27;t make my lashes look amazing. Then i tried the lengthening and it&#x27;s not like Dior Show or anything amazing like that, but it is good mascara and clean.</li>
    <li> I prefer this to the Mineral Fusions lengthening mascara. It has a better brush and isn&#x27;t at all clumpy.</li>
    <li> This past year I have had many issues with allergies and eye make up.  Ended up getting most everything at Whole Foods.  Found this brand there and apparently everyone else loves it too - they run out of it consistently!  Stays on well, and easy to remove.  Happy to have found it on Amazon.</li>
    <li> The Mineral Fusion volumizing mascara is the best mascara! This mascara goes on nice and smooth and you get thick lashes without much effort.</li>
    <li> This is so much better than their other mascara. I&#x27;ve had this one for over 3 weeks and still looks amazing. Comes off with ease, doesn&#x27;t flake, perfect separation between the lashes, not too dramatic. It&#x27;s great for everyday wear, and your face will thank you for not poisoning it on a daily basis.  Their powder is fantastic as well.</li>
    <li> Love it. Natural and works super well. I only use this now.</li>
    <li> I have tried Clinique, Almay, Revlon, and finally found this stuff.  My eyes do not feel irritated and it DOES NOT give me a headache. I used to get blood shot red eyes but that is not a problem anymore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It goes on smooth and light weight, you don&#x27;t feel like you are putting lacquer on your eye lashes. I got it at Whole Foods.  Worth a shot, if you can&#x27;t wear it just take it back with the receipt and they will refund your money.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful, thickening mascara.  I am very sensitive to products and have not experienced irritation from this one.  Stays on and does not melt off -- no need for repeat applications.  Washes off easily.</li>
    <li> Good mascara, compared to other brands.</li>
    <li> So far, this is everything I hoped for when hunting for Gluten Free mascara. It really builds my lashes and looks natural.</li>
    <li> I have switched from &amp;#34;dirty&amp;#34; make up to cleaner versions. 90% of what I wear now is from Mineral Fusion. I had used their lengthening mascara in the past but decided to try this one instead. The lengthening one was wonderful but this one is phenomenal. The brush separates lashes and applies the perfect amount to each. I only need one coat when I would use 2-3 with their other kind. It goes on a bit more dry (not as goopey as the other) and the tube lasts longer because you don&#x27;t need to use as much. Will be buying again! Also, I didn&#x27;t buy on Amazon but from a local retailer, just love the product enough to post about it!</li>
    <li> Great product and not tested on animals!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m really pleased.  This is the first mascara that doesn&#x27;t end up a mess all over the place.  Natural looking.</li>
    <li> I have celiacs and have no reaction to this mascara and it is gluten free.  Love it.</li>
    <li> Although not waterproof, this mascara did a wonderful job at not running or smudging even through a few New Years tears! This brand and all of it&#x27;s products are a must for me. Natural ingredients and a good value!</li>
