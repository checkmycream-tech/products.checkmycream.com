    <li> Too perfumey n not smelling of lavender or chamomile one bath filled the whole house with scent. Loved the softness on my skin but hard to relax with the overpowering aroma</li>
    <li> Love this product.  It makes your skin soft and works great to heal my headaches</li>
    <li> Love, love, love this product!</li>
    <li> The smell is no less then heavenly. I love this smell. When I was a teenager I used to love to use my moms up. As an adult I try to always have some on hand. Worth the by I love this</li>
    <li> love this stuff...great for back aches. only problem i have is with the shipping.  they need to tighten up the lids. it was a bit messy.</li>
    <li> I shared my first order with my daughter and now we don&#x27;t want to live without this bath product that smells divine and softens skin.  I have to keep reordering.</li>
    <li> Love it! It is hard to find.</li>
    <li> THIS PRODUCT USED TO BE WONDERFUL.  IT WAS WHITE AND MADE THE BATH SMELL WONDERFUL.  IT IS NOW&lt;br /&gt;LAVENDER AND MAKES THE BATH WATER LOOK DIRTY AND GREY.  THEY HAVE ADDED SHEA BUTTER WHICH MAKES&lt;br /&gt;THE BATH OILY AND SLIPPERY.  I USED TO ORDER IT BY THE DOZEN.  AFTER THESE CHANGES THAT THEY HAVE MADE,&lt;br /&gt;I WILL NEVER BUY IT AGAIN!!!!!</li>
    <li> These arrived in a box, both containers were open and the contents spilled everywhere.</li>
    <li> These bath salts are worth every penny.  They are the absolutely the most fragrant purely Lavender scented bath product I have purchased.</li>
    <li> I really like this body soak, leaves your skin feeling soft and smelling really good.</li>
    <li> I really like this company&#x27;s product overall. This particular scent might be overpowering for some though. It is quite strong and actually would be really great for a foot soak if you have a cold. It certainly cleared my sinuses. Anyway, gross stuff aside -- the salts work as intended. I get horrible aches during the winter and a good soak always helps. However, sometimes these salt soaks leave my feet feeling dry or worse off than they were. I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s much worse than feet that already ache, and then having dryness and cracking too. It&#x27;s not fun! So to my delight, this did not dry out my feet. I actually felt pretty good after soaking, and the lovely scent of lavender and eucalyptus lingered in my master suite for hours after I was done. It was like I had turned my home into a spa. As a mom to several kids, I will take any moments of relaxation that I can get. I would say to those that are sensitive to scents, beware. For everyone else, go forth and soak. This is definitely worth the buy!</li>
    <li> The lavender is the best, it really relax you! The smell is great!</li>
    <li> Good stuff aside from the lid coming off in transit and losing some salts to the box.</li>
    <li> These bath salts have a really strong smell but it is worth it. Because it makes your skin really smooth but it only lasts one day, at least for me</li>
    <li> The caps were not on too tight, causing a little of it to spill out into the box, but that was only a minor issue for me. I loved the aroma, the smooth ~ soothing bath, and the soft skin afterwards. The ingredients were everything I would want in a bath soak. Together, they provide a great start to a long day, a great end to a long week. I will be ordering more in the future.</li>
    <li> Product is good. I have ordered and used the product at least 3 other times. Fragrance,and soothing impacts are my most important values.</li>
    <li> Reordered, as I loved it so much the first time. Great lavender smell, very replaxing.</li>
    <li> Gave this as part of a gift.&lt;br /&gt;It arrived with the cap off and had spilled out of the bag and into the box. The box then leaked salt all over.&lt;br /&gt;It wasn&#x27;t a big problem, it was easy to clean up, but it was still a little disappointing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My friend said she liked it, and it smelled very nice.&lt;br /&gt;(It also made the other things in the box smell nice.)</li>
    <li> Horrible smell. My wife used this and the entire house smelled like an old grandma had a perfume accident. It&#x27;s been banned from the house.</li>
