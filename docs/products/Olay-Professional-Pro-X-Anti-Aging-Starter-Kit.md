<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> love the olay pro x line</li>
    <li> haven&#x27;t really seen any results yet</li>
    <li> Great set - the sunscreen is fantastic and so is the eye cream.</li>
    <li> I have been using these products for several weeks now. My skin feels great and it does seem like some of my wrinkles are smoothed out a bit. I do not see any reduction in dark circles under the eyes as claimed by some other reviewers. I did have a minor irritation at first from the chemicals, but I have somewhat sensitive skin, and the irritation did go away as the box said it would. I think my skin looks better and more luminous and dewy. It isn&#x27;t a miracle but it is a good product that I think would benefit skin it used over the long run by preventing additional wrinkles.</li>
    <li> I have been using this since I purchased and like this product. I have quite sensitive skin, esp around the eye area and this is not bothering me.  I use this along with another product for variety and am happy with it.  It is not greasy and doesn&#x27;t make my skin oily or dry.  Enjoy the product.</li>
    <li> RECEIVED WHAT I ORDERED IN A SHORT TIME PERIOD AND AT A VERY GOOD PRICE (ABOUT $20 LESS THAN THE LOCAL WALMART).  I RATED IT A 3 STAR BECAUSE IT IS A SKIN CARE PRODUCT AND MY WIFE HAS NOT HAD ENOUGH TIME FOR A GOOD EVALUATION.  IF IT PROVES TO BE AS GOOD AS SOME OF THE REVIEWS I HAVE READ ABOUT IT, THEN I WOULD HAVE TO RATE IT A FIVE STAR.</li>
    <li> My wife used the Olay Professional Pro-X anti-aging starter protocol. After the prescribed started period I noticed no difference in her skin. She is not old (28-years old) and only shows very slight wrinkles at her eyes. These were unaffected by the starter period. She described using the starter kit as basically \\&quot;a very nice, bad-smelling moisturizer.\\&quot; The moisturizing effect felt like it had more durability than with the cheap creams. Nevertheless, it is likely not a worthwhile investment for somebody not yet showing many aging signs.</li>
    <li> This is a decent product. I got into Olay mainly because their Total Effects Eye Cream got top (3?) on consumer reports. Since then I figured their aging stuff must be pretty decent for the price. I&#x27;m 22 and there was one wrinkle that bothered me. I&#x27;m not trying to turn back the wheels of time, but I did notice it was always more pronounced when my skin was dry. Pro X does very well at hydrating the skin. It&#x27;s also creates a great routine. Since I&#x27;ve been using this I&#x27;ve noticed a few things: wrinkle is pretty much gone, soft skin, and beautiful shine on skin.     Another note: I started swimming laps in an indoor pool after I started using this product. I think this product helps with the outer layer of skin. Exercise helps with bringing more circulation to the inner layer. The effects of this product seemed to be sped up after I started swimming. Exercise is good in general.    This got a 5 stars from me due to the fact it has done more than I expected it to. It didn&#x27;t let me down. Other people may have more expectations and could have disappointment.         P.S. Check out the Olay website. I got a $20 rebait for this product. They have a lot of other deals as well.</li>
    <li> I usually like Olay products.  However, I am into my tenth week of using the Pro-X regimen, and even though I use it consistently twice a day, I have yet to see one iota of a change (I am using it for lines around my nose).  I&#x27;m in my early 50s, so it&#x27;s not like I have tons of wrinkles that I need to get rid of.  This product is a waste of money--totally and absolutely useless.</li>
    <li> I have been using the products in this kit for about a month now and I see some definite improvement in the dark circles and bags under my eyes which were my major problem. I have sensitive skin and it does make my face itch a little but no big deal worth the results.</li>
    <li> I read the ingredients in this product. Way to many parabens. It could be a good product if they would eliminate parabens.</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with Olay PROx products.  I have tried numerous beauty products over the years, most of which are far more expensive.  Out of frustration from not finding the product that really produced what the product promised I did an engine search hunting for the highest rated beauty products from consumers themselves.  I used Olay products yeas ago when I was young because it was affordable and readily available.  I, like so many consumers believed it had to come from an expensive department store line of cosmetics to work.  I am happy to be back with Olay after all these years and wonder how much better my skin would look if I hadn&#x27;t left Olay years ago when I started making more money!</li>
    <li> Mid 50&#x27;s brings with it dark circles under eyes that seem to be recessing. Harsh lighting pronounces marionette lies. Add to that some blotches and jowls.  I am sure you get the not-so-pretty picture.  I had some previous positive results with Regenerist serum and eye creams until I ran out of product and forgot about it ...until recently.  I understood ProX to be the same as the Regenerist products, only with more oomph. I looked in the mirror; I know I need oomph.      The results from ProX showed up rather quickly. Some positive results were seen within days with no real noticeable improvement since the initial changes.  I am probably a month or so into the regime.      The circles seem less dark but unfortunately my eye also appeared more sunken leaving little bags on the bottom outer under eye that I never noticed before; I wondered if this has to do with the formulary for &#x27;less puffiness.&#x27;  It looks like it sucked the moisture out of my eye sockets.    I incidentally developed dried patches over the bony prominence just below the dark circles; I can not say for sure whether or not that is related to the product.     The hydrating cream does as claimed; I would use that again. It is possible that the dry patches could be resultant of my failure to adequately moisturize that area; starting last night I am putting extra moisture over the dry patches prior to applying the eye cream.     The SPF 30 lotion irritated my skin; I do not know if that is some sort of exfoliative property or just a reaction to sunscreen.    I will continue with ProX until the product is gone.  Maybe I was hoping for too much. I don&#x27;t think it has more oomph.  I will keep looking.  And aging.  So please, keep writing because I depend on your reviews.</li>
    <li> I love this product as well as the price!!  People tell me on a regular basis that I look younger and rested. I share my secret and women love it! This product is much less expensive than other products I have used in the past, and the results are amazing. My husband is constantly telling me how beautiful I look. Thank you.    Respectfully,    Angela McNutt</li>
    <li> This is a good buy, especially if you&#x27;re not sure what you need in a moisturizer. The kit includes an eye cream(it really does reduce fine lines around the eyes), a daily moisturizer with a spf of 30, and a night cream that restores and moisturizes. You can feel and see the difference every morning! Vicki</li>
    <li> The kit is less expensive than buying each of the product separately. The night cream is very moisturizing and the day cream is light and not overpowering. Great for winter! My only complaint is that the eye cream always tends to run out before I finish using the 2 moisturizers so I end up having to use the regenerist eye cream until the 2 moisturizers run out. It is a great product for the price especially after the occasional $20 rebate offer.</li>
    <li> The product arrived quickly and it was less expensive than in the drug store. I&#x27;m enjoying the trial period of olay&#x27;s pro x .</li>
    <li> After reading all the glowing reviews I bought this.  I am in my late 50&#x27;s, and don&#x27;t have many wrinkles, but didn&#x27;t want them to get worse.  No skin care has ever had a bad effect on my skin, but almost from day 1 I have had acne from using this \\&quot;protocol.\\&quot;  I thought that it would clear up, but every day there are new/more zits.  I used it for two weeks, and, if anything, the acne is worse. I am calling the company tomorrow, but will no longer use this product.  I wanted younger looking skin, but not teenage skin!</li>
    <li> My mother heard about this new product and wanted to try it.  I surprised her by making a purchase.  She tried it immediately, and the next morning I could see the difference in her face.  The lines on her face were less noticeable, and her face looks more hydrated.  In addition as she used this Olay daily her skin appeared brighter.  She loves it.  I saw the positive difference in her face and so I decided to give it a try.  I would definately recommend this product to friends, family or anyone.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 64 and used this product for the first time. There definately has been a decrease in my skin wrinkles around my eyes.    The company needs to combine some of the three products in the starter kit as they are applied on top of each other and the amounts in each container are markedly different--making it hard to know how much of each container to apply. With combined products the concentration of medication and the amount to apply would be better.</li>
    <li> Well, i just actually started using this.. however i thought i needed to state a few opinions and clear up some other misconceptions of peoples previous review. As for my opinion, i am 25 years olds, and a freak when it comes to staying looking young. Now, some people are looking for dramatic results at age 50+. Well, its not going to happen. If you now, just in your 40&#x27;s 50&#x27;s decided that after YEARS of sun damage, drinking, possible smoking, not eating like you should, lack of antioxdants in your life..that you WANT TO LOOK YOUNG! this product is probably NOT going to do as well as you would like. (Even the add states not near surgical results). I think this product is indended more for use to start NOW when younger..or even in later age, to help prevent you looking like your 60 when your only 45. Why am i probably right? Read the box... it says for children under 6 months, consult a doctor. 6 MONTHS OF AGE PEOPLE! Studies, not with this product but in general say you should start a child on an anti aging regime around 3 years of age. Crazy huh? Well the SOONER you start.. the BETTER the results years from now. In a previous review there was a 60 somthing year old lady who stated she has been using these products for 40 years and people think she is MUCH MUCH younger.. WHY? because she has been using anti aging products for 40 years! There is no over night or even over months cure for aging unless you want surgery. Im 25, ive been using anti aging products since i was 17. People still think, im 17. I have kids, a stressful life, and i love it when im out in public and people think i took my little sisters out. Granted it also gives me some very bad reactions. But anyways... i just wanted to clear up that these products i believe are much more intended for use over YEARS of time. So that when one day i turn 40... most people are shocked and think its my 30th birthday.     Now, as for how i like the product. I was always a ROC anti aging fan. But i saw this, and started seeing this product at some of the womens houses i know that are in their 40&#x27;s and i always thought they looked so young. So i decided well ill try this out. Im a believer in \\&quot;you get what you pay for\\&quot; and there must be some reason this product is in the $60+ range versus the ROC which is in the $20 range. Unless its simply more for the nice packaging.. but from reviews... ill believe the get what you pay for theory for now.  I am VERY VERY acne prone.. my face still breaks out like a 13 year old boy on occasion, and it TERRIFIED me to use moisturizer of ANY kind because I always wake up with a big pizza face the day after a new product. Well, im proud to say that this has NOT broken my face out! Ive used this twice so far..and woke up the last two mornings just waiting to see that pizza face again.. but nothing! So thank goodness! Now, as for any results so far... im actually suprised in myself for getting to say this..even after two days.. my eyes look tighter and my dark circles are already diminished!, my skin is DEFINATLY not flakey and dry and i dont look like i have a plastic mask on when i put my makeup on from the dry patches. As for anything else... only time will tell. But im definatly impressed on the moisture this puts into my face without the clogged pores and pimples everywhere i usually get after the first use, and the already slightly noticed difference in the eye area. So im truly excited to see where this will head to, granted i cant get to much younger looking for now.. im hoping this product will help me stop dreading the fear of the number 30 i so do. Will update again here in a month or so...   1/3/2010      UPDATE 6/28/2010    Well im a little late on the update, however I did use this product for about 4 months. And now, honestly I am NOT that impressed. Yes, it keeps my skin very hydrated, and the eye area seems to be a tad bit &#x27;tighter&#x27; However for the money, and using it for about 16 weeks, I guess I did expect a more &#x27;tighter&#x27; moresmooth appearance, more smaller of pores than what I ended up having. I actually just switched back to Rocs Mulit Com. Night Cream and for about $40 less than the the Olay kit it did twice over in a couple weeks what I thought the olay kit did in 16 weeks.     So Pros for Olay: Keeps skin very hydrated, and does seem to tighten the eye area without much irritation. Makeup went on smoother.  Cons for Olay: Didnt really make my overall appearance of my skin much different. Pores were still as noticible as ever. Little small wrinkles I had never really changed.. (and they were tiny so with 16 weeks you would expect SOMETHING) Overall tightness really wasnt visable. Over priced for how under efficiant it works. For me anyways.      Pros for Roc: Noticable results with overall complexion and tightness of face within a couple weeks. Pores have shrunk fairly dramaticaly within a couple weeks. Has filled in the small lines fairly nicely for only using this product for a couple weeks. Much cheaper.     Cons for Roc: Isnt really good for hydrating the skin. Irritates delicate eye area in the first week and leaves the skin looking a little scaley if you dont moisturize along with it (which i didnt). Makeup doesnt go on as smoothly as the olay kit let it. However again, i didnt moisturize so if you did im sure this would help.       But anyways im sure EVERYONE is different and depending on your skin type, and perhaps even genetics makes everyone react differently to every product. Which is why I dont give the olay kit a high rating while others praise it. And others dont give ROC a high rating while I praise it.</li>
    <li> Im 44 and take pretty decent care of the skin on my face and have minimal wrinkles and sagging, but my neck/hands look a little weathered from the sun/elements. Today is my 1st day (so i will update again as time goes by) but in addition to putting the eye complex on (felt a comfortable tightening &amp; hydration) and the wrinkle smoothing complex (feels just perfect and saw instant improvement from hydration) i put age repair lotion on my hands and neck/chest. I SAW AN IMMEDIATE improvement in both areas. Im sure its due to hydration, but ive used MANY age-conscious products for these areas and have never experienced such quick visible improvement! I even went outside with the mirror to be sure I wasnt hallucinating! I had a little sticker shock ($59.97 - I didnt buy on Amazon) but am pretty certain it will be money well spent. Now, if only they could make a bath soak, i&#x27;d immerse my entire body! (but did hear there&#x27;s a anti-aging body was avail that I&#x27;ll look into when it&#x27;s time to replenish that)</li>
    <li> My mother used Olay and I&#x27;ve also been a user for over 20 years.  I&#x27;ve been looking at the ProX in the stores but didn&#x27;t want to pay the price... so I checked Amazon.  I knew I wouldn&#x27;t be dissappointed by either Amazon or Olay.  I absolutely love how this makes my face feels.  I also appreciate the convenience of buying the eye/face at the same time.  Once I&#x27;ve gone through this kit, I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll be purchasing the same kit again, again and again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 58 and I lost 24 pounds a year ago.  This caused some new wrinkles in my face.  I was scheduled for a facelift in October but chickened out.  I decided to try ProX when I saw that it came in a kit (moisturizer, eye cream, wrinkle cream). Olay makes so many products, I can&#x27;t figure out which does what and, therefore, which to use. The kit made it simple.  I&#x27;ve been using it for a month or so now.  This past week, three people asked me if I&#x27;d had a facelift.  When I said, \\&quot;No,\\&quot; they asked what I use on my skin.  They each said that my skins looks amazing -- it glows, the color is more uniform, it looks youthful and my wrinkles are almost invisible. I had used Pevonia products before switching to Olay ProX.  Pevonia feels good (and is very expensive), but I didn&#x27;t see any noticeable difference in my skin and no one commented on my skin. I&#x27;m amazed and very happy with the results I&#x27;ve gotten from the Olay ProX Starter kit. I&#x27;ve decided to use it on my hands and arms too and see what happens.</li>
    <li> After three weeks of use, I can tell a difference in my face.  I will keep using this product.  I&#x27;ve tried several things and so far, I like this one best.</li>
    <li> Just so so The  price was right but I won&#x27;t buy again as I don&#x27;t see any change  I am glad I didn&#x27;t pay the store price for the products  Delivery service was excellent</li>
    <li> I began using these products about one month ago and plan to continue.  I like the way my skin looks and feels.  Easy to use and the eye creme doesn&#x27;t burn the eyes.</li>
    <li> Forget the really expensive stuff they sell at the department store cosmetics counter.  The Olay Pro-X system works great for my face and doesn&#x27;t cause breakouts.</li>
    <li> This product seems like it&#x27;s working. But it is really too soon to tell anything. I noticed a slight difference already though. I will update this as I continue to use this product.</li>
    <li> Finally an anti-aging cream that does what it purports to do at a reasonable price.  No miracles but definetely a nice result.  It is nice to purchase a product that delivers! Try this stuff before you spend hundreds of dollars!</li>
    <li> This product did not live up to my expectations! I bought 2 kits, one for me and the other for a XMAS present for my daughter. I bought it after reading reviews that it faded brown spots. NOT!  The brown spots are still there.  My face does not look any more luminious than before. It only gave me bumps on the side of my face.  An added BONUS!! My daughter has not seen any major results. I wanted to returned the product and get my money back, but I did not save the box which has some kind of code on it which is a requirement to return product!! Rip off. DON&#x27;T BUY IT.</li>
    <li> About my skin: fine lines and wrinkles, some loss of firmness, overall oiliness especially in the \\&quot;T\\&quot; zone. What I liked: the eye cream, which worked as well as comparable department store brands. I did see improvement in the fine lines around my eyes, and in the firmness of the skin. What I did not like: both the day and night creams caused multiple acne blemishes within two days of starting to use the products. (Wrinkles AND pimples...oh, joy.) The products did seem to work in terms of improving skin firmness and reducing fine lines; however, they do not seem to be meant for oily/sensitive skin. I had to stop using everything but the eye cream.</li>
    <li> The eye lotion is light and goes on easily.  The day lotion smooths into the skin well.  The night cream is not too heavy.  I like this starter kit also for the sizes.  The eye and day lotions can be used for travel.  I will probably still use a sunscreen with this set, but it works well, not too heavy.    I&#x27;ve had good luck with other Olay products.  I&#x27;ve tried more expensive ones (Lancome, Chanel, Natura Bisse) but Olay works well.  I&#x27;m please with this set.</li>
    <li> so far as I can tell, This stuff does no better a job than other creams that are cheaper and more easisly available in the supermarket.</li>
    <li> I only began using these products about 2 weeks ago.  I really haven&#x27;t seen any difference in the physical appearance of my skin yet, as many other reviewers commented, but my skin does feel soft.  All 3 formulas in the starter kit are easy to apply, feel silky soft and absorb quickly into the skin. The starter kit is a great option to be able to give the product a try w/o having to purchase full-size.  This is a plus because the products are not inexpensive.  The red box of products also contained a $10 off coupon for 2 full-size products which does not expire until 2010. I have been using Olay products for many years and I am hoping to SEE results soon.</li>
    <li> One thing I would NEVER skimp on is my moisturizer.  I&#x27;ve been an Estee Lauder girl for years.  I tried this kit and have been amazed at what it has done for my face.  I am almost 60 years old.  The starter kit lasted for 2 months for me.  I use it twice a day.  The skin around my eyes is so tight compared to what it was that it&#x27;s hard to believe.  The face creams have made a difference in the look and feel of my skin too.  This kit, combined with the Regenerist Sculpting Cream for the jaw line only, have made me an Olay convert!!  Amazon has the best price around.  Order it and give it a try.  You won&#x27;t be sorry!!!  If you don&#x27;t like it for some reason, Olay will refund your money as long as you&#x27;ve used it for 30 days.  I don&#x27;t normally write reviews, but on this one I had to pass it along.  Amazing stuff and reasonably priced.</li>
    <li> I have tried other products but this one really seems to do the trick for me.  My skin looks beautiful and I&#x27;ve gotten a lot of attention and questions about \\&quot;what&#x27;s my secret\\&quot;.  I love it.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product back in October of 2009, it is now January 2010 and I have seen substantial results. In the past I have tried everything from Neutrogena, Avon, Loreal, and some expensive products purchased at department stores. In other words, I have a slew of \\&quot;anti-aging\\&quot; products in my possession. I grew up in Denver, CO, which is said to make your skin age faster due to the high elevation. Couple that with seven years of tanning beds and beach sun, and my 31-year skin rates at the skin of a woman in her mid-40&#x27;s. I have very fair skin with freckles and burn very easily. I spent a slow path to building a constant a base tan at a tanning bed until one day I saw the ultraviolet light behind me when I look at the mirror and saw all of the damage done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was very desperate and after seeing the commerical and the guarantee, I thought I would give it a chance. I purchased the eye restoration complex, age repair lotion with SPF 30, and the nightime wrinkle smoothing cream. I am faithful to using these products. Whatever is in the product, it does work! I use the treatment in the morning with the and eye restoration cream. I wait 10 minutes before applying makeup to allow the product to work it&#x27;s magic. My results have been decreased lines around my eyes, more even skin texture, less acne breakouts, and the lines smoothing around my mouth. I have just ordered a tube of the deep wrinkle treatment and will follow-up on how that works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am not one to write reviews on products, but take my word, it is worth it&#x27;s weight in gold.</li>
    <li> Good Price&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like this set</li>
    <li> Love the Olay Pro-X antiaging regimen.  Been using it for a couple of years and my skin looks great! The starter kit has the necessities in easy to travel with sizes.  Very handy!</li>
    <li> After 10 days of faithful use, I developed an allergy to the night cream...bumps around my collar area and on the side of my face.  It was worse with the eye cream.  The skin around my eyes was drive-you-insane itchy, and because the cream is so strong, the wrinkles underneath my eyes became more pronounced as the cream sucked any last iota of moisture I might have had there.  To add insult to injury, people asked me if I&#x27;d been crying - and that was after a shower and the whole skin regimen in the morning, without a stitch of make-up.  The eye cream simply doesn&#x27;t moisturize, full stop, and it&#x27;s not for someone like me who is sensitive to some products.  Even the cheap dollar store eye cream I still have is better than the one in the Pro X line.  I ceased using all three products and immediately switched to my \\&quot;first aid\\&quot;:  Vaseline (yes, Vaseline) under my eyes with that same cheap eye cream over it.  I now don&#x27;t look like I haven&#x27;t slept in a week.  The day lotion with the SPF?  Meh.  It isn&#x27;t anything to shout about.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I won&#x27;t recommend this starter kit or any of the Pro X products in it to anyone, and I certainly won&#x27;t be buying it again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always liked Olay skin care products and was eager to try the Pro-X line when it first came out. Unfortunately I found the higher price made it difficult to sample.  I wasn&#x27;t sure which product to invest in for forty-plus dollars, so I  ended up not trying any of them.  When I found the Anti-aging Starter Kit, on Amazon I was thrilled. Not only was it affordable at 28 dollars, it was also an opportunity to get acquainted with more than one of the products. I&#x27;ve been using the kit for a month now and can say that I am very pleased and impressed with both the daytime cream moisturizer and the intensive nighttime moisturizer.  I would buy each of them again. My skin feels smoother and appears brighter. The day cream feels both light and rich and has 30 SPF protection.  I find that I&#x27;m using less make up and my skin appears more fresh.  When I wake in the am, my skin is very supple and soft from the nighttime moisturizer.  I highly recommend both products.  That being said, I am not  impressed with the eye cream.  It is overly thick and takes a very long time to absorb. I often end up skipping it, because it just doesn&#x27;t feel good to apply.  I would not purchase the eye cream separate from the kit but I am glad I had the opportunity to sample it at an affordable price. The two moisturizers work so well that even without the eye cream, I still feel like the anti-aging moisturizer creams were a bargain.</li>
    <li> The three products in this kit are very good.   I can tell a real difference in the texture of my face, neck and eye area.  I have been using it approximately three weeks and certainly will continue to use it.  Good products!</li>
    <li> Excellent product I recommend</li>
    <li> I am usually skeptical of face creams/treatments, but have been using this for a week and can actually see a difference in my skin.  Wrinkles seem to be fading and the overall look of my skin is healthier.  It has reduced the puffiness under my eyes as well.  It does not leave your skin feeling greasy after you put it on.    Great price at amazon compared to buying it retail in a store where it seems to be going for around $60-70.</li>
    <li> I accidentally dropped some of this stuff in my bath tub just before I had a bath. When I woke up in the morning I got a shock. Sure my wrinkles had all gone but- sleeping next to me, I found that my 84 year old husband Jack had turned into a naked (warn out) 25 year old boy-so this stuff really kicks ass!</li>
    <li> I love the Pro-X Eye Restoration Complex. I am 63, and one day looked in the mirror to see this horrible woman looking back. She had sun spots, puffy eyes with black underneath and the jowls hanging.    I started Renova, ProX Eye Repair and some Regenerist and Definity products. I like them all, but love the eye cream. It took awhile before I realized there was a difference. The black will probably never be gone, but it is not noticeable now as long as I get enough sleep. The puffiness is also improved. My skin tone and texture are much better.     I am also using a STOP machine on a fairly regular basis. As long as I keep up the regimen, it takes years off my looks, and my pictures come out much better too. Very pleased. I am going to try more of the ProX products.[[ASIN:B001FT3OZI Olay Professional Pro-X Eye Restoration Complex .5 fl oz (15 ml)]]</li>
    <li> Oil of Oley is always my 1st choice!</li>
    <li> I have found that my face did not break out when I started using this product.  So far I am very satisfied with my purchase and plan on purchasing it again.</li>
    <li> I have been using the Olay starter kit for several weeks and am very pleased with the results.  My skin is extremely soft and looks creamy.  I&#x27;m 47 years old and have been prone to occasional breakouts but lately my skin has looked clear and smooth. The neatest thing has been the reduction in my under eye circles.  They seem to be less prominent which for me is amazing! The lotions absorb well into the skin and do not feel greasy at all.  My skin stays supple all through the day. I really like the entire set and will gladly order it again.  Can&#x27;t beat the price either.  I would definitely recommend this kit.</li>
    <li> I tried this only because of Olay&#x27;s refund offer if dissatisfied.  I am 65 years old and don&#x27;t expect miracles, but I liked it enought to keep the kit and order some of the full sizes.  PROS:  Simple routine, no odor to the products, the eye cream absorbed very well and seemed to blur my crow&#x27;s feet and make them less noticeable. The day cream wasn&#x27;t heavy or greasy and had a decent SPF. The night cream was also light and non greasy.  CONS:  No drastic results, but I believe my eye area showed a bit of improvement after the first month.  I ordered full sizes of the same 3 products and will continue monitoring my progress (or lack of).    AUGUST 2, 2009 UPDATE  These products are very gentle with no irritation, but I don&#x27;t see any long term improvement in my crow&#x27;s feet, undereye wrinkles or any other wrinkles.  When I apply the eye cream the eye area seems smoother, but at night when my skin is washed and free of all products the \\&quot;improvement\\&quot; isn&#x27;t there.    I don&#x27;t know if I will continue with this regime.  SEPTEMBER 6, 2009  I have finally concluded that this line of products doesn&#x27;t work for me.  I returned 2 of the items to Olay for a refund recently.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for about two or three weeks continuously.  I have noticed that my fine lines are getting softer.  I am going to continue using this product and I hope to really notice a difference after a couple months of use.  I am 32 years old and don&#x27;t have too much aging to deal with so others have not really commented on any change but I can see a difference when I look in the mirror after my makeup is removed.  Also, my face seems to have an even color about it.  It does not look as blotchy as it did before.</li>
    <li> Received product in a timely fashion.  I just purchased this product.  They say you have to wait 30 days to see results; therefore I will have to post back to rate product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Neutrogena anti-aging products for forever. Olay&#x27;s entries into the anti-aging debate have usually been a huge \\&quot;meh\\&quot; for me, but I think they might really have something here with the Pro-X line.    Of all three products in the regimen, the Wrinkle Smoothing cream was a true miracle. My skin, well cared-for by years of Neutrogena care, totally revved up with only a week of diligent application. There was a nice glow to it, and it was obvious enough that people actually noticed! (How often does THAT happen in real life?)    My skin is good, and this really made a difference. The texture of the cream is wonderfully rich, and a true little luxury to use.     The Age Repair Lotion was nice, but I wasn&#x27;t too fond of the way my make up went over it. That could just be because I didn&#x27;t give it enough time to sink in, since I&#x27;m usually in a rush to get ready for work. The Eye Restoration Complex sank in instantly; it had a nice effect and made the skin around my eyes very smooth.    The price of this kit is very reasonable for the products, and it&#x27;s an excellent value and introduction to anti-aging skincare for the newbie.     I still adore Neutrogena&#x27;s line, but the Pro-X products are definitely making me look twice. I&#x27;d recommend these products without reservation.</li>
    <li> This product made me break out horribly.  My only skin issue has been that I am in my late 40s and seeing dryness issues.  I have tried many, many products, from inexpensive to expensive.  I decided to give this product a try because it is much more convienent to purchase.  The nighttime cream feels okay, but I wake up in the morning with breakouts.  The daytime cream feels like it has sand particles in it, and really almost feels as if it dries me out.  The eyecream is just ok; feels sticky actually. If you feel you have developed any type of dryness or irritation in your skin this product is to be avoided.</li>
    <li> I was very satisfied with the price and the time it took to get my order,I would definately order again</li>
    <li> I have been using Olay product for years.  I really wanted to try this Pro X starter kit, but it was kind of expensive. But then I found it for such a great price on Amazon with free shipping, I just couldn&#x27;t say no.  I am very happy with the product and especially price.  The kit contains the eye cream, a day cream and a night cream.  A little goes a long way.  Well worth trying.[[ASIN:B001JQLNNW Olay Professional Pro-X Anti-Aging Starter Kit]]</li>
    <li> I did much research before I decided to purchase the pro-x anti aging starter kit. I have used Avon, Reversalist system, Lancome anti-aging products as well. Although the Avon, Reversalist worked for a while, I noticed that it was just to oily for my normal skin and begin to just sit on top of my skin. The Lancome anti-aging, did nothing for me but eat my pockets up. Pro-X is awesomeness. I love the way it smooths my skin and primes it very well for the Lancome Dual Foundation that I use (which works very well with the Pro-X line, if I may add). It glides effortlessly over the Day moisturizer which has the spf in it. I am noticing that the wrinkle filler is starting to work after 3 weeks and so this is good (I have forehead lines). The night time cream is amazing in that during the first week I noticed smoother skin in the morning. Seriously, I want to talk about the eye cream. Best Ever! I thought I was sold on Philosophy eye creams, but sorry ProX eye cream is the bommmbbb! My eyes began to look repaired after the first week. The dark circles are really diminishing (finally). I do want to say that I did experience peeling the first couple of weeks around my nose, but I expected this because of the ingredients, its working to exfoliate. My skin overalls look more healthy after 3 weeks, it has an amazing glow, my pores are definitely minimized. I do use religiously. I also want to say that I use the Olay Regenerist Detoxifying Pore Scrub with this Pro-X system and after I apply the ProX day moist. and Pro-x wrinkle filler, I wait about 3 minutes and apply the Regenerist Olay \\&quot;Filing &amp; Sealing\\&quot; wrinkle treatment as well. I let this sit for another couple of minutes and then I apply my Foundation. Flawless!&lt;br /&gt;I am 44 years old, I will be 45 in Feb 2012. I just wanted to take a moment to say that this stuff works.</li>
    <li> So far the ProX formula feels good... but it hasn&#x27;t been long enough to tell whether it creates results or not.  I CAN say that Amazon definitely had the best price for the product that I could find online!  And it arrived very quickly.</li>
    <li> I love the eye cream, its the only thing that has solved my eye lids since they were burned.  Even the doctor&#x27;s didn&#x27;t help!</li>
    <li> Finally I found a product that does what is says it supposed to do. I&#x27;m 64 and I had wrinkles from years of smoking,now my friends are  noticing the difference too. After 30 days I still have a lot left, it spreads no evenly.</li>
    <li> With these kinds of products, it&#x27;s always a wise decision to approach with some caution. A lot of them use sometimes harsh chemicals to perform their work leaving the user red and sore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Olay Anti-Aging Starter Protocol, I&#x27;m very happy to say, works exactly as advertised with no problems. For starters, this is not a fragrance-heavy product like some I&#x27;ve tried in the past when putting up with a strong perfume is an overwhelming experience.&lt;br /&gt;Application is a delight because it&#x27;s not heavy or greasy but a light and pleasing texture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How about the results? After almost a month of use, I find my skin smoother and definitely firmer although I can&#x27;t report on the wrinkle-smooth effects because (thankfully) I don&#x27;t have any wrinkles. If it works as advertised and as it has so far, I will definitely continue its use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Five, well-deserved stars.</li>
    <li> Pro x Testimonial Letter    I started taking your products 3 months ago.  I have enjoyed the results and feel my facial skin is a lot tighter and younger.   I love how I look and feel.  I love your product.   One of the amazing side benefits is what happened to my warts.      I have had two warts on my right and left thumbs for over ten years.  These warts were large and ugly.  I did not want to show my hands to anyone.  I have also had a planter&#x27;s wart on the bottom of my foot for the past 30 years.   This wart grew to a size of a silver dollar.  It was a half an inch deep into my foot and I had tried everything in the world to get rid of it.  To no avail, I just lived with it and cut at it.    After 3 months of applying your cream to my face, not my warts, I noticed the warts on my finger going away.  Then I looked at the bottom of my foot and saw that the biggest planter&#x27;s wart in the world was gone.     I don&#x27;t know what ingredient caused my warts to vanish, but whatever it is may help millions that have these bothersome warts.  I know your product promotes beauty for the face, and first hand I know it does even more than that.  Totally, unbelievable!!!    I am a completely satisfied customer in more than one way.  This may be another avenue to look at in promoting your product. Also, at my last physical they were amazed that any sign of the HPV virus was gone,    Sincerely,    Terri Montgomery</li>
    <li> I have been using this new Olay kit for a few weeks, I&#x27;m very pleased so far. It hydrates my skin better than any other brand I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
    <li> I think that Olay has tried to come up with a way to make more money off of its highly acclaimed Regenerist line.  Not only I can detect no improvement in ProX over Regenerist, but I&#x27;ve seen more breakouts on my face.   I must admit that I&#x27;m 65 and have taken good care of my skin in the past, so perhaps I shouldn&#x27;t expect any improvement at this point.  Bottom line:  don&#x27;t waste you money on this higher priced line.</li>
    <li> I started using this product about 3 weeks ago and I love it.  I can see the results.  I will continue to use this product</li>
    <li> I have been using the products in this starter kit for almost two weeks and can already tell a difference in my skin. My face feels much softer and moisturized and seems to be smoother. I like that there is not much of a scent and especially the way the wrinkle smoothing night cream feels. It doesn&#x27;t feel thin and water but not to thick or oily feeling either. In the morning my skin feels good and refreshed. I have used numerous products over the years including most recently Arbonne and Estee Lauder. I had heard good things about the new Pro-X line and wanted to give it a try.     Amazon is great; the price of this starter kit on Amazon is $20 less than what I saw it for in drugstores. I am very pleased with the product so far and am excited to see the longer-term results. I took a picture of my face before and will take one at the end of the month to see if there is a difference.</li>
    <li> I like Olay Products.  I have used them for years.  I used this product for one month. It did make my skin solf.  I didn&#x27;t see a change in my wrinkles.  But I am an older woman (73) and have a lot of wrinkles.  I think a younger woman started this product early would benefit from useing this product.  Amazon had the best price on this product.</li>
    <li> This product represents a problem in American culture. It seems people are sheltered by the bubble created by corporations who can afford to advertise. All we know is what is in magazines, on the TV, or on the radio. There are thousands of more products which are far superior to Olay out there that really do not exist to most people because they do not advertise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The spf day moisturizer is a chalky white lotion that does not blend smoothly into the skin, and if you have some stubble on your face, it looks like you washed your face with milk. When you finally get the milky stuff to dissolve, you find that when you sweat you have white creamy sweat running down your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The eye cream had no effect on my under eye wrinkles or dark circles and for the record neither did Estee Lauder&#x27;s highly expensive Idealist Illuminator.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other facial night cream did make my face look hydrated and didn&#x27;t leave a milky residue in my face; of course this is the best of the three.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I strongly recommend another product to future buyers, and do your research.</li>
    <li> I got caught up with the advertising and decided to give Pro-X a try.     I am approaching late 30&#x27;s and so far I have no wrinkles, and I want to keep it that way for as long as possible.  Been using this for a year now, I haven&#x27;t seen any deepening of lines around mouth or on forehead, no crow&#x27;s feet. Skin feels softer.  My eyes have dark circles, always had, no improvements there, and the skin around my eyes is dry. If I don&#x27;t use it for one day, it gets dry again.   The night cream is really rich, I feel the cream on my skin in the morning when I wake up.  I get the occasional pimple followed by a blemish the creams do nothing to immediately clear blemishes, but blemishes completely dissappear after a couple months.   I like the creams, I guess I won&#x27;t know for sure if they work until I get to 40 and I can tell if my skin still looks like it did when i was 35.</li>
    <li> I have read the negative and not-so-positive reviews. All I can say to them is that they must have other issues besides the natural aging process.  Alcohol? Drugs? Sun exposure?     This product, and its sister - the Olay Regenerist line - have been a Godsend. I am truly a convert. I was ready to go under the knife, EEEK! I live in LA!!! But at the advice of [...] I tried this moderately inexpensive product.  OMG!  Happy here!  And it just keeps getting better.  I started with Regenerist in October...moved to Pro-X later. No regrets, although if they had not developed the Pro-X line I would have been delighted to follow the Regenerist protocol!    My Grandmother used Oil of Olay in the 1960s.  Swore it was the best.  She died at 69 - and looked 45.  This product..this company...rocks.  They are HERE for us!    Seriously - my wrinkles are receding, my skin is silky-soft, and my sexy self-esteem in renewed!</li>
    <li> this is a great product. Easy to use, non-greasy, absorbs into the skin rapidly. Skin feels softer and more supple.</li>
    <li> You know you&#x27;re getting old when you start using products like this. Actually, I wish I had started years ago. Having oily skin well into my 20&#x27;s made me winkle-free for most of my life...but now a new winkle appears here and there...as is normal...but you may be surprised that they start to bother you a bit,even if you&#x27;re not the vain type.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, I love the pretty red packaging of this kit. Red is a beauty color to me, like red lipstick.  Second, I love the fact the scents of the items are so mild I can actually use them. Any scent of beauty products that isn&#x27;t citrus usually gives me severe headaches. The daytime cream with sunscreen actually smells a bit like a suntan product to me. And the winkle cream smells like a mild version of Solicane cream...a product I can&#x27;t find any longer. And, oh, how I would love to have a bottle of that right now...not for my face, but for my dry hands.  Nothing worked better. I actually tried the Olay winkle cream on my hands the first time I used it, including applying it to a crack in my finger.  It burned!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On my face, however, it does not burn; and it does a very good job of keeping my face moisturized, even in the cold winter, with electric heat everywhere. (I use to just use baby oil in the shower.) The daytime cream works very nicely, too.  The eye cream, I can&#x27;t really tell if it&#x27;s doing anything.  But I&#x27;m applying them all religiously, and will return after a month to edit this review, since one&#x27;s face is suppose to show the difference by then. But really, no cream can get rid of winkles, can it?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over A Month Later:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This kit obviously has made my skin look much smoother and softer. I think my skin color is better, too.  It&#x27;s a great kit to have in the winter, with electric heat everywhere drying out your skin.  When it&#x27;s all gone, though, I&#x27;m afraid I will not be able to afford the full size products.  I&#x27;ll probably just use a cheaper Olay cream...the one they keep saying is better than a $700 cream in tests.  But it looks like it will be a while before I use up these sample products...like maybe months!But it looks like it will be a while before I use up these sample products...like maybe months!</li>
    <li> Olay makes some nice products. Often the scent added to them will make me break out. These most certainly did not. SO if you are looking for an anti-aging regimen and other products have irritated your skin, these might be a good choice for you.    I never know exactly how to review a product like this. How can one tell if it has staved off the effects of aging? I can say that it was an easy regimen to follow and I do think my skin is softer and the dark circles under my eyes have lightened a bit.    Do I look like a movie star? Nope (always think of that chunky woman with wild, thinning hair in Educating Rita who sat in Rita&#x27;s chair and pointed to a picture of Princess Di and said, \\&quot;I want to look like that.\\&quot;) But I suppose, I might look more supple than I would otherwise.</li>
    <li> I liked this product, it made my skin more even toned and very smooth, the diminishing of fine lines and wrinkles wasn&#x27;t as pronounced as I would have liked, but I will stick with the product and may see more results in more time.</li>
    <li> Living in Canada we have extremes of cold, and dry.  I have been a faithful Vichy product user, but now at 33 I am finding I needed something for lines, luster, and tone.  I tried the Pro-X line for one month, and I love it.  My skin is smooth, luminous, and I can see that the small fine lines around my eyes have been smoothed.  I use these products wtih Vichy Yeux moisture tube and with the Vichy Aqualia Therma riche over everything.  I loved the Olay Pro X so much I have just bought the proper size tube of Eye Restore and I am trying the Deep Wrinkle target therapy.  I recommend trying this product, I was really pleased with it.  I would continue to use a heavier moisturizer over face and eyes (Vichy) over the Olay SPF cream, as our indoor climate is extremely drying in the winter.  Its really lovely to look in the mirror and feel my skin is in lovely shape, it looks good.</li>
    <li> Listen, no matter what anyone says, no one and no thing can turn back the hands of time! That said, there are things one must do to make that slide down that slippery slope a wee bit slower, a bit less painful. Stay out of the sun, wear sunglasses, drink water, wash your face with gentle cleanser and for goodness sake, moisturize! You absolutely must moisturize!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Olay is an excellent manufacturer of moisturizing skin products. Olay is serious about it&#x27;s research and not frivolous in it&#x27;s stated benefits. It is a company that offers an excellent product for a reasonable price....no frills, luxury packaging, fragrance or pushy sales force. Olay is sold at drug stores not department stores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you purchase the Olay Anti-Aging Starter Protocol Pro-X kit you will get three excellent skin care products for less than $65. This is about as good as you are going to get....unless you are going to a dermatologist who will prescribe Retin-A or Renova.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you use these three Pro-X products you will be using a very good moisturizing night cream, a soothing eye cream and an excellent moiturizing sunblock day cream. You will look better and you will be protecting your skin. Thats what you are going to get.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Olay makes a confusing array of products. I have tried most of them and I have to admit that I find most of them impressive! As good as fancy, department store brands at many times the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Is the Pro-X Wrinkle Smoothing Cream in this kit better than Olay&#x27;s top-rated Regenerist Micro-Sculpting Cream? I find the Regenerist line excellent! The Micro-Sculpting Cream is a wonderful moisturizer. After using it my skin is soft and smooth and feels great. I have found almost no difference between the two creams.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Olay also makes the Definity line of anti-aging products. I am a big fan. I find my skin is even and glowing and soft and smooth after using the Deep Penetrating Foaming Moisturizer. Small spots lighten or disappear over time. I also like the Definity Eye Illumiator which not only moisturizes but somehow lightens the undereye area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, I have confused you? I am confused myself!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think that the most important thing is to take care of your skin. You don&#x27;t have to spend a fortune in the process. This kit is a good value and the products are excellent and they are formulated to work together. They will not make you younger but they will protect your skin and keep it healthy and attractive at any age.  That&#x27;s pretty good, isn&#x27;t it?Illumiator which not only moisturizes but somehow lightens the undereye area.     So, I have confused you? I am confused myself!

    <li> I purchased the Olay Professional Pro-X Anti-Aging Starter Protocol Kit after reading positive reviews on this product on several sites.  I have used Olay products for several years and had the expectation (based upon the product description,the consumer reviews, and the price) that this protocol would be far superior to other Olay products that I have been using for years.  I was sadly disappointed.  I have used this protocol kit (the Amazon purchase was my 2nd kit) along with the Pro-X Deep wrinkle Treatment for approximately 9 weeks now and have seen absolutely no change or improvement in reducing dark circles under my eyes or in reducing the appearance of fine or deeper wrinkles.  Don&#x27;t waste your money on this product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve seen good and bad reviews for this product but I&#x27;ve been using these product since May and after 4 months of using these products I literally had 6 people accuse me of being in my 30&#x27;s over a 3 week period.  These products are the only change I&#x27;ve made and I was reluctant to expect anything.  Two thumbs up for sure.  I&#x27;m 46 and can&#x27;t tell you how wonderful it feels to have people think I&#x27;m in my early 30&#x27;s.  One person even thought I was in my 20&#x27;s.  Maybe they were fibbing just a bit but I&#x27;ll take it!</li>
    <li> I have now finished with my first purchase of this product.  I bought the entire Pro-X Anti-Aging Starter Kit because of the products it contained -- and how they targeted my problem areas (especially the eye cream).  All of the products enclosed have been exceptional. . . thus, my reason for buying this set again (and, of course, for the rebate coupon offered by the company).</li>
    <li> I think I was expecting miracles or maybe my 29 year old skin wasn&#x27;t as bad as I thought.  I didn&#x27;t notice any change after using for more that a month but I&#x27;m more at the preventative stage of life.  I like this lotion but I&#x27;m not sure it is worth the high price tag for me.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t expect to like Olay Pro X but it really leaves your skin luminous.i will be buying this again.</li>
    <li> Took at least 4 weeks and broke out a little in the beginning but my skin is just glowing!  Hyperpigmentation spots are at least 50 percent faded.  Very happy.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not normally one to use lotions like these -- it seems decadent, somehow -- but I am impressed with the results. The skin on my face looks less dry, which makes the small wrinkles I have look less noticeable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The three lotions included in this kit are not at all greasy. They are light and unscented, and blend easily into your skin. I enjoy using these products, and feel comfortable recommending them.</li>
    <li> Hmmm, what can you say about \\&quot;Age Repair Lotion\\&quot;?  I mean it feels creamy &amp; I&#x27;d love to think it&#x27;s doing it&#x27;s job, but don&#x27;t you kinda have to question anything that takes natural wrinkles from aging outta your face?  Or for that matter should I really be critcal if I don&#x27;t see results over night?  Sounds good on paper &amp; all with the SPF 30 blended within, but... ?  Same goes with the \\&quot;Wrinkle Smoothing Cream\\&quot;.  This is supposed to over time smooth wrinkling (not completely take them away, just smooth them), but so far in my experiance it&#x27;s just made my face oily.  Best outta the box is the \\&quot;Eye Restoration Complex\\&quot;.  If I were to purchase any of the products again singly it would be this one for sure.  The \\&quot;ERC\\&quot; is supposed to take away puffiness &amp; dark spots around the eye area (again, not completely), &amp; I can definately see a differance since I 1st started using it.  A little side warning out there for everyone, this definately doesn&#x27;t feel good when you get it in your eyes, so be careful of that.  In the end, would I buy the whole package again?  No, probably not, not because I hate it or anything, just don&#x27;t know that I wanna invest in something without any immediate results.  I would however definately buy the eye cream again.  In closing I guess it&#x27;s really about what you need &amp; what you&#x27;re after, one things for sure though, the eye stuff works.</li>
    <li> Now I know it sounds odd for a guy to review an Olay anti-aging product and so I&#x27;d like to stop you right here. I took this cr&amp;egrave;me for my wife and positioned myself as the observer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Quickly I started noticing a transformation. Within days her skin become more rejuvenated, her smile brighter and my heart more joyous. When I kissed her cheeks, I noticed an extra softness to them. I also noticed her face get clearer, its texture smoother. There was no longer oils and in fact I observed an air of new self-confidence. I have to say she is quite pleased with the product and is ready to order another package.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend it for your spouse.</li>
    <li> First let me  say I do NOT have sensitive skin. I have never had problems with any product. But after only 3 days of using this product I started breaking out.  I noticed little white hard bumps on my face and around my eyes. They are called Milia.     Milia are deep seeded white bumps that form when skin cells become trapped rather than exfoliate naturally. The trapped cells become walled off into tiny cysts that appear like white beads below the surface of the skin. The most common reason milia forms is from smothering your skin with heavy skin care products or hair care items. Comedogenic creams and lotions may prevent the sloughing of dead epidermal skin cells.Hidden problem products include make-up removers not labeled oil-free or non-comedogenic, hair spray, hair mousse and gel, heavy sunscreens and some moisturizers.    I contacted Olay to find out if these products where Non-Comedogenic. They replied That they could not say legally it was non-comedogenic but they didn&#x27;t think it would clog pores, because it was tested by a dermatologist. Not sure what that means, tested doesn&#x27;t mean passed. anyway, I stopped using the product. Started using a Avon Micodermabrasion product, made sure all of my moisturizers and make-up now say non-comedogenic or will not clog pores. The Milia has started to be go away, but this has been a very unpleasant experience.    Never the less I was disappointed. Like I said I have never had problems before using this product.</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B001TJOFUC Olay Professional Pro-X Anti-Aging Starter Protocol]]    After working for a well-known cosmetic company in a department store, I had a hard time finding a \\&quot;drug store\\&quot; product line that I thought could compete.  Finally, Olay did it.  My skin feels really smooth as well as the fine lines around my eyes.  I&#x27;ll probably try the other products in the line.</li>
    <li> After two weeks of using this kit, I&#x27;ve noticed an improvement in the smoothness of my skin. Dryness in the under eye area has also lessened somewhat. I have not noticed a reduction in \\&quot;dark circles\\&quot; however.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The eye cream is a good base for concealer in the daytime, and a soothing evening treatment. The night cream leaves skin with a silky feel, and it does appear to \\&quot;brighten\\&quot; the complexion, at least until you wash it off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The SPF lotion is blessedly lacking in the nasty odors some sunscreen products have, and is fine for wear under makeup. (Allow to dry thoroughly if you&#x27;re using a powder-type foundation.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, the products are pleasant to use, but they are not inexpensive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will have to give them the \\&quot;bottom of the jar\\&quot; test before I decide if I would purchase additional kits.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For now, four stars for the noticeably smoother skin, minus one star for the non-brightening of dark circles.</li>
    <li> try it and you will be hooked.  perfect size for travel.  I does what it says it will and the lotion has spf in it .</li>
    <li> While wrinkles aren&#x27;t quite an issue for me just yet, I do spend enough time outdoors in the sun to start taking pre-cautions on the inevitable degradation that my facial skin will face sooner rather than later.  With these concerns in mind I&#x27;ve been utilizing Olay&#x27;s Pro-X anti-aging kit for approximately the past few weeks and have really enjoyed the results thus far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This kit comes with 3 products - a facial moisturizer that I use in the morning that also provides 30 spf protection; a creme that is applied prior to retiring at night and an eye creme to ward off those pesky crows-feet.  So far i&#x27;ve been utilizing on a daily basis the first 2 products and within 10 days of use have noticed an upgrade to my facial skin by way of more even tone, softer and smoother texture and all around a more healthy, glowing appearance.  I am certainly pleased with the results and have docked 1 star from my review due to the fact that I am not quite in need of the eye creme and therefore wished that they had a 2-item kit as an option alongside their 3-item kit.  That said, this is good stuff and your skin will thank you for regular application of it!</li>
    <li> This is a great price for these3 items. I really like these Olay products , I think they work. I like this starter kit as it includes the eye cream -- which does not burn -- if you get it in your eye.</li>
    <li> I used this along with another Olay product. I didn&#x27;t see amazing results as promised. They have all these special charts and photos... NADA! My skin was still the same. I Tried the Tehani Salon skin care and anti-aging products. I found those to be better Amazon Products.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve gone back twice to buy this product. I feel like it works and my skin feels better than ever. I&#x27;l be back to buy soon. Amazing product.</li>
    <li> I love that I have smaller sizes to try out this wrinkle cream line.  Must have been attractive to a worker at my house &#x27;cause he stole the little tube!  But who can blame him?  I noticed results right away.  I plan to get another tube to use with the other two products.</li>
    <li> olay is a great fir wmen of m</li>
    <li> Quite simply, the ProX products made me throw away all my other products, which were alright, but did not do the job as well as ProX. My skin feels moisturized and looks healthy for my age. A big big plus for me, is that ProX does not have a perfume smell or strong odor, so many products have a strong odor that I cannot stand wearing them on my face. I had sensitive/dry skin, after 2 months, I like the way my skin looks and feels, definately a worthy product for this active, outdoors girl!</li>
    <li> I have used Olay PROx for 6 weeks now and love how it makes my skin feel and look. I am 63 and can use all the help I can get to keep my skin looking younger.  Olay PROx seems to be doing that for me. I have signed up for monthly shipments, which gives me a discount, making this great product very affordable. Thanks Olay!</li>
    <li> I have been using this Pro-X kit faithfully and as directed for 3 weeks. I&#x27;ve been waiting and watching for a noticeable change and I finally got it in the form of acne. I&#x27;ve used primarily Olay products for years and have not had this problem before. If Pro-X is meant to make you look younger by putting you through puberty a 2nd time, then I guess it works. I much prefer Olay Regenerist (less expensive too) and I will go back to using the complete line. My favorites are:    Olay Regenerist Night Recovery   Olay Regenerist Daily Regenerating Serum   Olay Regenerist 14 Day Skin Intervention</li>
    <li> With a name like Pro-X I am imagining that Olay has targeted this as a more serious and professional level product to compete with the luxury brands such as Dior, Elizabeth Arden. Certainly, the packaging is very upscale and the red color has a wow factor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have had a great experience with Olay Regenerist Age Defying series of products. Especially [[ASIN:B0000CC64W Olay Regenerist Daily Regenerating Serum, Concentrated Amino-Peptide Complex, Fragrance Free - 1.7 fl oz]. I have been a fairly regular user of this serum for 2 years and love the results. I don&#x27;t need it for wrinkle repair yet but it keeps my skin soft and smooth and really silky. People always comment on the glow when I use this product more regularly. I usually wear it at night and sometimes mix a small quantity with makeup for day time use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Pro-X set seems to be essentially the same product as the Regenerist range. Perhaps it is a bit more concentrated and will give better results over time but it is hard to say after trying for just 2 weeks. I would prefer the serum if they made it without the SPF 30 factor, so it could be more colorless as that feels really silky (rather than milky) and works better with makeup. The night creme and the eye repair cream are both great products and are also irritation free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, for 3 products I think it is a good value when you see the results. Over time I am sure this regimen will yield great results and diminish fine lines and would work especially well for 45+ women. A much better solution than Botox!</li>
    <li> As always fast service with receiving this product from Amazon. Love the Olay products, feel great on my face, and really like this new Anti-Aging Starte Protocol, Pro-x Kit.</li>
    <li> This is the latest product from Olay for \\&quot;aging\\&quot; skin care.  It is an excellent moisturizing system and very easy to use and keep up with.  Buying through Amazon was a better bargain than at local retailers as well.</li>
    <li> Background- I am 38 and have been told I look good for my age.  I have olive and oily skin but not prone to breakouts.  I do have some discoloration from many years out on the beach and have some fine lines around my eyes.  I got Botox and IPL treatements a few years ago before my wedding and I loved the results however I cannot afford to do that on a regular basis and I don&#x27;t want to end up with a freeze face as I call it.  Too much Botox is not a good thing.    Fast Forward- The effects of my IPL and Botox treatments are long gone.  I have tried many lines of beauty products, studied ingredients, etc. When I heard about Pro X, I decided to try it.  For the price, it&#x27;s really not bad considering what I have paid for dept. store brands. I had a $5 coupon and a $25 rebate so it was a $31 investment.     I have been using the \\&quot;starter kit\\&quot; for just about a month now and this is what I have observed:  *Tightening of skin around eyes/crowsfeet- yes, my neighbor asked my husband if I had got shot up with Botox!  2 other friends of mine wanted to know what I was using on my skin.  They said I look refreshed.   *My skin is more even toned and pores appear smaller- I say \\&quot;appear\\&quot; because your pores can&#x27;t shrink and don&#x27;t buy anything that says it will SHRINK pores. Also, my skin has better clarity and it&#x27;s more even toned.  This product does not claim to cure hyperpigmentation but it really has improved mine!    *My skin is moisturized, glows- I have oily skin and these products are not oily at all.  Also, I have psoriasis so fragrance is a NO NO!  I don&#x27;t need a break out on my face.  I also like the fact that the product seems to absorb rather than SIT on the surface of my skin.  It just feels good on my skin!    All and all, I think this product, especially the eye cream and night cream are exceptional!  The daytime moisturizer is great but I prefer a tinted moisturizer (my preference- MD Skincare Tinted Moisturizer with SPF 20, worth every penny! ).    I don&#x27;t use Olaycleansers as I prefer Cetaphil, Witch Hazel and Baking Soda (YEP) for exfoliation.  My experience with cleansers is simple is better.  Also I believe their cleanser have fragrance.   I will continue to use Olay Pro X religiously!  Everyone will have different results of course but my experience has been nothing short of exceptional and NO MORE NEEDLES!  It&#x27;s the first time I have written a product review and this one I felt was worth sharing.</li>
    <li> Loved this, but have found something I like a little better  --  who knows?  I might go back to it yet.  It IS great.</li>
    <li> I think this regiment is meant to be used over a long period of time for stable results but all ready I am enjoying a nice glow and even tone from this new super kit from Olay. I can tell right away if I like a cream, it really takes one or two applications to see that it&#x27;s good and lush. Both the lotion and cream from this kit is very emollient and silky, it feels soothing and nourishing and I enjoy applying it in the morning and night. The eye cream is also good but I always need something thicker if I wear makeup, for some reason the skin under my eyes is really dry and if I don&#x27;t apply my Burt&#x27;s Bees Royal Jelly Cream right before it, I have dry and tight skin, especially if I&#x27;m at work, starting at the computer screen all day long.    My skin is mixed but tends to be little dry and this is nice and rich, but might be little too much for those with oily skin, so keep in mind when purchasing this. Overall I just started using it but so far I love the products, can&#x27;t wait to see my face next month ;P</li>
    <li> Well, I&#x27;m getting to that age where \\&quot;anti-aging\\&quot; takes on a whole new level of importance.  So I was glad to receive this item.    The good news is, it really works!  My skin feels better, looks better, and as the result of another review I took the test of photographing myself and yeah, my improved skin even seems to be apparent in photos.  ;)    That said, I&#x27;m kind of a lazy person when it comes to adhering to a regime, and I have doubts whether I&#x27;ll go through the motions for much longer, but that says more about me than the product.  Just be aware that there are three \\&quot;elements\\&quot; to this product and success seems to be dependent on the user handling them all correctly.  I&#x27;m happy that none of the three elements are greasy or have unpleasant or strong scents.  (There is some unidentifiable but perfectly pleasant smell, however.)  The price - around $60 at the time of this writing - feels pretty fair.  I&#x27;ve used more expensive products which did not offer noticeably better results.</li>
    <li> My mother normally uses shiseido products, but was given this to try and see if it would work better or be comparable.  She does not have too many wrinkles, but she wouldn&#x27;t mind having less.    After using this kit since receiving it, I can&#x27;t really tell the difference.  She likes the feel of it, and it doesn&#x27;t have any strong odors.  It doesn&#x27;t sting when using, and not greasy or oily when using she says.      I can&#x27;t say she looks 10 years younger from using the one sample kit, but she likes the product.  No anti-aging kit will work in one shot, and long term use is probably best so 1 kit won&#x27;t tell the entire effectiveness of this product.  We&#x27;ll see how it goes after more use.  Olay is a trusted brand, and she recommends giving it a try.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t see any difference in my skin.  Instead it makes me break out.</li>
    <li> I had been using Oil of Olay Pro-x acne kit  for years which is now discontinued and impossible to purchase. I contacted Oil of Olay as well as read reviews for Olay skin care that worked the same. This is the kit that was highly recommended to work similarly. Wrong!!! My 60 year old skin was young and beautiful before I used this kit. Now it is red, splotchy, broken out with pimples/blackheads/sebaceous cysts, and horrible to feel and look at. I don&#x27;t know what to do or what products to use on my face that worked as well as pro-x. I am scheduled now to see a dermatologist for answers.</li>
    <li> I like many of Olay&#x27;s products but I don&#x27;t feel that this one lives up to its hype any better than any other skincare products. It&#x27;s a little pricey for what it promises to do. I have used this regimen for 60 days and have not seen any changes in my skin. The products were easy to use and apply. I did like the spf 30 in the day lotion. 60 days is plenty of time to see whether a product will work or not. For me it didn&#x27;t. i think these products are better for women in their 30&#x27;s and early 40&#x27;s. I am 56. I have gone back to using Avon ANEW Ultimate skincare and am much happier with that.</li>
    <li> This review is from a guy&#x27;s perspective - which might be unique.    In today&#x27;s economy, first impressions can be key- male or female. With the use of this product, I found similar results from those I get at a dermo Dr., and better than expensive department store brands.    I found Olay&#x27;s system to greatly reduce my problem area&#x27;s: the forehead area,and under eye &#x27;puffy&#x27; problems or circles.    Fine lines were diminished, or eliminated within a week. The eye area looked better with the 1st application! I have found the results to be ongoing.      The product DOES NOT have a scent, which is a huge PLUS.     The products are easy to slip into a gym bag, or just use or share at home - this one is NOT just for the ladies!  Trust me! This is a GREAT product!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Regenerist  or Total Effects lines for years and have been very pleased, however I started using the Pro-X line and recently I was out with a group I got carded for the first time in many years,  I&#x27;m 40 and one of the people in the group exclained \\&quot;She&#x27;s like the oldest one of all!\\&quot;  I guess it&#x27;s working as an opinion from the outside, not just my own perception.  Not too heavily perfumed, has worked well for my sensitive skin that tends to be on the dry side.  A bit over packaged, but with the rebate offered it was a very good value.  Will continue to use along with the Regenerist Serum which I won&#x27;t part with.</li>
    <li> My wife loves this product, and i really feel her skin improved, she got this new glow and firmer skin. And i think her age spots also gone. I would recommend this product to every woman.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know how much any of us can really \\&quot;stop\\&quot; aging, but I&#x27;m willing to give it a shot. The Olay professional line of products claims that it&#x27;s scientifically proven to stop the signs of aging. So, do I look any younger? No. But my skin is soft, and it doesn&#x27;t smell chemically, which is always a nice plus. But at nearly $50, this collection doesn&#x27;t do nearly what I&#x27;d expect. If you&#x27;re in the market for a reasonably priced anti-aging line with much the same benefits, I&#x27;d stick with Neutrogena. Their product reliability is comparable, and you won&#x27;t have to shell out the big bucks.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product faithfully for about 5 weeks now and I can see a very definite improvement in my skin texture, less wrinkles, and overall tightness of my skin.  It feels and looks great!  I think this product is excellent for anyone to use, young and old!</li>
    <li> I really like this kit and will be purchasing it again. My skin feels softer and its not dry. It wasn&#x27;t very dry to begin with, but with other systems I have used if you didn&#x27;t put the moisturizer on right after you washed your face it felt tight, that does not happen with these products. I am in my late 20s, I don&#x27;t have bad wrinkles, but I am trying to prevent them from getting any worse. I can&#x27;t say that after using this for a couple months that my wrinkles are gone, but I still really like the appearance and feeling of my skin. I would recommend this product for sure!</li>
    <li> Summary: After using this product for three weeks, I have elected to stay with the regimen constructed by my dermatologist: Renova (for exfoliating dead skin and building collagen) and CeraVe (for moisturizing). While some may find this cost prohibitive, I will elect to invest a little more in my skin-care to achieve optimal results. A study recently conducted by Allure magazine agrees.     The details: With Renova running about $200.00 per tube and Olay claiming comparable results, I decided to take a break from my usual regime and try Pro-X. The results simply paled in comparison. My skin simply lacked the luster and smoothness that Renova delivers. Moreover, while Renova is odorless, there is a slight medicinal note to the Pro-X products. (I&#x27;m curious if that scent is added to give the consumer a feeling that he/she is using a product that is comparable to prescription \\&quot;medications\\&quot; or if it&#x27;s merely a result of the ingredients).     Who I think this could see results from this system: I have always been devoted to proper skincare. When I entered my 20s, I began yearly trips to the dermatologist to ensure that I would never have \\&quot;play catch-up\\&quot; with time. Ten years later: Renova was/is worth every single dollar. (And when used properly, peeling is very rare). However, if you have been neglecting your skin for years (by sun-bathing, not wearing a SPF daily, smoking, drinking etc...) and want to change your habits as well as the quality of your skin, I believe you will see results with Pro-X. No, it will not be the same as visiting your local dermatologist, but it will be a close second. So, PLEASE, skip the expensive department-store creams (like Chanel, Clinique, Estée Lauder, etc...), they are nearly as expensive as Renova (if not MORE expensive) and do not have shared results. (Kinerase is the exception here ... dermatologists do recommend this product for diminishing fine lines and improving texture).     If you do not have medical insurance and do not care to pay for a visit to the dermatologist (it can be pricey, I agree), try Pro-X and expect results.     The caveat: Allure magazine recently conducted an independent study of Pro-X (which alleges to give similar results to Renova). (See this month&#x27;s issue). The results: after 24 weeks of using Pro-X, subjects saw a 25% reduction in the appearance of wrinkles ... but the results were not as dramatic as those who use Renova. (However, subjects did not experience the potential dryness and peeling that can result from over-applying or overusing Renova).    So it&#x27;s pretty much about your expectations and your priorities (and the state of your finances). Pro-X will deliver results to those who have seriously neglected their skin. Pro-X will not deliver results to those who have been vigilant (i.e. obsessed with optimal skin health).  If you are tempted, then I say, try this product ... and (whatever the results) return here and post your experience!</li>
    <li> I am familiar with many skin care lines- Lancome, Nivea, Clinique, Estee Lauder, Elizabeth Arden, La Prairie, to name a few. Sure, they are all nice, but the price can be high.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;About a year ago, a reputable group tested many of these skin care creams.  The overall winner was Olay ( Regenerist I believe?)-big surprise. It won the No 1 spot over some very pricey creams.  And  they did make the point that high price did not mean better  (they even tested the extremely expensive $250/oz creams).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A few years ago, I started trying out more &amp; more of the Olay products.  They have gone way beyond that pink lotion from the 70&#x27;s  to 80&#x27;s.  Their skin care lines are lovely, rich, and absorb well into the skin. And they are quite remarkable.  Their Definity &amp; Regenerist lines are terrific.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was curious to try this new addition to their lineup:  Pro-X.  I am very pleased with it.  As my skin has had some bad reactions to some high priced creams-discontinued due to rash or comedones (a.k.a. bumps or pimples), I usually patch test a bit on my arm first-- a dot or so). If OK 24 hours later, I&#x27;ll put it on my face and eyelids.  So, I am happy to report that this is well tolerated &amp; quite nice. No problems at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I follow the directions for day &amp; night use. Although,  I have found that putting Olay&#x27;s Regenerist under the ProX night care may provide added benefit. With this ProX line it is possible that the results might be quite good overall.  (I&#x27;ll try to update in a few weeks.) I have also applied this cream after using an exfoliant (other brand) and am quite pleased to note a new softness to my face.  That&#x27;s always nice!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am especially pleased that a small amount of this cream covers the skin nicely and is well absorbed. There is no greasy mask feeling to this at all-no smears on the pillow, either. So, if something isn&#x27;t thick and greasy, I am more likely to use it steadily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A word about the packaging- I like the Red containers-more importantly, they are easy to store, open, &amp;  apply.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In Alaska,  it can be pretty dry in the winter. This is a great cream to combat winter dryness!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very glad that fine skincare is accessible and more affordable!&lt;br /&gt;With skin care-high price does not mean better!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Later on:  Face looks good. No intolerance to product. No rash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I read a few other reviews. I&#x27;d like to add that I have been very diligent taking care of my skin since the teen years.  Always used a good moisturizer.  (not every night, but more so mid 20&#x27;s). I guess I got spooked by a TV ad that said \\&quot;For that skin over 25\\&quot;-horrors!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even so, I would say there is a significant nice soft feel to the skin after exfoliation (a few times a week)  &amp; application of Regenerist serum, prior to use of Pro X (again, not every day).  I&#x27;m familiar with most skin care lines and I find this to be quite good. Price certainly is an issue-especially these days!

    <li> So far, I have not used the full ProX system.  I was finishing Obagi products and mainly using the eye serum.  I love it.</li>
    <li> To start, I wouldn&#x27;t call this \\&quot;Anti-Aging\\&quot;.  It does make your skin nicer, but the effects disappear as soon as you stop using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That being said, my skin was much nicer after having used it -- but I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s worth the cost involved since they give you such anemic amounts of the stuff.</li>
    <li> I ordered this for my mother, whose skin has aged tremendously in the past few years as a result of sun exposure, lack of nutrition, and poor self maintenance in general.  The quality/price ratio of this product leaves something to be desired.  The eye restoration complex was by far the best in the three-pack, and within two weeks, there was significant improvement in the lines around her eyes, along with a reduction in puffy darkness, even on the little sleep she gets.  My only complaint about the eye restoration complex was how small the tube is, even if a little does go a long way, the price of the package as a whole is a bit of a deterrent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wrinkle smoothing cream did not seem to work very well on a consistent basis, and actually caused a break out as other users have reported.  Some days the wrinkles seemed to be reduced while other days they actually seemed worse.  No real appearance of overall improvement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Age Repair Lotion?  As far as my mom reported it was really just sunscreen that helped soften her skin, but otherwise didn&#x27;t seem to do a whole lot; or at least nothing evident.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think that the price of this package is not enough to get me to buy this for my mom again, based on the fact that she really only liked the eye cream.</li>
    <li> All of the creams are white and unscented.  They go on smoothly, are absorbed quickly, and left my skin feeling nice.  The night cream is a little thicker and shinier.  The daytime cream absorbed without any surface residue; good for under makeup.  Most facial moisturizers with strong sunscreen have a strange texture to them, the Olay Pro-X does not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The big question is: is it doing anything?  I&#x27;d have to say something is definitely happening, though I&#x27;m not certain what.  My first use stung a bit, and subsequent uses have on occasion, depending on what I&#x27;ve cleansed with prior.  After a few days two moles got inflamed. (Which was disturbing!) But then they settled down.  After that I started to break out in a few places, something I almost never do.  That passed again after another week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a month now, what lines I have *feel* shallower to my fingertips, though I don&#x27;t know if there&#x27;s any difference visible.  For reference, I&#x27;m 38 and look pretty young for my age.  Possibly someone more mature would show more benefit.  My skin also looks a little more fair, possibly?  Though being in the middle of winter might be having its own effect too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The eye cream didn&#x27;t do anything for the circles under my eyes, but nothing ever has, so probably not a useful test.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I like the kit a lot, and I&#x27;m going to be sad when it runs out. I&#x27;m self-employed and work out of my home, so my appearance doesn&#x27;t matter enough to justify the cost of buying more. But, if I was concerned about looking youthful, or it mattered to my career, I would definitely keep using it.</li>
    <li> Oil of Olay really out did themselves this time!  Olay ProX is fantastic and worth every penny.  In the first couple of weeks, the wrinkle cream really did smooth out the fine lines and after 4 weeks the eye cream really made a noticeable difference in the dark circles, bags and crows feet.  Thank you Olay!!</li>
    <li> I bought the kit and then I went out and bought the color corrector and the deep wrinkle cream.  I&#x27;ve been using them for almost a month and I&#x27;ve not seen any results or changes.  I didn&#x27;t see any reduction of pigments spots or wrinkles. Maybe it would make more of a difference if I had untreated skin.</li>
    <li> I have found the products to be  more moisturizing and it seems to be helping with lines a a little bit, though not enough to make up for the much higher price.  If they would lower the cost it would make it much more desirable.</li>
    <li> My wife wrote this review:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product claimed to tighten skin, brighten undereye circles and improve the appearance of fine lines.  I used the 3 phase system for 3 months and found slightly less than dramatic results.  I did notice a lessening of fine lines around the eye area but it definitely didn&#x27;t give the extreme results that the product claimed.  The overnight heavy moisturizer did an OK job of keeping my extremely dry winter skin hydrated though I still found myself using Cetaphil (my \\&quot;go to\\&quot; product)  I do expose my face to bitter cold, harsh winds, and dry air.  I do like the sunscreen prep cream.  It had a high enough SPF but wasn&#x27;t heavy and greasy and absorbed quickly.  The product claimed to fade age spots and though it wasn&#x27;t as dramatic as I expected.  I would compare the 3 phase system to Garnier&#x27;s facial products.</li>
    <li> If only the starter kit had bigger portions of each item, then it would be perfect. This is a great product.</li>
    <li> Feels sticky. Did not help with dark circles under the eye. Would not buy again.</li>
    <li> Do yourself a favor and go with the Olay Regenerist.  This stuff isn&#x27;t worth it.</li>
    <li> I am 43 years old and have been searching for what seems like forever to find the right products for my face.  I have used expensive face care and drugstore brands and nothing seemed to do what it claimed to do!&lt;br /&gt;These products are light and non-greasy and gives me a more youthful glow!  In addition, this is the best price for the kit I found! For all you ladies out there still searching.....it stops here!</li>
    <li> Fantastic product and a great value.</li>
    <li> I have used Oil  of Olay since high school. I am now 60 years old. my skin is in great conditions. I have a few wrinkles but only 2 bad ones. I had not used oil of olay for a couple years. I was working and decided for no reason at all to try some face product on tv. Never made a significant change. I tried 2 of them. I have finally gotten back to my Oil of Olay. I&#x27;ve been so happy and my skin just feels better with it.  Thank you Oil of Olay and amazon.com yvonne</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t see any positive result after I finished all. My skin color is an olive-yellow skin tone and dry.</li>
    <li> Still awaiting final results, but I am 29 years old, and am already seeing a difference in my skin after about a month of use. Helps to keep skin from drying out for sure.</li>
    <li> Good starter kit and you cannot beat the price.  I recommend it to anyone and it includes spf ingredients as well</li>
    <li> after a few time&#x27;s use,I can say that I enjoy it very much, no less than the other expensive products.</li>
    <li> I am 43 and don&#x27;t think this product is very good. It did not give the results I thought. I have found Dr. Brandt products to be better. Yes, they are more expensive, but on this one, you get what you paid for.</li>
    <li> I buy this for my mom every time she runs out. I actually first bought it for her without asking her if she wanted to try it. I took it to her when I visited for Thanksgiving. She used it for the next month and when I saw her next at Christmas, I could actually see her face was brighter, more even toned, and tighter. She is already the most beautiful woman in the world, and this kit really makes her glow like the angel she is inside.</li>
    <li> This is one of Olay&#x27;s best products. And believe me, the best price anywhere is at Amazon!</li>
    <li> I like that it doesn&#x27;t leave my skin oily. I see a difference in my wrinkles already.  My skin feels so much smoother.  I will buy this again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried this for about three weeks now.  People have noticed a difference in the lines on my face.  The crow&#x27;s feet are filling in nicely!!!</li>
    <li> I have been using the Oil of Olay Pro X products for eight months now, and I have seen no improvement whatsoever in my skin.  The wrinkles are still as visible as they were before I began using the product.  Sure, it moisturizes the skin, but so does a regular moisturizer that costs much less.  Please don&#x27;t promote removing lines when the product does not.</li>
    <li> I have used Olay before &amp; love it. I know its great. But yet I went out tried the pricey junk that did nothing! I could kick myself! But this Pro X is like man from heaven! The next morning my skin fely soft &amp; dewy. A first for me. For those of you who have oily skin you know what I mean LOL. This \\&quot;DEWY\\&quot; feeling was totally new to me. After the first week I was like \\&quot;Hey!\\&quot;. My skin actually has a healthy glow to it. I don&#x27;t have to put on foundadtion if I don&#x27;t want to (and I am 44 yrs young). My friend think I did something. I finally had to give in &amp; tell the Olay ProX. I love you guys. I will never stray again!</li>
    <li> It works and doesn&#x27;t irriate my skin. I shopped around, decided to do the auto shipment &amp; got the lowest price. Oil of Olay often has a $20. off coupon so I buy 2 and get the extra $20. Makes me a very happy shopper in this world of high prices...</li>
    <li> I use a lot of Olay, so devcided to try thiskit. I was satisfied with it and will probably use it again when it comes on sale.</li>
    <li> I use all of these products on a daily basis. My skin is so much smoother and softer and I do notice a slight reduction in wrinkles. The sun screen is great for protection too.</li>
    <li> Fast Shipping. Love it.</li>
    <li> I love the night cream and especially the tube of wrinkle cream. Since I have been using the tube of wrinkle cream on my upper lip the fine wrinkles from smoking have greatly smooth out, I never would have believed it! I don&#x27;t smoke anymore which helps too and had read up on all those anti-wrinkle creams for around the mouth, this one got one of the better reviews and so for I have not been disappointed.</li>
    <li> Love this product has soften my lines dramatically. Obviously not going to take away my lines all the way, but really like the results.</li>
    <li> My wife have started to use several Olay Prof Pro-X  product since a year ago and she satisfied with the result.</li>
    <li> Always Olay - can always count on it!  I use many of their other products so I feel very confident with these!</li>
    <li> I bought the starter kit as a birthday present to myself. After two months of daily use, I am delirious over the appearance and condition of my skin.  I&#x27;ve tried just about every major product line, and have always found something that just didn&#x27;t work for me:  no such problem here! While the cost might be off-putting to some, bottom line is that this stuff is awesome (without having to carve out time and money for the dermatologist and the pharmacist). The best compliment I&#x27;ve had is from someone I hadn&#x27;t seen for a while:  after studying me for a few minutes, she confidently stated, \\&quot;You&#x27;ve done something.\\&quot; Used conservatively (less does more), these products are very cost-effective. I know there are people who say that cheaper Olay product lines work better for them.  Fine:  that leaves more Pro-x for me!</li>
    <li> This is my second starter kit and it lasts a long time and it is a wonderful product. I was spending lots more money before on Lancome and not getting near the results.</li>
    <li> I am in my mid-twenties and live at high elevation where the elements can be very harsh on your skin.  That being said I have seen the number of wrinkles on my face increase significantly, (even though I used to wear Aveeno SPF 30 daily face moisturizer every day) in the past few years. I decided something stronger might be necessary to keep my face looking young. I have been using this product for 3 weeks and have seen fine lines diminish, and my skin is much softer than it was before.  Even if I skip the moisturizer in the morning/night, my face did not dry out as fast as it did with previous moisturizers. It maybe has evened out some discolorations.  The crows feet around my eyes (minimal to start) are still there, and the deep wrinkle in my forehead is still there, but maybe not as prominent?  They say it takes 6 weeks to take full effect, so I will update in a few weeks, but am happy with the product as of now, and the price was awesome!</li>
    <li> Remember the little bottle of pink Olay? That didn&#x27;t cost very much, but it always made my face look better. It didn&#x27;t have all the great ingredients the &#x27;new&#x27; Olay has, but it felt good, smelled good, and my face looked good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now of course I&#x27;m older and that old bottle of pink Olay I&#x27;m so nostalgic about might still feel and smell good, but it might have the same results I got years ago. EDITED to say that they do have it. It&#x27;s now in a box and called Hydrating Fluid I think, and it&#x27;s of course more expensive. I bought some today, because I remember it fondly. :)  We&#x27;ll see if it&#x27;s as good as I remember. It doesn&#x27;t small as good as I thought it did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said, this is a good product with excellent ingredients. I don&#x27;t like it as much as I like RoC, but that may be, as another reviewer mentioned earlier, because I&#x27;ve always been diligent about taking care of my skin. It is already in good shape, for my age, so I didn&#x27;t see a remarkable difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do think it&#x27;s worth giving a good trial, unless we can get them to bring back that sweet little bottle of pink Olay at the same cost we got it at way back when.  :)</li>
    <li> How can you go wrong spending half of what you would at a drug store for this kit.  Your skin will be thanking you and people will be asking what you&#x27;re doing to get the youthful glow.  Seriously.</li>
    <li> Great price and a great product. This is the best price I have seen for this product anywhere. Loved it!</li>
    <li> I ordered the ProX line purely based upon the TV commercials.  I figured the Starter Protocol would be a \\&quot;safe\\&quot; way to try the ProX line without having to \\&quot;invest\\&quot; too much money in it.  And if they work, I&#x27;ll order the regular sizes and use this Starter Protocol for travel.    I tried them right away upon receiving them today.  The Eye Restoration Complex was light but \\&quot;burned\\&quot; my eyes a bit as if there&#x27;s menthol.  The Wrinkle Smoothing Cream went on very thin and I didn&#x27;t feel my face receiving \\&quot;nourishment\\&quot;.  The cream also burned my face a bit with the same menthol-burning effect.    A few hours later, I tried the Age Repair Lotion SPF 30.  It felt oily and appeared white - much like a sunscreen that I had to rub it in.  My face and forehead looked oily and they turned pinkish red as if I&#x27;ve been under the sun.    After 10 hours, my face and forehead were still pinkish red so I decided to wash them off and went back to my Olay Regenerist Regenerating Serum and Olay Regenerist Eye Lifting Serum which work better for me.    My skin is toward the dry and sensitive type.</li>
    <li> I was first skeptical on using this product because nothing else has ever worked, but within the first week of using this kit, my face was much more softer and my under eye circles were starting to diminish.  It has now been a full month and I cant believe what a difference your eyes make when their not all puffy and dark, Ive actually gotten compliments thaf I look younger, as far as wrinkles go, I dont have many but I have the noticed the ones on my forehead are not as deep as before.  I would highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping, item as described.  Plan to buy again.</li>
    <li> I have problems with these anti-aging products causing breakouts, like small whiteheads. Good products. No miracles though to write home about. My puffy under eye circles may have improved some.</li>
    <li> And she loves the product which comes at a very reasonable price and will surely buy it again for her.</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t started to use, but the effect should be good, just keep a little too short, during,I am very happy with preferential price for it</li>
    <li> I was told about this product in March by my friend--I&#x27;m 29 years old and I must say, it has done wonders with my skin! The clarity has improved tremendously; it even helps with breakouts! My skin has transformed--it&#x27;s never too young to protect your skin. It&#x27;s not oily, great feeling on skin, LOVE IT! Plus, the price on here is half the cost as in the store!</li>
    <li> The starter kit was a good price but I would not pay full price for Pro-X.  I have been using Oil of Olay products for many years and found them to be excellent.  The items in the starter kit are good but...they don&#x27;t give me any better results than Oil of Olay&#x27;s Age Perfect cream, which is sold at a more reasonable price. The starter kit is worth a try but for me, I wouldn&#x27;t waste my money on full-priced Pro-X.</li>
    <li> I used it for about 3 weeks and it didn&#x27;t do anything with my face and under my eyes.  Maybe it was bc it was only 3 weeks but I would think you would see something by then.</li>
    <li> I have used Olay products for a very long time and I love them.  This particular kit gives me every thing I need for am and pm in one kit.</li>
    <li> The anti-aging starter kit was exactly what I wanted (and actually needed).&lt;br /&gt;I searched the internet for the best price on the items I wanted and of course, found them at Amazon yet once again.</li>
    <li> Wouldn&#x27;t buy again, used it, but not much difference</li>
    <li> In general, Olay&#x27;s Pro-X line of products really meets consumer expectations. I am trying two different sample sets in this line; &amp;#34;Intensive Wrinkle Protocol Kit&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;Anti-Aging Starter Kit.&amp;#34;  Both kits are identical but instead of the intensive wrinkle cream in the &amp;#34;Intensive Wrinkle Kit&amp;#34;, the &amp;#34;Anti-Aging Kit&amp;#34; has intensive eye cream. If I was smart, I would have purchased ONLY the &amp;#34;Intensive Wrinkle Protocol Kit&amp;#34; and just bought a separate eye cream to try.  Compared to the intensive wrinkle cream however, the eye cream is just an eye cream. No big deal.</li>
    <li> Love this product. Works great.</li>
    <li> Nice starter kit to introduce you to these products.  I love the way my skin feels when using these products. Definitely notice the fine lines around my eyes and lips becoming less noticeable.</li>
    <li> I started to use this product line after going through the product questions on the Olay web site. After using for a month I can actually see a difference. My skin is firmer and the deep wrinkle between my eyes is much lesser. This is really worth the money! and very easy routine to follow.</li>
    <li> I hope I never find out what the secret ingredient is in this stuff because it works so well, I would have to un-know that fact if it turned out to be something horrible. This product has returned my 43-year-old skin to state a resembling its former self. It has imparted the dewiness that my children have in their skin. I can best describe it as a slightly tacky feel that is moisture actually staying in the layers of the skin, rather than sitting on top of them. As I got older, my skin stopped being able to absorb things put onto it easily. Even finely made oils could not really do the trick, though I have tried a few really good ones. Nothing has thus far done what Pro-X has done. It is not cheap but I have paid far more for things that did far less. I have used this starter system for two weeks and the results are so good I have stopped wearing foundation. My T-zone issues are disappearing and my skin is finally happy again. No burning. No stinging, and I am starting to see some fading of sun spots or freckles or whatever it is we are calling them these days. The skin around my eyes where crow&#x27;s feet are just starting has plumped up a bit. And that&#x27;s 2 weeks in. Recommend.    UPDATE: 3 months later    My skin is very, very happy. It&#x27;s looking much better than it did. I have good fading of most of my age spots and my laugh lines are, if not gone, greatly diminished around my mouth. Crows feet are really improved too. Bought this starter again because the first lasted so well. Got the brown-spot fading treatment as a free bonus here on Amazon. Solid recommend.</li>
    <li> All I can say is WOW. I am truly amazed. For the first time in my life I have found a product that actually is doing what it says it will.  I am a youthful looking 38 year old, but I have always had &#x27;baggy&#x27; eyes and more recently, a darkening underneath (from stress, aging...)     I have tried EVERYTHING - Rollerballs (all types), Caffeine, vitamin K, primer, collagen, Retinal A, eyelift creams, extra creamy moisturizer.... EVERYTHING!  Nothing made a difference, I had to use cover up every morning (and I have never been a foundation/cover up kinda girl), just to avoid the \\&quot;gee, are you ok - you look tired/sick/like you&#x27;ve been crying\\&quot;...but coverups have their own issues, and certainly don&#x27;t solve the problem.      So after much reading about ProX I decided to give your product a try. I purchased this anti-aging starter kit - day lotion, night creme and the eye restoration complex (2x/day) and I also purchased the facial wash with tiny exfoliatiants.  I have had the products for 1 week and have used them as directed. I haven&#x27;t changed anything else in my stress levels or diet - but the results are truly stunning.    In 1 week I now wake up in the morning and look at my face and I really do look like I did 5 years ago. My skin is so perfect I could go without any makeup at all! But the reason for this review, is the eye restoration complex. It simply WORKS! My eyes are back to normal puffiness and the darkening is nearly gone -I don&#x27;t have to use any concealer (I can only guess it will keep getting better!)!     You know something is really working when other people notice...for the first time in my life - just yesterday - a guy at a taco stand told me I had \\&quot;pretty eyes\\&quot;.  I&#x27;m used to being called Frog Eyes when I was little... so this is a giant - uh - Leap! if you will...    All this AFTER 1 WEEK using ProX!!!    My only concern is - if I&#x27;m only 38 and already using ProX what will be there to help me when I&#x27;m 48 and 58 and 68!!!   Please keep advancing your products!    Today, among other things, I will be secretly thankful for ProX for giving me \\&quot;pretty eyes\\&quot;.</li>
    <li> There was not even one product in this set that I found to be helpful for me.  Guess everyone is different though so it might work for others?</li>
    <li> It works well with my sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> Good buy and great product.</li>
    <li> I love this set.  It has all you need to moisturize night and day.  I thought the price was excellent for all 3 products.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always been an Olay user for the most part, but never Pro-x.  The improvement in my skin since I started using this a few weeks ago is incredible!!  I&#x27;m hooked - from now on it&#x27;s Pro-X for me!</li>
    <li> Not impressed. Wouldn&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> My dermatologist recommended this product.  I like it very much.  Not costly and does the job.</li>
    <li> This doesn&#x27;t work. Also and more importantly, there are such harmful ingredients in these products. A friend turned me on to Essential oils and more natural products and now I go that way and my skin is glowing! Will never buy anything put Essentioils again and am ashamed I ever used such harmful products like Olay on my skin to begin with.</li>
    <li> while I&#x27;m at the age that no product is going to make me look young again, I have found the pro x to be well tolerated on my face. Since I&#x27;m extremely sensitive to most products, this is a real bonus for me. Does it reduce wrinkles and make me look younger? Guess I&#x27;d have to put it on only one side of my face for months to find out. I figure it can&#x27;t hurt to use it, and looking at most consumer reports, it is highly rated as being effective. I have continued to purchase it for years.</li>
    <li> I have been using the Olay Anti-Aging protocol for just about a month. I admit I do see a difference in my skin. I am 53 years old and have been finding my skin getting drier and drier as I age. The protocol system is complete and is beginning to restore the moisture and suppleness of my skin. I particularly like the impact the Eye Restoration Complex has had on the dark circles and crows feet which had been surrounding my eyes. I have noticed that minor wrinkles are beginning to diminish. The only reason I didn&#x27;t rate this product 5 stars is because I think it is very pricey for what you get. I also have used the Biomedic line of products in the past and have found them to be even more effective. For a product sold by Oil of Olay to cost over $60 seems unreasonable, as I see O of O to be more of a drug store/ supermarket product and shouldn&#x27;t warrant the price. If Amazon is offering rebates or specials on this product, then definitely buy, buy, buy.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this morning and night since receiving it.  While I like that my skin stays hydrated and the red packaging is eye-catching, I cannot really see a difference in my dark circles, skin texture or wrinkles.  The only thing that I don&#x27;t like is that it doesn&#x27;t seem to dry on my face for quite awhile so before using my mineral makeup I have to dust it dry first.  I&#x27;ve been using Olay&#x27;s mature skin therapy lotion for over a year and it works nicely.  I&#x27;m not looking for miracles.  I have dry skin and look for a product to keep me hydrated, stave off future wrinkles a bit and not offend me with a lot of fragrance.  The cost of this kit would keep me from buying it.  I&#x27;ll use this up and then go back to my other Olay product.  At least I&#x27;m a loyal Olay user.  If I start to see a difference, I&#x27;ll amend this review.</li>
    <li> The eye cream feels really good on my skin.  I have been using it for almost 28 days now and haven&#x27;t seen any real life changing results.  My skin feels soft but honestly that is about it.  I feel my lines on my head and eyes do look the same with no decrease in the wrinkles.    Probably will not buy this again.</li>
    <li> I let my wife review this product.  She has used this starter kit for about 6 weeks and while she plains to continue using the moisturizer, she won&#x27;t be continuing to buy the other products.  She claims that her current eye care products from Suave work just as well for but she does like the facial cream.  She said at first the cream caused her to breakout by after about a week this no longer was a problem.  She thinks it works better than what she was using, but the cost of replacing the products has her on the fence.  She&#x27;s leaning towards continuing it because of coupons and promotions that stores and Amazon are running on the product, but at full price she doesn&#x27;t think that they are worth it.</li>
    <li> So far as good as any other I&#x27;ve used.</li>
    <li> Made my skin feel nice, but no noticeable results.</li>
    <li> This is a great product that makes my skin feel soft and look younger. the night cream is thick and feels great.</li>
    <li> I have acne prone skin that is very oily in the T-zone, big pores around my nose, between the eyebrows, and on my chin. I have a very deep forehead wrinkle and some wrinkles around the eyes. I have used this product for about 3 weeks now in addition to weekly exfoliation which I started at the same time. I purchased this product because it contains niacin as the anti-aging ingredient. The most common and effective anti-aging ingredient is retinol but there are publications that suggest niacin may be good and can help regulate oil production, so, here we are.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have generally not seen any difference in my skin so that is always a let down but I will go through the three products in turn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Eye cream: Well, my wrinkles are unchanged so I guess not much to say there. The cream itself feels good. Not too greasy.&lt;br /&gt;Wrinkle smoothing cream: I applied this to my forehead wrinkle as well as to my eye area on occasion. It feels pretty good on the skin and I like the texture. I do not feel that it is too heavy for me and I don&#x27;t feel like I have an oil slick on my face when I wake up, which is often the case with heavier night creams. Overall, even though I haven&#x27;t seem a direct improvement, I am willing to repurchase this cream to give it a little longer to work.&lt;br /&gt;Age repair lotion: All I can think of is sunscreen. This product smells and feels too much like sunscreen for me. I obviously want to wear sunscreen but there are more pleasant products out there. This one goes on greasy and shiny. Also, a single pump is generally more than I would use so when I take too much by accident, it makes it worse. Probably the worst product of the three.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will use the rest of this kit and update if I see any change. I may repurchase the wrinkle smoothing cream only to give it another chance. The others... probably not.</li>
    <li> unfortunately, to fault of Amazon, I had a terrible allergic reaction to this product. P &amp; G was nice to send me a refund once I proved that it was purchased.  I understand that maybe my skin type was sensitive and that is okay.</li>
    <li> This stuff works great!</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t seen much result.  I just use these for daily moisturizer at this point.  Better to use it for something than nothing, I suppose lol.</li>
    <li> Great price for this kit. A lot less than department stores, same great product! Thanks so much for offering this at an affordable price!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been happy with not only the size of these sample products, but with their overall effects as well.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product set for over a month now. I would guess that I still have at least two more months of product left in this sampler pack. I try to apply every evening and morning, but sometimes I just don&#x27;t have the time and/or energy. But I would guess I average about 5-6 days per week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now for the contents - I thoroughly enjoy that the day lotion has sun protection so I&#x27;m protected every day, even when I might otherwise not think to put on sunscreen. That&#x27;s when those pesky UV rays would attack, especially in the winter when I don&#x27;t think as much about the sun&#x27;s potential for damage. I am 31 years old and have always looked young for my age. However, since using this product, I have turned back the clock even farther. The other day a store clerk looked at me as if I were ridiculous upon asking to buy a lottery ticket. She wrinkled her nose as she gave my face a visual inspection and asked for my ID. I grinned as I handed it over and thanked her. She looked at the date and said, &amp;#34;Oh. Wow. Okay, you&#x27;re good.&amp;#34; What a feeling! The Olay Professional Pro-X Anti-Aging really does work. The fine lines around my eyes have all but disappeared and I have noticed a significant difference in my forehead frown wrinkle (as I call it) and smile creases.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In fact, I may have to stop using it so people don&#x27;t think my 42 year old boyfriend is out with his daughter or robbing the cradle...</li>
    <li> So far so good on the Olay ProX starter kit. I love the feel of the products on my skin but was hoping for more of a difference on week 3 here.  I am not going to be discouraged however, I will continue to use as Olay products have never done me wrong in the past.</li>
    <li> I am 37 years old with slightly oily skin.  I have been using Olay regenerist serum for 3 years and decided to try this.  I have used it for two months daily and my skin tone has evened out and the fine lines near my eyes are barely visible.  The results are noticeable.  I have an identical twin who doesn&#x27;t use skin care products (except face wash and neutrogena SPF 30 sunscreen).  Side by side the results are amazing.  Strangers have commented on my &amp;#34;healthy&amp;#34; looking skin.  I also have stopped wearing daily make up.  Love this product!  The night cream is my favorite. Skin feels amazing once it&#x27;s on.  I even convinced my husband to start using it to reduce the fine lines in his forehead and around his eyes.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 53 and not only due to age I also have wrinkles from being a long time smoker. I have tried all sorts of products but never found anything that really worked for me. I haven&#x27;t used this long but can already see a difference. My wrinkles are less visible and my skin is brighter and softer. I feel sexier and feel good about my appearance and my husband says I also look great :) .I will continue using it because I finally found a product I&#x27;m happy with.</li>
    <li> Love Olay. This is a nice set to have. Lasts longer than you would think.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for a few weeks and have not seen any difference.  I will keep give it another couple of weeks.</li>
    <li> Best anti aging kit out there for the price, fast shipping, will buy from seller again!</li>
    <li> I love Olay and have used their products for years...this is not a favorite</li>
    <li> The &amp;#34;Starter Kit&amp;#34; size containers are very generous.  I like all 3 products and will order again.  All go on very smooth and not greasy.</li>
    <li> And I was happy with the results, but is rather labor intensive and expensive to continue with. Did like the smell (many of this type of this thing stink up the house).</li>
    <li> I bought this kit, along with a pair of new track shoes because I hoped that after using this, my husband would chase me around the bed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a month, no matter how slowly I run, he doesn&#x27;t seem interested, and I frankly don&#x27;t see any difference in my face.  The cream remains sticky a bit too long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m back to my regular moisturizer, which is lovely, but does not promise to firm, lift separate, refine or any other magic.  It is Aveeno Positively Radiant, and it costs much less, is a very nice product, and does not attempt to raise expectations with extravagant claims.  It moisturizes, period.  Just like all the expensive junk.</li>
    <li> Wish there was more information on what product is best for 50 yr skin.  Definitely a great product.  Has helped with my wrinkles.</li>
    <li> been using this for years. since I was 21. now 40. does a great job with my skin, not a wrinkle yet!!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I am so disappointed with this product even if it feels luxurious on your skin. ProX is not for people with oily skin like me. Though I still love OLAY products overall. If you have super dry to dry skin, then this would be perfect for you. If you have combination to oily skin, beware because it can cause breakouts. By the way, why charge so much when OLAY is selling a lot already of good products for less. Volume-wise Olay can make money already. I hope it&#x27;s not because of greed. Being expensive doesn&#x27;t mean better. I love the Regenerist Line but not this for me.</li>
    <li> The night time Wrinkle Smoothing Cream is very light and non-greasy.&lt;br /&gt;I have been applying it nightly on my face and neck.  My skin feels a&lt;br /&gt;bit firmer and well moisturized after using this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Age Repair Lotion with SPF 30 is also a light moisturizer without&lt;br /&gt;much of a scent.  I apply this all over my face and neck each morning.&lt;br /&gt;  It does not leave a greasy layer on my skin and I apply make up&lt;br /&gt;over it without any problems.  I like the SPF 30 in this cream so&lt;br /&gt;that my face is protected from the sun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Eye Restoration Complex cream is also a thin easy to apply lotion&lt;br /&gt;that I have been putting under my eyes in the morning and before bed&lt;br /&gt;at night.  I have noticed that my eye squinting wrinkles seem to be&lt;br /&gt;less noticeable.  What I really like about this whole line is that&lt;br /&gt;the products do not have an overpowering scent and they are all&lt;br /&gt;non-greasy feeling.</li>
    <li> This is a good moisturizer -- keeps my skin in good condition even for long walks in 12-degree weather and house humidity levels in the single digits.  However, I don&#x27;t like the fact that there are warnings about not getting the eye cream in the eyes -- I think that any product designed to be applied right around the eyes should be perfectly safe if it gets in your eyes.  I can&#x27;t comment on the anti-aging claim -- this would take a 5 or 10-year study to evaluate.</li>
    <li> The Olay anti-aging kit is a good kit for a variety of reasons. If you are like me, who has dark under eye circles, you will see some improvement almost immediately. The result, however, seems to not advance (at least noticably) from there. The kit is good regardless of this as it provides you with a wonderful daily UVA/UVB sun screen and a very nice night cream. This kit is pricey so you may want to shop around, but it is worth consideration and I definitely did see some initial improvement in my dark circles and find lines around my eyes.</li>
    <li> I had never used Olay products before. I often used Roc products.  Thought I would give this a try after reading the reviews of other woman and seeing the Pro X ad in magazines and in the media.     This product delivers. I&#x27;ve been using this protocol faithfully every day for 1 1/2 months and definitely see a difference in the overall appearance of my skin. Fine lines have diminished and my skin is soft and definitely moisturized. Fragrance is medicinal, but not overpowering. I would definitely recommend this product. The cost is nominal compared to some of the Rx products recommended by dermatologist. The key is to use this product faithfully. Way to go Olay..</li>
    <li> I say if something works and people keep  noticing how nice your skin is and you look young then why change it.! Have been using pro x anti aging since it first came out!!!! Love it!</li>
    <li> While this set does feel and look moisturizing, the day cream with the SPF burns under my eye area like crazy!  Not great for sensitive skin, I guess.</li>
    <li> The tingling sensation feels more like a worm wiggling under my skin on my face.  It&#x27;s actually nerve sensitivity to this product. Face is numb, swollen especially around the eyes and forehead.  burning sensations along my temples and down through cheeks. The age repair lotion is sufficient and no problems with it.  I had permanent, deep grooves in my forehead. They have essentially smoothed out. The products DO work. My skin is as soft as a &amp;#34;baby&#x27;s bottom&amp;#34;. Unfortunately, I believe I am allergic to the wrinkle smoothing (night) cream.</li>
    <li> I just wanted to try these products first.  So, far Good products, works well and pretty good size considering the cost!  Love the eye cream.  Excellent time for delivery.</li>
    <li> Easy to use and not so many steps.  This not the first time I have used this product, my daughter gave this kit to me for Christmas. This does make a good gift for those of us who have used and like the product.  I highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for bout month. Noticed results right away. I purchased this as a gift for my sis. Seller answered my emails right away. I highly recomend this seller.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t see the results that the product claimed within a month. Glad I bought this small kit before investing more.</li>
    <li> It broke my face out and no results.</li>
    <li> Maybe Im just allergic to it but it makes my eyes itchy and swollen.  Used for about 2 weeks and didn&#x27;t see a difference</li>
    <li> This is a fine moisturizer but I can&#x27;t say I see any lasting or dramatic effects. If I don&#x27;t apply it before bed every night my face looks exactly the same as always, with noticeable fine lines. If I do apply it, my face stays moisturized and the fine lines are less noticeable due to the plumping up from the moisture. My face is white as a fish, belly up in the water, nice shade, using the day lotion which has SPF 30 which I&#x27;m sure is great to keep wrinkles at bay, but do any of us really want to look this pasty? I&#x27;m not one for lots of make up so if you don&#x27;t want to have to use foundation and blush go with a lesser SPF. I have used Regenerist in the past and I think I liked it better but just the same they are only moisturizers regardless of what of the box or commercials say. In other words, don&#x27;t expect a miracle, lol.</li>
    <li> I like the Pro X line from Olay.  Moisturizes well, and I believe makes my skin glow, and look more youthful.  The wrinkles don&#x27;t disappear, but I do believe it helps a bit with firmness, and maybe reducing the wrinkles a little.  This is my go to moisturize for day and night.</li>
    <li> 给老妈的，竟然被睡了100rmb，唉&lt;br /&gt;不过用的还行，相对于专柜还是有一定优势的，但是睡后就啥都不说了，都是眼泪&lt;br /&gt;To my mom, was sleeping 100RMB, alas&lt;br /&gt;But okay, relative to the counter or have a certain advantage, but sleep is what all don&#x27;t say, are tears</li>
    <li> Great stuff and I have long trusted for quality and innovative products.</li>
    <li> Defy the ages. This stuff is great. Keeps you looking young and keeps the skin healthy. I don&#x27;t know anyone who wants to look old.</li>
    <li> Have used faithfully with zero results. Huge waste of money. My eyes and face is not that bad...but this didn&#x27;t even do a minimum amount of change.</li>
    <li> Very good deal  I would purchase again.  Sample size but has lasted more than two weeks very worth the price I paid.</li>
    <li> This is a product I use on a regular basis and when I found&lt;br /&gt;this online at this price, I was excited. Arrived on time packaged well and&lt;br /&gt;is a great product.</li>
    <li> Most importantly there haven&#x27;t been any adverse reactions using the products. While at 71 I am not plagued with many wrinkles, I would like to reduce the puffiness under my eyes and brighten up my dry complexion. Perhaps if I used a magnifying glass, I&#x27;d see a difference in my skin quality. So I&#x27;ll return to using ROC products that seem to have the required basic ingredients for healthy skin.</li>
    <li> S far this product has been fine, but I have not been impressed with it compared with previous products that I have tried. I will be returning to ROC after these products run out.</li>
    <li> this is my 2nd purchase, i love this product--it stands up tho the oil of olay name&lt;br /&gt;would recommend to any one</li>
    <li> I have used this product before but the price made it work that much better! I absolutely love Olay, and now Pro-X Anti-Aging products are working for me even better than ever!! Thank you, Amazon! You&#x27;ve done it again!! I love my Amazon Prime account and wouldn&#x27;t give it up for anything.....</li>
    <li> As a loyal Olay user I had high hopes for these products.  But I was disappointed.  The moisturizers seemed to dry my skin out rather than moisturize.  The eye cream wasn&#x27;t too bad but I will stick with the daily serum for now.  I really don&#x27;t think this was worth the price.</li>
    <li> THIS WAS SUPPOSED TO BE A NEW KIT!  THE EYE SERUM WAS USED...MORE THAN HALF OF IT WAS GONE.  VERY DISAPPOINTED, WILL NOT BUY FROM THEM AGAIN.</li>
    <li> Works ,I stopped using it for awhile. Not good to stop.&lt;br /&gt;My skin feels and looks better again! Worth the money</li>
    <li> I liked the product.  I didn&#x27;t feel it worked as well as I would have liked it to for me.</li>
    <li> The Olay Pro-x is great.  I have been using this for several years now.  I went for a facial and they did not try to sell me any product as they were amazed my skin looked so great.  I think the facialist was going out to buy the Pro-x and use it herself.  I have bought $100 creams and tried all different ones.  This is the best I have found and the price is very reasonable. It out performs any other creams I have tried.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t want to grow old, but if I must, at least this will take the edge off.</li>
    <li> Great seller but product doesn&#x27;t work</li>
</ol>
