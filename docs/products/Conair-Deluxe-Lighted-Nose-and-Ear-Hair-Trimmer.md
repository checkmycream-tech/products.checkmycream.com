      <li>The best trimmer I have ever used</li>
      <li>it is great, just what I wanted.  </li>
      <li>Works great for the money</li>
      <li>A good buy.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m just going to have to jury-rig in my own switch for the thing.</li>
      <li>You sale was everything I hoped for &amp; more.</li>
      <li>Out of the package, the motor sounds fine and the blade spins well.  </li>
      <li>However, I question the functionality of the light.  </li>
      <li>so i opened the case and disconnected the light - problem solved.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s much better than the one I used about four times before figuring out that it wasn&#x27;t doing a good enough job.  </li>
      <li>This works great the light on it really helps out,its battery lasts a long time and was well worth the money</li>
      <li>I got rid of it right away.  </li>
      <li>This trimmer definitely does a good enough job trimming hair without discomfort.</li>
      <li>The light is somewhat useful, but obviously the closer you get to your nose or ear, the further off the light is.</li>
      <li>It is easy enough to hold in average-size hands.  </li>
      <li>But it does not find and cut hair very well.  </li>
      <li>Thanks I luv my purchase</li>
      <li>The light feature really adds no or little benefit.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not giving it five stars because it looks a little cheap in person.</li>
      <li>The trimmer worked reasonably well, but the on/off switch broke after only six months of rather sparse use.    </li>
      <li>The light is useless unless you&#x27;re in a cave with no other source of light.</li>
      <li>but in reality it doesn&#x27;t put enough light anywhere; moreover, it only adds heat to your skin to make it more uncomfortable.</li>
      <li>It barely trims the hairs and takes forever and leave lots of strays...</li>

<li> Terrible.  </li>

    <li> The best trimmer I have ever used</li>
    <li> Product does not work well.  The cutting element is poorly designed for catching hair.  When it does find a hair, it does not cut it close.  Out of the package, the motor sounds fine and the blade spins well.  It is easy enough to hold in average-size hands.  But it does not find and cut hair very well.  The light is useless unless you&#x27;re in a cave with no other source of light.</li>
    <li> This is the second trimmer I&#x27;ve purchased to replace a trimmer that&#x27;s&#x27; no longer manufactured.  It&#x27;s much better than the one I used about four times before figuring out that it wasn&#x27;t doing a good enough job.  This trimmer definitely does a good enough job trimming hair without discomfort. My only wish is that it trim a tad closer and easier in hard to reach areas.  The light feature really adds no or little benefit.</li>

    <li> have used several types of nose trimmers in the past and once i found this i&#x27;ve only used the same model and brand since. going on 5 years and they last.</li>
    <li> This item did not work at all.  I was very disappointed. I got rid of it right away.  I would not recommend this to anyone.</li>
    <li> For the money, the trimmer works as it should. However, I question the functionality of the light.  On paper it makes sense but in reality it doesn&#x27;t put enough light anywhere; moreover, it only adds heat to your skin to make it more uncomfortable. I suspect it also decreases battery life so i opened the case and disconnected the light - problem solved.</li>
    <li> Terrible.  Doesn&#x27;t work at all... Don&#x27;t waste your money on this one.  It barely trims the hairs and takes forever and leave lots of strays...</li>
    <li> The trimmer worked reasonably well, but the on/off switch broke after only six months of rather sparse use.    I&#x27;ve repaired the flimsy plastic switch twice, but it&#x27;s beyond repair after it broke for the third time.    I&#x27;m just going to have to jury-rig in my own switch for the thing.</li>
    <li> It seems to work well. My husband likes gadgets and I like him groomed.I&#x27;m not giving it five stars because it looks a little cheap in person.</li>
    <li> Works great for the money</li>
    <li> Thanks I luv my purchase it is great, just what I wanted.  You sale was everything I hoped for &amp; more.</li>
    <li> This works great the light on it really helps out,its battery lasts a long time and was well worth the money</li>
    <li> Inexpensive,effective, and reliable. A good buy.</li>
