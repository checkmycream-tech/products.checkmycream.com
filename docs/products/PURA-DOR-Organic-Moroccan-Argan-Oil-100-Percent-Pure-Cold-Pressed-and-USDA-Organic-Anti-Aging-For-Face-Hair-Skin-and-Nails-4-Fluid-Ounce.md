<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I have used purador argon oil for years and love love love it . I am 41 and had mild chronic adult acne. Within weeks of using purador argon oil as my facial moisture my acne cleared up. People commented on how radiant and glowing my skin appeared after I started using purador argon oil. I would recommend this product to anyone. I hope the product will be availsble forever because I don&#x27;t think I could ever find another mousturizer that will work as well as it does.</li>
    <li> I love the oil, which I buy monthly and apply on the areas of body which need more hydration.  This review would have been 5 stars except that the container leaks badly.  I don&#x27;t remember this problem being as pronounced  with the initial purchases, but it&#x27;s a huge problem now.</li>
    <li> So far so good! Leaves hair feeling smooth and less tangled.</li>
    <li> Makes my skin feel so soft! I put it on my face and body at night. I also put it on stretch marks although I have not noticed whether or not the oil has really done anything to help them. I have noticed however, that the oil will help clear some of the blemishes on my face if I wear it to bed. I tried putting the oil in my hair once after the shower and when my hair actually dried, it looked a little greasy. Either it is a little too heavy to put in my hair or I put too much in. Either way, it did make my hair soft and it seemed to lock in lots of moisture. This product really does wonders for dry skin/hair.</li>
    <li> This product is not good for hair. I have been using Argan oil for my hair for almost a year and this is not the right product for it. Probably it&#x27;s good for nails and body.</li>
    <li> Use it daily for my face, usually an hour before I go to bed.  Eating well and exercise slow the aging process down too :)</li>
    <li> Non Greasy, great hair and skin mositurizer. Leaves my hair soft and shiny. I have used similar argan oils in the past year, and prefer this pure argan oil ! I would highly recommend this product. I have been using this product for over three months now. It is offered at a very reasonable price and I will buy again !</li>
    <li> I just received my bottle in the mail on 10/24/14.  It instantly moisturized my dry cracked nails, four hours later they are still looking good.  The oil absorbed well. It didn&#x27;t leave my face feeling greasy, just moisturized.  The product has no smell.  Overall, after one day, this stuff seems great!</li>
    <li> I LOVE this product!  It very light and soaks in quickly, leaving a  super soft glow to your skin. Makeup applies nicely over it.  i use it morning and night and, other than my cleanser, it is the only thing I use on my skin.  I get compliments all the time on my skin!  Love it!</li>
    <li> Its a good moisturizer for the hair and skin and absorbs very well. I must use it again and again and again......!</li>
    <li> I love it! Makes my hair and skin feel so soft!</li>
    <li> Very pleased. Super fast delivery and a high quality 100% pure organic Argan oil. I use this on my face, hair, hands and full body. A small amount goes a long way. Skin feels wonderful, fine lines have disappeared. An amazing natural product for hair skin and nails I&#x27;ve seen others at 5 times the price and quite frankly, I see absolutely no difference. A great buy for my money.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff.  No fragrance.</li>
    <li> Amazing... makes my face always fresh, and very clear.</li>
    <li> It feels so good I like it better than lotions after a shower</li>
    <li> Ordering it for the third time as both me and my wife have replaced our moisturizer with argon oil. Giving the right amount of moisture and a glowing skin. I often use it on my hair too to keep dandruff away. Would love the product if is little cheaper.</li>
    <li> I used it a week ago on my girls hair which is very dry and breakage, the result is amazing. now their hair is soft and Shiny.&lt;br /&gt;I spent a lot of money on different products and does not work, I&#x27;m very happy with this product and I will order it again and the shipping was fast.</li>
    <li> This product is the best thing that has passed, since I&#x27;m using in my hair got me like silk, also use it on my skin and help for everything, I recommend it to people who have their damaged hair, because it really is the best; for dry skin and is excellent I have a lot of time using it, so I recommend it.</li>
    <li> loved this product so much, make your skin feel so soft!</li>
    <li> Less viscous than other argan oils i&#x27;ve used, but i like the consistency and the minimal fragrance. i use it daily to moisturize my skin, hair, cuticles, etc.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this argan oil for one week now (I may post a follow-up review after a month or so). So far: I am very happy with this oil. I&#x27;ve been using it to clean my face (&amp;#34;Oil-cleansing method.&amp;#34; I plan on using it once every four days or so. I&#x27;ve been washing my face with water only in between days), and I&#x27;ve been applying a little around my eyes and on my lips each night. It makes my skin soft and glowy, and my pores look clear. This is the first facial moisturizer I&#x27;ve ever used that hasn&#x27;t irritated my skin or caused it to break out or become greasy (I have sensitive combination skin). It&#x27;s lightweight, has a faint scent (almost nutty), and a small amount of it goes a long way.  (Note: I purchased this through Pura d&#x27;or&#x27;s site, not on Amazon)  2/26/15 Update: Wasn&#x27;t doing much for my skin; wasn&#x27;t worsening it (which is good) or improving it. However, it does decently moisturize my hair.</li>
    <li> I loved this product from its first application. I&#x27;ll never be without it. It&#x27;s simple and effective. I love the size and the overall usefulness of this product. I totally recommend this product to anyone :-)</li>
    <li> used 2 times for my hair,it&#x27;s feel great,not oily.</li>
    <li> I am very happy with this product, my hair an skin looks and feels fantastic, I really recommend it to my friends and family. I LOVE IT</li>
    <li> What&#x27;s nice about this product is that it is pure argan oil with no added chemical or other ingredients. I use a dab on my hair after washing, to protect it and tame frizz. I also put a little on my skin to keep it moisturized. This product comes in a nice glass bottle with an easy to use dispenser. I love that the company supports Mother Earth in their philosophy and appreciates the natural beauty secrets of the Moroccan women.</li>
    <li> Works well on my skin.  Happy with the quality of the product</li>
    <li> Great product!  Makes my hair really healthy and shiny!</li>
    <li> Very good product to use for who has dry skin</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been experimenting with various skin regiments and read somewhere about Argon oil for skin and hair. I began using Argon oil along with some other natural oils on my face and in my hair and am really enjoying it. It&#x27;s only be about a month, but I&#x27;m already seeing improvements in my complexion. I&#x27;m definitely in it for the long haul and look forward to seeing my face and how it has transformed several months from now.</li>
    <li> I received my product 2 weeks ago. I really like it. I am using it every morning all over my body except my face and I love the consistency of the oil. It absorbs very quick which is very important for me, and it does not leave any odor in my body, also very important for me. I also use it almost every night in my hair and I wash my hair in the morning with the purador hair loss prevention and  I like the results. I haven&#x27;t use the argan oil in my face because I apply vitamin E every night and I like the results, maybe I will try it in the future since lot of folks recommend argan oil for your face too. The spray and the price is a big plus.</li>
    <li> I LOVE what Argan oil does for my skin but I do not like the price of some of the more well known brands. Pura d&#x27;or is definitely equal quality for a better price! It has taken me 4 months to finish 1 bottle. I have very sensitive and dry skin and this could not be better. I definitely recommend abandoning your high end oil for this equal and better priced oil    I would definitely recommend keeping it in the fridge though! I am paranoid about it becoming rancid so I have a small dark colored glass dropper that I refill from my large bottle I keep in the fridge</li>
    <li> I have really dry hair, so I thought I would try this after reading the reviews on here. After a few weeks, I&#x27;ve noticed that my hair is starting to look shinier. Since my skin has also been a bit dry due to the cold weather, I decided to start applying a bit of argan oil onto my face as well, which has made my skin feel more moisturized. I&#x27;m going to have to try applying this to my nail as well. Love it so far!</li>
    <li> This oil is perfect for keeping my hair moisturized between washes. It also tames my curls so they actually look cute! I have a LOT of hair and this takes my hair from big and frizzy to full and \\&quot;beach wavy.\\&quot; I&#x27;ve tried many kinds of oils and this is by far the best one. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because I still have to use a pretty decent amount. I rub about 4-5 drops throughout my hair about 5-6 times before I can say I&#x27;m ready to go.</li>
    <li> I received quick delivery of this argan oil - 4 days!  The oil came in a very sturdy package with lots of padding.  This is my first purchase of argan oil, and it seems to meet all the rave reviews.  I use 3-4 drops to massage onto my face, and I am impressed by how it keeps my face feeling soft and moist, not oily.  Thank you Pur d&#x27;or for this product.</li>
    <li> I have heard wonderful things about Argan oil and almost purchased some from a home shopping network which was very expensive. I found this brand and bought it instead. I am so glad I did! It is not greasy and leaves my face feeling wonderful! I have also used it on my hair and I love that too! (Tip-a little goes a long way) I will re-purchase this item.</li>
    <li> One of the best argan oil in the market. 100% authentic . We keep purchasing this once we are out. We love it. No dry skin keep my skin free from breakouts. This is highly recommended.  :)</li>
    <li> This has been a very good facial moisturizer. I have been happy applying it at night before bed, and again in the early morning before showering and shaving. I have had no clogging of my pores at all, so I feel very safe using this. The moisturizing qualities of this oil are excellent, and it is unbelievably concentrated. Because of this, you need considerably less than you would think—1 or 2 drops in my palm are enough for my face.&lt;br /&gt;Some men recommend this as a preshave oil, lathering right over the top of it, and others recommend it as an aftershave moisturizer. I will try both of these eventually, but am very happy using it as a skin conditioner at night and an hour before shaving. One bottle will probably last a year using it the way I do. A good value.</li>
    <li> using this oil since one year , very light , soothing and absorbs all.I tried many products but my skin is super sensitive nothing ever worked and threw lot of stuff .This is the only stuff which worked so well that I purchased eleven bottles this time. This product deserves more than five star.Thanks .</li>
    <li> Great product! I purchased this Argan oil for my hair, but have found I love it even for my skin, nails and mascara! I put a few drops into my organic mascara as it was coming to the end. It extended the use and is nice and smooth to put on my lashes! I also use very little on the ends of my hair (fine hair) before I dry it and it keeps the ends smooth. My husband also like it for his face and mustache! I will purchase this again!</li>
    <li> I ordered my second bottle because of the amazing results!  I have black, thick, coarse East Asian hair and a few drops of this really nourishes my hair and makes it shiny and healthy.  My hairdresser said that my hair looks healthier than usual.  I only use it about every other day in the shower and also after towel drying my hair. If you have super fine hair use very little.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also started using it for my pimples and I&#x27;m amazed at how quickly my zit disappears after I squeeze it.  My skin heals much faster with minimal residual marks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the fact that it&#x27;s organic and pure.  If you see other brands like Moroccan Oil brand and look at the ingredients there are other so many other ingredients listed besides argan oil but Pura d&#x27;or just has the oil.</li>
    <li> I would recommend this product.  No filler, 100% oil with neutral scent. Love it for my face and hair.</li>
    <li> I had been using a much more expensive Argan Oil from Josie Maran on QVC. The Pura d&#x27;or is so much a better value and it is just as good if not better. Leaves my skin baby soft and hair very silky. Love, love it!!</li>
    <li> this is my daily moisturizer.</li>
    <li> So after reading all the positive reviews, I decided to try my luck. I have only been using it for 1 week, and i can notice some difference. One thing i can notice right after you put it on is that it makes your face smoother to the touch, I guess that is a good thing. It also does not feel very greasy. I am also using it on my hair, haven&#x27;t notice a big difference, but since it only has been a week, the jury is still out.</li>
    <li> Amaizing product...instantly saw results. My face was glowing and hair felt so soft! I suffer from dry skin especially on my face and I just loved how it felt on my face after my shower. Would recommend to everyone.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing. I just ordered my fourth bottle of argan oil, I am 74 years young and am told all the time i look 49 thanks to your product, Everyone asks what i use on my skin i say pura d&#x27;or. thanks</li>
    <li> No off putting scent, great product.</li>
    <li> I use this argan oil as a face moisturizer, and I love it.  I was previously using a different brand, but this is just as good and a better value.  My only issue is that I prefer having a dropper bottle rather than the pump that this bottle comes with, because I find that it is easier to dole out exactly how much I want with the dropper.  The pump isn&#x27;t bad though.  I really like that this is 100% argan oil, and that it is organic as well.</li>
    <li> Love it, great product, light not greasy!</li>
    <li> Very nice oil for face or body. Absorbs quickly into the skin for a non greasy look and feel.  Personally, I have not seen any dramatic beauty effects but it is a nice light moisturizing product.</li>
    <li> The bottle was open and half of the oil was lost</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m glad I trusted the great reviews and bought this. It really is liquid gold. I bought it originally for my hair, and it does an OK job at making it less frizzy when it air dries, but I started using it on my face and I just LOOOOVE the way it makes my skin feel. Moisturized without being oily, soft, not flaky... it&#x27;s wonderful. I can&#x27;t wait to use it throughout the dry, chapped, winter months to see how it holds up!</li>
    <li> Wish I had found this oil when I was 22 instead of 72.  It is truly amazing the difference in my skin, hair, complexion and even less facial wrinkles.  Everyone should have this oil available in every  room in the house and the car too.  I will never be without now.</li>
    <li> Love this on my skin it makes me feel so smooth!!!! Will and have purchase more.!!!!:)</li>
    <li> I love this oil! I have tried other brands of Argan Oil, and this is by far my favorite. I use it in the morning under my makeup and at night mixed with a deep moisturizer. I also use it in my hair. It&#x27;s wonderful and has become a beauty staple!</li>
    <li> I LOVE, LOVE this product! It soaks into my skin and leaves it feeling so soft. It has also helped with wrinkles and frown lines. I use this on my face, neck, and chest every morning and night. It doesn&#x27;t cause my face to break out either. So glad I discovered this pure and organic Argan Oil! This is my second bottle and I will continue to buy it.</li>
    <li> So far I&#x27;m a fan. I&#x27;ve only used the product for about a week, and it&#x27;s to note that I only shower 3 days a week. So far, I&#x27;m really liking it. I notice the best effects if I use it right after showering, not quite as much on a day where I have not showered, which just seems to make my hair either as oily or more than normal (which makes sense because it is an oil). Don&#x27;t take this as me disapproving of it though, not at all. Today for example, when I use it after showering, my hair feels softer than I could&#x27;ve imagined. I would definitely recommend this to somebody who has issues with dry hair. It&#x27;s also good for your face and hands (basically your skin in general). I never use lotion or any sort of face cream/oil, but I really like how soft this oil makes my face and hands feel.</li>
    <li> Before trying argan oil, I had been using emu oil, but for some reason it was no longer working for my hair... and actually seemed to be making my skin dry and flaky. Maybe I developed a slight allergy to it, I don&#x27;t know, but I had to stop using it.&lt;br /&gt;I tried so many conditioners, serums and treatments, but none of those were able to control my wavy, frizzy, hair, and make it as smooth and shiny as the emu oil previously did. Then I read about argan oil.&lt;br /&gt;In the forum where I first read about it, Pura d&#x27;or was mentioned a few times, and someone added a link to purchase it. That was my first bottle. A few drops (about 6 for my long, thick, wavy hair) mixed in my conditioner was all it took to have my hair calmed, shiny, and looking so healthy! It&#x27;s a 4oz bottle so it lasts a really long time.&lt;br /&gt;I recently started using it on my face and neck with great results! It&#x27;s not a wrinkle remover, but it moisturizers so nicely without any greasiness, so it does give your face a more youthful look. Maybe there will be even more results after extended use on my face and neck since it&#x27;s only been about a week.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend Pura d&#x27;or! It&#x27;s 100% pure argan oil. No scent, not greasy, and most importantly, it does what it says it does! I love it!</li>
    <li> Feels so good on the skin!</li>
    <li> Very light and pure oil.  I purchase it for my face usage.  Do not feel greasy on the face and it keep the skin very soft.</li>
    <li> This oil was recommended to me by a friend whose skin looks fabulous and who said this Argan oil is what does it. It is not greasy, doesn&#x27;t stain my clothes and leaves my skin very soft. I use it on my face although I believe it&#x27;s also recommended for nails and hair. Hard to say if  wrinkles are less noticeable but I think my skin looks softer.</li>
    <li> Anyone who usually uses organ oils know it can be as expensive as $48 for an ounce. The oil is very much worth it but it is even better when you can get the same quality oil for a much better price. Quick delivery, great packaging good quality. I will definitely order this oil again in the future.</li>
    <li> Helps keep the hair and skin healthy!</li>
    <li> I have been using Pura d&#x27;or Argan oil for about 6 weeks and so far I am very pleased with the results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought it for my hair, hands, cuticles, and nails; but have been using it on my face too.  It hasn&#x27;t broken out my face - which is oily in certain areas and prone to blackheads, etc.  So I&#x27;ll keep using it and monitor to see what longer term results I get.</li>
    <li> I am a guy with dry skin. I mainly used coconut oil until I started using purador argan oil. The oil works amazingly. I use it after I shower. I only need to use a small amount and it spreads over my entire body. I love this stuff, especially on my feet and beard. It softens my full beard hair and makes it easy to comb. Great product for any one seeking premium Argan Oil!!!</li>
    <li> I use this argan oil every day - a very good product.</li>
    <li> Love the product, I even use it on my face.  Feels a little oily at first but once it soaks in, VERY Nice</li>
    <li> This oil is the worst for hair I&#x27;ve ever used. May be good for the skin, but makes the hair look filthy!</li>
    <li> I have been using  Pura d&#x27;or on my face everytime I cleanse for about four months now. It leaves my skin feeling so soft and smooth. I use this instead of a day cream before applying makeup. I also use it on my hair.  I just love it and will continue to buy!</li>
    <li> Like a lot of other reviewers, I had heard many good things about using argan oil on my skin.  I was really hesitant to put it on my face since I have very oily skin.  I tried this product and really liked it.  Having said that, I think it is a bit too heavy for the face.  It is AMAZING for my neck, shoulders and arms and my skin has never looked better.  I did get a sample of Jose Maron argan oil and it is much lighter and better for the face.  So, to those who would like to start using argan oil, I would recommend getting this, less expensive oil for body and hair and then buy a small bottle of Jose Maron for your face.  The combo of the two have been a game changer for me!</li>
    <li> I would recommend this product. I tried different brands of Argan Oil and really like this particular one.</li>
    <li> I did not like it at first because it didn&#x27;t give enough fumes. However, after using it for a couple of months, I started notice that I have more hair. I would recommend this product to others.</li>
    <li> I ordered this after having my hair stylist use it.  I have long, fine, frizzy hair with a mind of its own.  This oil is perfect and lasts a very long time since a very little goes a very long way.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this Argan oil!!</li>
    <li> A friend of mine told me to try this product.  I am always skeptical about oils and what they may do for you.  So for me to write this, it means that the oil does do its job.  I just started using Pura d&#x27;or Argan Oil within the past 30 days and have found it is amazing.  It makes my skin feel so much more alive than the other oils that I have tried. I use it every day and night on my hands, neck, hair and underneath my eyes and found that it makes everything look smoother.  I have found something that is worthwhile to use and will continue to use this.  I will recommend this product to all my friends! Thanks for a great product!</li>
    <li> It is a great gentle oil and felt my skin hydrated from the first use. I highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> I ordered this product not really knowing what it would do for my dry skin. It has been the greatest product I have ever put on my face and my over processed hair I am 68 years old!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will not use any thing else!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x60;ve heard that argan oil is a liquid gold but never believed in it for 100%. Now I know it&#x60;s true. In a week the skin on my cheeks are moisturised and soft all day long (they were dry no matter what I used before). Also I use the argan oil for my really damaged hair, I think it would take a little bit more time to make them healthy and shiny, but I already can see some good results. Thanks, it worth the money I paid.</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t be happier with this product. Both my husband and I use it for our skin and in our hair. I can&#x27;t believe how soft my hair feels after just one use! People have also been commenting on how shiny and sleek my hair has been looking. I mix it with carrot oil to use daily on my face, and I feel like my skin looks over all younger and healthier. I have sensitive skin and I also suffer fewer breakouts than with any other face products so far. My husband uses it as a beard oil and wants me to get another bottle so this one can be just his. We will be ordering more!</li>
    <li> Fu D&#x27;&amp; USDA Organic 100% pure Argan. Use ago, but still has a lot of expectations. I think a good mood.</li>
    <li> My nails were cracking and peeling before this oil, now they are not. They have a nice satin finish and my cuticles are much nicer. Also use on my skin to reduce signs of aging.  I tried it on my hair, but it was too heavy for my fine hair. I am very happy with product and reordered it.</li>
    <li> I love argan oil.  I use it on my hair and my cuticles and skin.  It is not at all greasy.</li>
    <li> This is really remarkable. I have always had dry skin, and this has done wonders for me. I am sold on this oil.</li>
    <li> Makes hair greasy. Is good for face though.</li>
    <li> i am on my third bottle of this stuff!  i love it.  I like using a pure oil for my facial moisturizer rather than a moisturizer made by a cosmetic that has these oils in it.  Why not go straight to the source and eliminate all these other questionable ingrediants.  So far, I&#x27;ve tried jojoba, almond, coconut and argan oil.  Argan oil so far is the best!  Super hydrating and my skin has never looked better.  I&#x27;m very happy with this brand, the price, the shipping, the glass packaging. It&#x27;s perfect.</li>
    <li> I love this product. It leaves my face nice and hydrated throughout the whole day and it does not make my face look oily. It has really helped me with my scars. I also love that its all natural oil. I Totally recomend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> Works wonders for split ends. I haven&#x27;t had to get my hair cut for a year since I started using argan oil! Highly recommend if you&#x27;re looking to grow out your hair. It also is very nice to use on your face after you exfoliate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amazing value especially compared to places like Sephora and Ulta. Same stuff, just a different bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product</li>
    <li> Great for the face and my hair. I love the way my skin is getting more soft and my hair too.</li>
    <li> Very nice product. Helped reduce the 2 red dry patches on my cheeks. Leaves my skin with that youthful, dewy look and feel. Would buy this again. I only use it on my face but wouldn&#x27;t hesitate to use it elsewhere.</li>
    <li> I had purchased this as an additive to homemade body butter making, and discovered the benefits of putting it directly on your face for wonderful moisture and hydration. I have also been an obagi user for a long time, and I like the Pura argan oil much better. I am very happy with the product for personal use, and for an added ingredient in my body butters. Will be purchasing again and again, I am sure.</li>
    <li> Oh fresh where do I start! This product is hands down amazing, it has many great properties that is beneficial to our skin and hair! Usually after taking a shower I will come out with red patches around my neck probably due to the soap I&#x27;m using. After putting Purador Argan Oil on it completely calms it. My skin never looked this good! Love love this!!! Thank you so much!!!!</li>
    <li> I have been a user of argan oil products for a number of years now. Before Pura d&#x27;or, I was using Essence of Argan Oil which i got off a Groupon sale. It was decent but the bottle was 50ml so it ran out fairly quickly and it was around $20. The argan oil I used before that was the popular Moroccanoil that comes in a glass bottle with the blue tag. That was my first experience with an argan oil product and fell in love. And as love goes, you learn to ignore some faults here and there, mainly the price tag ($40 usually, $35 if you sell your soul to the hair gods) and the smell. It was moderately musky, not that it was a bad smell but I prefer a more neutral or almost no smell. My &amp;#34;happy&amp;#34; relationship with Moroccanoil ended when I decided to get out of my comfort and start looking at other oils. I saw this Pura d&#x27;or argan oil and decided to take a chance. Its been almost a year since my first bottle and I don&#x27;t plan on going back to Moroccan. The price tag ($20) is excellent for how much I get (118 ml) and the smell is very neutral, almost non existent. I see myself buying this for quite some time. Its been leaving me and my lockes satisfied after every shower. If you&#x27;ve got really thick hair that&#x27;s prone to dry-ness, this product is for you.</li>
    <li> Very happy with this product. I use 2 pumps as my facial moisturizer and my skin is glowing! I have incredibly sensitive skin and have had no irritation at all. I&#x27;m a fan for life!</li>
    <li> This product has really helped my hair feel stronger and healthier!  It only takes a small amount but it does a great job!  I also put it on my face and it does not leave a greasy feel!  I love this product along with the shampoo and conditioner from Pura d&#x27;or!  My new &amp;#34;go to&amp;#34; products!</li>
    <li> I love your product. I used to think it smelled a bit like a rubber band. But after a couple of days I became used to the scent. The scent always disappears after a few minutes in the skin. It absorbs so quickly and beautifully.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have very dry skin. I use the Aragon oil 3 times a day. I just love it. It makes my skin feel clear, smooth and soft. My skin is completely the opposite it used to be before using this product. You should try the Aragon oil...it really works!</li>
    <li> I live in a dry climate, this has worked very well for my dry skin.  It doesn&#x27;t leave skin oily but it does give your skin a silky matte finish.  I like the pump that it comes with too.</li>
    <li> I use this for my hair and face, it does moistures well, it does reduce the hair volume a bit.</li>
    <li> Great oil, but when I pressed down, it squirted/shot out a splash of oil. Press down gently, and tip the bottle slightly downwards. May be common sense for some, but I definitely missed the memo and it squirted all over my shirt.</li>
    <li> As a body, hair and facial oil, it works very well. I can see good improvement on my skin. 5 stars!! :)</li>
    <li> I started using the Argan oil as soon as I received it on 11/26/14 and as of now I have not noticed any difference in my acne, or reduction in wrinkles but it will probably take more time.  I have very dry skin so I have to reapply the Argan oil couple times a day.  The same thing applies to my hair.  I can condition the heck out of it but once it dries, it&#x27;s frizzy and brittle.  I have to put Argan oil on it after each wash or it looks like crap.  I like this Argan oil better than the other I&#x27;ve tried before because it does not use a dropper, which is so much easier to use.</li>
    <li> I Used to buy a much more expensive face oil, but this works loads better and the bottle is 4 times the size. I never get a tight itchy feeling in my face and my pours look smaller.</li>
    <li> I have been using Argan oil to moisturize my face for about a year now. It is usually very pricey so I was happy to find this well-price product on Amazon. . Very pleased with my purchase!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this oil for several weeks and am so happy I decided to try it based on the reviews here. I use on pump on wet hair, and it leaves my hair so silky and shiny without weighing it down. I also use it as an intense conditioner sometimes, on dry hair overnight. Since reading up on argan oil I began using it on my skin as well and love how it makes my face feel. I was hesitant to use an oil on my face but it has made my complexion brighter and my skin feels so healthy, with absolutely no breakouts. I really feel argan oil is a miracle product, and love what it&#x27;s done not just for my hair but skin as well.</li>
    <li> So much better than drugstore products. Very rich. Love it.</li>
    <li> This is an amazing oil.  It goes on very smoothly, soaks in quickly and feels great.  I&#x27;m a 67 year old ski instructor and my face gets a lot of weathering.  The Argan Oil really helps with the dryness and wrinkling.  I also like the subtle and intriguing aroma of the oil.  I expect to use this daily for the rest of my life.  The Pura d&#x27;or company is attentive to detail - packaging the oil in a cute little bag and multi-lingual usage directions.  I will be buying this product again and sharing it with friends.</li>
    <li> This product is great! It has helped to clear up my face and makes my hair so soft!</li>
    <li> very good and right,,,good price</li>
    <li> This argan oil is great for the price ans my skin has never looked better. I started using it as a moisturizer before bed and pre makeup and it works great.</li>
    <li> My oil is excellent. Price is great. Will purchase again.</li>
    <li> I have a perm and my hair is dyed every 5 weeks.  I need hydration and many products to keep this &amp;#34;mop&amp;#34; of hair looking good.&lt;br /&gt;This Pura d&#x27;or Argan Oil is the icing on the cake so to speak.  My hair looks silky and smooth.  Very positive review.</li>
    <li> Excellent for hair loss and makes hair smooth</li>
    <li> I bought this brand of argan oil a week ago and have been using it on my hair, face, and legs. I really do like it! I was using coconut oil on my daughter&#x27;s curly hair and did not like the way it smelled and how it made her hair feel oily. This argan oil is a much better choice! It makes her hair shinny and slick, but not oily! Love it for that! I will continue to use this products on my hair and skin, as well as my daughter&#x27;s hair.</li>
    <li> I have used for a few weeks but it&#x27;s amazing. I am always barefoot in the summer and my heels pay for it.&lt;br /&gt;I been using at night and my heels have much improved!</li>
    <li> I have used this product for about 6 months and see a noticeable difference in my skin.  Very hydrated, and softens the lines in my face.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this stuff. I use it in my hair to get a nice soft, silky finish. This stuff is liquid gold!</li>
    <li> This oil is one the best you can use to beautify, heal the skin, hair and nail. It is natural and organic which the best way to go. It makes the hair and body feel rejuvenated and shiny. The smell is also good, which is important as it can be applied when ever you desire. So go ahead and try it to find its true benefits.</li>
    <li> I used Josie Maran for a while, but gave this a shot because of the price.  I can&#x27;t tell a difference between the two.  I used to get really itchy, dry skin, and this just about fixed me when other lotions and oils didn&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> I have been trying to find something to help with my scalp psoriasis. The prescription medication prices are out of control. I heard about using different kinds of oil, from mineral to olive oil. Mineral oil did nothing and olive oil left me with something that looked like sever dandruff.&lt;br /&gt;I guess I read about argon oil after researching home remedies. For $20 I thought it was worth a try. This stuff is pretty darn good. It helps to really control the think scales of psoriasis on my scalp. I still have psoriasis-there is no cure, but Pura d or Argon oil really reduced the scales to where I don&#x27;t have flakes of skin in my hair that people can see.</li>
    <li> My skin feels super soft. Great for dry winter time use on my face. Great quality product. Easy pump.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff!  I use it every day for dry skin and it works beautifully.  It helped with my eczema on my hands and hydrates my face just right.  I had problems with acne, but this helped clear it up.</li>
    <li> I love this product.  I have been using it everyday and noticed that the change of the  texture of my skin.  Thanks</li>
    <li> Excellent product. Ordered extras for my sister and mom.</li>
    <li> I love using argan oil as a facial moisturizer, and as a hair treatment.  I have thick hair which can be dry - but a small amount  makes my hair shiny and swingy.  Dry skin during the winter is no longer a problem, the argan oil is absorbed quickly in my skin, never clogs pores.  I had used a much more expensive &amp;#34;name brand&amp;#34; previously...there is No difference, except in price</li>
    <li> heals rough and itchy skin almost immediately and produces a healthy glow.</li>
    <li> So far, so good. I have been using jojoba oil for a few years now, but it just doesn&#x27;t cut it during Winter.  This oil is much more moisturizing, and doesn&#x27;t make me break out.</li>
    <li> I LOVE IT!  This is quite honestly the best hair care product I&#x27;ve ever used.  I have been using this product everyday for two weeks and the improvement to the shine and health of my hair is phenomenal.  I have used store brand &amp;#34;argan oil&amp;#34; products for years and they don&#x27;t even come close to the quality of this product.  100% argan oil is a staple for healthy, shiny hair.  I highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> I purchased this oil to use on my face as argan oil has many anti-aging properties.  My search for a pure organic argan oil with no perfumes or additives proved to be difficult.&lt;br /&gt;But I found exactly what I was looking for in this product.&lt;br /&gt;Pura d&#x27;or provides only the most concentrated organic argan oil products I have been able to find.&lt;br /&gt;My husband also uses their hair loss shampoo with much approval.&lt;br /&gt;We highly recommend!</li>
    <li> I live in California. Whenevr I wash my hair they become dry, frizzy. This is a perfect solution. My hair look soft, shiny, less frizzy and manageable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just love it.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks!</li>
    <li> I love the texture of this oil - it is moisturizing yet not greasy. It is odorless. This organic argan oil is a wonderful hair and skin oil. I appreciate quick delivery.</li>
    <li> I received my bottle of Argan oil a few weeks ago and am amazed at how much my face has improved, being clearer and also more even toned.  It soaks completely into your skin which I like because my skin is dry and needs the moisture.  I even add it to my shampoo  and my hair has much more shine.  It&#x27;s amazing and I would recommend this product to everyone to use.</li>
    <li> The first i brought this product, i was not clear how to use this product and the hair problems i or my child have. Up on reading the reviews i figured out the way for me and child. This oil has transformed our hair to a manageable state and feel without it hair is flying over every where with life. Now i have brought another one. I use not only for hair, body and face. It does magic overnight on my dry skin.</li>
    <li> Item arrived on time and was as described.</li>
    <li> I had ordered 2 bottles from Amazon. i just finished my first bottle. Im 55 but people never believe me. I love using nothing but  this Pure Organic Argan Oil on my face. I usually just wash with water and apply arga  after and I have a beautiful complextion.</li>
    <li> An excellent quality Argan Oil, good value for the price.  A small amount applied to hair makes it shiny and healthy looking.</li>
    <li> Great oil, it make my skin feel so soft.</li>
    <li> This stuff is fantastic!  Why did it take me so long to find it??!!  I told my sister about it and she started laughing because she had just sent me a bottle for my birthday.  Love it!</li>
    <li> The Pura d&#x27;or argan oil is smooth, lightweight and leaves your skin soft and refreshed.  It&#x27;s a great product and I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing!  Just goes to show you don&#x27;t have to go out and drop mega bucks at department stores to get a product that works. This stuff works just as well ,if not better than the super expensive Josie Maran argan oil (which happens to cost twice as much). What I like is that it&#x27;s 100%a pure organic and cold pressed. It feels good to know that I&#x27;m not smearing a bunch of potentially harmful chemicals on my skin. It only takes about two pumps to cover my face, neck, and the upper part of my chest. In the morning my skin is glowing. Love Love Love this stuff.</li>
    <li> My hairdresser recommended argan oil for my hair, which is growing in grey with some wiry texture. I researched many brands of argan oil. I knew I wanted cold pressed and organic, and decided upon this brand because of the price and the good reviews. I&#x27;m really glad I did, it seems like a great oil...not at all greasy, no smell that I have noticed and my hair is actually already softer after using for only a few days. I&#x27;m going to try it on my face next and will incorporate it into a beard oil for my husband. I would definitely recommend pura d&#x27;or.</li>
    <li> Good Product. Doesn&#x27;t clog pores and helps keep skin moisturized. It&#x27;s especially good during the wintertime when skin dries out easier. Would buy again.</li>
    <li> This argan oil is perfect. Along with healthy changes in my diet, it has really helped heal my acne and acne scars. Aside from this, it smells great and keeps my skin much softer than it has been in years. And i&#x27;m quite sure it has made me look younger, even though i&#x27;m not too worried about that since i&#x27;m nineteen and have always looked young for my age. Regardless, it has helped in giving my skin baby soft texture and clarity. I use it for my hair as well, and it keeps my curly hair in perfect condition, not too weighed down or frizzy. One of the things i love most is that its quality sure compensates for the price. A little goes a long way, I hardly use more than 2 drops for my face daily and 3-4 for my hair while it&#x27;s wet. It lasts a good while, so it beats spending $50 over a long period of time for cheaper moisturizers. In fact, if used for hair as well, you may end up spending less money than you would on moisturizers and hair products. I would encourage anyone to use this</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been reading about the amazing moisturizing and anti-aging properties of argan oil for some time now. After purchasing Pura D&#x27;or Pure &amp; Organic Argan Oil, I can attest that it truly is good stuff. The oil is extremely moisturizing without leaving your skin oily. It absorbs easily and has a pleasant, slightly nutty scent to it. I love to put in on my face and lips just before going to sleep. I wake up with my skin refreshed, subtle, and glowing. I love it!</li>
    <li> Amazing product!  I have tried many different oils, moisturizers and this is by far the best.  Totally evened out my skin tone without leaving a greasy residue on my face.  No sunscreen needed with this oil.  Totally in love.  Will use for life.  Thanks.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried other (more expensive) argan oils in that past that made my skin look lovely. I stopped using them because of the price and my skin lost its glow. I happened upon Pura&#x27;s Argan oil and found it is of the same quality as the other brands that I&#x27;ve tried, but at a far better price! I also love that it&#x27;s all natural and there are no added fillers. It&#x27;s non-greasy and my skin absorbs it fast so I&#x27;m able to use it as a night time moisturizer. My skin is regaining its glow!</li>
    <li> This product is completely natural according to the ingredients and matched my expectations.</li>
    <li> This did really do anything special.</li>
    <li> I was a skeptic. I reluctantly tried a very high-dollar Argan oil on my hair and decided it was worth trying, but did not want to spend that much money on a small bottle. Pura d&#x27;or has changed my skeptical take on Argan oil. I love the simplicity of one product to use on hair, nails, face, neck. I have had a small spot on forehead at my hairline that just wouldn&#x27;t heal, likely should have had it removed a couple of years ago. This product has healed this area completely. I am sold on this product, and honestly wouldn&#x27;t want to be without it! I&#x27;d like to order a second one to keep on my bedside table. Really great stuff!&lt;br /&gt;~Judie S</li>
    <li> This product is very versatile.  I use it on my hair, face, and add it to my body lotions.  I&#x27;m very pleased with the results I get from this product.  It moisturizes as well as any other product that I have used.  I use it on my face as my moisturizer and add a sunscreen.  It works for me.  I use it every other day on my hair and it decreases fly aways and gives it moderate shine.  Will buy again.</li>
    <li> Best oil, leave your hair silky soft. Even used it as a hot oil treatment.</li>
    <li> I recently decided to switch from using shampoo to washing my hair with the &amp;#34;no poo method.&amp;#34; I did this because shampoos are increasingly adding nasty ingredients that my skin reacts negatively to, so out of frustration I had to try something. For those that are familiar with the no poo method, you also know it takes about 6 weeks to get your hair to recover with it, but that&#x27;s actually dependent on the length of your hair. My hair is quite long, and is very thick and curly. After stating my frustration that my hair was un-brushable with the no poo method, someone had suggested that if I try the argan oil as a way to condition my hair. So I did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A little bit goes a long way, and the first time I tried it, my hair was way too greasy. The second time I was more stingy on the oil, and my hair not only brushed out beautifully, but  also feels soft and amazing, better than after any expensive conditioner I have tried periously. I find I only need to use a little bit of this oil once a week, and I&#x27;m able to continue the no poo method of shampooing my hair. Which is wonderful as now I don&#x27;t have to go back to using shampoos and conditioners that include horrible ingredients.</li>
    <li> This is the best hair product I have ever used, never sticky, no scent, just leave your hair super soft and shiny, you can also use it on your face before you go to bed and keep your skin from drying out in winter. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I have been using argan oil for years.  Great for my hair and skin and a little goes  long way.  I was spend upwards of $90 for pure oil.  When I discovered your oil, read the reviews, And the pricing, I decided to order.  You cannot go wrong with this product; it is the real deal.</li>
    <li> This product has been amazing for my face, nails, hands and hair!!! I have used it only for 2 weeks!! My face is more even toned and have noticed a wrinkle reduction, my hands and cuticles are softer, and my hair looks healthier. I recommend this product to anyone.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this I use it everyday and my skin looks great!</li>
    <li> i&#x27;ve been using this argan oil as a face moisturizer- i love it! 1-2 pumps of oil is all you need for your face (it&#x27;s been about 4 months and i&#x27;m just running out). i was skeptical of using oil on my combination skin, but after reading so many good reviews, decided to give it a shot. the first week i did notice my skin seemed more oily than usual, but after that, i noticed such an improvement. before, i had always just used whatever chemical-filled face lotion was on sale from local drugstores and by the afternoon, the t-zone area would be super oily. after a couple weeks of using this oil daily, i can go all day without being worried about all the extra shine!</li>
    <li> I have very thick curly hair and with years of hair coloring it had become really very dry and frizzy. I was looking for a hair product that could help and came upon this product on Amazon. After seeing such good reviews I decided to purchase it. So far, it has been very good for my hair. Within a week of using it I can see a difference. It is not sticky, no scent, and has given my hair a nice shine. I have yet to try the product in my hands or face, but so far I am very happy with the purchase.</li>
    <li> I ordered this thinking it would work miracles because of all the positive reviews I read. It&#x27;s okay. I tried some on my face and did not see it do anything for it. I tried it on the ends of my hair and I liked it more for that. It made it look a little less dry, and you can see the layers more on my haircut.</li>
    <li> I have thin hair and use this product after showering &amp; it made my hair a bit greasy looking but not heavily greasy. I use a couple drops to rub through my hair n leave it over night if I am putting my hair up the next day. I also used it for about a week on my face only at night before bed as well bc my face already gets a little oily through out the day with make up... it doesn&#x27;t seem to feel toooo thick, and so far seems like a good moisturizer for after washing your face if you don&#x27;t mind the oily feeling..</li>
    <li> A M A Z I N G!! I am a Dialysis patient &amp; for those who know, dialysis leaves our skin completely depleted of..everything! i have tried every cream, pill, serum, u name it, on the market to address this issue, to no avail. so after reading the reviews on this  one, i decided to believe the hype one last time; THANK GOD I DID. The results were immediate; as soon as i applied it, i noticed the difference. being the skeptical creature that i am, i first decided to use it on one side of my body, to be able to compare and see if there was really a difference, and there was..HUGE!! I am definitely not gonna run out of this one..ordering more. HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!</li>
    <li> Moroccan oil is much better than this!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a male with extremely dry skin. My girlfriend suggested argan oil by Josie Maran from QVC to me. I purchased and had very good results, product is fantastic but PRICEY. After a month or two I decided to try Amazon for an Argan Oil product. After reading reviews I decided to try Pura d&#x27;or. I received the same results, with a better dispense of product source and a much, much, better price! You have a new customer</li>
    <li> Good product for my hair.</li>
    <li> Does not help hair growth</li>
    <li> very oily, if you have sensitive skin you probably won&#x27;t use it</li>
    <li> This oil has helped keep my extremely dry skin moisturized and glowing through the cold, northeast winter!  Love it!</li>
    <li> This was really light and smooth on my hair.  I have very curly, dryish hair, and I often run a hair straightener flat iron over it.  I just need a little, and it seems to cover my hair without feeling greasy.  It makes a huge difference in protecting your hair!  My hair seemed to straighten better and flatter after applying the oil and using the straightener.  I worry about the damage with hair straightening, but this makes me feel better.  I like this oil, since it is has no smell and absorbs well.  I used a cheaper product before, and it didn&#x27;t work as well and had a bad smell.  Overall, I think Argan Oil has a great consistency, not too thick or sticky but still does the job.  I also use coconut oil on my hair, but Argan oil feels less heavy.  I love that this one is organic and feels pure.  Great product!</li>
    <li> I am a 63 yr.old female w/exema. I have spent lots of money trying to find something that will take care of the scaley skin. I have recently had really dry lips and everything I tried Made sours on my mouth. My granddaughter had some Argan oil and suggested I use it on my lips and face. After 6 days I am almost healed up. Good product.</li>
    <li> This product is immediately absorbed into the skin &amp; feels soft instantly! Its fragrance free too.</li>
    <li> This Argon oil is awesome! I was contemplating purchasing another well known Argon oil competitor that was more expensive but decided to give this one a try. I&#x27;m so glad I did. I love using natural essential oils on my skin but a lot of the oils that I&#x27;ve tried have been too heavy for my face. This oil is light and is so smooth. Also, I&#x27;ve always struggled with acne and blemish marks on my face but after a few weeks of use, my face is glowing! I would definitely purchase this item again.</li>
    <li> will buy again, it does absorb to your skin without leaving a greasy feeling. I also use it in my hair.</li>
    <li> a little really goes a long way. i put maybe 2 pumps on the left side of my head and 2 on the right and the ends look oily!!&lt;br /&gt;I also used it on my face (which is always red and irritated looking, can only use fragrance free Eucerin ) and it felt great! the dry patches that i get on my cheeks are already better after one use, and so are my chronically dry in the winter elbows</li>
    <li> So far I am loving this product.  It has helped heal some cracked skin I had on my fingers and it is a great smoother for my hair.  A little goes a long way and it penetrates my skin well leaving no residue.  There is no scent to this either so it is truly light feeling and subtle.</li>
    <li> Its okay but its not pure argon oil.Alicia skin pretty dry after use its not a moisturizing for your skin I will not buy anymore</li>
    <li> I love this natural, fragrance free, organic oil.  I use it on my face, under my eyes, and on my fine hair before using curling iron, to protect it from the heat.  I sometimes put it on my hair when it&#x27;s dry, leave it in overnight to condition, then shampoo out in the morning.  My sweetie has thick wavy hair and loves using this argan oil to de-frizz. My first bottle lasted me almost a year, but I use it more frequently now so will probable be buying it 2 or 3 times per year.  A great product at a great price! I love rubbing it into my nails and cuticles too.</li>
    <li> Great for face. Makes skin so smooth. Also great in winter on dry hair.</li>
    <li> I love this product! My hair is really damaged and I was looking for something to make my hair healthier and softer. I&#x27;ve been using it for about three months and my hair is much softer and isn&#x27;t breaking off nearly as bad as it used to and its actually starting to grow and looks healthy again. The bottle has a good amount in it to start with and I still have plenty of it left. I will be buying this product again.</li>
    <li> This oil is very light, yet perfect ofr hair and face.  It&#x27;s the first one that I don&#x27;t get a reaction to on my face.  Could be that it doesn&#x27;t have other chemicals in it!!</li>
    <li> This was very light oil. It made hair and facial skin soft and healthy. It does not make it greasy. Recommend using Pura d&#x27;or Argan Oil just 2 drops for face and neck, 3 drops for hands and may be 3-4 drops for long hair.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this brand of Argan oil for about a year and a half. It&#x27;s amazing. It has a very light scent (less of a scent than other brands!) and a very light golden color. The scent isn&#x27;t floral, so don&#x27;t expect it to smell like so many other fragranced products! It has a natural smell. I think it&#x27;s nice personally. Not overpowering or offensive. The oil though, it&#x27;s the only thing that has worked on my incredibly dry cheeks! I use it once or twice a day depending on my dryness. I also noticed a significant decrease in my crows feet since using it. I can use the extra on my hand in my hair ends and it feels soft and lovely! But too much in your hair can happen quickly, so proceed with caution! The pump is nice (I know I use 2 pumps each time). This is also a great price for this much Argan Oil! I love it and I will continue using Pura d&#x27;or for a long as they will make it!</li>
    <li> I have used other brands of argan oil, but i think this product is the best! I use it daily on my face and then through my hair if needed. I am 65 yrs old and can use all the moisturizing I can get!</li>
    <li> My 3 year old&#x27;s skin was dry and scratchy. After trying many remedies recommended by our pediatrician, I read about this oil on someone&#x27;s blog. After 3 days of applying a few drops at night and morning to the affected spots, it is a night and day improvement. She stopped itching and it is almost cleared it to the point that you wouldn&#x27;t know she had skin issues if not told.</li>
    <li> This oil is amazing! I have extremely dry hair and itchy scalp. After using this oil, my hair is soft and silky. I have also started using on my skin but the expense holds me back from using it daily. I was skeptical at first, but the product made me a believer. Highly recommend! Beware of Afghan oils that are not 100%.</li>
    <li> I love this product. I use it as a facial moisturizer and it works beautifully! I haven&#x27;t tried it yet in hair care or for its other many uses. My skin looks so refreshed that I don&#x27;t feel the need to wear makeup anymore.</li>
    <li> So far its doing  it&#x27;s  job.</li>
    <li> Great product for clear skin.</li>
    <li> It is organic and I love this product and it is cheaper than SwansonVitamins.com.  I have been using it for long time but this Pura d&#x27;or 100% Pure &amp; USDA Organic Argan Oil (4 fl. oz.)  is the first time I bought especially for hair growth and face.  I t is a great way of having moisturizers for hair &amp; face and full body, rather than buying expensive creams.</li>
    <li> I have severely chapped lips. I&#x27;ve tried many lip balms, but none of them works as well as this Argan oil. It&#x27;s not greasy and waxy like other lip balms. It keeps my lips very soft and hydrated. It works very well as moisturizer for my face too. I wear this under my Dior foundation.</li>
    <li> This argan oil is amazing!  I have dry / combination skin, but after using the oil on my face every night after cleansing, my skin is soft and glowing.  The oil is moisturizing without being greasy -- I even use it in the morning to keep my skin glowing all day.  I also use it on my hands, elbows, anywhere my skin is a bit dry, and it keeps my skin moisturized for hours.  I was turned on to Pura d&#x27;or argan oil by my friend with curly hair, who uses it on her hair and face daily and LOVES it.  Based on her rave reviews, I tried it, and now I am giving a rave review myself for how great this is!  Love that it&#x27;s organic, cold pressed, unrefined, too!</li>
    <li> Wonderful product - I have dry hair and a couple sprays solves that problem, also great for hands and face. I have used a similar product at twice the price and this is better.</li>
    <li> I really like this. The smell, texture and quality of this oil seems to be spot on. A dark glass bottle also helps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this on my hair, nails and sometimes skin. It seems to protect my hair well for heat styling in a natural way which is why I bought it. I loved the info booklet inside too!</li>
    <li> I fail to see what all the raves are about.  When I used a small amount in my hair and I mean smaller than a pea size and I have below the shoulder length hair, it made my hair greasy.  Also did nothing for my skin or nails.  Do yourself a favor and spend the $25.00 elsewhere as this product is a huge disappointment.  I should have went with the brand I originally was going to purchase but I trusted all the great reviews here.  What a mistake that was!</li>
    <li> This stuff is nothing short of AMAZING! I go through hair product after hair product, and I have Never found something that changed the life of my hair like this does! I am always looking up reviews for almost everything, and they always seem to contradict each other and confuse the heck out of me! But if there was a reviewer you could trust, let it be me! This stuff is the Holy Grail of hair products!</li>
    <li> I live in a desert and my eczema has worsened over the past few years. It&#x27;s to the point of taking topical steroids for bad facial peeling.&lt;br /&gt;I stumbled upon something that said argon oil had similar ph as our skin and was good for dry or oily skin.&lt;br /&gt;I decided to see my results were after a few weeks of use.&lt;br /&gt;My dry patches are all gone, I am no longer using prescription lotions. My skin has a beautiful dewy sheen unlike the dry dull look it normally has. I do not have to use any expensive facial cream! I love this. I also mix in some melaleuca oil that I purchased from doterra if I get a few break outs. I absolutely LOVE this oil and the fact that it&#x27;s so incredibly cheap compared to some ridiculous creams I have wasted money on at sephora. For $20 why would you NOT try this?</li>
    <li> I use this on my face at night after a chemical exfoliate. It is amazing! It leaves my skin feeling soft and refreshed. It is very moisturizing also; I no longer wake up with flaky dry skin. It also do not beak me out like so many moisturizers. I am now a lifetime user.</li>
    <li> I am absolutely happy with the results ...my skin and hair have a noticeable difference and I only have to use a fraction of what I used with other products. Leaving my skin so soft without any residue behind on my clothes... I am in love !!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m on my second bottle.Loving it</li>
    <li> I am very happy with the quality of this product, and will be ordering more soon. I have incredibly dry skin. Winter is a bad time for me, and this helps greatly.</li>
    <li> Wow this is amazing for my skin even on my face. Makes my skin appear supple and Dewey ! My boyfriend even complimented me and I&#x27;ve noticed my acne scars are healing and I&#x27;ve had less breakouts since using it.</li>
    <li> I am using this oil for couple of months now and just loved it! It is very good for dry skin. I can really feel difference now. Very happy with my purchase!!</li>
    <li> It is a great oil for hair and face. Hair: works as a milk de-frizz oil without making your scalp oily. Face: Perfect moisturizer for face in winter.&lt;br /&gt;So far no issues, will continue to use it.</li>
    <li> This stuff is absolutely amazing. I can&#x27;t believe all these years I have been using expensive face creams from upscale department stores and none of them compare to the results of this amazing face care. This leaves my skin feeling supple, velvety, moisturized and luxurious. Wish I had known about this a long time ago and saved myself a lot of money!!!!!</li>
    <li> love that it&#x27;s certified organic...so many aren&#x27;t. I use it on my hair, nails and skin.</li>
    <li> Since beginning to use it 3-1/2 weeks ago, I can see an improvement the texture of my hair and my nails have developed smooth cuticles and are growing stronger and faster without cracking / splitting.&lt;br /&gt;The oil also feels nice after a shower and does not leave any greasy or sticky residue.&lt;br /&gt;It is a winner as far as I am concerned.</li>
    <li> My skin has been going through extreme dryness lately. As a former pro make-up artist, I have access to the best brands in the beauty business. Unfortunately, nothing was working for me. I read a review of this and another popular brand that cost over 2x as much. I am so happy I purchased this oil! My skin felt hydrated immediately. What I liked is that the product didn&#x27;t go into the skin and leave me feeling dry, my skin felt smooth and hydrated all day long. I will probably use this bottle up pretty quickly because I love how it makes my skin feel!</li>
    <li> This is a very good product! I&#x27;m already using the shampoo and conditioner, this is the icing on the cake. My hairloss is way less. I woul recommend the whole Pura d&#x27;or line :)</li>
    <li> I bought this to use as an ingredient in a DIY hair masque that I am making with Argan Oil, shea butter and coconut oil.  I was making it for gifts.  Now that I&#x27;ve made it, I don&#x27;t know if I want to give any of it away because it also works as a great skin moisturizer...maybe the best one I&#x27;ve ever used.  Winter air is extremely arid here in Colorado and our skin gets itchy and dry.  I used the oil mix  after a bath yesterday and could still feel the difference hours later when I went to bed.  I had used plain coconut oil before which was good, but the other ingredients make it even better.</li>
    <li> Very pure Argan oil. I put it on my face and hair at night and I feel the difference the next morning. I like that it barely smells, unlike any other type of oils. Highly recommend it</li>
    <li> Great to use on dry skin. Works perfect on hair. I have even used as whole body moisturizer. Love this product&amp;#60;3</li>
    <li> I wanted to order Argan oil from QVC but they are so expensive. I found out thru one of the reviews that I can get the same at Amazon without the high cost. Boy I am glad I did. I love that my hands are so soft. I use it on my Face, Hair and body and my hands daily. It is not messy and oily like some others. It soaks in. I would recommend it to anybody who wants to try Argan oil.</li>
    <li> I likes the product because it nourishes my hair and provide it with a little shine which make it feel nice</li>
    <li> I rarely write reviews although I depend on them tremendously when purchasing anything. I discovered Argan oil last year and have been using them daily. If you have dry skin Argan oil is really wonderful. I switched to Pura d&#x27;or because of the rave reviews. When I use it I do feel a difference than the brand I used to get. Pura d&#x27;or is thicker and somehow I feel the skin absorbs it faster, thus I actually need less amount of oil on my face than before. I love this product and this company now and their price for a 4oz bottle is terrific.</li>
    <li> So happy I finally made the switch from Chi&#x27;s hair serum to this product. I&#x27;ve slowing been switching over all of my personal care products to healthier, natural, organic products and I&#x27;m happy to say that I&#x27;ve found a winner with this one. Just after a few days of use my hair is silkier and healthier than ever! Anxious to try other Pura d&#x27;or products.</li>
    <li> Being acne prone I was looking to find a good organic oil that is well tolerated on the face. After reading about it and seeing so many great reviews I decided to give it a try. I use it right after cleaning for bed and sometimes in very cold mornings. The package was very well put together and lovely, and delivery was on time. I&#x27;m overall very satisfied with my purchase.</li>
    <li> I got this for my girl friend and she seems to like it. She usually uses the morroccan oil but when looking at reviews people recommended this and it was cheaper.</li>
    <li> it helps dramendous against my psoriasis</li>
    <li> Excellent product for dry skin.  I smooth this oil on my face while showering... it does wonders!  Argan oil is easily absorbed into the skin, which I have not found when using grape seed or olive oils.  I can also use this product during the day when my skin is especially dry.  It&#x27;s wonderful.  Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Excellent product. As I age my skin and hair have become dryer. I use it on my hair and face. It is better than olive oil or coconut oil because it soaks into the skin. I love how it makes my face feel. I have been using this oil for years and I absolutely love it. I have given bottles to friends and family. I use it on my face every morning and hands and hair after shampooing.</li>
    <li> This oil is a far better product than any other oil I have tried! I&#x27;m a guy and I have always had longish hair. I use it in my hair witch was so brittle until I found Pura dor, after using this product for a week or so, my hair started to transform back the way it was 20 yrs. ago. I use a small amount in the shower after washing my hair. I massage it in real good getting my scalp good then comb it through  then dry and it is perfect. Also after showering I&#x27;ll spray it on all my skin and it keeps your skin nice, plus it has a nice smell! It is a great product 5 stars all the way.</li>
    <li> The product is on time and I am so happy with this product.</li>
    <li> Excellent product...really love it!</li>
    <li> I just wanted that for a long time I have been looking for a product that was all natural as well as a product that stood behind what its purpose was. Pura D&#x27;or did just that. My daughter suffers from eczema and the doctors had given her numerous treatment suggestions and it just seemed as if nothing worked for her.    A friend of mine recommended this product and you know what? I have to say that I am very pleased. After about 2 weeks of regular use, I could see the difference in my daugher&#x27;s skin as well as less itching and discomfort for her.    I would definately recommend this product. I am a believer and will continue to use this product as long as it is on the market. Thank you! Anderson</li>
    <li> -READ- (118ml bottle) Good product! ..not even too greasy to be an oil.&lt;br /&gt;But as shown by pics, in the sealed container there was about 10mm of missing product, a bit too much given the amount of product and the price!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ps - 10mm taken by each bottle means that every 5 packages sold is $25 more for free.</li>
    <li> Really, really love this product.  My daughters and I were looking for something light and natural to use as a facial moisturizer.  We had been using coconut oil for a long time and liked it except for the heavy greasy feeling.  I read that Argan oil was a good product to use, and I looked on Amazon and found the Pura d&#x27;or product.  We really love it!  It is light and really works well. My skin looks great!  I also have a recent surgical scar, and the Argan Oil has really helped that heal nicely.  We are sold on this product, and the price was nice also!!  We will continue to purchase this product, and tell friends.</li>
    <li> This product really works. I had a severe issue of dry skin, especially in the winter months, but this oil really solves it. I have used it once a day, after cleansing my face, for a month now, and my face has never been so soft. I don&#x27;t need to (and I wouldn&#x27;t) use any moisturizer or anything. The best thing about this product is that I have used so little of it. One pump a day for a whole month and the oil level barely lowered. I can see myself one bottle for a whole year.&lt;br /&gt;Also, I applied this to my surgery scar and it has definitely become lighter, softer, and more subtle.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I would really recommend this product to anyone.</li>
    <li> This product did nothing for my hair. I used it on my wet hair, just a dimes worth and my hair felt greasy after I dried it. My hair is long, to the middle of my back. I didn&#x27;t think I used to much. I tried again, but this time I used half of a dime on dry hair and the results were worse. I would not recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Just got and it&#x27;s already doing wonders for my hair. My son&#x27;s hair is very dry. One use and it&#x27;s almost as soft as when he was born. I&#x27;m already in love and the price is great.</li>
    <li> A drop of this oil goes a long way! What a great potion for moisturizing dry skin! On top of that, it also helps with my dry, brittle hair! Get this and you won&#x27;t regret it!</li>
    <li> This is the best face oil I have used. I have had some major skin conditions and my face has been very sensitive to many of the creams, oils and lotions in the market. I have eczema too. But this oil has been great so far and really leaves my skin feeling soft and rejuvenated. I especially love it when I leave it overnight and find a better skin the next morning. Really recommend this especially for face but can have other great uses too.</li>
    <li> Smells a little Like olive oil. Hope they didn&#x27;t use the same cold press. Cheaper than others</li>
    <li> I usually get argan oil from my Moroccan bestie when her family visits Morocco and was worried about buying it on my own for the first time. There&#x27;s so much out there about how much quality can vary from brand to brand. After reading and comparing for days I decided on Pura d&#x27;or for its excellent reviews and cheaper-than-most price point and held my breath til it arrived well within the estimated free shipping time. Verdict: AWESOME. Love the packaging - only complaint is that the pump can drip a little sometimes and argan oil&#x27;s so precious that I wince every time it happens. The oil itself is nice and thick, smells clean, and goes on well. I use it mainly for moisturising my face -- 2 pumps and I&#x27;m good! Occasionally one more pump across my cheeks as needed to combat the dry skin Ottawa&#x27;s brutal winters try to provoke. I&#x27;m a month into this bottle and my skin is glowing, soft, and breakout-free, yay! Super glad I decided on Pura d&#x27;or - I&#x27;d definitely buy it again, and strongly recommend it for anyone and everyone&#x27;s argan oil needs!</li>
    <li> Love this stuff - I&#x27;m using is as a moisturizer after cleansing my face.  It&#x27;s like and absorbs - you only need a little.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff! I use it mostly on my face after cleansing as a moisturizer, but the excess I rub through my hair and nails. Works great!</li>
    <li> This is such an amazing product. I really like this argan oil. You can use this oil on your hair or on your face or nail. After use this oil in my hair and face my hairs becomes very silky and shiny like celebrity look! And my face skin becomes baby soft! I love this argan oil. And would love to buy this product again from amazon. And purad&#x27;or did wonderful job for this amazing oil. I definitely recommend this oil to all who wants to get celebrity look! And the price is really worth to get this amazing oil. I think everyone should have to try this product. It&#x27;s totally organic so it doesn&#x27;t have any side effects or anything like that. I definitely recommend this product. I really love Purad&#x27;or. Thanks Purad&#x27;or! :)</li>
    <li> I just ordered my first bottle! So excited!!  Although I have not yet tried this product, I have heard many wonderful things about it. I hope it works. For now i will give it five star :)</li>
    <li> Very nice so far! It&#x27;s moisturizing without being too greasy.</li>
    <li> I love this oil -- for hair and face.  It is not at all greasy.  My hair feels nourished and manageable. I have had many comments on the shine of my hair since I started using Argan.  And it protects my face and lips from the winter dryness much better than my regular much more expensive face lotion.  So glad a friend recommended this.</li>
    <li> excellent oil! i use it for my face and never felt face so moisturized and soft. i had tried other brand before (acura), it didnt work for my skin type.&lt;br /&gt;i will say this is the best argan oil!</li>
    <li> Love the fact that it is odorless,organic and can be used for hair and skin.</li>
    <li> I have used this on my toenails after having polish on them for most of the year and they are in much better condition now. I also use it in my hair for moisture and shine. I&#x27;m very happy with the product!</li>
    <li> Odorless and works well on my wife&#x27;s hair which is otherwise frizzy.</li>
    <li> I bought this for thinning hair and dry skin.  I have to say that my hair is the healthiest it has been in months.  I also use a few drops with my L&#x27;Occitane shea butter after shower and it keeps my skin moist and smooth in the winter.</li>
    <li> I use it on my face. It moisturizes my oily skin well and absorbs quickly leaving it soft and hydrated.</li>
    <li> I love this product!  Argan oil is one of the few oils that I can use on my face daily without breaking out.  My skin is much smoother and softer!</li>
    <li> Great product, works great on my skin and felt the difference instantly. Will buy again thats for sure!</li>
    <li> Has a delicate clean smell and the USDA Organic seal of approval.</li>
    <li> Great for beard maintenance.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve heard good things about Argan oil, so I wanted to give it a try. So far, I use it for my hair and hands. I just take a few drops and rub it in. It makes my hair look healthy, smooth, but not greasy. I just put it in my hair below my ears, not on top. It has a faint scent that I don&#x27;t notice after a while. I haven&#x27;t tried other Argan oils, but I would recommend this one.</li>
    <li> Great clean product, leaves my skin and hair feeling very smooth. Reasonably priced and arrived on time.</li>
    <li> Argan oil is the only moisturizer I&#x27;ll use on my face and I&#x27;ve been using Josie Maran but it&#x27;s so pricey that I decided to look for something more cost effective. Pura d&#x27;or works just as well and you get so much more for your money! I&#x27;ll definitely be buying again!</li>
    <li> Great oil! I mix this with Juniper Berry Essential oil for my daughter&#x27;s eczema. Seems to be working well.</li>
    <li> I love this oil!  I had intended to use this primarily for my face (and have used it a couple of times, it&#x27;s really nice without being greasy).  However, I found that the healing properties of this oil greatly improved some minor burns.  I first used this when my scalp got sunburned where my part is. Ouch! On day two, I remembered this oil and thought, why not?  I applied a small amount and the next morning the pain was gone. Even better, it never peeled (YAY!!!).  The other day, I burned a 2 inch patch of my hand on a 450 degree oven. After a bit of ice, I applied this oil. The next morning the pain was gone. By day three, with a couple of applications per day, the redness was gone. Dramatic improvement. I showed my coworkers, I was so excited. My dad is ordering as well to help with his cracked hands. Love this product!</li>
    <li> I love this oil! I&#x27;ve been using for over a month. My face is clear and looks very healthy. It doesn&#x27;t feel oily or greasy - I use it at night and it absorbs completely. Sometimes I even use it in the morning under my make-up. I&#x27;m hooked!</li>
    <li> Very good product. I have dry sensitive skin and it works very well on my temperamental skin.</li>
    <li> LOVE THIS PRODUCT! I think the first oil that actually soaks into your skin and hair as you apply it, no oily feeling when putting your clothes on and it&#x27;s wonderful! It works, run don&#x27;t walk for this Pura d&#x27;or oil for hair, body, cuticles and dry skin.</li>
    <li> I love this product! It has made my skin and hair so soft and moisturized! It has improved the look of the fine lines around my eyes, and it has even cleared up my daughter&#x27;s eczema! I would recommend this to anyone with dry skin or hair!</li>
    <li> I have only been using this oil for two days and can already see an improvement in my skin. I rub the oil, for the recommended minute, all over my face and neck and put a few drops in my BB cream. The dry patches that I get from using acne medication have softened and peeled off.&lt;br /&gt;The first time I used it in my hair I rubbed the oil into my scalp after washing. I did use a little too much and ended up making my hair look very greasy, needless to say a little goes along way. The next day I washed my hair out and it looked better than ever since I conditioned it with an &amp;#34;oil mask&amp;#34; the night before.</li>
    <li> I loved using the argon oil during my pregnancy. I used it every night and I have 3 days until I am induced and not a stretch mark! It&#x27;s also great for my face and neck/chest area.</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B004Z209HS Pura D&#x27;or Pure &amp; Organic Argan Oil 4 fl. oz.]] is an incredible value. The quality is outstanding and part of the reason I like Pura so much is that it is truly non-greasy and absorbs quickly. I have made a pact with myself to stay away from anything that is non-organic and Pure D&#x27;or meets that criteria easily. I use it both for my skin and hair for hydration and I have not found another product that moisturized so well WITHOUT leaving the greasy (or worse, sticky!!!) residue. The 4 ounce bottle lasts far longer than I expected too. Highly recommended if you want nice skin without feeling like a thin layer of something is on you.</li>
    <li> Love this oil! Use it all the time, on everything head to toe. I&#x27;ve even dropped it in a capsule with some essential oils and coconut oil. Hair feels stronger and skin feels great!</li>
    <li> I ordered this product a few weeks ago. I am using it now and I am so glad that I found this Pura d&#x27;or 100% pure and USDA certified organic oil. I used to purchased a expensive aragn oil all the time because I heard it must be USDA certified argan oil is a only real one. So I had to spend so much money on it because I am using the oil in my nightly skin care routin after retinol cream.&lt;br /&gt;I will order my argan oil from now on through online here since it is the same quality as other expensive brands at department store or sephora. I really appreciate for this product again and want to get it soon!!!</li>
    <li> This is the lightest weight argan oil I have tried, and virtually odorless- which is a huge plus! I use it on my face at night, and on my hair before styling, and anytime I need some extra shine. Time will tell if my blemish-prone face will improve with this brand, but so far so good!</li>
    <li> I love this oil! I use it head to toes. When needed, I use as a base for essential oils for whatever ails my skin or hair.</li>
    <li> I cannot believe I have been living without this product for this long. Recently, I have been trying to use only organic, natural products. After doing some research, I discovered argan oil. I intended on using it for my hair, but have been using it as my body and face lotion. I have been using it for a week now, and have seen wonderful results already. For anyone who is on the fence about using an oil on your skin...do it!!</li>
    <li> Ordered this product few weeks ago and really loved the magic it does. I apply it everyday as a moisturizer before going to bed and I feel the soft and smooth skin every morning. I apply it to my scalp and after washing my hair....I feel that my hair has a shiny look and hair fall has reduced. This is an amazing product and I will continue using this for long term results.</li>
    <li> Argan oil has many positive reviews it and I finally decided to try it.  Product came fast and seems good.  I don&#x27;t need a lot to apply it and have tried it on both my skin (I have eczema) and hair.  Thankfully it&#x27;s not too greasy, as I was afraid of since it is an oil.  Thanks a lot.  If it continues to be good I will definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> excellent product....great price....well packaged and arrived in fast time.  I&#x27;ll be back to repurchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you for your service.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Marion Stevens</li>
    <li> I bought this for my wife and child mainly for my wwife&#x27;s hair and for my child&#x27;s skin. We are mainly going to use it as a natural oil to massage our son due to him being a special needs baby and it is a part of his therapy.  So farit really nice on the skin and my wife has nnoticed her hair already is starting to feel better. We will definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> Really liked the texture and looks like premium quality oil.</li>
    <li> I have extremely thick/coarse hair that is wavy that lacks luster and gets split ends easily.  I used this product as a hair mask and after one time of using it I saw a dramatic difference in the texture of my hair. It&#x27;s like I have a new head of hair that is now soft and shiny. After washing the argan oil from my hair, I let my hair air dry and what use to dry crazy and frizzy, dried with a soft supple wave. I have since then flat ironed my hair straight and it is still gorgeous to look at and touch. I put a drop of the oil in the palm of my hand and added it to my ends and then ran my fingers through my hair and it tamed my fly aways without making my hair look greasy.</li>
    <li> I have used Josie Maran&#x27;s Argan Oil for years and was looking for a more cost effective alternative.  Pura d&#x27;or Argan Oil is the same quality as the JM product!  No fragrance, same consistency and color and absorbs into skin well.  I am very picky about what I use on my skin and I highly recommend this product!!</li>
    <li> I have been using for last five months.  I switched brand occasionally, but always wanted to come back to this product.  I use it for my hair mainly after shower before blow dryer, leaving my hair silky smooth without getting oily.  This is the best argan oil out there.  I will continue to use this product.</li>
    <li> This product is great! I originally bought it to make a face cream but I love using on my hair too! Never leaves an oily residue!!</li>
    <li> I was extremely happy when I saw on the bottle the USDA organic symbol and the cruelty free symbol. That off the bat gets 5 stars but the other reason this gets such high praises is because it really worked wonders for me. I would use this after the shower on my hair and on my body as a lotion substitute. Not only did it mend my tresses but it made my skin sooooooo soft and it even gave me a slight glow. My only regret was buying only one bottle because this was perfect for my sensitive skin. Will order more and I will highly recommend this product to anyone searching for good Argan Oil that it certified organic and cruelty free!!</li>
    <li> I have crazy sensitive skin that breaks out and gets dry at the drop of a hat. Adding this to my moisturizing routine twice daily has made a huge difference in the brutal NYC winter - and no noticeable increase in breakouts.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing! I use this oil on my face in stead of face lotion and it leaves my skin under my eyes soft and my eye lashes moisturized. This oil is also great at keeping my ends moisturized and stop them from splitting. I have been looking for a pure oil that is affordable and finally found this amazing product. Buy this instead of impure oils, it really makes a difference.</li>
    <li> The bottle is very convenient to use. It doesn&#x27;t smell at all, which I love. The bottle seems small so if you have long hair it may run out faster. I have thin and fragile hair and this product will help to strengthen it :)</li>
    <li> I love that this is organic and it is so multifunctional. You can use it for so many different things, skin, face cream, hair. I most often use it to control my stray hairs that sometimes have a mind of their own. It calms, soothes and softens. Use with caution though, a little goes a very long way. Too much of a good thing can be, too much. Overall a great quality product.</li>
    <li> I have had hair loss due to mold poisoning about 5 years ago. I have finally found the determination to try and get my hair growing back. I ordered some Argan Oil from Amazon, and I have been using it for about 8 days. I swear, I can feel my hair thickening. I use Argan Oil on my lashes, nails, and skin. My lashes are getting thicker, my nails are harder, and I get compliments on my skin. I will never go with out keeping Argan Oil in my life. It really works, I feel very blessed to have found out about something so great and to have Argan Oil in my life.</li>
    <li> This is a great product my face feels so smooth and my skin is shining</li>
    <li> This is the best moisturizer on the market, it&#x27;s pure, organic, and can be used on any part of the body for excellent results!  Love it.</li>
    <li> the reason why I got in this product was because I had dyed my hair after I had my baby my husband said was to red so I  bought a hair removal and it burned my scalp and my hair and I was so upset...so I start looking and in the meantime I was using baby oil it had very oily feel and didn&#x27;t really do much..and then I found this product as soon as I got it I put it to the test I put it on my scalp, my hair, around my eyes, anywhere it was dry and then I went to bed when I woke up the dry skin around my eye was gone my hair feels a lot smoother so i can finally brush through it without taking a big chunk out, so that made me very happy...so yes I will definitely use it again I&#x27;m very happy with it and I do recommend it for anyone that had the problem I did.  :)  yay it&#x27;s my husbands turn</li>
    <li> I love this product...I use it every morning and evening and my skin is so soft and smooth.  Unbelievable.</li>
    <li> Very dissatisfied. Watery consistency makes me feel like I got a watered down product, it squirts out of the bottle like a spray rather than a serum, it doesn&#x27;t have a great smell like most Argan oils I&#x27;ve tried. I had high hopes, this is not the one, trust me I am a quality hair products junkie, this is not a hit but a bad bad miss.</li>
    <li> I have been using it topical in my face.&lt;br /&gt;the bottle is very easy to use and kept sterile..&lt;br /&gt;it seems it is a real pure organ oil.&lt;br /&gt;I will recommend to try it.</li>
    <li> Really like this product. Feels great and nourishing on my skin. After two weeks my skin is so clear and soft. I have been using this with a vitamin C serum. I love that this product is Organic and natural. All the chemical filled expensive creams dermatologists prescribe is horrible. Let&#x27;s get back to our roots. Fast and timely shipping.</li>
    <li> Love this product.  Didn&#x27;t want to use a hair gel full of chemicals. .... this works really well and is organic.  Gives hair a nice look and feel. I also apply this to my face and body when areas feel dry. Very kind smell ...... great product</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used countless products for my face and hair. My first time using this about 10 minutes ago has been fantastic. My hair is much sleeker but not too shiny, and my skin is moisturized without feeling greasy. A little really does go a long way. I will update this is a month to hopefully see how much my face clears up. So far so good!</li>
    <li> I had used much more expensive Argan oil and really loved it but not the PRICE.  So when I saw this product and the price I thoughtIi would give it a try. After using it, I honestly cannot tell the difference in this and the more expensive brand. Will order again!!</li>
    <li> Such a wonderful product! I got this as a gift for Christmas and I&#x27;ve really enjoyed using it. During the winter, I usually find my hair looking dry and dead while my skin (particularly my face) looking a little dry. After trying it out on my hair, I found that my hair was a lot more soft and shiny. It just looked a lot more healthy overall. Next I tried it on my face. I was a little hesitant because I thought it&#x27;d be way too oily, but it absorbed very nicely and left my skin feeling extremely soft. Would definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> I loooooove this oil! I used a bottle of Josie Maran&#x27;s argan oil and found the cheaper alternative on Amazon. The only difference I saw was that Josie Maran&#x27;s oil was thicker in consistency, but Pura d&#x27;or was equally moisturizing and left my skin supple. I am so glad I found this!</li>
    <li> I used to have alot of breakage anf I tried everything but nothing seemed to help. I always wanted to try argan oil but it always seemed to expensive. When I saw this product on amazon I decided to try it and the results have been amazing. The best part about this product is that it doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy residue. I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I definitely like this argan oil.  I went through a bottle of a more expensive popular brand, and decided to try this kind, to save a little money.  I feel it hydrates just as well as the other kind, plus it&#x27;s a better deal!  I use it on my face as a moisturizer, skim a little over my hair to knock down the frizzies, and add a few pumps to my body lotion.</li>
    <li> Wear it every day/night/afternoon/tea time... whatever. This stuff works. I have dry skin. Makes no difference what kind of skin you have. It&#x27;s light weight, absorbs quickly, and feels wonderful. TAKE IT TO BURNING MAN. This should be on the must pack list. People out west... your patchy skin needs this!</li>
    <li> I use this in my hair. It keeps it more manageable while I&#x27;m going through the mid phases of growing out my hair.</li>
    <li> I have been using the Pura d&#x27;or argan oil for over a week now and am very happy with the product. It doesn&#x27;t leave my skin as oily as I thought like other creams do. I also use this on my neck, chest, nails and a couple of drops in my hair. Great product!</li>
    <li> Love this argan oil! We bought another one for the in law.</li>
    <li> I like this product it as it is almost with no fragrance ... and according to me it is one of  best non stickey oil in market  which not only prevents hair fall but also enriches your skin with moisture and makes your skin ever young.</li>
    <li> I love argan oil to start with. After years of battling cystic acne and skin that was blotchy, and oily, and sensitive, and just not appreciative of all the money I spent on it ... I discovered argan oil. I was skeptical to say the least but I hung in there. After six months or so I started to see improvement: the &#x27;mothers&#x27; (cysts under the skin of my chin which gave me a lovely &#x27;wicked witch of the west&#x27; profile) became smaller and vanished, leaving blueish purple scars behind. My skin texture improved: from bumpy to smooth like a baby&#x27;s behind (sans diaper rash, of course). My face started to look dewy not sweaty or oily (still using a primer though) and I became hopeful. It is a year later and I am noticing that the mothers scars are fading and I use less and less concealer on my chin. I really appreciate the dispenser on this bottle: it gives me a consistent amount of argan oil to massage into my still a bit damp skin so I never use too much (which can be .. well, too much). One pump for my face, another for my neck and still another for my décolleté. Done. Woot!</li>
    <li> Great for face (with repeated use). Made my skin so soft and light to the touch. Kept it hydrated in extremely cold temperatures. Didn&#x27;t notice much difference when used on hair &amp; hands.</li>
    <li> Good for skin/face, not so much for hair. On hair, even when used sparingly, it leaves it feeling kind of greasy. I dig that it&#x27;s all natural, but for hair I will go with the argan oil that contains some silicone. The silicone additive makes the argan oil work better as a hair care product, in both the application and the results. It&#x27;s not as if you&#x27;re gonna be drinking the stuff, so some added silicone is not any issue, and shouldn&#x27;t be if what you&#x27;re looking for is a product that works to help soften and control thick, dry, unruly hair. Plus, this stuff doesn&#x27;t smell nearly as good as the other Moroccan Oil hair treatments. This stuff is good out of the shower on damp skin - other than that, not impressed. if you require 100% oil, then I suppose this is ok. But if you also want results from an argan oil hair treatment, then look elsewhere.</li>
    <li> I really like this product</li>
    <li> I love this Argan oil my face look so smooth even though it&#x27;s just my second day using it I make sure I will buy again!!!</li>
    <li> I wanted to get off my acne medication cold turkey and just use coconut oil.  It was so greasy!  I just got this and my skin soaks it right up!  Hoping this will be easier in my pores!</li>
    <li> This is my 4th bottle of your oil and I love It. It&#x27;s a great product and the price is Right. Buy it you will love it. Pat H</li>
    <li> This is a really good product. After using this the dryness of the scalp &amp; hair loss was almost gone.</li>
    <li> When used with the shampoo and conditioner, this product restored my long lost curl pattern. This product is amazing in providing moisture to my hair. Will definitely buy it again!!</li>
    <li> So far I like the oil. I&#x27;ve used it in my hair and it tamed my frizz. And, it feels great on my skin after a shower.</li>
    <li> I bought this product to keep down the frizzes with my hair.  I was surprised to read all of the review of people who use it on their skin and I didn&#x27;t really think I&#x27;d try that.  Well, needless to say, I gave it a whirl and I LOVE this stuff on my hair AND my skin.  For my hair, I was really amazed at how great my naturally wavy/curly hair looked without anything else in in and air dried.  My hair has always just been straggly and frizzy unless I either defused and scrunched it or straightened it; air drying my hair was never an option.  Now, I feel confident walking out the door with a head of wet hair and arriving at work in my professional position with my hair looking fantastic as it dries.  This is SUCH a time saver.  Of course I still defuse it or straighten it when I feel like it and the Argan Oil really does all that it claims to do.  A note of caution, play with the amount to see what works best for you.  My hair is just below my collar bone and neither thin nor thick, 2 pumps is about right for me.  If I put more than that in then my hair looks wet even when it dries and can look greasy.  2 pumps and my hair just looks like beautiful healthy hair.  I&#x27;ve also been using this on my son&#x27;s hair since the product he was using always made my face break out when he&#x27;d cuddle, this is great because it&#x27;s good for your skin so if his product is up against my face I don&#x27;t break out.  I also add a pump or two to my normal hair care products when I use them, but I don&#x27;t really need to use anything else.  Now, for my skin.  I have combo skin with an oily T zone and this stuff didn&#x27;t make me break out or get oily.  Again, you have to play with it to get the right amount.  I was using 3 pumps morning and night but that was too much.  One to two pumps is perfect.  I like to rub it in gently, but for more time than my normal stuff so that the oils warm up and really get absorbed.  I also add this to my normal day and night lotions when I use them.  Make sure your face is dry before you use it because oil and water don&#x27;t mix.  I&#x27;ve found that if my face is still wet when I put it on then it does make me break out but if I wait a minute or two after towel drying my face, I know my skin will look glorious.  I&#x27;m sure there are a lot of other uses but my face and hair are all I need it for.  I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;ll like it.  I actually see people with frizzy hair when I&#x27;m out and about and wish I could just go up to them and suggest this stuff.  I&#x27;ve been SO tempted because I know they&#x27;ll love it and it would really help their hair look healthy and beautiful rather than dry and fuzzy.  My hair was pretty healthy to start with.  I bought it strictly for the fly-aways I was getting when I straightened it after a new hair cut and just fell in love from there.y before you use it because oil and water don&#x27;t mix.

    <li> I bought this organic Argan oil at the beginning of this month (January) as part of my new years resolution to get better skin and hair. I squirt this on my hair before bed every night and I rub about a dime sized amount in my face every morning. The results on my skin are amazing! I suffer from severe acne scarring and in just one week this Argan oil faded my dark acne spots considerably!!! Also, I have seen an improvement in my hair as this product adds softness and shine. I will definitely be buying this again!</li>
    <li> Product surpasses quality expectation! Thrilled with this purchase. Will definitely buy again!!!</li>
    <li> I really love Argan Oil but I am trying to buy products with no chemical additives.  So this company (Pura d&#x27;or) is a good find.  I mixed it with Pure organic Shea Butter and virgin organic coconot oil and frankincense.  Makes a great body butter.</li>
    <li> This is the cure to my very dry hair. I&#x27;ve used all sorts of argan oil brands. Most of which seem like they only give my hair a shiny look. With this one, I know immediately that the argan oil worked its way in. The first day I used it, my hair felt ten times softer and it didn&#x27;t give that shiny greasy look. I love it! I put some on my hair before drying it and a little more after. I&#x27;ve been using it for several months now. My hair hasn&#x27;t been frizzy eversince. Plus, I don&#x27;t get a lot of split ends anymore!</li>
    <li> Bought this product based on the recommendation. Worth it. I use it on my face and hair and it really does a very good job. I was reluctant to use this product since i have an oily skin but after one use i could see the difference on my face. Love it. Would continue purchasing this product for lifetime.</li>
    <li> This argan oil is great and absorbs in to your skin instead of just laying on top and leaving greasy feeling.  I have an illness that causes severe dryness.  This oil will always be on my dresser. Love it!</li>
    <li> I love this oil. I have been dealing with cancer and have both very dry skin and hair loss.  This oil has been very good for my skin.  I put it on first thing in the morning and by the time I do my makeup it has absorbed in and does not feel oily.  I used it on my hair as well. I though it would make my hair oily but it doesn&#x27;t, it absorbs right in.  I have added a few drops of essential oils too and its great for that as well.</li>
    <li> I have been using Pura d&#x27;or Argan oil on my face for about 2 years. I have been using a retin a product for about 15 years with success. I continue to use the retin a product but when I wash my face in the morning and evening, I use about 2 drops of argan oil and then about 20 minutes later, I use a moisturizer in the morning and retin a at night. I think since I have added the argan oil, the fine lines on my face and around my eyes have either disappeared or been reduced. I am 66 years old and look at women my age who have many, many more wrinkles than I have.</li>
    <li> I am in my early 60&#x27;s and have found Pura d&#x27;or Argan Oil for Body, Hair and Face Treatment a great treat.  With age we get dry and crepe paper areas in our body.  My skin looks and feels amazing with this daily treatment.  I feel more youthful and thrilled that I found this product.  Thank you.  Deborah Totman  Tampa, FL ****</li>
    <li> This product leaves your skin feeling smooth and soft I&#x27;ve notice my laugh line are much softer looking. I would buy this again.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product on my hair and on my face for about 5 months. It is smazing what it does for my facial skin! I put it on before I put on my moisturizer and keeps my skin well hydrated and smooth! Not greasy at all!  I even notice pores getting smaller! the only regret is not knowing about this product earlier!!!!!</li>
    <li> Just received my Pura d&#x27;or Argan oil and must say I love it. I was ordering 1 fl. oz bottles from another vendor and found this 4 oz size to be much more convenient. And I REALLY like the pump dispenser...not a spray really, but rather a spritz that stays in one spot and doesn&#x27;t spray all over the place and waste the oil. The product arrived nicely packaged, bubble wrapped and in a nice little cotton pouch. The oil itself is awesome. So great as a moisturizer and carrier oil! Silky smooth and light...not heavy at all with no noticeable smell at all to me.</li>
    <li> I use so many products on my face that is hard to say what it is doing, besides don&#x27;t use it every day, but is good moisturizer, use it on my hair also and the price is very good, I will keep trying it.</li>
    <li> I bought Pura d&#x27;or 100% Organic Argan Oil as a replacement for another brand.  My decision to buy this brand was due to the price, The USDA guarantee, and the reviews that I read before I purchase any new brand.  I use this product in my hair, on my skin, and am starting to use it for cuticle treatments today.  I am very satisfied with my purchase, and will buy Pura d&#x27;or again.</li>
    <li> Excellent product, improved my skin and made my hair softer. Would recommend highly.</li>
    <li> Sooo much cheaper than Moroccan Oil! Works great for my skin and hair. Glad to have found this.</li>
    <li> Appears to be of the highest quality argan oil. Absorbs and moisturizes well. I would by this again and again.</li>
    <li> Love this oil.  I use it on my face and hair.  It makes my face appear much more moist and gives my hair a great shine.  It is a great base oil before using sun screen.  Recommend it highly</li>
    <li> great product and service!</li>
    <li> Nothing special. It smelled weird and old. I returned it.</li>
    <li> Wonderful, cleared up all my acne and made my face super soft. LOVE IT!!!!!</li>
    <li> After just one week, I started noticing a reduction in bags under my eyes. The oil is too much for me to use during the day when I&#x27;m going to work, but I&#x27;ve been using it as an eye makeup remover and layering it under my eyes at night and have noticed significant results. Under eye puffiness and dark circles are almost gone and bags significantly reduced. I feel like I look 5 years younger. Have also started working argon oil into other problem dry areas like cuticles and winter-dry hair. Since you only use a small amount I do not think the cost is too high. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> been using this for a few months and it really helped the dryness on my skin. This beats any type of lotion or any of that aloe vera crap. This is the real deal and is very concentrated. Should last you a month with daily use.</li>
    <li> Originally bought this product for my hair, cant use it there at all! it is so potent and sticky, oily! so now i pump a few drops into other products to use on my body.. in face creams, lotions and to another hair moisturizer product!&lt;br /&gt;works well for those purposes! its a great product!</li>
    <li> I have been using this with my Shea Moisture shampoo, conditioner and coconut oil for a few months exclusively on my hair and I love the results. I don&#x27;t have to wash my hair often (once every 4-6 days), my hair is not oily at all, it&#x27;s softer and easier to manage, less frizzy, and less &amp;#34;lion mane like&amp;#34;. I have very thick Asian and &amp;#34;lose&amp;#34; hair, this seems to do the trick to calm it. I only use about two pump when my hair is very long, think middle of back long, and one pump when I cut it a little longer than shoulder length. Too much and your hair will look greasy. Also don&#x27;t use it on the scalp or top of head that much, else it will look greasy too.</li>
    <li> I use this product for my hair and face. It makes the hair feel very smooth and healthy. I&#x27;m not sure how much it prevents hair loss, however. But in terms of cosmetics, this product is top notch. I use it for my face too and it makes the skin shine. I have noticed, as others have commented, tha the argan oil will also heal my wounds faster and better. That is a definite plus.</li>
    <li> I enjoy this product very much.  It is moisturizing for both my hair and my skin.  It doesn&#x27;t have quite the rich smell I was hoping for, but otherwise, the quality seems very good.  This is my first experience with any kind of argan oil.  I plan to purchase pura d&#x27;or again.</li>
    <li> Added this stuff to my shampoo and o man!!!!!!! I will be buying this everytime I get a new bottle of shampoo from now on.</li>
    <li> Pura d&#x27;or Argan oil has literally changed my skin.  I have had dry, parched skin for several years and it didn&#x27;t respond to any moisturizers until I tried this product.  I love the fact that it&#x27;s pure, organic, and cold pressed with nothing else added.  Also it&#x27;s reasonably priced.  I don&#x27;t know why anyone would pay such  outrageous prices for products that simply do not work and are loaded with chemicals when Pura d&#x27;or does the job so well.  Oh, and let me just say that the wrinkles are diminished, as well.  Great product!</li>
    <li> This has great reviews even outside of Amazon which I why I tried it. It had only been 2 weeks and my face no longer has any dryness to it even in the midst of winter.</li>
    <li> I have been ordering this product for some time now and am completely satisfied. I always make sure I have 2 extra bottles so I never run out. It makes my skin feel very moist and soft and helps my hair from feeling dry. I would HIGHLY recommend this product!</li>
    <li> Love, Love, Love this product.</li>
    <li> Great for skin and hair. A little goes a long way!</li>
    <li> This oil is amazing! I am currently in the process of growing my hair back and this product provides the right amount of moisture that I need for my hair. My hair is soft and manageable after washing and applying this oil. I have natural hair and this oil means a lot to me. I also use it as a moisturizer for my face at night. I am in love!</li>
    <li> Amazing hair oil. My hair shines like silky gold and has never been healthier. I haven&#x27;t had a hair cut in over four months and I don&#x27;t have a single split end since I began using Pura d&#x27;or argan oil.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t tried this oil before so I can&#x27;t compare brands but I really love it.  I have straight, fine, lifeless hair with no body.  It gave me body!  Just dabbed a bit in my hands and ran it through my hair and I had body. Very exciting.  I also like the way it feels on my skin.  Put it on my hands and arms and face and it just feels smooth, not oily.  I do have dry skin though so don&#x27;t know how it would work on oily or combo skin.  If it continues to work this way on me, I will be a regular user.  Like that it is organic too since I try to do as much organic as possible these days.</li>
    <li> TOO OILY FOR MY HAIR. BUT I USED IT ON MY BODY</li>
    <li> I love this product.. it has made my hair and my daughter&#x27;s eczema super soft and manageable..</li>
    <li> Have been using this product for a couple of months now. This has not completely erased the fine lines, but they have become lighter. My facial skin is much smoother and blemish free. Will continue to use this product</li>
    <li> Pura d&#x27;or is fabulous. I have used argon oil for years on my skin and Pura d&#x27;or is noticeably some of the best I have tried. Its a good product and I will be using it again.</li>
    <li> Keeps my dry cheeks subtle and soft. Great for sunburn around the back of my neck.</li>
    <li> I love this product, especially in this cold and dry season. It really give me a relief in my dry itching skin. I&#x27;ve been suffered several days due to the terribly cold weather outside. It makes my body cold rashes and my face itching. But after using this oil mix with body cream, I didn&#x27;t feel any itching and even my face get glow. I love this oil and I&#x27;ll try to use on my hair too.</li>
    <li> I tried this argan oil and it really makes skin smoother as well as it helps to remove spots in skin. Try this out for your skin problems.</li>
    <li> This is a great product. Traditional lotions &amp; hair conditioners make me itch very badly. I use this directly on my skin and hair after a shower and it is fantastic. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Lives up to the 5-Star rating.</li>
    <li> Very pleased with Organ Oil. it has a wonderful feel and you can really notice a difference. My face skin seems become soft and sooth. I will continue to use it for my skin.</li>
    <li> i&#x27;ve used this for a long time and am very happy with it.</li>
    <li> I bought this for homemade beard oil. After a week of using it there is definitely a difference. Not only with my beard but also with my skin and complexion. My beard is softer and not as weathered from the cold and my skin is softer and clearer.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing and one of the best beauty products I&#x27;ve ever tried!  I use it mostly on my face and neck but it&#x27;s so versatile and you can use it all over your body.  I&#x27;ve noticed my skin becomes super soft and smooth whenever I use Pura d&#x27;or argan oil.  I love that it really is pure argan oil and certified organic.  I will continue using this product for many years to come!  Am totally hooked!!!</li>
    <li> This product is fantastic! Having dry skin I tried different products but I found this one to be the most effective. I am using it on daily basis and I highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> I really like this Argan oil. I do not smell any weird odor like some people have posted. It is very smooth and has a pale color. I use it with jojoba oil for cleansing my face. I would recommend this product. The quality seems to be excellent.</li>
    <li> This is ia great product and I strongly recommend it to anyone who wants a healthier hair and need help with hair loss. I use it with the Pura d&#x27;or shampoo and conditioner and it works great! I will definitely continue to use this product.</li>
    <li> I use this every night on my face as a moisturize, it works wonders. I sometime put in on my hair when it&#x27;s very dry.</li>
    <li> I received this as a Christmas present and have been using it ever since. I have psoriasis in my scalp and the oil has relieved the itching and keeping it under control.</li>
    <li> Love this for my hair during the winter when I don&#x27;t want to use coconut oil since it gets crunchy with the cooler weather. But this is fab for my hair and my face and it is noncomedogenic!</li>
    <li> Update: It worked nicely for my hair. However, after using it for a few weeks I realized I developed a terrible allergy. I&#x27;ve used argan oil before without problems. But this time I was getting hives all over my body if I leave it in my hair overnight. It took me a while to realize that argan oil was the culprit. Now I can&#x27;t even use shampoo or conditioner that contains argan oil... Guess I&#x27;ll search for an alternative. So far jojoba oil worked fine.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for about one month.  A little goes a long way.  2 pumps I use to moisturizer my face, eyes, lips and hands.  At night I may add a bit more because at the end I just rub my hands on the ends of my hair.  Just be careful to test how much maybe over the weekend so you know how much for your hair type.  I have normally thin hair...not too dry or oily, shoulder length and use 1 pump for hair....start at ends.  I have noticed my face and eyes look more refreshed.  And it has been easier for me to wear no makeup just a quick blush and gloss and I look refreshed.  I am a healthy  45 year old and just get a hint of circles under my eyes. Since using this product I have noticed positive results on wrinkles and under eye darkness.  Would highly recommend.  I am picky with using organic natural products and have tried many, this has many uses, lasts, and a great price.  Oh side note...my face seems moisturized all day.  Not that greasy or heavy feel.</li>
    <li> Great product, fast shipping service with reliable packaging, very satisfied with both. . Have heard many good things about argan oil, though remained skeptical, however due to all the great reviews thought its worth a try. Glad I found the product on amazon, pure and organic. Have used it a few times already on my hair, which is frizzy and dry, especially in the winter time, with split ends.  Noticed difference after a few uses, with hair more manageable, silkier. Planning to try it on my face as well, as it is supposed to be non- comedogenic. So far very pleased. Four stars, as I have not experienced all of its alleged great properties.</li>
    <li> Returned Josie Maran argan oil for this product. Works even better and you get more than double the amount for more than half the cost. My skin feels smoother with this oil and I know that it is natural and and free of any additives. I am so happy I found this product and it will continue to be a staple for my skin regimen!</li>
    <li> Yes after reading all the reviews and a lot of them saying that the company gave out free bottles for them to place review and a few of them said it made their hair oily sticky. Well I thought the product and the reviews were right it was oily and sticky very disappointed because we do look at Amazon reviews and when we see thousands of people given it for five stars were going to believe it and try it. No more. I&#x27;ll have to really be more careful when I look at the reviews in deciding even if I want to buy this product disappointed.</li>
    <li> This feels a little thicker and stickier than other argan oil I&#x27;ve used, but it smells pure and good and moisturizes my skin and hair well.</li>
    <li> I am using this oil for last 1 month and I must say it&#x27;s working amazing on my hair. It didn&#x27;t make my hair straight but it definitely reduced the frizziness and added softness to my hair. I will recommend this oil to those who have frizzy n rough hair!!</li>
    <li> I researched for an argan oil that was not overly priced but it had to be pure, and with the USDA stamp it was enough for me to buy it. I love this oil and use it daily on my neck, elbows, knees and any dry spots. It has a pump and it metered to the few drops that are recommended. I have prime and love that I can get it in 2 days!!</li>
    <li> The item arrived quickly. It was exceptionally well securely packaged. It was exactly what I expected it to be. I am happy with my purchase. Will buy again from the same seller and recommend to everyone else.</li>
    <li> This stuff works great! I use this as a conditioner everyday and it keeps hair hydrated much better than any regular conditioner.</li>
    <li> I use this on my face and hair. Its the quickest absorbing oil I&#x27;ve tried so far. It never feels heavy or greasy. I really like the bottle it comes in. It administers the perfect amount, always zero-mess. It has a very slight and particular fragrance. I can&#x27;t quite describe it, except that it reminds me of the way olive oil has a slightly spicy, green, and nutty scent that only comes when you put your nose to it. I like the way it smells--either way, its not very strong. Size and price make this a great deal. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for about a week now and have been loving it. It leaves my skin dewy and healthy looking while not making it look oily. Great for dry skin looking to hydrate during the warmer months!</li>
    <li> I really like the way this oil feels, using all the time on my nails and under my eyes. I will definitely order this product again.</li>
    <li> Great Product!!! I have used other brands that cost alot more. With this product I get quality and less cost.</li>
    <li> nice product, make&#x27;s your skin smell so nice, and it does moisturize your body, will buy this again when needed.</li>
    <li> I use it everyday morning with lotion, my skin is not dry any more.</li>
    <li> Best oil so far for sensitive skin. Would surely recommend it. It brightens my face with 20 min of applying. I bought another bottle.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m really happy with this oil. I use it on my face, neck, sometimes hands and hair. It is very moisturizing. It has definitely softened some beginning crows feet I had noticed. I know it has a lot of vitamin E; I noticed blemishes seem to heal a little faster.  I definitely recommend it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for almost a week now and it has made my hair so shiny and soft! I love that it is organic.  I also used at night as a moisturizer and has helped my dry chapped skin. It felt a little greasy at first but my skin soaked it up quickly. I plan to use this for my nails too.</li>
    <li> This is my second purchase of this brand of Argan oil.  In between I purchased a different, organic brand at a well-known supermarket.  It was thick and had a strange smell.  I regretted it immediately.  Pura d&#x27;or is top quality and it will be my only choice from now on.  I love the packaging as well, and the price is very reasonable.</li>
    <li> I really love this oil!  I apply one to two pumps on my hair, and I also use this every night around my eyes.  What I love the most about this oil is that it does not leave any residue on your skin...my skin just absorbs it.  So I will certainly be purchasing this again!</li>
    <li> Oh my! I love this oil so much! Only use pea size, my hair (not vey long) doesn&#x27;t go like explosion any more! do not use more amount though, or the hair looks greasy.</li>
    <li> i love argan oil!  I ordered many times and have always received my order in good shape and one time.</li>
    <li> i have used pura d&#x27;or argan oil for about a year.  i typically have dry skin during the winter months, and i learned about this product on the internet.  i have used other argan products before.  however, pura d&#x27;or is definitely a highter quality in the thickness of the oil as opposed to thinned out products that i have used. the oil smooths nicely on the skin, and after it is absorbed, leaves the skin hydrated and not greasy.  i often used a moisturizer over top of this product to give another level of hydration and protection.&lt;br /&gt;  i am 52 and as a man, i have no qualms about using face products to keep my youth.  i have a good diet, exercise regularly and stay out of the sun as well as use suncreen.  Pura d&#x27;or oil is a perfect compliment to my health regiment.  i have used olive oil in the past but this oil absorbs better and is not greasy.  in addition, the dark glass bottle protects the oil from light, and the convenient pump enables the oil to be applied efficiently.  highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I had previously purchased the expensive face oils.  I decided to buy this for  the purpose of using it as a face oil.  It functions as a primer before applying makeup and makes your skin appear more flawless.  It works.....and, at this price!!  I am very happy with this product!</li>
    <li> Ingredient listed is ONLY pure organic argania spinosa kernal (argan) oil, other brands have fillers. This product absorbs quickly and does not feel or look oily. Feels and looks pleasantly moisturized - quickly gets rid of tired/ dull/ dry looking skin. Definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> Product delivery was very satisfactory... quick, nice packaging. As for the product itself, it was my daughter who swore by it. My daughter loves natural products, and I commented on how she doesn&#x27;t have breakouts anymore, and how her skin was clean, fresh, and glowing. She said she just puts on Pura d&#x27;Or Argan Oil on her face after each shower. I&#x27;m pretty lazy when it comes to skin care, and having this argan-oil-after-shower sounded easy enough for me... Well, I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s psychological, because I do see pictures... my skin has felt supple and looked younger looking ever since ;-) I&#x27;ve asked my husband to do the same easy ritual ... After all, I don&#x27;t want him looking like my &amp;#34;father&amp;#34; in a few years :-P</li>
    <li> Super fabulous product!!</li>
    <li> Great product to use as a skin moisturizer.</li>
    <li> I love this product, I use it on my neck and hair and it is excellent--especially on the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I plan to keep this product along with my other essentials...</li>
    <li> can use this oil for skin or hair.  love it.</li>
    <li> I used one bottle.. so far so good. Need to order one more.</li>
    <li> My face has no idea this is not Josie Maran. Great value. Works just like the expensive stuff. I use two drops for my face and also on hair and dry skin.</li>
    <li> wow this is an awesome. Pure Argan essential oil on used usually will heal any kind of existent acne blemishes, at the same time stopping the occasion on new breakouts. But, this oil is not recommended simply for hide use, pure Argan essential oil is the answer for anybody of you that are looking for one chemical.</li>
    <li> Awesome oil...very satisfied from it. It fixed all of my sister problems so she doesn&#x27;t have any problems now i use it myself sometimes too and i can say its working very well.If you got doubts i can say don&#x27;t lose time go on buy it now!!Great product &lt;3 5 stars.</li>
    <li> Product arrived quickly and well packaged (no oil had leaked).  Very happy with the quality of the oil and the great price.</li>
    <li> I love this product it doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy feel, i use a few drops with my reg. moisturizer every morning.  It smells very nice and I plan on purchasing more of this product to use on my 89 yr old father&#x27;s dry skin.  Would definitely recommend this my family and friends!!  Thank you for a great product.</li>
    <li> Amazing product , makes my hair and skin so soft ! Love it , definitely will purchase again</li>
    <li> I definitely like this product! They call it liquid gold for a reason! Its helped my cracked heels beyond anything else and I also use it in my hair for dandruff control. I never knew you could use it like that! It comes with a booklet of a bunch of ways you can use it all over your body! It does not have a weird smell and its organic and cruelty free! I would definitely recommend trying this product!!</li>
    <li> I hAve try this one , and my hair stop fall , I suffered from hair loss for 2 years but with this oil and shampoo, the loss hair start diminish</li>
    <li> This is the 2nd time I&#x27;ve purchased this product.  I add a few drops of tea tree oil to the bottle and use it as an all-over moisturizer and also to help scars heal.  I have combination skin but can use this on my face, and it actually helps clear the acne.  Love this stuff!</li>
    <li> I have been using for just a few weeks and I do believe it is helping my skin.  The oil is not heavy or thick and goes well&lt;br /&gt;not just on the face but also my shaved head.  I have received compliments on my skin and hope it will help with skin tone.</li>
    <li> I usually don&#x27;t write reviews. I have thin and sort of frizzy hair. Just a tiny bit of this on my damp hair makes my hair smoother and more manageable. I have been using this for a couple weeks now and will definitely buy it again!</li>
    <li> I love this oil for dry skin and everyday facial use.</li>
    <li> Love this product so far. Feels great on my face, not greasy. Helping clear my acne and also helping my brittle nails. Would recommend this product!!</li>
    <li> Totally worth the price. Using it has made my hair soft, wavy and manageable. Definitely buying more bottles.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for nearly a year now and I really do believe it makes a difference.  I am a 50+ year old lady that does all her own yard work and come from a family with less than great genetics, and I worry about my skin a lot.  So far, I have no noticeable wrinkles and my scars from a previous car accident are all fading.  I really do like this product! I just ordered and began using the Vitamin C Serum to use as well and hope it is just as good.  Give this a try!!</li>
    <li> lightweight &amp; fast absorbing, great deal - i buy this in volume.  excellent to use year round &amp; great for guy with eczema</li>
    <li> love the oil.Could feel the difference in skin in one day.It makes it so fresh.</li>
    <li> If I could give it 6 stars I will. I saw this on YouTube when I was looking for suggestions to help with dry hair line. My skin generally looks good until a couple hours into my flight (I&#x27;m a flight attendant) and then the hairline gets so dry and flakey. I used this and I&#x27;m never letting it go. Excellent product. Really solved a problem I have been having for yrs.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using  pura d or Argan Oil for 2 years as a facial moisturizer.  I am 44 and receive compliments on my young complexion often.  This moisturizer is perfect for all skin types, most people think if they have oily skin that they can&#x27;t use an oil moisturizer, they can and it will definitely improve their skin.</li>
    <li> I have been trying to find a cheaper alternative to the oil in the blue box :) for my daughter&#x27;s very high-maintenance, very curly and dry hair.&lt;br /&gt;Not happening- there is no better oil than that oil.  This is ok- a bit thin, not very nourishing, just ok.</li>
    <li> I have been using this oil for the past three months and it is simply wonderful. Completely non greasy, feels very light and all through the winter I did not need to use anything else at all. Usually I have to be careful with what I use on my face as I have an oily skin, however with the Pura d&#x27;or I had no such concern. I used it for myself and my two little girls and they love it too. We use it for our face and hand mostly and sometimes for the hair. The girls love putting this oil on their faces before bed time, its feels so nice and light that you hardly notice 5 minutes later that you have oil on your face! This argan oil is now part of our daily routines! totally love it!</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t put it near your eyes... If it gets near the softer skin around your eyes, they&#x27;re gonna be kind of wet feeling and greasy for the rest of the day. What I think this does is it puts the omega-like fatty acids directly onto your face, just in case you&#x27;re allergic to fish for some reason.</li>
    <li> Makes my skin look young and healthy.  I use aveeno anti aging lotion on top of it, I&#x27;m not a fan of foundation. For me this is better, all natural and organic.</li>
    <li> best product ever bought it for all my girls</li>
    <li> i like this oiil, it&#x27;s clear no scent and it makes your skin soft and your hair soft, just don&#x27;t use too much.</li>
    <li> So last summer I travelled to Morocco and I honestly had no idea what argan oil was or what it was used for. Then I bought some because it kept being sold to me and endorsed by the locals...I had it as a souvenir and after a few days of hiking in the last few weeks of my trip I experienced a terrible allergic reaction. It was horrible. I felt horrible ,my face was swollen and had scarring. So I decided YOLO! I guess ill give this argan oil a shot...1 week later my face was back to new&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;moral of the story Argan has been a staple in my beauty regimen ever since.I have to have it in my life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t been back to Morocco and am close to running out of my oil I purchased while I was there. So I purchased the 4 oz D&#x27;or Argan oil. I must say I am a satisfied customer. I love it and it loves me back.The quality is the same as what I would have bought in the argan cooperative in Morocco and the company packaged everything very well and carefully. My order came very quickly and I recommend this oil highly</li>
    <li> I purchased this because of the price and the fabulous reviews.  However, I find this to be a little too greasy and it doesn&#x27;t absorb into my skin as well as Josie Maran&#x27;s argan oil.  There&#x27;s something about their consistency that it just sits on my skin for a little bit.  After a while, all my clothes started to smell like this argan oil and I can&#x27;t seem to wash it away.  I don&#x27;t think I would purchase it again, and might just take the plunge and buy the Josie Maran argan oil, it seems to work well the only down fall is the price.</li>
    <li> I use this under my eyes to keep away the puffiness and on my slightly-frizzy hair, prior to blow drying.  Works well on both accounts and the service was very fast!</li>
    <li> Wonderful Product!!! My wife just can&#x27;t stop using it!!!</li>
    <li> I have never posted a review for anything before in my life. This oil is like youth in a bottle. I originally purchased this for my hair, but I soon learned that this could also be used for your face. I have only used it twice, but I can see and feel a huge difference in my skin texture and appearance. My skin has a natural glow and feels years younger. At 35, I have battled with adult acne for years, so many products leave my skin quite dry. I am always in search of a good moisturizer - especially in the winter. My face feels smooth and hydrated after using this oil. This is an awesome product for your hair and face! I am in love!!! This is a great value for what you&#x27;re getting. I highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Use it daily on my daughters hair to tame away frizz. It works great, but leaves hair a bit oily looking, so for this purpose I give it a 4.  I do feel like the hair looks more healthy since we started using it.</li>
    <li> I have used other brands of Argan oil. All of which have a very faint almost nutty scent. This brand has an odd perfumy chemical scent to it. It also does not asorb into my skin as well. I put it on my face at bed time  3 nights in a row and every morning woke up with my skin still feeling oily. 4oz for $20 is an amazing deal but remember what your grandma taught you....If it sounds to good to be true.....&lt;br /&gt;I will be returning this product for a refund.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed the benefits others have touted. However, I live in an extremely cold climate and it is almost impossible to stay moisturized.  I have been using it on my face then adding a layer of moisturizer on top of it.</li>
    <li> I use this in my hair, and it makes my hair less dry and gives it a healthy glow without making it greasy or weighing it down. I noticed my hair is a lot more manageable. I would definitely buy again and highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> My girlfriend says &amp;#34;Great hair product! Easy to use and I love the results&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Josie Maran argan oil at least once a day for a few years now, and I must say, this product is easily comparable. It is just as wonderful of a product, if not better, but easier on your wallet. This is unscented, but has a nice, light scent that I really like. I love the way oil makes my skin feel soft and smooth, even after a bitter cold day or a long day outdoors. I must say, while the product itself is great, I really appreciate and admire the company&#x27;s environmentally conscious stand. They don&#x27;t test on animals and they use many earth friendly precticesthat I applaud. I would recommend this product, and the company, a millions times.</li>
    <li> This oil is a really good as described from head to toe, it is absorbed into the skin, none greasy. Great stuff😊</li>
    <li> I got this oil for my wife. The lines around her eyes after two weeks of using this product got smooth and skin looks amazing . I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> This is a product i refuse to ever run out of. Argan oil really is nature&#x27;s gold. I use it on my face after It is washed and before applying makeup. And you don&#x27;t have to use very much. It absorbs quickly and leaves your skin refreshed. Perfect of the delicate skin of the eyes. I use it on the ends of my hair, to protect and to hydrate. It has done wonders for my curly wavy fine hair. I&#x27;ll even use it as a make up remover when i have run out of jojoba oil. But it&#x27;s too precious to use like that. I ran out for about a month and my skin and hair sorely missed it. Never doing that again. I would love to use this all over my body but its just too expensive for all over use. Use it on dry spots. Stop putting chemicals on your skin and get some argan oil.</li>
    <li> This is the main ingredient listed in Moroccan oil but this is better than Moroccan oil.  As you age, your hair gets coarser.  Blow dry your hair and when you&#x27;re almost done put the tiniest amount in your palm and rub it on the ends of your hair staying away from the cap.  It&#x27;s hard to gauge how much to use when you put it on wet hair and every time I do, i end up putting on too much.  It&#x27;s kind of like a poor man&#x27;s keratin treatment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I first saw this on Dr. Oz and he recommended putting a few drops in your cold cream.  After I do my hair and I have the oil on my hands I put a little Vitamin C cream on my hands and it&#x27;s amazing.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff.  I use it on my skin and in my hair.  The quality seems very good.&lt;br /&gt;5 stars.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed any real difference between this argan oil and Josie Maran&#x27;s, except for the price.  This is much more affordable for me.</li>
    <li> This product does as promised.  I use on my face and hands and have loved the results.  Soft skin but not oily.</li>
    <li> Absolutely perfect, can see the results already and my hair looks so healthy,</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this. I use it as a moisturizer on my face at night and on my nails and hair. It&#x27;s perfect for so many things. I love the bottle too... Dispenses a good amount of oil and I don&#x27;t feel like I&#x27;m wasting a drop.</li>
    <li> I just finished a bottle of expensive organic argan oil I bought in Switzerland and was dreading having to spend a fortune on a replacement. Argan has been really impressive at healing my &amp;#34;scaly&amp;#34; skin during eczema flare ups (although it didn&#x27;t help me with the itch) it made my skin look normal quickly.  I&#x27;ve been wanting to use it regularly on my dry hair and cuticles but because of the price, I thought I couldn&#x27;t afford it. After researching online I found this brand..organic, fair trade, and a large glass bottle with pump and half the price I paid before. I&#x27;ve had my bottle for a few days and so far it&#x27;s just as impressive as my old one. Because of the price I can now experiment using it daily on my poor nails/cuticles/hair because well, I deserve healthy skin right? I&#x27;m so happy I found this.</li>
    <li> This is an awesome product! Highly recommend this high quality product.</li>
    <li> I JUST RECEIVED THIS AND WHEN I OPENED THE LITTLE BAG IT COMES IN, I SAW THE BOTTLE ONLY 3/4 FILLED!  THERE WAS NO SEAL ON THE TOP OF THE BOTTLE ONLE A LITTLE PLASTIC WHERE THE BOTTLE AND THE BOTTLE TOP ARE. IT APPEARS TO BE THIS WAS USED AND RETURNED. I AM VERY DISAPPOINTED</li>
    <li> This product is amazing, this is the third bottle l am buying already.l use it constantly on my hair face and neck.thank you so much for this product</li>
    <li> I love this Argon oil!!! I use it mainly for my hair and face. It&#x27;s not greasy, absorbs quickly and makes my skin softer.Definitely,  yes!</li>
    <li> My skin can have a mind of its own...react or break out when I least expect it. Pura has been so gentle. My skin feels great and I smoothe the remainder through my dry hair. Easier to manage and style. I use less makeup as a bonus. This will remain in my skin care/ hair care arsenal!</li>
    <li> I was hesitant to buy this product. It appeared to be rather expensivie but had high reviews. I bought it and used it on my entire body. Applies very easily .... elimnates wrinkles especially around my elbows, etc. Leaves my skins soft and moist. Although I was hesitant to buy the first bottle, I bought another after I ran out. It&#x27;s a great product and would continue to buy more in the future. Although it&#x27;s only a one ounce bottle, it goes a long way.</li>
    <li> When I first purchase this particular brand I had also purchased a few others to compare and try.  This is the one I believe to be the best compared the five others I tried.  This is also the one I continue to recommend to others.  The consistency and smell is great and compared to others that have a somewhat unpleasant scent, I never had a issue with this brand.  Have and will continue to purchase again.</li>
    <li> I llove the oil-my skin is very dry and this hydrates without being greasy. I have used for a week and my mate says my face glows.I  use it now for a moisturer.. It was delivered quickly and boxed so safely. Thank you. Linda</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only had this product for 3 days, and I&#x27;m in love. At night after I cleanse, I rub the Argan oil all over my face and go to bed. The oil soaks right into my skin and doesn&#x27;t leave my face shiny or greasy. And when I wake up, my skin looks so healthy and feels soooo soft, almost velvety. I almost feel like I could go without makeup. I will most definitely be ordering more and recommending to friends.</li>
    <li> An hr later i look at my skin an i an extremely ashy I have never been so dry. My eurcerin works wonders not this oil thing .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The real argan oil is smooth on my skin, good scent and moisturizes. It absorbs very well and does not weigh the hair down. That is what deserves 5 stars</li>
    <li> I love this product . It is amazing. The smell very nice and the bottle is very convenient to use .</li>
    <li> I have found great benefits to using argan oil.  I had previously purchased a no name brand which was 100 percent argan oil as well but found this brand to be better.  I can not determine why that is other than the press that they talk about when making the oil.  This must be similar to olive oil when they describe the first cold press being better.  I would definitely recommned this brand.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried almost every face care regime out there with little success. I took a chance with this particular argan oil (because it was the best price point) and am so please! My skin looks younger, feels better, AND I no longer have super crazy oily skin! It&#x27;s balanced out! I apply 3 drops every morning and every night (and sometimes if needed during the day too). LOVE LOVE LOVE it! I&#x27;m on my second bottle!</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this oil. I mix it with my lotion to use all over or use it alone. It absorbs quickly and leaves your skin soft and supple. This is a product I will continue to use and always have on hand.</li>
    <li> Moisturizes skin without being oily. Makes face feel smooth as silk.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff! Mix a drop into my moisturizer and even eye cream. Great for cuticles also!</li>
    <li> This Aragon oil is truly amazing. I&#x27;m 34 and have exceptionally dry skin on my face. A friend recommended Josie Maran Aragon oil, but at almost $70 an ounce it was alot for a product I wasent sure would work. So at $25 for 4 ouncesI thought I&#x27;d give this brand a try. I am SOOOOOO HAPPY Idid!! I wash my face at night squeeze  4 pumps into my hand and apply to my face. I follow this with my regular nightly moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;In the morning my skin is as soft and beautiful.&lt;br /&gt;I also squeeze one pump and mix into my foundation every morning. I can&#x27;t tell you how lovely it makes my face look. Definitely invest in a bottle of this, you will NOT be disappointed.</li>
    <li> Product as described. May work but is oily to my skin. Vitamin e cream or ointment for my skin works better.</li>
    <li> amazing on hair and skin!!!!!</li>
    <li> I really love this Aragon oil. I would use this after I washed my face at night, and would wake up with soft, smooth skin. i noticed that my skin looked brighter and my dry skin went away. I would recommend this to anyone who has dry skin or use it as a hair treatment. I would occasionally rub a small amount onto the ends of my hair to help prevent dry ends. Try it and you won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
    <li> Love this for my face and hair! Tried it because I love pura d&#x27;or Hair loss Prevention shampoo. Argan oil is non-comedogenic and leaves me feeling fabulous, finally something beautiful to moisturizer my crazy sensitive facial skin.</li>
    <li> It has been a year and a half since I bought this product, and I have half of bottle left. I love this oil, it nourishes my ends and keeps my hair shiny and healthy.</li>
    <li> It some times makes my hair oily and have to do frequent head baths</li>
    <li> By far the best stuff for your skin and great for sensitive skin (and I mean sensitive!) I am on accutane for my acne and it makes you have terrible dry skin - I sleep with this on and really put it on any chance I get. Works like a charm! LOVE. Will buy again and again and again!</li>
    <li> It works for my hands. Made skin soft. My mother also using this oil to protect her nail and she is totally satisfied!</li>
    <li> First off, I&#x27;m a younger looking 67 year old who has spent most of her life worshiping the sun.  I&#x27;ve been hearing more and more about the wonders of Argan Oil for over a year and thought I would give it a try.  I made my first purchase well over two months ago and have been using it religiously ever since. The only concern I really had was that it might be greasy – not the case.  I mix it with my face serum, incorporate it into my body moisturizing regime and use a few drops in my hair.  This product is a miracle – It’s made a remarkable difference in my facial skin tone, texture and moisture, and the benefits are equally impressive on my neck, back, legs and arms.  I add a little oil to my wet, freshly shampooed hair before I blow it dry – the shine is amazing.  I just can’t say enough about the benefits of this product.  I’m in no way a skin care guru, but I have tried several types of well-established, high-end beauty products in the past that promise to produce results – most of which end up being a hype, plus they are chock full of chemicals.  I prefer to go as natural as possible and I have finally found the perfect product.  If anyone is on the fence about trying Argan oil, I suggest you give it a try…..and I don’t think you will be disappointed.</li>
    <li> So far, I love it. Please keep in mind, this isn&#x27;t Moroccan Oil. This is a natural product, it smells faintly like nature and isn&#x27;t super heavy. The consistency is like olive oil. It works wonderfully when I straighten my naturally kinky curly hair. Providing shine and protection. It also smooths the cuticle, so my ends look less damaged.</li>
    <li> This product is a great treatment on minor cuts to speed healing, and on cuticles. I have changed from my flat iron heat treat hair product to this with great results plus much healthier for my hair. It has so many anti aging and healing uses! It is too thick to use under makeup but nighttime facial treatment is a great alternative time to give my skin an organic treatment.</li>
    <li> Have been wanting to try Argan oil for some time now.  I am 58 yrs young, and have the laugh lines &amp; wrinkles to prove it, along with the gray hair!  I use this mainly for my skin as a moisturizer, and LOVE it!!  I have used this head to toe.  Makes my skin so soft and has diminished some of my fine lines!  My gray hair is so much softer.  I add this to my Wen, and have gotten better results.  I was given a bottle of JM argan oil as a gift, and there is no difference.  I will definitely buy this again, as you can&#x27;t beat the price!!  I also love their packaging... Recycled paper and the fabric pouch that it comes in.  They not only care about the product they provide, but also care about Mother Earth!  Great product!  Great company!!</li>
    <li> Excellent seller and excellent merchandise and fast shipping strongly recommend  it Thank you .</li>
    <li> Great product for the price.. Will be trying other products as well.....</li>
    <li> Very nice product, I use this oil instead of hand cream especially before bed and my skin just drink it, good product and best of all organic</li>
    <li> Great quality oil at a great price.  I use this for face and body and its non oily after it is absorbed unlike other types of moisturizers.</li>
    <li> Just got our Argan oil this morning. We love it!</li>
    <li> I have tried a dozen of products for reducing appearance of fine lines under my eyes, this is the only thing that works! After cleaning my face am and pm, I smooth a drop of the oil and massage with fingertips until it&#x27;s well absorbed. Best facial oil ever!</li>
    <li> You can see immediate results with Argan oil. When putting this on, my dry skin was instantly nourished and softer. I can&#x27;t say if the brand is better than others as this is the first time that I have bought Argan oil pure.</li>
    <li> This is an awesome product for dry hair and skin.  First of all it is certified organic pure Argan oil with no other additives. This greaseless, scentless formula improves the moisture of the skin and hair immediately with no oily residue.  It makes the skin feel dewy and babylike. Compared to other cosmetic companies&#x27; prices of argan oil products, Pura d&#x27;or&#x27;s  price is amazing for the 4 fl oz bottle .  A huge benefit is that this oil will improve the dry condition of your hair, face and body. I&#x27;ve used argan oil for the last 2 months and have found that this is the best product for hair and skin that&#x27;s dry and dull.  Rub a little on your shoulders and legs for a natural and healthy glow when you wear clothing that bares your arms and legs.  I recommend you give Pura d&#x27;or&#x27;s Argan Oil a try.</li>
    <li> Love Pura d or Argan oil.&lt;br /&gt;It has made my skin so soft.&lt;br /&gt;Love that you only have to use a small amount to get great results.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you for a wonderful product.</li>
    <li> I have used over 5 bottles of this product and it is the best moisturizing product for my dry, acne prone skin. I also use it as a eye makeup remover and it removes my waterproof mascara in no time without irritating my eyes. The formula is light, non greasy, and it feels like there is nothing on my skin. It helped me to get rid of my red discoloration on my face and most importantly-it is not causing breakouts like other moisturizers for dry skin. Truly a great product, so please do not discontinue.</li>
    <li> I adore this product.  I have very long very thick hair and this oil doesn&#x27;t make it heavy or greasy.  Just one pump is enough to cover my hair and keep the ends from drying or splitting.  If you&#x27;re looking for quality oil that works on your face and hands as well as your hair, this is the one.  I have no complaints about this product.  It doesn&#x27;t contain harsh chemicals so I&#x27;m not afraid to use it anywhere.</li>
    <li> I LOVE THIS OIL!&lt;br /&gt;They give you lots of oil and the product is very well packaged and high quality product!</li>
    <li> it smells a tad medicinal but it still works pretty good, similar to &amp;#34;Watts&amp;#34; argan oil...ill def. buy it again, and the price was good</li>
    <li> I have used the Pura D&#x27;or Organic Argan Oil in the past and am still using it.  It is a wonderful product.  I put it on at night so that it is working it&#x27;s magic while I sleep.  It is a gentle oil that leaves your skin feeling soft but even when newly applied, doesn&#x27;t have that heavy oil feel.  I have noticed that my face is more evenly toned, blemish free and fresh feeling when I use it on a regular basis.  I had run out and was using a night cream while waiting for my new order of Pura D&#x27;or to arrive and sure enough, I broke out in pimples and looked tired.  It&#x27;s amazing how a good product leaves you care free.  I love argan oil and see myself using it for many years to come.</li>
    <li> I saw results the very next day. My face is very sensitive and breaks out with any cream or oils I&#x27;ve ever tried. This argan oil hasn&#x27;t bothered my face at all. I LOVE it. My face seems smoother and clearer than ever before.</li>
    <li> Unsightly brown age spots on my hands, arms, and neckline started fading after applying oil at nighttime for one week.  I have continued to use it nightly and my hands look younger.  Love the deep hydration of this product, started using it on my face as well .  Also after having colored my hair for years my hair looked brittle and dull.  Applying a couple of drops to freshly washed and towel dried hair it has definitely changed the appearance and now my hair looks silky.  I never had this result after trying other expensive shampoos and conditioners.  This has been my little &amp;#34;fountain of youth&amp;#34; in a bottle :-)</li>
    <li> I had a sample to try and ordered the product. I am very satisfied with it. I have been applying it daily and I even received compliments at work that my skin glows. My partner uses it for the skin eczema and it seems to be improving.</li>
    <li> This product is great and has so many uses! The price is great too-so much less than a similar product with a celebrity&#x27;s name on it. I use it as a face oil, on my hair to smooth it, and on my skin to moisturize. Great! Will definitely be ordering this again.</li>
    <li> This Pura D&#x27;or Pure &amp; Organic is a great product that actually works better than advertised. For the price I knew it had better work, and I was more than pleased. Sure, I wish more came but products this good are usually higher than the junkie stuff anyway and I&#x27;m thrilled to get it as long as it works so well! The thing that makes the price even better though is that it lasts so long, a little goes a long way so don&#x27;t over-dispense because the quality is such that it doesn&#x27;t need that. This works great as a travel bottle by the way but I only travel about once every couple of months.    My oily skin means that I often cannot use most moisturizers. My face is often inflamed from too much sun (I am in and out of buildings a lot throughout the day) and this is a soothing moisturizer that helps keep the moisture in that the sun wants to keep away. Also, my boss says the redness is far less lately and the only thing I know of to attribute that to is Pura. Let me finally say that I sometimes break out with moisturizers but this one has caused me no problems. A very nice find.</li>
    <li> I just started using the product, so i cant say i saw a big change in my hair or face, but i definitly like the oil. After using it as a serum, i had a great feeling, my hair was soft and it wasnt greasy. I am expecting a lot from this oil, i heard soo many great things.The only thing is that the shipping and the handling fees are expensive from US to Canada, even for a litle bottle.</li>
    <li> I am 60. For the first time in my life I had someone comment repeatedly (in public, even) on what a beautiful complexion I have. The only thing I have done differently is use this argan oil on my face. I have also noticed that the &amp;#34;liver spots&amp;#34; on my face have faded. I will definitely be buying more.</li>
    <li> I guess people around me have noticed certain changes on my face but I personally haven&#x27;t noticed anything specific, like I know that my face is not dry once I put on the oil, but my biggest concern which was dark circles under my eyes - did not go away.. Its been around 2-3 weeks since I started using the oil.</li>
    <li> Amazing product same as josie maran aragan oil but more less expensive</li>
    <li> My hair is shinier, softer, and has more bounce. I would definitely recommend this product!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product EVERY DAY over 6 months for my hair. I have straight hair (used to be rather oily). Without using any hair conditioner, my hair is still silky and smooth. And, ironically, my hair is less oily after applying this oil!  I just pump it twice into my palms, rub it , and comb my hands/fingers through towel-dried (or half-dried) hair.  I occasionally apply this produce on my face at night when my skin feels dry. I am going to purchase this again!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product from about a month , I see significant change in dark spots around my eyes.This is a pure Aargon oil product compared to other products which have a less amount of aargon oil and other chemical mixtures. And now ordered the second one .</li>
    <li> This stuff didn&#x27;t really do much to my hair at least not that I noticed but I&#x27;m giving it 5 stars because it made my stretch marks disappear.. And they were a hideous dark purple color. I have zero stretch marks on my body now. Great moisturizer for skin. Would recommend to everybody looking for something natural, inexpensive, and life changing! Natural beauty is the way to go.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping. I&#x27;ve only been using it for a week and it works very well. I will update once I use it for more than month to let you guys know...but so far so good.</li>
    <li> I have VERY frizzy hair and this stuff makes it 50% less frizzier than it usually is which is an A+ in my book. I use about 2-3 pumps, don&#x27;t use more than that, I made that mistake and my hair was oily and gross feeling. but a little goes a VERY long way. It smells nice too and doesn&#x27;t fade out of your hair.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this if you have frizzy or sun damaged hair. The Argan Oil also comes with a little pamphlet that tells you about the many different uses for argan oil and comes with a carrying bag.</li>
    <li> I really love this argan oil. It works very well. I put it on my face as a night time moisturizer and wake up with very soft skin. It definitely has helped my dry skin and makes my skin more dewey</li>
    <li> Great packaging and amazing argan oil. I use this product on my hair every day and I have noticed a dramatic difference with texture. Would highly recommend as part of a hair care routine!</li>
    <li> I love this product.  The oil absorbs quickly and hydrates immediately.  Love that it is unscented and that the it is packaged in a spray bottle for easy application.  I would definitely recommend this to friends and family.</li>
    <li> Like the product.  I use on my hair and face since I live in a dry climate.</li>
    <li> This has to be one of my Favourite purchases for quite a while, mainly because it makes my skin feel luxurious (if that makes sense)  It certainly feels really smooth and the oil doesn&#x27;t just sink in and thats it, it really leaves a lasting effect.  Haven&#x27;t tried on my hair yet but I believe its really good for that, I have used it on my nails (natural!) and it really makes them shine and they look really fab.  Would definitely recommend this as its a real luxury product but not overly expensive.</li>
    <li> Goes on smooth.  No sticky or really oily feeling after.  Leaves my skin very moisturized.  Seems to help clear up occasional blemishes.  No heavy fragrance, just a light natural scent.</li>
    <li> Thick, emollient, wonderful!  This is the ONLY thing I&#x27;ve found that can keep my skin from cracking and peeling during the winter when it&#x27;s 10% humidity inside my house.  And it does more for the skin&#x27;s quality than any fancy cream.  I use it on my face, neck, decolettage, hands, elbows, feet.  wouldn&#x27;t be without it.  And it never ever breaks me out even though it is wonderfully thick for an oil.</li>
    <li> I just starting using this product this week.  I decided to order this particular argan oil because the reviews were so favorable.  I&#x27;ve been using Watts for the past two years, which I really liked.  However, just based on the reviews and also the price of the Pura d&#x27;or argan oil, I decided to try it.  Unlike Watts, which is totally odorless, this product has a very slight scent, which is almost unnoticeable, but not unpleasant at all.  The oil is absorbed quickly on my hair and does not leave any oily residue.  I don&#x27;t, however, care for the spray applicator.  I would have preferred an eyedropper dispenser.  I do believe, however, that for the value and it being totally organic, this item is a great product.  I love using argan oil on my hair; it seems to do wonders for me.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d heard of Argan oil as a facial moisturizer before and when I got the opportunity to try a free sample of the Josie Maran Argan oil from sephora I jumped at the chance. I loved how it soaked in fast and didn&#x27;t leave me feeling greasy, a common problem I have with moisturizers and my combination skin. Once I used up my sample I wanted more but found the Josie Maran products to be a bit pricey. This stuff is just as good as the Josie Maran line but you get a lot more bang for your buck! I was a little worried at first if it would be as good the Josie Maran brand, but it did not disappoint. Now I used it on my nail cuticles and the end of my hair when they are feeling a bit dry. It is unscented and just a great all around beauty product. Definitely worth a try!</li>
    <li> This is like nectar of the gods.  Argan oil is the most amazing thing that I have tried for my hair. It doesn&#x27;t take make, but for your skin or hair it is a miracle.  I just love this!!!</li>
    <li> Love this argan oil! It helps to tame frizz and leaves hair very shiny. I also use it for my face and it leaves my face smooth. Since the oil is rich in vitamin E and essential fatty acids it deeply hydrate and nourish my skin. The oil easily absorbs into my skin, which is something i love because i hate to see my face looking oily.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great. I read it could help with hair loss so I bought it but it made my head feel so good that I just shaved it. Now I put this stuff on my head, my face, my lips, my hands. I never really moisturized before - I&#x27;m not even sure if this is really moisturizing, but it makes me feel awesome. My skin feels good and it makes my face feel less tight if that makes sense.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s oil but not like olive oil, it dries into my skin in a good way, it makes my skin feel healthy.</li>
    <li> I love, love love this Oil! My skin has improved so much. I am on my 6th bottle and I am sold on this product!</li>
    <li> I first heard of Argan Oil after noticing several friends on Instagram (from different parts of the world) raving endlessly about it, and having a soft spot for all things au naturel, I decided to give this a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a point of reference, I have normal to dry skin and previously, my skin-care routine would include the not-so-budget-friendly Repairwear Laser Focus by Clinique, its Dramatically Different Moisturizing lotion, Moisture Surge, Pore Refining Solution, All About Eyes (de-puffing) and Aveeno&#x27;s range of face-cleansing products. Having received my first bottle of Argan Oil, I decided to stop the Clinique products and used only (one drop of) the Argan before bedtime and pre-makeup routine. In the morning, I wake up with a bright, soft, supple face, and application before makeup gives me the dewey look - not the oily kind, just nice and fresh-looking (and I&#x27;d like to reiterate again that I only use one drop from the pump for the entire face - not sure what happens if you put more, maybe, maybe it will make you look oily). My point is, it has the same exact effects as the more costly Clinique products I&#x27;ve been using, in fact, only better, because it is organic, and not synthetically-made, not to mention that the Clinique products did not give me that dewey, healthy glow. I especially appreciate the convenience of having to use only one product for both night cream and daily moisturizer than the list of products I mentioned above. It&#x27;s really that good that even my non-metrosexual (read: typical guy, with non-elaborate skin-care routine) husband has joined in the bandwagon and noticing significant difference with his skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a minor comment for improvement, it would be nice if Pura d&#x27;or can revise the information pamphlet that comes with the packaging for a more professional and convincing look and feel because the written description (in English) that came in mine was hanging, &amp;#34;Pura d&#x27;or argan oil aids in building firmer skin, while restor- &amp;#34; - well, some people do read the fine print and benefit from the little details provided :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise, all else is really neat about this product. It is also available in the 2oz/100ml option which makes it easier to bring along as a carry-on luggage during air travel. Definitely will repurchase and highly recommend to those who are seeking natural alternatives and support businesses that are mindful to mother Earth i.e. the company uses unbleached recycled paper for the pamphlets and printing ink used was produced from a sustainable process, the fabric pouched included in the packaging made from natural fibers is reusable, disposable, biodegradable etc., just perfect for the environmentally conscientious.estor- &amp;#34; - well, some people do read the fine print and benefit from the little details provided :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise, all else is really neat about this product.

    <li> I like this oil though not certain that it is that much better than Baby Oil or Olive Oil, both of which I&#x27;ve used for skin lubrication and rubdowns. Thought I&#x27;d try it for its &#x27;cachet of the moment.&#x27;</li>
    <li> I use it every day and I feel like my skin is softer and more moisturized in the winter months.  great product and it feels less toxic than synthetic lotions.  i&#x27;m going to only use this argan oil for my skin now.</li>
    <li> Good product for the price! Love this for my face and hair!</li>
    <li> I was very disappointed with this product. It made my hair a greasy mess.  I returned it and got my money back.</li>
    <li> This has everything Argan oil should have, a dark glass bottle and clean oil with a slightly nutty scent. This does not clog my pores and is goof gor hair or skin.</li>
    <li> I love this Argan oil! The smell is not strong but has a light nutty scent.  Very pleasant! The pump is an added bonus.  I will definitely purchase again.</li>
    <li> first bought this from groupon and found the same price online! use it on ends of hair and on face! does not break me out</li>
    <li> The word \\&quot;Pure\\&quot; on the bottle says it all. This isn&#x27;t all that greasy stuff we call moisturizer.  This oil is a wonderful hydration product, leaving the skin feeling smooth and rejuvenated.  I highly recommend this product to anyone who experiences dryness from jumping in and out of the shower multiple times in the summer heat.  It is a God-send!    PURE INGREDIENTS without all that watered down and greasy feeling that leaves you dry after 10 minutes.    BEST VALUE for this type of product.    EXTRA SMOOTH so no need to use a lot.  Just a little does the job.</li>
    <li> This stuff is AMAZING!! I have used it on my skin and hair morning and night, and I have noticed a huge difference. My hair feels stronger at the ends, and it seems like its growing healthier and longer. And my skin has improved drastically. Iv noticed even around my eyes, the fine lines have started to disappear. I have gone through so many products trying to find out what works best, and even the high end ones do not beat this! BUY IT! YOU WILL NOT REGRET IT!!</li>
    <li> I love it , my mom loves it and A+ packaging very neat and all argan oil :)</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product . I was nervous at first putting an oil on my face knowing how I break out from products . I read previous reviews and decided to give it a try. I&#x27;ve been using it everyday for about two weeks and no break outs ! My skin hs alrwasy improved, I am seeing a more even complexition.</li>
    <li> I have to say that I received the argan oil in a reasonable time frame and was highly satisfied with the benefits of this product!  I have applied it to my hair and skin with extraordinary results: my hair has strengthened and is shinier while it has rejuvenating effects for my dry skin, especially with this winter weather.  I can&#x27;t find anything negative to say about this brand; I love the fact that it&#x27;s organic and fair trade as well.&lt;br /&gt;I really hope that they never discontinue Pura d&#x27;or! Thank you---I seem to get compliments on my hair and skin since using it :)</li>
    <li> Love the texture, no harsh smell, makes my skin look healthy.  I wish I had a bigger bottle :)</li>
    <li> I got this to clean my face. It the best oil I have ever used for that purpose and it doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin. I just get a bunch on my hands, rub it all over my face, and wipe off the excess with a cloth in the shower. This will be my standard oil now, it works great.</li>
    <li> These is such a great and lightweight oil.  It feels great on my skin and my hair especially.  Since purchasing, I will say, I definitely see a difference in my nail quality as well as my overall skin tone.  I highly recommend purchasing this</li>
    <li> This is really a worthwhile product. I have been using it for over a month now, and am very pleased with the effects. I use it in conjunction with rosewater toner for facial treatment, and there is a clear difference the next day. It makes my skin feel super soft and smooth! I have tried many expensive brand name facial products, and the effects are not as good as this argan oil. I’ve also tried using it on the ends of my hair, and it seems like a great treatment to prevent dryness. The smell is also very light and pleasant. I would highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> This oil is incredibly luxurious and permeates the skin in such a unique way. It is light and silky, with a slightly woody smell. I was initially worried that it wouldn&#x27;t be worth the money, as an oil is probably just an oil, but it is genuinely set apart from other oils (coconut, olive, etc.) in it&#x27;s own way.</li>
    <li> This oil is wonderful.  It makes my hair really soft and my skin very smooth after each application.  I love it so much that I am getting one for my mom as well.  It gets absorbs quickly and smells very natural.  I love it and will definitely order again.</li>
    <li> I have been using different brands for years and Pura is not only giving me what I expected for my face, but also as a hair treatment and craked feet. Recommended 100%.</li>
    <li> This is my third bottle of this argan oil.  I just love it -- I use it daily to moisturize my face and it works without making my face oily or greasy.  When my hair feels dry on the ends, it works well for this too.</li>
    <li> My hair feels soft and shiny after.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff! I put it on at night as a heavy moisturizer and then just wash it off in the morning. It keeps my skin from cracking in the winter and I have noticed that my face has less shine by the end of the day. It feels great on my skin and keeps it clearer than using other moisturizers.</li>
    <li> This is the first time I use this oil and I was very impressed by the relatively quick result. The wrinkles around my eyes show some improvements and my skin is also firmer. Use on my hair; it reduces my dandruff. This oil penetrates fast and is not greasy as others. I am happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> I used to buy the &amp;#34;one and only&amp;#34; brand. When I read that this could be used on your face, I was skeptical. I know how my hands felt after using the other brand. There was a coating on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a very different oil. It is light and absorbed into your skin with no greasy or plastic coating feeling. It does wonderful things to your hair. You get very nice shine without a greasy look or feel.</li>
    <li> I used this as part of a mix in my oil cleansing method oil and as part of a beard oil for my husband. I also use it occasionally as a moisturizer. It has worked great so far. It absorbs right into your skin.</li>
    <li> High Quality at and excellent price.  Very fast shipping.  Recommend for dry ship.  Absorbs quickly.  Recommended item.</li>
    <li> I have been growing my nails again.I work in lab and wash  hands  hundred time per day. My nails were layers peeling .They  are start growing slowly at last.I put one drop after washing of hands .it works.</li>
    <li> Very pleased with my purchase of pura d or argan oil.  Much more affordable and gives me good results.  I will&lt;br /&gt;continue to use this product.  My skin is softer and some brighter. Love it.</li>
    <li> This is fantastic ,great feeling on scalp after use....</li>
    <li> Great product, will buy again!</li>
    <li> Love it!!!  Makes my skin feel silky.  I&#x27;ve been using it on my dry nails since I received the bottle three days ago and immediately saw the difference.  This is a must have product.  A little goes a long, long way.</li>
    <li> I have used other argan oils before that have left my face feeling and looking oily.  I kept hesitating to take the plunge and shell out the money to buy good quality argan oil but I am very glad that I purchased this brand after seeing it go on sale.  This brand left my face (in which I already have naturally oily skin) looking great without the oily look.  It actually feels like it is working deep down instead of just sitting on the surface of my face.  I would definitely recommend this product!</li>
    <li> One of the best oils, to use on one&#x27;s face, a little goes a long way , the skin absorbs it so it doesn&#x27;t leave an oily appearance to the skin. Keeps the skin soft and smooth, with no chemicals.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for couple weeks now, and still see no improvement on my acne. However, it makes my skin feel nice so I&#x27;ll continue to use it and hope that it&#x27;ll eventually show results!</li>
    <li> Love this product! I use it for my super dry skin and notice a difference immediately.</li>
    <li> it is best for hair and skin.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product on my face for a couple of weeks now, I love it. The oil makes my skin feel soft and moisturized without feeling greasy. Great product that does not clog pores.  Great value for the price, I am so glad I tried argan oil.</li>
    <li> I have been using it for the past 3 weeks for my adult acne and it has worked wonders.  It has also relieved very dry eczema patches for my eight year old daughter.  The quality of the oil itself is very good, the packaging is a dark colored glass bottle with a pump that dispenses just the right amount.  The pump works very well - does not spray everywhere, nor does it waste any of the product.  I am definitely going to continue to use this as my primary moisturizer as I am now into organic natural products.</li>
    <li> I buy this to moisturize my dry, curly hair, and I use it for this purpose after every shampoo.  In addition, it&#x27;s my one-bottle moisturizer for hair AND skin when I travel.  My hair sucks it up quickly with no greasy feel at all.  On my skin, it&#x27;s a bit greasy for at least 30 minutes.  This is the best deal I&#x27;ve found for pure Argan oil.</li>
    <li> Awesomeness Reloaded. I love this product and it works for me like never before. I used for my skin and hair also. Worked Excellent. Highly Recommended for those who have Sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s only fair to upgrade this review after using this oil longer. I have been using just a drop on the dry parts of my face under my moisturizer and I have found that it is absorbing well and not then leaving a gloss finish. Good addition to overall care.    Given the positive reviews, my hopes were high--perhaps too high. I tried this on face and body and hair and found it no more effective than any other oil, even oilive oil off the kitchen shelf. On hair, even with the smallest amount, hair looks oily or simply dirty. I left it on overnight a few times to see if there would be any hidden and lasting moisturizing results on hair or skin, but that did not happen. A good moisturizer for hair or skin seems to give a better result without the oily gloss.</li>
    <li> This argan oil is amazing for skin and hair. I use it as a hair treatment when I get out of the shower and it leaves hair feeling super soft and shiny. It&#x27;s also a great moisturizer for the skin and doesn&#x27;t feel greasy or too heavy. I&#x27;ve already gone through many bottles and would definitely recommend it as a natural moisturizer/treatment!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for a whole month, really like it. It helped fix my hair problem, my face feel smoother, you can use it as hand or feet lotion too, amazing!</li>
    <li> a great moisturizer especially for winters. light, non greasy texture. leaves radiant and healthy look. loaded with anti-oxidants.</li>
    <li> The shipping is fast. The argan oil comes in a dark bottle with pump. The big difference between this oil and other argan oils I tried is the scent. It smells herbal and doesn&#x27;t has the sewer smell of other oils. It makes my skin soft and smooth. I like it a lot. The only thing is that the bottle is not full and I don&#x27;t know if it is full 4fl as it claimed.</li>
    <li> This product does all it claims. Love it.</li>
    <li> Immediate results are apparent as both my hair and beard felt supple and sleek. Tiny amounts go a long way, especially when mixed with your other favorite essential oils and fragrances. My fiancee has been using Argan Oil for her hair and the long term results are quite noticeable and convinced me to get my own!</li>
    <li> I have been using coconut oil for years, then I stumbled up on the advertisment for this Argan Oil. I have been using this Argan Oil for a short period of time, but I can truly say that I&#x27;ve seen a difference in my hair and skin. My hair is kinky, but it is more manageable and silky. My skin is much clearer and I have had a few deep pores with information in them, After using this oil, I have mashed the information out and the deep pores are gone. I&#x27;m very happy and pleased with this product.</li>
    <li> great product, it was delivered very fast....&lt;br /&gt;i would recommend it to my friends. I notice the difference in my skin after the first week.</li>
    <li> I love this oil. I use it for my face moisturizer daily. I use it also for my hair but as I have to put oils in I find that I need a little more for my hair. However, this is perfect for my facial moisturizer. It does not leave my face oily but it moisturizes for the entire day. It&#x27;s hydrating without being oily. My skin is sensitive so when I find something that works I stick with it and this stuff is perfect for me.</li>
    <li> This is a great product - purchased on a recommendation from my daughter because my nails were chipping and splitting - once I started using I saw results quickly.  I also use on my face, hands and feet.  I have used now for two years and won&#x27;t be without!</li>
    <li> Love this oil specially to the tips of your hair ad nails, changes have seen as good and it coats your skin without leaving any mess like other oil does.  Recommended highly.</li>
    <li> Amazing product. For the longest time I have been looking for a moisturizer that will go along with my combo type of skin. I have broken out on everything I used. Pura d Or Argan oil changed everything. Within 3 days of use, Ive seen a huge difference on how my skin looks and feels like. This is definitely a must buy product.</li>
    <li> This argon oil has some done wonders for my color treated hair, and my kids hair as well. I also use it as a face cleaner when needed. Will order this brand again</li>
    <li> Awesome stuff!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But it is very thick feeling and can be hard to evenly distribute through the hair. Because of this you may want to mix it into something else so it&#x27;s easier to get all the hair.</li>
    <li> I have recently started waxing instreas of shaving so this product was an absolute must. It soothes and calms my skin better than any product that I&#x27;ve tried before and a little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> I have used 2 different well known brands for years. I noticed that each of them smelled rancid/chemical-like but I assumed it was just the nature of  argan oil.  How wrong I was!  This product truly has no odor at all.  The consistency is a bit thinner than other brands I have used, however, my skin is incredibly soft. I will be a repeat customer, I love this product!</li>
    <li> I love this &amp; use it daily after bath/shower as an all over body moisturizer.</li>
    <li> This product was amazing.just as good as others at a better price. Recommended to friends.</li>
    <li> It is basically odorless, and colorless.  Regular use will make your hair feel soft, moisturized, and healthier.  Hydrates all day long.  I&#x27;m a 25 year old man with short hair.  I only need 2-4 pumps.  I&#x27;ve always been dissatisfied with my hair.  It is dry, and flyaway.  This product makes it simple to comb into a simple part, and stays in place without looking like there is any product in my hair. One 4 oz bottle has lasted me 4 months.  My mom and sisters love it.  I would recommend it to anybody.</li>
    <li> I have tried a few of these oils in the past and this has been the best so far, the oil absorbs quickly, to a dry finish, and looks natural.  I have been using this facially for almost three weeks now and my skin looks great, top marks, thank you.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m so happy I found this. Other Argan Oils I tried were either lower quality or much more expensive. This one is high quality, a large bottle (so it lasts much longer), and at a great price. I&#x27;m really thrilled with it. I use it on my face twice a day, on places where I have eczema or psoriasis, on my hair, nails, and brought it with me while traveling for a month as an all-purpose moisturizer. High recommend and I&#x27;ll be purchasing it again and again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used pura d or for several years. Tried it first through a groupon deal and fell in love.  I have dry skin to the 100th power and inflammation from my exzema and this stuff helps with the dryness and inflammation. I trust this brand of argan oil.</li>
    <li> Not only does this work on skin - and don&#x27;t be fooled by the &amp;#34;oil&amp;#34; part - it absorbs quickly.  But if you&#x27;ve just washed your hair &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34; your hands by running them through your hair - it will dry faster too.  I know - sounds counter intuitive - but it does!</li>
    <li> It is a good product. It does not make your face too oily, which makes you available to use this product at daytime. And it&#x27;s non-comedogenic as established, and it did not cause any breakouts on my face so far. I use it on my face after shower, and I am loving it.</li>
    <li> Love this product.  GOOD for dry hair and skin, doesn&#x27;t make you break out.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s simply amazing for the hair!!!! Make sure to use small amounts for your hair so it do not become so oily anyways Its been a while like two weeks or so, I have a curly hair with so dry ends but I really started to see a big difference in my hair&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Totally recommend</li>
    <li> Love love this argan oil. I use it on my wet hair before I dry it and and then a little before I style. My hair has never been so healthy. It also makes my skin so super soft. It&#x27;s all around a great product!</li>
    <li> My wife use this prod Pura D&#x27;or Pure, she was pleased with this organic product.  She has been using this Pura D&#x27;or Pure and Organic Argan Oil for past four months on body and hair and face.  I had re-order this product form Amazon, as price is good and so does the quality of product.  I &amp; my wife would recommend this product to others.</li>
    <li> First, I didn&#x27;t notice that it was four ounces....and it smells a little like olives.  Call me crazy....I wish there could be some real standardization on this type of product.</li>
    <li> I think this my third bottle and have ordered another.  It really is great for my skin and make up removal too.</li>
    <li> curly hair heaven  My hair for once is tame. love this for curly hair!!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this as part of my overall regiment.  I have dry skin and love this for a night time oil. Great for your hair as well.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t understand all the positive reviews. This stuff is AWFUL!  &amp;#34;Light&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;weightless&amp;#34; it is NOT. Not only is it heavy and greasy, it is sticky as well. I put ONE DROP in my palm, rubbed hands together, and lightly ran them through hair. I looked like I had soaked my head in motor oil. It literally took 2 shampoos to get my hair to look clean again. I then tried it on my hands as a moisturizer. I might as well have used some honey. It was so sticky I had to even wash my hands twice ... and even then, they still felt tacky.  Maybe it is a wonder product if you can deal with its unappealing texture, but no way I could not get past that to give it a try.</li>
    <li> This product it&#x27;s really awesome!! I have a sensitive skin but with this Argan oil my skin looks so cool!!!</li>
    <li> I have tried other so-called pure Argan oil from other auction sites. But this seems to be the real deal. If you don&#x27;t like to use gel or hairspray, this is a great alternative. It&#x27;s great for high humidity days in the summer or dry days in the winter.Just work in a few drops and your hair is far more manageable. It has no real scent, (the knockoff version has added perfume and diluted with other oils) so you don&#x27;t have to worry about smelling feminine.</li>
    <li> I have to say this argon oil is legit. My face is glowing with happiness! I also use it for my hair and hands.</li>
    <li> I am completing my first bottle of Pura d or argon oil, which I use as a facial and hair moisturizer. I previously used Morroccan oil so my review is based on a comparison of the two products. I noticed right away that the argon oil is quick to penetrate the skin and hair so I made sure to have my face damp before applying the oil. Because it penetrates so quickly your face feels smooth but not greasy. I love how it feels on my skin and though it&#x27;s aroma is not as aromatic as Morroccan oil, it is nice and does not not overwhelm the senses (I realize with Morroccan oil, there are other ingredients beyond argon oil). I especially feel the benefits of argon oil around my eyes with a noticeable decrease in fine lines, puffiness and discolorations. The best part for me has been the significant reduction of black heads! My skin feels fresh, healthy and moisturized. As far as my hair is concerned, I use one pump of the oil on my damp hair and it works well to moisturize, due tangle and add a nice shine to my hair. I don&#x27;t use it every day as I noticed my hair would get flat/heavy with daily use. I highly recommend this product for both the face and hair and feel overall it is a better product tha Morroccan oil</li>
    <li> Love Argan oil based on the property. Havn&#x27;t seen much difference but I guess would take ore than few months of usage :) Good price with Amazon.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing! I truly love it. I have very dry flakey skin on my face and feet, so I used it early in morning and my skin stayed soft and flake free all day. This is the best moisturizer I have used. I even let my co-worker use it and she has serve psoriasis on her arms and legs. She was very happy with the results.</li>
    <li> I love this Argan Oil. I had breast cancer surgery last year in July then went through seven weeks of radiation. I started using this oil on my breast every day after radiation and every night before going to bed. My surgery scar is hardly noticeable and the radiation oncologist was really surprised at how well I did with no burning. He said I was in the 1% that didn&#x27;t have any issues with burning. As I get older, I realized I had really deep frown lines on my forehead. I started using this on my forehead twice a day. I can already tell how much they are starting to soften and fade. I have been recommending this to all my family and friends.</li>
    <li> I love this product so much!! I have struggled with  rosacea and acne my whole life and it has made an amazing difference in my skin. I don&#x27;t even feel the need to wear make up any more. This stuff is legit.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for a month now its amazing my hair looks great I deferentially recommend this great  product</li>
    <li> I originally got hooked on argan oil by trying Josie Maran&#x27;s formula and I loved the way it made my skin feel...but it was way too expensive to justify the continued use.  I read a review on here to try this product and I&#x27;m so glad I did.  First, the concept of putting oil on your face made me cringe, but all the testimonials seemed like it could be a good thing.  I&#x27;m in my mid-thirties, but people continually think I&#x27;m in my twenties.  This product moisturizes and hydrates your face, but will not clog your pores.  In fact, when I get a zit, this seems to make it go away faster...no multiple days of zits and piling zit creams on at night to hope that they are lessened the next day.  This stuff really helps.  AND my pores are minimalized along with the lines around my eyes and bags under my eyes being almost non-existant.  Secondly, what I love about this specific product is that it is cheaper than other brands AND it comes with a pump.  Josie&#x27;s comes with a dropper - which is hardly effective in getting a consistent amount on your hands to smooth on your skin.  To me, that makes this product something I never want to be without.</li>
    <li> I bought it for my mam and she is happy with it and with the quality.</li>
    <li> I have been using the Pura d&#x27;or Argan oil now for a month and it is fantastic!!!  I have gotten compliments on my skin, love how my face feels and can tell a total difference!!  I put it on my face nightly then rub excess into my hands and through my hair. My hands look hydrated and nails look better, too!  It is a little miracle in a bottle. My husband was impressed with the results and started using it, too. :)  This is a MUST buy!!!!!  Will be ordering  over and over and giving as gifts!</li>
    <li> Excellent!  This has replaced many expensive skincare creams in the end saving money and giving my 50 year old skin that baby fresh feel and look.</li>
    <li> Works good, but the oil smells like sour manure.</li>
    <li> My daughter recommended this product to me and I have used it for year and also recommend it to my friend.</li>
    <li> I have incredibly curly and dry hair that I am continually challenged with frizz and breakage from.  I&#x27;ve been using this for just a couple of weeks and my hair is in much better shape.  Even with the recent humidity it is controlled and not frizzing out!  I love this and would recommend it to anyone!  My hands also are much softer after putting it in my hair!</li>
    <li> This is, my 2nd time purchasing this item and I love it!  I didn&#x27;t notice a scent a slight scent, until now and ice been using this product over a year.  I use it on my face, hair, skin, heels etc..</li>
    <li> favorite oil for my skin</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Pura d&#x27;or argan oil for several weeks now and my skin is softer and my hair is shinier. With the cold weather this winter and the heat on full blast indoors, my usually dry skin is not dry at all. In addition, my son-in-law, who I would say is not usually very observant, said my skin was glowing and asked me if I was doing anything different to it! That&#x27;s the truth. I also love that this product is organic, has no scent, and contains no additives or preservatives.</li>
    <li> One of the best oil I ever used, this is my fourth bottle.</li>
    <li> I have to agree with what most people posted it seems weird to put an oil on your face but this moisturizers well and really balances skin oils. I have oily skin and have used moisturizers that leave my face shiny after a few hours but with this after its absorbed I go all day with balanced skin. Go figure an oil leaves less of a sheen. I like to put about one pump into my palm and then dab on my face in strategic spots with my finger then gently use my fingers to massage it all over until my face is adequately covered. A little goes a long way. It doesn&#x27;t cause me redness and leaves me with a pretty even complexion. I have used it in my hair as well and like the way it looks afterwards. I know not all products work for everyone but with so many uses its hard to think that this product will ever go to waste.</li>
    <li> Moisturizer ur skin well</li>
    <li> I bought it because I needed something for my dry hair, and after seeing such good reviews I decided to buy this instead of the Moroccan Oil like everyone is raving about.  Not only did this &amp;#34;pure argan oil&amp;#34; not hydrate my hair and make it feel smoother, it leaves my hair all greasy and chunky.  It does NOT make your hair heathier by any means!  I then tried using it on my face after seeing reviews of this oil improving their skin, IT BROKE ME OUT THE NEXT DAY.  I CAN&#x27;T BELIEVE I SPENT $27 ON THIS BOTTLE OF CRAP.  I WANT MY MONEY BACK.</li>
    <li> Lovely product, absorbs quickly in hair and skin, very moisturizing, my hair is feeling and looking much healthier. No odd smell, very slight smell (practically odorless but honestly my nose is sensitive and I pick up on faint smells easily) but not unpleasant. A little goes a long way, don&#x27;t overdo it like I did at first LOL! Protects it when I blowdry as well. Genuine product! Hard to find such a thing in regards to Argan oil. Will order again, thanks!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s smaller than I expected but I only used it once and can see a slight difference! And there&#x27;s really no odor unless you take the top off and smell the liquid.</li>
    <li> Great for skin care. I tried it on my hair and it was too greasy so I will stick with my organix Moroccan argan oil for hair, but this product is nice as a nighttime moisturizer for face and skin.  It isn&#x27;t as oily as some and could be used for daytime under makeup as well.</li>
    <li> I have loyally used this brand of Aragan oil for three years and I can&#x27;t imagine not starting and ending my day with healthy radiant skin. It has been a godsend on my hands and nails and I have used it for my hair in the summer due to continued chlorine exposure. I use this oil on my hands, neck, arms, legs and feet. It especially works on my dry elbows. I buy mutilple bottles and ask for this as gifts for my birthday. I will use this Argan oil twice daily always, and I love how it leaves my skin super soft, and glowing. I use this even more in the winter due to the extreme cold and how it can chap my skin, it will leave your hands and nails healthier than they have ever been.</li>
    <li> I have only been using pura d&#x27;or for a couple of weeks now and I am very pleased with the results.  It hydrates my skin without leaving it feel oily and diminishes the fine lines around my eyes.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about a year now and I love it! I use it on my face, body and hair. It doesn&#x27;t make me break out and it isn&#x27;t too oily. Just a few drops and I&#x27;m moisturized all day. Don&#x27;t too much in your hair though or it will get a bit oily. For the price and quality, I would definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> Awesom product ,I love it and recommend it for others to use</li>
    <li> This product seems to work, its not as strong as one would expect medication to be but it has none of the harmful side effects (unless of course you are somehow allergic to argan oil). I&#x27;m relatively satisfied with what I got. Basically its a solid option for your skin, including for acne problems, but its not the perfect solution (sadly there is none for a lot of people). I would definitely recommend this product over prescriptions since my skin hasn&#x27;t looked this healthy in over a decade.</li>
    <li> I recently got sunburned on my face and my face was so dry and flakey, a friend of mine told me to use argan oil so I purchased a bottle.  After the third day the skin on my face was so soft and no sign of flakes I was just amazed. Now I use it daily on my face it makes my skin feel so good to the touch.  I am also going to start using it on my hair.  I would recommend this product to anyone.  The price is so reasonable.!! I wish I had known sooner about this product it&#x27;s that good.</li>
    <li> My hair seems to like it :)  all it takes is a tiny tiny bit - otherwise you look like a greaseball..</li>
    <li> This was my first time purchasing Argan Oil. Everything is great except for the dispenser- it is very leaky. The Oil is perfect for dry skin after a shower.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent product. Work very good on my hair and let my hair shining.</li>
    <li> I bought this oil because I heard of how amazing it is. I have been struggling with acne and acne scars, so why not give it a try. I do not recommend this product if you are prone to break outs, as I find out that this was the result after each usage at night.</li>
    <li> I wanted to try Pura D&#x27;or argan oil after using Josie Maran&#x27;s argan oil. This oil is great alternative, organic, and way cheaper than Josie Maran&#x27;s oil. i love how it makes my skin feel soft and moisturized without feeling greasy. I will definitely buy again</li>
    <li> I love this product!  I live in a very dry environment and this argan oil is a must have.  It&#x27;s great for use right out of the shower on my face, hands, and elbows.  Every morning I apply a little bit under my eyes and on my crows feet. I truly believe that it makes a difference and I never travel without it.</li>
    <li> Received an expensive sample of another brand....this is just the same and much less expensive</li>
    <li> Great product, will definitely purchase more of those in the future!</li>
    <li> I use this for everything. Hair, hands, skin, homemade deodorant and even my face when its cold and windy outside. Works like a charm!</li>
    <li> Love this oil, I find it very moisturizing and beneficial to both skin and hair. Application is easy, there is a slight medicinal smell but not overwhelming. It feels light going on and smooths out easily, not an oily feel, skin is so soft afterward. I recommend.</li>
    <li> At first, I was skeptical of the benefits of argan oil. I have used countless of skincare products in the past in hopes of finding something that would work with my combination skin, from drugstore brands, such as Neutrogena, to high-end skincare products, such as La Mer. It wasn&#x27;t until my friend started raving about how argan oil has quickly become a staple in her skincare regime that I finally decided to give it shot. I was debating between the Josie Maran brand and Pura D&#x27;or. I quickly canceled out the Josie Maran after realizing how much more expensive it is per ounce. After 2 weeks of using the product every night, I&#x27;ve begun to notice a glow in my face that I thought was impossible to achieve without make-up. I thought the oil would sit on top of my face, but it actually absorbs quickly after I apply it. I wake up with supple, healthy, glowing skin that even my boyfriend notices! So glad I found this!</li>
    <li> I am enjoying this product and using it on my face and my hair every day for about two weeks now.  I already notice an increased smoothness to my&lt;br /&gt;skin. My hair is much softer and not as dry, and this pure oil is really adding shine all over. I am so glad I gave this at try. It is worth&lt;br /&gt;every penny.</li>
    <li> Being a \\&quot;southern girl\\&quot; transplanted to New England almost 8 years ago, I feel a like like a fish out of water due to the lack of humidity. The cold weather months wreak havoc on my skin. My skin becomes tight, dry, and sensitive. Over the years I have tried just about every moisturizer, lotion, oil, etc. to try and bring some relief to my skin (especially my face) to no avail.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Luckily I stumbled upon the Pura D&#x27;or Argan Oil on Amazon due to it&#x27;s wonderful reviews in my desperate search to find something that would help. The fact that it was pure, organic, and cold pressed sealed the deal and I ordered the 1 oz bottle to give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used it now twice daily for almost two months and can honestly say it has completely saved my skin. After the first couple of days of use I noticed most of the tightness, especially around my eyes, was gone. Within about a week my skin was no longer sensitive. About a week ago I glanced at myself in the mirror and noticed my skin actually had some glow to it again which I have not noticed in almost 8 years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It absorbs wonderfully into the skin, and does not leave a greasy feeling. I put in directly on my face both in the morning and evening and work it in before applying my normal moisturizer. I&#x27;ve found that leaving your face slightly damp after washing it helps the oil spread around a little more easily as you try to work it in, and absorbs a little more quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I add about 4-6 drops (the 1 oz. bottle has a dropper) to my body lotion before I put it on. I also apply 2-3 drops to my hand and work it into my damp hair before styling it. Soft glowing skin and soft shiny hair thanks to the Pura D&#x27;or Argan Oil! I will never be without it again, and plan on purchasing the 4 oz. bottle when my 1 oz. bottle runs out.</li>
    <li> Hi.I recently moved to US after marriage. My husband has been using this product since long now and was advocating it to me. As I have sensitive skin, I was reluctant to use it. I have tried various other products before from top brands in India and US, and was sticking to a lotion that I believed caused least irritation to my skin.  Since last three weeks, I am regularly using Purador oil, which took a lot of persuading from my husband.  But now I feel the difference, and I know I did the right thing. I am so happy with my skin, it looks so supple and clear, like never before. I have no problem using any cosmetics.  Earlier I was afraid of using any oil on my skin, thinking I will develop pimples. But this oil immitates body oil and is non comedogenic and feels natural. I have started using it on my scalp too, and my hair looks great as well.  I am glad I did listen to my husband and made the right choice!  Excellent product, worth the cost. I love it and will continue using it!</li>
    <li> Good Product but couldn&#x27;t get the hype.</li>
    <li> It is perfactly to my hair and face!</li>
    <li> great product!  absorbs quickly, non greasy, hydrating</li>
    <li> Versatile, effective, clean &amp; reasonably priced. I use on my face, hands &amp; hair. A little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> Received this lovely smelling Aragon oil very quickly! It smells and feels like heaven. I bought it to use as my &amp;#34;after cleansing&amp;#34; face moisturizer that I am infusing with frankincense, myrrh, lavender, and rose oils and I&#x27;m keeping some in a separate container as a hair serum. Two thumbs and many applications. I love a USDA certified Organic oil! Thanks for a wonderful product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase, I use it for my hair and face. It absorbes pretty well and has a pleasant scent. It&#x27;s good for moisturizing. It helps revive damaged hair (I&#x27;ve been coloring my hair for a long time). I rub oil in my hair and then wash it after a couple of hours. Then I put a few drops on washed hair, especially the ends.</li>
    <li> This is my first time buying Agan oil. I have combination skin especially my T-Zone is more oily than the other part. After using it on my whole face, it&#x27;s amazing that I don&#x27;t even feel greesy on my t-zone, plus it give extra moistures on my both cheeks. I love it and will continue to use this product.</li>
    <li> I have tried many other argan oils and I have to say, so far, this has been the least greasy one of the bunch! It absorbs quickly and has a velvety soft texture when put on the skin. I am very happy with my purchase of Pura d&#x27;or.</li>
    <li> I love this oil, it is not greasy on your face. You can put on small amount, rub it in and apply makeup. I like it for dry cuticles also.</li>
    <li> I have to say I&#x27;m pretty satisfied. I have curly hair that tends to get dry and frizzy, as well as a dry scalp that can be pretty frustrating. I get a build-up of dandruff that needs to be washed with a special shampoo otherwise I&#x27;m all flaky and gross. What this means is I have to wash my hair more often than I should which can leave it even drier.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried other oils and creams, but they leave my hair greasy. Argan oil is the best so far. Lately, I&#x27;ve been washing my hair at night and taking just a little bit of oil and rubbing through my hair (and scalp, too, in certain places) and I&#x27;ve seen a change.&lt;br /&gt;Just this morning my sister commented on how much better my curls have been looking. There&#x27;s still some frizz, but I think with time and as my hair grows out, it will be even better.&lt;br /&gt; And the oil does help with those dry patches on my scalp. It is more moisturized, but I still have to stay on top of it, of course, with the other rxs I use. It does seem better to use the rxs with the argan oil, rather than just the rxs themselves. So I&#x27;ll give argan oil credit for that, too. One last thing is that the bottle can last you a long time. Like months, depending on how you use it, so it&#x27;s a great deal.&lt;br /&gt;Hope this helps!</li>
    <li> I was suffering from hair loss and none of the earlier oils I had tried including some good coconut oils seemed to work on me. Besides they leave your hair sticky and have a strong odour in them. I read about Argan Oil and its benefits and then thought of giving it a try. My first Argan oil was the one sold by Aria Starr Beauty on Amazon.  This was a good product but it was very expensive. Then I thought of giving PURA D’OR argan oil a try. This was certainly the best oil I have ever tried. It reduced my hair loss to a great extent and also makes my hair look shiny. It has also made my hair look more dense than ever. I use this oil only on my hair and I have used it on my face only a couple of times. I cannot vouch for the benefits it has on skin, but as far as hair goes, this product is simple magic. I would highly recommend you to give this a try.</li>
    <li> This Argan oil is amazing.  I do have oily skin and hair(at the scalp, dry ends), so I was a bit leary on using this for my moisturizer.  When I used it (right after my shower) it went on and sunk right into my skin-no oily residue.  Even on my face.  And the next morning my skin looked so healthy.  I also use it in the last six inches of my hair, and it makes it soft and shiny.  You do not need a whole lot.  For the hair, two pumps (I have long hair) rubbed between my palms and then massaged into the ends of damp hair.  Blow dry, and no more dry ends.  I really love this oil and the fact that it is organic and has no chemicals in it is a real plus.</li>
    <li> I really like this product. It feels so smooth going on and feels like it is repairing my skin. I received the shipment in a timely matter and am very happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> I have used the products for years. Highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t used this oil on its own so it&#x27;s hard to judge the effectiveness,  What I do like is that it is a very light oil that is readily absorbed in your skin.  It does not leave a oily greasy feeling.</li>
    <li> I have tried several brands of Argan Oil and was very pleased with the quality of Pura D&#x27;or Pure &amp; Organic Argan Oil.  I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Very disappointed! Package came less than full and appeared to have been partially used.  Seal was broken.  I have purchased many brands of argan oil.  This one did not have the orange tint and smelled like some sort of peppermint oil/other oil product.  Product in bottle did not appear to be argan oil.</li>
    <li> I mix the Argan Oil with all my lotions as well as use it alone on my face.  My skin has never been better.</li>
    <li> This feels great on the skin and the hair, really helps with my cuticles.  However make sure not to put to much on the hair or it will turn greasy.</li>
    <li> much affordable than the argan oil I used before, excellent quality, vividly shine the hair without feeling oily or sticky. Easy pump apply is a big bonus. Started to include this in bathroom counter staple supplies.</li>
    <li> This Oil is light and pure. I have tried other brands for comparison, and this brand is the only one that gets those top notch Argan Oil results on my skin.</li>
    <li> I have tried several brands of argan oil and I must say this one is the best of them. I use it at night on my face and it feels rich, soothing and very moisturizing. I would definitely will be buying this brand again.</li>
    <li> This product is a one stop shop for all beauty needs. It is great for hair, skin, nails, etc. It is very moisturizing.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for about a year and am totally pleased with how my skin looks and feels. I had used it at night but for several months I have stopped using day cream and use this both day and night. I do apply a sunscreen on top for day wear. I recommend this product!</li>
    <li> This is the second time Ive bought this Argan oil from this brand and I love what it has done to my hair and skin. I first chose this brand over a year ago because it is USDA Organic 100% pure and its cruelty free so its not tested on animals. And the best part is that its way cheaper than other brands but its the best! Its nicely packaged in a dark glass container so its always perserved and you know its the real deal. I mainly use it for the bottom 1/2 of my hair but ocassionally I use it on my face before I sleep. A little goes a long way! I only apply i pump to my face and about 2-3 pumps for my bottoom 1/2 of hair. Its improved the softness and dryness and frizziness of my hair and my skin feels hydrated and not flakey anymore. I will continue to buy for the years to come. A bottle lasts me about a year or year and a half.</li>
    <li> I have been using Argan oil for several years and recently found this brand which I am very pleased with. I use a few drops in my hair especially the ends which tend to dry out from the Florida sun and swimming. The oil leaves my hair silky. I also use it on my cuticles and face and neck while it is still damp. I only use organic products and this brand does not have an odor as some others I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
    <li> I love this oil! My skin is so soft. I use it on my face neck and chest. At night I put a little on my hand with my nighttime gloves in the morning my hands feel &amp; look amazing. I use it as extra conditioning for my hair.</li>
    <li> Buy the expensive stuff. Gave this a try with all good reviews but it just doesn&#x27;t compare to the expensive oils. Hate the smell too..</li>
    <li> My hair and skin has never looked so healthy. I absolutely love this product, and I will continue to use this product everyday. I highly recommend this Argan Oil</li>
    <li> Just as good as the &#x27;big brand&#x27; imo.  I use it on my face, chest, arms, legs.</li>
    <li> It seems more comes out the spout than what is preferred.  It did not seem to help with my dry skin on my face so I&#x27;m trying something different.  I use it for my nails and that is working out ok.</li>
    <li> I just got my bottle but have been using it everyday and already my skin feels great. I have used on my hair in the past and loved it but never thought to put it on my skin. It is not super oily and soaks in fast leaving you to be able to dress right after.</li>
    <li> Smooth. Has tremendously helped my cuticles. I. Using on area around eyes. Mix with body lotion and my skin has never been smoothe and softer!</li>
    <li> My husband uses this on his skin and hair - likes it very much. He intends to try it as a pre-shave lotion too.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t expect it works so well. According to other feedbacks for the product I bought it for a try. I apply it on my hair, body and face, it makes my hair shining and silky soft and my face so smooth and soft. I am sooo happy with the product.</li>
    <li> Good stuff, I think. It did not turn my skin green.</li>
    <li> Argan Oil is a plant oil produced from the kernels of the argan tree that is endemic to Morocco. It is used for nutritive and cosmetic properties. Unroasted argan oil is traditionally used as a treatment for skin diseases and as a cosmetic oil for skin and hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;In cosmetics, argan oil is advocated as moisturizing oil, against juvenile acne and flaking of the skin as well as for nourishing the hair. This oil has also medicinal uses against rheumatism and the healing of burns. Externally, the oil is used to maintain &amp; fortify healthy hair and in the treatment of wrinkled or scaly dry skin.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Argan oil has become increasingly popular for cosmetic use. The number of personal-care items on the US market with this all natural product as an ingredient has increased significantly from 2007 to  2011. It is sometimes mixed with pomegranate seed oil due to its anti-oxidizing benefits, with vendors promoting this blend as an all-in-one serum both for skin and hair. I do not recommend using anything except 100% argan oil, as in the Pura&#x27;d&#x27;or product. Argan oil is sold without additives as a natural skincare and hair care product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since Argan oil is full of vitamins and antioxidants. It is commonly used in hair shampoos and conditioners to repair damage caused by coloring and straightening treatments, hair care tools, and even the sun. Argan oil contains tocopherols (vitamin E), phenols, carotenes, squalene, and fatty acids. The main natural phenols in argan oil are caffeic acid, oleuropein, vanillic acid, tyrosol, catechol, resorcinol.  After blow drying my hair, I put just a tiny drop of the oil on the palm of my hand and rub my hands together, then smooth through my hair. If you use more oil, your hair will become greasy. Just a drop will make your hair shines...it gives it luster.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The increasing popularity of argan oil has prompted the Moroccan government to plan for increased production, with their aim being to increase annual production from approximately 2,500 to 4,000 tonnes by 2020.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also use Pura D&#x27;or on my face - again, a small drop goes a long way.  It can also be used for any rough patches of skin, i.e., elbows, callused feet, etc. I have researched other brands of Argan Oil and Pura D&#x27;or is the best. It comes in a brown bottle so as not to allow the sun destroy it&#x27;s potency.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I cal this &amp;#34;Pure Gold in a Bottle&amp;#34;, as do some of my friends who now use it based on my recommendation.&lt;br /&gt;JANAnual production from approximately 2,500 to 4,000 tonnes by 2020.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also use Pura D&#x27;or on my face - again, a small drop goes a long way.  It can also be used for any rough patches of skin, i.e., elbows, callused feet, etc. I have researched other brands of Argan Oil and Pura D&#x27;or is the best. It comes in a brown bottle so as not to allow the sun destroy it&#x27;s potency.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I cal this &amp;#34;Pure Gold in a Bottle&amp;#34;, as do some of my friends who now use it based on my recommendation.&lt;br /&gt;JANA</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a male using this as an all around moisturizer and I love it. beginning to replace all my moisturizer products with Pura d&#x27;or argan oil. A few drops goes a long way.</li>
    <li> I use this twice a day after washing my face. It is a great way to keep my face moisturized and I have seen a significant improvement in my acne and oily prone skin! I definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> This is my second time buying the pura dor argan oil. It&#x27;s amazing how this product helps smoothen my hair and revitalize it. I recommended it to my mom and it works perfectly well with her dyed hair too. Her hair has been yellowish and dry for several years and using this product makes her hair looks healthy and dark brown again. We really love this product and will continue using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought my first bottle last year and it seems the stuff does get a little sticky over the year and the effectiveness was not as good as a year before, so make sure to keep minimal air and light contact to prevent this from happening.</li>
    <li> Product is affordable and comes in a very professional package. The bottle has a pump, not a dropper which is something I like much better. The oil itself is very nice and absorbs into skin quickly leaving it soft and smooth. I also use it in my hair where it absorbs equally as fast. Really great stuff and really impressed wit this product. Will buy again.</li>
    <li> Really good stuff! A small amount of it leaves the hair soft and frizz free. I recommend this!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this argan oil. I have not tried other kinds but i can say that this one helps my curly frizzy hair look shiny and voluminous although I have thin hair. I also use it on face at times but for me the main use is for my hair. I also use this on my son&#x27;s eczema skin as a body moisturizer. It helps some.</li>
    <li> This oil is wonderful! I was surprised how big the 4 oz bottle is, worth the money. I am all about coconut oil, but heard Argan was more absorbant for the face. It definitely is and seems lighter on my hair as well!</li>
    <li> I use it every morning on my neck and decollete only because my face can&#x27;t take it - it breaks out. I dont see any spectacular changes but I think it&#x27;s a good moisturizer after all.</li>
    <li> This is a god send. so many products for skin and hair are so very expensive. Pura Argon oil does it all. It has reduced my fine lines and helped to get rid of sun damage. It has made my dry brittle hair feel like healthy normal hair again. This product does it all. No more spending big bucks on too many products that fill my shelves. Just this is all I need.</li>
    <li> I ordered this for my husband.  He has dry skin and does not like scented products.  He has been using this for about 3 weeks on his face and arms and is very pleased with the results.  You do not to use much.  I ave used it in my hair as a leave-in conditioner.  gain, use sparingly.  So far so good.</li>
    <li> I ordered this oil so I could mix it with essential oils to make a hair mask. WOW am I impressed! The quality is great and when combined with my essential oils it was a powerhouse. My hair is shinier and healthier than ever. Definitely ordering again.</li>
    <li> Excellent product. I have used this for several months and have noticed a difference in the strength and health of my hair. Would certainly recommend to anyone who wants naturally healthy hair.</li>
    <li> It really is like liquid gold. My skin never felt so soft with creams and lotions. The good thing is that it absorbs so quickly. I use it for hair and skin. It&#x27;s wonderfull</li>
    <li> This has done wonders what other skin products could not do. My husband had a dry skin problem around his nose...it took some time to get accustomed to this oil ..but then no more dryness problem..it has no side effects at all..&lt;br /&gt;For me ..the acnes have stopped since I have started using it..its not oily at all.. moisturizes your skin perfectly..Will buy again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a huge believer in the power of organic oils. I enjoy facial oil cleansing &amp; have collected a wide variety of oils in my research for natural cleansing &amp; moisturizing alternatives.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let me begin with the packaging. These guys care about the environment &amp; it&#x27;s apparent by the way everything was packaged. The insert was printed on recycled paper, the oil came with a cute little pouch made of natural fibers. I liked that little extra touch because I tend to get my bottles a little greasy &amp; the little bag solved that problem. I don&#x27;t know about anyone else but I appreciate companies that care about mother earth. We should all strive to be environmentally friendly... :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The oil is AMAZING! I have been using it for a couple of weeks now &amp; have noticed a more even &amp; smooth texture to my skin. I massage 2 pumps worth of oil onto my face for about a minute or until it absorbs, which it does unbelievably well and quite quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the only oil that doesn&#x27;t make me feel greasy or as if it&#x27;s just sitting on top of my skin and I no longer leave oil stains on my pillow cases because it practically disappears, leaving behind a supple and silky feeling. I have to say that I&#x27;m completely addicted to that silky feeling. I can&#x27;t help but touch my face with the back of my hand just to feel the smooth and soft silkiness. I really have to stop touching my face but for now I can&#x27;t help it, I&#x27;ve never felt my skin this way before! I&#x27;ve always had soft skin but this makes me feel baby soft and I like that!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It comes in the perfect dispenser. The oil comes out neatly, doesn&#x27;t spray and is easy to control the amount you need. I don&#x27;t usually pump more than twice. This stuff goes a LOOOONG way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I notice that ever since I started using this oil my arms and legs have become smoother &amp; my face has a noticeable healthy glow. It has given me a natural blush and I couldn&#x27;t be happier; I&#x27;m not good with make-up so I don&#x27;t wear it and I have to pinch my cheeks if I want &amp;#34;blush.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The last time I had a pinkish hue in my cheeks was when I lived at home &amp; ate home cooked meals. Those pink cheeks went away soon after I moved out on my own &amp; began feeding myself. &#x27; Seems like this oil really helps with blood circulation, hence the pinkish hue to my cheeks &amp; the vibrant, healthy glow to my skin. I wish I would have used this sooner!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this oil so much I put it in my body lotion, shampoo, conditioner, my home-made oil lotion bars and of course, I clean my face with it (by rubbing 3 pumps worth of it for about two minutes, then wiping it off with either a warm, wet towel or a dry one, depending on how lazy I feel that day or night).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love, love, LOVE this! Do yourself a favor &amp; try it yourself. It&#x27;s wonderful stuff. This oil is definitely a must-have for any beauty regimen. It leaves my hair a lot more manageable and I have less breakage. I&#x27;m so happy with my purchase. I will definitely purchase again!e to pinch my cheeks if I want &amp;#34;blush.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The last time I had a pinkish hue in my cheeks was when I lived at home &amp; ate home cooked meals.

    <li> Pleased with purchase.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for several years and absolutely love it.  My skin has a tendency to be on the dry side and I have noticed a big difference since using this argan oil.</li>
    <li> Love this! A little goes a very long way and leaves my hair shiny and feeling strong. After using it for a few months I have noticed my hair feels silkier even when I do not use this oil and I am sure it is not anything else I have done to it. As a black-haired woman that enjoys lightening my hair frequently, this is a lifesaver!</li>
    <li> I am a 32 yr old caucasian (light olive skin, long fine dark-blonde hair) mom of two toddlers that lives in the dry climate of the Colorado foothills. This is my nightly moisturizer, and i have seen an improvement in my skin over the last 4 or so months that I have been using this Argan oil. My older sister even said she noticed my skin looked improved. My face is softer and fine lines seem honestly diminished; i also did not suffer from any initial breakout or anything adverse. My only real complaint is that it doesn&#x27;t work very well as a daytime moisturizer because of the way it can repel mascara and other eye makeup (the makeup falls off my eyes and under my eyes - not pretty.) I also use a couple drops on my hair when wet and it makes my hair luxurious without being at all greasy - which was a surprise because any other oil i&#x27;ve tried has left a greasy after effect - ew.)  There is really no smell, which is fine. I plan to add a high-quality, non-toxic vitamin C serum to my nightly regimen but haven&#x27;t found the right one. This also lasts a really long time and is a wonderful value. I don&#x27;t write a bunch of reviews on products, but I thought this was worthwhile.</li>
    <li> I have tried another brand of argan oil and Pura D&#x27;or is truly the best.  This is absolutely my favorite facial moisturizer day and night and it leaves my face nourished.</li>
    <li> I love this product.  My hair feels healthy with a natural shine and manageability with out  weighing it d  My husband also started using it for his dry scalp.</li>
    <li> Still trying see if it works...</li>
    <li> I have 2 big deep cracks on the palm of my hand and none helped (crème, lotions, steroids). A friend gave me Pura D&#x27; Or and started using it. Now the cracks are closed up and my hands are doing great. I use them all the time now.</li>
    <li> Works well on eczema, acne, hair and nails</li>
    <li> Have been using this oil on my face and hair, and I really like the quality. I will continue to use this product.</li>
    <li> Love that this product is organic. Compared to Moroccan Oil, it is thicker and stickier. That being said, it quickly absorbs into my hair and I enjoy the product a lot.</li>
    <li> I have sensitive skin and love this product. It does everything I need. Couldn&#x27;t live with out it.It can be used for so many different things.Where I rub it on the back of my hands I don&#x27;t have Liver spots. I do have them on my arms. Just saying!</li>
    <li> FINALLY- an Argan Oil that does what I&#x27;ve been searching for since grasped the concept of using oil to deeply clean oily skin!!!  I tried several pure, organic argan and other oils from various good sources, but always ended up using them on my hands and feet, because they made my hair greasy if I tried to use it on split ends as a pre-shampoo conditioner, and ALWAYS ended up making my complexion break out after using it on my face. This product is SO different!  It WILL wash out of my delicate hair without leaving it stringy; and best of all - it truly helps my aging, oily, blemish-prone complexion clean itself from the inside out.  What started my search was a line in a fashion magazine: &amp;#34;Clogged pores in my nose that had been there since I was a teenager were gone!&amp;#34;  My miracle didn&#x27;t come from her brand - mine came from Pura d&#x27;or.  Thank you, thank you. I wanted to wait through several months to be sure that this stuff is as good as it seems - and I&#x27;m now confident that I can trust it. I recently started using it under my eyes as a moisturizer before bed, and either it has never gotten into my eyes, or I it has no ill effect if it does migrate.</li>
    <li> Glad I finally caved into the hype and tried this out. I put it everywhere, in my hair, on my skin, on my arms and legs and even nails as a good cuticle oil. I&#x27;ve noticed it stays in after showers. It seems to help the shampoo (sulfate-free) and my hair is shinier than ever. So glad I found it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I like this product in particular. I&#x27;ve bought other Argan Oils elsewhere and when it has other things in it, other than argan oil, it seems like it just doesn&#x27;t work as well. Buy the pure stuff and you can&#x27;t go wrong. I personally like this one, because it seems extremely well priced for the market. I will be buying it again.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite brand of Argan oil that I religiously use! I use it for my face primarily before I go to bed each night and I have seen incredible results. My main focus as a twenty year old is to prevent wrinkles before they arrive and keep my skin moisturized. I also use this on my hair after showering. I would recommend this product to anyone who wants additional moisture to their hair or face. The packaging is also very easy to use! My mom really likes the pump. I plan to repurchase.</li>
    <li> Before I started using this product I would shampoo and condition my hair every 3-5 days, but after I would my hair would feel dry until the third day when my natural oils have evenly distributed throughout my hair again. Well, now after reading all the countless reviews on this product I was sold to try it out and It has been the best decision I have made for the health of my hair! Right after I shampoo and condition I use two pumps and evenly distribute it through my hair, once it has dried my hair is left feeling soft with a nice healthy shine. I would recommend this product for anyone who wants to keep their hair healthy and strong.</li>
    <li> i&#x27;ve never liked using oil on my skin or hair, it makes my skin feel thicker and with the tropical weather in our country, it just doesn&#x27;t make sense. i&#x27;ve only started using argan oil and this brand is the first i tried. so far, so good. i like that it doesn&#x27;t smell at all, which means it won&#x27;t clash with my perfume or stain my clothes. the consistency is not too heavy and i like how my skin &amp; hair feels after i apply it. i will have to see if it works as good as the others have said. oh and item came well packed, this had to be shipped from the US to Asia so i was impressed with how secure the tapes and plastic were. no breakage!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s that good.  I ordered a couple of different kinds, both organic etc, but the other one has more of an odor when first applied (although it does disappear within a few minutes.) but this one has virtually no smell at all.  I have deep wrinkles on my chest which was the primary reason for my purchase, along with chronically dry heels.  I have been applying the oil twice daily for about a week now and my feet are baby soft and certainly the appearance of my chest wrinkles are diminished.  I love love love how quickly it absorbs and doesn&#x27;t perfume the air for half an hour.  I will definitely be ordering a couple more bottles to keep in inventory so I NEVER run out!  I think this size of bottle, being used twice a day on hands/feet/chest, will likely last a couple of months.</li>
    <li> I bought this about 5 months ago for facial use and I&#x27;m still not halfway through the bottle. Obviously, argan oil is amazing. It&#x27;s the perfect consistency (not too thick or light like other argan oils I&#x27;ve tried). It&#x27;s not scented, which I like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For my face I mix this with a drop of tea tree oil and my Aveeno moisturizer.</li>
    <li> Love this product mostly because you literally can use it on everything. i used it for my hair, my cuticles on my nails, my toes, my face, and my hands for when they were dry.. this is a very great product because it leaves your skin silky smooth and in time really help repair dead skin sells. as for using it in my hair i just used it to give it that extra shine. and it did the trick :) i also used it for a hot hair treatment warmed it up and put it on my wet hair after i had washed it and left it on in a towel for about a half hour. really helps the damange of split ends as well. this is magic in a bottle. good buy!</li>
    <li> Love it! It&#x27;s just what I expect...only $40.00 less!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried several brands of 100% Organic Argan Oil I found on Amazon, and this one is the best by far. It&#x27;s lighter and doesn&#x27;t have a strong vegetable oil smell that I detected using other brands. This makes my hair, which comes down past my tailbone, incredibly shiny and healthy. Look no further! This stuff&#x27;s the best</li>
    <li> I use this in my beard and hair and it is nice.</li>
    <li> Great. Awesome. I use it on everything. Yay.</li>
    <li> Let&#x27;s face it, you really can&#x27;t permanently change the effects of age and sun on your skin without surgery. Most topical treatments are super expensive and don&#x27;t work--I have tried quite a few over the last 18 months. Recently I tried argan oil and was really pleased—it actually does soften skin and improve texture enough to make a noticeable difference. I use it just after a spritz of rose water. I also blend a little Bulgarian rose and jasmine essential oils into the argan oil. It makes a very lovely, inexpensive facial treatment that gives noticeable results.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Josie Maran&#x27;s Argan Face Oil for 5 years non-stop. After reading reviews,  decided to give it a try because it is a fraction of a price.  I was pleasantly surprised and will be a repeat buyer. Here&#x27;s why:&lt;br /&gt;1. Pump bottle - easy to distribute product vs dropper (like in Josie Maran&#x27;s)&lt;br /&gt;2. Oil is nice and thick but disappears on skiN and moisturizers really well.&lt;br /&gt;3. Acts like a primer too due to nice thick but light canvas like consistency&lt;br /&gt;4. Great light smell. Some reviews mentioned that it was strong....and I&#x27;M very sensitive to strong smells usually.  This oil has barely there nice smell - cross between orange peel and rose.&lt;br /&gt;5. Cant beat the price.&lt;br /&gt;Hope this will help you to try this product.</li>
    <li> i have been using blackseed oil on my face for quite sometime i got good results,then someone recommended this oil to me i have been using it almost two weeks and i use say it lives up to all the claims made about it,it does not clog my pores in fact my pores look alot smaller and my skin alot tighter and moist i would definitely recommend it to anyone this is definitely a 5 star product</li>
    <li> great for face, hair.</li>
    <li> This is the one! I have long thick hair that tends to look dry and listless toward the ends. My stylist recommended I try this product, she loves it and also uses it for her skin. First time I used it I was so impressed. I never would have thought of putting an oil on my hair but wow, it looks and feels great. My daughter has really thick curly hair and now she uses it and absolutely loves it. I have dry sensitive skin which most products seem to irritate so what the heck I&#x27;ll try it on my face.......loved it, absolutely no irritation.. I was concerned that the oil would make my skin breakout but I was so happy....no breakouts. I use it on my hands at night also. I&#x27;m really happy with this product and can&#x27;t imagine anything that would work better.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve heard about argon oil use in many different capacities.  I purchased and have been very happy with the results.  Have used it on my feet, hair, chest, elbows.  Will be making it a part of my everyday regimen.</li>
    <li> Pura d&#x27;or  100% organic Argan oil is the BEST product I have ever used.&lt;br /&gt;I starred using it on my face but it got to my hair and to my surprise my dry curly hair is now straight and healthy.&lt;br /&gt;I LOVE it!&lt;br /&gt;BEST EVER for dry curly hair.</li>
    <li> helps in face appearance.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t see any improvement.still i can see lots of dandruff in my head.&lt;br /&gt;I have been using for past 20 days no improvement.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for one month, and am very happy with it. It soaks into my skin fairly quickly, and lessens the appearance of fine lines on my face. Also, I have been concerned in recent months about a noticeable loss of hair. While it is too early to have seen an improvement in that condition, I can definitely tell that my hair looks and feels healthier.</li>
    <li> Nice for a daily moisturizer</li>
    <li> Pura D&#x27;or Pure and Organic Argan Oil, Brown and Gold, 4 Fluid Ounce (Misc.)&lt;br /&gt;Awesome oil...very satisfied from it. It fixed all of my sister problems so she doesn&#x27;t have any problems now i use it myself sometimes too and i can say its working very well.If you got doubts i can say don&#x27;t lose time go on buy it now!!Great product &amp;#60;3 5 stars.</li>
    <li> I liked this product .it stopped my hair fall and gave a much better look and shine to my hair .</li>
    <li> Quality is great and the bottle is bigger then I thought it would be.  It even came with a cloth bag around it, so cool.</li>
    <li> Very drying!!!  I used it as a moisturizer am and pm.  I&#x27;m back to my tried and true Kiehl&#x27;s products.</li>
    <li> Loved this oil for my hair and face. Definitely will buy again</li>
    <li> Best argan oil by far ! Incredibly moisturizing very light doesn&#x27;t feel heavy or oily on face fantastic results !</li>
    <li> Everything was as promised and on time</li>
    <li> Argan oil is good for your entire body. You can put it on your hair,and it&#x27;s great on your feet. It travels well,because it&#x27;s in a small bottle. I keep it in my toiletry bag,when I travel.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for about six months now.  I use for my hair, which is long and curly.  I definitely see a difference in that it minimizes frizzes.  It certainly isn&#x27;t a miracle cure for everything that ails my hair, but it has made it extremely soft and when combined with a good mousse and occasional spritz of hairspray does a great job.  I don&#x27;t often find products that I purchase repeatedly, but I just bought my third bottle!</li>
    <li> I bought this product thinking I could use it in my hair because I am a huge fan of Moroccan/Argon oil. It is much to heavy to use on my hair. It seems to not absorb well. I do use it on my face at night after I wash my face. I haven&#x27;t seen any improvements other than its a good night time treatment.</li>
    <li> This stuff is awesome. My skin is very sensitive and this makes it very soft and smooth without being too greasy or irritating. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Great Product.  I use it on my nails since I play classical guitar and it keeps them from drying out. I recommend it.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great!  No weird smell, can be mixed with or added to any of your other moisturizers or creams, can be applied to your face after shower or before bed as moisturizer, etc.  I use it on every part of my body, even my hair, with my other products or alone as I prefer to do on my face.  Great Stuff!</li>
    <li> This product was shipped very quickly.  I love this oil.  It is great for face, nails and hair.  It is very high quality.  You will love using this instead of your usual face cream at night. It is hydrating and very light.</li>
    <li> I was on the fence about buying the oil because I didn&#x27;t want to spend $20+ dollars on something I wouldn&#x27;t like. SOOOO glad I took a chance on it. I use it on my hair and face as a moisturizer and absolutely love it! Granted, the first time I put it into my hair I used too much, about 6-8 pumps when 1-2 is just fine. I was afraid that the oil was absorbing into my hands rather than my hair so I added more than needed; I could definitely tell because my hair looked super oily and gross. Next day I only shampooed and added two pumps to my towel-dried hair and that was enough. My hair is thick and shoulder-length so I was surprised to see that 2 pumps was enough. As for a moisturizer for my face, I use it after washing off the Aztec Secret Indian Healing clay mask since the mask is so drying to my skin. It gives my face a healthy glow that had been missing due to my lack of sleep. I&#x27;ve been trying to put it around my eyes to help w/the newly developed creases before bed, so far results have been promising. I am a huge fan and will be replacing this as soon as I run out.</li>
    <li> I love this product.  It&#x27;s probably my favorite beauty product these days.  I have very sensitive skin and almost anything turns my face red and irritated.  I have tried other Argan oil products and they&#x27;ve always had a musky or funny smell which irritated my system and gave me a headache.  This product is pure, clean and has no smell at all.  I put two pumps of oil in my hands and then smooth it over my (clean) face before bed.  In the morning my skin is soft, with no dry patches, and no red splotches.  Truly one of the best products I have ever used.</li>
    <li> Love this oil.... But The price keeps going up, so I may need to try others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Soaks right in to my skin!</li>
    <li> Pura d&#x27;or usda organic Argan oil is the best!  I always buy the highly rated products from Amazon and this one does not disappoint.  i love it in my hair and on my body, especially my face.  Thanks&lt;br /&gt;Pura d&#x27;or.</li>
    <li> I use this mixed with my regular body moisturizer during the winter.  My skin has never been better.  I would definitely buy this again and will continue to use it during the cold winter months.</li>
    <li> This was the second Argan oil I tried.  The first I returned after using it only once because it smelled so strongly bad, and it had added tocophoral as a preservative.  Then I bought a bottle of pura d&#x27; or argan oil, since it is 100% pure, and I love it!  My husband and I both use it daily, me on my face and him on his hands. We&#x27;re almost out of our first bottle and will not let it happen that we run out before we get another bottle.  Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> I was afraid of the odor of the oil. This product does not have bad odor and works very well. It gives my hair volume and shine. This is my second bottle of Argan oil and I love it.</li>
    <li> Great product that I highly recommend.</li>
    <li> My package arrived on time as promised. The oil has little or no smell and a good feel to it. Nice bottle and attractive labeling</li>
    <li> I used it for eczema, and it made a huge difference after just one use. It was completely gone after three applications. I have also been using it on my face and it is awesome.</li>
    <li> I love this brand even though it the only Argan oil I&#x27;ve tried I feel its the best an so much cheaper than Josie Maran&#x27;s! Happy will buy more for sure!</li>
    <li> When I started using argan oil I started with josie maran....when the little bottle was almost out...although I LOVED the product...I couldn&#x27;t justify spending so much! Went on a search and came across this on amazon decide for the price and the amount I was getting, why not! I loved it even more than the josie maran! I&#x27;m 40 and everyone thinks I&#x27;m my 18 year old&#x27;s girlfriend - haha!  I don&#x27;t have any negative things to say about the product. Love the amount. There&#x27;s no smell, and I have a very sensitive nose. It&#x27;s lightweight, yet gives me perfect mosturization.  It&#x27;s the only mosturization that I use. I would not have reordered if I didn&#x27;t think it was a+</li>
    <li> Argan oil is expensive but addictive. It feels so good, absorbing quickly into the skin, and though there&#x27;s no miracle cure, it helps ease inflammation and smooth out sun and laugh lines. This bottle spritzes a little too forcefully so if I&#x27;m not careful it goes everywhere. That&#x27;s the only reason it&#x27;s not a five star review.</li>
    <li> Love it! Great product.</li>
    <li> 2nd bottle! Works nice.</li>
    <li> Perfect for dry skin as well as taming fly away hair!</li>
    <li> 3rd bottle of this product great for using under your makeup and a moisturizer at night, I&#x27;m never without it!</li>
    <li> Now I know why this brand of Argan oil gets such rave reviews.&lt;br /&gt;Just what I wanted, no unpleasant smell and organic. I really like the pump top dispenser. Other brands I have used had a eye dropper type.&lt;br /&gt;The pump top makes it really easy to get a few drops with just one hand.</li>
    <li> Smells and feels like the real deal but it makes me break out. Will use on my hair instead. Still a good product not just for facial use if you&#x27;re prone to breakouts.</li>
    <li> I used to buy half the amount of argan oil for $40 at my local salon. This product works just as well, its the same exact argan oil but at half the price. Its amazing! I bought a bottle and it lasted me about 7-8 months and I have a lot of crazy curly hair. I love it. I&#x27;m rebuying it right now!</li>
    <li> Great product !! Saved me from going bald !!</li>
    <li> This product is amazing!  I have bought so many product to try and tame my frizzy hair.  NOTHING compares to this. And, on top of it, it&#x27;s all natural.  I am so happy with this product.  Not only does it help make my hair look presentable, but it is adding moisture and repairing it as well.  5 STARS!!!</li>
    <li> Previously I purchased argan oil from Turkey, result my hair so smooth.  Since the price so expensive, try this pura dor which still expensive but one third of the price of other product I love. Seemed weird, cause the smell at glance like coconut oil, do they mix it?  I doubt that pure argan oil, since the shampoo and conditioner I purchase titled argan oil but in fact mostly just coconut oil I think. But found out the Pura d&#x27;or oil product is start working with my hand skin, so keep using this product.</li>
    <li> Purador argan oil has a wonderful product I used it to my hair and it gives the hair a natural sheen to moisturize and I used on the face and nails, the results were spectacular .</li>
    <li> Great quality Argan Oil, a very small quantity leaves my skin soft and glowing! Have had the bottle for a few months now and only half empty and I use it every day so great quality for great price! As an added bonus they give you a nice canvas carry pouch.</li>
    <li> I do not have another brand to compare this with, based on reviews this was the first argan oil I have tried. The consistency is thin, like an essential oil, not thick like baby oil. One pump is what I use to rub in my hands, then distribute the residual amount that isn&#x27;t absorbed by my hands onto the ends of my hair and near my forehead where my hair tends to be drier. I apply to my hair after I have dried it. It is light and not greasy at all. I apply this to my daughters hair after towel dry and let it air dry from there. I also apply this to my face at night after it has been washed and sprayed with a toner. It is absorbed and does not sit on the skin. I am real bummed that I have already dropped it from the shelf and lost all that was in it after only a couple of weeks of use. But as with oils, a dark glass is the best method for storage and preservation. I will be purchasing more.  *Update: By just leaving an amazon review, the company sent me another free full size bottle of argan oil. Replacing the one I had broken, so no money lost! Excellent :)</li>
    <li> I have alwayd used Josie Maran pure argan oil  &amp; when it was getting low I decided to look for a less expensive option that was still PURE argan oil &amp; that is exactly what I got with this. It is the exact same high quality pure argan oil for a lot less money. I will be switching to this brand exclusively going forward.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing on my hair. I tried it on my face, which is very sensitive, and I have two pimples. I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s just my skin trying to get used to it or if it&#x27;s too oily for it. Other than that it&#x27;s great. The oil is thick enough where it feels like it&#x27;s not going to evaporate or dry up from my hair. I love it!</li>
    <li> Its not heavy yet it feels very luxurious.  I think it definitely helps moisturize and helps my skin tone look more radiant.  I would recommend this to anyone.  It does not clog pores and really just makes my skin look great.</li>
    <li> I have been using few different brand of Argan oil and Pura d&#x27;or is the best, it&#x27;s not greasy and nozzle spray makes it easy to use and won&#x27;t get messy.  I use it for my dry and frizzy hair couple times a week and it works.</li>
    <li> Great oil for the skin and hair. I am using this to make beard oil.</li>
    <li> Excellent product. Has made my naturally curly hair soft again.</li>
    <li> I have been using a shampoo and conditioner with argan oil with excellent results on my dry scalp, and decided to try Pura d&#x27; Or argan oil straight for skin and cuticles.  I been using this product only a couple of weeks, but so far it is very helpful on my face and hands during the cold winter months.</li>
    <li> Good quality. No odor.</li>
    <li> love it!!! My hair is so soft yet weightless and since I am organic everything, I am overjoyed that it&#x27;s organic too! Definitely recommend it!</li>
    <li> Great product and price! I use Aragon oil on my hair after washing it and on my face every night. Great oil for hydration and purity.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing !!!! I just started to use it for 1 week and i start seeing results. The hair loss i had is much less now and it feels more healthier then before. Higly recommended !</li>
    <li> Have used as an oil wash and also in homemade lotions.  Works nicely.</li>
    <li> its not sticky, soothes the scalp and reduces dandruff.... best treatment for hair before sleeping at night and before hair wash</li>
    <li> This works amazingly well on my skin; particularly my face.  I was apprehensive about using it on my face as I have a great deal of trouble with acne.  To my surprise it actually helps to clear up my acne.  I put it on at night and in the morning any breakouts I have are nearly gone.  I&#x27;m am amazed at how well it works.  It also works as a great hair conditioner.  I put a little in my palm, rub my hands together and put it in my hair and night.  When I wake up my hair feels very soft, not greasy.  It&#x27;s a great product!</li>
    <li> I mix a little drop of this with my body lotion or facial lotion and spread on. Keeps my skin moist and young looking. Not oily.</li>
    <li> Absolutely AWESOME product!! It is the only product I use on my face and neck in the morning and night, under make-up and before I go to bed.  I am 51 years old and its the best product I have found.</li>
    <li> This amazing bottle of Argan oil has a PUMP.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;!!!!!! &amp;#60;3&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bought this as a replacement to another 4oz Argan oil i bought on here http://goo.gl/6SuAEC&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The oil is the same smell and feel so quality the same but this one wins because it has a PUMP!!</li>
    <li> This is my second bottle of Pura d&#x27; or  Argan oil.  I use this daily in my hair instead of gel or other hair products to style it with as well as make it look good.  I have gotten several compliments about the health of my hair.  As a guy I don&#x27;t really think about my hair very much other than combing it and putting something in it to keep it in place so the compliments are a nice bonus.  This is not stick or heavy just use a little and keeps my hair from sticking up.  It is also nice to find a product that does not make me smell like the Macy perfume counter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With this second bottle  have been putting a little on my face after washing before bed and in the last 10 days have noticed an improvement in my complexion.  Absorbs real fast and cant argue about the results plus I like that I am not applying a dozen chemical to my face like most lotions have.</li>
    <li> I live in a humid environment and my hair gets frizzy easily. Applying a few drops of this oil in my wet hair and blow drying the hair keeps it under control and shiny</li>
    <li> Wonderful Argan Oil with the purest certifications (most critical).&lt;br /&gt;Smooth and easy to put on.  The bottle and the accompanying bag&lt;br /&gt;were a great bonus with the purchase.  Very impressed with this&lt;br /&gt;company&#x27;s approach to forwarding such a critical oil for one&#x27;s&lt;br /&gt;cosmetic repertoire.  Will be part of my permanent cosmetic&lt;br /&gt;collection for both skin and hair.  Exceptional results.</li>
    <li> This came very fast. I use argan oil in my hair to help with split ends and frizz--I am going to try mixing this with some essential oils for a DIY better version of &amp;#34;Moroccanoil&amp;#34;. Tried this on my skin and it felt very soft and the oil was light and non-greasy, so I think I&#x27;ll try making some body moisturizer with it as well. Great product!</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing! This is why I like amazon...you can buy a product much cheaper than the store and works just as good. This stuff works just as well.  What I like is that it is a one hundred pure organic and cold pressed. It feels good to know that I am not smearing a bunch of potentially harmful chemicals on my skin. It lasted me about 3 months, cant stress enough the amount of value you get for such a great product. When I use it at night my skin is glowing in the morning. Recommending  this to all my friends. Thanks!</li>
    <li> This past winter was rough and it took it&#x27;s toll on my face as far as drying my skin out. A friend referred me and I must say, I applied this stuff daily and I never had anymore issues. Give it about a week and you will totally notice the benefits, my skin feels so much softer.</li>
    <li> when you reach thirties you start worrying about your skin more than anything. I have very sensitive skin that broke into a rash at the use of any new product. Finally somebody told me to switch to applying oil to the face. At first the ideas was very weird to me. But when I read about the advantages of argan oil over the net, I was very impressed. When I ordered this product for the first time I was very skeptical. But in a few days I realized its goodness and highly recommend it now. It left my skin soft n supple. My blemishes are becoming light and my hands have never felt so soft.</li>
    <li> This pure,organic argan oil is all I use any more: no need for moisturizer, hair treatment, cuticle softener, makeup remover - it&#x27;s light and easily absorbed, fragrance free, which I like, and a little goes a long way. My husband uses it as well.  Beware of other substances sold as argan oil, but which are really mixtures of a number of different products.</li>
    <li> Good quality in a huge quantity! Can&#x27;t beat that. Most argan oil only comes in a little bottle. I find one pump of this is perfect for my hair and I&#x27;ll add another pump to my face lotion, morning and night! Works perfectly.</li>
    <li> Really this product is fabulous!!! I found myself using Pura D&#x27;or Pure products a lot and had to pick this argan oil up. Argan oil is extremely beneficial to the body and this one has been my absolute favorite!! Its well worth the purchase and comes in a perfect concentrated amount that fit myself perfectly. Couldn&#x27;t be better!</li>
    <li> $25.00 for this product is a good deal and should be bought as soon as you see it. The reason for this is because I&#x27;ve seen Organic Argan Oil being a whole lot pricier than this prices (somewhere around the $70 + range). As for the product itself I truly love it. I love how this product maintains my health skin tones and it has helped reduce many brown spots that were on my face and arms from throughout the years. When I first put it on, it was weird because it was pretty cold, but after putting it on after days at a time I have gotten use to the feeling. I also have been putting this in my hair and although my hair was never brittle or weak to begin with, this product has made my hair a whole lot shinner and I no longer have to use hair products with added chemicals that do not promote hair growth anymore. It is a must by; organic based items are the best way to go and most beauty supply stores will not have.</li>
    <li> This is a great product because it can be used as a moisturizer, hair treatment, massage oil, and more. I really like having one product that I can use for all those things. As a moisturizer for dry skin it feels great because it&#x27;s not too oily. It also does a great job of smoothing out dry, frizzy hair and treating split ends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price is pretty good considering the size you get (4 oz.), and its versatility also makes it a really good buy. Whatever you use it for, you don&#x27;t need to use more than a few drops to get great results.</li>
    <li> I got tired of putting a bunch of stuff on my face and body that I couldn&#x27;t pronounce.  I just wanted something simple that didn&#x27;t leave my middle-age skin oily and with breakouts but worked well at hydrating.  I love this product.  After about a month, no breakouts, smooth skin, one ingredient.  I would like it better if the smell was more pleasant.  It&#x27;s not overpowering and goes away quickly, though, so worth it.</li>
    <li> I love how hydrated my hair and skin feel after using this. It soaks in fast so I don&#x27;t feel oily all day. My skin looks so much better after just a few days and my hair is shiny and healthy.</li>
    <li> Since it&#x27;s super hot this summer in CA, I swim around twice a day in my backyard. Chlorine damages hair, so when I get out of the shower I put a drop of this in my hair and it gets super soft. I also use it as an eyecream and an all around face moisturizer in the winter or just at night because it makes my face super shiny.</li>
    <li> Absolutely loved the oil.....I Live in the desert...which dries my skin immensely....this is the only oil that has kept my skin wonderfully soft.</li>
    <li> I have a lot of curly hair which is great some days, but I like to wear my hair straight also.  I was using olive oil for many years, but recently switched to Argan Oil.  What I do, when my hair is wet and freshly washed, I put some oil in my hands and rub them together and then smooth it into my hair.  How much oil depends on the individual person.  I don&#x27;t like my hair to look greasy and I&#x27;ve figured out how much I should use.  I either blow dry my hair by separating into sections or I let it air dry, either way it comes out the same. Then, I use a straight iron.  I love how my hair looks and the smell is amazing!  My daughter likes to keep her nose in next to me just to keep smelling the Aragan oil.</li>
    <li> Wonderful for hair and face.  Only need a few drops and I love that it is organic and all natural.</li>
    <li> Love this Argan Oil by Pua d&#x27;or! Use it to condition my hair and skin and it works wonders! Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> I can use it anywhere, for hair, for body moisture. It works especially good in winter. Love it.</li>
    <li> Very nice product, I used it on my face and it cleaned pores and made it feel smooth and hydrated. It also helped me with my hair and flakes, made my scalp hydrated and hair soft and smooth, very useful for me. Will recommend to any friends :) thanks plus it&#x27;s organic so no bad chemicals, all natural!</li>
    <li> I bought this to use as facial oil after reading about Argan oils healing qualities.  Prior to this product I was using castor oil on my face which I also liked, but this oil has replaced it completely.  I put it on at least once a day, sometimes twice using 2-3 squirts.  It is a wonderful oil that leaves my skin so silky smooth and soft.  I use oil and home made butter bars as lotion, so generally don&#x27;t mind or even notice anymore the &amp;#34;oily&amp;#34; feeling, to the point that I actually dislike traditional water based lotions.  However, this particular oil doesn&#x27;t feel like oil.  It really just leaves your skin super soft and satiny.  I really do love it!  It also helps heal my skin quickly if I have dry spots or pimples which I assume is because of the high vitamin E content.  I would highly recommend this oil to anyone and I plan to keep using it for years to come.</li>
    <li> I am using it for my acne and it is working! It is Good for my skin, face and hair! Excelent!</li>
    <li> This is such an amazing product. Have been using this for months now and could see good results...This product works wonders on dry frizzy hair making it soft n shiny all day..Highly recomended for damaged hair. Thankyou Amazon for helping me choosing the right product. The reviews helped me to shortlist this wonderful product.</li>
    <li> Real Argan Oil is as close to scentless as you can get.  This smelled like Pine Sol, so it&#x27;s not Argan Oil.  It didn&#x27;t absorb into my skin either. It left an oily coating that had to be wiped away after an hour.  What do they do, wait till the products have 5 star reviews, then start reducing the quality?  Read the dates of the reviews, not just the words.  Recent opinions have been similar to mine.  (Thanks to Amazon for the hassle free  return/refund.)</li>
    <li> I really like this product. I usually put it on my hair and my face. With my hair it makes it not puff up, which happens if I let my hair dry naturally by itself. I also use a little for flyways after I blow dry it.  When i use it for my face it absorbs in a few minutes and it makes it stay soft. Usually I have to use a few different creams a few times to not make my face dry up.</li>
    <li> Fast delivery. Great product, I originally bought the product for my hair since it needed a little extra care for the summer months but now I use it as a night moisturizer for my face and body. I&#x27;m very pleased with the results.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used oils in the past with better results.  I wasn&#x27;t too impressed with this product and would not make another purchase.</li>
    <li> My second bottle of this brand of argan oil. A little goes a very long way, and the oil stays fresh for ages. Feels beautiful on the skin. Works nicely in hair care concoctions!  UPDATE: April 2015. Just purchased another bottle. I had just finished the other bottle, which had stayed fresh for around a year.</li>
    <li> I suppose the real reason why I gave this 3 stars is because I am so disappointed in the smell. I have never been compelled to write a review before but I had high hopes for this brand. I lost faith in Watt&#x27;s and I can&#x27;t afford Josie Maran anymore. The only bottle I ever had that luxurious nutty smell with is one bottle of Watt&#x27;s. This Pura D&#x27;or bottle smells like olive oil, I am a little hesitant to even use it... some say it depends on the season the nut is harvested, but there is so much conflicting information out there it is tough to tell. All I know is that I was really excited about the smell, and I didn&#x27;t get it.</li>
    <li> It is the only beauty treatment I use now!  I put it on my face at night, I use it as a foundation in the morning, and I use it as a treatment for my dry, chemically treated hair.  Absolutely fabulous stuff!</li>
    <li> I kid you not this is the best stuff I have ever used to make the wrinkles go away!&lt;br /&gt;Also, after I would shower, I would put this Argan oil in my hair and the texture of my hair increased dramatically. The jel I use destroys my hair, but now that I use this, my hair feels nice again.&lt;br /&gt;All in All - This stuff has put years back on me (physically looking)&lt;br /&gt;Will continue to buy</li>
    <li> I bought this after it said that it was organic but it made my hair very sticky. I would recommend &amp;#34;Agadir Argan Oil Hair Treatment&amp;#34; which I felt it much better.</li>
    <li> Very nice addition to my routine.</li>
    <li> An amazing product! I&#x27;ve been using it on my skin and hair and can see and feel the difference that it makes. My skin is much softer and smoother after a week of using it. It also does wonders for the hair. Fair warning though - A little goes a long way. I have long thick hair and all I need is about 1-2 pumps of oil to cover all my hair. You just have to be sure to massage it thoroughly through your hair. Will definitely buy more!</li>
    <li> I have skin that is both oily and flakey. Or rather, I did have that skin. Somehow this Argan oil cured the flakiness and reduced the shine - a winning combination.</li>
    <li> This product is great! The oil is very moisturizing and requires you to use only a drop or two. I prefer it to Moroccan Oil brand it&#x27;s less diluted and it also has no perfume scent.</li>
    <li> This is the best ever!  It is multi purpose and is fantastic for everything.  I use it on children&#x27;s skin after the bath and on my face for my acne.  It is awesome.</li>
    <li> Love my argan oil.  It is now part of my daily skin care routine. Seals in the moisture, and plumps up the skin. Compared to Josie&#x27;s argan, you get twice the oil for half of the price in a 4-oz bottle.  That makes it 4 to 5 times cheaper.  The quality of this puador is very good.</li>
    <li> What I received was NOT real argan oil. It gave me a horrible rash on my jaw and neck and the worst breakout I&#x27;ve EVER had in my life. It took weeks for my skin to get back to normal. Thankfully, my money was refunded. BEWARE: if it&#x27;s a bargain that seems too good to be true, it probably is!</li>
    <li> I use this wonderful oil for both my hair and face.  It is so much better than using a conditioner on my hair or a moisturizer on my face.  The oil is instantly absorbed by my hair and skin.  I will continue to purchase this.  Each bottle, I am on my third, lasts a very long time as you only need one or two drops at a time.</li>
    <li> I love this oil. It is light, no fragrance and I love that it has a pump that dispenses just enough rather than spraying or pour where you may lose some of the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My package came very fast and the price was right!!!! I will be ordering again!</li>
    <li> I ordered this because of the good reviews that I have read from previous customers, and a lot of them said good things about it. I thought it was great that I stumbled upon this product since I&#x27;ve never heard anything about it before.&lt;br /&gt;So the moment, I received it..first thing I did was smell it. There was this kind of a minty smell on it. It kind of smell like a medicational stuff that came from my country but I ignored it. I used it on my face for a couple of weeks, (by the way I was no longer having acne by that time, I was acne-prone but it was cleared. I was just looking for a moisturizer that I could use for outdoors.)&lt;br /&gt;So on my first use, my observation are:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-it leaves a residue on my face&lt;br /&gt;-it&#x27;s looks greasy&lt;br /&gt;-doesn&#x27;t get absorbed really well&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But I ignored it since well, it is an OIL. I thought I&#x27;d give it like a month, but after a couple weeks of using it I decided to stop it because I was having ACNE. It felt like I was fooled, I wasted $40 on it and gave me acnes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, it got a water-like color which is weird because it&#x27;s came from a nut and they claimed it was 100% pure, shouldn&#x27;t it be like kind of a little brownish??&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also tried it on my hair after I gave up using it on my face, it gave the same result which is GREASY hair, and there&#x27;s still tangles on my hair. Seriously, what a waste of money!</li>
    <li> Based on the positive reviews, I decided to purchase this brand of argan oil to replace a more expensive brand I had been using. Upon using Pura D&#x27;or for the first time, I noticed a strong antiseptic odor, which made me suspicious that the product was NOT 100% pure argan oil. I contacted the company and the person with whom I spoke confirmed that they use tea trea oil and other \\&quot;things\\&quot; to \\&quot;sanitize\\&quot; batches.  I pointed out that if they are introducing tea tree oil or other items into the argan oil, it is no longer 100% pure argan oil. The individual with whom I spoke assured me that the product is 100% argan oil, but there is no way that a product which has such a strong medicinal, antiseptic smell is 100% argan oil.  I have used 100% pure deordorized organic argan oil in the past and the consistency was never as watery as Pura D&#x27;or&#x27;s product and there was never a medicinal, antiseptic odor.  Pura D&#x27;or is clearly misrepresenting the quality of its product. I will be going back to my previous brand of 100% pure argan oil. It may be more expensive than Pura D&#x27;or, but at least I can rest assured that it is 100% pure argan oil.</li>
    <li> I originally bought the argan oil for my hair, it does make my hair feel more smooth. Then I found out it makes a good moisturizer as well, now I just use it for my face, and I quite like it!!</li>
    <li> The argan oil itself is perfect! Great quality and consistency, and really makes my skin look and feel great. My only complaint, and the reason for 4 and not 5 stars, is the spray nozzle for dispensing. Perhaps I read the description incorrectly, but I thought the oil would be dispensed via a pump, similar to the pump toppers on lotion, and not by a spray top. I would have MUCH preferred a dropper, which is what most argan oil companies use, but I was willing to settle for a pump top. This spray top is really very annoying and I find myself removing the top to pour the oil into my hand, which I don&#x27;t think is the most sanitary way (even with clean hands) to dispense and keep oil, since inevitably, some of the oil that gets on my hands winds up back in the bottle. Both a dropper top and a pump top would prevent this.</li>
    <li> I am a senior with dry scalp. I highly recommend Purador Argan Oil. I used lotion on my scalp. The Purador Argan Oil is SO MUCH BETTER than the lotion.</li>
    <li> It decreased the fuzziness in my daughter&#x27;s hair and gave it a nice look. but it did not work well with my hair. So I will continue using it with her hair only.</li>
    <li> I am a bit worry to put oil on my face because I have acne so easy but this oil not make my face have acne and make my skin look. Love this oil!</li>
    <li> Initially I purchased this product to see if it would clear up the remaining results of a bad sun/wind burn. My nose was red and tender to the touch. After one application the tenderness was gone, after two the redness was gone. This oil seems to help clear up any blemish I get.  Also, frequently I&#x27;ll get an itch on random parts of my body, this argan oil eliminates the itch almost immediately. It&#x27;ll be interesting to see how it works with mosquito bites and earlier in sunburns this summer. I&#x27;ve used this as an after shave and it&#x27;s wonderful. Initially my skin looks shiny or oily but in a few minutes I rub my face again and all this disappears. One bad thing about using it as after shave is you will be touching your face all day because it feels so smooth and soft. I&#x27;ve also used it as a hair conditioner although, I noticed my hair feeling fuller I didn&#x27;t care for how it felt until I watched again. If someone is used to putting skin conditioner on their face or body daily, it would be interesting see how it works. I&#x27;m not interested enough in my looks to give this a go. It was delivered as promised and was packed extremely well. The bottle is larger than I expected and seems to last a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ok, for my complaint...the nozzle on the bottle is very small and early on I pumped the top and the nozzle was in the wrong place.</li>
    <li> I visited Morocco and learned about Argan oil and its uses.  I have a problem with frizzy hair and have found that pure argan oil is the best remedy for my hair.  Argan oil that you can buy in Morocco has a natural nutty type scent.  However, because Pura d&#x27;or is scentless, it is much nicer to use in my hair.  I  buy Pura d&#x27;or for a few reasons: 1.  reasonably priced; 2.  scentless and 3.  it is 100% argan oil, not an additive in some hair product.</li>
    <li> I love this oil - I switched to an all natural beauty routine and have been so happy using this oil as a leave in conditioner and then a light coat to tame frizzies. My hair has never been happier or healthier and I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s largely impart to this product. Start sparingly and add little by little. The first time I used this, I put too much in my hair and it looked more oily than before I washed it. Overall, definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> This is a great product.  I have read a lot about the healing qualities of argan oil,&lt;br /&gt;and chose it to help heal my scars from skin cancer (Google it and see for yourself!).&lt;br /&gt;It seems to speed the healing of the nitrous blisters, and makes my skin smooth.&lt;br /&gt;I also use it morning and night on my face.  It doesn&#x27;t take much - spreads nicely and&lt;br /&gt;seems to absorb into the skin well.  Thank you Pura D&#x27;or for a great oil!</li>
    <li> I use this oil for my face, skin and the ends of my hair.  I love how my skin feels afterwards and even my hair is smoother.  I have very thick and coarse hair and I like how it keeps it tamer and moisturized.  I pat this on my face and my skin feels very soft afterwards.</li>
    <li> It came as described.  Keeps the hair hydrated and seems to make it really healthy and shiny.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my hair, which recently endured two bleachings and two dye-ings in two days. It&#x27;s okay - but a prior treatment of coconut oil made a much bigger difference in softness and shine, so I suspect that coconut oil is actually better for my hair (and it costs a lot less).  I used this also on my face. At first I broke out, but now my face seems to like it. Skin is very soft and smooth, and some enlarged pores are no longer visible.  EDIT - I changed this from 4 stars to 5. My skin really loves it (face). Still using coconut oil for hair, though.</li>
    <li> I have been using this Argan Oil for three months and I must say it is the best oil for my curly gray hair.  My curls are soft and shiny and I couldn&#x27;t be happier with my hair.  i have also used this oil on my skin and while it has made my skin softer, it did take a while longer to notice results on my face and hands than it did for me to see results on my hair.  I would recommend to a friend and will purchase again.</li>
    <li> I have dry skin and hair and this product does a great job moisturizing both without leaving an oily feeling. I also love that it&#x27;s organic and doesn&#x27;t contain any added chemicals. I put it on my face at night after washing and in my hair after towel drying, though you can even use a bit to tame unruly frizz once hair is dry. Highly recommend this argan oil!</li>
    <li> Great stuff. All natural ingredients, no added fragrances. The only oil that seems to really enter my fair shafts for instant moisturizing. The only thing I would warn about is the smell, especially if you don&#x27;t let it dry afterwards it could be a little bothersome. Other than that its a great product :)</li>
    <li> Pura D&#x27;or Pure and Organic Argan Oil, Brown and Gold, 4 Fluid Ounce is a definite keeper!  This is a re-purchase.  I was half way through my first bottle and wanted to be sure to have more on hand.  I use it on my face, hair and anywhere else that needs moisturizing.  One squirt takes care of the face and neck, then I run my hands over my dampened hair.  I have noticed a difference in the wrinkles around my eyes and mouth the most.  They are less distinct and appear to fewer in number.  I used morning and night for a couple months and now just in the morning, after showering.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My Amazon Prime and UPS delivered on time and in perfect condition.  I recommend this product to anyone wishing to quench the thirst of their skin while helping to minimize the wrinkles.</li>
    <li> Good quality product arrived promptly</li>
    <li> I received a bottle of this as a gift.  I love it!!  It never leaves a greasy feeling.  Goes on smooth and silky.  My hands and feet have never looked or felt better  Would highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I have pretty sensitive redhead skin, which is now dry due to the desert climate I live in. I&#x27;ve try almost everything, so I was truly skeptical that any product could be natural/organic AND moisturize well, but I&#x27;m very impressed with this oil. It helps keep my skin balanced in a dry climate, and  doesn&#x27;t make me break out. I find myself reaching for this over all other moisturizers in my cabinet. Great price point, too. I&#x27;m now looking at the other products in their line.</li>
    <li> Love this product , I use it on my face hair and body .</li>
    <li> My husband has really dry spots on his checks and after trying many products this did the trick.  My gray hair is bleached blond which dries it out a lot then add that I am in the sun a lot.  I use it in my hair at night and it has made a huge difference in fighting off the dryness.</li>
    <li> I love this product!  It&#x27;s not oily at all and really feels great on my skin.  I love in a very dry climate (Colorado!) and use this product daily on my face and hands.</li>
    <li> odorless, smooth, great for the hair, a little grerasy onto the face</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing! I have curly frizzy hair and this the only thing I put on it in the mornings and I have soft shiny hair all day!</li>
    <li> High quality product at a fraction of the price of some brands.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a fan of Josie Maran but this is a quarter if the price so I HAD to try it. I was fully prepared to send it back but no need. This stuff is a perfect replacement and works and feels exactly like the higher priced Josie Maran oil.  I only use on my skin so I can&#x27;t comment on hair, but this works exactly as I had expected.  Will definitely purchase again!!!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s been 2 weeks since I got this Arian oil. It  really helps me keep my hand moisture. I suffer from eczema and I have a super dry sensitive skin and this really helps me a lot.and me my daughter use it also. Unto our hair and it make it so soft!</li>
    <li> completely transformed my skin. I use 2 pumps before and after showering. It doesn&#x27;t leave my face greasy like jojoba oil. Highly recommended to anyone who has acne.</li>
    <li> I have order other brands of Argan  oil. I have found that Argan oils are not the same.  Pura d&#x27;or Argan oil has no foul smell and does not aggravate my skin like other brands have. I use it on my entire body and hair. It also is an excellent cuticle oil.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve seen amazing results with my hair and skin since using this oil!</li>
    <li> So far I have been adding this to my special coconut oil that I use as a body and hair conditioners .. I&#x27;ve only used Argan Oil for a few months so I only have a very basic knowledge .. but I am enjoying the product and today tried using it straight on my hands because of the weather change they&#x27;ve dried quite a bit, I used it about 4 hours ago and my hands are still glowing and show no signs of cracks.</li>
    <li> This is the best argan oil which I ever used! This product keep moisture my skin and hair and the cost is good performance.</li>
    <li> The price was right much better than others..  I use argan oil but have just started using this brand so far so good.</li>
    <li> My son is very pleased with this product. He was having a terrible time with keeping his hair in place - and refused to use products that dried his hair out. His hair stylist suggested Argan Oil. She said that they recommended it to people all the time. He uses it daily, and his hair looks fantastic! It only takes a very small amount. He is using about a pea sized amount - or less. A little more gives the hair a wet look. My son has a very short, classic cut. It also moisturizes the hair, and it looks much shinier than it did with other products. This product is well worth the money - - - in my opinion!</li>
    <li> Received this product in a timely manner and have been using it daily since then. Love the way this argan oil is absorbed quickly and completely into my skin. As a result my skin is looking softer and more radiant.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a natural product junkie, and I typically search for hair products that works wonders, are natural, and affordable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First off, this product is completely affordable. Natural products have a notion to be very expensive, I was pleasantly surprised and happy that an organic product could be sold at such a reasonable cost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Secondly, this product is completely organic. It is verified by the USDA. It is a proven fact for natural/ organic products to be  healthier and more environmentally friendly. Organic products work great in the hair, and this product didn&#x27;t leave me with any regrets.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lastly and most importantly, within a week of using this product, my hair was shinier and felt more moisturized. I suffer from dry hair, and an itchy scalp. The argan oil worked wonders. My scalp is no longer dry, which was causing the itchiness in the first place. Also, my hair is shinier. There is no greasy build-up which goes to show that my hair is actually maintaining the moisture versus it sitting right on top of my head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I definitely recommend this product for everyone trying to achieve more manageable, shinier, and healthier hair. It&#x27;s an added bonus that this product is natural as well!</li>
    <li> Made me break out horribly with cystic acne. I have never had such horrible acne! It all began to heal once I stopped using the Argan Oil.</li>
    <li> This stuff is really great! I have tried everything to get my straight, lengthy (medium) hair to a better status (status which would satisfy my wish), but nothing did work for me except making it worse and I found that most of those products were not worth even for the price.&lt;br /&gt;When I came across Pura D&#x27;or, suddenly a single drop of argan oil changed my life!! Really it did! It will really make your hair nourishing and smooth. It really did transform my hair and I felt like receiving something which I really missed for my head for a long time.&lt;br /&gt;The best thing is you can use it even on your face and skin. With the confident from using it on my hair I tried it first with a drop of oil on my hands which used to be really dry most of the times. Again WOW!! This is what I have to tell.This is really an awesome product with multiple uses and the best thing is it’s affordable.&lt;br /&gt;I will recommend this product to anyone wishing to achieve a glowing skin with healthy and nourishing hair. I am really satisfied with this product and will definitely use it like forever!! Love this product..</li>
    <li> Recent operations left me with many scars.  I have been using oil on scars and they are starting to lighten</li>
    <li> I bought this to use in my hair and I have only used the product a couple times but I love it! My hair is super soft, shiny and smooth. I would Highly recommend! I might just try using on my skin!!</li>
    <li> I love this stuff!  I wish I could&#x27;ve purchased a liter, because it has so many uses. I use it on my nails before I go to bed, under my night cream, on my elbows, mixed with my lotion and my facial moisturizer and on my feet at night.  Also, I like to use it on my hair before I wash it, as a treatment.  This stuff is amazing!  I&#x27;m ordering another bottle, so I don&#x27;t run out. Check it out!  You will not be disappointed and you&#x27;ll thank me later. There are other products out there, but not like this. Also, I add a few drops to my conditioner and my hair even looks healthier.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for a few weeks and while I like the feel of my skin when I use it, I am not sure it&#x27;s causing my breakouts.  I rarely get acne but since i have been using this, I have been getting a few.  I am going to reduce my use of it in the coming weeks and see it if make a difference.  I use on my nails and do not notice any change, they are still a bit brittle.  I also use it on my hair and must say, I much prefer coconut oil.  This does have a bit of a stinky smell but I use it when I am at home so I don&#x27;t mind - the smell also goes away once you have it on or maybe you get used to it by then.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using coconut oil on my hair for years to combat dryness and frizz. With all the hype about argan oil I thought I&#x27;d give this a try. It worked OK on hair but I didn&#x27;t see much difference between this and coconut oil. I also used it on my face and hands and it works better for skin. It left my skin hydrated but not greasy.</li>
    <li> After searching for vitamin e oil I stumbled upon Pura d&#x60;or Argon oil. For several months I used this and started noticing my hands and feet were soft and callous skin was going away. I also use some on my face after I wash and I can immediately re-moisturizing my skin. It makes my face look healthy. Its odorless and sells for a great price. Bottle is made of glass and comes with a quality pump dispenser. This is my go to when it comes to a good quality argon oil.</li>
    <li> Fantastic amber bottle to preserve the oil inside. Additionally, the oil itself is of very high quality and great for the beard oil and beard balm I purchased it for. Ordered Thursday, arrived Saturday, good hustle! The linen bag it arrives in is a cute touch also!</li>
    <li> awesome quality argan oil, makes my skin soft and smooth, I even apply this oil to my 7 weeks old baby, his dry patches disappeared after one application.  Going to order another one for my mom. This oil keeps healthy skin for the entire family. Love it!</li>
    <li> The best thing about this Argan Oil by Pura d&#x27;or is that it doesn&#x27;t have bad ingredients in it.  It has no parabens or parrafin or any of the things you will find in most anti-aging creams and lotions.  It goes on like silk and honestly is making me look younger and much more radiant.  I get compliments every day on my skin which never happened before using this product. Very pleased for sure.</li>
    <li> I Love this Argan Oil to use in place of a night cream. It doesn&#x27;t leave your face feeling oily and is great for moisturizing. I use every night and have noticed that my skin feels much softer and appears to be clearer and more even in skin tone. I would recommend this to anyone looking for a good moisturizer that doesn&#x27;t have any chemicals</li>
    <li> I was immediately skeptical when I opened the bottle. Pure ARGAN oil does NOT smell faintly like Tea tree oil or eucalyptus oil. It is also very heavy. Funny you can&#x27;t contact the company or get a reply to dispute it.</li>
    <li> I have been using Pura d&#x27;or 100% Pure Organic Argan oil for about 6 months. I was skeptic when a friend first introduced to me. This Argan oil is not sticky at all. Very comfortable and I use it early in the morning and at night before going to bed. The weather in my area is very dry and this argan oil is a very good moisturizer. I definitely recommend this product to anyone. Most important this product is 100% organic, which is better than any other moisturizer chemical products in the market. Although there are claims about anti-aging but I can’t really say it does as I can’t tell the different. Perhaps if I continue using this for few years, I might see the different. The only thing I do not like about this product is the pricing. For the last 6 months, I have bought 4 bottles. This is not cheap. I would hope there is a package deal where the price is more reasonable if buying more than 3 bottles.</li>
    <li> This argan oil was sent to me as a gift. I used it as a moisturizer and occasionally on the tips of my hair. After leaving it on overnight, my skin felt and looked softer. I also like to pat some on after I apply makeup to melt it into my skin. The quality is comparable to Jose Maran&#x27;s products. I would highly recommend this product as an environmentally conscious alternative to traditional creams. Because it&#x27;s pure argan oil, I don&#x27;t have to worry about harmful preservatives or fillers.</li>
    <li> Bought for my mom, she loves it! Thank you very much. Not smelly, great for hair and face and anywhere on your body..</li>
    <li> I spent until my mid 20s fighting with my skin: dryness, flaking, eczema on my arms, acne, and facial redness (especially around my nose). I had been researching the idea of non-chemical skin care and Organic Pura d&#x27;or Argan Oil had been highly recommended for all skin and hair types. I was leery at first about putting oil on my fair skin because I didn&#x27;t want to look like an oily mess but my reaction was the exact opposite. Since using this product the past 6 months all of my skin issues have cleared. I wash my face nightly using this and every morning I wake up with my skin glowing and feeling refreshed. Since going non-chemical with all of my beauty and body care products I have been free of hard and dry patches of skin on my arms and my hair looks healthier than ever.  The bonus about this product is that the initial cost might seem steep but it lasts forever so I am saving money by not buying all of the corporate chemical products that are soaking toxins into my skin. Make sure you buy USDA Certified Organic 100% Argan Oil in a dark brown bottle. There are many knock offs and you want to make sure your skin is getting the full benefits. Pura d&#x27;or is the way to go; I will continue buying this product and recommending it to others.</li>
    <li> Great product. I use it straight up in my hair, and also as a key ingredient in a beard conditioner that I make myself at home. Absorbs right into hair, no oily or greasy residue. I have grey hair, and this helps keep it soft.</li>
    <li> Excellent service and nice product!!</li>
    <li> Hi my name is Brenda, I am a black woman with very course natural hair.  Once I wash my hair and flat iron it, it can be very hard to maintain with the dry summer months in Arizona.  Arizona has little to no moisture in the air.  Once I received my product I started using it on my hair and on the ends of my hair.  What a big difference!  My hair is softer not greasy but extremely moist.  I love the fact I can use this on my face and not have to use any other moisturizer.  It&#x27;s so true that you can use it after your bath or shower.  It keeps the skin truly moist.  I like the fact that it has a natural scent.  I love my Pura d&#x27;or 100% Pure &amp; USDA Organic Argan oil.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s amazing product works like magic. Worth your money</li>
    <li> is great i used as a leaving on my hair and my hair is always shine and help with my hair fall!</li>
    <li> Within the first day of using this as a nighttime moisturizer, my pores were noticeably smaller and my skin softer. I was hoping it would clear my skin up a little more than it has, but hopefully the longer I use it, the more benefits I will see. Overall, this is one of the best argan oils I&#x27;ve tried. I will definitely be purchasing it again and would recommend it to anyone looking for something new to try.</li>
    <li> I discovered Argan oil by accident and then someone told me about Purad&#x27;or. I can honestly say this oil is amazing. My eyelids get dry/itchy during winter and I used to apply different creams to soothe the sensitive skin. None of them worked or worked for a little while. Purad&#x27;or has curerd it!!!. I use it for my face and hair and so does the rest of my family. I no longer buy other creams for face. USDA organiccertificaton adds the trust that makes it even better.</li>
    <li> Good to take it! I use it regularly. I think it is doing its job. The bottle is handy. I will recommend it.</li>
    <li> I really don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s doing any good for me. I&#x27;ve been using it for a few months. I put it on my face. It&#x27;s nice but i Haven&#x27;t noticed any difference. It soaks in right away. I don&#x27;t know if I will order it again. Pretty expensive. I still have a lot left, so will decide then!! Hope that helps.</li>
    <li> I use it on my daugter&#x27;s hair befor swim, it works pretty good,better than shamp poo for swimming kids! love it!</li>
    <li> This product was amazing started using at 5 months when my skin started to feel itchy.  Argan oil that absorbs well into skin. Use right after shower while skin is soft to lock in moisture for better results. Can be used alone or with favorite body cream or lotion for severely dry skin. It really is a great product compared to other body oils.</li>
    <li> Wow... Super fast shipping. Great product.</li>
    <li> this stuff is amazing. i have mild acne and i use this every morning and it helps with it so much. i also use this on the ends of my hair after i get out of the shower and makes it super soft!</li>
    <li> Great product at a great price.  Very easy to apply with spritzer and works wonders on your skin.</li>
    <li> First impression: ok so I has been looking at argan for a while. And we know like most if not beauty oils, once it catches on EVERYTHING contains it. But it&#x27;s not pure, it&#x27;s diluted and filled with chemicals. There&#x27;s another popular beauty brand that says it contains 100% argan oil but it&#x27;s expensive. I looked and a 4 ounce bottle of that brand (which is the largest size they make) is $96. Sooo $20 or $96, you decide. Lol so from first impressions, it goes on very nicely. I heard it&#x27;s good for dark circles so I used it on my eyes and normally get a stinging feeling when I use new stuff around my eyes bc it&#x27;s sensitive BUT this was awesome..no sting. The skin around my eyes feel very soft and supple and not dry. I&#x27;ll give another review in a few weeks..let you know how this works out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 7/4/15 ok so it&#x27;s only been a few days but I can tell this is my new favorite product. In the morning after washing my face and using toner, I use this as a serum. I mix a little with my eye cream and use it around my eyes before waiting 5 minutes or so to apply acne cream and then a day cream with spf. My skin has a glow. At night...cleanse, tone, serum, retin-a. I noticed that this helps the retin-a be more effective since sometimes it can be drying. I washed my face 4 hours ago and it still as feels soft and supple as when I applied the oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 2 7/30/15 ok so I&#x27;ve been using this for about a month now and these little lines that I started to notice under my eyes are becoming less apparent. Sometimes I&#x27;m too tired to go through my entire night time routine so I will quickly wash my face, spritz with thermal spring water and dab 1 or 2 drops of this on my face. When I wake up in the morning my skin is soft and supple.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also I&#x27;ve tried this on other parts of my body. It makes a nice cuticle oil and it&#x27;s nice to mix with some brown sugar and olive oil for a lip scrub or even with your regular lip balm and it gives just a touch of shine..not greasy looking lips but nice kissable lips. Every now and then I will put some through my scalp and hair and it&#x27;s a little softer but I also have psoriasis so I may not be the best person to ask about argan oil and hair. I&#x27;ve mixed a little with my regular lotion and the lotions seems to soak into my skin quickly and my skin stays more hydrated.asy looking lips but nice kissable lips. Every now and then I will put some through my scalp and hair and it&#x27;s a little softer but I also have psoriasis so I may not be the best person to ask about argan oil and hair. I&#x27;ve mixed a little with my regular lotion and the lotions seems to soak into my skin quickly and my skin stays more hydrated.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff... I use it everyday on my face, neck and chest. I have sensitive skin--rosacea type, and this product has really helped to calm my skin and eliminate dryness. The bottle lasts forever, the oil is pure-- great for those of us who avoid chemical based products due to skin sensitivity. I even put some on my fine hair ends, improving the appearance and color. I have recommended this product to friends. It is a one-stop product, eliminating the need for multiple jars of beauty products. It does it all.</li>
    <li> I have been using Pura D&#x27;Or for about two weeks now. Since I live in South Florida and do water aerobics 3-4 days a week, I was looking for something that would keep the sun and chlorine from drying out my skin while not being greasy in the summer humidity.  Pura D&#x27;Or really seems to do the trick! It absorbs easily and does not cause breakouts. My face and hands are softer and my fingernails / cuticles look much better. I don&#x27;t know how it would be for someone with oily skin, but it works well for me and I love using something that does not have loads of chemicals in the ingredient list. Thanks for a great product!</li>
    <li> The Argan oil has been an amazing mositurizer for my skin.Awesome product not too greasy.</li>
    <li> I looked into Josie Maran and this product and decided to go with this based on price and reviews and I am so happy I did. I have noticed a difference in the fine lines on my face. LOVE it!</li>
    <li> Great product. I&#x27;ve already ordered this two times. I use it on my face and my wet hair after showering and have noticed my skin and hair are smoother since I&#x27;ve started this product. You only need a small amount, so the bottle goes a long way. I have oily skin, so was worried about adding more oil to my face, but my skin absorbs it immediately. I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Love this product! They have a conditioner but I don&#x27;t see the need for it! It has been months since I got my hair cut. But the ends feel really good! No splitting! And NO SHEDDING! My hair feel so soft! And no frizziness!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the pump action as I get just the right amount each time. There is a slight smell of black pepper when I&#x27;m washing my hair but no lasting smell of any kind once rinsed with clear water. My hair smells like hair. Were I at home, I&#x27;d add lemon juice to the rinse water or some herb I like. Maybe not. This way, the smell of my hair does not complete with my perfume.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will I reorder this, you bet! But with the size of the bottle and the amount of soap I use, I think it will be quite some time before I need to reorder. Oh yes, this is an excellent product with good value for the money!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the argan oil on my skin along with coconut oil.  I find the argan oil works well on the problem areas like my elbows.  It is thicker than the coconut oil and does a great job moisturizing.  I&#x27;ve been using it mostly on my neck which gets dry and itchy in the summer.  I also use it on my bikini line after shaving and have had no issues with razor burn since I started using it.  It is a little too thick for my face, especially in the summer.  I have sensitive skin and have had no adverse reactions to this oil.  I have a feeling I will be using it a lot more in the winter when my hands tend to get very dry.  It&#x27;s  a great product and I love that it is all natural!</li>
    <li> I ordered a bottle of this oil in December 2014. My hair is short &amp; very dry. First, I was afraid to buy it because I thought it would make my hair oily. But I decided to give it a chance &amp; I didn&#x27;t regret it. I used it in two ways: Sometimes I use it instead of the conditioner. When I wash my hair, I put a little shampoo and mix it with the oil and leave it for few minutes before I rinse it. It keeps my hair moisturized. And sometimes  I use it as a normal serum. It works very well on my dry hair. Itt gives my hair a natural softness &amp; a shiny look. Also, the bottle seems small but I&#x27;m using it since December.</li>
    <li> This is absolutely divine! &amp;#34;Liquid gold&amp;#34; is the perfect description for this product!  I had previously used tea tree oil to treat cystic acne, but it would burn my skin and cause serious dry patches. This treats the swelling of the cysts and it is gloriously moisturizing with being too greasy. I absolutely love it for my dry elbows and heels, too. What a wonderful product! I use one n only argan oil spray on my hair, but I may switch to using this exclusively because it is superior and pure.</li>
    <li> Been using the oil for nearly three months and my skin looks flawless! No dry spots, my skin looks dewy, my pores look tiny and I&#x27;ve been getting compliments on how great my skin looks. Plus I checked my bottle and It&#x27;s like 3/4 full and I&#x27;ve been using it twice a day since I&#x27;ve bought it. I also use it on my hair and it has stopped frizzing! Cannot say enough good things about it!</li>
    <li> I adore this argan oil! I have ordered it multiple times now and will keep doing so. You can&#x27;t beat the price and quality! I use this on both my hair and face, and you can definitely tell a nice difference.  I highly recommended this oil!</li>
    <li> Makes my skin and hair soft. Where has this product been all my life?!</li>
    <li> Decided to give this a try because of the rave reviews and was super excited when it arrived, only to find out the bottle was leaking oil!  Am definitely not thrill about that. At first, I thought the bottle was damaged in the result of transit. Turns out the pump was not tightly sealed and the oil leaks through the brown paper and the pouch it came in. Does anyone have this experience? I just have a hunch that this product could be a return from someone else. I mean why wasn&#x27;t it properly sealed? I give it a 3 stars for that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have yet to try this product, I hope I will not be further disappoint.</li>
    <li> I return it as soon as it arrived. The bottle wasn&#x27;t full, the security seal was cut in half and it came of just by pushing it very gently.  I was so excited to get it.</li>
    <li> I like this product, it makes your hair very shiny. It took some adjusting to get the amount right, use very little otherwise your hair can look greasy.</li>
    <li> I have used argan oil for years, and it honestly is a superior oil for skin. This thoroughly moisturizes without any greasiness and my very sensitive, acne-prone skin glows when I&#x27;m using it. What made this particular product stand out to me was the bottle. I love the pump!! I love love love not having to contaminate my product every time I use it like I&#x27;ve had to with every other brand. Droppers and open tops just let in dust and bacteria. Another reason Pura d&#x27;or is awesome is the price point: I&#x27;ve been spending more than twice as much for argan oil at my local health market, and this one is higher in quality in my opinion. I&#x27;m so glad I purchased!</li>
    <li> First time users....and still waiting for the progress. Hopefully, it can be seen the difference as soon as I wish</li>
    <li> So far the product has been great, I&#x27;m using it on my hair and my hair is healthier.</li>
    <li> First of all, this bottle is extremely fragile!  It arrived cracked in half, in a plastic bag, but still leaking all over the box.  Bummer!  I was able to salvage about a tbsp of oil, and from what I can tell it performs just as well as any other argan oil but WITHOUT the smell.  My other brand of argan oil has a very unpleasant stomach acidy smell that disappears after it is applied, and it so nice to not have to hold my breath while I apply this.</li>
    <li> Using the tiniest bit tends to straighten my hair. I prefer my hair bouncy. I may use this on my body rather than my hair.</li>
    <li> Maybe I got a rancid bottle, but this oil smells like a barn that was mucked out a couple days ago.  Not completely disgusting, but certainly not a smell you want on your skin.  I am recovering from some second degree burns, so use it on the area that needs improvement, and immediately spraying some cologne afterwards so I don&#x27;t have to smell it.  The smell does fade after 5 minutes, and the oil is improving the look of my burns.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kudos to the distributor, I ordered on Saturday and it arrived on Sunday from another state.</li>
    <li> It works great.  Use it daily on my hair and makes my hair feel soft. I would definitely buy it again.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t smell bad, makes hair and skin smooth... Also comes with a pump :-) I tried poppy Austin but it smelled terrible!!!!! The oil was the same as this but this one actually smells nice. I returned poppy Austin and got this one :-)</li>
    <li> I got this as a present from my mom and I feel working already! My skin was so much softer and smoother afterwards and I felt like my hair was being nourished since it gets really dry during summer! I like this product a lot so far and I love that its organic! def recommend :)</li>
    <li> I love this oil! I have been looking for a good company that would sell pure Argan Oil, and this is the best one I have tried so far. I like the fact that it is cold pressed and and USDA certified. Also, it fits all the Argan oil criteria - it has a slight nutty smell, it is not transparent, and it works wonderfully! As for the healing and moisturizing effects, I am satisfied. I have skin that is prone to acne and I always have breakouts if I use oils as moisturizers, but this is an exception! It feels oily in the beginning, but gets absorbed very quickly and leaves the face very smooth. I am very satisfied with this product!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried many products over the years for various skin conditions. One of the most hated conditions I have is scaring and having scars that seem to steal the spotlight whenever I get into a swimsuit. I decided to try this after a friend recommended it to me and so far I&#x27;m having great results. The scars have not gone away mind you, but they are much less noticeable now. It also leaves me with a good moist feeling on my skin. However, it doesn&#x27;t feel slick and oily but rather moist like if you had applied a lotion rather than oil. It&#x27;s a great product that has really helped me feel better and look better.</li>
    <li> I bought this Argan Oil and did not have the benefits are a real Argan Oil. It is mixed with something else, Don&#x27;t waste your money on this brand!</li>
    <li> This product by far is one of the most successful purchase I have ever made. I am so happy with my purchase.&lt;br /&gt;I have been hearing about the benefits of Aragon Oil, But I never tried, I saw it in my hair salon, my hair dresser kept telling me about it how wonderful it is, how almost all of her clients use it and how my hair will look like after I use it. But honestly the price was like triple the price here so I didn&#x27;t buy it, I googled it and I found it here on amazon for much cheaper. I took the risk and purchase because of what I heard, the price and I felt safe because it is USDA certified so if it doesn&#x27;t improve my hair it will not have any negative impact on it and I will just lose my money, not my hair. I though the bottle will not last long because I have such a long hair and my daughters too, But you really need a small amount to apply on even a very long hair and you get an amazing result. For me, it is a big plus to be unscented because I have problem with most of the scented hair products.&lt;br /&gt;It made my daughters hair look shiny and so easy to comb with no complaining at all. for me I feel great because I never saw my hair so healthy with no  damaged ends, no frizz and no greasy look . My hair look so natural and healthy. You&#x27;ll not need any other hair products beside this one.&lt;br /&gt;I am glad I took the risk because if I didn&#x27;t I would lose the feeling i have right now with my hair.&lt;br /&gt;I tried it on my skin too, I feel so soft and moisture.</li>
    <li> I use this as the base in my homemade face moisturizer. I love how soft it makes my face feel, and it doesn&#x27;t make it feel oily or gross at all. I recommend it for dry or damaged hair as well. Plus the price for how much oil you&#x27;re getting is the best I&#x27;ve seen.</li>
    <li> I started using this product from last one week and i can see the change. It&#x27;s a great product. One star less for the high price</li>
    <li> Exactly what I ordered and I like the  push top dispenser much better than using an eye dropper.  Thank you.</li>
    <li> In November, December and January my hands get very dry and my hands always break out by splitting at the tips of my fingers.  Since using this product (I am on my third bottle) this has eliminated 99% of my problem.  I like this product!</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t see any difference in skin condition/appearance. I have been applying it generously day and night for a month now.</li>
    <li> My hair is shinier, my scalp is less dry and that makes my hair much healthier. Great product and excellent service.</li>
    <li> Received this about a month ago.  Love the way it makes my face feel without feeling greasy.  Such a good purchase.  Recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I have used other argon oils in the past and this , by far, is my favorite. It has a clean smell and a little seems to go a very long way.&lt;br /&gt;The softness of my skin and hair ends have been amazing...I have dry skin even in the summer as I love being outdoors.&lt;br /&gt;This product has really made my skin smooth and seems to last a long time. I have been using it for a month.&lt;br /&gt;Love it and not going back...</li>
    <li> Great for hair and skin. Works well for acne prone skin(if dry).</li>
    <li> Love Love Love this product! Super moisturizing and silky feel.  Does not make me break out when used on face and leaves my hair feel silky smooth!! Definitely recommend to others looking for something that works and is all natural!!</li>
    <li> This product has done wonders for my hands, cuticles, and nails.  I just moved back to the Midwest this past fall, and the winter season has taken a toll on my hands.  I&#x27;ve tried numerous lotions, and nothing has worked.  This stuff does the trick.  And the fragrance is very mild, and dissipates almost immediately after applying to your skin.</li>
    <li> Love this argan oil.  Been using it for over 6 months.  I use it on my skin and face.  Wrinkles and spots have decreased.  Old scars have faded.  My skin is no longer dry.  This is the only moisturizer I use now.  Regular moisturizers would cause rashes.  My skin has never looked better.</li>
    <li> This product immediately makes my hair feel softer and healthier</li>
    <li> Awesome product. Cleared up dry skin and acne.</li>
    <li> I have been using this on my face now for a few weeks and like the way my face feels.  It leaves my skin soft.  I plan to continue using this in place of a cream moisturizer.</li>
    <li> I use this product on my face and it is great! It moisturizes, without being oily. Just let it soak in and your skin will feel much softer. I have acne prone skin and wouldn&#x27;t have ever thought to use oil on my face, but it really make a difference and it seems to help heal any blemishes I have too.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using a more expensive brand for years so I decided to try this brand for the savings.  I like it.  This oil performs the same as the more expensive brand.  The sent is different, but fine as it it.  I prefer the dropper applicator to this pump style so I saved my current bottle for use with Pura d&#x27;or refills.  That is personal preference so you may prefer the pump action.  All in all well worth the price.  Argon oil is my favorite moisturizer.</li>
    <li> Makes your skin feel wonderful. I like this.</li>
    <li> I love it. I bought this for my mom and myself. This oil very good for face and dry skin. My mom use 1 wk she said  her skin very smooth and bright. My mom love it. I have dry skin on my leg I try to use on my leg. I am very surprised this oil it work very good on my dry and itching skin problem. Thanks parador company. I will tell my family and friend about this product. It is very good deal and the main thing this product it very very good for any type of skin. Thanks again</li>
    <li> Love this Argon Oil.  I used it as a facial moisturizer, and right away I noticed smoother skin.  An unexpected benefit was the eczema on my hands also cleared up, since I rubbed it into my hands after applying to my face.  After using a few months, I started adding some Plant Therapy &amp;#34;Soft Skin&amp;#34; essential oil to it.  I noticed even more improvement to my skin.</li>
    <li> I have thick frizzy hair that gets very dry at the ends so I use it for that but it does not seem to be doing anything for my skin. I&#x27;ve tried many different oils for hair and skin but I&#x27;m still searching for the perfect one. So far olive oil is what I always go back to as a face oil. Argan is ok for my hair but it is a bit pricey.</li>
    <li> Excellent Product, really helped my look amazing and healthy.</li>
    <li> Using this over the anti-aging serum and before the daily moisturizer.  It really helps keep moisture on my face all day.</li>
    <li> I use the Moroccan Oil brand and it smells great but doesn&#x27;t work half as well as this one! If you&#x27;re looking to buy essential oils I highly recommend cold-pressed and going organic. Buy this one and you won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this Aegean oil for about two weeks. I can see an improvement in my skin and an old surgery scar</li>
    <li> The Argan Oil smells good but is a little difficult to absorb. From what I know and used before the Oil should be absorbed by your skin very quickly - just rub between your hands and pat down and its gone. This one takes a few seconds longer (probably 15 - 20 second) to absorb. But for the price i would say its not bad</li>
    <li> This oil is great- I use it on my hair and face and it does what argan oil does. I don&#x27;t like the dispenser, though. If I want to add a drop to my under eye area it&#x27;s hard to just get a drop rather than a whole squirt. I definitely prefer the dropper style dispensers.</li>
    <li> I like the product. use it constantly would give or feel better on ur hair texture.</li>
    <li> I just received my second bottle of this oil...I use it in my face oil that I make to combat dry and wrinkled skin.. It is a high quality oil that is light and feels like silk on my skin...I also use it on my hair and nails and it is fabulous. I recommend this oil for use with you essential oils...you will not be disappointed.</li>
    <li> She was complaining about dry skin on her elbows and shins area. So being a great boyfriend as I am :) bought this for her. She loved it. Said it also felt amazing on her skin. Would use some moisturizing lotion then message this in for 5-10 minutes. Though lotion not needed at all!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommend for any guys looking to buy a gift for their girlfriend. 10/10</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d been looking for an organic solution and stumbled upon this one, and couldn&#x27;t be happier. Skin has regained a youthful appearance (no mean trick!) and I love the way it makes my face feel. I&#x27;m sold!</li>
    <li> Organic Argan Oil has always been an all time favorite for me and my extremely dry skin. Overtime I&#x27;ve come to realize that this product is truly amazing and the overall benefits of it are totally worth the price. In addition to that, I&#x27;ve also come to realize that it also does wonders on my hair as well! This stuff is totally worth it and everyone should give it a try.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this oil!  I use it on my face, mixed with rose hip oil, on my hands, and on the ends of my hair.  It moisturizes my dry skin beautifully, doesn&#x27;t break me out like so many other products, and doesn&#x27;t irritate my eyes when I use it directly on and around them. I have used almost my entire bottle, and it lasted me over 6 months. The dark bottle keeps it fresh for longer and it is well worth the $20. I tried Marula oil recently when this Argan started running out, and the marula broke out my skin and irritated my eyes. I won&#x27;t even bother trying other oils anymore!</li>
    <li> This is so good to add to your face in the morning and/or at night. I looked at expensive night creams and most of them mostly contained argan oil. I would definitely order this product again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always had problems keeping it from becoming frizzy during the summer months, as my hair is wavy/curly. Before I found this product I was using something called Agadir. Agadir was decent, but it had a tendency to weigh my hair down, decreasing volume and making it look like a cat had been sleeping on my head. Also, Agadir has a bunch of chemicals in its formula. This is why I&#x27;m glad I found this product. It is certified organic, and it gives my hair more volume instead of weighing it down. It also increases the shine of my hair quite naturally, giving my hair a sort of \\&quot;glow\\&quot;. This product is fair trade approved, which came as a surprise to me, considering the price is quite competitive. In my experience, fair trade approved goods tend to be more expensive than regular goods.&lt;br /&gt;This argan oil is scentless which I prefer. You can use this product on your face and body. I&#x27;ve noticed that it reduces the pores on my face and makes me look healthier. This is huge bonus--not something I could do with Agadir or Aquage.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve also applied this oil to my feet. They were chronically cold and the bottoms were all ashy and cracked. I began rubbing this oil on my feet to see what effect it would have. Two things happened: My feet gradually lost the ashiness and they felt softer.  Second, my feet feel much warmer now. I hesitate to attribute the newfound warmth in my feet to this product because it could have simply been the fact that I developed a habit of massaging my feet every morning. I forgot to mention that my girlfriend actually complimented my feet the other night. I was surprised as that has NEVER happened before. I would recommend this product wholeheartedly</li>
    <li> Highly recommend this particular argan oil.  Like the fact that it is organic and it is fantastic on either skin or hair.  Moisturizes and keeps skin supple and does great on my wife&#x27;s curly hair which tends to dry out.</li>
    <li> I love this argon oil. I use it for face and body. It goes on smooth and soaks in well, leaving the skin with a nice glow. It also does wonders for sun damaged skin and sunburns.</li>
    <li> i bought this argan  on December last year  for helping with my hair&#x27;s dryness .it was very good on that .but this days i used it with coconut oil for my body .it made me break out on some part of body like arms and legs. i have used coconut oil alone for my body before .nothing have happened. so i assume this argan oil makes me break out . i&#x27;m not sure if i&#x27;m allergy to the nut oil or because of this oil expired .</li>
    <li> Good price. I&#x27;ve noticed immediate benefits with this product. This is an unadulterated product.  Oil absorbs quickly into the skin and works wonders.  This oil is absolutely amazing. I love that its a natural product, it really works.  Highly recommend it to everyone.  I am very happy, that I founded this product.</li>
    <li> This product is the best argan oil on the market right now, i have tried many different kinds in an effort to moisturize my hair without the weighted oily feeling of most other products. This is perfect! After every shower, a take a dime size amount and warm it in my hands and work it through my hair and my hair has never been as shiny or manageable its incredible! I have had problems with split ends/ fly aways and just general haphazard hair but this has made everything so much easier. I was so impressed with its success with my hair that i tried it on my face as a substitute for a moisturizer that would break me out and ta-da no more acne no more oily patchy weird face skin its great.</li>
    <li> I use this mostly in my hair. I put a spray in my palms and then lightly run my hands through my long hair, over and over till the oil is off my hands. I then use a comb and comb, comb, comb till it is all drawn into the hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  I have used some on the back of my hands and on my face without any breakouts, reactions, etc. A small drop goes a long way so this bottle will last a long time too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  I love that the bottle is glass, it has a sprayer and or I can just unscrew the sprayer and it will drop a drop into my hand. I highly recommend this oil.</li>
    <li> It is a great oil but I am not finding it helpful with a skin rash or for frizzy hair.</li>
    <li> I bought this product a few weeks ago and I am really impressed my face looks younger and healthier. It is so soft. I have received all these wonderful compliments that this product is a permanent in my life. All these wrinkles that just started are really going away. Im also using it on my hair and all the frizz is going away. I don&#x27;t have to use a flat iron no more. I am so happy.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this on my face for a month or more and it works just as well as the very pricey oils I had used before, and for a much more reasonable price.  I spray my face and neck lightly with toner to help spread the oil and use one small squirt. It makes my skin feel smooth, but it doesn&#x27;t feel shiney and oily.  It does not seem to block pores.  I also used it on my hair a few times and it worked well there, too.</li>
    <li> I have a friend of mine who practice cycling  a lot and it happened times when he would have some muscular pain.. Reading some of the reviews, I thought this product would help him..After a week using it my friend called me asking me where did I got this as he was planning to order some more in the future..So I would highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried other products before but no product has worked as good as this stuff, recommended for everybody with hair !</li>
    <li> My skin is extremely dry and during winters it used to be just awful to touch. However, when I started using Pura D’or I could feel the difference in my skin. Pura D’or is a wonderful argan oil that can be used for hair, face, as well as body. I apply it all over my body and especially on my face as that is the part of my body which is exposed a lot to the cold. The oil has provided me with radiant and glamorous look. My skin looks nourished and glowing. Thank you Pura D’or!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know about using for hair since i don&#x27;t have any hair but I use it for my dry skin and it keeps it moisturized and silky! Great for dry skin, Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> great product. I used for my frizzy hair and for my dry skin. the package was great and it arrived early/</li>
    <li> Love it. I&#x27;ve had the bottle for almost five months now and I&#x27;m not even half way through it. I have oily hair naturally so when my hair dresser suggested I put more oil in it I thought she was crazy. After using for a month my hair was so much more healthy. My hair is super long and I only have to use three pumps to cover my hair. Love it</li>
    <li> I bought this out of whim. I had no idea if it was going to work or not. I have combination skin- dry and peeling around my nose and forehead, oily on my nose and cheeks. I am very acne prone. I had rosacea (only redness) on my cheeks and nose.&lt;br /&gt;Well, let me just say, within a few days my dry spots disappeared. My oiliness isn&#x27;t as bad as it was before I used this. I have not broken out from the use of this. My skin is glowing. I use it as my morning moisturizer when I get out of the shower and my skin just soaks it up! I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Good for hair, arms, legs and feet.  Not greasy and no smell.  I have been using it for almost two years.  R. Lee</li>
    <li> This product work wonders on my skin! What a significantly economical and exponentially beneficial option.  If i&#x27;m not going out I will use this in the morning too...it is certainly oily when you put on in the first few hours.</li>
    <li> I was very nervous about trying this product in the beginning but committed to using everyday. After about a month of use I did start to see results. My skin tone has evened out, my nails grew, and the  eczema on my hands and neck are gone. I will continue to use Pura d&#x27;or as my carrier for argon oil!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this for a couple months and I&#x27;m seeing a reduction in fine wrinkles ,fine lines and even a little lifting.  My skin is so soft and more translucent too. I also use it sparingly on my hair. To much and grease bomb! A little goes along way. It&#x27;s a good vale.</li>
    <li> I have dry skin and this oil does help.</li>
    <li> This was my 2nd bottle. Great oil. Absorbs well. Light and clear. Fast shipping. Buy for yourself or as a gift. You can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! As good as anything I have purchased at high priced department store cosmetic counters. I create a &amp;#34;mature&amp;#34; skin serum with essential oils and apply twice a day.</li>
    <li> I use this as my night time facial moisturizer and on my cuticals.  My face stays more hydrated and I have not been getting pimples on my chin.  Plus, I like the fact that it&#x27;s organic and I&#x27;m not rubbing a bunch of junk into my pores.</li>
    <li> i love it!!!!!!!!! it does everything it claims to do !!! argan oil is heaven sent!!!!!!! so glad i made a good choice</li>
    <li> The first time I tried Argan oil was Josie Maran. And then I found Pura d&#x27;or argan oil and I absolutely love it! It leaves my skin feelings soft and non-greasy. It also helps lessen redness or irritated skin.</li>
    <li> Very nice item&lt;br /&gt;thank u very mucht</li>
    <li> I love this stuff!! I use it everyday after I get out of the shower for my body, face and hair.  Really moisturizes well without the greasy feeling you get from other oils.  It absorbs really well.  I will purchase again!</li>
    <li> pure , no crazy perfumes .....great for hair , skin and nails ....you just can&#x27;t go wrong with the &amp;#34;real deal&amp;#34; stuff...love it</li>
    <li> Directly absorb by the skin, leave the skin protected and smooth. Very nice feeling.</li>
    <li> Works as well as much more expensive products. No strong fragrances. Recommend.</li>
    <li> Where has this been all my life! This has cured my dry hair issues, my chipping nails, my wrinkles have smoothed over and now my skin is glowing. If I could afford to fill a bathtub with this oil I would. I will definitely keep this product in my life forever!  One thing I did notice was that the bottle was only 2/3rds full.  Perhaps it was suppose to be this way or could also be do to evaporation as it has been very hot here. I still love it no mater what happened.</li>
    <li> love this-makes my hair feel soft without being heavy at all, makes blow drying/straightening my hair MUCH easier. I forgot to use this recently after washing my hair and the difference (in a negative way) was significant.</li>
    <li> I used to think I had dry skin and was apparently over washing. I ordered this for my hair, and tried it when my skin was so dry, it was cracking. Now, I rub it over my face, and skin has never looked better, been more clear or felt healthier! I tell everyone I talk to about skincare about this amazing find.</li>
    <li> Great Organic Argan oil. I use it with my moisturizer on my face and neck. Feels great and my face does not feel oily. I plan to buy more once I use this up. With the bottle size I know it will last a few months</li>
    <li> received the product promptly. Nice size bottle with a must sprayer which is nice. No odor or fragrance noted. I have just used it and it&#x27;s seems to make a difference since I only used it on one hand. I think I will like this product!</li>
    <li> This is by far the best argan oil!  I&#x27;ve tried 3 of 4 and this is the best and great price.  i have bought 3  bottles.  great for the hair and face.</li>
    <li> I tried Josie Moran and liked it, but thought it was rather expensive for the amount received.  I read the reviews on Amazon of other Argan Oils....and decided to try this one.  So far, it has been very nice and makes my face moist without being greasy.  It is especially good for the dry Winter months.  I like that one product can be used in so many ways....especially when packing for a trip.</li>
    <li> I use it on my face and neck at night. I don&#x27;t feel greasy in the morning but quite smooth.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff.  I haven&#x27;t seen it do anything for my skin except give me some extra mostiure when I need it, but it does wonders for my nails.  I have never been able to get my nails to grow in my life, but this stuff helps them along better than anything I have tried.</li>
    <li> This was recommended by one of the top plastic surgeons in the country.&lt;br /&gt;It makes my skin feel smooth soft and look youthful&lt;br /&gt;I use it morning and night and love it better then skin cream.&lt;br /&gt;My doctor was right.&lt;br /&gt;What a great find.&lt;br /&gt;Sorry I did not know about this when I was younger.</li>
    <li> I love this product.. Been using for 6 months and my skin has improved. Hyper pigmentation has diminished. Will continue to use!</li>
    <li> Really nice product. I have thick, curly hair that tends to be dry. A few drops of this defines my curls and makes my hair shiny. Very good price too!</li>
    <li> I have purchased this oil back in Feb. The only thing that I can say is that this oil is incredible. I have been using it on my face to fade my acne scarfs and I have seen amazing results. I never thought that an oil was going to help me resolve those scarfs. But, I am happy that I got introduced to this oil. Will buy it again and again. I still have more time to go to see better results! I&#x27;m a satisfied client 👌👏</li>
    <li> Unscented and works great! I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I use this product everyday for the tips of my hair and my face. It helps with my boyfriend&#x27;s skin irritations and the scent isn&#x27;t overpowering like most brands. One of my must have items.</li>
    <li> I love this product. I use it for my skin, hair and nails.</li>
    <li> This product is great!! For my skin, nails and hair, it really works and I really love it,  highly recommended for all skin types!</li>
    <li> I dyed my hair from black to blonde and immediately went in search of a product that could mend my weak hair from breaking. This organic argan oil was one of the best purchases I&#x27;ve ever made! It transformed my hair back to its silky smooth texture, and the oil has made my hair stronger, softer, and shinier from using this product daily. Also, it&#x27;s perfect for getting out knots and tangles out of your hair-- just need one or two pumps and you&#x27;re good.</li>
    <li> So far I am very happy with this. I have used it on my hair and it helped keep frizz down. I used it on my face, and it&#x27;s very lightweight. I also used it on my hands and it was not greasy. It has a light smell that is very pleasant.</li>
    <li> This is the best Argan oil I&#x27;ve found. I use it on my hair before using the flat iron, and I really think it has helped protect my hair from heat damage due to hair dryer and flat iron. My hair is naturally wavy and tends to friz in high humidity, and I think the product keeps that to a minimum. I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I started using Argan oil several years ago.  Recently, I have found that it is sold as &#x27;treatment&#x27; and actually contains a very small amount of the Argan oil along with several other ingredients.  My hair was no longer soft and manageable but rather it left a residue that dulled my hear.  With Pura D&#x27; Argan Oil you get pure argan oil.  I use a small amount (less than a dime).  I rub it into my palms and apply it to wet hair.  My hair is back to shiny and healthy.  It is also wonderful for dry skin.  Great product!</li>
    <li> This is a very good product at a very good price , the only problem is the spray form that is quite messy, it should be better to have the drops option.</li>
    <li> I think this is a great product that really delivers because it is organic and effective.  i recommend it highly.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this oil. It has done wonders for my skin and hair. I use it daily on my face and neck and it has really helped with wrinkles. I get so many compliments on my skin I can&#x27;t believe it!! I thank my brother-in-law all the time because he is the one who told me about it! I also keep a bottle by the kitchen sink to use after doing dishes. My hands are starting to look like they did 5 years ago!</li>
    <li> This is the second time I have purchased this! It is great stuff! I put it in my conditioner and also in my body lotion for extra moisture. It&#x27;s great to tame wild hair and I will use it alone on the front of my legs for extra sheen. I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this product!</li>
    <li> After years of using a particular brand of skin products recommended by my dermatologist, I found myself looking for a natural alternative. The products she recommended sometimes stung my face when I first put them on, and in very dry climates, seemed  to make my face feel dryer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Argan oil was recommended to me by my acupuncturist so I thought I&#x27;d give it a try. It&#x27;s great on the face for overnight. It&#x27;s gentle on my skin and acts as a great moisturizer. In the morning, my skin is soft. I never feel like there are chemicals riding roughshod on my skin because it&#x27;s 100% natural.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a little oily to use as a daytime treatment. However, during winter months or when visiting Arizona, I will sometimes use it during the day because I&#x27;m desperate for something to put on my face that will work. I try to limit how much I put on and am careful to work it into the skin so it doesn&#x27;t feel oily on the surface. It definitely moisturizes my skin - no feeling of dryness. I also found that when I use it for dry lips, I don&#x27;t have to keep reapplying it like I do chapstick. It definitely works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing that could use improving is the packaging. It would be great to have it in a nonbreakable bottle with a longer pump spout. When getting out the oil, both my hands tend to get oily and then the bottle gets slippery. It would be safer and easier if it were packaged differently.</li>
    <li> I tried another similar product, did not work as well. I should have known. I have been using this product for 4 years now and will never change again.</li>
    <li> This was the first organic grade Argan oil, I purchased.  I think it was better because my hair shedding in the sink has clearly reduced compared to when I used much lower cost non-organic Argan oil.  However, I did mix this organic oil with a small amount of mint oil (in 5 to 1 ratio)...so that could also have improved its performance.  The price for this oil should be somewhat lower.</li>
    <li> I recently decided that I wanted to go lighter with my hair after coloring my hair black for many years, with that being said my hair has suffered tremendous damage this product so far has help it.</li>
    <li> I buy this product for my mother, and she loves it. She uses it mainly for her skin (says it makes her skin looks and feel better) and she sometimes uses it for her hair as well (says it makes her hair more &amp;#34;shiny&amp;#34;).</li>
    <li> This is my second bottle of Pura d&#x27;or Argan oil. It&#x27;s wonderful for dry skin and keeps my eczema flare ups under control. You need just a few drops and it sinks into your skin to deeply moisturize. This is wonderful product and a great value.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve battled with my face for years and years - acne and dark acne scars, fine lines now, combination dry &amp; oily skin; it seems a never ending list of problems.  I had heard a lot of good things about argan oil including from my grandmother so I was on the hunt to find an inexpensive, yet effective version.  I was so happy to find this reasonably priced, organic version AND not only that, but it comes in a GLASS bottle!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Every day for almost a year, I&#x27;ve used 2 pumps on my face in the morning, right after I get out of the shower - that&#x27;s right, almost an entire year I&#x27;ve had one bottle!  It lasts forever, which makes it even more amazing.  A year later and my skin is luminous and starting to even out.  I&#x27;ve had few problems with dry or oily skin, even in the heat of the summer, the depths of a cold New England winter, and after using super drying glycolic acid peels and drying topical acne creams.  I truly think that it has helped balance out my skin (in all fairness, I&#x27;ve made other lifestyle changes in addition).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I couldn&#x27;t be happier with this product.  Funny story, I ran out a couple weeks ago and picked up Physician&#x27;s Formula new Argan Wear Ultra-Nourishing Argan Oil.  It comes with a dropper instead of pump so I actually dumped it into my Pura d&#x27;or bottle because I liked the spray feature.  I have noticed quite a difference since switching.  My face no longer feels properly moisturized; I have had to put on additional moisturizer after the oil but before make-up.  It doesn&#x27;t soak in as well either.  And I&#x27;ve found that it takes 3-4 sprays instead of just 2 to even feel like it&#x27;s doing anything.  Not to mention, I paid $14.99 for a 1 ounce bottle while the Pura d&#x27;or is 4 ounces for $20.23.  Needless to say, I&#x27;m on Amazon today to purchase a new bottle of Pura d&#x27;or!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried it on my hair a few times with poor results.  I usually use &amp;#34;Garnier Sleek and Shine Moroccan Oil Treatment&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;Garnier Marvelous Oil Color Illuminate Hair Elixir for Color Treated Hair&amp;#34;, or &amp;#34;L&#x27;Oreal Paris Eversleek Precious Oil Treatment&amp;#34; which I really like.  The Pura d&#x27;Or did not work well on my long hair at all.  It made it feel heavy and greasy which surprised me.  I haven&#x27;t tried it again.  If you want to try using it on your hair, I suggest a teeny, tiny spray and only rubbing on the very, very dry ends of hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In short, prepare to be blown away by this product.  I can not even think of a single con.  You will not regret your purchase!nate Hair Elixir for Color Treated Hair&amp;#34;, or &amp;#34;L&#x27;Oreal Paris Eversleek Precious Oil Treatment&amp;#34; which I really like.

    <li> I have been using this for 5 months, I work outside and in a lot of dirt and had trouble with pimples a lot and pitted looking face and my nose was full of blackheads.  In the last couple months I very rarely have pimples and the pits are gone as is the blackheaded nose. I use witch hazel in the morning and this at night.</li>
    <li> Works great to put a couple of drops in moisturizer, before putting on makeup -- give a glow to the makeup.</li>
    <li> This is a great product that I use in my hair, on my face and body. Try it. You won&#x27;t be disappointed</li>
    <li> This oil is just too heavy for my fine hair or even my skin.  It takes too long to soak into the skin and even a small amount weighs my hair down.  Going back to Josie Light.  Bummer - hoping to save some money but wasted it instead :(</li>
    <li> I add a drop or two to my eclose face cream at night and to my body lotion on legs and arms.  It&#x27;s wonderful and lasts forever.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for two weeks now and it has really made a significant difference in my eczema.  I&#x27;ve had eczema on one hand for years but recently started getting outbreaks on my face and scalp too.  I read where argan oil might help and I was willing to try anything because it is not only itchy and painful but also embarrassing.  I decided on this particular brand because of all the positive reviews....but you still never know how good a product really is.  I am extremely happy to say that with regular use over the past two weeks my eczema is much better everywhere -- my hands, face and scalp.  I will definitely continue to use it.</li>
    <li> Did wonders for my chlorine damaged hair.</li>
    <li> This product is absolutely amazing. My hair was previously damaged and rather unhealthy. Just after a few days of applying this oil, my hair looks pretty much perfect. While I did initially buy this product for my hair, it has also done wonders for my skin as well. I had dry skin on my elbow for months. After applying this oil for 3 days, the dryness was completely gone! I would highly recommend this product to anyone.</li>
    <li> Have very dry skin.. I love this product. I don&#x27;t use cream any more. It makes  makeup look better. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing! I have been on the hunt for a quality not overly priced argan oil. I have tried another less expensive alternative and it felt thick and left my skin greasy--nothing like the one that I loved that cost me $48 for a mid-sized bottle. But then I found this and for the price and size figured why not. It is wonderful! It is most definitely 100% comparable to the higher end, mega beauty store alternative. Argan oil only takes 1-2 drops to leave skin hydrated and glowing (I am also combination oily/dry complexion). Whenever I am using argan oil I get lots of compliments on my skin and my mild rosacea seems to calm down and I have less break outs. I am 31 and people often think I am between 20-24 years old, despite years of sunning and tanning beds which I&#x27;ve since stopped in the last few years. Thank you Pura D&#x27;or, I will most definitely be a repeat customer!</li>
    <li> I use this on my hair when my hair feels dry. A little goes a long way. A little applied to hair will make your hair soft. I also massaged this on my scalp and I noticed a decrease in hair fall.&lt;br /&gt;I was initially hesitant to buy as it was cheaper than other argan oils on the market. Decided to buy based on the reviews. When it arrived, I first checked the label. True enough, the label does say it is pure argan oil. Incredible value for money! Glad I purchased 2 bottles.</li>
    <li> Bought this a few weeks ago, and so far, so good! Probably been using a little more than I should because I love it so much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have really sensitive skin and allergies, so my skin breaks out often and leaves thick, red patches. Due to years of using steroid creams, I have some residual hypopigmentation, white patches now that blend in with the rest of my skin, doesn&#x27;t tan, and has made me really self-conscious. I&#x27;ve tried all sorts of creams, including shea butter, Bio-Oil, coconut oil, and cocoa butter. Many of them helped in the short term, but sometimes they caused my skin to become even itchier / more sensitive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;None have helped as much as argan oil. After a few days of using this stuff, the inflammation on my skin had gone down drastically, and even the white patches are beginning to blend in. For the first time in over 10 years, I can see a positive difference! And it doesn&#x27;t cause my skin to break out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I convinced my boyfriend to try this, and he&#x27;s been using it on the bags around his eyes, and his crow&#x27;s feet. Also, in a few days, the fine lines and bags have diminished significantly, and he loves it as much as I do. In fact, he&#x27;s replaced his old eye cream (one he&#x27;s been using for over a year) with the argan oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended! Definitely buying another bottle once this one runs out.</li>
    <li> This is a bit expensive, but I do recommend this product.  It is great as a face moisturizer, hand softener, and hair moisturizer.  It is one of those rare products with multi-uses.</li>
    <li> LOVE IT - non-oily oil! I can use it under my sunblock &amp; foundation, and I typically have oily skin!  Minimizes wrinkles &amp; flaky skin.</li>
    <li> I have been using this Argon oil for almost an year now. I use it on face. I have a very dry skin. Other moisturizers I have try, after half the day my skin starts feeling dry again. With this argon oil, throughout the day my skin feels good. I have not seen any miraculous changes though. My face skin feels healthy. One bottle lasts me around an hour and around three drops are sufficient for my one time use on face. I also tried this as hair oil initially but it does not has a good hold. My hair would become messy so I stopped using this as hair oil and use a creame pomade for hair now</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for about a week now. My skin feels smoother, and my wrinkles appear less pronounced. My makeup also goes on smoother. I&#x27;m quite impressed.  The reason for the 4 stars is because with skin care I know that you need to use a product for a full skin cycle to see the full benefits (about 30 days).</li>
    <li> Excellent! It does wonders to have that soft rich hair look without the &amp;#34;gel&amp;#34; product feel/shedding. It also gives me amazingly soft skin, far softer than any lotion I&#x27;ve ever used. Give it a try!</li>
    <li> Really love this oil, been using it all this year.  Love the way it leaves my hair nice and shiny with my bouncie curls.. Do recommend it to everyone!</li>
    <li> I have been using Pura d&#x27;or Argan oil for the last five months. My favorite way to use it, is on my skin. It doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy residue like other oils I have tried in the past, and my skin is silky smooth. It is perfect as an after shave moisturizer. Before I started using it on my hair, my hair was really frizzy and dry. Now my hair is shiny and smooth. I love this product, and I would definitely recommend it.[[ASIN:B004Z209HS Pura d&#x27;or 100% Pure &amp; USDA Organic Argan Oil (4 fl. oz.) For Face, Hair, Skin and Nails]]</li>
    <li> This is the second time I have purchased this product, and this time I purchased two bottles. I use it in homemade, organic skin and hair products for myself, my family, and my friends. It&#x27;s a great price and has not disappointed.</li>
    <li> Great product ! Superb for both skin and hair and just a little goes a long way !</li>
    <li> I love it and I will recommend this product to anyone. My hair stop falling since I started using this oil.</li>
    <li> I am a male and I use this product daily on my face and hair for the last 2 months and I have seen my hair and skin texture improve. I even use it after shave and it works great!</li>
    <li> For me, I find it no more useful than cheaper organic hair oils. But that&#x27;s me. I&#x27;m sure a more hair conscious person would appreciate it more. No complaints, good quality, just not a hair oil user.</li>
    <li> Applied it on my hair, lips, face and legs. I can see a difference in only six days.!. I am very happy with this product. Living in New Mexico, it&#x27;s very hot and dry. .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; What is the better product Pura D&#x27;or oil  or Foxbrim?</li>
    <li> Keep my skin moisturized</li>
    <li> you get another free bottle if you write a review...i wonder if this is why this products was rated a 4-5 star because people are just looking for free stuff. for me i dont see much different!</li>
    <li> I have recently just purchased my 2nd bottle of Purador Argan Oil. I am in love with this product. It is organic and can be used from head to toe. I used it as a serum all over my body and hair, instantly heals my dry skin and hair.</li>
    <li> Great product. You will get rid of all you lotions and potions when you get this oil. Works for every part of your body and smells  great. Will buy again and again. Wonderful present too.</li>
    <li> I purchased this after watching an infomercial about a much more expensive 100% Argan oil product. I am 49 years old and I have combination skin. I needed something that will keep down my occasional breakouts, not clog my pores, but moisturize my aging skin. This oil seems to fit the bill!  It is easily absorbed into my skin and I wake up to skin that feels, soft, hydrated, but not oily. I am also using it on my hands because at this price I don&#x27;t feel like I have to be stingy with it. I will definitely buy this again.</li>
    <li> I am 1/2 way through the bottle and would not use any other product on my skin.  I have found this product works best right after a  shower or after washing face and neck with warm water.  I Gently pat  my skin with towel and apply immediately.  Then I let my  skin finish drying with the oil so that it pulls it into the skin. At night I apply generously right under my eyes and smile lines.  I have found that this softens the look of any creases in the skin and gives a nice healthy glow to my face.  Don&#x27;t forget your neck.  Two pumps of the bottle should be enough for your face and neck while the skin is still moist from washing.  I have used many other products, but found that this doesn&#x27;t clog my pores.  And for some odd reason this stuff really works on the skin around my eyes.  I have stuck with it, and not missed a night, or morning since I received it and I believe for any product to work it needs to be used on a consistent basis.  I would definately recommend this for anyone looking to use it on their skin, but I have not used it on my hair, but I am sure I would be just as pleased.</li>
    <li> Great stuff, totally kept my face from drying out when winter hit! Arrived promptly, very well packaged.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m on my third bottle. What more could be said?</li>
    <li> I have had dry, flaky skin for over a decade and have tried every combination of moisturizer and expensive product I could justify purchasing.  I kept on hearing about argan oil and decided on this product based on the reviews.  I have been using the oil for nearly 3 weeks and am so happy with the texture and smoothness it has brought to my face.  I mix it with my Oil of Olay basic moisturizer and apply it every morning after a shower.  I also have been using it in my hair mostly as a detangler.  I have recommended it to my dad who also has very dry face skin and he is on the argan oil bandwagon now too.</li>
    <li> Awesome ! love this. even use it on my 4 year old &#x27; s skin in the winter.</li>
    <li> I have discoid lupus and this stuff really helps keep the facial rash at bay, its quite amazing. Great on unruly hair as well.</li>
    <li> Its a great product.  I use it on my face (because I don&#x27;t want to wrinkle) to keep it supple.  I use it in my hair, it tames flyway stray hair and sleeks it. I also put a few drops in my body lotion, since I don&#x27;t trust the amount or authenticity of the Argan oil reported in most hand creams.</li>
    <li> I read the reviews for this product and I was aware that this product had worked for many people. Now when I actually bought this...I was immediately won over after I used it on my hair. It&#x27;s definitely a must in your hair treatment if you want something that will work wonders&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a victim of dry, damaged hair after dying it to many times and not properly taking care of it. I have tried numerous brands of hair products to treat my hair but nothing felt like it was working. Shampoos, conditioners, butters, spray...nothing was working. A friend of mine told me about argan oil and I tried many brands of that as well, but to no avail. So when I found this brand...I was still a little scared that it wouldn&#x27;t actually work because of previous experiences.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pura D&#x27;or is not like all those other brands because it is organic (no filters or additives) and it can be used for more than one thing. It&#x27;s not just for hair. It&#x27;s for your face and body as well!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used it to also treat the itchy, dry skin on my face (and my partner&#x27;s as well) and it didn&#x27;t feel like the rest of the facial products I have used before. The others left my skin feeling oily and or made it feel like something was still on my face. But using this one, my face has felt smooth and well nourished.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will continue to buy this product and use this product until the day they stop producing it. It&#x27;s the only inexpensive beauty product that actually does what it says without any problems. I highly recommend this to others facing these similar problems and I guarantee you will be amazed with how well this product helps you out.</li>
    <li> I must have received a fraudulent bottle. Mine was Tea tree or Eucalyptus scented. It says on the bottle only one ingredient, Argan Oil, so why did It have perfume? It was thick, clear and greasy. Im sad it was not Argan Oil. I&#x27;m just grateful Amazon is really good about returns.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a month. This is an original and perfect one. I have used many moisturisers over the years, and this one doesn&#x27;t clog my pores and gives a shiny look.</li>
    <li> I live this oil!!!! I have been using this solely as my face moisturizer since I got it! It is light yet effective!! It is not greasy and it soaks into your skin quickly. I use it morning n night and I couldn&#x27;t be happier !</li>
    <li> Though this was my first time using Argan oil, this is a great quality product. Very little is needed, a drop or two for hair styling, and moisturizer. I will give it a bit more time to ad another star but so far so good.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent and pure product. I use it for my hair, nails and skin and they drink it up and it leaves no oily trace behind.</li>
    <li> I love this oil.  One spray in the palm of my hand does my whole face.  It doesn&#x27;t feel greasy at all.  After I apply it to my face, I run my hands down the ends of my hair for a little boost of shine.  I&#x27;ve used Argan oil for 2 months now and texture and fine lines in my face have greatly improved!</li>
    <li> Very greasy and sticky!  Made me break out when used on my face .</li>
    <li> A friend told me about this product, I absolutely love it! I use it on the ends of my hair, and skin. It nourishes, I love that it is organic, and smells nice too. I am a new fan, and hope to let my friends know about it as well. Thank you!</li>
    <li> I am a big fan of this oil. It sinks in quickly without leaving an oily sheen behind.  I am using it in place of lotion and a little goes a long way.  It also has a zero comedogenic factor and actually seems to have helped my acne.  I wasn&#x27;t sure about placing oil on my face, but trying to go as natural as possible I&#x27;ve been pleasantly surprised.</li>
    <li> Great product. A friend of mine told me about this. I absolutely love it! This is my first bottle and I am already seeing positive results. It does not give you an oily feel. Feels very light. I use it on a daily basis. I also get great results when I iron my hair with this applied.</li>
    <li> Great product but you only need a Very Small amount for the desired look. Think of the size of a pencil eraser (and that will cover your entire head)!!! I already ordered my second bottle!</li>
    <li> After two full weeks of use I can honestly see a positive difference(in the mirror) on my adult acne and will be placing another order before this bottle runs out. A little does go a long way.. I hope they will offer sixteen ounce bottles that offer better value or BOGO or buy two get one free. This is much better than the costly and ineffective(for me) Proactiv smorsgabord. Non greasy and clean feel as well.</li>
    <li> This oil is amazing! I ordered this to use on my dry sensitive skin since ALL other moisturizers cause me to break out. I love that it is all natural and organic with no chemicals. A little goes a long way and it leaves my skin soft and moisturized. I will be ordering this again in the future.</li>
    <li> love to put it on my nails and ends of my hair after showering. bought it because i have fine, thin hair and need to do my best to take care of what i have haha. has a nice scent and consistency! the nozzle isn&#x27;t a spray it sort of shoots out in aa small stream but its manageable. would recommend.</li>
    <li> I have used  certified organic argan oil from a natural market in the past that worked much better .  This one is a bit heavier and lacks the &#x27;argan&#x27; odor.</li>
    <li> I use Josie Maran Argan Oil but was looking for a cheaper alternative. Unfortunately, this particular Argan oil made me break out between my eyebrows, and I do not have acne prone skin. However, it worked beautifully on my hair and left it smooth and soft when applied on damp hair. FYI to dog owners, dogs seem to love the taste of this. My dog somehow got ahold of this and ate the entire bottle.</li>
    <li> This product is great. I used it for my dry scalp and worked well in nourishing it. It is not sticky and heavy. Naturally shines my hair without the heavy feel of regular hair shinning products. I used it on my skin too and feels so soft. I recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I really like this argan oil, I use it for around my eyes and my hair.  It doesn&#x27;t have a strong smell like others I have tried, it has a very very light nutty scent which I read is a good quality in argan oil.</li>
    <li> This product makes my hair shiny and voluminous, does not make my hair excessively greasy. Ever since I started using this product, I haven&#x27;t spotted one single split-end. It is truly a miracle item!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Pura d&#x27;or Argan Oil for about 2 weeks, or so.  I was concerned about oil staying on top of my skin and not soaking in. This Agran oil absorbs into my skin quickly and leaves a subtle shimmer on my skin after soaking in.  I really like the oil and my face feel very hydrated and look healthy after applying it.  My fine lines are practically invisible.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> This is a nice and clean Argan for the price.  I have been using it on my rough/dry patches in conjunction with Vanicream Lite for my rosacea and it has worked wonders.  Patch test first!  If it&#x27;s too rich or irritating for your skin, I would dilute it with lotion.  A little drop will do you!</li>
    <li> If Josie Maran is organic pure argan oil, I do not know WTH this oil is.  Sorry but it does not look, smeel, fell like pure argan oil to me.</li>
    <li> The only Argan oil I use after trying several brands! I use it on my hair after a shower to help prevent frizzing and a small amount after styling to give it a beautiful shine! I also use it on my face at night before bed and have noticed an increase in softness and smoothness to my skin.  Wonderful product!</li>
    <li> I bought this to use with the D-Arsonval unit and it is the perfect choice. I rotate this product with other night creams on an every-other-day basis. My skin is &amp;#34;mature&amp;#34; and sun-damaged. This doesn&#x27;t create skin issues and a little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> I love this product! It has a slightly nutty smell as it should, and costs a quarter of the price of the brand I used to get. The quality is great and it lasts a while.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for a couple of days and I really like it. My hair seems to be curlier than normal. After showering, I put a small amount in the ends of my hair, followed by a leave-in conditioner and re-wet, scrunch. I will be purchasing again!</li>
    <li> Thank you so much for making such a wonderful&lt;br /&gt;product. I have long, curly, thick, hair. I have not always loved&lt;br /&gt;them but now I couldn&#x27;t imagine having straight hair. For the longest&lt;br /&gt;time though I have been suffering with extreme dryness&lt;br /&gt;on my ends and I have researched everyday what to do. I have tried olive oil&lt;br /&gt;treatment, homemade concoctions with avocado, the best deep conditioners out there&lt;br /&gt;and nothing has seemed to work until now. I just wanted to say thank&lt;br /&gt;you. My curls drank up the pura d or and just the few drops on the ends were&lt;br /&gt;simply amazing. If my curls could thank you they would. Instead they are shiny and soft.... And the&lt;br /&gt;dryness is getting better and better with each use.</li>
    <li> Love it! Its pure and good.  Wear it all over, soaks in and leaves skin soft.  Many uses and take it even when I travel.</li>
    <li> My wife asked me to buy her Argan oil for her hair and face about 6 weeks ago, she is using it for her hair and it makes it look shiny. I have a greasy face and she told me I needed to put some, I told her that its going to make my face look too greasy, she convinced me and put it on my face. Guess what happened? I&#x27;m using it every day because when you put it in, it gets absorbed by the skin and my face doesn&#x27;t look greasy at all.</li>
    <li> Really good stuff I like how it can be used as a skin care product as well as for hair. If you wanna see it in action search modernmantv on YouTube.</li>
    <li> After my first use of this argan oil . My skin looks softner and fairer . Very good product . I will deffinately recommend it to my friend .</li>
    <li> I was originally searching for macadamia oil to which I use on my hair to reduce frizz and keep it healthy. The macadamia oil was working fine but I saw the great reviews for this product and saw it had other uses (skin) as well so I decided to give it a try. It’s been a week and so far so good. When I put it in my hair it reduces the frizz and leaves it with a nice healthy sheen. I also applied some on my face (I usually never point any kind of oils on my face) and it in my opinion it works as a moisturizer. More impressive is that it absorbs into my skin quickly and doesn’t leave and oily residue which I assumed it would. So far I’m happy with it and will have to update this review again in a few months.</li>
    <li> This product has become my skin care staple. It moisturizers my skin, leaves it feeling soft, and all with no chemicals whatsoever. I don&#x27;t use it under my eyes because I find that it makes my eyes water and itch as the day goes on.</li>
    <li> I bought this brand after reading reviews and articles about how great Argan oil is for the face and hair. I haven&#x27;t used this product on my hair yet, but I absolutely love it for my skin. Just a few drops and my face feels smooth without being greasy. And since a little goes a long way, it&#x27;s much cheaper than buying a cream or lotion. This is my second bottle, I will continue to purchase.</li>
    <li> I am on the third bottle of Pura Dor Argan oil. I am 73 years old and people always comment on my complextion and ask what I use because my skin looks so dewey and fresh.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product. I have dry skin and have been recently into skin care products that are both natural, effective and free of parabens and chemical junks. The Josie Maran argan oil worked wonders but is definitely pricey, so I came across this on Amazon and it&#x27;s perfect!! My bottle has lasted quite a few months now and I&#x27;m about to purchase another one just to make sure I have a stash. I use it every single night (1-2 pumps for the summer, 3-4 pumps for the winter/drier months) on my face as a moisturizer, for my body after showering and a teeny tiny bit for the dry ends of my hair. I don&#x27;t know what I did before this stuff but I&#x27;m really glad I found this particular brand on Amazon because it&#x27;s great.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t use this product long enough, but what I am seeing is just amazing result. I applied the oil into my hair and I am noticing immediate change and improvement. My hair feels softer and more straight. It looks like when I was 10 years younger. I will definitely try to continue using it and I hope to see even more effect as I continue using it.</li>
    <li> I decided to buy this product because I wanted to go natural and also the price was really good compared to Josie Maran. It was difficult for me to justify buying a 4oz bottle of argan oil for almost 100 dollars. They are both 100% organic argan oil. I thought they couldn&#x27;t be different. My first impression of this product was &amp;#34;it&#x27;s good, doesn&#x27;t smell, takes a while to absorb, gives my face a slight bronze complexion, a bit too oily on my face after the application, gives similar results as my DIY olive oil treatment.&amp;#34; After a while, I hadn&#x27;t seen much improvement on my skin, so I came back to amazon to see if anyone experienced what I experienced. That&#x27;s when I started reading the lower-starred reviews. My thought is that different people may have different reaction to skin-care products, so it&#x27;s normal that some people are happy and some are not. Eventually I decided to purchase a smaller bottle of Josie Maran, just to compare the two. I wanted to see it for myself instead of basing my judgment on reviews alone. Here is the result: Josie Maran argan oil can be absorbed much faster for my skin. It feels less oily and the color is clearer (doesn&#x27;t give my face a bronze complexion). My skin feels softer yet not oily. All in all, I have had a really pleasant experience with Josie Maran. I will continue using Pura d&#x27;or for my hair, but I will not use it on my face. Josie Maran seems to be a better investment for skin-care. But for $20+, Pura d&#x27;or wins in affordability.</li>
    <li> A great product! For a long time I use argan oil, but with this one I&#x27;m impressed! It is odorless and  absorbes well!</li>
    <li> My wife and my mother both love the product.  Arrived promptly, as asual.</li>
    <li> Nice product and fairly priced especially compared to other organic brands. The bottle did leak but was packaged in sealed plastic so the mess was contained. It works well all over the whole body! This is the perfect all-in-one moisturizing product to travel with because of the versatility. I love that there is no fragrance to compete with any cologne or other products. Argan is an amazing moisturizer, the results are immediate and lasting. It does not have the typical oily feel when applied and a little goes a long way. It simplifies my routine and the results are great!!</li>
    <li> Good Product and the real one.&lt;br /&gt;Very good,I love it</li>
    <li> Love this! This is awesome for the ends of my hair--plus it doesn&#x27;t have a strong scent, so it won&#x27;t give you a headache like some other argon oil&#x27;s do.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this oil. I came across organic argan oil about a month ago and have been truly impressed with this product. My skin looks younger, I mean the wrinkles are noticeably gone and my skin feels softer. I have used a certain moisturizing cream for years, I&#x27;m talking 20 years or more, and as of this oil I&#x27;ll no longer be using the cream. I highly recommend this argan oil.</li>
    <li> I use this argan oil mixed in with Chihtsai instant treatment for my hair right after I shower and it keeps my hair shiny and healthy looking. I love that purador argan oil is not too oily and the 4 fl oz is a great size to use up to 6 months. It&#x27;s a great value since when I bought it a year ago it was double the price! I appreciate that now it&#x27;s more affordable so I&#x27;ll definitely be buying more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll also often use the argan oil mixed in with my lotion, keeping my skin smooth and even toned. Love that it has so many positive benefits!</li>
    <li> I love this oil! I use it on my skin and hair and it leaves both feeling smooth soft and nourished. For years I&#x27;ve struggled with&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;big hair&amp;#34; - coarse and porous so in humidity it just gets bigger. Using Pura d&#x27;or argan oil has changed my unruly locks into soft, shiny and manageable hair that I love! I appreciate the purity, and it&#x27;s organic! Thank you.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love Argan oil!  It makes my skin smoother and not oily feeling. I even use it under my makeup!  I also use it on my hair everyday to smooth it out, to prevent flyaways and to make it softer and more manageable.</li>
    <li> I have used other argan oils and this is by far the best.  It keeps my skin and hair is great condition.  I will order&lt;br /&gt;this again.</li>
    <li> I had heard a little about Argan oil and its properties and was introduced to it by a friend.  That was over a year and four bottles ago.  NOW I can&#x27;t go without it.  I just use four pumps of it in the morning and it lasts all day.  Even after applyng clear water to my face several times a day. :)  I hav received compliments on my skin which is surprising, since it is the ONLY thing I will put on my face.  I have recommended this product to everyone who is serious about skin care and try not to fun out this AT ALL.  It is like going without my Tom&#x27;s of Maine toothpaste and you KNOW you need to use THAT everyday as well!!!  I am Extremely satisfied with this product and it is a Regular part of my skin care regimen.</li>
    <li> This oil is very nice. I would recommend it to a friend.</li>
    <li> I have been using this Argan Oil product for a few weeks and have definitely noticed several positives to my hair health.  I am a male growing out my hair for the first time and have very thick, mostly straight hair with some waves on the back and sides.  I spray a few drops of this on my palms and apply it to my hair when it is damp and then comb through my hair with a wide-tooth horn comb.  The argan oil gives my hair a natural shine and smoothness which looks and feels very healthy.  I had been using gels and pomades to keep my thick hair under control and make it less poofy, but this product is much healthier for someone wanting long, healthy hair.  I have used coconut and olive oils in the past, and although they are also great for hair health, they left my hair feeling very greasy and gave it almost a wet appearance.  My hair is only around nose length right now, so only 2-3 drops of this are needed; a little bit goes a long way!  I may be imagining it but my hair also seems to be growing faster since using this product, which isn&#x27;t a bad side effect for someone growing their hair out!  I have also had great results using this product on some dry skin areas.  I am Caucasian and my skin tans very easily in the summer time, and applying a tiny amount of this oil to my face, hands, and arms leaves them looking and feeling very healthy and maintains the bronze tan.  This product is USDA Organic and contains high amounts of Vitamin E and other vitamins very beneficial for hair and skin health, and I would recommend it to anyone!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using argan oil on my face for 6 months. When my first bottle (of another brand) ran out, I decided to try this.  I&#x27;ve used it daily for 2 weeks and I love it.  Great consistency, nice subtle smell.  My acne is improving - my skin is less oily when I use this - and my dark spots are fading.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Pura d&#x27;or for several months now on both my face and body. It makes my skin feel nourished, not oily.  Great product, and it&#x27;s organic!</li>
    <li> This argon oil is amazing!  I noticed a difference after using it a couple of days.  My skin is softer and smoother.  There is no odor and it absorbs quickly!  I use it night and day on my face and also on my hands.  Will definitely be ordering more!</li>
    <li> The strangest thing is that this product ruined my gel nail polish! It literally started peeling off. I&#x27;ve never had any oil/lotion have that effect. I used it on my cuticles bc it said its a good cuticle oil in the booklet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Long story short...don&#x27;t use this on your hands if you have gel nails.</li>
    <li> I used this at night after washing my face with my clearsonic and the reviews are pretty right. It does make you look brand new in the morning. This is better than my Clinique moisturizer. You just need about 2 drops/night after cleaning your face, and you will look like you just had a good night&#x27;s sleep-rare for me. I always look tired. So yes I&#x27;ll be ordering more in the future.</li>
    <li> great for my face. lately i started using vitamin C serum before I apply argan oil, but even without vitam C, I felt the difference on my skin after one week use. will continue with this for sure</li>
    <li> Nice product! I use it in my hair, as well as on my face. I would recommend.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this stuff.  It is now a staple in my bathroom, I just simply can&#x27;t do without it.  I use it for my hair, skin, and nails all the time.  I have very sensitive acne prone skin and use this oil for my Oil Cleansing Method routine and it has left my skin very moisturized without feeling greasy, doesn&#x27;t make me breakout, and has also reduced redness around nose and eye areas.  One small drop also manages to tame my curly frizzy mane and leave it feeling soft and shiny.  I was afraid it would have a nasty odor like I have experienced with other Argan oils, but this has absolutely none!  I am very satisfied with this product and would highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! I actually bought it almost two years ago, and use it after every hair wash, and I still have about third of the bottle left. It certainly goes a long way. I have very fine curly hair, prone to dry and split ends. This stuff helps like nothing else I have ever tried. Just two drops after the hair wash, gently massaged into the ends and works like a charm. Doesn&#x27;t make my hair looks greasy, or weights it down. The pump is handy, so the use is not messy and it keeps the bottle nice and clean. When I run out, I will most definitely purchase it again.&lt;br /&gt;However, it doesn&#x27;t do anything for my skin. I tried to use it as a moisturizer, but it made my skin to break out. It may be just a type of my skin, almost any oily substance causes be a break outs, so I&#x27;m not terribly disappointed. I bought it for the use in my hair anyway, and with the results of that, I&#x27;m more than happy.</li>
    <li> LOVE this stuff. Been using it for several months now on my hair and face. I have fine, curly hair that has historically been pretty straw like. This is the only stuff that has brought my hair back to life and made it look like shiny, silky, healthy hair. I also use it on my face at night. At first I thought it would break me out because I have acne prone skin, but it hasn&#x27;t given me any problems, and it seems to calm my skin and gives me a healthy glow. I&#x27;m hooked!!</li>
    <li> I love all the products by this company. I use this oil for my oil cleansing method routine and its cleared up my skin wonderfully!</li>
    <li> I just received this today and applied it to my daughter&#x27;s hair. It immediately helped to de-tangle her hair and was very easy to apply. Her hair does not look or feel greasy, which is great because sometimes it is hard to know how oil will affect someone&#x27;s hair. Hopefully this will help keep future tangles at bay.</li>
    <li> I have tried many different types and brands of oil for my after shower moisturizer and this product is by far the best and most reasonably priced!</li>
    <li> My beautician recommended Argan Oil for my relaxed hair.  She stressed that 100% pure is best.  I started using this product and within two weeks, my hair feels moisturized without a greasy feel.  So far, I&#x27;m very pleased!</li>
    <li> I use it on my face and hands at the end of the day!  My hands look much smoother.  It is a little greasy for under make-up, but fine for those days you just want to add a little blush and mascara.  I will buy it again!</li>
    <li> Our three daughters are swimmers. Their hair is typically dry due to exposure to pool chemicals daily. Since we mix the argan oil with the conditioner, their hair is always silky. We are very happy with the results.</li>
    <li> I use this on everything. Love it.</li>
    <li> I usually stay away from oils because I feel I need to wash my hands always due to greasy residue being left behind. I tried a little bit on my hands to moisturize and I was surprised to see how well and quickly it absorbed. It left my hands feeling supple instantly. I&#x27;m excited to use this on my legs and face because where I live there is cool and dry air which tends to dry out my skin and irritate it.</li>
    <li> If you have sensitive skin, do not use. I went to two different doctors before I realized I was having an allergic reaction. My eyes were swollen and I could carry luggage in the bags under my eyes. I have over half a bottle I can&#x27;t use and this stuff isn&#x27;t cheap!! It did seem to help my eczema on my foot, but I had to choose between the lesser of two evils!</li>
    <li> This product is GREAT! My hair never felt softer and I love the fragrance.</li>
    <li> very moisturizing  , hydration lasts all day, skin is smoother.friends are commenting on how well my skin looks,I will order more of this product.</li>
    <li> I have used 3 different brands of Argan Oil......this one has the best smell and the best dispenser. The pump instead of a dropper is great.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using expensive night creams and serums for my face, but after trying this I will never go back to them. This leaves my face feeling so smooth and I have seen improvement in my skin that I hadn&#x27;t seen with the expensive products. I will continue to use this. Love it!</li>
    <li> have you tried this yet for dry and or frizzy and or lackluster hair? best product i&#x27;ve ever used in my hair</li>
    <li> This is pure argan oil and is exactly as described.  It comes in a dark bottle, which is essential for keeping the product from going bad.  It is also very cost effective (less than half the cost of other brands), but does not sacrifice quality.  Overall a great product and I will definitely be purchasing it again.</li>
    <li> very nice product, goes on well. A little messy when I tried to add more product and had some on my hands, otherwise no complaints</li>
    <li> I have looked so long for a natural remedy that&#x27;s not greasy or weigh my hair down! I have used a lot of Garnier hair products which left split and dry ends on my hair. I&#x27;ve only been using Pura D&#x27;or Argan oil for a couple weeks but it really makes a difference on my long thick Asian hair. I only need a couple drops in the morning and before I go to bed, and it really helps keep my hair more manageable and significantly less frizzy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a little pricey but a little goes a long way and I will never go back to using drugstore products again. Natural remedy is the best remedy!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks Pura D&#x27;or!</li>
    <li> In the past I have used products for my hair that contain argan oil.  However, not until I purchased this product did I fully understand the benefits of using a pure argan oil product.  There is a vast difference between having argan oil as one of the ingredients in a hair product and having it as the only ingredient.  My salt and pepper hair is considerably softer, more manageable and has a subtle shine, as opposed to a slick sheen.  Also important is the fact that this wonderful pure argan oil product is less costly than the argan oil containing product that I had been using.  Although I have only been using this Pura D&#x27;or Pure and Organic Argan Oil for a short time, I am confident that my hair will reap greater benefits with continued and long term use.  The fact that this is an organic product is also a plus.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this brand for the past 5 months or so. I&#x27;m on my 3rd bottle because I use this twice a day. Once over my sunscreen and before going to bed. I also use it wherever I have dry skin. It doesn&#x27;t make me break out at all and leaves my combination skin really even and glowing all day. Can&#x27;t say enough good things about Argan Oil. I&#x27;ve also tried other more expensive brands and this one works equally as well.</li>
    <li> Good product, I have been using this product for about two weeks on my face and hair, it works grate, scentless, and the price is reasonable</li>
    <li> It smell really relaxing , soft on skin and hair.  I feel after one used my body so smooth and my hair is soft and shine</li>
    <li> I just received this body and hair oil a few days ago, and haven&#x27;t been able to stop using it!  It&#x27;s perfect as an after shower or bath body oil, and a little bit goes a very long way.  One tiny pump covers my whole face and neck, so I&#x27;m actually expecting this to last a while.  It is quick absorbing as well, unlike other body oils that leave you feeling greasy for hours.  I appreciate that it is pretty much odorless and colorless, it&#x27;s just like pure silk for your skin.  It&#x27;s awesome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only downside I can see so far is when I put a bit on my hair after a shower it got a bit greasy looking.  I probably won&#x27;t continue to use this on my hair, unless I&#x27;m doing a oil treatment for it.  Even then, though, this stuff is a little too expensive to use just for a hair treatment then wash, although I&#x27;m sure it would work amazingly.  I only tried it once on my hair after a shower though, so perhaps I overdid it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, very good product.  Definitely a bit of a splurge for me, but it works really nicely and is clearly quality stuff.  Will most definitely purchase again when I run out (and will also probably check out some of this company&#x27;s other products)!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used a few different oils and this is the best! Easy bottle, price is good, quality is great and the smell isn&#x27;t as bad as others.</li>
    <li> I bought this oil for my wife..She loved this oil and told that this oil made her hair shiny and soft. The cost is in our budget .no complains.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only just started using this, but I really like it.  Until now, I&#x27;ve been using shea butter or coconut oil in my hair and both have been leaving it greasy.  I used this after a shower last night and my hair looks fantastic this morning.  Super excited for how my hair will look in a few weeks.</li>
    <li> I received a sample of Josie Maran Argan Oil Light a few months ago and liked the results on my face, but not enough to invest in a full size bottle. I decided to go on Amazon and see what other options were out there. I read all the great reviews of Pura d&#x27;or and for the price, I thought it wouldn&#x27;t hurt to try. The product came within 2 days on Prime, and so far I love it. It doesn&#x27;t have the funky smell like the Josie Maran, and the pump is nice (though you have to push down lightly and carefully if you only want a little bit). I put a less-than dime size of oil on my face at night, followed by Decleor Aroma Night Balm, and when I wake up in the morning, my face looks bright and feels clear and even-toned. My skin is on the dark side, and I have pretty oily skin. The argan oil helps hydrate and doesn&#x27;t feel heavy at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since I was able to get so much more oil for the price, I don&#x27;t feel bad about using it on the tips of my hair, my cuticles, and my heels, to get soft rich skin. Would highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> I use this product on my 6 months daughter&#x27;s hair and it does an excellent job helping the hair stay moist and helping it grow.  Works wonders on AA hair.</li>
    <li> Lately I decided to make a big change in my face-care routine and go 100% natural.  No chemicals at all!  Unfortunately this meant making my own creams and lotions. A bit of a roller-coaster ride later, I finally heard about Argan Oil.  By the time I read about Argan Oil, I knew it was perfect for me—zero comedogenic and excellent anti-aging properties! When I tried it I could tell immediately how good it was.  It is now one of the chief elements in my oil cleansing routine.  I use a mix of Hemp Seed Oil with a few drops of Argan Oil at night to cleanse with, and in the morning, all I do is rinse off my face with warm water and apply a few drops of Argan Oil or Rosehip Seed Oil.  If during the day my face seems dry, I spritz it with a little rose water then apply as much Argan Oil as I feel is needed—without worrying about clogged pores!  My skin is much clearer and brighter since using this oil.  It has become essential to my skin health.  Also—it is great for curly hair.  After washing my hair, I run a drop of Argan Oil into my still wet hair, squish it in thoroughly, then squeeze my hair dry with a soft cloth (make sure it&#x27;s not a terry-cloth towel since these ruin curls), style with a large toothed comb, then let it air dry.  Voila, curls—without frizz and without oily film too.  Argan Oil for me is really a terrific, must have skin care product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used several different things to keep my beard soft and under control. I&#x27;ve been using this for about a week and I can already tell it will be my new go to. Doesn&#x27;t leave it feeling oily, and gives a nice shine.</li>
    <li> I am so glad I found this brand of Argan Oil.  I have been paying a premium price (6 times more for the same amount/per oz) for another brand.  I researched Pura d&#x27;or and found the company and their Argan Oil process worth giving a try.  I have now used their product for a week and love the quality and results.  I ordered two bottles and gave one to my daughter and she loves it also.  We notice no difference between Pura d&#x27;or and the other expensive brand.  Actually, my daughter says she likes Pura d&#x27;or a little more.  As an added plus, the pump on this bottle is so much easier to use than the eye dropper with the other brand.  Also, the packaging is awesome!  Will be a faithful Pura d&#x27;or customer from now on.</li>
    <li> Very nice n velvety texture does not leave skin greasy makes my skin  nice and soft like this oil</li>
    <li> I just started using this product and after the FIRST use I can already tell a difference in my skin and hair. Pura d&#x27;or helps with my split ends and makes my skin softer and more radiant. It dosent leave an oily feel and a little gose a long way!</li>
    <li> Very good product, helps you maintain a more youthful skin, moisturized and smooth. At the beginning it&#x27;s oily, but is absorbed quickly. I use it daily after bathing. The weather in my city is hot, but not annoying.</li>
    <li> works great for your hair! i use it as a natural alternative to synthetic anti-frizz or heat protectant solutions i used to buy at the store. the scent is mild.</li>
    <li> This Argan Oil is a miracle in a bottle!! I LOVE it! I love how you can use it on your hair and skin, it&#x27;s like getting two or three or even four products in one, it&#x27;s so versatile. This is worth more than the cost, trust me. My mother had given me a bottle of shampoo that claimed to, &amp;#34;Get rid of build-up so your favorite shampoo works even better&amp;#34;.  Well, I used that once and it fried my beautiful hair that I spent a lot of money on special products to get. I used this product twice and my hair is absolutely fine now. Shiny, I have my waves back (it had flattened out), and softer than it was even before the shampoo nightmare. I think this is the wisest purchase I have ever made. Also, it&#x27;s getting rid of a worry wrinkle between my brows and it&#x27;s doing it fast! 2 days and massive improvement. Dark circles...working on that, too! You can use this on your hair, skin and nails for a smoother surface and softer cuticles!!! Their website has even more uses!: https://www.purador.com/pure-and-organic-argan-oil</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. The price is getting higher and higher, though. I&#x27;m not sure what my limit is price wise because this stuff lasts forever. You only need a little bit to moisturize. I use it on my hair and skin - face included.</li>
    <li> The black head is gone.Love it.</li>
    <li> Best product I have tried thus far.  My boyfriend and I both use it.</li>
    <li> I have an olive complexion that is prone to acne scarring. Although I rarely breakout these days, I still have left over hyper-pigmentation, and when I do get a pimple, I usually get an annoying brown spot that takes months to fade. This argan oil has helped immensely. I have seen results in fading in just one week, and the oil is very moisturizing, and it does not sit on my skin. I highly recommended if you&#x27;re looking for a natural moisturizer.</li>
    <li> I adore this product.  I have very thick hair that gets dry, but other oils tend to make it greasy.  This one makes it soft and smooth without the grease.  It&#x27;s great for all styling methods, from wearing it wet and wavy to blow drying my hair straight.  Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> My second bottle. I have tried other brands, and they were good as well. I am no expert on the stuff, but it is great for keeping my skin nice and soft. I also take a couple of servings in the morning in my hand and run it through my hair. Gives the hair a nice supple feel.</li>
    <li> This is the best argan oil. I was so sad when my argan oil that I bought in Morocco ran out, but so happy to find this brand. I have oily skin but this oil actually helps regulate the oil on my face, highly recommended. I also use it on my hair and it makes my hair sooooo soft and smooth. Everytime I get a hair cut the hairdresser comments how soft my hair is. This is a great all around product, highly recommended.</li>
    <li> This is my first time buying and using argan oil so I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect. I have been using it for about two weeks. I use it at night, after washing my face. I have normal to dry skin, don&#x27;t get many breakouts, so I can&#x27;t say that I notice a difference yet, but at the very least I am very happy that this oil didn&#x27;t cause any rashes or breakouts! Yes, it does leave your face shiny, but then again, it is an OIL. So far, I am pleased with it, and would purchase from this company again - can&#x27;t beat the price!</li>
    <li> This product is great as a nighttime ointment.  I also love it for my hands, my cuticles are soft and not cracked when I rub this oil into them.</li>
    <li> Much more thick than other argan oil products I have used, but it is pure argan oil as stated, good for my skin but not for my fine hair.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing. I have purchased Argan oil locally and it is always mixed with other oils and heavy scents. This Argan oil is 100% pure and it has virtually no smell. Some other reviewers have claimed that it has a sprayer on it, I would call it a pump, as it does not spray out when pressed. I use it on my hair several times a week to soften, shine and moisturize. I use it on my face daily as a cleanser and moisturizer. I use it all over my body as a moisturizer. It softens the tough skin on my feet. I put a liberal amount on my feet before bed and cover with socks and in the morning my feet feel soft and look hydrated. I will be buying again soon!</li>
    <li> The product does a great job of moisturizing my balding scalp.  Very happy with this purchase.  (Note:  I don&#x27;t have dandruff, so I could not say if it will help with that.)</li>
    <li> I love this product! I use it under my facial moisturizer everyday. It has helped with acne and overall appearance of my skin.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve recently gotten into Young Living essential oils and was looking for an oil that would be good for my face. I didnt want to use coconut oil on my face for fear of clogging. This oil is perfect to mix with essential oils and use as a wrinkle cream, acne cream, or for scarring. I&#x27;ve also heard it does wonders for hair. I will have to try that too. The size is perfect and the packaging was amazing to make sure it didnt break. I would recommend to anyone that wants a light oil especially to use with essential oils.</li>
    <li> Great oil. Contents should last a long  time as only a smidgen is necessary per application.</li>
    <li> Pura D&#x27;or makes a quality Argan oil. I put the argan oil on my face in the morning and at night. This oil makes my skin feel soft and supple. I will purchase another bottle when I finish this one.</li>
    <li> I purchased three of these, two to give away and one for myself. I just received them and two of them were packed in bubble wrap and had the cute little bag and the other one was not wrapped and did not come with the bag. I will be keeping that one but I find it odd that the third one wasn&#x27;t packaged the same way. Regardless, I hope the oil will help me with my dry skin and improve my hair.</li>
    <li> About a year ago I stopped using any lotions, facial cream and eye cream since none of them were helping to slow down amount of wrinkles and make my skin more supple.  I did a little research and decided to switch to Argan oil.  I don&#x27;t believe I got any extra wrinkles since last year.  My skin feels good and I use it on my body, face and eyes.  Argan oil is not greasy like shea butter, so it doesn&#x27;t mess up clothing either.  I bought probably at least 5 bottles from this company so far never had any issues, so this is a good provider.</li>
    <li> Just got this in my package today and I&#x27;m very excited about it! Put a bit in my hair and it already feels so lovely. I&#x27;m very pleased with this purchase.</li>
    <li> This was my first time purchasing a Pura d&#x27;or product. I obviously liked the price for the amount of product. I feel the argan oil rubs in really well. I also feel that it will mix well with my lotion during the winter months. I give it four stars because it is a little thinner than my previous Argan oil so it just makes me a little skeptical of the products authenticity. I will be trying more Pura d&#x27;or products.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve purchased other argan oil in the past, with varying success---I used to swear by Mogador Argan Oil (http://www.amazon.com/Mogador-Certified-Organic-Argan-Oil/dp/B004S2G4FG/) but the last vial I bought really smelled of rubber, possibly because of the rubber dropper. Ironically, that is the part that I miss  with the Pura d&#x27;or! I felt I had more control over the dropper than the pump that comes with this brand. However, the quality of the argan oil itself is great, and I think I&#x27;ll be able to get accustomed to using the pump rather than the dropper. I use argan oil for a variety of things, most recently to prevent pregnancy-related stretch marks (which may be mostly genetic, but better safe than sorry!) and address hormone-related skin issues. It&#x27;s great to help address lines and wrinkles, as well. It really is a miracle oil and I&#x27;d never be without it.</li>
    <li> Makes my skin look supple and keeps it hydrated. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> After my pregnancy, I lost a lot of my hair.  As a result, I had many frizzy flyaways as it was growing out.  Having curly, frizzy hair to begin with, I was not pleased.  My friend recommended and gave me product to sample (Josie Moran Argan Oil) and I loved it, but it was $50 for a tiny bottle!  I did research and decided to purchase Pura d&#x27;or Argan oil.  It worked just as well as the $50 oil and was half the price.  I would highly recommend.</li>
    <li> A good, cheap alternative to the expensive version found in stores. This product helps condition hair and keep frizz at bay! My only complaint is that it smells like pine trees while some of the other brands/versions smell of flowers (they probably are less pure).</li>
    <li> I was thrilled to have the bottle arrive a day early, but upon opening I noticed a very sour scent. I checked again and it was far from a nutty smell but a very sour, unpleasant smell. I contemplated on this item because the price seemed too good, but I thought I&#x27;d give it a try. I should have gone with the other product and paid a little more. I&#x27;m a bit frustrated that they would sell old and unusable items at a cheaper price. I&#x27;ve been trying to contact their customer service, but all I get is their recorded message. I&#x27;ve emailed them and will update on their customer service once they get back to me.</li>
    <li> I bought this product for my mom who is going through radiation therapy for her breast cancer. After reading one of the review from a customer who went through similar thing. The oil helps moisturize and bring down the redness and tightness on the affected skin. So far, she has finished 1 week of radiation, and her skin has very minimal effect from the radiation.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Moroccan Argan Oil for years 5+ on my face. I used Josie Maran first, and really loved it, but not the high price!  A cousin introduced me to Pura D&#x27;or and I&#x27;ve been hooked since. I use it morning and night, and after the oil has been well absorbed (and it really does absorb), I cover my skin with a thin layer of serum to lock in the oils.  Afterwards, I use any moisturizer. I am not lying when I say that my skin looks a full 20 years less than my biologic age. I get told so often that I have &amp;#34;amazing skin&amp;#34;.  I credit the Argan Oil.  I&#x27;ve also bought bottles of this oil as gifts to others, and have gotten other friends &amp;#34;hooked&amp;#34;, including male friends.  I&#x27;ve not tried it on my hair, but based on some reviews, I just may. Thank you for this product and please don&#x27;t ever discontinue!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for several years now. I first discovered it when I was researching moisturizing cream and someone had mentioned that they prefer using argan oil. Then when I started researching argan oil, Pura d&#x27;or had very positive reviews so I decided to try it. I am 50 years old and do not wear makeup. I have many people tell me that I do not look 50 and that I have a very good complexion. Every morning and night I put 3-4 drops on my face and neck. It soaks in right away and my face never feels oily, just nice and soft. It is a light oil and never clogs my pores or causes blemishes. One bottle lasts quite a while too. My husband even uses it when his face gets dry and he likes it so much he asked me to send his mother a bottle. I went ahead and sent my mother a bottle too.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for a year and a half now. I have sensitive skin and so the first time I tried it, I was nervous. But it absorbs so great into my skin and does not make it feel greasy or cause irritation.  I use this as at night after I clean my face, as part of my routine and I have never been disappointed.</li>
    <li> This is the second bottle of Pura d&#x27;or that I have ordered.  I love it!  I use it as a face/body/hair moisturizer.  It works better than coconut oil for me.  It absorbs quickly and has a light, pleasant fragrance.  I ran out of it recently before my new order came in, and I could hardly stand being without it.  I won&#x27;t let that happen again!</li>
    <li> Very good quality. I use it plain and mixed on hand lotion when my hands are very dry from the weather. It&#x27;s soothing and healing.</li>
    <li> This is the second bottle I have ordered. I LOVE it. I&#x27;ve actually stopped using my daily moisturizer and night cream in replace of this argan oil. Not only do I use it on my face, I apply (a small amount) to my hair and also use it on my body to help with excema. Oil is GOOD for your skin, don&#x27;t be afraid to use it. The bottle lasts several months and the price is great. I was looking at another pure argan oil at sephora and this is almost a third of that price. I will continue to use it.</li>
    <li> I use this every night. I&#x27;ve priced other pure Argan Oil and this is the best deal for the money.</li>
    <li> I like it for my skin and hair.  First time I have used this product  and I&#x27;m not disappointed.</li>
    <li> Received this oil in amazing speed, tried it on my hands as I had read that it would not feel greasy and did not know how an oil would not feel greasy.  It is true, it soaked in and did not make my hands oily.  I tried it on my hair and it feels great, no oily hair either.  Last but not least I tried it on my face and I really like it on my face as well.  Great Product and great company very quickly got my product in good shape.</li>
    <li> I use this oil for day and night for my face . It&#x27;s the best ever. Never use creams now just this oil.</li>
    <li> This oil has made such a difference!!  I am a heart patient, 68 years young, and it has done wonders for my extremely dry skin due to meds.  My hands feel a lot better as does the dry scalp.  This is well worth trying.  When you rub it into your scalp at night there is no sign of oily hair.  Remember, a little goes a long way.  Fabulous product!!</li>
    <li> I am 61 years old and don&#x27;t fall for the ads promising to erase wrinkles. However, wrinkles do appear more visibly on dry skin which is a problem most women my age have. Pura D argon oil is absorbed instantly and makes my dry skin soft and dewy looking which does diminish the apperance of wrinkles. I love this product and will continue to purchase it.</li>
    <li> So before I bought this product I was searching for a really good moisturizer that wouldn&#x27;t make me break out or irritate my skin. Because my skin is already oily I didn&#x27;t think it would be a good idea to use oil on my face. However, I was wrong. The first night I put this on my face it felt great and gave my skin a shiny glowing look. I woke up the next morning and my face still looked great and it appeared to clear up some of my previous pimples as well. I have heard really good things about this product so I am really excited to continue using it and see more results!! I have yet to use it on my hair but tonight I will be doing so. Don&#x27;t doubt it, buy it!!! :)</li>
    <li> This is the first time I ever used argon oil (this is my second bottle from this company), it&#x27;s the best thing I&#x27;ve ever used for my hair and skin!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can&#x27;t go wrong with this product!</li>
    <li> Great oil use it for hair and face</li>
    <li> This is my second order. I will continue to chose this product because it has EVERTHYING I am looking for: PURE not &#x27;diluted down&#x27; with a mix of other oils.  It&#x27;s ORGANIC. It&#x27;s  COLD PRESSED.  All this ensures superior quality and less contaminants.  COMPETITIVE PRICE. And I  got this order on sale. I even used it on my Irish Setter before a show.  His coat was spectacular.  He got 1st in his class.</li>
    <li> Check this out.  It&#x27;s pure and nourishes my skin. Simply read the label. Been using pure Argan oil for 3-5 years. It is amazing especially under eyes.  Also, warmer temps due, that means sandles. Great on heels and dry skin patches. I use Argan oil, literally from head to toe. Never again will I pay  big bucks for exact same thing at the pricey department store cosmetic counters.</li>
    <li> I use the oil all over my body after a shower and gently message the oil onto my face. It does not leave me feeling oily or messy. My skin on my face is soft and the fine lines and wrinkles look alot less obvious.</li>
    <li> I used a different brand argan oil before and compared to this product, I really like the pura d&#x27;or oil. It has a very light earthy scent, not overempowering at all. It also absorbs very well in the hair and skin, not leaving a greasy feel. But beware, a small amount goes a long way, no need to overkill. Very good price for  very big bottle that will last you at least 6 months, depending on the amount of daily use. I would highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> This is perfect for moisturizing dry skin and helping prevent wrinkles.  I am 70 years old and I love this plus you get alot for&lt;br /&gt;the price.</li>
    <li> Not too oily, absorbs into your skin quickly. Even with naturally oily skin, this oil doesn&#x27;t create too much facial oil throughout the day.</li>
    <li> When buying a product like this reviews are what I go to first! This product is amazing! It&#x27;s USDA organic which means a lot to me when buying a product online. I&#x27;ve been using this oil for a few months now and love the results on my hair. It has repaired many of my split ends. I love using it on my face, hands and other dry areas. I even use it on my lips. This bottle is huge for the price. I was paying the same price for .5 oz. I&#x27;m so happy I found this product and will be trying more!!</li>
    <li> Wonderful product.  Works great and has a very nice mild scent.  Shipping was fast too.</li>
    <li> This product is great!! in just two months of using it my hair is 10 times healthier and has even started growing faster! I will never stop using this product. It has a perfect bottle so you get just what you need out and one bottle has lasted me over a month, I can&#x27;t say enough how much I love it!</li>
    <li> I love anything all natural and not filled with chemicals, so we  have such high hopes for this oil that we ordered 2 bottles. I heard it&#x27;s good for you on the Dr. Oz show, a mom said she used it for years, and had beautiful silky shiny hair.</li>
    <li> I was a but apprehensive about spending $20 but I was very happy with the results!! A little goes a long way.  This oil has completely changed my skin. It has a natural glow to it. I use it on my face and hair everyday. It&#x27;s been doing wonders for my dry hair as well. I love this product. I will definitely be buying it again!</li>
    <li> I ha always used a good quality moisturizer daily on my face, and when the product I used for years was no longer available I looked for&lt;br /&gt;a good quality, natural alternative. This oil works well for me for this purpose and I&amp;#34;m convinced it has a beneficial affect on my skin.</li>
    <li> I have ombre bleached hair so the ends were way beyond repair. I thought this would help since I&#x27;m trying to dye over the bleached parts and definitely noticed how much softer my hair felt after a week&#x27;s use. Also makes blowdrying a lot shorter. Be careful not to use too much at once and start from the ends up.</li>
    <li> excellent price. this is a great deal as you get more for your money.....everywhere else the price is $30.00 to 40.00 for 2oz...and its not even organic.....It&#x27;s awesome on my skin and hair I love it will buy again and again</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t been using argan oil for long, but I really like it so far.  It has a nice light scent and it makes my skin really soft.  I&#x27;ve heard it&#x27;s the best moisturizer to use for your face since it&#x27;s high in vitamin e and doesn&#x27;t clog pores.  I&#x27;m excited to see the long term results.</li>
    <li> i originally used an argon oil from a different company, the price was 3 x as expensive as this one.  overall, the only differance i notice is the smell.  this product does not smell as much as the other one.  other than that, they seem like the same product.  cant beat it for the price.</li>
    <li> This argan oil is the best one I have used yet. It really makes your hair get that healthy look that you want. It doesn&#x27;t have a strong smell so I really like that about it. It really keeps your hair from getting all frizzy and keeps it looking like you take good care of your hair. It also releases the perfect amount of oil every time you press the squirter. It does not waste a large amount. The only ingredient is argan oil, so I don&#x27;t have to worry about having so many chemicals in my hair. It really is a great treatment.</li>
    <li> I live in Denver and the air here is very dry. I&#x27;ve been looking for a product that will help my poor dehydrated skin for years! This product does that. It is a bit oily when first applied, but after about 10 minutes, it soaks in and keeps my skin looking and feeling moisturized. I don&#x27;t wear foundation, so not sure if it would be good under makeup, but I definitely will continue to use this oil. A couple of drops worked into the ends of my hair has been nice too, just be careful not to use too much.</li>
    <li> I loveee this Argon Oil. It&#x27;s great as a face moisturizer and you can use it on your cuticles, hair, eyelashes, lips, pretty much anything.</li>
    <li> Product with natural and organic components are the purest of all skin care. I love to take care of my body specially my skin. I always read labels and make sure the product is plant base or natural. We don&#x27;t need to buy expensive stuff if all the benefits of skin care are already in this simple tiny bottle of argan oil. I just love using Organic.</li>
    <li> Although I bought this for my hair I feel I really didn&#x27;t need it after using their shampoo and conditioner ... But I swear by it on my hands and next and skin!!!!</li>
    <li> Truly amazing...just received this wonderful product...I am 70,people think I am 55 and have great skin but I do have some fine lines on my face and body due to me loving the sun.I sprayed a small amount into my hand and then  spray a bit of water applied to my face...the fine lines seem to disappear...purchased this product to use only on face and body as my hair is perfect,thick long and silky,few grays and never dyed</li>
    <li> Got this based on good reviews, as a less pricey alternative to Josie Maran.&lt;br /&gt;How wrong I was. It&#x27;s thicker and not as smooth as Josie Maran... and not as lasting...&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s too thick for hair (makes it look greasy), and too thin/rough for hands and nails (so no lasting effect)&lt;br /&gt;Many other oils (including OPI&#x27;s Avocado Oil) work much better.</li>
    <li> A lovely product. The natural scent of the oil is pleasant and not overpowering. I am very pleased with this so far as a face moisturizer, it provides deep moisture for my very dry skin.</li>
    <li> honestly, this really didn&#x27;t do anything to my hair. it also smells really gross. Luckily there is a pump, if not this product would have been a total mess. it leaves my hair feeling really greasy and dirty instead of soaking in like its supped to. i do not recommend this one. I&#x27;ve actually been using the garner oil instead and like its price and abilities so much better!</li>
    <li> First off, it&#x27;s animal cruelty free and it&#x27;s 100% pure argan oil.&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to see results, but I will say that two pumps covers my entire face without being greasy. I could walk out of the house like this! The scent is mild, and the bottle is glass. The pump applicator is awesome.&lt;br /&gt;After one night of applying it to my face, my  skin was immediately silky smooth, I couldn&#x27;t stop touching my face lol!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Give it a try! For $20 at 4 oz of pure argan oil, how could you not?&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll be updating this as I use this a while longer, But so far so good!</li>
    <li> Best Argan oil EVER!!!!!! I have used different Argan oils but NOTHING like this stuff.. This oil is so light and smooth.  I use it on my face and it eaves my face so soft. This will be the only Argan oil I will ever use</li>
    <li> I love this product! I use it everyday on my face as my moisturizer, before I put on my make up. It makes my make up smooth onto my skin and look beautiful the whole day. Then after i take my make up off, i put it on again before bed. I wake up with my skin feeling great everyday! It its a wonderful price for the amount of oil you get. And you really only need a few drops, so it lasts a long time. It also smells nice, I have ordered others that don&#x27;t smell as good. Will buy again and again.....</li>
    <li> Nice product my skin is soft, nice smell, not greasy absorbs nicely......goes a long way...many uses nice it is a natural product</li>
    <li> I have coarse hair and don&#x27;t using conditioner too often. This is natural so I don&#x27;t mind using each time after showering while my hair is still wet. It&#x27;s pretty remarkable how much softer and more manageable my hair is now.</li>
    <li> I purchased this Argan Oil product for a dear friend who doesn&#x27;t have access to Amazon in the exotic, tropical location she lives in. She had heard of Argan Oil and wanted to try it, because although she has taken excellent care of her hair during her life, now at middle age, her hair is drying out, becoming brittle and prone to thinning. On her very first use of the bottle I gave her, the results for her have been nothing less than fascinating. Now after two weeks of use, the dryness is gone, a natural soft waviness has returned to her hair, and there is only normal shedding to worry little about.</li>
    <li> I use this oil in my long beard to keep it shiny and to help prevent dryness and the associated tangling and breakage. The dispenser cap makes it very easy to refill the little spray-bottles I use to apply the oil. There&#x27;s a pleasant aroma in the oil already, and I add a small amount of essential oil of cedarwood for extra fragrance. I have no difficulty applying a little bit of light styling wax after the oil has been brushed in.</li>
    <li> Just got my order of Pura d&#x27;or in the mail.  I love it.  This is the 3rd bottle that I have ordered. I use it on my face, hair, hands, cuticles, elbows and feet.  It goes on smoothly, and absorbs very quickly.  I use it liberally and use it every day, one 4 oz bottle lasts me about 6 months easily.  This is the best Argon oil that I have ever used, I would not hesitate to order this again and again.</li>
    <li> I have tried many Argan oils and this is by far my favorite ......and I just re-ordered it again.  It is the real deal - pure, no fillers or perfumes and works GREAT!  I mix it in with my body lotion after showering and also put it on my hair to control frizzies.  It is also very affordable.  Wonderful product :)</li>
    <li> Pretty awesome!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Skin tone is obviously so much better than before! Scars are gradually reduced too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One little adverse note is that I feel a little greasy after applying. But overall would highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t really find it helpful for my hair(no detangling/smoothening) or skin..infact I have breakouts every time I use this on my face..I&#x27;ve never had any acne/pimple prior to using this oil.. Maybe its just me but it was not worth the money I spent on it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m using this oil on my hair, and it has given it a very silky finish. I&#x27;m also using it on a skin condition I&#x27;ve had for three weeks, and it appears to be improving quickly...better than the doctor-prescribed medication.</li>
    <li> This is such a wonderful product ,so easy to apply and non messy application. It gives a wonderful finish to your hair.</li>
    <li> My son and I both have very curly hair and this stuff tames the frizzies really well.</li>
    <li> This is the best product for skin and hair.</li>
    <li> This argan oil is amazing!  It is 100% pure. I use it for my hair and my skin. It does not leave a greasy film like other products.  Most argan oils have a strong oil odor but this one is virtually odorless.  It has made my hair silky soft, and my skin is like butter.  It is a great value for the amount you get.  I will continue to use this product!</li>
    <li> My wife saw this on QVC and this is a WAY better version of what they offer. She loves it.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping. Large 4oz bottle. Love the pump vs dropper. A little goes a long way! Doesn&#x27;t leave greasy residue, absorbs quickly. I feel good about putting this on my face and body.</li>
    <li> I had heard a lot about this oil, and I decided to try it for my face and my hair. I&#x27;ve been on a natural organic kick, and I was tired of using toxin-laden beauty products. It&#x27;s a necessity that my beauty products are organic and untampered with, so that was the reason I bought this brand to begin with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For Hair: My hair  (I&#x27;m a Nigerian natural) gets very dry, and I was looking for the right product that would make it not feel crunchy, and feel moist from the inside out to the touch, not just greasy. Do you understand that feeling? Anyway, I&#x27;ve been using Argan Oil for the past few days, in conjunction with ingesting organic coconut oil as a supplement. I just use it on damp hair, a few drops on my palm, or on dry hair, a few drops mixed with a bit of tap water and just rub it on. Right now, my hair doesn&#x27;t have that fake moistness, where you know that the oil is just sitting on top but underneath your hair is still crunchy. I can actually feel that the actual strands are not parched. As I rub my twists in between my fingers, I can feel that my hair feels silky and elastic. Yes that&#x27;s the word, elastic. It&#x27;s not dry at all, nor does my hair feel greasy in the least bit. If I got these results in just a few days, I can only imagine what kind of health my hair would be in a month or two from now. I intend to continue using Argan Oil on my hair indefinitely, because I&#x27;ve found something that agrees with my hair. My sister came over yesterday and said my twists look healthy. I don&#x27;t think anyone has ever said that about my hair before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My Face: Since I&#x27;ve only be using this oil for a few days, I can&#x27;t comment too much on the overall effect it has had on my face, except that my face also feels more moisturized but not oily. I want to see if my face will be more balanced or radiant in about a month. I also want to see how it will work in the colder months. I&#x27;ll definitely update my findings, but so far so good. Silky feeling skin that actually feels moist from the inside out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I love this product. They shipped it fairly quickly, and that was great. The packaging was professional, and they seem to really stand behind their product&#x27;s authenticity and performance. I&#x27;d recommend this oil for parched hair.s moist from the inside out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I love this product. They shipped it fairly quickly, and that was great. The packaging was professional, and they seem to really stand behind their product&#x27;s authenticity and performance. I&#x27;d recommend this oil for parched hair.</li>
    <li> I have natural curly hair &amp; the greys were really starting to show.  Since I have started to use this, my hair seems healthier &amp; the greys don&#x27;t seem to show thru as much.  I&#x27;m sold &amp; when I need more I pray I can still get it thru Amazon.  Yes, I highly recommend Pura d&#x27;or.</li>
    <li> LOVE this product! I am currently on accutane for acne and my face was so incredibly dry and because of the dryness, wrinkles were starting to appear~ my mom introduced this to me as she is using it to help with wrinkles.  At first it feels greasy, but after a few minutes the greasiness is gone and my face feels AMAZING!!! I can see myself using this for a very long time!</li>
    <li> Makes hair more piece-y, and moist, so does the trick. I like that it is cheaper than other products and it is pure Argan oil. Be careful, don&#x27;t use more than a few drops, or hair will be greasy.</li>
    <li> this is great on skin,love this item.</li>
    <li> I decided to try this product after I got tired of spending an excessive amount of money on the Josie Maran argan oil at Sephora.  This is just as good as, if not better, than the JM product, and the price does not include the &amp;#34;celebrity markup&amp;#34;.  The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it the full five stars is because it didn&#x27;t seem to do much for my hair, but as far as skin care, it is incredibly moisturizing and anti-inflammatory.  I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Just what I was looking for - 100% argan oil, in a dispenser that didn&#x27;t get all over the bottle but allowed me to get a small amount out at once.  The dark glass bottle protects it from light &amp; keeps it from spoiling as quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is my first time using argan oil.  It is exactly as I hoped for - very moisturizing, easily absorbed.  I&#x27;m using it after washing my hands, as it is really healing my cuticles but also not getting my keyboard greasy.  Further - it doesn&#x27;t seem to break out my skin or make my hair oily, so if I put my hands on my face/in my hair it doesn&#x27;t mess it up.</li>
    <li> Love this product.  Really helped clear up some eczema on my face within a week.  Also feels great on the skin as a moisturizer.  Love it!</li>
    <li> The shipping is from prime, so the package arrived very promptly, and it comes nicely packaged by the company in a canvas drawstring bag. The pump top feels solid and sturdy, and the oil itself is exactly what it says: pure organic argan oil. I use this for moisturizing my hair after showering, and it definitely reduces frizz and makes my hair healthier. It also smells delicious, which is a nice plus. However, I feel like any other argan oil would do this equally as well, and unfortunately I lack the resources to test the contents of the bottle and verify that it is 100% pure organic argan oil. This makes it hard to rate such the product, but I gave it 5 stars because the oil itself certainly works as I wanted it to, and the included bag and solid construction of the bottle are a nice added touch.</li>
    <li> Works well as a general purpose moisturizing / nourishing oil. Has a thick texture, and is not greasy or sticky.</li>
    <li> Plan to use for some time to comments.  The oil is easily absorbed by my face and hair.  Will order again.</li>
    <li> This is the first time I&#x27;ve purchased Argan Oil and I LOVE it! This particular brand delivers a very pure form of the oil with no fillers which is what you want with Argan. I&#x27;ve been using it on my face (as well as hair), which is helping with fine lines and it also helps with break outs so I&#x27;ve read. Incredible product, and great service with this seller!! I will be coming back for more :)</li>
    <li> Just as expected !! PCOS can be a real headache it can make u even go bald... But this is the best solution ever... Thank u Miracle oil</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. I use it on both face and hair. It keeps my fine, curly hair soft and healthy. It&#x27;s very moisturizing- I use it at night on my face. It doesn&#x27;t clog pores at all, just leaves everything healthy looking.</li>
    <li> I have long curly hair and this argan oil is a dream come true! My hair definitely tends toward dry ends and flyways and this oil does the trick! I have also been pleased to find that I can use it on my face without any problems. It moisturizes well and does not leave it oily. Wondering if I buy it by the case!</li>
    <li> So far, I am not as impressed as I expected. I think I might be using too much of the oil because it&#x27;s not getting absorbed into my hair. I&#x27;m a little confused because I only used 2-3 pumps and my hair is very long (up to my bum) but the oil is still in my hair since yesterday so.. Idk I&#x27;m gonna still try to use less &amp; edit this review when I see a change.</li>
    <li> Even the tiniest amount made my hair super greasy, and I have hair to my hips! Dry skin only.</li>
    <li> Normally use the brand Moroccan Oil (the light version.)  Ran out so I thought I would try something different.  Upon first use, it seemed like this was not a thick or rich as the MO brand.  I normally use like 1.5 squirts.  For this, I did 3 pumps.  After the fact, it turns out, that 3 was even too much.  So I guess I need as much as this as I would with normal MO brand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pura d&#x27;or argan oil has no perfume or odor from what I can tell.  Which can be a pro or con depending on perspective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would definitely buy again especially seeing as the price versus MO brand is quite a bit different.</li>
    <li> Love this product- use it every day.  I use it on my hair- give amazing shine, and does not weigh down.  Love it love it love it!</li>
    <li> I was really reluctant about trying this product as I have never heard of it.  After just one use I was really amazed at how silky my hair felt.  I did try it on my heels as well but it didn&#x27;t have the same effect as other users claim.  But I am still happy as I purchased it only for use on my hair.  I will continue to use it and will be recommending it to my friends and family.</li>
    <li> I use this to treat my acne scars. I have been using twice a day for almost a month now.&lt;br /&gt;It removed most of the redness on my face. I love and will keep buying more.</li>
    <li> I wanted to try an Argan oil product at the encouragement of my wife.  I was skeptical about putting oil on my face, but read the reviews and decided to try the Pura D&#x27;or Argan oil.  After several weeks of use, it actually has caused my skin to reduce its oil-making.  I don&#x27;t have to remoisturize throughout the day like with other skin moisturizers.  This Pura d&#x27;or Argan Oil has a pleasant scent, and very easy-to-use pump.  My wife was using a more expensive brand, but the bottle had a dropper that screwed onto the top and I would accidentally knock it over when I was in a rush.  The other brand was less product at a more expensive price point.  I am thoroughly happy with Pura d&#x27;or&#x27;s organ oil, and will be a loyal customer.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried several brands of argan oil products, and of them I have found Pura D&#x27; Or&#x27;s to be the best in quality &amp; value.</li>
    <li> seems to control not get rid of fungas</li>
    <li> I purchased this product along with the Organic Shampoo to prevent hair loss and I also used it for my face. I really love! It compliments the shampoo well. Not harsh and definitely leaves my skin looking &amp; feeling healthy.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried a cheaper organic Argan oil and couldn&#x27;t even finish the bottle, it smelled so bad. THIS one, though, is one I&#x27;m sticking with. There&#x27;s NO bad smell, it&#x27;s so smooth and I love applying it.  It doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy residue, but absorbs quickly.  I use it on my face every night, and every morning. The order was fulfilled so fast and I got it right away.  Great product - great vendor!</li>
    <li> I first bought Argan oil from a local store and liked it, but found it to be expensive, not organic and in a plastic container. Then I discovered Pura d&#x27;Or and was so happy to find that your oil is organic, in a beautiful glass container, in a great bag covering, and for half the price. I began using your wonderful oil not only on my hair at night when I go to sleep, but also on my hair when I go to the beach. The quality of my hair now is so much healthier, and I live in Florida where it is hot. Then I started to use the oil on my feet before I go on long walks and that has really helped moisturize my feet. A great product, I am on my third order, completely satisfied. Thank you. Alexandra Leifschutz</li>
    <li> I like this brand, no unpleasant smell..I use this oil for my face and hair..I saw great results in just two weeks. Overall, this is works amazing and will continue to repurchase this product!!</li>
    <li> A versatile oil.  I&#x27;ve used it to moisturize my face after washing, as well as for chapped lips.  Works great!</li>
    <li> I have tried a number of different oils and argan oil is the only one that has corrected my dry skin problem.  Since discovering this oil, I have tried a number of brands.  Pura d&#x27;or is a top shelf brand for the best price I could find.</li>
    <li> awesome product for face</li>
    <li> OMG. I read all the reviews. Always knew Argan Oil was great for hair but for nails and skin too?! I ordered this, used it under my eyes and voila! Dark circles and small creases are literally disappearing day by day. I&#x27;ll post a before and after when I hit one month. This oil rocks and the price is competitive.</li>
    <li> I Really love this product, as I was skeptical to buy it as I have tried other face products for dry skin with no results until I bought this product. It really works and being Scandinavian I have very dry skin and hair. WOW, what a difference as drop of the Pura D Oil makes, I&#x27;m in love with it, thank you for making such an amazing product.</li>
    <li> I just received this product yesterday so I&#x27;ve only used it twice, but I can already see a difference! My face is smoother and less dry and I can already tell that the lines in my face are smoothing out! I will definitely continue to use this product daily and I will update my review in a few weeks.</li>
    <li> I have coarse, wavy hair, and this product has definitely improved its health and reduced frizz. I use a few pumps on wet/damp hair after I shower. Went for a haircut after almost a year &#x3D;/ and the stylist commented that my hair looked healthy with minimal split ends. So I think it works!</li>
    <li> After only a few days, my skin is more clear and soft. I had some dry patches on my face and theyre not completely healed, but there&#x27;s a signifigant improvement. If they keep healing at this rate, they&#x27;ll be gone after less of a week of using this argan oil. My hair is also less frizzy and way more manageable. One warning though - don&#x27;t use a lot! I have very long thick hair, so the first time I used it in my hair, I put 2 pumps in. The pumps are really small, but it made my hair look greasy on the ends where I applied it. One pump is enough! Overall, this is one of the best beauty products I&#x27;ve ever purchased. And since I use such a small amount, the four ounce bottle is gonna last a long time, so it&#x27;s worth the investment!</li>
    <li> We go this bottle for the first time and surprisingly my wife loved it. Her hair loss became really less. I hope fully stop but we have to see.</li>
    <li> This product did not do much for my 4C hair but my nails look absolutely awesome.  The chips, cracks and roughness is all gone.  You would think I went for a professional manicure each week.  Would definitely purchase again.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s very good! I recommend it! It doesn&#x27;t have strong smell.</li>
    <li> bought this oil as a facial moisturizer to use at night, it definitely moisturizes, skin is still soft in the am.  I&#x27;m a little weary of using it during the day, as I live in a very sunny climate and prefer to use an spf moisturizer, but after a month plus of nightly use, I feel my skin is softer and my complexion is a bit more even. I&#x27;ll eventually explore other uses for it, but currently like it as a facial moisturizer.</li>
    <li> the oil seems pure from the description. it does however seem to go on rather &amp;#34;thin&amp;#34;. i do not know if this is due to it being more pure without added silicon based products. the price seems fine for a pure product.</li>
    <li> I have been using this daily for 3 weeks on my face and love it. I have sensitive skin that&#x27;s prone to breakouts and dries out easily so I use lotion every time I wash my face. I like to put it on my lips and eyes in the morning and at night. It leaves my skin supple and soft actually plumping it. I like to use it on my face about every other day as well. It worked great for suntanned skin and I&#x27;m looking forward to seeing how well it&#x27;ll work in the winter my face dries out. I&#x27;m 36, and am hoping this&#x27;ll be good for anti-aging since it keeps my skin more moisturized than lotion alone.</li>
    <li> Just received my bottle of argan oil &amp; it is amazing! Goes on smooth &amp; leaves my skin soft &amp; moisturized without any irritation.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product for use on my hair. I have two words for this product...LOVE IT!  It gives my hair a nice shine without weighing it down.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical when I read other reviews calling Argan oil the &amp;#34;magic oil.&amp;#34; I&#x27;ve used organic cold pressed oils before, specifically sesame and coconut oil, as well as beeswax / honey products as alternatives to face cream / lotion / hair scalp treatment. The argan oil really was different. Applying a few drops and massaging it into my scalp made my hair look really full, dark, and shiny when it dried, without looking greasy or weighed down (like with other oils). I also tried using a few drops on my face in lieu of face cream and it gave me a &amp;#34;glow&amp;#34; all day. It&#x27;s been pretty humid this week so I can&#x27;t tell if it&#x27;s the oil or the humidity, or both, but I&#x27;m definitely feeling pretty good about this purchase and looking forward to seeing the results when it starts to get colder / dryer around here. If you&#x27;re wondering about argan oil I&#x27;d recommend trying it out! It&#x27;s not cheap, but it&#x27;s been worth it for me.</li>
    <li> Received the bottle and use it right away,I like how my skin feels after I put it on, so soft and smooth. I might try other related product.</li>
    <li> I love this product! I&#x27;m a 22 year old female and have been using pure argan oil for about 2 years now, and settled into using this particular brand a year ago. I use the oil as a daily face moisturizer and sometimes use it in the ends of my hair. I started using argan oil because I read that it heals acne as well as scarring, and boy does it! Another factor was aging prevention, I&#x27;m getting to the age where I really need to be mindful of taking care of my skin, preventing aging and wrinkles and this product will definitely help with that. Not only has it improved my acne and scars, it has improved the overall texture and complexion of my face, it also gives a great glow. As for my hair, I get compliments on my hair constantly about how shiny and soft it is, it has really minimized split ends and breakage. I like this particular brand because its organic and cold pressed, has a pump, and I also enjoy the scent. Great product, I highly recommend. It would also be great for a gift.</li>
    <li> Love what this has done for my skin and my hair!! Great for dry skin and frizzy, dry hair. It has become part of my nightly skin care routine.</li>
    <li> Love this product I use it everyday on my face</li>
    <li> Pura d&#x27;or argan oil is pure and organic, has a nice light fluidity. I use mainly on face, neck and chest but at times i use as well as body. Sometimes I apply liberally and massage into my skin until skin is warm. Taking a warm damp facecloth, I remove the excess and my skin is exfoliated gently and nourished.</li>
    <li> Love it! Makes skin and hair super soft.</li>
    <li> I love this oil, although I&#x27;m not done with the bottle I&#x27;m already planning on purchasing another. I&#x27;ve been using it to on my face and my hair. I&#x27;ve noticed an improvement in the texture of my skin. Although I don&#x27;t have acne I&#x27;d noticed a few fine bumps if I looked REALLY closely but since using this oil on my face when I look really closely at my skin it&#x27;s super smooth. It also absorbs well and has helped to begin fadding blemishes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use it on my hair (African American) before I blow dry and I will use some if I feel that I need some oil on my hair after I flat iron but don&#x27;t want to weigh it down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pump on the bottle is also very convenient.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a natural moisturizer for some time, and I&#x27;m thrilled to have found Pura d&#x27;Or Organic Argan Oil. I use this argan oil on my face, body, hair and cuticles, and it is light, absorbs quickly and moisturizes all day without leaving a greasy residue. I knew this was a keeper when it kept my face moisturized through a 12-hour flight -- something that no other moisturizer has accomplished! I really like the packaging, as well. The pump bottle is easy to use and prevents spills, which I&#x27;ve experienced with a sample from another brand. Fantastic product!</li>
    <li> I believe this is about the six bottle of Purador Argan Oil I have purchased.  I love it!  I use it every morning and night on my face and neck.  Recommended it to my daughter, and she also uses it daily.  It is one of my must have items.</li>
    <li> A friend of mine who works in skincare had recommended Argan Oil - her skin&#x27;s amazing so I thought I&#x27;d give it a try. I was a little worried that applying oil to my face directly could result in pimples but tried anyways. I&#x27;m glad I did, I love this stuff! My face feels amazing. I have eczema too, so I put a little on an irritated patch of skin and it seems to be helping. I&#x27;ve tried in my hair which is also quite good. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Love this product for dry skin.  This works great overnight on hands &amp; nails to elevate split &amp; cracking cuticles.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure if the seller or the brand is at fault - but this is not 100% argan oil as it is advertised. Its smell is almost mechanical-like and it leaves a greasy residue. I also ended up breaking out because of this oil. I have tried pure argan oil before and this is not it. Pure argan oil will not leave a greasy residue on your face, instead it absorbs in your skin after a few minutes. It has also never caused me to break out before. Now, this will moisturize well if you use it on your arms and legs (which is what I intend on doing with the rest of the bottle so it does not go to waste) But I will not buy again. I had to give one star because the product is either fake or the company that makes the oil is falsely advertising. If up you are looking for true 100% argan oil I recommend not buying on amazon. It&#x27;s very easy to get fake products unfortunately. If you&#x27;re looking for a reputable argan oil - I use Josie maran and buy from a reliable beauty dealer in my area (not on amazon).</li>
    <li> My friend recommended this spray to me so I bought it and now I use it almost everyday. Recommend this to anybody who has frizzy hair or dry skin.</li>
    <li> Have been using this on my face and my hair.  Just a drop or two will do well.  Hoping that it is helping to keep the fine lines at bay. (?)  And does work well as a &amp;#34;lessen the frizz&amp;#34; treatment for hair (but just one or two drops and start in the back at the base of the neck first) ... else the hair will feel oily.  I have oiled it well a few hours prior to shampooing ...and my hair doesn&#x27;t look dry anymore.  I will buy more.</li>
    <li> First of all, a little background: I&#x27;m a 42 year old female, in an industry that&#x27;s mostly young and male. If you can&#x27;t keep up, due to your age, sadly you&#x27;re out the door.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So for years, I&#x27;ve been dying my hair a deep chocolate to suppress the creeping inevitable signs of old age, and using all kinds of other products in my hair to keep it looking young and healthful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It works, for the time being, but when I let my hair down and actually feel it in front of the bathroom mirror, I hate how dry and dull it feels! I can&#x27;t describe the feeling precisely...the closest thing would be when you get something sticky in your hair, and try to brush it out - that&#x27;s how my hair feels. That, or how hair feels after it&#x27;s had too much hairspray (even after a bath it feels this way.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyways, that was all a very long-winded way to say that I have bad, dry, dull hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On to the review: I love this stuff! Trust me when I say I&#x27;ve tried everything on the internet to get my hair more silky: mashed avocado and olive oil applied to the hair? Tried it. Linseed oil? Tried it. Really expensive Garnier shampoo that supposedly has avocado oil? Tried it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the only oil that doesn&#x27;t leave my hair actually feeling &amp;#34;oily.&amp;#34; It took away my brittle, dull feeling and hair texture after the first application. I rubbed a couple of drops on my palms, and smoothed the pura d&#x27;or oil from tips to roots of my hair before going to bed, per the instructions. When I woke up, I couldn&#x27;t believe how shiny my hair was! I don&#x27;t even think I had such shiny hair when I was 20!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know the long-term solution for my dryness would probably be to treat my hair better, but since that isn&#x27;t possible right now, this oil is the next best thing. I&#x27;m going to use this pura d&#x27;or to breathe some life back into my deflated hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only one complaint: 4 oz is tiny! But the bottle does go a long way, since you only need a few drops for big effects. So this isn&#x27;t a big deal, and doesn&#x27;t affect my rating of this amazing product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t tried it on my face yet, but this is next on my list, since I sometimes have dry facial skin during winter. Where the oil touched my hands though, I had soft and supple skin (even for a 42 year old.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HIGHLY RECOMMEND this product! It saved my hair and possibly my job! :)ts.

    <li> I like the fact that this was an organic product with no added artificial chemicals or addictives.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This has been working miracles for my skin, this is a must have for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I always had dry skin on my body. It was just a part of my routine I&#x27;ve neglected but after being envious of celebrities&#x27; glowing skin on their body, I went to look for something to get that look. I found it in this. I had bad experiences with other oils (coconut, olive) being too thick and not easily absorbable. But this absorbed nicely (will still wait at least 5-10 min before jumping into bed). Sometimes when I need extra exfoliation, I use this oil with some sugar and scrub where needed. My bumps on my arms have been disappearing slowly.  My skin feels super smooth. My skin goes from dull to luminous!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a must have for your routine!</li>
    <li> ive tried many of these oils before and this one i can say is the best!&lt;br /&gt;the oil absorbs quickly, to a dry finish and looks very natural..im only using this product for couple of weeks and now my skin looks great and shiny....this is the best!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve read so much about hair care, and what it takes to keep it growing strong. I&#x27;m all natural and this is one of my staples. I use it to mix with my homemade hair creams and I also use it daily on my skin. My hair is always moisturized when I use Pura D&#x27;or Argan oil, and I get lots of compliments about the shine. My skin has also improved. It used to be dry and cracked, especially my heels and elbows. Now, I don&#x27;t have that problem anymore. I just have soft glowing skin, and it&#x27;s great. Good buy, and much better than other brands of Argan oil I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
    <li> After years and years of hair loss I decided to try something new. After being given Pura D&#x27;or by a friend the changes in my hair have been amazing. Ive completely stopped losing hair and I cant be any happier. after years and years of horrible hair loss this product has made wonders in my life. Thanks Pura D&#x27;or</li>
    <li> This stuff is awesome! I&#x27;ve used it before for my skin as a moisturizer after I wash it. And I noticed a difference in my skin within a week, my skin was brighter clearer, just overall felt and looked great.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve heard about Argan oil for a long time and finally decided to try it, and I love it. I like the pump, which works so much better... and I since I&#x27;ve gotten it, I&#x27;ve used it on my hair, which makes it nice and shinny and soft and on my face. I have never thought to put oil on my face which is prone to breakouts, but it works so well, and has actually cleared it up and softened my wrinkles. I am in my mid thirties and this has helped make me look so much younger and have gotten many compliments. I already stay out of the sun and take care of my skin and already everyone thinks I&#x27;m in my 20&#x27;s but this product made me look and feel so much younger than before. I will use this for the rest of my life. I just mix a few pumps with my daily moisturizer Olay for sensitive skin, on my face and neck and it works wonders. My skin is glowing.</li>
    <li> This is a great organic product that truly does what it claims to. As I have dry skin, this is a product that greatly appealed to me and that I was eager to try. Now, I am very happy I did, as the results have been great!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As the product is organic, there are no chemical preservatives or additives, and as an added bonus, there was no real odor/perfumy type smell. I also did not react in any way to this oil, as sometimes I have heard rashes can develop, but Pura d’Or Argan did no such thing. It is full of vitamins and antioxidants, and usually used in hair shampoos and conditioners. Make sure to just use one drop for starters, that is all that is necessary!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price of Pura d’Or Argan Oil can appear to be a bit much at first glance, and might give you second thoughts to purchasing it, however you shouldn’t be. You only need a small amount to see results, so it will last a while, and it moisturizes skin and conditions hair extremely effectively. I wish I had known about this product a long time ago, and it is definitely worth trying out. I know it will work for you!</li>
    <li> I was skeptical about this product but after much urging by my girlfriend, I tried it.  It took a week but I can definitely feel the difference now.  Great little product.</li>
    <li> I use just two pumps of this, rub it between my hands, and comb it through the ends of my hair with my fingers after I get out of the shower and while my hair is still damp. When it dries, my the ends of my hair feel soft, not dry and dead like they used to. I occasionally put it on dry hair, but I have to be careful to use barely any or it will look oily. I also made the mistake the first time I used it of putting quite a bit through my wet hair and putting it up too close to my roots. My hair was horribly oily the next day...oops. Lesson learned. Use two pumps max, apply it lightly to the ends, let it dry. It&#x27;s perfect for what I wanted it for, which was treating the ends of my hair so they would be soft and moisturized. The ends of my hair have never felt this good. I bought this instead of Moroccan Oil (which I have never tried) because it was expensive and hard to find. I read that Moroccan Oil was mostly argan oil anyway, found this, and bought it. I am very pleased with my purchase.</li>
    <li> This Argan Oil is everything the seller promises and more.  It works wonderfully for both the skin &amp; hair.  I definitely will be reordering.</li>
    <li> I love this Argan Oil.  I use it every evening after washing my face.  One would think that oil would cause pimples, but it does not.  It actually will heal anything on my skin such as mosquito bites that I scratched too much.  I love that it&#x27;s pure too with nothing else in it.</li>
    <li> AMAZING PRODUCT. Let me just start off by saying that I have been blessed with thick, coarse, and dry hair ever since birth. This was even BEFORE I started dying my hair every one and a half to two months. Since I&#x27;m also such a makeup addict, I watch many videos on YouTube. I come across many products that promise &amp;#34;soft, hydrated, and replenished hair after ONE wash,&amp;#34; but none of them do the job they claim to do. Each time I buy new hair products (shampoo, new conditioners, oils, etc) I stop using heat on my hair whether its blowdrying or styling, just to test out the product. I have also tried the very famous Macadamia Oil Deep Repair Mask which is RAVED about on Youtube. It DID NOT do the job, which is why I am so proud to say I found the Pura d&#x27;or 100% Pure &amp; USDA Argan Oil. I rub it on after washing my hair (AFTER it is dried a bit with a towel) and let me just say that this oil MAKES the very difference in my hair lately. My hair has felt softer after two uses! Even my sister has commented several times saying that my hair looks WAY healthier, and it is NO LONGER frizzy. I would recommend this product to anyone who has hard to tame, dry, and years of damaged hair. The price is just a bargain for what it does. TRUE HEALING.</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B004Z209HS Pura d&#x27;or 100% Pure &amp; USDA Organic Argan Oil (4 fl. oz.) For Face, Hair, Skin and Nails]]  I was in Morocco several years ago and was introduced to Argan oil. Bought several bottles from a women&#x27;s cooperative in Essaouira which was made on the premise. As the end of the last bottle came near, I began to search for an organic Argan oil that was of equal quality to that which I bought in Morocco. I knew that it was going to expensive, as it was also costly at the co-op. I tried THE big name store that sells THE big name, very expensive Argan oil. Unfortunately, it didn&#x27;t have the nutty smell I was expecting, nor was it as fast to absorb into my skin. I began my search again, and decided to try Pura d&#x27;or and voila...fast absorbing, nutty smell and taste, and organic by USDA standards. Priced very fairly and in an excellent spray bottle for ease of use. I use it every morning on my face after a shower, and nightly before bed, and every time after I wash my hair. My skin and hair are happy again and I will remain a loyal customer. I am thrilled to have found Pura d&#x27;or organic Argan oil, it is the ONLY product I will use on my face!</li>
    <li> I was loosing my hair, my scalp was irritated and someone told me about these products. I bougth the anti hair loss shampoo, the blue conditioner and this oil and now I feel happy enough with my hair. I would definitely buy it again!!!</li>
    <li> Very good oil.  A little heavy for my face, but it did not cause me to break out.  Perfect for skin and hair.  Absorbs quickly and is odorless.  Also a very good value...</li>
    <li> I bought a 4 oz. bottle of this in the hopes of it replacing my after-shower facial and hair products and I am completely satisfied! When I first used it I applied about three pumps of the product to my hair because it seemed like a small amount but when my hair dried I realized it was actually way too much - so a little bit really does go a long way. My hair is thin, curly, and frizzy because I live in a humid environment and when I apply the right amount of it, this product makes my hair perfectly soft and makes my curls actually look good unlike any other hair product I have purchased. Not to mention it is pure Argan Oil meaning I am no longer putting a bunch of crazy chemicals into my hair either! Absolutely love and recommend this product.</li>
    <li> This is a multi-purpose oil,  I use it on my face, hands, arms, hair.  A few drops go a long way, and do not leave greasy feeling on my skin.</li>
    <li> I waited a few weeks before posting this review in order to say honestly how it works.  I use this after every shampoo, and once I have towel dried my hair. A couple squirts in the palm of my hand and rubbed in to the ends of my hair.  It does an amazing job at keeping my ends looking healthy.</li>
    <li> Love the light feel of this oil  for my skin.</li>
    <li> I have not used other argan oils to compare, but I am quite pleased with this one.</li>
    <li> The product is good and really moisture my skin.</li>
    <li> Pura d&#x27;or argan oil has truly been a godsend! After so many years of hair coloring, nail polishing, and sunbathing for years, this oil has fully restored the condition of my hair, skin and nails. It absorbs very well without leaving a sticky feeling but will put a nice sheen to your skin and hair getting rid of any ashy tone. This is truly an amazing product that i will be using for many years to come. Thank you Pura d&#x27;or!</li>
    <li> I use this for everything!</li>
    <li> Amazing Argan Oil, I use it as an all over body oil and for the ends of my fine hair to give it density and shine.  Terrific product.</li>
    <li> I love this argan oil. The oil arrived within two days, was well packaged and is what I hoped it would be. The smell is wonderful and the oil is light which is great for my natural hair texture. I haven&#x27;t used it for long yet but I&#x27;m confident it&#x27;s a product I&#x27;ll keep using as I already use it everyday now.</li>
    <li> Great oil! and very affordable..</li>
    <li> The argan oil goes on my face smoothly. I&#x27;ve only been using it for about a week, and I&#x27;ve noticed that it doesn&#x27;t moisturize the dry area around my mouth too well. Other than that, the product has made my skin immediately smoother, and it feels like it&#x27;s moisturizing well in other areas. I also use this product for my under eyes, hoping to help with the wrinkles and dark circle. Time will tell if this product truly works for those things. Right now I&#x27;m satisfied with the condition of my skin. Note that I use this once a day, and at night I use a different product for my eyes and face.</li>
    <li> The only thing I&#x27;ll use on my face and sensitive skin. Great for sensitive, allergy-prone and combination skin. Deeply moisturizing, very light and not greasy at all. I always get compliments on my healthy glow ;) I love this product for face, body, cuticles, etc. and carry a small vial of it with me everywhere I go - my secret weapon. I&#x27;ve tried many other brands and found Pura d&#x27;or to be the cleanest, purest and best Organic 100% Argan Oil out there.</li>
    <li> I won&#x27;t buy any other argan oil. I mix a few drops with hyaluronic acid and it moisturizes and smooth&#x27;s out the fine lines on my face. I use it for the ends of my hair after every wash before styling. The ends of my hair are strong and never frizzy. Love, love, love this product</li>
    <li> appropiate for what I ordered it</li>
    <li> I am very happy with this product. I use it after I clean my face every night and have seen the different in just a few days. My skin is smoother and the tone is more even.  I began to use it in my feet and handsaws well and if I put socks and gloves after for about 1/2 an hour, I can&#x27;t believe how soft they feel.  I unedited for my hair as well. Very versatile for so many uses. Iwill defiantly continue using this product.</li>
    <li> I bought this because my hair was too dry from hair color and pool water. was really bad, I was thinking to cut a lot. I put a litter the first day was soft and shine. Love it really work. I also used on my face and hand, make really soft. I said yes buy it will work for sure. Thank you!</li>
    <li> I had been using Argan oil for some time now and tried different products as well. I am using this product for the first time and I feel like this one is a very reliable product so far.</li>
    <li> I have heard Argan oil  referred to as liquid gold.  I am a 60 yr old with extremely dry skin.  In addition, very naturally curly hair (now color treated :) I have tried every product for my hair, and every ointment (as my husband calls them) for my body.  since I have been hearing so much about Argan  oil, I decided it was time to give it a try.  After reading many reviews, I ordered pura d&#x27;or.  Wow!  I tested it on my hands and cuticles, then my hair, and then my face. Dry and cracked heels.....oh yea...&lt;br /&gt; ..try this girls......you won&#x27;t be sorry!</li>
    <li> Excellent hair moisturizer, gets quickly absorbed by hair and it makes it look shiny and healthy.  Not need to blow dry.  Highly recommended</li>
    <li> Great oil. Has not lead to any breakouts on the skin. Great on face and can even use as massage oil. Bottle was smaller than expected, but a little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> makes my skin and hair look great and I like that its organic</li>
    <li> Been using this for a few week and just love it will be ordering more</li>
    <li> Does make skin moisterized.</li>
    <li> I prefer this over the Josie Maran Argan Oil that first introduced me into adding Argan oil to my twice daily moisturizing routine. 4 fl oz for $20 is such a steal! This product keeps my skin hydrated and bouncy while not hurting my wallet! I am sure to keep using Pura d&#x27;or after finishing my first bottle!</li>
    <li> Pure &amp; natural…I use 2 pumps worth on my face every night as my moisturizer and 1 pump in the morning under my makeup.  I apply 2 pumps to the ends of my hair after I dry it to condition and control the frizz.  LOVE IT!!!!</li>
    <li> It worked amazingly well on our split ends. One application made a difference! One drop is more than enough, so it will last a long time. For skin and face it is a bit greasy, but hasn&#x27;t made me break out. It&#x27;s too soon to know if it will make me look &amp;#34;younger,&amp;#34; but I am going to keep using it.</li>
    <li> Very light weight, great for natural hair holds moisture.!</li>
    <li> Was skeptical when I heard about argan oil from a friend, but I&#x27;m a convert! I use it head to toe in place of lotion and love how soft it leaves my skin, with no greasy residue.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical at first, especially with the numerous brands to choose from. Sure you might find a cheaper brand out there, but the quality is what you pay. If you do a littlw research, you&#x27;ll know what is premium quality Argan oil, and what is diluted oil from heat and other process used for distraction.&lt;br /&gt;The results are the greatest proof.&lt;br /&gt;I say, this gives Josie maran a run for her money.</li>
    <li> I like this product just as much as the more expensive product sold on shop at home tv channels.  I use it and my skin looks good and an old scar on my hand is slowly disappearing- bonus!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this oil. I use it as a face cream hand lotion and a hair conditioner.  The price is excellent and it has a soft gentle smell.&lt;br /&gt;Its pure, not mixed with Dymethicone or any other chemical  Great product for the money!</li>
    <li> I love this argan oil.  I&#x27;ve been using this brand for almost 2 years and my skin looks great.  I&#x27;m 68 years old and my husband tells me I don&#x27;t look my age.  I owe it all to this oil.</li>
    <li> It leaves hair oily...I sometimes use it before I blow dry, or to leave it on during the night after my shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have not noticed significant improvements though.</li>
    <li> My hair is now silky smooth and soft because of this product :)</li>
    <li> This is my 2nd bottle I purchased from AMAZON. I was skeptical about this oil last year (I was the first time user and first time bought it from AMAZON) but when I started using on my face and my body, I found out I did not have to use any other facial cream or oil. My face and body stayed moist for very long time. Let me give you an example. I fly long distance all the time. In the airplane, the air inside the plane was very dry and made my face and nose very uncomfortable. The worst thing was my hair after 14 hours flight, got a lot of statics, dry and  dandruff felt all over my cloth :( ... So, I thought if this oil can keep my skin moist, why don&#x27;t I try it on my hair and nose too. Guess what! I was just so surprised how this wonderful oil did to my hair and nose. No more dryness on my face and nose inside the plane and my hair..radiant! I now quit using any hair conditioner after shampooing, in stead, I condition my hair using Pura d&#x27;or 100% &amp; USDA Organic Argon oil before washing. Sometimes, I just go to  sleep with the oil on my hair and wash it off the next day. The result is ....you try it and you will know! SUPER SOFT AND AMAZING! Fast shipment from Amazon is another plus. Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> Very light and goes on like a dream. Great value for money and am using it on face and body right after a shower.</li>
    <li> Amazing product. I love using this in my hair.  It gives me shine and body and life.</li>
    <li> This is one of the best oils I have come across that moisturizes both skin and hair. It even cured my severe sun burn in 3 days.</li>
    <li> Great product and excellent customer service! Made my hair stronger</li>
    <li> Smells good and is not greasy. Love this so far. Great price for what you get as well.</li>
    <li> I have been using a lot of products. I should say, Argan oil is one of the best. I not just apply it on the skin, but also on the hair. I used to have wrinkles between eyebrows, it appears lighter after I apply the oil every night. My hair is also become nicer and brighter than before. I do love this product. Just one thing, in winter time, it&#x27;s better to apply lotion after you use this product, any brand of lotion is ok, it will buffer the Argan oil and will make it easy to be absorbed by your skin, according to my personal experience.</li>
    <li> My wife loves this stuff and uses it every day on her face and hair.  Just wish it wasn&#x27;t so expensive!!!!</li>
    <li> I Immediately starting seeing results for my psoriasis after 19 days of use. You have to apply 3 times daily to really see that its working, but other than that I love it!!</li>
    <li> Use it once a week, lasts so long.  Makes my hair so soft!  Pretty great price for a great product.</li>
    <li> Great for super curly hair! Use it every morning out of the shower, and it controls the dryness of the curls.</li>
    <li> As a man I&#x27;ve never been into very many cosmetic items, but my wife swears by this product and got me to start using it. I love how soft it makes my skin and hair and it has been helping a lot with the occasional skin blemishes I have on my back. Thank you Pura D&#x27;or!</li>
    <li> Feel quite happy after using it for half year. It moisturizes my face pretty well while not feeling too oily. I also used it on my hair from time to time without any conditioner and my hair looks shiny now. Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> This product is excellent.  Comments from my Wife:  It is a silky smooth oil..a little goes a long way.  It does not leave your face feeling greasy.  It is excellent for dry winter skin.  It does not have a heavy fragrance.  My wife loves the product and said that she can really notice her skin being a lot tighter and drier when not using it.</li>
    <li> This organic Argan Oil is wonderful. I use it like a moisturizer for my face. I use it before putting makeup, and at night before going to bed. I also use it on my hair. After I wash my hair, and it still wet, I put a small amount on the ends.&lt;br /&gt;Also, you can use it to strengthen your nails.</li>
    <li> I have very long thick hair and Argan oil is all I have used to keep it healthy.  This is the first time I bought this product and for it to be this price plus pure??  GREAT PRICE.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tip:  I actually use the suave infusion hair serum/gel (which is only about $5) and add one pump of this into it...and perfection!  this helps if you have really long hair....those that do know how easy it is to go through the expensive stuff quick!</li>
    <li> I use this oil under makeup and also on my hair; its never heavy and it has made a big difference in my hair.</li>
    <li> Having used many products to treat my overly dry hair and not having much sucess.  I used this product and much to my delight it greatly improved  the texture of my hair.  I am very happy to have tried this product and happily recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> I think this works great on my skin.  I mix one pump of this with my oil free moisturizer to keep my skin nice and soft in the winter.  At night I use multiple pumps to get my skin extra hydrated overnight (would be too greasy for daytime).  I was disappointed when i tried scrunching this in clean, damp hair (in an effort to get beachy waves) it made my hair crunchy - like to where i wanted to wash it out immediately.  However, for my face mixed with my moisturizer, i think it works great!  No wrinkles have been erased, but what can you do!?  :)</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t usually review things that I buy, but this product was better than I expected. It&#x27;s true that the solution doesn&#x27;t feel oily at all. It leaves my skin smooth and with a certain glow and it keeps my hair silky and shiny. I do find it disappointing that the bottle itself does not have the USDA organic label (it&#x27;s found on the information sheet). SO there is no real way to tell if the product itself is USDA approved, but I&#x27;ll let that slide.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Notes:&lt;br /&gt;-use pea size amounts&lt;br /&gt;-apply when needed&lt;br /&gt;-keep in a cool and dark area (avoid sunlight)&lt;br /&gt;-18 month shelf life when opened</li>
    <li> This stuff is great. I have psoriasis and use this all the time to relieve the irritation. I&#x27;m nearly out and looking to reorder soon. Repeat customer, always!</li>
    <li> Have been using argan oil for a few years now and usually use the Certified Organic brand...which is also good. The best part about this brand is the intoxicating smell &amp; the dispenser that allows you to only pump out what you need.</li>
    <li> This oil is very absorbable and a little goes a long way. Good quality &amp; value. Really helps with winter dry skin.</li>
    <li> This argan oil does not have any smell at all! Means its deodorised. Sure its cold pressed, then it undergoes a process to take the smell away, its call deodorisation. And deodorisation is usually done with heat!. I have been using argan oil for years and decided to try this due to the reviews. I have used really good argan oil and for me, the raw and pure extra virgin smells slighty nutty, after all, argan oil is from argan nuts.  I am not talking about the eatable argan oil, the eatable one is from roasted argan nuts, the smell is very strong and this is not for cosmetic use. I think for the cosmetic benefits, I prefer it to be undeodorised, to be pure and natural.  Sure, a lot of argan oils on the market says 100 per cent argan oil, meaning its only argan oil, and organic, meaning under certain conditions it has been grown or harvested,  but then, what process did it go through in the factory after that?  Eatable argan oils are also 100 percent argan oils and certified organic, but its not good for your face as it has been roasted, stripping it of the healing properties.  If you are using this for your hair, then, its fine.  For face, me personally, I prefer not deodorised. Deodorisation is a process to take the nutty smell away so that the end result it smells of nothing.  This process strips of not only the smell but some of the healing, restorative property.  I love argan oil, as I said, have been using argan oil for years already.  But most of my argan oils were purchased in Europe, in Germany and France. This is the first one I have purchased here from the States.  Will be trying other brands.</li>
    <li> Received a couple days ago and so far noticed it moisturizes hair, face, and nails really well.  Wish I would have found out about it earlier.</li>
    <li> Amazing! Works really well!</li>
    <li> One of the best products ive ever used. Pura d&#x27;or, it beyond the best brand. I will never use another brand.</li>
    <li> This oil is heavy textured.</li>
    <li> My sister gave me a bottle of this Pura d&#x27;or product while I visited her in San Francisco. I use it as a facial and neck moisturizer morning and night and find it leaves my skin feeling smooth, and protected from the dryness of the Phoenix, AZ climate. Even though I have an oily/combination skin, the oil is light, and my foundation slides on evenly. When I used the last of the oil, I hoped Whole Foods carried the brand, but they did not. I purchased another organic argan oil, but find it more liquidy. I also prefer that Pura d&#x27;or is in a spray to better control how much I use at one time. Was glad to see that Amazon carries this product!</li>
    <li> I purchased this product and use it for my hair and face.  My hair feels smooth along with my face.</li>
    <li> This oil is not greasy at all and I love that you can use it all over your body. I have extremely frizzy hair and this stuff is awesome! I also use it on my dry hands, face and even bikini line after I get a wax down there - helps to moisturize and help with redness!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A little bit goes a long way and this will last a long time!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product! I was intrigued when I saw Josie Maran on QVC with her argon oil, so as I usually do, I checked Amazon for a comparable product at a better price. After reading the reviews, I decided to try it. I am amazed at how good my skin feels and the improvement I&#x27;ve seen after just a few uses! I recommend it for anyone!</li>
    <li> Makes my hair and skin feel so soft!</li>
    <li> makes any part of my skin feel and look great without any scent ! my neck and face is smooth not greasy and no breakouts.</li>
    <li> If there was a 10-star rating I would choose it. This oil is a god-send. I&#x27;ve read about all the benefits of argan oil (it containing Vitamin E &amp; Omega &amp; anti-oxidants). I was searching for pure form &amp; ordered this Pura d&#x27;or. I used it on my skin for moisturizing &amp; it immediately absorbed into the skin. No sticky feeling or grease soiling clothes. It gives the skin a healthy sheer shine. Doesn&#x27;t clog pores. It doesn&#x27;t irritate the skin (&amp; my skin is very very very sensitive). I noticed less splinters near nails. It has a mild nutty smell that is barely noticable.&lt;br /&gt;This oil arrived on time, well-packaged (bubble-wrapped &amp; well-protected). The pump dispenser minimizes spills. Price is good since pure argan oil is known to be expensive &amp; hard to get. I would recommend to everyone looking for healthier moisturized skin specially those who have sensitive skin. I will contain to get more from Pura d&#x27;or as long as they keep these high standards.</li>
    <li> This product really helped my dry split ends. A few drops is enough to give shine and restore hair.</li>
    <li> I bought this oil to try on my very dry scalp.  I will write an update on my findings!</li>
    <li> This product is amazing! i have been using it for 5 days and already notice the difference. My skin and hair are healthier and beautiful.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing and much cheaper than the other brand name argan oil. It leaves my skins smooth and well nourished, and my hair never felt shinier. Absolutely love it and fully recommend this product to anyone who&#x27;s interested!</li>
    <li> I have tried many oils for my face and this product is the best! I love the way it makes my skin feel, not greasy like coconut oil makes it. Not heavy either.... Thanks Pura d&#x27;or</li>
    <li> best oil product&lt;br /&gt;Give you a smooth skin and no messy smell</li>
    <li> This is more than I expected! My hair is visibly &amp; feeling better than it has before. Even my skin feels healthier and it glows. I also use it for my nails and I have seen improvement. It is an all around great product. I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> This is my first time using it. I bought it after reading all the reviews and am very happy with my purchase. I&#x27;ve been applying it on my face, just a few drops and massage for a minute. It helps with hydrating my skin, which tend to be dry.  I also have sensitive skin and it does not irritate skin at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve also started using it on my hair. It will take some time for me to see the results. I will come back after a few months to update this review.</li>
    <li> Pura d&#x27;or 100% Argan Oil is a miracle product that I consistently have used over the last 2 years and I use it all over. I use a drop or so on my face as a final moisturizer, which I find balances out my oily/combination skin. I use about a squirt of oil into my curly/wavy hair to soften, tame frizz, and help with bounce. On wintery days when my skin is feeling itchy or irritated, this is my go-to product to rub into my skin after the shower. When my cuticles/nails are in need of extra attention I use Argan oil on them to nourish and fill in any cracks. I LOVE LOVE LOVE Pura d&#x27;or and recommend it to all my friends and family. You won&#x27;t be disappointed with such a wonderful oil, it&#x27;s a must have in my house.</li>
    <li> The Organic  Argan oil is the best product for my skin I have ever used. And now I have stopped spending money on expensive designer face creams which are useless to compare to Organic Oil. It helped a lot with my psoriasis also. I recommended this product to my daughter, who is very picky with cosmetics. And now she uses it twice per day: In the morning - under her make up and in the evening as a night cream. It is a perfect product with a reasonable price. I am really happy to find it on a huge cosmetics market. Thank you very much!</li>
    <li> I have recently discovered Argan Oil.  Curiosity propelled me to buy some at TJMaxx, and I liked it even though it was labelled &amp;#34;for hair,&amp;#34; and Argan Oil itself was way down on the list of ingredients.  I do like the idea of the oil for hair, but mostly I became interested in it for the face and neck, as I am a youthful nearly-38, and would like to hang on to that!  I explored Amazon, and found this little gem in one second flat.  Liked the price, liked the reviews, purchased it, and can&#x27;t imagine life without it now.  I suppose I will have to check in every decade or so now to update, but it sure feels like The Elixir.</li>
    <li> I really like this product.  I&#x27;ve used it on both my hair and my skin/face.  It&#x27;s perfect for when I want to blow my hair straight (i use just a little). It&#x27;s not quite heavy enough if I want to wear my hair curly or natural.  Love it as a nighttime moisturizer when my face is feeling super dry.</li>
    <li> I like this product, although my eyes are very sensitive and seem to be irritated when I apply the oil too close to them.</li>
    <li> LOVE that it&#x27;s USDA organic certified, 100% PURE cold-pressed &amp; unrefined Aragan oil! No parabens or nasty fillers. So hard to find, especially at a good price. Thank you, Amazon!&lt;br /&gt;My daughter uses it in her bath to soothe her dry skin/eczema. I use it on my hair and it smooths out the frizzes. I did initially think b/c it&#x27;s a thin consistency I needed a few pumps, but found out one does the job after my hair looked too oily. (hair is shoulder-length, thin and curly) No complaints here! It does say to use a &amp;#34;pea-sized amount.&amp;#34; Shame on me for not reading the directions. :)&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll be back for more...</li>
    <li> Excellent product! I have been using it for about 2 weeks and I am very pleased with the results. It moisturizes my skin beautifully, and has a light nutty scent. I have been using Argan oil for many years now, and I can easily differentiate good products from great ones. This is sure a winner.</li>
    <li> My wife and I absolutely love this oil.  We use it all over us.  My wife has dry hair and she uses it to moisten and make her hair shine.  Probably no has ever written this but it is the best personal lubricant ever!  The smell is neutral and so men can use it.  We can&#x27;t say enough about this product.  Would recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for two weeks and it makes my skin so soft and smooth. Great product for the price.</li>
    <li> I was introduced to this product by my friend who is a hair stylist. Her hair always looks so healthy, when I asked her the secret which she didn’t tell me but  gave  me a small amount of this in a tiny little bottle which lasted me for about  10 days . I used it everyday and found my hair texture improve soft &amp; silky. Upon pleading her she told me about Argan oil and said to buy only this pure oil as there are many who claim it to be pure. I simply love it.  I have spent tons of money to get the results I wanted but never have I found a product to be so good to be true. Using it is believing it.</li>
    <li> I love this Argan oil. It has helped my daughter with her eczema and has many uses. It really is a head to toe oil.</li>
    <li> This is great stuff!  My only real complaint is the bottle/pump.  I have to pick the bottle up and tilt it over my other hand.  If I don&#x27;t do that, it just dribbles down the bottle.  It would be nice if it had a more standard pump.  It also doesn&#x27;t have the feature of turning the pump head to one side to &amp;#34;close&amp;#34; it.  I&#x27;m a little wary of traveling with this because I can&#x27;t close it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Those issues aside, it&#x27;s a fantastic moisturizer for skin.  One tip though: if you&#x27;re using it for facial moisturizing, spray it into one hand and use the other to apply to your face.  If you just rub it into both hands and then apply to skin, it absorbs very quickly and you won&#x27;t get much on your face.</li>
    <li> softens skin as promoted.  i use on bottom of feet, on nails and cuticles, and under my eyes.  i also mix a few drops with body lotion for entire body.</li>
    <li> I am so glad to discover argan oil and have been using it for about 2 weeks now.  I use it on my face and hands.  A little goes a long way!  I have noticed softer skin with immediate use.  It is also great for reducing dryness.  I&#x27;ve been using it on an area that is prone to dryness and it has reduced it dramatically.  This is a great product (natural moisturizer) at an awesome price!</li>
    <li> Light and non-greasy, this is the first argon oil I&#x27;ve been able to use as a body oil without staining my clothes. It&#x27;s organic, fair-trade, and more economical, to boot.</li>
    <li> This is my second bottle of pura d&amp;#34;or. It is comparable to josie maran  argan oil. I use on face, hair, skin and cuticles. It gives hair a nice shine and control. I have dry skin and you have to use so little and it is not greasy. It soften the cuticles.And seems to help with wrinkles on my face. At least it works as good as anything else I have tried. And the price is right.  One bottle lasted me almost a year so it&#x27;s economical to boot.</li>
    <li> Great for my thinning hair and pimply face with oily skin. Using it in a dry desert environment but I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;ll do well in a humid tropical environment as well. Love it!</li>
    <li> I like to mix this oil with my Eucerin body lotion to just make an extra rich lotion since I have very dry skin in the winter.  The pump handle is very convenient and I appreciate the careful way it was packaged.  The only caveat - I wish it smelled like the Moroccan Argan oil, but since this has no added fragrance, I guess that explains why it doesn&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> I bought some of this for my mom who has trouble with eczema.  She has tried all kinds of lotions and creams including prescriptions.  She was skeptical, but after the first application she could feel the improvement.  She continues to improve daily.  I tried some on my fingernails as they get dry and brittle.  So far my cuticles have stayed softer throughout the day, and my nails feel smoother and firmer.  This stuff is so versatile!  It is not greasy, and a little goes a long way.  It will get a 5th star if the improvement continues.</li>
    <li> Amazing!! I&#x27;ve always had a combo oily/dry skin and I can never get the dry spots moist enough without making my face look greasy. I use this and it helps dry up my T-zone that&#x27;s oily while still keeping my dry spots moist! I&#x27;ve never been so happy with a facial product in my life I can&#x27;t believe I didn&#x27;t discover this sooner! Also, I tried this because I had a sample of the expensive $100 argon oil and loved it but couldn&#x27;t afford to keep using such an expensive oil. This one does EXACTLY what the expensive stuff did the only difference is that it&#x27;s a bit more liquidy but that doesn&#x27;t change how the product works on your skin what-so-ever. DO NOT waste your money on the expensive stuff it&#x27;s not worth it and it&#x27;s a huge ripoff. And keep in mind that when you first put it on, you may feel like you put a bunch of grease on your face but don&#x27;t worry because within minutes it dries up and looks great. I put makeup over it and after an entire day I don&#x27;t have a greasy face like I used to. It&#x27;s wonderful!</li>
    <li> I have been putting this oil on my feet for about 10 days.  My feet were as dry as a desert.  They are almost  as soft as a baby&#x27;s now. I have been using it on my face as well.  I am 64 years old and hoping for a miracle.  My face is a lot softer. Wrinkles a little less noticeable.  No miracle yet; but I am hanging in there.  I like this product.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff--a great moisturizer for my entire body, including my face, and can be used on the ends of my hair. Just as good as the Josie Maran stuff but soooo much cheaper!</li>
    <li> AmazonReview: Fast delivery. Nice packaging and great instructions. I have used it on my face, neck and hair. LOVE the results. Face is clear, small pores, makeup goes on much smoother, and the texture is younger and more supple. My hair was damaged from motorcycle riding. This oil nourished my hair and brought back the shine and smoothness. LOVE this oil!</li>
    <li> I was impressed with the quality and care of packaging and product.  This company seems to care for the environment as well.  The product was surprisingly light instead of a heavy oil and made my skin feel moisturized, smooth and healthy looking.</li>
    <li> Excellent product for damaged hair renewal!</li>
    <li> This has been incredible for my hair and skin. I love using it on my shoulders and arms after sun tanning. Sometimes my skin after some sun can be sensitive and even seem damaged... But after some argon oil my skin seems to heal and feels refreshed. Thank you!!</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t used this product extensively, but it came as described and was a good price. Would consider buying from this product again.</li>
    <li> I like that it&#x27;s pure argan oil and organic. The dispenser is ideal for getting out a few drops of the oil, which is all you need to cover a large area of skin. It smells good, and it isn&#x27;t too greasy. I think it&#x27;s most effective if you put it on after showering.</li>
    <li> Arrived quickly. Love the pump bottle as compared to other brands that use an eyedropper. Consistency is light and absorbs into my skin quickly. I did note a slight musty odor when I first dispense the oil, but it dissipates quickly and the oil becomes odorless.</li>
    <li> My husband is going through chemo. His skin is like sandpaper and his scalp bothers him because of the skin flaking off. After exfoliating in the shower, I put the oil all over his skin. It has made him feel a lot better. Even the heels of his feet have a much better feel and appearance ( they were awful). Excellent product.</li>
    <li> I just received this oil in the mail, and so far so good. It has nearly no smell, unlike other pure Argan oils I&#x27;ve tried. This may indicate that it is fresher than others. Also, it is a good amount for the price (4 oz as opposed to other brands that sell 2 oz for the same price). From what I&#x27;ve tested of it so far, it absorbs well and leaves the skin incredibly soft. Can&#x27;t ask for much more. Do yourself a favor and get this brand, you won&#x27;t be disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: I am giving 4 stars instead of 5 because my bottle came less-than-full (by an eighth, approximately). I am contacting the seller about it, but the product itself is great!</li>
    <li> I like this oil. I use it as a daily moisturizer. It absorbs into skin very well, and doesn&#x27;t make it look oily, so I use it on my face. Even my husband uses it.</li>
    <li> Having used many brands of Argan oil, I can say Pura d&#x27;or&#x27;s delivers on quality and price. I don&#x27;t have a particular method for testing quality between brands, but I am very happy with how my hair and skin feel and look after using it. Shipping via Amazon prime is quick and the packaging is by far the best I&#x27;ve seen.</li>
    <li> Amazing all in one product for face body and hair</li>
    <li> This is simply the best argan oil that I ever used!&lt;br /&gt;I bought this primarily for my hair and I am so happy I picked this one.&lt;br /&gt;This is organic&amp;100% pure. price is good. I recommend this product to anyone who wants to manage his(her) hair more easily.</li>
    <li> As I hit my mid sixties thinning drier skin on my arms and it&#x27;s crepe like appearance became a challenge. A few drops of this pure argan oil in the morning completely softens all day. Love it!</li>
    <li> Did not work as well as Moroccan oil for my hair.  However, it felt great on my face and under-eye area at bedtime.</li>
    <li> I am Latina and soak up this light weight oil when I use it on my face I love it because it is not oily.  A little goes a long way, I had my last bottle for over a year and was concerned about it&#x27;s freshness but it always appeared clear and without an odor.  I use it on my hair to give it an extra sheen. The shine does not disappear and softens my generally dry and curly hair.  I absolutely love this oil, it is worth every cent.</li>
    <li> so much nicer to have the oil dispense with the pump, you can control  the amount better than a dropper and no wasting it.  Nice oil, very light, pleasant to use.</li>
    <li> Good quality Argan oil. Just recently purchased a bottle of this product and so far has been satisfied with its quality.</li>
    <li> I love this oil and put them on my face my hair its not to grease just what I&#x27;ve been looking for I don&#x27;t usually do reviews for the stuff that I buy but this stuff really deserve it review</li>
    <li> I can say without any hesitation that this is the best argan oil in the market. I have been massaging it on my face and neck for 10 days. I can see the results straight away. My skin is soft and shiny now. It did wonders to my dry skin. It also healed razor bumps on my face. I would recommend this product without any hesitation.</li>
    <li> Excellent for improving moisture of skin.</li>
    <li> I use this oil for general softening of body skin AND around nails and cuticles. It&#x27;s also terrific to use on the hair (1-2 drops only) for shine and taming fly away strands.</li>
    <li> As I&#x27;m getting older, my skin&#x27;s getting dry and the lotions and creams aren&#x27;t enough. We used to try to steer clear of oil, but for me, it&#x27;s the answer. My skin looks much better. I use the oil in the morning and at night ... Just a little rubbed in completely ... And then my normal regime of moisturizer, foundation, etc. I&#x27;m going to continue to purchase this. Much better price than oils aestheticians sell.</li>
    <li> Got this product fast and like it so far.</li>
    <li> This product was way too light, almost like not putting anything on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I applied and left it stand on my hair for an entire 24 hours. After washing my hair (which is long and mostly straight, a bit frizzy after washing)... It made no difference at all!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had to use the other products I normally use... :-/</li>
    <li> This Argan Oil is amazing!!!  I had been using coconut oil on my color-treated and damaged hair, hoping and waiting to see results, with no success!  I purchased this Pura Argan Oil and the results were immediate.  My hair is finally more nourished, less frizzy and just looks more normal, the way it used to!  I also use it on my dry fingernails and love the way it feels.  I highly recommend this oil to anyone needing help with revitalizing their hair or nails and I&#x27;m looking forward to discovering more uses for this miracle oil!</li>
    <li> I gave this product to my daughter because she wanted it and she absolutely loves it. She&#x27;s had her eye on this product for three months now and I finally decided to buy it for her. Since she received the product today, we can&#x27;t say for sure how amazing it is, but with one use my daughter already talks about how her hair feels better. This bottle is truly &amp;#34;liquid gold.&amp;#34; It&#x27;s incredibly versatile and it can be used to treat and repair many parts of the human body--skin, hair, nails. Best part is, $20 for the 4oz bottle! That&#x27;s crazy insane. Best purchase I&#x27;ve made this month. I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Great product.  I use it on my hair and skin</li>
    <li> This product helps my skin to feel soft and clear with daily use and does not look oily.  It is also good for my hair, i.e., I use it before I shampoo for 30 minutes and then add a little bit to my conditioner.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried a few different brands of Argan Oil and this rates at number 1!  It&#x27;s not heavy or smelly like other brands.  Soaks immediately into the skin leaving it feeling very soft.  If the price stays under $30, I will order it again and again.</li>
    <li> I received my Pur D&#x27;or Pure argan oil and love it! I have tried other brands as well and this one is great! I am in my 40&#x27;s and have always had compliments up until a few yes ago.....I have been using this for a few weeks now and I have received several compliments. I&#x27;ve beeg getting those, &amp;#34;your a GILF comments&amp;#34; !!!! Thanks Pur D&#x27;or Pure argan oil, you&#x27;ve given me my youth back!! Would recommend to anyone!!</li>
    <li> This is a wonderfully soothing argan oil for much less money than most.  This brand has helped to greatly reduce my acne, almost completely eliminating it.  I am in my late 30&#x27;s and have had acne since my teen years.  I have discovered in the last few years that oil actually helps acne instead of the other way around.  So far, argan oil seems to be the best.  I use it in the morning after washing my face, and at night before bed.  It absorbs easily and does not leave a greasy look or feel.  I can even wear it under makeup.  My skin looks calmer and smoother from using this product.  I also use after washing my hair while it is still damp just on the ends (careful not to use too much, only need a few drops).  No more noticable split ends or fly-aways.  So glad I found this and will not be switching.</li>
    <li> My skin has never looked better and it is soft, soft, soft. Plus the fine wrinkles around my eyes are less noticable. Rub a small amount of Pura d&#x27;or on dry cracked heels for instant relief. If I could only have 1 beauty product, this would be it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about a month now. I add a drop mixed with my hair gel and it leaves my hair silky smooth. My curls are softer and less frizzy.&lt;br /&gt;If I strighten my hair, I use some straight on the ends and it makes the hair shiny and smooth.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my daughter as a gift and tried some on my hair before I gave it to her.  I liked the lightweight feel that didn&#x27;t weigh my hair down.  What I really liked was that it moisturized my dry, course hair without giving it a greasy appearance.  I currently use an argan oil pump bottle for applying moisturizer to my hair before straightening with an iron.  However, it&#x27;s hard to get all the grease off my hands and the stuff I use leaves a residue on my iron.  This spray oil did the same job, but no greasy hands and no residue to clean afterward!  Nice :)</li>
    <li> This is absolutely a miracle product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a guy, and I absolutely hate putting anything on my skin. Lotion, cream, whatever - nope - my skin just doesn&#x27;t like it, and I hate the feeling of having something on my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After reading about it for years, I decided to give Argan oil a shot. I hopped on Amazon and this appeared to be the top selling brand, and now I can see why: THIS STUFF IS AMAZING! I&#x27;ve been putting it on my face multiple times per day, and the light acne I&#x27;ve had on my chin for years, has almost completely cleared up. WOW. It doesn&#x27;t get much better than this. Better yet, within a few minutes of putting it on, I cannot even tell it is there! Absolutely NO ODOR whatsoever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While I also enjoy it in my hair, female family member have said it makes their hair too greasy, but YMMV.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You owe yourself trying this - there is NOTHING better.</li>
    <li> This product is really awesome.. I use it a few times a week, haven&#x27;t had any problems with it so far.. I&#x27;m very glad I gave this stuff a chance!! Now my hair looks better &amp; face doesn&#x27;t  feel so dry anymore! Yayy thank you!!!</li>
    <li> I finished Argon oil brand I was using before trying Purador--we are experiencing cold, dry weather conditions; it feels like a better product to me.  My skin feels softer, better protected from cold weather, more healing.</li>
    <li> one drop is enough.It makes my hair healthy and strong.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s my daily moisturizer and I couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
    <li> Absolutly love this product! Makes a wonderful facial moisturizer and is also good for your hair. Will definetly be buying this product again.</li>
    <li> Excellent product! I love the way it makes my skin feel and makes my hair soft and shiney. I have been using this product for about a year and don&#x27;t miss a day using it. I no longer have to use all the other expensive facial products that I have been using for many years. I guess you could say that I am in love with this &amp;#34;liquid gold&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> A friend gave me a little of hers to use and it has been amazing! I use it on my  face and it&#x27;s not feeling dry anymore , and  I have psoriatic scalp, and it&#x27;s very much relieving those symptoms! It&#x27;s also the best product I&#x27;ve ever used for defrizzing my hair- leaves it shiny and absorbs instantly without leaving it greasy.</li>
    <li> I love it!  I&#x27;ve used another brand of Argan Oil, but when I compared, it isn&#x27;t 100% pure.  I&#x27;m loving this and the way it absorbs so quickly.</li>
    <li> This argon oil has replaced all other natural oils that I once used. It&#x27;s perfect for my skin and my hair! Light and moisturizing.</li>
    <li> Great moisturizer and great under makeup.</li>
    <li> This is my second bottle of argan oil and I love it. I use it on my face daily.  My skin feels soft and not greasy.  I would recommend this product to everyone.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve purchased several of these as they are somewhat reasonably priced for what they are.  It has a gentle scent and makes my hair SO soft.  Really love them!</li>
    <li> excellent product! fair price.</li>
    <li> I saw all the hype about this product on amazon. I purchased it mainly due to my acne scars, from what I read it claims to help alleviate the scarring from previous acne outbreaks. Well I am now into my first week of using this product. It seems as though my skin is so much more clearer and healthier looking. It doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy residue or cause any additional outbreaks like most products. I am happy with my purchase and will be buying this product in the future again.</li>
    <li> Probably my best skin care purchase ever! I have suffered from acne and acne scaring since I was a teenager. Until now I have never found a product that not only clears my face  without over drying but also gives it proper moisture without making me break out even more. I have been using this product for only a week and I do notice a significant difference in my skin. It is clearing up and radiant. I apply it at night as a moisturizer and I also put a drop in my night hand cream so my hands will be super soft the next day. Worth every penny!</li>
    <li> So far, after using the product for a week, I love the way it makes my skin feel. There is no oily feeling at all and absorbs into my skin very quickly. I am a big fan and even love it for my hair!</li>
    <li> Have bought argon oil before for twice as much from beauty suppliers and found virtually no difference between the two products. I use this product because I have dry sensitive skin and I find that the oil works well for me.  I would suggest however that you buy just one bottle and see if argon oil is right for you.</li>
    <li> this oil is amazing it has changed my hair dramatictly from dry, brittle and loss to silky smooth and more hair. totally recommend to anyone.</li>
    <li> Why someone would pay triple the cost for Josie Maran when this is the same darn thing (possibly even better) is beyond me. I use this on my hair and skin and it is wonderful, especially in the winter.</li>
    <li> I bought this Pura d&#x27;or Argan oil and love it. I mixed it with Grape Seed oil and other essential oils (lavender, frankincense, etc) to make my own facial serum and seen the big different in less than a couple months. My co-workers even tell me that my skin looks bright and firm. Now I don&#x27;t have to buy those facial serum from department stores anymore.  My home made facial serum not only save me a lot of money but also are nature. I wish I did it early in my life. I guess it&#x27;s never too late to take care our skin. Keep up the good work and continue provide us this wonderful product. Thanks HRS</li>
    <li> Wanted to give my purchase a few weeks before reviewing. I have tried 3 other brands of Argan Oil. I am extremely satisified with this brand. The pump discharges just enough for my needs. Soaks in immediately and skin feels like silk for a long time after. I&#x27;m seeing much improved sun damaged spots on my face. I have 2 dry areas on my cheeks that have disappeared after using this product. I am 75 years old but have a much more youthful appearance. Fine lines are gone. My complexion looks so fresh. I&#x27;m delighted. Thank you.</li>
    <li> Love Josie Maran argan oil. After reading the reviews on Pura dor I Decided to purchase two 4oz bottles at 19.99 per bottle free shipping and handling. I could not tell the difference between the two. I use it on my face, hair and hands. Josie Maran has a 4oz. bottle of her light argan oil for 83.76 plus shipping and handling on q.v.c. as I write this review. Needless to say more bang for the argan lovers buck. What do you have to loose?</li>
    <li> I have always been skeptical of just about anything I put on my face, especially oil. I am 40 and still prone to acne. AND of course I love it when my face is soft and glowing.Until now I really thought I had to sacrifice one for the other: soft and acne, healthy glow and oily look . . . .  Not any more. I love this Argan Oil. IT seems to be the answer to my problems and issues. I use it twice daily, sometime more. I will even add a tiny bit of medicinal grade aromatherapy oil to add a nice smell and of course depending on the oil I choose I get even more benefits. I recommend this to anyone. 5 stars all the way.The price is reasonable, and I think I till likely last a very long time. Try it. . . you won&#x27;t be sorry1</li>
    <li> Fantastic product. received it yeterday and used it in the night as moisturiser and i can already feel the difference, woke up in the morning and i feel my skin soft and bright. Awesome product. recommend to any one looking for all in one oil.</li>
    <li> I have only had this product a couple of days and the jury is still out on how I feel about it for my hair but for my face, so far so good. I was worried about a greasy residue and a reaction of some sort but I used it at bedtime and the next morning before applying makeup and it&#x27;s wonderful. My makeup went on even better than before and I didn&#x27;t have a greasy look to my face. I&#x27;ll have to revise my review after some time in regards to lines, and black circles, even adult acne, but my initial impression is very promising for my future use. My skin didn&#x27;t feel funny after applying the Argan oil, which I really loved. My face was soft and firm.</li>
    <li> Very silky to the touch.......and it does not weigh my hair down</li>
    <li> I have been using argan oil for about 3 years now. I’ve tried several different companies and this one is one of my favorite. It has no weird smell nor texture. I just use 2-3 drops of oil on my face and hands and it’s enough to keep them moist especially in dry winter. I rub it gently around my face for a while and it just leaves nice smooth skin. My mom is a huge fan of argan oil so I got another Pura d’or bottle for her and she loves it. She told me even some of the dark spots on her hands started fading away. That was a pleasant surprise.&lt;br /&gt;I don’t like using oil on my hair though. Even just a little bit of oil it just feel greasy for me. I guess my hair isn’t as dry as my skin.</li>
    <li> Love my Aragan oil. I use it every night before I go to bed...I keep mine in my medicine cabinet and have not had any problems with it going off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely a good price for the volume since Sephora sells 1.7 oz for 60 CAD.</li>
    <li> I just so love this product. never used a hair product that is so amazing!!!!!!!!. I hooked some oil on my hair and just in one moment my hair got so smoothy and silky and not oily at all. I &#x27;ve had a very dry and fluffy hair though using the conditioner my hair still seemed so dry and nothing could save my hair untill I got this!!! I really recommend this bottle for it&#x27;s organic and very suitable for the people who has very dry hair</li>
    <li> Great product!  I have very thick, dry hair long hair and apply this when my hair is wet, then blow dry.  Does not leave a greasy residue and really helps with shine and frizz.  I love this brand as it is almost odorless and is high quality.</li>
    <li> Excellent product --  great quality argan oil with a pleasant, very light natural scent. A little goes a very long way, too -- just a few drops are enough even on very dry skin or hair. I am impressed with the difference I see in only a day. I am delighted with the large 4 oz. size -- great value for top quality oil. Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> Product is very thick but thins out as you apply.  Absorbs nice and love that it&#x27;s fragrance free!  Dark glass pump bottle protects product.</li>
    <li> First time user of this Argan Oil.  It&#x27;s perfect for sensitive skin without leaving a very greasy feeling to it.  I&#x27;ve noticed improvement in my skin already. Also great for nails.  Would highly recommend it to my friends as well.</li>
    <li> Really nice product - it is authentic Argan oil - to be sure. I use it on;y for skin and you needs only a small amount in most cases.  I use it on top of Glytone AHA cream as that is sometimes drying. But I follow up with a few drops of this oil and all is good</li>
    <li> Excellent price for a great product.</li>
    <li> I like it but don&#x27;t know if it does everything it claims.  Would buy it again.</li>
    <li> Really love this product. It feels great on my very dry skin. Very happy with product. Thanks</li>
    <li> Great product and so reasonably priced.  Sinks right into the skin - amazing</li>
    <li> I was very skeptical in trying this... since I try not to feed into the hype of many products out there. However, I initially bought this to keep my newly cut hair&#x27;s ends healthy. I put too much the first time I tried it on my hair so it came out looking greasy all day. Should have known better that a little goes a long way. It was okay with my hair (only because I stopped using this on my hair after 2 weeks) but this thing does WONDERS on my skin! I love it. I mix it in with my body lotion after I take a shower and my skin is moisturized and it has helped better my skin as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will definitely buy this and recommend it to whoever needs it!</li>
    <li> This oil seems to be identical to a brand that I purchased at Sephora for several times the cost of this bottle.&lt;br /&gt;Such a great natural oil for skin and split ends.  I love this stuff!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for 2 months for my hair and face.  I have oily skin so I was hesitant about using oil on my face. It is not overly greasy and has not caused any breakouts.  It works better than any lotion or conditioner that I&#x27;ve used in the past.  There is no strong smell and absorbs pretty fast.  I highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Really absorbs well into skin and hair. I use argan oil every day after I shower because I get really dry scalp and skin during the colder months. I also use argan oil along with other natural oil as a hair styling product because I dislike the feel and smell of chemical hair products.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff!  My thick, wavy hair is dry with split ends because I am way over-due for a trim.  I put some in my hair and it was like magic!  It&#x27;s shiny and smooth and has stayed that way for three days so far - even though I washed it the next day!  I just put some on my face and it feels great - not oily!</li>
    <li> This oil is like &amp;#34;Liquid Gold&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;I had been using an Argan oil purchased from CVS for a few years when I finally took a look at the ingredients and realized that it was not 100% pure argan oil. It had lots of suspicious additives and was not organic. After some research I came across Pura d&#x27;or 100% pure organic argan oil and decided to give it a try. The price at Amazon.com was better than what I had been paying for the product from CVS. I can&#x27;t believe the difference. When my bottle arrived I tested the first few drops on my hands and I felt the difference immediately. It left my skin feeling silky and smooth, not greasy or oily and the effect was long lasting. I tried it on my hair and found it superior to what I had been using... a little goes a long way. I will definitely reorder this oil as I don&#x27;t plan on ever being without it.</li>
    <li> I love this oil! I use it  on my face, body, nails and my hair. I even use it to remove waterproof mascara. This oil is amazing!</li>
    <li> I have used Argan oil before, but this is my first purchase of organic Argan oil: this product is the best! It really is a miracle oil, good for dry hands, feet, skin, nails, and hair. I can&#x27;t live without it, and I would not hesitate to recommend this brand. I like that it is organic, and the pump bottle makes it easier than ever.</li>
    <li> I used to by a much more expensive brand at Sephora.. but after reading lots of good reviews for the Pura d&#x27;or I decided to try it.  I just bought my second bottle recently and I definitely love this stuff..  I&#x27;m a 41 year old female and I have combination/oily skin that and I even sometimes still get the occasional zits.  no more with this stuff.  Even with oily skin, this stuff is amazing! My skin loves it! I use it in the morning before I put on my make-up instead of moisturizer and at night before I go to bed . My skin feels soft at supple and no break outs at all. I&#x27;ve been using this for several months now.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s like magic. Since then I bought 3 more as gifts to my sisters-in-law. Excellent product. I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Purchased this recently and when opened to use, noticed a really strong chemical-like odor. Am not sure this is real argan oil, as I&#x27;ve scoured other sites and most advise that real argan oil should have a faint nutty smell. Very dissatisfied with purchase</li>
    <li> Great Argan oil!  Great value!!  It is light and never smells rancid!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have sensitive skin and use it 2x a day. I pat (not rub) it onto my skin and let it set a few minutes before using cosmetics.</li>
    <li> I started using Argan oil two years ago when a friend brought some back from Morocco.  I loved it and was happy to find Pura d&amp;#34;or online.  The quality is excellent and I have since turned my friends on to it as well.  It&#x27;s great for my skin, I use it morning and night.  It absorbs quickly and leaves my skin feeling soft.  I am prone to basil cell cancer spots, and  I have found that it is great for it&#x27;s healing qualities.  It makes my hair happy, as well.  Good stuff!</li>
    <li> This is my second bottle of Pura D&#x27;or Argan Oil and I loved it. I have very sensitive skin and it works fine on me. I use it daily together with my BB cream because my face will  looks more bright and natural.  At the same time, it will moisturize my skin through out the day!</li>
    <li> Love argan oil! It has really done wonders for my face, hair, and body. I will never go without.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had a dry &amp;#34;T&amp;#34; zone area all of my life.&lt;br /&gt;Mostly I just live with it, but my wife (yes I&#x27;m a guy) has tried many times to fix it.&lt;br /&gt;Nothing has ever really worked until Argan Oil and this stuff in particular works great.  No more dry.&lt;br /&gt;It also feels kind of nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would give this 5 stars except for one very small issue with packaging. The lid was a little loose under the plastic wrap so a bit of oil got out during shipping to make a bit of a mess opening it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m often watching anime using my laptop on my bed and as a result my right elbow has gotten pretty rough because of always resting on it, so I bought this and after some regular use I&#x27;ve noticed some huge improvements. I decided to put a bit on my arms and face, and I noticed they feel a bit more smooth and moist though the improvements to my elbows were much greater. Also, my mom (who always made remarks about how dark my elbow looked) noticed the change in my elbow and tried some of the oil after I told her about it and she said she could feel her skin was more moist right away despite her having had some light makeup on at that point.</li>
    <li> Absolutely pure, use only a dime sized amount, more is not better.</li>
    <li> My daughter told me about this product and i have to say it is pretty good compared to other products which feel like water and don&#x27;t give any change and while i have oily skin, this helps control oils but keep my skin hydrated and makes my hair very shiny and thick</li>
    <li> Absolutely horrible quality! Ive used two other Argan oil brands and never had such a bad break out. I decided to buy this one due to the good reviews and I regret it. I will have to return it once the company decides to respond to my email. Usually Argan oil is a golden yellow color , the one I received was so transparent I had my doubts it was 100% pure. After using it for a week my whole face broke out. I should of listened to the 1 star reviews ...they are there for good reason!</li>
    <li> This argan oil works great. I have oily skin that is prone to breakouts and this has evened out my skin so it is no longer oily when applied and without any breakouts.  It was also delivered within 2 days of ordering in protective packaging with no leaks. This is my 3rd time purchasing this product and I will continue to do so.  I even use it on my body when it gets dry.</li>
    <li> Love this product. It makes my hair soft and manageable, and my skin soft and moisturized. It is better than other Argan/Moroccan oil product I have tried. I am on my third bottle.</li>
    <li> very nice product ! works ! i will buy again . love it love it</li>
    <li> Best argan oil I&#x27;ve ever found!</li>
    <li> I have not been using this product for very long so I cannot speak about the long-term effects--so far this product seems to work well. I use it mostly on my hair, but sometimes on my skin as well. A small amount seems to go a long way to make your hair look shiny and soft. The shipping for this product was excellent--I received it quickly (within two days) with no problems.</li>
    <li> I used the more expensive JM version prior to using Pura d&#x27;or 100% Pure &amp; USDA Argan Oil.  The Pura d&#x27;or Argan oil is a little lighter but has the same effects.  Pura d&#x27;or is definitely a better value that I will be using moving forward.</li>
    <li> Lovely, natural oil. You only need a drop and it lasts a long time. Comes packaged in a pouch. Very classy.</li>
    <li> I first started using Argan Oil when I got a free sample of Josie Maran and LOVED it! I have always struggled with acne and started using this oil on my face at night and saw a huge improvement that has lasted over 6 months now. I didn&#x27;t want to pay the high price of Josie Maran so I bought this kind and it is exactly the same quality. No weird smells, and a much better value. It also feels great in my hair and cuticles. I will definitely be purchasing this again.</li>
    <li> I love this argan oil from Pura d&#x27;or. Excellent quality, it goes on smooth, its aroma is superb and it has help clear up many dark spots as well as scars. I used it after a shower as a toner, since it is non greasy I&#x27;ve notice that it also works great as pre-shave lubricant, making the electric shaver glide gently and easy on my skin. I will definitely keep buying it and, I highly recommend it to all those who are looking for spot free, smooth, clear, acne free skin that comes from using this quality organic oil from Pura d&#x27;or.</li>
    <li> I use this product for the last 6 months. It helps to have a good hair quality.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this on my hair for about a month.  It took a week or two to get the frequency and amount right for my hair... but now that I have figured it out, Pura d&#x27;or works great (I had been encouraged to use Moroccan Oil by my stylist, but after the the first bottle, I looked for something more reasonably priced).  I have also recently begun to rub a little into my husbands beard and it has made it much softer and less itchy.</li>
    <li> This is an awesome product.  I&#x27;ve used it on my face and hands for about three weeks.  Both look younger. The wrinkles and lines around my eyes are dramatically reduced and my hands look smoother and are softer.  I love this oil !</li>
    <li> Excellent! Very well priced, beautifully packaged. Has improved my skin and thus my health enourmously and its a pleasure to apply to face, hands, feet, decollatage... Feels nourishing and the evidence is in the health of my skin!</li>
    <li> Have been using argan oil for the past 6-7 months and have found it to be beneficial for my skin.  Have used other manufacturers&#x27; oil.  Pur d&#x27;or is different.  Although I have only used it for two days I find that it does not have an odor and it is a bit \\&quot;heavier\\&quot; than other argan oils I have tried.  I like the pump bottle as the amount it gives is perfect for me (it helps to have the pump so I don&#x27;t use too much).  I think I am getting a very good oil for the price and better than the other brands I have used.  Argan oil has proven itself beneficial for my skin.  It does not work miracles (erase wrinkles) but it does strengthen my skin (face and arms) so I do not bruise as easily and heal faster when bruised.  I like the product and will continue to use argan oil as my moisturizer.</li>
    <li> I was curious about putting oil on my face for cosmetic purposes. I do not suffer from acne and didn&#x27;t want to make it happen by using an oil product. I have used this company&#x27;s shampoo and loved that so I tried this. I have used it on my face almost daily with no issue of breakouts. My skin feels softer, more hydrated and looks more radiant. At first I just used this for about a week. Now I go back and forth between just using this, and using this in conjunction with my facials creams which I put on top of this. However, if you are going to put other products on top you have to give yourself plenty of time for this oil to get into the skin and dry off a little. If you use this, other products, then cosmetics, it will definitely increase your time to do all that. I think it&#x27;s worth it. I have used much more expensive facial products than this that give the same results or worse results. It is clear (some negative reviews comment on that it should be brown), and has no scent even though it comes from a nut. It&#x27;s in the way it&#x27;s processed. I&#x27;m sure I will be re-ordering.</li>
    <li> This is my first time using argan oil and so far I am pleased with it.  The oil absorbs into my skin nicely and does not leave an oily residue.  I also like that the bottle comes with a pump.  Usually two pumps is all I need to moisturize my face and hands.  The oil has a very mild nutty smell to it that is hardly noticeable.  My order arrived quickly and the bottle was packaged nicely which is another plus!</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this product. I use it for myself and my 2 years olds face, body, and hair. Our skin and hair look and feel great. I have sensitive skin and haven&#x27;t had any breakouts or rashes with this product and I&#x27;ve been using it for about a month. It has cleared up some dry skin issues my son had.</li>
    <li> I am new to the Argan oil and a bit skeptical about it.  Yet I was very excited and curious to try it since I always have problems with dry and sensitive skin.  As soon as I received my order I applied it on hands and heels, my skin absorbs it very quickly in just a few minutes and it doesn&#x27;t leave my skin oily and greasy at all.  I am very happy with the product so far and especially like the fact that it&#x27;s all natural and very versatile product that can be used from hair to heels!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using argan oil for a while and it has been great on my dry skin and occasional eczema. However this product seems like it is watered down or not argan oil at all. The texture is weird; too watery. I am not happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> I have been using Pura d&#x27;or Argan Oil for about a little over a month to moisturize my face and as a leave-in conditioner for my hair.  It helps with split ends and frizzy hair, and it is an excellent moisturizer.  I have very sensitive skin prone to break-outs, and my break-outs have been decreasing in frequency and severity since using this oil.  I love it and would definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> Great, great price for a high quality product.</li>
    <li> Love this so much I ordered it for my friends and they are hooked!  This will clear up blemishes and is not oily on your skin and a great moisturizer!  Argon oil is liquid gold!</li>
    <li> This was my first time trying Pura d or Argan Oil and I am amazed at the quality and effectiveness of this product.  I am an african american woman and I have been chemical free for 3 years.  My hair is fine and coarse which makes it very difficult to maintain.  I am growing my hair out and like to wear it straight.  The oil helps with detangling, blowdrying, maintaining moisture and healing. This is essential when trying to maintain length for optimal hair growth.  It&#x27;s my all in one miracle oil!!!  You must try it....you will love it!</li>
    <li> I love it, my friend just introduce me about that, and I begin to use that, it is quite amazing.</li>
    <li> Nice for the skin but makes my hair very greasy! Even 1 drop is too much. I would not recommend</li>
    <li> I am very satisfied with this organic argan oil. Initially it goes on oily but the skin soaks it up pretty fast. I only use it at once a day at night and my skin looks great. I also put a little dab on my hand and put it on my hair to give it the shiny healthy look. And it lasts a long time. I would recommend it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a week and it&#x27;s absolutely amazing. I have recently been experiencing adult acne and nothing has worked but in the past week my skin has completely cleared up and my face feels moisturized but not oily. I have naturally oily skin and was worried that this product would make me greasy. Surprisingly it seems as though my face has been less oily. I&#x27;ve tried using it on my hair but used way too much. My hair dried pretty greasy and sticky. I will try using just a drop or two and see if I get better results that way.</li>
    <li> I have just started using this product on my hair and I am truly enjoying it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have medium thick hair that hasn&#x27;t decided if it is prefers to be curly or a frizzy mane. I have been using this Argan oil after the shower and have noticed the frizzieness decrease. I am still figuring out how many drops to use - I tried an amount equivalent to a little less than half of the oil that can be held in the dropper and my hair was significantly weighed down my medium-long hair and left it stringy and limp. I imagine just a few drops are needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have recently heard to add it to my conditioner as well, so I may give that a try. Overall, I am happy!</li>
    <li> Love this oil, I will order again!</li>
    <li> Received item in good time and it was packaged very well.  The argan oil is very nice.  No scent and it absorbs quickly.  I like the pump dispenser.  Very pleased with this purchase and would order again.</li>
    <li> Great product!!! Very light and nongreasy. Absorbs instantly and its Unscented</li>
    <li> Great Moisturizer product, on Amazon I saw the reviews on the Argan oil, decided to purchase the product.  After 2 weeks of using this oil I notice a change with the glow and smoothing of my skin, I like the way it absorbs into my skin, I can honesty say I have founded what I been looking for.  For years I have been using other brands of oil, none like this.  I highly recommend this product![[ASIN:B004Z209HS Pura d&#x27;or 100% Pure &amp; USDA Organic Argan Oil (4 fl. oz.) For Face, Hair, Skin and Nails]]</li>
    <li> This stuff is awesome. High quality, I use it after I straighten my hair to smooth the ends, I use it on my hands to moisturize them, I put it on my dogs dry feet pads, I use it on my lips when they are dry, my elbows, my nails, and most importantly it works. Great great great product, will buy again!</li>
    <li> Bought this product since I&#x27;ve been looking for a different way to moisturize and argan oil is noncomedogenic. I&#x27;m impressed with this product. I&#x27;ve been suffering from rashes due to the dryness in Colorado. My dermatologist recommended Cetaphil heavy cream to me, and I&#x27;ve been using it regularly, but have still been experiencing itching. I then tried putting argan oil on head to toe, and the itching stopped (I&#x27;m guessing since the oil takes more time to absorb into my skin than the heavy cream). Will continue to use this product.</li>
    <li> This Argan oil is very good!!!, I use it directly on my skin by night and mix with my day cream by day.&lt;br /&gt;My skin at the cold weather is very dray and with the oil now it is in excellent condition.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had been using Sweet Almond Oil and it just sat on my skin so I decided to try this.  It&#x27;s AMAZING!  My skin gets dry because I use tretinoin and finally I found a product that truly helps with the drying effect of the tretinoin.  I&#x27;ve also used it on my hands and it soaks in immediately and does not leave a greasy feel.  I love it.</li>
    <li> I just recently ordered this hair oil and have only used it about 5 times but I need to leave a review for it. This oil works great on my hair. I have fine thin hair which tends to fly away and always has a &amp;#34;fried&amp;#34; look to it after straightening or blow drying. The first time I put this in my hair, right out of the shower, I could instantly tell that this was a great product. My hair felt softer and more manageable than it usually does and I was able to brush right through it. After blow drying and straightening, my hair had a very sleek shiny look to it which lasted throughout the whole day. I was a little worried that my hair might get oily like with other products I have tried but this left no oily residue behind. I am very very pleased with this product and will buy it again when I run out, which will probably be a while as I only have to use one pump to cover my entire hair. The product also came very well packaged &amp; the price is very reasonable</li>
    <li> After applying this oil, honestly my hair have been so smooth. I apply this oil to my hair and face and my face is never oily. I have given away with all the lotions and sticking to this oil. Highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Love the product, its organic, its price is unbeatable for 4oz.</li>
    <li> A great multi-purpose product. I use a drop in my body lotion, on wet and dry hair to smooth the ends and as a nightly facial serum. It&#x27;s rare to find a product that works so well for so many purposes!</li>
    <li> I was very pleased with the results of this product.  I first ordered it last summer when I was deployed to Afghanistan and the hard water was brutal on my skin. I would use it on my entire body (to include my hair) in the mornings, on my hands throughout the day  and  after my showers at night. I saw and felt a great change. I loved it so much,  I have since redeployed and am still using it even though the water in America is nothing compared to Afghanistan&#x27;. I have even introduced my mother to it. Great product for overall body use, you won&#x27;t be disappointed,  wish it was a little less costly though.</li>
    <li> I love this product. My hair looks better than it has in a long time and I feel better about my appearance. I recommend this unique product to my friends and family.</li>
    <li> the bottle size and amount is great so you really are getting the most for your money, also i have used this product previously and have know for it to really help  with itchy and dry scalp so it definitely passes for my needs!</li>
    <li> Almost odorless,not greasy, easily absorbed on the skin. Overall this product is an average moisturizer which did not help my very dry skin.</li>
    <li> I got this product for my wife. It is very good and my wife loves it. She uses it on the face and it gives a very nice feel to her skin. The product delivery was also very fast.</li>
    <li> I am been been using coconut oil since I was a child. After I started using Pura d&#x27;or Argan oil i stopped using coconut oil. I also apply this oil to my eyelashes and my eyebrows every once in a while and I could notice the difference. I used to have very thin and uneven eyebrow hair growth after using this now its thick and got my eyebrows threading done and now I love the shape of my eyebrows. I also apply this argan oil for my hair , and I did notice hair growth. I have been wanting to grow my hair, and after using this oil i saw the difference that now I wanted to get a proper haircut to even my length.SInce i saw the difference I bought one for my mother and even she loves it. Now my first bottle is gonna be over, can&#x27;t wait to get my 2nd one.</li>
    <li> I love this oil, non greasy and goes on very smooth.</li>
    <li> This is a great oil for your hair and skin, it doesn&#x27;t leave an oily residue and can be used daily. Overall, very happy with this product.</li>
    <li> Great product will be ordering again from them love it thank you thank you so much</li>
    <li> This is my second bottle of argan oil and I love it. I use it on my face daily instead of the various creams I have tried over the years,and on my hair before shampooing. My skin feels soft an not greasy. My granddaughter uses it on her hair also and she has beautiful shiny hair.</li>
    <li> My first time using this product. Yes I will be adding this to my most favorite beauty list.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s very lite does not weight my hair down, not greasy but rich.very natural . I love the fact that I can smooth this product on my skin, hair then massage into my nails and cuticles.  I have tried Moroccan Argan oil it seemed heavy to me .&lt;br /&gt;This Pura d&#x27;or seems to be lasting longer .The packaging show so much love for MOTHER EARTH . Got to love it !</li>
    <li> I wanted to use this product over a decent period (2-3 months) before i gave a review since it yields more of a long term result.&lt;br /&gt;I have used different oils (Coconut/Mustard) for hair grooming purposes and Pura d&#x27;or Argan oil is my new favorite!&lt;br /&gt;As expected it had no smell and the stream nozzle makes it very convenient to apply in a hurry.&lt;br /&gt;However compared to some of the reviews i had read on here, i ended up using quite an amount to get my hair thoroughly coated and hence was too greasy to wear outdoors.&lt;br /&gt;My regular routine has been to massage it into my hair every alternate day, leave it in for an hr and head into the shower.&lt;br /&gt;My hair is better than it had ever been. Soft, silky, shiny, little to no frizz and doesn&#x27;t tangle in my hair brush anymore!</li>
    <li> With time I have been moving more towards using simple and organic products on my skin. When I decided on Argan Oil I gave this brand a shot and I couldn&#x27;t be happier. Easily absorbable and the pure 100% stuff we are all encouraged to use. There is no real way to find out if in fact it is pure ... but the fact that is smells good, absorbs easily, and I have noticed my skin happily moisturized, I would still continue to buy. Thanks.</li>
    <li> I have oily skin and was hesitant to put oil on my face, but this really sinks in fast and works better than any other moisturizer I have tried. I also mix it in with body lotion and apply a little to the ends of my hair. It has a lot of uses and is a very good value compared to the other argan oils out there.</li>
    <li> This oil is amazing. I use it for everything...stretch marks, skincare, hair. I love it.</li>
    <li> Best value for the money! Authentic product that works great. I love the pump bottle it comes in!</li>
    <li> It is a wonderful product and it does indeed reduces wrinkles and blemishes noticeably. I apply it to my face and scalp after after washing both before I go to bed. It even reduces age spots on my hands. I am grateful I discovered it!</li>
    <li> In a word; awesome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I never leave reviews and wanted to give some time to really test this out.  My skin has never looked or felt better, not greasy or grimy at all; and my hair? Forget about it.  As a guy I&#x27;ve never really put that much into my hair because it always just looked awesome (in my own opinion) but now it looks incredibly healthy and even better than it did before.  I can&#x27;t stop raving about it really, but it is awesome.  I highly recommend this for anyone and everyone, you wont be disappointed.</li>
    <li> Using argan oil has made my face feel smooth and moisturized. Bumps and acne scars are beginning to fade after just a few days of use. Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> This is great to keep your hair soft and manageable. I love how it works easy to use with just a few pumps of the bottle!</li>
    <li> Great product, i use it everyday and my hair feels like angel eyelashes. No joke, a girl once creamed her pants just by running her fingers through my scalp it ruined our date, but who cares I&#x27;m fabulous.</li>
    <li> Too thick .. And bad smell</li>
    <li> This product has helped me alot - I just started using it on my hair, neck and face - I also have eczema on my hands so I used it on it and it&#x27;s pretty bad eczema and in 2 days it started to clear up. I am very happy with this product!!</li>
    <li> Great product I&#x27;ve been using it for a week and can see the changes in my skin and hair .</li>
    <li> I have been a big fan of argan oil for my hair for several years - I don&#x27;t have dry hair and conditioner always weighed it down, so after shampooing I work a pump or two through which makes my hair smooth enough to brush through (I have thick, stick-straight hair). I appreciate that this doesn&#x27;t have all the silicone and additives that other hair products with argan oil have. You have to be careful working with oils if you have oily hair to begin with; coconut and jojoba oils made my hair pretty gross and attracted dirt, but argan oil, if used judiciously, has done ok. Also used on my face for some dry patches and didn&#x27;t break me out. So all in all, a product I feel good about using and don&#x27;t think will kill me in return for making me look not hideous.</li>
    <li> This product works wonderful! It&#x27;s easily absorbed by the skin and you can see the difference right away.  Great product!</li>
    <li> During the winter, I usually have to put oils that don&#x27;t absorb quick enough, however, this one does. I now have one less thing to worry about that will make me late for work. Plus it last all day compering to ordinary lotions.</li>
    <li> Makes hair super soft &amp; gets rid of frizz.  Just make sure you don&#x27;t put too much or it&#x27;ll look oily.</li>
    <li> I was introduced this argan oil by a friend.  I have been using it for about two months and I noticed that my brown spots are lighter, my face is softer and I feel like the skin is tighter too.  I recommended to two of my other friends and they are using now and they said they feel their skin is smoother and softer.  I make my two daughters to use it twice daily, morning and night time.  I hope my brown spots will be lighter eventually then I don&#x27;t have to spend money on laser.  This is very safe and natural.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing. I had previously been using the Macadamia brand Healing Oil Treatment, which has lots of silicones and other chemical nasties in it in addition to argan oil. I wanted to switch to something more natural, so I went for the pure argan oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After looking at several different brands on Amazon, I decided to go with this one for a few reasons. I liked the packaging and the affordability of this one. A little bit of this oil goes a surprisingly long way, which makes the 4 ounces of this oil a good value for the price. It&#x27;s crazy that such a small amount of this oil can do so much for my hair. Also, I read that they clean their machines with tea tree oil instead of harsh chemicals, which I thought was pretty cool. I appreciated that the oil was packaged in a reusable and biodegradable pouch and came with a note on recycled paper. I am very picky about the products I use and the businesses I support, and this company seems like an eco-conscious and sustainable company that cares.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After applying this oil to my hair, I always rub the excess into my skin and it feels very nourishing and moisturizing. It makes my hair smooth and frizz-free without making it greasy, and it absorbs nicely into my skin. I&#x27;m excited to try using it on my face!</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! I have really dry skin and scalp and this really works. I use this on my face as a moisturizer and it also helped the bags under my eyes, and healing acne and acne scars. I also massage this on my scalp about an hour before washing my hair and it&#x27;s helped with my itchy, flaky, dry scalp. I would suggest not putting a lot on the hair especially on the roots if you&#x27;re not going to be washing it because it can look greasy. If you put it on, keep it minimal and not on the roots. That&#x27;s what I do to keep the fly-aways away. This is my second purchase and I&#x27;m very happy with it!</li>
    <li> Since I have super dry skin, I have tested so many products. This is perfect for me and I will keep using!!</li>
    <li> Now I don&#x27;t have to take a bunch of products when traveling . . . just this one bottle takes care of hair, face and hands.</li>
    <li> Very nice surprise at how much I like this.  I use it on my (wet) hair - not at all greasy, leaves my hair softer and shinier.  I also use it at night after my facial cleansing and moisturizing to &#x27;lock in&#x27; the treatments!  I now have begun using it to soften my cuticles!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased two bottles and gave one to my sister.  After one week of using it on her hair - which is long and colored, she told me that not only did she see a difference in softness and shine, so did her partner!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you.</li>
    <li> I am so happy to find this Argan oil at such a great price..I was using another one that costs over $30 with less oil.  I use this oil on my hair and skin and it&#x27;s great.  I would definately recommend this oil to anyone.</li>
    <li> I love, love, love this product. I have been looking a very long time for some product that would tame my frizzy hair and now I have found it!!! Not only do I use this on my hair but on my face also, which has gotten much more hydrated and smoother. I would not hesitate to recommend this product for not only women but men also. I also have to mention that a little goes a long way. A great product!!</li>
    <li> I was a huge fan of Moroccan oil and I was trying to find a less expensive option. I got this because it was the main ingredient in the Moroccan oil. It worked well hydrating my hair but it made it feel greasy. Thankfully I just used it on my ends. I will continue to use it as a pre shower treatment but I wouldn&#x27;t recommend using it after. Especially if you have a lighter hair color like I do.</li>
    <li> Love it. Very light fragrance, which I appreciate. Makes my hair feel silky not oily. My only &#x27;problem&#x27; is that my husband is using it faster than I am. Would definitely recommend the product. The shampoo is great, too!</li>
    <li> This is the first time I use Argan oil. I saw Josie Maran Argan oil on QVC  and was impressed with it. I wanted to try it but did not want to spend that kind of money. I found Purador Argan oil on Amazon and read the reviews and decided to give it a trial. I use it on my hair, face, eye, neck and arms. I love this stuff especially on my face. The lines under my eyes are practically gone. The price for the oil is very reasonable since it’s organic.</li>
    <li> I love this product.  I wanted a produce that I could use on my hair and face. Although I think it&#x27;s alittle heavy for my hair, I love it on my face.  It does not brake me out (and I have really sensitive skin). I use it every morning before I put on my makeup and it keeps my face hydrated. Perfect for the up coming winter weather!!</li>
    <li> Great ! doesn&#x27;t cause acne at all.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Argan oil for over a month now and it is excellent.  It is very thin and non-greasy, and absorbs quicker than any other product I&#x27;ve used.  It works excellent when used in the hair as well as on the skin.  It has very little smell and the bottle pump works very well.</li>
    <li> Love this product. It is non-greasy and absorbs right into skin. Healed my broken curticles</li>
    <li> I bought this thinking it would be great for my hair, but was pleasantly surprised that it has multiple uses. I am using it on my skin, under my eyes and on my cuticles. It does not leave an oily residue. I am most pleased with the results on my hair which is very curly and unruly. The argan oil has tamed my frizzy hair and made it smooth and soft. A little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> Working well so far. My hands and face are doing better but I&#x27;m not sure about my hair.....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ordered more anyway.</li>
    <li> Great product and price. I have been using Argan oil for a couple years now and by far this is the best stuff on earth. Recently I ran out of my expensive department store moisturizer and just started using argan oil, I was very surprised that so far this winter (and its cold in Chicago) my skin has been great, no flaking and it gives my skin a dewy effect. This is a new brand that I tried and it works great! Extremely happy about the organic certification, as the product I was using before stopped including that on the label and I was not sure anymore. I use it on my ends, my face and my arms ( i have kp and after finding the right scrub (shea moisture), I apply the oil to arms and it has really made a difference, my arms feel better now in the winter than what they did in the summer- as sun and humidity really help and I dont have to go tanning anymore). I also use it on my kids, dab in on their faces for extra protection from the cold wind. Trying it out to to see if it will work on my daughter&#x27;s eczema.</li>
    <li> This oil is amazing, I have tried loads of different hair products over the years, and none have quite got the effect I wanted, this has made my hair look healthy, clean, shiny and just all over amazing.  I thought it was a little pricey, but I will definitely be buying again, I have been using it for a few weeks now, but the bottle hardly looks used, highly recommended, thank you!</li>
    <li> I have a heavy dry brittle beard. Everything oil or treatment I&#x27;ve tried in the past was either greasy, gum or dried leaving my beard hard to comb. This product was different in every way--not greasy, acts as a beard conditioner and my beard is now much easier to comb.</li>
    <li> I really like this oil, and love that it is organic. It is very light on the face and acts as a good moisturizer. The price is also great as well.</li>
    <li> Not greasy!  Goes on and instantly disappears.  Feels great on my face, and makeup goes on nicely.  A drop or two does the trick.  No odor.  This product is wonderful to use during cold weather when the humidity is low, and the heat is on.  I apply it every morning and again in the evening.  It arrived promptly in secure packaging...no leaking.</li>
    <li> Outstanding product!. I love this argan oil. It makes my skin so soft! I use it in the morning and evening on my face. I feel that my skin is deeply moisturized and appears younger. I love the fact that is all natural, and has no artificial ingredients.  I tried different creams and lotions an my face, but nothing moisturized my skin as well as this oil.  I massage a couple of drops around my eyes and on my face and let it absorb.  Then I put on an eye cream and face cream.  My skin looks nourished and healthy.</li>
    <li> I was looking for something to help with my crazy hair and I am so glad I found this. It helps to eliminate frizz and does not leave my hair oily (I do use only a tiny amount though). And my hands absolutely love it! Feels super nice. Definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> Great Product! Keeps my thick curly hair shiny without looking greasy. I also used it on my face, and it leaves it moisturized and glowing without an oily look. Love it! Update: Still using after 1 year+ with great results</li>
    <li> I have very dry hair and an extremely dry scalp. After using argan oil from Pura d&#x27;or, I noticed that my hair-fall reduced significantly over a period of 4 weeks. I also started using in on my face twice a week and my skin is much better now.</li>
    <li> OMG LOVE this, have been using for only 2 days now, my face is sooo soft (mixed it with frankincense, myrrh and lavender oils). Didn&#x27;t use conditioner this morning, just used this oil in my hair, my hair is super soft!</li>
    <li> I stumbled upon this product while looking for Moroccan oil for my hair. I bought both so I can compare. These are my results: While I still prefer the Moroccan oil for my hair, Pura D&#x27;Or is my choice for skin. I wouldn&#x27;t use this for my hair -- seems like it makes hair too greasy (however, it absorbs beautifully on skin), and I wouldn&#x27;t use the Moroccan oil for my face -- feels \\&quot;weird\\&quot; (and doesn&#x27;t absorb well on skin).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My two purchases ended up being a great solution for both. I really like the Pura D&#x27;Or. A lot. The only drawback, is lack of SPF. Although, I don&#x27;t know that you would want to mess with a natural extract by adding chemical crap to add sun protection.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this for skin, just expect to get sunburnt if you&#x27;re outdoors for periods without other protection.</li>
    <li> This product keeps my face soft and hair shiny. It&#x27;s not too greasy. I love it and will buy it again!</li>
    <li> Great high quality oil! My skin and hair have never been better!</li>
    <li> I had previously ordered/used another brand of Argan oil, but decided to try this because there was more product for an even better price. This product works great, leaves my skin feeling soft and hydrated but not oily- I use 2 pumps on my face every morning after showering. The only thing I noticed with this product is that it has a bit of a sweet smell, but the smell doesn&#x27;t stick around and isn&#x27;t bad or overpowering at all. I would recommend this product without any hesitation.</li>
    <li> like the product.  leaves my skin so smooth and soft.  will buy again</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re looking for an overly scented dupe of &amp;#34;Moroccan oil&amp;#34;, this product may not be for you. However, if what you are looking for is indeed something that is good for your skin and face, then this is it! Pure argan oil such as this should not have a strong perfumey scent. Using this on my face as a moisturizer has been my most favorite use for this product. It leaves your skin feeling soft and subtle, not greasy.. and absorbs pretty nicely as long as you don&#x27;t apply too much.  I&#x27;ve used handful&#x27;s of moisturizers on my face and none have ever left it feeling this good. Also great in your hair, as it is not heavy. As with any hair oil I avoid putting on my roots, but for your ends this stuff is amazing! Highly recommend, and for the price you really can&#x27;t beat it!</li>
    <li> Love it, have re-ordered this 3x&#x27;s. I use this day &amp; night on my face, I am wrinkle free in my mid-40s.</li>
    <li> Love it!  This stuff is amazing</li>
    <li> This really is liquid gold! I have relaxed hair and very dry skin which the desert climate here doesn&#x27;t help but on freshly washed hair and cleansed skin it works wonders. no more frizzy ends or ashy skin. A little goes a long way. It has a medium viscosity and a very faint scent that&#x27;s not unpleasant at all. Makes me want to test the shampoo and conditioner as well.</li>
    <li> I bought this argan oil for my wife and kid. They used it in their hair and noticed a big difference in the look and feel.&lt;br /&gt;I ordered two more of this for the family.  I love products from pura dor.</li>
    <li> Very nice weight oil and certainly works as well as the high-priced argan oil sold on TV (which I&#x27;ve also used). I like to rub this into my hands and use it to smooth over my hair in the am. Helps tame flyaways. Just a tiny bit gives a nice glow to the face, too.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for about a month and I can see a difference in my face.  I usually have little break outs here and there, especially when I am stressed out and eating unhealthy foods, but I&#x27;ve seen it slightly reduce because of the use of Argan Oil. Also I&#x27;ve had compliments about how great my face looks.  So I recommend it! I even bought one for my mom!</li>
    <li> Amazing product. It&#x27;s 100% argan oil and you can see/feel the difference. Not fragrant at all and you literally just need a pea size amount for your hair!</li>
    <li> This oil is fantastic! It makes my face clear and bright and my hair soft and shiny. Definitely recommended to anyone with problem skin or frizzy hair.</li>
    <li> I love this oil.  I use it on my hair and my daughters&#x27; hair.  I especially appreciate the commitment to being green with the packaging.  I will be buying this brand again.</li>
    <li> This oil is amazingly light and moisturizing!  It is my new favorite oil for my face.  I have tried jojoba oil and macadamia nut oil in the past which  both closely resemble natural skin oils, but the Argan oil definitely tops them both.  It comes in a nice glass jar with a pump dispenser.</li>
    <li> this is oil is good for very many things - eye , body , etc...would highly recommend!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used both Moroccan oil and One n Only Argan oil and I have to say that Pura d&#x27;or is my favorite.  I wanted an organic product I could use on my face and hands and this is working beautifully.  I&#x27;ve only been using it for 3 days and I can already tell the difference it has made in my hands.  I love that it absorbs quickly and doesn&#x27;t leave an oily residue like lotion.  Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve waited 2 1/2 months to see the result before posting a review because I&#x27;d like to see for myself whether this product lives-up to a 5-star review or whether the product is a mere marketing hype. I have a dry skin and there&#x27;s one area of my face that constantly grows acne either every week or every other week, it could be one or two of them appearing but having to endure a zit every month is nightmare and a source of embarrassment. Because of these acne marks that have developed for more than a decade, it left a scar on a particular area of my face and it also left a bit of a scar on my confidence. The quest to find the best solution came when one of my friends asked if I had a plastic surgery on this particular area of my face because of the deep and multiple acne scars it had left behind. That&#x27;s it, I need to find a solution! I changed my diet to eating more fresh organic fruits and vegetables, enrolled myself into fitness class and bought 2 bottles of Pura d&#x27;or thinking perhaps, one bottle isn&#x27;t enough! In a few days, after applying 2 drops, 3 x a day, the acne subsided and my skin felt relaxed. Yay, I am finally free of acne! This Argan Oil, in my experience, works on acne-prone skin, however, if I apply it to other normal parts of my face, it gives a little bit of a scaly appearance. So I use a different moisturiser for my normal skin type. I bought this for my acne problem, and for this reason alone, I&#x27;ll give it a 5-star. It works well on my hair too, but coconut oil, in my opinion, is better as hair and facial moisturiser. I&#x27;ll highly recommend this to anyone with acne-prone skin. It stops the acne from growing and erases any scars left on your skin. It doesn&#x27;t happen overnight but at 2 1/2 months, 3 x a day, my scars have improved between 70-80%. I will definitely buy again. Thanks Pura d&#x27;or!</li>
    <li> I love Argan Oil and this is my favorite brand.  It&#x27;s consistent from order to order.  Great product</li>
    <li> This Argan oil was really good.  I was concerned with the price a I had purchased a product from QVC which was much pricier than this produce but the quality of Pura d&#x27;or was excellent.  I would highly recommend purchasing.</li>
    <li> One, the packaging is beautiful, two, the oil is so perfect. Made my hair and skin so soft, will definitely be repurchasing this.</li>
    <li> Great product. Leaves my skin feeling healthy and moisturized. I switched from using coconut oil and this product is product feels way less heavy and cleaner. Use 1 pump in the summer and 2 to 3 pumps in the winter. Don&#x27;t overdose or you&#x27;ll look like a wax figure.</li>
    <li> i only used this product for 1 day. and my face feels so moisturizer! i cant waite to see how my skin looks in a few weeks. so far im loveing this product. The oil is light. once you rub it on your face it feels smooth.</li>
    <li> Bought it after read good review at amazon and other website, so I decided to give a try. The cost is still cheaper compare to expensive face cream. I have tried for few weeks, so not much change of result has been seen. However so far, I did feel the face hasn&#x27;t been as dried. if I see the better result, definitely would continue to use it.</li>
    <li> Great value for the price! Skin and hair feel soft after using this. A must for the daily routine.</li>
    <li> Great product; so many uses.</li>
    <li> I love this product. I have curly hair that gets frizzy in the summer. I put a few drops in my hands and work thru my hair and then put a plastic cap on for a little while. Let it dry natural and it&#x27;s soft and shiny</li>
    <li> Amazing oil that can be used everywhere....split ends, dry cuticles, cracked heels, facial wrinkles, etc.  LOVE this oil!</li>
    <li> I love this product! It is high quality. My face just soaks it up. I use this for my moisturizer. It leaves my skin so soft. I&#x27;ve even had my husband start using it. He loves it too! I highly recommend this product for your face!</li>
    <li> I found Pura d&#x27;or argan oil when searching for a pure body moisturizer free of chemicals.  I have been using it daily on my body and hair for a year and absolutely love it.  My skin is very sensitive to most products, but after using this 100% pure argan oil it has been clear of any breakouts.  I also had surgery six months ago and found that my scar healed incredibly well thanks to this product.  Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> I use this for dry and aging skin care.  I love it!  I use it straight out of the bottle and also add it to a serum that I make.  It moisturizes and conditions my skin and it feels and looks FABULOUS!  I can&#x27;t say enough -- and the price is great too.</li>
    <li> The best argan oil I have ever used on my face on my hair and I have tried many different brands I just love how it doesn&#x27;t feel  Greasy this argan oil  absorbs nicely into the skin and does wonders on dry skin on wrinkles very  moist  hydrateing your skin very nicely  plumps your skin helps my upper lip lines it works great on my hair split ends happy  customer</li>
    <li> Fantastic product and packaging from Pura d&#x27;or. I have been using argan oil for about 6 months as a facial moisturizer and can&#x27;t say enough good things about it. I was very skeptical at first and not sure how my rather sensitive skin would react to being &amp;#34;oiled up&amp;#34;, but now I can say I&#x27;m truly impressed and will be usng it as long as I can get my hands on it. It feels great and soaks into the skin nicely- never feels greasy. I love that it&#x27;s 100% pure, renewable, organic and all natural giving me peace of mind that there will be no negative side effects to using it for many years. A 4oz. bottle lasts many months even using it twice a day because a little goes a long way. Convenient pump-top bottle is perfect for easy use. Very fair price as well because it lasts so long.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been a big Argan oil fan for a while, and instead of buying the different products with added things like fragrance, i prefer the 100%, straight up Argan oil for my hair and face. This one is almost identical to the Josie Maran argan oil from sephora and at a much better value. The only thing different is the smell, and i actually prefer this one (it&#x27;s subtle). I highly recommend this product and will definitely use on my belly when pregnant with baby #2.</li>
    <li> Very happy with the purchase. I apply a few drops of the oil to my hair during particularly dry days, as well as use as a moisturizer on my face and hands after my prescription creams. Provides great moisturizing effect without weighing my hair down, and moisturizes my skin without making it very greasy.</li>
    <li> my hair feels soo silky velvety :) and best part is its an organic stuff:)</li>
    <li> This item arrived in a timely way, packaged well.  I have to say I waited a few weeks before writing this review just to give it an honest opinion.  I really DO love this product!  I use it after shower or bath time at night, and again before applying makeup in the mornings.  I&#x27;m not going to lie and say my wrinkles are gone (though, honestly...I do think it is helping!!!)....however I do notice a difference in the way my skin feels and looks, and especially how my makeup goes on.  I seemed to have quite a problem with dry-looking skin across my forehead several hours after applying my makeup but this has definitely corrected that.  No problems with it being &amp;#34;too oily&amp;#34; and causing pimples or anything like that,  I also have a problem with sometimes itchy, dry patches on my fingers (possibly psoriatic arthritis?? Don&#x27;t know for sure).  I&#x27;ve tried many, many things over the years for this problem with nothing really helping.  This seems to have  definitely helped that also!  I am guessing that it will be amazing with dry, cracked skin on hands over the winter that my husband seems to have a problem with!  So yes, I would definitely recommend this product especially for those of us over 50, and will absolutely be using it in my daily regimen!  Thanks for a great product!!!!!</li>
    <li> i have tried lotions and oils for years....nothing compares to the clean, light, long-lasting feeling of this product. Every morning, every evening. after any swim or shower...and i will take my chances in the long run on healthier and healthier looking skin</li>
    <li> My husband and I have been using Pura d&#x27;or Argan Oil for over 2 years now. My husband used it on his face because he&#x27;s a contractor working in the sun all day. He loves it! Helps dryness but does not have an oil feel to it once it sinks in and he has noticed a small amount of wrinkles smoothhing out. I use the oil primarily for my hair. If you color or bleach your hair thisArgan Oil works wonders for mine.It smooths it down and gives it beautiful shine without making it look limp anf oily like other brands. I even use the oil on my elbows or heels if they get really dry and like I said above it absorbs so fast it doesnt leave anything feeling oily. Definately love buying a product that has several differant uses AND my husband can use without saying , &amp;#34;Im not using that girly stuff.&amp;#34; Ha, nope, EVERYONE can use it.</li>
    <li> I have been using this from the past one month on my hair. Hair fall is reduced and my hair became so soft. I have used many oils for my hair and nothing worked until I found out Pura Argan oil. It&#x27;s been working well for me so far as I can see my hair strengthen and became thick. I would definitely recommend this to any one. I came to know about Argan oil from Dr. Oz&#x27;s show and I am happy it worked.</li>
    <li> I truly have no words to express how wonderful this product is.  I have literally stopped using three other great hair oils (my staples) and have replaced it with Pura d&#x27;or.  Actually, my first experience with argan oil was a month ago.  I tried Agadir argan oil and was quite pleased, but after seeing the rave reviews for Pura d&#x27;or, I decided to give it a try.  I am so glad I did.  Pura d&#x27;or is really different from other argan oils and has transformed my hair.  My hair has never been more shiny, more soft, more healthy looking, or frizz free.  After trying it for just one day, my husband asked me if I was using something different on my hair.  He noticed the shine and bounce immediately.  At that point, I knew this was going to be my new hair staple.  Thank you for such a great product.  Please, please do not stop producing this oil...I absolutely love it!!!</li>
    <li> Not bad at all for the price. very little smell, but not as effective as the more expensive products</li>
    <li> This is the real deal.  There are lots of products that contain a small amount of argan oil, but Pura d&#x27;or is 100% argan oil.  I recieved the oil a week ago, but here is what I&#x27;ve learned.  I have dry hair from coloring it every 6 to 8 weeks.  For my hair, I massage a few drops of argan oil into my hair before I shampoo (I let it stay in for just a few minutes).  After I wash my hair, it is silky smooth and much easier to style.  I tried to put a drop in my hair after I used the blow dryer, but it seemed too heavy for my hair.  As for my face, I suffer from acne and wrinkles around the eyes.  As odd as it sounds, I massage 2 drops of argan oil into my face each morning for about 30 seconds.  The acne on my face is healing and -- the best -- wrinkles are starting to be less noticable.  I wondered why this worked and did a little research.  Here&#x27;s what I found out.  Argan oil is natural anti-inflammatory, so the nasty pimples look less red and swollen (yes...that includes those deep cyst-acne!) and it promotes good cell growth.  As for the wrinkles, argan oil is full of vitamin E.  My only warning...use a small amount of the oil.  You might be tempted to think the more the better, but with argan oil, little goes a L-O-N-G way.  You might have to use a little trial and error to find the right amount to use for your skin and hair.  I&#x27;m starting to use the oil as a body moisturizer, but haven&#x27;t used it long enough to tell you how well it works.</li>
    <li> Makes my hair and skin feel nice.  The price is not bad and it should last for a really long time.  I like that it has a pump top that dispenses just the right amount (though sometimes I use 2 pumps if I feel especially dry).</li>
    <li> No bad smell, helps my skin improve over the lotion I was using, I love it!</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing.  My face gets really dry after washing, but I use this stuff every night and it keeps my face moist.  I also use it under my eyes and it has helped reduce the bags under my eyes.  I highly recommend this.</li>
    <li> I received this oil very quickly. The first thing I wanted to do is to smell it because some of these oils have a strange smell. This one is fine. It asorbs really well, I use it everyday in conjunction with my dermawand and even to take off eye makeup. I have yet to use it on the hair. I have high hopes. I will definetly repurchase and i&#x27;m considering purchasing the company&#x27;s other product as they&#x27;re very clean and natural.</li>
    <li> My husband and I started to use this incredible oil for our faces and hair and absolutely love the clean, not oily but rich feeling and shine that it leaves on our skin and hair. The fact that it is a pure organic product is incredibly important to us as well. We are excited to have come across this wonderful, time tested product and are happy to recommend it.</li>
    <li> Lovely. Good smell, them pump is worth it.</li>
    <li> This is a winner, love the spray bottle, gives just the right amount. A little goes a long way. Also, it comes in a cloth bag that keeps you from dropping the glass bottle.</li>
    <li> I use this as a nighttime facec ream and so far I really like. Waiting to see improvement in my skin.</li>
    <li> Excellent product and value at around $5.50 an ounce. Face and hair&lt;br /&gt;are greatly improved.</li>
    <li> This argan oil is excellent and a terrific value for the price. I&#x27;ve used higher end argan oils and I feel they are equal in quality to this product which is also organic. I use it as a facial moisturizer, hair de-frizzer, and waterproof makeup remover and I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I have used this oil for 6 months now and love it.  I use it primarily on my face but also rub a little of the extra into my hair.  I love the way it absorbs easily -- it goes on a little oily, but does not stay that way.  People often comment how great my skin looks and I think it&#x27;s the dewey or moisturized look they are responding to. Great Product!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my face and hair and I wasn&#x27;t very impressed (I have very tough skin to work with) but then my 8 month old son broke out in crazy eczema and I remembered reading the little card that came with the bottle, which said that argan oil is used to cure eczema. I used one drop on each body part and amazingly, his skin started clearing up after just one use! Within 4 days, his skin was totally clear except for the really deep spots that had been there for a while! I don&#x27;t like to use products with too many ingredients on his baby skin so this is perfect for him, and a little goes a long way!</li>
    <li> This is the best Argan oil you can buy. I bought Argan directly from the source in Morocco. As I was skeptical about the seller claims on Amazon I compared both oils. Let me tell you, it is authentic and organic as the the oil from the very source of it.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for a couple of weeks now and I really like it. It absorbs quickly and leaves my skin soft and my hair shiny. I would definitely buy it again.</li>
    <li> it is an amazing product.it make my hair smooth and freeze free.it is so light and it doesn&#x27;t have any smell.I normally use it after sampoo as a leave in conditioner and it make my hair smooth and freeze free.just love the product.</li>
    <li> Luv luv luv this oil.  I use it all over my body.  I have dry skin and hair and it can be used anywhere.  I am prone to breakouts and it has not caused any breakouts.  100% natural.  Will definitely buy again</li>
    <li> Just received my shampoo yesterday and used it this morning....wow it&#x27;s fabulous. I&#x27;ve used many other organic shampoos and&lt;br /&gt;this by far is the best. This is the first product I can actually feel the difference after the first use. The reason I gave it a 4 star review&lt;br /&gt;is that the odor is not appealing to me. It lathered very well and my hair felt clean. I not only had to use very little conditioner but&lt;br /&gt;I did not see any hair coming out. Yeah:) I will have to see if it helps my hair loss. I&#x27;m very excited to see the results. I also thought&lt;br /&gt;it was a bit expensive but if it holds up to its claims I will definitely continue to buy.</li>
    <li> I just love this product.  I use it in my nails, skin and hair.  It leaves the skin smooth without been oily.  It penetrates quickly and hydrates the area leaving it well moisturized.  I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Thank you for your excellent product. I&#x27;ve been suffering from extremely damaged skin and have been diagnosed with melanoma. I&#x27;ve tried many different brands of Argan oil and nothing has helped. Now that I am using Pura d&#x27;or argan oil everyday, I can feel the difference. I&#x27;m very happy because it significantly reduced the itchiness and dryness. I personally find Pura d&#x27;or very effective. It has helped my skin to heal more quickly and also keeps it very hydrated.</li>
    <li> Good product , fast  shipment, thank you A+++++</li>
    <li> Love it Love it!  Excellent moisturizer for face arms legs. . .everwhere!</li>
    <li> This is a miracle in a bottle! I decided to use this oil twice a day for a whole week before my review. First, this oil has left my split ends now looking  healthier than I have seen in years. Second, I applied this oil on my stretch marks and I have seen a little improvement and I believe they will all be cleared with consistent /continous use. This oil is a keeper!</li>
    <li> I recently purchased this product. I have used Argon oil products before, and I know it is very beneficial for so many grooming and health issues. What I never cared for was the smell. It wasn&#x27;t horrible but it wasn&#x27;t pleasant. However, when I received this variety of the oil I was pleasantly surprised. It smells nice, and it soaks into the skin quickly. It doesn&#x27;t leave any type of oily residue on my skin or clothes. This is the best brand of Argon oil I have used. I will be buying Pura d&#x27;or Argan oil only from now on.</li>
    <li> Good quality argan oil. Silky hair after application!</li>
    <li> It is ridiculous how much money I&#x27;ve spent on moisturizers over the years, when all along I could&#x27;ve been investing in this Argan oil as an alternative.  I&#x27;ve only used this on my face so far and the results have been outstanding! I highly recommend this to anyone looking for an all purpose moisturizer that, surprisingly (considering it&#x27;s an oil), doesn&#x27;t cause blockage.</li>
    <li> Very lightweight oil that has markedly improved skin texture. Use religiously in winter to hydrate and repair hair. Large bottle. Indicates that once opened it should be used within 18 months.</li>
    <li> Nice non pore clogging oil! Skin is soft and smooth!!!</li>
    <li> Oil to clear up acne? Surely you jest!  The results are in though--argan oil promotes clear skin.  Acne, rosacea, dryness--all  minimized.  I used a pricier argan oil initially, tried several other brands after (each with a funky odor) and settled happily on Pura d&#x27;or. Great product for a great price</li>
    <li> I have been using this product and found great results. I use it on my face in the night and my skin appears to be very soft and fresh next morning. I will definitely continue to use this product and recommend to others.</li>
    <li> I really love this product! It adsorbs into the skin quickly and I have noticed an improved texture and feel to my skin. I would recommend this product, it is a nice quality argan oil at a good price.</li>
    <li> Excellent product. Been using for months and saw a difference in my complexion and add luster to my hair. I highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> Great product.  Makes my skin feel hydrated and doesn&#x27;t feel greasy at all.  No odor or strong smell.  I highly recommend this product for people with dry skin and also good for hands and hair.  Love this oil.  Free shipping was also a bonus.</li>
    <li> I just received this today and used some on my face and it feels amazing! My skin is very dry from the sun and this just makes it feel great and my makeup went on smoothly. Helps with fine lines! Now for my hands and feet!! I will buy this product again and again!</li>
    <li> I love using Argan oil ever since. This thing works the best like the other more expensive brand. I use this mainly for my face as moisturizer, also for my hair and nails and it works well.</li>
    <li> I just learned about argan oil recently and am completely in love with it. I have classic white-girl frizzy hair and no matter how well I treat it it always frizzes during the summer. This is the ONLY thing that has worked to keep my hair soft, frizz-less, and healthy. And it doesn&#x27;t make it oily, either! I did some research on various brands and distributors of argan oil, since I heard that some aren&#x27;t processed correctly or can even be tested on animals, but from what I can tell Pura d&#x27;or is actually a good product! I might even give it a shot on my nails and skin.</li>
    <li> Both my wife and I use this argan oil daily as a moisturizer. I have oily skin, and I find that using argan oil actually makes my skin feel less oily. Use this after a shower to lock in the moisture. I find Pura d&#x27; or a high quality product and have no hesitation recommending it.</li>
    <li> Amazing oil,  been using it for years! Good for acne and dandruff.</li>
    <li> I am 52 yrs young and have been using this product for around 2 months.  I purchased for wrinkles around eyes and mouth and dark bags under eyes.  This product works well at making these quite a bit less pronounced but lets face it nothing short of plastic surgery will completely get rid of aging signs.  I have tried Olay regenerist, Olay ProX, Cindy Crawford stuff and others and so far this is the one that I like best.  I does feel a little oily if applied too thickly, which I do at night for extra moisturizing and replenishing.  Also it keeps your facial skin feeling smooth and supple. I like that it&#x27;s all natural and it&#x27;s just wash and wear, not a big regimen to go through.  I would recommend to anyone who isn&#x27;t expecting miracles.  I will be purchasing this product again even though I think that it is a little spendy.</li>
    <li> I thought this would make me break out but it&#x27;s actually been a really great moisturizer. It hasn&#x27;t cleared my acne much but it hasn&#x27;t hurt it either. I like using this instead of regular lotion. It also smooths my frizzy hair a bit too. I&#x27;ve been adding it to the less effective jojoba oil to help stretch it out.</li>
    <li> I bought this to use on the ends of my hair after switching to a &amp;#34;no poo&amp;#34; method of washing my hair and scalp to protect the ends from over drying (I still blow dry my hair). I ended up also using it for my face. That&#x27;s right, my face. I threw out my expensive, chemical laden ProActiv+ and instead massage some of the Pura d&#x27;or 100% Pure &amp; USDA Organic Argan Oil on my face. Then I cover my face with a hot wet washcloth and let it cool. After it cools I wipe my entire face, leaving a thin layer of the Argan Oil. I switched for a couple of days to castor oil and olive oil for washing my face, but after getting a few bumps switched back to this oil. Lo and behold the bumps disappeared! This oil is wonderful, my skin and hair are loving it! So nice to have unexpectedly found an all-in-one beauty product that is all natural and without added perfumes and other irritants.</li>
    <li> I got this oil a week back and I&#x27;m using it everyday on my face &amp; hair. I didn&#x27;t find any change on face or hair though I&#x27;ll give a try for a month or so. This is my first try on Argan oil and I am not very happy with it.</li>
    <li> Starting using this around my eyes and wow! After 2 weeks I am looking years younger and have been asked multiple times what I use on my skin.  Great stuff.</li>
    <li> I use this everyday. 2 squirts for my face and 2 for my hair. My face never feels oily (a relief for acne prone skin) or dry and my hair stays silky (no more coarse hair!) I&#x27;ve purchased my first bottle in September and just now ordering my second (still have a 1-2 months left on the first)</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for about 3 weeks now, on my skin, hair and even a natural, human hair wig that is prone to tangling. So far I am very happy with the Pura d&#x27;or organic argan oil. My skin feeling silky, my hair smooth and the wig is much more manageable and less prone to tangling. And this, during a cold snap in Virginia, where the air is incredibly dry. Very happy!</li>
    <li> Love love love this oil. I use it every night. It is very moisturizing on my extremely dry skin. This oil works better for me than night creams because it does not irritate my skin. If you have very dry skin I highly recommend.</li>
    <li> This product is \\&quot; just as good \\&quot; as the more expensive Josie Maran product.  In order to save money, one could use coconut oil however, one would smell like a coconut. I have used argan oil for a year now and it really is a miracle product and pure too, no worry about chemicals.</li>
    <li> This. Product is amazing. I have started using this and my hair is thinning.</li>
    <li> I bought this to use on my beard, because I had heard great things about Argan oil and facial hair. I started using it, and it was amazing the difference that I saw in my facial hair! My beard is softer than it&#x27;s ever been, it&#x27;s smooth too. I will order this product again, and would recommend it to anyone!</li>
    <li> This is oil is great for my skin. I love using it everyday. My skin now feels smoother and moisturized. I would recommend this to everyone.</li>
    <li> I ordered this as a gift for my mom. She&#x27;s into beauty products and I had heard that argan oil is an excellent natural moisturizer. She loves it! The price point of this product is why it deserves 5 stars. Fair price, fair trade, organic, and useful.</li>
    <li> I have been extremely satisfied with using this Argan Oil over the past few months. Many friends had suggested I order it to help with skin moisturizing and face blemishes. I feel it does a great job at keeping my completion looking healthy, especially during these dry winter months. It&#x27;s replaced my night moisturizer....and I&#x27;m loving it!</li>
    <li> Very very very disappointed with this product. I ordered the shampoo and the oil. Let me tell you . I&#x27;m for&lt;br /&gt;Morocco and this oil has nothing to do with argan oil. I can&#x27;t believe I paid this much for vegetable oil. It smells and feels exactly like and vegetable oil. Dint waste your time. When I start using the shampoo my hair start falling more.its not even worth one star.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing; I&#x27;ve tried it right away when I received it. It really helps the skin hydration.&lt;br /&gt;I felt my skin is plump and silky soft after using it.  Also applied some on my face and it was very good.&lt;br /&gt;Strongly recommended for dry skin.</li>
    <li> Great oil, especially during winter when my skin feel so dry, my makeup lays beautifully over it. Not as pleasant smelling as Josie Maran but the price makes it right and the smell is very tolerable. Worth the buy.</li>
    <li> When I first used it, I thought it was oily because it is real &amp;#34;OIL&amp;#34;.  However, my skin absorbed it within a short time, leaving no greasy feeling at all.  It cures my dry skin, and leaves it soft.  I use it on my face and with the left over on my palm, apply to my hair.  Good natural product.  Definitely would recommend to my friends who have dry skin.</li>
    <li> This was recommended to me by a relative.  It works great; especially in the winter time!  Skin is always dry but this feels great and non-greasy.</li>
    <li> This Argan oil is very nice; the order was placed in December, 2013 or January 2014 through another vendor and I received it in January 2014.  The shipper shipped it right away and by March, I reordered.  I really like this argan oil more than many very expensive argan oils I also ordered.  It is rich, non-drying on the skin and has improved my skin quite a bit. During the winter months, my hands get really dry and cracky, with this oil it improves them.  I like very much.</li>
    <li> Makes skin and hair beautiful. I have acne and does not make me break out. It&#x27;s expensive but goes a long way if you just use on face. If you use on hair and body, goes too fast but still worth it!</li>
    <li> This oil has helped make my face look very smooth. The dryness under my eyes is much improved. I have already ordered another so that I do not run out</li>
    <li> it was my first try with Argon oil. I chose this brand because of the very good recommendation of this site!! after using my normal skin was dry!! opposite as it suppose to be!!!!!!!!!!!! I&#x27;m not sure  if the Argon oil doesn&#x27;t work for me or this brand is not that good as many people written review?!!!?!!! I stopped using it after 10 days!!</li>
    <li> Very good result&#x27;s with your Argan oil and I will order again in the future.  It is important to get only the purest Moroccan oil and this is very excellent quality from&lt;br /&gt;the short period I have been using it.</li>
    <li> I read the reviews before purchasing, and now after using the Pura D&#x27;or Pure and Organic Argan Oil I&#x27;m here to tell you that this product is just as wonderful as everyone is saying.  A little bit goes a very long way - for my hair which is a couple of inches below my shoulders I only need about half a pump&#x27;s worth of oil.  This will be especially useful in the upcoming winter months for controlling static-y hair, it did a great job helping me make my hair look good during these last few humid weeks of summer.  I&#x27;ve used this on my skin as well.  A couple of times when I&#x27;ve had some sort of minor irritation - a dry patch on my skin, for instance, and after one or two uses the irritation is completely gone.</li>
    <li> I have been tried this product for a month now and I love it. It really work very good for my skin. I have very dry, flaky skin. I using every night on my face and my body. My face skin is soft and dark cirle slowly fade away. I can see the result after 1 week.</li>
    <li> I researched several Argan oils and chose this one-its perfect in quality, price and presentation. I highly suggest you buy it to smear on your nails, face and scalp.</li>
    <li> This argan oil is perfect for dry hydrating dry hair or to maintain a healthy shine . It has a low viscosity so it absorbs well and feels light.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I believe argan oil works better than any other oil for hydrating hair. It doesn&#x27;t leave a bad odor, a little goes a long way, and your hair doesn&#x27;t feel too weighted down.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s pure argan oil, without fillers, at a reasonable price. Good stuff; I&#x27;d buy it again.</li>
    <li> I love this product, I tried on face &amp; hands &amp; its great. my face felt so soft &amp; supple.</li>
    <li> I have been using this brand for about 3 years. I&#x27;ve tried others, but this one is the best for its money. I use it on a daily basis and have recommended it to my friends and family. Great product!</li>
    <li> I was traveling to Las Vegas for an annual work trip where my hair and skin typically get extremely dry. I purchased this oil to bring along with me and it made all the difference in the world! I used it on my hair and face every night before bed. Instead of the straw-like hair I can&#x27;t get a brush through, my hair was smooth and manageable. I also feel as though it helped with my dry face ... so much so that I will be incorporating it into my nighttime beauty routine now that I am back home in NY.  It definitely has a more greasy feel on my skin than my regular nighttime anti-aging cream, but it hasn&#x27;t caused any breakouts or anything of that nature.</li>
    <li> This is great stuff.  It arrived quickly and was packaged thoughtfully.  I am using it for my hair and face.  I love that it leaves my hair shiny and frizz free.  It&#x27;s easy to apply and has become a new part of my daily beauty routine.</li>
    <li> I had started using the Olay Regenerist serum and was disappointed in how long it took me to get through my product. Then I had a friend introduce me to this stuff, and I gotta say, I am in love.&lt;br /&gt;I will use 1-1.5 pumps of this on my face depending on how dry it is. I haven&#x27;t had any breakouts related to the oil or anything, and it actually creates a lovely glow on my face that leads many to believe I have gotten a tan.&lt;br /&gt;I have had no problems wearing this under my makeup and it is a regular part of my beauty routine.&lt;br /&gt;Another positive is that if you have excess oil on your hands you can use it elsewhere on your body or in your hair. It&#x27;s multi purpose.</li>
    <li> Smells exactly like OLIVE oil. Did nothing special for my face. Goes back.</li>
    <li> Love this product!  Not too greasy, perfect for hair and face hydration. I have been using for about a month and already have noticed an improvement!</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t help my acne the way that I had hoped it would, but it is a really great moisturizer for my skin and hair. It has been great for my face and hair and I have also put it on my cuticles and they look much better. I plan to keep using it.</li>
    <li> Awesome product. Doesn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling greasy. Love how I can use it for my face and hair.</li>
    <li> Just got it, seems okay so far.</li>
    <li> This oil is great! It works wonders on my hair and skin. It is the only oil I will ever use from now on. I love that it&#x27;s organic and natural. It&#x27;s not greasy and heavy on my hair or skin. I use it after showers, on cuts and bruises, my hair, my feet, and my lips. It also works well on my face when I have a rash due to lupus.</li>
    <li> High quality. A little goes a long way!</li>
    <li> I have gotten many compliments since I started using this argan oil on my face, some said that my skin looks radiant and others ask what am I doing to give my face such a nice glow..  I luv it :)</li>
    <li> Very happy with this product - I&#x27;ve been using for several months now. I have super sensitive skin and have experienced no irritation at all. My skin is glowing &amp; I&#x27;m a fan for life!</li>
    <li> It’ great!!! You can use on your hair, face, nails etc. I use it mostly on my hair and this oil makes it stronger, shinier and well nourished. If you want to strengthen your nails or your body needs moisture and hydration, then you will see how great this Argan oil is for you. It also absorbs really fast and all you will feel is fresh. I&#x27;ve been using this for a week now and have noticed the glow in skin already. I highly recommend this product. STOP looking elsewhere, GO BUY IT!!!</li>
    <li> Great product. Makes my hair shiney and soft and you dont need to use a lot.  Totally worth the money.</li>
    <li> Excellent product... Meets all my expectations. It has such a delicious aroma and one can see results just from the first application and even greater ones with time...</li>
    <li> Pleasantly surprised. Prompt delivery, love packaging. I purchased for hair and skin. No residue on hair. No unpleasant smell.</li>
    <li> I have tried other organic argan oil in the past and this works better for me; the oil absorbs quickly and my skin looks glowing and natural.</li>
    <li> This Argan oil has been a very happy surprise for my hair. I have really frizzy hair that seems to have a mind of it&#x27;s own. I have tried so many hair products that did not help so I was skeptical that this Argan Oil would be any different but I decided to try it anyway. I am very happy with the way this product makes my hair look and feel. It has more shine than it has had for a long time and it feels silky. This product has helped me get rid of frizz. Just remember that a little goes a long way so don&#x27;t overuse it. I have been using this on my hair for about 3 weeks now and my nails are also looking better. Before I had some hang nails and now they are gone and my nails are smoother. It&#x27;s kind of amazing to me. I haven&#x27;t tried this as a moisturizer yet but I think I am going to give it a try. I can say it has noticeably helped my hair and nails. I am pleased that it is an organic product and I will most definitely keep using it. Good product and good price!!</li>
    <li> Product is great for healthy hair, keeps hair strong, smooth and soft.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful product!  I originally bought it for use on my face, but have since used it on my hair, nails, and skin.  I&#x27;m a swimmer, and use it in my hair and on my face to help protect against the harsh effects of chlorine in the pool.  It love to use it daily on my nails and hair.  The effects are immediate and just what I would expect a good oil to accomplish.  Also, one doesn&#x27;t need to use much.  Just a couple of drops at a time, so a bottle lasts a good long time!</li>
    <li> I noticed the difference from the first use, may hair feels silky, shiny , and does not have the oily sticky feeling.  I simply love it</li>
    <li> Very satisfied with this oil. I like how it soaks into your pores leaving no greasy film like many alternative oils I&#x27;ve tried</li>
    <li> from the first drop i put it on my hand and wiped it on my body, I felt the value of the original ARGAN OIL&lt;br /&gt;I wished that I bought another one</li>
    <li> I have been using this daily on my face and love how nourishing it is! Would definitely purchase again</li>
    <li> This product is truly amazing. I have curly hair and I am currently using it on my hair everyday.. It was never so soft and smooth! I love the way it feels with this oil. Also, after researching a lot on line I truly believe this product is one of he best out there! Worth every $.</li>
    <li> LOVE IT! Skin just seems to drink it up leaving it soft to the touch Without being greasy.</li>
    <li> I actually used to buy the expensive Josie Maran Argan oil but realized I could probably find another as good at a lesser cost.  I gave Pura d or a try and was quite happy to say that is is as GOOD as the Josie Maran product. and you can buy two bottle for the price of one of hers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have recieved many compliments about how youthful and smooth my skin looks after being a sun worshipper for a good portion of my life and at the ripe old age of 58.  Amazing product that I will definetly recommend to my friends!</li>
    <li> I only received my bottle of Pura D&#x27;or Argan Oil 2 days ago. I&#x27;ve used it 4 times (2 evenings and 2 mornings). I use it instead of my all natural face lotion, and purchased it because of the many great reviews. I&#x27;m in my early 40&#x27;s and I&#x27;m not sure what&#x27;s going on with my hormones, but my face has been horrible lately. I&#x27;m also prone to rosacea. I&#x27;ve been getting acne on my chin and cheeks a lot. I was excited to find a natural product that so many people had found good results for acne. I honestly didn&#x27;t think it was possible, but in just 2 days I can see a huge difference!! Usually I try a new product and wait and wait, and see nothing different. This time it was different. My skin is less red and my acne has already improved, I&#x27;d say about 1/2 has bad as it was. It&#x27;s not completely gone, but I&#x27;m confident that it won&#x27;t be long...after all it&#x27;s only been 2 days!! I love how silky it makes your skin, and can&#x27;t think of a better word to describe it. I will keep using it as my only face moisturizer and can&#x27;t wait until all my acne and rosacea redness is gone for good.</li>
    <li> Hubby loves it ! Very light and fragrance free.</li>
    <li> Just a small bit really works</li>
    <li> This stuff is great!  I put it on my face before I go to bed and I wake up completely moisturized!</li>
    <li> I am almost done with a full bottle of this I bought here at Amazon. It was okay but didn&#x27;t really see that much difference in my skin or scalp from it. I do use Jojoba Oil on a regular basis too, so perhaps that has something to do with not seeing that much difference from using the Argan Oil. I bought this brand based on the Amazon reviews but my girlfriend bought a different brand here that cost about half as much and I actually liked the dispenser at the top of her bottle better and the oil seemed pretty much the same. So, Argan oil seems a little over hyped in terms of benefits and this particular brand a little overpriced while their spray dispenser at the top of the bottle seemed like it could be better, when compared to others.</li>
    <li> I have been using this oil for the past three months and it is simply wonderful. Completely non greasy, feels very light and all through the winter I did not need to use anything else at all. Usually I have to be carefule with what I use on my face as I have an oily skin, however with the Pura d&#x27;or I had no such concern. I used it for my self and my two little girls and they love it too. We use it for our face and hand mostly and sometimes for the hair.</li>
    <li> hi..it works fine for me..but as mentioned online( ingredients list) as 100% pure argan oil is not showing anywhere  on the bottle nor on the slip given with the package..i would be more happier if it is really true 100% pure argan oil.</li>
    <li> I bought this oil because I read that Argan oil was supposed to make your hair healthier and shinier as well as help it grow and prevent split ends.  I have been using this oil for over three months now and I am very pleased.  I am not sure if it has sped up my hair growth, but I do feel that my hair is healthier, shinier, and has no split ends.  I plan to use this product again in the future.</li>
    <li> Great oil I mainly purchased for my hair. Its thick, but not overly so. I also use it as a moisturizer for my face in the winter. I thought the bitlle was dropper styled, but its actually a pump. Small details I suppose.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this product for about a week now and so far so good.  There is no crazy &amp;#34;fowl odor&amp;#34; that I have noticed, as some have commented on.  The squirt nozzle works great and appears to squirt out a decent dose.  The oil itself works quickly to moisturize, especially winter dry skin.  My boyfriend is also excited to try this oil.  Also, the prize is amazing for a 4 ounce bottle.  I will be coming back for more.</li>
    <li> I bought this on Groupon, when they had a deal. I purchased it with intention of using it on my hair, since a lot of the reviews said how light-weight it is, and that it does not leave your hair greasy.For me, it left my hair greasy every time I applied it on wet hair and dried it with a blow drier. I&#x27;ve tried 3 leave-in hair oils, including this one, and this is the only one that left grease. My favorite for hair care is Moroccan Oil (R).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now for skin - it&#x27;s EXCELLENT! It makes my skin glow throughout the day when I apply it in the morning. I used it on my feet once or twice, and they became incomparably softer than before. No other product has given me this effect. And it didn&#x27;t require much of it either! Very happy :) it lasts a lonnnngg time!</li>
    <li> Works well for shiny, silky hair. Only one pump tho, if more hair looks greasy</li>
    <li> Extremely happy with this product. It can be used to soften hands and tame frizzy hair. It works very well for me. It doesn&#x27;t leave my hair sticky or greasy but makes my hair soft and shiny. This bottle will last a while because you don&#x27;t really need a lot. I will buy this product again.</li>
    <li> The things that keep me reaching for this bottle every night are 1) it&#x27;s all natural,  2) it gives just the right amount of moisture (and I live in a super-dry climate), 3) I&#x27;m a sensitive-skinned fair woman and it keeps my skin calm. I have other creams, but every night I go for this! Great find!</li>
    <li> Being a mom made me sway to the &#x27;natural&#x27; side for 2 years now, I only use organic products on my baby who is now a full blown toddler with frizzy curly hair (my genes). I&#x27;ve been planning on getting some leave in conditioner for her when I remembered how I used argan oil in my pre pregnancy days. I got this and it&#x27;s worked beautifully!! I use it on her and my hair, on my lashes, on my face (even though i have combination skin it doesn&#x27;t break me out), on my nails and every dry spot my daughter has. It has no smell and it&#x27;s absorbed quite quickly, love love love it!</li>
    <li> This is a great product, I used to use Josie Maran Argan oil, which is so expensive, $48 for 1.7 oz, so when I tried this I was a little leary, but I have used it now for at least 3 weeks or so, and I really like it, you can smell a little of the Tea Tree Oil in it, but thats good for your skin too so its like a double advantage I think...for the price and having it feel just as good as the expensive stuff I would give this a try, just hope they still have it when I run out, so I can order more.  :)</li>
    <li> Excellent product. Reduces hair loss for me.  Leaves hair smooth and shiny.  I strongly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I needed to replace my Josie Maran argan oil and decided on this one based on reviews. Let me tell you, for the price, I really couldn&#x27;t beat it. I noticed the scent, which the Josie Maran does not have-- but it isn&#x27;t overpowering and it went away after applying the oil. The color and texture seem to be about equal between the two products. The only other difference I noticed is that this doesn&#x27;t soak in as quickly as the Josie Maran. I&#x27;m not really going to complain because this is a huge bottle and I can feel not guilty about putting it other places other than my face--like elbows and cuticles. I would probably buy this again if I wasn&#x27;t constantly trying to find the best thing out there for my face.</li>
    <li> Excelent for skin disorders. I recomend it.</li>
    <li> I love this product.  I first discovered Argan Oil about a year ago when a friend had given me some beauty prroducts that she didn&#x27;t want.  There were Argan Oil capsules and I tried them.  I loved the way my skin felt after I used them and the best part is that the product is not in the least bit greasy.  I use it every night on my face and my neck and if my hair starts feeling dry at the ends I apply some and it in overnight.  I would highly recommend this product to any woman!</li>
    <li> I purchased this Argan Oil based on reviews.  I trust my \\&quot;friends\\&quot; on Amazon.  That said, I have to say that I was dissapointed.  I have used another, more expensive, Argan oil in the past, and really liked the nutty smell.  It was also a light yellow color.  The Pura D&#x27;or Argan Oil is clear with a VERY FAINT medicinal smell.  I have read that Tree Tea oil is used to clean the press equipment, so I get that smell, but I am dissapointed that it doesn&#x27;t resemble my previous experience with Argan Oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will try this oil for a while, and re-post if I change my opinion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(Update:  Well, it has been 5 months since I purchased this oil.  In my opinion it just doesn&#x27;t work as good as other argan oils I have used.  There is no pleasant smell, and I have not found any improvement in my hair or skin.  I am worried that I have been having a reaction to the product as well.  Two times I have tried using this on my skin, and both times I have broken out with a small rash.  Thinking that it was a fluke, I let my skin clear up then tried again.... same rash.  Guess I will be throwing this money out.)</li>
    <li> I love this product. Perfect for both hair and face. Better than expensive higher brand! Will buy again!</li>
    <li> I love this stuff, it&#x27;s really light weight, I use it on my face and it doesn&#x27;t make me break out or anything. I have extremely sensitive skin, I even get rashes from salicylic acid, the main ingredient of most acne washes, but my skin loves this stuff.</li>
    <li> I love this oil- it absorbs easily into the skin, is not oily or doesn&#x27;t leave a residue. Friends say it looks like some wrinkles have disappeared. I will definitely be buying more!</li>
    <li> I just started using it about 1 week ago so this is not a full on review I will update as time goes on.  It gives my skin a really soft feel.  Its better to use it fresh out of the shower while your skin is still warm. To me it has that normal oil smell, it doesn&#x27;t smell sweet or anything like that and its not strong to where people can smell it on you. But it arrived and looks like the picture.</li>
    <li> just ordered my 4th bottle-I love this on hair-nails and face !</li>
    <li> I tried it and it is amazing.  My skin soaked it up and it made the dry skin disappear.  My skin is not as itchy and I am going to try more products from this company.  I&#x27;ve tried lots of moisturizers but this one was the best.  Thank you for this product.</li>
    <li> I love this oil! I use it on my skin everyday and always get compliments on my skin!</li>
    <li> I use this on my hair and so far I love it.  Leaves it soft and feeling great.</li>
    <li> It is expensive, but I prefer to pay more for an organic product. I bought from dailysteals cheaper, so it worth it.</li>
    <li> I bought the 4 oz bottle about a year ago and it has lasted me well. Make sure you don&#x27;t use a lot of this, else it can become very slick. Little is good, you will know that after your first application. I would say this is as good as Jojoba oil if not better, for dry skin. Best to apply right after the shower, put it on your fingers/palms and brush it on your hair or skin. Keeps the skin smooth and hair feeling smooth.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not sure about hair regrowth that I keep reading on websites, i think that might be a tad far fetched.</li>
    <li> My hair was dry and rough; in addition, my hair was thinning out at the temples.  This product improved the conditions of my hair, and my temples seems to look better.  I was worried about putting  products on because of chemicals, but since it was organic I wanted to try it.  Worth the original price!</li>
    <li> This oil has done wonders for my shoulder length Dreadlocs!!! I highly recommend this oil for dry scalp &amp; the length of the locs.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m completely disappointed with this one. It is of no use at all. I suspect the high reviews were given are fake. I don&#x27;t feel neither glossy nor bright by using this regularly. The blackheads and pores aren&#x27;t disappeared. The only positiveness about this oil is, you don&#x27;t get any side effects.</li>
    <li> Excellent argan oil, great for a face treatment, miraculously clears acne and gives skin a supple glow. I use it everyday as a face moisturizer, very pleased!</li>
    <li> Just as good as the more expensive Argan Oils and is wonderful for everything that needs to be moisturized!</li>
    <li> I noticed over the past 5 years that my hair had started becoming thin and brittle, and my face dry and dull. I ordered this product after doing extensive research to discover a way to rejuvenate my hair and skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just a few drops goes a long way. I smooth the oil onto my hair and face after I shower. I have oily skin and hair, so I was worried about adding oil to oil, but I found that my face was in fact less oily after application. My once-dull hair is now silky and smooth, and I seem to have an easier time growing it out without suffering the dreaded frizz and split ends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is my second bottle of Argan oil this year. The first bottle was smaller so I could try it out before fully committing (it seemed a bit pricey at first), but a little goes a long way and I am so happy with the results that I can see myself using this for years to come.</li>
    <li> The only reason I am giving this review a 4/5 is because it leaked during the two trips I took. The bottle was sealed and capped.  Otherwise the product is amazing. I use it for my hair and skin almost everyday. It keeps it moisturized and feeling clean. It is thicker than the other oils I have tried, but it seems to do the trick. I would highly recommend this, and the price is almost unbeatable.  I have oily skin and saw a reduced number of breakouts.</li>
    <li> ordered for wife she likes it so much for monthly subscription</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product. I use it as a facial moisturizer and hair moisturizer and it works great. Smells good, good quality, and a lot of oil for the price. Definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> I Love this product!  I have tried several different brands and this one is by far the best. I was a bit skeptical at first using Argan oil because I have acne prone skin and putting oil on my face was not ideal for already oily skin. I have had no breakouts and feel as if it has actually helped my skin look younger, clearer and hydrated. I would definitely give this product a try as it will be part of my skin products for life.</li>
    <li> Love so much this Argan oil.....like liquid gold. I used it 2-3 times a day on my face. My skin is always glowing!I have already given a few bottles as gifts. I use it on my body and even my hair. It works like magic. ...my little beauty secret!</li>
    <li> I purchased this product after my wife&#x27;s suggestion to help treat a dry skin issue on my face. After using a organic facial cleanser and applying the Pura d&#x27;or for 2 weeks I have noticed a major improvement on my face. The redness is dissipating, and the irritation is almost all gone. The price is very good compared to other Argan oils, and I am going to purchase Pura D’or Argan Oil Premium Organic Shampoo Scalp &amp; Dandruff Treatment next. My only minor issue was the bottle itself, there is not a good indicator on the top of the spray nozzle for where the outlet will be so it takes a little while to get used to where the spray comes out. I will purchase this product again.</li>
    <li> Genuine product. Works great on my hair, doesnt leave it feeling greasy and weighed down or oily. I&#x27;ve definitely seen an improvement in my hair! A little goes a long way, even with thick hair like mine, and there&#x27;s only a very very faint nutty smell, so it doesnt bother you or anyone near you</li>
    <li> I love this oil!  I used the Josie Maran one in the past but it was so much more expensive - pura d&#x27;or is a much better value and it works just as well, if not better.  I look forward to using this for the next few months and am so grateful that I found a new skin care moisturizer that I&#x27;m sure will continue to fulfill my needs, exceed my expectations, &amp; inspire many recommendations!  Thank you!</li>
    <li> As the name says, it is pure gold. I have had brittle nails and rough hair recently and just after 2 applications of it, I see the softness in my hair and nails look stronger. I tried applying on my face, but just used once so can&#x27;t say if the glow is because of this or the serum+cream ( same brand) I am using. All in all, i have developed trust in the brand and will highly recommend to others who are looking for organic products.</li>
    <li> i use it on my hair ends and waiting to see the improvement</li>
    <li> Fantastic price for a 4oz bottle. I was looking for a substitute for Josie Maran&#x27;s Argan oil, which is much too expensive.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s fantastic for a nighttime moisturizer, and my acne (I have combination skin) has definitely gotten better. When I&#x27;m tired, I put some of the oil under and around my eyes to prevent bags and lines. I also tend to put some on my lips, but then cover that with chapstick in order to seal the oil in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one downside is not with the oil itself, but the packaging. I don&#x27;t mind the simple labels at all, but I&#x27;m not a big fan of the pump, which tends to dispense more than I need. With argan oil, a little goes a long way. I prefer Josie Maran&#x27;s dropper, but I also know argan oil can go bad if exposed to oxygen too much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, great product for a great price. Would definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> I bought 3 of this oil for present. And everybody who got this oil from me really likes it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for a couple of weeks now. I have sensitive, oily and dry skin. A real mess. Since using this product it has not caused break outs and my skin is soft and smooth. If I skip a day my skin feels dry again. I also had a little redness near my cheeks and I noticed it is not as red anymore. It&#x27;s still a little red, but not to the degree it was. Blends in nicely. I had been using coconut oil but stopped because I heard it can cause acne, it also did not help with the redness around my cheeks. I still use the coconut oil for the rest of my body as this is a small bottle. A little goes a long way, I really like the pump too. I had a problem keeping my coconut oil bacteria free, no problem with the argon oil due to the pump. I will update if I experience any changes positive or negative. Thus far I recommend it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this stuff for the past year. It&#x27;s great! My skin has shown great signs of improvement</li>
    <li> Great Product, the best Argan Oil from all products I used, including very respected brands.</li>
    <li> Works GREAT for dry skin!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> not greasy, skin feels soft, to early to tell if cures dry skin,nice packaging</li>
    <li> Another excellent  Pura d&#x27;or product!&lt;br /&gt;My skin feels so good. And my hair is soft and shiny.</li>
    <li> Very Nice on the skin</li>
    <li> This is the second time I&#x27;ve ordered this product and my husband loves it as much as I do. I use it on my hair &amp; face as well as my kids,(they have extremely dry skin in the colder months), and my husband on his facial hair/beard. Couldn&#x27;t ask for a better natural remedy for dry skin/ hair, that&#x27;s also gentle on sensitive skin. It&#x27;s a fix all for the whole family, that fits the saying &amp;#34;A little bit, goes a LONG way.!!&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. Goes on so nicely. Not greasy, and my mature skin feels very soft afterward. I am getting a bottle for my 20 year old daughter who loves it as well. She&#x27;s got slightly oily skin but has been trying mine, just one pump, and has not broken out. So far I have only used on face but now plan to add a few drops to hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also like that it&#x27;s natural and healthy.</li>
    <li> Ever since about two months before I came home from Iraq about 7 years ago I started having patches of psoriasis on my hands, arms, and legs. I’ve pretty much always had dry skin, but never before had I experienced an actual skin condition such as psoriasis. A couple years later, an Army doctor explained to me that while I most likely had a genetic predisposition toward psoriasis, the actual outbreaks were probably stimulated by some encounter with an allergen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the last several years I have used every imaginable hand lotion, cortisone ointment, and pills to try to tame my psoriasis. While stationed in Korea, the condition of my hands become so bad that I wore bandaids non-stop because my skin was always cracking and often would start bleeding. The last couple years have been more moderate, but most nights I still sleep with gloves just to keep my hands from cracking open.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I’m not even sure how I stumbled across argan oil, but I saw pretty rave reviews for it and figure, “what the heck!” I’ve only used the Pura D’or Organic Argan Oil for a few days, but I must say I’m very impressed. I would love to make the bold claim that my psoriasis is magically gone, but it’s not; however, the patches are significantly better than before and the maddening itch has TREMENDOUSLY subsided. I haven’t even felt a need to use my prescription cortisone ointments for the past several nights, and I’ve enjoyed a few good nights of rest without gloves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I tried a little rub in my crazy, uncontrollable mop of curly hair and it is a bit less frizzy than normal. Makes my hair and newly grown beard feel soft, which is always a good thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Whether you just want a good, natural, non-greasy way to soften and reduce the dryness of your skin, or if you have painful psoriasis or eczema, give this a shot. It’s a good price and I’m definitely glad I stumbled across it.</li>
    <li> My skin was dry and flaky, and after trying a variety of other products I can honestly say this has been the best one yet! My skin feels and looks soft and revived, my skin hasn&#x27;t looked this good since I was a teenager. Love it and would purchase again. I highly recommend this to anyone who has dry skin and is looking for a solution, THIS IS IT!</li>
    <li> Great product, packaging and information. Very satisfied</li>
    <li> I used to have dandruff during winter months. I have been applying this since past few weeks and now I do not have any dandruff.&lt;br /&gt;My hair also looks healthier and softer. I will be buying this product again.</li>
    <li> It made my skin so smooth and healthy. I use it everyday to help my skin better.</li>
    <li> I have normal skin with a few dry patches and this product is heaven.  I use it on my face and it never breaks out, makes it glow, not shine...skin just sucks it up!  Even under makeup, it makes my foundation glide nicely and evenly.  Now that winter is here (I live in Western NY) I use it everywhere, it does not smell and leaves your skin, nails and hair looking healthy.  There are other brands out there for an insane amount of money, and they are not 100% pure/organic, so beware.  This one is a keeper for me. Liza</li>
    <li> Just seems like baby oil. I like Emu Oil a lot better. Save a lot of money and pick up some baby oil from the grocery store... it even seems better than this.</li>
    <li> I bought this oil a few months back and have been using it daily on a surgery scar. It is a light oil with little scent  (I&#x27;m very sensitive to smell!) and it has already diminished my scar! I plan to continue using it in hopes of making my scar disappear. I also use it on my face some and on my elbows and hands. Love it! HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!</li>
    <li> IT IS VERY FAR FROM PURE ARGAN OIL!! I leaved in Morocco for a few years, I know very well how PURE argan oil looks and smells. Whatever in this bottle didnt even look like any oil, its diluted so much. Be honest and please put in your description what else is inside of this diluted substance. I only give you 1star for prompt delivery.</li>
    <li> I have very dry &amp; mixed skin that does not like oily creams. I need very moisturizing hydrating creams, any dry skin cream gives me spots and normal creams leave my skin dry but just hydrating does not give enough nourishment. I find it hard to find the wright product. Well I have finally found a great natural combination that works great and is very economic too. I use Vitamin A Wrinkle Treatment Moisturizing Gel by Derma E 8oz at $10( on Amazon a bottle last me 6 months) mixed with this Organic Argan Oil. I use 1 spay of the oil with a peanut amount of the Gel in my hand and mix to put on face morning and night with the occasional 2 sprays of oil at night for an extra dose and my skin feels great and I love it. I cant compare to other oil as I have not used any but I like this one I feel it is good quality. A bottle last over a year so for the price especially now as it is cheaper on Amazon it is well worth its value I think. I would recommend. The spay top does leak a very little bit but I still prefer to having to unscrew a dropper top and do all that.</li>
    <li> My hair was terribly brittle from years of coloring. I started putting argan oil on my hair after each washing and the results are wonderful. Apply sparingly to avoid looking oily by mid-day. The smell isn&#x27;t as nice as some of the other brands of argan but it works great.</li>
    <li> Because it  work great&lt;br /&gt;If it work I will like it&lt;br /&gt;I will recommend to my friends and my family</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve heard great reviews about Argan Oil so thought I&#x27;d try this one out.  It really has help my dry &amp; frizzy hair.  I also mix a little of it into my moisturizer and it works great to keep my skin moisturized &amp; dewy.  I would buy this product again.  This brand is a little more expensive, so perhaps I&#x27;ll try other brands to see.</li>
    <li> Tried it on hair, body and face. I think it&#x27;s best on my hair. Applying right after a shower results in shiny hair that lasts for a whole day!</li>
    <li> I originally purchased the Pura D&#x27;or Argan Oil as a Groupon deal and was upset when it never arrived. I got a refund from Groupon and turned to Amazon.After ordering, I received it in 2 days (I LOVE Amazon). I&#x27;ve been using it for over 3 months now and I still have more than half a bottle left. You don&#x27;t need much. I use it as a makeup primer. You would think oil wouldn&#x27;t be a good primer, but it actually works really well for me, my foundation seems to go on smoother. I also use it for my hair and it&#x27;s nice and light, not greasy at all. And I like to rub it on my nails...I don&#x27;t know how, but it makes them seem healthier. I&#x27;ll definitely be buying another one when my first runs out.</li>
    <li> I have really sensitive skin and was worried this product would make me break out.  But it didn&#x27;t!  Provided a nice glow to my skin as well.  An added bonus is that it is affordable, especially compared to other argan oil brands I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
    <li> This oil is great Super light, and just a little bit makes my skin super smooth. Also works wonders on hair. 5 Stars. Highly recommend. Worth every dollar.</li>
    <li> I have used a flat iron to straighten my frizzy wavy hair for the past 10 years. 450 degrees 4 days per week &#x3D; extremely dry and damaged hair.&lt;br /&gt;Pura D&#x27; Argan Oil made my once dry and brittle hair smooth and silky once again.</li>
    <li> I have used several different brands of argan oil, including Josie Maran and this one.  I liked the Josie Maran best, but it is really expensive.  Based on reviews here, I tried this one and I really like it.  I use it as a moisturizer for my face and it really makes my skin glow.  Overall, this is a great product for the price.</li>
    <li> After using this product for several weeks, I really didn&#x27;t see any big difference in my skin.  Could only use it at bedtime or when I wasn&#x27;t planning on using foundation because it has an oily feel and doesn&#x27;t totally absorb.  Was expecting more after all the advertisement of spectacular results.  Thought it was just ok as a moisturizer.  I wonder if other brands have better results but shouldn&#x27;t all argan oil&#x27;s be basically the same?  Not sure.  Won&#x27;t buy again.</li>
    <li> My girlfriend uses this stuff and I tried it a couple of times on my scalp for my dandruff and it&#x27;s pretty good.&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t turn my head into a grease ball, which I really appreciate.&lt;br /&gt;My girlfriend uses it for her face and body moisturizer, the smell isn&#x27;t revolting. It&#x27;s good stuff, I recommend it.</li>
    <li> This really works...my hair is usually really frizzy and after using the oil, it made my hair less frizzy and smooth. I tried almost every product to help tame my hair but the argan oil works best</li>
    <li> Great stuff. I use it all over and don&#x27;t have to worry about any added chemicals. Skin, face, cuticles. What&#x27;s left on fingers I can run through my hair for extra shine.</li>
    <li> An absolutely wonderful product.  This product will help your hair silky and shy, The oil does not weigh down my hair and feel very soft.  If you use it for the face, your face wrinkle will also be reduced.  In short, this is amazing oil for both hair and skin.</li>
    <li> After using this for several days, I must admit that I am VERY pleased with this. It has a nutty kind of smell, and a tiny bit goes a VERY long way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I was originally contacted by Pura D&#x27;or, I asked a lot of questions before I agreed to test this for review. I am not a huge fan of anything that is environmentally a problem, or that manipulates and uses people. It was only after checking this out that I agreed to try a sample and give my own honest opinion about it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, I discovered that Argan Oil comes from nuts grown from the Argan tree in Morocco. The tree is endangered, but rather than diminishing the trees, the sale of the oil has promoted growth of additional trees, and Morocco has set aside preserves to protect this national treasure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second, I discovered that some of the processing of this oil must be done manually. Morocco has established women&#x27;s cooperatives to process the oil, who are paid directly. As a result, the processing of the oil has benefited women and the economy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since I could stand behind it (if it worked), I allowed Pura d&#x27;or to send me a complimentary sample for my personal use and testing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Meeting my personal standards doesn&#x27;t matter, if it doesn&#x27;t work. After reading through the reviews, I did try it. I placed two drops on my hand, and rubbed it in, then gently placed it around my eyes, massaging it in. Unlike some creams, this oil didn&#x27;t strictly disappear, rather it stayed to work its wonders. It felt moistened rather than oily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have purchased expensive creams before, and after a short period of time they don&#x27;t seem to be effective. In this case, even several hours later my eye area still felt soft and moist. I don&#x27;t have a lot of lines, but the ones I had appeared smaller, even from the start. After several days, my eyes look younger. I have also used this on my legs for winter dry skin, and while it took more, it did effectively moisten my legs as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since Argan oil is also used as a cooking oil (food grade), I also took a brief taste of this. There was the tiniest nut taste. This isn&#x27;t food grade, so I don&#x27;t recommend cooking with it, but we reviewers are notoriously curious (and picky) about any products that end up in our hands, particularly if we are asked to consider them for review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am continuing to explore ways to use this oil, besides the all-important eyes, and my legs, and as far as I am concerned, this is the oil that has helped my wrinkles better than any other./&gt;Since Argan oil is also used as a cooking oil (food grade), I also took a brief taste of this.

    <li> This is the best dry skin treatment I have ever tried. It absorbs quickly, unlike other oils I have tried. It lasts longer and makes my sensitive fair dry skin so comfortable. I use on my face and my skin looks beautiful and not greasy. I will never live without this product again. I have not compared other argan oils, but did my research and this seamed to be highly rated and much less expensive than other popular brands. and it is 100% argan oil, unlike many others. This stuff is magic!!</li>
    <li> This is an organic, cold-pressed oil from the kernel from the seed of the fruit of the argan tree. It is almost colorless, with a faint, slightly sweet and natural scent, definitely nutty but unique, with just a hint of earthy spiciness similar to nutmeg or mace. It comes in an amber glass bottle with a pump that neatly dispenses a large drop.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This argan oil will improve the appearance of dry skin and cuticles in just a few days.  It doesn&#x27;t feel at all greasy or oily after massaging it into the skin but simply leaves it smooth and moist. After applying it at night, the skin is still moist in the morning rather than dry.  It can also be used sparingly on the hair and scalp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried many different brands of argan oil, and this one is very high-quality, pure and fresh, and a pleasure to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pura d&#x27;or provided argan oil for evaluation and review.</li>
    <li> Smooths skin and leaves it feeling healthy.  Dispenser makes it easy to use small amounts at a time.</li>
    <li> I had a facial recently and was told my skin was very dry. She recommended Argan Oil.  I bought this brand after reading many reviews. I find reviews very helpful.  This is my first time using Argan Oil. I&#x27;m happy with the results so far. The gas heat this winter has been drying my face and I am seeing results. It&#x27;s not real heavy and feels good on my skin.  I guess the real test will be when I go for another facial.</li>
    <li> Incredible value. This is a good quantity of a high quality product for a fraction of the cost of the Josie Maran argan oil. There is a light fragrance that may put some people off, but I find it pleasant. This oil absorbs into the skin almost immediately which is almost a shame because it feels so good rubbing it in! I could spend all day rubbing this oil into my hands, nails, cuticles, face, feet. Amazing product, amazing price. Do yourself a favor and get a bottle of this.</li>
    <li> This product is the real deal! Soften and moisturizes without being greasy. Use it all over, even on your hair. I absolutely love it - use it every day!</li>
    <li> It is very smooth, looking good on my face, clean, not greasy. My skin looks glowing after using it. Definately very good thing for facial and body!</li>
    <li> It really is an amazing product!! I have been using it for a week and my hair looks gorgeous!!! I&#x27;ll never buy again expensive products when you can just use a natural one that can heal damaged hair. I recommend this product!!</li>
    <li> Really like this argan oil, the smell is very nice but subtle, which makes me believe it is pure and/or good quality.  I bought it mainly for my hair (I have thin hair with damaged end) and the main thing I was looking for is moisture without adding greasiness to my hair.  It has fulfilled my expectations, I use very little on my hair ends every night and I can still go a few days without washing my hair but not being overly greasy.  The night before I wash my hair, I put a whole bunch of the argan oil and sleep with it as a hair mask.  It has been great so far in helping me grow my fine hair and keep it healthy.</li>
    <li> I purchased this as an all around moisturizer.  I am very pleased with the difference it has made in my cuticles and nails.  I am also using argan oil as a overnight hair conditioner.  I feel great about finding an organic product that is so pure and free from additives and chemicals.  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I never ever right reviews about products or places or anything because different things work for different people but I&#x27;m so satisfied and happy with this product it deserves all the recognition it can get! I originally bought this product for my hair but ended up using it for my face too, my hair is over processed, has been bleached, it&#x27;s very dry, thin, and damaged Ive tried absolutely everything and anything from coconut oil to hair finity vitamins to that horse shampoo people use and saw 0 results. I used this for every other day in combination with the coconut oil and my hair became visibly thicker in only 3 weeks, it also grew a whole inch in just ONE month. This product is amazing!! I&#x27;m in love and %100 recommend it to anyone and everyone who wants a healthy head of hair even to those who are balding or there hair is falling out this product is for YOU. I love you Mother Nature!!!</li>
    <li> Pura d&#x27;or 100% Pure &amp; USDA Organic Argan Oil (4 fl. oz.)&lt;br /&gt;Best product! Great quality! Amazing price!&lt;br /&gt;I have curly frizzy hair and this calms my hair down all day.</li>
    <li> Pura d&#x27;or Argan oil is one of the best ones I&#x27;ve used. I&#x27;ve used more expensive and the results were not any better. I love it and will continue to purchase. This oil is great for my nails and I use it to condition my thick hair. I also mix it with other oils to use after my shower.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend .</li>
    <li> When the label says use a &#x27;pea size&#x27; amount, follow it. Use more than that and your hair will look like you just took a shower and your hair never dried</li>
    <li> I have been using this argon oil for a while now and I just love it.  Love that it is organic and makes me feel good about using it even more.  It makes my skin really soft and moisturizes my skin very well. I noticed that it helps lengthening my eyelashes and they are much fuller now because of this argon oil!  I make sure to use little extra for my eyelashes and eyebrows.  I can&#x27;t recommend it enough!</li>
    <li> I have been using Pura d&#x27;or Argan oil for over 2 weeks now and I like it. I was losing too much hair before and after reading other reviews I decided to order this product. I see some difference - my hair feels soft and shiny. I think I am losing less hair now but I need to use this product for more time to see a considerable difference. I use this oil on my face, body and I can say my skin feels softer and nicer every morning. I hope Pura d&#x27;or will keep up to my expectations and my hair will be more healthy and beautiful.</li>
    <li> This product is outstanding and a great value.  After using another name brand, highly priced product for over a year, I found this one on Amazon. Although I hesitated, as I have extremely sensitive skin, the praises I could sing about Purad&#x27;or are immeasurable!  First and foremost, I use it primarily on my face twice daily, and there are no sensitivity issues whatsoever. There&#x27;s no unpleasant scent, as in another brand I tried, there is simply a faint scent of menthol (to me) and I say this haltingly, as most would not even notice.  The scent disappears almost immediately upon use.  It feels like silk going on and leaves my skin soft and supple all day long, without oiliness. My husband who is comfortable with few facial products,  uses it as well, because it feels so good. I highly recommend this product, especially to those, like myself, with very sensitive skin.  Just a terrific product for the price!</li>
    <li> Bought it for a Christmas present for a loved one, She loved it and would buy more</li>
    <li> i just started using it and will find out the result in a month or so</li>
    <li> I love this Argan oil!  I  had bumps on my face and now they are going away, it is also reduces red spots and softens my skin.</li>
    <li> This is my second bottle of this product.  I use it on my face daily and my friends are always asking what I use.  I would highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> doesn&#x27;t see to make any difference of my hair or skin. Greasy, hard to get into the skin.</li>
    <li> Absolutely recommend this product. I have very dry skin and this product has been awesome on my skin. I use it before I shower all over and my skin does not have the stretchy dry feeling afterwards. It also leaves my hair silky soft. 5 stars.</li>
    <li> Love this product!  I have extremely dry skin and this helped with my worst problem areas! I was looking for an alternative to the thick cremes, such as Eucerin, and this worked really well.</li>
    <li> This product is one of the best kept secrets. I use it mostly on my face as a skin treatment. I believe it to rejuvenate the skin by giving it more elasticity.</li>
    <li> Great product.  I use it a lot on my hair.</li>
    <li> Sorry, I wrote a review earlier for the shampoo and met to write a review for this product. I love how it moisturizes my face and lips. I will continue to use your product and thank you for offering a second bottle, Denise</li>
    <li> First try to use oil product, feel good, this oil is absorbed into my skin very quickly. I tried to use it on my daughter&#x27;s itchy hand because of Eczema, it does help. Will keep using it.</li>
    <li> I prefer other argan oils to this product.  It&#x27;s not terrible but it doesn&#x27;t feel like as good of quality of others.  Also, be aware that after purchase, they ask you for a review and in exchange they will send you another bottle for free.  I think this would account for some of the inflated 5 star reviews.    I just it four stars because it is good for the price point (considering you get a second bottle free with a review)</li>
    <li> I have damaged hair from coloring my hair. This oil helped with my hair looking healthy without being too heavy. It&#x27;s not sticky at all either.  Would continue to use it.</li>
    <li> I love it so much, this stuff keeps your skin moisturized and doesn&#x27;t make any breakouts!</li>
    <li> Love this product. For my hair and my skin, also uts the best for after a pedicure. Love it so much I bought the shampoo my hair has gotten so much thicker and stronger.</li>
    <li> A product that really works.</li>
    <li> This Product was one my best purchases till date. I have started using this for a while now, I can already feel difference in my skin. this definitely works. I would definitely recommend this product :) :)</li>
    <li> This is a great brand and has lasted me many, many months. It is truly pure, has great packaging and is high quality. I love this stuff to use on my face, hair, nails--one little pump goes a long way! I wish this brand would release a travel size because I want to take this with me.</li>
    <li> Great for dry skin.  This is an excellent grade of Argan oil!!! I have used Argan  oil for years, this is my first try this brand and I am sold on it.  Absorbs into skin very well. Where others just sit on top of skin.&lt;br /&gt;I will purchase again.</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with the product. I purchased it for my hair but I have been using it on my skin as well, it is not too heavy or over oily, but is an effective moisturizer.</li>
    <li> I have been using Argan oil for a few years now and finally decided to try another brand other than Josie Moran. This stuff works just as well for less than half the cost. Would highly recommend!</li>
    <li> Excellent argan oil. I use it all over my face and body every night, and as an overnight hair/scalp treatment about once a week. Keeps hair and skin soft naturally.</li>
    <li> Great product! I love how it makes my skin and nails feel. A must have!</li>
    <li> I LOVE argan oils and all sorts of natural oils with multi purpose benefits.  With this product i like are there is no funny smell and a little bit goes a long way.  It felt good on my hands and body but made my face a little too shiny and i did breakout after using it on my face.  In terms on hair uses. My hair looked very oily even just using one pump on the ends (which mine are very dry) so i think ive used better but i will continue using to see if over time it improves. For my hair i would use this as an overnight treatment or before the shower.</li>
    <li> This is nice.  I use on my face and put my make no problem. Some time I just use oil on my face to keep it moist. No oil face.</li>
    <li> I was looking for an all natural moisturizing oil for my acne prone skin. I can&#x27;t say enough wonderful things about this product.  I apply 2 drops with aloe Vera gel twice daily. This regiment works best for me.  No break outs.  I have very supple &amp; young looking skin. Ive used this brand of oil for 3 months now. People think I&#x27;m 15 years younger than I am.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s been almost 3 weeks since i purchased this oil and it has actually done wonders to my dull hair. i use the oil in my damp hair after my shower it leaves the hair silky and shiny. i also use few drops before shampooing.it also gives healthy look to my hair.though its quite expensive it does it work for the dollars spent.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this oil for couple of days now and it has truly made my hair very manageable, soft and shed much less so im gona keep using it for a while and see how its really gona treat my hair. I&#x27;ll come back in a mo and do a much better review and probably will give it a 5 star then.</li>
    <li> So far I have used this oil on my skin and scalp.  I am hopeful that it produces results as claimed.  The product arrived promptly, the packaging is nice and the product has a pleasant smell.  My primary purpose for purchasing this product was to use it in my hair which is color treated plus I use a hair dryer and flat iron daily.  This product only has one ingredient which I really like and it does make my hair look shiny and healthy.  I&#x27;m hopeful the long term results are as great as the short term!</li>
    <li> The oil came packaged in a nice recycled cloth bag which is nice to travel with.  The quality of the oil is agreeing with my skin.  I love the way it has transformed and softened my wrinkles so quickly.  I will be buying this product for a very long time.</li>
    <li> My wife and definitely enjoyed this product. She has extremely curly hair which gets terribly frizzy, especially in the winter up north. This made her hair more much more manageable and even smell better.</li>
    <li> Love this oil, great moisturizer</li>
    <li> My 13 year old son has suffered with eczema for many years.  We&#x27;ve tried many different remedies with only mild relief.&lt;br /&gt;We tried Pura D&#x27;or&#x27;s Argan Oil before bed and I asked him this evening if he noticed any difference and he said yes that all of the areas where he applied the oil feel better with much less irritation.  If he&#x27;s happy we&#x27;re happy!</li>
    <li> I think  the cheap organic  health food store argan oil far surpasses this brand.....it is bad....I will give the benefit of the doubt and maybe the company sent me a bottle that was old ...because this is by far a terrible brand</li>
    <li> Great product! I absolutely love this product, 100% organic oil. I used it on the winter when my skin was dried up, Now my skin is clear and smooth. I love the product,</li>
    <li> I bought this to try to sooth my hairs after seeing the rave reviews on Amazon. Since I live in SoCal where the water is hard which caused hairs to broke, I decided on getting this for my hairs. I summarized my takes on this after a few days of usage. My review is only based on my usage on my hairs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pro:&lt;br /&gt;1. it definitely helps to make the hairs more smooth when I run my fingers through.&lt;br /&gt;2. it does not smell bad like other products.&lt;br /&gt;3. the price definitely has advantage over other similar products on Sephora.&lt;br /&gt;4. it is organic&lt;br /&gt;5. it has a pump which make it very easy to use&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Con:&lt;br /&gt;1. it is little grease which leave the hairs a bit oily.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m on my second bottle and I recently bought one as a gift for a friend.  I love using it on my face under my moisturizer(my skin is REALLY DRY).  It is a great quality, arrived as expected.  Love it and I&#x27;m a fan for life!</li>
    <li> Very nice. High quality bottle and dispenser and makes skin feel so much smoother and energized absolutely love the product so far. Will be buying as long as they are making!!</li>
    <li> This Argan Oil is a great bargain! It is really a big bottle considering whats inside of it and that you only use a tiny bit each time. I use it two times a day, once at night just after my shower and in the mornings after I shave I use Aubrey Naturals Mens Moisturizer and mix in a squirt of this Argan Oil. It makes my skin looks brighter, and helps remove wrinkles. I use it on my face particular under my eyes. This particular version, 4 oz, is a bargain!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve purchased this argan oil because it is organic and simply the best. I use it on my hair and face on a daily basis. There are many other brands that sell argan oil, but they are not the same. This oil is imported from Morocco and bottled in the US. If you want the best argan oil on the market, Pura D&#x27;or is the way to go. I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Love this oil - it feels so luxurious on my skin.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product after a friend of mine recommended it to me. This product is awesome for hair and face. It makes my hair shinny and smooth. I&#x27;ve noticed that I don&#x27;t have any dandruff so that makes this product even better. I highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> I was really impressed with Pura D&#x27;or Pure Organic Argan Oil.  I felt a difference in my hair after the first time I used it.  It really makes my hair feel softer and healthier.  I have been fighting with my hair for years, it is very damaged and dried out.  This is the first product that I have used that has shown a noticable improvement.  What I also like about this product is the fact that it is all natural, organic, and has no smell.  I feel really comfortable putting this on my hair.  I would highly recommend this to any one who would like softer, healthier, shinier hair.  I know that I will be using Pura D&#x27;or products from now on, I am really impressed with the quality of their products.</li>
    <li> Great, long lasting, non greasy, unscripted treatment oil for hair, face, hand, and body! I bought 2 more after I tried it the first time last year.</li>
    <li> Unbelievable. It&#x27;s only my second day of using this products, I could see visible result on my face. My face feels smooth and &amp;#34;calm&amp;#34;. My skin has a lot of issues, sensitive, dry, redness, big pores, breakouts quite often. But I have no breakouts at all after using this. My pores getting smaller, I am still monitoring the wrinkles will get reduced, anyway it&#x27;s only my 2nd day.</li>
    <li> horrible product saw none of these results these other customers are writing above. i&#x27;ll stick with my josie argon oil.</li>
    <li> Excellent. Helped with dry skin.</li>
    <li> This stuff works great. Non-greasy, it soaks into my face overnight. In the morning I wash and tone my face again, and I can see all of the dirt, make-up and yucky stuff still left that it draws out. My face has never been cleaner, softer or healthier looking.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 53 &amp; this is THE BEST thing I&#x27;ve ever tried on my skin.  ANYWHERE on my body.  My arms, hands &amp; face tend to be the driest &amp; getting a bit wrinkly (even though I always moisturize after my shower) because I live in AZ.  I&#x27;ve used the most popular moisturizers out there &amp; although they moisten my skin for a couple of hours, later it&#x27;s as if I&#x27;ve used nothing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THIS is Pura d&#x27;or Argon Oil is DIFFERENT!  And NO....it&#x27;s not OILY.  I&#x27;m amazed at how my skin just soaks it right up &amp; leaves no oily residue, but just a youthful moist feeling until the next shower!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some tips I&#x27;d like to point out:  1) I first learned of how magical argon oil is from the very popular Josie Maran one they sell on QVC......at 3 TIMES MORE MONEY ($70 + s/h for same size)!  No need to spend that!  2) Be CAREFUL because with the popularity of argon oil now, many many products claim &amp;#34;argon oil&amp;#34;.  They are not all equal. Many products CONTAIN SOME argon oil....but most are not PURE.  3) COMPARE the labels, INGREDIENTS &amp; reviews of this to the others on the market.  THIS Pura d&#x27;or is *100% PURE (no other ingredients added) ORGANIC argon oil.  USDA certified.  4)  I was also pleasantly surprised to learn how &amp;#34;green&amp;#34; (earth-conscious) this manufacturer is.  5)  and.........THE PRICE CANT BE BEAT!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will NEVER be without this stuff!  Next time, I believe I&#x27;ll order the eye dropper style bottle in this product.  This one has a spritzer which is fine.  But then on the other hand....the spritzer might be better to use less than the drops.  A TINY bit goes a LONG way.......4 oz. will last a while!  I hope they keep the prices affordable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have not yet used in my hair, but intend to try that also.  It&#x27;s so luxurious feeling!</li>
    <li> I use this oil before leaving the house because it is so light and does not leave my face oily. my face is very sensitive and keep my face moisturized all day. I also put it on my hair tips at night</li>
    <li> This is my second order of this argan oil.  It works very well for face and hair.  Previously I used expensive Josie Maran argan oil, and find this works just as well for less than  1/3 the price.</li>
    <li> The pura d&#x27;or argan oil is a fantastic product at an awesome price! The oil is luxurious and the glass bottle has a hygienic pump top. A little argan oil goes a long way on both my face and hair, so pure d&#x27;or offers exceptional value. Also it is comforting to know exactly what I&#x27;m putting on my skin and not worrying about useless fillers or potentially harmful chemicals. I will definitely purchase again when this bottle runs out.</li>
    <li> IT REALLY WORKS!  This product has changed my skin! I am a 21 year old female living from NYC. From my adolescence, my face has always been flaky and dry due to the pollution and dirty city air that i have been exposed to. I also have really bad facial acne, which i tried to maintain by using cleansers and moisturizers continuously. My doctors have also prescribed me acne medication that I&#x27;ve took for a period of time. I could only see slight improvement in my facial condition. After purchasing and applying Pura d&#x27;or, argon oil after cleansing daily, I&#x27;ve begun to see significant changes in my face:  1) My face has become much smoother  2)I have a glow on my face after i wake up in the morning with argan oil  3) My acne lessened and my acne scars diminished.  I have only tried the argan on my face, im excited what it has to offer for the skin around my body and my hair.</li>
    <li> Love this product! Use it for hands, face, and hair.</li>
    <li> Have been trying to find a good argan oil to use for my bleached hair - this one doesn&#x27;t really do much. It makes my hair look greasy and doesn&#x27;t seem to improve it in any way. I&#x27;ll stick to my old brand instead.</li>
    <li> I bought together with &#x27;Pura d or&#x27; shampoo ( Blue ). Stress free to use this oil because of USDA organic certified.</li>
    <li> This is the best product l have ever used!  My hair is amazing and l put it on my skin and my face has never looked so good!  You only need very little so it lasts a long time.</li>
    <li> Great product with reasonable price.  Bottle may seem small but lasts a long time.  I originally made this purchase for my own facial skin care routine, but came to trust it to use it for my young daughters as well.  I use this product at night, about every other day as the only moisturizer, to very satisfactory result.  For my kids I use it as a hair enrichment to help detangle and prevent split ends of their very long locks.  The oil help keep their hair shiny, smooth, but not greasy.</li>
    <li> Unbelieveable results with just using this product two times.  My husband has had dry patches on his face that we tried using all kinds of creams, oils, and lotions - all without results.  After using Pura d&#x27;or Argan twice they have improved drastically.  I used it for extremely dry, peeling heels and after just two treatments they are 80% better. I thought it would take at least a week for these kind of results, but I&#x27;m very happy with the quick results.  I&#x27;m definitely sold on this product.</li>
    <li> this has lasted me forever and I have let it take the place of my night eye moisturizer and sometimes my facial moisturizer. It has actually helped with fine lines. I was genuinely surprised b/c this is so much less expensive than products on the market. It doesn&#x27;t have an odor and isn&#x27;t greasy. My skin has been breaking out from my previous moisturizer because of oils but this doesn&#x27;t affect my skin in a negative way. I&#x27;m happy. (I have acne prone skin that is dry in the winter especially around my eyes)</li>
    <li> Pure oil that softens my hair, my skin, my hands and at such a reasonable price.  This replaced more expensive hair conditioners, face creams, hand creams at a fraction of their cost.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love the product.  It soaks right in to my skin and does not leave a trace of the oil.  It reduces the appearance of the fine lines around my eyes.  Leaves my skin very soft.  I plan on using this product the rest of my life. I also like the fact that it is USDA approved.  Love it, Love it.......</li>
    <li> Product exceeded my expectations and I would recommend this item to all my family and friends! Great quality for the price! Cant go wrong with this purchase!</li>
    <li> The oil is extremely well packaged and nice. Ive only used it once so far and it is great on my skin. Not as thick as I expected but still does the job.</li>
    <li> I give this product 5 stars because it has softened wrinkles on my face. It absorbs to the skin fabulously without leaving an oily residue. This product also works amazing for my frizzy hair.</li>
    <li> Working wonders on my face in just 24 hours! Hair is feeling light and looking shiny!</li>
    <li> Maybe I got a bad batch but mine is greasy and just weighs my hair down.</li>
    <li> I originally bought this product to use on my hair, to be honest I&#x27;ve use it once on my hair and it felt great, really manageable, soft and full of life.  I have been using this product more on my face every night, i notice a change on the tone of my skin a nice glow and an even tone.  I also use it on my underarms and notice a changes well.  One week and I&#x27;m totally in love with this product.</li>
    <li> Great for my face at night. I love this stuff and it lasts forever</li>
    <li> I have only been using this product for a week, but I can already see the difference in my hair. I put a small amount on my hair before bed, leave it in overnight, and shampoo in the morning. My hair is much softer, silkier, and looks much healthier. I have also been using it on my hands and nails, and the dry skin around my cuticles has disappeared. I am interested to see the effects of long-term use of Pura d&#x27;or Argan Oil!</li>
    <li> It really works and improves my hair situation. High recommend. :)</li>
    <li> Love this one. My skin was so dry before since I use this my skin look more healthy.</li>
    <li> I originally purchased this argan oil as hair moisturizer, and found out that it can also benefit skin and nail. After two weeks of using pura dor argan oil, I am pleased that it does a great job to maintain natural shine of my hair (I always have really healthy hair), and more importantly, keep my hair better moisturized. And now I also use it for my hands and nails. Happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> This product does everything that it says it will do. It definitely has met my expectations. I will continue to use it. Thank you</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m prone to really dry skin which gets even more difficult to manage in the winter time. The best thing I have found is just to use petroleum jelly, however that leaves your skin very sticky and unpleasant. I&#x27;ve tried using mineral oil as well but that is too light for me. So when I was approached to try this, I was enthusiastic to accept. This Argan oil seems like the perfect fit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottle is somewhat small and due to the price, I&#x27;m hesitant to use it all over my body. The good part is you need very little to get the job done. One squirt gives you about a pea-sized amount and that is more than enough for hands and even forearms. There is a light, pleasant scent that is natural, and the oil works quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The instructions say you can use it in your hair, which I did, but the result wasn&#x27;t what I hoped. It made my hair look greasy - as if I hadn&#x27;t washed in several days - instead of shiny and smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still, I use it everyday for my hands and love it so far.</li>
    <li> I will be the first to admit I usually do not spend a lot of money on personal skin care and hair products. If I do need to purchase something special, such as a facial moisturizer or deep conditioner for my hair, I generally peruse my coupon stash and then try and find something competitively priced that I have a coupon for. In the absence of a coupon I will find a comparable store brand product and take my purchase home to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thus, being given the opportunity to try Pura d&#x27;Or Argan Oil is a bit of a luxury for me. I am the girl who wears no makeup; the depth of my skincare routine is applying Oil of Olay to my face and Eucerin to my dry, cracked skin only when I feel it is needed. Using a beauty product (especially one that is an oil treatment) that costs more than $10 is \\&quot;high class\\&quot;, and after using this product for nearly 2 full weeks I can say with 100% honesty that you do get what you pay for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Packaging&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pura d&#x27;Or Argan Oil (shipped to you within a bubble envelope inside of a sturdy box) is packaged within a glass bottle with a plastic dispenser tip and a cover to placed over the top when finished. In this instance I tried the 4 fl. oz. (118 mL) bottle. Due to the aforementioned careful packaging, there was no damage to the bottle. Oh, and I forgot to mention that the bottle arrives inside of a small, linen drawstring bag. Personally, having to pull the bottle out of a bag each time that I wish to use the product was a bit annoying so I repurposed the bag for some other knick-knacks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottle itself is brown glass and feels durable. The shiny gold label on the bottle clearly indicates the product name, uses, and prominently indicates that the product is USDA organic and cruelty free. The plastic dispenser will give you exactly a pea-sized droplet of the argan oil when you depress it. Since the directions for use on the side of the package indicates that you simply need a pea-sized amount, the dispenser is ingenious and also minimizes the possibility of you using too much. I found this aspect to be very nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Uses&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pura d&#x27;Or Argan Oil reminds me somewhat of WD-40. No, I do not recommend using it to grease the hinges on your doors; what I mean is there are a lot of uses for this product other than the obvious as a skin moisturizer. The label indicates that it can be used as a \\&quot;daily moisturizer, morning &amp; nighttime treatment, and to heal, protect &amp; condition everything from head to toe\\&quot;. I should note that I did not use it to cover my entire body, rather, I used it for a few specific issues that I believe a lot of people experience. These issues are below:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Split Ends: I have rather long, thick hair. The extent of my haircare is to brush it back while it is still wet and put it into a ponytail or a loose braid. I sometimes use a deep conditioner but by and large I generally just shampoo my hair. I rarely use blow dryer or put a lot of products in my hair. Hair spray is something that I only use if I am going out. This means that I do not have a lot of damage to my hair, however; I do get a fairly good amount of split ends. Using the oil, I massaged three pea-sized droplets into the end of my hair each night before I went to bed. After about a week of nightly use my split ends seem to be much healthier and I did not notice any further damage to the ends of my hair. This is a definite thumbs-up for this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Severely Dry Skin: due to the winter time my skin dries out fairly often. The dry heat from the furnace will result in patches that are almost scaly and can be downright painful. Before I received this oil to try I used Eucerin Intense Repair Ointment; while the ointment helped, it seemed like I had to apply it several times a day -and the dry skin always came back. For the argan oil, I used it on a particularly rough spot on my elbow; this is one of the many spots I tried to heal with the Eucerin beforehand. I rubbed in a pea-sized amount of the oil two times a day; within three days my elbow was completely healed. In fact, I have not had a recurrence of that particular dry skin patch since it healed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nail and Cuticle: again due to the dry heat associated with winter (forced air heating through a furnace), the skin around my fingernails and the cuticles themselves sometimes crack and even bleed. I used Pura d&#x27;Or Argan Oil on all 10 fingers, again with applications twice daily. While it didn&#x27;t heal any wounds, I did notice that my fingernails were healthier and the skin around them had fewer cracks. In addition I was able to push my cuticles back easier. Pura d&#x27;Or Argan Oil did not exacerbate any cuts and/or scrapes near my fingernails, nor did it sting if it came into contact with them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product impression&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Being organic, there are neither chemical preservatives nor additives. I will admit that I was a bit hesitant to use it at first as I was afraid there may be an unpleasant odor as there were no perfumes. Happily, I could not detect any scent at all; as a result I was comfortable using it on both my face and neck. Another bonus is that I had no reaction to the oil. I have sensitive skin and in the past have had some lotions and creams cause small rashes. Since Pura d&#x27;Or Argan Oil is organic, the lack of chemical additives reduces the likelihood of an uncomfortable skin condition.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The oil itself is rather thin; it has the texture of corn oil (meaning it is relatively light) and a pale amber color. The big question, of course, is whether Pura d&#x27;Or Argan Oil leaves a greasy residue. I can say with confidence that it does not - if the directions are followed! The only greasiness that I felt was during the first 30 seconds after application while it was being absorbed into my skin and/or hair. After that there was no residue and I was able to open doors and perform other tasks without leaving behind any trace that I applied Pura d&#x27;Or Argan Oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, if you manage to dribble any Pura d&#x27;Or Argan Oil onto your clothing it could leave a grease stain. I was able to use a dry paper towel to blot out any that I did get onto my clothing and subsequently washed it with no lasting harm. I should note that most of my clothing is cotton; I cannot attest to any stains or grease spots that could be left on other fabrics. That being said I do recommend exercising caution so that you do not drip any oil onto your clothing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While the price of Pura d&#x27;Or Argan Oil may intimidate some, as I mentioned earlier, you do get what you pay for. You only need a small amount to get the amazing results that I did so your investment will pay off in spades. Between moisturizing my skin, conditioning my hair, and rejuvenating my fingernails and cuticles, Pura d&#x27;Or Argan Oil is an amazing product that I wish I had tried sooner. The fact that it is also organic and not tested on animals is a definite plus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In short, if you would like a product that will heal your dry skin and also do other amazing things, Pura d&#x27;Or Argan Oil should be part of your beauty routine. You will find (as I did)that this oil will replace several other beauty products that you have; so while the cost may seem high at first, you will no longer need to spend money on lotion, conditioner, or other ointments. Heck, you may even save money by purchasing this product since you will no longer need to spend it on other items. I give Pura d&#x27;Or Argan Oil a hearty thumbs up!ized amount of the oil two times a day; within three days my elbow was completely healed. In fact, I have not had a recurrence of that particular dry skin patch since it healed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nail and Cuticle: again due to the dry heat associated with winter (forced air heating through a furnace), the skin around my fingernails and the cuticles themselves sometimes crack and even bleed. I used Pura d&#x27;Or Argan Oil on all 10 fingers, again with applications twice daily. While it didn&#x27;t heal any wounds, I did notice that my fingernails were healthier and the skin around them had fewer cracks. In addition I was able to push my cuticles back easier. Pura d&#x27;Or Argan Oil did not exacerbate any cuts and/or scrapes near my fingernails, nor did it sting if it came into contact with them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product impression&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Being organic, there are neither chemical preservatives nor additives.

    <li> Sorry.  I thought 100% would make the difference.  I&#x27;m writing this review just in case someone thinks their hair will look like silk.  It looks heavy and greasy even with a tiny amount.</li>
    <li> This is an oil for the skin and nothing else is near as good. It improves the quality (smoothness, freshness amd moisture) of your face!  I mention and will recommend this produce to everyone.</li>
    <li> I have been using this oil for about 6 months now.  I bought it to use in my hair, but felt like it made my hair smell funny.  (Having said that, I have been using Monoi oil for over 10 years so I am used to a much nicer smelling oil.)  While the argan oil did soak into my hair nicely, it was not enough for my thick, wavy hair.  I feel that the monoi works better for me.  BUT - I had also been using it on my face/neck/décolletage and I have been very happy with it.  The oil is light and absorbs quickly into the skin.  The results are properly moisturized skin without breakouts or a greasy looking face.  I use an eye cream as well each night, but that&#x27;s all that I use on my face.  I will continue to purchase as it works so well for me.</li>
    <li> I have extraordinarily ashy skin lately. I also have quite a few tattoos. So this product does double duty for me. I use it all over as a moisturiser and then I also use it to keep my tattoos supple and vibrant. It is not a miracle oil for me, but it does go on nice and evenly and absorbs readily. It helps to make my skin look radiant for a while and makes the color in my ink pop. Plus it is free of all the nasties and additives that can wreak havoc with a tattoo and skin in general. It comes in a convenient size with a pump top that makes application a breeze. So all in all I think I am hooked on this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only problem I am having is, as soon as I put it on, one of my dogs feels the need to try and lick it all off. I worry that as much as she thinks this is a delicacy that it may not be good for her to ingest(I do my best to deter her).....plus it&#x27;s kind of defeating the purpose of putting it on.</li>
    <li> I receive this product as a gift and did not personally purchase it from Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I suffer from psoriasis and work hard to keep it under control with lotions and products that relieve the itch. This winter I have had a mind outbreak behind my ears and up into my scalp.  For three weeks I have put this on my hair and affected areas and the itch is gone and almost all the dry flaking skin is gone too. Yeah! Relief and I don&#x27;t have to be self-conscious about the flakes behind my ears (my hair is short).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have natural straight hail about 50% gray and 50% dark brown.  As the hair becomes gray, it is less soft and manageable than my natural brown hair.  I used hair coloring but because of my scalp condition, I stopped and now all the old color has been cut off.  My hair was extremely difficult to style until I used Pura D&#x27;or on it; now I just comb it into my hair after I wash it and the style it the way I want and it stays.  This is the best my hair has looked since the gray started more years ago than I want to mention.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very happy with this product as I use it on my dry skin and psoriasis areas and to style my hair. I am also happy that I no long have dry areas around my nails with red splits in the skin as I have also been using Pura D&#x27;or on my cuticles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For me it delivered more than it advertises in the description and I highly recommend it to anyone with dry skin conditions.</li>
    <li> Pura D&#x27;or Pure Organic Argan Oil is a thin oil that is absorbed by my skin extremely well. My legs get dry and scaly in the winter. After treating them with this oil after each bath I noticed that they look and feel better. My skin soaks up the oil so well that the hand applying the oil does not feel unpleasantly oily. The bottle has a mist applicator, which worked well. After two pumps, I use my hand to massage the oil into the skin. Once the oil is applied I can see the skin glistening yet it does not feel oily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My second application of the oil is my hair. I recently began coloring a white streak in my hair, when I applied oil to my scalp and the colored hair it felt softer and more pleasant to touch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Argan Oil is unscented. I do not detect any scent sniffing the bottle, or when I spread the oil on my skin. I prefer unscented products, so I was very pleased with this aspect of the Argan Oil as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pura D&#x27;or Oil comes in a glass bottle that can become slippery if you get oil on it. To avoid it from falling and breaking I have a piece of paper towel on hand to wipe it after use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received an evaluation sample from the manufacture to share my experience with potential buyers. I found the oil to be effective, with long lasting results, and nice to use. I have been using it for a few weeks and I will continue to use it. I recommend it to others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ali Julia review</li>
    <li> This is my first time buying this product.  It is absorbed quickly for an oil.  It smooths and brings out my curls which I like, it is lightweight, and is a great skin moisturizer.</li>
    <li> I bought this and other oils plus argan cream to create my own moisturizing concoction. I am a real do-it-yourselfer. Most of the cosmetic products you buy have almost no decent ingredients, but a lot of preservatives and other additives which are just fillers and ingredients to make it mix together. I dont want that.</li>
    <li> Pura D&#x27;or Pure Argan Oil is a wonderful moisturizer,  I am 64 and this is the best moisturizer for my face that I have found.  It takes very little and leaves your skin wonderfully silky.  So many others have reviewed it for hair and face but I also found that it stopped my eczema from itching and promoted healing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If your have eczema you know how horrible the itching can get.  Nothing seems to stop it.  Argan Oil stopped my itching immediately and gave me relief.  Then I noticed that the red patches looked healthier and eventually it was healed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I encourage you to try one bottle and you will be hooked.  I know I am.  This product does so many things.  It truly is a miracle oil and is totally pure, it is 100% Argan oil from Morocco.</li>
    <li> I fried my hair lightening it and it was sooooo course..i am at the 1.5 month mark of the no-poo method. I splurged on this because I am desperate for longer fuller healthy looking/feeling hair. not sure it will help thicken or grow...but my hair feels sooooo much better. not course any more. cheers</li>
    <li> This is my second bottle and I&#x27;m a big fan of the product.  I use it primarily on the ends of my hair as a final step after styling but it is also outstanding for dry cuticles.  (I poured some in small bottle with a brush and &amp;#34;paint&amp;#34; it on my nails and cuticles.  Nothing that I have ever used in the past works like argan oil.  The chemical serums just don&#x27;t match up to this product.  Argan oil doesn&#x27;t just coat to give you a smooth look and manage split ends, it actually penetrates and moisturizes.  I like ordering from Amazon because the price is a fraction of what I would pay for pure argan oil if I bought it in Sephora. It&#x27;s an incredible value and it lasts a very long time--a little goes a long way!</li>
    <li> Organic, fragrance free, great for sensitive skin. Multipurpose - mixes well with other moisturizers or can be used alone. Pump dispenser makes it less likely to spill (compared to dropper dispensers). Good value</li>
    <li> I mainly use argan oil in my hair because I have long, black hair that undergoes a lot of heat/sun damage and I use this pure oil sparingly but it works wonders. It&#x27;s multi-functional (as the description says) and I always keep a bottle handy. This brand is great too because it&#x27;s pure argan oil, not &amp;#34;moroccan oil&amp;#34; which is usually diluted argan oil mixed with other silicones and fragrances. Of course, pure argan oil is more expensive, but to deeply nourish damaged hair/skin it&#x27;s worth keeping this secret weapon handy and I stick with Pura D&#x27;or for the supply. Thanks Amazon!</li>
    <li> LOVE this product!! Works better than anything I&#x27;ve ever tried. Truly wonderful!</li>
    <li> This oil is absolutely amazing. I use it for Hair-treatments, but especially as daily moisturizer Oil.&lt;br /&gt;It absorbs quickly  and nourishes, moisturizes and restores my Skin and Hair.&lt;br /&gt;A few drops go a longgg way ....a definitely &amp;#34;Keeper&amp;#34; in my daily Beauty Regiment</li>
    <li> I love this so much. This keeps my skin so smooth and clear of all blemishes. Tried it on hair too and it helps to keep my scalp clear of dandruff.</li>
    <li> I seriously love this stuff.  I use it after every shower all over, I use it to smooth my hair, tame fly-aways, and as an extra moisture layer when I&#x27;m going biking, hiking, or running in this winter weather.  Has saved my face and lips.  My husband uses it when we head out now too.</li>
    <li> I used the argan oil from Josie maran and it was my first Argan oil ever. I loved the results on my skin and hair. Problem it it was way too expensive for very small amounts. I searched Amazon for an alternative solution that would have similar quality. This product had rave reviews so i tried it. Pura d&#x27;or is great! Smell is a little stronger but it does not bother me AT ALL and it gives me the results I&#x27;m looking for!  Pura d&#x27;or Im here to stay... even with the $4 price increase!</li>
    <li> Excellent.  Much better than the other brand I was using.</li>
    <li> This product is ok... it broke me out like CRAZY and made my facial hair increase by 50% it looks like. I use it on my hair, but I warn you do not use it on your face. I now use Rosehip seed oil and Emu oil which has calmed it down way better. The oil itself is great quality, but I do not recommend (as well as others) to put the oil on your face.</li>
    <li> I have been using pura d&#x27;or argan oil for six months and I am happy to say that it is an excellent product with many uses.  In the past I tried Organix hydrating Moroccan Argan Oil Dry Oil. I should&#x27;ve put it back on the shelf after seeing mineral oil and fragrance as two of the ingredients, but I didn&#x27;t. After the first use I broke out in a terribly itchy rash and promptly disposed of it. Pura d&#x27;or argan oil is 100% argan oil with no chemicals added and your skin, hair, and nails will thank you for that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product has a silky texture and an herbal scent. I like the glass bottle and spray cap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I mainly use this argan oil on my face. I have super sensitive, dry, and acne prone skin. At night I use a cleanser to wash and then massage the oil gently onto wet skin. When I wake up in the morning my skin is soft. I&#x27;ve heard that argan oil has some antibacterial properties and maybe that is why it doesn&#x27;t cause me any break outs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is also excellent for hair. I squirt a little oil on my hands rub them together and then work through the ends of clean, wet hair. It makes my hair silky soft and smooth. I had an itchy scalp this past winter so I rubbed the argan oil into my scalp, waited a half hour then washed it out. No more dry itchy scalp!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hands turn into sand paper in the winter. When they were really bad and cracking I rubbed the oil into my hands and cuticles before bed which was very effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s great to find a product that is safe, effective, and useful. I will continue to purchase pura d&#x27;or argan oil in the future.</li>
    <li> Have tried others and this one has a funky smell to it.</li>
    <li> I decided to purchase this particular brand of argan oil after doing lots of general research about the oil and reading reviews for many different brands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have eczema on my hands which leaves the knuckles constantly very itchy (I tear my hands up scratching them until they become raw and often bleed).  They&#x27;re ashy, dry and the skin is thick and not pliable.  I always tried to hide my hands because they looked awful!  I also have combination but very sensitive skin on my face (oily nose, dry forehead, cheeks and chin area).  My face has lots of blemishes from the sensitivity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The day I received the oil I applied it after washing my hands, leaving them slightly damp.  I massaged one pump into both hands.  My knuckles immediately looked healthier, almost normal.  There is an extremely faint eucalyptus aroma in the bottle, but once it&#x27;s applied and absorbed into the skin, I cannot smell it whatsoever (I&#x27;m also sensitive to fragrance so I was somewhat worried about this).  After applying, my skin was not oily at all.  I did try it on dry hands a little later in the day, and found it did not absorb quite as well.  On damp skin, there is no oily feel whatsoever, unless you use too much oil.  A little goes a very long way!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I got home from work that night, after washing my hands and face, I applied the oil to my hands.  I used two pumps for both hands and massaged it in.  I used the second pump of oil so I could apply the extra oil to my face in my problem areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is now 2 weeks since I started using argan oil.  The skin on my face is radiant, even textured and clear of blemishes!  My hands look and feel normal for the first time in about 20 years!  I have not had one single itching spell so I don&#x27;t have cuts and abrasions!!!  All the lotions, creams and moisturizers I&#x27;ve tried in the past 30+ years cannot touch this.  I will never spend another penny on anything else for my skin.  I&#x27;m completely addicted to Pura D&#x27;or argan oil!  It&#x27;s simply amazing!!!an oil!  It&#x27;s simply amazing!!!</li>
    <li> For FYI, Im 34 years old never used oil priducts and top of that I have a very sensitive skin and so far I did not have any problems with facial sensitivity or break outs from Pura d&#x27;or 100% Pure &amp; USDA Organic Argan Oil. I would highly recommend this product for someone with sensitive skin.I am not paid to give review just very pleased and want others to benefit from the great results too knowing how hard to find a good face product for sensitive skin like me. Thank You very much for your time to read my review.</li>
    <li> Really love this oil!  Had read several articles stating it was great for nails and cuticles.  I had open heart surgery and now on many medications.  My skin, my hair, my nails, have all suffered, due in part to the medications.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ordered this product and have used it for only two days.  Results to my hands, nails, cuticles are truly amazing and hands looked so much better.  Almost cried at results!!! Going to try on face tonight and also just light sweep over my hair.  Before all of this happened, I had somewhat oily skin and oily hair--not anymore!!  Now, just very dry!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like it so much that I am going to order for my daughter who endures the winter whether in Kansas!!!</li>
    <li> This is the first review I have ever written about any beauty product I have ever used. I cannot say enough good things about this argan oil. I put it on my face in the morning and it preps my naturally dry skin for makeup beautifully. When using regular moisturizers along with liquid foundation, my face usually becomes greasy by the end of the day. Not with this product. It moisturizes and leaves my skin dewy and luminous all day - even in the humid New Orleans weather! In addition to my face, neck and hands, this argan oil is the only thing that has properly moisturized my extremely dry legs - and only after a few uses! I am a believer and will sing the praises of this product to everyone I know - or who compliments me on this new, glowing complexion of mine! THANK YOU!!!</li>
    <li> The product arrived in tact. I like it&#x27;s effect on my hair.</li>
    <li> This product is working great for me.  I read that some people don&#x27;t like the delivery pump but I think it gives you exactly the right amount with no waste.  I have been using it on my clean face every night concentrating it on my dry areas and my skin feels soft in the morning and the dryness is going away.  I have only been using it about 3 weeks but it seems to be working great.  When this bottle is empty, I am planning on buying another one.  I also think it is a good value for the money!</li>
    <li> Thanks to all reviews here and that made my purchase.  I applied a few drops on the tip of my hair and it works really well, no more dry ends!  It is so versatile, I use it on my legs and elbows on dry winter days.</li>
    <li> I love this Argan oil.  It makes my hair so soft and shiny.  It is easy to use and has a pleasant smell.  I&#x27;ve tried many other of the oils and this one by far is my favorite.  I also use it on my face and it leaves it with a nice dewy complexion.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t know what to expect, thought this oil would probably be too greasy, but turned out that&#x27;s definitely not the case. I will be using this in addition to emu for dry skin. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I have fine hair that tangles easily. I cannot imagine not using this oil: makes hair shiny and manageable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As an alternative for in-between argan treatments, I would recommend using Tea Tree oil (on roots only). Nice oil and has antifungal properties in addition to moisturizing properties. You can use this one (a mix of essential oils in a neutral oil: you cannot use pure tea tree oil on the skin): [[ASIN:B000A3V1XC Hollywood Beauty Tea Tree Oil 2 oz.]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The two oils have done wonders for my hair.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this Oil for about a month now and it works like a magic for my dry skin in the winter. It is very smooth, absorbs quickly and looks natural, clean.</li>
    <li> Purchased and used in my short, coarse hair. Smells usually bother me and this wasn&#x27;t much of an exception. I did see results but I ended up giving it to my daughter due to the smell. Probably something that wont bother others, would recommend.</li>
    <li> I love the brand! Argan oil is a daily essential to help my hair grow stronger and shiny! My hair used to breaks and tangles a lot. Now it became healthier after using this product.</li>
    <li> This is the same stuff as other high priced products.  100% pure organic argan oil is 100% pure organic argan oil, regardless of how you package it or whose name you put on it (I&#x27;m looking at you Josie Maran)!  If argan oil works well for you, this is a good way to save you some money.</li>
    <li> Softer skin, silkier hair - what more could you ask for? I use a variety of oils in my skincare routine, but this is by far my favorite and my skin loves it. I also use it as somewhat of a primer for my lips while I&#x27;m applying my base makeup, especially if the lipstick I&#x27;m going to use is particularly drying or matte, for instance. A little goes a long way, so this is great for the price as it only takes 1 to 2 pumps of the bottle to cover your face, neck, and décolletage. Love this and I&#x27;ll be purchasing more once my bottle runs out.</li>
    <li> product arrived quickly;  appears to be as advertised.</li>
    <li> I bought this to try out since I&#x27;ve been reading about it on blogs and in magazines. Not sure about how pure this is. One thing I know is that I like the product. I tend to have an oily face. But I apply two drops after I wash my face. My face is still shiny of course. But my face doesn&#x27;t feel greasy as much. It keeps my face consistent since I tend to have combination skin and over moisturizer to compensate. Best value in terms of volume and price. And I&#x27;ll be using this for awhile.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Pura d&#x27;or for over a year and love what it does for my skin.  I have very dry skin and use this morning and night after I cleanse and it just makes my face feel so good.  I always use a moisturizer after I put it on but wait tell it has time to soak into your skin.  I feel the price is a real plus because some Argan oil is very expensive.</li>
    <li> I thought I would use it for at least 2 weeks before leaving a feedback but I could not resist writing something up for it after I used it for just a few days. To begin with, I was looking for a Vit E oil for my skin and I came across this oil which I thought of giving it a try, given its price (as compared to Argan oil at Sephora). I am smitten now. I used it for my face and hair and found an instant glow. It is super light and feels so smooth. I had a zit near my ear and I was avoiding it since few days, I accidentally applied the oil to that while applying the oil to my face and I noticed that the zit had decreased in size the next morning. This oil has become a daily beauty routine for me now. I cannot wait to try it on my underarms (which unfortunately are dark). I am positive that the oil will be very good there as well.&lt;br /&gt;Will definitely buy again</li>
    <li> I started using this product this week and absolutely love it. I&#x27;ve struggled with terrible breakouts that came on in adulthood so I am very careful with what I use. This makes my feel healthier, look healthier and it feels light (I use it at night) on my skin. It does not irritate my skin in the least. I also have to mention their packaging! Everything is natural and biodegradable from the leaflet enclosed, to the ink, and packaging! You have to support a company that absorbs additional costs to protect our planet! Great product. Will continue to purchase it.</li>
    <li> I was looking for an organic oil that is light. This is organic, priority, soaks in immediately and leaves my skin feeling soft. It&#x27;s now my go to.</li>
    <li> I really like this product.  My hair is super super dry so I think it will take a few applications to really see noticeable differences, but I can already feel the difference.  My hair feels so much smoother and healthier!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for 1 year now and I love it. It makes my skin extra smooth. I also use a tab of it on my wet hair after shampooing and similarly, it leaves my hair feeling smoother. You only need a very small amount, so the bottle goes a long way. I have oily skin, so I was very worried about adding more oil to my skin, but this oil gets absorbed nicely and does not make my face oiler. I highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using my Pura d&#x27;or Argan oi for almost three weeks now.  I did a lot of reviews of other brands before I settled on this one and I must say I am not disappointed.  If you think it is pricey, it is worth it.  Firstly, all you need is a tad  at a time: on your face, on your nails, just a TAD.  It really SPREADS so it can last a really loooooooong time. The surface of my face now looks plumped, like the fat cells got an injection of botox!  It&#x27;s hard to describe but my face looks dewy and soft and alive!  My routine is to wipe it first with a wedge of lemon, leave that for about 10 minutes, wash with black soap, then apply a TAD of the argan oil.  My skin  doesn&#x27;t look greasy and that&#x27;s all the moisturizing I need if I am going to apply foundation.  At nites, I use 2 tads...don&#x27;t ask me why...it&#x27;s psychological!! Lol!  I also use it on my nails and the cuticles immediately look improved; the dryness vanishes immediately.  The thing that I realy love about the product is that it absorbs into the skin extremely fast especially when you use it immediately after cleansing and it is NOT oily.  I am such a happy customer and glad I gave it a chance.</li>
    <li> Excellent for men as a pre/aftershave... It&#x27;s often hard to find an oil you can use on your face and hair that won&#x27;t make either appear greasy or dull. I am very pleased with this product.</li>
    <li> I was hesitant because I am allergic to EVERYTHING!  I&#x27;ve been suffering with discoid eczema for months now.  I won&#x27;t say Pura d&#x27;or cured it, but it certainly took the red away in a matter of minutes.  Used it on an allergic outbreak around my eyes, too, with great results.  I&#x27;m a fan!</li>
    <li> I have been applying the Argan Oil mainly at night time after I wash my face.  After using it for a month I have noticed the blackheads around my nose are non existent, pores are tightening, my skin&#x27;s appearance is more supple, and has a healthy glow.</li>
    <li> I got this lovely bottle since last Christmas and definitely loveeee it. I am a type of person that is really obsessed with hair. I used countless of hair care products, serum, leave in treatment, hair masks, etc. However, the one that won&#x27;t weight down on my hair and make my hair oily is this great product. I have a very thick and long hair, however a few drop of this product goes along way. It makes my hair look so shiny and I never have to suffer from a frizzy, lion-like hair.  I used it everyday, one drop each day and the bottle last til now. Just purchased 2 more bottles just to make sure that I have good stock on this awesome product. Please never discontinue this because I can&#x27;t imagine how I can live my life without this cutie.</li>
    <li> This might just be the best product I&#x27;ve ever purchased from Amazon. I have sever dry skin. My face especially gets really dry, red, and itchy. Every lotion absorbs right away but I&#x27;m still left with a dry face. I tried using organic coconut oil on my face but it did nothing to moisturize. I decided to give Argan Oil a try. It works wonders. In about two days my cracked and peeling skin on my face completely improved. I will be using this product for life!</li>
    <li> I added this to some coconut oil and apple cider vinegar as a homemade hair treatment, and there was a definite difference in the look and feel of my hair afterwards. By itself, the argan oil makes my hair much less frizzy without making it feel heavy or flattened, which tends to happen if you use too much coconut oil or if it&#x27;s still stuck in your hair after rinsing it. It also made my hair shinier and softer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The oil itself barely has any scent to it, which I like, and it doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy film or clog pores. As a facial treatment, the argan oil kind of lightened the dark circles under my eyes and it&#x27;s also a really good moisturizer. Overall, I&#x27;m incredibly happy with this product and I would buy again from this seller.</li>
    <li> I am a minimalist when it comes to my face and hair, the less I use, the better, so when I found this I was excited at the thought of being able to have a product that would do double duty.  I just turned 40 and have started worrying more about wrinkles and uneven skin tone, things I never really thought about in my 20&#x27;s and 30&#x27;s, so I was hopeful that this oil would help.  I have been using it for just shy of 7 weeks and can honestly say that I have noticed a difference in my skin.  The &amp;#34;elevens&amp;#34; between my eyes are quite a bit diminished and my skin is just more even-toned, also I have had a lot less breakouts and my skin is not dry like it used to get in the summer.  Just for reference, I wash my face with a mild cleanser, use Joy &amp; Karma Hyaluronic Acid Serum, and moisturize with Pura d&#x27;or Argan Oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as using it in my hair, I had been using Got 2be Smooth Operator and I really liked it, but it kind of left my hair feeling a bit heavy after a while.  So I switched to this and I&#x27;m really glad I did!  My hair feels super soft, the tangles comb out more easily, it&#x27;s tons less frizzy, and it even dries faster (I&#x27;m not sure how that works, but it does).  I only use a couple of pumps right after I wash my hair, which is another great thing!  Even using this on both my face and hair for the past 7 weeks I still have more than half of the bottle left, so it lasts quite a long time.  I don&#x27;t use anything on my hair other than shampoo, conditioner, and this oil because it pretty much does everything I need it to do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m really happy with it and will definitely buy it again.  :)</li>
    <li> Wanted a cheaper version of the Josie Maran Argan Oil and this works perfectly!</li>
    <li> I purchased this as I was running low on the &amp;#34;popular and very pricey name brand&amp;#34; argan oil I first used. This is a LOT more product at an amazing price. Over the summer the sun takes its toll on my skin and hair. Using argan oil helped a lot, especially after days on the beach. This is in my opinion much better than the pricey brand...which if I didn&#x27;t use it consistently my skin and hair would become drier than ever...not sure why that is but it never happened with this product and this feels much better. Love it.</li>
    <li> This an amazing deal! I have extremely dry skin and I am tired of buying products with too many ingredients that eventually dry my skin out further, or simply do not penetrate my skin deep enough. This immediately feels fantastic and my skin no longer feels tight. I love that I can mix it with other moisturizers or wear it under makeup. I will never buy another product to help with my dry, uncomfortable skin.</li>
    <li> I have long and (very, very) thick hair. I wanted something to help restore the moisture in my chemically-processed and brittle hair. I use about 2 pumps on my wet, clean hair for about a week now. It did not change my hair over night. But I can say that it is slowly restoring the moisture in my hair. I originally purchased this for my hair, but when I read about all the other benefits of argan oil, I have also started using this on my face, arms, feet, nails. My husband also noticed the effect on my face, so he started using it also. Since it&#x27;s organic and natural, I have also used this on my kids&#x27; skin at night time. The effect is more noticeable on my skin than on my hair. It is non-greasy. A single pump goes a long way. I chose this brand over the other ones because of the pump. For me, it&#x27;s more convenient than the ones that come with the medicine dropper.</li>
    <li> This is the first time I have ever purchased Argan Oil.  I have had many friends tell me about it so I figured I would give it a shot.  I love it!  My hair feels great when I put this on.  Won&#x27;t be without it now.  Thanks for a great product.</li>
    <li> I live in a desert climate and was looking for an oil that would help me retain some moisture in my dry hair. Every oil that I&#x27;d tried was either too greasy for my hair or made my hair drier. I had heard wonderful things about argan oil but I always avoided it because of the price.    Well after trying everything, I caved it and purchased a popular hair brand&#x27;s version of argan oil. I was impressed by its results but that particular brand contained fragrance, and I was spending $10 for only 1 ounce. Pura d&#x27;or was not only a less expensive option but 100% organic, which was a win-win.    I couldn&#x27;t be happier with this product. It makes my hair feel soft, repaired and visibly shinier and healthier-looking. I also appreciate the structure of the bottle. The pump makes it easier to disburse as opposed to having a dropper. I love this oil and I plan to make it a staple in my hair regimen. **Update** I&#x27;ve also made this my new face moisturizer. I&#x27;ve been using it on my face for about a week now and it is clearing up a lot of discolorations. My skin looks a lot brighter and even-toned. It&#x27;s official, I can&#x27;t be without this!</li>
    <li> Great on your face, hands and nails!!!</li>
    <li> I have used this product for awhile and my nails have never looked healthier.  They are stronger and don&#x27;t peal or chip.  I love the way it makes them look.</li>
    <li> This product is fantastic!! There are so many uses, and ways to combine it with common products, to make them amazing products&lt;br /&gt;fast shipping. Non-greasy. No smell. Will last a long time. I applied to my skin and hair and it did not feel slimy or greasy at all. No fragrance - I don&#x27;t have to worry about smelling funny, ha! I&#x27;m sensitive to fragrances, so that&#x27;s a big deal for me. A few drops will do the job and at that rate, it&#x27;s a very good value and will last a long time.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using it in my beard and loving it. My wife has started using it on her face and is hooked. The dispenser is helpful too, I wonder if they have an economy size!</li>
    <li> Well I&#x27;ve been using this for three days now and so far I have seen a little change.so if three days is little I can only imagine how GORGEOUS I&#x27;ll be after six weeks. It comes with a pump and I use three pumps every time I use it .it&#x27;s not greasy...a little goes along way...I&#x27;ve been putting it on my hair,body,and face.No this has not caused acne breakouts,my makeup goes over this smooth and easy. YES I RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT..</li>
    <li> I could tell my hair was shinier and smoother after just a few uses of this. It&#x27;s a product I&#x27;ll definitely continue to buy.</li>
    <li> I have been meaning to try real Argan Oil for a while after trying lots of oils that were not pure. The ones that claim to be Argan Oil but are soemthing else , and just have some argan oil.  I live on tropical weather were the conditions ( sun , wind, sand , salt and harsh shower water) make it a real challenge to maintain healthy looking hair.  I got this oil because it says its 100% and fair trade which makes sense as a responsible purchase. I tried it a couple of times and I can honestly say that so far it has protected my hair and it leaves it feeling super soft . And the frizz, the dreaded frizz its much diminished. Like I said so far so good!</li>
    <li> i have very sensitive skin due to allergies and contact dermatitis.  the argan oil does not sting or irritate my skin, and helps me to recover from rashes by keeping my skin moisturized.  my only complaint is the pump which makes it harder to control how much comes out of the bottle.  great price for the quality and the amount you get (4 fl oz.).</li>
    <li> I borrowed this product from a friend and after two nights I was incredibly surprised with the changed look and feel of my skin (it glowed and felt tighter).  I immediately purchased my own bottle and have found that again, after only one application, my skin is glowing.  My &amp;#34;no-makeup look&amp;#34; at the gym this morning even got compliments.  Looking forward to trying other products from this line.</li>
    <li> Awesome stuff....cant live without it!  I use it everyday.</li>
    <li> I have been using Pura d&#x27;or for about a week now and my skin feels very soft and I don&#x27;t notice the dryness I was experiencing before.  I have many allergies and am thrilled that I can use this without any reaction or side effects.  I have not tried it on my hair but I have been rubbing it into my cuticles at bedtime and hoping it will help with all the cracking and hangnails you seem to get throughout the winter.  I am very happy with my purchase and would buy again.</li>
    <li> Used the Argan oil this morning after cleansing my face. I love it!  I never thought i could put on an oil facially and not feel like I fell into a grease pit!  It is very light.  I am stuck at the house today(and many days to come) so I put it on my face about 5am and my skin feels hydrated and soft 7 hrs later.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do have alittle shine to my face but I always do eventually during the day but not as much as my moisturizer w/ sunscreen shines.  I love to try new stuff and incidently I just wipe off any residue of the oil onto the ends of my hair....bonus!!&lt;br /&gt;If you don&#x27;t have any you might want to try it!  Thanks again.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product nightly for over a month, along with using a tiny amount to apply my concealer in the morning.  It is a lovely oil, and is well priced.  I will definitely be purchasing again, and highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Great product!  Works well on skin.</li>
    <li> Absolutely beautiful shine to hair that has been dull, brittle and lifeless for as long as I can remember.  Though initially not bought for the skin benefits, after reading enclosed pamphlet I applied to the several small patches of psoriasis I have.  To my amazement after years of trying EVERYTHING, this little oil took the plaques away and the redness has diminished.  Will faithfully continue to use and recommend to all my friends.</li>
    <li> Very good hair care product~~~~~~~~</li>
    <li> It really helped my skin since it was getting so dry. I have been in the sun quite abit lately.  Judy</li>
    <li> and i will be going to it from now on...t&#x27;s richer, sinks right in. it&#x27;s fabulous, much better quality for hair and skin.</li>
    <li> The hair oil is good. Keeps my hair soft and shiny. I can&#x27;t speak about hair regrowth, maybe the effects can vary from person to person, but this oil is definitely good, hair appears healthy and good. I would recommend this over any gel products. The oil is non-sticky and leaves your hands without being greasy. Can also be used on body. Overall good product, I won&#x27;t mind buying it again.</li>
    <li> I highly recommend this product. I use it on my face and hair. Even my husband likes it when I put some on his hair.  My only regret is not finding sooner.</li>
    <li> I never heard of the oil before I saw the reviews. I am pleased. I like how quickly it absorbs and without odor. Other people wrote that they use it for various body areas; I only use it for my face as an alternative to my creams.  I bought it after I read other reviews and I agree about the quality.</li>
    <li> I was a little skeptical to buy this product as it has a lot of reviews that seem too good to be true. I still bought it. I liked the way this product worked on my skin. My skin is very dry. I used a variety to beauty products but my skin was not moisturized enough. The first time i used Pura D&#x27; I saw a difference. My skin was bright and glowing. I use it two times a day and my skin looks radiant. I have stopped all other beauty products now! Seeing how it worked on my skin I applied it on my husband. Due to constant use of glasses he has skin discoloration around the eyes and nose region. I now see the discoloration very gradually fading. Overall I like this product on Skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For Hair, I think its a little too heavy on mine. Though I use a very small amount it makes my hair a little oily after the 2nd day of shampoo. I still use it though after straightening my hair.</li>
    <li> I have been using it for about a month now and I will say I love it.... I have combo skin.... And I am 38...never thought I would put oil on my face... But I actually look forward to it! It does make my skin look nice.... And its has seemed to cut any breakouts down to nothing.  Very impressive I will repurchase.</li>
    <li> This is the best oil I have ever used. I don&#x27;t normally wash my face with soap. I just rinse with warm water and then use oil to remove make up and to moisturize. I had been using almond and jojoba oils but they are too greasy. Pura d&#x27;or argan oil is wonderful. It&#x27;s light and non-greasy, leaves my skin super-soft and it&#x27;s also the perfect base for makeup. I&#x27;ll order this again for sure!</li>
    <li> Works great on my naturally curly hair. Will buy again.</li>
    <li> I am so happy to receive the product.  The oil has a great quality.  I use it for my hair and my hand.  It makes my hair silky and hands softer.  I am very happy with this product.  You only need a size of a pea to get the result.  I definitely will order again.</li>
    <li> I bought this after watching you tube skin care videos on using essential oils on face rather than chemical filled creams. I&#x27;m happy with this choice and my skin feels smoother with its application.</li>
    <li> Awesome product, a little goes along way.</li>
    <li> We almost tried all brand of Organic, We finally found out what we want.&lt;br /&gt;ME AND MY WIFE LOVE IT !!!</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t believe it until I tried it...it makes my skin so luxurios and my hair!  I am so excited...and that nasty scar on my arm is also slowly getting less viable... I love it, so excited to see long lasting results... my hands and feet and hair are happy!  Need to get my mom and sister on this magic oil! Thank you!</li>
    <li> Definitely worth buying. Skin feels healthier and vibrant. I don&#x27;t go to bed without applying some on. However, I do not apply it in the morning because its too thick on the skin for morning use. I heard its also good for for hair use but have not tried that yet. Overall, excellent product.</li>
    <li> This is the 3rd bottle I&#x27;ve bought, I love this oil! It is not sticky &amp; has a nice (very mild) scent. I use it on my face daily. I also massage it into my hair before flat ironing, to protect the hair from heat damage. It seems to be working well! I like that it comes in a glass bottle too. Highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> My wife and I are both using this product and really enjoy it.  It has greatly improved and protected my facial complexion from the sun&#x27;s damaging rays.  We use it daily and also find it protects  my hair from drying out by too much sun.  Great product that I will continue to purchase this product.</li>
    <li> I used the argan oil from Josie maran I love how wonderful of argan oil work wonder for the skin, since josie maran is way too expensive and i happened to search for alternative and still have a good quality as Josie maran. Pura d&#x27;or performs as good as JM but affordable. I am with the bottle number four and still keep using it. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I could immediately tell this product leaves my hair weightless, not gunky, and shiny. Unlike other products with Argan oil in it, this is 100% Argan oil and the feel on your hands and hair is unparalleled to the other brands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TL;DR I&#x27;d buy it again, It&#x27;s worth it.</li>
    <li> i like this oil very much. my hair has never more healthier than now. will buy it again</li>
    <li> I use it on my long hair, mainly on the ends to keep them from getting dry and it also makes it look shiny and healthier. A little goes a long way. I&#x27;m happy with this product and purchased this one because it is natural argan oil so no weird  strong smells and it is not tested on animals which is very important to me.</li>
    <li> The Pura d&#x27;or Argan oil is as good as any other name brand organic Argan Oil but it&#x27;s much cheaper than competition. It&#x27;s light and gets absorbed in skin and hair very quickly.</li>
    <li> That&#x27; what I needed not any other chemical product feel the difference&lt;br /&gt;Hair looks great and strong and soft&lt;br /&gt;Stay fresh</li>
    <li> I was skeptical of this product, but after reading all the great reviews I thought I&#x27;d give it a shot.  When I first started using it, I didn&#x27;t really notice any difference.  However, now that I&#x27;ve been using it for a week or so, I have noticed that those seemingly permanent blemishes are starting to fade and my skin is much softer and not dry at all.  I&#x27;m anxious to see how well it work through the dead of winter.</li>
    <li> Gives a nice smooth and hydrated feeling when used after the head bath on towel dry hair</li>
    <li> Thought this was doing a great job, during a very stressful 2 weeks. However I was using it and so was my mom, and we were both breaking out. She started using it a few days after me, so when I broke out i figured it was just stress, but when she started using this, and breaking out as well, I knew this was what was causing it. I had also been trying the bronzing  maracuja oil by tarte, and wasn&#x27;t sure which was the problem. So I only stopped the maracuja oil. I have since tried the maracuja on it&#x27;s own and have had no issues,aside from the awful smell. I might try this again but I am 100% certain this broke me out. Was using it before bed every night. My skin did feel moisturized however, the breakouts are not worth it.</li>
    <li> This oil is unscented and absorbs well into the skin without any oily residue.  I loved how my supple skin felt when I woke up in the morning! By the way, I also have combo and acne-prone skin, and this oil did not trigger any breakouts. This is going to be the perfect winter moisturizer!</li>
    <li> So for, I love it.  I use it on my face and hands, they feel very soft and the oil is absorbed.  Plan to continue using it.</li>
    <li> Love this product. No added junk and better than cream!</li>
    <li> This oil is absolutely amazing!!!!  Great for my face and dry hair..  It is a &amp;#34;must have&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> This product is absolutely amazing!!!! Great for my body and dry hair.I&#x27;m very happy to buy it.</li>
    <li> Pura d&#x27;or Argan Oil is absolutely wonderful. I use it for my face and hands. I use to occasionally wake up with puffy eyes. Since using Pura d&#x27;or Argan Oil, I have noticed that I don&#x27;t have so many puffy days. It has a very faint pleasant scent. I highly recommend Pura d&#x27;or Argan Oil. One other plus is that my order was delivered very quickly.</li>
    <li> After using it for 2weeks I cannot believe how soft my skin feels.</li>
    <li> This product is non oily, goes on smooth.feels great under makeup. I give this product 5 stars.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s my new go-to for everything!  love it!</li>
    <li> One of the best products I have ever used in my lifetime. Small quantity can do everything. Which means not costly compared to any other product in the market. Also tried using other products and hair loss started again. So getting back to Purad&#x27; or again and will never change again. Increased hair growth too.</li>
    <li> Came to amazon to find a cheaper alternative to the really pricey Josie Maran. I&#x27;ve had good experiences buying non-Josie organic argan oil before but this one is the best thus far! The bottle pump is beyond amazing for dispensing the oil; clean and easy to use. Very happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> I am rarely so taken with a product that I write a review within just a day or two.  I have happily used a very expensive, well known brand of Argan Oil for a while now but Pura d&#x27;or has converted me from a &amp;#34;you get what you pay for&amp;#34; believer to a &amp;#34;the proof is in the pudding&amp;#34; advocate.  The only difference I can find between Pura d&#x27;or and the much more expensive brand is price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Is it greasy or oily, absolutely not.  I can apply the Argan and immediately pick up a wet glass without it slipping and in a minute I can do a fingerprint test--pressing my finger against a mirror--without leaving a trace.  No oily feeling, barely detectable scent, quick absorption, soft, silky skin at an incredible price.  Couldn&#x27;t ask for more from a product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line is bye, bye expensive brand, hello Pura d&#x27;or.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s great, isn&#x27;t greasy, I can use it on my face, my hair and it absorbs quickly and leaves my skin soft.  I do use it on my face daily.  I Like it!</li>
    <li> this oil is awesome...use it on all over your body and on your hair.  i use it nightly as my moisturizer.  its perfect for face.</li>
    <li> I was shopping on Amazon for something completely different and saw all the good reviews on this product, which I hadn&#x27;t heard of before.  Affordable, organic and in a glass bottle instead of plastic caught my attention even more.  So I went ahead and bought it just to try out and now see what everyone loves about it.  When I first put it on my face my skin absorbed it like the desert does water.  It left it soft, smooth and oil free.  I absolutely love it! I use it night and day on my face under makeup.  My hands and the tips of my hair love it too.    It&#x27;s my new favorite product, it replaced many of the other expensive natural moisturizers I had.  Highly recommend it :)</li>
    <li> I use this for my face on regular basis&lt;br /&gt;all i can say is that, this is better than any cream i have ever bought in the past&lt;br /&gt;if i am not using this i am using my coconut oil</li>
    <li> Between the cost and the quality of the oil, I am very happy with this oil. I apply it after my shower in the evening for my face and it&#x27;s very moisturizing. Great for under eyes too.</li>
    <li> I got this from dailysteal...and as advertised, this product is really good and makes my skin so soft....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used to have jojoba oil on my face...now I definitely change to this product on my face and skin!!!!</li>
    <li> This is little pricy compare to other argan oil&lt;br /&gt;But quality is so good.&lt;br /&gt;I ordered this bottle and I found out this is a out standing morocan oil.</li>
    <li> My wife had me try hers for my dandruff and rough hands.  This stuff works great.  My hands are much smoother and my dandruff is way better.  You don&#x27;t need to use a lot, so it goes a long way.  I now have my own bottle of this and use it every day.  Get it you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> I use this on both mine and my daughters hair.  I have seen great results with our curls since starting.  It has helped with moisture, shine and scalp condition.</li>
    <li> I had a face lift by a plastic surgeon for one reason to fix my jaws. He tried twice but failed .  This Doctor was on TV all the time suppose to be a&lt;br /&gt;great surgeon. All he did was take my money but no improvement to my jaws. He just wanted more money to try again.  No way, the money I saved before  I retired for this type surgery is gone, that&#x27;s it. Lesson learned the hard way.  I am 67 years old I ordered purad&#x27;or  because my daughter was looking for a product for me and for her. We both ordered this one. I have use it for a week and cannot believe how well it works on my face. I would put it on top of my hands and put on my face to see if it improved my hands which is wrinkled and it did. My jaws have improved on how they look and the rest of my face! I have tried a lot of products this one so far is the best of them all. I hope to write another review after a few months of using&lt;br /&gt;this product. I am excited! Please send my another bottle for my review about this product because its working.  Thank You!</li>
    <li> Really great product. Fast shipping</li>
    <li> This product exceeded my expectations. There is only the mildest earthy smell to it, it goes on smooth and moisturizes my face and diminishes the look of lines and wrinkles. I have not had a single zit since I received it, and my boyfriend said my skin looks smoother and I have noticed my pores are smaller too, bonus! I was afraid to use this on my hair at first as I have thin hair but only a drop smoothed on the bottom ends of my hair and slowly brushed through after a shower is all you need for glossy healthy looking hair without looking greasy. Pura D&#x27;or has a customer for life!! I already use the gold shampoo, and rose seed oil too.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for 2 months and love it.  I use it every day just after a bath on my heels, elbows, knees,  arms and hair.  I have skin allergies and no issues with this product.  I have noticed that it keeps my skin looking moisturized and well hydrated without a greasy or shiny appearance.  My hair is oily after a couple days if I don&#x27;t wash it all the time.  But then it looks dry if I wash it every day.  I use this product in it when it&#x27;s wet after a shower and dry with styling and I don&#x27;t look oily even if I don&#x27;t wash my hair daily.  I love it.  It is the first I&#x27;ve tired but I am hooked.</li>
    <li> First, I have to say that I was already in love with the concept of argan oil. I had purchased a tiny bottle before from another company that was also pure argan oil.  When that bottle ran out, I started to get nervous and thought I should check out some others. This bottle was the same price but double the quantity.  Still, I was hesitant that it was not going to deliver the same results as my original bottle.  So, here is the thing...  I have been using it now for 2 weeks and I don&#x27;t know how  - but it is miles better!  This stuff has transformed my skin.  My large pores are gone, my cuticles softened, my hair feels softer and fuller!  This is the real surprise - this is the best thing to get your feet buttery soft!  My daughter who has super sensitive and acne prone skin came home and tried it and she has also become an addict.  Love love love it!  What one product can you literally use from head to toe and actually see real results?  Answer: This stuff!</li>
    <li> Wow this product is amazing. My hair was so dry that once I put this on, and only half a pump since I have thin hair, my hair ate it up! My hair is baby soft after 5 uses. Sister tried it once and she loves it!</li>
    <li> I have only tried one other argan oil, which was from Whole Foods. This is much better. This one also states to be cold-pressed, whereas the bottle from WF was expeller-pressed. I really like the pump on this larger bottle, as opposed to the dropper on the smaller bottles. I am very pleased with the way my skin feels after use. Within 5-10 minutes after application, my skins seems to fully absorb the oil and isn&#x27;t left greasy. I use it every few days on my face, but I try to use it every night on my hands and cuticles--it feels really nice. Even during the cold winter months, I have found myself using it on my hands before I go out (instead of a normal hand lotion). Very pleased.</li>
    <li> Excellent product. Delivered on time</li>
    <li> I like it so much, it&#x27;s a great for moisturizing dry skin and hair. I&#x27;ll buy another bottle.</li>
    <li> The Pura D&#x27;or Argan Oil is a great addition to my make-up and skin care routine. I use the oil after washing my face or applying my make-up for the day. It easily rubs in leaving my skin feeling moisturized and healthy without the greasy feeling I get with some jojoba or other oils. I will buy this product again.</li>
    <li> I am VERY impressed with this product for two reasons. First, I have battled poor skin my entire life, so I was a little wary about putting it on my face. I was afraid it would just exacerbate the problem. My skin does get a little dry from using acne products, so I thought this might be something that could add a little balance back to my skin. It does just that! And surprisingly, it absorbs into the skin very quickly and does not leave it feeling greasy.&lt;br /&gt;Second, you can skip all those hundred dollar wrinkle creams and just use this! I don&#x27;t have a lot of wrinkles or anything, but I do have fine lines around my eyes and, NO LIE, just minutes after applying this to my face, I noticed those lines plump up and become much less obvious. I was stunned, as I was not expecting that! I have also tried rubbing it into the heels of my feet and it does wonders there as well. I pretty much live barefoot whenever possible and my heels get dry and scaly (esp. in the winter) as a result. I put the Pura D&#x27;or on overnight and there is a noticeable difference in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;Lastly, this product is organic, and that is very important to me. For what it does, the cost of this product is more than fair! Youth in a bottle (as much as that is actually possible).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have rather fine hair, so I would never consider applying it to my hair, but I have no doubt that those with thick and or dry hair would love the shine this product would produce (I have used Argan oil shampoos and love it for shine). It is also wonderful for shining up dry fingernails.&lt;br /&gt;It is odorless, cool and soothing, and again, does not leave a greasy residue, as it absorbs readily into the skin.&lt;br /&gt;I love, love, love this product and will attest that it is worth every last penny being charged for it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a side note, this is a 4 oz. bottle and one need only use a pea sized amount when applying it to the face. There is no reason why this product can&#x27;t last between six months and a year..</li>
    <li> this is a life saver. if you have dry skin this does it. great price and I still have some despite using several drops a day</li>
    <li> I have been using this for 2 years now and I use it  on my hair, face and hands.&lt;br /&gt;when I started using it I had no idea how good my skin will become after using it in my regular routine.&lt;br /&gt;I use it after washing my hair and washing my face in the morning and night and then I put my moisturizer on top of that I have noticed after using the first bottle that I had smooth skin less acne and skin looking fresh I cant comment on any wrinkles but people who have dull skin that oil will do the trick so U should def give it a try all in all I am happy with this product AND yes my husband just started using it in his hair too instead of hair cream he thinks that his hair feel better.and yes I used every bottle twice a day and it lasted me almost 6 months every time so a little goes a long way it absorbs into your skin really good.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing and I can&#x27;t believe how soft my skin feels with just using the product for a short time.  My fly-away hair is tamed, my face and skin is incredibly soft and scaly skin is no more.  My cuticles on my hands and feet have never been this soft and pretty.  I highly recommend this product as an all-around body treatment.</li>
    <li> restores damaged hair</li>
    <li> The best organic shampoo in the market. I&#x27;ve used both the blue and gold label Pura D&#x27;or products now, and they are so far the best products I&#x27;ve used for my hair.  I keep getting told by my friends and family in the last week that my hair is looking thicker and that is looks like its growing back! I finally found the solution to my hair loss. Im so excited im finally going to have a a thicker and fuller hair.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a cheaper alternative to Josie Maran&#x27;s Argan oil which I love and introduced to my sister and now she loves it, too. The problem is, Josie&#x27;s Argan oil is expensive, so I decided to give this as a gift to my sister for her to try. She said it&#x27;s just as good as the more expensive oil and she also appreciated that the packaging was environment-friendly. I would not hesitate to buy it for myself in the future.</li>
    <li> Love this product and it lasts a long time.  Great for my face.</li>
    <li> In love!, very good product, not as oily as the other brands and great for acne prone skin.</li>
    <li> Love this oil, especially on my face, it dries quick but keeps you moisturized at the same time, without feeling greasy, I also use it as a make up remover, and on my scalp when it&#x27;s dry. Anyway they promise to send you a second bottle for free when you review but they never sent mine.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for less than a week, but I don&#x27;t know how I lived without it. I am in the process of replacing all of my beauty products chemical free versions. I was using another brand that claimed to be organic, but had way too many other chemicals in it. This has a single ingredient, which is what got my attention. My hair loves it, and a little goes a long way. I have fine, straight hair just past my shoulders, and a lot of it. I only need one pump and my hair feels soft and has more shine. More than one pump, and it gets a little oily, but that just means the bottle will last longer. I&#x27;ve also been using it as a moisturizer, and my skin is softer than ever without the shine added by most oils. Overall, this is an amazing product with hardly any smell at all, and I would recommend it to anyone looking for healthy hair and skin.</li>
    <li> No scent. I love it. It also comes with a squirt  pump - no dropper!!!!!! Will buy this again for sure - just have to watch the price which fluctuates. Great product.</li>
    <li> My wife has tried many products, to include other brands of Argan Oil.  In the end, she swears that Pura d&#x27;or is the only product that shows noticeable results.  When it comes to my wife, she knows her beauty products and will not purchase any other brand.  I truly believe that if it was sold at $100 per ounce, she would still purchase the product.</li>
    <li> This Argon oil is amazing!!! I have used it for 2 weeks and my hair, skin, and lips have never looked better. My hair shines but is not oily looking at all. People actually ask me what I&#x27;m doing differently with my hair and I tell them it is the Argon oil. Every winter I have chapped lips. I have tried many different chopsticks and cremes, but this is by far the best product I have ever used. My lips are softer than ever.&lt;br /&gt;My children also use the oil on their hair and skin and it works well even though they have somewhat sensitive skin. Finally a product for hair and skin for the whole family! I&#x27;m hooked!</li>
    <li> I was super excited to get this product as I was wanting to try something with a more friendly price tag than the Josie maran sample I had been using from sephora. This does not disappoint. Same consistency, feel, results, and a much better price. Plus the bottle is huge so it will last forever. It also didn&#x27;t have any weird smells like some oils can have...like rancid cooking oil. I use it in my hair and on my face at night. Very very nice and totally worth trying out. A great dupe for Josie maran.</li>
    <li> Great value for the money. This feels and acts the same as a more expensive brand I tried previously. I like using this on my skin and hair.</li>
    <li> Hands down the best Argan oil I have ever used! It is organic, does not contain harsh chemicals and most of all is budget friendly (unlike Josie Maran&#x27;s ridiculously priced Argan oils). Considering that it&#x27;s deluxe size (4oz) the price is just unbeatable. The packaging is excellent as it comes in a dark bottle and even has a pump which is very convenient. The oil has a very subtle scent that cannot be smelled unless of course you put your nose to it. I have not used the oil so much as to see drastic results. but after using it regularly for a week I have noticed that my skin has become much softer and healthier. The oil, however, does not seem to work on my acne. But nonetheless, I am very impressed with Pura d&#x27;or&#x27;s Argan oil. Will definitely purchase again. Thank you Pura d&#x27;or for creating such an amazing product.</li>
    <li> Excellent product for the nails. A year ago my nails were a complete disaster, braking and spliting all the time. I&#x27;ve using the Oil every single night and now I can tell you that I get compliments all the time. The nails are long and very strong, all thanks to the Argan Oil, I&#x27;ll continue using this for ever.</li>
    <li> I just started using the product so I need to give this a little more time.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great.  I used to have bad beard flakes until I tried this out.  Washing and moisturizing with lotions weren&#x27;t cutting it, but after just 2 days of using Pura d&#x27;or Argan oil I&#x27;m back to wearing black shirts worry free. I can&#x27;t recommend this product enough.</li>
    <li> I just received it in the mail today. It leaves your skin feeling so soft and smooth.  I plan on using some in my handmade face cream. I give this product 2 thumbs up !!</li>
    <li> Love love love.  Just as good as the more expensive one I had been using from QVC.  Would love to see this brand make a body butter also.  I am going to order more when I start to run low.  I have already started to spread the word.  I will also be trying the hair products.  I also appreciate the spray bottle top instead of the dropper the other product had.  The dropper was nice.  However, the spray top means less spillage.  More product for my skin to enjoy.  Thanks so much for this wonderful surprise!  I had tried an argan oil years ago that was so thick it wouldn&#x27;t spread on my skin.  Then weeks ago found the QVC one that I love, but could only afford a tiny bottle.  Now I can afford to really use yours.  I can even send some to my nearest and dearest a little at a time and share the wealth.  This means in the long run your sales should sky rocket!!!  And I am just one person.</li>
    <li> excellent oil!  using for skin and hair</li>
    <li> I love this oil. I had previously ordered a different brand of Argan Oil from Amazon a few months ago, but I prefer this one by Pura d&#x27;or for my skin. I still use the other oil for my hair occasionally, but this one is much better for my skin since it&#x27;s light and silky without a lot of heavy perfume in it. It has a light fragrance, but it&#x27;s hardly noticeable. I cleanse my face every night before bed and then apply 2-3 drops of this oil and gently massage it into the skin. It doesn&#x27;t make my face feel greasy at all. After a few minutes, my skin feels baby soft. It has not caused any blemishes (a minor miracle compared to other products I&#x27;ve tried), and in the morning my skin feels smooth and silky. I have not tried it under makeup because I tend to have oily skin, but I imagine someone with very dry skin could benefit from using this before  applying foundation. Regardless of whether you use it under makeup or before bed at night, I think the key is to use it sparingly. A little goes a long way. Also, this product is very reasonably priced compared to many other Argan oils on the market. I hope the company will keep the price affordable. If they do, I intend to purchase a lot more of this stuff. I can wholeheartedly recommend it.</li>
    <li> love the product. I used another brand that I use to buy from down to earth. This argan oil feels smoother and makes my skin glow.</li>
    <li> Started using this instead of all the other conditioner products on my hair.&lt;br /&gt;It is superb!!! No hair breakage, less scalp itch, and manageable hair...&lt;br /&gt;All in four little squirts in the palm of your hand!!!</li>
    <li> This oil is such a good moisturizer.  I use it at night since it is slow to absorb, but in the morning my face is so soft!!!</li>
    <li> I am close to 50 and have tried many face products over the last 5-7 years and I have found nothing even comparable to Pura d&#x27;or! It has diminished the lines around my eyes and mouth and makes my hands feel soft and young again. It also give my hair, which is colored, a soft healthy texture.  The fact that it&#x27;s mult-purpose makes it an excellent deal for me.  I&#x27;d highly recommend it to anyone who wants more supple and glowing skin!</li>
    <li> I have just recently started to use Argan Oil and initially I was using a much higher priced well-known brand. This argan oil is a fraction of the cost and just as effective if not more. I use this all over from my cuticles to my hair to my acne-prone skin. It&#x27;s so gentle and a little goes a long way. I will definitely buy my argan oil from this company from now on.</li>
    <li> Feel good on skin, not greasy.</li>
    <li> This is my first time trying Argon oil and I am very pleased choosing this product. First you get a rather large bottle for a great price and the packaging was impeccable. I was worried it would feel oily on my skin but it soaks in and leaves skin feeling smooth. I would purchase this product again.</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B004Z209HS Pura d&#x27;or 100% Pure &amp; USDA Organic Argan Oil (4 fl. oz.) For Face, Hair, Skin and Nails]][[ASIN:B004Z209HS Pura d&#x27;or 100% Pure &amp; USDA Organic Argan Oil (4 fl. oz.) For Face, Hair, Skin and Nails]]All I can say is Wow!!!! I just received 2 of these bottles today, and I tried right the away, it leaves my skin so silk and smooth. I have tried so many different brands, but this one it&#x27;s the real thing and does not have the strong nutty smell very light. I highly recommend to everyone \\&quot;Pura d&#x27;r\\&quot; I will not leave without it... Wonderful product. It&#x27;s for sure a five star rate.</li>
    <li> This is the best Argan oil product I have used so far. I like the fact it is organic and nourish my skin and hair. Just perfect!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for an all-natural skin moisturizer and this one goes above and beyond what I expected. The fact that this one organic is a definite plus, but it is the most amazing oil I&#x27;ve ever used! Beats coconut oil as a moisturizer hands down. I can put it on under my makeup and it&#x27;s not greasy or oily-looking. It makes my skin soft and young-looking. I&#x27;ve already noticed fine lines are minimized. I&#x27;ve also used this on my hair to make it shine, but it has the added benefit of calming the &#x27;frizzies&#x27;  and makes even those wild gray hairs behave. This Argan oil is a must-have.</li>
    <li> This is the very best thing I have ever used for my dry skin. It even healed a cold sore on my lip! I will never be without this product!!</li>
    <li> Very nice on skin!  Oil is very light and is absorbed by skin quickly with no greasiness.  My skin always feels very comfortable.  I have had some problems with acne, but after only two days of use my complexion has already improved.  I will continue to buy this product as it has become a &amp;#34;must have&amp;#34; for me.</li>
    <li> The oil is very light weight but it provides great moisturizing for the face without additional moisturizer. A few drops would be enough for the entire face. My skin feels soft after using this.</li>
    <li> It does as advertised! :) A bit expensive but I find myself very happy with this product and I&#x27;d recommend it for those who have dry, itchy skin and/or frizzy hair.</li>
    <li> I have used it for several times.Mostly I used it on my hair.It made my hair looks better.I like it.I think it&#x27;s a good product.</li>
    <li> Best product ever!&lt;br /&gt;I have been using the Argan oil on my face regularly for about a month and my skin is very soft and blemish free. I had been using various brands that claim to do it all for aging skin with no results. This is the best I&#x27;ve run across--ever!!&lt;br /&gt;I started using it on my arms and legs which were dry and flaky with good results also. The best thing about this product is that it works and is very reasonably priced!  Thank you for your Great product!  Grandmother of 10</li>
    <li> Great product for a great price!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used lot&#x27;s of other argan oils n haven&#x27;t found 1 yet that hasn&#x27;t made my hair look greasy. This has definitely made my skin n hair soft though! Maybe I just need to use little less on hair. My hair is really fine and long. But I have definitely noticed an amazing instant softness! I would def recommend this brand!</li>
    <li> feels soft but not greasy</li>
    <li> Works great! Moisturizes, neutral smell, clear color, very luxurious and does the trick. Only complaint is that I have oily skin and this usually leaves a very oily sheen on my skin - perhaps with the pump I&#x27;m using a little bit too much, but I would prefer if it would absorb better. Pump makes for easy use. Would recommend to a friend!</li>
    <li> I am so excited about the continued use of argan oil.  The oil feels so nourishing!  I make my own day &amp; night creams, and this oil is the base of the formula.  My face has never felt so soft and looked so healthy!  I will never run out of this!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The oil came packaged in a cotton drawstring pouch that I will use to store the bottle in.  And, too, I was happy to see that it comes in a glass bottle.  I will re-use the bottle for many other uses.  I will definitely order again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for such a wonderful product.</li>
    <li> Recently I feel my skin gets really dry and tight because of the season changing.  I was originally considering to order a bottle of E oil.  Then, after asking my friends opinions, I keep hearing from many of my friends recommend this product,respectively .  Based on their experience, Argan oil won&#x27;t clog the pores like the way E oil does and the skin can absorb it easily.  Thus, I ordered this product and gave it a try.  This organic Argan oil does help me moisturize and nourish my skin a lot.  It can be absorbed fast and it is not as thick as E oil, which I like.  I especially like it&#x27;s USDA certified organic.  I will definitely recommend this product to my mom and my friends~</li>
    <li> Great oil, this is actually my 2nd bottle,  makes my skin soft  .Love it. I definite will buy it again.</li>
    <li> I have been using this brand for a long time and it worked well for my skin. I always bought it from Groupon. Found a good deal on Amazon and decided to try it out. Honestly, I can&#x27;t say it&#x27;s the same product as the one I have been using. It made me breakout a lot every time I used it. It ended up in the trash. This purchase is a total waste.</li>
    <li> I am super  satisfied with the Pura d&#x27;or Argan oil.&lt;br /&gt;I am almost 50 and have a mixed discolored skin.At the beginning i was using it twice a day but that is too much for my skin.It took me some time to find the right amount needed to keep my skin moisturized. No one ever complimented my skin,but after i started using Pura D&#x27;Or i got complimented.&lt;br /&gt;I was in a company meeting one day when i got compliments on my skin.I started joking saying the secret is in the makeup.But than,they continued to say how my skin has a glow and how my entire complexion looks nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use it in the morning. After applying a gel moisturizer from Garnier i follow with the argan oil to lock the moisture and vitamins from the gel.It is not oily and leaves my skin soft and glowing. Every time i look in the mirror i am soo happy and so confident. But,my daughter does not like it,it seems that it makes her skin break out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An absolutely 5 star product,i highly recommend it and will buy again!!!</li>
    <li> Bought this item at amazon for my wife.  At first, I was hesitant to buy it because there were other less expensive argan oil products that were available.  So I read the reviews of Pura D&#x27;or and compared it with the other brands.  Basically the less expensive ones contained less argan oil having been diluted or mixed with other substances.  I eneded up buying it and my wife was highly satisfied with the results after comparing it with the other branded testers available at the mall.</li>
    <li> This is  a great moisturizer to use . I had dry hands and been using this since last spring and it really helped me keep my hands normal.&lt;br /&gt;Also, This produced is overpriced definetely.  Otherwise a great product.</li>
    <li> Positives: Excellent Oil for my scalp. Not heavy, not greasy, no bad odor, and I enjoy the spray. Negatives: Expensive.</li>
    <li> I like it. It makes my hair look healthy.</li>
    <li> This is an amazing product. I really use it for literally everything. Definitely recommend it! Thank you!</li>
    <li> This is the best Argan oil I&#x27;ve ever used. iTS AMAZING! I love how it makes my skin feel. I would recommend this product and I will reorder.</li>
    <li> I like it because I have sensitive skin and I have not had any allergic reactions from it.  Absorption is good, but it does seen to leave a slight oil feel behind that I did not feel with the other brand of Organic Argan Oil I use. Having said that, i do live in Florida</li>
    <li> I love Amazon dearly, but I haven&#x27;t written a product review in YEARS.  I have only had this product a week but I am obsessed with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a man and I have very straight, very fine, medium-length hair.  I have tried everything to achieve movie-star hair status.  (pomades made it greasy and stringy, gels and mousses dried it out and made it \\&quot;puffy\\&quot;).  I read all the awesome reviews and decided to give it a try.  My hair was 4-weeks post haircut and completely dried out and fried from the alcohol-based mousses I was using.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One drop of Argan oil changed my life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I shampooed my hair and added one drop, used a new non-alcohol based mousse, combed it into place, and waited for it to dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Needless to say, my hair was transformed.  It was smooth and silky, without being greasy. It was almost like it replaced the natural oils that had been missing from my head.  I had achieved Don Draper/George Clooney hair status!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am thrilled with this product...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TIPS:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-- Start with one drop.  A little goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-- I only wash my hair a couple days a week.  I simply rinse my hair and add more styling product.  The oil remains from the previous day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-- I just started using it on my skin and lips.  Since I don&#x27;t like to be without it, I bought a few of these inexpensive bottles ([[ASIN:B0054JDN8S Plain Roll-On Refillable Glass Perfume Bottle Purse or Travel Size]]), filled them with oil, and threw them in my gym bag and desk.  The roll-on allows for all-over, even application and dispenses the product very slowly.  i.e. If you need to smooth some flyaways, just roll it on two of your fingers and smooth your hair down.  That&#x27;s how little of this product you need.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of my favorite Amazon purchases ever!</li>
    <li> I have curly, frizzy hair and this is wonderful. I spray a few drops in my hand and distribute it through my hair. My hair is soft, manageable and just wonderful. Great for nails too!!!</li>
    <li> The quality of the oil seems to be very good, and seems comparable to the Josie Maran Argan oil that we have been using, but is far less expensive. It soaks into my beard and skin quickly without a greasy feeling. My wife uses it nightly as a face moisturizer before bed. She doesn&#x27;t mind the pump bottle, as she puts it on her fingers before applying it, but I would prefer a dropper style bottle so I can put it directly on my beard. Though for such a good value product, it would be easy to just transfer some to a smaller dropper bottle. This is really the only drawback... 4 1/2 stars. Very happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> For anybody who might balk at the price of this incredible product (really, I follow just about every 5-star review; it does everything I want it to do for my hair, face, and wherever else I wish to put it)... I bought my 4oz bottle in March 2013. It was about thirty bucks. I still have about a fifth of the bottle left. That&#x27;s a LOT! And that is INCREDIBLE lasting. The product stays good, and continues to do everything it says it does.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those wondering, I use about 5 pumps an average per day: 2 for my face in the morning, 2 for my face at night, and 2 for my hair when I wash it (every other day). I really don&#x27;t need to use that much on my face, but I always rub my hands through my hair afterwards anyways &#x3D;) I also will occasionally put some on my finger cuticles, and rub it on my hands. So I&#x27;ve probably used a lot more than it would seem like. It&#x27;s almost been a year, and I&#x27;m just now looking into buying bottle No. 2. Would definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> Product is nice, company who mailed it put their big promotional sticker all over the directions.</li>
    <li> I have only been using this product for a little over a week but it seems to be improving the look and feel of my skin. The small scars I have seem to be fading more quickly than usual and I&#x27;ve been putting it on an incision scar I have from a surgery a few months ago and it appears to also be fading. I&#x27;m not sure if it is clogging my pores but it doesn&#x27;t seem to be.&lt;br /&gt;The one thing I don&#x27;t like is that it doesn&#x27;t seem to absorb when applied to my face as quickly as other parts of my body. This may be due to my combination skin. I will continue to use it and update if there are any changes to report.</li>
    <li> Its totally worth it. I can see the results already.</li>
    <li> Product arrived on time. The product works really great. It gives my hair a brilliant shine and I&#x27;ve also used on my acne with really good results.</li>
    <li> Love the way this feels! Dries fast, no oily feeling!</li>
    <li> I love this product. It&#x27;s organic and I&#x27;m using for my face and hair almost every day.&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t smell any strong and after put on, it will be non fragrance....&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m very dry skin and have to have this....</li>
    <li> I can honestly say that I&#x27;m really pleased with this oil. It absorbs well. I wear it under my makeup and use a small amount on the ends of my hair before I blow-dry it.  It keeps the ends soft and shiny. Product shipped quickly and was well packaged. Great product!</li>
    <li> I love this Argan oil.  This oil is on the light side, you can really massage it in it doesn&#x27;t lay on the skin like coconut oil.  I have gotten so many compliments on  my skin since I started using it a few months ago.  I had a large scrape on my leg and after it scabbed over.  I started putting Argan oil on it and it healed so nicely with no scar.  I really like the pump dispenser, it gives you about a pea size of oil.  I would recommend this to everyone with dry to normal skin.</li>
    <li> I put this on my face just before the cream.  The results are amazing.  I use it under a tinted moisturizer and at night after cleansing.  Incredible results!</li>
    <li> Great product ... my hair and skin are very thankful .</li>
    <li> This oil is great for my hair and for my face.</li>
    <li> Makes my hair really soft when I use it as a leave in conditioner.  A little goes a long way.  Overuse will make hair look greasy.  I also use it as a body lotion in the winter and it really softens and moisturizes!  Love how I can use the same product for various purposes!</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with this purchase.  This argan oil is making a difference in the scars that I have left from an eczema like skin condition that I have had for over five years.  I had tried every kind of cream and serum and I still had thickened discolored skin on my hands and trunk.  After three days of using the Pura d&#x27;or Organic Argan Oil, the thickness has started diminishing greatly and I am excited to see what the difference will be in two or three weeks.  Thank you, Pura d&#x27;or!</li>
    <li> I LOVE this oil.  I have been using another popular brand that is much more expensive so i was thrilled when i found this!  I have noticed a difference in my skin already and I swear it heals and soothes my adult acne.  My teenage daughter also noticed it on the bathroom counter and started using it and her skin seems to be clearing up!  Thank you for this awesome product!</li>
    <li> Came in 2 days as expected. The argan oil feels great on my face, though I&#x27;ve not tried any other kinds, so I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s better or worse!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve mainly been using this to treat the dry ends of my hair. It works well to nourish my hair without feeling overly greasy.</li>
    <li> This product is fantastic. You must use the 100% pure Argan Oil for the best results. Other products on QVC are higher priced than this one. Been using on my face and hair and it is wonderful. My face is so soft in the morning after putting this on during the night.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this product highly. You will not be disappointed.  Most products do not have the 100% organic oil like this one...so buyers beware!</li>
    <li> Just started using this product. Feels light and grease free on the face. Works well under make up.</li>
    <li> My face and I love this organic Argan oil.  Highly recommend this.  I can&#x27;t remember how I came across Pura D&#x27;Or, but I&#x27;m sure glad I  did.  Thank you for a wonderful product.</li>
    <li> Wonderful oil.  Silky feel, soaks right in, immediate relief from dry, itchy, skin.  Works beautifully on face, cuticles, and a vey little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> I compared 1.7 oz. of Argan Oil mixed with other oils and ingredients for $25 to this product: 4 fl ozs of PURE Argan Oil for $27.44...you do the math!</li>
    <li> I got this during a groupon deal and my hair loves it. Im African American with thick curly hair that tends to dry fast, but I use this stuff daily to keep it soft and manageable. This is a great deal compared to Josie Maran who charges $90 for the same size. Worth a try you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> I love this. As a man I shower many times a day (about 3) and wash my hair at least 2 times. As a result I had dry hair. This solved that problem SO WELL without weighing down my hair. My hair feels amazingly soft and looks shiny without appearing greasy. I would recommend this to anyone with dry or dull hair. I just wish the price was a little lower...</li>
    <li> For some reason, in the last couple months I&#x27;d developed dandruff! I&#x27;ve NEVER had dandruff in my whole life! Then I started noticing maybe 2 or 3 little spots on my scalp that were like patches of crust or like a dried scab! Yuck! My hairdresser even noticed &amp; thought maybe she had caused it with the new developer she had used to dye my hair! She gave me a free hot-oil scalp treatment &amp; sent me home with a $50 set of Paul Mitchell Tea Tree oil shampoo &amp; conditioner! Of course none of that has worked! In fact it had gotten worse! I scrubbed my scalp when I washed &amp; the crusty bits came off but as I dried my hair &amp; was feeling around I noticed that those same patches were like damp &amp; all oozy with a clear liquid!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Desperate for a working solution, I asked another hair dresser friend &amp; she said I more than likely had a bad case of &amp;#34;seborrheic dermatitis&amp;#34; on my head! She recommended this stuff called Argan oil which I have never heard of! Now I&#x27;ve heard of tea tree oil, emu oil, even coconut oil as far as good things to use on your skin, but never this! Well I could kiss my friends feet! This product has been a miracle worker! It&#x27;s been two weeks now since applying just a couple drops on my head each night! It went away almost immediately, by the 2nd or 3rd time I washed my hair, those spots completely dried up, healed &amp; went away! I&#x27;m just now using it sparingly to keep it from EVER coming back! A little goes a long way! But I&#x27;m going to get some more for my &amp;#34;clueless&amp;#34; hairdresser to keep at her shop for any clients that might have similar issues with their scalp! She couldn&#x27;t believe how fast &amp; effective this argan oil was in clearing up my little problem with the ugly name! Urgh! No more &amp;#34;seborrheic dermatitus&amp;#34; for this girl!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank You Pura D&#x27;or for your wonderful product! I&#x27;m going to try &amp; use it on other parts of my skin just as a general moisturizer during these dry winter months that are sooo hard on my skin! If it could do that for my scalp then it&#x27;s going to work wonders on dry elbows, withered hands, ruff heals &amp; cracked knees, heck just dip me into a vat of this stuff &amp; call me beautiful because that&#x27;s how I feel! Baby soft &amp; smooth all over!uld do that for my scalp then it&#x27;s going to work wonders on dry elbows, withered hands, ruff heals &amp; cracked knees, heck just dip me into a vat of this stuff &amp; call me beautiful because that&#x27;s how I feel! Baby soft &amp; smooth all over!</li>
    <li> I have used so many products to nourish my hair and have been looking for the best organic product. I have tried other organic product such as the jojoba oil and I found that Pura D argan oil is the best. I have colored and damaged hair and using this as a leave in treatment makes my hair so soft. I have introduced this to my frds and they also love it so much.</li>
    <li> I love using different oils on my hair and body.  I recently bought and tried this oil with amazing results.  My frizzy hair is soft and silky and my complexion looks great. A little goes a long way with this oil which is great since the bottle is small. Definitely worth it. Will be my main go to oil from now on.</li>
    <li> I have straight, straight hair but I always have problems with flyaways.  I have to use a straight iron daily just to make it lay flat and look nice but I was getting tired of doing it all the time plus I&#x27;m worried about damaging my hair.  A friend told me about Pura D&#x27;or Argain oil so I decided to give it a try.  I was skeptical because she said I just need to use a few drops but I went ahead anyways.  All I can say is wow!, I cannot believe how fantastic this stuff works. My hair looks so sleek and has never felt healthier.  I&#x27;ve read that argan oil is also good for your skin so I think I&#x27;m going to give it go.  I&#x27;ll definitely be buying this again and again.</li>
    <li> I received a very generous amount of argan oil.  I had two other brands of argan oils at home so I did a comparison of Purador argan oil with Acure argan oil and Melvita argan oil.  I did a quick test the my skin of my hands; the Purador one seems to absorb a little easier into skin and is slightly richer than the other two.  There are no other significant differences on the skin.  In terms of packaging, Purador one is the only came in dark glass jar.  I haven&#x27;t read that argan oil is light sensitive and should be stored in dark places, but it is probably always a good idea.</li>
    <li> I received my order just a week ago and have been using it since but only on my face, so far so good, i like it. I have dark circle under my eyes and some age spots and that is the reason i wanted to try it out, let&#x27;see how it works.</li>
    <li> I have used a lot of over the counter beauty remedies from various department stores, and each of them has come up lacking in some way. I tend to stay away from oil based products because they make me feel greasy and I dislike how they clog up my pores. This oil is completely different. Not only does it absorb immediately, it leaves your skin feeling soft for the entire day. If you are looking for a natural moisturizer for your skin and hair, this will more than satisfy. I have been using it for a few days, and I have extremely sensitive skin. I haven&#x27;t noticed any kind of reaction thus far, and my skin looks clearer and smoother than it did before using this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have also been using it on my hair after getting out of the shower, and it tames the flyaways without making my hair look flat or oily. The Pura D&#x27;or oil has virtually no scent, so it doesn&#x27;t bother my sinuses and the pump bottle is convenient and easy to use. I am hooked. If you are someone who has issues with dark circles under their eyes, this will take care of that too. I spent fifty dollars on a commercial product earlier this year that promised the same, and after two weeks, saw no visible difference. I have only used this once for that purpose and woke up the next morning to pretty dramatic improvement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am really surprised by how much I love this!</li>
    <li> received as a free sample from the company&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was interested to try argan oil as I&#x27;d already purchased the skin cream while on holiday in Morocco and found it beneficial. (Argan trees are those ones you sometimes see goats climbing!)&lt;br /&gt;I did wonder how you&#x27;d pour out just the right amount of oil. And whether it wouldn&#x27;t be too greasy on skin. Well it comes in a handy little spray bottle, and as long as you don&#x27;t use more than you need (2 squirts is ample) it rubs in beautifully and leaves your skin feeling really smooth.&lt;br /&gt;As it was advertised as being good for hair and nails too, thought I&#x27;d give it a go as a hair conditioner. Would&#x27;ve appreciated some info on how much to use, whether to apply to dry or wet hair etc.&lt;br /&gt;Anyway I put a small amount on dry hair, focussing mainly on ends, left it 5 mins then shampooed out. I have dry frizzy hair and I have to say that once fully dried, it felt as if it had had a really good deep conditioning. As it&#x27;s not exactly cheap, I wouldn&#x27;t use it every time, but now and again will definitely enhance my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all a great produc</li>
    <li> I love this oil.  It is light and absorbs quickly into the skin and hair, yet non-greasy!  I love it!!!!</li>
    <li> Pura d or Argan Oil was best used as a mosturizer on my hands, body, and face. It&#x27;s non-greasy formula absorbs immediately.&lt;br /&gt;However, I found it was not as well absorbed when using in my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely worth the price for the product.</li>
    <li> Hi.. I feel now I can give my opinion an be honest on this produt because it&#x27;s been awhile now since I have used it  overall from the other argan oils that I have used I really do like this one it&#x27;s very smooth and light for oil it does have a bit of scent to it which is not bad at all I like the way my skin feels and looks  afterwards it&#x27;s not greasy at all I have  used some big names in argan oil it&#x27;s pricy as you know this its not a heavy oil and it&#x27;s like some of them out there and it&#x27;s reasonably priced so I can honesty say I would definetly purchase this again .. Very happy customer. Susan</li>
    <li> I purchased this item because Argan oil works wonders for my face.  I was using a different brand that was triple the price and had to use only on my face.  This brand works just as good as the expensive brand.  The great thing is now not only can I use on my face I can use on my hair, cuticles and add to my body lotion.  I have very sensitive skin and can not use a lot of beauty products.  This product helps with facial moisturizing, reducing oil production on my face and under eye dark circles and puffiness.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> this oil was good, I have dry skin and I use it on my face, but I actually like the way extra virgin olive oil feels more on my face especially during the winter months</li>
    <li> Love this product!  The girls at work made comments about my ratty hair. Ordered this and it completely changed every aspect of my locks!  I have some to my mom. She loves it too!  Arrived very fast and nicely packaged!  Would make a great gift!</li>
    <li> This Argon Oil is amazing...it hydrates both my face &amp; I use a little on my hair and it really makes it silky &amp; soft!&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this Argon Oil!</li>
    <li> It is a great product that my mom loves very much. During the past few years she has been using it to fight the wrinkles on her face.</li>
    <li> It is amazing oil, I heard a lot about Argan Oil, and I have been using  it for 10 days now and I can feel my skin get very clear, I had some irritation on my chin, it is gone within 4 days of using the oil on my face ... I am going to try the argan cream as well for anti age.</li>
    <li> I was so pleasantly surprised with this fabulous product.  I had been following an oil cleansing regimen for a while, and was choosing a new moisturizer since the cream I was using was just a bit too heavy.  I found this Pura d&#x27;or on Amazon and loved that it was certified organic.  It has been the best oil ever to use as a moisturizer on my face!  I wash my face either with oil or a very pure coconut cleanser, spray with a botanical face mist, pump 4 drops of oil in my hands and rub them together vigorously for a few seconds to warm the oil up and then just rub it in.  It feels great, light weight, and always pure and fragrance free.  I am so excited to find such a great product at a great price.  Love this stuff!</li>
    <li> I am 8 months pregnant and my skin got damaged from my pregnancy. My sister recommended Pura dor argan oil for my skin and this is my second bottle. I used this oil for my face, neck and body for extra moisture.  After using 2 weeks, I feels improvements in my skin. It keeps your skin soft and yet not sticky. It is well absorbed few seconds later you apply. It works well for preger!!</li>
    <li> Wonderful! Works well as face lotion and also works well for eczema</li>
    <li> I got a bottle of it about a month and a half, I take of my make up every night and put some Oil all over my face and neck. I have noticed that my skin is looking radiant, most of the brown spots I had are about 95 % gone, I also think that my skin feels firmer than ever. I love this product and I my plan is to use it for the rest of my life. I been asked about my friends about my skin and I told them all about this amazing product...</li>
    <li> I received mine about 2 weeks ago and have been using it every night since! I did a good bit of research about the health benefits this oil offers.... and this particular brand had the best reviews. This is my first time to ever buy Argan oil and I already love it!! I massage about 4-5 drops in my hair at night before I go to bed. It makes my hair extremely oily but it doesn&#x27;t bother me since I have to wash my hair daily anyway (I have really oily hair and skin). After applying the oil I used a comb to make sure it was evenly distributed. I put it up in a bun and left it over night. The next morning I rinsed, washed my hair, and blew it dry like normal. I didn&#x27;t do anything different from my normal routine, except use the oil. I was AMAZED when I started drying my hair... it gave me so much volume! You would think it would make your hair flat since it is pretty thick... but it gave my hair so much body and shine. My hair is naturally straight and flat... and this worked wonders for me!!! A little goes a long way- so use it sparingly! I was hesitant to use it on my face... however I decided to try it. It was so moisturizing and really hydrated my skin! I will definitely be purchasing another bottle when mine runs out!!!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product the past few weeks for my skin and nails, paying extra attention to my hands (winter season here). Great for sensitive skin. Works nicely. Originally, I had Nume&#x27;s &amp;#34;Argan Oil&amp;#34; and later noticed Argan oil was the SIXTH ingredient - so i searched for pure Argan Oil and discovered this. Overall, would by again.</li>
    <li> Order was placed on a Thursday and received ( via prime ) the following day. Very nice product. It re-hydrated my skin wonderfully, yet was not oily.</li>
    <li> Once I received the bottle, I immediately spread it over my entire body (probably took about 6 pumps) and put 3 pumps of the product in my hair. The next morning, I woke up feeling as soft and pretty as a button, with no stains on my clothing or sheets. The oil quickly absorbed into my skin in about 5 minutes, and left a light nutty, earthy scent that is hard to describe. I will update my review as I discern this products&#x27; long term benefits, but everything looks great so far!</li>
    <li> Fast delivery and as promised</li>
    <li> Nice smell.  Not greasy feeling.  I&#x27;m excited to see how this works as my daily skin moisturizer.  I think it will be nice to put on something simple and organic, rather than using lotion that contains tons of chemicals.  :D  This bottle was way bigger than I expected - this will last a long time!</li>
    <li> I have used this twice and I can see a major difference! My hair is extremely dry, fragile and I clogged up the shower drain every time. I put it on at the root line in areas needed after washing and before blow drying, I leave it on. It goes on clean and feels clean, no oiliness at all. It smells and feels fresh, using it this way also results in the product providing thickness and root boost for styling. My hair style looks better and more voluminous. I love this product and it will be a staple for me. It is hands down the absolute best, most effective, most immediate improvement in my scalp and hair condition I&#x27;ve ever experienced.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The second thing that surprised me was how easy it rinsed clean from my hair! This one was hydrating and smoothing, but rinsed so easily from my hair! There was practically no residue, even before i shampoo&#x27;d! I really recommend this product.</li>
    <li> i bought this item today i started applying to my skin and i can difference immediately it adds glow to your face and make soft</li>
    <li> My husband is using this on his face, neck, and back for dry winter skin.  His skin is so soft and smooth, and no longer itchy!  This oil has a mild, pleasant scent, which is a plus.  Great product!!</li>
    <li> hi this oil was really good and very healthy for our hair</li>
    <li> I was buying the argan oil sold on one of those cable shopping shows. It was A LOT more expensive so I thought I would give this a try. I am glad I did. The same size bottle is about $60 cheaper. Not only that I can&#x27;t tell the difference. This stuff is great. You can use it on your face,hair,nails. Everywhere. I will keep buying.</li>
    <li> This is a great oil I use on my face. I have oily acne prone skin so I use a lot of harsh products on my skin. I use this at night with a Vitamin C serum and it makes my skin feel very smooth, moisturized and even toned in the morning. It is an essential in my routine that helps give my skin some balance and recover at night. It also is a great value for the price compared to other products and lasts me at least four months.</li>
    <li> Liked the Argan oil. It really nourish skin and make skin supple soft</li>
    <li> First found Argan Oil on a trip to Morocco, loved it. When I ran out was really worried, so glad I found Pura d or at Amazon, great price. I use as a makeup remover, just tissue off and cold washcloth. I&#x27;m 74 and have perfect completion and very few wrinkles. I use no other products on face, just tried on my hair today, WOW!</li>
    <li> Fantastic argan oil for the price--and I&#x27;ve used several of the higher end brands which perform just as well. Look no further and just get it. This is actually just what you need to combat the dry, harsh winter weather</li>
    <li> I received it couple days ago. Fast shipping,  Accurate item.It smell is good. I can&#x27;t wait to see the result.</li>
    <li> I have only been using this oil for a short period of time. So far I have noticed that it goes on like any other oil but within just a few short minutes it completely is absorbed. No greasy or slick feeling. Been using as a moisturizer at night and morning. Seems to also be very good quality and consistency. I will purchase again.</li>
    <li> I decided to try argan oil after hearing so much about its benefits to the hair. I am so glad that I chose the Pura d&#x27;or brand because it is 100% organic and pure - it absorbs beautifully on the skin!  I ordered it on Friday and received the product on Monday, so the fast delivery was impressive. When I put the oil on my skin it was absorbed instantly, almost like the way an essential oil absorbs into the skin, but leaving only a silky smooth finish, not oily. Although I brought the oil for my hair, I was very impressed by the way it made my face feel. I will definitely be using it as a face moisturizer. I also added some to my hair condition and was amazed at how it made my hair instantly soft. I know that the argan oil made the difference because I had not had the same results prior to mixing the oil with the conditioner.  The oil enabled me to detangle my thick, curse, tightly coiled hair using my fingertips. I love this oil and will continue to use it as a all-in-one beauty product.</li>
    <li> Great product.  I loved it.</li>
    <li> Absolutely great for dry hair and skin</li>
    <li> I am a 71 year old woman.  I haven&#x27;t been happy with my skin for about a decade.  I&#x27;ve been using this product for maybe 5 or 6 weeks now and it&#x27;s made a great improvement in my skin.  I&#x27;m receiving compliments all the time from family and friends.  I couldn&#x27;t be happier.  Thank you for making such a fine product.  I will continue to use this and recommend to everyone.</li>
    <li> The price is good. I used to get Argan oil from Cellbone website but this one is more affordable and seems to have high quality ingredients. I apply it to my hair and i like that it is not greasy.</li>
    <li> I was recently given this product as a gift.  As a massage therapist I am familiar with different oils.  Personally, I have used Nerium AD and also use vitamin E oil on my face.  I love how this oil feels when I put it on.  My skin absorbs it well and it doesn&#x27;t have a sticky or thick consistency.  I love that the oil is 100% pure and organic. I look forward to continued use of this product and grateful that it was gifted to me.  I see oncology clients and will also consider keeping a supply in my clinic for use with them.&lt;br /&gt;Maddy&lt;br /&gt;Antelope California</li>
    <li> After using for about 2 month, I could see visible difference. Thank you for the excellent product.</li>
    <li> I ordered this oil based on all the good reviews and I wasn&#x27;t disappointed, in fact I am getting another bottle because the first is almost gone after twice daily applications of 3-4 squirts each.  I need that much to make my skin feel totally hydrated.  The oil is easily absorbed, and any extra on the palms of my hands I put through my wet hair and it works as an anti-frizzifier!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great product, absolutely no weird reaction with skin.</li>
    <li> I luv this oil! i can use it for so many things : on my hair , face, nail... Anywhere on your body...i know it may a little bit expensive, but it’s very worth it and replaces a lot of other beauty items. It smells like downright luxury and feels incredible! I have a dry skin type and curly hair , it&#x27;s done marvelous jobs for both: I prefer to apply the oil directly to my face as serum at night ,  I can feel it soaks into skin really fast, with no greasy after-feel, but only leave my skin radiant and soft;  i have long, dry hair, it makes my hair look very shiny and healthy, and also moisturizes it throughout the day !!&lt;br /&gt;Great product overall and I will definitely recommend it especially for the fall/winter season.</li>
    <li> This is all-natural, organic, pure argan oil at a much more reasonable price than those found in beauty stores. I use this product the night before washing my hair. Since using it, my hair is fuller and stronger, and I am seeing a noticeable decrease in shedding.</li>
    <li> If you want a natural product that absorbs instantly, has a variety of uses (hair, skin, nails) and is more cost efficient than the Josie Maran line, you have FOUND IT HERE my friend. I am a firm believer in aging &amp;#34;gracefully.&amp;#34; We don&#x27;t need multi step skin regimens to look beautiful, we need moisture. This does it. I use coconut and olive oils for an all over moisturizer, but I prefer this for my face and neck as it leaves a glow and sinks in to the skin beautifully. I will continue to use this product for as long as it is available. I also like the pump that comes with it rather than a dropper because I found i overused the product when squeezed out of a dropper; wasting it felt like throwing money away. Lastly, if this is your first time using it, don&#x27;t put it on wet hair like I did. I have lots of fine pale hair and it looked greasy. It&#x27;s fabulous for adding shine and smoothness after you blow dry. A little goes a LONG way.</li>
    <li> I am an aesthetician and I have tried numerous different brands of face products ranging from washes to serums, and this is by far the best product I have ever used!  My skin has never looked so good and felt so soft!  I am recommending this product to all of my friends, family and clients!!</li>
    <li> This is a an awesome product.  I color my hair and it&#x27;s usually dry and dull.  Just one &amp;#34;pump&amp;#34; of this oil before drying my hair makes it soft and shiny.  I&#x27;ve been using it for several weeks and can tell a big difference in my hair. Thank you Pura d&#x27;or !!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a first-time user of this product, and already am in love! It goes in my wet hair then even my ends stay silky all day long. A little goes a long way, though -  just a few drops and you&#x27;re good to go.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. Use it on my skin and hair everyday. Lasts a long time.</li>
    <li> Reduced dryness, fine lines and my skin has not looked this good for a long time! Really glad I got this!</li>
    <li> I have dry thick curly hair and Pura D&#x27;or&#x27;s argan oil has been perfect!  It is light and smells great. I have to be careful not to use too much, a little goes along way.  Leave my hair shiny, manageable and controls frizz. It seems to have improved my hair even on days that I don&#x27;t use it.  I have just recently seen other uses -- for skin, nails, etc... can&#x27;t wait to try it!</li>
    <li> I have used other argan oils and have found this to be a superior product. I&#x27;ve gotten several compliments on my skin since using it on my face daily. It can also be used on the hair and nails. Imported from Morocco, this \\&quot;liquid gold\\&quot; is rich in antioxidants, Vitamins A and E, Omegas 3 and 6, carotene, phenolic acid, amino acids, plant sterols and more. I have noticed more youthful and healthy skin since using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Susan Schenck, author of The Live Food Factor: The Comprehensive Guide to the Ultimate Diet for Body, Mind, Spirit &amp; Planet&lt;br /&gt;and&lt;br /&gt;Beyond Broccoli, Creating a Biologically Balanced Diet When a Vegetarian Diet Doesn&#x27;t Work</li>
    <li> My skin just drinks this stuff up! I keep a bottle at my desk. Use it instead of hand lotion.</li>
    <li> I have one small bottle of argan oil bought from Morocco, &amp; I like it so much. I am glad to find this one bought from amazon feels the same. It is a big bottle &amp; I now use it for my face, neck, hand and hair. No other products can beat.</li>
    <li> Fast Shipping, and Great quality.&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this oil for 3 days,&lt;br /&gt;and surprised with people around me noticing my skin change.&lt;br /&gt;Great Oil ever with resonable price.</li>
    <li> Great product!  I started with the smaller 1 oz to make sure I like it and just bought the larger size because I use it so often.</li>
    <li> pura d&#x27;or argan oil is a great product. It is very light and you only need a very small amount when you use it on you face, hair or nails. I have used it on my face and it quickly seeps into your skin and makes your skin feel like velvet. When you use it on your hair you also only need a very small amount unlike other argan oil products. Your hair blow dry&#x27;s quicker than normal too!!</li>
    <li> The best product I have found for skin care is 100% Pure Argan Oil.  I use is right after showering finding it soaks into the skin quickly leaving no oily feel.  It has corrected skin problems especially noted hands, cuticles and overall dryness.  This Pura d&#x27;or bottle is very convenient with the spray type cap.  There is so much waist of product with the dropper style.  Also, the product arrived very quickly.  I was surprised.  The cost is less than other places I have purchased the product in the past. I&#x27;m very pleased.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product on my neck and face daily for the past year. I truly believe there is a noticeable difference in the smoothness of both! I have worried about getting a &amp;#34;turkey neck&amp;#34; as I age and I can say that the Argan oil has warded off the years and helped me to avoid any unnecessary aging! I love this product and will continue to use it for the rest of my life!</li>
    <li> This oil soo good.. It&#x27;s the best oil I used ever.</li>
    <li> Best on the skin of any oil tried.</li>
    <li> My first bottle of argan oil, so I can&#x27;t talk about other brands. However, I&#x27;m pretty happy with my purchase. it works quite well on my hair, which is long, fairly thick and somewhat damaged on the ends from previous coloring. One or two squirts is all you need, or else your hair ends up looking greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also make my own face oil, and added a couple squirts into my mix. Made it a bit thicker, which is great for my dry skin. It absorbs quickly and leaves a nice little sheen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The oil doesn&#x27;t have a strong smell (although I&#x27;ve got a pretty weak smeller), so it&#x27;s great for blending with essential oils. I especially like the bottle design -- each squirt is just enough, since a little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> I love this argan oil! I use it everyday on my face, and put it on my hair after each shampoo (once it&#x27;s dried). A little goes a long way - (usually one drop is enough for my hair), and the best part is it adds moisture without being greasy, tames away flyaways, and makes my hair look shiny and not oily! Love it, and love how easy it is to dispense too!</li>
    <li> I noticed a huge difference in the texture of my hair, it was much easier to comb and work through. I think for the price and value it is worth it.</li>
    <li> I LOVE THIS! I use this oil on my face every night after washing it with my Clarisonic. I just moved to Arizona and my skin was breaking out due to it&#x27;s dryness and the over production of oil in order to fight the dry climate. Since I&#x27;ve been using this oil my skin has felt like magic! I wake up in the morning and it feels like new. I would highly recommend this to anyone with dry skin, it works wonders!</li>
    <li> This argan oil is by far the best I have found.  I purchase this regularly &amp; use it for many purposes.  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Love it. I love that even though it is an oil it absorbs quickly into your skin and leaves a silky soft skin afterwards. I use it in the mornings after showering in my arms, hands and legs. Feels so silky it&#x27;s heavenly. Loooove :-)</li>
    <li> It made my skin so smooth and healthy. I use it everyday to help my skin better.There&#x27;s no smell and it does not leave an oily residue. Those who have skin problem and hair loss should try this..it leaves your hair and skin smooth after consecutive uses.</li>
    <li> this is sooo goood. One must have if you want softer ,smoother and younger looking skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Who ever ready my comment plz visit the link below.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;http://rewardgalaxy.com/?ref&#x3D;710655</li>
    <li> I have been using Argon Oil for a couple of years, so I know the benefits. Soft skin, shiny hair and just a great moisturizer. I think so far, this is my best purchase. For sure, it is the best price. My last purchase was the same price for only 2 oz. This is the first bottle I used without a dropper. I do prefer the pump Pura d&#x27; or uses. The oil seems to be just as top grade as the others I have purchased. My skin seems to drink it up and stays hydrated. Great purchase!</li>
    <li> I have purchases this brand many times and I am completely satisfied with it. Leaves my skin soft and radiant and has never clogged my pores. I will keep purchasing this brand in the future.</li>
    <li> This is the second bottle I have purchased of this particular argan oil. I am in love with this product. I use it daily in my hair after showering, and I use it as face moisturizer morning and night. I also periodically use it on my nail cuticles.  It is such a versatile product that is pure and without any fillers or harsh chemicals. And it works WONDERFULLY. I highly recommend this product for so many skin and hair needs.</li>
    <li> I have tried a variety of Argan oils and Pura d&#x27;or is wonderful! Light, no odor and absorbs quickly. I would recommend this to anyone who wants to try using Argan Oil. I use it daily as a face moisturizer and my skin is the best it has been in years.</li>
    <li> I have damaged hair scalp. I apply this oil on my hair. And,this oil works great for my hair. My damaged hair scalp becomes better.</li>
    <li> I have tried many types of conditioner and shampoo but nothing came close to what this oil did to my hair. My hair was dry and frizzy. It tends to get knotted up very easily making it difficult to style in the morning.  I read about how Argan oil can do to make hair soft and shiny but was reluctant to try because it was either too expensive or not pure or had a &#x27;funny&amp;#34; smell to it.&lt;br /&gt;After reading many good reviews about this oil I decided to give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;I must say it did wonders to my hair! With just a few applications of this oil, my hair now feels soft and silky. You just need a small pea size of this oil! Will be buying more of this for sure!</li>
    <li> This product is amazing! I am on my sixth bottle already. When I first got it I couldn&#x27;t wait to try it. I waited for Friday evening because I was afraid it might have some side effects like the enriched uranium I ordered last month. So on Friday night after nice and long shower I decided to test it. I scrubbed my face with one of those electric face scrubbers...boy did that hurt...after the bleeding has stopped I poured the contents in a small cup and drank it. Just like you would drink tequila.  The taste wasn&#x27;t quite like tequila (I never thought of mixing it together), it was very nutty. There were no imidiate results, other than very loud gurgling in my stomach,  but that was most likely from Taco Bell lunch earlier that day. The next day I woke up dizzy and feeling sick. Going out on Friday night and drinking heavily might have been the cause. But, while at the bar all the ladies were staring at my face and few even comented on it. The scars from the electric face brush were quite visible, but healing just fine. Anyways...Saturday morning, around 3pm, I woke up and went to the bathroom to do #2....and that is when I noticed the amazing results.  The poop came out with no effort.  The oil from the bottle polished the poop to the extent where I didn&#x27;t even have to wipe, and I&#x27;m a heavy triple ply wiper.&lt;br /&gt;I highly reccomend this product!&lt;br /&gt;P.S. my scars have almost healed.</li>
    <li> This came quickly.  I was using a much more expensive brand. This works just as well.  I use it to lessen scars and moisturize.  It goes on and absorbs within a few minutes. So far very happy with this purchase and love the lower price!</li>
    <li> Amazing! My face was stinging from a retinal product and I put a small amount on my face and within about 20 minutes my face was not stinging and felt baby smooth. I am a convert. Can&#x27;t wait to try it on my hair before flat ironing.</li>
    <li> I love this oil! I use it every night as a serum on my face. It&#x27;s a great moisturizer and leaves my skin feeling hydrated, soft and glowing. I also use a small amount on my hair. It&#x27;s great as a serum to de-frizz and add shine. I love that it is pure (beware of other brand that add other chemicals) and organic. I will definitely purchase this brand again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using josie maran&#x27;s argan oil for about two years, love the result but always looking for a cheaper alternative. Pura d&#x27;or argan oil give me the same result with cheaper price. I like it. My skin felt really soft the next morning after the night I applied it, and I also like to use it on my hair because blow drying.</li>
    <li> One of the best products I have ever tried. Works beautifully for my skin because its ORGANIC and will buy again!!!</li>
    <li> Had been looking for pure Argan oil and was so excited that I found it on Amazon. It feels so good on my skin. A little oily when you first apply it but penetrates the skin wonderfully. Love the price also......</li>
    <li> A friend gave me this to try on my dry skin.  Loved in and ordered it the next day.  She said she puts it on everything - face, baby etc etc.  Great product.</li>
    <li> My damaged hair drinks this stuff! It has greatly improved the dry brittle texture of my color damaged hair</li>
    <li> Very fast shipping. I&#x27;m very impress. High quality product.BEST PACKING I ever seen. Highly recommended!!!! I LOVE IT</li>
    <li> This oil is the most amazing that I&#x27;ve ever tried, really! My hands are always super dry, and when I put this oil on them, it&#x27;s like magic happens. They feel as soft as a baby.</li>
    <li> I am a woman who uses oils for years in my beauty routine (and my husband knows that very well :)) I have many kinds of oils on my shelf))  I know the consistency of all of them. And I can say for sure that this Organic Argan Oil is a healer. This is the greatest and lightest oil that I have ever used.  I use it for skin around eyes, face, eyelashes and eyebrows, on dry hands, nails and hair (dry or wet) and I don’t feel it heavy or sticky on my skin after use. It gives me: shiny hair, strong nails, it reduces deep wrinkles around my eyes. My hands are soft, eyelashes and eyebrows are “full”.  It is non-greasy, like other oils. That’s the only one oil that permits me to use it in so many ways.  It doesn&#x27;t even have an oil smell. This oil from glass bottle is high purity product, and it is extremely effective in all ways of use.  It is my favorite ever.  And, honestly, I say that from my experience. This oil definitely is worth trying, to then become your favorite one.</li>
    <li> I have used my first botttle already in less than a month and getting ready to order another one from amazon. This is the best moisturizing product I have ever used and I have tried lots of other moisturizer but this one is my favorite. I recommeded my sister to buy this product. My family love using this product too. I am very happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> did its job, used it on my face for healing and its done wonders. im a skeptical person when it comes down to products. this product heal my acne scars. love it!</li>
    <li> I started using Pura d&#x27;or about a month ago and have noticed my facial complexion improving and looking radiant and younger for a 50 year old woman.  I feel my skin very smooth and even age spots clearing, very glad of my recent Argan oil discovery and this organic brand.  I have now recommended this wonderful Argan Oil to friends and have bought another bottle as a present with the next one for my mother.</li>
    <li> Love this! It not only makes my skin soft but it also has helped clear up my acne! I cannot live without this product! It really is amazing!</li>
    <li> This is a great product. It is the only moisturizer I use for my face now. For a long time, I struggled with oily, acne prone skin and tried numerous products with varying results. In the past year, I have been experimenting with more natural methods and products, figuring that the chemicals in commercial products aren&#x27;t helping my skin problems. I decided to take the plunge and forgo cleansers and regular moisturizers altogether. After a transition period, my skin is no longer oily. I use the Argan oil to moisturize my face after washing with water. A little goes a very long way. It moisturizes really well and does not feel greasy afterwards like some other natural oils do. I have not had any breakouts since, and I&#x27;m very pleased with my new and simple regimen! The price for volume is also a great deal compared to other brands. So, I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Just as good as Moroccan oil for your hair without all the additives!  I love using it on my hair, face and skin. Multi use, reasonable price and amazing results. Very happy.</li>
    <li> I clean houses and my skin suffers such dryness. I heard about argan oil how good is was for helping your skin .&lt;br /&gt;So my bottle arrived and I started from my head to my toes. I was amazed how is saturated my skin. It  added shine to my dry brittle hair. I liked it because it did not feel sticky on my skin. I would recommend this oil especially since winter is approaching which causes more dry skin.</li>
    <li> I love this product! My second time buying it because I had to give the first one to mother since she loved it so much. I think I&#x27;ll continue to use this product for a long period of time. Unlike other oils, this oil gets absorbed pretty quickly and leaves your hands oil-free just after a few minutes of massaging. I also checked it my friends  who are natives of Morocco and they approve its authenticity. I recommend it for people of all ages!</li>
    <li> I already have the Pura D&#x27;or shampoo and people have been complimenting me on my hair. After hearing good things about the oil, I gave it a try. I really like it. It especially helps my wrinkly chest area. The oil soaks in and disappears .Leaves a nice, soft feel. No oily residue leftover.</li>
    <li> i use this product every morning on my face and hair and it works great</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Argan Oil for a couple of years now.  I decided to give this brand a try, due to the amount of positive reviews.  BIG BIG BIGGEST MISTAKE! This brand smells very different. It feels very different, heavy and it doesn&#x27;t absorb like the other brands I&#x27;ve tried.  It also made my face break out- I had red bumps on my face and they were very itchy!!! This brand never made my skin look or feel any better. I am so disappointed I strayed away from my usual brand--Elma &amp; Sana.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m experiencing for the first time in my life in my late 50 dry spots on skin like on elbow, feet, etc.&lt;br /&gt;Elbow was fixed with four or five applications. Feet were better too but while the elbow remain good stopping the treatment, the feet didn&#x27;t. So I guess feet must be treated constantly even if less frequently.</li>
    <li> I use 3/4 of a squirt with my leave in conditioner everyday.  It does not make my hair greasy at all.  If I pump too much into my hand and try to mix it my hair will feel a little greasy.  Used in moderation this product is wonderful.  Your hair will feel much softer and healthier!</li>
    <li> My skin laughs with happiness every time I use it. Finishing my first bottle, ordered two more. I recommend it to all my friends. When you wash your face, apply this on wet skin and lightly towel off after a few seconds. I have a normal skin, neither oily not dry. The oil never leaves a heavy or oily feeling, just a soft feeling on my skin.</li>
    <li> This Argan Oil is fantastic! It strengthen my hair tip. No fragrance at all, its also cheaper compared to other brands.</li>
    <li> Does not seem to work for my face.  Changed it from smooth and supple to dry and bumpy.  Purpose of purchase to help with the wrinkles one acquires by age 68 and radiation from breast cancer.</li>
    <li> I stopped buying mainstream skin cream years ago: I didn&#x27;t want to put chemicals in my skin and neither did I want to pay someone exorbitant prices for doing so! Now I make my own creams, use Castor Oil, and occasionally buy some shea butter or something else completely natural. My litmus test for a face cream is whether or not it irritates my eyes when/if it gets in-- the older I get, the more sensitive my eyes seem to be to chemicals (no mascara found yet that works for me). And Pura D&#x27;or definitely does not irritate! It&#x27;s a fabulous light oil that my skin readily absorbs and feels great on. Ditto other reviewers-- a little goes a long way. I would recommend this brand without reservation to anyone. And for what you get in terms of quality and quantity, the price is good!</li>
    <li> I want to start off by saying that I used the Josie maran argan oil for about two months and I didn&#x27;t want to spend so much money on the full size so I researched and found that this was a good replacement. I have been using this for a month now and I can totally see a difference. My nails have been breaking like crazy and I was getting so frustrated so I took a couple drops and massaged it into my cuticles and nail bed. Then I left it overnight and the next morning I could tell my nails looked better though they hadn&#x27;t mysteriously become perfect. So I repeated it for the next couple of days and by the end of the week I noticed that my nails were much shinier. They started to grow pretty evenly and the breakage stopped. The surrounding areas on my nails were also less dry and I didn&#x27;t have to even trim my cuticles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also used this on my hair because it is chemically treated. About once a week I do a deep treatment where I just massage the oil into the ends of my hair and put the rest on my scalp. I leave it on overnight and wash my hair in the morning. It has made my hair much much softer and shinier. I can wear my hair naturally a lot more now than before. I also put a couple drops in my hair serums or anti frizz creams and it doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down. This oil is working great so far and the price is reasonable. I would definitely recommend it to anyone looking for argan oil.</li>
    <li> Great Oil! Very Light, I only use a little bit and it does a good job of moisturizing and leaves no buildup. Will purchase again when it runs out.</li>
    <li> I bought this to use for oil cleansing method and to use as a daily moisturizer.  I absolutely love it!  Perfect for my combination skin.  Very gentle and moisturizing.  For my daily moisturizer I use 2 parts Pura d&#x27;or argan oil, 1 part rosehip seed oil, and a few drops of carrot seed essential oil.  Has really minimized the fine lines around my eyes.  I have recently been getting a lot of compliments about how good my skin looks.  This product is a big part of the reason.  Definitely going to repurchase!</li>
    <li> Been using it for 3weeks and haven&#x27;t noticed anything so far</li>
    <li> This product works just as well as other Argan oil that sells for about twice the price.</li>
    <li> I was happy with the product and my hair does feel better, less frizzy.</li>
    <li> This exactly what I was looking for. I use the Argan Oil on my face, neck, hands and hair for a shinning look. I love it ! I would definitely recommend it to my friends.</li>
    <li> I used to use Josie Maran&#x27;s after getting it for Christmas fro my sister but its tiny bottle lasted me 2 months. When I looked into getting a new one, I was shocked at the price. I did some searching on Amazon and found this one. I purchased this over a year ago and I use it twice a day: morning and day. I still have 1/3 of the bottle left.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I mix a little squirt of it into my regular moisturizing cream and my skin feels amazing! And I live in a very dry and often times windy climate. I also got my sister converted and she switched from Josie Maran&#x27;s to this one.</li>
    <li> I needed a product to moisturize my skin that wasn&#x27;t a lotion.  My skin&#x27;s grown very sensitive lately, and I wanted to keep it as simple as possible.  I&#x27;d tried castor oil, but that stuff is SO THICK.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This argan oil really did the trick!  I put it on when I&#x27;d put a lotion on:  in the morning and before bed.  It&#x27;s very silky and it has a nice, refreshing clean smell.  In a couple weeks, I noticed a real improvement with my skin tone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing is, it&#x27;s kind of expensive, so I&#x27;ve taken to mixing it with either castor or jojoba oil to stretch it out a bit.  Also, the pump is extra sensitive - it&#x27;s hard to just get half a pump, it wants to jump all the way down at the slightest pressure.  Better than a dropper, though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have the money to spend, I highly recommend this oil.  My skin is soft, even-toned, and it soaks in quickly enough not to leave it feeling oily (especially when mixed with jojoba).  Miles better than greasy lotions!</li>
    <li> This is my second purchase of Pura D&#x27;or Argan Oil and I absolutely love it!  Totally 5 stars!  I have the  4 oz and it lasts a long time.  My daughter told me her hair dresser recommended Pura D&#x27;or Argan Oil for her hair.  She highlights her hair and it was starting to get dry and brittle from the processing.  She was thrilled with how just a few drops made her hair soft and shiny without weighing it down.  So I thought I would try it since my hair is also highlighted.  I did a lot of research before my first purchase and found Pura D&#x27;or Argan Oil had the best reviews and best value for the money.  I love the fact that it is organic and doesn&#x27;t have any filler ingredients. Now I have very fine mostly straight hair so I have always been cautious regarding oily products in my hair.  However, Pura D&#x27;or Argan Oil does not weigh my hair down at all.  Just a few drops in the palm of my hand and then I lightly apply to my hair, especially the ends.  It looks shiny, full and controls any frizzy or flyaway hairs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also love to use it on my face and neck.  It is a wonderful moisturizer!  I put it on in the evening as well as in the morning after washing my face.  It&#x27;s light, doesn&#x27;t look greasy, and makes my skin look soft and supple.  It absorbs well and does not irritate my skin as some other night creams occasionally do.  After I apply it to my face or hair, I just rub the rest into my nails, this keeps them looking healthy and allows them to grow longer without breaking or splitting.  Just like the bottle says it&#x27;s the perfect must have item for hair, skin and nails!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I always receive my package quickly and will continue to order it through Amazon.</li>
    <li> I used this as moisturizer while I was traveling in the Moroccan desert and it really works well! Moisturizes well and doesn&#x27;t make my skin too oily.</li>
    <li> I have thoracic-spine length hair, baby fine, straight, and two drops will do my whole head.  Anything more (yes, even just three drops total) and I look like I didn&#x27;t even shower.  I put it in while my hair is wet, head to school, and fluff my hair as it dries once I get there.  It feels &amp;#34;dry&amp;#34; when you&#x27;re rubbing it between your palms before putting it in your hair, almost waxy, but it doesn&#x27;t dull my hair or leave it sticky.</li>
    <li> Every winter I seem to forget that when my skin gets dry, I get zits. The best solution I&#x27;ve ever found to this problem is to cleanse and moisturize my skin with oil. This stuff really does the trick- just put one pump of it on a cotton pad and gently wipe it over my face. It cleans out the blackheads, helps the zits heal, and makes my skin look and feel healthy and dewy.  Love it!</li>
    <li> What not to like, it is pure and organic. At this price I used it from my head to the toe. Love it.</li>
    <li> I bought this having used other argan oils in the past, hoping to clear up the extremely dry winter skin I was experiencing on my face. Unfortunately, It has not made much of a difference. However, I can testify that it has not aggravated my acne at all, and absorbs quickly. You definitely don&#x27;t have to worry about it making your skin oily!</li>
    <li> Excellent everything they say and more you will love it too add it to your homemade shampoo, soap, lotion and more</li>
    <li> I love my argan oil. I&#x27;m using it on my face at night before I go to bed. I have very thirsty skin. Now and then I also put some on my scalp and then wash it off in the morning. It has a very faint smell- nothing memorable or bothersome. Note that this is a pump not a spray.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s really good for the face and skin!!! I tried on my hair and didn&#x27;t like at all! It leaves the hair very greasy and dirty looking! But I can tell that it is really good for the face and body skin!</li>
    <li> I was so happy with this product that I ordered it a second time.  It does not have a strong oder like many others plus knowing it is organic makes me feel good.  I use it on my face, neck and hair and am extremely satisfied.  Keep up the good work Pura D&#x27;or</li>
    <li> hmmmmmm.. I just don&#x27;t see the &amp;#34;magic&amp;#34; everyone is talking about. It doesn&#x27;t improve my hair/skin at all.</li>
    <li> This Argan Oil has been great. I use it to moisturize my lips, on the delicate skin under my eyes, my hands, as well as my hair.  It isn&#x27;t greasy, absorbs well and I can feel it&#x27;s presence on my skin long after I apply it.  Comes in responsible packaging -- mother earth thanks you, pura d&#x27;or!</li>
    <li> We bought this because it is an organic product and my wife loves it. She has very dry skin and this really helps. She has a mixture of different oils that she uses and this fits in very nicely. Great product and company. Shipped fast</li>
    <li> This is the best argan oil ever and a little goes a long way. I used this on my hair and scalp it&#x27;s none greasy which I love it gives my hair incredible shine. I also use this on my mom hair ..her hair is really fine so it&#x27;s easily weighed down by oils which makes her hair limp but she love this oil because it don&#x27;t weighj her hair down and it still has body after the oil is applied.</li>
    <li> great product, at a great price!  arrived on time.  very pleased.</li>
    <li> Very helpful especially with the change in weather, keeps my skin soft takes away all the dryness. Make sure to actually rub in the oil for the minute suggested, it makes a difference.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love Argan Oil!!  It is not greasy or oily (even though it is an oil).  I am amazed how quickly I have seen results.  My skin is softer and smoother.  I will definitely purchase this product again!</li>
    <li> I have tried many different products to control frizz. I like letting my hair air dry and go natural, but I&#x27;ve always had a problem with frizz. This is the best product I have found so far for this problem. I would say I am completely satisfied with this aspect of the product. My only advice with it is to go very light with it, as it has a tendency to make my hair look incredibly greasy if I am not careful. You have to play around with it to figure out exactly how much you need to de-frizz without the grease. For me, I have long, fine hair, I use 2 full pumps. I learned the hard way, you will want to figure this out in advance on a day when you have time to spare if you need to rewash your hair!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have also started using it on my face, as I have read that it is good for wrinkles and skin softness. It does not absorb well at all into the skin, so only use it at night on the face. It will not work well under makeup.</li>
    <li> never found anything better!</li>
    <li> I love argan oil and have been using it for a couple of years. I tried this one, since the other brand I loved changed and seems to add carrier oils now. Pure argan oil is not greasy after it soaks in, is golden in color, somewhat thick, and a wonderful moisturizer. It also helps clear up acne and doesn&#x27;t irritate the face. This one seems to have been diluted, because it stays very greasy even after hours of being massaged in, has a tinge of gold, very runny, irritates my skin, and dries it out rather than moisturizing. I&#x27;ll find a use for it I guess, I just haven&#x27;t found what it&#x27;s good for yet. But I haven&#x27;t seen any of the benefits of true argan oil.</li>
    <li> I think the quality of this product is very good.  I will order it again.</li>
    <li> I love this oil so much!!!!! I use it for my face at night as my moisturizer and it never makes me feel too greasy oil, it leaves a nice smooth feeling without too sticky oily texture. When I wake up in the morning my skin feels soft and silky. I also use this oil as my hair treatment for my color treated hair to avoid from dried damaged hair. It leave my scalp healthy and my highlights are still shinning and nourished. I am continuing to buy this product and use it for my entire body moisturizer in one!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this--I live in a really dry climate, and since I started using this (2-3 times a day, usually after washing my face) I haven&#x27;t even had to use moisturizer anymore. Before, no matter how often I put on moisturizer, my skin never really stopped feeling dry. With this, my face is clearer, smoother, brighter, and softer. I&#x27;ve liked this better than any supposedly &amp;#34;anti-breakout&amp;#34; moisturizer recommended by my dermatologist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One drawback: When I use it below my eyes, it usually causes raccoon eyes from mascara (especially overnight). I use a normal makeup remover for my eyes and avoid putting this below my eyes too often.</li>
    <li> I wish I could take a bath in this stuff it is so good.  Great for skin, hair, nails, feet and lips.  I apply it to my face in the morning and it soaks right in.  Also great packaging with a pump but can also be transferred to smaller bottles.  I will definitely order more.</li>
    <li> After reading about the positive effects, specifically the anti-aging benefits of Argan oil, I purchased this particular oil. I can definitely see the benefits of the oil on my face, the tiny lines under my eyes have diminished and my skin overall is softer. I use it on my face, neck, and hands. The reason I give it 4.stars is because I noticed a few pimples forming on my forehead and on my jawline...too much oil on my T-zone area, where I tend to be more oily anyway, so very little amount is needed. Other than that, I will be purchasing this oil again.</li>
    <li> IÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™ve wanted to try Argon Oil from Josie Maran, but it was too expensive for me to try.  A coworker raved about her purchase of Pura dor Argan Oil from Amazon.  . I noticed her face has a smoother more youthful appearance, which has convinced me to buy it.  I ordered it on Wednesday and it arrived in my mail box on Friday, which is very amazingly fast for mail order.  This morning I woke up with chapped lips and I put it on once and several hours later, my lips are no longer chapped.  I havenÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™t used it on my face yet as I have a beauty regime, but I will incorporate this Argon Oil into now, especially knowing that my chapped lips were healed with only one application.  ™m really happy with my purchase!</li>
    <li> I lived in Morocco for seven months and used a lot of argan oil. This definitely isn&#x27;t the real deal. Don&#x27;t get me wrong, it&#x27;s nice oil, it just isn&#x27;t argan. It&#x27;s much thicker and leaves an oily film. Guess you get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> I also used for under eye area at bedtime. Just started using a hair tamer after washing my hair. Just a little amount goes a long way for eye area, 2-3 pumps for shoulder length hair is sufficient.</li>
    <li> Hi , I like the pura d Argon Oil. i Use it daily during night. It makes my skin very soft since i am having very dry skin.I dont feel much difference in my skin tone though.</li>
    <li> It mosturized and purified my skin</li>
    <li> I like Pura d&#x27;or Argan oil, this Argan oil feels light, I use this oil as my hair and body conditioner after shower</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t make your hair so oily and almost has no smell at all. It does make my hair sleek, formal and tidy though I already badly need a haircut.</li>
    <li> I have been using argan oil for more than a year now, and I will never give it up. Previously I was paying triple for this from another source - what a delight to find this great product at such a reasonable price. My hair is thick, and at times fly-away - just the residue of the oil left on my hands after applying to my face and neck, run through my hair makes it behave the way I want it to. You don&#x27;t need a lot of this product to do the job. When I first started using the oil, I was using entirely too much (and wasting it). A small amount goes a long way. Unless you are using this oil to moisturize your entire body, the bottle should last you at least a year. If you have never tried argan oil, I highly recommend you give this a try - you will love it.</li>
    <li> This product does make my thick, wavy hair shinier and manageable; so far am satisfied with the results I am getting.</li>
    <li> Great deal.  I love this stuff.</li>
    <li> As a disclaimer....Pura d&#x27;Or offers a free bottle of this argan oil if you leave a positive review after your purchase. You submit the link to your review and your free bottle is in the mail.  That being said, it IS a good product.  I have extremely sensitive skin. Even products designed for sensitive skin will burn me. On the advice of a friend, I tried Pura d&#x27;or Organic Argan Oil and it doesn&#x27;t burn me! It&#x27;s the only thing I&#x27;ve found to use as a moisturizer that doesn&#x27;t irritate or burn my skin.  This Argan oil has also replaced the jojoba oil I use in the shampoo I make for myself. Since using the Argan oil, my hair is smoother and has beautiful shine without being weighed down or greasy-looking.  I am confident in recommending this Argan oil to anyone but especially for people with sensitive skin.  This stuff works. It really works.</li>
    <li> i already used this product for one month. It feels very good. My hair lost less. the smell is lovely.</li>
    <li> After searching a long time for an Argan oil with no &amp;#34;extras,&amp;#34; I was very happy to find this product!  I love it and look forward to using it for a very long time.</li>
    <li> This oil is incredible.100% satisfaction, I am very happy to order it. Highly recommended for future purchases</li>
    <li> this is a very good product, after use it ,I been ordering several time ,works great on skin as well as hair .and it&#x27;s natural .</li>
    <li> I bought this product for my wife ,she is using it for her face and hair. She loved it so much that i also tried and use on my hair . Product is very good quality, and my wife claim that is helping her .</li>
    <li> I really like this product. I purchased it with a hope to restore my damaged hair. I have started using this oil about 2.5 weeks ago, and I already can see the difference. My hair looks healthier and shinier. Also, I noticed that I do not lose as much hair as before. This is a really good news!</li>
    <li> Excellent product for face and hair.  I use 3-4 pumps per application and I feel totally hydrated and not greasy.  Absorbs quickly.  No skin reaction.  Great stuff.</li>
    <li> A bit pricey but it was Worth it</li>
    <li> I have very thin and dry hair and I used many different products last 10 years. I purchased this pura dor hair oil right after I used their hair loss shampoo. The shampoo was the best thing I ever used on my hair .. so I had a no doubt about this product and I loved it.&lt;br /&gt;I will continue to use this hair products. .Thank you so much!</li>
    <li> I love this product: I have used it on my hair and skin for over a year and the results have been amazing. I have curly hair that is naturally prone to frizz, a couple drops after washing it significantly reduces frizz, at the same time not weighing my hair down. It has also made my hair less prone to breakage; its fuller and shinier. I use it on my face in the morning and in the night time in lieu of moisturizer and my skin is no longer riddled with acne, it is smooth and radiant with a subtle glow. I love this, it has become a beauty staple in my skin and hair regime.</li>
    <li> Wonderful! Makes skin smooth and diminishes lines. Love it. It is my second order</li>
    <li> I love this oil! It keeps my hair from being frizzy!</li>
    <li> All I can say is WOW! I have had soooooooooo much trouble with acne scarring, scabs, and active adult acne. I cannot even describe the self esteem issues I have had. I used another form of argan oil after reading all the wonderful things it does, but it did not seem to do anything....I decided to give it one last try. I found this on amazon and after reading all the reviews, gave it a try. OMG!! What a HUGEEEE difference. In such a short time, my acne scarring is GREATLY diminished, my skin is glowing, and I have had hardly any breakouts. Its the holy grail of skin care. all the harsh acne products tore apart my skin and made it dry and horrible...this saved my skin. I am so blessed that I found this stuff. I highly recommend this product to anyone and everyone with any skin condition. it works like magic. its an affordable price for any budget and the bottle lasts forever. just one pump morning and night after washing your face....you wont regret it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ps. i just started using this on my hair at night and have noticed it just shines like no other. i have dermatitis on my scalp and suffer from flakes, and this has completely gotten rid of it in 2 days. i will update when i have used it on my hair for longer.</li>
    <li> I used to have light straight hair, over the years my hair has become curly and frizzy. I have tons of products for the frizziness. But most of these products help at first and then somehow my hair either becomes used to them or the product loses its effectiveness. Not with Pura d&#x27;or organic argan oil. With this product on the days that I do not wash my hair, I put it on in the morning on dry hair and the silkiness lasts all day. When I wash my hair I put it on when my hair is still damp ( I used more than just a couple of drops) and it leaves my hair soft and no frizz all day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use it on my skin too. It is a good mosturizer</li>
    <li> I have to say.. I am quite impressed with this product. I have used it on my face - i have acne.. But i didn&#x27;t have any breakouts while using this - and my skin is much softer and looking younger.&lt;br /&gt;I have used it for my hair - i have had issues with using oil on my scalp, since i start getting boils on my scalp that hurt - but with this product, i have no issues and my hair looks much nicer and healthier.&lt;br /&gt;I even used it on my 5 yr old and it seems to get absorbed into the skin and hair very quickly. Love it! I would highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Excellent product. I am using it for my hair and my dry skin. It will make my skin smooth and not dry at all. I have been using it for 2 weeks.</li>
    <li> This product showed up in my mail box a few days before it was expected to! I am so happy with the fast shipping.&lt;br /&gt;The bottle itself is a beautiful glass Amber with gold label &amp; a lot more product than I was expecting too!&lt;br /&gt;The oil is so nice, clear, not gooey and no filmy residue. It absorbs right into my hair and any left over on my skin rubs and absorbs into the skin just as easy! I am so pleased and hope to purchase more from this brand!</li>
    <li> Fantastic product at an excellent price! I use this as a scalp treatment product and it has provided the Only relief!</li>
    <li> Boo. I had previously posted a good review for this thinking that I liked this stuff but since my face has broken out like no other. I mean its like I am a teenager (i am not) again and my skin is so dry. All the claims don&#x27;t add up. Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for years.  It is the best.  I have tried other oils and have had allergic reactions due to all the fragrance additives.  Pura d&#x27;or leaves my hair soft and smooth.  It keeps the frizz down on humid days.  I highly recommend it for people with coarse hair.</li>
    <li> Pura d&#x27;or worked really well on my dry skin and made my hair shinny just like my Moroccan Oil.</li>
    <li> I really love this product.  It does not leave your face feeling oily.  It is a product that can be used every day.  You can tell a difference in your skin when you do not use it.</li>
    <li> I put on my hair every night before I go to bed and wash it when I wake up. The best thing is when I apply it on my air it didn&#x27;t sticky as coconut oil, it very light and not messy at all. I put my face also and it didn&#x27;t make any break out since y skin is very easy to breakout so I am happy with this oil. Now I pour some of the to my body wash too. And my skin is soft and glowing, absolutely no sticky</li>
    <li> effective but a little too oily for the hair</li>
    <li> Love the Pura d&#x27;or 100% Organic Argan Oil.  Tested it the minute I received it and loved it.  Make my skin feel so buttery.  Was absorbed quickly and didn&#x27;t leave an oily residue.  Had my friend (who doesn&#x27;t like most products) try it and she immediately ordered it.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s an absolute part of my daily routine.&lt;br /&gt;JSlade</li>
    <li> Same thing as the Josie Maran argan oil, but with a MUCH better price. This oil is a bit more liquidy, comes with a pump rather than a dropper, hydrates the skin very nicely without a greasy/oily feel, and has a LOT more oil for the price. I also enjoy how this product comes with a biodegradable bag around it and the little paper that tells you the uses was printed on 100% recycled paper with sustainable ink.&lt;br /&gt;I enjoy the product, the price, and the company. :) The extras make me happy that the company is doing its part to keep the earth happy and its women beautiful. ♥</li>
    <li> This is a very high quality product at a very good price. I have used more expensive brands of Argan oil but this one is superior.  Very soothing and moisturizing yet not oily or greasy. Your skin looks fresh and glowing!  I seldom even need any foundation since using this oil.</li>
    <li> Really like the pump.  The oil is light,odorless and absorbs well.  Will have to wait to see how well it works.</li>
    <li> Argan oil has become an indespensible part of my routine since first trying it a year and a half ago.  Since then I&#x27;ve used several different brands and although I haven&#x27;t noticed much difference between the oil itself from the various companies, I have had some negative experiences with poor quality bottles and misleading discription of the product size.  The Pura d&#x27;or argan oil is priced very reasonably, and comes in a quality 4 oz bottle with a convenient pump dispenser (rather than an eye dropper).  The order also arrived in less than 48 hours which was a nice surprise.  Argan oil is an amazing substance that fights dryness in the skin and hair and never irritates or feels greasy.  I would and have recommended it to friends and family.</li>
    <li> Nice light oil that absorbs well into the skin.  It works well on damp hair, leaving it soft when dry, but a little greasy for me when applied to dry hair.  Doesn&#x27;t tame the frizzies on my permed hair.</li>
    <li> This oil is amazing i can use it for almost anything besides cooking it lives up to the Title &amp;#34;Liquid Gold&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> I purchase this second of it&#x27;s sister Argan Oil has an woodsy light sent. I have already gone through well half the bottle I use it all over body. Why ladies put on creams that clogs your pours when this Pure Argan Oil goes into your pours and not clogs them. It&#x27;s great during cold weather like a shield of protection. It&#x27;s not oily what so ever. As you age you will need to use more Argon Oil and drink plenty of spring water that will keep you dewy and w/o wrinkles. This is my so call Make-Up with a little lip tint and should be yours. When I first used this Argan Oil on my face in TWO (2) days an change in dullness I was face and neck lifted. I looked fresh and heads turned!  I also eat Fruits and Veggies and sometime cooked/steamed foods this also surely helps as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Animal flesh just rots your body! LIVE ARGAN OIL &amp; LIVE FOODS YOU&amp;#34;LL NEVER GO WRONG!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pura d&#x27;or make an hand oil cream for the purse w/o the junk in the trunk!!&lt;br /&gt;PS QVC has it check it.</li>
    <li> I live in the high desert where the humidity is very low.  I use this product on my face, neck, arms, hands and legs.  This is my second bottle and I am very pleased with the results.  My skin stays moisturized all day.  Even my legs stay soft and are not dry and flaky.  As a bonus, my nails don&#x27;t break as often.  It works much better foe me than coconut oil.</li>
    <li> This product has worked wonders on the quality of my hair and face! My hair is so much softer and shinier! I do oil-cleansing treatments on my face with this Argon oil and it leaves my face feeling soo hydrated and refreshed!! I love this product!!</li>
    <li> ordered for my husband. the delivery was fast and packaged well. well designed/easy to use. its only been a couple of weeks but seems my husband loves it and uses it everyday. he squeezes a few drops on palm or fingers, rub then apply oiled palm/fingers on hair or bald areas in massage manner. he finally rubs his hands on face. it is hard to tell the lasting effect since its only been a couple of weeks but his hair do look shinier and healthier. will try to update later.</li>
    <li> Great product.  Will order again</li>
    <li> good product. i like the way it makes my skin feel. soft. dosent feel greasy,absorbs quickly. Im on my second bottle. I would recommend this product to anyone.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great. I use it on my skin and nails. My hubby uses it in his hair which is thick and wavy. If I use a little bit on my hair it makes it shine. I have to be careful because I have very straight fine hair that can look greasy quickly if I over do it.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing, buy it</li>
    <li> Great product. I love it. Feels so soft in your hair.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great. I&#x27;ve been using it for about a year now and there is nothing that works better. Great product.</li>
    <li> Great product. Used to have dry skin on my arms and feet, but applying a few squirts to each area once a day helps immensely</li>
    <li> Great hair product. Natural and light. Love it!</li>
    <li> I used to use cream moisturizers, and my skin kept feeling drier and I would need to find heavier and heavier moisturizers to do the job.  After i started using this argan oil, I&#x27;ve reduced the use of other moisturizers, and now I just use the oil by itself.  It keeps my skin glowy and not oily at all.  I like it alot and I would recommend it to all my girl friends.</li>
    <li> Great product and was delivered in hardly 2 days!!</li>
    <li> It is very useful oil ever! I use this for my face, body and hair. It does really good job for everything. I feel like my skin never become dry anymore.</li>
    <li> I first heard about argon oil through my sister, using it only on her hair, never thought it could be used for anything else. I have struggled with acne since middle school, I&#x27;m 20 now. I have very sensitive skin along with the rest of the acne package, or did. I had cystic acne, zits, white heads, pimples, black heads, everything. And if I found a product that worked for a little bit, then I still had the battle scars to show what I&#x27;d been through. When I first got this product, I was very excited to use it! I had read so much about it and was ready to give it a try! After a week I noticed my face was clearer. After about two weeks my acne was still dying but still no new zits or anything. After a month my face didn&#x27;t have a trace of acne that I was getting used to having clear skin, even my scars were fading which was all I ever wanted. Now 6 months in I still have clear skin and my scars are either gone or very hard to see! I use it every night after I take off my makeup. I recommend this already to everyone I know, I would highly recommend this to everyone else. I still have the bottle I bought 6 months ago, very worth it. If you do what you&#x27;ve always done, you&#x27;ll get what you&#x27;ve always got! So try something new, this might just be what your looking for! Good luck :)</li>
    <li> Very good stuff!  I&#x27;ve tried many oils and creams, but Pura d&#x27;or Argan Oil delivers the benefits that many have heard about.  I use it on my face and in my hair and noticed that it works much better than the main stream brands that profess to reduce wrinkles and moisturize along with leaving hair smoother, richer and even darker.  I would recommend this to anyone.  You will not be disappointed!</li>
    <li> WOW!!! I really love this product. I cannot use Regular creams/lotions/moisturizers because i have very sensitive skin!! I gave up on products years ago, until recently. I knew i needed something so i looked up reviews on Amazon and decided to give this a try, boy am i glad i did!!! I love it so much I introduced it to my mom who is now hooked!! I also introduced it to my nephew (who has MAJOR dry skin) and its doing wonders for him!</li>
    <li> We have been quite impressed with this product. My daughter plays sports and is often in the pool year around for her swimming activities (and chlorine impact on her hair). Since using this pura dor her hair have started to shine back again and there is a marked improvement within couple of weeks of the use.  Yes, we will recommend this..</li>
    <li> I have just recently started using Pura d&#x27;or for my hair. In the winter air, my hair can get very dry, especially because it is processed. The Argan oil adds sheen and lustre without any excess weight. Hair looks nourished, not weighted down. As i try Pura d&#x27;or for its other uses, I may add that 5th star!</li>
    <li> This is a great value for argan oil. I use it daily and it is especially good for &amp;#34;winter&amp;#34; skin. This is my second bottle---and I&#x27;m anticipating I will have it as a staple in my beauty regime.</li>
    <li> Great product, have been using it for months. Love it. Really works on the skin.</li>
    <li> Love this oil for skin and hair.</li>
    <li> Absolutely wonderful. Makes you r complexion smooth and vibrant.</li>
    <li> Helps reduce my hair&#x27;s annoying frizz and adds luster. My hair looks and feels healthier after using this product.</li>
    <li> Great source of Argan oil, I put it every day twice a day. Recomend of it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about a week. I&#x27;ve been using it on my skin, hair, and cuticles. So far, so good. I will continue to use this.</li>
    <li> Best Argan Oil, I will never use another one again!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a week now, and so far so good.  My skin is so soft in the morning.  Looking forward to great results.  I plan on trying some of their other products.</li>
    <li> I used on face and hair and absorbed very well and fast.  It makes the skin soft and it is nice you can use 12 month and does not feel greasy. The price is very reasonable for the size you receive.</li>
    <li> Pura d&#x27;or&#x27;s 100% Pure &amp; USDA Organic Argan oil remarkably assists me in the care of the skin on my face and hands. As a black man who suffers from razor bumps, having Pura d&#x27;or&#x27;s Argan Oil a part of my facial cleanse regimen (specifically as a post-shaving moisturizer [I apply it directly onto my face after my Shea Moisture&#x27;s Tea Tree Herbal Bump Preventer is applied]).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also use this Argan oil in my hair, on my hands to keep my cuticles from peeling. It&#x27;s been phenomenal.</li>
    <li> I use this just because.. I leave my hair curly, its natural. so its always super soft and lite feeling. I put on my ends, smells good throughout the day.</li>
    <li> This oil is the real deal.After washing and drying my hair i added two pumps of this oil to my hair and massaged it thoroughly,I was amazed imediately,My hair became so silky,shiny and felt so soft..Really amazing product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had amazing skin and hair results with Pura d&#x27;or Argan Oil.  Lines around my eyes are gone!  My skin is now very soft and all lines are minimized.  The best part is that I no longer rely on expensive skin care.  This product does what I need.  Based on the claims of the literature, I purchased a bottle for my granddaughter who has eczema.  She has had very successful results.  All out-breaks respond better than any other treatments her doctors have recommended.  Because the product is organic, I no longer worry about chemicals.</li>
    <li> It is a good stuff for nail and skin but not so great on my hair.</li>
    <li> I like this product. I have used it for my nails, my hair and my skin, it works great. my nails get shining, my hair feels gentle and my skin feels soft.</li>
    <li> A wonderful safe and natural product.  I purchased this product based on a review I read and received this within 2 days on Amazon Prime.  The first time I applied the product I was skeptical because it felt like I put oil on my skin that was going to basically stay there and leave a mess.  I was pleasantly surprised as this product was quickly absorbed into my skin without a trace of oily residue.  I loved the fact that my skin seemed to drink this up and immediately noticed my skin reacting to this treatment  by appearing moister and healthier looking.  I decided to apply it again at night since it dissolved so quickly into my skin and at night it worked even better as I woke up to fresher and more supple skin.  I know that since this is natural and organic I am not doing any harm to my skin and instead am taking the best care of it that I can.  I will continue to use this product as long as my skin reacts like this.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product! I had heard how great it was and had heard it called liquid gold before, but I&#x27;d never imagined it was this good! My hair is so soft and so healthy looking after just two uses; I couldn&#x27;t believe it. I&#x27;ve used it a few times on my skin and it was still a bit dry after, but not much helps against harsh Minnesota winters, but it did such a wonderful job on my hair I&#x27;m sure if I keep it up it will also work wonders for my skin. It really is a mirical oil. My husband has the dryest hair of anyone I&#x27;ve ever met and I couldnt believe the complete transformation it had on his hair. I highly recommend this product and will surely continue to use it myself for as long as they continue to make it!</li>
    <li> love this product I use it for dry hair and nails - shipped promptly and priced fairly</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this oil! I have used it on my hands and face. It is heavenly on my dry feet and on my dry hair.</li>
    <li> I have medium length, frizzy, dyed blondish hair that can be styled curly or straight. Naturally, its an indecisive mess in between. My hairdresser sold me a small, rather expensive bottle of organic &amp;#34;lite&amp;#34; Argan oil that I really enjoyed using. When I ran out, I bought Pura d&#x27;or Argan oil, in an attempt to avoid repurchasing the pricey, salon stuff. At first, I tried using the exact same amount as the old brand, 4 pumps on wet hair. Once air dried, my hair was very oily looking. I applied some heat, rolling a curling iron throughout and that helped tone down the oiliness. I&#x27;ve found I only need 2-3 pumps of Pura d&#x27;or Argan on the bottom half of my strands, depending on how much heat I am using when styling. Over all I really like this oil and have noticed a big decline in my frizz factor!</li>
    <li> This product is amazing for hair and skin. It&#x27;s highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I love this Argan Oil! I use it everyday in my hair so it will look healthy and shiny. This Argan Oil is not like store bought crap that put a lot of other things in it. This is pure 100% Argan oil that is cold pressed which means that they haven&#x27;t destroyed all the wonderful benefits it provides with heat. I have been using Argan Oil for about five years now and this is the best I have used and it is not overpriced like the others. I can&#x27;t say enough about, it is great for dry hair or just wanting extra shine, it is great for dry skin especially in the winter. I love it!</li>
    <li> Pura d&#x27;or Argan Oil is priced reasonably, and comes in a glass 4 oz amber bottle with a convenient pump dispenser. The order also was packed well and arrived quickly. This oil is light, does not cause me to break out and a little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> I was so happy to have come across this generous size of pure argon oil. I&#x27;ve been using Josie Marin&#x27;s oil for awhile now, but, it&#x27;s become way to expensive for me over the long haul. My skin has improved greatly since using this oil. I use it on my face, neck, cuticles, elbows, knees.....I have sensitive skin and have not had any bad reactions to this brand of oil. I alternate Argon Oil, with all my other facial products. I use it at least 3 times a week, instead of them. I am happy to be able to look forward to continuing my use, due to Pura d&#x27;or.  I highly recommend this product, and I care very much what I use on my skin.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this stuff, and cannot believe that I went so long without this in my daily skin care routine. My current night-time skin care routine is as follows: 50/25/25 mix of jojoba/apricot/castor oil cleanse to remove all make-up and dirt. I then exfoliate using Swisspers exfoliative wipes soaked in witch hazel, followed by a 50/50 mix of apple cider vinegar. I then rinse that all off, and end by massaging one pump of Pura d&#x27;or Argan Oil onto my face and neck, which I truely believe is the reason my skin has transformed. It used to be rough and dry, but since using this product on a regular basis, it has TRANSFORMED into beautiful, glowing skin. It does not break me out, or feel heavy on my face. I also reach for this at nights when my lips are a bit dry, and wake up with moisturized lips. I occassionally use it on the ends of my hair when they need a little TLC, and it is great for that as well. If you are on the fence, just get it and try it! I promise you will not be disappointed.</li>
    <li> Just seems like baby oil. Not bad, but nothing special. I will keep using it, maybe I will feel better later.</li>
    <li> I have heard a lot about argan oil benefits now it&#x27;s time to give it a try for my fizzy hair. I looked online and I have found that pure d&#x27; or has very good reviews. I got it during winter and it was a good idea to give it a shot with my skin. I put it on after shower and I feel that this oil stays on my skin over night. I feel more confident to put it on my hair. I have a frizzy hair and have been doing japanese straight perm for a long time. I have decided to try to let my nature hair grow without any hair perm. It became so frizzy even though I use frizz ease product from drugstore. After I put on pura d&#x27;or on my damp hair, it became less frizz more shiny and i have easy time to blow dry and iron my hair. I can go out without worry about my hair become fluffy again. Totally love it!!!</li>
    <li> I was paying more for a smaller bottle of argan oil in another brand.  I decided to try this and it is the same product at a much better price point.  I don&#x27;t know how I ever managed my curly hair without this product!  It totally cuts down on frizz.  I also use it on my face at night as a moisturizer, and have used it on my hands and dry cuticles as well.</li>
    <li> Very nice product, use it everywhere hair between shampoos skin nails.Would buy again.</li>
    <li> This stuff is awesome. Very high quality.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing! I am using it as a moisturizer on my face and it works great. It is not too heavy and does miracles for my skin even though it is prone to breakouts. I had a little spot of eczema on my face, which persisted for months. I tried everything on it. The argan oil cured it within a week! I was amazed. I highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never used Argon Oil before and wanted to give it a try. I use it at night under my moisturizer and I wake up with very soft skin. I have mild rosasea and it really reduces the inflammation on my cheeks over night. I also have dry sensitive skin and have had no breakouts in the 2 or so weeks that I&#x27;ve been using this daily. I use two pumps on just the ends of my medium long, fine, flyaway hair just before blow drying and my hair looks healthier throughout the day. I will continue to use this product as long as I&#x27;m seeing positive results. The price is excellent for the product size!</li>
    <li> I very much like this product. It has taken the place of my moisturizer. There is no scent which makes it easy to use. I also use it on my cuticles and nails. I recommend this product</li>
    <li> Watery. I prefer the Josie Maran brand. Not watery at all.</li>
    <li> I was looking for 100percent argan oil for me and my mom.&lt;br /&gt;This is it!  It&#x27;s first time I bought this product I love it.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m using for my hair and face. It can be little wierd feeling in the begining because t&#x27;s little different from other oils but try to keep use it you&#x27;ll see your skin glowing.  I&#x27;m mid 40&#x27;s the age need to use facisl oil. I srtongly recommend this argan oil.</li>
    <li> Love this for my hair!  I also love that this is pure argon oil without any other chemicals or additives.  I&#x27;ve used other brands that have argon oil in it and had to use a couple of quarter-sized amounts to get the shine and softness I wanted.  So...the first time I used Pura D&#x27;or I used way to much and the results were greasy.  Took a couple of times but now I have it down.  I have long hair so I use one pump to do the ends up to my shoulders then one more pump for the rest of my hair.  Gives me such a healthy, beautiful shine along with a nice softness.  My hair has bounce to it, too!  I have used a little on my face, too, and love how it relieves the dryness without being greasy.  I totally recommend this brand!</li>
    <li> I love this product!! purchased it after trying other brands. It arrived on time well packed and protected and it also came with an extra pouch for storage. I love it comes in an opaque glass bottle with a pump making it easier for use and preventing any oxidation over time. I mainly use argan oil for my hair and always get compliments!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s an excellent product behaving and restoring hair and restablishig skin irritant skin zones. Love it.</li>
    <li> Works really great. First I ordered it for my mom and let her test it hehehe. This keeps your skin and hair fresh healthy and shiny. All my dryness is gone. Better than any lotion out there and it isn&#x27;t greasy. A little bit on the hair makes it greasy but not too much. I would suggest applying it before bed and then shower in the morning. After u shower rub a bit all over your face and neck n wherever else you&#x27;d like. You&#x27;ll notice a major difference in days not weeks after use. Will definitely be buying it again</li>
    <li> I love this product! I have been looking for a light, non-greasy hair and face oil.</li>
    <li> I am in love with this product.  I works exactly as people have stated in the reviews.  I put it on my face just after a shower and before putting on makeup.  I love the way it makes my hair look and feel healthy.  I was so please with Pura d&#x27;or that I bought it for 5 people in my family over the holiday.</li>
    <li> I simply love he oil for my cuticles!  Also works great on itchy dry hands and body!</li>
    <li> Purchased this almost a month ago and am really loving it as a replacement for my face moisturizer.  So great on hands too.  Not causing any breakouts and I love that it&#x27;s organic but half the price of the expensive Josie Maran Argan Oil.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been battling with dry scalp and not being able to get that shine every girl dreams of in my hair...Have been using this for a few days now and can see the change already. The oil soaks into the skin like quality oil should and has the faintest, if any, scent which is key as I&#x27;m sensitive to smells. Overall, great product.</li>
    <li> I ordered pura d&#x27; or after using Now brand argan oil for sometime. Pura d&#x27; or is so much better. Smell and texture of oil is great. It does not have that rancid smell after being opened for a while. I love applicator it is much more convenient than the Doppler. The quality is great. I&#x27;m looking forward to trying more of this brands products.</li>
    <li> Very effective. Not fond of the smell so I just use it at night</li>
    <li> Great product and value for daily use, I am in my third bottle and have recommended to my friends and daughter.</li>
    <li> Skeptical I was. However, this was a very beneficial buy. I took a chance, believing it would probably sit on a shelf as many products I try do. To my surprise and satisfaction I truly like it. I use it with my  shampoo. I feel my hair is much more manageable and has less frizz. I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I love this as a moisturizer in my middle 40s its perfect for my normal to dry skin it resolves those dry spots near my cheeks and under my chin and isnt heavy weighing down my skin</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never attached a photo to a review before, but I&#x27;m pretty excited about this oil and feel like this company deserves a shout-out. My hair in its natural state is dry and frizzy, and it&#x27;s fine but coarse enough to hold a lot of product. I used to use a a quarter sized amount of Bumble &amp; Bumble Defrizz (which is a great product, just a bit pricey) mixed with an equal amount of a styling cream while wet, then add a bit more of the B&amp;B mixed with a pomade to control the frizz layer on top once my hair was completely dry. Now I&#x27;m using about a dime size of this oil to two parts styling cream on wet hair and finding that I don&#x27;t need touch ups after it dries. This is great because as curly hair people know, it has to air dry which takes forever, so it&#x27;s nice knowing I can just leave the house with wet hair and it will turn out right without worrying about a round two of de-frizzing. My hair feels soft and the coarse and frizzies stay tamed, and I think it looks shinier - I&#x27;m seriously happy with this oil. I did use too much the first time (three pumps for chest-length hair) and it did weigh it down a bit, so I would suggest using a tiny amount to start.</li>
    <li> I purchased this to use as a carrier oil for my essential oil blends.  I mix my blends and put in a small roll on perfume bottle.  It is great.  Doesn&#x27;t change the smell and conditions the skin.  I am happy with this purchase</li>
    <li> I love this product and would highly recommend it to others.  I have naturally curly hair and it works great for that!</li>
    <li> Best and pure argan oil ever. Perfect bottle and easy to use.</li>
    <li> My skin has never looked better and it is really now very soft. Don&#x27;t take my word for it, try it yourself. Plus the fine wrinkles around my eyes are less noticeable. Rub a small amount of Pura d&#x27;or on dry cracked heels for instant relief. If I could only have 1 beauty product, this would be it.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product because it&#x27;s all natural and it had high reviews. I wanted a natural oil to use on my face and hair. It is terrible! I understand it&#x27;s an oil, but it says it can be used on the face and will NOT cause acne. Well I broke out like crazy using this product and I&#x27;ve never had acne in my life!! I&#x27;ve also used it in my hair and all it does is leave my hair limp and oily, not nourished and silky. The only reason I&#x27;m giving it 2 stars is because it seems to be a good moisturizer for my hands at night. Otherwise terrible product!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s my 2nd year using argan oil, my old product ran out and I decide to give this product a try. I have a very dry skin, usually apply argan oil first on my face before applying a moisurizing cream on top of it. The Pura d&#x27;or product works very well, very smooth and nice to use, with a little bit of aroma. The only thing that I personally would have liked is that the oil doesn&#x27;t have the &amp;#34;sticky&amp;#34; feeling. My old product was more thick, which helped lock in moisture more and made my face feel smoother. This product would be perfect for people who do not like the sticky oily feeling of argan oil, but if you are like me with a super dry skin that wants a smoother surface, a thicker oil product may be better for you.</li>
    <li> In looking for an anti-aging product and trying many fancy, more expensive ones, I keep coming back to this. I am on my second bottle. This is a great multi-purpose oil for face and body (I haven&#x27;t tried hair) and it even helps heal pimples and cuts much quicker. It soaks in well and is light, not greasy. The best thing is it&#x27;s simple and organic, so it won&#x27;t repair one thing while it damages another. All good.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product on my face and body for about two weeks, and I&#x27;m really pleased.  This product leaves my skin not just feeling soft and moisturized, but silky.  It is not sticky, I don&#x27;t detect a fragrance, and the effects last all day long.  Thanks!</li>
    <li> I have tried several Argan Oil blends and didn&#x27;t &amp;#34;love them&amp;#34;.  I found this organic 100% Argan oil through amazon and took a chance on it.  I LOVE it!  This product is truly amazing...my hair is softer, my skin is healthier and my nails look amazing.  I highly recommend this product to anyone looking to &amp;#34;try out&amp;#34; this Argan Oil trend.</li>
    <li> I used Josie Maran but felt it was too expensive so I was looking for other options.  I was more than happy that I decided to try this.  The oil is just as good and the price is right!</li>
    <li> This is amazing. I have dry hair and a few drops everyday has made my hair more manageable. It is also a good face moisturizer.</li>
    <li> My facial skin is always dry, especially in hash winter.  I just started to use this product. So far, i can see the improvement. My face isn&#x27;t that dry comparing to before.</li>
    <li> Took a chance on ordering this product-----not at all disappointed!  I went from previous reviews and they were so RIGHT!  My cuticles in winter are NEVER soft----just a few applications (like 2) and such a noticeable difference.  Have told others about Pura d&#x27;or and comments like &amp;#34;oil is oil!&amp;#34; NO----this product is different and should be tried!</li>
    <li> This is a great product. The skin on my face has improved wonderfully and my hair always looks better when I use this after showering. I don&#x27;t wash my face anymore and only wash my hair about 2x per month, applying this product to my face daily and my hair after I do wash it.</li>
    <li> This is diluted and horrible stuff. I was excited at the cheap price but it dries my hair out unlike other argon oils. This is NOT what they say it is. You get what you pay for. Don&#x27;t buy this. They are lying on their label.</li>
    <li> Very good product, not oily to the skin, I&#x27;ve been getting dry skin after 40 y/o, specially in the bottom legs and ankles area; this product was a perfect remedy without feeling the oily sensation. It&#x27;s also great for the face at night and my wife use it when she blowout her hair; we also use it to body massage each other. It&#x27;s a perfect multi use oil.</li>
    <li> We&#x27;ve tried everything and after less than a week of using Pura d&#x27;or Organic Argan Oil, her eczema has cleared. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. It is fantastic on skin-- If my skin is dry and itchy I put this on when I get out of the shower and it soothes the itch. I also use it on my face before bed and, while you would think it would lead to zits, it doesnt. My skin has a beautiful healthy glow. It does not make you look oily or shiny, just nice and healthy. More recently I have been putting the argan oil on my belly as it soothes pregnant belly itch. All in all this is a great product.</li>
    <li> Really love the light feeling and smooth coverage of this pura d&#x27;or argon oil.  It doesn&#x27;t  feel heavy or clog my pores. I use it both morning and evening.  My skin is ultra sensitive and it doesn&#x27;t react to this natural oil.  The scent is natural and very light too.  My skin (face, hair and body) drink this oil up without problem!  It&#x27;s fantastic!&lt;br /&gt;At first, I used it only as a facial moisturizer but after seeing my  stylist, I was advised that it will help me with frizz and dry scalp, too. I&#x27;ve been using this multitasking Pura D&#x27;or Argan oil as my right hand beauty tool ever since!&lt;br /&gt;The nice part is when my friends and sisters ask me how I manage to maintain a healthy facial skin tone despite the weather.  It&#x27;s easy drinking lots of H2O and using Pura&#x27;s Organic Argan oil</li>
    <li> The second I got this product I had to apply skin. I have very dry skin and it get even worse in the winter. I apply this on my skin after I wash it and it feels amazing! I haven&#x27;t been using it for to long but I am already in love!</li>
    <li> I have been using this oil on my face, neck and chest for a couple weeks now. I like the way it sinks in and doesn&#x27;t get oil all over my pillow case like the jojoba oil I tried. Nor is it sticky feeling on my skin. Can&#x27;t say that it has erased any wrinkles or anything, but I do not believe anything short of surgery can do that anyway.</li>
    <li> Great deal. I paid $10 for a sample bottle several months ago. This is a great value at $20 for 4 oz. The product works .. I have psoriasis...The Argan oil is the only product that I have found that soothes my dry skin and alleviates the itchiness better than my doctor&#x27;s prescription .  My wife uses it as a skin moisturizer on her hands and feet.  She uses it on her nails (swears it promotes growth) and applies under her eyes. It absorbs without leaving any greasy residue.  I originally purchased  it to use as a hair gel, but discovered so many more uses. Really amazing stuff</li>
    <li> Use it daily and it works great.</li>
    <li> Good product. Environmentally conscience company</li>
    <li> I just started using this Argan oil product a week ago, so I may check in later to report on its &amp;#34;anti-aging&amp;#34; properties -- I have not seen much change yet on the fine lines/wrinkles front, to be honest.  That said, I like how it gives my skin a long-lasting, soft, moisturized feel.  Not greasy at all.  I am in my 40s and the softness reminds me of how my skin felt in my 20s! :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also like the dispenser-- it puts out just a little at a time, so less waste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using it on my face and neck-- I also use it on my hair to calm down some of the frizzies coming from my hair, which is going gray.  I cannot comment on how this product compares to other Argan oil brands, as this is the first Argan oil product I have used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would love to try the face cream, but at $89 it is just more than I will spend to try out a product.</li>
    <li> I really love this brand of Argan Oil.  I will buy no other.  It has a wonderful smell and goes on so smooth.  It keeps my face smooth and silky.  I also use it for my hair.  I have naturally curly hair with lots of frizz.  You just have to use a little and no more frizzy&#x27;s!!!&lt;br /&gt;My daughter and daughter-in law both use it and love it.</li>
    <li> After reading all the reviews, I was hopeful that I would have the same amazing results.  Unfortunately, that wasn&#x27;t the case.  The Argan oil ended up leaving the skin on my face drier than it was before I started using it.  Very disappointed, because I really wanted this to work. :-(</li>
    <li> I use this daily on my face. It moisturize without being greasy and I only need a couple drops.</li>
    <li> I just got this oil today and I can already feel it working its magic! I can&#x27;t wait for my hair, skin, and nails really reap the benefits of this product.</li>
    <li> Love this product! I bought this to use as a moisturizer for my face (it works great and soaks in fast) but have also used it on my hair and very dry hands and am impressed. Because it worked so well on my hands I decided to use it on my 7 years old son. He has bad dry skin that bothers him so much that he will scratch until he bleeds. I am limited to what I can use on his skin because he has nut allergies, so I started to use this product on him and immediately noticed an improvement. I also use organic raw Shea butter on his skin but it is sometimes uncomfortable to apply since you have to work in onto the skin. He prefers when I use argan oil. I also use it on my 3 year old now too during the winter months. I will make sure I never run out of this product in my home.</li>
    <li> Just received this. So far it&#x27;s great!</li>
    <li> I was happy to find this product on Amazon.  I had previously used it from another source.  Argan oil....I use this on all parts of my body and it is especially great around the eys and on the scalp/hair....Wonderful!</li>
    <li> This is my 3rd bottle.  I use Argan oil on my face, neck and hands twice a day.  It smooth&#x27;s out your complexion, moisturizes and gives you a healthy look!  I replaced all those expensive face cream&#x27;s with this brand of Argan oil and highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I had never tried Argan oil before but I was reading so many great things about it I thought I would give it a try.  I looked for pure ingredients and best cost so I went for Pura d&#x27;or.  I&#x27;m not disappointed.  Seems to nourish and hydrate skin very well and it&#x27;s when I forget to use it that I really see the difference- tight dry skin.</li>
    <li> I have been using argan oil for sometime now and have purchased it also for my daughters. I like how it makes my skin look and feel, usually applying it several times a day to hydrate my skin during these cold winter months. One of my daughters feels it is helping tone down her acne break outs to almost nothing. Can&#x27;t say it has repaired already aged skin but I think it has kept it from progressing and helps it look better.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend using argan oil, the sooner the better.</li>
    <li> I like to use this in mine and my daughter&#x27;s hair... we both have that frizzy curly type and its great to smooth it out and provides lots of good stuff in our hair at the same time.</li>
    <li> Love that it&#x27;s organic too! And a little goes a long way so you can use it sparingly. I would recommend to anyone</li>
    <li> I was extremely pleased with the Argan Oil.  The spray applicator works nicely and the oil is readily absorbed into your skin when you rub it in.  I used it in addition to my normal all over body moisturizer lotion and it mixed nicely and my skin appeared well moisturized.  The oil, itself; appears light, easily absorbed and has hardly any odor, ir any, it dissipates immediately.  I intend to use this in addition to my own lotion moisturizer to fight the dry skin we get here in the desert climate of Arizona.</li>
    <li> Making my own skincare now.  I use this as a base oil along with sea buckthorn seed oil, rosehip and some essential oils for my moisturizer.  Just as effective and much less expensive than the organic skincare lines I&#x27;ve found.</li>
    <li> This is the best Argan Oil that you will ever buy, period!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried others that have bad chemicals and leave my hair grease. Pura Dor has best ingredients and my hair love it, makes my hair strong once I apply it and when it dries I can feel the ends of my hair feels much stronger. I have also been using it on my face as I want my skin to be strong too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have very happy with this company, they have excellent products and I love that my hair and my face can look so good inside out.&lt;br /&gt;I use to buy expensive creams, not real results. Now, I do the opposite inside out and results show and I have very happy with it.</li>
    <li> I love this oil. I bought my bottle through groupon about a year ago. I mostly use it on my face+hands as moisturizer, occasionally I will use it on my feet, elbows, and hair as well. My bottle is still 1/3rd full so it lasts a LONG time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is a wonderful moisturizer. My skin is prone to pimples and blackheads and I was nervous that using an oil to moisturize would cause problems but I have had no problems from this product. I love the smooth, radiant effect I get from this oil on my face. Two pumps is enough for my face and what is left on my hands I rub in{to my hands} afterwards. I no longer get dry cuticles/hangnails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very pleased with pura d&#x27;or argan oil and I will continue using it and buy  more when this bottle is empty. I highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> I really like this product so far.  I&#x27;m a 58 year old female and have an olive complexion.  It absorbs quickly and does not appear greasy. I&#x27;m a skier and outside in the cold often.  This product takes away the dryness and seems to even out my skin tone.  It appears to reduce my wrinkles and I do follow up with a tinted moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;I do make sure the argan oil is thoroughly absorbed first before applying my make-up in order to receive the maximum benefit.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried another brand listed as one of Amazon&#x27;s best sellers. I find pura d&#x27;or to be better absorbed. Also, the smell is not as strong. I am acne prone, and find this oil not clogging my pores or causing blemishes. It&#x27;s a light moisturizer that I can use during the day. I am new to Argan oil so I really didn&#x27;t know what to expect. I just bought this based on the reviews. I&#x27;ve been using this for a few weeks now, and my skin feels less oily and more balanced. As for hair, I&#x27;ve only used a little bit on the ends. The oil has made more remarkable improvement on my skin than my hair. I wouldn&#x27;t discredit the oil though, because my hair is beyond help.</li>
    <li> Very little goes a long way - she loves the aroma and feel that the oil provides and lasts a long time.</li>
    <li> Its a good oil to use on face to get that natural smooth shiny skin. I am a male and I started using this instead of an aftershave. Leaves the skin smooth and soft. This oil is not really oily, it really gets absorbed quickly but keeps the luster long enough.&lt;br /&gt;Its a little expensive - $23 a bottle.</li>
    <li> I love this product.  It is oil but when I put it on, it always goes right into complete absorbation into my skin.  Never greasy after application.  I use this all over my body.  Been using this for a while and it has paid off.  I am in my late 50&#x27;s and people always think I am in my 30&#x27;s.  I&#x27;ll take that compliment any day.</li>
    <li> This is a great product.  This winter has been terrible and my family has suffered more than usual from dry skin.  Many lotions and oils leave you feeling greasy, but this argan oil soaks in so quickly that I can use it without the oiliness remaining for more than a few minutes.  We have tried other brands but they smelled funny.  This one has a very faint scent which is not a turn off at all.  Give it a try.</li>
    <li> First I am not Charles but his wife who has very thick, curly, wavy and dry hair. I have always used combo shampoo and conditioners for moisture but have recently purchased this and have never had such soft and tamed down hair! I use 4 pumps just on the lower half of my hair after shampoo when it is still wet. I&#x27;ve used it on dry but have not had the same results.    Then icing on the cake I have tried it on my face and neck, mostly expecting to break out, I am 55 years old and I never use anything on my face because I break out with anything!!!!  Two weeks now twice daily and not one black head or break out. I have noticed lines on my upper lip and neck decrees and my skin is so soft.    I can only wish the same results for everyone.</li>
    <li> This is a fabulous, multi-use product!  I have used argan oil on my hair but never thought about using it as a skin moisturizer.  I now use this argan oil as my nighttime face moisturizer.  When I awake in the morning, my skin is so soft and smooth.  I also use it on my hands and I have seen a noticeable improvement with my otherwise dry cuticles. This is far better than the &amp;#34;other&amp;#34; argan oil product I had been using on my hair.  This product leaves my hair silky smooth and soft that I can&#x27;t help running my fingers through my hair!  Be careful not to use too much of the oil at one time -- it is deceiving how little you need.  Don&#x27;t think twice about purchasing this oil.  Just do it and start reaping the benefits!</li>
    <li> Only a small amount required to really help with hangnails and damaged cuticles. Even though at first I thought this bottle would run out quickly, this size will last easily 2+ years.</li>
    <li> My skin loves this oil!  I just place a few drops on my palms and work into my face/neck.  The oil is instantly absorbed without the greasy feel.  Leaves the skin looking and feeling great.  I&#x27;m buying more for my mother-in-law who also loved this after seeing how good my skin looks and giving it a try.  We&#x27;re both hooked.  Thanks Pura D&#x27;or for such a great product!!</li>
    <li> Product effectiveness: It leaves your skin feeling soft. However, it has an oily feel after application. So, I would recommend applying it at night. Wake up in the morning with a baby soft skin.&lt;br /&gt;If you do apply it during the day, the effect would last for about 6 hours or so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Packaging: The item was very neatly wrapped in bubble paper given it comes in a glass bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ease of use: The pump helps greatly to get peanut size amount in palms.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Price: At about $30, it would be a steal. But given its current price (~40), it seems a bit overpriced.</li>
    <li> I purchased one at home not knowing it wasn&#x27;t 100% argan oil, this one is. I can tell the difference, the other is more silky and not as &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; of a fragrance, this one is more &amp;#34;organic&amp;#34; feeling not man made to feel smooth and silky, I think I also like the way this one feels in my hair and makes my hair feel more so than the other one. I also like that I can use this one on my face, whereas you can&#x27;t the other one.</li>
    <li> I use it after my shower every morning.  Love the way it makes my skin feel.  Not greasy at all... after 5 minutes I&#x27;m able to apply my makeup and my skin is moisturized buy not oily.  Great stuff!</li>
    <li> best bang for your buck. nice light feel, no odor.</li>
    <li> Bought this to add as a carrier oil while applying YL essential oils as my daily skin care regime. I have been using the Argan oil for about a month and my skin is so smooth and the &amp;#34;parenthesis&amp;#34; wrinkles around the corner of my mouth (that were there when NOT smiling;)  ) have become less noticeable and the dark circles under my eyes are lighter. So excited to see what other improvements I will continue to see!</li>
    <li> I am always on the lookout for organic moisturizers. I try to stay away from conditioners and shampoos that contain sulfates, parabens and phosphates. This oil is really nice. Does wonders for my hair.</li>
    <li> Great for smoothing hair, on dry skin, the face, cuticles &amp; nails! Can&#x27;t find anything it hasn&#x27;t helped so far!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this on my face at night, and it is pretty much awesome. It&#x27;s oil, so it&#x27;s a bit greasy, but by the morning, my face feels amazing.</li>
    <li> Great stuff! Comes in a glass bottle.  No added fragrances, etc. it&#x27;s the real deal.  Definitely worth it!</li>
    <li> This product is not expensive and works very well. I use it as a face massage oil. My face wrinkles stretches well and gets some glow.</li>
    <li> Love it!  I cover my whole body and it sinks right in....</li>
    <li> Works great. Non-comedogenic and moisturizes extremely well.</li>
    <li> This oil is good quality, however, it was leaking all over the box when it arrived. The pump doesn&#x27;t seem to fit the bottle tightly and about 20% had leaked out. Fortunately, there was nothing else in the box.</li>
    <li> I purchased the Pura d&#x27;or 100%Pure USDA Organic Argan oil and I really love it. I really works well on my skin. I use it on my face as a moisturizer and I just love it. It doesn&#x27;t break my face or my skin out. I use it on other areas of my body also. I ordered another brand that was a few dollars cheaper and it broke my chest out. So now I have switched back to the Pura d&#x27;or 100% Pure &amp; USDA Organic Argan oil and wouldn&#x27;t go back to the other brands. Thanks for such a great product.</li>
    <li> I have horrible eczema/very sensitive skin and tried &amp;#34;Pura d&#x27;or 100% Pure &amp; USDA Organic Argan Oil&amp;#34; (4 fl. oz.) For Face, Hair, Skin and Nails - don&#x27;t even need the steroid ointments anymore. Cleared it up within a few days, not greasy and absorbs right into your skin.</li>
    <li> I like many was skeptical in trying a product with such high claims but was happily surprised by what a difference this made, I used this on my hands where I often got dry skin from the cold and after I began using this I noticed that I didn&#x27;t even have to worry about using lotions at night, my skin also just looks more alive, this stuff is worth every penny!</li>
    <li> I Use argon oil on my hair.  I was using another brand purchased from Amozon and wasn&#x27;t getting the softness I got from the Josie Maron product I purchased from Sephora, so I was a little wary about trying anther online brand. If you&#x27;re not getting the results you want then the lower price isn&#x27;t worth it. I took a chance and ordered this product. And I&#x27;m glad I did...leaves my hair soft just like the more expensive Josie Maron product and I&#x27;m getting a lot more product. I would definitely reorder this product.</li>
    <li> i have a very sensitive scalp so many shampoos and conditioners cause irritation and itching that and the weather here in oklahoma is so intense its either one extreme or the other no spring or fall it seems, so i tried a few different brands here and there but they tend to leave tons of dandruff and strange scents. i have been using this brand for a few weeks now and it has helped so far plus there is no weird odor to scare off any pretty girls that may be around at the time ;)</li>
    <li> This product is truly amazing. I&#x27;ve used morroccan oil in the past, but I prefer this. My hair seems to absorb it better, and the results are fantastic. It seems as though the longer I use this product, the better my hair, body skin and face are looking. Absolutely no greasy residue, as long as I only use it on damp hair. This the best of the best in my personal experience using this Argan Oil. My sister is getting the same results I am and she uses it all the time like me.</li>
    <li> I have just started using this product and think it is amazing!!!  I have struggled for a long time with dry skin on my elbows and knees and regular lotion didn&#x27;t help. A friend of mine told me about this product and how much it helped her, so I gave it a try.  I am sooo glad I did.  I put just a small amount on my dry spots, and within seconds the roughness is gone. and my skin feels smooth and soft, plus it smells wonderful.</li>
    <li> I love Argan Oil, and this is one of the best brands. I use it for my hair, skin, and nails, and I can see a real change. The changes started subtly at first, but I&#x27;ve seen an improvement in my skin especially -- it has a glow and brightness that it didn&#x27;t have before. It seems the oil brings out the best in your natural beauty. I use it once a day, at night, for my skin and every time I wash my hair. My hair definitely feels softer to the touch and is easier to style (I have naturally curly hair). The price is great, because it really is a high-quality product and I can tell it is natural and unrefined.</li>
    <li> If you have very, very long hair, I highly recommend this product!  I use this argan oil on my hair, and since I&#x27;ve been laying out in the sun tanning, my legs.  It&#x27;s absolutely wonderful.  My hair is over three feet long, and so the ends are very dry, but this oil brings it back to life and makes it as pretty and shiny at the ends as it is at the roots.  It also makes it a lot softer, and gets rid of that nasty straw texture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you tan, I recommend it as well.  I didn&#x27;t realize I could use it on my legs until recently, but it works very well for ashy legs, and brings out a great golden brown color from my tan, without appearing oily.  It really soaks into the skin well and makes your skin feel really good, and baby smooth, no more rough patches.  And speaking of rough patches, it&#x27;s great for the bottom of my feet too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I love that it&#x27;s fair trade and organic, as well, since I like to do everything I can for sustainability and the environment.  I&#x27;ve been buying organic for quite a while now, and I find that most of these organic products are actually better for my hair and skin than the products I was using previously.  So many pluses to this product, I really can&#x27;t find anything I don&#x27;t like about it.  Worth every penny.</li>
    <li> This product is wonderful. It moisturized my extremely dry skin well.  You only need to put a drop on and rub it in. It is absorbed quickly into the skin. I have sensitive skin and did not have problems with it. I used it on my face as well as my body. I was afraid of breakouts, but did not have any issues at all. I did not notice any scent at all.</li>
    <li> Bought this and started using immediately, I love how smooth it makes my skin feel, I use it as a moisturizer and its great.</li>
    <li> Normally pure and organic Argon oil can run you a pretty penny, but I&#x27;m glad i found it for such a great price. My wife uses it religiously and, while I usually don&#x27;t notice small changes, i was surprised to see how great her skin and hair looks. She&#x27;s tried various brands, but this one is the best found she&#x27;s found, and i am thrilled about the price. Also, she&#x27;s stopped complaining about how crappy her hair looks, which is a plus for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With all the rave reviews from my wife, i started getting curious, so i tried it on my hair. I can only say that I&#x27;ve been getting compliments from a lot of people. I may have to borrow some more from my wife, or just buy my own bottle.</li>
    <li> I have curly hair and this is the easiest way to take care of it and cure the fly-aways while giving great shine. I have waist length hair one bottle lasts about 2 months( using 6 pumps of oil).</li>
    <li> With all of the expected benefits, I expected this oil to have a heavier feel.  However, it has a light texture and light scent which makes it especially pleasant for summer use.  I am very happy to have found this product!</li>
    <li> I have used the Josie Maran argan oil in the past, but tried this one since it was also USDA organic argan oil but at a fraction of the price.  It is the exact same product!  I can use this for a solid 4 months as a daily moisturizer so you really can&#x27;t beat it- it also makes my skin baby soft!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m so happy I found this product in Amazon. I was originally buying 1oz bottles of organic argan oil for more than half of this price. I use the oil for so many things it was almost pointless to keep spending the money. I love this stuff so much, I can&#x27;t even accurately describe it. Fast shipping, secure packaging, and a worthwhile product. Please don&#x27;t change anything about this product!!</li>
    <li> This is great for mature, dry skin and hair. Not too greasy and a little goes a long way.  Nice on legs after shaving.  Organic product that will not add to toxic load in the body.  We have also used it to help tame the curly hair of our 2 yr old grand daughter.  A nice product for health conscious people.</li>
    <li> I have naturally oily/combination skin. Im not sure how its possible to have dry flakes while being quite oily (T zone area), but that&#x27;s my skin. I have spent $100&#x27;s of dollars on skin care lines and tools for the face and after a while I gave up and went to a dermatologist who said I didn&#x27;t need all of that &amp;#34;junk&amp;#34; and just to start using something like Cetaphil facial cleanser and a decent moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I decided after a while to go au&#x27; natural and only wash my face with a hot wash cloth and use Purad&#x27;or argan oil... and voila! My skin is supple, noticeably softer, less breakouts and bonus, my make up goes on like a dream over this stuff! It took about 3 weeks for me to start seeing a difference, but my redness around my nose/cheeks faded and fine lines have lessened. It seems odd at first putting  oil on your face but this stuff absorbs pretty quickly and sort of feels like a nightly spa treatment! :)</li>
    <li> The product arrived not only in a timely fashion, but it was very well packaged and I received it in perfect conditions.&lt;br /&gt;I have recently been suffering from dry skin patches and dry hair. I have been applying this product to my face for the last week and it has done a world of difference. It does not clog the pores or feel heavy on the skin and my dry patches are gone.&lt;br /&gt;I also use this product on the ends of my hair throughout the week. It helps to keep the hair moisturized without making it oily. It is amazing how hydrated it feels without being greasy or weighing it down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will definitely be ordering this product again!</li>
    <li> highly disappointed...by seeing soo many positive reviews i ordered dis nd am soo xcited to use it,nd  today i received this item nd when i opened it,it was too watery substance and i just ot doubt nd poured one drop on my palm nd the oil was nt in a golden colour,it was pure white in coulour.what to say...i wont recommend dis....literally disappointed..and nw am about to return dis..</li>
    <li> My wife had switched to this product from regular stuff . She love this product &amp; we ended ordering a lot more</li>
    <li> I puts it on my hands, my face, my hair, it&#x27;s all good all the time. I would recommend :)</li>
    <li> Leaves my skin with a glow but not greasy. My hair is super shiny and the ends are no longer brittle. .. I will always have a supple on hand...</li>
    <li> It got rid of my stretch marks! I was full of them and it definitely hit my self-esteem but thanks to this oil, I have clear and beautiful skin! So happy!!</li>
    <li> Love how this oil makes my skin so smooth but not greasy.  I usually apply the oil after a shower and like the fact that I don&#x27;t have to wait long for my skin to dry and the oil to get absorbed.</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t take but a couple days to receive my 4 oz. bottle of Pura d&#x27;or Argan Oil. Everything is exactly as described. It&#x27;s pure. Unrefined. Cold pressed. Organic. And a product of Morocco. This is a trusted brand. They also make shampoo products using argan oil. But I just wanted the essential oil to start massaging into my scalp 2 to 3 times a week. I was looking for natural ways to help my hair continue growing and reduce balding. After researching I found that argan oil would be the best thing to use. The bottle is a perfect size and even has a little squirt spout so you don&#x27;t end up making a mess pouring it out as with other bottles. Trust me. Go with this product. It&#x27;s the most affordable and like I said, the best bang for your buck!</li>
    <li> This is one of the nicest Argan Oils I&#x27;ve used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First of all, this stuff is nearly odorless. Straight out of the bottle, it has a very subtle, faint smell that reminds me of cedar wood chips. It&#x27;s slightly nutty. It doesn&#x27;t smell foul or off putting though, it&#x27;s very fresh, which is good for a beauty product. Any smell disappears upon application. Other oils I&#x27;ve used in the past were far more pungent and nutty, while this one is not. I have a feeling that the dark glass bottle helps a lot with that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this for my hair. I typically use coconut oil because it&#x27;s cheaper, but it&#x27;s really just too heavy to leave in the hair. (I have fine, thin hair) I can only use coconut oil as a mask that I plan to wash out. THIS argan oil however, I can leave in my hair all day. I use this like how you would use a frizz serum. It makes my hair way shinier than any serum, and of course I don&#x27;t have to worry about any build up or my hair getting weighed down. Argan oil is always my favorite for hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is the dispenser. I&#x27;m glad it has one rather than an eye dropper. I can&#x27;t understand why eye droppers are used for this with other brands. However, despite liking that it has a dispenser, it&#x27;s not a very good one. It really spits out the oil. I accidentally squirted all over my shirt when I first used it. I can only describe it like the dispenser is too strong for such a light liquid. I&#x27;d like to see them improve on that so that I can better control how much product I&#x27;m using. That&#x27;s the only reason why I rank this at 4 stars. Perfect, high quality, fresh oil. Nice dark glass bottle. Dispenser needs some help.</li>
    <li> This is my 2nd bottle. I put it on my face, neck and chest at night. I have extremely sensitive skin and this has never caused any sort of rash or breakout. I&#x27;ve always used safe products, but after having my son and breast feeding, I was even more careful. This oil kept my skin and hair happy all throughout my pregnancy and while breast feeding.  I also use it on my damp hair after I wash it. I have long hair and use a few pumps to cover the lower half. I scrunch it up to let the oil really absorb into my hair. Then, when my hair is dry, if it is looking a bit frizzy, I put a pump or two into the ends and also the frizzy part that borders my forehead. I bought this for my mother and she really liked it as well. I tried another brand that worked well on my hand, but I couldn&#x27;t get past the sour smell that it had. Pura d&#x27;or has a subtle, nutty smell that doesn&#x27;t bother my sensitive sense of smell at all.</li>
    <li> I use this every night as my routine moisturizer (after I clean all my layers of makeup off.) Acne is something I&#x27;ve struggled with for MANY years and this stuff is amazing!! It calms down my irritated, combination, broken-out skin. I would suggest letting this oil soak into your skin for at least an hr (or more) before bedtime though... And in the morning, your skin will be glowing. I&#x27;m absolutely hooked!</li>
    <li> One of the best products I have ever purchased. Has helped my skin tremendously!!</li>
    <li> I received a free sample of the Josie Maran oil and loved what it did for my skin! However, the cost was a drawback. I was pleased to find this product at such a great price. I love that it is organic, light, &amp; feels good on my skin. I have noticed that my complexion is getting more even. Now, the price has dropped even more! I highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> I read in a review that the argon oils differ and so I decided to try this one and sure enough there was a difference in them. This one is the better of the other one I purchased and the best of all the ones my mother and cousin got that the local Sally&#x27;s store. I had to explain to them it wasn&#x27;t pure argon oil like this one as the one they purchased was mostly silicone from a silicone base. This one has a light scent and the color is a slight amber. It also glides on better than the other one I previously purchased. I use it in my hair and it is a amazing. It is also my face moisturizer and I haven&#x27;t decided what else to use it for but I am sure I will come up with a few things. Bottom line, I love this product and this brand is very good.</li>
    <li> I got this oil after reading the reviews of other buyers.&lt;br /&gt;I applied it on my face and saw the difference the next morning.&lt;br /&gt;I am now a regular user of this oil as it moisturizes my skin nicely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used it on my cracked heels at night and the next day morning I could see the positive results.&lt;br /&gt;This is  a big hit and affordable.</li>
    <li> I have heard about argon oil and bought this one. I use it for my hair and face. I have always had problems with acne so the thought of using oil on my face would make it more oily. However, it wasn&#x27;t! With this I have less breakouts and more even complexion. VERY GOOD!</li>
    <li> I do think this product is worth 5 stars even at the full price, but it&#x27;s a load of stars at the $20-$25 I have paid on Social sites like Groupon/Daily Steals/Living Social/etc.  It is excellent for my face (zits), wonderful for the nails, and it helps a ton for my husbands psoriasis.  I would not pay the $$$$$ here on Amazon, but for the very cheap pricing on other sites when the deals come, I stock up because while it lasts a LONG time which makes its value even on Amazon worth it, it&#x27;s tough to pay the higher price after being able to get it at the lower pricing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall a GRADE A and perfect product, but $$$$$ wise, consider how long it lasts for one thing, and stock up when you find it cheaper on social sites.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope this helps some!</li>
    <li> Fantastic product. Worked wonders for my dry brittle hair. I now use it on my daughters hair. Also, a little goes a long way with this product so dont be discouraged by the four oz.&lt;br /&gt;This also works great for your face as well. I put it on right after a shower when my pores are open and it makes my skin feeel like silk.&lt;br /&gt;I will use nothing else!</li>
    <li> This product is just amazing, Used it on most days this winter since my face gets really dry, I have very dry skin, and this does the job.&lt;br /&gt;Its great to know that I can use something other then those creams I got from Macy&#x27;s for men which cost me $100 every winter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Best thing ever for dry skin!</li>
    <li> Have been really looking for something for my mom and i bought this awhile ago and it worked great! Will give it a try myself! Will definitely update and tell you how it works from my own point of view. my mom loves it though! Thanks so much!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve just started recently using this product on my face and can already tell a difference.  My skin is softer, less noticeable fine lines, and the ashiness is almost all gone.  I have friends who use it for their hair, so I&#x27;ll have to try that next!</li>
    <li> Used this for a month and simply love it. It&#x27;s well made and you can feel it. It helps relieve the dry skin and look your best. Recommend this to others.</li>
    <li> Having used many products to treat my overly dry hair and not having much sucess. I used this product and much to my delight it greatly improved the texture of my hair. I am very happy to have tried this product and happily recommend it to anyone.[[ASIN:B004Z209HS Pura D&#x27;or Pure &amp; Organic Argan Oil (4 fl. oz.)]]</li>
    <li> Redness on my face has almost completely disappeared. I&#x27;ve tried numerous other products and this is by far the best.</li>
    <li> I have tried many different types of Moroccan Argan Oil, and this one is the best for its price. It soaks into my skin without any oil residue and leaves me skin feeling so soft and smooth. This is great for the winter months when my skin gets so dry. My skin is prone to break outs too, but I&#x27;ve never had a break out with this product. I will be coming back for more!</li>
    <li> I just tried it for the first time last night and my face and hands feels so much smoother already.  I have horribly dry skin in the winter!  I&#x27;ll definitely be using this every day and will update review later.</li>
    <li> I just bought my first bottle of Argan oil based on all the great things I&#x27;ve heard it could do.  I like how it has a pump so the oil doesn&#x27;t get contaminated.  The oil initially does leave a slight oily residue on the skin right after application but after several minutes the greasy shine diminishes.  I can&#x27;t wait to see how much my skin will improve over time in using this product.</li>
    <li> Pura D&#x27;or is definitely the shad-iest company. It uses its many accounts to post F.A.K.E for its own products. Most of reviews on Pura D&#x27;or products are F.A.K.E. It also posts F.A.K.E reviews on many high ranking products on Amazon to promote its S.C.A.M hair loss prevention shampoo and argan oil. It also uses its many accounts to post negative reviews for its competitors&#x27; products. Even more sham-eless-ly, it uses its many accounts to vote the negative reviews of its competitors&#x27; products \\&quot;helpful\\&quot; to make the negative reviews show on the top.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All the reviews below were posted around the same time.

    <li> I was using 3 types of oil in the past &#x3D; Premium EVOO,Jojoba oil, &amp; Argan oil of other companies.&lt;br /&gt;Let me tell you folks; the color of those Argan Oil&#x27;s more like an amber hue,not a pale yellow tint.&lt;br /&gt;The absorption of this product is the absolute worst.&lt;br /&gt;It would stay whole day shining like I&#x27;m a bronze statue.&lt;br /&gt;Premium Extra Virgin Olive oil ($55 per 500ml) absorbed by my skin immediately,  with worm, nourishing sensation. This Argan Oil giving me greasy filling with an etching sensation. I&#x27;m more than aware how mush to apply on each part of my face after 6 years using this oils to moisturize my skin!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After only 3 days of using this product, my face became pink like after the sunburn,plus I&#x27;ve got 7 tiny zits,plus my skin become so dry ...its&#x27; like this oil drained down all my youth.&lt;br /&gt;Run from this product,girls,run!!!</li>
    <li> I loved this oil. I don&#x27;t get any breakout when using this argan oil. It also make skin very very soft.</li>
    <li> Pura d&#x27;or Argan Oil is the best oil I have ever tried. I have exceedingly sensitive and dry skin, and other oils I have tried are either irritating, or just too thick to use and clog my pores. Pura d&#x27;or Argan Oil smoothes on evenly and soaks into my skin, leaving it soft and pliable, with absolutely no bad side effects like blotchy skin or itching. It is fabulous alone, and absolutely perfect under the light foundation I use. It helps the cosmetic cover the blemishes and also seems to make it last longer. Hours later, my skin still looks \\&quot;fresh.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also tried it on my hair, simply by taking what little remained on the palm of my hands and scrunching up my curls with them. It brought a luster and bounce to them that made them look like very happy curls. So I&#x27;m pleased with the Pura d&#x27;or hair results. I also put some on my legs, which were looking rather dry....and the dryness left and has not returned. This oil is Morocco&#x27;s gift to the world, and Pura d&#x27;or is the brand to buy. Organic, 100% pure, and sold in a dark brown bottle (never buy this oil in clear bottles). The aroma is also fresh...and not strong...it&#x27;s an indescribable aroma, quite unlike anything, but very pleasant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like that it comes in a pump bottle. Just make sure you pump into your palm, and not onto a finger! It has a small aperture, but it comes out of the spout in a hurry, and will go beyond your finger...and you don&#x27;t want to waste a single drop of this precious oil! Thank you Pura d&#x27;or for this great product. I have searched long for a good oil, and this Argan Oil really is like finding pure gold.</li>
    <li> This product is just great for your hair and skin. My hair is so moisturize and so is my skin. Highly recommended</li>
    <li> The first time I used it, I used it on freshly showered wet hair.&lt;br /&gt;I think i used too much of it, so my hair was a bit oily, but even then omg it felt amazing.&lt;br /&gt;I have always had very dry, brittle, coarse, thick hair.&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t think that it would ever be possible to fix this. This has \\&quot;fixed\\&quot; my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also tried it on dry hair before I straighten my hair, and I don&#x27;t thnk I will ever have to use heat protectant again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is an A++++++ and I am truly in love.&lt;br /&gt;good price. good value. good product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will buy again!!!!</li>
    <li> It took only a couple minutes to see an immediate effect of using this product.  My face is glowing and I look so healthy when I use it.  I suffer from dark circles and puffy eyes consistently and I can&#x27;t believe how well this product attacks these symptoms.  Only a couple pumps for face, neck and chest.  Thank you for creating such an amazing product.  I&#x27;m hooked!</li>
    <li> I have really wavy/curly frizzy hair and this product leaves my hair so shiny and smooth! I have had the keratin treatment in the past and this leaves my hair in even nicer condition and is all organic!! Love this product!!</li>
    <li> THIS IS A DELIGHTFUL PRODUCT.  EXQUISITE EXOTIC FRAGANCE.  OIL IS NOT HEAVY AT ALL.&lt;br /&gt;IT PENETRATES FULLY.  I USE IT VERY FREQUENTLY ANYWHERE ON MY BODY.  I WOULD SAY PURA D&#x27;OR IS THE BEST BRAND OF ARGAN OIL.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a moisturizer which had no harmful chemicals, but one which also works well! I have aging skin, as I am past 50, so I wanted something which would have a lasting and positive effect on my skin. I chose Pura d&#x27;or Argan oil because my hairdresser has been using argon oil on my hair for the past few years, with very good results.&lt;br /&gt;This oil is wonderful. It has a pleasant but not overpowering scent, and the easy to use pump makes measuring a snap. I pump twice for each leg and arm, mixing with a few drops water. I have been using the oil for about 3 months after each shower, and I still have about 1/3 bottle left. The oil is absorbed quickly, and your skin is not in any way greasy after applying. I do not apply the oil to my face because I have oily t-zone, but I think it would probably be fine for dry skin.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this oil! I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars because of the expense, but I have found a way to make it last!</li>
    <li> So far, so good. My skin feels and looks a lot better.</li>
    <li> I love Pura D&#x27;Or argan oil.  It is midpriced, when compared to the cheap, raw stuff and the fancy, super-processed stuff.  It works beautifully.  I use it to treat my scalp and hair (reduced itch, great shine) and on my aging facial skin (keeps it fresh) and areas of skin inflammation (soothes and clears).  The Pura D&#x27;Or brand smells fabulous but is not overpowering.  I ordered through Amazon because I knew I&#x27;d get the quick, efficient shipping, product satisfaction and customer service that Amazon always provides.</li>
    <li> I just use a very small amount and there is much more shine and bounce to my hair. Be aware, putting more than two drops of this can make your hair look very oily. This bottle will go a very long way!</li>
    <li> I LOVE this product.  This is my first time using Argon oil and now I am passing this on to my friends and family.  I use it for my very dry skin, especially during this cold winter.  Daily I am using it on my face, mixing it with a drop of frankincense essential oil.  When I run in the cold winter weather I have been using it on my face and it helps prevent windburn.  I will definitely keep ordering this product.</li>
    <li> This oil arrived today and I couldn&#x27;t wait to apply it to my aging skin.  The oil soaked right in.  My skin instantly hydrated.  Love this.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product, I&#x27;ve been using it for years to keep my hair soft and shiny without harsh chemicals and a getting a greasy end result. I&#x27;ll continue to use this as long as it&#x27;s around! Couldn&#x27;t be more pleased with the service and quality of the company as well!</li>
    <li> I was disappointed with this product and gave it away.  It did not do as good a job as Moroccan Oil.</li>
    <li> This Argan Oil is an amazing product! I use it everyday for my hair to add shine and to eliminate frizz. I have thick, curly hair and this completely controls the frizz without being too greasy. I also use it every night to hydrate my skin, and it feels great!</li>
    <li> Fantastic for many uses- pure moisture with great results! I use it on my face, hands, neck. Feels fab - plus it is pure nature at its best</li>
    <li> I love it. My face stays moisturized all day. The most important part is that it is oil but doesn&#x27;t make your skin oily, it absorbs magnificently i can apply my make up right after :-) ♡</li>
    <li> I love this.  I put it on after a shower and let it set in before putting on clothes.  I also use it after I wash my hands as I do frequently throughout the day.  I am allergic to many scented lotions and some oils and have no issues with the organic Argan oil.  I recommended this to my mother as she has allergies as well.  My skin feels smooth and hydrated.  I will continue to purchase this oil.</li>
    <li> My hands are always exposed to the elements and I&#x27;m one of those people who wash my hands throughout the day.  I can never put lotion on that doesn&#x27;t get washed off within an hour.  I started keeping my bottle of oil on the kitchen counter and when I see it I use it.  I&#x27;ve been massaging it into my nails too and have also noticed a change.  They are less dried out as are my hands.  I definitely recommend for hands and nails!</li>
    <li> A friend of mine told me the benefitsof argan oil,so I searched on amazon and tried this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve purchased many items from amazon, but this is one of the very best that I value and love using every day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use it after bath / shower to apply to my body and face before drying myself off. Then I dry off with a bath towel. I also apply some to my hair while still wet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The result is smooth skin and easy-to-manage hair. I love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also carry some in a tiny cosmetic bottle so I can apply to my finger tips when they feel dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m using my second bottle now and I&#x27;m going tocontinue to use it. This product goes beyond my expectation and I am very happy.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for a couple of months now and absolutely love it.  I ordered it because I wanted something organic to keep my skin moist to help prevent stretch marks.  It is not greasy at all and I use it all over.  Before I started using the Purador my belly itched from the stretching skin and it does not anymore.  I also use it for my hair and love how well it works to smooth my frizz. :)</li>
    <li> This product really works -- makes my hair thicker, silkier, and shinier.  I have naturally fine curly hair and couldn&#x27;t wear it past my collar bone.  I can now wear it longer, as the oil has made it fuller especially on the ends.  My rather famous hairdresser who works with numerous &amp;quot;stars&amp;quot; agrees my hair is in much better shape after I started using this.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this stuff! I use it on my face and hair.  Excellent product.</li>
    <li> UPDATE: After having this product a couple months I am updating my original comment. My face broke out terribly after about a month of use and it took about a month for my skin to finally recover.  I still use it for my hair but it you have skin that is sensitive and prone to break out I would proceed with caution usIng this product as a facial moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ORIGINAL: I originally was looking for a less processed argon oil to use for my hair. I saw a lot of great reviews and saw many people mentioning using the product on their faces. I am in my mid 30&#x27;s and have always had problems with acne so the thought of using oil on my face made me uneasy. But, I love this stuff!!! Using it about a month now I have minimal breakouts, more even complexion, and soft hair. I highly recommend.</li>
    <li> My husband purchased this product for me and told me he heard many wonderful things about it. I was skeptical at first but once I used it for 5 days my skin has become more softer and healthy looking. When I first applied it to my face it felt nice and not greasy. It only takes 2 drop (roughly the size of a dime) to cover my face and under my chin area. I don&#x27;t think I can go back to plain old night cream or lotion again.</li>
    <li> Have been using for a little over a month.  I use it on my hair, face and nails.  Leaves my hair soft and no frizz! My cuticles have never been better.  I use it as a nighttime face moisturizer. A little goes a long way!  Will definitely buy again!</li>
    <li> I had used a different brand of argan oil before...much more expensive and a smaller bottle! Purchased this to see if there was a difference to justify higher price for costlier brand. Results...this oil is absolutely no different. Very clear oil and VERY moisturizing! Will definitely be buying this brand again!</li>
    <li> Love this brand, This Argan Oil is very light and effective, use it on my body and hair and it leave both feeling GREAT!!!!</li>
    <li> Package came on time from Amazon. I have been battling skin cancer for quite some time which has left my skin very dry. This oil is amazing has my skin is now smooth and moist after one month of use. While my skin cancer has not gone away, I seem to be having less spots appearing. Still have to get the Blue light treatments once a year.</li>
    <li> This is really the best oil I have ever used. I am using it on my face and hair!! I am going to tell all of my friends about it.</li>
    <li> Love argan oil!  Use it on my hands and feet, especially during the winter.  Great as a leave-in for my hair.  The smell gets a little bit getting used to, but i add lavender oil drops and its yummy :-)</li>
    <li> I bought this argon oil because I was looking for a hair product to smooth my wavy/frizzy hair.  I saw the positive reviews of people using this for hair and face. I had heard argon oil was good stuff from a beautician so I clicked &amp;#34;buy&amp;#34;.  I am very sensitive to creams/products with smells so I was prepared to have some sort of reaction from this oil but in fact I did not.  My face soaked it up and it left me feeling good about my purchase.  I tried it on my hair and it did tame it down a bit.  It has only been a few days so if anything changes I will update.  I like the fact it is natural, no added chemicals, and oil goes a long way so it is economical too.</li>
    <li> I just received my Argan Oil today by Pura d&#x27;or! I have really dry hands and cuticles from doing dishes all the time for my family. The downside of cooking all the time is you have to clean up the mess! I put a little of the argan oil on my hands, nail beds, and cuticles. I had instant moisture back in my hands and the itchiness went away! I also tried it out as a face moisturizer too and I love how it makes my skin feel so smooth without the greasiness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m really excited to try it on my daughters mosquito bite scar on her face to see if it helps the redness disappear as well.</li>
    <li> Completely cleared up my dry cracked skin within 5 days of using. In addition it completely cleared the acne redness and inflammation that I chronically have. This is the best stuff for your skin, I especially use it on my face and dry patches on my body.</li>
    <li> I bought this oil after coveting the Josie Maran oil, which I had tried at Sephora.  I searched online for a similar quality product and there are a lot of inferior, cheap, possible inauthentic oils out there.  I am relieved and happy that Pura d&#x27;Or is the real thing and glad I got it for $19.99 here instead of $96 for the Josie Maran at this size.    I try different oils (Kiehl&#x27;s midnight, Caudalie divine oil, coconut for eye makeup remover, and I&#x27;m interested in the Fresh seaberry...) and I find argan to be very rich, moisturizing and reliable. I use this for my hair, lips, cuticles, hands, feet. It soaks in completely after 5-7 minutes and leaves my skin very smooth not oily.  The scent is very mild, slightly nutty.    This would be excellent to put on before a long flight or to refresh dehydrated skin.    For allover facial use, it might be a bit heavy /oily for acne prone, or if you have very thin or oily hair. I have combination skin that gets irritated easily and dry patches in winter, so it works for me. It doesn&#x27;t cause breakouts or redness on my sensitive skin. (for oily skin in my 20s, I used Clarins Lotus face oil and it&#x27;s great, very astringent and slightly drying). I&#x27;m now in my 40s and my skin needs / can absorb more oil.  In summer humidity I may just use argan for just hands, cuticles and hair, and switch back to a lighter weight face oil, like the Kiehl&#x27;s, which is not as moisturizing + absorbs instantly.    My hair is long, full &amp; wavy but fine textured - a little of this goes a long way to shine it up, I put it just on the ends &amp; outer hair and it doesn&#x27;t make my roots oily.  I definitely like this much more than the \\&quot;moroccan oil\\&quot; hair products out there. I&#x27;ve tried expensive as well as cheap ones, I find them much too heavy for my hair, made it look greasy and was weird-smelling, + they contain silicones / chemicals.  This pure argan oil is superior and a better value.  Thank you!</li>
    <li> After Using for couple of months, I am seeing lot of difference on skin &amp; hair. Before I used to get skin dry even after using regular moisture but using this product never happened. Also hair has improved a lot. We used to have lot of split at the hair tips but with product improved a lot &amp; health hair. Excellent product.</li>
    <li> Love it! I use it daily and I&#x27;m loving how my skin looks. Also my husband has terrible dermatitis and has been using this on it and it has vanished!!!</li>
    <li> With using only 2 pups leaves the hair looking oilish.  Compared to moroccan oil i preferred the moroccan oil.  It looks more natural. Ad does not feel too oily. Also moroccan smells kind of better.</li>
    <li> My skin is usually normal and I rarely breakout, but this is my first time in the northeast and it&#x27;s been wreaking havoc on my skin. I&#x27;ve broken out 5 times in about 2 months around my chin, cheeks, and temple. I realized that my skin was extremely dehydrated and has been making up for it by producing excess sebum. I decided to counteract it by lathering my face and body with oil and lotion. I&#x27;ve been mixing one pump of Pura d&#x27;or argan oil into Aveeno moisturizing lotion in the morning and during bed time. It&#x27;s been working fantastic; absorbs fast and isn&#x27;t greasy at all. My newly developed scars are fading fast and my skin feels normal again. I appreciate that the company put a nozzle on the bottle. It&#x27;s just a bummer that it squirts out so much. I guess I don&#x27;t mind it because I just put the excess all over my body anyways. Also, I read the brown paper that came with the bottle which states that the company is a member of American Forests, Marin Organic, and Sustainable Business Alliance. I&#x27;m very impressed with their sustainability efforts.</li>
    <li> Works well with my hair. I was expecting some form of fragrance but it has none so I add a few drops of one of my essential oils to it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Agadir Argan Oil Spray Treatment for many years and I will no longer order that product. Pura d&#x27; or is thicker and not watery like Agadir. I&#x27;ve used it on wet and dry hair for about 2 weeks and love how my hair looks and feels like afterwards. It makes my hair look and feel smooth and shiny. I have also used it as a hair protectant prior to using a flat iron and it makes my hair feel and look smooth and heathy. It also has a nice scent. I agree that this product is 100% Argan Oil. I will continue to order and use this product in the future.</li>
    <li> Pura d&#x27;or is  all natural, nothing added Argan Oil.  I live in Alaska and it is very dry.  After a shower when my face is still wet I use 3 pump of Pura d&#x27;or Argan oil in my hand, rub together and then all over my face &amp; throat.  I has completely evened my skin tone and is very hydrating.  I even use it on my hands now.  I love it and will not go anywhere with out it.</li>
    <li> This oil works great on my hair. I have naturally frizzy curly hair that has been severely damaged from heat styling &amp; bleaching &amp; this product basically nursed my hair back to health. I used to have to load my hair with all kinds of product to make it look presentable &amp; now I just use a couple pumps of this baby and my hair looks amazing. However, I do not like the way it feels when applied to my skin, very heavy feeling.</li>
    <li> I live in the desert and this is a wonderful head to toe moisturizer. This brand is nice because of the pump (keeping it free from oxygen) and the slightly thinner viscosity than some other brands that I&#x27;ve tried which is better for absorption. More importantly the product is COLD PRESSED which retains the true benefits of this wonderful all natural moisturizer. It&#x27;s also cruelty free. Argan oil is great for sensitive and troubled skin like acne because it is non-comedogenic and it is an antimicrobial. I love it for my thick curly hair!!! I short I LOVE THIS PRODUCT:)</li>
    <li> Love this product ~ I not only use on my face &amp; body, but also on my naturally curly hair ~ Does not clog my pores, etc ~ Is a little costly, but definitely worth it</li>
    <li> I like the product. I use it mainly for my hair which helps healing the tips and makes my hair shining and glossy. I definitely want another bottle.</li>
    <li> Been using pura d&#x27;or argan oil for acouple of weeks now. Hair and skin feel noticeably softer without a greasy feeling. Quality argan oil at a great price. Will buy again.</li>
    <li> I have tried all the different types of oils out there from maracuja, baobab, calendula, evening primrose, jojoba but the one that I always go back to .is only Argan oil (sometimes also coconut).  There is a lot of hype about new and exotic oils.  Argan is really moisturizing, soothing and doesn&#x27;t cause any break out on my sensitive/oily skin and works very well for hair too (apply on damp, clean hair).  I love this brand the most among all the different ones I have tried.  The amount is also a lot for the money.  Definetely recommended.</li>
    <li> I wanted to love Argan Oil because of all of the hype, but I found that it did not agree with my sensitive, acne prone skin.  I would not recommend.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! I put it in my hair after getting out of the shower and its like I never had frizzy hair! It makes my hair so nice and shiny looking! Its probably great for other things as well but hair is what I use it for :)</li>
    <li> My daughter has a dry skin condition and regular lotions wear out every few hours. We tried this product based on a recommendation from a friend. We have been amazed by the result in couple of weeks of use - instead of every 3-4 hours of using lotions, we just have to use twice a day. And, you need a very little quantity since it spreads nicely. The dispenser is well designed to avoid spill. Overall, works wonder, and good value for money. Two Thumbs Up!!!</li>
    <li> I am a repeat buyer of this product,  I use it as a moisturizer for both hair &amp; skin.  I have my teenage boys use it after cleaning their faces to help moisturize because acne soaps can be harsh and the pure argan oil moisturizes without feeling greasy and it&#x27;s not full of fragrances so it seems &amp;#34;girly&amp;#34; to them.  I like this as it is pure and organic, not just some moisturizer with alot of other chemicals and only a drop of argan oil in the whole bottle.  I&#x27;m so glad I found this oil and that this seller ships so quickly.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a hydrating solution for use in my beard and hair.  After some research I had settled on either jojoba or argan oil.  I ordered both and used each for several weeks before coming to a conclusion.    Argan oil wins out by far.  It does not feel very thick at all, yet a small quantity will do an excellent job at moisturizing.  Within a day of use my beard was notably softer, as was the hair on my head.  The oil did not leave a sticky or oily feeling.  It also has a light but pleasant smell - a very faint hint of nuttiness.    I use 1 pump for my face and beard, and 2-3 for my hair - my hair is about 2.5 inches long, thick and very curly, for reference.  I ordered the bottle in late july, have been using it almost daily since the beginning of September and I still have a bit more than half the bottle left.    I have no experience with other argan oil products, in truth, but this product has met my expectations and is priced very well.  I intend to order again.</li>
    <li> Just received this and seems fine.  Consistency and smell similar to other brands I have purchased. Absorbed quickly.</li>
    <li> I absolutly love this product.  I will definetly buy again.</li>
    <li> Perfect.  Fast shipping and great product at a very good value.</li>
    <li> I have used Argan oil before but ran out.  I bought this one at the end of Dec. 2014 and started using it immediately on my skin, hair and nails.  I noticed a big difference with this product.  My skin looked better right away.  I first thought it was me, but other people commented.  I now use it instead of my serum and moisturizer (but still use organic sunblock).  My wrinkles around my eyes have gone way down, and my skin looks a lot more younger.  I have been massaging it into my cuticles as my nails are terrible.  I also dab it onto my hair, as I live in the bar area and the fog wreaks havoc on my hair!  I cannot say enough about this.  I think it works wonders.  Oh!  I started making cold-brewed coffee from the organic cotton bag that the oil comes in.  Just put a few tablespoons of medium-ground coffee in the bag (after washing in pure soap) and then put into a jar with water overnight in the refrigerator.  It&#x27;s your gift with purchase! Great products!</li>
    <li> This is most definetly my go-to moisturizer.  I apply this everywhere (face, hands, hair ends, etc.) , and the results are amazing. I find this product better that the popular Josie Maran argan oil because not only is this product less expensive, but also due to the fact that its the most legitimate argan oil product I&#x27;ve come across.</li>
    <li> I have very dry skin, to the point where i sometimes cannot put on foundation due to flakiness in some areas, now its all resolved! Thank you!!!</li>
    <li> I just received this yesterday and I love it! I can&#x27;t stop using it, I put it on my face, my body, my hair.  It works great I put a few drops in my all over body moisturizer and I put it on directly to my hair and face and it absorbs in very quickly and leaves my skin glowing and hydrated.  I look forward to getting home and using it again!  Great product I will reorder for sure!</li>
    <li> I bought this bottle when my GF knocked over her third bottle that used an eye dropper. I was surprised to find that this had a pump and its perfect for my clumsy GF. On top of the pump bonus this stuff really works. It feels way lighter on my skin than typical face lotion. I get really dry skin on my face and arms and this stuff makes life so much nicer. My dry skin is basically gone. It also has helped a lot with my dandruff.</li>
    <li> Honestly much cheaper than other moroccan oil products, but it has the same effects. I use it after showering, keeps hair soft and adds mild hold. Definitely recommended!</li>
    <li> I use it on my face every night and makes my skin so smooth in the morning! I have tried other argan oils from sephora but this one I like the best because it that doesn&#x27;t feel heavy or greasy on my skin. I&#x27;ll get another bottle again.</li>
    <li> I have purchased two bottles of this Argan Oil and I love it. I use it for my skin and as a oil hair treatment. It leaves my skin feeling smooth as well as  prolonging the effects of other skin treatments. When I use this product as a hair treatment, I&#x27;ve left it in my hair up to overnight and my hair feels silkier and shinier after washing it out with shampoo. I have not tried other brands, but see no need to look elsewhere. Thanks!</li>
    <li> This is the real stuff.  The best deal for the price.  I couldn&#x27;t be happier!  Now I can save so much money and still use the same product I&#x27;ve gotten hooked on: 100% pure argan oil.  Shipping wasn&#x27;t via Prime, but I still received it in 2 days!!!!&lt;br /&gt;Thank you so much!!</li>
    <li> Very good quality Argan Oil! I love the fact that it is USDA organic and contain absolutely ZERO GMO&#x27;s! Thank you and I will definitely be buying again!</li>
    <li> You know how people sometimes say &amp;#34;if they could bottle something that is good, they would do it&amp;#34;....well this is it!&lt;br /&gt;I have used other Argan Oil products before - some I bought online and some I just bought from drug stores - and this one is great!  It can be used for hair, face and body and I do use it, mostly on my face, arms, hands and nails, especially on my hands and nails,  before going to bed.  Now my nails and cuticles always look so healthy with no cracking and no hang nails!&lt;br /&gt;Just one or two drops go a long way...so this bottle may last for a long while.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my face and neck and love it.  I put it on before going to bed. A little goes a long way.  I like that it is not greasy and it does not have a noticeable odor.  So many night creams have scents to them and I wake up with a headache.  In the morning my face is soft.  It has smoothed out my crows feet.  It&#x27;s good to put something on my skin that is natural and not full off chemicals.</li>
    <li> I have always spent a lot of money on Josie Maran&#x27;s Organic Argan Oil , and I did love it.  I stumbled upon this on Amazon looking for a lower price for the Maran Oil.  I read the reviews, and thought I might give it a try (as a lot of reviewers compared it to the maran oil).  I found this oil to be a little lighter and not as heavy as the Maran oil.  Because of this it sinks into the skin easier and doesn&#x27;t leave the oil slick on your face. I have never used this on my hair, as my skin needs more help.  I love that it is organic and truly can&#x27;t find a big difference between it and the maran oil, except the huge markup in price for the maran oil.  I don&#x27;t mind paying $$ for quality, but refuse to pay more just to fill up someone&#x27;s pockets.  If it didn&#x27;t do the job of the Maran oil, I&#x27;d pay more.  it does and for less than half the price ?? I&#x27;m in.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for three days now, and I can honestly say that this has made my inflamed skin more calm. The first time that I used it at night before bed. When I woke up my acne had calmed down.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using argan oil for a couple of years now and I must say it works wonders for both skin and hair. Actually, one could even get away without a moisturizer when using argan oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This one is of a very good quality and has a nice pump, what makes it easy to use. The bottle is also quite big so it will last for months.</li>
    <li> It is ok! I&#x27;ve been able to use it on my face alone and mixed in with cream/lotion and it leaves my skin feeling soft and moisturized.The reason I give this product 3 stars is because I have noticed there is a minty smell to it; probably to deorderize the nutty smell that everyone likes to complain about.  Although it SHOULD have a light nutty smell to it! I think that if they added anything to it, this should be disclosed and not advertised as 100% pure argan oil.</li>
    <li> I use this stuff everyday. I used to use expensive lotions but my skin never seemed right. I bought this stuff because I&#x27;ve been hearing so much about argon oil, and I have to say the benefits were spot on. I was concerned putting oil on my face that it would make my skin oily, not at all, this soaks in and my skin is less oily than when I used lotions! My skin is clearer, softer, younger looking. Very faint wrinkles are gone, and most importantly, the small patch of Rosacea is pretty much gone. I was concerned especially with all the talk about impostor oil which brand to choose, but I have had great luck with this and I assume it&#x27;s the pure stuff. I put it on in the morning right after I shower, best if your face is damp, it soaks in better. There is a slight &#x27;nutty&#x27; smell, nothing that is noticeable at all, goes away in a minute or less. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Product arrived earlier than expected. Started using it right away been using it for past 2 weeks ans I can see the difference i have eczema patches on my forehead and now it&#x27;s completely gone. My hair is frizz free but loose volume and looks greasy sometimes. But i would highly recommend it for skin. Beautiful product with high quality.</li>
    <li> So far so good!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used this a few times on my beard and kinky hair and while I imagine this to be most nourishing over the long-term, I like the feeling of this oil in my hair, its pleasant scent, and fast absorption.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have also added a little bit to my homemade lip balms (which I&#x27;ve had several people rave about so far ;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m looking forward to more uses for this oil and plan on making my own shampoo/conditioner using it....maybe even a hand/cuticle lotion too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m very pleased!</li>
    <li> Love it love it....so many uses..check out home remedies for life web site. .</li>
    <li> I have been using this for a short while now and I love that this makes my skin feel a lot smoother than just using my regular moisturizer alone.  There&#x27;s no smell and it does not leave an oily residue.  The only thing that would have made this a 5-star review is the pump bottle.  I rather have a dropper because it gets a little messy to pump out the oil and it ends up running down the bottle.  If they make this into the dropper, it would be perfect!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Pura d&#x27;or Argan Oil for 2 years.  It&#x27;s made a huge difference in my hair and skin.  I have long hair that tends to be very dry;  after I wash it I put a small amount in the ends and it protects my hair like nothing else I&#x27;ve found.  My stylist keeps asking my what I&#x27;m doing because it&#x27;s so healthy.  My other favorite use is around my eyes.  I put a few drops around my eyes after I remove my makeup.</li>
    <li> This Argan oil is the best I&#x27;ve ever used.  I&#x27;ve tried others, believe me.  Pura d Or is the real deal.  It&#x27;s organic, cold pressed.  It&#x27;s highly absorbable.  My hair and skin has never been better.  I highly recommend this product to anyone.</li>
    <li> Argan oil is now the 5th natural oil I have tried on as skin lotion, after shea butter, coconut oil, avocado oil, and sesame oil. I&#x27;ve not tried other kinds of Argan oil but Pura d&#x27;Or has a very nice texture and pretty much odorless, which I like a lot.  I use it daily on my hair and face mainly and I also like that it doesn&#x27;t feel oily at all.  I&#x27;ve only been using it for the past three weeks or so but so far it&#x27;s given my face a nice glow without oily feel.  Though I wouldn&#x27;t stop using it because of it, the one minor con (which I am not sure it&#x27;s due to Argan oil) is that my facial hair has seemed a bit more coarse after 2-3 days unshaved.  But again, any good shaving lotion can help deal with that aspect.  So overall I think this oil is worth the buck if you can afford it</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s well to smell,good oil,useful</li>
    <li> I use this on my skin [ dry] , my nails and my hair. It gets me thru the winter when  my skin and nails are so dry. it has helped my complexion so much. Why buy a tiny bottle of Josey Morrand when you can get 4 oz so much cheaper?</li>
    <li> Wonderful, light, absorbed by skin easily and great makeup base lip and eye moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t cause breakouts!</li>
    <li> I had been using coconut oil for moisturizing and for hair for a couple of years and was happy with it, then thought to give this product a try thinking it might even be better, albeit much more expensive.  NO, not the case.  After testing it for two months, I am back with my coconut oil.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Argan Oil for about a year now and love it. I use it on my face, especially around my eyes.  Occasionally, I put it in my hair as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used Mogador and really liked it but then I got a \\&quot;deal\\&quot; at another website for Pura D&#x27;or and it is great.  I love the fact that it is a spray...I can use less than what comes out of the dropper.  It seems to go on better too.  I&#x27;m unsure as to whether I like this product better because of the spray vs. dropper or whether the oil itself is better.  But, I do know that I am very happy with the purchase and would definitely buy again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have read reviews of other Argan oils  having a weird smell and I will say that neither Pura D&#x27;or or Mogador have a weird smell.</li>
    <li> This is the first time I have used 100% Argan oil. I LOVE this. I have used it on my dry elbows and they feel like silk. My hair is shiny and I have even used this on my face. I will definitely buy this again!!!!!</li>
    <li> Love the way my hair and skin feels after putting this on. So natural</li>
    <li> Great argan oil!  I&#x27;ve been using it every day and night and my skin is a lot better than before. Thanks!</li>
    <li> I, really liked the Pura D&#x27;or Pure Oil, I, would recommend it to all age ladies.  Not only for your face,as a Moisturiser, but for your hands and keeping your feet ,especially your heels soft and pretty.</li>
    <li> I am on my second round of this product. I use this oil on my body, face, and hair. I originally found it while looking for hair and skin products that are free of harsh chemicals and animal products. This product is just what I was looking for! It&#x27;s a great alternative to the body lotion I was using that had an ingredient list 10 lines long, filled with things I can&#x27;t pronounce. I do still use a hand lotion occasionally. Also, it&#x27;s great for your face. I get the occasional breakout caused by hormones and when using this oil on my face it reduces the inflammation and the breakout clears up on it&#x27;s own. I was nervous about doing this at first because everything you ever hear about clearing breakouts involves drying them out, but it worked quite well. Although, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend using it under a foundation unless you have had a lengthy amount of time to let it soak in all the way. I use one squirt on the ends of my hair before blow-drying and a tiny amount after to smooth any frizz. Usually once a week I cover my hair with the oil and let it sit for an evening and overnight. It&#x27;s still too early to tell if it is having a effect on the overall health and thickness of my hair. But, it does make it smoother and shinier. I also put it on my nails and cuticles. The oil has a very mild scent. It&#x27;s so great to have multiple uses from one product!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this oil on my dry hair and it works great.  Also use on my hands.  Like this oil and have only one minor problem - which is that that it is difficult to find where the oil comes out because the top dispenser is black.</li>
    <li> Nice and light. However, that horse poopy smell is there. Some of these argan oils have this smell. I think it depends on the age. Josie Maron has this smell too.</li>
    <li> I usually use Josie Maran but to expensive so I switched to this and I love it more than Josie&#x27;s. Great for skin and hair.</li>
    <li> I started using this Argan oil 3-4 months ago on my face and body daily after shower. It helps my skin to keep moisturized, which is great. But recently, I had my blood biochemistry done. Although my HDL is high and LDL is low, I found that my cholesterol level is closer to the upper normal limit. That makes me wonder whether this product may have some contribution to it and whether I should cut back on using it. My diet and exercise patterns have not changed at all.  Since I haven&#x27;t have my blood tested for cholesterol for a couple of years, I&#x27;m not sure if it is due to this product. Therefore, I have this question in mind and hope that somebody out there may shine some light on this. Thank you.</li>
    <li> I have been using argan oil for a while. Recently I switched to Pura d&#x27;or 100% Pure Organic Argan Oil, I noticed it&#x27;s clearer and lighter than the previous one I used. I like how it absorbed instantly into my skin. Since I have combination skin, I only use one drop and mix it with my lotion. It gives a healthy glow and my skin feels wonderful. I have been getting compliments from people of how my skin glows. Already introduce this wonderful product to my friend. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> nothing not to like about this stuff. It is definitely pure. No fragrances no garbage. My hair feels a millions times better</li>
    <li> The smell is a little off-putting. As someone else mentioned here, it&#x27;s a little tea tree smelling but also a vague ... organic smell, similar to a very faint emu oil. I was using Josie Maran (like half of the other reviewers here apparently!) and I wanted a cheaper alternative. I think it&#x27;s a little sketchy that they advertise &amp;#34;USDA Organic&amp;#34;, but only have the certificate for another organic certification. As many who do organics know, the standards for organics is practically non-existent and can mean a lot of different things. I feel like there&#x27;s a lack of transparency with this brand which is why there&#x27;s so many &amp;#34;authentic or not?&amp;#34; comments. Perhaps if they put a face behind the product, what region you get your argan nuts from, and their production process, then more people will flock to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, as far as whether it&#x27;s the real thing and if it works- I would assume so? It doesn&#x27;t leave my skin greasy, and I haven&#x27;t broken out using it. However, whether or not if it&#x27;s exceptionally beneficial over something like a raw, pure EVOO, I&#x27;m not even sure because a clean oil moisturizes whether or not it&#x27;s argan oil (thus why there&#x27;s mineral oil in Ponds). I don&#x27;t think I have a basis for comparison of whether it&#x27;s actually equivalent or better than JM; I also changed my overall skincare routine so my skin has simply been better since the new year. But the mere fact that it hasn&#x27;t negated the progress I&#x27;ve already made with my skin says to me that this product is in the right direction.</li>
    <li> I have used several different brands of Argan Oil and this one is my favorite.  I love the consistency and the way it make my hair smooth and soft.  I also use it on my face.  I will not do without this product.</li>
    <li> exactly as described!</li>
    <li> I started using Pura D&#x27;or Argan Oil about a year ago. I use it from head to to. More importantly, I have skin allergies, eczema and am in a perpetual state of discomfort. This oil is amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I decided to write this review for two reasons. First, recently I bought bottle of another brand of Argan oil. The products were night and day. The main difference was that the oil was thick and went it seem to just coat the skin. So the few extra dollars for the organic product is worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The second reason I&#x27;m writing is to compliment Amazon on their customer service. I travel frequently for work. I order my refill and scheduled it to arrive the day before or the day I arrived home. It was important to make the delivery schedule because I had one day home before leaving again. I arrive home and the package was waiting on my doorstep. Thank you Amazon</li>
    <li> received as described</li>
    <li> Pure argan oil at a reasonable price. Very happy. Works well for my 9 month old daughter. Her skin improved a lot</li>
    <li> My friend had given me Pura d&#x27;or Aragan Oil to try it out, and it&#x27;s great.  I use it every night and leaves my skin so soft.  I would recommend this to anyone who is looking for good nighttime moisturizer.  I also use it on the ends of my hair.</li>
    <li> I have been growing my hair out for the last 2-3 years, which means extra care. Now I have long, wavy hair, and lots of it, which can make it hard to keep it healthy and strong, especially in below-freezing temperatures.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried several brands of argan oil to help me keep the length and ends nourished and fight frizz in high-humidity, and though I am willing to spend a bit for a good product, I found that most of them were not worth the price: the hair was just oily, but didn&#x27;t really seem nourished. There were no flyaways, but I also had to shampoo more often, which tends to dry out strands - so i was reaching the opposite effect from the one I was shooting for. Also, several brands (including the over-hyped, overpriced one with the blue lable, you know the one) have an unpleasant sticky texture and have added fragrance, which I don&#x27;t like because I have a sensitivity to synthetic fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I came across Pura D&#x27;or, I was pleased to find a product that was organic, with no fillers or additives, and  I was intrigued by the fact that it claimed it could be used on face and body, as well. So I tried it, and I wasn&#x27;t disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, I tried some on my hands. And wow, my hands, dry from the cold, became really soft and stayed that way for days. That gave me the courage to try it on my face. Again, WOW. I have combination skin, so I am leery of oils, but a few drops of Pura D&#x27;or on my face 3 times a week seem to have done something to rebalance my skin so it is now more even in texture. I have tried countless products on my face, and I have only had this result with a product from the Perricone MD line, a product that I love but I cannot afford to use on a regular basis. This? I can afford and will keep using it, especially in winter!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for my hair, which was the original reason I was willing to try this in the first place, after using this product for about a week my hair seems more nourished, and that slightly wavy texture that has been driving me crazy has somehow morphed into those relaxed \\&quot;beachy waves\\&quot; I have been trying to get for a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am not a gusher, so I can hardly believe I am posting such a glowing review, but I can really not find anything wrong with the product, which is odd ;-)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s organic, it&#x27;s affordable, it&#x27;s easy to dose and it&#x27;s multi-use. I think this will become a regular in my toiletry shelf!wavy texture that has been driving me crazy has somehow morphed into those relaxed \\&quot;beachy waves\\&quot; I have been trying to get for a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am not a gusher, so I can hardly believe I am posting such a glowing review, but I can really not find anything wrong with the product, which is odd ;-)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s organic, it&#x27;s affordable, it&#x27;s easy to dose and it&#x27;s multi-use. I think this will become a regular in my toiletry shelf!</li>
    <li> I love it!!!!! I purchased it because I had heard alot about the benefits of argon oil .  I use a few drops in my hair everyday .Its also great on your dry cuticles and nails .I also use it on my legs. A few drops go a long way ,and this oil is much less expensive than others available on line. I would buy it again. I also mix a drop with my moisterizer every morning and my face looks great!!!!!!</li>
    <li> This is a great product.  It&#x27;s not too oily and it smells good. I received it exactly when expected. You only need to use a small amount so it last a long time.</li>
    <li> I love it!! I have very thick hair with lots of curl and wave and definitely a frizz problem! I really enjoy this organic oil because its light but at the same time quite effective. With other oils I&#x27;ve tried such as...Moroccan oil an bamboo oil I had to use so much and I was buying hair oil all the time. But with Pura D&#x27;or I use SOOO... much less! Definitely more bang for my buck!</li>
    <li> This is my second order of Pura D&#x27;or Pure &amp; Organic Argon Oil.  I use it every night on my feet  and hands and they are so soft.  I will keep buying it.</li>
    <li> useful in a long run. make ur hair strong enough to withstand daily damage.</li>
    <li> This is a product that I have fell in love with.  It is easy to apply, only takes a small amount, &amp; makes the skin look healthy.</li>
    <li> I use this under my eyes especially to remove leftover mascara and now I have started putting it on my daughters scar as I have read that argan oil helps heal scars.</li>
    <li> This Argan oil really fooled me. I knew price was too good to be true. This DRIEDDDDD me out so bad! Not moisturizing whatsoever and I was using it for a few weeks and couldn&#x27;t figure out what I was doing wrong because I use mostly the same products for my daily regimen. Finally I realized this was the thing I kept using but was still getting terrible results. Looks real, smells real, but it&#x27;s completely fake. Too late to get my money back unfortunately. Also all these positive reviews make me extremely skeptical....</li>
    <li> This is my second bottle of this product, it is very good.  I put a few drops in my lotion after my shower, really helps with the dry skin.  It is not greasy, it soaks in very quickly.</li>
    <li> https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004Z209HS/ref&#x3D;cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_24</li>
    <li> I saw a lot of great reviews for Argan Oil, but I just haven&#x27;t seen the same results everyone seemed to have. I feel like I am breaking out more than I was before using this product. I&#x27;m still using it though.</li>
    <li> My hair is somewhat frizzy and wiry, and I was hoping this product would help make it softer.  The first time I used it, I combed it through damp hair, root to tip, and dried it.  My hair looked stringy and disgusting, even though I only used a little.  The next time, I used even less while my hair was dry.  It smoothed the hair (somewhat) for the rest of the day, but the next morning (when my hair normally looks its best), my hair looked greasy in some places and frizzy in others.  I&#x27;ve just tried it on air-dried hair, and it just feels disgusting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In sum, this product is helpful in one situation: when you&#x27;ve just dried your hair and want it to look smoother just for a couple of hours, and don&#x27;t care if you look like a greasy unkempt mess the next morning.  I&#x27;m disappointed I spent $24 on it.</li>
    <li> So I was experiencing some problems with my skin, specifically on my face, some minor skin blemishes and dark circles around my eyes so I thought why not give this product a try, I already use the shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using the argan oil for the past few weeks and I can&#x27;t say I&#x27;m too impressed. Maybe this is because I&#x27;m use to using lotion but I didn&#x27;t really feel the hydration I was expecting from this product and it doesn&#x27;t really sink into the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product did work as advertised for the first week or so but after that my skin on my face begin to dry up so I&#x27;m not sure what exactly is going on, however, on other areas of my body it does seem to work as advertised.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe it works for some and not for others...I&#x27;m not sure.</li>
    <li> I have a pro-acne skin and I&#x27;ve been looking for a natural product to moisturize. This is so perfect! It&#x27;s light enough not to feel greasy all day but enough to get an amazing glow. It has not caused any breakouts for me! So happy with it.</li>
    <li> Love this oil ..Made my skin soft and supple..Noticed tiny lines softened .&lt;br /&gt;Would recommend this product and will order again from this company.</li>
    <li> This oils keeps my hair silky and smooth without feeling so greasy.. My hair get so dry with blow drying and ironing.. This is a must have for my hair..</li>
    <li> I love this oil. It is light &amp; really sinks into the skin. I also use it in my hair!</li>
    <li> I like this product a lot. I use it as a moisturizer for my face, I put one pump in my foundation when applying if I want a dewy look. I also use occasionally on the ends of my hair to moisturizer as well.</li>
    <li> This pure organic Argan oil is superior to any I have tried.  I use it every day and it absorbs perfectly.</li>
    <li> I love this product! it is the best bang for your buck and leaves your skin feeling radiant and smooth. I use it every night before i go to bed as my moisturizer</li>
    <li> I tried a sample of another brand which was nice but seemed a bit thicker.  This oil is very light and absorbs quickly into the skin.  Just a tiny amount is needed, one pump for most purposes.  Love the pump by the way no need to use a glass dropper or some such to get the oil. Works beautifully on skin, hair, nails whatever you need.</li>
    <li> great product.  well worth the money.  my hair loves it-- I give it a must buy</li>
    <li> Love this stuff, rub it into your skin as directed and you will see good results.</li>
    <li> Wonderful dry oil.  A little goes a long way, so excellent value.</li>
    <li> Arrived quickly, nice packaging, and works great for my dry, frizz prone hair!  It is also an excellent moisturizer for dry skin areas.</li>
    <li> Great for Oily skin! It&#x27;s truly amazing!</li>
    <li> I was a little cautious about purchasing this product because of the inexpenSive cost, but that is only one thing that I Like about it. I like the size; I got more value for the money, I like the push button applIcator, most Companies use dropper. Most of all I like the way it softens my dry skin and hair. I will definitely purchase this product again.</li>
    <li> I love this oil.  I use it for everything.  My hair, skin and nails.  I love the way it feels. I will be getting more in the future when I need to.</li>
    <li> Great product for moisturizing dry hair without adding a greasy feeling.</li>
    <li> This was a present for my daughter.</li>
    <li> I love this oil, I live on a small farm so I wash my hands a lot. My skin around my nails gets hard and cracks and cuticles are a wreck, but just a couple of drops of this argan oil and my hands are healing already. Goes on a little oily but just be patient and it absorbs in quickly and your skin feels like velvet. OTC lotions just lay on your skin and wash off. You can use it alone or like me I make my on creams using cocoa butter, coconut oil, shea butter, and vitamin E oil it works well but since I&#x27;ve added the argan oil it work amazing it seems to be a catalyst to help in the absorption of the other oils. Now the dry flakey skin I had on my legs and knees is gone and my dry cracked heals are healing. You may think the oil is expensive but when you see how little you use it is really economical. I wasted so much money on OTC lotions that just washed off before I discovered this oil and began making my on lotions. I also use this for my hair just a couple of drops massaged into my hair after washing and it is so soft, not oily at all, even when I think I have used too much it will absorb and not be oily.</li>
    <li> Great!  This product is just as good as the brand name argan oil I had been buying!  A fraction of the price.  I will not be paying all that money when I can get the same quality for such a reasonable price.  Give it a try, you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> I was spending more on a brand name organic argan oil sold at sephora, this is just as good if not  better.  I used it on my hands, hair and cuticles and will use it on my face.  I won&#x27;t go back to spending more, this is a great product!</li>
    <li> We have purchased this brand several times, both on amazon and elsewhere.  Always top quality, good price, and we will keep coming back.  Great product, cannot go wrong with this supplier.</li>
    <li> I have naturally curly, kinky, long, thick hair.and this product is a godsend. I have been looking and looking for something to help make my hair seems softer and smoother and controls frizz and this product did it. I&#x27;d recommend this to anyone at anytime I was very very skeptical like a lot of people are about trying something new and this delivered.</li>
    <li> After only one week of daily use, there have been significant improvements in my nails. I am a senior lady who has had problems and difficulties with my fingernails for a number of years: ridges, splitting, breaking, brittle, dry. The Pura d’Or Argan oil for nails is not only restoring moisture to my nails, but also cuticles are looking great even after short time of use.  Judging by the excellent early results, I will be continuing with a daily regimen of applying the oil, with a confident expectation of beautiful nails long before reaching the bottom of the bottle.</li>
    <li> I initially bought this to use for OCM (oil cleansing method, check out reddit.com/r/skincareaddiction for more info). But, everyone&#x27;s skin reacts differently to different oils, and unfortunately for me, my skin did not like Argan oil. I was really sad because my skin felt nicely moisturized without feeling greasy. However, I decided to use it on my hair and my hair has never looked better. I use two pumps about 2-3 times a week and it instantly makes my dry, damaged ends appear much healthier. Added bonus, it&#x27;s really moisturizing for my hands too!</li>
    <li> Love this oil.It works great for my frizzy hair. And not only that I use it for my daughter&#x27;s hair too.Makes her hair soft n silky.Even she loves this oil now.</li>
    <li> Love this oil!  It is lightweight and has a mild scent. Using it on my  face mixed with rosehip seed oil.  My skin feels smoother and spots are lightening up.</li>
    <li> This is the best stuff in the world!  It&#x27;s the only product that I use on my face--I have severely allergic skin and have found that as I age there are fewer and fewer products that do not cause rashes or breakouts.  This is certified organic argan oil, no additives, no fragrances, just the good stuff.  I use it as a moisturizer, healing lotion, and for hair treatments.  Amazon has the best price and a bottle lasts several months--a little goes a long way!  Wonderful product--highly recommend!</li>
    <li> Excellent  product! Silky, smooth no smell. Amazing feel every time I use it! Highly recommend it</li>
    <li> Best product I have tried.  I use this product for my face and neck moisturizer and I am always putting it on my hands.  I love the way it makes my skin feel and look.  Now for my hair, I use a tiny amount and it keeps my very straw like hair smooth and silky, not greasy!  I ordered my second bottle and I know I will order many more.</li>
    <li> Great product! I have used on my hair and it looks and feels healthier already. I also like using on my face. The product shipped with no issues.</li>
    <li> I honestly love this product, it leaves my skin so soft. I use it on my hair also. I will be ordering this product again &amp; again &amp; again.....</li>
    <li> The organic argan oil from Pura D&#x27;Or is wonderful, and lasts forever, as only a little drop is needed for anything from blemishes, scars, dry nails, and split ends.  I use it every day on my hair, and on my cuticles before going to bed (if I&#x27;m not too tired to remember).</li>
    <li> Very nice.  There is a little spray top on the bottle so you can take just the right amount.  It absorbs quickly and leaves my skin feeling vey silky and soft.  I like it especially for my elbows and knees and smooth it on my just-washed face before going to bed.  There is no odor at all.  This is an excellent product.</li>
    <li> makes a different in texture</li>
    <li> Great stuff so far. No oily residue.</li>
    <li> We have been experimenting with Pura d&#x27;or Argan Oil for just one month.  We were delighted with the amazing removal of flaking, dry skin, the improvement of skin appearance, and the remarkable arresting of itch.  One- minute massage instruction seemed irritating and too time-consuming.  We discontinued that after only one trial and simply gently rubbed it on.  Unlike competing creams such as Cetaphil, Heel Rescue, and Neosporin&amp;Pain, your Argan Oil adheres  to the skin and not come off onto clothing or upholstery.  On the negative side, even through its viscosity allows just a few drops to cover, say, a forearm, I found it necessary to apply the product as often as twice a day.  At five dollars per ounce, therefore, its use is expensive and would seem to highly limit the market.  One way to help lower cost would be to also offer the product in a container several times as large so that  the nozzle cost would be spread over a much larger amount of product.  Furthermore, Pura d&#x27;or makes hair much more manageable and reduces scalp itch.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t used it daily since purchasing it but it works great for dry skin. I did however leave it overnight on scalp and hair. It worked really well on my dry,damaged hair!  it feels softer and hasn&#x27;t frizzed,it&#x27;s natural and less expensive than other artificial products on the market that simply DON&#x27;T work...super happy with this oil!!</li>
    <li> I have to say thank you for the makers of Pura D&#x27;or Pure, it actually works!&lt;br /&gt;My teenage daughter has been dealing with eczema and to make things worse, she has started getting acne as well.&lt;br /&gt;I have done a lot of research on different things that could help her but decided I would purchase this item and we are both so thankful and amazed. Her skin is smoother than it has ever been and her eczema has calmed so much; you can hardly even tell that she has any skin conditions.&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t express just how excited I am that I have finally found something that is real!</li>
    <li> This is very good concentrated organ oil.&lt;br /&gt; Much better than the other brand I bought before.&lt;br /&gt;Good value.&lt;br /&gt;Would recommend it.</li>
    <li> My sister had used this and I really thought it was probably not worth the cost of the label but I was pleasantly surprised when I tried it!  My hair feels wonderful!  I use is on my face and it really helps the sun-damaged skin.  I have also used it on my dry skin extensively and really am pleased with it.  I will definitely keep purchasing.</li>
    <li> I have tried several similar products, but this is my favorite.  I&#x27;m so happy with the results this product gives.  I&#x27;ve only been using it for a little over a weak and it has my skin looking flawless.  I&#x27;ve started using it in my hair also and I can tell a big difference.  My hair has a beautiful healthy shine to it and it seems to be growing a lot faster.  I was so impressed with this product that I bought some for my mom and sister.  I highly recommend this product, after using it in a few days you will see a big improvement to your skin and hair.</li>
    <li> Great oil, I use for my face &amp; it makes a difference. It&#x27;s a big bottle that lasts &amp; comes with a pump, how convenient. What you pay is nothing compared to the quality of the product. I don&#x27;t see anyone hating this oil. My boyfriend even uses it on his face.</li>
    <li> I have been using this Pura D&#x27;or Pure and Organic Argan Oil, Brown and Gold for awhile now, and it really does a remarkable job for both my dry hair and skin issues. I have allergies to many of the moisturizers and conditioners on the market, and this is one of the few products I&#x27;ve found that really meets all my needs. In fact, in my opinion, it goes above and beyond. I even think I actually look a little younger now after having used it for awhile. Also a plus, it&#x27;s organic!!! I would highly recommend this product to anyone who has serious skin, and allergy problems, like myself, who are looking for a great product that won&#x27;t break the bank.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a few months, am on my 3rd bottle, and love it.  I use it daily on my face, arms, legs and it leaves my skin soft and moisturized without oily residue or a long wait for it to be absorbed and it only takes a  few drops.  There are no dry patches, like elbows or knees, that need extra attention.</li>
    <li> really its amazing  i order second times&lt;br /&gt; I recommended  it for any one really tray it&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;really its amazing  i order second times&lt;br /&gt; I recommended  it for any one really tray it&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;really its amazing  i order second times&lt;br /&gt; I recommended  it for any one really tray it&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;really its amazing  i order second times&lt;br /&gt; I recommended  it for any one really tray it</li>
    <li> I bought this to put on my hair.  I am quite pleased.  This is the first time I have purchased Argan oil, so I do have to say I don&#x27;t have anything for comparison.  But, I am please with it.</li>
    <li> We have been using this product for over year now and its magic healing power on facial skins of my wife, daughter and granddaughter has been amazing. My wife&#x27;s small wrinkles are practically gone. My granddaughter had a small accident, resulting in a facial scar. After applying this oil daily basis for about a month, the scar is now almost invisible and gone. This oil must have natural ingredients, which must have skin restoring power. Thank you Argan Oil.</li>
    <li> Works great. Makes your skin feel soft and young again. Recommend it to women of all ages. This is a wonderful alternative to the very expensive micro-sized versions available form the brick and mortar places.</li>
    <li> This is the real thing - just wonderful, pure argan oil. I have naturally curly hair that frizzes up in the heat and humidity, and this oil helps tremendously with that condition. I use it after washing my hair, to smooth flyaways, and to add shine. Less money than the &amp;#34;name brand&amp;#34; products and it produces better results.</li>
    <li> Just-reordered this oil and obviously loved it! I have course, thick asian hair and I use it sparingly after hairdrying and the little bit goes a long way.  It instantly makes my hair defrizz and look healthy..don&#x27;t have to use much other hair products after use. And I don&#x27;t have to wash hands after use since it&#x27;s a great moisturizer as well!</li>
    <li> I am in love with this Argan oil – I use it on my body and my hair. In my personal opinion, one hit wonders are not the way to go with beauty products. All natural products have multiple uses. I use the oil on my face on night – it is oily, but soaks in over the course of my sleep. When I wake up, my face feels so soft. I also use the oil post shower on my hair and a little after I use heat. A little goes a long way with this product!</li>
    <li> This product is exactly as advertised at an incredible value. I have been buying argan oil from Whole Foods; however, the past few bottles bought there were not fresh and had a distinct odor about them. Pura D&#x27;or Pure and Organic Argan Oil is a top rate product that is well packaged (tan bottle for protection of the oil) and noticeably fresher than any other brand I&#x27;ve purchased. In addition, it&#x27;s unit price is well under that of the same product bought at other retailers. There is no doubt I will continue buying this product!</li>
    <li> I just open this product recommended by my friend. There is no smell no color, pure fine oil. I use it as my body oil overnight and it keeps my body smooth. I plan to blend it with French essence oil so that it can help me with my sleep as I had a jet leg from long distance travel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The package is simple but environmental eco. I like it.</li>
    <li> Hair oil so good that you seldom need it!</li>
    <li> Love this stuff! Ditch your current beauty regime and go for this stuff. Fantastic oil that can be used for many things.</li>
    <li> I ordered the Pura D&#x27;or Pure &amp; Organic Argon Oil when I saw the price for 4 fluid ounces.  Argon oil is great for hair, skin...</li>
    <li> I bought this for my 80 year old mother and she loves it!  She has been using it for only a couple of weeks on her face.  She has received many compliments from people, to include her new doctor, with people saying no way is she 80!  I&#x27;m going to get some for myself.</li>
    <li> I absolutely LOVE this product. It is great to blend with essential oils and used for a facial massage during facials or is great to use as a serum!!!!</li>
    <li> I bought for my hands and neck, but have started using on my face as this MW winter has left it so parched.  I could see the difference in my cheeks within a week.  I use with my regular moisturizer.</li>
    <li> Very lovely product.  You can definitely tell the difference between it and others that have other ingredients.  For your hair you only need a tiny bit.  Skin too.</li>
    <li> This is my second bottle. I&#x27;ve never heard of this brand before I saw this on Amazon. I used Moroccan oil before this one. I love this product for several reasons. First, I love the price. It does just as well as expensive hair oils that cost you over 50 bucks a bottle. Second, it doesn&#x27;t have the weird oil smell that other brands have. Third, it didn&#x27;t make my hair greasy at all. Lastly, I add it to my hand lotion and body lotion when it&#x27;s too dry. And it works really well.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m am argan oil lover and strayed away from my usual brands to try this one for the value size.  However, it doesn&#x27;t smell like pure argan oil should.  Maybe peppermint oil or tea tree oil..  not the smell of argan oil that I have grown to love, and for the price, I want to smell the real deal.  Even the Walgreens version is super good!  So, their facebook claims the bottles are cleaned with tea tree oil, hence the minty smell.  Do all their poducts smell this way? I am a little skeptical, haven&#x27;t used it for more than a day, but usually the smell of argan oils confirms its authenticity, and that is not the case here :/</li>
    <li> This is an amazing oil for many purposes. I use it for eye makeup removal, body moisturizer, hair oil, and even use it on my 2 year old son after his baths.</li>
    <li> Used it with pura d&#x27;or shampoo... Smoother hair in two to three washes and less hair fall after a month.</li>
    <li> So I received this as a gift a while back and the 4oz bottle lasts a good amount of time, i.e. 3-4 months for using a dab every other night for my face.&lt;br /&gt;I had mild eczema on my arms and face, and although my arms no longer show signs, I still have sensitive dry/itchy skin for my face. I would use this before I slept after cleansing my face with a neutral cleanser, and by the next morning, I wouldn&#x27;t have any embarrassing dry spots on my face. Although I haven&#x27;t tried using it on my hair or nails like it suggests, it really does feel like your face is being replenished with good nutrients. I see some acne scars fading as well. Overall, using this product has made me feel a lot more confident when going outside.</li>
    <li> For the few days I&#x27;ve used this product, it keeps my skin and hair moisturized for a long day. if this would result to something even great then this would be my replacement for lotions, gel, creams, etc. have to wait for few more weeks to see other results.</li>
    <li> I use it daily on my face and hands, wonderful and non-greasy.  I give it four stars as I do need to use additional hand-cream, but then my hands are extra dry.</li>
    <li> I brought this product few months back and I am pleased to see the results. It makes my hair feel alive again. But it was a bit a more on the expensive side. Its definitely works for my hair. But not so well for my friend. Worth a try.</li>
    <li> I tried this because of thinning hair. So far I really like it. I use this after every shampoo just after towel drying it. I use a very small amount and rub my hands together then run them through my hair BUT stay away from the roots and scalp since it can cause your hair to look greasy if you use too much or put it on the roots. It makes your hair soft and very manageable.</li>
    <li> This product is great for dry and frizzy hair. I highly recommend it. I use it daily after shower on damp hair.</li>
    <li> This is a great product!! Packaged beautifully &amp; a much better deal than the oil being sold on QVC! I love it as a moisturizer! I will come back for more, more, more!!!</li>
    <li> This product is amazing!! Originally I ordered this for my face because it was dry but it gave me pimples (only reason why I gave it 4 stars). But then I didn&#x27;t want to waste it so I started using it on my legs, arms, and hair and it did amazing things. My skin was so soft after a week of using it and my hair was soft and shiny. I highly recommend this for the skin and hair. Those that want to use this for their face I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this if you have combination skin. Besides that everything else works perfectly and I donot regret purchasing this.</li>
    <li> I used this oil on my hair and it made my hair really soft and shiny. I used it on dry parts of the skin and it really helped by keeping the skin moisturized.</li>
    <li> I use it for my hair. It makes my hair not that dry! However, my hair does not absorb this oil very well. After I applied it on my hair, it looks kind of oily.</li>
    <li> I got this for about 3 weeks now, is it on by body and hair and am seeing a huge difference since. My skin is more softer and well hydrated. will be ordering more later.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product. My face was dried up in the winter and I used it and now my skin is clear and smooth. I also used it on my hair and it completely repaired the damages in my hair from dying. Must buy!</li>
    <li> I really like this product. You only need a little bit (too much will make your hair greasy), so although it seems expensive, it goes a long way. It makes my hair incredibly soft, shiny, and smooth, and gets rid of all frizz. The smell is a bit weird, but goes away quickly and doesn&#x27;t linger in your hair. I love that it is all natural and yet really works, which makes it  a much better alternative to the overpriced salon conditioners that are filled with bad chemicals.</li>
    <li> First bottle I ordered back in August. I am almost out of that one now and just ordered another one. It has helped a lot with my hair, my scalp dryness and irritation and with hairloss. Every few days I use it as a mask, I put in on my roots, massage my scalp before I go to bed. I wash it in the morning and voila! Soft bouncy hair. Good for face, hands, nails etc. Does not have a heavy smell as some other ones do. Give it a try, you will love it!</li>
    <li> this is one of the greatest products I have ever used, it  makes your skin feel so soft and not greasy at all.  I use it every day and now I don&#x27;t think I even need much make up at all.  just a little blush.  I have ordered this product for my daughter, daughter-in-law and also a friend I am going to order one for her after I am done here.  I let her use it last night and she really carried on about it feeling so smooth this mornig.  Thanks for a great product.  Janice Adair</li>
    <li> I have a very dry skin and hair. When I applied it for the first time, I applied 3-4 drops, which was too much for my hair (I have shoulder length hair). I thought it is also a greasy oil. But 2nd time I took just one drop, applied on the tips of my hair, and yes it worked! I apply it on my face too. Very nice oil, odorless, colorless. Feels pure !</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t tell any difference between this and the 5x more expensive stuff sold at Sephora, other than the packaging -- and I&#x27;m still not sure which style I like better, but this is almost impossible to make a mess or get a huge amount on accident, so I think I like this better anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair looks awesome and it isn&#x27;t dry-frizzing anywhere, this works as moisturizer quite well, and I&#x27;m very pleased.</li>
    <li> My wife has been using Argan oil for some time now &amp; loves it&#x27;s benefit. This item was a no brainier to purchase b/c of it&#x27;s cost &amp; because of it&#x27;s quality. I&#x27;m super happy to have found this brand that promises a pure, Argan oil &amp; believe me, the wife is happy, too.</li>
    <li> I liked it because it&#x27;s wery good oil for face. advise to all people who wants pure face...</li>
    <li> Let me first say that Pura D&#x27;or is the BEST! Their products as well as their customer service are outstanding.    I&#x27;ve been using Pura D&#x27;or products for a while now and decided to give their Pure Organic Argan Oil a try. I&#x27;ve been using it on my skin and hair for about 2 months now, and I love it. I&#x27;ll be 52 in a couple months, and have slight sun damage on my face, some dark spots, fine wrinkles, rosacea and I am beyond pleased with this product.    For face: After I wash my face, while the skin is still moist, I lihgtly rub in a few drops and let it drink it in. My fine lines are diminishing and my skin glows and looks fresh and healthy. I&#x27;ve found it works best on freshly washed, moist skin. This also locks the moisture in. It doesn&#x27;t feel caked on or sticky. It feels smooth and refreshing.     Body: the red rash on my arms is gone. My skin feels smooth &amp; soft. My neck and chest also look much better. I use it after shaving my legs, and it makes them feel like silk! After I use it on my face or body, I rub the excess into my nails and cuticles and they have also improved.     Hair: I have high-lighted hair and the ends can become very dry. I rub a couple drops in the palm of my hands and then apply it to the ends. After that, I comb my hands through my hair but avoid the scalp because I need lift and I tend to have oily scalp yet dry ends. I have heard that it is great if you have dandruff or dry scalp as well. It really helps with those little fly-aways.    I forgot to mention, I have sensitive skin and it reacts to most products, i.e., rash and pimples. I have had none of that with Pura D&#x27;or Pure &amp; Organic Argan Oil. I would definitely recommend Pura d&#x27;or 100% Pure &amp; USDA Organic Argan Oil!ve high lighted hair and the ends can become very dry. I rub a couple drops in the palm of my hands and then apply it to the ends. After that, I cimb my hands through my hair but avoid the scalp because I need lift and I tend to have oily scalp yet dry ends. I have heard that it is great if you have dandruff or dry scalp though. It really helps cut down on fly-aways, without adding any weight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, it&#x27;s big YES for my skin. I forgot to mention, I have sensitive skin and it reacts to most products, i.e., rash and pimples. I have had none of that with Pura D&#x27;or Pure &amp; Organic Argan Oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;People Have commented on the smell-I think it smells good. It definitely doesn&#x27;t smell sweet or perfumey-and it shouldn&#x27;t! It&#x27;s 100% Argan Oil and that&#x27;s it. In other words, it doesn&#x27;t smell like synthetic cosmetic products do. It smells a little like sesame oil and I don&#x27;t even smell it unless I put my nose to the bottle. I am amazed at how quickly my skin absorbs it, though. It doesn&#x27;t just sit on the surface-it penetrates deeply and nourishes skin, hair, and nails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This has become as essential as toothpaste and lipstick for me!&lt;br /&gt;It really does help, not just the look, but the overall health of my skin and nails. Highly recommend Pura D&#x27;or Pure &amp; Organic Argan Oil!</li>
    <li> This is by far the best hair product I&#x27;ve ever gotten plus skin. I see result in an instant.</li>
    <li> Love this argan oil for moisturizing skin. It seems like it would be too greasy but it soaks right in after a few seconds. Can be used alone or under makeup, great as a nightly moisturizer too. Highly recommend!!</li>
    <li> great product! i used it in a diy whipped body butter. i&#x27;ve also used it on my body and even lips by itself. makes skin smooth and is very nourishing.</li>
    <li> I use it as a moisturizer in the evening and it leaves my skin incredibly soft. I don&#x27;t like using it on my hair as it leaves them a little to greasy but overall the product is incredible. The bottle will last for a while</li>
    <li> I really love the way my skin feels and looks plus how reasonably priced it is compared to Josie Moran on QVC</li>
    <li> I was surprised that I could put oil on my face and it would HELP clear blemishes. It actually does help. I have given it to my daughter to use, and now I need more!</li>
    <li> I like this for my hands. I find it a little too oily for my skin. However, if my skin is particularly dry (e.g., after skiing in dry Colorado), I will put it on my face at night. I have not noticed any staining or transfer to my pillowcase. My only real complaint is the bottle. The pump is not ergonomic, and it doesn&#x27;t dispense a controlled stream onto two fingertips, which is how pumps normally work in my experience. I have to hold it with one hand, and pump it into the cupped palm of my other hand. The I have to use my other hand to dip my fingers into for application. It&#x27;s by no means the biggest deal, but it&#x27;s an added inconvenience to my nighttime routine, and then I&#x27;m left with a greasy palm.</li>
    <li> This definitely does make my hair silky, but too much makes it oily. I didn&#x27;t feel like it soaked into my skin. Even after applying it, my skin still felt a bit dry. As a result, I&#x27;ll continue using it for my hair, but have switched to a moisturizer for my skin.</li>
    <li> My dry skin and hair showed improvement after the first use. My boyfriend has noticed how silky my curls are and loves to stroke my soft, soft skin.</li>
    <li> My wife loves this oil for her hair.  It keeps it healthy and makes it so soft and smooth.  Great product and will continue to use it.</li>
    <li> Primarily used for dry skin and this stuff has worked fantastic.  I can&#x27;t comment on the other possible uses, but I can say that as someone whose skin dries out in the dry midwestern air, this stuff has certainly done the trick.</li>
    <li> Nice light oil. Because I have dry skin, I use a little on my face and I think I see a difference in the smoothness of my face.</li>
    <li> I like that it is cold pressed, organic, and the price is very affordable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found it very good to my hair and nail. The consistency is a little thicker than Josie Maran. I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I have used atleast 5 different makers of argan oil. This one seems to be the best as far as feeling non greasy, light and absorbs very quickly in your skin. Mainly used on face. Notice a much more even tone and smoother skin. Give atleast 4-6 weeks to seen any results.Pura D&#x27;or Pure &amp; Organic Argan Oil (4 fl. oz.)</li>
    <li> I originally bought this to use on my frizzy hair, but it also does wonders for my dry skin. I love that it&#x27;s all natural and organic! You should only use a tiny amount, or else it will feel a bit greasy and take longer to absorb. It does have a faint medicinal smell, though.</li>
    <li> This works wonders on my dry frizzy hair.  It goes from dull and lifeless looking to shiny and smooth! I use it everyday and I am obsessed with running my hands through my hair!  I use a lot of heat on my hair and am sometimes rough on my hair with my hair brush, so my hair gets pretty damaged.  This argan oil helps my hair looking healthy, shiny, and tangle free.  I sometimes use it on my knees and elbows if they are feeling a dry!</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t think this stuff would make a difference, but a friend told me to rub it on my body to prevent stretch marks and heal old ones and sure enough!! It works! Very impressed and soaks in so that it isn&#x27;t that thick oily feeling!</li>
    <li> I bought this quite a while ago and have been using it on and off. It certainly feels good, leaving the end of hair silky, but not too greasy. And more importantly, it has a very very subtle scent; I don&#x27;t like products that other people can smell from yards away...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the other hand, it&#x27;s just a bottle of Argan oil. Personally I feel some other reviews are over-rated. Don&#x27;t expect it to work miracle.</li>
    <li> This is definitely one of the best priced pure argan oil products on the market. However, I&#x27;ve had the Josie Maran Argan Oil before and I have to say Pura D&#x27;or Pure is somewhat more oily/watery. I like to put this stuff on my face (because my hair is fine) so the excessive oiliness is a little annoying (especially when i wear glasses, the oil gets on them and makes them slippery) but when I put it on before I go to sleep it still completely absorbs by the time I wake up which is great! Definitely a NIGHTTIME moisturizer. Also the pump is a little annoying and sprays a little too much out but you just have to put your finger right up to the opening to control that better. I can&#x27;t say anything about the claims (anti-aging, helps with eczema etc.) because I haven&#x27;t tried this long enough but certainly recommend this as a natural nighttime moisturizer without all of the chemicals in typical facial creams nowadays.</li>
    <li> Had been using a similar product from a different company. This is two thirds the cost for more than twice the amount of Argon Oil. Win Win!</li>
    <li> Love this product. It leaves your skin feeling so smooth and leaves a healthy glow.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product on my hair now for about two weeks- AMAZING! I recently moved to Arizona where the water is really hard. I was experiencing dry, brittle, and straw like hair. I needed something with extreme healing properties, moisturizing, and not greasy. This is the product! I rub two squirts throughout my hair, focusing on the ends, every other day. It&#x27;s helped my hair be shiny, silky, and smooth. I highly recommend this product.&lt;br /&gt;P.S I tried using it on my face one night, and got a break out. However, I have a history of sensitive face skin so wasn&#x27;t surprised by this. I&#x27;m sure for people with good face skin this could be applied there too.</li>
    <li> The product is amazing. I used similar creams and oils for my skin but was left with greasy oily feeling. the first time trying the Pura D&#x27;Or prove to be the best so far.It actually feels refreshing and moisturizing.</li>
    <li> I have tried a few different Argan oils and morrocan oils trying to find a pure product that isn&#x27;t full of chemicals and other rediculous additives. This is by far the best brand I have used! It&#x27;s so pure and the results are amazing! Soft frizz free hair with natural shine and clear skin! I use it along side my essential oils for my skin care routine and I&#x27;m absolutely in love! The price is so affordable with amazing quality! I will be recommending this product to everyone I know!</li>
    <li> Best oil I have ever used. Its great for skin as well as hair</li>
    <li> Very happy with the product, within one week of using my beard already feels healthier and it has a nice shine.</li>
    <li> I agree with the other reviews. Less expensive than J. Maran and just as wonderful. Wish it had sunscreen but that may not be possible.</li>
    <li> I have tried several brands of argan oil but didn&#x27;t worked as this one .I really recommand this product, just the best one i came across for moisturizing fighting.</li>
    <li> I did not have a good experience with this product. Maybe I just got a bad bottle...who knows...but it did not hydrate the way the Josie Maran argon oil I had used previously did, and my face broke out. This also had an odor to it that I don&#x27;t generally associate with pure cold pressed argan oil. In addition, my skin had an ashy feel to it which I had never experienced before. This oil was thinner, so maybe it&#x27;s just something in the production. Sorry but this one is not for me,  have to return it.</li>
    <li> This is my third bottle of Argan oil and I am loving this on my hair and skin. I use this oil after my shower on my hair as leave in conditioner and everyday on my face before I go to bed. It&#x27;s working amazing on my skin and keeps the skin soft and moisturizing. I do have acne problems on my face and this oil doesn&#x27;t clog pores and suits my skin very well. So far loving PURA D&#x27;OR Moroccan Argan Oil.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t care for this oil as a moisturizer, so now I just use it to remove makeup. I wouldn&#x27;t buy again. I just don&#x27;t see any benefits.</li>
    <li> Great product.  I had something similar from another company before that cost me $109.  This is much better!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for nearly 2 years now. I apply it to my face every night.  It&#x27;s oily for a short period after you apply, then it sets in really well. I have an oily skin, but Pura D&#x27;or doesn&#x27;t make it feel oily.  Great and affordable alternative to Josie Maren!</li>
    <li> Amazing product for everything: body, hands, hair. Didn&#x27;t use it for my face though as it&#x27;s a bit too oily for my skin, but first thing I was thinking of was my hair anyway, so it worked perfectly for my crazy curly rather dry hair. Also really good for hands: nails get stronger, my toes look almost like after pedicure. Will definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff!! Absorbs quickly, doesn&#x27;t make me break out. It makes my skin feel so quenched and youthful!</li>
    <li> I bought this product a few weeks ago for my father. He is 46 and has been fighting with hair loss due to his stressful job. After he started using this product he firstly noted that his hair loss was slowing down and the growth of hair was starting to grow faster. I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for about 6 months.I&#x27;m in my 2nd bottle.  I&amp;#34;ve used every product i could,  to help with my dry skin. nothing help until i decided to try Pura dor its help my face 100%. The only problem I have is that I end up using more than just a drop. But I like it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m so impressed with the first time used of this oil. It really soft on my skin and blend really well with my natural make up. Can&#x27;t wait for the long result. My husband and I are using it every day. We want to see the more positive result on our skin and hair.</li>
    <li> I like to put argan oil in my hair before I go to sleep and wash it out in the morning. This keeps my hair full of moisture so it doesn&#x27;t break under the vicious heat of my straightener. My hair is very fine, so I cannot use it otherwise since it weighs my hair down and makes it greasy. This product is a great price, has no smell, and does what I want it to. No complaints here!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s really good for the hair but gets a little oily for the face (depends on your skin type).</li>
    <li> I have been using this Argan Oil for a few weeks now and it is nice and thick.  My skin is softer, feels repaired and glows more than it ever has.  I also use this on my fingernails and it has made a HUGE difference in the way they look; more natural and beautiful with out polish or anything else on top of them.  I have not yet put this in my hair but I plan on using it before and after I go on my beach and cruise vacations.Also, the bottle that it comes in makes it very easy to use.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a solution for my hair and skin separately and decided to try and tackle them both with argan oil. Success!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Skin: I have super dry skin. I can just splash my face with water and it becomes tight and dry. I research my skin care products a lot because I don&#x27;t have thousands to burn on expensive creams and serums. I have been using CeraVe AM and PM, but I wasn&#x27;t getting enough moisture. After smoothing one pump of argan oil into my face after cleansing my skin finally feels moisturized! I do not have super sensitive skin and I rarely break out, so I cannot speak to those face problems. My skin does feel and look dew-y though. I now use it morning and night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hair: My hair is also super dry. (Yes, I drink lots of water!). I only wash my hair once every 6 days and even then it doesn&#x27;t really get oily. My hair is fine, wavy/frizzy/straight, depending on the piece of hair in question. I used two pumps after a shower on my hair and it was actually CURLY, not just frizzy! I concentrated on the ends and on the crown of frizz on top of my head. I may experiment with using more oil next time to see if I can ever get a sleek look without looking oily. People with oily hair may not have as much success, but my hair is parched and this worked great. (For reference I use kiehl&#x27;s shampoo and honest conditioner, which I only halfway rinse out).</li>
    <li> I started using argan oil last year as a facial moisturizer, and it is a wonderful and non greasy oil. It absorbs fast and does not leave an oily residual. It also heals and fades out black spots left from picking zits.  The Pura d&#x27;or Argan oil is a great value for my money, and I love the package. The quality and quantity of this brand makes it worth everything. I also love that it comes in a spray bottom for easier application.  I use it everyday and night, and it has cleared out the discoloration on my face and even out my texture. I rarely ever use foundation, because my skin is smooth and glowy. I don&#x27;t have any blemishes to cover up since I started using Pura d&#x27;or. It is perfect for all season.</li>
    <li> I am trying to go natural with my hair and stop using silicones. After trying many products to combat frizz like gels and creams, finally I find a product I can use to tame my curly frizzy hair!. I just apply some drops of this oil to just towel dried hair and after it is completely dry, my hair feels soft, looks shiny with no frizz. I am very happy with this oil.</li>
    <li> I purchased the Pura d&#x27;or Pure and Organic Argan Oil and have been very pleased with the results.  To start, the item was shipped quickly and packed great inside of a bag and also sealed so it would not leak. So far, I have used this product as a daily moisturizer on my face and nightly.  My skin which is combination between dry &amp; oily is now almost flawless so I have seen a significant improvement in both only after using a few times! This product has worked its way into my daily beauty regime.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great for my skin.. I&#x27;m afraid of putting ANY kind of oil on my face since I can break out with most oil based products but this is like buttery gold! It makes my skin look rejuvenated and NO BREAKOUTS! I&#x27;ve been using it on my face, elbows., feet and hair and no more dryness! ONLY supple skin :)</li>
    <li> I was looking at another brand on QVC and decided to check AMAZON for pricing  then I stumbled across this brand with great reviews.  I&#x27;ve never tried Argan oil before.  I&amp;#34;m glad I didn&#x27;t purchase the more expensive brand because 100% Argan Oil is 100% Argan oil.... I can&#x27;t imagine it being much different. Anyway  Been using this on my elbows, feet, cuticles and even tried a couple times on my face... it feels good and definitely prevents dry skin.  Besides moisturizing I&#x27;m not sure what it does for the face .... not sure if it prevents wrinkles etc.  I&#x27;ll keep using my regular stuff for face.  I tried on my daughter&#x27;s hair (African American-natural hair)  applied before blow drying and it definitely gave it a nice sheen for the flat iron.  I think I applied too much because it was a bit stringy at the ends.. next time I&amp;#34;ll use less and I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;ll be fine... so far I like the product  and price point .  don&#x27;t think I&#x27;d want to pay more for it...</li>
    <li> I purchased this oil in hopes that 100% pure argan oil would be better then the Moroccan oil.  I have really dry split ends, and I was hoping this oil would help it.  I used Moroccan oil (the one in the blue bottle) before and that smells really nice, I think it works better too.  It&#x27;s lighter and didn&#x27;t make my hair feel greasy and actually made my hair feel smoother.  This Pura D&#x27;or oil is a little heavy and when applied to my hair, made it look really oily.  It also didn&#x27;t help with the split ends at all.  For the price, I should of stayed with the Moroccan oil.  I do use the Pura D&#x27;or on my face and it seems to make a really good moisturizer, however I wouldn&#x27;t use it if you have oily skin.</li>
    <li> I purchased Pura D&#x27;or Argan oil after reading about the product.  Since it was reasonably priced, I decided to try it and I am thrilled that I did!!!  I live in Tucson, AZ - one of the driest places in the United States, and since I&#x27;ve been using the oil, my skin and hair have bounced back from dry and brittle to supple and amazing. You don&#x27;t need much, even here in the \\&quot;dry heat\\&quot; state!!  It isn&#x27;t heavy on the skin and doesn&#x27;t weigh your hair down.  I let a friend try some and she&#x27;s going to get a bottle!  The fact that the oil is not loaded with additives and chemicals is great- no problems with toxins on your skin and hair.  I really like the stuff, hope you do as well.</li>
    <li> I have been using argan oil the last three years and this is my first time using Pura D&#x27;or and I can say that is really good. It&#x27;s an excellent product with a really good price.</li>
    <li> I purchased this as a gift for my wife and she is loving it.  She has curly/wavy hair and she&#x27;s mentioned to me that it already feels healthier after only a few days of using it.  I&#x27;ve even used a bit for my face to prevent dry skin during the winter time and it&#x27;s really made a difference.  I don&#x27;t wake up in the morning with greasy or oily skin.  Overall this is a great product and we will continue to use it.</li>
    <li> The thought of putting oil on my face made no sense to me at first but friends highly recommended I try it so I did. Argan oil almost immediately absorbs into your skin and does not leave behind a greasy feeling. I put this on my face and neck after showering and after washing my face at night and in the morning my face is baby soft. I think after using it only a week my skin tone is more even.  This brand comes in a nice thick glass bottle, and is organic and sustainably sourced which were a plus for me. No fragrance, just a light nutty scent that you only notice if you try.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Josie Maran&#x27;s argon oil from sephora for the past year.  It&#x27;s $50 for a 2oz bottle.&lt;br /&gt;I did s search for a compatible argan oil with a better price, and came across pura d&#x27;or  I decided to give give it a try.  The price is right and it&#x27;s organic.  It has no smell, moisturizers your skin great, and it also leave yr skin glowing.  I love the pump too.  I will be using this life!&lt;br /&gt;Thank you.</li>
    <li> I just received the container and it was obviously not filled to anywhere near the top so I measured it.  It came out to 3.8 ounces, not 4.  Still probably a good deal, but obviously some skimming or poor QA is going on.  Either way, I got less than what I paid for. I&#x27;ll not buy it again based on principle.</li>
    <li> We absolutely love this new addition to our lotion and cream making arsenal. We purchased this oil because its wonderful conditioning properties and because they offer it in an organic option. The oil has certainly added a nice touch and has earned a permanent spot in our lotion and body cream recipes. We also like the fact that we can use oil alone as a wonderful conditioner for our hair and face. It does not cause us to break out and leaves our hair feeling very nice. We don&#x27;t use regular conditioner because we don&#x27;t like putting chemicals in our hair, this is a very nice alternative and once again a must have for your moisturizing arsenal. ENJOY!!!</li>
    <li> Very high quality Argan oil. This is my second order. I use this to make my own products at home, and I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> This oil is great. I&#x27;ve been using it for some time now can definitely see the benefits. I use it mostly on my skin, it absorbs quickly and is a must in a winter time. I don&#x27;t plan to switch to any other brand.</li>
    <li> What is the best place to keep it- refrigerator or any place away from sun light?</li>
    <li> This will be the last thing you ever buy for your hair. It&#x27;s an oil that isn&#x27;t oily. Doesn&#x27;t weigh down your hair. Helps with body and shine. I also use in on my skin and especially my face! This is a win!!!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s very moisturizing. I&#x27;ve been using it as a facial moisturizer and as a leave in conditioner (mids to ends of hair). I&#x27;ve noticed a few more blemishes on my face lately but I&#x27;ve also been using rosehip oil which may be the offender or it may be diet related. I really love this oil, it&#x27;s the first time I&#x27;ve ordered argan oil so I don&#x27;t have a lot to compare it to but it&#x27;s really nice.</li>
    <li> Pleasant scent, great clarity, obviously a well-refined oil. Packaging is great and dispenser yields perfect quantities of product. Hair feels great all day and night (not icky). Is not very viscous, presumably due to containing mostly unsaturated fatty-acids, so it washes out with a small amount of shampoo or soap under cold water. It&#x27;s the only product I use now, no more dry, frizzy, chemically tainted, artificially scented, or unnaturally shaped hair akin to merely vain tendencies! (I kid, but really..)</li>
    <li> Fabulous! I use a little bit on my hair once or twice a week to help with chronic dryness/frizziness (I live in central florida) and this stuff is MAGIC. My hair is soft and this argan oil helps protect the ends and also makes it super shiny! I am SO happy with it and have already recommended it to my sisters and girlfriends! A+ Product!</li>
    <li> This stuff is really great! I have been using it on my face daily and my skin looks amazing! I have very sensitive combination skin so I cannot use most of regular creams/moisturizers on my face. I have used several different kinds of oils on my face in the past but they always left my skin very shiny and slippery. Pura d&#x27;or argan oil gets absorbed really well - no more shiny face and it doesn&#x27;t stain my pillows when I use it at night. I have very oily skin on my forehead and very dry skin around my mouth. This oil really moisturizes dry skin and makes oily skin less oily! After just a few uses, skin looks and feels great, very smooth and definitely reduces redness/irritations. I also tend to break out once in while but since I&#x27;ve been using this oil daily on my face, I noticed that I break out a lot less.  I also use it on my hands to help with dry and irritated skin and on my hair to fight frizz. It works so much better than expensive hair/skin treatments full of harmful chemicals and additives. It&#x27;s also affordable and I cannot really tell the difference between Pura dor argan oil and the more expensive brands.</li>
    <li> I found this product so effective that i recommended it to my mom and my sister. Now my sister&#x27;s mother-in-law and sister-in-law are also fans! I&#x27;ve tried many expensive brands without thinking that the more natural the moisturizer the better it will go with my skin. The Vitamin E content of this oil has given my face a new glow, cleared out my skin tone and is light enough to be used during the day or nighttime, summer and winter. Thank god this is also so affordable!</li>
    <li> Have purchased much more expensive supposed USDA certified Argan oil over the years, and am very familiar with its properties -- and this is indeed a bargain which definitely does the job(s) that Argan oil claims to do and has become the current rage.  The oil is the correct density, color and smell tests, and is packaged in dark amber glass bottle.  I would purchase again and again and again . . . .</li>
    <li> Just received my second bottle of Pura d&#x27;or Pure &amp; Organic Argan Oil.  I use the oil daily on my entire body, face, and hair.  Love it!! It&#x27;s not too heavy and I only have to use a small amount.  The 4 oz bottle comes with a spray that&#x27;s wonderful.  Just the right amount comes out and it doesn&#x27;t spray all over the place.  I especially like that this oil is pure and organic and it&#x27;s odorless.  I am a former hairdresser and have used many products in my life and find that simple is the best.  I certainly recommend this oil and this brand to everyone!</li>
    <li> I have wanted to try Pura d&#x27;or Organic Argan Oil for sometime, because I&#x27;ve loved other Pura d&#x27;or products. After the first night, my skin feels so soft. I will continue to use it as a nightly moisturizer and update in the coming weeks.</li>
    <li> Love this product! I use it on my legs in lieu of lotion and I don&#x27;t get itchy or dry.</li>
    <li> When I first came across this product, I was skeptical, but after doing some online research I decided that the price was reasonable enough that it would be worth trying.  As I have aged, my hair has become somewhat brittle and I have been searching for something that will help return some of the shine and silkiness that it once had.  I was pleasantly surprised when this product actually lived up to its hype.  I&#x27;ve been using Pura d&#x27;or Argan Oil for about a month and myy hair has regained some of it&#x27;s shine and is looking healthier without the greasiness of so many leave in conditioners and hair grooming products. I&#x27;ve even been using it on my face and body and have noticed a definite difference in the softness and improved appearance of my skin.</li>
    <li> I was an oil skeptic for years as I grew up being told that putting oil on your face is one of the worst skin offenses. I had oily and dry skin, never thinking my face was producing oil was being so dry. After using this oil after washing my face, it felt smooth and plump again. It&#x27;s light enough to wear under makeup and gets the job done. My skin has finally calmed down enough to look and feel normal. I don&#x27;t see how I went so long without trying this after hearing rave reviews. You don&#x27;t know what you&#x27;re missing out on until you try this. And this bottle will last me forever even with daily use. Love it!</li>
    <li> This is a great oil. Not too thick, not too strong of a scent. I use it on face, body and a hair and it is great on all. We live in Colorado, so it is pretty dry year round This is something I will always have on hand. Works as well as some much more expensive products I&#x27;ve used. Great value!</li>
    <li> I am a reformed hair-product junkie. Come to think of it, I ditched all my lotions too. This oil is the only thing I use now days to moisturize my skin and tame my frizzies--and I&#x27;ve tried dozens upon dozens of pastes, sprays, leave-conditioners and lotions. Not that those products didn&#x27;t work, but I finally got wise to the fact that an ingredient list that sounds like a chemical dump is not necessary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the simplicity and versatility of argan oil. It absorbs nicely into the skin without being too greasy. It&#x27;s perfect for feet. As for my hair, a little goes a loooong way. In fact, usually I apply the oil to my skin first, then run my hands through damp hair. The trace of oil left on my hands is the perfect amount to keep my fairly coarse hair smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pura d&#x27;or seems to be the most economical pure organic argan oil out there. Compared to other products with argan oil in them, the pure oil has very little scent, which I prefer. It allows me to mix in whatever essential oils I&#x27;m in the mood for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a repeat customer, and plan to continue to buy this product.</li>
    <li> Hands down the best nut oil I have ever used on my face.  While I do not have terribly problematic skin, in that I do not have cystic acne, I have been prone to painful and large blemishes that would take so long to clear.  In my research to find another product that would clear my skin without a chemical burn, I found literature on nut oil moisturizer.  I jumped on the coconut oil bandwagon, but it always left my face too shiny and I did not notice the benefit.  Further research led me to argan oil and specifically this brand.  Every tip I read on how to buy quality argan oil on the internet was met by Pura Dor.  I immediately enjoyed how well my skin absorbed the argan oil.  It does not feel or look greasy and my skin glows.  I would typically break out around certain times of the month or if I was eating more processed foods than normal.  Now that I have switched to argan oil I almost never break out.  When I do the blemishes are literally the size of a pin point and gone the next day.  It cannot be expressed how much I love this argan oil and how much my skin has improved.  I use a castile soap to wash and this to moisturize, nothing else.  I love my complexion and I get so many compliments (and I do not wear makeup).  I am beyond impressed with the quality of this oil and the effects on my skin.</li>
    <li> I just received this and have used it over the past few days.  I was worried about putting oil on my face but due to positive reviews of this product, I decided to try it.  It does not make my skin more oily at all! I really like the product and plan on using it it daily in my skin care regime.  My skin feels great!</li>
    <li> TO GIVE AN HONEST REVIEW REQUIRES ME TO USE IT - AND  I HAVEN&#x27;T.  BASED ON HOLLYWOOD STAR REVIEWS, I BELIEVE I WILL LIKE IT.  WILL UPDATE LATER.  PURCHASED A LOT OF ARGAN OIL LATELY AND IT WILL TAKE SOME TIME TO ACCURATELY REVIEW AND THAT&#x27;S WHY I GAVE IT 3 STARS.</li>
    <li> I rarely make comments on a product but I LOVE this one - I noticed such a difference especially on my hair from the first time I used it -  I spritz a small amount on my hair brush and brush it good morning and night - I use a small amount with pure organic rose water as a moisturizer on my face and like it better than my previous moistuizer that I&#x27;ve used for years. It means a lot to a 67 year old grandmother!</li>
    <li> I bought this about a week ago after reading a lot of great reviews. I am glad to say all the positive reviews are true. This oil has healed and changed my face which had some acnes. It smells great and is not greasy. I have tried many other brands but Pura d&#x27;or Argan oil is by far the best of the bunch. I really recommend this product for any one as this is natural and easier way of healing and regenerating any skin and hair damages.</li>
    <li> My wife and I both really liked this product.  It really makes her skin soft and we both like the way that it makes our hair look and feel.  She already liked running her fingers through my hair, but she has commented on how much nicer it is and how much better it looks.  I&#x27;ve also noticed that, although her hair was always beautiful, it has made a difference for her too.  Fantastic product.  I&#x27;d recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> This product is great! My friend gives one to me and she said is good for your whole body so i listened to her and used it for a week or so and it is great for my hair. so i fund this product on amazon and order this product and is as perfect as the product my friend gives me......i really recommend this product.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s amazing I love it</li>
    <li> I purchased this product to help with the after-care of a recent cartilage piercing and it made SUCH a difference! It really helps to soothe the sore tissue, as well as help with the inflammation around my ear. Plus, it&#x27;s good for my hands and cuticles too! Love it :-)</li>
    <li> I could honestly say I love this product. It has really helped me with my damaged hair, I put it in my hair after I wash it and it leaves it looking healthy and soft. My skin also feels very smooth after applying it on my face. I definitely recommend this product!</li>
    <li> I am using this product for my hair along with Pura d’or Premium Organic Anti-Hair Loss Shampoo for a couple of days now.I must say, I see a difference in softness and my hair feel more healthy.</li>
    <li> I like this oil because it is priced well, especially for the amount.  A little goes a long way, and it does not leave a greasy residue.  I found it to be very effective.  It makes me feel that I am doing something good for my skin.  Fun Product!!</li>
    <li> I LOVE THIS OIL! I am a natural hair black woman with type 4 hair and had been searching for Argan Oil that was not a &amp;#34;mix&amp;#34; or combination of Argan Oil and was authentic. I hit gold with this one. Its expensive in a sense but a little goes ALONG WAY. Mine lasts about 6-8 months My hair and skin loves it and I LOVE the convenient pump it comes with. It prohibits me from &amp;#34;over pouring&amp;#34; what I don&#x27;t necessarily &amp;#34;need&amp;#34;. It&#x27;s worth the price and I come back every time :)</li>
    <li> Great argan oil product.  I use this as face moisturizer.  This is the second bottle I&#x27;ve ordered thus far.  I got a sample of Jose Maran and I think this is just as good.</li>
    <li> nice and shinny.It is a great product.</li>
    <li> I love this oil.  It is very light and works well on my skin and hair.  The one criticism I have is that it is often too light for my skin.  You may need to mix it with a little coconut oil or jojoba oil if your skin is a little dry.  All in all, this is a great purchase for a good price.</li>
    <li> Just received this in the mail and couldn&#x27;t wait to try it. The oil is very light with a barely there scent. It absorbed immediately into my skin without feeling greasy. I often use coconut oil and love the scent but it stays greasy for a long time after application. This oil immediately absorbed into my skin which was perfect!!  I have cracked fingerti</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for 6 months now and it truly is a all in one beauty aid. My skin has never been so soft and supple. I use it on my face and neck before I put on my makeup and after washing my face at night I put it on again as a night cream. I also use it on my skin as a moisturizer and on my hair for added shine and control.&lt;br /&gt;Before buying this product I did use another more advertised brand for a much higher price but after doing my due diligence in researching other similar products I found that Pura d&#x27;or is the best product with the best price and truly delivers results.  I will be using it as long as they make it.</li>
    <li> This oil is fabulous - light, non-greasy, very softening, has made a nice difference in my hands/elbows in only a few days.  I bought a bottle for my sister and she loves it too.  I love that the oil is free of fragrance and has a nice spray instead of a messier eyedropper.This is a well-priced product and I am happy to have found it.  Will definitely be buying it again!</li>
    <li> I would purchase it again &amp; again</li>
    <li> I had used another brand which cost a lot more, but, will use this one from now on. I am in my 70&#x27;s,  have dry skin and live in a very dry climate and love how moist my skin feels after rubbing on just a couple of drops!  I actually use it on my face, hair,  cuticles,  elbows and heels.</li>
    <li> Great quality. Smoothes my hair, leaves it soft. Tames frizz. I don&#x27;t smell an odor. It took a couple of trys to get how much I should use. I have long, thuck hair. One pump for the top and sides and a separate second pump for the length of my hair eith special attention to my ends. Works beautifully. I will buy again.</li>
    <li> I have been using Argan Oil for a few years now. Earlier to this purchase I have used Wattz beauty brand sold at Amazon and also from local health foods store(Sprouts)  but I must tell this by far the best I have used. I use it on my face and hair, It smells and feels real nice.</li>
    <li> Love it!  Makes my hair and skin look great!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only had it a few days, but cannot tell you how impressed I am.  I keep looking in the mirror to make sure I&#x27;m seeing what I think I&#x27;m seeing.  I have very dry, aged skin. I&#x27;ve been using this oil as a moisturizer in the morning and evening and it&#x27;s making a world of differince in my skin texture and appearance. I&#x27;ts smoother and softer, the wrinkles are not as noticeable.&lt;br /&gt;I used it on my hair yesterday, and my wiry thick, wavy hair is tamed.  Good grief, is this stuff a miracle?</li>
    <li> I bought this product because i want to try applying argan oil as a moisturizer. Based on the reviews and the price I definitely do not regret this purchase! I have really sensitive and dry skin and I have been on a search for a good moisturizer that will not irritate my skin. Usually moisturizers that do not work for my skin will make me form red dry patches, especially around my mouth and nose area. This argan oil did not do that! I can feel my skin to be a lot smoother and I seriously just use one pump each time i apply it to my face. I did also try using it for my hair. i recommend to only use it on dry hair especially if your hair is very thin. I used it on wet hair once and the results were not that nice. it made my hair look nappy and oily which was not that appealing. If you do have thin and dry hair i recommend only using a little bit and only at the ends so it does not weigh down your hair.</li>
    <li> The product has a VERY faint smell, but it does not smell bad. Usually when I wear oils, the smell bothers me. I also like that it isn&#x27;t too greasy. One pump is all you really need. When I used two pumps it started to look greasy. I dabbed a little on my face and it feels very soft. Overall, I like this product.</li>
    <li> Love this because it is on-greasy, soaks quickly into the skin and has no fragrance.  It eliminated some rough spots on my hands in only a couple of days and leaves the skin very soft.</li>
    <li> Never used pure argan oil before, so I thought I&#x27;d try it. My hair has been very dry and nothing seems to help. Applied the argan oil to my damp hair after washing, and it became very soft and manageable. Applied again this morning to just my dry fried ends before touching up with the curling iron. Worked great and doesn&#x27;t look greasy. I have also applied it to my face and nails. Nails and cuticles became smoother overnight--amazing. Did not clog my pores and my skin is softer. Also used on my crepey neck:) Hope it will help that, too. Love the fact that is is pure with no fillers or junk.</li>
    <li> I love this Argan oil - it&#x27;s the best !!!</li>
    <li> Hey people so i have been using this oil for about 2 months, ill honestly say its a good product, it is really light and absorbs into the skin rapidly and the next day your face will not have a oily residue. Its a good moisturizer and by the looks of it it will last a very long time .</li>
    <li> I used to buy some knockoff argan oil from Walgreens that is actually a mixture of oils with a tiny amount of argan oil that I would put in after I shower but it would leave my hair feeling oily afterward and in the morning my hair was still dry. This 100% argan oil is amazing though. Immediately after putting it on my hair it feels so soft and not oily at all. I definitely plan on sticking to the real deal!</li>
    <li> OMG !!! I have allergies and dry skin. I went on vacation and used this everyday and I felt great. No dryness.  The hot sun everyday normally would have given me a rash but using this both on my face and hair, I was great.  Loved it.</li>
    <li> Love, love, love. I just received it today and immediately put some one my hair. I don&#x27;t put style product on my hair (not even hair spray) because of all my allergies and my hair is long and grey (grey hair doesn&#x27;t like a lot of hair products). But the oil is amazing. My hair is shiny and looks very healthy. I also put some on my arms and legs and my skin is soft without being oily. I&#x27;m going to try it on my face at bedtime and again before my makeup. Oh, I also like that there is NO scent because since I&#x27;m going to use it all over my body I certainly don&#x27;t want to smell like something unidentifiable.  :&amp;#62;)  Thank you. Thank you.</li>
    <li> Very nice product.  Using on my skin, face and hair.  Controls my frizzy hair and applies easily. Expected it to be thicker, but is easy to apply this way.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve stopped messing around with cheaper Argan Oils and decided on the pura d&#x27;or brand due to other reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using it for only a week, I&#x27;m very impressed.&lt;br /&gt;I typically run or bicycle as part of my work commute.  Showering 2x each day isn&#x27;t really feasible, so I end up with a quick wipe down at the work bathroom.  I give my hair a quick rinse and add some Argan Oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Where other oils had provided virtually no benefit, the Pura d&#x27;or gives my hair a healthy shine and provides a much needed texture to make it look like I didn&#x27;t run to work; I don&#x27;t want to be the homely looking employee.  This Argan Oil has a pleasant scent (one that has been distinctly missing from the cheaper oils I have purchased).&lt;br /&gt;Not only do I blend in, but I&#x27;ve received multiple compliments on the &amp;#34;shine&amp;#34; my hair now has.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely glad I spent the extra money to get a great product!</li>
    <li> I used to use Josie brand argon oil and bought this for a better price and I don&#x27;t see a difference. I love the oil for my dry skin. I use it for multiple places. I love it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Pura dor Argon Oil for about a year.  It has replaced all the expensive serums I&#x27;ve bought for years.  I&#x27;m 54 years young, people always commenting on my skin. How good it looks for my age.  I use it on face, neck and chest area,  oil absorbs quickly and really hydrates.  I love it.  It lasts a long time as a little goes a long way.  Price is great too, I know Josie Maran would be at least twice the cost for the amount.  I use faithfully morning and night.</li>
    <li> THIS IS THE BEST OIL EVER. I USE IT EVEYDAY FROM HEAD TO TOE ONCE OUT OF THE SHOWER. I AM A BALD MAN, AND IT IS GREAT ON A BALD HEAD. I WANT MORE!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I use this on my face and hair and love it.  My hair is thick and naturally curly.  It&#x27;s not too heavy and gives a nice shine.</li>
    <li> I ordered this after a very extensive research&lt;br /&gt;I even went to sephora to test the josie moran argan oil, pura D&#x27;or is better&lt;br /&gt;My skin is changing, smooth and younger i already ordered one for my mom&lt;br /&gt;This oil makes all the requirements for argan oil, color, consistency and smell&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you! And please never compromise the quality because his one is great!!!</li>
    <li> just recieved it..and its favulous.every night i use it as a moisturizer and it makes my skin feel soft</li>
    <li> Love how this makes my skin feel!!!</li>
    <li> Excellent product! It absorbs quickly when I apply it on my face that&#x27;s why there is no greasy feeling. It is unscented, too. I bought this  at a great price from Amazon. I will definitely buy this again in the future because of its superb quality.</li>
    <li> I love this argan oil and have been using it daily for several months. I have always used quality face creams and switched every so often never 100% satisfied or just looking for something better (I have very dry, and sensitive skin). This product has completely replaced everything I was using as part of my skin care routine, including face wash and eye makeup remover. I use 3-4 pumps (which is a very small dime size amount) all over my face and neck after showering in the morning and again as a face wash and moisturizer in one before bed. My skin no longer ever feels dry &amp; itchy and my eyes don&#x27;t get irritated and watery like they did from almost all other products I&#x27;ve used. This is a great quality oil and a great price compared to other brands of argan oil I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
    <li> I was using a different argan oil that came with my HSI straightener. I liked it, though the fragrance made it seem fake. I went to order more argan oil like the one from the straightener and came across this.&lt;br /&gt;The first thing I noticed were the great reviews and all of the doctor and organic product certifications. When I first applied it to my damp hair, there was not a fragrance! The giveaway that the oil had not been tampered with other products :) a little goes a long way, and feels great on my shoulders. When my hair dries with this stuff ( I have hick, wavy, frizzy hair) it&#x27;s not greasy and there&#x27;s no frizz!! I will be ordering this as a Christmas gift!</li>
    <li> This Argan oil has a strong scent than Josie Maran&#x27;s, which I do not like. However, it is a lot cheaper. If you plan to use this only on your body, I think it&#x27;s fine since you save money (4 fl of Josie Maran is $96 and this is 4 fl oz for 25% of that price).  However, if you are using it for your face, it has this super nutty/wood smell (it probably smells different to each person,) but both 2 bottles of Josie Maran that I have do not have this same mildly offensive smell. Would buy again for the good price and value. It also is milder in smell than two other bottles of Argan oil I have purchased on Amazon (I had to return those two because I couldn&#x27;t tolerate how smokey it smelled/it reminded me of cooking oil.)</li>
    <li> I have always struggled to find a product that moisturizes but doesn&#x27;t feel oily but I love this oil!! The results were great and quick. I highly recommend this argan oil for the face since that is where I use it the most and wanted results. The way my skin looks and feels is noticeably better. I will never go without!!</li>
    <li> I was going to by the more expensive Josie Maran and decided to try this first.  Boy am I glad I decided to try Pura d&#x27;or. I have had lots of hormone changes after giving birth to twins my face it breaking out like it never has before. I also use it on my hair as a conditioner and it has never been softer.  I have begun to try it on my scars and I have no doubt it will improve my skin.  If you have doubts about this don&#x27;t! It&#x27;s fantastic.</li>
    <li> Used everyday for skin, nails and wavy extremely frizzy hair with fly aways. Chemical free product Best for anyone. One advice: try to be patient as it heals your skin, hair and nail and not cover the flaws. It will make your hair oily if used more than you need but it leaves hair nourished and moisturizes even after wash.</li>
    <li> Pure Argan oil, works great! Same quality as others but a much better price!</li>
    <li> I have extremely dry, sensitive skin. It calms down my fine, frizzy, angry menopausal hair, cleaning without weighing down or stripping it. It&#x27;s made mostly of natural ingredients- good for my hair and ecologically non-toxic.&lt;br /&gt;It has a very light, almost nonexistent, smell - nice, because I&#x27;m not too fond of products that smell like they were created in a cheap perfume factory.</li>
    <li> My wife is using more than I do. She has been using twice daily on face, arm , neck, under eyes.  She applies to her hair for smoothness. She really likes this oil. It feels smooth and feels like it is repairing skin by tightness. I use little amount after shower, after washing hands, or before going to sleep on my dry finger skin. Why use expensive creams? It little thicker. It is perfect for winter dry air in house. Best part about this is it made of USDA organic stuff and it 100% pure as it says on bottle. It is expensive for its size, but so are the other Argan oil brands.</li>
    <li> Great good moisturizer</li>
    <li> I have been using the argan oil for almost a month now and my skin feels a lot tighter and brighter. I can easily walk out the door with no makeup on and with just argan oil and my face looks very natural.  will definitely purchase again. I am saying good bye to all other face lotions.</li>
    <li> I had been using Josie Maran 100% pure organic argan oil. Her 4 fl. oz. bottle is double the price of Pura d&#x27;or 100% pure &amp; USDA organic argan oil. I did research and found the Pura d&#x27;or brand. I am extremely pleased with it. I tell people close to me that it is gold in a bottle. I like the pump dispenser on Pura d&#x27;or versus a dropper on the former brand I used. My makeup lasts longer and I don&#x27;t get the oily t-zone half way through the day. I used to use blotting sheets half way though the day and no longer half to. I had occasionally experienced breakouts even at age 48, but no longer do with Pura d&#x27;or argan oil. Even my large pores have decreased with this product. I am a new fan and believer in Pura d&#x27;or argan oil and will definitely continue to purchase it. I don&#x27;t ever want to be without it!</li>
    <li> My sister let me use some of her oil when she was here for a visit and the difference it made I knew I had to have my own! I tend to have the dry &#x27;T&#x27; area along with under my eyes the powder make up I use would &#x27;cake&#x27;...not any more! My skin has a &#x27;glow&#x27; to it, there is no more dry skin for me and I now use it for my body and hair as well! Using on the hair was a wonderful way to make it shiny and yet, it does not feel greasy like you might expect oil to do. Shopping around you&#x27;ll also not find a better price on a bottle this size...4oz may sound small but I was surprised just how big it is! I love that it is a product that does what it says it&#x27;ll do!!!!</li>
    <li> My hair feels a lot better since I&#x27;ve been using Argan oil. I intend to keep using it from now on. My hair is starting to show my natural color again, never thought this would be possible. Many friends have commented on it. Will recommend to every one.</li>
    <li> I First time tried this brand of argan oil and was very pleased with the quality of Pura D&#x27;or pure argan oil.It&#x27;s very good stuff ,I would recommend this product to my friends.</li>
    <li> Slightly menthol scented, but it did absorb quickly and cleanly</li>
    <li> the light scent (natural) disappears after a few seconds. I use this on my skin at night, and in my hair after washing before blow drying. I even used it on vacation on my body when i ran out of my body lotion. I prefer not to use it under make up as it can make the make up a little smudgy, otherwise its a lovely dry oil, there is no grease, and people often comment on the glow in my complexion.</li>
    <li> This oil is very greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So if you need something lubricated, it does a great job of that, but it will sit on your skin and not soak in because it&#x27;s much too viscous.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I mentioned this to a friend very knowledgeable about these things and she agreed that this is simply not good at moisturizing because it doesn&#x27;t absorb into the skin.</li>
    <li> Good for acne scars. And I use it as face serum.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for several months now and love the way my skin looks and feels! It absorbs quickly and gives my face a nice radiant youthful glow. Definitely recommended!</li>
    <li> This came nicely packaged and smells delightful and earthy. I usually buy the expensive stuff from sephora, but this is way more affordable. I love that it&#x27;s so multi-purpose, I use it on my face as a moisturizer and to calm my zits down, to my hair to tame fizziness and seal up dry ends.</li>
    <li> Highly recommend this Argan oil for hair, nails and as an aftershave treatment. The product is very light and absorbs quickly into the skin. It also has a very mild scent in comparison to other oils I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
    <li> This is a very good product and a wonderful moisturizer for my hair.</li>
    <li> I love this product! plus, delivery was prompt, the price is right and it even came with a little carry bag.</li>
    <li> I am giving it a 5, but I would rate it a 4.5 because it did not eliminate my frizz. I am always looking for stuff to make my hair 100% frizz free (it does reduce the frizz), but I have never found anything. However, with just the oil in my hair, my hair looks like I styled it. I do need to put product in because throughout the day, my curls will begin to become more frizzy without anything holding them. I bought this to use on my hair. It should be noted that currently, I am using a curling cream product that contains argan oil as well as the Pura d&#x27;or shampoo and conditioner. With just one pump, my hair is shiny. Any more than one pump, and it starts to look greasy. However, today I did not use my curling cream and I put five pumps in my hair (just to give it some extra conditioning over the weekend), and it didn&#x27;t look too oily. I think it&#x27;s just a combination of all the products that I use that allow me to only use one pump. Also, my hair is waist length, curly, and thick. I would recommend only applying the oil below the scalp because otherwise it looks too greasy on the top of the head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I tried one pump on my face and it helped my acne! I bought their special acne treatment oil and it seems to be working well so far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I liked the results of the oil, so I bought the Pura d&#x27;or Tranquility Shampoo and Pura d&#x27;or Conditioner because of how well the oil worked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love how the scent it very light and I no longer smell it once I put it in my hair. This is crucial to me because I have a very strong sense of smell, so I get migraines if anything smells too strong. Overall, I have found this to be a wonderful product that has multiple uses. Once my Bio Oil is gone, I will purchase Pura d&#x27;or&#x27;s product for scars.</li>
    <li> I dont write much review unless the item is useless. I bought this product due to many positive review but I now know most of them is paid review and not actual review from buyers. Item was absolute waste of money and I have tried to contact seller and return it but the option was not available since it was more than 30 days. Do not waste your money if you want to buy Argan oil try something different. DO NOT BE FOOLED BY MANY POSITIVE REVIEW FROM SUPPOSEDLY PAST BUYERS!</li>
    <li> I have been using argan oil of different brands. They all gave me some sort of good results but I tried to find one brand that I can stick with. I must say there was an expensive brand that actually smelled like it&#x27;s spoiled. There are two things I notice about Pura d&#x27;or argan oil. It gives very light but pleasant smell which I like. It leaves a good, silky touch on my skin. I would say &amp;#34;so far so good&amp;#34; for this product. Whether or not this is the one I would stick with is yet to find out. But it&#x27;s very likely.</li>
    <li> I just got my bottle the other day and so far, I really like it. I have been using it on my face before I put my moisturizer on. My skin feels great. Can&#x27;t wait to try it on my hair.</li>
    <li> I just received this in the mail today, and applied it on after my clay mask.  It felt great! The consistency is better than another argon oil I had used (which was great too, but this one seems better and purer).  It is clearer and does not have any odor.  It also seemed to absorb better the the other one I had used.  The packaging was beautiful--it came in a cute little pouch, and the pump is great! :)</li>
    <li> Great moisturizer with natural ingredients.</li>
    <li> I have naturally coarse wavy hair.  I was always struggling with split ends until I discovered argan oil.  I have tried several different brands and some are pretty expensive.  But I was pleasantly surprised with the Pura d&#x27;or argan oil.  It has a reasonable price and it works much better than some of the others that I have tried. The Pura d&#x27;or argan oil leaves my hair soft and manageable.  Some have left a greasy film on my hair, but not this one.  I think it is completely absorbed into my hair. I will definitely purchase this again.</li>
    <li> Works AMAZING as a hair mask! My hair has never been so shiny or felt so soft! This is better than any other argon oil I have tried, will be repurchasing!</li>
    <li> This works great for face and nails. I&#x27;ve been using it morning and night on my face for 1 week, and my complexion is getting soft and supple. I usually apply it after I put on my eye cream, then warm up my face with my palm to help it fully absorb. I also found it helped my skin heal more quickly. I use it as hand care oil, and it works better than Gardeners&#x27; Hand Therapy</li>
    <li> I recommend to use this oil.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using grapeseed oil, jojoba oil, and other oils as an after shower moisturizer for a long time.  It is a much better method than any body lotion.  I used this product just once and can see a huge difference in the quality of the oil.  I use about 2 pea sized drops in the palm of my hand and massage it through my damp hair and face after stepping out of the shower.  The oil moisturizes nicely without leaving a greasiness like the other oils.  I makes your hair shine and does not weigh it down.  No oily residue throughout the day.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> This is a great moisturizer for the skin. I have eczema and tried lots of different products. First let me point out that this bottle lasts a very long time. It moisturizers both my skin and hair without that greasy feeling. I am happy to have found this product.</li>
    <li> I love mine! I added a few drops of lavender</li>
    <li> i just used it in my hair today and it is fantastic.  Works great on my hair!</li>
    <li> It helps me a lot in moisturizing my very dry skin. I&#x27;m using it in my hair as well and it is good, it prevents split ends and keeps my hair moisturized.</li>
    <li> i have been using other brand&#x27;s Argan oil for a while and choose this brand based on reviews and I am glad that I ordered this oil.  My skin feels very soft and nice and no break outs!</li>
    <li> I just received my bottle in the mail yesterday.  First of all, you cannot beat the price.  I bought the Josie Maran Argan Oil, which I liked, but it was much pricier than this.  The packaging on the product was very cute and was a nice touch.  Since I have only been using it for one day my review is slightly limited.  I used the product on my cuticles, my hair and my upper arms.  Immediately, I noticed that my hair seemed shinier and much less frizzy, although I may have used too much because it is slightly flat.  Moving forward, I am hoping that this product helps out my dry cuticles, especially with winter coming, and helps cure some of the KP I have on my upper arms.</li>
    <li> I use this product in my hair and it is very effective. This oil is so concentrated that only two-three drops will make your hair shine and look healthy.</li>
    <li> awesome!...best available product for face and hair. A little goes a long way so a single bottle lasts a long time.  smells great! My skin looks better then ever ...smooth and clear even in the cold weather when it usually gets dry and flaky!</li>
    <li> I liked this Argan Oil because it does not have any scent so I can easily use it on my face. The skin after application of this oil becomes very soft, This oil is non-greasy and does not make hair heavy or sticky. I will definitely buy some more of this oil and recommend it to my friends.</li>
    <li> I like using this for my hair and skin.  It helps my hair look healthier and my face softer.  Will order again.</li>
    <li> After trying a number of different belly balms over the course of three pregnancies, I came across this oil. I try to avoid any chemicals in general, but especially during pregnancy.  After reading that Argan oil can be used to prevent and treat stretch marks, I decided to give it a try.  I chose this one because it is organic and pure Argan oil -- which gets a great rating on the Environmental Workin Group&#x27;s Skin Deep website.  I am 7 months into my third pregnancy I can definitely feel the difference.  In the past I haven&#x27;t been able to find anything that reduces the dryness and itching on my stretched belly, but this does the trick! No more itching, my belly appears very well moisturized, and the stretch marks that I had acquired during my last two pregnancies really do seem less noticeable.  I won&#x27;t be able to tell if the stretch marks are really disappearing until pregnancy since I am so stretched right now, but definitely will continue to use the oil in the meantime as I am convinced it is keeping the stretch marks at bay for now!</li>
    <li> I love this product.  I put it on my face and neck at night for moisture.  I use it when I have a blemish on my face and it heals it within two days.  I use it when I have a cold and my nose is chapped and it heals it almost overnight.  My 80 year old mother loves it for her dry scalp.  Well worth every cent.</li>
    <li> I love this product. It has been a skin saver this winter. I use it on my face - it has singularly replaced four other products - and anywhere else that needs extra moisturizing. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Love this oil! I needed something to help with my hair. I have alot of medical problems and take alot of medication as well as treatments. It has done MAJOR damage to my skin and hair. My mom is a cosmetologist so my kids and I have always used salon grade hair and face products. She recommended I try this Argon oil for my hair and skin. It has done wonders! My hair feels soft and looks healthy. It actually helped my hair after 1 use.&lt;br /&gt;I also have let my teenage daughter use it, she has long thick hair...it has helped her as well.</li>
    <li> I like this alot...i have curly hair and it helps with frizz and makes it shine...i feel like I&#x27;m doing my hair good!</li>
    <li> Great effects...using 6 months and will never stop. My skin is smooth ,hydrated and looks glamorous. Wonderful product.</li>
    <li> I was recommended to try it to get rid of dandruff and it works. My hair is also healthier and shinier and I get compliments on it.</li>
    <li> I brought a 4Oz bottle because it was on sale and it had rave reviews on amazon and elsewhere. I must say the oil does live up to the the hype. Here in Chicago the winters are harsh on the skin and my DH&#x27;s skin really gets dry especially on his hands. just a little drop on oil every night has made a lot of difference. This is good but really pricy !!&lt;br /&gt;Would have given 5 stars but the cost is high.</li>
    <li> As a newcomer to argan oil, I was surprised by how versatile it is.  You can apply it to any part of your body, from hair to heels.  My skin absorbs it quickly, no matter where I put it, and because of this, it doesn&#x27;t leave an oily sheen, just a silky softness.  The only application that I did not like was in my hair -- more on that later.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have extremely delicate and sensitive skin on my face, and I had no negative reactions to the oil, even when I applied it under my eyes.  (I did this only after trying it on the rest of my face for a few days.)  My hands are staying hydrated between applications, even after I wash my hands a lot during the day and use alcohol-based germ killer.  Often in the winter I have to use a thick cream on my hands at night, and by the next night, my hands are crying out for more.  If I skip a day of argan, my hands don&#x27;t seem to mind.  The oil is supposed to be good for nail strengthening and cuticle softening.  While it softened my cuticles, I can&#x27;t say what effect, if any, it is having on my nails since they are generally strong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I researched argan oil online so that I would know one should look for when purchasing it.  This brand fits all the criteria:  glass bottle, dark container, cold-pressed oil, 100% argan.  I also discovered from the research that argan oil is perishable (hence the need for a dark bottle), so if you don&#x27;t use it up within six months or so, you should buy a new bottle. The Pura D&#x27;Or Argan Oil uses a pump to dispense the oil, and that can be a little messy.  I also wonder how well it will work when the oil gets near the bottom.  The drips down the side of the bottle from using the pump got a half-star deduction from me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also did a comparison between argan oil and the much cheaper castor oil, which is often used for the same purposes.  Castor oil was much stickier and more difficult to spread.  It also was not absorbed as quickly, which meant that the oily sheen lasted longer.  The argan oil simply feels more silky, and I felt confident that I was spreading a thin layer everywhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now about using it on hair . . . . it was not a good thing for me.  I used a small amount, about as much as I would on my face, and massaged it into my wet hair before styling.  Ick.  Even after combing it through, I could see it and feel it in my dried hair.  The argan oil did not get absorbed as quickly as it did on my skin.  Because I&#x27;m blonde, the argan oil darkened the areas where it stuck.  This might be great to use on dark and/or damaged hair, but it had only negative effects on mine.  I won&#x27;t waste this expensive oil on my head again.  This didn&#x27;t make me love the argan oil any less, but it did teach me where it worked best on my body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Argan oil has been a revelation for me.  I like that a natural, organic oil can actually work better than many preserved, perfumed, chemically-created products. Note:  The manufacturer supplied a sample for review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-- Debbie Lee Wesselmanne argan oil simply feels more silky, and I felt confident that I was spreading a thin layer everywhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now about using it on hair . . . . it was not a good thing for me.  I used a small amount, about as much as I would on my face, and massaged it into my wet hair before styling.  Ick.  Even after combing it through, I could see it and feel it in my dried hair.

    <li> Keeps my skin soft and feels so good</li>
    <li> I was introduced to Argan oil recently and was provided with a sample of Pura D&#x27;Or Pure and Organic Argan Oil.  After researching it and discovering it&#x27;s various cosmetic uses, I have finally settled to using it on my scalp and hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Argan comes from Morocco and this particular cold-pressed Argan oil is pure, has very little scent (if any) and provides a wonderful booster and sheen to hair ... and nourishment to the scalp (especially if it is dry).  I have used this oil on my skin (and I use Virgin Coconut oil as well) and my scalp and hair.  It is oil, so it has the feel of oil without a lot of the heaviness.  Massaged into the roots, it provides vitality and sheen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As I experiment with this product further, I will discover more uses I am sure.  The Pura D&#x27;or brand is packaged in it&#x27;s own cloth bag and created in an environmentally responsible way.  Pura uses the dark glass bottle to limit exposure to light and keeps it simple.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I look forward to enjoying the continued benefits of this oil and would recommend it to anyone who wants a great, healthy sheen to their hair.</li>
    <li> This product has a funny odor to it but it does go away after about 20 minutes. It is moisturizing and does what my other Argan oil does but I won&#x27;t order again because of the odor. I do like the pump spray bottle. This makes for easy application.</li>
    <li> Amazing product! I&#x27;ve been using it for years and it really keeps your skin moisturized and healthy without being oily.</li>
    <li> I was raised to always take care of my skin; but as I&#x27;ve gotten older, I&#x27;ve become a bit more zealous in keeping it hydrated and healthy. At the same time, I&#x27;m also more conscientious now about using more natural products. I&#x27;ll admit to being a bit skeptical at first when I began hearing all the talk of argan oil. Certainly as a younger woman, I&#x27;d avoided putting any \\&quot;oil\\&quot; on my face for fear of breakouts; but even at my age now, old habits die hard, and I was a bit reluctant to start. Finally decided to try it, though. At first, I just pumped several drops to try out on neck and the backs of my hands after drying off after a shower. Then I started putting it on areas of my face that have never broken out (do I sound like a scaredy-cat, or what?). All still good. This argan oil glides on silkily, not slippery or greasy like some oils. When I first apply the oil, there is a definite oil sheen to my skin. Worried me the first time...but it just absorbs in a couple of minutes and I&#x27;m left with soft, protected skin. My biggest surprise was that it seems to maybe have a bit of a healing property to it. I have normal skin that can get a bit dry during the indoor-heat of winter; but, while I am definitely well past the age of regular skin breakouts, every few months or so, I end up with a small blemish on my nose or chin (the only areas of my face that ever tend to be oily). I was really leery of putting the argan oil on these areas. I mean, really, just asking for trouble, right? But, after reading a couple of reviewers say that it cleared up blemishes for them, I tried it on a small blemish that had popped up on the side of my nose. I had been dabbing a Q-tip with an alcohol-based drier on the blemish to make it go away which had the nasty side-effect of making the skin around the blemish dry and flaky. Nothing like calling extra attention to the bump on your nose. Oddly enough, after I finally \\&quot;braved\\&quot; putting the oil on the blemish, the redness went away and the spot was gone in a day or two. Weird...not sure what that&#x27;s all about.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think my favorite way of using argan oil is in my hair. The amount you use should probably be adjusted depending on whether or not you have dry or normal hair and the length of your hair. My hair is normal and about chin length. I rub a couple drops of the oil between my palms and then work it through my hair when it is nearly dry and then finish drying and styling. Just my way of doing it...you can also add to still wet hair. In my hair, it adds shine and conditioning without leaving my hair looking oily. It also does a good job of separating the waves and curls in my hair. The smell of the oil is pleasant...very mild with a faint scent that reminds me of something herbal. After checking into what the \\&quot;scent\\&quot; is, I found that it is just the faint residual smell from the tea tree oil that they use to disinfect their equipment. Still smells nice, though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although I like the product and am finding a number of uses for it, I&#x27;m finding that the argan oil is still not a sufficient replacement for the more emollient-rich night creams that I&#x27;ve been using. With my older skin, it just feels like they remain on my skin longer. Instead I put on a small amount of the Pura D&#x27;or argan oil before heading outside for my morning exercise (also good for chapped lips). I see that Pura D&#x27;or also has an organic Anti-Aging Face Cream available on Amazon (with strong reviews). This cream may have the more emollient, moisturizing feel that I&#x27;m looking for. At $89, I&#x27;ll probably need to wait until I see it available for a lower price before I try it out, though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A sample bottle of Pura D&#x27;or argan oil was provided to me for reviewing purposes.as gone in a day or two.

    <li> This product seems to be doing the trick just fine. You receive a much larger quantity for the same price. I prefer the design of the pump as opposed to the dropper. Overall, excellent replacement for Jose, especially in these economic times.</li>
    <li> Just received this the other day and I cannot believe how amazing it has made my hair feel! I have bleach blonde hair, so my hair is extremely dry and damaged. I&#x27;ve tried so many things to make my hair more manageable and nothing has worked so far until I this. It doesn&#x27;t weigh your hair down or make your feel oily, my only complaint is that I didn&#x27;t find it sooner.</li>
    <li> Good Argan oil and cheaper than Josie Maran</li>
    <li> This is not Argan oil. One pump leaves my thick hair greasy and smelly. Argan oil should have a lovely, nutty smell. This smells faintly of diarrhea. I&#x27;m not being hyperbolic either. It literally has a faint smell of diarrhea.</li>
    <li> Nothing comes close in comparison to this amazing product for relieving dry problem skin conditions.  Nothing!  I am 57, have advanced Palmoplantar Keraterderma (since 2010), which in layman&#x27;s terms is a serious hardening of the skin on the soles of the feet and the palms of the hands.  I live in AZ, an incredibly dry state which adds to this problem of cracked soles and palms that break open and bleed and peal constantly.  My dermatologist has tried everything to cure my condition, which is of course stress related.  I&#x27;ve been on $500 prescriptions for Clobex, Calcitratin, Hydrocortizones, etc. and nothing managed to keep my skin moist, pliable, or allow it to heal.  I&#x27;ve used petroleum jelly and saran wrap to alleviate the condition, but inevitably the skin dries every time after showering and once the shoes are off.  I&#x27;ve used Aveeno Eczema Therapy cream, Cetaphil Restoraderm (for months), and other over the counter remedies recommended by my dermatologist.  They all failed to maintain consistent moisture within the layer of derm beneath the surface skin, and the minute I had to bathe or wash my hands I was back to square one.  Ladies and gentlemen, I&#x27;m here to tell you this is the answer.  This is the one!  The miracle cure.  I&#x27;ve used Pura D&#x27;or now for three days with four small applications to my hands and feet.  I&#x27;ve also bathed, washed my hair, done some housecleaning without gloves, etc, and guess what?  My hands remained soft and pliant.  No kidding!  I was amazed.  And my feet...well, the minute I applied the oil the thickening of the soles began to soften and literally peel off!  I&#x27;ve never had such ease in removing these stubborn and normally painful calluses that crack and bleed.  Well, the bleeding is gone, the calluses have disappeared, the soles are soft and pliable.  I don&#x27;t have to wear socks 24/7 and can now wear my sandals.  I&#x27;ve washed my hands numerous times and they continue to remain soft and pliable--even when using soap!  Even more wonderful is how this oil does not leave an oily residue on your hands or feet.  It soaks in and leaves a silky smooth surface.  I was so excited I applied the same oil to my face and neck area which is now silky smooth.  Then I went over the back of my hands which also eliminated the dry scaling and tiny scabs I acquired working with horses and gardening.  They are now all gone and I have the skin of a baby&#x27;s behind instead.  I can&#x27;t express enough how happy I am with this product!  When you&#x27;ve endured a serious skin condition for years and nothing has worked, then you come across something as amazing as this which is also organic, full of antioxidants, Vitamin A and E, Omega 3s and 6s, Carotene, Phenolic Acid and Amino Acids--all the healthy things in life, it is like being reborn.  I used this oil on my husband&#x27;s arthritic feet for a good long rub and he said he slept like a baby and the callous on the ball of his foot is magically gone. This is the only item you will ever need in your medicine cabinet for fast dry skin relief...ever!  The price is a pittance for this kind of blessed relief and I highly recommend it for anyone with problematic skin conditions.  Heck, I&#x27;ll recommend it to anyone anyways as it is a terrific product and didn&#x27;t disappoint me in the least!ul is how this oil does not leave an oily residue on your hands or feet.

    <li> Great quality oil and a very convenient pump bottle. Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> A few months back, I noticed that I was losing more hair than usual. I recalled an article about the excellent benefits of using &amp;#34;Argan Oil&amp;#34; for hair and nails. Well that led me to do my research on finding a good &amp;#34;Argan Oil&amp;#34;. It has a few weeks I have used Pura d&#x27;or on my hair, nails and eyes area. What an improvement. My hair feels softer and healthier. I applied a dime shape amount of oil into my hair (I have long hair) after washed and let my hair air dry. Pura d’or is really amazing.</li>
    <li> Great product. I makes my skin feel smooth as butter and it&#x27;s working great on the ends of my dry hair.</li>
    <li> I have used moroccon oil previously and was looking for a change. Love the consistency of the oil. Tried it on hair and face and its great.</li>
    <li> Very good product and will order again. Love the feel on my face and my guy says it&#x27;s the best stuff he&#x27;s ever tried for razor burn!</li>
    <li> Not bad like other types of oil.</li>
    <li> Great lightweight product that tames frizz, detangles and softens hair. Good for sensitive skin too! Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! I use it to wash my face and it doesn&#x27;t feel as harsh as over the counter face washes that I have used before. Leaves my face feeling wonderfully soft. I also have used it on my hair over night, when I wash it in the morning it feels so soft!</li>
    <li> I like argan oil. I started to use for my skin. After one week my skin getting softer. Argan oil is amazing. This product is natural, organic and, you do not have to buy expensive brands.</li>
    <li> Good product for hair !</li>
    <li> I have tried so many different Argan oils since it became popular and some made me wonder what the heck was really in the bottle, they didn&#x27;t work well or were to greasy or smelled funny.  I was skeptical to try yet another claim of Argan oil but this one said it was pure and organic so I gave it a try.&lt;br /&gt;I live in the North where it is cold and we use a wood stove, and my skin and hair gets VERY dry and I sometimes have flaky and itchy skin.  I have tried every lotion out there for this condition and nothing worked, the only thing that comes close to moisturizing my dry skin in the winter is oil after a shower.&lt;br /&gt;I tried this Pura D&#x27;or pure argan oil this morning.  I put a bunch into my clean dry hair and then covered it in a warm towel for about 30 minutes.  I made sure to mostly get the ends and massage it into my scalp and then combed it through with a wide tooth comb.  Then I took off the towel and jumped in the shower, I washed my hair with shampoo once, and then put more oil on the ends of my hair and at the nape of my neck where it gets really dry, and then I put my regular conditioner on the ends and left that on for about 6 minutes.  I rinsed and when I dried my hair it was soft, and no tangles, I lost much less hair down the drain as well.&lt;br /&gt;I also used the oil on my body when I got out of the shower, I would use 3 pumps of oil in one hand and a pump of my moisturizing lotion and mix it together and put it on.  If you have dry skin you MUST try this.  My skin is not dry at all, is not tight or itchy and is very soft to the touch. I would highly recommend this Argan oil over all others that I have tried.&lt;br /&gt;I am going to add a few drops of this oil to my conditioner bottle and my body and hand lotion bottles, this way each time I wash my hands or put on lotion I will be getting some of the benefits of this oil.  I am extremely happy with this product.</li>
    <li> I will continue to use this oil at night to see if I gain any benefits, but it does stink. It doesn&#x27;t smell like fish to me, like some of the others have stated. However, it does smell...funky. Like sour rubber...I don&#x27;t even know how to describe it. I definitely don&#x27;t want to be walking around smelling this all day on my face. I mixed it with some Rosehip seed oil and jojoba oil last night before bed and the smell wasn&#x27;t overpowering, but I&#x27;m not super impressed. We want our beauty products to smell nice...not rank. If this is the natural smell of the oil, then maybe it&#x27;s just not the one for me.</li>
    <li> I live in the southern California desert and dry skin and hair are problems I&#x27;m always fighting.  So far, I&#x27;m very pleased with this oil.  It&#x27;s a little heavy to leave on my hair - I put it on at night and wash it out in the morning, but it is lighter than the oils I&#x27;ve been using on my face.  It may be my imagination, but my skin seems to have lightened some.  It has a light sent, I use very little to cover my entire face.&lt;br /&gt;I have a problem with rough heels and I&#x27;ve put some Pura d&#x27; Or Argan Oil on for several nights and the skin is definitely softening.  I would recommend this product to friends without hesitation.</li>
    <li> Highly deodorized. Not 100% unrefined at all. Was very watery. Disappointed</li>
    <li> I was excited to be offered a free bottle of Pura d&#x27;or to use and review.  In the past, I used an olive oil product for moisturizing that I liked but I couldn&#x27;t stand the smell.  Pura d&#x27;or has such a light scent in the bottle that I couldn&#x27;t even smell once it was on my face.  The first night I put it in my hair and all over my face, neck and chest.  My skin is very dry and getting more so as I age.  The next morning I washed my hair  and face in the shower and when I looked in the mirror later I couldn&#x27;t believe how soft and shiny my hair was!  Even after one use the lines on my skin looked relaxed and less deep.  I continued to use it every night for a week and my skin got softer and my lines less noticeable.  I use the oil before bed, then I read for a while and by time I turn off my light the oil has disappeared into my skin so there is no worries about my pillow or sheets being stained.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A little of this oil goes a long way so that a bottle will last quite a while.  I plan on continuing to use it regularly and I&#x27;m going to check out some of the other products made by this company!</li>
    <li> I got this as a gift, of course paid for by my husband. I used it for a few days, not knowing what to expect. One reviewer said it works great for their face and the bottle does say for the skin as well so I tried it. After a good face wash I dabbed on a layer of this oil. At first it felt oily but light. After a few minutes of picking up after myself I noticed I no longer felt the oil. My T-zone felt normal, not clogged. So, I tried this same routine for a few days (I&#x27;ve been using it only once at night after a shower.) I&#x27;m usually not too impressed by gimmicks and new products but I do like this oil. The results?! My blackheads on my T-zone are subsiding or haven&#x27;t built up, that&#x27;s a good sign. The redness around my nose, on my chin and cheeks are subtlely lighter, as though I&#x27;ve dabbed on a layer of BB cream, which I haven&#x27;t yet. The dryness on my temples and the tip of my chin feels normal, not dry to peeling.  I&#x27;ve also tried the oil along with my normal combination of coconut oil and Aveeno lotion for my belly area where I had an incision from a C-sec. Honestly it doesn&#x27;t itch and feels extra moist than normal. My skin feels smooth. I am going to use it longer and try other areas, with or without coconut oil. I&#x27;ll update as soon as I see better results.  But so far this oil is nonclogging, not oily after applied. The scent is subtle yet nice, almost spa-ish like, almost like a natural smell which I have no previous argan oil to compare to. The pump is ok, because sometimes I just want a smaller application like a dot, but the pump does squirt out enough for the whole face. The fact that it&#x27;s also USDA Organic, Cruelty Free, etc. it&#x27;s very self reassuring the oil is supported from reliable resources. I am of Asian origin with light to medium combination skin.</li>
    <li> This is a life changer folks, if you take the gamble just once, pull the trigger on this.  EVERYONE asks what I have done to m y skin and hair.  It has turned back the clock.  My hair and skin are healthy, healthy, healthy!</li>

    <li> I received this for review three weeks ago and have applied it twice a day since then. I was nervous about trying it because I have acne-prone skin, and it seems counter-intuitive to put oil on it. I wrote to the manufacturer to make sure-- \\&quot;is it REALLY okay for acne-prone skin?\\&quot; They assured me it was, so I figured it was worth a shot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Within just a few days, my skin looked much smoother. Like the pores were smaller or something-- I&#x27;m not savvy enough to identify exactly what it is, but it just looked better overall. Still had my usual blemishes, though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Within a week, many of my acne scars/marks had faded.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The next week, the acne got slightly worse, and I thought, \\&quot;See??\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the following week it went away entirely except one pimple. That pimple is now gone. My face is clear... for the first time in years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m amazed. This really is the best my skin has looked in ages! I&#x27;m one of those weirdoes who got acne later in life-- around age 30-- and I&#x27;ve been fighting it ever since. Right now, my routine is just to wash my face with Cetaphil foaming cleanser in the morning and put on this oil (just a small amount, and rub it in-- it sinks in nicely in just a minute or so and doesn&#x27;t look shiny). At night I use astringent and toner, then the oil again. Voila. I normally also do a chemical peel once every week or two, but I haven&#x27;t needed to do it in these past two weeks because my skin is so clear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a believer. Great stuff, and I feel so good about the fact that it&#x27;s organic.</li>
    <li> I received this as a gift. I am not the kind of person who generally spends medium or high dollars on beauty products&lt;br /&gt;but I do like natural products. Frankly, I&#x27;d never heard of this kind of oil. But I like it.  It has a wonderfully&lt;br /&gt;smooth texture, and the smell is not overpowering.  When I put this on my face (I am nearly 65), it feels effective and&lt;br /&gt;my skin glows right away and I definitely look smoother/younger/more refined.&lt;br /&gt;  When I put it on my hair (I swim a lot in chlorine and also have color-treated hair), it seems to restore the&lt;br /&gt;life back in my hair instantly.  The trick is not overdoing how much you put on the hair or it can quickly look greasy.&lt;br /&gt;Its just a learning curve.&lt;br /&gt;  Good product.  Terrific packaging. Love the little muslin bag and that the directions are printed on recycled&lt;br /&gt;paper, etc.&lt;br /&gt;  These people are conscious.  If you care about your body and skin...you&#x27;d not go wrong with this lovely oil.</li>
    <li> On the website, I noticed this bottle now comes with a pump action top but mine came with a dropper, so you have already an improvement. I love droppers because you can control the amount you need but exposing the contents to air and light on a daily basis in not so great, plus you have the risk of spilling. It finally happened to me where I spilled my Retinol bottle but that means one oops in one year’s time…..not too bad. The Argan oil is unrefined and you get 100% pure cold-pressed oil. Fine and light in texture and my eyes love this stuff. I get zero issues when it comes to eye make-up application the following day. Primers are great for staying and longevity power with eye shadows and the like, but can be drying and stressful to the skin on your eye’s lid and surrounding parts. So little can be applied to this sensitive area but I have found that Argan is kind enough to never irritate, leaves zero residue the following morning that may cause make-up to crease, and offers a perfect barrier of protection. It’s one of the few oils I have witnessed that actually dissipates and fully absorbs into the skin in that area. Vitamin E oil floats and I think I do more damage trying to remove it and Coconut oil loves my lashes but because of it’s temperament towards temperatures, its want to solidify can cause some areas to be almost mealy and again heavier than desired in residue. So, in short, Argan on the eye lids and pat around nicely (plus softly) and Coconut oil on the lashes! Simple ingredients with a multitude of uses and Argan oil beats any nail/cuticle oil on the market. Nothing beats a real nude look like toe nails that are healthy and beautiful for Spring and Summer shoes!  I received the above product(s) free of charge from Pur D’ or.  I am not obligated to provide a positive or favorable review, just my honest opinion.  My review is based on my experience with the product and/or brand, which may differ from yours.</li>
    <li> Had heard so much about this product and decided to try it out...I use it on my hair and it really moisturizes them without weighing them down. Results are immediate...I have now started using it on my 5 year daughter&#x27;s hair. Would recommend it with my eyes closed.</li>
    <li> Normally when I buy Argan Oil I find it has a lot of extra chemicals. What I like about this Pura D&#x27;or oil is that it is absolutely pure and organic. You can really use it all over your body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I especially like using this oil as a massage oil. It is very slick and absorbs well but makes massage very pleasant. Usually with other oils I have to use a lot more and the skin remains oily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another thing I noticed about this oil was that using it actually made my face less oily. I&#x27;d recommend using this at night. When you wake up the next day your skin will look radiant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also put Argan Oil in my hair at night and wash it out the next day. I also add it to conditioners and use it in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This oil has antibacterial properties and is good for many skin conditions. You may want to use this on your nails to help them grow out strong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you use this on your feet I&#x27;d recommend you do so at night before you go to bed. Also great for hands to condition them overnight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You may want two bottles - one to keep in the bedroom for massage and nightly use on hands and feet and one to keep in the bathroom for face and body application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;~The Rebecca Review&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a free bottle for review. This is no way changes how I review. This review is my honest opinion based on my experience.</li>
    <li> Very stunning product</li>
    <li> i really do use this on my: hair, great! nails, great! skin, great! face, great! elbows, knees, and feet, great!&lt;br /&gt;well worth every penny.</li>
    <li> A word of advice to those suffering from sudden and inexplicable breakouts: check your deodorant. It may just be the culprit. If it&#x27;s an antiperspirant, it could be causing the blocked sweat to retreat into your body as toxins and mess your face. Instead, opt for an aluminum-free natural deodorant. It&#x27;s been about a week since I made the switch and my face is well on its way to a clear complexion once more.  That said, I ordered Pura d&#x27;or around three weeks ago because I was on the hunt for a product that would help clear my breakouts and the scars they left behind. It&#x27;s proven a reliable facial moisturizer and it&#x27;s helped produce a healthy glow on my face. In my case, the Pura d&#x27;or may or may not be helping clear acne scars (it did not help prevent new breakouts), but I am seeing immediate and considerable results for the reason I mentioned at the start of this review.  Pros: Excellent facial and skin moisturizer; light texture, easily absorbed into skin, leaving it supple and glowing Cons: Potential disappointment if you&#x27;re purchasing it with unrealistic expectations</li>
    <li> Many beard oils use argan oil as a carrier oil and then mix in other essential oils to create a specific fragrance. I&#x27;m not really interested in having a fragrant beard, just a healthy and soft one. I thought why not cut out what I don&#x27;t want and just order argan oil. So far, I&#x27;m very pleased. Pure d&#x27;or 100% Pure &amp; USDA Organic Argan Oil leaves my beard soft and manageable. The price is great compared to many beard oils (4-5x more product for roughly the same price) and I don&#x27;t run around smelling like a pine tree. :) Thanks Pura d&#x27;or!</li>
    <li> I purchased this item to use in conjunction with the Premium Gold Label Argan oil shampoo. I have been using the shampoo only a few days and my hair feels cleaner after I wash it, whether it thickens and strengthens and I see regrowth is yet to be seen. I apply the oil in the evening before sleeping as during the day it can make your hair look a little greasy. However, if applied at night but the morning it has been absorbed. I have not been applying it to my face and hands as other reviewers have mentioned and so this review is only relevant to the affect of the oil on my hair. Over the past few days my hair is already noticeably softer and looks healthier. I never had dry or coarse hair nor have any other product to compare this to, however by itself it is making my hair look and feel healthier. I knocked off one star because the dispenser puts out too much oil each time you press. This will not be probably for long hair but for short hair cuts, its just too much. However, I do recommend product.</li>
    <li> I love this, much cheaper than some other brands and you get a lot more product. Use it on my skin, nails, and hair. It&#x27;s really nice to have around. Arrived very quickly. Will buy again.</li>
    <li> Girlfriend loves it. There is a wide price range for this oil and this is a great value for the quantity.</li>
    <li> Product arrived safely, intact, and well packaged. Oil moisturizes my face wonderfully and has reduced break outs. My skin tone has improved and evened out. It&#x27;s odorless and clear. I&#x27;m a very satisfied customer and would buy again.</li>
    <li> I really like that this oil is not too thick or heavy and leaves the hair shiny and healthy looking.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about 2 weeks for my nails and hands, I love it! I keep the bottle I have at work. I drink lots of water which leads to using the restroom and washing your hands multiple time a day. My hands tend to dry out when I wash my hands, the water and soap just suck out the moisture out. I put the Pura d&#x27;or Argan Oil on at least 3 times a day on my nail beds and message it in to my nails and hands for a min or two. The oil is absorbed into my skin and it feels a little greasy but goes away if you keep messaging it into your skin. My hands are so much softer. I&#x27;ve also seen noticeable nail growth since I began using it. Which I bought it for and I believe it works! I can’t wait to use it on my hair. I have naturally curly hair and anything that can add some moisture is a plus! I&#x27;ve was also having some issues with my right hand and wrist and this seems to have also helped. There is also a light earthy smell when I wash my hands after the oil has sat on my skin, I think it smells wonderful. This product Rocks!</li>
    <li> Husband and wife have been using this as post shampoo hair oil and daily face moisturizer. Hair has been great, less shedding, no split ends and not greasy. For face there has been no breakouts (completely absorbed by the skin, non greasy)  since we started using this 6 months ago. We both use this daily and just brought our second bottle which I guess will start using in a month from now. So one bottle 3 squirts per person daily (6 drops total) lasted us for 7 months. Great purchase- quality, quantity and $$ wise.</li>
    <li> Wonderful product. makes your skin feel super soft and it absorbs well.</li>
    <li> I was introduced to argan oil by Josie Maran on QVC.  The brand she sells is great&lt;br /&gt;but Pura D&#x27;or is far cheaper.  You get almost 4 times the amount of oil for almost&lt;br /&gt;one half the price. In addition, Pura D&#x27;or has a spray &amp;#34;type&amp;#34; of bottle which deposits just the&lt;br /&gt;right amount you need without wasting one drop of this precious oil; which I prefer to Ms.&lt;br /&gt;Maran&#x27;s oil dropper application bottle.  I also notice that this brand of argan oil seems to&lt;br /&gt;be more healing in nature with an antiseptic feel to it.  Goodbye Josie!  Hello Pura D&#x27;or!</li>
    <li> This truly is a miracle for your hair! I use it on my very dry, very curly hair and my mother also uses it on her hair. I&#x27;ve tried everything from frizz-ease to soap free shampoo to strict washing schedules and nothing worked. My hair was always very dry and extremely frizzy. I&#x27;ve been using this for a little over a week and it feels like I don&#x27;t even have the same hair anymore, it&#x27;s fabulous! Even after the first time I used it I noticed a HUGE difference. I wash my hair and I put it on after towel drying my hair a bit. That&#x27;s it. The next day I don&#x27;t wash my hair, I just rinse it and comb it through in the shower. I alternate every other day and my hair looks gorgeous! If you want movie star hair, this is your product.</li>
    <li> This stuff works absolute wonders on acne.  It clears up everything overnight.  The smell is very light and airy and will really make your skin and hair shine also.  It&#x27;s great for dry skin in the winter and dry scalp.  I use it pretty generously and it lasts me about 2 months once a day.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this on my skin for a few weeks now and I cannot believe the difference. My skin looks and feels totally different. The smell is great and it&#x27;s so lightweight. It absorbs so quickly. I recently had a sunburn and after gently washing my skin, I used this on top and I totally prevented me from peeling. Fantastic!</li>
    <li> I tried this product for the first time in December 2013 after months and months of searching for the right all-natural moisturizer for my face. Everything else I tried either dried out my skin or gave me terrible acne. After one week of using this Argan Oil, I was hooked. It felt very good when applying - a bit greasy at first, but once dry, my face had a wonderfully healthy, supple glow. Most significantly, I haven&#x27;t had a pimple since using this product! I apply it right after washing my face, then I use a tinted moisturizer with SPF, and I am ready to go! I also used it for a short time to moisturize my body, which felt amazing, but I ran out of it much quicker! When I only use it on my face, this bottle size lasts about 4 months for me. It&#x27;s a great product for a great price!</li>
    <li> My hair seemed to lack shine so I ordered this product.  As soon as it came I put a few drops on my hands and rubbed them through my hair.  Wow! instant body and healthier looking hair.  I also put some on my arms and they feel soft and look younger.  I had heard that the best product to use in your hair is argan oil and this product appears to be 100% argan.  Very happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m  delighted with this product.  Much better quality and price than other seller. I highly recommend A+++</li>
    <li> Since I have long black hair, I have used many brands of Argan Oil to keep it shiny and healthy. This oil is by far the lightest and  most effective. I have been using this on alternate days since the past one month and it has keep my hair frizz-free with no flyways. My hair starts to get oily towards the end of the second day but that is true for most oils and oil-based hair products I have used so its not a deal breaker for me. It washes off effortlessly with no greasy residue. It is pure with no additives and extras and I have also used it as a massage oil for my baby just before her bath. Her skin stays soft and looks healthy. A little goes a long way so this bottle should last for a nice, long time.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! It&#x27;s every bit as great as the much promoted brand name Argan Oil that you pay much more for. I love to use this as a carrier oil with tea tree oil and use it on my face, this combination helps my face feel and look moisturizer and clears up the occasional blemish.</li>
    <li> I have only tried this type of oil twice, but this was better than the other brand with the teal blue label. My hair was soft and shiny. I also have scalp psoriasis and the oil seemed to really relieve the itching. My hair is very fine, so a little goes a long way! I do intend on using it on my face and nails too.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t seem to impart the same shine as the Josie Maran brand and feels heavier and greasier.</li>
    <li> I have used this for about a week now and have noticed some great difference. I apply it after i shower at night to damp hair. When I wake up my hair is nice and shiny and also feels a lot softer. I love how it is all organic so I know I&#x27;m not putting anything bad for my hair into it. I would definitely recommend it to someone else.</li>
    <li> i love love love this OIL, it makes my hair soft-skin silky and stronger. i have a very dry skin and this product change my life, i now have a soft healthy skin.  im a sucker for organic stuff its so healthy for our skin. really worth the price gonna purchase more in the future.</li>
    <li> Hydrating. Makes skin and hair soft.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a less expensive alternative to the moroccan oil.  The thickness of the oil is thinner and it&#x27;s odorless, but it does leave the hair shiny.  I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it if you don&#x27;t like a more &amp;#34;oily&amp;#34; feel and look.  It does feel nice to use on hands, as well.</li>
    <li> Helped out a lot after I chemically straighten and dyed my hair. Didn&#x27;t have to use very much so this bottle should last at least 1 year or more, Great product. I recommend just using a few drops at a time.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a quite a while and it is absolutely wonderful. It is a great product for all hair types, especially natural hair.  I recently used it on my grandson very dry, curly hair.  He had all day shine and manageability and his curls were bouncy and defined.  This is definitely the best argan oil I&#x27;ve used, which is why I order two bottles at a time even though it lasts forever.</li>
    <li> I love this product. It moisturizes my skin so well. My skin feels so soft and smooth and looks so healthy after I use it.</li>
    <li> This order was shipped right away and I am so glad to have found a product that is certified organic. I use argon oil on my face and hair as a moisturizer. It work well without leaving either my face or hair greasy. Very happy with this version of the product!! Thanks pua d&#x27; or.</li>
    <li> I am absolutely sold on this Argan Oil!  I have been using it on my hair, face and hands.  It makes my hands soft, my hair frizz free and does wonders for winter dry skin on my face.  And you don&#x27;t need very much, a couple pumps is plenty for my hair.</li>
    <li> Wonderful Product, love it</li>
    <li> wonderful product.  i apply it at night after cleansing skin, argan oil seems to absorb very quickly.  in the morning my skin is soft with out feeling oily, and no breakouts.</li>
    <li> I love it.  It does everything advertised.</li>
    <li> VERY DISAPPOINTED~!  Feels like heavy motor oil, does not absorb into skin/hair, just sits there, no aroma of Argan oil at all.  I think this is a FAKE~!  Going into the trash, just don&#x27;t know just &amp;#34;what&amp;#34; I got mailed but it&#x27;s not Argan oil.</li>
    <li> Only using for a few days in my hair and on my face and already noticing a difference. Hair an skin both smooth and soft.</li>
    <li> I love this product. I started using it for my hair and I just love how it feels and it has started making my hair soft , gives my hair a shine and helps it make it straighter. I would highly recommend the pura d&#x27;or to anyone. It&#x27;s a great product for your skin as well.</li>
    <li> I received this oil as a gift in my birthday package from a really good friend.  I didn&#x27;t have to research it as I know she only picks and uses the best when it comes to products.  I use this when I twist my natural hair and it doesn&#x27;t leave it feeling oil...I&#x27;m on empty so I&#x27;ll have to look into buying another bottle soon though my birthday is Feb so I just may get another bottle that way!!!</li>
    <li> Absolutely amazing product. Argan oil is great for your hair&#x27;s appearance and overall feel. This is pure Argan oil, unlike Agadir Argan Oil which isn&#x27;t pure and is a mix.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bought from a deal on DailySteals, not Amazon.</li>
    <li> I originally purchased this product because of the great hype I had been hearing regarding how awesome it is for your hair.  Well, I have been blessed with not only fine, but fine AND thin(ready crappy) hair.  I use a hair dryer and flat iron, plus color my hair.  all this wreaks havoc on my hair.  I have found for my that if I apply it to the ends of my wet hair first, then run my fingers through the rest of my hair, then blow dry, it works wonders, especially for the ends of my hair that really show damage.  I love it.  A little goes a long way though.  I also have found it to work fantastically on my face.  I am in my early 40&#x27;s and my skin texture is changing.  I use this at night, and my skin is improving in look and feel.</li>
    <li> I love it so far. Better than paying double and it makes a great gift as well. (right along with a Burt&#x27;s Bee&#x27;s Bag for Christmas)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not sure if it&#x27;s good just that it makes a good gift for someone wanting argon oil.  It&#x27;s oil.</li>
    <li> A couple sprays worked into damp hair makes it shiny and beautiful. It&#x27;s the 1st thing I&#x27;ve found that really helps my hair.</li>
    <li> I have hair that is thinning because of medication.  I needed something to give it life and to make it look healthy.  I also have dead roots.  This product has help brought it back to life and cure my dead ends.  It makes it look really healthy without flattening it.  I am really glad I&#x27;ve tried it.</li>
    <li> It leaves your skin feeling soft. However, it has an oily feel after application. So, I would recommend applying it at night. Wake up in the morning with a baby soft skin.&lt;br /&gt;If you do apply it during the day, the effect would last for about 6 hours or so.</li>
    <li> I and my girlfriend have been using Argan oil as a facial moisturizer for several months.  It is very light without feeling too \\&quot;heavy\\&quot;.  I have not noticed any negative effects (acne or otherwise), either.  I am also happy that Pura D&#x27;or Pure has been certified organic [...]  We will continue using the Pura argan oil as our go-to moisturizer (with sun block over top when necessary!)</li>
    <li> I thought it was a very good product for my hair.  It kept it moisturized for many hours.&lt;br /&gt;There is not too many products out there which condition my hair as well as Pura d&#x27;or Argan oil.&lt;br /&gt;I truly love it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried a few brands of argan oil and all have had the same results... this one is as good as the expensive josie maran brand from sephora and the generally less expensive elma &amp; sana one on amazon. Great to use as a hair treatment and a pretty decent skin moisturizer for face; use sparingly to prevent excessive oiliness.</li>
    <li> This has got to be one of the best argan oil products i&#x27;ve ever used! I love how it is made for both the hair &amp; face, i love having a multi-tasking product that not only makes my hair look great, shiney, bouncy, little to no fly-aways or static it also makes my skin feel amazing! My skin feels more hydrated, looks healthier and my husband even noticed! Our daughter recently was diagnosed with psoriasis and this has worked wonders for her! She loves how it doesn&#x27;t leave her greasy after applying. It is such a fantastic item that I can see my family using for many years to come! Not to mention it is natural and organic! If I could give it more stars I would! Buy this and you will not be disapointed!</li>
    <li> This is the only organic Argan oil that works for me exactly as advertised.  Happy repeat customer.</li>
    <li> I just started using Pura D&#x27;Or Argan oil for my very thick, coarse, often frizzy hair.  In the past, I have tried lots of other treatments that either don&#x27;t work or make my hair look greasy.  Although I have just started using it, not only does my hair look shiny and wavy (not frizzy), it feels very soft and not at all greasy.  There really isn&#x27;t much of a scent, which I am fine with... Other products often have such an overwhelming scent.  Also, you really don&#x27;t need to use much product; I have a really thick long hair and a nickel-size amount did the trick, so a little will go a long way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love that it is natural and organic and that I can also use it on my hands and face.  I have a feeling that this is one of those products I&#x27;ll always want to have on hand for lots of reasons!  I&#x27;m really glad that I gave this oil a try!</li>
    <li> Reasonably priced, effective oil.  I ditched my daily cream and found this to help my acne prone skin (still use an SPF for sun protection).  I also run my hands through my hair following application on my face. Many benefits and multi-purpose.</li>
    <li> I have medium length wavy/curlyish hair and I wanted an oil (instead of a gel or product with tons of chemicals) to bring out those curls and leave in my hair all day. I love olive oil / coconut oil / other hair masks but they are way too greasy for me to use as a leave in hair product (and have also stained my clothes). If I am very careful to not use too much of this, it is great to wear daily and nourishes instead of drying out my hair. I have also used this on my face and body.</li>
    <li> Pura D&#x27; or Pure &amp; Organic Argan Oil is a USDA certified organic product with feel good properties. Packaged in a dark bottle to help preserve freshness, the product also includes a small, drawstring bag for storage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Argan oil is rich in antioxidants, vitamins, amino acids and other good for you ingredients. It is a multi-purpose fluid that can be used to revitalize the skin, reverse hair damage and more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of my favorite uses is on my finger and toe nails. Just a little of this potent oil goes a long way to give moisture to nails. This results in less breakage allowing for stronger growth.&lt;br /&gt;I also found it very healing to dry, rough patches on my skin. The liquid inside smooths on easily and is soaked up by the skin with no greasy residue. A little goes a long way so the 4oz size will last a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall this is a top notch, multi-purpose beauty oil and I love that it is chemical free!</li>
    <li> Excellent oil for my skin, I have oily skin, when applying Argan oil it makes my skin not oily and but supple and radiant not oily in appearance...</li>
    <li> Made my hair healthy and soft.  Absolutely love this!!</li>
    <li> this oil is the best organic argan oil i have used so far.  the oil is light and absorbs very easily and quickly. there is a light scent that is very pleasant.&lt;br /&gt;my face is supple within a few minutes after my skin has absorbed it.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend it! my sisters and friends all use it now :)</li>
    <li> Best brand of argan oil which I&#x27;ve consistently bought for the past 3 years!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Argan oil is superfood for my skin. People have a hard time guessing my age - people think I&#x27;m still in high school but in my 30s - and part of those compliments should be acknowledged on here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pura d&#x27;or has been consistent in high quality and the initial nutty smell is quite faint to none. I love mixing a good amount into my body lotion; it&#x27;s great as a day moisturizer; and one pump oil mixed with a bit of hair gel and my locks are styled and shiny throughout the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s been a needed relief for my sister&#x27;s eczema and my mom praises how it nourishes her skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As long as the product remains the same I will buy this over and over.</li>
    <li> Has a strange sort of stale smell, not pleasant. Have used loads of other brands of 100% argan oil and this one has the worst smell I have experienced. If you are sensitive to smell go with another brand.</li>
    <li> It is a good moisturizer for my face, but not nearly as good as other reviews make it out to be. It&#x27;s not a miracle in a bottle. Been using it for about 3 weeks now, maybe more, and no difference to my 28 year old face skin. My fiancé did use it to rub my back with and that felt nice. I like the company that makes it though.&lt;br /&gt;Not bad but not really good.</li>
    <li> Fantastic and perfect for the cold dry weather. I just got into oils this winter as my ageing skin needed some extra moisture. The oil is great smelling and left my skin feeling soft but not greasy. Thank you!</li>
    <li> This was a good find. I recently discovered argan oil loved the results bu not the cost. This was the answer.</li>
    <li> good product good value for the size. i used it for my hair when i was living in a dry cold climate.</li>
    <li> A little oil goes a very long way. I&#x27;ve been using this for over a month and have hardly put a dent in this generous sized bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hair Use&lt;br /&gt;I have fine hair, so is rub a small amount into my hands and then lightly go over flyaways. It leaves my hair shiny without weighing it down. I don&#x27;t curl or use product in my hair so I don&#x27;t know if you could do that after putting oil in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Scalp Use&lt;br /&gt;I have a very itchy scalp, so I started using the oil on my scalp at night. It really helped to stop the redness and irritation. It washes out easily the next day using shampoo and leaves scalp soft and moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Skin Use&lt;br /&gt;I use this on parts of my face. Through experimentation I have found it works wonders on the spot above my nose and between my eyes where I get those schrunched face wrinkles. It says to rub in for a minute and I do and not only does it relax me, it has haloed with my skin in that area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also use it on my neck which is very dry. My chin is a problem area that breaks out and I haven&#x27;t noticed the oil helping that area so I&#x27;m not using it there anymore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An added benefit is that every time I use it - it makes my hands soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Stretchmark Use&lt;br /&gt;My skin soaks this stuff up like a sponge! They&#x27;re not gone, but they are way less red.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Smell&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t seem to have one to me. Or at least it&#x27;s so subtle I don&#x27;t notice it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Texture&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a rich oil that doesn&#x27;t spread a ton because your skin and hair will absorb it. It&#x27;s not greasy but you so get a little oil shine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m definitely a fan of Pura D&#x27;or Argan Oil.</li>
    <li> I wot this for a gift and was skeptical at the idea of putting oil on my face. After developing  dermatitis on my face  and having to give up my beloved high dollar skin care products I made the switch. I love the argan oil. I had also had a travel size of Josie Maran and this is every bit as good and much more economical. I use it on my face, my hair and my body. My skin care routine is simplified, my face is smooth and I&#x27;ve had no reactions. I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Great product! I love how well Pura d&#x27;Or Agran Oil works. I initially bought it because my dermatologist told me that this product would work well for my dry skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At his behest I tried it and it did work better than the other lotions I was using. It was also smaller and cheaper as well. But here was the most amazing thing, my age lines receded as I used the product. I was really excited about that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product makes me look younger and feel wonderful! 5 stars!</li>
    <li> Use after every shampoo just before drying my hair.  Its dry in the house after a long MN winter and this helps calm frizzes.</li>
    <li> This product felt great on my skin but I did not like it on my hair.  It left it feeling greasy.</li>
    <li> I have good things to say about this and bad. The good is, that you get a lot for a reasonable price and it&#x27;s fresh and will last a long time. I don&#x27;t know how it would fare on a hot summer truck though. The bad is, I have normal skin (not too oily and not too dry and it&#x27;s just not very moisturizing. It absorbs right away and doesn&#x27;t stay greasy but after it&#x27;s absorbed my skin still feels tight and dry. For instance I just used it as hand lotion but my hands are crying out for lotion. They still feel dry. I used to use pure Shea butter on my face at night but tried this instead and my face was dry the next morning unlike soft and moisturized like Shea butter. I will mix this with my moisturizers and won&#x27;t buy again. If your skin is oily, it might be perfect. It is said its good for acne prone skin and a hair treatment but it will weigh hair down if not shampooed after. Putting some on the ends is o.k.</li>
    <li> So, while my GF was visiting me from France she had some Argan oil. Was using it every day. Her skin is spectacular. She says she uses Argan oil 1 to 2 times per day and massages her face to help with wrinkles. So, I bought this product and while I cannot tell a difference (only one week so far) I am pleased with the quality and value of this oil. Only time will tell about its overall effects on my skin. though I believe it connot hurt to use oil that has been used by the rich &amp; famous for decades or even hundreds of years to preserve skin &amp; hair etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will contiune to use the entire bottle then come back with an update! BTW, came package wonderfully with its own bag &amp; drawstring.</li>
    <li> I tried and tried to like this product due to all the great reviews but it just didn&#x27;t live up to them.  Mostly I used this on my hair and it is anything but light and weighted down my hair with just a little amount.</li>
    <li> That was great. I received the products 3 days after order. The quality also is great. thank you.</li>
    <li> This is my second purchase of this Argan Oil. I really love it. It is the only thing I have found so far that can calm the itching burning patch of psoriasis on my elbow. I have tried all different kinds of ointments and recommended products and none of them worked for long. After reading about Argan Oil, and not knowing which brand to buy, I decided to try this. I could not be happier with the product. It also helped salvage my brittle nails. I rub a small amount on the psoriasis patch after my morning shower and it gives relief all day long. I would recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> This will be my third purchase of this oil. I decided, by now, to just go for the 16oz pump! It has been great for my skin and nail beds. The best part for me is how effective it is to take off my makeup with grinding my skin. I&#x27;ve had no problem with breakouts. I&#x27;m not worried about added chemicals, etc. It devolves stubborn mascara and my eyelashes don&#x27;t get pulled on or come out unexpectedly. Start with a small bottle if needs be, but I&#x27;m guessing you&#x27;ll be back for more! :)&lt;br /&gt;(Although a little goes a long way.)</li>
    <li> i love how this oil won&#x27;t clog my pores and makes my skin feel smooth and soft without feeling greasy.</li>
    <li> This is the 2nd bottle I bought, so I can leave one at work, and one at home.  After trying out conditioner with argon oil, I find my hair (long, somewhat frizzy) much shinier and healthy, more bouncy and lively, and easier to comb thru.  I usually do 4-5 pumps and rob thru my hair, the comb thru briefly.  I workout a lot outdoors, running, cycling, swimming in ocean, and this product helps keeping my hair retaining moisture without feeling heavy/sticky.  Definitely recommend to everyone.</li>
    <li> I love this argan oil! I have very long, thick, and curly hair and I always use this product in my after-shower routine. I love the fact that it is 100% organic, and for the price, you can&#x27;t beat it! I also really enjoy the pump-bottle design as opposed to the eye dropper that many other hair serums come in. This product lasts me roughly 2-3 months. I will buy again!</li>
    <li> It comes in an easy-to-use bottle, the quality of the oil seems good and it feels great on my skin!</li>
    <li> This is the first 100% Argan oil product I have used and I&#x27;ve been pretty impressed with the results. I have used it for about a month on my hands, nails and face. For me, this product works much better than moisturizers.  I have combination skin on my face and very dry hands. I initially bought this product because most moisturizers either irritate my skin or don&#x27;t alleviate dry patches on my skin. I had dry patches on my cheeks and on the corners of my lips, even during the summer time. I&#x27;ve only needed to use this product on my trouble spots twice a day (morning and night), whereas with moisturizers I had to keep applying throughout the day. On my hands, the product alleviated the ashy area between my index and middle finger, which is always dry due to constant hand washing. After two weeks I&#x27;ve noticed that my nails have also felt stronger and have been less prone to breakage. I&#x27;m very happy with the product and will be adding it to my permanent beauty routine. The formula is thin, and does have an herbal smell which doesn&#x27;t really linger-so I&#x27;m happy about that. It also absorbs fairly quickly and a little goes a long way. Be aware that the bottle is glass which can become slippery if you are using the product on your hands.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. My skin has never looked so good. I use a few drops of oil on my face at night and my skin is glowing in the morning. I have very sensitive skin and this is completely non-irritating. I use it all year round.</li>
    <li> I use it got my hair and skin, even my face. Hydrates really well. Switching over to coconut oil for now tho because this product is expensive.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a great product. Works great on my skin and hair. Arrived quickly. Will be ordering again.</li>
    <li> Absolutely amazing product!</li>
    <li> I had a couple of dry patches on my face and used Argan oil ... it truly feels regenerative. I use it on my chest and arms daily. I had a bit of a sunburn and used it. After using the Argan oil, the burn turned overnight and I never peeled. It&#x27;s slightly oily at forst, but soaks in fairly quickly. I plan to continue using Argan oil forever. Friends say my skin looks healthier.</li>
    <li> This was ordered for my husband. He is the one using it and says it is great. We will reorder again later.</li>
    <li> I use this on my face. So far, I love it. It doesn&#x27;t break me out either, &amp; I&#x27;m very acne prone.</li>
    <li> Love this product I have just received my second bottle. I have dry skin and my boyfriend has oily skin and we both use this as a facial moisturizer every day. When I ran out and had to go without using for a few weeks i noticed a dramatic difference (bad) in my skin. Seriously, it&#x27;s amazing! Don&#x27;t waste your money on Josie Maran when you can buy 10% organic Argan oil for 1/3 the price.</li>
    <li> For the first time in years my fingernails are growing stronger &amp; healthier after using the argan oil from Pura dʻor! for over a week now!..And my skin looks smooth, radiant &amp; glowing. Also Iʻm using it for my dry hair everyday and I noticed a big difference. My hair is looking good and shiny!. Thank you so much for your great product!...I love it!!!..and I will definitely buy it again because it really works!</li>
    <li> Received my pure d&#x27;or argan oil today and tried it on myself and my daughter.  Love how soft our hair feels!!  Only used a dime size for our hair and dried with a hairdryer.  The outcome was pure softness and the best part??  No greasy feeling and our hands felt soft afterwards.  Will have to try it out for over a week to see if we love it but as of now, we really like it and hope it is a keeper!!</li>
    <li> Thank you for this great product. My nails have been splitting for several years now. I thought it was all the yard work I was doing. I read a few reviews on Amazon and decided to give Pura d or Aragon oil a chance. I could not be happier. This Has helped my nails in a big way. Now I actually have to clip them. They are strong and finally look good. The last time I applied  the oil, I buffed my nails first and that helped the oil to be absorbed. Great product.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful product....leaves my skin so silky soft. Have a fresh glow all day when I use this product, where other products disappear within an hour.  This stays on without feeling greasy or oily.&lt;br /&gt;Would purchase this again....</li>
    <li> To my nose, the oil smells a bit like the way an olive tastes — earthy, almost like manure. I love olives, so it doesn&#x27;t bother me, but my bf is less enthused about it. However, the scent seems to dissipate quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since getting the bottle, I&#x27;ve been using it for various skin-related issues:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Facial moisturizer: I really like the way the skin on my face feels after moisturizing with a little bit of this oil. At first, I would pump 1-2 drops into my palms then rub it into my face. That actually made me break out ): After some trial and error, the method that works for me is to pump a couple drops in my palms, rub it over my hands like hand lotion, then use the tiny residual amount leftover on my palms to gently pat my face. Deposits just enough oil to moisturize my face without saturating it in too much oil and making me break out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. Hair moisturizer: 2-3 drops on my palms, rub around like hand lotion, then run my hands through my hair. It controls flyaways and makes my hair feel silky. I like combing some through my hair before I sleep. I&#x27;ve noticed my hair is healthier and more hydrated since using this regularly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. Beard balm: I like to think it makes my bf&#x27;s beard less scratchy, but the effect isn&#x27;t major. He does like how it feels on his beard though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4. My FAVORITE use for this oil, and the #1 reason why I&#x27;d buy this again — body moisturizer. At night, my skin gets really itchy for no discernible reason. My legs, arms, and back get these itchy hives-like spots. Rubbing this oil onto the itchy spots stops all irritation within seconds, and I no longer have to scratch myself. It&#x27;s amazing. I don&#x27;t know how or why, all I know is that it works to calm down my night hives. I&#x27;ve also noticed that my scattering of chest acne — recurring breakouts and scarring on my chest kept me from wearing low-neck shirts for the past two months — calmed down and faded away within a week of regular oil application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So in summary, this oil performed much better than I expected, and because 1-2 drops go such a long way, I think it&#x27;s well worth the price tag./&gt;So in summary, this oil performed much better than I expected, and because 1-2 drops go such a long way, I think it&#x27;s well worth the price tag.</li>
    <li> This was an excellent product and the second time I&#x27;ve purchase! I specifically used it on my hair and face, and my hair grew rapidly! I used it over a span of 6 months and my hair grew 5-6 inches! I highly recommend this to women with hair loss or has a difficult time growing out their hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, this is great for your face at night. It&#x27;s great as a leave-in moisturizer, it helps to protect the skin moisture barrier. But I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this for oily skin type throughout the day. Overall, this is a great product and I&#x27;ve been recommending it to family and friends and they all love it!</li>
    <li> Good stuff...this is my third bottle.  I use a little on wet hair to help moisturizer dry ends and also on skin.</li>
    <li> I love Argan Oil, goes on moothly. I use it for both skin and hair.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried several brands of Argan oil and this is the best. It feels and smells like the real deal. It absolutely improved my skin and hair. I recommend getting it direct from Amazon, though.</li>
    <li> I love this oil.  So far I&#x27;ve only used it on my face but will try it on my hair and the rest of my body.  I apply it as a moisturizer after cleaning my face and before putting on foundation.  Have to really massage it in, otherwise it stays oily.  I&#x27;m a 70 yo woman and get lots of compliments on my skin and feedback that I look much younger than my age - I believe at least part of that is because I use this oil.  I accidentally dropped and broke my last bottle - ugh!  My skin noticed a difference within a couple of days so I quickly ordered another bottle.</li>
    <li> My second purchase of this oil.  It is a light weight highly absorbent pleasant feeling oil that softens and replenishes dry and/or irritated skin.  A small amount is able to fully refresh my face, including the skin of the eyelids.  I am not sure if it promotes younger looking skin, but as far as healthy supple looking and feeling skin this product achieves the goal.  It remains on my short list to always have a backup container on hand so I will not be without it.</li>
    <li> I really like this brand of argan oil. It is pure argan oil. It smoothed my wrinkles and hair dramatically.</li>
    <li> Love to use this on my face, hands and feet.  Absorbs quickly and leaves my skin visibly hydrated.  Love this!</li>
    <li> I purchased this from another site for a really good price. I used it with my moisturizer and it seems to really help moisturizing my skin. I do like and I would buy it again if I see it on sale for a good price.</li>
    <li> Lightweight oil that doesn&#x27;t leave hair or skin greasy. Perfect for dry ends. Will order again.</li>
    <li> Good product. It works great on my husband&#x27;s dry skin as well as on my hair. It was lost on the mail, and they sent me a replacement.</li>
    <li> It is a little heavier than the Josie Maran brand and takes a little longer to soak into the skin, but it is half the price, so I will be getting this again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PS to the shipper:  Please be sure the lids are on tight, I lost some of the product in shipping.</li>
    <li> I have really long hair, and in order to keep it nice and shiny, I was looking for a product to maintain and keep it looking sleek. I found that using a bit of Argon oil did wonders for me. I used to use the One N&#x27; Only Argan Oil Treatment, and I loved it. Then I ran out, I noticed how many great reviews there were on this Pura D&#x27;or brand. I was a little hesitant because of the price, but I decided that all the reviews were great and if there was something better than One N&#x27; Only, I wanted to try it. In all honesty, for the price, I would stick with One N&#x27; Only. I think One N&#x27; Only gave me a less stickier feel (but I have slightly oily hair to begin with, so if you dryer hair, this may be better for you). One N&#x27; Only is also a lot cheaper. This is still a really great product though, I&#x27;d use it again if I wasn&#x27;t careful with money.</li>
    <li> I love this!  It makes my skin feel smooth and wrinkles in my cheek area disappeared after about one week.</li>
    <li> Tried it for my dry hair.  Only provided temporary moisture.  Smells good and it is very nice on the skin.</li>
    <li> Every winter time when I go to my cousin&#x27;s place (which is a very dry place)  my hands gets so dry and i have cracks on my fingers. I also love to wash dishes so that adds to that condition. My cousin gave me with this oil and since i started using it my hands didn&#x27;t get dry, i don&#x27;t have cracks on my fingers and even if i washed my hands the moist stays.</li>
    <li> Nice product although not for me personally. I see the potential of this if you have dry hair though. I&#x27;ve been using on my body since its too oily for my hair and I love it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this oil for around a month. I&#x27;ve used it on my hands (cuticles especially and face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With facial use, I used it in conjunction with a mircodermabrasion regimen and have enjoyed the results. As compared to the last use of the microdermabrasion, this time around my skin looked more smooth and less dry in the aftermath. I&#x27;ve been dabbing a bit around my eyes at night and in the morning (pre spf lotion) and really have to say the evenness of tone is marked. I have relatively decent skin for 37, fair and freckled. Given my complexion, any changes are almost immediately noticeable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With regard to my cuticles, this has been helping combat winter dryness which leads regularly picked-at hang nails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m very pleased with this product and would definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> I was given this product as a gift from a woman who has very course, very thick hair. For her, it turned her hair into baby softness and left no oily residue.  I have finer hair, and was sad to see it did leave a greasy looking look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I have also used this product as a moisturizer on my face, and am DELIGHTED to find that it has helped to even out my skin tone, ease the appearance of freckles, and even lessened laugh lines to the point where people have asked me what my secret is. I would definitely buy this product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve bought two bottles of it now. I like using this as an aftershave facial moisturizer.</li>
    <li> I just started using 100% pure Argan oil from physicians formula. I wanted to look for a bottle that was a spray bottle and certified organic. This arrived today much to my dismay. There was no protective plastic cap cover, and the bottle was approximately three quarters full. It did not look or smell like pure Argan oil either. I attempted to call the local number printed on their printed information included with the bottle. The number I dialed was a correct number, but did not belong to this company any longer. The person who answered suggested I go to their website, and said they supposedly change their number by now. I attempted to navigate their website several times, to much dissatisfaction. It kept locking up my computer. I would never buy product from this company again, but that is just my opinion, based upon my experience. If I could give this Company negative stars, I would. Amazon, however, was most helpful in setting up the return.</li>
    <li> Great stuff! I started using argan oil about six months ago on my face as a replacement for an Oil of Olay anti-aging line. It&#x27;s been wonderful. I live in Florida and started seeing sunspots on my face. With continual use of the organic argan oil my sunspots have vanished. At first I was using Insta Natural Argan Oil before I started using Pura d&#x27;or, which is a little thinner when applied. I use the Pura d&#x27;or not only on my face an neck now but, on my hands, wrists, feet, legs, elbows; basically, anywhere I would use a lotion. I&#x27;ve also tried it in my hair but, I always seem to over due it... not a fan of it in my hair but, I know it works for others who have a bit more control. I would recommend this product if you&#x27;re looking for a good argan oil.</li>
    <li> Works great for hand and nail treatment, but be aware you need just a drop, it&#x27;s an oil</li>
    <li> Wonderful oil, easily absorbed, feels great on the skin! I live in a desert climate and using this oil helps a lot!</li>
    <li> I use it on my hair, face, legs,and underarms. I&#x27;ve noticed my skin and hair is much softer, and I only need to use a little bit. Plus it&#x27;s a great price.</li>
    <li> I started using argan oil about a year ago. After trying several brands, I continue to use pura d&#x27;or 100% pure organic argan oil because it is authentic. I am also glad that it contains no additives. .I use it on my dry face and hair, and like that it soaks in without being greasy. I even add it to my body lotion, and it actually improves the quality. I have also used pura d&#x27;or on minor scratches and burns to help with healing.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s good a product.When I use it at night before sleeping ,so easy to apply on the face.And it becomes so smoother at the next morning.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing. I&#x27;ve been using it for over a year now. Helps to cure dry winter skin and keeps my acne at bay. I&#x27;d be lost without it.</li>
    <li> Some of the best I have used and great value</li>
    <li> Lovely oil.  I use this on my hair, skin, lips.  It my go on a little grease, but my skin and lips are very soft, hair is shinny.  I have replace my lotion with this product.</li>
    <li> Organic argan oil is fantastic. I use it on my hair, face and as a moisturizer on a daily basis.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this oil for almost a month now. I had originally ordered it to help with dryness, broken capillaries, redness, and darkness from scars. This stuff moisterizes pretty well!  I have seen a bit of a reduction in the appearance of the broken capillaries and some redness. I&#x27;ve been using it either alone or with lotion 1 to 2 times per day.  I really like that the oil is very light.  I&#x27;ve used it on my hair a little bit, too. It definitely helps with frizz--you just have to be careful since it is an oil.</li>
    <li> This stuff feels amazing on my face. It&#x27;s not greasy and is the best moisturizer I&#x27;ve ever used!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s anything special, you can use cheaper oils for your skin and hair.</li>
    <li> Can someone tell me.&lt;br /&gt;I have dry hair. The more I put in when flat iron, the more it feels like straw.&lt;br /&gt;Am I doing something wrong?</li>
    <li> So far I have really liked the oil.  I apply it once in the morning and once in the evening and my face has been moisturized and never oily!  It feels good to be using a natural, one ingredient product on my face. I am really hoping it takes care of my acne scars.</li>
    <li> I had severe dry and sensitive skin and could never find a good moisturizer to sooth and heal my skin.  As time went on, my skin condition worsened.  So I started to do some research on different oils that I could use to help it heal and decided to try Argan oil.  Surprisingly,after using it for about 1 week, my skin started to feel smooth and my rash/bumps started to disappear.  I apply it twice/day and cannot live without it!!  I strongly recommend it to everyone!</li>
    <li> This is my daughter and my&#x27;s favorite argan oil. It is great for the face, and hair. My daughter uses it as her beauty oil every night, and it is extremely moisturizing. We will continue to repurchase!</li>
    <li> The product came in a nice little bag, and so far I have loved this oil. I didn&#x27;t use any hair product besides this oil and my hair looked amazing. I rubbed any excess that I had on my hands into my nail beds and those felt great too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Besides an amazing product, I love concept of the company.  Their product directions are printed on recycled paper and the bag the product came in was made of biodegradable fibers.  Great product, great company.</li>
    <li> Love this Oil. I was skeptical to use it on my face in fear of acne but i woke up with plump hydrated skin.</li>
    <li> I am 58 yr. old and have not been so smart about sun tanning over the years and my face was showing it! I ordered my second bottle of this product as I have noticed a wonderful difference in how my skin looks and feels. Even the wrinkles that were appearing on my neck have gotten better. When I first tired it I was a little worried about the &#x27;greasy&#x27; look but I just let it sit for about 5 minutes before I put on makeup and there is no greasy look at all. Very impressed with this product!</li>
    <li> I really like this oil so far. My daughters curly hair just drank it up! I have thick straight hair and I think I may have applied too much the first time because it left my hair very oily. I don&#x27;t mind as I&#x27;m sure its nourishing and I will use less next time.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this on my hair and skin for about a week and there is a noticeable difference. My hair seems healthier and my skin feels better. It smells great too! I definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> I have been using Pura d&#x27;or Argan Oil on my face for 2 weeks...and all of a sudden my 11&#x27; lines are gone. How could this have happened? I am 60 years old and I have never used anything on my skin and hair that has brought me back to my youth like this. I have a Youtube Channel and I talked about this product in my video.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;PcTrggdsJvA . It is amazing. I use it day and night. It&#x27;s not greasy...it is a miracle. ~ Susan</li>
    <li> As soon as I received this oil, I used it on my hair and arms. I have very dry skin and hair, I instantly felt a difference. I&#x27;ve tried other brands, but they were not pure and you could sure tell the difference. Great stuff!</li>
    <li> I use it everyday sometimes twice. It&#x27;s light so it penetrates and doesn&#x27;t block pores.</li>
    <li> Shipped fast and product was better than expected. My skin feels incredible and the wonders it has done for my &amp;#34;normally&amp;#34; dry hair is amazing!!!! The benefits from this product are endless!!!!</li>
    <li> Let me begin by saying that I almost never leave reviews. However I have already recommended Pura D&#x27;or Argan Oil to a few of my friends. It shipped very fast and it was possible the best packaged product I have ever received from Amazon! I opened it right away. The smell of the argan oil is amazing. I use it for my hair, my face and my hands. I absolutely love it!</li>
    <li> When I first ordered this product I was very skeptical.  I have to tell you, however, that it has lived up to all of my expectations.  When I went to see my daughter in VA Beach, she noticed how good my skin looked and ordered a bottle for herself.  Wow!</li>
    <li> Fast delivery,&lt;br /&gt;Pure oil without bad smell,</li>
    <li> I have tried 4 different Argan Oils and this one by far (so far) is my favorite!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like how smooth the oil is and not thick. My skin feels and looks amazing. I use this as a night oil on my face and an all over oil after my shower. I am hydrated all day, in which I have very dry/sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will continue to purchase this item for as long as I can, I love it!!</li>
    <li> First time ever trying Argan oil, but I love it. I wasn&#x27;t willing to fork out the money for the more popular brands so I decided to try this. I put it on about an hour before bed and when I wake up in the morning my skin feels great. It take about 30 mins or more for it to soak into your face. I haven&#x27;t tried it on my hair yet, but this winter I  probably will be. I&#x27;ve been using it about a week and believe it or not my skin is less oily than it was before because my body isn&#x27;t producing so much of its own oil. This is also a pretty large bottle and its cold pressed (which I discovered was what you want argan oil to be). I recommend!</li>
    <li> Excellent product, great strong nails and shiny hair</li>
    <li> ITS VERY NICE PRODCUT</li>
    <li> This product is Magic on my skin, hair, and nails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great all around product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve seen quick improvement in the moisture retention on my face after a week of daily use of this oil, especially with the dark circles under my eyes. I also use it in my hair daily for moisture but haven&#x27;t seen any major changes yet, will continue to use on my hair until the bottle is empty</li>
    <li> Love it made my skin feel so soft after one use</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m obsessed! It cleared my acne up! And it makes my skin look so healthy. I&#x27;m now a loyal customer. :)</li>
    <li> Use just a few drops on my hair everyday. I have very dry hair and no traditional haircare product has made any difference. Argan oil works for me!</li>
    <li> This is the third bottle I have purchased. It is the best one out  there and it lasts a long time (a little goes a long way.)</li>
    <li> I am usually skeptical about buying these products, but I am so pleased with this one. After using this for a week, the lines have smoothed out in my face and my face feels like porcelain. I will definitely be using this every day from now on.</li>
    <li> I have very dry,frizzy curly hairs,always wondered how people have such soft shiny frizz free hairs,tried a lot of products nothing worked finally though of trying argan oil,search amazon went through tedious process of reading reviews and I am glad I choose Pura dor -it&#x27;s light ,non greasy, absorbs super fast ,I am using it every day after brushing my hairs just a few drops of oil and you are ready to rock with soft,silky, shiny, manageable hairs.</li>
    <li> Completely happy with this oil.  My skin is dry and sensitive and using this Argan oil day and night has given my face the moisture it needs without irritation.</li>
    <li> don&#x27;t really see a difference in brands</li>
    <li> This oil is gentle on my sensitive skin and smoothed out fine lines around my eyes. love it!</li>
    <li> LOVE this product! I use it mostly for my hair. Everytime i style my hair i always make sure to put some on the ends, about one pump (a little goes a lonnnnng way) or i use it for seocd day hair to add moisture to my ends. Took off one star mainly because it has a slight scent, but other than that, it&#x27;s perfect :)</li>
    <li> The product gave me lasting moisture regardless of weather, as well as avoided any greasy feel. Also great for hair.  Would recommend!</li>
    <li> Works just as well as the Josie Maran Argan Oil, but the packaging is much nicer on this particular brand, as it has a pump. It has a slightly different smell than the Josie Maran, but works just the same!</li>
    <li> This is my second bottle of Pura Dor Argan Oil. I use it on my face everyday and almost everyday on my hair. It&#x27;s not greasy like other oils on my face and it leaves my hair nice and soft and shiny. I recommend this to everyone to give it a try.</li>
    <li> Excellent moisturizer. I use it on my face and hair once a day. This product has made my hair look healthier and shinier along with improving my skin complexion. I would definitely recommend this item to everybody. Overall, this is a great Argan oil.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for about 2 weeks. Though my hair  is  not visibly silky like pictures for most argan oil products it has decreased my ends catching on other strands and breaking. I look forward to seeing more of a improvement as I continue to use the product.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff.  Been using it for about 3 of my last 63 years.  At night I use 2-3 pumps and press into my neck, face and chest after moisturizer.  The extra hydration seems to make my skin look softer and smoother.  I use it all year long but especially helpful during those horrific winters in Minnesota. :)</li>
    <li> This is a great product to add to anyone&#x27;s daily regimen. I use this product on my hair and face.  It gives my hair the right amount of moisture without making it too oily, and help some dark spot fade on my face. I will definitely be purchasing this argan oil again. Received the product in a timely manner.</li>
    <li> I use this argon oil as my face moisturizer after I shower. I am an adult who has battled adult acne, wanting to moisturize in an effort to not get wrinkled, but also can&#x27;t use anything that clogs my pores...THIS IS PERFECT! My skin looks so much better, doesn&#x27;t feel heavily oiled, no acne...and I even go without makeup a lot &amp;amp; my skin tone looks great &amp;amp; even. I am on my second bottle of this stuff. LOVE IT!</li>
    <li> This product is amazing! I love it.</li>
    <li> Love this product! I use it on my face every day and it leaves it feeling so soft and smooth - not greasy at all and completely absorbs. Highly recommend to anyone looking for an all natural way to moisturizer any and everything.</li>
    <li> I love it! It is not greasy. I put a few drops on my face cleansing liquid and it makes my face feel less dry. I also put drops in my hand lotion and it makes it smoother.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve long been a fan of argan oil but couldn&#x27;t bear to pay the price that it costs to buy it at a larger make-up store. When I came upon this brand, I thought it was a fantastic value. That belief was confirmed when I received it in the mail and began using it. The quality of the product is exceptional for the value. identical in composition to the more expensive make-up counter brand. In addition, I love the packaging; it comes with a pump rather than an eye dropper and have to say I love it. Due to my love of this product, I am officially loyal to this brand. Argan oil is a beautiful, holistic moisturizer for hair and skin- do yourself a favor and give this a try and you will be a life-time convert as well, I&#x27;m sure of it :).</li>
    <li> I ordered this product because I read it works really well on hair to tame frizz and help split ends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like how much product you get for the price and it lasts a really long time. I only use about 2 pumps for the ends and midsection of my hair. I ordered this product in December and I&#x27;m only about half way done with the bottle.&lt;br /&gt;It definitely helps with frizziness if you use it on dry hair when styling or right after you wash your hair but I took off a star because I haven&#x27;t seen any significant difference in my hair at all. I still use this oil every time I was my hair though because it does help with frizzines which is super important for someone with frizzy, curly hair, like myself.</li>
    <li> I love, love, love this product! My husband and I have been using Pura d&#x27;or Organic Argan Oil for about 7 months now and cannot say enough good things about it. Because &amp;#34;a little goes a long way&amp;#34;, our original bottle lasted quite a long time. We&#x27;ve just received bottle #2 in the mail a few days ago.&lt;br /&gt;I use it as a facial moisturizer and I love how it absorbs quickly, does not leave my skin shiny, and does not cause my face to break out like many other moisturizing products I&#x27;ve used in the past. I also like to use it on my very curly hair to tame any &#x27;fly-aways&amp;#34; that never fail to spring up in the middle of a busy day.&lt;br /&gt;My husband uses this product to condition his beard and as a skin moisturizer for his head, which he shaves daily. He has also commented to me that he likes the way the Argan Oil does not leave his head shiny.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you so much for such a great product! Keep up the good work!</li>
    <li> Nice but use sparingly or you get the greasy look.</li>
    <li> Great oil, not too oily.  I included this Argan Oil in some homemade lotion bars which came out great.  I&#x27;ve been using the rest of the oil in place of face moisturizer and it leaves my skin nice and soft and I&#x27;m able to put make up on top without it being greasy.  Very happy with my purchase and with the seller!</li>
    <li> I rarely write reviews, but I really like this oil. It has so many uses. My hands, face, elbows, hair, etc. Leave in overnight for hair and it is so soft. Improved overall health greatly along with the the Pura d&#x27;or shampoo. Has helped dark under eye circles and I actually have nails that are growing now. Will be ordering again.</li>
    <li> LUV this organic argan oil from head to toe: after using one squirt it on my face, I take a bit more and add fragrance for body moisture,  Finally, whatever is left on my palm goes on my hair to end flyaways and moisturize ends.  It is the ONLY moisturizer my husband will use!</li>
    <li> This oil works GREAT on my hair!  I recently bought &amp;#34;Pura d&#x27;or  Hair loss prevention organic shampoo&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;Pura d&#x27;or  organic Conditioner&amp;#34;  and after shower, I use this oil and massage my head and feels so good and my face skin gets better next moernig even though I don&#x27;t use this on my face. Amazing!</li>
    <li> Absolutely lovely. It feels like silk on your skin. The oily skin that was the curse of my teens has turned into a blessing in my sixties. The wrinkles that plague my peers have not appeared as yet, so I intend to protect my skin. I make my own face wash with glycerin, aloe, and liquid castile soap, adding a few drops of essential oils. Then I message in the Pura d&#x27;or.This twice a day routine is proving to be priceless. Don&#x27;t forget your hands! Some minor scarring is starting to fade and my hands feel softer. I have detected no odor in this product at all, and a small amount spreads evenly over my whole face. I would say using less is more effective, as it blends in quickly and leaves behind soft skin. I&#x27;m sold! Will definitely order more.</li>
    <li> I use to be an Argan oil nut and then I just lapsed in reordering my usual stuff and fell off the band wagon. I noticed my hair was frizzing more and my skin was not as soft and subtle when I had maintained a regular routine with Argan oil. So I did some research and found Pura d&#x27;or and am in love. I love that it is organic. My hair is back to its tame ways and my skin is soooo soft without that moisturizing stickiness or oily residue you get with some lotions and oils. I will definitely be a repeat buyer and won&#x27;t allow another lapse in my Argan oil routine.</li>
    <li> Bottle arrived in good condition and I tried it out and it feels and smells good on the skin. Absorbs fairly quickly. This is my first time using Argan oil and so far I like it!</li>
    <li> I have been using Argan oil for a while now and recently ordered this brand after reading the posotive reviews.  I really like that it hydrates my skin. I suffer from eczema and like the feel of the oil. I also like the way it makes my hair feel without being to heavy. I&#x27;m glad I discovered it.</li>
    <li> It really works!! Great product...those who have skin problem and hair loss should try this..it leaves your hair and skin smooth after consecutive uses.</li>
    <li> OK.  Full disclosure time - I am doing this mainly for the free bottle I get for posting this review.  Would I have posted a review without it?  Not likely.  Why because it doesn&#x27;t work?  Nope.  Because the inter-web doesn&#x27;t need to know my secret to regrowing my hair!  Yup, there it is, I said it.  Before this product, thinning hair, after about 6 months of using... new hair growth!  What the heck!?  I was only using this on my face, because I don&#x27;t want to look as old as I am.  As it turns out, my sloppy, let me just wipe my hands on my head after applying to my face tactic was not only lazy, but the secret key to my follicle fountain of youth!  Who knew!?  Do I have data to confirm it?  Nope.  Can I prove it.  Yup.  How?  Conversation with my mom... translated from spanish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mom:  Hi son.&lt;br /&gt;Me:  Hi mom.&lt;br /&gt;Mom:  Wow.  You&#x27;re not balding anymore!?  What happened?&lt;br /&gt;Me:  Amazing huh, mom!?&lt;br /&gt;Mom:  Yes, but now what about your belly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll let you know if this oil does anything for my &#x27;belly!&#x27;</li>
    <li> Great product! I&#x27;ve tried many other brands of 100% organic Argan Oil and nothing compares to Pura dor. It is light weight and easy bendable and the price is perfect.  I will definitely be suggesting this product to my family and friends.</li>
    <li> Have nothing more to say, it is a really good argan oil. I like it is organic and the packaging is nice. I have used some argan oil product and I really like it. I think this product has a decent value regarding its price. I mainly got it for my hair, but I will also try to use it as my moisturizer. I like it.</li>
    <li> This product wprks wonders on my skin. I have recently gone under trearment for skin cancer which left my skin scaly and bumpy, basically intolerable. After a month of using this regularly, my skin texture has improved 100%. I highly recommend this product for anyone who has any type of skin condition or who just wants more radiant, beautiful skim.</li>
    <li> Great product for the skin.  I use it daily with my moisturizer and am completely satisfied with the results.</li>
    <li> its working really wonderful for me</li>
    <li> I love this oil.  I used it on my face and neck and I can see visible results.  My neck was ruddy from being out in the sun and this oil seemed to smooth out my skin and my neck looks so much better.  I love the way the oil makes my face feel.  You would think it would feel oily but it doesn&#x27;t. I also have very dry cuticles and it has worked wonders for them. I use it every night before bed.</li>
    <li> I bought this product due to the amazing reviews and great price. While I am still figuring out the right amount for my hair, this product is definitely effective. Just a single pump is enough to tame my curly hair and make it glossy. I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Leaves hair very soft.</li>
    <li> I started using this organic argan oil as a moisturizer for my face and with in a week i could see what a difference it makes , my skin is soft and did not break out. I am very happy i brought this argan oil.</li>
    <li> I Love this Oil.&lt;br /&gt;I use it everyday on my entire body including my hair.&lt;br /&gt;I used to see a lot of my hair falling out when I brush it, but after using this Oil for 3 days, I was amazed at how little of my hair&lt;br /&gt;was falling out. My hair used to be dry, not any more. My hair is now smooth and soft.&lt;br /&gt;I will continue to use this product all the time.&lt;br /&gt;I strongly recommend this products.</li>
    <li> this is fake. do yourself a favor and order this from the website. you get what you pay for</li>
    <li> Great product.  My skin cleared up almost immediately.  I will definetely buy it again!!!</li>
    <li> Great product!!!  Very pleased with this product.  It compares to another widely advertised and costly 100% pure Argon oil!!  which I was going to re-order, but found this one on Amazon.  I am happy!!!  It is light, clear, fluid and pure.  Packaging is somewhat shabby, but the product is great. We throw the package away anyhow, so it matters not.  I use this oil daily after showering, on my face, body and it is not greasy, easily absorbed and no overpowering fragrance.  I will be re-ordering.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s smooth, not too oily, and smells pleasant. The bottle is nicely packaged too. Convenient to use and store. Very high quality stuff!</li>
    <li> This the best moisturizer I have ever used.....  I have many allergies to many products on the market even the products from my dermatologist. I am in my 50&#x27;s and going through menopausal breakouts and at the same time have extremely dry skin.  Since I have used the Argan oil, my face has never been dry. My skin is  younger looking... I put it on at bedtime and my face is so soft  in the morning unlike other products that I have used that just left my face feeling so dry soon after.  I use it under makeup and my makeup goes on smooth and blends well. My skin looks amazing...  I am hoping that this helps out others going through the same issues that I went through....  I love this product....</li>
    <li> I got this oil after reading an article about Argan oil. After research, i found the Argan oil - Pura d&#x27;or brand that comes 100% pure and organic. After few weeks of usage, I notice my skin had become much more softer and shiny. I mix it with Organic virigin coconut oil and it works for me. Worth trying this oil and value for money....</li>
    <li> I love this argan oil. In addition to using it on my face at night, it cleared up the stubborn psoriasis above my ears, it smoothed the scratchy skin on my feet in just 1 application, and it&#x27;s been great for my dry hands.  I was skeptical that it would be as good as Josie Maran argan oil, as it costs so much less, but I find it to be just as good.  It&#x27;s organic and comes from Morocco.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical that a 100% Argan oil, as this product claims to be, could cost so little compared to other authentic brands. Nevertheless, I decided to give this a try. Huge mistake! Cannot believe I paid over $20 for a product that does not smell nor feel like real Argan oil. Where did all these positive reviews come from? Compare this product with a sample from other reputable brands and you too will see that you&#x27;ve been fooled. I now use this as a lotion substitute for my hands only, just to help finish the bottle. I cannot use it on my face or hair. Do not waste your money on this product, please.</li>
    <li> In my 66 years, I have tried many moisturizers (some very expensive) to help with skin dryness and wrinkles, but none did what this oil has done for my skin.  I was skeptical about using oil on my face, but with so many glowing reviews I thought it was worth a try and am so glad I did.  It has made my wrinkles less noticeable and my face looks fresher.  It really is amazing stuff!</li>
    <li> I have only started using argan oil and this brand is the first i tried. so far, so good. i like that it doesn&#x27;t smell at all, which means it won&#x27;t clash with my perfume or stain my clothes. the consistency is not too heavy and i like how my skin &amp; hair feels after i apply it.</li>
    <li> LOVE it!! only used it twice but already my face feels amazing. It smells great, doesn&#x27;t feel oily or greasy, glides on smoothly, and the packing was cute :). Will be ordering more from them!</li>
    <li> it works just as well as the josie maran argan oil and is wayyyy cheaper. It makes the skin feel and look amazing.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing! I have dry skin and needed something that would hydrate and treat my sometimes flaky skin. I have noticed my skin is much more smoother and has a healthy glow.</li>
    <li> very happy with the product</li>
    <li> This is the best organ oil I have ever used. The results are outstanding either on skin or on hair!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a month now and my hair and skin never felt better. I usually put it after I shower when my hair is approx 80% dry in order to seal in the moisture. It gives my hair a healthy shine and my ends aren&#x27;t as rough anymore</li>
    <li> Product is really quality. I am happy with it.</li>
    <li> I like the pump style dispenser.  The product is great for my cuticles and hands especially in the winter time. I use it on my hair too. I was a little skeptical since it&#x27;s priced much cheaper than what I pay at the local health food store but it seems to be the real thing.</li>
    <li> Her skin drinks it up... now I am going to have to buy some for myself! I will write more when I do!</li>
    <li> I was looking for an alternative to Josie Maran&#x27;s Argan Oil which is fantastic but a bit pricey for everyday use especially since I love to slather it on my body, hands, face, and the ends of my hair. The healing properties of Argan oil is incredible my skin is supple, moisturized, glowing and just feels really healthy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wanted an Argan oil that was 100% pure argan oil, cold pressed, and without a scent. Pura d&#x27;or seems to be the answer for me. I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> This is a great pure Organic Argan Oil. I am so happy with the purchase. I wanted to wait before writing a review to make sure it works and I am glad I did, it works incredibly. If you have dry skin this is the right product for you. At this time of the year my skin used to be very dry but thanks to this product my skin is very soft and moisturized.</li>
    <li> I got it recently, do I don&#x27;t have long term experience with it. I use it mostly at bedtime for quick moisturizing- great when tired and don&#x27;t feel like fussing too much! There is no fragrance- completely odorless - skin is nice and soft in the morning! I would recommend it!</li>
    <li> amazing stuff, works wonders for bearded faces!</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. Goes on so light, doesn&#x27;t clog pores....leaves skin so soft. Great product and great value!</li>
    <li> This product is awe inspiring. I was thrilled when I received my bottle and started using it my hair feels amazing now so soft and shiny. The ruff feeling and dryness is gone it is no longer falling out. I will continue to use this product because I love the results.  A few drops goes along. I highly recommend this wonderful oil.</li>
    <li> I was bitten by a dog about two months ago, and I have been using this oil to prevent a scar.  Right now, I have four tiny teeth marks (and this was a BIG dog) that are still fading.  The original bite wound was about five inches. I don&#x27;t know how it would work on one&#x27;s face, as I have super sensitive skin, but I can tell you that it is effective on the body. I haven&#x27;t noticed any scent, and it&#x27;s not greasy.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a 43 year old woman living in the dry climate of Northern Colorado with all the skin and hair issues that go along with that.  I have been hearing about argan oil for some time and finally decided to give Pura D&#x27;or a try. I am very happy so far with this product.  I use it most on my color treated hair.  My hair is super dry and bleached to a fair-thee-well.  The argan oil smoothes out the dry straw without any greasy residue.  I&#x27;m able to leave my hair down and it looks nice and healthy.&lt;br /&gt;I also use the oil on my forehead creases and under my eyes.  I noticed after about the 3rd day of using it under my eyes, the tiny lines are smoothed out and they seem less puffy. The oil absorbs so nicely into my skin-I love how it feels.&lt;br /&gt;The bottle I chose comes with a pump dispenser that gives out just the right amount.  1 pump for face, 2 pumps for hair.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m glad I found this brand.  I will continue to use it from head to toe!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a first time purchaser and truly recommend this product for hair. Adds sheen and lustre without any excess weight. Great product and value!</li>
    <li> We love it. My daughter and I use it morning and night as a facial moisturizer and on our hair as soon as we get out of the shower. I have naturally curly hair and it can be very frizzy, it is much better since I started using the Argan oil. My daughter has noticed an improvement in her acne as well. Over all it&#x27;s an amazing product and we will definitely buy it again!</li>
    <li> I have used several other brands of argon oil, but this is the best of all of them.  Better quality and results, especially on my face.  I have sensitive skin and Pura d&#x27;or leaves my skin hydrated and feeling silky smooth.  I also have psoriasis and this argon oil is helping the scaly patches to calm down and soften up.  I love the product and will continue to purchase only Pura d&#x27;or.</li>
    <li> After one application, the dry, hard spots on my chin are soft and healing.  The second application reduced eye puffiness and my face feels refreshed.  I can&#x27;t wait to see more results.  I bought argan as an additive to my homemade face lotion and it&#x27;s wonderful</li>
    <li> What a great price for certified organic Argan Oil!! Way better than Whole Foods or even a local health food store! I use it on my face every single day. It does not cause break outs and I put it in my hair sometimes as well. The best part about this oil is it does not have the weird smell that some argan oils can have.</li>
    <li> In a word: &amp;#34;love!&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this product.  I have long hair that has a mind of its own.  On humid days it&#x27;s frizzy and even knotted out of control.  On low humidity days it has lovely thick waves.  I wanted to have shinier hair without the added chemicals that seem so common in most drug store brands.  I even researched this.  It seems that dimethacone (sp?) is the common hair smoothing ingredient.  It&#x27;s also drying and once your hair looks good there&#x27;s this sort of backlash where your hair goes to crap, dry and damaged.  For the record I have a very simple hair regimen.  I wash, condition and dry it.  My hair is long, thick and so I&#x27;m told pretty.  After more research it seems that a pure oil approach would be the best.  It could be controlled better and there would be no damage to my hair.  I came across this product on Amazon and absolutely love it!  After showering and combing out my hair I add about 3-4 pumps of Argan Oil (my hair is very long!) and rub it into the length of my hair (never the scalp).  Then comb for about 30 more seconds and voila!  My hair is softer, smoother and shinier than every before with no more time than I would normally spend on my hair.  The comb now never a struggles to get through my hair and even a simple long ponytail is lovely.  My hair still has nice, soft natural waves without any frizz.  I really love this product!  Aside from shampoo and conditioner this is the only thing I put in my hair.  For so little effort it makes a radical difference in how my hair looks and even more importantly in how it feels so smooth and soft now.  This Argan Oil by Pura d&#x27; Or really is a fabulous product, and it has a fantastic, light nutty scent from the Argan nut!  Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> This product is amazing!  I have very dry skin and immediately upon using it, noticed a difference in fine lines and wrinkled.  My skin feel much softer!  I was drawn to this product because it is organic.  I appreciate the pump that comes with the bottle and the value is unmatched!</li>
    <li> Great oil. It has multiple uses. I use on the face, hair, nails.Recomend of it.</li>
    <li> I completely love this product! I use it on my hair, as a leave-in conditioner (1 part per 5 parts water), and I am loving the results. Also, I use it to clean my face with the OCM method. This product has so much uses that it is really amazing! I recommend investing some time on looking up the numerous applications for this &amp;#34;oil from the gods&amp;#34;!&lt;br /&gt;Also, the presentation of the product is very nice and you can tell the company cares about nature :)</li>
    <li> I have used several different brands of Argan Oil in the last 2 years, Pura d&#x27;or has been far superior then any other.</li>
    <li> I have been using this oil for about 2 months as a replacement for my nightly moisturizer and I love the way this makes my skin feel so soft.  It does not have a scent and is way more affordable than a well-known brand that got me hunting for such a product in the first place.  I would recommend this product and plan to repurchase it when I run out!</li>
    <li> I love this product!! Argan oil is excellent to repair damaged hair and for dry skin, which I have. You can literally use it from head to toe.&lt;br /&gt;I use it instead of night cream before I go to bed in winter time, and it really helps to keep my skin moist and nourished. I use it as a hair mask once a week to prevent dullness and fuzziness. I mix it with my body lotion so I get it on my body  as well to prevent dryness. I particularly like Pura d&#x27;or brand because they have my favorite oil in bigger bottle and more affordable price.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you</li>
    <li> This oil is absolutely wonderful.  My skin gets so dry and the argan oil makes it feel so soft and silky.  I&#x27;ve also discovered that this product provides a wonderful base for powder foundation and make-up.  A little goes a long way, so it&#x27;s an economical purchase as well.  I even use a tiny bit of this on my toddler&#x27;s fine hair to prevent static.  Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> It is REALLY good to use, no matter on body or hair. You can feel it is completely absorbed by your skin without any greasy or oily feeling.  It is just like water!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Pura d&#x27;or Argan oil for 7-8 weeks at night and in the morning before I apply sun block and BB cream. I can see a slightly different in my brown spot that is on my left cheek.  The brown spot has gotten lighter approximately 30%. I also my facial complexion is softer.  I really like the feeling of softness when I applied Pura d&#x27;or Argan oil after I washed my face.  I also applied on my cuticles at night.  It does make a big difference in the dry/roughness in the cuticles.  I will remember to apply on scars if I needed in the future.  This is the first time I use any oil product on my face.&lt;br /&gt;I have recommended to my friends and family of Pura d&#x27;or Argan oil.  And will surely continue to use the unique product and more. My friend and I purchased this product thru her Amazon account for free shipping&lt;br /&gt;Please send to me my 1 time Free bottle of this wonderful Argan oil.  Chris Nguyen 8158 Torrell Way San Diego, CA  92126  Thank You</li>
    <li> I really love using pure argan oil in my hair -- I always put it on my ends after washing my hair, and it keeps my hair from becoming tangled or frizzy. It leaves my hair with a pleasing sheen that is never greasy-looking, and I can even style my curly hair with it (using no other product).  It also works well as a &amp;#34;lotion&amp;#34; -- very softening and moisturizing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pump on this product makes it easy to use -- no spilling, dripping, or dumping.</li>
    <li> Great product, SOFT hair!</li>
    <li> We live in very dry climate and my skin is always dry. I started using Pura d&#x27;or argan oil last week and my skin has already feeling soft, supple and thoroughly moisturized. I use it on my face and neck and love it! I also have acne prone skin, haven&#x27;t noticed any difference in the acne/acne scars yet. I guess its too soon to notice the scar fading within a week.</li>
    <li> This oil works wonderfully for your skin! I have combination skin but it has been extremely dry since the cold weather and electric heat are upon us. My lotion just wasn&#x27;t helping so I tried this and I am so glad I did. I use it twice daily on my face and neck, after a shower and after washing my face at night. Very strange but it actually clears up blemishes as well, they are almost invisible the next morning. I tried on my hair also, but I think it is a bit too heavy for me, I have very fine hair and it just looked greasy with using a small amount. I think it would work great if you have thick and/or curly hair.</li>
    <li> I have been using this wonderful pura d&#x27;or argan oil on my face, nails, hair and even feet.....I don&#x27;t think I will ever be without it for my daily beauty routine, and even  using it on my 10 and 6 year old grand girls.  It smooths their ponytails, and makes their skin soft after a bath. My skin has shown visible signs of softening, and I feel comfortable using on my body from head to toe.</li>
    <li> Great product. I use a tiny bit on the ends of my hair after I style it and mybaplit ends and frizz are gone. I also add it to my DIY body lotion.</li>
    <li> I love how versatile this oil is. I use for my hair and to moisturize my face and the results are excellent. Also, it doesn&#x27;t leave an oily finish.</li>
    <li> Incredibly nourishing Argan Oil by Pura d&#x27;or! I&#x27;ve been using this daily as a moisturizer on my face and hands. Although it takes a couple of minutes to soak in, the moisturizing effects are noticeable throughout the day. Would recommend to friends and family.</li>
    <li> This product is not 100% argan oil. The product overwhelmingly smells like tea tree oil.</li>
    <li> dont know ,but my colleagues have commented several times ,if i dying my gray hair.it seems that this is a miracle product!</li>
    <li> I use this on my skin and hair.  It is great!  Only buy organic Argan oil without fillers.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product from a 50% retail Groupon deal.  I liked the claim that it was organic and for the price and volume, it seemed like a really good deal, and I was very excited when it arrived.  However, upon the first use, I immediately became somewhat doubtful as to whether this product is 1) organic and 2) even 100% argan oil.  Reason being is because as soon as I pumped a couple of small drops into my palm upon my first use, I was immediately hit with a faint but very \\&quot;there\\&quot; medicinal smell.  Kinda like Noxema.  That alone makes me a bit skeptical about this company&#x27;s claim that this product is 100% organic and 100% argan oil.  Even in its raw state, before it&#x27;s cold-pressed to remove it&#x27;s natural scent, argan oil is said to have a nutty smell.  I can&#x27;t imagine why 100% argan oil would have a medicinal smell.  All that being said, I haven&#x27;t experienced any adverse side effects, but I can say that it doesn&#x27;t make my skin as soft as my old stand-by, Eden Allure argan oil.  On the plus side, it did absorb into my skin quickly, which is to be expected of argan oil.  But unless I am offered a logical reason as to why this product smells the way it does, I will probably not use, much less buy, it again.  I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s a bad product, but I am a somewhat doubtful as to whether the product is what the company claims it is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: I&#x27;ve changed my review from 3 stars to 5 stars.  In response to the seller&#x27;s reply to my comment, I went to a local store and took a whiff of tea tree oil and I can confirm that this is indeed the medicinal smell that emanates from my bottle of argan oil.  So, I decided to give this brand of argan oil another try and I have to admit that my skin has never looked better.  I haven&#x27;t had a single breakout since I&#x27;ve been using it and even the lines under my eyes have significantly diminished which is something that no eye cream has ever been able to do.  I would actually give this 4.5 stars if I could since it still doesn&#x27;t make my skin feel as soft or supple as Eden Allure argan oil and I really miss that.  But even though my skin doesn&#x27;t necessarily feel incredible it still looks incredible, so you won&#x27;t hear too many complaints from me.  I will definitely buy this brand again, but that probably won&#x27;t be for a long while since this 4 oz bottle will likely last several more months, which is great.make my skin feel as soft or supple as Eden Allure argan oil and I really miss that.

    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about six months. In the hot, humid summer, and in the brutally cold winter, this is the perfect moisturizer for my face. I have used countless moisturizers over the years, and this one doesn&#x27;t clog my pores, and I love the fact that I&#x27;m not rubbing chemicals into my face each day, twice a day. I wish I had started using this sooner.</li>
    <li> I am letting my gray hair grow in and I am using Argan oil to keep the grays as soft as the browns. It is working wonderfully.</li>
    <li> Best quality argan oil out there, especially for the price. I only use it as a moisturizer for my face &amp; body; not too sure how it would do on my hair. But I&#x27;ll try it out at some point because natural heat protectants are great for hair that see a lot of &amp;#34;flat iron &amp; blow dryer action&amp;#34;. So far, my skin feels smooth &amp; soft. Argan oil doesn&#x27;t leave that greasy residue you may find in other oils and this is 100% pure. Great brand, great deal, hands down.</li>
    <li> oh my goodness this is some seriously good stuff.  This is my second bottle of this amazing oil.  My first was a 1oz. size.  I&#x27;ll have this jumbo one for a very long time.  I live in the high desert southwest, and skin is just plain dry.  I have tried everything and then I FINALLY found this, and tried it.  I had heard about Argan oil, but thought it was just another all hype product...WRONG!!!  This stuff is all I use, period.  I was my face, and apply a thin layer of this and thats it.  It obsorbs and leaves my skin fed...is the best word I can think of to describe it.  I have seen an incredible improvement in the quality of my 57 yr old skin, since I began using argan oil about 3.5 months ago. The dry flaky patches I couldn&#x27;t resolve, are gone.  The texture is smooth, and my pores are smaller due to the hydration. That stretched, stressed appearance has relaxed. Of course whatever lines I have are still there, but they are greatly softened. It really is one of those things that until you try it, you just have no idea. It is soothing, healing, hydrating and decadent.  If I wear foundation, which is rare, I use an airbrush, and applied on top of this, just causes it to adhere so beautiful.  I really don&#x27;t even know how to explain properly, how wonderful this \\&quot;light\\&quot;oil is, and what is does for skin...and hair.  It might seem expensive, but concidering this 4 oz bottle will last an easy 8 months, using it am and pm, its not that much, and well worth every penny anyway. Thanks again Amazon for providing us with such a wonderful product....and I didn&#x27;t even have to leave the house...yeah !!!!!</li>
    <li> My hair was pretty dry and damaged after bleaching it so many times to get it to a certain color. After using this product just once I noticed an immediate difference. My hair was a lot softer and silky looking with far fewer split ends. It seemed as if all the damage from the bleaching was almost gone. I&#x27;ll continue using this product to keep my hair healthy.</li>
    <li> Great size and great price! Most other bottles cost more for smaller sizes. Argan oil has been amazing for my face.  My skin is much less oily, clearer (less breakouts) and acne scars are even fading.</li>
    <li> Makes my skin soooo supple and smooth.  Would def order this again.  Thanks!</li>
    <li> I am happy with this product.  Argan oil is so good for my skin.</li>
    <li> I had the regular Moroccan Oil used on my hair previously in the salon. Upon reading reviews of that compared to the pure oil of this brand, I chose to go with the pure oil and miss the additives. I was afraid the extras would dry my hair out in the long run, something I definitely don&#x27;t need especially when it&#x27;s blonde. I typically have greasy at the roots and dry ends. Not only does this make my hair look freshly cut and solve the frizz. elmininating the need for other frizz combating products. I also have been able to completely skip conditioner since I started using it. It takes just a couple squirts so this product is actually saving me money by switching,looks better, and saves me time. An all around plus.</li>
    <li> Extremely happy with this product! It works SO much better on my acne-prone skin that organic coconut oil.</li>
    <li> I use Argan oil on my face and hair. That&#x27;s all I use and since I started using it, I&#x27;ve had no problems with my skin. This is a high quality product. I recommend it.</li>
    <li> I wanted to try Argan oil because I heard great things about it. i selected this product because of the great reviews and I am so glad I did. The oil makes my skin and hair so soft! I also used it on my children&#x27;s hands that were red, dry and cracked from the cold weather. My kids really liked it because their skin was greatly improved and it did not have the smell of Vitamin E. I would buy this again.</li>
    <li> I bought this product because everyone was raving about it. I can see why. Now I am doing all the raving! I&#x27;ve already convinced quite a few people to buy it. I&#x27;ve dry and sensitive skin, so I was initially skeptical about using it on my face. But I was very happy with the result once I tried it. Took about a week for me to feel any difference. Now this is the only thing I use. It&#x27;s a wonderful moisturiser, making your skin supple and soft. Can&#x27;t say I care too much for the smell, but the good news is, it wears off within seconds. Great product. I&#x27;d definitely buy more of it. And of course recommend it to my friends.</li>
    <li> A good quality Argan oil product. It works well as skin moisturizer and for hair.</li>
    <li> I love this argan oil! It does amazing things for your hair and skin! However, the pump feature that it comes with wastes almost half of what you are trying to apply.  I would give it 5 stars, if they only had other applicators! Overall, probably worth the investment in comparison to other argan oils out there. Plus it is organic!</li>
    <li> I really enjoying making and using healthy lotions, cleansers, sunscreens, etc. as recommended by the site WellnessMama.  I have used Moroccan oils before and really like the results.  This product is just as it states; it calms my frizzy hair and is soothing for my acne prone skin.  Highly recommend it.  I will be using is for hair, skin and nails as much as possible.</li>
    <li> I like this argon oil because I can use for face, hair, body and my children very safe. This item is 4fl oz big bottle I can use anytime any amount and very good for sensitive skin i beleve this argon oil wii change my 10 years later looking.  I make own lotion for face, I add some argon oil with water, lavender oil and glycerine, and after the lotion I put this oil to protect to dry. For hair, I also make own hair spray with this oil. Water, Rosemary oil lavender oil and this argon oil. My hair condition is changed now. It&#x27;s very smooth and healthy looking compare when I used jojoba oil before. I really recommend this argon oil.</li>
    <li> I bought this oil for 2 purposes: to create a facial moisturizer with my essential oils, as well as to tame the frizzy mess of curls that I have. In a week, I noticed my skin texture and appearance is smoother and softer. My frizz has been tamed and I can blow dry my hair straight by pre-washing with this oil. Prior to this oil, I had to use a hot iron as well, which did more damage.I wish I had discovered this sooner. The price is very good for an organic, cruelty-free product. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Great Product! I am allergic to almost everything out there on the market, but this oil is amazing. It&#x27;s light on my skin and does not leave a greasy residue. It&#x27;s just right, I&#x27;ve also used it on my hair, and it leaves it silky and manageable.It does not weight it down. I will continue to purchase this product from now on.</li>
    <li> Especially good supplement or replacement of face moisturizing regimen during dry winter weather. Quite a large size for the amount you would use and at a very affordable price compared to other oil products.</li>
    <li> This is my second bottle ordered and I love this product!  I am a 57 year old woman who needs to moisturize my skin, but do not like to use products with artificial ingredients.  The Purador Argan Oil absorbs quickly, without leaving me feeling greasy.  I highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> It arrived fast, nicely package and very happy with the feel of this oil.  It feels good on face and hand.</li>
    <li> I used to have very bad and weak nails after using this Broadus my nails change now they healthy and strong</li>
    <li> Okay, I found 100% pure quality at lower price elsewhere.</li>
    <li> Buyer beware: the bottle came unsealed. Who knows what is inside. I had to toss the bottle. :(</li>
    <li> Love this! Feels amazing on my face and keeps my skin looking beautiful.</li>
    <li> I have very long, very thin, very fine hair that I have dyed and highlighted about every 5-6 weeks. In spite of always using premium shampoo and conditioners, it continually looked fuzzy and dry, especially the ends. Because it&#x27;s so thin and so fine, even small amounts of most leave-in oils make it look immediately greasy and dirty, which is a dealbreaker for me. My hairdresser recommended Argan oil because she said it&#x27;s super light, not greasy, and works great with all hair types. Skeptical, but always willing to try something that may help, I came home and ordered the pura d&#x27;or from Amazon. WOW...the difference in my hair is truly remarkable. It looks healthy, shiny, and best of all, NOT greasy in the slightest. I have never been more impressed with a hair product. The fact that it&#x27;s organic and you can use it on your face and body is nice, but the most important thing to me was what it did for my hair. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Omg! Love this for my forehead and wrinkles underneath my eyes! Love it! Put a few drops in my handmade essential oil lotion bars! Also added to my homemade body wash! Wow! Feels so silky!</li>
    <li> Using still no results yet</li>
    <li> I havent used it for too long but I like it. Just be cautious and don;t put too much on your hair or it will look oily</li>
    <li> I have very dry skin and rosacea.  It was not as noticeable in my thirties, but now I&#x27;m in my forties my skin is always bright red.  I started using the clinique redness remedy (cleanser, toner, creme - $35+ per product x 3 and lasts about 2 months) about 3 years ago and after a year left my skin very dry and only a slight improvement on the redness, but it was the only game in town so I stuck with it.  My 70 year old neighbor has the most amazing skin and suggested I use try her argan oil for a week.  After using the organic argon oil (no other cleanser, moisturizer etc.) on my face for only 10 days my skin is about 30% better and improving every day in reduced redness.  My complexion is brighter and skin to the touch no longer feels parched and thirsty, it feels like it did when I was in my 20&#x27;s.  Better results, chemical free and totally affordable.  I&#x27;ll be a customer for life.</li>
    <li> tl;dr - If you&#x27;re looking for genuine Moroccan argan oil, this is not it. Pay the pretty penny that it&#x27;s actually worth and get it from a reputable dealer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There&#x27;s just no way this is genuine 100% argan oil: the smell is off, the look is off, the feel is off. If it seems too good to be true...it probably is. There&#x27;s a reason it&#x27;s so cheap, y&#x27;all. My cocnut oil feels lighter weight and absorbs more quickly into my skin than this stuff, which is ridiculous since coconut oil takes forever to absorb and usually leaves me feeling a bit greasy relative other oils.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can only guess that all the other positive reviews came from folks who a) had never moisturized with any kind of oil before, so are shocked by the great results even if they&#x27;re just slathering vegetable oil all over their faces (by the smell and feel of it, this stuff is undoubtedly diluted with some other kind of oil and/or water) and can&#x27;t stop raving about it b) are being paid to write scam reviews or c) are crazy. Maybe all of the above.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had only wanted to try argan oil because of all the hype, but in the end I just can&#x27;t see how one oil could be so much more superior to another that has so many of the same properties. This bottle of scam oil is going back and I&#x27;m sticking with coconut. It gives me a beautiful, smooth complexion and carries many of the same properties as argan oil without the labor intensive extraction process and therefore at a fraction is the price. If it ain&#x27;t broke, don&#x27;t fix it.</li>
    <li> This product has perfume added to it, which totally irritated my sensitive skin. I purchased this product , &amp;#34;100% Argan Oil&amp;#34;, which it is not,  to use at night instead of night cream,  but the scent is harsh and it produced bumps on my skin. ..DOES ANY COMPANY MAKE,  100% PURE ANYTHING, ANYMORE? No !!!</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s really good for my hair and face. I love it.</li>
    <li> I have used this argan oil for a while now, and it has definitely resulted in smoother skin. I use it in place of a moisturizer in the morning and it lasts the entire day without seeming greasy. I also recommend it for the Oil Cleansing Method. It works wonders.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing!! I have only been using it as a night time moisturizer for a few weeks and can tell a huge difference. My skin is clearer and feels smoother and more even!</li>
    <li> I am 67 years old and my hair is thinning, and very brittle in the front.  I purchased this product to help this problem.  It has been about 10 days and the difference in the texture is amazing.  I have also started using it on my cuticles and hands and have noticed my skin is so much smoother.  Used on  my face and love the softness. This is my new go to product for everything.  Thanks, love it.</li>
    <li> I heard so much good things about this product and got it on another site to try it on my hair.  I apply it on damp hair and work it through the top of the hair.  My hair becomes so smooth and shiny, best hair conditioner I have ever had!</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing and has a varity of uses.  I would highly recommend it. It is great for all skin types and hair types.</li>
    <li> This is a great product for hair.  I used it because my hair was long, dry, and brittle.  After using it once, I felt a big difference in my hair that I absolutely loved.</li>
    <li> When a product does what it is supposed to do, you get return business.  The quality is great and there are so many uses for argan oil you can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
    <li> My hair use to be rough, and after using this product my hair felt silky smooth.  I also used it on my face and it helps with the dryness.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this product!</li>
    <li> This is a great product for dry skin people like me. I used this for only about a few months. it really helps a lot.</li>
    <li> Got this product a while back, used it alone as a night moisturizer for face and hair for anti-frizz I also combined it with lotion for the body. Next, I will try it on my dry cracked heels to see if its effective. So far, it has been a great product.</li>
    <li> This is the only Argan Oil I&#x27;ve tried that consistently moisturizes and doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy residue. When you immediately apply it, it looks like you&#x27;ve put oil on your face, but if you wait 3-5 minutes, it really does penetrate the skin and truly moisturizes and doesn&#x27;t stop. I definitely recommend it- on your face alone, in your hair before styling, as a hair mask, or blended with other oils!</li>
    <li> Sincerely speaking this product has helped me in softening my dry scalp and skin. I use it daily on my natural 4c hair and it leaves my hair so shinny without greasing it, and plus it does NOT clog the pores. I will definitely buy it again.</li>
    <li> In the winter time, my very fine hair tends to be frizzy all the time. After searching solution online, I brought this product to help. It really works! It helps smooth my hair and stops tangling. I adore this product dearly. Be sure to avoid upper end of hair. Just apply hair below your ears. Or it causes greasiness after hours.</li>
    <li> I just received mine today, pretty good size bottle I expect it to last some time.  I&#x27;ve been hearing about argan oil so when I saw it cheap on a sale website I went for it.  My hair is frizzy/thick/wavy and this stuff is feeling great on it! Also great on my skin and I can really see that it will be a mutli use product which I like.  Very nice feel. I try to buy natural products whenever I can but expect them to work as well as unnatural.  So far I really think I&#x27;m going to love this!</li>
    <li> This product is great for my hair. I put a little bit after a shower and the result is silky, smooth and shiny hair. I also use it on my face and skin. It moisturizes without clogging pores. I highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> Perfect for my thick wavy/curly hair. Does not aggravate my skin and fragrance sensitivities. I massage in a little dab to wet hair and let air dry. It&#x27;s nice to rub the leftover residue into my hands as well instead of having to wash off some nasty smelling hair product.</li>
    <li> Well named! This is pure gold, and a little goes a long way.  I have very curly hair that tends to frizz in humid weather and get dry and damaged in hot weather.  I just add a bit of this to my normal styling cream and my hair is soft and frizz free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Additionally, I have really dry skin and get scaly patches on my cheeks and hands.  I&#x27;ve used just a drop or two on my face and hands after showers.  And that&#x27;s all gone away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While having comfortable skin and frizz free, manageable hair are critical, the fact that it leaves no greasy residue locks in my vote for this as on of the best products I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
    <li> It is not as moisturizing as I would of liked. But it is good for your hair. Has a nice odor. Not strong.Good for the lips. Just not happy with it for my face.</li>
    <li> This great product has multiple uses; moisturizes skin, softens cuticles, and makes hair sleek and smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The good news is that a little drop will go a long way, but this means you need to go easy with it, especially in the hair. More good news is that this means the product will last a long time!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff certainly comes in handy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was lucky to receive a complimentary sample, but I have long been a fan of Moroccan oil.</li>
    <li> This stuff is awesome. I use it as a moisturizer on my face and on my hair. I started to use it daily on my hair (even when I haven&#x27;t washed it) and my hair is much healthier. It&#x27;s shiny. I don&#x27;t need to trim it so much! It&#x27;s been over 8 weeks since my last trim and it looks like I just got it cut. All because of this! And the price is great!!</li>
    <li> I am so happy with this product.  My hair has never felt softer or been shinier.</li>
    <li> This is an okay product but I&#x27;m not sure what all the hype is about. While it leaves you skin shiny it is not greasy, which i don&#x27;t fully understand. I used on my hands and some dry patches of skin. I hear it works well on hair but I&#x27;m still hesitant to use it on my curly hair which i have finally found the right products for. There is no odor which is associated with this product which is nice as if the bottle and dispenser. While i can appreciate the benefits of this product I prefer using a regular old moisturizer.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a few weeks. The Argan Oil has a subtle and pleasing smell, if I had to compare it to something I&#x27;d say olive oil &amp; rosemary (though it doesn&#x27;t smell like food!) The dispenser works well at dispensing a perfect \\&quot;pea-sized\\&quot; drop of oil on each squirt - a little goes a long way. I message a few drops into my face, hands, fingers, and nails for a minute or two before bedtime and when I wake up. It has become a part of my morning and nighttime ritual, very relaxing and soothing. I especially like the feel of rubbing it into my forehead, where I tend to get dry skin; and it sometimes gets an extra treatment during the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My nails which I keep fairly short haven&#x27;t broken since I&#x27;ve started, so they do seem to be getting stronger. And pushing down the cuticles as part of the routine has made them look nicer, too. It does seem to be making my skin softer and smoother.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One cautionary note: It comes in a glass bottle which will shatter if accidentally flung off the nightstand. So recommend keeping it in the pouch it comes in and safely tucked away in a drawer.</li>
    <li> I have been using this oil for awhile and decided to buy the larger size.  I use this in my shampoo, conditioner, body lotion, face lotion, etc.  Great for dry skin.  I add one drop to my face lotion in the dry winter months.  Fantastic product.  Will buy again.</li>
    <li> The Marketing Director of the Company graciously sent me a full sized 4 oz bottle of Pura D&#x27;or Pure &amp; Organic Argan Oil to try with my review for Amazon.  To my total delight the oil turned out to be very light weight and quickly absorbed into the skin.  It is non-greasy, which I particularly like.  I have an oily t-zone on my face and am very hesitant about even using a lotion on my face.  With this oil, the fear is gone.  I use it around my eyes, the outside corners and underneath for any wrinkles beginning to appear on my 68-year-old skin.  Also, I use it on my neck, the backs of my hands and nails.  I particularly like to use it on my nails and cuticles.  Having used it for a few weeks, I am amazed that the bottle never appears to have been used almost like the fabled coin purse that always contains coins.  This will last forever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Feel free to buy with the highest recommendation from me and a joy to look forward to for yourself.  Thank you Victor for the gift!</li>
    <li> This oil is just amazing, all the pura d&#x27;or products as well. I was kind of sceptical, but now I can assure you that it works.</li>
    <li> this is great product and really worth the price. love it on my hair.</li>
    <li> I have frizzy hair but adding this oil to my hair creates beautiful wave.  I shampoo, condition, then add this oil, air dry and I&#x27;m done!</li>
    <li> I am using the argan oil for my skin after surgery to help with the healing of the scars.  I&#x27;ve noticed my scars are getting lighter and the skin is soft. It has really helped me. It&#x27;s been only 1 month, so I hope as I continue to use the argan oil, I&#x27;ll see even bigger improvement. My surgeons even said the scars are really looking great.  I believe in argan oil and all its benefits !!</li>
    <li> Amazing product! Definitely recommend it! Great buy</li>
    <li> My husband loves it too!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m confused with all the hype around this product. Works fine for hair, but a greasy alternative to lotion.&lt;br /&gt;HAIR:  I&#x27;ve  been using it for about a month now on my hair.  It works fine.  It takes a bit to get used to figuring how much to use.  To much, and your&#x27;re back in the shower, there&#x27;s no fixing it.  I use 2 pumps on my (fine, blonde, shoulder length) hair when it&#x27;s damp, then another 1/2 pump mixed with water after it&#x27;s dry. As other reviewers have mentioned, you do not need a lot.  Great, right.  Try getting a nickle-sized squirt of oil evenly through your hair.  I mix mine with water for more even distribution.  It keeps the frizzies down, and I like that it&#x27;s natural.&lt;br /&gt;LOTION / MOISTURIZER:  After reading all the 5 star reviews I was sooo excited to try this as  a moisturizer.  I was already breaking up with my makeup consultant in my head, thinking this was going to replace my current moisturizer.  I put 1 squirt on my face- didn&#x27;t even cover half my face I used a second squirt, and added some water to even it out. It felt like baby oil on my face.  Same thing on my body.  I put it on my legs, but it didn&#x27;t soak in.</li>
    <li> Disclaimer: Pura D&#x27;or sent me a bottle for review purposes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve heard a lot about argan oil as a multipurpose cosmetic treatment, but I felt like I could quite figure out how to get the most out of this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For hair:&lt;br /&gt;I tried putting it in dry hair - but it made my hair look oily. I tried putting it in damp hair, same effect. I tried using less... and I got oily patches (couldn&#x27;t distribute it evenly).&lt;br /&gt;I tried putting it in my hair at night and washing it out in the morning; I don&#x27;t think this had any effect. Maybe it would make my hair stronger with repeated use though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For skin:&lt;br /&gt;I tried it on my face, but my skin was feeling oily already at the time and I had some zits, so putting even more oil on it didn&#x27;t feel very good.&lt;br /&gt;I tried it on dry skin patches (like the rough skin on my elbows)... and this was pretty great. Softened the dry skin right up.&lt;br /&gt;Seemed good as well as a general skin moisturizer (instead of body lotion).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I&#x27;m not sold. It seems okay but not really better than my normal hair/skin products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, if you already like using argan oil, this brand seems good quality and the bottle is a big so a good value for the price.</li>
    <li> When I got my bottle of pura d&#x27;or argan oil it was nicely packaged in a cloth bag. It has a very pleasant aroma to it and is easy to apply with a squirt mechanism which seems to squirt out just about the right amount. I found that pura d&#x27;or argan oil was a great moisturizer. I plan to continue using argan oil as a moisturizer for the foreseeable future.</li>
    <li> Love it. Helps my skin from feeling dry and has noticeably helped to reduce the fine lines around my eyes. I use it on my hands and neck and chest as well. Great stuff!</li>
    <li> This is the most amazing skin care product I have ever used. Besides leaving my skin soft and supple, it soothes inflammation and helps to heal. It isn&#x27;t overly heavy and works well under makeup.</li>
    <li> The most pathetic argon oil I&#x27;ve ever used. It&#x27;s heavy on wet/damp hair. Makes your hair and scalp itchy.</li>
    <li> i have  worked in casino before  , i alway  have  night shift ，and i  need  wash hair  everyday ，so  i have calvities now。I&#x27;ve tried many types of shampoo，i love this shampoo，you  can use it everyday  and your hair will not  dry 。my hair feels fuller ，and i introduced it to  my friends， i love this shampoo，i will buy  it  again。</li>
    <li> It is awesome! I have used Josie Maran&#x27;s Argan oil and this pura d&#x27;or Argan oil, I have to say that they are the same except pura d&#x27;or has a much cheaper price tag, way more affordable yet the same quality! I have skin allergies when I put on unnatural, cheap products, I have already gone through a bottle and I love it! I can see my skin become soft and glowing :D I even recommend Argan oil to my friend and my brother, who also have extreme skin allergies. He loves it and use up all my Pura d&#x27;or Argan oil bottles! Now I need to restock some :) :) :)</li>
    <li> I bought this product because my hair was damaged from using the flat iron... I love the way my hair responded to the treatment.. I have also started using this on my dry skin as well... it works amazingly!!  I would recommend this to anyone with dry/damaged hair or dry skin!!</li>
    <li> Best Argan oil ever. I have tried so many different ones and this is by far the very best for the price.</li>
    <li> Have added some other essential oils and use this on my face twice a day.  No more dryness!  Complexion is good.  Love the way it absorbs into skin, leaving it very soft.  Just a few drops does the trick!  Will definitely order this again.</li>
