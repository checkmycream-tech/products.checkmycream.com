      <li>ORIGINAL REVIEW:</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t love how much time this takes, and wish my nails could grow faster.</li>
      <li>Wasn&#x27;t expecting a magical fix but ir did absolutely nothing.</li>
      <li>no bad smell.</li>
      <li>It is gel-like, dries quickly, and has no odor.</li>
      <li>My first purchase had a problem and they were fabulously helpful.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this product and am happy she finally found something that works.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m giving this 4 stars just because the company behind it is awesome.</li>
      <li>I was positively mistaken!  </li>
      <li>On the plus side, the product is easy to use, odorless, not messy or oily, and is quickly absorbed.</li>
      <li>I am certain that any firm that conscientious makes a great product.</li>
      <li>Honestly, I was relieved, thinking it would grow back fresh and new.  </li>
      <li>First off no one asked me to post this and no one gave me a discount on my purchase.</li>
      <li>Thanks Asti Life!    </li>
      <li>this is first product to work me.</li>
      <li>Yes, I do exactly what the bottle asks, just as I was doing before.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been putting a lot of effort into my body recently and figured that, with summer coming, it was time to be able to wear sandals without having to worry.</li>
      <li>I was a licensed cosmetologist.for many years, and I have always taken care of my feet, especially since I was diagnosed with Type 2 Diabetes in 2003.  </li>
      <li>The only reason I&#x27;m not going to a doctor to get this fixed is because I&#x27;m pregnant and do not believe I am able to use RX creams.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s simple and easy to use.</li>
      <li>Wish  read the reviews more carefully as they all state they received some sort of compensation for the positive feedback.</li>
      <li>As you can imagine, the Canadian winters can really do a number on your skin.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Honestly, I didn&#x27;t hold out much hope for this remedy, but figured it couldn&#x27;t hurt matters.  </li>
      <li>Who knows hat is really inside the bottle.</li>
      <li>and they look much healthier now.</li>
      <li>I did not keep taking weekly pictures, but pretty much right after my last pic (#5 in the first shot)</li>
      <li>My nail still needs work and is quite damaged but the new growth at the cuticle looks promising...</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m confident enough to come back and post a before &amp; after photo!</li>
      <li>So far I&#x27;m seeing positive results and hope this is the answer to a longstanding problem.</li>
      <li>I swear I&#x27;m otherwise a clean freak, well-kempt young lady who happens to have a gross fingernail!</li>
      <li>I am very that its all natural</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll have to wait a few more months for that.    </li>
      <li>I think I&#x27;m finally headed in the right direction.</li>
      <li>Many people have toe nail fungus and don&#x27;t even know it until it&#x27;s in an advanced stage and is really difficult to get rid of.&lt;br /&gt;You</li>
      <li>After a few days using this product we had noticed that his nails look more clear and healthier.</li>
      <li>the funny thing is, I only use it once a day!  ASTI Restore is liquid gold!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Let&#x27;s be honest, products like this normally take months to work, if they work at all, and if you have to take antibiotics to get rid of a fungal infection, you&#x27;re looking at treatment for approximately 9 months</li>
      <li>I am completely floored over the immediate results of this product and</li>
      <li>I took off my gel nails to find my natural nails were discolored and detaching in places from fungus, so I decided to try this.</li>
      <li>It feels like that for my entire life I&#x27;ve had one &amp;#34;messed up&amp;#34; toe - second toe on my right foot, right next to my big toe.</li>
      <li>No odor and no mess.</li>
      <li>So I&#x27;ve been using the product pretty religiously since mid June 2015.</li>
      <li>It does require you to file the nail daily before use, but I&#x27;ve found that just a quick buff is enough to open the nail up for treatment.</li>
      <li>After 20-plus years of a strange nail that is absolutely huge!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>because oh my gosh I might actually have a normal toe</li>
      <li>About 2 years ago, I noticed my big toenail had become partially detached and not long after I could see the recognizable signs of the dreaded fungus.  </li>
      <li>In less than a month you can see some pretty substantial nail changes.</li>
      <li>My nail is almost completely grown back out, and the fungus came back, too.  </li>
      <li>I used the whole bottle and it did nothing to even slightly get rid of my toenail fungus.  </li>

<li> My nail is almost completely grown back out, and the fungus came back, too.  </li>
<li> I used the whole bottle and it did nothing to even slightly get rid of my toenail fungus.  </li>
<li> My nail is peeling constantly, the skin around my nail is now peeling, and I&#x27;ve all but given up on this \\&quot;natural treatment\\&quot;, especially since I have halted using any nail polishes or other treatments on my nail.    </li>
<li> /&gt;Since I&#x27;m dealing with such a small nail, I found that less than half a pump of product was more than enough to cover it.</li>
<li> The nail has always been different, and it&#x27;s been that way for so long that I gave up on trying to treat it.</li>
<li> Last September, while I was packing to move, I dropped a very heavy box on my toe and it became further detached and soon after, it came off, completely.  </li>
<li> (I was crazy hesitant to buy this product because most of the reviews said they got a discount for using and writing a review on it.)    </li>
<li> It&#x27;s a long battle.</li>
<li> and I only saw real results with 1, and it took at least 2 months for that to happen!  </li>
<li> I wash my feet and dry and file diwn before putting on.</li>
<li> I have tried prescriptions, OTC, and now Asti Life, needless to say I still have the fungus it is more a waiting game for it to clear up.  </li>
<li> Fast forward to a mere 3 days later, and......</li>
<li> This product is working to clear my toenails, slowly.  </li>
<li> So far, ASTI Restore seems to be helping my damaged fingernails, but it&#x27;s a slow process.</li>
<li> I hope this is helpful for other skeptics...</li>
<li> Past reviews made me want to try this product, I have had a nail fungus from a botched pedicure last spring.  </li>
<li> &lt;br /&gt;Dull, with no shine&lt;br /&gt;A dark color, caused by debris building up under</li>
<li> and they had dark color.</li>
<li> You may feel pain in your toes or fingertips and detect a slightly foul odor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> but I figure if you&#x27;re on this page you&#x27;re probably pretty desperate too.</li>
<li> The ugly yellow color of my nail is almost gone and the nail is starting to grow back.</li>
<li> thank you for letting me try your product for little money</li>
<li> This stuff is way over-priced and works no better than other products at 1/3 the price.</li>
<li> and I do not have any irritation like other products i have used in the past.</li>
<li> Don&#x27;t waste your money like I did</li>

    <li> It feels like that for my entire life I&#x27;ve had one &amp;#34;messed up&amp;#34; toe - second toe on my right foot, right next to my big toe. The nail has always been different, and it&#x27;s been that way for so long that I gave up on trying to treat it. I&#x27;ve been putting a lot of effort into my body recently and figured that, with summer coming, it was time to be able to wear sandals without having to worry. I&#x27;m so glad I chose ASTI Restore because oh my gosh I might actually have a normal toe again!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since I&#x27;m dealing with such a small nail, I found that less than half a pump of product was more than enough to cover it. It does require you to file the nail daily before use, but I&#x27;ve found that just a quick buff is enough to open the nail up for treatment. My nail is still a bit discolored but after a week I&#x27;ve noticed a difference in the thickness at the nail bed! After 20-plus years of a strange nail that is absolutely huge!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m so glad I&#x27;ve started to see results and am very excited to continue to treating my feet. Hopefully in a month or two I&#x27;m confident enough to come back and post a before &amp; after photo! I did receive this product at a discount but price doesn&#x27;t change how well it works, nor does it effect my review!</li>
    <li> Many people have toe nail fungus and don&#x27;t even know it until it&#x27;s in an advanced stage and is really difficult to get rid of.&lt;br /&gt;You may have a nail fungus if your nail is:&lt;br /&gt;Thickened&lt;br /&gt;Brittle, crumbly or ragged&lt;br /&gt;Distorted in shape&lt;br /&gt;Dull, with no shine&lt;br /&gt;A dark color, caused by debris building up under your nail&lt;br /&gt;Infected nails also may separate from the nail bed. You may feel pain in your toes or fingertips and detect a slightly foul odor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why I picked Asti Restore:&lt;br /&gt;Asti restore helps to kill all types of nail fungus.&lt;br /&gt;100% all-natural product&lt;br /&gt;Proven to work and 100% money back guaranteed if used as directed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We have just started using this product, and are looking forward to great looking toenails again!</li>
    <li> I was a licensed cosmetologist.for many years, and I have always taken care of my feet, especially since I was diagnosed with Type 2 Diabetes in 2003.  About 2 years ago, I noticed my big toenail had become partially detached and not long after I could see the recognizable signs of the dreaded fungus.  Last September, while I was packing to move, I dropped a very heavy box on my toe and it became further detached and soon after, it came off, completely.  Honestly, I was relieved, thinking it would grow back fresh and new.  I was positively mistaken!  My nail is almost completely grown back out, and the fungus came back, too.  I was frustrated because I had been using a topical liquid anti-fungal treatment for the past several months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Honestly, I didn&#x27;t hold out much hope for this remedy, but figured it couldn&#x27;t hurt matters.  Fast forward to a mere 3 days later, and......My nail is fully attached again!  Seriously!  Never, in a million years did I imagine I would be writing a review on this product after only 3 days!  Let&#x27;s be honest, products like this normally take months to work, if they work at all, and if you have to take antibiotics to get rid of a fungal infection, you&#x27;re looking at treatment for approximately 9 months and you still have to wait for the nail to fully regrow.  I am completely floored over the immediate results of this product and the funny thing is, I only use it once a day!  ASTI Restore is liquid gold!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Needless to say, I give this the highest of recommendations.  I have tried a total of 3 different nail fungus treatments before this and I only saw real results with 1, and it took at least 2 months for that to happen!  This is a magical miracle in a bottle!  If you have nail fungus, this will knock it out.  I am very thankful I was able to try this at a discounted rate, in exchange for my honest, unbiased feedback and review. I couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
    <li> As you know, it is difficult getting rid of nail fungus. I have tried several remedies that did not work for me. This one did and the best part is it is all natural and made in the USA! What a great gift this was~</li>
    <li> My daughter has had a toe nail fungus for a month or more. She plays basketball year round and we have tried several products for her toe nail. I have even tried medicated prescription that were prescribed by her doctor. Nothing seemed to work well. I sprayed asti Restore on her toenail 3 days ago and we see results already. She&#x27;s begging me to order more! I highly recommend this product and am happy she finally found something that works. No odor and no mess. It&#x27;s simple and easy to use.</li>
    <li> My husband toe nails were a mess! After a few days using this product we had noticed that his nails look more clear and healthier. Really a great improvement! We are very pleased with this product.</li>
    <li> I have tried out her fungal remedies and I can honestly say this is a miracle in a bottle. After using it for a week, I can already see and feel the difference. There is a lot of pain that goes along with nail fungus plus it&#x27;s nasty looking. I figure in about another week I can pull out the candles. The ugly yellow color of my nail is almost gone and the nail is starting to grow back. It&#x27;s a wonderful product and I plan on keeping it around. I have received this at a discounted price for my honest unbiased review.</li>
    <li> Not perfect but working better than a month prescription of lamisil</li>
    <li> i like this product a lot. i had two infected toe nails. and they had dark color. using this product helped the color go away and they look much healthier now. easy to put on. no bad smell. thank you for letting me try your product for little money</li>
    <li> I have to say that I have seen no improvement since using it twice a day, every day. I moved onto tea tree oil and now have started Senega Snakeroot Extract. At least for me, the product did not work.</li>
    <li> Great item truly works. I have had toe fungus for over 15 years this is first product to work me. I am very that its all natural and I do not have any irritation like other products i have used in the past. This item is great for the even the most sensitive person like myself!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclaimer: I was able to purchase this item at a discounted rate in exchange for an honest review.</li>
    <li> Wish  read the reviews more carefully as they all state they received some sort of compensation for the positive feedback. Wasn&#x27;t expecting a magical fix but ir did absolutely nothing. Bottle label looks like it is printed off a home printer.  Who knows hat is really inside the bottle. Don&#x27;t waste your money like I did</li>
    <li> Update: my nails are still short, but they are starting to reattach to the nail bed and they are no longer discolored. I&#x27;m very happy, it works! I&#x27;ve updated my review to five stars, because this is doing the job just fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Original review: So far, ASTI Restore seems to be helping my damaged fingernails, but it&#x27;s a slow process. I took off my gel nails to find my natural nails were discolored and detaching in places from fungus, so I decided to try this. On the plus side, the product is easy to use, odorless, not messy or oily, and is quickly absorbed. I think my nails look cleaner, although they&#x27;re still weak and are growing out very slowly. On the minus side, it was disappointing to find that I&#x27;d have to keep my nails cut very short for the product to work optimally. I don&#x27;t love how much time this takes, and wish my nails could grow faster.</li>
    <li> This product is working to clear my toenails, slowly.  I have had the fungus so many years, and have used a lot of products, plus prescription drugs, so I don&#x27;t expect a cure.  ASTI Restore is giving me hope for better control of the problem.  It is gel-like, dries quickly, and has no odor.</li>
    <li> This stuff is way over-priced and works no better than other products at 1/3 the price. Anyone who has deal with nail fungus knows there are no miracles. It&#x27;s a long battle. Even systemic (oral) medications are not always that effective. Most of the reviewers of this product admit they were compensated. &amp;#34;Cured in 3 days&amp;#34;...I doubt it.</li>
    <li> Seems to be working. No overnight results as others have claimed but as the nail grows out it looks like a healthy nail.</li>
    <li> As you can imagine, the Canadian winters can really do a number on your skin. When it&#x27;s cold out, the moisture gets sucked out of your skin and it gets dry, cracked, and irritated. That&#x27;s why I was so excited to receive my Asti Life Restore today. I consider it to be mandatory winter skin defense. It&#x27;s great for helping out your tender toes after being in boots out enduring the elements all day. Thanks Asti Life!    ~ Al Bargen, Canada.</li>
    <li> I used the whole bottle and it did nothing to even slightly get rid of my toenail fungus.  Waste of money!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m giving this 4 stars just because the company behind it is awesome. My first purchase had a problem and they were fabulously helpful. I am certain that any firm that conscientious makes a great product. So far I&#x27;m seeing positive results and hope this is the answer to a longstanding problem.</li>
    <li> Past reviews made me want to try this product, I have had a nail fungus from a botched pedicure last spring.  I have tried prescriptions, OTC, and now Asti Life, needless to say I still have the fungus it is more a waiting game for it to clear up.  I have not noticed an improvement since I have started using this product.</li>
    <li> UPDATED REVIEW: 8/19/15    Apologies for the later than promised update.    This product stopped working. Yes, I still use it twice a day. Yes, I do exactly what the bottle asks, just as I was doing before. I did not keep taking weekly pictures, but pretty much right after my last pic (#5 in the first shot) my nail basically regressed... the big off-white bits returned and it started looking almost as nasty as when I first started using the product. My nail is peeling constantly, the skin around my nail is now peeling, and I&#x27;ve all but given up on this \\&quot;natural treatment\\&quot;, especially since I have halted using any nail polishes or other treatments on my nail.    The only reason I&#x27;m not going to a doctor to get this fixed is because I&#x27;m pregnant and do not believe I am able to use RX creams. I&#x27;ll have to wait a few more months for that.    Furthermore, I did not authorize this image to appear on Pinterest: [...]    I realize Amazon is a public forum so I know I have no control over what other people do, but now people who click their link will see that this product indeed does NOT work and has not remotely cleared up my nasty finger. Lowering my rating because the product fails to \\&quot;remedy\\&quot; nail fungus.    ORIGINAL REVIEW: 7/6/15    First off no one asked me to post this and no one gave me a discount on my purchase. (I was crazy hesitant to buy this product because most of the reviews said they got a discount for using and writing a review on it.)    That said, I didn&#x27;t want to use something harsh on my nail because I&#x27;ve tried them and nothing worked.    So I&#x27;ve been using the product pretty religiously since mid June 2015. In less than a month you can see some pretty substantial nail changes. I think I&#x27;m finally headed in the right direction. Sorry for the disgusting pictures of my nasty nail but I figure if you&#x27;re on this page you&#x27;re probably pretty desperate too. I swear I&#x27;m otherwise a clean freak, well-kempt young lady who happens to have a gross fingernail! I&#x27;llcontinue to update as time goes on. I hope this is helpful for other skeptics... My nail still needs work and is quite damaged but the new growth at the cuticle looks promising... Fingers crossed.</li>
    <li> this product is great to use on sunburn, you will not peal</li>
    <li> I started to use this product on two nails that have some fungus in them. I wash my feet and dry and file diwn before putting on. I noticed that in one nail the nail is staying thin and its not growing back thick. My husband has really bad toe nail discoloration and fungus and he will be trying this as well. I will update later on how it is working. I recieved this item discounted in exchange for an honest review.</li>
