      <li>and you will love it.</li>
      <li>I absolutley LOVE  </li>
      <li>ok.</li>
      <li>I absolutely love this product.  </li>
      <li>Then I decided to look online, and was so glad to see it on Amazon.</li>
      <li>This is one of my favorite mascaras</li>
      <li>but It is my favorite.  </li>
      <li>favorite part of this product is the comb (rather than a brush).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I used this product for many years then it was discontinued, I called every drug stoe in Atlanta looking for it.</li>
      <li>I think I might be more satisfied.</li>
      <li>I love this mascara.  </li>
      <li>So, since I love it, i order it online.  </li>
      <li>,It is my favorite mascara ever, LOVE the comb applicater perfect long lashes with just 1 swipe of the lashes...</li>
      <li>The only true comb on I have been able to find since Max Factor discontinued the best comb on to ever have existed!</li>
      <li>I ordered this product for my girlfriend, because she is a huge fan of the Lash Stylist Comb Mascara.</li>
      <li>, it&#x27;s smooth going on and there are no clumps.  </li>
      <li>it&#x27;s so unique a product...</li>
      <li>I loved the product when it was available in local stores...</li>
      <li>so I save it for special occasions rather than wear it for every day.</li>
      <li>this mascara serious makes my lashes so freaking awesome.</li>
      <li>It goes on much more clumpy than when new which is why it gets 4 stars instead of 5.</li>
      <li>This is the only place I&#x27;ve been able to find it, I hope they keep distributing it here!</li>
      <li>This is a GREAT mascara except it has dried out.  </li>
      <li>I love trying different mascaras, so I decided to give this one a try because of the unique brush.</li>
      <li>It separates, lengthens, and when you learn to get the brush right to the lash line they curl up as it dries.</li>
      <li>I spent most of my time upon application trying to smooth through the clumps, so I won&#x27;t be purchasing this again.</li>
      <li>I use the wand with my other mascara and it works fine:)</li>
      <li>mohahaha;)</li>
      <li>and you can save so much $$ to!</li>
      <li>Instead I&#x27;d love for all you to go to the Maybelline site and send a note asking for it back....</li>
      <li>There is really nothing positive I can say about it.</li>
      <li>really works wonders on my eyelashes.</li>
      <li>I would never pay this much for washable.</li>
      <li>Thanks</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m really bummed that they discontinued this in the stores.  </li>
      <li>I will start ordering and stockpiling for when they completely stop making them!!!</li>
      <li>I had ordered this product many many times in the past because I can only get it online.</li>
      <li>so the ones I bought online, although not used, are older now and the mascara has thickened over time.</li>
      <li>One application looks like several of any other kind without the clumps.</li>
      <li>I love the comb, and it does not clump like most every other mascara I&#x27;ve been trying for the past ~30 years.</li>
      <li>Great product, but wrong color.</li>
      <li>So it&#x27;s a big health risk buying it because we don&#x27;t know how fresh it is even in unopened packaging.&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
      <li>Also the waterproof is better if you can find it in Very Black.</li>
      <li>Created nice, big, long lashes, but definitely not for contact lens wearers.</li>
      <li>I always order the exact same product.</li>
      <li>Very sad, but I will still say this is by far the best mascara or makeup product in general that I have ever used.</li>
      <li>And was very surprised and very unsatisfied to receive this last shipment</li>
      <li>This is because it&#x27;s old because it was discontinued.  </li>
      <li>It was not waterproof and not Black, but brown.  </li>
      <li>i&#x27;ve been looking high and low for this mascara and read somewhere that it is discontinued.</li>
      <li>No other mascara even comes close to the definition, volume, and length that I achieve with this mascara.</li>
      <li>No other mascara compares.</li>
      <li>For those complaining it&#x27;s dry when they receive it, no duh!</li>
      <li>If you have never used a comb mascara it may take a few tries to get used to applying it-but it is so worth it!</li>

<li> I am down to my last one!</li>
<li> I found it to clump my lashes terribly, so I&#x27;m a little surprised at the few raving reviews here on Amazon.</li>
<li> Creates long, dark, glamourous lashes.</li>
<li> not really the mascara liquid that does the trick</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This is the most amazing mascara EVER! I&#x27;m a Mascara snob and when I found this years ago...I fell in love. I bought 10 and sent them to all my friends. I&#x27;m 32 and have never had my lashes look the way they do with this. HINT: It takes about 5-10 applications to get the hang of it...but when you do...you will be hooked!</li>
    <li> I love trying different mascaras, so I decided to give this one a try because of the unique brush. I found it to clump my lashes terribly, so I&#x27;m a little surprised at the few raving reviews here on Amazon. I&#x27;d recommend any other mascara from Maybelline instead of this one. There is really nothing positive I can say about it. I spent most of my time upon application trying to smooth through the clumps, so I won&#x27;t be purchasing this again.</li>
    <li> If anyone is considering buying this mascara I would think twice .Unopened mascara only has a shelf life of two years and I bought this product and I got a very very bad eye infection because it was past the shelf life date .The doctor says the chemical composition had changed causing irritaion to my eyes .Worst of all it caused color change to my Iris ,now my eyes are two different colors .This mascara did all this to me .Buyer Beware!</li>
    <li> I was so happy to find my favorite mascara that has been discontinued by Mabelline!</li>
    <li> This is the only mascara I have used for years. No other mascara even comes close to the definition, volume, and length that I achieve with this mascara. The comb applicator is what sets it apart. I was so devastated when I realized they had discontinued it, but thrilled when I was able to find it here. I sincerely hope that it continues being sold here. I have tried several other mascaras since it was discontinued and have only been disappointed.</li>
    <li> This mascara is amazing for the price. I have used clinque religiously and have tried other pricey mascaras until i found this one and you can save so much $$ to! It makes my lashes long and thick. I always get tons of compliements for girlfriends when I wear it. I have yet to find a replacement mascara as amazing as this. I wish maybelline would bring it back. And as for users that did not like this product the age of the mascara is a big factor to how long it lasts and how well it wears.</li>
    <li> Love this mascara, really hate that it was discontined..I just kept the comb and dipped it in another mascara..Works just as well...Can&#x27;t believe they r selling it for $40..Outrageous!!!!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product.  I&#x27;m really bummed that they discontinued this in the stores.  They always get rid of the stuff that actually works!  After I put on regular mascara I go over it with this.  It separates my lashes and extends them as well!  As long as Amazon keeps sellin it, I&#x27;ll keep buyin it!</li>
    <li> Created nice, big, long lashes, but definitely not for contact lens wearers. Smudged into my contact, and it would not come off with repeated rubbing with contact solution. Definitely not worth replacing two week wear contacts every few days.</li>
    <li> This mascara performed as stated - it is very waterproof and does not smudge or flake off and looks great up to 8 hours!  My only concern is that it goes on so thick that it actually feels heavy on my eyelashes so I save it for special occasions rather than wear it for every day.</li>
    <li> This is by far the best mascara I&#x27;ve ever used.  As always, we find a product we love and when we go to buy it again -- it&#x27;s DISCONTINUED!  UGH!  I&#x27;ve been searching for 2 years looking for Maybelline&#x27;s Lash Stylist Mascara.  I love the mini comb applicator, it&#x27;s smooth going on and there are no clumps.  Thank goodness for Amazon and it&#x27;s wonderful resources.  I stocked up and purchased 4 mascara tubes.  I&#x27;m thinking ahead.</li>
    <li> I had ordered this product many many times in the past because I can only get it online. I always order the exact same product. And was very surprised and very unsatisfied to receive this last shipment and it was the washable type and not the waterproof which I order every single time.It would cost me time and money to ship it back and it&#x27;s just not worth it.I don&#x27;t know if I will be ordering again.</li>
    <li> Product old &amp; dried up- not satisfied. Purchase this product before-last recv&#x27;d was unusable. Wish I could get refund or another</li>
    <li> I absolutley LOVE  this mascara. I have tried every mascara out ther,It is my favorite mascara ever, LOVE the comb applicater perfect long lashes with just 1 swipe of the lashes...I will not use anything else</li>
    <li> This is my favorite mascara wand ever! I don&#x27;t understand why they took them off of the shelves. It gives you Bridgette Bardot lashes! Lengthens and separates! Arrived at my house a little dry. I use the wand with my other mascara and it works fine:)</li>
    <li> I loved the product when it was available in local stores... my friends did, too!&lt;br /&gt;My favorite part of this product is the comb (rather than a brush).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, the item received was a bit dried out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My intent is to re-order the product but change my order from washable (which was a mistake on my part) to water-proof.  I think I might be more satisfied.</li>
    <li> I love this mascara.  It does not last long but It is my favorite.  Wish they would make it again!  Also the waterproof is better if you can find it in Very Black.</li>
    <li> This is one of my favorite mascaras and I was thrilled to find it online. Unfortunately it was discontinued a while ago so the ones I bought online, although not used, are older now and the mascara has thickened over time. It goes on much more clumpy than when new which is why it gets 4 stars instead of 5.</li>
    <li> Was very happy to have found this, but it was going to be a gift. Packaging is a bit too shabby to be a gift now though.</li>
    <li> Bought 3 or 4 of them. A couple of the pkgs. looked like they went through a war. Very little mascara in a couple of them. One was a little dried out. Very disappointed</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this mascara and was so upset when they discontinued it!  This is the only place I&#x27;ve been able to find it, I hope they keep distributing it here!</li>
    <li> I sure wish this product wasn&#x27;t discontinued!&lt;br /&gt;I love the combination of the Formula and the Comb applicator.&lt;br /&gt;It really works wonders on my eyelashes.</li>
    <li> This is by far the best mascara my mother or I have ever used. We were beyond disappointed with Maybelline when they discontinued it. My mom and I even called them to see if two ladies in California could make a difference to bring it back. Looks like we couldn&#x27;t. Very sad, but I will still say this is by far the best mascara or makeup product in general that I have ever used.</li>
    <li> i&#x27;ve been looking high and low for this mascara and read somewhere that it is discontinued. This is my favorite mascara and one of the best i&#x27;ve ever used - and I&#x27;ve tried a bunch! Very disappointed that Maybelline is discontinuing this brand.     Lifts and separates lashes. Creates long, dark, glamourous lashes. I love it.</li>
    <li> I ordered this product for my girlfriend, because she is a huge fan of the Lash Stylist Comb Mascara. The only problem is that I ordered Very Black and they sent me brownish black. Great product, but wrong color.</li>
    <li> I received the wrong order, i need waterproof</li>
    <li> First time I&#x27;ve been disappointed in my purchase from Amazon.  The articles were not as described, overpriced and the mascara was dried up when I opened them.  The mascara was supposed to be \\&quot;water&#x3D;proof and it was washable.  I paid $13.99 per package.  I would never pay this much for washable.</li>
    <li> The mascra which arrived were not the mascara described in the advert.  It was not waterproof and not Black, but brown.  What a waste of money!!!</li>
    <li> Once I took the time to learn to use the comb, this is the best mascara I have ever used. One application looks like several of any other kind without the clumps. It separates, lengthens, and when you learn to get the brush right to the lash line they curl up as it dries. I will start ordering and stockpiling for when they completely stop making them!!!</li>
    <li> This is a GREAT mascara except it has dried out.  This is because it&#x27;s old because it was discontinued.  So, since I love it, i order it online.  But guess i can&#x27;t do that anymore.</li>
    <li> I used this product for many years then it was discontinued, I called every drug stoe in Atlanta looking for it. Then I decided to look online, and was so glad to see it on Amazon. I ordered two of them. I have been nothing but pleased with this product! Thanks Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sincerely ,&lt;br /&gt;Pam Lyons</li>
    <li> I am going back to buy it, once again, after about 2 years of using it. I can&#x27;t even imagine going back to the brush. I love the comb, and it does not clump like most every other mascara I&#x27;ve been trying for the past ~30 years. I went through most of all expensive ones recommended as \\&quot;Reviewer&#x27;s Picks\\&quot;. I just wish they will keep making it. Give it a week and you will love it.</li>
    <li> Love, love, love this mascara! The only true comb on I have been able to find since Max Factor discontinued the best comb on to ever have existed! So now that you know this is a really good product, what do you think? Yes, of course,&lt;br /&gt; also discontinued!</li>
    <li> This is the Best mascara because it has an awesome comb that makes ur lashes so long and full. Why did maybelline discontinue this!!! If you have never used a comb mascara it may take a few tries to get used to applying it-but it is so worth it! The seller shipped in a timely manner -if they keep selling it I will keep buying!</li>
    <li> This is the best mascara ever made. Long, thick, LIFTS! It goes on like a dream and lasts all day long.</li>
    <li> This was my FAVORITE Mascara of all time but this have been DISCONTINUED for 5 YEARS...Yes, 5 years!!!&lt;br /&gt;So whatever is still sold here or circulating somewhere else is NOT FRESH it&#x27;s 5 years old in the TUBE, and sold in ridiculous prices. So it&#x27;s a big health risk buying it because we don&#x27;t know how fresh it is even in unopened packaging.&lt;br /&gt;For all we know it could be all dried up and growing bacteria inside the tube then we ladies apply it on our lashes.</li>
    <li> This is my all time favorite mascara. No other mascara compares. I wish they would sell it again. For those complaining it&#x27;s dry when they receive it, no duh! It&#x27;s been of the shelves for years! Use some eye solutions to moisturize it &amp; ta da!</li>
    <li> I used to wear this mascara all the time, unfortunately, they stopped selling this mascara years ago. and I am so happy amazon has it!! Seriously!! this mascara is the BEST MASCARA ever!!! I want to give it 10 stars!! so here is the thing.. it´s not really the mascara liquid that does the trick.. I mean it´s ok. it is the mascara brush!!! well, it´s more like a comb.. but anyway! this mascara serious makes my lashes so freaking awesome. a lot of people ask me if I am wearing fake eyelashes whenever i use it.. I would say buy it but I kinda want them all to my self! mohahaha;)</li>
    <li> Yes, it&#x27;s not available anymore and I did LOVE it...but is anyone SERIOUSLY buying this stuff at the gauging prices these folks are selling it for?  Sorry...not me!    Instead I&#x27;d love for all you to go to the Maybelline site and send a note asking for it back....it&#x27;s so unique a product...I can&#x27;t believe they got rid of it!    Go here to voice your opinion: [...]</li>
    <li> The best part is the \\&quot;comb\\&quot; instead of the standard brush! Even after the mascara is finished, you can use it to comb out your lashes that sometimes get clumped up with other brands of mascara!! I also recommended the mascara to my sister in law and she too purchased it on Amazon!!</li>
    <li> I ordered like 15 of these when i found out they were discontinued. I am down to my last one! I want it back!</li>
    <li> Nothing wrong with the product.  It was just not my preference. I found the comb delivered the mascara in a goop instead of applying it evenly like a brush.</li>
    <li> This mascara gives your eyes the dark, dramatic look without the clumps.  I had to buy it online because I couldn&#x27;t find it in stores anymore and it&#x27;s the best mascara for a night out!</li>
