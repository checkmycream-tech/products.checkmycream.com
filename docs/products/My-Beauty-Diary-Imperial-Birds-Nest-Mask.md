    <li> Works well on my mom  but makes me break out like crazy</li>
    <li> I like the masks. Not my favorite out of the series though. I like to use once during the week and once during the weekend.</li>
    <li> Love this mask but it does cause a little bit of itchy, irritation.</li>
    <li> It makes my skin so moist!</li>
    <li> This mask is very good.  It improves the skin a lot.  I really like it and would recommend it to other people.</li>
    <li> This is the first mask that I&#x27;ve used that honestly makes my skin glow. I ave used other MBD masks and they are lovely, but this one really knocks it out of the park. I&#x27;ve repurchased and will continue to do so. Also, the seller is legit. I&#x27;ve received knock offs before but this is the real deal and arrives quickly.</li>
    <li> These are sooo moisturizing and calming. I had CO2 laser on my face and kept these stored in the refrigerator to make them extra cooling/soothing when I needed them. I will definitely repurchase.</li>
    <li> Good product and very moisture to the skin.  Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> very good product and great price! I notice brighter skin just at the first time applying. I will definitely buy more from this brand! Happy buying.</li>
    <li> These are FAKE my beauty diary masks! They are NOT authentic, and my order came in with a giant rip/hole in the box and plastic wrap.</li>

Sleep with it on. It&#x27;s amazing how you will wake up the next morning!</li>
    <li> Good! So nice maskpack.&lt;br /&gt;I usally using this mask&lt;br /&gt;2 time a week.&lt;br /&gt;Good for my skin.&lt;br /&gt;Try it !!</li>
    <li> Wonderful. Thank you!</li>
    <li> I love the My Beauty Diary masks. These are some of my favorites because they feel so nice and soothing. My skin tone always looks more even after these.</li>
    <li> Smells good. Soothing.</li>
    <li> I am in LOVE with these masks! When you open the package, the mask is literally drenched in serum, so I used what was left over on my neck and hands. I left the mask on for about an hour or so, just to make sure my skin go the full benefits and had enough time to drink everything in. Once I took the mask off, my face was insanely moisturized and noticeably brighter, my skin has never felt so good. I can&#x27;t wait to do another one, they are truly addicting! I would most definitely recommend these masks!</li>
    <li> My Beauty Diary masks have been my favorite sheet masks for years. The Imperial Bird&#x27;s Nest &amp;#34;flavor&amp;#34; is among my favorite! These have a pleasant smell and my skin looks so bright and nourished after I take it off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By the way, I usually leave my mask on for around 40-50 minutes instead of the 20-30..I feel like it works better!</li>
    <li> Absolutely fantastic mask. Excellent, high-quality brand (and extremely affordable!). Everyone should incorporate My Beauty Diary products into their nightly routine (don&#x27;t wash it off!). Highly recommend.</li>
