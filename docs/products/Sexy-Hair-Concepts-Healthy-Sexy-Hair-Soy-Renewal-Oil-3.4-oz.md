    <li> Adds shine and makes my hair soft to the touch.</li>
    <li> This isn&#x27;t actually what I wanted, I accidentally ordered the wrong product but I figured I&#x27;d give it a try anyway and I love it! I put it on my hair still wet and it makes it so soft and dries way smoother than normal but the best part is that it doesn&#x27;t look greasy. Not going to lie it looked like it might be but it isn&#x27;t I promise. I even put some on dry hair and it didn&#x27;t get too heavy or weigh my hair down.  Really recommend</li>
    <li> It is a very good product! It is not a first time I use it, and beause I left so much setsfied, I buy it again and again!</li>
    <li> You need only a drop and it works wonders!  I like a lot of volume in my hair so I only put it in my hair from my ears down other wise it  weighs my hair down.  My hair looks healthier than it every has before, it truly gives that sexy hair look!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m getting older, my hair is getting thinner and breaking easier. Especially since I have to color it now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product keeps my hair strong and silky soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You don&#x27;t have to use a lot. I have very long hair, halfway down my back and curly (funny, it gets curlier as I get older...must be all that kinky gray hair hiding under the hair color) and this product will last me 6-9 months with almost daily use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I first purchased it at the recommendation of my hair stylist. And paid the hair salon price. Ugh. I can get a better price here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Plus they recently changed the bottle to be wider with a thicker top. Most awesome change. Now I can stand it on it&#x27;s top and get that little bit left out of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are having trouble with your hair being coarse and breaking easy, I highly recommend this product. Remember a little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> Love.. Makes my hair feel soft.. Also absorbs well doesn&#x27;t  leave it greasy looking like other oil have done..</li>
    <li> Excellent product for the most damaged hair</li>
    <li> product is good, but packaging is lacking.  once you open the bottle, it continually leaks.  it&#x27;s difficult to travel with; I wrap a Kleenex or paper towel around the lid and have to put it in a plastic bag or it leaks all over the suit case.</li>
    <li> Love, love, love this product! Wonderful for dry, curly, out of control hair! I&#x27;m on my second bottle and love the control and healthy shine on my hair!</li>
    <li> I actually got a small sample from Ulta store and tried using it.  I have very sensitive skin, and thinking this was for the face, I applied a small amount of this sample on my face, lo and behold, my skin felt so soft all day.  I also did not have any breakouts on my face, which is normal with other oils.  I liked this so much, thus, ordered this, and I&#x27;m very happy I did.</li>
    <li> I was given a sample of this oil at a local salon for my hair. I had previously used Moroccan oil so have this a try. Love it. After a shower I put a dime size amount at the ends of my hair then dry. It leaves my hair soft and manageable.</li>
    <li> My hair suffered a lot of damage after being on strong anti botics and other prescriptions for several months.  I was crushed.  My long hair just started breaking off and became very coarse,  My hair dresser suggested the use of Joico reconstruct shampoo and conditioner along with this soy argon Oil treatment.  I could not believe within a month how much improvement this combination did for my hair.  I used it for several years then thought I could go back to cheaper products.  Huge mistake.  My hair started having split ends again (something I have had trouble with all my life)  I found both products much cheaper here on Amazon and switched back and wow my hair is splint end free and frizz free again.  I will continue to purchase both products.  If you have split ends, damaged hair, frizzy hair, you should give this combo a try.  I never thought I would find products to tame my wild red hair.  Thank you amazon for carrying these products at a great price and delivering them right to my door!</li>
    <li> Tiny amount in wet hair controls frizz makes hair shine.</li>
    <li> This product is as described, arrived quickly and is reasonably priced. I use so little at a time, it goes a long way.  Love this stuff.</li>
    <li> I Have very dry wavy hair. When I flat iron my hair after using this product it makes my hair look as smooth as butter. I definitely will be buying again.</li>
    <li> If I use just a little bit it makes my hair soft and smooth. I blow dry it to help it work.</li>
    <li> Leaves hair smooth and manageable.</li>
    <li> I am so amazed at the difference in my hair. It&#x27;s more controllable and looks and feels healthier. It can be used at least three times a week either with damp hair or dry hair. My daughter bought it for me the first time as she uses it. It is just wonderful, so glad I found it.</li>
    <li> I still prefer my Unite Argan Oil but this was still an ok item and the price was less than my Unite Argan Oil.</li>
    <li> I really like this product. It adds shine and bounce to dry, over processed hair.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m quite happy with this oil treatment which is similar to a product my hairdresser used. It leaves my hair shiny and smooth.</li>
    <li> This is a miracle product; straight from the &amp;#34;mother-land.&amp;#34;  Gives shine and moisture without a greasy feel; has become a staple in my family.</li>
    <li> I have long, thick hair and this product my stylist used on my hair. It really is wonderful to the fullest. Never leaves a sticky, oily, heavy feel to my hair. The more you use the silkier my hair is. The heat from the hair dryer works with this product. The best argan oil product I have ever used without my hair feeling weighed down by product. Fantastic oil. I did pay $19 for it, which to me, is expensive. I have since found it for $13.  Well worth the $19, though!</li>
    <li> My favorite hair product for my thick, course hair.</li>
    <li> I moved from Las Vegas, NV about 3 months to Emeryville, CA.  I am now looking for a healthy, shinny  hair spray with the  same company.  I am pleased with you products and would like to hear from you.</li>
    <li> I really like this stuff. I went on line to get cheaper price than at hair salon. You had it. Problem is that the bottle leaks. Half of it is soaked into the carton. To return would leak out the other half. I&#x27;ll keep what&#x27;s left and be wiser next time. Perhaps you could pass this info onto the supplier so the next guy doesn&#x27;t have the same problem.</li>
