      <li>I just wished they&#x27;d make a reusable version to use with your own floss.</li>

      <li>Nice minty flavor.</li>
      <li>These picks got the job done, he really liked them.</li>

      <li>I liked these better than competitor&#x27;s flossers because both sides of the flosser can be used.</li>
      <li>This is a large pack for a great price.</li>
      <li>My son loves these and I am so glad he can floss his teeth well even with braces on.  </li>
      <li>Won&#x27;t be buying more.</li>
      <li>This is the next best thing to the Waterpik.</li>
      <li>love that you can use either side (unlike the competition)</li>
      <li>I use these every night and have gotten better with them - they have a bit of a learning curve.  </li>
      <li>So, I ordered these and they worked much better.</li>
      <li>Love these tooth picks.</li>
      <li>have better luck in using them.</li>
      <li>/&gt;These work much better.  </li>

      <li>and I love them.</li>

      <li>With these, she can floss with much more ease.</li>
      <li>The freebie ones from the Orthodontist were better though, but I can&#x27;t find them to buy them.  </li>
      <li>Wish I would have known about these when my kids had braces as they probably would have taken better care of their teeth.  </li>
      <li>I am used to using the flossers with the puff on them ( which I love).</li>
      <li>We&#x27;ll be buying more of these.</li>
      <li>My favorite part is the end side that has bristtles.  </li>

      <li>Its prongs are a bit more thicker and rounded compared to the Platypus.</li>
      <li>:) For anyone with &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; sized teeth, these probably won&#x27;t work.</li>
      <li>At night I use the glide orthodontic floss which I feel does a much better job of getting up under the gum line.  </li>
      <li>I wonder if that may be a problem for some people if the wire is more flush to the teeth.&lt;br /&gt;As</li>
      <li>Sure beats having to thread.</li>
      <li>the flexible pick and the ends adds a nice finishing clean up.</li>
      <li>They seem to be able to get to most areas quite easy with these flossers.</li>
      <li>The threads stay strong even when caught on metal brackets and they fit nicely even in the tightest spots.</li>
      <li>They work pretty good.</li>
      <li>Fits between most of my brackets and doesn&#x27;t shred or break too easily.  </li>
      <li>Fit better and just more convient.</li>
      <li>Work great for my 10 year old with braces!</li>
      <li>My daughter is able to quickly and easily floss between her braces which means she does it every day!  </li>
      <li>I love how easy it is to floss my teeth even in full ortho!  </li>
      <li>These are great for a 10 year old with braces.</li>
      <li>Much more kid friendly then the floss you have to thread</li>
      <li>Easily cleans.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Really good quality floss, our son uses only this one, and he has braces which make it very hard to floss with regular shaped floss picks.</li>
    <li> These are great for braces wearers. They are easily portable and work very well. I prefer the angle on these ones over the playpus flosser, I find it easier to manuver. I hate flossing with braces because it takes so long but these combined with my floss fish make it go rather quickly.</li>
    <li> my own orthodontist wasn&#x27;t aware of this product but I&#x27;d have a bunch of cavities if it weren&#x27;t for this!</li>
    <li> I found I don&#x27;t have the patience to floss each tooth with a string and the looped puller thing.  These are invaluable.</li>
    <li> My son loves these for his braces.  He has gotten good reports from the orthodontist and dentist for almost 2 years using these floss picks.  No other product did the trick.  thanks!!</li>
    <li> Fits between most of my brackets and doesn&#x27;t shred or break too easily.  I can use multiple times.  Nice minty flavor.</li>
    <li> These work great. Don&#x27;t shred, but are way expensive!</li>
    <li> i thought the tip would be hard. like for removing tartar/plaque caught under the braces.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the floss doesnt fit too.</li>
    <li> This is a great product if you have braces. These fit between the braces well. These  have a slight mint flavor. The angle is great for reaching the back teeth and front teeth. the pick at the end is thin and slides between teeth as well.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work with braces</li>
    <li> My kids have braces - these are too hard to get under the wires for my kids.  Won&#x27;t be buying more.</li>
    <li> If you have a power chain, it may be difficult to floss</li>
    <li> It has a resealable bag, the pick works well and the floss head fits under my wires. The mint taste is nice too</li>
    <li> Quality product but hard to get under brace wire. Every mouth is different but they just don&#x27;t work for my teenage child.</li>
    <li> My 8 year-old just got braces, and this really was the only way she would be able to floss with any success. Those threaders would have been a nightmare. With these, she can floss with much more ease. I don&#x27;t know that they are as thorough as using threaders would be, but for sanity&#x27;s sake, we&#x27;re happy!</li>
    <li> This is a large pack for a great price. They fit between the braces wires just like they&#x27;re supposed to. Easy to use. Haven&#x27;t had any issues with the strings breaking or the picks being flimsy. Seem to be great quality!</li>
    <li> It works. Very good product.</li>
    <li> The handle is too soft and bent easily. Cannot be used between tight teeth. There are suspicious white powder attached on the floss picks. Overall, very disappointed experience. Should stick to comfort clean and complete clean floss picks.</li>
    <li> I just got these in the mail so i&#x27;ve only used them a couple times. They work pretty good. If you don&#x27;t want to use those plastic floss needles (not sure what they&#x27;re called) these will work. If you have some brackets that are tight or close to other brackets then these won&#x27;t fit in-between your wire. They are worth the time you will save flossing. Also, you might have to use 2 each time if your teeth are tight because the floss starts to shred a little but the time i&#x27;m done with about 1/2 my teeth.</li>
    <li> My daughter is able to quickly and easily floss between her braces which means she does it every day!  Much butter then the flossing tool given at the orthodontist</li>
    <li> I gave this 5 stars because as a professional in sales with braces, I&#x27;m very self conscious about my teeth.  I purchased in May 2013 when I got my braces on because it was so difficult to threat that floss between every single tooth!  I make sure I don&#x27;t leave home without these in my purse!  They get between all of my braces except 2 (2 small bottom teeth).  I&#x27;m very happy with Dentek Floss Picks for braces, they are very comfortable (don&#x27;t cut gums when they slide between teeth) and they slide in between the wires.  I will continue to order them while I have my braces on... This is my 2nd purchase so far this year.</li>
    <li> My husband got braces and could not deal with using regular floss. These picks got the job done, he really liked them.</li>
    <li> Excellent.  Very nice product. Efficient and useful.&lt;br /&gt;The thread is strong and does good job. I think it is a must have.</li>
    <li> These are great for a 10 year old with braces. For the first week after he got them on, I tried to help him floss with the regular floss but it was so time consuming! I knew I couldn&#x27;t do this for 2 years, haha. The orthodontist had given him samples of some similar floss picks &amp; he liked them so I ordered 4 packs of these! They allow him to floss independently &amp; he does it twice a day! His first 2 visits back he got compliments on how clean he is keeping his teeth. :)</li>
    <li> Now if I can just get my kid to actually use them...</li>
    <li> I bought these because I needed an easy way to floss with braces.  I also purchased [[ASIN:B001F51RBU Glide Threader Floss, 30-Count Boxes of Single-Use Packets (Pack of 4)]] and my orthodontist gave me something similar to the threaders.  I found those too difficult to use - it&#x27;s hard because you have to push the floss through tight spaces and catch it on the other end.  They just didn&#x27;t work for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These work much better.  I wouldn&#x27;t say they&#x27;re perfect, but they&#x27;re the best thing I&#x27;ve found.  For me, the only problem is they are slightly curved, which works well to floss with your dominant (right for me) hand.  But when I have to floss the right side of my mouth, the curve means I need to use my left hand, and it&#x27;s harder to get the flosser exactly where I need it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I have the bands anchoring my braces on the second to last molars, which means it&#x27;s hard to floss between my back three teeth, since the band takes up most of the space.  I wait until the end to floss those teeth, since I can usually get the flosser in between but it tends to snag on the bands and is no longer taut.  But the floss doesn&#x27;t snap or shred.  For those needing to floss with braces, I would recommend this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDIT 12/4/12:  I recently visited the orthodontist and was complimented on how well I&#x27;m cleaning my teeth.  This is my second time with braces, and the first time I don&#x27;t think I EVER received such a compliment - I didn&#x27;t floss then.  I use these every night and have gotten better with them - they have a bit of a learning curve.  Just keep trying and eventually it&#x27;ll take you less than 2 minutes to floss.  I have been considering still using these even when my braces come off.</li>
    <li> these floss picks are awesome for people with braces, the design makes flossing much quicker and easier to reach the back molars. shipped fast!!!</li>
    <li> If you have braces you need these! You can floss your teeth b/c it fits inside your brace wire. Its truly unbelievable! Its too hard to floss otherwise. This is as easy as using a toothpick!!</li>
    <li> Great for braces, but pricey.</li>
    <li> My kids have used these the whole time they&#x27;ve had braces.  Saves a lot of time since you don&#x27;t have to thread floss.  Highly recommend them.</li>
    <li> My daughter had braces put on recently and I&#x27;ve been looking for a way to help her keep her teeth clean.  These work great.</li>
    <li> best service &amp; price ever!!! so happy with it. I would recommended it to anyone new to braces, makes flossing way practical and easier!:)</li>
    <li> Unfortunately, these did not fit under the wire of my daughter&#x27;s clear braces. She was unable to use them. She had tried the platypus brand, which did work fine.</li>
    <li> These do fit under the archwire of my braces but the only way I could see them working is if you had big spaces inbetween your teeth.  They are pretty flimsy.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve purchased these a few times and came back to purchase again today, but unfortunately the price has more than doubled since the last time I bought them. They&#x27;re great, but not worth $20 for a one month supply. I&#x27;ll be finding an alternative.</li>
    <li> These don&#x27;t work well at all. .. The floods is loose after the first Floss. . Not returning cuz not worth the hassle won&#x27;t but again</li>
    <li> the string itself is flimsy. would be a great product if not for that. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t fit between my braces and teeth. Worthless to me. Would have been nice if there was some indication that it does not work in all circumstances.</li>
    <li> Better than the other floss sticks I&#x27;ve tried for braces! These make it so easy, and you can carry a couple with you everywhere. I especially like that they don&#x27;t fray and that it has the proxy brush at the end. If you have braces, you must try these!</li>
    <li> My kids always used floss picks, so when my son got braces, he really didn&#x27;t know how to manipulate the floss and threader that his orthodontist suggested. Once he figured out how these work, the front is smaller and fits in between the bracket and wire, it was much easier and takes a whole lot less time. He uses them, they&#x27;re cheap and they work great. I only wonder why they aren&#x27;t sold in stores.</li>
    <li> I dont see how they are any special then the regular ones, but it does the job....just like the regular ones....and yes I have braces.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t find these anywhere locally, I have had kids in braces for 6 years, these are the only ones that get under those wires</li>
    <li> Yay!  These fit in under the braces on my upper teeth but not the lowers. Probably because our upper teeth are larger and the wires have more room.</li>
    <li> I bought these while I had braces, because they had fluoride. These are advertised for their ability to fit under your wire and between the brackets...they didn&#x27;t fit between my brackets (and I tried these in the last few months of my 24 month treatment, when my teeth were pretty much completely straight)! If you have gigantic teeth, these may work for you. :) For anyone with &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; sized teeth, these probably won&#x27;t work. Small teeth...don&#x27;t even waste your money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I held onto them for when I got my braces off, over 3 months ago. I tried these between my perfectly straight teeth once all of the metal came off, and the string broke after flossing the second tooth (un-crowded teeth, mind you)! I was going to give these to my mom to use, but her teeth are very crowded, so I knew these would break in a heartbeat! Into the trash they went.</li>
    <li> work good for both my kids who have braces.... otherwise the strings are hard to wrap around teethes.  Save time</li>
    <li> My favorite part is the end side that has bristtles.  It allows you to push food out and clean in between teeth without putting the whole tread in.  However, putting the tread in is tight but a lot better than the plackers brand.  There are some teeth that I can&#x27;t get the tread in, that&#x27;s why I bought a water pick.</li>
    <li> These fit so well under my braces and make flossing so easy.  It is such a chore to floss when you have braces, but these dental picks make it easy and fun.</li>
    <li> hard t o get in to teeth and through wires</li>
    <li> These braces-compatible flossing picks are quite pricey per package, but this kind works perfectly and comes in a 75-count bag, which is 3-5 times as many as most of the other brands (for the same price).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pointy end has a little mini brush that works well for poking bits of your meal out from your braces wire, and the flossing harp end is sturdy enough not to crumple up when flossing between the closest-fitting teeth.</li>
    <li> I can floss my teeth quickly with these but they cannot clean well enough as thread floss does for braces. The plastic sides of the pick are a little too thick and sometimes get stuck between my wires and teeth (I&#x27;m at the end stages of my braces, 8 months left). Since the sides are too thick the floss won&#x27;t go enough into the gums to floss. I don&#x27;t plan on buying these anymore. Thread floss works the best for braces, though it takes longer.</li>
    <li> These work and travel very well.  Occasionally the floss head will get stuck beneath the wire due to the way the floss is fastened, but it&#x27;s easily un-wedged and I have never had any major issues.  Definitely a life saver if you have braces!</li>
    <li> My girl always uses these with her brace on.  That&#x27;s the one kept after having tried several other products.</li>
    <li> Works Great! Fits Perfect! Great for Braces! Easy and comfortable use.</li>
    <li> My daughter likes these the best. She is 10 and just got her braces in August. They are easy for her to use and seem to work well.</li>
    <li> After I had spend $15 on these flossers, I was convinced they would work. When they arrived I was very disappointed to find out that they did not fit under my braces at all and were of no use to me.</li>
    <li> My son loves these and I am so glad he can floss his teeth well even with braces on.  I liked these better than competitor&#x27;s flossers because both sides of the flosser can be used.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work well with power bands on.&lt;br /&gt;The floss is flimsy and breaks, The toothpick at the end bends or breaks off.</li>
    <li> These really workwell with braces. They fit right under and allow my son to get to those hard to reach areas. Would buy again.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t fit under wires, couldn&#x27;t use them. Do not buy them</li>
    <li> Okay for front teeth but not useful for the back teeth. I have adult braces.</li>
    <li> Must have for quick braces flossing, while it doesn&#x27;t get as well as threading a piece of floss it does take about 1/5 the time. The floss rarely breaks</li>
    <li> Love these tooth picks. I used them when I had braces and now that my braces are off I still use them. They&#x27;re awesome but this type cannot be found in stores. Thank God for Amazon!</li>
    <li> These work perfectly for braces!  I used them the entire time I had braces.  I prefer them over other brands because they fit well even in between brackets that are close together.  I would say not only are they much simpler to use than the traditional floss threader, but they also clean between your teeth just as well.  My orthodontist always commented on how clean my teeth were.</li>
    <li> I have lingual braces - braces placed on the back of my teeth - and they&#x27;re incredibly hard to clean. I try and keep everything clean, brush with the best toothbrush, but hey - you gotta floss. Flossing with a regular string is impossible, and any other floss pick doesn&#x27;t work with my braces. This actually works! I&#x27;m shocked that it does, but it does! Hurray!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do, however, recommend using a water pick for braces, and using this as an extra, sometimes.&lt;br /&gt;The water pick just does it better when all else fails, at least for me.</li>
    <li> This is a lifesaver with braces.  How can you go without these if you have orthodontics?</li>
    <li> saves time to floss in between brackets.. pick is also helpful. i don&#x27;t think i can live without this floss while I&#x27;m on this annoying braces..</li>
    <li> These floss picks are the bomb with or without braces!!!</li>
    <li> i cant find any other floss like this that fits under the wire. i would recommend this to any one that has braces.</li>
    <li> My daughter finds it much easier to floss her braces with these than anything else. I&#x27;ll be ordering these again!!</li>
    <li> I like these floss picks much better than the Plackers Ortho Picks--the Plackers have a bump that makes it difficult to use the pick, especially with aching teeth after having had my braces tightened.</li>
    <li> These fit perfectly between the wire and your teeth. I couldn&#x27;t use the thread floss so these have worked out wonderfully!</li>
    <li> My 12-year-old daughter just got braces and had tried the threading floss.  It was difficult and it took her forever.  I was a little skeptical of this product at first, but I decided to try them after reading some of the reviews. My daughter loves them and flosses every night!  The flosser does get through between the teeth, but she did say that she can&#x27;t move the flosser around between the tooth and her gum because the wire prevents it. So I told her to use the pick on the other end to get to this area.  She uses one for a couple of days so hopefully this pack will last for awhile.</li>
    <li> I wanted to compare this brand to the Oral B dental picks. The plastic on these is much thinner and bends when I try to use them. This reduces the tension on the floss and causes the plastic wishbone to dig into my gums. These look similar to other brands so don&#x27;t be fooled. I find flossing by hand easier than using these.</li>
    <li> The plastic part flexes too much and the floss stretches and gets loose, so, it can&#x27;t be difficult to floss with these.  Will try different brands first before reordering.</li>
    <li> I love how easy it is to floss my teeth even in full ortho!  I can&#x27;t imagine trying to thread floss through each tooth &amp; how time consuming that would be.  These picks are definately worth it, trust me I&#x27;m a dental hygienist!</li>
    <li> It turns out, I can buy this at a regular store, so i did not need to order it on the internet, the product is ok, the floss seems to stretch too much so it can be painful to try and get it between the teeth, but it does the job</li>
    <li> These are great, much better than the Platypus flossers! They are the same size on both ends of the flosser, making it so simple to fit in between tight brackets. They make flossing so quick and easy, that a co-worker of mine was excited to use these with her braces! However, the opposite end of the flosser is not great. Like most braces flossers, the pick on the end is just too harsh for gums. If you are looking for a similar item to the end of these flossers, I highly recommend GUM Soft-Picks :)</li>
    <li> These work great for braces and are much faster than convetional flossing.  There are only a few spots that I now have to use regular floss on.  Highly recommend them!  Will definately order more.</li>
    <li> I only had my braces on for about 4 months now and trying to floss normally with the threads just made it a nightmare trying to feed it through. I needed some easy tool to help floss through these wires and I found these. I have been using them since Day One and I love them. My only complaint with these is that it is somewhat difficult to feed them through my bottom teeth because my bottoms are very crooked and the brackets are very close together in between teeth. Just be careful if you have the same issues with your teeth because the last thing you want to do is have to make an emergency trip to the orthodontist to get that bracket glued back on (Happened to me when I first got them on with these).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than that, if I didn&#x27;t come across finding these, I would be struggling trying to use those annoying threads to feed floss through. It&#x27;s not perfect, but it gets the job done and keeps my teeth clean and smelling nice.</li>
    <li> Both of my children are currently in braces. They seem to be able to get to most areas quite easy with these flossers. They are simply a must have for convenient flossing around braces.</li>
    <li> they DO NOT go under my wire!!!</li>
    <li> These work fine, I wish the head was a little narrower as they are kind of hard to fit in a smaller mouth. The sides are thin enough though to fit under the wire of my daughters braces so that&#x27;s good.</li>
    <li> I have had braces multiple times and have been frustrated with the amount of time that it takes to thread a floss needle and maneuver it underneath my arch wire in order to floss my teeth.  I was hesitant at first that this device would fit underneath the wire, but it does.  Hooray!  The only improvements that I would make would be to improve the bristle end to resemble GUM&#x27;s product and to make the floss thicker (but still slick) to help ease food particles away from the teeth and gums.</li>
    <li> The prongs were still too large to fit underneath the wires of my 11 yr old son&#x27;s braces (so useless for us.) Not sure how anyone who purchases these will know if it will or will not work (since, seeing other reviewers posts, it must work for some.) It definitely did not work for us.</li>
    <li> Wonderful product.  I would recommend this product to anyone.</li>
    <li> Pick edge was too large to fit between my sons braces.</li>
    <li> worst floss ever made! these are awful. how can I floss.. when its a struggle to get it in betweek my (tight) teeth. I&#x27;m was trying to use it all up (for weeks now) but I hate it so much I brought a completely different brand to try it out and I loved it. I got oral b complete and its is soooo much easier to use and better quality. I recommend going to big lots if you have one near you but I will never get this dentek brand again. dentek is like 20 cents cheaper so now I&#x27;ll stick with oral b floss picks. both brands are under 2 bucks at big lots</li>
    <li> My braces are a bit tight and these flossers did not fit under the brackets like the &amp;#34;Plackers&amp;#34;. Also, the floss ripped and shred, that did not happed with the other brand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would not purchase again.</li>
    <li> Unfortunately, my daughter did not want to use this product anymore after trying it daily about a week and occasionally, I would encourage her to try it again thinking she might get more familiar with the angle to use it successfully.  She was always in tears and said that it kept getting stuck on the sides and the back of her wires and would have to painfully pull it out.  She prefers the Platypus brand which is more expensive but does&#x27;nt cause her have to fight with the picks.  So, I will pack it up and return it for a complete refund is my only option.  Can you advise me on how to do this, please? Also, the information on the cost of the Platypus brand was not clear for how many there were in a package.  Please clearify.  Thank you.</li>
    <li> I do think it is a bit pricey. The price has even gone up by almost $2 since I last purchased a bag in January. However, they are cheaper than the competition.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My 11YO son and I both have braces. I don&#x27;t mind taking a lil extra time to use regular floss but realistically I do not expect him to do that. So at the sake of his hygiene I make the splurge. I also admit that they are timesavers when I am in a rush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love that you can use either side (unlike the competition)</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a good idea, but there isn&#x27;t enough freedom of movement. You can&#x27;t really floss properly, only kind of poke at your gums. Also, some brackets can be too close together, and it doesn&#x27;t work on those.</li>
    <li> Ive had braces now for almost 3 months. the first month and a half I was all gung-ho for flossing with threaders and floss, maintaining cleanliness daily. After using threaders it got so tiring and tedious, I needed a more efficient way. I gotta say I could not be any happier with this purchase. These make flossing so much easier! I love that it really does fit in between the brackets with no problem, and the flexible pick and the ends adds a nice finishing clean up. I recommend!</li>
    <li> For brace hygiene these are a must!  My daughter uses these with regular brushing.  Easily cleans.  Easy to use.  What a wonderful product!  Much more kid friendly then the floss you have to thread and then put under your brace.  Definitely would recommend this product!</li>
    <li> I highly recommend these product because they will substitute floss while you have braces! I love them because they get the job done!</li>
    <li> Fits within my braces, doesn&#x27;t replace flossing, but great for when you are out and don&#x27;t want to spend the large amount of time regular flossing with braces requires.</li>
    <li> These make flossing a 10 minute job into a 1 minute job! I love these! I&#x27;ve had braces for about 5 months and I dreaded flossing my teeth because it was so tedious. But now with these cool flossers it&#x27;s a breeze!</li>
    <li> I was hoping that these would do the trick ... my children have always used disposable floss spreaders.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sadly, the prongs on these are still too big to fit under my daughters wires. And I agree with the other reviewer that the \\&quot;pick\\&quot; end is too harsh on gums.</li>
    <li> Does the trick, like the scrubby on the other side, but awkward to use when getting between the brackets and doesn&#x27;t fit in the tighter spaces</li>
    <li> Approximately a million times faster than using the floss-needle thing.  I like the bristles on the pick-end, very effective at getting out anything stubborn, though the pick could stand to be a tad stronger.</li>
    <li> I wish they had smaller ones to use with braces on your front teeth.  But these work great! I love the slightly minty taste.</li>
    <li> I wound up with adult braces at the tender age of 30 due to osteoarthritis degenerating bone in my jaw. It has not been pleasant. These floss picks have been a Godsend during my 2 years wearing braces. I was recommended Platypus Ortho flossers and shelled out about 15 dollars for a 25 count of them and they were TERRIBLE!!! They literally broke every single time I tried to floss with them. They were just a waste of money. I came across these at a Walmart and have been hooked since. They are amazing! They never break on me and they go in and out with ease. I would be a mess without them! I have such a hard time threading floss so these work perfectly. No hassles. The price is perfection too. Overall a great product for those out there with orthodontics. LOVE!!</li>
    <li> These are great.  I&#x27;m an adult with braces, and I can&#x27;t stand using the floss threaders.  I couldn&#x27;t find these in any store, but I used a sample my orthodontist provided, and I really liked them.  Considering I couldn&#x27;t find them anywhere else, the price was fair.  I have a few brackets that are spaced closely together, and I can&#x27;t insert these between those teeth, but otherwise I&#x27;m able to floss efficiently and easily.  I just wished they&#x27;d make a reusable version to use with your own floss.</li>
    <li> The picks won&#x27;t get down in between my teeth enough to do the job. I don&#x27;t recommend if you have very tight spaces in between your teeth.</li>
    <li> i think it may depend on each person- like how much space under the wire they have. for me, the picks didnt even fit and when i tried to just use it as a regular floss for my back teeth, it was rough and caused bleeding even though i tried to be gentle as possible. didn&#x27;t work for me, but may work for others?</li>
    <li> Was excited to get this prduct and cant use it. Im new to braces so some of my teeth are still very crooked and space is tight between my teeth and the brace. That heing said i cant use the product to properly floss. Im going to hold onto the however and maybe down the roas ill have better luck in using them. Also the floss itself seems cheap and im scared it will break.</li>
    <li> I keep these in my desk drawer at work.  They work in a pinch when I need to get food out from between my teeth.  The minty flavor is nice.  But I would not use these as my only flosser for the day.  At night I use the glide orthodontic floss which I feel does a much better job of getting up under the gum line.  But I will keep these on hand for post snack quick oral hygiene.</li>
    <li> Horrible for braces.  Doesn&#x27;t fit well inside the braces wire so doesnt get proper flossing done</li>
    <li> I ended up using these myself (and I don&#x27;t have braces) b/c my child with braces cannot get the picks in between her teeth!  So far, only regular floss works for her.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a dental hygienist and use/recommend these to all my ortho patients!  Much easier than floss or super floss and just as effective!</li>
    <li> Fits between under the wire, so much better than struggling to thread normal floss! Would recommend for anyone with dental braces.</li>
    <li> Work great for my 10 year old with braces!</li>
    <li> My teenage son has braces and finds these very helpful for cleaning his teeth. Works even better than the Sonic AirFloss we bought.</li>
    <li> For a child with braces who needs to floss, and can&#x27;t figure out the complicated needle-and-thread technique recommended by the orthodontist for flossing, these are awesome. One drawback is that for some of the teeth, the green plastic is slightly too thick to fit between the teeth and the braces wire. We&#x27;ve discovered that for those areas, the floss can just be pressed down from above (similar to how you would use dental floss if you didn&#x27;t have any braces), and if you angle the device towards the inside of the mouth, you can still floss relatively well. The floss string between the two green arms is loose enough (e.g. not too taught) that even if it pushes against the braces wire, it doesn&#x27;t hurt the wire. Anyway, it makes flossing take 20 seconds, instead of up to 10 minutes. (Shhh, don&#x27;t tell the dentist, but you could even re-use them a couple times before throwing them out if you want, so they last longer).</li>
    <li> I have the regular archwire and bracket set up and these floss picks do fit through between wire and my teeth. They work pretty well for a once over for flossing and when you&#x27;re away from home, but I don&#x27;t think they are a 100% replacement for floss. I recommend still taking the time to use superfloss or floss threaders because the picks don&#x27;t let you really wrap around the base of your tooth and get into your gumline the same way that regular floss does.</li>
    <li> My son  has tried many different brands but this is the best.</li>
    <li> These are a little flimsy, and they bend, making it a little more difficult to use. But, they fit under my braces, so they get the job done. The freebie ones from the Orthodontist were better though, but I can&#x27;t find them to buy them.  These are great for the price, however.</li>
    <li> These are great for braces.  Wish I would have known about these when my kids had braces as they probably would have taken better care of their teeth.  As a middle aged person who had to have braces for TMJ pain, these are a lifesaver.  I had bought all kinds of threaders and flossers and they were just so time consuming and I found myself slacking and not using them.  These are as fast as flossing without braces!</li>
    <li> Not good quality. Break easy and stretch.</li>
    <li> My son has braces, so I purchased these to help with his flossing. They didn&#x27;t work. They didn&#x27;t fit behind the wire of his braces.</li>
    <li> I have been looking for a more economical option to the Platypus Orthodontic Flosser. I found Dentek Floss Picks Braces as an Add on item here on Amazon. I could not be happier.&lt;br /&gt;Like the platypus it can reach under the wires easily, allowing me to floss in a jiffy. Its prongs are a bit more thicker and rounded compared to the Platypus. I wonder if that may be a problem for some people if the wire is more flush to the teeth.&lt;br /&gt;As stated by other reviewers the bristle end is rather flimsy and of not much use. But for the price it is a good alternative to the Platypus.</li>
    <li> I DO NOT LOVE IT. THESE ARE FLORIDE LACED. ALL DENTAL PICKS ARE, AS I&#x27;VE DISCOVERED. FLORIDE IS POISON, PERIOD. ITS PROVEN TO DECAY TEETH. CALCIFY GLANDS, CAUSE RETARDATION AND IS BLATANTLY PUT OUT TO POISON THE PUBLIC.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I RATED 5 STARS SO HOPEFULLY PEOPLE CAN SEE THIS AND BECOME AWARE. NO WERE ON THE PACKAGE DOES IT INCLUDE INGREDIENTS, SO UNLESS YOU SPOTTED WHILE SHOPPING, YOUR LOVED ONES WILL BE POISONED. BAN ALL FLORIDE, DON&#x27;T BUY THIS PRODUCT.</li>
    <li> These work really well. I&#x27;ve never tried any other braces flossers so I can&#x27;t really compare it to anything else but I&#x27;m very happy with it. They are extremely easy to use and get under and in between my braces without any problems. Sure beats having to thread. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> These are the best flossers for braces I&#x27;ve used. The threads stay strong even when caught on metal brackets and they fit nicely even in the tightest spots. I had really crowded teeth so the brackets were super close together. This was the floss that would fit, aside form the painstaking process of using the threading floss. This is the next best thing to the Waterpik. Great for travel or going out to eat, too!</li>
    <li> Our orthodontist recommended these and they work great with braces. My daughter had trouble flossing&lt;br /&gt;until we discovered these. She finds them easy to use.</li>
    <li> I am used to using the flossers with the puff on them ( which I love). I think it&#x27;s Oral B. But, I needed something I could take with me. So, I got these white flossers, for braces, at Walmart. They worked fine although they didn&#x27;t fit in between some of my brackets. So, I ordered these and they worked much better. Fit better and just more convient.</li>
    <li> I bought these because I have braces and flossing nearly takes a half hour to 45 mins to do it effectively. I&#x27;ve tried super floss &amp; regular floss picks but the super floss still took a while and regular floss picks are too big. I got these, hesitent that they wouldnt fit, but they fit perfectly behind my wire. I&#x27;ve cut my flossing time down a considerable amount. Its quick and easy, the floss doesnt shred and I can gloss so much easier. It is mint flavor however, although I&#x27;d perfer no flavor, it isnt that bad! :)</li>
    <li> We tried a few of these flossers for braces.  These work very well.  Fit well and make it much easier and less time consuming to floss.  We&#x27;ll be buying more of these.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t fit between all brackets. I suggest getting a Waterpik if you have braces.</li>
    <li> Work well but now very expensive</li>
    <li> The floss doesn&#x27;t have enough tension to go down between my teeth! The sides of the flossers just bend inwards giving the floss no leverage whatsoever. My teeth are pretty tight, so take that in stride.</li>
</ol>
