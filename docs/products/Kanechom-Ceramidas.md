      <li>Being natural has been a journey for me and using this product has made conditioning for me much easier and have given me better results.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Love it!.. I use after I wash my hair and it keeps my hair moisturized even days after, but I also air dried my hair so I&#x27;m guessing that&#x27;s why my hair has been like this for almost reaching a week. Cheers</li>
    <li> Love, love, love.  I have been using Kanechom productsfor a year now and it is the only conditioner besides Wen that I will ever use again.</li>
    <li> Decent conditioner but my hair is very dry so i still needed to follow up with another moisturizing conditioner.</li>
    <li> This is amazing mixed with silicon mix. It makes my hair shiny and bouncy and very moisturized. This will always be one of my staples !!!!!</li>
    <li> Just washed my hair with this and the whole Silicon Mix line. My hair feels very soft and my strands feel smooth. I have transitioning hair and this made my new growth manageable. Plus my hair smells so good. BTW the packaging i got is different from the picture i don&#x27;t know why.</li>
    <li> I really did not like this product. I could have gotten the same results from a local retailer, much cheaper.</li>
    <li> Wonderful, Wonderful, Wonderful, juist try these products for yourself and you will be talking like me baby.  I will always buy these forever ever.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing. I&#x27;m two years natural and this stuff makes your hair super,super soft. It&#x27;s a must have for me.</li>
    <li> I decided to try this product because of the great reviews I have heard of this product, so bought and then tried and I really like this product, but the price I didn&#x27;t really care for. I was told by my mother she had seen a women with the same conditioner and the price tag was much less. I went to a beauty supply here where I live and decided to see the price and it was only 5.99. I was mad. So it may be best to search out for the conditioner in person in beauty supplies. I live in the Bronx it&#x27;s better you by in person. I paid 12$ but with s&amp;h it was 19$. So you make the choice!</li>
    <li> I never used any of the kanechom treatments before. i saw a you tube review about the kanechom karite and thought, maybe i should try it. The Kanechom Ceramidas Hair Moisturizing cream is too good to be true. Not only does it smells wonderful, it made my hair feel sooo silky and soft to the touch. I could not believe it was my hair. It totally changed the texture of my hair after just one use. My hair was dry and breaking. It was rough to the touch. this product is great if your hair is corse and damaged by hair coloring, flat iron, and blow drying. Brazil knows how to make fantastic treatments. I only wish the entire line is available on Amazon. This product is so great, i would purchase every type of kanechom  and stock it up. Kanechom sells out fast and is hard to get. If its available on Amazon purchase it immediately. Its a tresure.</li>
    <li> Love this product, keeps my curly hair soft and manageable.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this and will be ordering more. I use this mixed with coconut oil for deep conditioner. It&#x27;s a great product.</li>
    <li> i LOVE this companies hair product line. I wil not use anything else on my hair. My hair dresser wants me to get a Brazilian blow-out but NOPE! this product does the trick!!</li>
    <li> It was just okay. I didn&#x27;t notice any real difference in the condition of my hair. I purchased this formula and the Kanechom Ultimate Aloe formula and like the consistency of the Aloe formula better between the two. I tried adding this to Silicon Mix and really was not impressed, as Silicon Mix contains mineral oil and I don&#x27;t wan&#x27;t mineral oil coating my hair during conditioning. I have curly hair and it needs moisture, not mineral oil. I continue to use it sans any other additives and I just don&#x27;t see what all the hype is about, as it is good but not great. If I catch this on sale, I will order again but I&#x27;m not likely to buy it again without the benefit of a sale. I will try another Kanechom formula to see if a different formula will suit me better.</li>
    <li> I ama  relaxed chica and I purchased this due to the reviews I was up in the air ordering this one or the Shea Butter but I ended up getting this and the silicon mix bamboo (due to you tube reviews) it tangles my hair. The smell is good though ..maybe it will work for some others but it didn&#x27;t mesh well with my hair. I just ordered the Shea Butter so we shall see if it lives up to it&#x27;s hype.</li>
    <li> Love it on my natural hair. Thin in texture and smells great. Makes it easier to manage and softens hair. Works well with silicon mix bambu..Will definitely purchase again</li>
    <li> Great product, smells great</li>
    <li> Smells nice and subtle, feels like silk upon applying. Fully worth the price, I will never go back to local supermarket products! My hair is fuller and no poof or frizz after just one use. Couldn&#x27;t tell you if it helped with shine cus that has never been an issue with my hair</li>
    <li> hello!  I am african american and my hair type is 4b, I kind of was having some issues with my hair breaking! I bought this product and it really stop my hair from breakage plus strengthing my weak hair to strong! very amazing...but they need to do better on shipping cause when I received my item it was sealed but was busted at the bottom to where the product leaked out and I lost some of this product, This is very expensive to lose alot of product that I paid for but it works!</li>
    <li> I jumped on the dominican conditioner bandwagon after watching a few youtube videos RAVING about this brand. I have shoulder length natural curly hair and I used the entire container of this stuff without any noticeable difference. In other words, the results were not post worthy. I probably wouldn&#x27;t buy this particular product but I may explore some of the other products under this brand.</li>
    <li> I mixed this with silicon and it left my hair hard and dry. So, this may or may not work for you, but I will stick to what I usually use!</li>
    <li> One of my favorite conditioners!  Just the amount of ceramides that I need for my hair.</li>
    <li> I ordered three of the Kanechom products, This one ranks #3, but still amazing. Smells amazing! My hair loves the Kanechom line</li>
    <li> It definitely lives up to its expectation my hair is stronger, healthier softer its awesome</li>
    <li> I have relaxed hair and have been searching for a good conditioner which would provide a lot of slip while detangling my hair. .  Well I finally found it, this is one of the best conditioners I have ever used. I was able to detangle my hair in half the time it usually takes me and it left my hair soft and moisturized.  I plan to purchase other conditioners in this line to see if I will get the same results</li>
    <li> This product is what I was looking for. I had really soft hair, but it was weak-so hair would break easily from the root or where ever when I combed it. This products did not make my hair feel soft when I applied it. It  felt dry but it made my hair strong and it looked healthy too. My hair was really dry too, so when you use this with the Fantasia straightening- serum, my hair looks wonderful.</li>
    <li> I just expected a little more from these conditioners. I do like them...I just have to mix them with other products. I would&#x27;ve given it a 3 1/2 stars at least but I can&#x27;t so...yeah</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product! And no none of us were hired to give positive feedback lol! this product is amazing! Makes your hair soft just using it by itself and if you decide to mix it with silicon mix.. that is just an extra bonus. This is a great moisturizing conditioner. I am in the currently stretching my relaxer to help strengthen my hair. **A word of advice for most customers...there is no such thing as a miracle product...but you will see great results from good products when you take the time to know WHAT YOUR HAIR NEEDS..** For example...Too many moisturizing treatments on a consistent basis will cause breakage..just as too many protein treatments on consistent basis will cause breakage.. So before you purchase any products, know what your hair needs otherwise you are causing more harm than good... Very good product, speedy delivery, clean and sealed tight package. I will definitely continue to patronized this vendor..</li>
    <li> I have very fuzzy and weak hair and have tried many hair treatments. This one is truly amazing and the only one worked for me. I will try this brand again.</li>
    <li> The item came to me wasted and all over the box. I had to clean it up.  I was luck to get 1 third of it to use.</li>
    <li> this product lives up to the hype. It moisturized my parched overprocessed hair and brought it back to life. I am absoloutely in love with the results.&lt;br /&gt;I have to comment on the smell however. it is too strong and too sweet.&lt;br /&gt;I struggled to leave this product on my hair for the allotted time, the smell was so powerful. But I am glad I kept it in. I use it as a deep conditioner and it really delivers despite the smell.</li>
    <li> Shipping was fast and product as described. I used this product twice and I can feel the difference in my hair it is a lot softer after I use this conditioner. Being natural has been a journey for me and using this product has made conditioning for me much easier and have given me better results. I love how it makes it easier for me to detangle my hair.</li>
    <li> this is like a protein treatment without the drama. it made my hair very strong ! no breakage and believe me when i say the ends of my hair are damaged! and the seller is excellent. received my package today even though the earliest delivery time is tomorrow and i also received a free gift :). love this product!</li>
    <li> I recently purchased this conditioner from an independent distributor in Atlanta. I wanted to order it from Amazon because it is where I bought the Kanechom Karite Butter conditioner back in August but wanted to get the entire set. I have natural 3B/4A hair and I take very good care of my hair. I was reading an article somewhere about cuticles being lifted on the hair strand and did the test in my hair. When I ran my fingers up the shaft of my hair, I felt that it wasn&#x27;t smooth and had some bumps along the way. I did my research and saw that the Ceramidas was best for dealing with this product. I ordered the shampoo, conditioner, leave in and the hair cream. Also received a small bottle of this keratin serum as a gift. I will say the smell is kind of strong. It reminds me of fabric softener but apparently that is how it is supposed to smell. I used it and immediately felt a difference in my hair. I still have some bumps along the hair shaft but the smoothness and silkiness of my hair overall is great. I want to try some more of their line because so far I am 2 for 2. Until then I shall rotate them out. I&#x27;ll try and post an update in a month or so.</li>
    <li> Works wonders with silicon mix but can be used alone. The scent is very soothing! Leaves hair feeling soft and manageable.</li>
    <li> I mix this with the silicone and I am in HAIR HEAVEN!  what a great conditioner!! all the tangles fall out! I use it on my wigs/weaves and my real hair.</li>
    <li> My favorite one out of the bunch...... but only mixed with Silicon Mix.</li>
    <li> Mixed this with the silicon mix conditioner (3 parts this, 1 part silicon) and left it in for about 5 minutes and my hair felt like i was in the salon. love it.</li>
    <li> seems to work better when mixed or combined with other products.  works fine on its own.  isnt miraculous but is a nice conditioner.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product it&#x27;s a tie with my Silicon Mix. I mix it with Kanechom Goat&#x27;s milk one and leave on as long as I can then rinse out. I get complimented often on my hair which is curly and frizzy without this. That&#x27;s me with the glasses in pic. It makes my hair SHINE!</li>
    <li> This one is my FAV is kept my hair so soft ,silky, and bouncy until my next hair wash, I&#x27;m so glad I choose this one.</li>
    <li> RICH AND CREAMY LEAVES HAIR SMOOTH</li>
    <li> I ordered this for my daughter&#x27;s hair which is on the dry side. I don&#x27;t see that this product made any difference.  I will use 2 or 3 more times in order to see if there is a difference.  Time will tell and my fingers are crossed.</li>
    <li> Bought for my mom but she loves it. She shady requested more. She says it makes her hair really soft &amp; smells good.</li>
    <li> this is a wonderful product! i have recently colored my hair and damaged it severly! i could never get my hair feeling, smelling and styled like the salon... this product delivers! my hair is soft, smells great and with a simple blow out, i got my salon styled hair.</li>
    <li> I heard so much about Kanechom. I have thick, curly, bushy caucasian  hair and products geared toward African American hair usually work well for me. This seems to strip and dry my hair a bit. It doesn&#x27;t seem very moisturizing at all. I do think it makes an excellent cowash because it is slightly stripping. I will try another variety though before giving up on the brand.</li>
    <li> I will never be without kanechom. Its perfect for bringing back softness, body and tame frizzies on human and synthetic wigs and weaves.</li>
    <li> I heard so many good things about it and I love this stuff very moisturizing and makes my hair soft.</li>
    <li> I love this product makes my hair silky smooth. Especially when used as a prepoo &amp; cowash.. I definitely recommend it!</li>
    <li> This is the only deep conditioner I use, any other of flavors. Last time I got the Shea Butter, it was awesome too! This one, the Ceramidas, I think I like better. Excellent for detangling in the shower, ultimate slip. Haven&#x27;t found a better product yet!</li>
    <li> Hi I order this product cuz I put my hair throughout lots of flat irons heat and bleaching I try lots of products my hair was horrible couldn&#x27;t style it anymore so I decide to try it looooove it shiny can&#x27;t seem split ends soft healthy looking  plus amazon did a really good job on a 2 day free shipping  thanks ☺️😘 love to try some other products from this brand 👏👍</li>
    <li> I am relaxed with fine hair and was looking for something to give my hair that &amp;#34;Salon&amp;#34; look. Saw some reviews for this on Youtube and it looked to be a great product so I purchased it along with the Silicon Mix and used them both together. I do love the smell of the Kanechom and for me it lingers for days. After rinsing the product out and blow drying and flat ironing the results were amazing. My hair had bounce, shine, and body and that &amp;#34;salon&amp;#34; look but the next day it felt dry. Which could be due to the fact that I didn&#x27;t deep condition with a good moisturizing conditioner beforehand. I&#x27;d use it again but definitely have to make sure the moisture is there first.</li>
    <li> Love...mixed with silicone mix... on my natural hair as a deep condition works wonders to make my curls more managable</li>
    <li> So far excellent product.</li>
    <li> I am beyond pleased with this product!!!! I have coarse and hard to detangle hair and after applying this with silicon mix bambu and sitting under a jooded dryer for 20 minutes my hair was like butter. My comb glided through my hair and I was able to do a 20 minute detangling job in 5 minutes! I don&#x27;t usually write reviews but the salon quality results I achieved with this product mixed with the silicon bambu are unbelievable. I would definitely recommend this to anyone and especially if you have coarse hair.</li>
