    <li> I originally started to use this product as I noticed my hair thinning out it has been over 15 years I still have predominantly a full head of hair and received numerous compliments if I did not use this product the males in my family have suffered from male pattern baldness my hair speaks for itself use it or lose it!!!!!</li>
    <li> Very inexpensive, great product!</li>
    <li> Arrived on time but I got very bad reaction after 3 days of use on my scalp, forehead, neck don&#x27;t use this product</li>
    <li> I am not the direct user, but it seems that the user liked it.</li>
    <li> Like the new box design. Let&#x27;s see if everything else improved.</li>
    <li> Just as good as Rogaine at the fraction of the price. I prefer the liquid and Rogaine stopped making it!!! I don&#x27;t like the foam!!!</li>
    <li> I was starting to see my hair recede slightly in the past year or two.  I had some reservations after ready some of the reviews; however, I know it works in some people so I decided to give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since my hair is only receding along the right and left side of my Widow&#x27;s peak, I only applied it to those regions.  After just 2 weeks I begin to see small hair begin to populate.  By four weeks, I noticed more hair along my receding hairline coming back.  Now, it has been two months and I&#x27;m starting to see growth of hair along both sides very noticeably.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t experience the itch or dander personally.  So I have been quite pleased.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This package comes with two boxes for a total of 6 months.  There is a medicine dropper that allows easy application.  There is no odor or perfume in the solution.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you can catch your hair receding early, I think it will help you best.  I cannot attest for the benefit when hair has been absent for some period of time.  I will presume hair will go away if the product is not continued.</li>
    <li> This product is very useful for me,fast delivery</li>
    <li> I use it on my face because I&#x27;m 30 and can only grow patches of a beard. I&#x27;ve been using it for three weeks or so and I&#x27;m beginning to get hair on my face where I never had it. It works slowly, but it works.</li>
    <li> good product with exp 04/16&lt;br /&gt;minoxidil bottles are plastic</li>
    <li> Great product! Unbeatable Price!</li>
    <li> Quick delivery and great product!</li>
    <li> it says in the brochure that it takes 2 months for minoxidil to work. It also says it does not work on receding hairline. I have been using for a month on my receding hairline and the results are very apparent. I am extremely satisfied.</li>
    <li> Still not bald!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rogaine is more effective in big amounts, so just use all of it at night so it gets maximum effect. Twice a day is not needed really, one big treatment  at night is the best.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Be sure to use dandruff shampoo.</li>
    <li> I have used this now for about 3 weeks. I can already start seeing hair coming in. Good product so far.</li>
    <li> thank u 4 fast delivery &amp; good item</li>
    <li> Product is effective over time.</li>
    <li> You use this by squirting this into your hair twice a day.  It is some type of an oily type product, and after 60 days of use so far I cannot tell you yes or no whether this is even working or not.  At least so far it has not hurt, but I am sorry to say has not truly helped yet either that I can tell.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Rogaine and now Minoxidil for a number of years.  And while it might be better than not using it, I can&#x27;t say that I have a lot of extra hair.  I still have the male pattern hole in my hair.  I&#x27;m afraid to stop because I was told that any hair this chemical produces will immediately fall out when you stop using it.  So.....  better than nothing.</li>
    <li> Hair fall stopped and got some re growth around the crown as per labelling - great product for the price</li>
