      <li>This product is amazing!</li>
      <li>Any of three methods  are good for helping to moisturize your hair.</li>

      <li>Beautiful smooth wrap results for me.</li>
      <li>Thanks to this for keeping my stubborn hair beautiful!!!</li>
      <li>I bought this conditioner for my great grandaughter who has super curly hair.  </li>
      <li>Their hair never ever breaks and is very strong.</li>
      <li>I always try to get some heat to it, because it penetrates better</li>
      <li>My hair has never looked better since my nightmare of damaged and nappy hair began about 6 months ago.  </li>
      <li>I love this conditioner.  </li>
      <li>I love the way it makes my hair feel and</li>
      <li>and if that works I am sold for life..unless they begin to change the ingredients like most companies do.</li>
      <li>and I do not have 45 minutes to spare :)</li>
      <li>I usually deep condition my hair every 2 weeks and this product is excellent!</li>
      <li>Especially good in the winter months when your hair needs extra moisture.</li>
      <li>I love the way it makes my hair shine,as well as it has begun to help improve my hairs damage.  </li>
      <li>and omg the best was literally saved for last!</li>
      <li>Can you tell I love this?  </li>
      <li>and this helps keep my hair super healthy!</li>
      <li>The BEST deep conditioner for my fine, frizzy, curly, color-treated hair.</li>
      <li>Now my hair is healthy, shiny and strong and I use it every 2 weeks, sometimes once a month.</li>
      <li>Good quality, fast shipping.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s way to full recovery!</li>
      <li>this product doesn&#x27;t wash out easily...</li>
      <li>I will say when I washed it out my hair felt moisturized and was easy to detangle.  </li>
      <li>so if you have fine hair DO NOT GET IT,</li>
      <li>This is such a great deal, you can get about three conditions from one pack and it leaves your hair silky smooth.</li>
      <li>so I try to do a light treatment every two weeks; this has improved my hairs condition dramatically.</li>
      <li>I was hesitant to try this; but I knew olive oil has fantastic properties for skin</li>
      <li>This product is fantastic.</li>
      <li>It restored the shine back to my hair, it greatly reduced the breakage, and my hair no longer falls out in clumps.</li>
      <li>IT was cheap</li>
      <li>I would have to say this is the best yet because none of those I previously listed have done my hair like this!</li>
      <li>I wasnt sure how often I could use it, but now see from the other reviews it is ok to use more than once a week</li>
      <li>i think im due to buy another one of these lol.</li>
      <li>I have pretty fine hair</li>
      <li>Despite having &#x27;cones in it this is the best deep conditioner/light protein I&#x27;ve used outside of the Morrocan Oil line.</li>
      <li>After I rinse I do a quick run thru of Honey</li>
      <li>We used it after swimming in the pool and baking in the sun and our hair -- was very manageable and strong after washing and using this product.  </li>
      <li>Easy to style and very shiny too.  </li>
      <li>After wrapping my hair and going to bed the next morning it didn&#x27;t feel as oily, just looked shiny and healthy!</li>
      <li>Bought this on a whim at Walgreens, and was AMAZED at the results just from the first use!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s certainly worth a try since it&#x27;s inexpensive.</li>
      <li>I am a natural, not too sure of my curl pattern</li>
      <li>It makes my hair soft, silky, and more manageable.</li>
      <li>The fresh orange smell is the only thing I liked about the conditioner.  </li>
      <li>luckily I was going for the bone straight look?!</li>
      <li>When I first started using this my hair was very damaged and after one use it made a huge difference.</li>
      <li>This product worked much better for me than Aveda&#x27;s $60 deep conditining masque, and smelled and worked better than NouNou&#x27;s olive-oil based $25 hair mask--though those are both fine products, they just didn&#x27;t offer that deep, nourishing treatment my hair needed after coloring.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried a variety of products and nothing worked -- the various leave-in creams would just cream her hair but not make it more manageable or reduce frizz.  </li>
      <li>I cannot believe how much money I saved on Amazon literally 12 for the price of three!</li>
      <li>The Replenishing pak is probably my second favorite product for styling my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>so maybe it works better for coarse hair</li>
      <li>a good deal.i was expecting my hair to go from dry and frizzy to wow and silky like the reviews</li>
      <li>how many times i washed it and it made my hair so flat and sticky</li>
      <li>The various serums were fine but had to be reapplied a lot.  </li>
      <li>I need a much heavier reconstructer when I use heat</li>
      <li>I grabbed this pak, but didn&#x27;t think too much of it.</li>
      <li>I googled searchess on products that can help restore my hair and I tried a couple that I found, but they didn&#x27;t really make a difference.</li>
      <li>I love to use it post relaxer, to keep strands moisturized and streangthened and pre relaxer, when my new growth feels dry and unruly when I try to style.  </li>
      <li>I have tried so many other options for dry hair and this one is perfect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would not recommend this for someone with fine hair or oily hair.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m Strong conditioner and my hair has its natural curl and softness back.  </li>
      <li>Applied the full pak, combed it through and left it on for an hour (per instructions if you do not want to use a plastic cap and hair dryer).  </li>
      <li>I put the entire contents of one package on freshly washed hair, wrapped it up in a towel and let is sit for 1 hour, then rinsed.&lt;br /&gt;The best part is, you can pick up an individual packet at the local pharmacy for around $1.75, and give it a try before committing to buying a larger quantity, something that I wish other salon products would offer, as they can get quite pricey.</li>
      <li>After washing out the replenishing pak, my hair is very soft to touch and this helps when styling my hair as I don&#x27;t have to use much oil or butter for moisture.</li>
      <li>Highly recommended.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this product to anyone looking to improve their damged hair and get immediate results on its conditioning.  </li>
      <li>But normally I wouldn&#x27;t like it.</li>
      <li>I washed and conditioned and detangeled as normal then used this product.</li>
      <li>We recently used it for her hair when we were traveling recently because the packets would be easy for airport security.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;P.S For those with super dry hair, Google coconut oil for hair.</li>
      <li>My hair felt very soft.</li>
      <li>My hair tends to like new products with first time use, but afterwards, tends not to have the same effect.  </li>
      <li>: i have slightly curly hair and my hair is fine.</li>
      <li>I purchased this from CVS and used it for the first time last night.  </li>
      <li>so many times.my hair is still sticky and hard to comb</li>
      <li>i couldn&#x27;t get it completely off my hair for 3 days no matter</li>
      <li>OMG!!!&lt;br /&gt;I decided to relax my hair since my natural roots were making my hair unmanageable.</li>
      <li>I have tried garnier, dove, Mizani, Pantene Relaxed and Natural,</li>
      <li>Leave the hair so soft like silk, and gives life to the hair.</li>
      <li>After 3-4 washes my hair is back to normal, except so soft and silky!</li>
      <li>it left my hair frizzy and super dry.   </li>
      <li>The next morning I rinsed my hair, towel dried and it was full again!  </li>
      <li>however, its mixed between waves at the top and the back is tight curls, but I have no relaxer whatsoever in my hair and it left my hair so soft when I wore my natural curls.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> So I bought this bc of a review I seen on YouTube from other African American girls that have natural hair like myself and they raved about it. I felt it made my hair a little too oily after use. I washed and conditioned and detangeled as normal then used this product. Once I blow dried and flat iron my hair appeared super shiny but almost limp and heavy. It wasn&#x27;t too bad only bc luckily I was going for the bone straight look?! But normally I wouldn&#x27;t like it. After wrapping my hair and going to bed the next morning it didn&#x27;t feel as oily, just looked shiny and healthy! Not sure  I will use this again but I&#x27;m trying to find an alternative to the super dumb expensive Miss Jessie&#x27;s Rapid Recovery Conditioner... UGH!!!   ANY SUGGESTIONS????</li>
    <li> I love this conditioner.  I first read about it on Black Girl Long Hair. I wash my hair then massage the OR in then baggy my hair for about 30-45 mins. After I rinse I do a quick run thru of Honey I&#x27;m Strong conditioner and my hair has its natural curl and softness back.  I absolutely LOVE it!!!</li>
    <li> As another reviewer stated, this conditioner was very difficult for me to wash out.  As a matter of fact, after four vigorous shampoos, it&#x27;s still in my hair.  I have very thick but easily managed hair and this has never happened with any other product.  The fresh orange smell is the only thing I liked about the conditioner.  It did soften my hair but it didn&#x27;t detangle it.  I don&#x27;t want this to come across as negative so I&#x27;ll end by saying every product is not for every person.  And based on other reviews, it is a miracle product for others.</li>
    <li> this product doesn&#x27;t wash out easily...i couldn&#x27;t get it completely off my hair for 3 days no matter how many times i washed it and it made my hair so flat and sticky and i couldn&#x27;t brush my hair without ripping a bunch of my hair out.  and now that it&#x27;s gone it left my hair frizzy and super dry.   i&#x27;m throwing away the rest of the packs...    for the record: i have slightly curly hair and my hair is fine.</li>
    <li> This is such a great deal, you can get about three conditions from one pack and it leaves your hair silky smooth.</li>
    <li> I was hesitant to try this; but I knew olive oil has fantastic properties for skin so I tried it.  Whoo - beautiful hair.  I wear my hair very short &amp; spikey as well as color it; I like it to look shiny when styled.   I washed my hair a couple times towel dried my hair.  Applied the full pak, combed it through and left it on for an hour (per instructions if you do not want to use a plastic cap and hair dryer).  When I rinsed the product out, towel dried my hair and Whoa!  The fullest my hair has ever been (I have thick hair).  Easy to style and very shiny too.  The next morning I rinsed my hair, towel dried and it was full again!  Very nice scent too.  I keep 8 packets of this conditioner at all times.  When my grandchildren swim a lot in summer I put this on their hair.  Also, as the name says it is a \\&quot;root\\&quot; stimulator which means my hair no longer sheds.  My scalp is cleaner than with regulator conditioners.  Can you tell I love this?  LOL</li>
    <li> I am a girl that loves to color, flat iron and do tons of damaging things to my hair. I have had every color in the rainbow dyed into my hair. That said, my hair was fried and falling out. I found this magic elixar in a walgreens and figured what the hell ill try it.Omg! My hair has never been healthier. It restored the shine back to my hair, it greatly reduced the breakage, and my hair no longer falls out in clumps. I Love This Stuff!!!</li>
    <li> I purchased this from CVS and used it for the first time last night.  I will say when I washed it out my hair felt moisturized and was easy to detangle.  I have pretty thick hair and was looking for a weekly DC that can keep my hair moisturized.  After my hair was dry from sitting under the dryer, I noticed my hair was shinier than usual (but it could be because I also did a hair rinse too).  Definitely will have to see how it does when I use it again next week.  My hair tends to like new products with first time use, but afterwards, tends not to have the same effect.  But for 1.86 from CVS, its definitely a good deal.</li>
    <li> I cannot believe how much money I saved on Amazon literally 12 for the price of three! My hair is very long, curly ringlets with relaxed roots and color treated.N as my hair has grown longer keeping it manageable has been much harder to do. I use two packets as an instant conditioner, let it sit for 20 minutes and rinse. I need a much heavier reconstructer when I use heat so i use K Pak by Joico.</li>
    <li> I started using this 2 years ago. I used every single &amp;#34;pack&amp;#34; that Sally&#x27;s has to offer and tried this one last and omg the best was literally saved for last! I like other brands too like Curl Junkie and Mixd Chicks but this one is better and way cheaper! When I first started using this my hair was very damaged and after one use it made a huge difference. Now my hair is healthy, shiny and strong and I use it every 2 weeks, sometimes once a month. This product is amazing! I have yet to try their other products only because I am satisfied with the other things I use. I straighten my hair every other wash (I rotate between straight and my natural curly hair) and this helps keep my hair super healthy! BTW, my hair type is 3A/medium porosity/thick/coarse hair. Thanks to this for keeping my stubborn hair beautiful!!!</li>
    <li> One of the best hair products I have ever bought. In addition to having changed the thread of my hair has done that I grow tr</li>
    <li> I have tried garnier, dove, Mizani, Pantene Relaxed and Natural, SoftSheen Carson, Cantu...you name it. I would have to say this is the best yet because none of those I previously listed have done my hair like this! My hair looks as if I just left the salon! Highly recommended. I am a natural, not too sure of my curl pattern however, its mixed between waves at the top and the back is tight curls, but I have no relaxer whatsoever in my hair and it left my hair so soft when I wore my natural curls. Then when I flat ironed it....lets just say I have found my conditioner. I&#x27;m never one to use an entire product line but so far I have used edge control and this replenishing pack and I have not been disappointed, I will have to try the moisturizer next and if that works I am sold for life..unless they begin to change the ingredients like most companies do.</li>
    <li> I have always been obsessed with my hair and its condition.  I have had relaxers and straighteners done for years and my hair has never suffered any damage until now.  My hair salon suggested every product they had and I spent a small fortune trying to repair my damaged hair and restore it to some sort of state I could at least live with until it improved and then I tried this product.  Hundreds of dollars later, and for a minimal price I discovered Organic Root Stimulator and I will never go back.  I love the way it makes my hair shine,as well as it has begun to help improve my hairs damage.  I wasnt sure how often I could use it, but now see from the other reviews it is ok to use more than once a week and I definitely intend to.  My hair has never looked better since my nightmare of damaged and nappy hair began about 6 months ago.  I highly recommend this product to anyone looking to improve their damged hair and get immediate results on its conditioning.  It also smells great too!</li>
    <li> This is one of the best conditioners out there. I love to use it post relaxer, to keep strands moisturized and streangthened and pre relaxer, when my new growth feels dry and unruly when I try to style.  I always try to get some heat to it, because it penetrates better and I do not have 45 minutes to spare :) I can generally get 2-3 applications from one packet for my chin length hair.</li>
    <li> hi&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i bought this only because it was on for a dollar at kroger  and after reading the reviews i thought wow i got a good deal.i was expecting my hair to go from dry and frizzy to wow and silky like the reviews said.but as i just saw one other reviewer saying it is hard to wash out from hair then i realised that i had the same problem and that i shud write a review about it.as it said i washed and conditoned my hair and then applied this and left in on for an hour without cap.but afterwards it never came out of my hair.i washed my hair so many times.my hair is still sticky and hard to comb</li>
    <li> ORS Replenishing Pak has worked wonders for my dry, relaxed, brittle hair. My hair loves protein so I try to do a light treatment every two weeks; this has improved my hairs condition dramatically. Despite having &#x27;cones in it this is the best deep conditioner/light protein I&#x27;ve used outside of the Morrocan Oil line. Yeah. I said it. The only way it doesn&#x27;t rinse out of your hair is if your hair is weighed down with product (oils, sprays etc). A clarifying wash (twice if necessary) MUST be done prior to any protein/deep conditioning treatment.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried a number of deep conditioners by the various natural hair care companies. None of them work for my 4a-4b hair like the replenishing pak does. I&#x27;m shocked this hasn&#x27;t received more reviews. Maybe people shy away from it because it has a cone or two.  The Replenishing pak is probably my second favorite product for styling my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used this with a hooded dryer, heated towel wrap, and overnight with two plastic bags wrapped around my head. Any of three methods  are good for helping to moisturize your hair. After washing out the replenishing pak, my hair is very soft to touch and this helps when styling my hair as I don&#x27;t have to use much oil or butter for moisture.</li>
    <li> I tried this product twice and each time I was left with a horrible build-up on my hair. My hair was sticky and hard feeling. I suggest rinsing it out sooner rather than keeping it on for an hour. I had to shampoo my hair to remove the product. It was a very unpleasant experience.</li>
    <li> OMG!!!&lt;br /&gt;I decided to relax my hair since my natural roots were making my hair unmanageable. I grabbed this pak, but didn&#x27;t think too much of it. I put the relaxer in, then put put in this product for an hour or so. I rinse it out, wrap my hair, and let it dry overnight. The next day my hair was so bouncy and shiny!! I didn&#x27;t not use the leave in from the perm, so I know it was this product!! Everyone should try this at least once!!! It is now day two, the bounce and shine is still here! BTW, I have thin, fine AA hair, no problems rinsing it out.</li>
    <li> Let me start by saying the only reason there are 1 or 2 star reviews on this product is because the people using it have white/fine hair. THIS IS FOR ETHNIC AND/OR COARSE HAIR. That being said, if you do in fact have the type of hair this product was designed for, it&#x27;s wonderful. Use it once or twice a week as a deep conditioner whether you have natural or relaxed hair and you&#x27;ll see a definite improvement in your hair.</li>
    <li> I have \\&quot;regular\\&quot; African American hair and my daughter is half Native American.  She&#x27;s truly got an even mix of both me and her father, physically.  Their hair never ever breaks and is very strong. But her hair waves at 1 inch intervals when let to air dry and will frizz when brushed through once dry.  When she was in primary grades we could just brush in olive oil when the hair was wet, but that stopped working so well for the past few years. I&#x27;ve tried a variety of products and nothing worked -- the various leave-in creams would just cream her hair but not make it more manageable or reduce frizz.  The various serums were fine but had to be reapplied a lot.  This product has always worked well for me after washing. We recently used it for her hair when we were traveling recently because the packets would be easy for airport security.  We used it after swimming in the pool and baking in the sun and our hair -- was very manageable and strong after washing and using this product.  I combed it through my hair and put on a shower cap for 20 minutes and rinsed it out.  We combed it through her hair and rinsed it our within minutes.  Beautiful waves for her.  Beautiful smooth wrap results for me. No residue.</li>
    <li> This product is fantastic. Leave the hair so soft like silk, and gives life to the hair. I advise it!</li>
    <li> I bought this product two days after I bought a relaxer and applied it to my hair and my hair literally started coming out! After I rinsed the relaxer out my hair was very thin and broken. I googled searchess on products that can help restore my hair and I tried a couple that I found, but they didn&#x27;t really make a difference. I was in CVS one day and saw an organic root stimulator replenshing pak and decided to try it. I left it on for 2 hours and once I rinsed it out I noticed an immediate difference. My hair felt very soft. Needless to say, it has been almost 3 weeks since I applied the relaxer and I use the shampoo and conditioner every couple of days and my hair has definitley gotten stronger and softer on it&#x27;s way to full recovery! Thank God for this product!</li>
    <li> I love this conditioner!!! It is the only one I can use and see noticeable moisture retention in my hair. It makes my hair soft, silky, and more manageable. I have used the 10-20 dollar conditioners and Wen. I have tried so many other options for dry hair and this one is perfect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would not recommend this for someone with fine hair or oily hair. I have very thick, curly/wavy hair. This works wonders for me. It&#x27;s certainly worth a try since it&#x27;s inexpensive. Hope my review helps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S For those with super dry hair, Google coconut oil for hair. I hope to try virgin coconut oil for my hair as well.</li>
    <li> I have really dry ends and an oily scalp, so I was a little skeptical about trying the Replenishing Pak. Also, I prefer salon products and usually something under $2 isn&#x27;t worth it. Well, I&#x27;ve never had a drugstore product work so great!! I use it about once every two weeks; I shower, apply the conditioner, comb through, wrap in a cap and sit under the dryer for about 30 minutes. I will admit it takes several washes to remove. I typically end up wearing my hair in a pony tail the next day just because it&#x27;s still so oily. After 3-4 washes my hair is back to normal, except so soft and silky! I&#x27;ve noticed a huge difference the past few months I&#x27;ve been using it. I&#x27;d definitely recommend it for anyone with damaged hair!</li>
    <li> i think im due to buy another one of these lol. It works so well for me, whenever I use it I find my hair doesnt drop out as much, i can completely comb it through with no tangles (even if my hair is matted, like if i just took out braids or twists), I cant say that about any other product.</li>
    <li> Purchased this for the second time from Walgreens...left my hair shiny however it also left my hair very sticky/heavy. IT was cheap but that&#x27;s about it. I have pretty fine hair so maybe it works better for coarse hair so if you have fine hair DO NOT GET IT,</li>
    <li> Sooooo happy with this product!!! The BEST deep conditioner for my fine, frizzy, curly, color-treated hair. Bought this on a whim at Walgreens, and was AMAZED at the results just from the first use! My curly, split-ends hair went from being a frissy, tangled mess to shiny, sleek and soft, with very manageable curls. And the smell is DIVINE, olive oil with differnet notes of herbs and fruit extracts. I put the entire contents of one package on freshly washed hair, wrapped it up in a towel and let is sit for 1 hour, then rinsed.&lt;br /&gt;The best part is, you can pick up an individual packet at the local pharmacy for around $1.75, and give it a try before committing to buying a larger quantity, something that I wish other salon products would offer, as they can get quite pricey. This product worked much better for me than Aveda&#x27;s $60 deep conditining masque, and smelled and worked better than NouNou&#x27;s olive-oil based $25 hair mask--though those are both fine products, they just didn&#x27;t offer that deep, nourishing treatment my hair needed after coloring.</li>
    <li> Good quality, fast shipping.</li>
    <li> I bought this conditioner for my great grandaughter who has super curly hair.  Instead of washing it out, I leave it in for a day and put her hair in braids.  When we wash it out the next day, her hair is so soft and manageable - stays that way all week.  I have since found it in the stores like WalMart for the same price and will probably but it there in the future because the shipping costs are expensive.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this on my hair for years. Works great, my hair feels wonderful after I leave it on for an hour. Especially good in the winter months when your hair needs extra moisture.</li>
    <li> I usually deep condition my hair every 2 weeks and this product is excellent! I love the way it makes my hair feel and the smell is awesome. I add a little oil to the conditioner and sit with the conditioner on my hair for about 2 hours and it makes my hair feel so soft and bouncy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this to everyone I know.</li>
    <li> Just part of a package left on my hair for 10 minutes brings shine, softness and curl management.  I use once a week.</li>
