      <li>But I started using the Neutrogena Naturals face wash and found that I really, really liked it, so I decided to give this one a try.</li>
      <li>Companies that manufacture perfume or cologne purchase fragrance mixtures from fragrance houses (companies that specialize in developing fragrances) to develop their own proprietary blends.</li>
      <li>Honestly I could not believe it.</li>
      <li>It leaves me skin feelings nice and refreshed.</li>
      <li>What kind of chemicals are they using in this supposedly &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;nourishing&amp;#34</li>
      <li>kind of waxy.</li>

      <li>I&#x27;ll be sticking to my Neutogena Healthy Skin Face Lotion with SPF 15,</li>
      <li>so I was glad to be able to order plenty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I was paying a lot, lot more for a Dermatologica product and bought this at Walmart because I didn&#x27;t feel like driving all the way across town to the specialty store.</li>
      <li>I am allergic to most creams, break out, rashes, etc.  </li>
      <li>But I&#x27;m glad I choose this.</li>

      <li>I always buy in bunches (free shipping rocks!)</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been on a mission to find a light lotion that would provide the right amount of moisture for my combination, acne-prone skin without leaving an oily residue or causing breakouts. After trying several different lotions, I think I&#x27;ve found a winner! Initially, I was nearly frightened away the price, which is kind of steep for a drugstore moisturizer, but I am glad that I gave it a try. It just melts right into my skin. In the two weeks that I&#x27;ve been using it, my skin tone has improved, and I&#x27;m getting fewer acne breakouts. I also like that there is no SPF to irritate my eye area. The fragrance (which smells like synthetic orange creamsicle) takes some getting used to, but otherwise, I love everything about this product. It might just become my holy grail lotion.</li>
    <li> This was an ok moisturizer. I have extremely dry skin, and this wasn&#x27;t at all moisturizing enough, and it feels quite tacky on the skin. Oddly enough, it burned going on. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it, but everyone&#x27;s skin reacts differently.</li>
    <li> My FAVORITE and only moisturizer for almost 2 years. I have acne prone skin at times. This stuff moisturizes gently and does not cause breakouts. LOVE it.</li>
    <li> no parabens....very hard to find (and find something good for your skin)</li>
    <li> I love this product and am afraid they will quit making it so I was glad to be able to order plenty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a great moisturizer at a decent price.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always been a fan of neutrogena and their products work my skin. I guess you can say I have combination skin oily/dry acne prone aand as I get older more senstive. But I&#x27;m glad I choose this. I use this the clarifying cleanser  and the night cream for almost a year and I hardly any acne and soft silky moisturized skin.</li>
    <li> It worked wonders and while my 60+ year old face did not turn into a 20 something face, the quality of the skin and lessening of the age spots has delighted me.  I recommend it.</li>
    <li> Good product, but the smell... in one word awful.  I put it on my face in the morning and I&#x27;m starting to feel nauseated half way through the day.  I need to wash my face to get the product off and make the nausea go away. Good idea Neutrogena, poor execution.  Unfortunately I won&#x27;t be getting my money back:(</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m giving this moisturiser 4stars coz I&#x27;ve been using it for only a week. I have combination skin and I&#x27;ve searched for something that works for a longtime...well, I picked this one and couldn&#x27;t be happier!  One, its 97% natural so its doesn&#x27;t dry my face but leaves it fresh with a glow. I&#x27;m using the natural bar as well and works fabulous!  It&#x27;s a keeper!</li>
    <li> I have had the worst trouble with moisturizers. I have the most reactive skin in the world, and almost anything new will break me out. I&#x27;ve tried many different kinds, all claiming that they won&#x27;t clog up your pores, but every single moisturizer I&#x27;ve ever tried broke me out. I actually gave up for a while and just let my skin dry out. But I started using the Neutrogena Naturals face wash and found that I really, really liked it, so I decided to give this one a try. Let me tell you.. I am incredibly relieved. It&#x27;s not oily, it&#x27;s not heavy, it has a nice scent. And the best part: no break outs. Not a single spot. I now use this literally every night and I am so happy about the changes in my skin tone and texture. Give it a try.</li>
    <li> I really gravitate to anything &#x27;Natural&#x27; that I can.  This is great, for Neutrogena to come out with their natural line.  I also use this along with Coconut oil on my face and hands.  I am an Oncology RN, and really believe &#x27;Toxins&#x27; are a threat to us, and we need to reduce our chemicals as much as possible.  Yes, I love the texture, it is not greasy, and use it easily under makeup.  Highly recommended.  ! ! !</li>
    <li> Great product for my skin care. It prevents my skin from dryness and it softens my skin. I use it daily and I love it! Definitely I will buy it again.</li>
    <li> This product caused itchy, burning hives / welps on my cheekbones and around the outside corners of my eyes. I had to take Benadryl for relief. I don&#x27;t recommend this product for anyone with allergies or sensitive skin. I read similar reviews on Neutrogena&#x27;s site.</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive skin, and this soap does not irritate my skin or dry it out unduly.  I use it with the facial moisturizer.  I didn&#x27;t realize how much this helped keep down the red in my skin until I ran out and had to switch, temporarily, to something else.  Not planning to run out again!</li>
    <li> Love it. My face absorbs it instantly like it felt thirst for a long period :)) The skin became more fresh and soft.&lt;br /&gt;The cream has a perfume like bubblegum from my childhood. My husband love it :)))</li>
    <li> I used to spend more than $40 for a small container of facial moisturizer at L&#x27;Occitane, but when I had a baby, money was more scarce. I tried this this one on a whim because I have always loved Neutrogena products. I was very happy with it and this costs only one third of what I had been paying. One container last me several months and I live in Arizona, where I have to use facial moisturizer every day. This one is not oily and leaves my skin super soft.</li>
    <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love love love this DAY moisturizer/lotion AND I&#x27;ve tried many - some from Neutrogena as well. It goes on smoothly (all you need is a small amount), very light weight, NOT greasy, NOT tacky - lose to being sticky, NOT oily, and certainly NOT drying like many oil-free lotions. It does NOT sting nor burn my eyes - after applying it around my eye area. Not having the burning/stinking eyes an hour later is the selling point for me. For a guy, I hate eye creams so just using this all over my face and neck is perfect. No dry spots, just a bit of dryish skin after using Proactive Solution. I&#x27;ve found many oil-free day cream to be somewhat drying on my face and some leaves dry spots, this does not do that. Finally, it stays on all day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Does not have a SPF........ I strongly dislike SPF as they make my skin oily/leathery looking and it burns my eyes.</li>
    <li> This face cream is a great daily moisturizer. Keeps my face hydrated without feeling greasy.</li>
    <li> I recently replaced my Olay 7-1 moisturizer with this product and my skin loves it.  Yes, the fragrance isn&#x27;t the greatest, but it doesn&#x27;t seem to negatively effect skin condition.  I have combo/oily skin and my chin is especially stubborn (w/ acne) and this moisturizer seems to improve this condition.  Overall, my skin looks and feels better!  I also like the cleanser (the one w/ makeup remover added).</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Neutrogena products for many years and so when they released their \\&quot;Naturals\\&quot; product line, I thought I&#x27;d give them a try.  I use Moisturizer every day and was very pleased when this new product line came out - I&#x27;m a bit of a naturalist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I began using it as soon as it arrived and immediately noticed what a clean and pleasant fragrance it has.  The moisturizer goes on very smoothly and has no traces of oil - it feels great on the skin. Also, just a little goes a very long way.  My skin feels smoother and dewy!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I liked it so much that I went back and purchased the entire line - night cream and serum. I love them all!</li>
    <li> I bought this product 6 months ago and have been using it almost daily since then. I previously used a moisturizer from Philosophy and absolutely loved it. However, the Philosophy product was quite expensive so I wanted to find a cheaper alternative and a friend recommended this Neutrogena moisturizer to me. I have combination skin where when I get dry (especially in the winter) I am super dry and when I get oily it is normally pretty moderate. I started using this in the fall and used it all throughout the winter so I was able to use it on all my skin phases. I found that this moisturize is really thick, and because it is so thick it sits heavily on the skin and does not make it feel nourishing, but kind of oily. Also, in the winter months this did absolutely nothing to help with my dry skin, it was not nourishing or moisturizing in any way. I also have very troubled, acne prone skin and this product did not break me out any more than usual.  Pros: Smells good Less harmful ingredients compared to other moisturizers Did not break me out  Cons: Does not really moisturize Sits heavily on the skin Can make skin oily sometimes</li>
    <li> kind of waxy. I will use it on arms, but not on face again due to feel</li>
    <li> love it, quality product</li>
    <li> Light and non greasy.</li>
    <li> I love the smell and feel of this lotion. I had finished chemo treatments and was looking pretty bad as it was hard on me. My face was dark and dry. I looked hideous. After a month of using this new product my skin was clearing beautifully. Everyone comments on my complexion. It is a good feeling. I love to rub the rest of it on my hands after I get done with my face. The smell is fresh and unique. Just feels good</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a bit heavy for my sensitive, acne prone skin, but the little bit of fragrance doesn&#x27;t give me any problems. It&#x27;s as good of a value as I&#x27;ve found anywhere.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this moisturizer for about a month and my skin looks awesome.  Even my brother noticed the change.  A little of this stuff goes a long way.  It is not quick absorbing and you have to wait a minute or two after you wash your face to get the best absorption.  The smell is not really pleasant, but it isn&#x27;t horrible either.</li>
    <li> So far, I like this lotion a lot although I have only tried it twice. The smell is quite pleasant but a tad bit strong. The consistency is thick but it doesn&#x27;t bother me as much as it probably should. It keeps my face moisturized which is the main reason for buying this. I also love how it is not tested on animals.</li>
    <li> Not greasy, smells great, perfect level of moisturizing. Definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff! I use this as a moisturizer for my face. Very clean and not harsh at all.</li>
    <li> I have finally found a moisturizer that works great with my skin. I&#x27;ve been dealing with mild/moderate acne for 20+ years now, and I&#x27;ve tried a ton of different cleansers, moisturizers, etc. After using the Neutrogena Naturals acne cleanser for a while with good results and tried this and... wow. Love it. I&#x27;ve been using it for a couple months now and I will definitely be ordering more. I&#x27;ve tried everything from the drugstore basics to the high-end stuff, and nothing works as well for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: A little goes a long way; feels light; spreads and absorbs easily; smell is pleasant and goes away quickly; price is right.&lt;br /&gt;Cons: None that I have found so far.</li>
    <li> Makes my face feel soft and clear.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s great it has no odor a creamy face lotion that doesn&#x27;t leave my face feeling greasy or oily. I place my make up on five minutes after this product.</li>
    <li> I usually do not mind fragrances. This one completely threw me off. It&#x27;s not a bad smell but every time it is applied, I kind of cant help but to make a face. The lip curl, raised eyebrow kinda face. The bf tried it and he thinks it smell like sweet tarts. i bought this at CVS and considered returning it but already threw the box out. No skin reactions though..so thats 1 star.&lt;br /&gt;I would not buy this again and I def. would not recommend this product to anyone solely based on the scent.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m in my late 50s and my skin is changing; the old products aren&#x27;t helping anymore. I&#x27;ve also been reading about how vitamins can help protect and heal skin. Since I&#x27;m allergic to sunblock (it gives me severe dermatitis), I figured this would be the next-best product for me to try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Add me to the thumbs-up crowd. This is wonderfully soothing, healing stuff. Yes, it has an unusual consistency compared to what we&#x27;re familiar with if we use the big-name products. But although it&#x27;s thick, it doesn&#x27;t block pores; I&#x27;ve even slept in it (under makeup and on a hot night, no less) without any resulting problems at all. It will be absorbed more completely if you rub it into small areas at a time, rather than trying to rub it into a whole cheek or the whole forehead at once.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It feels great on contact. The scent disappears quickly. I’ve had enough heavy floral scents in my cosmetics to welcome this light, sweet aroma.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for results... I had dramatic results after 2 uses: a breakout from another product that wouldn&#x27;t go away for months finally disappeared, and a patch of rough skin that nothing else changed turned normal. My facial skin feels less sensitive generally; I hadn&#x27;t realized that it had been feeling tight all the time until the sensation went away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dramatic results tend to happen when we first use something new, so I will have to wait and see if these benefits continue. I’m not quite ready to go hiking in full sun, but I am looking forward to spending some time outdoors without obsessing about keeping my face shaded.</li>
    <li> I have purchased this moisturizer several times.  It is light with a fresh clean scent. I will continue to buy this product.</li>
    <li> I have been looking for a good moisturizer for my face. I cannot have a moisturizer that is heavy and have tried just about every one of them out there. I liked this one because it works very well and is not overly scented. A little goes a long way. I have very dry skin in the winter and this is just what my face needs. I have not tried it in the summer yet but I have a feeling I will not really need it because I sweat a lot.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this for a year and it is suitable for all seasons with my combination acne prone skin. I used to use Clinique moisturizing gel but this is better and more affordable.</li>
    <li> A little goes a long way.  Absolute perfect to balance out oil &amp; dry spots.  I have many sensitivities, this is no odor or dyes &amp; is great for my skin.</li>
    <li> ok product for ok price.</li>
    <li> This is a great moisturizer. I used to get zits every month or so and ever since I started using this daily, I NEVER get them. Like other reviewers have said, it is kind of a thick lotion consistency, but you don&#x27;t need much of it. I have used it for a few years and will continue.</li>
    <li> NOT FOR T ZONE , PRONE OR OILY SKIN THOUGH. TOOOOO OILY FOR COMBINATION SKIN&lt;br /&gt;in general, neutrogena are the best cleansers!</li>
    <li> My skin actually feels smoother after using this product for about a month.</li>
    <li> I bought this same product at Target for $2 more due to the fact the previous moisturizer I was using wasn&#x27;t non-comedogenic and the acne was really starting to bother me.  Everything about the product is good--the scent most people complain about doesn&#x27;t bother me much.  BUT, after the product dries on my face, it begins to feel like a face mask, and I have to stretch the skin on my face to make the sensation go away. Also, I&#x27;m relatively hairy; other moisturizers I used didn&#x27;t look like glue on my eyebrows or sideburns when it ended up there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really wanted to like this product, since I was having difficulty finding another affordable and natural brand after St.Ives was bought by Unilever.  Not sure if I&#x27;ll buy again :s</li>
    <li> I feel this is the perfect moisturizer for everyday use. I use is after my sunscreen during the day (and retinol in the evening). There is a smell (nice) but it is mild. It goes on wonderfully and absorbs well; and you know you&#x27;re using the healthiest ingredients on your skin. I would recommend it.</li>
    <li> This product burned my face. One application left my skin red and glowing with pain. What kind of chemicals are they using in this supposedly &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;nourishing&amp;#34; product? It needs a warning label!</li>
    <li> Have been on a quest to find a moisturizer that would not irritate my overly sensitive skin.  I&#x27;ve tried many other moisturizers (Cetaphil, First Aid Beauty, La Mer, etc, but always something in the ingredients bother my skin, i.e. fragrance or other chemicals). Otherwise, discovering Neutrogena Naturals has been a God-send and am glad that it&#x27;s been working well for my overly sensitive skin.  Have also used the other products (lip balm and night cream) with equal satisfaction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will point out that some others have complained about the &amp;#34;scent&amp;#34; of the cream.  I would have to imagine that this &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; cream would have an mineral smell due to the natural ingredients, but there is a pleasant, citrus overtone (at least that what it smells like to me) that does well to mask the mineral smell.  This citrus scent is fine for me and I actually like it alot, but I guess not everyone will like it.</li>
    <li> I just love this, Neutrogena Naturals Multi-Vitamin Nourishing Moisturizer.  I especially love the fact that it doesn&#x27;t clog my pores...</li>
    <li> This lotion goes on smooth, and absorbs in without leaving any oilly residue. No obnoxious odor. Feel great. Does not stain your clothes or bedsheets.</li>
    <li> excellent product, thank you very much.</li>
    <li> Great moisturizer, goes on smooth, has a nice scent and does not cause breakouts. Many moisturizers have a watery feel to them and leave your skin feeling like it didn&#x27;t even get any added moisture, but this leaves your skin feeling soft and moisturized</li>
    <li> So I have tried multiple products and this one works by far the best. Now, I have a RED, RED face. My skin is dry on my cheeks but oily on my forehead and chin. This moisturizer stung a little the first few applications BUT the color in my face is FINALLY balanced. Sure, I still got some red in my cheeks but it&#x27;s subtle. I put it on once a day in the morning and so far I can&#x27;t be happier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would suggest you buy it and try it out. It&#x27;s a good price. I bought mine for about $14</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been on a hunt for a new facial moisturizer for the last several months, as my favorite moisturizer has been discontinued. I decided to try Neutrogena Naturals Multivitamin Nourishing Moisturizer because it has good ratings on Amazon and because I&#x27;ve previously used other Neutrogena products and been happy with them. Unfortunately, I was not happy with this moisturizer at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A rundown on my skin type. I have very sensitive skin. I tend to have combination skin, although when my skin is dry it is VERY dry. It it gets oily it just gets moderately oily. I don&#x27;t really have issues with breakouts (only a pimple here or there from time to time), but do have issues with my skin breaking out into a itching rash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I purchased this moisturizer I was hoping for a light-weight, oil-free, scent-free moisturizer. I wanted something that didn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling oily, but also moisturized it. Also, having very sensitive skin I need a moisturizer that won&#x27;t cause pimple breakouts or rash breakouts. Lastly, I need a moisturizer that I can put my liquid foundation over and still gives me an even skin tone. Sadly, the Neutrogena Naturals Multivitamin Nourishing Moisturizer didn&#x27;t measure up in really any of this areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- It moisturizes your skin.&lt;br /&gt;- Is for the most part scent free. It is not per-fumy.&lt;br /&gt;- Didn&#x27;t breakout into a itchy rash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- It is NOT lightweight. This is the thickest facial moisturizer I have EVER purchased.&lt;br /&gt;- It left my skin feeling VERY oily and it felt as though the moisturizer was just sitting on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;- I has more pimple breakouts with this product than what is typical for me.&lt;br /&gt;- It left my skin uneven, especially when I applied makeup. I think this is in part to its thickness and lack of soaking into my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This moisturizer says it is breathable and leaves your skin feeling clean. This was NOT even remotely the case for me. In fact, the consistency of this product is so heavy I think it is much better suited as a body lotion than a facial moisturizer. In order to avoid completely wasting this product, I ended up putting it on my legs and using it as a body lotion. It worked perfect for that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product and will not be purchasing it again. However, I do have to say that the one thing I&#x27;ve learned having life long issues with sensitive skin is what doesn&#x27;t work for one person could work fabulous for another and visa versa. So sadly, unless everyone is saying its horrible, you might have to try it out for yourself to find out it if is the right product for you.

    <li> Good stuff for bad skin.</li>
    <li> I have extremely acne prone skin, and it is combination. I&#x27;ve noticed whenever I put this lotion on in the morning, i staff to develop a little pimple or two. Then it slowly become a cycle. I stopped using the face moisturizer, and decided to go all natural. Turns out my face completely cleared up. I had been using this face lotion for at least 5 months until I had had enough.&lt;br /&gt;Not buying again. Way too greasy too.</li>
    <li> My skin gets dry and flaky in winter. I&#x27;ve tried a few other brands, many moisturizers are too rich and feel tacky all day. And lightweight moisturizers don&#x27;t provide enough moisture for me. This daily moisturizer from Neutrogena is perfect. I love the way it feels on my face. My dry skin is quenched and my face feels really smooth after, not greasy or sticky.</li>
    <li> Wonderful product! Great feel, easy to clean afterwards! Made my face feel great!</li>
    <li> I bought it mainly for the size - 3 oz is OK for airline carry on items.  Now I&#x27;m happy because of the quality of the product.  I used it everyday when I went to Australia and spend time on their beaches.</li>
    <li> I have sensitive skin, a little rosacea and a little eczema.  Although I do like the consistency of this product and I do not object to the smell, my skin burned when I used this product.  I had to wash it off immediately.</li>
    <li> A rich moisturizer that does not clog my pores and gets absorbed quickly. My skin feels radiant all day long.</li>
    <li> Great lotion.  Doesn&#x27;t cause breakouts and has a gentle clean scent.</li>
    <li> I found out lately that Olay products are making my skin more oily, so I decided to opt for a natural brand being that I know they have been working well with my skin type, which is oily/normal combination. I also have been showering twice a day because I work out hard in the mornings and noticed too that my skin was drying out a little, so I knew that I was gonna need a moisturizer and when I saw that Neutrogena had a natural product line, I wanted to try them out because they have always been a decent brand and you really can&#x27;t do wrong with them! The fragrance is very light and pleasant and I feel that it has definitely made a difference in my skin because my acne is disappearing fast, especially with how bad my skin gets during periods and the vitamins B, C, and E are especially good for your skin. You really don&#x27;t have to use much to get the full effect so this stuff is gonna last me forever! Best $10 I have spent so far! Definitely going to recommend!</li>
    <li> I am 50 years old and have tried everything on my face.  I am allergic to most creams, break out, rashes, etc.  I used this and was amazed!!!  For the first time, I put it on and did not have a stinging feeling on my face or around my eyes.  It was like putting a cool compress on my skin.  Refreshing and soothing.  I put it on right out of the shower and then go get dressed.  By the time I am ready to put make up on, it has complete soaked into my skin and make up application is flawless.  Can&#x27;t say enough good things about this cream.  Will never ever ever switch!!! :)</li>
    <li> It is very smooth and applies really well. Feels great and fresh on my skin! I know this will be my stable so instantly subscribed it.&lt;br /&gt;Con: I have a very dry skin so I hope it had more &#x27;oils&#x27; in it for winter months. But I guess it would be great for summer.</li>
    <li> This cream is a disaster! It&#x27;s thick and stinks terrible. After I put it on I fell like my face is covered with glue or something, feels like a mask and that feeling lasts hours. I love Neutrogena&#x27;s Pore Scrub, my face after wash is clean and refreshened, but that cream ruins everything. If I could I would ask for money back, I&#x27;d buy St Ives for $4 and would be happy. 97% of natural ingredients? I&#x27;d say 97% of nastiness.</li>
    <li> I think that this moisturizer is okay it definitely works I just felt like it was a bit heavy and didn&#x27;t absorb well for me.</li>
    <li> I love this moisturizer. Morning and night use. I add a little almond oil for the night use.</li>
    <li> This is the first noncomedogenic face lotion I have found that doesn&#x27;t burn.  Love it!  I have been using it for over a year. My skin looks and feels great ( I am 57 years old).  I am never changing again.  And the price beats any store I have seen.  I always buy in bunches (free shipping rocks!)</li>
    <li> I think it&#x27;s a good product overall. it doesn&#x27;t give visible results like their retinol creams. it smells nice, absorbs quickly, moisturizes. I&#x27;d probably buy it again.</li>
    <li> Used several of those, by far the best there is in the &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; spectrum. Works well on my skin. Will recommend as service and as a product.</li>
    <li> A fantastic lotion for people like me with very dry skin. Just a little expensive for the amount you get but, I can&#x27;t deny the excellentness (ITS A WORD because I made it up) of this product.</li>
    <li> great moisturizer without a greasy feeling!</li>
    <li> A little too irritating for my skin. Did not get rid of my dryness.</li>
    <li> Contrary to other reviews, the smell is not natural nor is it botanically derived. It is an overpowering fake smell. I was shocked so I checked their website. The scent is in fact &amp;#34;synthetic.&amp;#34; It&#x27;s the only synthetic thing in it, so it boggles my mind as to why the wouldn&#x27;t also use something natural for the smell.</li>
    <li> Love my neutrogena. I highly recommend it if you have sensitive skin like me.</li>
    <li> This lotion really helps moisturizer my dry, patchy areas. Doesn&#x27;t break out my skin and smells fresh. I would definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> My very sensitive skin adores this moisturizer.  Absolutely love it.  I currently use it at night, and use one with an spf during the day, but I&#x27;m always tempted to use it in the morning as well.  It makes my skin feels soft, plump, and happy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: I wish I could give it 4.5 stars. The scent is the only downside - it&#x27;s a little too strong, and smells like very sweet candy.  I&#x27;ve gotten used to it, so not a big deal, but when you first put it on it&#x27;s hard not to think of smarties candy.</li>
    <li> I bought this moisturizer because I liked that the majority of the ingredients are natural, however it just is not worth it for me.  My pores appear larger when using this product, and my face is so dry by the end of the day!  From now on I will just stick with Neutrogena Healthy Skin Radiance Cream.</li>
    <li> Absolutely LOVE this product.  I have had issues with acne since I was 15 (now 50), this product is beautifully light and readily absorbs into the skin.  It does a wonderful job.  Highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Just a great product that Neutrogena came out with this line of products I plan on ordering this and other natural products too!</li>
    <li> I bought this to go with the neutrogena naturals cleanser.  I like the cleanser- it is gentle and has very little fragrance and does not dry out my skin too much.  I have combination skin and sometimes it can be hard to find a balance.  This moisturizer feels very heavy, does not absorb well and has too strong of a fragrance.  I would not purchase it again.</li>
    <li> Very good moisturizer. Doesn&#x27;t feel greasy and absorbs well. Has a nice botanical smell that isn&#x27;t overpowering. Keeps my face feeling soft and doesn&#x27;t clog pores.</li>
    <li> Looooove this stuff. Doesn&#x27;t leave a residue on the skin, and is very soft.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t say much, I bought this for my wife and she loves it.  Neutrogena seems to always save my day.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s nice to have such a clear ingredient list saying the source of the ingredients.  BUT..... why is \\&quot;fragrance\\&quot; included? They have gone to lengths to exclude a number of things like parabens and pthalates... but then they include \\&quot;fragrance.\\&quot; We don&#x27;t know what&#x27;s in the fragrance, where it comes from, and Environmental Working Group has demonstrated that it often contains things that are harmful to our health.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From ewg dot com forward slash not so sexy: \\&quot; Perfumes, colognes and body sprays are often called \\&quot;fragrances.\\&quot; But under U.S. law, the term fragrance is defined as a combination of chemicals that gives each perfume or cologne its distinct scent. Fragrance ingredients may be produced by chemical synthesis or derived from petroleum or natural raw materials. Companies that manufacture perfume or cologne purchase fragrance mixtures from fragrance houses (companies that specialize in developing fragrances) to develop their own proprietary blends. In addition to \\&quot;scent\\&quot; chemicals that we actually smell, perfumes and colognes also contain solvents, stabilizers, UV absorbers, preservatives and dyes. These additives are frequently, but not always, listed on product labels. In contrast, the chemical components in fragrance itself are protected as trade secrets and described on the label only as \\&quot;fragrance.\\&quot;\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So... Neutrogena, you are almost there. But why include fragrance? Why not have your so-close-to natural product be \\&quot;Fragrance Free\\&quot; and just have no scent. Those of us looking for something non-toxic to put on our skin (a growing market) will buy it. Neutogena says on it&#x27;s label it is \\&quot;necessary\\&quot; to blend the product and maintain effectiveness... but why would something they are marketing as a scent be necessary?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than that, it goes on easy, is not greasy, doesn&#x27;t sting my eyes, and I will update to let you all know if it triggers any skin reactions (I stopped using anything but aloe on my face for months after other products gave me rashes around my eye).</li>
    <li> I have rosecea. I have to head off the dry scaley patches on my cheeks while being careful about what I&#x27;m using on my face. I&#x27;m allergic to latex, plastic, honey, wheat, and roses, so having clear ingredients on this package is great. It&#x27;s also quite difficult to find a good, deep moisturizer that isn&#x27;t greasy!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As some of the others mentioned, not knowing exactly what is in the fragrance almost made me not buy this. However, the scent is light and clean smelling, like fresh lemons (not like floor cleaner). I love how creamy it is. I was paying a lot, lot more for a Dermatologica product and bought this at Walmart because I didn&#x27;t feel like driving all the way across town to the specialty store. Much more affordable and actually this bottle is bigger too. Very happy with it.</li>
    <li> I will recommend this product to my friends. It gives energy to my skin, my face seems younger and feels fresh</li>
    <li> Marjorie Harvey (wife of comedian, game show and talk show host, Steve Harvey) recommends this product on her website as an excellent must-have moisturizer for aging skin. I love this product and am so glad I checked out Marjorie&#x27;s website.</li>
    <li> I really wanted to love this product because I [was] a Neutrogena fan and I love that they&#x27;re a mainstream brand attempting to use natural ingredients in a sustainable and cruelty free way, but unfortunately this product didn&#x27;t wow me. It&#x27;s definitely too heavy for me (oily prone, but acne free for over a year) to use as a facial day cream and it doesn&#x27;t contain any SPF, so I&#x27;ve relegated to a my night cream. It&#x27;s definitely ok for that purpose but it doesn&#x27;t really improve my skin tone or supplement it other than give it a nice dewy glow- fine for bedtime, but certainly not a suitable day look. I&#x27;ll be sticking to my Neutogena Healthy Skin Face Lotion with SPF 15, multivitamins and AHA once I figure out what to do with the remaining product left.</li>
    <li> I bought this because I am semi-allergic to some skincare. I tried this and it immediately started burning, but some products are zestful, so I left it. About three minutes later, my skin was bright red. Thankfully I was able to get some of it off, but my face is still very wind-burned-looking. Definitely getting a refund!</li>
    <li> i have sensitive skin and this is perfect. also smells really good</li>
    <li> Bought it at the drugstore as I was looking for a moisturizer that was a natural as possible. Within 2 weeks, the dark spots (uneven tone) had cleared up. Honestly I could not believe it. Previously I was using a Vit C moisturizer from Body shop (which had silicone and made the face seem smooth). But when I discontinued my use of that moisturizer (it ran out), my face started breaking out. I do not want something that my face / skin is dependent on. That is not real improvement, that is a catch, a dependency created by the company making that product. That terribly annoyed me. I wanted a moisturizer that would truly improve my skin tone so that if I didn&#x27;t use it for a few days, my skin would still be fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This moisturizer did that. I wear it usually every night after washing my face. It goes on well before make up also. The fragrance is very light and nice. I am surprised that some reviews say it stinks. So I guess it&#x27;s personal preference?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It absorbs well and in fact you do not have to use much. Love this product and hope it&#x27;s not discontinued.</li>
    <li> For some time I have been searching for a natural moisturizer that meets my criteria for ingredients and doesn&#x27;t break my budget. While this face lotion is priced right, and I was so excited that Neutrogena took the plunge to create an environmentally thoughtful product, it wasn&#x27;t a good fit for my skin. I found that I needed to use more of this face lotion than I have with other products, and still my skin remained dry.&lt;br /&gt;The smell that everyone talks about is odd. It&#x27;s not unbearable, but you do have to wonder why Neutrogena would put such a scent into their product. Somebody must have been asleep at the wheel the day the scent test passed through compliance.</li>
    <li> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;d9lYRwqOGEI</li>
    <li> Easy to use under makeup.</li>
    <li> Awesome moisturizer cream!, no pimples, just great</li>
    <li> this stuff smells weird and leaves ur face a lil greasy</li>
    <li> Way too heavy and tends to cake if not completely absorbed.  Does not leave skin feeling refreshed.  I prefer a lighter moisturizer.</li>
    <li> I use this with the Neutrogena Naturals Foaming Facial Scrub and the Neutrogena Naturals Multi-Vitamin Nourishing Night Cream and with all three products my face stays compeltely clear and glowing!</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. My skin is dry and I have a tendency to get irritation easily this and the creamy cleanser (regular not acne) have changed my skin in 2-3 weeks. Goodbye aveeno!</li>
    <li> This moisturizer so far has been the best I&#x27;ve used. A lot of the moisturizers out there make skin greasy and by mid day I&#x27;m in the bathroom dabbing my face with paper towels to get rid of excess oil. This moisturizer helps smoothe out my skin that is acne prone. I have been on two rounds of accutane. Right now I&#x27;m using Ovace cleanerser which is a smell prescription wash and I love the light non break out scent. I recommended this to my friend and she absolute loves it. If you have skin prone to redness and dullness, etc try this product along with a prescription acne cleanser. I think you are getting something truly great here for the price. Some swear my cetaphil moisturizer, I swear by this one. I have it a 4 because it i could find something with a little better results, I&#x27;d switch.</li>
    <li> Really nourishes the skin, not too heavy.  This is my second bottle, and I will continue to use it because of the results.</li>
    <li> It feels like the sweat piles, much like what happens when you put on sunscreen on yourself on a hot day.</li>
    <li> i seriously love this stuff. i put it on after I get out of the shower and am headed to bed. It leaves me skin feelings nice and refreshed. and it smells amazing! just makes me feel nice and clean :)</li>
    <li> The best moisturizer to date!</li>
    <li> Finally a product that moisturizes my flaky dry skin, feels good, and does not cause break-outs (no.....really!...it doesn&#x27;t!).  Used initially for a trip to dry, cold, blustery Alaska, but have used all winter in more mild climates.  There is no SPF so it&#x27;s really great for nighttime.  For day, I either add a layer of SPF after this has soaked in a few minutes, or use a foundation w SPF (when not using a chemical-free powder foundation).  Easy peasy.  Would love less chemicals, but for what it is and the price point, thankful.</li>
    <li> The only moisturizer that never makes my face break out</li>
    <li> Nice, clean, citrusy scent. Great value.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing! I absolutely recommend this product to everyone:) I have oily/combination/somewhat sensitive skin and this product does the job. It keeps my skin in check and gives me a little extra glow:) I also mix this with my 100% argon oil for extra moisture. Especially around my cheeks because that&#x27;s where my dry areas are. I kind of lean more to natural products and this is worth it!</li>
    <li> I grabbed this moisturizer one day as I am trying to \\&quot;detox\\&quot; my beauty stash. I didn&#x27;t expect anything fabulous out of it, but it works GREAT! It is very light, not greasy, and smells fabulous. The only thing missing is some SPF... but of course, it being a natural moisturizer, guess I can&#x27;t be too choosy. All in all, I will stick with it!</li>
    <li> Love this moisturizer - it is lightweight and smells great.  Love this product!</li>
    <li> This is a great moisturizer which absorbs well :) I have to say, the products scent was (for me) a pleasant surprise!</li>
    <li> very nice for the skin absorbs really well makes your skin feel great</li>
    <li> Ok but not as moisturizing as hoped</li>
    <li> This is hands down the best moisturizer I have ever used. I have very dry AND acne prone skin (I&#x27;m 37! Not fair!) and this not only gets rid of the dry patches but also keeps my acne to a minimum. It&#x27;s getting harder to find locally and so I was glad to see they still have the full line available online.</li>
    <li> This lotion is light and absorbs well. It smells refreshing kinda like avacado and grapefruit to me, but its light and goes away quickly.</li>
    <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE this product!  Love all of the Neutrogena Naturals products!  I highly recommend.  Does not leave skin sticky at all and has a lovely scent that goes away after application, but smells lovely while applying.  I highly recommend the face wash as well.  Been using them since they came out, prior to that I was a regular Neutrogena product lady :)</li>
    <li> I have \\&quot;troubled\\&quot; skin. I am in my early 40s, yet I still break out. I have a few fine lines, yet still get blackheads. I get flaky skin, but still get oily when the weather gets over 80 degrees. I have a reaction to dimethicone (which is in almost every moisturizer) but get clogged pores from most oil-based creams. In other words, my skin is a pain in the butt. I bought this pretty much on a whim. I liked the majority of the ingredients, and since the one thing my skin isn&#x27;t usually sensitive to is fragrance, I figured what the heck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent was a bit strong when first applied, but it faded quickly enough. Right away I liked the way my skin felt. I only needed a small amount, and it soaked in right away. My skin felt velvety and smooth, not sticky or greasy. It made a wonderful base for makeup, and didn&#x27;t make me overly oily by the end of the day. I&#x27;ve been using it for a couple of months now, and I haven&#x27;t broken out or experienced any allergic reactions. My skin looks better than it did when I started using it, so that means it&#x27;s a keeper. Nice to finally have a regular brand of moisturizer and not have to be constantly on the hunt for something new.</li>
