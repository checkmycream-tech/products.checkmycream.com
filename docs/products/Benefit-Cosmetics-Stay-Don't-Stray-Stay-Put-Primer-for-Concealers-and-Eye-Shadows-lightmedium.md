      <li>This is wonderful as a primer, or as an eye shadow itself.  </li>

      <li>This is a great eye primer for flawless eye makeup..</li>
      <li>I would not use UD Eden under my eyes, nor am I happy how the Stay Don&#x27;t Stay looks under my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s a great product</li>
      <li>And this stuff is GREAT for me.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s great for diminishing under eye darkness.  </li>
      <li>While there is a notable difference between when I use this and do not, this product will not hold eye make-up all day perfectly.  </li>
      <li>This product works great with my fair skin.  </li>
      <li>While there is a notable difference between when I use this and do not, this product will not hold eye make-up all day perfectly.  </li>
      <li>I can say with a liquid foundation or liquid + powder foundation you&#x27;re good to go.</li>
      <li>also was a good color when it was on my lids.</li>
      <li>I love this product!</li>
      <li>To be honest, this is a product I would have never thought of buying by itself.  </li>
      <li>I use it every day and it provides a nice concealer for under my eyes and helps my eye shadow stay in place.</li>
      <li>I had a sample of this product from Sephora, and I loved it -- which is why I looked for the full product.  </li>
      <li>product has an opaque coverage that is very fair; even on my pasty face it was pretty light.</li>
      <li>However, you&#x27;ll want to re-ap if you&#x27;re doing anything more than going to the grocery store and going home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note</li>
      <li>When I pumped it out, it wouldn&#x27;t come out and as I unscrewed the top.</li>
      <li>This works fabulous!  </li>
      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>It is better than no primer</li>
      <li>To my dismay, when I began pumping it (the sample had an applicator, which I like must better), it was water.  </li>
      <li>Love this product.&lt;br</li>
      <li>and I absolutely love it.  </li>
      <li>However, you&#x27;ll want to re-ap if you&#x27;re doing anything more than going to the grocery store and going home.    </li>
      <li>It should be a tube for more controlled use.</li>
      <li>Even band-aids probably match skin tones better than this stuff.    </li>
      <li>/&gt;i bought this at sephora and exchanged it for too faced&#x27;s shadow insurance, and it has worked much better for me.</li>
      <li>I love the packaging of all the Benefit makeup products and this one got to me too.</li>
      <li>I really love this stuff and am glad I have</li>
      <li>for those with fair skin and light bags under your eyes, it is too light to be used as an all day concealer.  </li>
      <li>They make a tinted version called \\&quot;Eden\\&quot;, and that is what Stay Don&#x27;t Stray most closely resembles.</li>
      <li>However, if you have more of a relaxed neutral blended style, you&#x27;ll be fine with this one and appreciate the lightness.  </li>

      <li>Smooth.</li>
      <li>but I have under-eye circles and wanted something light.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Notes:  I have a good medium foundation for which to ultimately blend color on top.</li>
      <li>I originally rated 5 stars, but this product does not age well and the ingredients separate after a while...</li>
      <li>But for the first time ever I&#x27;m now able to wear a cream eyeshadow without creasing as soon as it&#x27;s applied.</li>
      <li>Thankfully I didn&#x27;t pay full price for this, a sample was included in a beauty box by Sephora.</li>
      <li>&lt;br /&gt;Performance:  Not bad, still required re-ap.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> There are multiple problems with this product:  1- it dispenses too much at a time, you end up wasting half the product.  2- it does NOT keep eye makeup from creasing.  The color stays, but I still get a crease.  3- looks cakey  4- for those with fair skin and light bags under your eyes, it is too light to be used as an all day concealer.  But, if you use concealer over it you get raccoon eyes.    Don&#x27;t waste your money on this.  There are far better eyelid primers.</li>
    <li> I tend to have oily eyelids, worse in the hotter months, but overall nothing excessive.  My eyeliner usually stays in place, but eyeshadow doesn&#x27;t normally last more than 4 hours (what remains is in the crease).  I bought this on the salesperson at Sephora&#x27;s recommendation, and this has been a disappointment.  There has been NO DIFFERENCE in the staying power of eye makeup on me, regardless of the environment (cold, hot, humid, etc.) I&#x27;m in.  Also, Benefit put no thought into the functionality of the packaging.  A small dab (a drop is too much) of this product can cover your entire eye area.  You have to use a very controlled, light touch with the pump, otherwise you will waste product.  As with all pumps, when the product is low, it&#x27;s hard to empty out the container to use it all (which is a must for something this expensive).    The only good thing about this is when I do apply it, it actually helps brighten my eye area without additional concealer... at least for the few hours it lasts.</li>
    <li> This is a terrific eye makeup base.  My eyelids are naturally dark so this really prepes my lids for eyeshadow.  its makes the lids lighter and smoother to show off my eyeshadow color.  it also keeps the shadow from melting into your skin, so your makeup stays on longer and brighter all day long.  Great eye makeup base for all.</li>
    <li> I usually don&#x27;t like to wear a lot of make-up but I have under-eye circles and wanted something light.  This works fabulous!  I agree with the comments that the pump could be a little smoother and I haven&#x27;t really noticed this helping that much in terms of staying power of eyeliner.  But it definately brighetens up the eyes.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work for me. My eyeshadow doesn&#x27;t stay put all day long. I feel dissapointed.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m usually a fan of Benefit products, but not this time. I used this as an eyeshadow primer and was disappointed. It goes on extremely thick and is a matte beige color, which takes a long time to blend fully. I also don&#x27;t think it makes my eyeshadow stay put nearly as long as other eye primers, such as Too Faced and Urban Decay. I definitely will not repurchase this.</li>
    <li> My cosmetic \\&quot;Stay Don&#x27;t Stray,\\&quot; came very quickly to me. but the item itself is suppose to be a liquid foundation. When I pumped it out, it wouldn&#x27;t come out and as I unscrewed the top. The foundation was very cakey, and the consitency was too thick and lumpy. Buying as a brand new product you wouldn&#x27;t expect this, but the product seemed to be sitting for a long time before getting sold.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a great product, that I thinned out myself using water. Where I wouldn&#x27;t have to send it back, but I was  bit suprised the seller didn&#x27;t take the time to look at the product first before sending it out to me.&lt;br /&gt;Sincerly, JD in Californa</li>
    <li> I got this mainly for my eyeshadow (have not used it with my concealer because there is no need to)  and it works well with the eyeshadow.  I used this when applying makeup for work.  It holds the shadow well however it creases almost at the end of the day (8 hours). so it is not that bad after all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, the packaging is wasting my money and product!  It has a dispenser which pumps out too much product with the lightest push, the extra can be for a second day use.  It should be a tube for more controlled use.</li>
    <li> This product works very well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have oily skin and have darker shadows under my eyes as well as darker eye lids.  So in addition to eyeshadow often disapearing after a few hours, concealers also look chaulky and cakey after a while too.  A small (and it is hard to dispense a small amount) amount of this on my lid and under my eyes actually keeps my eyeshadow on all day, and I&#x27;ve found acts as a light concealer too-in fact some days I&#x27;ve managed to go without wearing any concealor some days.  There&#x27;s no creasing, no chaulky look and no cakey feel either.  I really love this stuff and am glad I have it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought it at Sephora where it was bundled with Erase Paste and a cream shadow and both compliment the product; although I find the Erase Paste a little heavy with the Stay, Don&#x27;t Stray applied and have switched to Boi-ing for concealer.  But for the first time ever I&#x27;m now able to wear a cream eyeshadow without creasing as soon as it&#x27;s applied.</li>
    <li> I noticed that the reviews are very mixed on this product.  For me, I tend to be towards the lovers of the product. Here, I think are the major points.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First major test used: early evening application for a wild party birthday evening and a \\&quot;sleep over\\&quot; with younger man (I&#x27;m over 30, but in denial that I&#x27;m aging... as we all should be).  The make-up neutral/natural dramatic (3 eyeshadow shading) with powder eyeliner (MAC) and liquid eye-liner on top (Cheap drug store brand), cover the dark circles.  Application of product surrounded the eye raccoon style to give you that bright young \\&quot;base\\&quot; for which you can apply the darker brown/neutral shades on top for a sophisticated look  The stay put went to the brow.  My skin tone is medium, so this added a highlight effect to the brow shaping technique that i did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Performance:  Pass with flying color.  I awoke at 9am, slightly hung over, jumped over my young beau, so as not to awaken him, fearful that my face was going to be a distorted mess.  I looked ready to go back out on the town.  It held the cheap liquid eyeliner on top of a powder eyeliner I was testing as well as the eyemake-up despite having had \\&quot;night-time activities\\&quot; and sleeping in it.  This means it held the powder eyeliner on tightly along with the liquid. My \\&quot;night-time\\&quot; activities + sleepover would have generally resulted in make-up across my face.  The dark circles (now accentuated by alcohol with inadequate hydration) were not visible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Notes:  I have a good medium foundation for which to ultimately blend color on top. I&#x27;m not sure if some of the other reviews are trying to use this as a concealer/liquid foundation.  That seems a little odd to me... it&#x27;s a primer not a foundation. Alternatively, I wonder if those using the product are using a powder foundation or liquid.  I can say with a liquid foundation or liquid + powder foundation you&#x27;re good to go. I haven&#x27;t extensively tried this with only a powder foundation. The texture is close to a light liquid foundation, not thick like a concealer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Test 2:  All day work and then go on to party at night.  Application 7am - ????&lt;br /&gt;Performance:  Not bad, still required re-ap. While there is a notable difference between when I use this and do not, this product will not hold eye make-up all day perfectly.  The touch ups are more minor and it will still show lighter around the eyes if you are using shading techniques to manage dark circles and increase that youthful eye look. However, you&#x27;ll want to re-ap if you&#x27;re doing anything more than going to the grocery store and going home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: if you&#x27;re an eye-rubber - especially if you&#x27;re a contact wearing eye-rubber - then you will think this product doesn&#x27;t work.  Look.. it holds make-up on your face. If you&#x27;re rubbing your eyes, then the darken flecks of your mascara that ends up in your eyemake-up is going to make you think this stuff isn&#x27;t working.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Final Review:  If you&#x27;re primarily interested in holding eye make-up and you are not doing something crazy/christina aguillera show make-up, then go for it.  If your make-up regiment includes holding massive amounts of a single shadow that must stay uniformly applied, then go for the urban decay product.  That is the style they are selling anyway. However, if you have more of a relaxed neutral blended style, you&#x27;ll be fine with this one and appreciate the lightness.  As for irritation, the product allowed me to withstand the irritation I usually get from the cheap drug store liquid liner, so for most this should be a good product on that test.light liquid foundation, not thick like a concealer.

    <li> This product works exactly as it is supposed to.  It keeps my eyeliner and shadow in place all night, and helps conceal my under-eye circles to boot!  This product works great with my fair skin.  However, I can&#x27;t imagine this product working for anyone with a darker complexion...or a tan!&lt;br /&gt;+Quick Addition:  I originally rated 5 stars, but this product does not age well and the ingredients separate after a while...not sure what life expectancy is supposed to be.</li>
    <li> I got a sample of this product in the mail and I was hooked from the get-go.  It works very well as a primer if put on very thin.  Push the dispenser down very slowly or you&#x27;ll get about a week worth of product.  I&#x27;ve used this just about every time I put on makeup and my tube has lasted me almost a year (but i use a teeny-tiny bit at a time.)  It&#x27;s great for diminishing under eye darkness.  On another note it is an EXCELLENT tattoo concealer too.  Give it a try.</li>
    <li> I love this product! I love the packaging of all the Benefit makeup products and this one got to me too. ;-) But this really keeps my eyeliner and eyeshadow in place! My makeup usually rubs off in an hour after applying it. I was pleasantly surprised when I used this and it didn&#x27;t Stray!</li>
    <li> I like it for the upper eyelids, it does gives a clean look.  Only draw back is that the properties does separates from each other when pumps out, so must blends well between fingers before applying.</li>
    <li> When I received this product the box looked Damaged. The formula in the bottle was terrible... Definitely not the real Stay Don&#x27;t Stray formula.</li>
    <li> Thankfully I didn&#x27;t pay full price for this, a sample was included in a beauty box by Sephora. I saw no difference in liner or concealer smudging. Very disappointing. Even worse, it made my eyelids red and puffy after one use. I&#x27;ve never had this problem before, but must have a sensitivity to something in the product.</li>
    <li> this was the first eyelid primer i ever tried, and it actually made my creases worse than when i only wore the eyeshadow (velvet eyeshadow by benefit). i have really oily eyelids as my makeup creases very fast, but this product did not help. i really tried to like it and use it - i tried using less/more product, but nothing really worked. the reviews are true about the dispenser, also - definitely a pain in the butt unless you&#x27;ve mastered the &#x27;half pump&#x27; to not get an excess of product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i bought this at sephora and exchanged it for too faced&#x27;s shadow insurance, and it has worked much better for me. i hear a lot of people swear by THIS product, so it probably just depends on your skin. for me, didn&#x27;t work. i gave it two stars since when it was under my eye, it did a satisfactory job of actually concealing, even though it&#x27;s only supposed to serve as a concealing base. also was a good color when it was on my lids.</li>
    <li> If anyone thinks this is a replacement for Benefit FY Eye (since this is the product that now comes up if you search for FY Eye): Don&#x27;t Believe It! This is nothing like it. Very disappointing. It doesn&#x27;t work well as a base. Impossible to squirt out a small amount. Actually makes creases worse. Ugh. Benefit, please bring back FY Eye.</li>
    <li> My primary primer is Urban Decay Primer Potion Original. But, that one is a colorless primer. They make a tinted version called \\&quot;Eden\\&quot;, and that is what Stay Don&#x27;t Stray most closely resembles. I did not know that Stay Don&#x27;t Stray was a colored product or I would not have even bothered to purchase it; I don&#x27;t need a primer that is also a concealer. I just want some eyelid glue for my eye makeup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Before you use this, if you plan to leave the house, make sure you exfoliate any dry patches around your eyes, where you plan to use this. I promise that you won&#x27;t notice how dry stuff looks until AFTER you are gone and can&#x27;t do anything about it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Expect that no matter how carefully you try to gently press the pump, it&#x27;s going to dispense way more than you can use, and there is nothing you can do about it. This was frustrating to me. As expensive as this stuff is and I have to wash half of it off my hands every time I use it? No thanks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Benefit&#x27;s product has an opaque coverage that is very fair; even on my pasty face it was pretty light. I can&#x27;t imagine how this would show up on someone of darker coloring, it would probably look ghost-like. It was not as drying as the UDPP Eden, however it sure did showcase any dry areas I did have. And it stung all around my eye area!! This made my eyes water. Already by this point I had decided to return it. Nothing short of miraculous color retention was going to make me keep it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wear: Not too bad. I did notice more emphasis on lines under my eyes after awhile, and I normally don&#x27;t stick concealer under my eyes so I can only blame the Stay Don&#x27;t Stray. I would say overall I am much happier with Urban Decay&#x27;s Original primer for wear. I would not use UD Eden under my eyes, nor am I happy how the Stay Don&#x27;t Stay looks under my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PRO&lt;br /&gt;Sanitary packaging&lt;br /&gt;Covers discolorations&lt;br /&gt;Not as drying as Urban Decay Primer Potion Eden&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CON&lt;br /&gt;Incredible waste of the product and there&#x27;s nothing you can do about it&lt;br /&gt;Not as long-wearing as Urban Decay Primer Potion Original&lt;br /&gt;Stung my eyes&lt;br /&gt;Must make absolutely sure that you have no residual dry areas where the product will be used&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m returning it and won&#x27;t repurchase or recommend.oduct and there&#x27;s nothing you can do about it&lt;br /&gt;Not as long-wearing as Urban Decay Primer Potion Original&lt;br /&gt;Stung my eyes&lt;br /&gt;Must make absolutely sure that you have no residual dry areas where the product will be used&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m returning it and won&#x27;t repurchase or recommend.</li>
    <li> I have VERY pale skin.  I&#x27;m talking not even pasty.  Beyond white.  Sour cream blue maybe.  And this stuff is GREAT for me.  I use it as a concealer and top it off with mineral powder, and the combination really covers my dark circles better than anything I have ever tried (and believe me, I have tried EVERYTHING).    That being said, for anybody with darker skin than I have (in other words, 99.99% of the population) I imagine that this stuff is pretty useless.  It was pretty stupid of benefit to make a concealer-esque product for one skin tone.  Even band-aids probably match skin tones better than this stuff.    So again, if you are super pale like me and use a powder, this stuff is great and comes highly recommended.  If you are not super pale, it probably won&#x27;t work.</li>
    <li> Love this product.&lt;br /&gt;It does exactly what it promises.&lt;br /&gt;Even though it&#x27;s a little pricey, it&#x27;s worth it. A little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> I use it all the time.  It color corrects, it can be used 360 degrees around the eyes.  I like using it to reduce the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles around my eyes.</li>
    <li> I am a true believer in this product! I use it every day and it provides a nice concealer for under my eyes and helps my eye shadow stay in place.</li>
    <li> I had a sample of this product from Sephora, and I loved it -- which is why I looked for the full product.  It&#x27;s so expensive to buy from them, so I found it through Amazon.  To my dismay, when I began pumping it (the sample had an applicator, which I like must better), it was water.  I tried shaking vigorously hoping that the water and the primer would mix, but they won&#x27;t.  A hard lesson.  I will only buy this product directly from Sephora now -- some things you truly get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> I bought this since my HG primer (Two Faced Shadow Insurance) started giving me a rash on my lids.  (Luckily I was later to return to using TFSI with no ill effects).  This works ok but not great.  Hate the applicator, doesn&#x27;t go on too smoothly.  It is better than no primer but I still get creases on my eyeshadow after a few hours.  I do feel it is gentler on the skin, so if you have sensitive skin, it is worth trying to see how it works for you, esp since I see Amazon has trial sizes.</li>
    <li> I love it. It really works well. I will buy more in the future. I wondering about the other products of this brand?!</li>
    <li> This is a great eye primer for flawless eye makeup.. This product is great to cover up any redness or dark circles.</li>
    <li> This is wonderful as a primer, or as an eye shadow itself.  No creases.  Smooth.</li>
    <li> To be honest, this is a product I would have never thought of buying by itself.  I received it in a package full of other Benefit makeup things and I absolutely love it.  I also have oily eyelids so by the time noon rolls around, I look like a cross between half raccoon half human or that I&#x27;ve been holed up in my office watching sappy movies.  After using this product, my eyeliner and mascara stay put.  I&#x27;ve actually received compliments after using it \\&quot;I don&#x27;t know what&#x27;s different about you, but your face looks more awake\\&quot; (yes, it&#x27;s because my makeup is staying put).  I have medium to darker skin so a little goes a long way.  It really brightens your appearance.  I&#x27;ve  used it with and without eyeshadow and it is marvelous.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my sister. She says it works wonderfully. She says: concealers and eyeshadows STAY PUT. This is the second time she purchase this product.</li>
