      <li>Love it.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s OKAY, but I find that the mortar and pestle work better</li>

      <li>Has wing-nut top for easy twisting.</li>
      <li>The smooth surfaces do not permit sufficient pulverizing ability for effective crushing..</li>
      <li>You do need to clean regularly for it to work the best.</li>

      <li>and it&#x27;s a real nice blue too.  </li>
      <li>When I try to close the crusher with a large pill inside, I&#x27;ll perfectly align the top, but the top keeps cross threading.</li>

      <li>SWEET !</li>
      <li>Depending on the type of pills, size, and amount of pills would determine how easy it is to crush.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Very strong little pill crusher. Works great!</li>
    <li> Works amazing. Crushes pills to a fine powder, even large ones. I think the issues with these comes to operator error, no pill cutter needed. I uses this for fast relief die to pain from shoulder surgery I had twice due to grafts failing. Even with out being able to crank down I get powdered sugar consistency.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To use:&lt;br /&gt;1. Unscrew and insert pill of choice&lt;br /&gt;2. Screw cap until pill cracks&lt;br /&gt;3. Unscrew enough for pill prices to shift&lt;br /&gt;4. Screw down again until slightly past the point where you feel resistance&lt;br /&gt;5. Repeat 3 and 4 till pill is powdered&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You DONT have to crank down in this and risk hurting yourself or breaking the device. My methkbd has never failed, and takes 1-2 minutes maximum and don&#x27;t have to put much effort in. The jar is clear so it easy to tell how crushed the pills are. You can also shift it around to make sure all the pill prices are crushed. The external threading ensure that you wont waste valuable meds to being stuck to the unit and the clean up is way easier. The only pill crusher I have ever used, and the only one I will ever use in the future.</li>
    <li> Crushes pills as it should.</li>
    <li> Came quickly and works well.</li>
    <li> This product is great for crushing pills especially &#x27;vitamin&#x27; size pills...great investment if a person wants to consume dietary supplements &amp; medication quick for better absorption &amp; better results.....!</li>
    <li> Works great!  Turns the pill into powder in a matter of seconds.</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;ve used other pill crushers, you can easily see how this design is superior. It&#x27;s working great for me so I definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> I had one identical to this one for many years. It finally went it&#x27;s way and I was pleased to find this replacement. A word of caution!  When crushing a pill, stop when the top feels tight...then loosen the lid a bit, give the container a little shake, then tighten the lid again to complete.  I have a small dog on medication.  She refuses a pill.  When I crush her pill and mix it with a little cream cheese, she takes it like a treat!</li>
    <li> Had a different pil crusher and it was hard to crush bigger pills. I bought this one because the dog destroyed the other one and I love this one. It does well on bigger pills</li>
    <li> I get this pill crusher and use it twice, and the top cracks in half.... I don&#x27;t know if it was just my unit or what, but I think it&#x27;s poorly made.</li>
    <li> I sent this to my 89 year old mother and she was able to use it easily. Great product!</li>
    <li> This little gadget is really great.  Previously I have chewed most vitamins &amp; pills.  I do not swallow pills.  Much neater than putting in a sandwich bag &amp; smashing with a hammer, too.  I do have small hands with minimal strength and the other ravages of age, but found it easy to use anyway.</li>
    <li> When I try to close the crusher with a large pill inside, I&#x27;ll perfectly align the top, but the top keeps cross threading. When I&#x27;m finally able to get the top to screw down correctly, I have to REALLY bear down hard - and keep screwing and unscrewing to finally get the pill to break in half. After continuing to screw and unscrew, the pill will break into smaller pieces. After the pill has broken into small pieces, continuing to screw and unscrew will reduce the pill to powder. I have STRONG handles. I can open jars that others cannot. This will definitely not work for someone with arthritis or weak hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My solution was to use a splitter in 2 directions, then crush 1 pill at a time. I&#x27;m doing this for someone who takes 29 pills a day. Too much effort! So I&#x27;m returning it and will go back to splitting the pills and crushing all of the pills at once with a mortar/pestle. Please, if anyone has had better success with a different crusher, let me know.</li>
    <li> For the purpose of crushing chewable tablets (to make easyer to mix into food/ drink for a young child) this product is great and works like a charm. It was the best purchase I&#x27;ve made!!</li>
    <li> This one crushes the pills fast &amp; better than the one I had before. It is hard on my hands thoughn. I have R. A. I hope it lasts longer than the other brand I bough.</li>
    <li> This crusher is easy to use and crushed pills well, but the resultant powder gets stuck in the tip of the cone-shaped well.</li>
    <li> This pill crusher works great!!  The reason this pill crusher works so well is that the bottom of the blue part goes to a point rather than just being a flat surface like so many pill crushers.  I have to crush multiple pills 3 times per day, and I can crush all of them EASILY at the same time with this pill crusher.  Don&#x27;t be fooled by the inexpensive price... this pill crusher truly does what it&#x27;s supposed to.</li>
    <li> Works like a charm!!&lt;br /&gt;Just perfect!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been taking care of my wife for the last 10 years. She was in a devastating car accident when she was just 19. I got lucky and bought this as my first pill crusher, so I was clueless as to how others performed. Last week, it finally broke (after 10 years!) and I was forced to grab whatever the local pharmacy had. I purchased 2 different kinds and both were inferior in every way possible. I crush 10-15 pills a day for her, some of them are pretty big. There are two major points that make this pill crusher the best I&#x27;ve used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. External threads.  It&#x27;s unbelievable but a lot of pill crushers have internal threads. What&#x27;s the difference? After you crush the pill with an internally threaded crusher, the powder gets caught up in the groves of the threads making it difficult to get the full dose out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. Smooth crushing platform. Some pill crushers have little dents like a meat pounder (little teeth) used to crush the pills. Same problem. A lot of the powder and smaller parts of the pill get stuck between the teeth making it hard to get all of the powder out. This pill crusher has a smooth point used to crush the pills and only the finest of dust sticks to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only drawback to this pill crusher is it can be hard to crush larger pills. This isn&#x27;t an issue for me but for some it may be. One solution is to use a pill cutter and crush half at a time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This pill crusher lasted me 10 years of hard use and allows for the actual dose of medication to be administered.</li>
    <li> I have been purchasing this pill crusher for years.  But have to have family purchase it for me because I can&#x27;t find it were I live.  So I am happy to see I can order it online.  A lot of the reviews complain about difficult use and breakage.  With the hard coated pills I find that once the pill cracks open the crushers and shake the pill around and then slowly screw and unscrew the cap.  It does eventually break the pill down far enough to crush it sufficiently.  The one and only downside I have had with this crusher is it does eventually break.  As I have been looking for pill crushers for 15yrs of my life now this has been the best option by far.  a couple things I found to help lengthen the life of the crusher is to wipe it out after ever use.  The build up of the pill dust causes to much extra friction and force to the crusher.  Tylenol based products cause the most harm long term if not washed.  They break down into very fine powder and eventually cause to much friction/force on the crusher and cracks will start.  I buy 2/yr.  I also have used spoons in the past to get my pills crushed.  Hopefully this was helpful to those you looking.</li>
    <li> I just bought this at a local pharmacy and after using it for the second time it cracked as I was turning the top. I would not recommend this product!</li>
    <li> My son is special needs and has several pill medications that we have to crush and dissolve in water and put through his G-tube.The medicines have to be crushed well so they don&#x27;t clog up the tube. He has one particular medication that has a tough coating and is hard to crush. We put about 2 or 3 pills at a time and crush and they get pulverized enough that we don&#x27;t have to wait too long for them to dissolve.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pill crushers we were purchasing at our local stores would break easily and had ridges on both sides so powder would get stuck in the chamber. At almost $5/each, we were having to replace them constantly which was getting really annoying. I don&#x27;t know how many we have gone through, so I finally decided to look for an alternative. I ordered 3 and after over a month, all of them are still in tact. They are small and strong, so they travel well. Can&#x27;t beat this price, either!</li>
    <li> This crusher works great!  Low price and fast shipping is also a plus.  This crushes large pills and makes them easy to get down.  I would highly recommend this pill crusher.</li>
    <li> PERFECT FOR YOUR PILL CRUSHING NEEDS</li>
    <li> This will crush pills but depending on how hard the pills are, it can be really difficult to turn the handle enough times.  And even if you try opening and closing it multiple times (which does seem to help) sometimes it gets stuck in the closed position.  I consider myself fairly strong, but am often asking my husband for help to open it back up...  I will look for another version that doesn&#x27;t rely on my strength to crush the pill.</li>
    <li> the product arrived promptly and works very well.  it is easy to use by my elderly mother who has some loss of hand strength.  it is much better than another crusher we had which did not completely crush pills and was not as easy to turn.  recommend highly.</li>
    <li> i got this to crush my toddlers vitamins and it works great!</li>
    <li> I have tried several &amp;#34;crushers&amp;#34; this one really gets the job done with minimal effort !! Less stress on hands &amp; wrists.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s OKAY, but I find that the mortar and pestle work better</li>
    <li> this product sucks,you need to have a very strong hand to twist and crush the pills. I have to have my husband crush them for me its just a really bad product</li>
    <li> Should be a little bigger for some larger pills.</li>
    <li> Had two previously exactly like this. One got old and needed another one to replace it. Love it. I like the cone-shaped crusher than a flat bottom crusher. Makes crushing pills easier.</li>
    <li> Really great pill crushed.it pulverized the pill to dust. Which works great when you have to give it to a cat which ain&#x27;t easy.it even has a little compartment on it in case you want to crush extra and store it and have it ready to go or storage for the pills that you have to crush later.</li>
    <li> works well you will lose a few grains of powder due to adherence to the plastic  material but is very sturdy and should hold up with minimal care I use it to grind 500 mg Bute tabs and it does that well</li>
    <li> Excellent quality! Just as I expected.</li>
    <li> After researching these pill crushers I settled on this one because of the price and the suggested ease of use. What I&#x27;ve learned:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. It&#x27;s easy to use use.&lt;br /&gt;2. It has a large handle and doesn&#x27;t take a lot of strength to crush unless you try to do too many at once. First try I was foolish enough to try 6 pills at once. 1-2 is the max I&#x27;d try at a time.&lt;br /&gt;3. It crushes into a fairly fine powder.&lt;br /&gt;4. I like how you can store your pills the night before in it.&lt;br /&gt;5. It&#x27;s a great Value.&lt;br /&gt;6. If it ever needs replacing I&#x27;ll definitely be buying it again.</li>
    <li> very good for small or one half pills.&lt;br /&gt;I use mine to medicate a cat unknowingly in its food</li>
    <li> Works well.  The pill crusher is made of high quality, heavy molded plastic.  There is also a cap on top of cover that holds your pills which is a great option if you carry this while traveling.  Only issue with this pill crusher is that sometimes it will crush a part of the pill into a hard little pancake so you may have to break up large pills first or turn and un-turn the cap a few times.</li>
    <li> This thing is awesome! Powders pills in seconds, no chunks, no spoons,no loss!</li>
    <li> Crushes the baby aspirin into a fine powder for addition to my cat&#x27;s food-as her vet recommended.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t crush up my pills and put this in my purse because the powdered pill leaks out. It does do what it&#x27;s supposed to tho. So it&#x27;s not a complete waste of money.</li>
    <li> I use it for my mother with dementia, and if she can feel the smallest grain will spit it out. This product does not pulverize pills and only ( with repeated difficulty) does turn them into sand sized granules.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I was hoping for - excellent quality for the price. Simply drop your  pill inside and screw the top down a far as you choose depending if you just want to break it up, crush it, or squash it to powder. No mess, no waste, and nothing  splatters - it all stays contained inside the clear plastic cylinder.  SWEET !</li>
    <li> Works great. We use it for a cat&#x27;s pills and makes short work of crushing them.</li>
    <li> This little pill crusher works great!  We have to give crushed calcium tablets to one of our cats and this gets it down fine enough so that we can mix it with a little water and squirt it into his mouth using a small syringe with no clogging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One tip is to twist it to crush -- then untwist slightly and back down again a few times.  It gets all of those last little bits into a powder.</li>
    <li> This is the best crusher I have ever purchased  It pulverizes pills in a few seconds, an even powder to desolve in applesauce (or anything like that). It was the advertized color and had no sharp edges on the lid like some other crushers.</li>
    <li> It is not crashing well, leaving some big traces so you don&#x27;t expect to get a completely powder form! Also its somehow a pain to the hand.</li>
    <li> The best pill crusher I have used. It comes in a plastic bag that does seem a bit raggedy. After a cleaning it works well. You do need to clean regularly for it to work the best. It comes in a small compartment hole on top of the crusher to put pills in for later use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You put the pills in the crusher and twist and keep turning. Depending on the type of pills, size, and amount of pills would determine how easy it is to crush. An average of two pills with no or little coating can take about less than 30  seconds to split, 2 minutes to crush roughly, 15 minutes to crush well, 30 minutes to crush finely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish it come with a splitter to make it easier to actually split the pills in half or quarters. I also think it needs some kind of softer edges.</li>
    <li> It certainly pulverizes pills. The only problem is that it is hard to the pulverized pill out of the container. The residue gets stuck in the grooves and makes it difficult to get out.</li>
    <li> All pill cuters and crushers can be problematic.  With threads on outside, if you get it started right all is well.  Indentation at bottom of inside make it problematic when trying to cut caplets.</li>
    <li> My grandfather has a pill he needs crushed up to his food daily so i bought this for him b.c their so expensive in the drug store. This works great for him, the little handles on the side he says help him alot and make it much easier for him to use.</li>
    <li> Love!!! Use this for my senior kitty. I crush her pills into powder and mix them into her soft food. She doesn&#x27;t notice at all! ;)</li>
    <li> Makes pills into powder.  Does what it says, will packed and timely sent.  Good design, could use a bit bigger &#x27;ears,&#x27; but the price and quality is excellent.</li>
    <li> It gets the job done. Kind of hard on the hands but I think they all would be. Priced right.</li>
    <li> Good quality and construction. This really pulverizes the pill. I care for peoples pets, and the pets are completely clueless there is medicine in their food. Nothing to spit out! Neat little place to store a few pills on the top of the cap too. Love it!</li>
    <li> works very well,crushes my pills to a powder.&lt;br /&gt;very easy to use ,made with strong plastic.&lt;br /&gt;there is even a little compartment on the top to store pills.</li>
    <li> My vitamins are so large that they&#x27;re hard to swollen, so I decided to instead crush them and mix them into my protein shakes. I bought this because it became a pain to crush the vitamins using two spoons. With this product, I can quickly and effortlessly get the job done. Definitely recommend it. (Plus, it&#x27;s very durable!)</li>
    <li> I had to stack the pills to crush them and I still wasn&#x27;t strong enough.</li>
    <li> This is my first pill crusher and it definitely will be the last. This thing is built well and does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to.</li>
    <li> Takes brute strength to crush the pills.  Have tried with several different pills.  Not worth the money.</li>
    <li> Since I can&#x27;t have anti-inflammatories, I used this crusher when I came home from the hospital to crush the pain meds they gave me upon discharge.  Works PERFECTLY.</li>
    <li> It crushes the pills just fine. You pretty much have to put one pill in at a time in order to make sure that its crushed to a fine grain.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I wanted...</li>
    <li> I use this to crush my dog&#x27;s heart medication.  He is a chihuahua and also has tracheal collapse so I can&#x27;t trick or force him into eating pills.  This makes them into powder which I then conveniently sneak into a little wet dog food or minced chicken.  The screw tracks are on the outside of the container so the powder doesn&#x27;t get stuck in there.  Crushing pills does leave some of the medicine behind since it is powder but I doubt it&#x27;s enough to worry about decreasing a dosage.  I love this tool, it makes it so easy to crush my little guy&#x27;s pills!</li>
    <li> I needed a pill crusher to help with medicine for my pets.  And this bad boy does the job nicely.  Just put the pill in the container.  Give the top a few twists.  Bam! Instant powdered pills.  The &amp;#34;wings&amp;#34; on the cap make it easy to twist the top portion.</li>
    <li> For my purposes, this is the perfect little pill crusher. I looked all over in stores and could not find one as compact and ideally suited for crushing pills. It is not a pill splitter, but that is not what I use it for. Very sturdy. Will outlast the user if not abused. Has wing-nut top for easy twisting.</li>
    <li> This pill crusher pretty much pulverizes your average tablet. However, when It comes to a certain really hard double-coated pill that I&#x27;ve been unsuccessfully trying to crush with multiple products, it again just barely cracks the surface, even when I tighten the screw full-force. If only the wings on the blue part were significantly longer, and the clear part had similar wings to hold on to, I would probably get enough leverage to crush this pill without drawing blood from my fingers.</li>
    <li> Use it to crush dog medication to add to their food.. Works great!</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t believe i found this again i had one ten years ago and nothing works as good</li>
    <li> After crushing a hard pill, one still has to break up the very flattened pill. This is easy to do but does require that extra step.</li>
    <li> This may work OK for small or medium sized pills, but it doesn&#x27;t work well for large ones.  I tried to crush a glucosamine pill, and after trying for 20 Minutes, I finally gave up on it.</li>
    <li> I love this little device!  Crushes pills so well.  I have to crush pills to add to my cat&#x27;s food each day and this makes the job fast and easy!</li>
    <li> I was slightly worried by some of the reviews, but after receiving the item, I am very happy.  I had a rather thick pill I needed crushed (have always had issues swallowing the bigger ones) and this thing did it in absolutely no time at all.</li>
    <li> Should have paid attention to the reviews because in this case they are very accurate.  Not even worth the few dollars this cost.</li>
    <li> Does just what it is supposed to do! There is even a little compartment in the top (blue) piece for pill storage. My only complaint is that it is a little larger and heavier than I expected, but it&#x27;s certainly not &amp;#34;massive&amp;#34;. It can still be easily stored in your pocket or purse.</li>
    <li> Works well, crushes puppy meds well.</li>
    <li> I use this to crush and pulverize my son leuvocorin  pill which is small  but it makes it into a fine dust. It&#x27;s great and affordable .i, glad I got it</li>
    <li> Bought this to crush fish pellets that are too large for my fish. A fairly easy task. No matter if it&#x27;s full or half full it does not crush more than the thinnest layer. I see what appears to be more rivets to tighten, it appears, but only goes half way down. So I now use it to store the pellets I crush manually, which is very time consuming and less then perfect. So I imagine a pill would be less then crushed as well.</li>
    <li> I would have rated it a 5 but if you have a bigger pill you can&#x27;t crush other pills with it. Even smaller pills you can only do two at a time. It&#x27;s much better than the pill crusher that I bought at WalMart.</li>
    <li> The lid has to be adjusted a lot before it fits into the threading. People who have to pulverize their medications are mostly older and like me have arthritis in their hands and fingers. After two painful struggles I gave up on it and went back to the old fashioined but much more efficient pestle and mortar.</li>
    <li> Takes a lot of strength in one&#x27;s hands to crush really hard pills. Softer ones do fine.</li>
    <li> Read the reviews wasn&#x27;t sure it would live up to positive feedback but, it does. Took a large tablet for our pup and it smashed it into fine powder without hardly any effort. I was expecting it to be hard to turn as it crushed the tablet but it was not difficult, quite the opposite. Very easy to use, highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I am giving this two stars because it doesn&#x27;t really do anything to make crushing the pills easier. The amount of energy you must use to crush one pill is excessive. I can do better with two large spoons or a rock.  It is plastic and when you turn the screws to crush the pill, at times it will lose its threading and pop off the threads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I should have stuck with my two large spoons. YOU get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> would have been better if it could turn after contact with pills instead of coming to a stop.won&#x27;t buy again</li>
    <li> Does the job as intended.  Just put the pill in and screw the top down.  Very easy and effective. Extra word.</li>
    <li> Crushes. Only put in about two pills, otherwise they don&#x27;t crush. But works as designed.</li>
    <li> I like this crusher, it does what it promises. Not too much effort is needed although sometimes I feel that I need to crush the pills twice as some of the pills are coated. The crushed powder will sometimes cling to the blue top part and I needed to remove it by hand using my fingers.&lt;br /&gt;After the crushing is done I use water to make sure it is clean. It doesn&#x27;t take long to dry, you can also use the dishwasher if needed.</li>
    <li> Difficult to get the cap to twist on properly, Cap goes part way and stops and does not crush the pill.  Works after many attempts but I will purhase another type of pill crusher.  Hopefully, one that works..  Do not reommend this one.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my dogs medicine and it worked really well. It was very simple and easy to use.</li>
    <li> This crusher was less expensive than I expected. It is good value for the cost. After using it, I have discovered that I want a pill crusher that also has teeth so that it is easier to pulverize the pills. This crusher also works best if you only crush one pill at a time. I will continue to use this as it is large and easier to grasp when turning than many others.</li>
    <li> I use this to crush supplements that I add to my smoothies. It is easy to use and clean and creates a nice fine powder.</li>
    <li> This works well with uncoated pills.  Take your time and just work the crusher by screwing in the cap/crusher and it will do the job.  This design does have the advantage of straight side walls so you do not encounter the problem of pill residue building up on the inside of internal grooves and impeding its future use as reported with other lesser pill crushers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just keep in mind that coated pills require extra work and be aware the coating will separate while the pill is being crushed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While this is sturdy little unit for its intended use, it is plastic and not invincible.  It will eventually break or crack due to repeated use, but that will be down the road as long as you don&#x27;t abuse it.  For the price, you get a pill crusher that does what it is suppose to do.</li>
    <li> Works perfect for crushing lysine pills for my cat.  Flavored and powdered lysine is very expensive, and the pill form is super cheap.  I just put one pill in the crusher, turn it to powder, and mix it into her food.</li>
    <li> i have a condition that requires me to crush one of the &amp;#34;horse&amp;#34; pills i have to take daily. i used to struggle to break them up with a knife or snap them with my fingers but not the way to go. i picked up my first crusher at our local pharmacy it worked fine for about a year then the threads finally went. so i got this to replace it. this one is smaller, easier to get your hands around. it feels somewhat substantial, not some cheap plastic but a &amp;#34;better type&amp;#34; that i expect to hold up at least as long as my last crusher if not longer. for someone with arthritis or has a hard time gripping things i highly recommend this.</li>
    <li> What a waste of 7-$8 because this thing has little teeth but looks just like old one that used to be $5. So they added something to make it useless to make poweder from pills, then upped the price on thir garbage. Look carefully at the product I wouold even go into the store and take them out of the package to make sure they aren&#x27;t stopped with teeth that supposidly \\&quot;obliderate pills\\&quot; well what are  all these chunks????</li>
    <li> My friend and I both have one now! He has had it for over a year and I decided to get one due to how good his works!! They are great! can crush any \\&quot;pill\\&quot;. only ones it wont crush are the ones that are like gum.</li>
    <li> It does what it says it does. Only you have to really keep turning it back and forth to get it to crush all the way.</li>
    <li> This is a great product that works as expected leaving minimal residue and does the job with crushing the big tablets hard to swallow so I can sneak the medicine in my child&#x27;s food! :)</li>
    <li> Yes, I am a Doctor of Veterinary Medicine, and although I do not crush pills every day, when I do, I reach for one of six of these that I own.  Yes, I am a bit OCD as well.  It is my way.</li>
    <li> My daughter has a thyroid condition and needs medication in order for her thyroid to function properly. This is by far the best pill crusher I have used. It turns the pill into powder and makes giving her the medication so much easier. I would highly recommend this to anyone who has trouble swallowing pills or has a baby that needs medication.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t expect much of this product but to crush some pills and I&#x27;m having a hard time doing that with just a few aspirin. I&#x27;m disappointed because the lid doesn&#x27;t connect with the bottom threads. I would find a different product.</li>
    <li> The picture for this product is misleading. It is difficult trying to crush large pills.  The lid locks crooked very easily making it difficult to open. It is also uncomfortable to hold while turning because there is no cushioning on the handles. This is not the product for people with large hands.</li>
    <li> For smaller pills. No big vitamins can fit.</li>
    <li> I believe the crusher would be more efficient if the pulverizing surfaces would be dimpled instead of smooth. The smooth surfaces do not permit sufficient pulverizing ability for effective crushing..&lt;br /&gt;Due to my physical weakness, I am unable to develop sufficient torque to pulverize my hard-shelled Metformin tablets.</li>
    <li> Completely crushes tablets into a fine powder. Just what I was looking for. Threading is on the outside so it minimizes loss of powder.</li>
    <li> Please don&#x27;t make this product an &amp;#34;Add On&amp;#34; only. I did that including a bottle of vitamins and never got the crusher.</li>
    <li> glad I have this, especially to take potasium.</li>
    <li> Size isn&#x27;t large enough for large (vitamin) sized pills.</li>
    <li> Love it. Works great on all pills. If the pill is large. it still works. You just have to give it and extra turn and squeeze</li>
    <li> Every morning I fix my two cats their breakfast. One has arthritis and needs to have a pill to help with his joints. Although the pill is chewable, have you ever try to MAKE a cat take a pill? I use this to crush the pill and sprinkle it on top of his breakfast. It does a nice job crushing it to a nice powder, and there is little to no resistance when it comes to crushing the pill. There is a pill holder in the lid in the event you are traveling or going out for a meal. If you need to crush pills, this is very nice.</li>
    <li> My daughter has an arthritic cat who needs daily pills. While there are capsules available to open and sprinkle, they are more expensive than the chewable variety. Unfortunately, cats are NOT big fans of these, so to ensure he gets them, she grinds them up and sprinkles them on moist food in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first try, she cut these up and they ground up perfectly. The second try, she left them whole and simply closed the crusher. There was some mild resistance at first, but it crushed the tablet thoroughly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of the best parts is being able to store pills in the lid for easy carrying. I suspect that this isn&#x27;t perfect for every use, but for our use it is an excellent solution.</li>
    <li> Works for me.  Used about a week now and turns pills into powder.  Have only tried on one type of pill so do not know how would do on various pills.</li>
    <li> I actually bought this for my dgt but my friend had one for her dgt and it finally broke, so I gave her mine.  Oh well, I will reorder someday.</li>
    <li> This pill crusher is larger than I expected, but that&#x27;s a good thing, because it makes it easy to hold and use.  It&#x27;s about as big around as a standard doorknob. Just unscrew the top, drop your pill(s) inside, then screw the lid back on to crush the pills.  I&#x27;ve discovered that it works better if you twist the cap back and forth, as opposed to just turning it until tight, and then expecting your pills to be perfectly crushed.  Tightening and loosening the cap repeatedly yields better results, with more finely crushed pills.  For reference, the crusher can fit one large size Alka-Seltzer tablet with a little room to spare.  I can fit a couple large pills in there, but honestly, it&#x27;s easier to crush them 1 at a time if the pills are too large.  If they&#x27;re small, you could probably do 5 or 6 at once.  The screw threads on the 2 pieces have nice, thick grooves, so it&#x27;s easy to line up the 2 pieces properly.  Just be aware that I got mine from GroupMedShop (fulfilled by Amazon) and while it came really fast, there was NO retail packaging as pictured.  It just came in a sealed plastic wrap. It still looked new and unused, but I would have preferred to know up front that it was not retail packaging.  I cleaned it real good just to be safe.  Oh, and BONUS -- there&#x27;s a nifty compartment on the top of the blue piece to keep pills inside, and it even has a cover to keep the compartment closed.  Nice!  Overall, I&#x27;m really happy with it.  Exactly what I wanted and it&#x27;s a real nice blue too.  Thumbs up!</li>
    <li> This pill crusher is aptly named &amp;#34;pulverizer&amp;#34;. Just pop the pill in the cup and screw on the cap and your medication quickly turns to powder.&lt;br /&gt;Once in pulverized form, I add (fat free, low sodium) chicken broth to the medication so I can pull it up into a syringe to give my cat his daily pill.&lt;br /&gt;Great for &#x27;people pills&#x27; too (^:^)</li>
    <li> Works as promised.  Does a great job, crushes pills as advertised..</li>
    <li> Finally!  After years of frustrating pill crushers here is one that removes all complaints.  With a couple of twists, (and here I recommend you might want to cut a larger pill for easier twisting manipulation), the meds are dust.  No lumps, no accumulation of pill dust in the grooves, nothing getting trapped in unnecessary machinations.  This is a straightforward and highly effective crusher.  It even has a generously sized storage place hidden beneath a flap on the top of the lid.  I had my first one for 2 weeks before I realized that space was there!  I couldn&#x27;t recommend this more;  they just kept it really simple.  And strong!  Haven&#x27;t met a pill yet that this little gizmo didn&#x27;t pulvarize with no waste, and little effort. The combo of this, and the equally simple yet efficient deluxe pill cutter - the one with the orange rubberized bit-are a winning team.  Life can be complicated.  These eliminate parts of that annoying small stuff.</li>
    <li> I agree with the other reviews, it is a good product but it is difficult to use with larger pills</li>
    <li> Very difficult to use. It takes a great deal of strength to use this. I would not recommend this for an elderly or disabled person.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this pulverizer for a year or so now.  It is really bad.  I mean it gets the job done, but at what cost?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you don&#x27;t have hands of steel, don&#x27;t purchase this item.  In order to crush zinc pills or even Flintstones Kids Vitamins, I can only put in 1/2 to 1 pill at a time, and then I have to repeatedly torque the top harder and harder, releasing in-between to allow the crushed pill to move, otherwise it cakes together all hard again.  It hurts my hands just to crush one pill.  THEN I have to crush 5 or so more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m getting something with a much better mechanical advantage.</li>
    <li> Just like the name says, this crushes pills, and it does a great job!  I use it to crush my multi-vitamin, which looks like something you might give a horse, and was always a pain to swallow.  Now I take my vitamin powder with some water, and it&#x27;s easy as pie.  This even has a little compartment on the lid (the blue part on the picture) to keep a couple of pills in, which comes in handy for road-trips and such.  Great little device, very easy to crush pills, and cleans up in a jiff.</li>
