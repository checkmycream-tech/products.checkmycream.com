### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>This product seems like it would be best suited for people who don&#x27;t use a hair-care product after washing their hair.  </li>
      <li>I used this after the Fekkai PRX shampoo and PRX mask and got the best results.</li>
      <li>I was impressed by the quality of the shower (&amp;#34;activating&amp;#34;</li>
      <li>--WTF?--and the best place for instructions are the Amazon product reviews.</li>
      <li>While I thought the results were marginal at best, someone did say they noticed a difference, so</li>
      <li>This was quite impressive</li>
      <li>But still the results were impressive.</li>
      <li>I would say I&#x27;m impressed</li>
      <li>Love this product!!!</li>
      <li>Fancy packaging, but not an incredible product to match.</li>
      <li>I guess I should be happy with the results I did get based on some of the reviews I&#x27;ve read here.</li>
      <li>Great product will buy again.</li>
      <li>I got great results</li>
      <li>The product is watery but with a very nice vanilla fragrance.</li>
      <li>The static I had was incredible!  </li>
      <li>In the product description it says to use the formula sparingly and that is definitely good advice.</li>
      <li>Good price but still have to see the result yet.</li>
      <li>You&#x27;re out of the shower and using it on towel-dried hair--what good does putting it in a cap do?</li>
      <li>It almost seemed to be like a glossy veil that lasted a good 2 weeks.</li>
      <li>You&#x27;re out of the shower and using it on towel-dried hair--what good does putting it in a cap do?</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not so sure there&#x27;s anything magic about three days - it seemed to work as well after a day as after three days, but either way I was impressed with the difference.</li>
      <li>The fragrance is lovely too!</li>
      <li>You will have awesome results when you use the systems shampoo and conditioner first.  </li>
      <li>This would be great to use before an event, like a prom or wedding - or even just an important date or event.  </li>
      <li>I did notice it&#x27;s more shiny, so that&#x27;s good.</li>
      <li>The oil made my hair smell wonderfully and feel much softer, but once I stopped using the oil, any improvements disappeared almost immediately.</li>
      <li>I think most people could get 2 sets of treatments from this kit, making it more cost effective.</li>
      <li>for the results, I feel the most significant result was that my hair did feel good.  </li>
      <li>but when I found it on amazon for 40 dollars I was pleased.</li>
      <li>I was just OK with this product.</li>
      <li>If you have more damaged hair, this Fekkai product may have a more noticeable effect for you.</li>
      <li>/&gt;I&#x27;d buy this if I had say a wedding or event that I knew I had to be able to guarantee my damaged hair looked perfect---especially for curls.</li>
      <li>If that&#x27;s your goal, I love John Frieda</li>
      <li>But, I was expecting more.</li>
      <li>As a temporary fix it&#x27;s good but the price per use isn&#x27;t worth it to</li>
      <li>okay</li>
      <li>After 3 days I did not not notice any improvement in my hair, but I did notice that my hair was more tangled after using this spray.</li>
      <li>It definately gave my hair more body and shine, but that is where it ended.</li>
      <li>My hair was quite a bit softer and behaved much better.  </li>
      <li>I got this hoping that it would help with my split ends and make my hair better looking.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve never had static in my hair before.  </li>
      <li>The hair def. felt softer and more manageable.</li>
      <li>I will try using more to see if that</li>
      <li>so better instructions are def.</li>
      <li>so I can do more treatments.</li>
      <li>After the three day process, I noticed that my split ends were better, and that I was pleased with how well my hair</li>
      <li>Consequently, I won&#x27;t be purchasing more of this product in order to continue the treatment.</li>
      <li>It can get a bit oily so then your hands start to slip from the top of the vial.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>think most of the cost for this product is the packaging.  </li>
      <li>I wanted to love it, but cause of the after effects, it was just ok.</li>
      <li>The first treatment yielded good results</li>
      <li>They get stuck easily and I had to use a lot of force to spray out of the vials.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s important to share that I didn&#x27;t use this three days in a row like it recommends.</li>
      <li>/&gt;The smell is fantastic, as with all Fekkai hair products.  </li>
      <li>This gave me a similar feel, but more diluted... in a good way.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t use anywhere near what the instructions recommend, and have great success with this product.</li>
      <li>: It more time consuming to use than a creme rinse, as you have to spray and spray and spray it on your hair until you&#x27;ve used the right amount.  </li>
      <li>On the first try, probably used more than what was needed, but no harm, no foul.</li>
      <li>First, I must say there should be better instructions.  </li>
      <li>but I didn&#x27;t see a huge difference, most likely because my hair was already in pretty good condition.</li>
      <li>I reviewed that product recently and liked it much better.</li>
      <li>This gives hair a really nice feeling and, unlike a lot of similar products, has a lovely smell.</li>
      <li>The directions say to spray the treatment onto clean hair, put on the shower cap and wait for a bit before styling.</li>
      <li>idea is to have your hair clean and damp when you apply this.</li>
      <li>but they were only as good as what I put on my hair.  </li>
      <li>Instructions on the box are minimal at best, but packaging overall is attractive enough for a gift.  </li>
      <li>You also get a really nice heavy duty plastic hair cap to put on your hair during application process that you just rinse and reuse for each application which is nice in that you don&#x27;t create a lot of garbage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>This formula smelled good, and did not feel like grease or oil (like some other products I have used to control fine, frizzy hair).  </li>
      <li>I have a large head plus a lot of hair and, honestly, most shower caps don&#x27;t fit or the elastic isn&#x27;t strong enough to keep my hair contained without also being in a pony tail or clip of some sort.</li>
      <li>Initial reaction: Very light, not oily, and has a light fragrance.</li>
      <li>love Fekkai product line, my current favorites are shampoo and conditioner for fine hair, their hair spray and also the hair oil.</li>
      <li>Unlike some other treatments, the smell was pleasant.</li>
      <li>Great results for a few days</li>
      <li>it worth the price they&#x27;re asking now?  </li>
      <li>This product is well worth your money.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Definitely worth a try.</li>
      <li>My hair is soft, silky, shiny, and healthy looking after 3 days treatment.  </li>
      <li>For a fraction of the cost you could buy Herbal Essences Wild Naturals Intensive Treatment and get better results.</li>
      <li>It has a pleasant vanilla scent and doesn&#x27;t feel greasy or weigh my hair down.  </li>
      <li>did notice right away that my hair was easier to brush through.</li>
      <li>Each one felt great for awhile, but I haven&#x27;t noticed a clear long term change.</li>
      <li>First, it would have been nice to actually have instructions for use.  </li>
      <li>My hair felt really good on each day that I used it, but the day after, it was back to normal.</li>
      <li>I feel like I could have had better results going with my old standby - a V05 hot oil treatment, which also has the bonus of being cheaper.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m generally a fan of Fekkai products, and so I was looking forward to trying the 3 day transformation kit - and it mostly met my expectations.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I will say that even after the second day, before I showered, my hair was still silky smooth and looked as clean as the day</li>
      <li>I saw and felt zero improvement the first day.</li>
      <li>This product arrived just in time for the real test!  </li>
      <li>washed my hair the first day, and then sprayed the product on.  </li>
      <li>note - while the packaging is a bit excessive for the product size, it sure is cute.</li>
      <li>saw and felt zero improvement the first day.</li>
      <li>I noticed a difference from the first use.</li>
      <li>I followed the directions exactly and didn&#x27;t notice ANY change one way or another.</li>
      <li>From using multiple similar type products over the years, I have found, for the most part, I am better off skipping them, then hoping for a miracle.</li>
      <li>The morning after the first use, I straightened my hair.  </li>
      <li>I saw changes after the first time I used it.  </li>
      <li>thought I&#x27;d remember them because they were pretty easy, but a week later I couldn&#x27;t remember and had already recycled it.</li>
      <li>The smell is quite pleasant and does not last long.</li>
      <li>There were easy to understand instructions printed on the back of the packaging that this set came</li>
      <li>I have medium-length, think, very wavy hair.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This product seems like it would be best suited for people who don&#x27;t use a hair-care product after washing their hair.  The instructions are rather sparse: Basically, shake to mix the product, then spray half of a vial onto clean hair (whether that is just after shampoo or after shampoo and conditioner is unclear), then leave &amp;#34;application cap&amp;#34; (?) on for 5 to 10 minutes, then style, then rinse.  What?  Instead of saying &amp;#34;application cap&amp;#34;--which I interpreted to mean the stuff from the vial that you squirt all over your hair--why not say &amp;#34;leave in hair for 5 to 10 minutes?  (And no, in case anyone is curious, there wasn&#x27;t a shower cap or anything that came with the product.)  So, the product made my hair shiny and soft (like a heavy dose of argan or coconut oil would), but after applying my usual hair-care product, my hair looked about the same as it usually did, only more limp due to the Fekkai product.  Sorry, but I can&#x27;t endorse the so-called wonders of this product.</li>
    <li> After 3 days I did not not notice any improvement in my hair, but I did notice that my hair was more tangled after using this spray. I would not recommend this product.</li>
    <li> This three day leave in hair treatment comes packaged to look like a little chemistry experiment. Inside the hard plastic box (which could be reused) are three &amp;#34;test tubes&amp;#34; of the treatment with spray tops and a plastic shower cap. The directions say to spray the treatment onto clean hair, put on the shower cap and wait for a bit before styling. In the product description it says to use the formula sparingly and that is definitely good advice. The first treatment yielded good results but I think I put too much on the second time and my hair felt slightly greasy that day. I think most people could get 2 sets of treatments from this kit, making it more cost effective. While this product did make my hair softer, it wasn&#x27;t any shinier. For a fraction of the cost you could buy Herbal Essences Wild Naturals Intensive Treatment and get better results. I reviewed that product recently and liked it much better.</li>
    <li> Im giving this four stars because of what it does but it&#x27;s not something I would purchase. As a temporary fix it&#x27;s good but the price per use isn&#x27;t worth it to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I overprocessed my hair with 20 volume toner and it&#x27;s fried. This product arrived just in time for the real test!  It says to use about one vial per use but I got anywhere from 2-3 uses per vial and I have VERY long hair. This did make my dog hair-feeling texture silky and soft and shiny but as soon as I washed my hair it was gone. Even at two uses per vial (six total) I can get leave-in products for far, far cheaper than $3.50 per use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have lightly to moderately damaged hair you&#x27;ll probably like this. It says to use on damp hair three days in a row---don&#x27;t think you have to WASH your hair, just wet it down very well and put it in a towel til it&#x27;s mostly damp dry to avoid further damage from over shampooing.  Again my hair was maximum fried and the six times I used this I got great results but they were only as good as what I put on my hair.  I get the same results using Milkshake or Kenra leave in spray conditioner and a few pumps of soy renewal argan oil protectant. For far far far less than $3.50 a use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d buy this if I had say a wedding or event that I knew I had to be able to guarantee my damaged hair looked perfect---especially for curls. It made my curls glossy and cohesive. But again I have other products I know I can rely on for a fraction of the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do like Fekkai products. I used this after the Fekkai PRX shampoo and PRX mask and got the best results.</li>
    <li> I was just OK with this product. First of all, each tube is a very small amount. Its says use sparingly, but it really doesn&#x27;t have enough if you have long thick hair. My hair felt really good on each day that I used it, but the day after, it was back to normal. I felt that the price point is a little high for the amount you get and how long the results last. Fancy packaging, but not an incredible product to match.</li>
    <li> I was not a big fan of this for African-American hair. The instructions are to use it for 3 days straight on damp hair, but this posed a serious problem. I have chemically relaxed hair, and wear it styled straight in a wrap. I only wash my hair once weekly, because more frequent washings will lead to serious breakage, and I don&#x27;t like to heat style my hair often. So, I could not use the product for 3 days straight. I did use it once weekly, and possibly noticed slightly less shedding, but no noticeable difference in texture (softness), durability or other positive qualities.</li>
    <li> This gives hair a really nice feeling and, unlike a lot of similar products, has a lovely smell. In fact, it gave me a serious craving for vanilla ice cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Long-term effects of a three-day treatment are hard to discern. It definitely has a positive short-term effect, though. And while it&#x27;s not cheap, it&#x27;s not outrageous as these things go. Give it a try, and even if it doesn&#x27;t do much in terms of permanent repair, it will at least give you a few days of silky smoothness and. . .mmmm, ice cream. . .</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a big fan of Fekkai and that hasn&#x27;t changed after using this. About me: I have very sensitive skin and often react to hair products. I also have very coarse, thick, often dry hair that is colored.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s important to share that I didn&#x27;t use this three days in a row like it recommends. That&#x27;s because I only wash my hair every three days - my hair doesn&#x27;t get oily and red color fades! I did, however, use it three shampoos in a row.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really like this product. I noticed a difference from the first use. I realized I was confused about it... you use it after washing and you don&#x27;t rinse it out. You use the cap for a few minutes to lock in the effect, and then rinse the cap for next time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair felt so silky! I&#x27;ve often used pure argan oil (a main ingredient in this) as a leave-in treatment for my hair. This gave me a similar feel, but more diluted... in a good way. Pure oil can feel heavy, even on my hair, which can take a lot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I bought this product again, I&#x27;d probably just use it as three different treatments. Each one felt great for awhile, but I haven&#x27;t noticed a clear long term change. Again, maybe it would be different if I&#x27;d used it three days in a row. A bit pricy for regular use, but a definite spa treatment for sometimes!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another note - while the packaging is a bit excessive for the product size, it sure is cute. I&#x27;m using the box it came in for cosmetics!</li>
    <li> My hair becomes dull often, as I wash it very frequently, so I&#x27;m sure the build-up is outrageous.  The kit contains Argan extract, which does wonders for hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell is fantastic, as with all Fekkai hair products.  I have not bought one which had a bad scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Use is pretty simple.  Apply and put the cap on for 10min.  Do this 3 days in a row.  I have shoulder length hair and it was simple and easy!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love Fekkai product line, my current favorites are shampoo and conditioner for fine hair, their hair spray and also the hair oil.</li>
    <li> First off, there is no clear indication whether this product was designed for males, but I decided to see if it can tame my sometimes out-of-control hair.  One thing you must know is that they provide a free shower cap that is hidden deeply inside the packaging.  You wear the shower cap for about ten minutes, presumably to activate heat action that puts the product in motion.  Instructions on the box are minimal at best, but packaging overall is attractive enough for a gift.  While I thought the results were marginal at best, someone did say they noticed a difference, so I guess it does work.  However, how often must I repeat this treatment?  The mysterious box does not say...</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t see any noticeable changes but last week my stylist said 2 or 3 times how soft and gorgeous my hair was and asked what I was doing differently. So yes, for this 50 year old, color treated, curly, flat ironed weekly, thick haired user this treatment delivers on it&#x27;s promise.</li>
    <li> This would be great to use before an event, like a prom or wedding - or even just an important date or event.  The results are not long lasting but are very noticeable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In each kit you get three small spray bottles that will last perhaps 3 to 4 applications (maybe 5) depending on your hair length.  You also get a really nice heavy duty plastic hair cap to put on your hair during application process that you just rinse and reuse for each application which is nice in that you don&#x27;t create a lot of garbage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You spray on damp hair,  then put the cap on and leave on for 10 minutes then style as usual.  Right away I could tell my hair was softer and even after blow dried and styled I could still feel the softness.  This was quite impressive I felt.  I was sad however that the results didn&#x27;t last, this isn&#x27;t a long lasting fix - merely a temporary one.  But still the results were impressive.</li>
    <li> I have shoulder length thick highlighted hair.  I did two  days of application of this treatment before I had my hair colored.  This is a set of 3 spray  bottles of argan oil meant to repair damaged hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You apply it mid shaft to the ends of damp clean hair.  I have arthritis and found the sprayers hard to press.  Also with each application, I was unable to finish the container because the sprayer stopped working.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am giving this high marks because my hair stylist said it helped the condition of my hair even though I only applied it twice.  I took off a star because of the problems with the sprayer problems.</li>
    <li> The Fekkai 3 day transformation kit is Infused with Argan extracts and scented with vanilla. You can mix the dual-phase formula to repair damaged hair, and smoothness, shine and strength can return after just three uses.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t do anything :-( usually love fekkai products</li>
    <li> Good price but still have to see the result yet.</li>
    <li> This transformed my slightly curly/often frizzy hair to smooth and sleek without weighing it down. I don&#x27;t use anywhere near what the instructions recommend, and have great success with this product. I keep one in my handbag for humid days. Just a small spritz calms the frizzies right down.</li>
    <li> This is basically a really nice leave-in conditioner...that doesn&#x27;t last very long. I have shoulder length hair that is naturally curly and dry. I used half a tube for each treatment, so I actually got two full treatment cycles (six days worth of use) out of this one package. The shower cap provided with the oil treatment is nice and thick. It works well and helps activate the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My main complaint with this &amp;#34;transformation kit&amp;#34; is that it doesn&#x27;t provide enough of a change in my hair for the price. The oil made my hair smell wonderfully and feel much softer, but once I stopped using the oil, any improvements disappeared almost immediately. Also, though the packaging of this product is ridiculously cute, the small tubes are difficult to hold. Halfway through spraying my hair the necessary amount, the tube became slippery it was nearly impossible for me to keep a grip on the tube while spraying the rest of the oil onto my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I would say that this oil did make my hair softer. But, unfortunately, the slightly positive results didn&#x27;t last very long--and definitely not as long as I would have expected them to given the price. Consequently, I won&#x27;t be purchasing more of this product in order to continue the treatment.</li>
    <li> First, I must say there should be better instructions.  Apply the product and put the cap on for 10 minutes for 3 days in a row. I have short hair so I used 1/2 the recommended amount of one whole bottle per day.  I am a fan of Fekkai products, they worked well with my hair and this item did not disappoint.  My hair is soft, silky, shiny, and healthy looking after 3 days treatment.  I used the product a week ago and my hair still looks great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> These Fekkai treatment vials came in a pack of 3. There is some confusion as to how to use this product so better instructions are def. needed. I have shoulder length hair and used less than half the vial. I washed my hair and sprayed it all over my hair, waited for about 10 min with a cap on my head and then styled as usual with my hair dryer. The hair def. felt softer and more manageable. I still had some frizz but it was even less by the second treatment. I would say I&#x27;m impressed but the results really depend on your regular usage of this product. If you&#x27;re willing to invest in this long term, I would highly recommend this.</li>
    <li> I have medium-length, think, very wavy hair. I think it&#x27;s medium-length, but to be clear, it&#x27;s just about to my shoulders. My hair is oily and already reasonably healthy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The instructions are to use half a tube to a full tube, depending on the length and thickness of your hair.  I used about half a tube for each treatment. Then you have to sit with a cap (included) on your head for 10 minutes, 3 days in a row.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It worked okay but I didn&#x27;t see a huge difference, most likely because my hair was already in pretty good condition. I did notice it&#x27;s more shiny, so that&#x27;s good. Now that I&#x27;m 48, my hair isn&#x27;t as shiny as it used to be so that&#x27;s a bonus, but there are easier ways to get that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The downsides: it&#x27;s a nuisance to get the product on your hair with those small vials and the sitting for 10-minutes every day for 3 consecutive days. If I didn&#x27;t have 3 days off, I would never have done this because who has time for that in the morning? Not me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are easier ways to get shiny hair. If that&#x27;s your goal, I love John Frieda Liquid Clear Hair Shine. It&#x27;s about $8 and takes 20 minutes about twice a month. If you have more damaged hair, this Fekkai product may have a more noticeable effect for you.</li>
    <li> I appreciate that this is relatively quick to apply each day, and even with my thick hair, I felt that half a bottle was enough to coat my hair (thus, allowing 6 applications instead of 3).  The &amp;#34;shower cap&amp;#34; equivalent did help me to feel like I was pampering myself (although it is tight and will show marks in your skin if you don&#x27;t wear it close enough to your scalp).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the results, I feel the most significant result was that my hair did feel good.  My hair was somewhat brighter and prettier, but I thought the difference was not overwhelming.  For example, my hair was not shinier despite the product&#x27;s promises.  I feel like I could have had better results going with my old standby - a V05 hot oil treatment, which also has the bonus of being cheaper.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m generally a fan of Fekkai products, and so I was looking forward to trying the 3 day transformation kit - and it mostly met my expectations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, there&#x27;s way too much in each of the vials for anyone with even long hair. To me, this is a bonus - there&#x27;s enough here for maybe three 3-day transformations. The product is watery but with a very nice vanilla fragrance. It relaxed and smoothed my hair immediately and I could sense a visible difference soon as my hair dried. I&#x27;m not so sure there&#x27;s anything magic about three days - it seemed to work as well after a day as after three days, but either way I was impressed with the difference. Afterward, the effect seems to last at least several days, but as you&#x27;d probably expect, it&#x27;s not permanent, so you need to follow-up once a week or so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely worth a try.</li>
    <li> The morning after the first use, I straightened my hair.  The static I had was incredible!  I&#x27;ve never had static in my hair before.  I will say that even after the second day, before I showered, my hair was still silky smooth and looked as clean as the day before.&lt;br /&gt;The next two times of using it I left my hair curly and let it dry naturally.  No static and my hair does feel smooth. Can&#x27;t say I didn&#x27;t have any frizz.  My hair did poof out a bit after being outside with some wind.  I will say that I only used 1/3 of the bottle for each use.  I will try using more to see if that helps.&lt;br /&gt;I think most of the cost for this product is the packaging.  A large hard plastic container.  It can be used to store things when it&#x27;s empty but, it really is a waste.&lt;br /&gt;Directions for use are very simple.  Just shake, spray on damp hair, put on shower cap (included) for 5-10 mins. But, instructions for use are on the back of the cardboard holder and not on each individual bottle.&lt;br /&gt;Is it worth the price they&#x27;re asking now?  I don&#x27;t think so.  If they simplified their packaging and had it for half the price?, then yes.</li>
    <li> I followed the directions exactly and didn&#x27;t notice ANY change one way or another. Wouldn&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
    <li> This product is well worth your money. My hair has been color treated for years, is very thin, and gets split ends easily.  I am always on the lookout for new ways to try and tame, and thicken up, my thin, color treated frizzy hair.  Your hair will transform in just three days with this kit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I washed my hair the first day, and then sprayed the product on.  I have long hair, and I used a lot of the product-about half the spray pump bottle (you can use less according to the directions for shorter hair).  This formula smelled good, and did not feel like grease or oil (like some other products I have used to control fine, frizzy hair).  You are provided a cap, which you are to wear and put your hair in for five to ten minutes.  After you take off the cap, you style your hair as usual, and leave the product in your hair.  (I don&#x27;t know if you can then use a blowdryer on your hair to style it, I do not use a blowdryer to style my hair after I finish with it.  I just let it dry naturally). I saw changes after the first time I used it.  My hair was fuller, and thicker.  After the three day process, I noticed that my split ends were better, and that I was pleased with how well my hair looked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would buy this product, and definitely use it again.</li>
    <li> Love this product!!! Will buy again!</li>
    <li> Not too shabby. I really thought I was going to notice some type of dramatic change based on earlier reviews I came across. I can&#x27;t say that was the case for me. It definately gave my hair more body and shine, but that is where it ended. It almost seemed to be like a glossy veil that lasted a good 2 weeks. I guess I should be happy with the results I did get based on some of the reviews I&#x27;ve read here.</li>
    <li> From using multiple similar type products over the years, I have found, for the most part, I am better off skipping them, then hoping for a miracle. The Fekkai Prx 3day Transformation Kit falls in the middle ground.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Followed the directions, guessed about the amount my hair needed. On the first try, probably used more than what was needed, but no harm, no foul. Unlike some other treatments, the smell was pleasant. However, it was a little overwhelming ( I am not a huge vanilla smell fan).  Immediately I noticed the difference. My hair felt softer, the usual fizz was pretty contained. Flash forward about an hour, and my hair began to transform into a soft, but greasy mess. Although the directions say to not wash it out, I just had to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Figuring I had probably used too much the first time, the second go around, I used less... Same thing. After about an hour, my hair was greasy. Third try, even less product than second try. The results, again greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know my hair is really picky, so it is hard to blame the product. While it did leave my hair softer and a little bit less frizzy, the greasy side effects were why I had to mark this one down. I wanted to love it, but cause of the after effects, it was just ok.</li>
    <li> Great results for a few days</li>
    <li> Initial reaction: Very light, not oily, and has a light fragrance. My hair felt moisturized after it dried, but the moisturization did not last 24 hours.</li>
    <li> Pros: I feel that this product works because my hair definitely feels softer and looks healthier after using it.  It has a pleasant vanilla scent and doesn&#x27;t feel greasy or weigh my hair down.  There were easy to understand instructions printed on the back of the packaging that this set came in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: It more time consuming to use than a creme rinse, as you have to spray and spray and spray it on your hair until you&#x27;ve used the right amount.  Then you wear the shower cap and let it sit for 5-10 minutes.  At the current price of $22.99, it is pricey and the sturdy plastic box that it&#x27;s housed in is excessive packaging, in my opinion.</li>
    <li> I got this hoping that it would help with my split ends and make my hair better looking. I followed the steps and I have shoulder length, fine/normal hair. I actually used only one tube for all 3 days because while my hair is shoulder length, there isn&#x27;t a lot of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The idea is to have your hair clean and damp when you apply this. You spray it on from mid shaft to ends evenly and then put the activator cap on it for 5-10 minutes. The annoying part is the pump on the vials. They get stuck easily and I had to use a lot of force to spray out of the vials. I ended up using my thumb to get the spray out and a lot of it ended up on my fingers. It can get a bit oily so then your hands start to slip from the top of the vial.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did notice right away that my hair was easier to brush through. I used it all 3 days and looking at my hair, I&#x27;m not noticing anything drastic. The only thing I notice really is that it&#x27;s easier to brush my hair slightly but that&#x27;s about it. I still have 2 other vials so I can do more treatments. I will do a few more in about a week or two and see if it really makes any difference.</li>
    <li> HAIR BACKGROUND&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have very thick wavy hair to the middle of my back. I typically only wash my hair once a week (maybe twice in the summer if I&#x27;ve really been sweating) and usually just rinse it thoroughly. I fully blow-dry and straighten it maybe once or twice a month. It hasn&#x27;t been cut in in over a year (I don&#x27;t get it cut very often anyway, plus we&#x27;ve moved and I hate finding a new stylist) so the ends are in pretty sad shape. If I don&#x27;t put product in my hair, it tends to get quite flyaway as it dries.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THOUGHTS ON PRODUCT&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- The directions are only printed on the outside packaging--AND in very small print. I read them, thought I&#x27;d remember them because they were pretty easy, but a week later I couldn&#x27;t remember and had already recycled it. So I had to search them out. Annoyingly, the actual product website doesn&#x27;t list them at all--WTF?--and the best place for instructions are the Amazon product reviews. So it would be helpful to have the instructions on the bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Speaking of the bottle, I hate the small tubes. Especially since everyone is going to need a different amount, why not just put it in one big bottle? Less waste for sure and more likely a bigger pump which would make it easier. It was a huge PITA to spritz that little bottle and there was always some left that couldn&#x27;t be pumped out. I had planned on using the entire vile per day (since I have lots of hair) but I got tired about 3/4 of the way through. A bigger bottle would also be more convenient to store (tubes don&#x27;t stand up and they obviously roll, so they need to be thrown in a drawer).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;+ The smell is quite pleasant and does not last long. I could only smell it as I was spritzing it. My 6yo son even recognized it as vanilla.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;+ I was impressed by the quality of the shower (&amp;#34;activating&amp;#34;) cap. I have a large head plus a lot of hair and, honestly, most shower caps don&#x27;t fit or the elastic isn&#x27;t strong enough to keep my hair contained without also being in a pony tail or clip of some sort. But this one was large enough and had strong enough elastic that I wasn&#x27;t worried about failure at all. I will definitely keep this to use post-treatment. It has actually saved me the $5 of buying the shower cap I usually use ([[ASIN:B00385WMJ6 Betty Dain Stylish Design Mold Resistant Shower Cap]]). All that said, I don&#x27;t see the point of the cap at all. You&#x27;re out of the shower and using it on towel-dried hair--what good does putting it in a cap do? Maybe keep it damper longer?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;RESULTS&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I saw and felt zero improvement the first day. The second day I noticed that my hair felt a little better, but it didn&#x27;t really help with the flyaways I normally experience. Day three was the best overall, with the ends feeling not nearly as dry and damaged as they usually do. But, this leads me to believe there&#x27;s a cumulative effect, and as expensive as it is, there&#x27;s no way I&#x27;m using this on my hair every day or even every other day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So overall I give it two stars. It did give some results, but not nearly what I&#x27;d hope for at that price and not something I can fiscally continue on a regular basis. Add the bad packaging decisions to that and I just can&#x27;t recommend this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;** Edited 5/10/15 to add a picture of the instructions.

    <li> This product is the same as the power dose I pay 20 dollars for in the salon.  I like it and I would not buy it for 100 dollars but when I found it on amazon for 40 dollars I was pleased. Great product will buy again.</li>
    <li> I am a Fekkai fan!  And I agree with the company when it says to use this product with the shampoo and conditioners, made for this system.  It is made to use in conjunction with  PrX Reparatives Shampoo and Conditioners. You will have awesome results when you use the systems shampoo and conditioner first.  With that being said, I have mid back. long. thicker highlighted hair.  When I used all the products, it did make my hair, shinier and softer. Not sure I want to use it all the time, but would definitely consider it around holidays and special events and occasions.  The fragrance is lovely too!</li>
    <li> Followed the directions - guessed how much to use... and hair was silky every day it was used, but the majority of the effects only lasted throughout the days it was used. It was completely worn off in about 1-1.5 weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Easy to use, and instructions were clear enough. But, I was expecting more. The good thing is that as supplied it should actually be 2 treatments for most people (I have crazy thick, long hair - it was enough coverage for my hair). It really was calming on the days it was used - I might actually use this instead as an as-needed calmer as the glossing effects were really only noticeable on the day of use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line: I&#x27;m on the fence if I would purchase this again.</li>
    <li> I bought this product when Amazon had it on the Deal of the Day.  First, it would have been nice to actually have instructions for use.  There is a little blurb on the back about shaking to activate, but nothing about when to use.  Before shampoo, after conditioner, wet, dry??  And what is the shower cap for?  I had to hunt around the internet reading the reviews of others to find out how to use it, though the use of the protective cap still is unclear to me.  Regardless, after using the entire 3 days of product, I definitely noticed a difference in the texture of my hair.  My hair was quite a bit softer and behaved much better.  Unfortunately, it appears you would have to continue to use the product on a long-term basis to keep the benefits, as after 2 weeks of no use, the benefits are no longer there.  But it certainly did what it advertised for a short period of time.</li>
