      <li>I&#x27;m in love with this Moisturizer, I recommended if you skin is oily is perfect.</li>
      <li>a good choise</li>

      <li>I like it because it is a good light mosturizer.</li>
      <li>and I really love</li>
      <li>Most mattifying products that I&#x27;ve tried before don&#x27;t work for more than 1 hour before the shine seeps through, however, this moisturizer helps keep the glare to a minimum for a longer period of time.</li>
      <li>I love this product and have been using it for years.</li>
      <li>To actually mattify, the best combo I&#x27;ve found is this moisturizer under Cosmedicine Medi Matte.</li>
      <li>Works great under makeup and is gentle on skin, not greasy at all.</li>
      <li>I love this product.</li>
      <li>i love it</li>
      <li>I have deceived by a great deal of products exagerating their sebum absorbing ability.</li>
      <li>I LOVE this product, they changeed the presentation.</li>
      <li>I absolutely LOVE La Roche Posay.</li>
      <li>I´ve been using this product for many years</li>
      <li>I had high hopes for this moisturizer as I&#x27;ve heard great things about the line</li>
      <li>I did a lot of reserach before buying this moisturizer because of my oily skin, but I was not disappointed!</li>
      <li>Even in south Florida&#x27;s most humid days skin stays smooth.</li>
      <li>This product is a light daytime moisturizer.</li>
      <li>La Roche-Posay has never failed me, so why would they now :)  </li>
      <li>but this made my nose SUPER oily</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve heard girlfriends say the Body Shop has a similar product for less money, but after 20 years of searching for the best product for my skin type, now that I&#x27;ve found Effaclar I won&#x27;t use anything else.    </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used many expensive brands before and this is by far the best one I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
      <li>The moisturizer goes on light, not oily at all, and dries on my skin so that it&#x27;s matte all over with out drying out/flaking, and my face soft as all get out!  </li>
      <li>i first tried this moisturizer one year ago before that i use obagi.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I love this in the summer when I&#x27;m especially shiny.</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m good for another few hours.</li>
      <li>I love to put it on when my skin is dry</li>
      <li>I was really exited about it  </li>
      <li>This product really works and doesn&#x27;t clog pores.  </li>
      <li>I use this whole line and wanted to stick with one line</li>
      <li>Works very well under make up.  </li>
      <li>but I have very oily skin and</li>
      <li>It looks smooth and my pores looks smaller.</li>
      <li>Really.  </li>
      <li>and it works very well.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Although it doesn&#x27;t contain much of vitamin food for my skin</li>
      <li>I just touch up with oil absorbing sheets</li>
      <li>Though I have acen prone and very oilyskin</li>
      <li>You don&#x27;t need much, and it works SO,</li>
      <li>I highly suggest you try it if you have oily skin or want your skin to look matte.  </li>
      <li>but I had to go back to my Murad mattifying moisturizer because it works so very well!!</li>
      <li>I still get very oily and feel that other regular moisturizers that aren&#x27;t oil absorbing ended up working better than this.</li>
      <li>Over the course of a few hours, that combo doesn&#x27;t prevent some oil from accumulating, but it prevents the shine which is what bothers me the most.</li>
      <li>If you purchase this item from PHARMAMUNDI, they will send you the new product.</li>
      <li>Effaclar has reformulated the product to have a new appearance and texture.</li>
      <li>Excelent moisturizer, leave ur face very soft and matte...</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve had some problems with mild cystic acne (and with other La Roche products)</li>
      <li>If you want the old product, you will have to find a vendor that still sells the old product.</li>
      <li>it.&lt;br /&gt;It makes your skin soft.</li>
      <li>Product was exactly what I needed and it came in within the time frame that was expected.</li>
      <li>Back to my standard Aveeno Positively Radiant daily moisturizer.</li>
      <li>Really helps with the little bit of acne I still get after doing Accutane, and is absolutely THE ONLY THING that has ever taken away the blackheads on my nose.  </li>
      <li>Just be sure to put a thin layer on like it says</li>
      <li>but everyone&#x27;s different and I wish I would have been able to sample it before I spent the $25 :/</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> After having surgery for melanoma, my doctor recommended this product.  As someone who has Scotch/Irish/Norwegian skin, the moisturizer does wonders.</li>
    <li> I love this product and have been using it for years. I did NOT receive the product that is listed. Effaclar has reformulated the product to have a new appearance and texture. If you purchase this item from PHARMAMUNDI, they will send you the new product. Not the one listed in the image. If you want the old product, you will have to find a vendor that still sells the old product.</li>
    <li> I love this product. I have oily skin and it truly does instantly mattify. I&#x27;ve been using it for about 2 weeks now and I have already noticed an improvement in my skin texture. It looks smooth and my pores looks smaller.</li>
    <li> I had high hopes for this moisturizer as I&#x27;ve heard great things about the line but this made my nose SUPER oily and I broke out on my chin. I have combination to oily skin. Back to my standard Aveeno Positively Radiant daily moisturizer.</li>
    <li> I bought this via Amazon through a retailer in the UK.  Not only was the shipping faster than some other items shipped from within the US, but they sent me a bunch of freebies along with my order.  Who doesn&#x27;t like freebies?  GREAT service!   As for the product, I covet this brand.  My skin tends to be excessively oily (especially in the T zone), and this moisturizer coupled with the Effaclar face wash is my skin&#x27;s saving grace.  Seriously.  The moisturizer goes on light, not oily at all, and dries on my skin so that it&#x27;s matte all over with out drying out/flaking, and my face soft as all get out!  Really.  I&#x27;ve heard girlfriends say the Body Shop has a similar product for less money, but after 20 years of searching for the best product for my skin type, now that I&#x27;ve found Effaclar I won&#x27;t use anything else.    It seems a bit pricy for the amount, but a little goes a long long way.  I find myself using around a pump and a half for my entire face and neck--one of these little tubes lasts me around 2 months.  You don&#x27;t need much, and it works SO, SO, SOOO well.    I highly suggest you try it if you have oily skin or want your skin to look matte.  Promise you&#x27;ll convert for life, too.</li>
    <li> This product helped the texture of my skin but it did not help with the shine. It is not a mattifier or at least it did not work for me. I like it because it is a good light mosturizer.</li>
    <li> I have stubbornly oily skin. Most mattifying products that I&#x27;ve tried before don&#x27;t work for more than 1 hour before the shine seeps through, however, this moisturizer helps keep the glare to a minimum for a longer period of time. I do love the feel of the moisturizer; it feels good on my skin. To actually mattify, the best combo I&#x27;ve found is this moisturizer under Cosmedicine Medi Matte. Over the course of a few hours, that combo doesn&#x27;t prevent some oil from accumulating, but it prevents the shine which is what bothers me the most. When my skin starts to feel oily I just touch up with oil absorbing sheets and I&#x27;m good for another few hours.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing! It smells nice, treats your skin leaving a smooth touch and works perfectly to create a matte effect. I usually use before make up, as a primer.</li>
    <li> Makes your skin feel nice but I have very oily skin and this product just doesn&#x27;t do the trick. I use this whole line and wanted to stick with one line but I had to go back to my Murad mattifying moisturizer because it works so very well!!</li>
    <li> Really helps with the little bit of acne I still get after doing Accutane, and is absolutely THE ONLY THING that has ever taken away the blackheads on my nose.  La Roche-Posay has never failed me, so why would they now :)  Just be sure to put a thin layer on like it says</li>
    <li> I´ve been using this product for many years and I really love it.&lt;br /&gt;It makes your skin soft. I just would like it&#x27;d have UV protection, then would be perfect.</li>
    <li> This product is a light daytime moisturizer. Perfect for my combo skin. It is the first-line-of-defense against enlarged pores even on days when I do not use a foundation. A little of this product goes a long way.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this mattifying moisturizer everyday for a month now and it just doesn&#x27;t work for me.  I still get very oily and feel that other regular moisturizers that aren&#x27;t oil absorbing ended up working better than this. I bought it because of how well reviewed and rated it was but everyone&#x27;s different and I wish I would have been able to sample it before I spent the $25 :/</li>
    <li> Product was exactly what I needed and it came in within the time frame that was expected. Nothing bad to say. Great product, great service.</li>
    <li> I had to write a review about this product. It&#x27;s amazing! Moisturizes skin without leaving it sticky or oily. Even in south Florida&#x27;s most humid days skin stays smooth. I&#x27;ve had some problems with mild cystic acne (and with other La Roche products) it&#x27;s almost gone. I&#x27;ve used Olay and Clinique in the past and they can&#x27;t compare to this one. I&#x27;m a fan for life.</li>
    <li> UPDATE: I figured out it was my hair product that was making me break out. This product is great. Works great under makeup and is gentle on skin, not greasy at all. Day and nighttime use.</li>
    <li> Great. Product I used. Day and night very smooth softens skin moistens and refresh giving a great sensation to my face.</li>
    <li> I have deceived by a great deal of products exagerating their sebum absorbing ability. But everyone lasted for just couple of hrs. MAT is different. Though I have acen prone and very oilyskin and it is summer, I can notice the dramatic reduction of shiness and grease. I have never left review for online shopping, but this time I cannot but to recommend MAT to another people who are suffering from their oily skin. Go get it.</li>
    <li> It does what it says it will do. I love this in the summer when I&#x27;m especially shiny. It&#x27;s a great base for makeup too.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m in love with this Moisturizer, I recommended if you skin is oily is perfect. I had used it for more than 4 years and my skin looks great</li>
    <li> i first tried this moisturizer one year ago before that i use obagi.&lt;br /&gt;Although it doesn&#x27;t contain much of vitamin food for my skin I like this moisturizer because it doesn&#x27;t leave my face shinny and oily like other kinds of moisturizer, so I only use it under my make up during the day and at night I use B kamins c serum  under it and it keeps my complexion  looking great.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m still using this.  I hope it works for others like it did to me.</li>
    <li> Excelent moisturizer, leave ur face very soft and matte... a good choise if u have oily skin, it will be so great for u! i love it</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a great moisturizer for super oily skin. Wish it cost less but I haven&#x27;t yet found a cheaper alternative.</li>
    <li> I did a lot of reserach before buying this moisturizer because of my oily skin, but I was not disappointed! It is perfect! And it lasts a while too.</li>
    <li> This product really works and doesn&#x27;t clog pores.  I love to put it on when my skin is dry and it works very well.  I use the entire line of La Roche-Posay,</li>
    <li> Works very well under make up.  Lasts long.</li>
    <li> Received it way sooner than expected. I was really exited about it  I have such an oily face on my t zone and I&#x27;ve been looking for a product that would actually works saw the great reviews and decided to purchase it. Unfortunately, it made my face worse. I used it a couple of times hoping it would work but it just made my face oiler than before.</li>
    <li> I absolutely LOVE La Roche Posay. I started using it when my friend (who lives in Barcelona) recommended this brand. She has oily skin like me and told me this was the best product she had ever used. She wasn&#x27;t kidding! I LOVE this product, they changeed the presentation. I use the entire line, including SPF, Vitamin C for eyes and face, and the water spray. I&#x27;ve used many expensive brands before and this is by far the best one I&#x27;ve ever used. I hope they keep selling this at CVS, that&#x27;s where I get it.</li>
