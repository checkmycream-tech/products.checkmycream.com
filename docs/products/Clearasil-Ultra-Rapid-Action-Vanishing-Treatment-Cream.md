      <li>almost gone :) 2 uses and its 100% gone!</li>
      <li>It is amazing.</li>
      <li>I use this to effectively fix pimples.</li>
      <li>This product contains benzoyl peroxide, not the more popular salicylic acid.</li>
      <li>It was also perfect for that fast fit for my wedding.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s a great quality product that does exactly what it says</li>
      <li>My local pharmacy no longer carries this item, so I was very happy to find it online.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Personally, I wasn&#x27;t as impressed by this cream as I was by some Salicylic Acid based acne medications I have and currently use.  </li>
      <li>The scrub felt more like a polish.</li>
      <li>My face is much more clearer.</li>
      <li>I have used this before and it worked better than the one I received from G-D Merchants.</li>
      <li>Great product, would highly recommend</li>
      <li>My title may indicate that the ingredients in this product are strong and thus work well</li>
      <li>it says on the label; this stuff is STRONG.  </li>
      <li>Just before you have something important to do ladies, you always break out before it happens.</li>
      <li>Works great for red itchy eyes</li>
      <li>great product will definitely purchase this product again.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It went on smoothly and wasn&#x27;t greasy.</li>
      <li>and while that may be true, the ingredients in this product also smell extremely strong.</li>
      <li>Therefore, this product is best for those who have acne caused from bacteria--and very little acne, at that.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Therefore, this product is best for those who have acne caused from bacteria--and very little acne, at that.</li>
      <li>the original pimple perfecting pomade.</li>
      <li>It seems like this product worked better when I first started using it.</li>
      <li>However, if your acne is light or mild, you may want to consider waiting to get a product like this after seeing how effective normal acne face washes are for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It worked great for the first fed days but by day four my skin broke out into a red rash and when it went away my skin look like my face was just lit on FIRE</li>
      <li>Quite frankly, I know companies want to sell their product to me and the fast I buy it, the more money they make.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
      <li>seriously, this is the best acne remover i have ever used.</li>
      <li>It works quickly and I recommend it.  </li>
      <li>This works amazingly, quickly and better than any high end product.</li>
      <li>This is an excellent product and clears spots away far quicker than any other product tried in our household.</li>
      <li>I tried many other products and treatments, best way to use it is as prevention, and it means almost everyday, so I keep my face clean...</li>
      <li>DO NOT USE IF YOU HAVE A SENSITIVE FACE!!!!!</li>
      <li>I have used Clearisil Daily Clear for ages and it works great.  </li>
      <li>so its worth it</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s so well priced, it&#x27;s worth a try</li>
      <li>CLEARS IT UP RIGHT AWAY</li>
      <li>Scars after acne is a huge problem for me, and even Proactiv did pretty much nothing about that</li>
      <li>discovered the face wash first then this product.</li>
      <li>It sleazed up my acne fast!</li>
      <li>I combines this product with the clearasil face scub and my face cleared up in just 3 days, highly recommend!!</li>
      <li>In about a couple of hours, the redness and itching fade away and most of my facial acne get cured without leaving any marks.</li>
      <li>Although the shipping was high.i went to walmart and bought clean and clear morning burst</li>
      <li>In addition, I use a scrubby pad with Clean and Clear Oil-Free Cleaner, at night.</li>
      <li>Proactiv, Murad, Natures Cure, Clean and clear, clinique, ambi, my list goes on.</li>
      <li>I had used Proactiv before trying this product and, interestingly enough, some comments made by others about Proactiv is that 1) it seems to stop working eventually or doesn&#x27;t work as well as time goes on, and 2) the active ingredient actually works best at a lower percentage.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using Clearasil for my acne for the past 4 years and I must say it is the best medication that I&#x27;ve had so far for facial acne.</li>
      <li>I look it off and the next day a huge area around the one spot that I used it on was covered in pimples.</li>
      <li>so really this might not work the slightest for you, or it may work wonders for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>it helps so much when im getting ready for highschool</li>
      <li>REALLY PUTS THE FIGHT ON ACNE.  </li>
      <li>Rub one layer in to your skin really well.</li>
      <li>So much cheaper and easier to use than Proactiv.</li>
      <li>I would really reccomend this item.</li>
      <li>When you wake up in the morning and take a shower or wash the residue off your face you will absolutely notice a difference.</li>
      <li>It really does work.</li>
      <li>my ruin the colors on your clothes if you rub your face, fingers or just swet a bit too much.</li>
      <li>If you&#x27;re the kind of person who generally has clear skin but gets an occasional blemish, this might work for you.acne scars.</li>
      <li>If you&#x27;re the kind of person who generally has clear skin but gets an occasional blemish, this might work for you.</li>
      <li>While even just an application a day makes a world of difference, if you expect your break outs to clear up in just 3 days, you&#x27;re going to have to follow the directions exactly and apply this product 2 - 3 times over the course of one day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>but I still got zits and still get them today at the age of 27 but not nearly as bad as when I was in high school and middle</li>
      <li>bottom line is this is a decent product but</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s the only line of acne products that keeps my light adult acne in line, including prescriptions.&lt;br /&gt;From</li>
      <li>my forehead is mainly kinda oily with acne, once I started using this cream</li>
      <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
      <li>so high scores...</li>
      <li>It really does shrink a spot down, very quickly.</li>
      <li>Throwing the rest of this tube out, and found some of the original Clearisil Daily Clear cream online.</li>
      <li>I can only assume that the product is weaker because it is close to expiration date that the seller clearly indicated with a separate label on the original box.</li>
      <li>That being said, this is still a strong product and works well as a supplement for other acne medications; out of the four products I use, this one is probably tied for second.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Fast action.</li>
      <li>If you remove the cream and directly add makeup (my biggest mistake), you will develop MORE pimples and the initial ones will still be there (as the same size).</li>
      <li>I saw normal skin.</li>
      <li>This is the reason why most elaborate acne treatments, such as Proactiv and the Clean &amp; Clear system, include several products for you to use--each generally has a different active ingredient so that they can treat all these major causes of acne.</li>
      <li>My acne has decreased, and when I do get acne it clears up more quickly and doesn&#x27;t spread to the areas around it.</li>
      <li>It takes a really long time to work I prefer clean and clear on the spot treatment because this one is not as rapid as it claims to be.</li>
      <li>This is a great product for minor blemish flare-ups, especially because it is not overly harsh or drying.  </li>
      <li>and I highly recommend you use it with the rapid action face wash.</li>
      <li>Then put a second layer over the first but don&#x27;t rub it all the way in.</li>
      <li>don&#x27;t know anyone who wants to check their watch every 6 hours to see if it&#x27;s time to put on more awful smelling acne treatment and, honestly, I don&#x27;t know if I would really want to put that much chemical on my face.&lt;br</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I never had acne problems before, now at 40 I do...its incredible how this product work...I tried many other products and treatments, best way to use it is as prevention, and it means almost everyday, so I keep my face clean...if I skip it for a couple days i end with a couple pimples and lot of redness on my face....The only problem is that I have to use only white towels and be careful with my clothes, the acid on the product my ruin the colors on your clothes if you rub your face, fingers or just swet a bit too much.</li>
    <li> My local pharmacy no longer carries this item, so I was very happy to find it online.  In fact, it seems Amazon.com carries everything and anything someone would want!</li>
    <li> Cons:&lt;br /&gt;This product wasn&#x27;t tough enough to dry out most of my pimples. Too bad it wasn&#x27;t strong enough for my skin. I usually have better luck with salicylic acid, but bought this on a whim and am now going back to SA. I wish it helped with hyperpigmentation.&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;It went on smoothly and wasn&#x27;t greasy. A tad shiny, however. No real smell.</li>
    <li> This cream is amusing! It did work to release some of the acne over night, I will recommend it to others.</li>
    <li> This is a great product for minor blemish flare-ups, especially because it is not overly harsh or drying.  It works quickly and I recommend it.  Shipment was prompt.</li>
    <li> I bought this from my local market because I had ran out of the previous medication that I had, I used it and after 1 hour of it being on my face it became itchy. I look it off and the next day a huge area around the one spot that I used it on was covered in pimples. I wouldn&#x27;t reccomend this product.</li>
    <li> it helps so much when im getting ready for highschool and i get a surprise pimple; i apply it before i got to school, and by the time i get there the redness and swelling is gone, its as if i never had it, then i apply cover up</li>
    <li> My title may indicate that the ingredients in this product are strong and thus work well and while that may be true, the ingredients in this product also smell extremely strong. While the scent is not unbearable I find that it stays with me quite a while after I use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All that aside, the idea of a spot treatment for acne and blemishes is great. See one? Treat it by itself so you don&#x27;t have to dry out the rest of your skin, right?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Too bad it doesn&#x27;t work so well. While even just an application a day makes a world of difference, if you expect your break outs to clear up in just 3 days, you&#x27;re going to have to follow the directions exactly and apply this product 2 - 3 times over the course of one day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know anyone who wants to check their watch every 6 hours to see if it&#x27;s time to put on more awful smelling acne treatment and, honestly, I don&#x27;t know if I would really want to put that much chemical on my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know I often ignore directions on beauty products because they all tell you to use their product 2 or 3 times a day, even if this would be detrimental to the condition of your skin. Quite frankly, I know companies want to sell their product to me and the fast I buy it, the more money they make.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottom line is this is a decent product but in order to get the promised results it&#x27;s going to be a bit of a hassle so you&#x27;re better off just covering it up like the rest of us!</li>
    <li> Title says all. Fast action. But remember, this fights what is currently on your face, doesnt prevent what could get to your face. Clears acne well after a few uses in a 48 hour period.</li>
    <li> Gotta say, put this on, and that pimple or whatever is going to have a very short life span. I use this to effectively fix pimples. I can&#x27;t say that it will take four hours or whatever because i put this on at night, but the pimples definitely shrivels up and will go away after some time. so its worth it</li>
    <li> It really does work. I just feel as if it makes you become dependent to it. So you have it use it regularly. I recommend, use it get the inflammation down, and then change your diet.</li>
    <li> I tried this stuff because my skin was oil and had a few pimples. It worked great for the first fed days but by day four my skin broke out into a red rash and when it went away my skin look like my face was just lit on FIRE I don&#x27;t think there was one spot on my face were I saw normal skin. My skin was the worst I&#x27;ve seen in in 5 years of having acne. Discolored brown and red spots everywhere and yet some people like it. Probably not everyone&#x27;s experience but hey if you want to ignore this and try it go for it. My skin still looks like crap a week later. It&#x27;s going to take months for it to return to how it was and it wasn&#x27;t great to start with. You can also google what 10% benzoyl peroxide has done for other people if you don&#x27;t believe me.</li>
    <li> seriously, this is the best acne remover i have ever used. when i get a breakout, i rub it on the acne and the few hours it&#x27;s gone. So i recommend it to someone who gets random breakouts.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m looking for a dark spot remover, if anyone has a recommendation please let me know.</li>
    <li> Works great for red itchy eyes</li>
    <li> Always use on break outs or random pop ups. Works good. Ordered off amazon cause I never remember to buy in the store when i go</li>
    <li> I have used this before and it worked better than the one I received from G-D Merchants. I can only assume that the product is weaker because it is close to expiration date that the seller clearly indicated with a separate label on the original box. It takes about 4 days for a pimple to decrease in size - definitely no where near the 4 hours you should see an effect in.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used the clearasil ultra line for a while and it&#x27;s the only line of acne products that keeps my light adult acne in line, including prescriptions.&lt;br /&gt;From middle school to high school i always had acne. Not the deep scaring kind, in fact I haven&#x27;t gotten one scar or those pock marks like some acne suffers get (thank god!). In college my face calmed down but I still got zits and still get them today at the age of 27 but not nearly as bad as when I was in high school and middle school.&lt;br /&gt;I discovered the face wash first then this product. The face wash keeps me almost completely clear but when a few zits spring out I use this gel (IT IS a gel, contrary to one review i read). It&#x27;s clear so if you put too much on you won&#x27;t get those embarrassing white streaks. It also DOESN&#x27;T sting like another reviewer claimed. I think she may just be allergic to salicylic acid and the other clearasil ointment she was talking about contains benzoyl peroxide.&lt;br /&gt;Some of my friends do get dried out of they use it too often but I have oily combination skin and it would be a dream to dry my face out.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve also NEVER experienced this \\&quot;bleaching\\&quot; effect people talk about. It&#x27;s never bleached my clothes or pillow cases or anything, even when I spilled a drop of it on my dark bathroom rug and didn&#x27;t notice it until hours later when i stepped in it.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a great quality product that does exactly what it says and I highly recommend you use it with the rapid action face wash. However I&#x27;ve found the rapid action scrub to not be abrasive enough. After I shave my face I always exfoliate and continue to until I get a good amount of stubble. The scrub felt more like a polish. I recommend the st. Ives acne scrub but DONT exfoliate everyday no matter what you read. It&#x27;s counter productive to clearing acne if done too often. And DON&#x27;T moisturize. No lotion is going to be productive for acne covered skin. It clogs pours and all it does is moisturize and bloat dead skin cells while trapping them in your pours. If you have a dry patch avoid the gel on that spot for a few days. Overly dried skin can also cause zits. Then exfoliate. That will get rid of the dead skin and promote cell turn over. Moisturizing is not beneficial to acne sufferers. Even if it has the active ingredient in the rapid action line.apping them in your pours.

    <li> Works for my adult daughter with sensitive skin prone to acne.</li>
    <li> This product does help with last minute breakouts in combination with the face wash...great product will definitely purchase this product again.</li>
    <li> DO NOT USE IF YOU HAVE A SENSITIVE FACE!!!!! It made me break out worse!!!!</li>
    <li> I bought this at my local drugstore and it was probably the s***tiest purchase I have ever made. not only does it not work, it certainly does nothing in 4 hours. sorry, maybe it&#x27;s just my skin or something. but in my opinion, don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> It takes a really long time to work I prefer clean and clear on the spot treatment because this one is not as rapid as it claims to be.</li>
    <li> It sleazed up my acne fast! I was really impressed. Although the shipping was high.i went to walmart and bought clean and clear morning burst and it works great I am seeing a great result!</li>
    <li> ONLY THING THAT WORKS FOR MY PROBLEM ON MY FACE.....CLEARS IT UP RIGHT AWAY</li>
    <li> I combines this product with the clearasil face scub and my face cleared up in just 3 days, highly recommend!!</li>
    <li> First off, I need to state the obvious: Different people have different skin problems and different acne medicines will effect people differently so really this might not work the slightest for you, or it may work wonders for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Personally, I wasn&#x27;t as impressed by this cream as I was by some Salicylic Acid based acne medications I have and currently use.  It hasn&#x27;t had a very noticeable impact by itself, however I am using several different products in conjunction with this one so they probably have a synergistic effect.  That being said, this is still a strong product and works well as a supplement for other acne medications; out of the four products I use, this one is probably tied for second.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As it says on the label; this stuff is STRONG.  It can bleach your hair / clothes so be careful with it.  (I personally haven&#x27;t had any problems with this particular product but a previous Benzoyl Peroxide face wash I used did bleach several of my face towels)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely get this product if you are having major acne breakouts or just overall problems with acne.  However, if your acne is light or mild, you may want to consider waiting to get a product like this after seeing how effective normal acne face washes are for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good luck clearing up your acne!</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t find this in the store so I resorted to Amazon. This is the only Benzoyl Peroxide product that I&#x27;ve found that doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin to the point of flaking, but still addresses my problematic milia.</li>
    <li> I have been using this item for one week since i got it..its not working for my acne...dont know why its reviews r so high scores...[[ASIN:B001U0OQLS Clearasil Ultra 4 Hour Rapid Action Treatment Cream, Tinted Cream, 1-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 2)]]</li>
    <li> It was here on time. And I even got it cheaper than going in-store. My face is much more clearer. It was also perfect for that fast fit for my wedding. Ya know? Just before you have something important to do ladies, you always break out before it happens. Lol!</li>
    <li> I finally had enough with the expense and hassle of Proactiv. But after I quit it, my face exploded! I&#x27;d never had trouble like that in my life, with huge, cyst-like spots. In my search, I tried a Retin-A on prescription and a variety of other products. It was a nightmare. This product was part of the solution! It really does shrink a spot down, very quickly. It is amazing. I use it just in the morning, about five days a week, as an whole-face preventative treatment. I might dab a little on a rare spot, twice a day, if a tiny one pops up. In addition, I use a scrubby pad with Clean and Clear Oil-Free Cleaner, at night. That&#x27;s it! So much cheaper and easier to use than Proactiv. This stuff will still bleach towels, clothes, and sheets, so use care. It&#x27;s so well priced, it&#x27;s worth a try and I recommend it to anyone struggling with break-outs. (Note: This product contains benzoyl peroxide, not the more popular salicylic acid. It seems like if one doesn&#x27;t work for you, the other might, as they are completely different active ingredients.) Good luck!</li>
    <li> I use this at night and morning WALAAA pimple 1/2 size down or almost gone :) 2 uses and its 100% gone!</li>
    <li> Works like a charm. If you have bad acne, this will still work. Slather it on at bedtime. Rub one layer in to your skin really well. Then put a second layer over the first but don&#x27;t rub it all the way in. (Be careful, it bleaches pillowcases and sheets.) When you wake up in the morning and take a shower or wash the residue off your face you will absolutely notice a difference. This product accelerates the pimple life cycle process. I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Clearasil for my acne for the past 4 years and I must say it is the best medication that I&#x27;ve had so far for facial acne. Every time a pimple pops up on my face, I rub this rapid action cream and the effect is visible almost immediately. In about a couple of hours, the redness and itching fade away and most of my facial acne get cured without leaving any marks. But the Benzyl Peroxide can make your skin feel very dry after application. Works well for me since I have an oily skin.</li>
    <li> This item always helps my skin during break outs and keeps my skin looking great. I would really reccomend this item.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this cream for about 6 months now.  I use it under my daily moisturizer to avoid drying out my skin, and it works well for me.  My acne has decreased, and when I do get acne it clears up more quickly and doesn&#x27;t spread to the areas around it.</li>
    <li> GREAT PRODUCT.  REALLY PUTS THE FIGHT ON ACNE.  PREVENTS IT TOO.</li>
    <li> Great product, would highly recommend</li>
    <li> It seems like this product worked better when I first started using it. This product has the same active ingredient in it as is in Proactiv&#x27;s products, but at a higher percentage. I had used Proactiv before trying this product and, interestingly enough, some comments made by others about Proactiv is that 1) it seems to stop working eventually or doesn&#x27;t work as well as time goes on, and 2) the active ingredient actually works best at a lower percentage. It seems that now when I apply this cream, it does nothing for my skin, whereas before I could actually fail to follow the directions of using it 3 times a day and the spots where I had acne would clear up quickly (and this product works differently from Proactiv, perhaps because of the difference in percentage of benzoyl peroxide and more products used in its treatment). In addition, this cream, unlike Proactiv, actually dries my skin out in the spots where I use it. If my skin isn&#x27;t a little moist when I apply this cream, then the cream leaves dried white spots/flakes where I rub it in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are two reasons why this product won&#x27;t always work/might not work on your acne:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) The active ingredient is supposed to fight acne caused only by bacteria. However, not all acne is caused by bacteria. So, if you have a breakout because of clogged pores (you probably need sulfur as the active ingredient) or dead skin cells (you probably need salicylic acid/exfoliators), then products with benzoyl peroxide are not what you need. This is the reason why most elaborate acne treatments, such as Proactiv and the Clean &amp; Clear system, include several products for you to use--each generally has a different active ingredient so that they can treat all these major causes of acne. If you have scars, bp is not going to do the trick, either. Scars after acne is a huge problem for me, and even Proactiv did pretty much nothing about that (and no other product out there does anything about it, I&#x27;ve found). I suggest Vitamin E cream for acne scars. These are just the common causes of acne and acne problems; there are others that are more difficult to find products to treat, such as eczema, allergies, irritants to the skin (weather, products, etc), and even the foods you eat and your health. BP will do nothing for these things.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) Any product that fights bacteria will stop working eventually if you use it a lot, because the bacteria eventually becomes immune to the treatment. Haven&#x27;t you ever heard this about taking antibiotics? I have, and the same thing applies for anything that is anti-bacterial, from Neosporin (which some people recommend for spot treatment on acne because it is anti-bacterial) to Dial soap. I used up one tube of this cream and started on another one, but by the time I got to the second tube it just wasn&#x27;t working anymore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Therefore, this product is best for those who have acne caused from bacteria--and very little acne, at that. As someone who gets acne spots frequently (and often times in similar/the same places), this product stopped working for me because I had to use it too often. If you&#x27;re the kind of person who generally has clear skin but gets an occasional blemish, this might work for you.acne scars.

    <li> [[ASIN:B000G3H5TK Clearasil Ultra Vanishing Acne Treatment Cream -- 1 oz]WHY DID OU SEND TO ME THE OUT OF DATE PRODUCT, BY WHAT WAY CAN I USE THEM ?!</li>
    <li> this is the best acne cream I&#x27;ve ever used! my forehead is mainly kinda oily with acne, once I started using this cream my forehead cleared up within 2-3 uses! my skin has never been clearer! (It also reduces the size one big pimple overnight)</li>
    <li> the original pimple perfecting pomade. Get it. Use it. Pimples gone. It&#x27;s that simple.</li>
    <li> Great stuff.  Less harsh than regular Clearasil.  This product is a clear gel and not as smelly or messy as the white cream version.  Does not work in 8 hours but it did clear up a pesky pimple in 2 days.</li>
    <li> Quick delivery and great product!</li>
    <li> I have used Clearisil Daily Clear for ages and it works great.  My husband mistakenly picked up a tube of this Ultra for me instead when I had it on the grocery list, and I hate it.  It&#x27;s not a cream, it&#x27;s a runny lotion, and it STINGS my skin on application.  Throwing the rest of this tube out, and found some of the original Clearisil Daily Clear cream online.</li>
    <li> so good ... Im happy to use this one .. thank you for offering this to me</li>
    <li> This is an excellent product and clears spots away far quicker than any other product tried in our household. All users are very satisfied with this product.</li>
    <li> Title says it all. I&#x27;m a lifelong acne sufferer and I have used everything. EVERYTHING. Proactiv, Murad, Natures Cure, Clean and clear, clinique, ambi, my list goes on. This works amazingly, quickly and better than any high end product.Within a day any pimple is dried up and tamed by the end of a week or less. Try it and see how it works.</li>
    <li> The cream does reduce redness in 4 hours, but almost instantaneously brings it back after you&#x27;ve removed the cream - so no help there. In addition, like some have said, the cream dries up your pimples, but to an extent. Also, it soothes the pimples initial irritation but works TERRIBLY with make-up. Applying this under would create an extremely cake, uneven texture. If you remove the cream and directly add makeup (my biggest mistake), you will develop MORE pimples and the initial ones will still be there (as the same size). Would not use cream to cover a large surface, but PERHAPS once in a while for big zits. I foolishly made the mistake of giving this cream a chance over another gel I have, and I regret it. Overtime, you may have to look for another product.</li>
    <li> As described, well packed and arrived on timeWould recommend to anybody, very satisfied with the service. Will use the service again.</li>
