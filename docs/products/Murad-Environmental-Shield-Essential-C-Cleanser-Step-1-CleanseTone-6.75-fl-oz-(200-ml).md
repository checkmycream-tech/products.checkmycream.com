<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Great product and it works wonderful for your skin.</li>
    <li> I really, really like this facial cleanser.  It&#x27;s very gentle on the skin and has a nice smell to it.  It leaves my skin feeling clean and not too dry, as I have chronically dry skin.  I use this in combination with the Essential C moisturizer and it makes my face look amazing!</li>
    <li> I have bought the whole kit at sephora I bought the trial kit loved it so much bought more from Amazon because it was so much cheaper noticed a change in my face after the 3 day brighter skin and sunspots a whole lot lighter loved it so much I ordered the acne kits to try for my teenage kids I hope it work as well I will write a review on that kit. Love the products very good !!!</li>
    <li> Love Murad, great price!!</li>
    <li> This is an excellent cleanser.  Works well with periodical breakouts and doesnt dry my skin out and create fine lines.  I wouldn&#x27;t suggest if you have serious acne issues but this works so well for me because I do not. Leaves my skin feeling clean and has a great citrus smell.</li>
    <li> Love this cleanser! Makes my skin feel clean and refreshed. Seller shipped right away and the product was at my door in 2 days.</li>
    <li> I had continuous acne problems on my face before using this, and after using many antibiotics and topical treatments, my g/f recommended I use this and it has pretty much completely cleared my acne.</li>
    <li> I was using Dermalogica and just felt like my skin was not getting better, but once I started using this face wash my skin cleared up. It doesnt have an overwhelming citrus scent like others, works great!</li>
    <li> Not my favorite cleanser by Murad. It was OK but there are better ones in the Murad line and in other lines. I would not buy again.</li>
    <li> This is an amazing mask. I use this once a week and my skin is amazing. Smooth, soft, clear. Totally recommend Murad products. FYI, if you&#x27;re looking to clear up your acne, initially you&#x27;ll break out but that&#x27;s just the deeper zits coming to the surface to GTFO.</li>
    <li> Leaves you squeaky clean without drying out your skin. Helped clear my acne. Love this product for my sensitive combination skin!</li>
    <li> realy helped clear and even my skin tone</li>
    <li> I got this as a sample at sephora. I feel like it&#x27;s an okay cleanser, it&#x27;s a whole lot cheaper on Amazon than it is at sephora. For 20$ I feel like it&#x27;s pretty good but I wouldn&#x27;t pay the 36$ sephora wants for it. It&#x27;s not really a miracle. It&#x27;s just okay. I will say it does feel very cool and refreshing on your skin like it&#x27;s supposed to but I have very oily skin and it just doesn&#x27;t do it for me.</li>
    <li> Great for my sensitive skin. Non irritating and softening.</li>
    <li> I have been using Murad products since 1994 and this facial soap is incredible and vital, and very luxurious.  It hydrates your skin so well.  I use it twice a day and it is great to use after shaving.  Cannot do without it.  Highly recommend it to men and women to use twice a day!  It will keep your skin looking and feeling young!  Use the Essential C Toner spray after you wash as they make the perfect combination.</li>
    <li> This is a product I have used for over 10 years.  It is great and leaves my skin looking fresh and bright.  Love it</li>
    <li> Murad essential cleanser is great.. So smooth. Doesn&#x27;t bother my sensitive skin. I would recommend this product. Great buy.Shipped quickly too.</li>
    <li> I use this every day and absolutely love it!</li>
    <li> Very refreshing! This cleanser was recommended by my aesthetician. The vitamin C is helping get rid of the dry flakes on the surface of my skin. I highly recommend this product. If you have very sensitive skin, check on the ingredients before purchasing as it may be a little bit aggressive than mild cleansers.</li>
    <li> I tried this line during a facial.  They talked me into purchasing the entire line. I&#x27;m picky about my facial cleansers. This cleanser did nothing for me. I used the entire line for nearly 2 months, spending close to 300.00 and saw no real difference. I have no problem spending money on a great product, but \\&quot;more\\&quot; does not necessarily signify \\&quot;best\\&quot;.  Save your money and find another product that will work better and at a quarter of the price of this line.</li>
    <li> I use this after exfoliating every couple of weeks. My skin loves it. I use two other Murad products almost every night before bed - I alternate the Active Radiance Serum with the Environmental Night Cream. My skin seems to drink these products, and has become noticeably more smooth, and problems like dryness or oiliness are considerably less. Makeup goes on a lot better.</li>
    <li> excellent product and excellent service!!</li>
    <li> I now know why you don&#x27;t buy products that state on their website not to. The quality just isn&#x27;t there. Must be old/ tampered with</li>
    <li> I recently purchased this cleanser to complete my set of Murad for dark pigmentation. This cleanser has barely any scent to it,foams up very nicely,and rinses off cleanly.My face feels so soft,ready for the next step of the toner. It is not drying to my skin in any way.Even if not purchasing the entire line,this cleanser is perfect for every day use,as it leaves your face refreshed and renewed and ready for the day.Definitely will continue to use!&lt;br /&gt;,</li>
    <li> Amazing. Simply and irrevocably amazing.  I show my sister in law the results of the pigment serum. My arms were riddled with age spots.  THEY ARE TOTALLY GONE NOW. This regimen with the Essential - C cleanser is the bomb. The BEST ever.  Worth every penny.</li>
    <li> It worked quite well. my face felt and was very clean after washing with it. it works well especially for matured skin.</li>
    <li> Love this product!! Would recommend to anyone and I&#x27;ve used a lot of expensive and a lot of inexpensive products.</li>
    <li> good product for aging skin</li>
    <li> I love this cleanser and saved myself over $10.00 by buying it on Amazon.  It is a great water soluble cleanser that easily removes make up and leaves the skin soft!</li>
    <li> I have few blackheads, small sunspots, and very dry skin.  I was excited to try this as it states it helps to lock in moisture as well as treat and prevent pigmentation and damage caused by environmental exposure.  Not so.  I actually started getting flaky skin on the side of my nose which I don&#x27;t normally have.  It did keep my few blackheads clear, but did nothing for moisture and sunspots.  I returned it.  I&#x27;m going back to Derma E, Evenly Radiant which is much more effective for me.</li>
    <li> My wife loves this product and it keeps her looking young and fresh.  Great for those outdoors a lot. .</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Murad products for about 3 years and love the results.  The Vitamin C series has a lovely fresh citrus scent.  My face always feels great after using this mild cleanser.</li>
    <li> The wife orders most of this Murad stuff pretty regularly - she loves it and Amazon offering it with prime shipping is just an added bonus!</li>
    <li> I bought a 2-oz version of this at Ulta as a kind of impulsive buy at the checkout counter since it was a nice, travel-friendly size, I&#x27;ve always heard good things about Murad, and, hey, a little vitamin C can&#x27;t be bad. I&#x27;ve tried many cleansers and this is the first that actually does something for my skin (which is pretty normal, but occasionally breaks out). Some cleansers wash off makeup but do nothing else and others do a little too much, stripping my skin of oils and leaving it taut and dry. This, however, cleansed gently and left my skin feeling softer, smoother, and clearer the next day. I can&#x27;t vouch for it being an \\&quot;environmental shield,\\&quot; or for any functional purpose of the little orange beads, but I like the way it left my skin and it&#x27;s definitely a go-to when my skin breaks out as it really seems to help prevent redness and scarring.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**EDIT 1/26/2014:**&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s been close to 4 years since I first began using this product and it&#x27;s still my favorite cleanser. If only it were a little cheaper! Although, it does seem to last a while. I&#x27;ve used the product on and off over the years, usually a few times a week before bed, sometimes applying with a face brush (which creates a lather, allowing me to use less product). The rest of the time I use a gentle cleanser like Cetaphil just to remove sweat &amp; make-up. Occasionally I&#x27;ll try another cleanser and will use that for a few months but it seems I inevitably end up returning to this. I&#x27;ve probably gone through 1 full-sized and 2 travel-sized tubes in a little less than 4 years. The price for how long it lasts (and for reliable results) is actually not too bad when you think about it. I&#x27;ve also gradually learned over time that you tend to get what you pay for, and having healthy skin is something I&#x27;m willing to pay for.</li>
    <li> My expectations are always exceeded when purchasung products through Anazon.com.  Products are always packaged appropriately and delivered when promised.  I am also pleased with the performance of Murad Skin care line.</li>
    <li> I am a big fan of Murads facial products. I have noticed improvement in my skin since using this for the last 2 years. I always get compliments on my skin as well.</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with this cleanser. I truly does clean and make your skin soft. My husband noticed my softness in my skin after 1 day! And for a man that&#x27;s a compliment. I would suggest using the system together. Well worth getting or I should say its a must.</li>
    <li> I use this entire line of the Environmental Shield.  These products are wonderful.  I suffer from hyper pigmentation and after about 2 months of using this product line, my skin has a nice youthful glow.  I would recommend this product. to everyone.</li>
    <li> I love this cleanser. My face feels so clean but not over drying.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for about a year and have noticed an improvement in the overall appearance of my skin.</li>
    <li> I started using this product about a month ago along with a vitamin C serum and the Murad vitamin C moisturizer with spf 30 as a daily skin regime. I can honestly say my skin has never looked &amp; felt better. I also use a sensitive skin enzyme mask 3x a week for added exfoliation. My blemishes are fading and my face looks brighter &amp; glowing. Staying away from the sun really helps with preventing aging &amp; wrinkles but when you do get exposed to the mother of all energy, vitamin C is the way to help with problems that are caused from it such as hyperpigmentation, which I deal with from time to time being a dark skinned filipino.  I recommend this to anyone looking to benefit their appearance from excessive sun exposure. It&#x27;s smells great as well which is always a plus!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had melasma (dark spots on face)for 10 years and tried absolutely every dark spot lightning product known to mankind. This is the ONLY one that has actually worked. Since 2 different dermatologists told me my melasma was caused from hormones and not the sun, it never occurred to me to use vitamin C  or sun damage products. I tried this on a whim along with the age spot pigment lightening serum. After 3 days of use morning and night I noticed dramatic fading in my spots on my cheeks and a general brightness to the rest of my face. After 10 days my spots were so faded that I could actually skip using my concealer and foundation.  I couldn&#x27;t believe it. My spots had beenthe size of silver dollars! I bought the SPF 30 moisturizer as well and will never ever use anything else. It&#x27;s changed my life.People with some kind of skin condition on their face will really know how much this means. It gave me my confidence back because people arent staring at my cheeks now when they talk to me. And Murad products are less expensive on Amazon than Ultra and Sephora.</li>
    <li> Great cleanser for my sensitive skin! I actually noticed an improvement after less than one week of use, first time I&#x27;ve seen that from a cleanser.</li>
    <li> It really makes a difference for my skin - leaves it glowing. A key part of my skin care routine, other cleansers don&#x27;t compare.</li>
    <li> I was introduced to Murad after getting a facial. I was sad when I used up the last bit of the tiny bottle I purchased in a sampler set. After having to use Nutrogena, I could see what a difference this product made from the glowing of my skin to how light and easy to wash off it was. Plus, the price on Amazon is much cheaper than purchasing at Ulta or any store that carries Murad. Shipped in 2 days, and the product was exacly what I had expected.</li>
    <li> i have used this before a friend had me try it. i was looking where the best place to get it would be...of course amazon! i received it on time and i have to say its not specifically noted that it helps with acne but let me just say i have tried so many prducts including changing my make up. but this has helped so muxh the change in my complexion is drastic. i love it and i will be ordering it regularly! thank u murad</li>
    <li> Removes all makeup and oil .  Love this product and will be using it from this point I .</li>
    <li> I always had perfect skin as a teen and in my mid 20&#x27;s I broke out with severe adult acne. I tried EVERYTHING. It was almost worse because I had never had acne as a teen so I literally didn&#x27;t know how to deal with it. I tried this because I was afraid the Murad Acne Wash would be too drying. I bought this at the beginning of January and LOVE LOVE LOVE it. My skin is flattened out. I don&#x27;t get giant painful cysts anymore. Around my period I MIGHT get a small white head or two but this product makes it go away quickly (sometimes over night) without drying the rest of my skin out!!!! My skin didn&#x27;t purge which was also a huge plus. It&#x27;s not great at removing make up but I just use bar soap quickly to wash it off. It&#x27;s not a makeup remover so don&#x27;t expect it to be. It&#x27;s quite moisturizing and doesn&#x27;t strip. Rub it on wet skin for 30 seconds, then re-wet your finger tips and rub again. It takes a bit to lather but I think that&#x27;s why it doesn&#x27;t strip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wash my face with this, then do a quick swipe of witch hazel, and the moisturize with cetaphil. Also, twice a week I&#x27;ve been doing a 40% lactic acid peel from MakeUp Artists Choice to lighten my scars (***use witch hazel before and after use of the lactic acid...). My skin is finally clearing up and my scars are dramatically lightening. Between this cleanser and the lactic acid my skin is starting to get back to normal!!!!!! I&#x27;ve been doing it for two months and the difference is insane!!!! Give it a try!!!!!!!! I can&#x27;t wait to see the results in a few more months!!!! I will check back in!!!!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s very gentle and easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;I got this soap As a treatment for sun spots, and I knowest that about 80% of  my acne went away.</li>
    <li> Nice face wash but I don&#x27;t think I would repurchase it again. I didn&#x27;t notice any difference with my skin.</li>
    <li> Hole to dispense cleanser was not made large enough for anything to come out. After squeezing &amp; trying several times, it busted out the other end of the tube, wasting half of the entire tube. Huge waste of money.  Smelled good.</li>
    <li> Product works good. Not expensive. Murad products are good. I was surprised.</li>
    <li> Love this cleanser, it thoroughly cleanses the skin.&lt;br /&gt;Two steps in one. Excellent price from the buyer.&lt;br /&gt;Will purchase from this buyer again.</li>
    <li> This is a very good facial cleanser.  It leaves your face feeling very clean but not dried out.  A little expensive but worth it.  Murad products are great.</li>
    <li> My skin and very dry and sensitive.  My skin feels clean and refreshed.  I am happy with my purchase and recommend it.</li>
    <li> I prevously wrote a review of this product stating it was delivered in a wrong container and it was fake.  This was the wrong company I was writting about.  The company was Omni Solutions that sent me a wrong/fake product.  This retailer sent me the essential C cleaners and it came on time was REAL and in perfect condition.  I am truly sorry for mistaking this company for the other one I had ordered from.  I had ordered all products on the same day from Amazon. I would buy from this retailer again.</li>
    <li> Great product for daily cleansing without drying skin. Love Murad products!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product packaged securely, shipped/received as expected.</li>
    <li> I have been looking for a cleanser that makes my skin feel clean but not dry. This cleanser is what I have been looking for. Will buy again.</li>
    <li> This cleanser is the only stuff that helps with dry and oily skin, I had pimples on my forehead for the longest time... I tried everything, even retin A, which was awful! Murad cleanser is amazing, bumps are gone and now my skin is smooth! Don&#x27;t waste your money by buying other products, this is the stuff!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this cleanser. ..I have tried many but this one does it for me. It is gentle yet cleanses my skin really well.</li>
    <li> This is a nice gentle cleanser that doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin. I have combination skin and I feel clean after using.</li>
    <li> love the way it washes w/out stripping skin</li>
    <li> the only reason I didn&#x27;t give this product 5 stars is because it has a citrus smell.  I have very sensitive skin and this face wash proved to be very gentle.  This is the first time in years that I don&#x27;t get a light irritation on my face after washing it.  I use this in combination with my clarisonic and I couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
    <li> My wife loves this product.</li>
    <li> Murad C Cleanser is very good to your skin.  I bought this after getting tired of good cleansers that left my face tight.  This stuff cleans well and leaves your skin soft and supple.  I love it and will get another one soon, esp good in the winter months (NY)</li>
    <li> Not impressed with this product at all, skin is still dirty afterwards.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried a few of the Murad facial cleanser&#x27;s now: Essential-C, Time Release Acne and AHA/BHA Exfoliating Cleansers and this is by far the better for me. I have normal to oily skin and the other products were just too harsh on my face. Left my skin dry and actually increased my breakouts. After a few weeks back on  Essential-C my skin is back to normal and feeling great!</li>
    <li> I absolutely LOVE this Cleanser and the whole entire line. I am a mixed black, white, and indian woman with a medium skin tone and when I tell you I had severe hyperpigmentation - it was SEVERE, I had to use full coverage foundation and tried everything you can possibly think of to clear it. Eventually I went to MassageEnvy and received a facial, my face looked amazing because they use these products. I purchased this cleanser and fell in love and eventually went to buy the whole entire kit. My face has NEVER looked and felt this good, I even use the PEEL.  If you have had an occasional breakout that ALWAYS leaves a mark, have hyperpigmentation/scars you&#x27;ve had for a long time, have no fear...Murad is here! I don&#x27;t even have to leave the house with an ounce of makeup anymore with continued use of about 2 months. It&#x27;s pricey for everything, but extremely worth it.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for many years and like it very much, but am always looking for a better price. Amazon delivers.</li>
    <li> I usually use Murad&#x27;s acne cleanser, but needed something more gentle for the mornings. Very happy with this, gentle and smells wonderful.</li>
    <li> Murad Cleanser it a great face washing product.  It really cleans your face without drying it out.  It leaves your face feeling nice and soft.</li>
    <li> Good product.  Like buying here cause I don&#x27;t have to make store hours but the price is no better or worse then  anywhere.  But I have acne prone and weather aged skin.  This product is perfect addition to a healthy skin regimen.</li>
    <li> Love this cleanser.  Smells good and not harsh. I use this with the night and day moisturizer. I have seen a difference in my skin within a week.</li>
    <li> I use this every day morning and night. My skin feels clean  soft. The smell is very pleasant too. I am sticking with it.</li>
    <li> Murad is one of the leading brands when it comes to cleaners.  This product proved to work as it said it would.  The product gave me the moisture I needed.</li>
    <li> I used to buy the travel size versions of this when I was in grad school because I couldn&#x27;t afford anything bigger. When I saw this on Amazon I scooped it up because you can see drastic results in a matter of a week. This stuff really helps to improve skin and discoloration. It&#x27;s the perfect cleanser.</li>
    <li> Live this product. Great price</li>
    <li> I have been using Murad&#x27;s Vitamin C Cleanser for years and still can&#x27;t find another face cleanser that even compares. It&#x27;s great for washing off eye makeup without stinging your eyes. I find this so valuable in a face cleanser. There are so many products that burn or leave residue. Not Murad! There is NO residue...just squeeky clean skin. A little bit goes a long way. I buy it here because it costs $12 less than the beauty supply stores. I have sensitive skin too and this cleanser have never cause any irritation. I would recommend this to anyone that wants clean and fresh skin.</li>
    <li> I use Murad products for all my face and acne needs.  I use this face wash every morning and my face is nice and clean without any residue.  Love it.</li>
    <li> I learned about this cleanser when I was getting a facial.  The beautician recommended it.  I love it because it cleans my face of all dirt, oil and makeup really well but it does not dry my skin at all!  I really like the way my skin feels after using this product.  I recommend it!</li>
    <li> I have bought this product 3 or 4 times already. I use it every morning and love it! I replace other face wash with this one.</li>
    <li> I have been using the Environmental Sheild Cleanser for about 4 years now. Over the past 20 years I have tried almost all of the Murad products.  I have very sensitive skin and this cleanser works best for me. I have combination skin that breaks out at times. I need to moisturize my cheeks while using powder to &amp;#34;sop&amp;#34; up the oil in my T zone. This not only makes my skin tone more even it helps with breakouts. I noticed a difference the very first time I used it.  My skin glows and looks amazing after I wash it.  This works better for me on break outs then the Murad line for acne which is too strong for my skin.  Amazon is the best place for pricing on this product and all Murad products.  Even if you are a Murad member and get their regular discount it is still cheaper to buy on Amazon. A perfect Murad moisturizer is Hydro-Dynamic Ultimate Moisture.  You only need to apply in the morning and it last all day and through the night.  I&#x27;ve never had a cream work so well. I&#x27;m 46 and not a single wrinkle. knock on wood.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like most sunscreens because they are too heavy and make my face too shiny (even oil free). This is the best I&#x27;ve come across so far. Light weight, but still leaves some shine. I hope the vitamin C has positive benefits to skin.</li>
    <li> I love the way this cleanser smells and makes my skin feel.</li>
    <li> This is my second time buying this product and just love it.  It leaves my face feeling really clean and soft.</li>
    <li> This is a good cleaner but was hoping for a heavier citrus fragrance.  It does clean well, but I don&#x27;t know if I will buy this again.</li>
    <li> I received the product using Prime. It was curious  that the order was filled by HBC Depot which is not even on the list of sellers. That said, it was sealed and shrink wrapped in a Murad box. It does appear to be the real product and not a fake. This is the only product I want to use on my face and it isn&#x27;t dry anymore. It will last a long time because you only need a small amount.   June 25, 2015   This size lasted me a year! I just reordered today. I cannot see myself not using this to wash my face with this in the morning.</li>
    <li> Great product and great price.</li>
    <li> Best facial cleaner i&#x27;ve ever used. it feels clean and fresh, doesn&#x27;t leave any residue and you don&#x27;t need to use much to thouroghly clean your face and neck.</li>
    <li> Good stuff.  Arrived quickly, product as described.</li>
    <li> I have oily/dry skin and this cleanser seems to work well for me. Doesn&#x27;t do anything amazing but doesn&#x27;t damage my skin either!</li>
    <li> Does not irritate my sensitive older skin. Better results than anything I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
    <li> Was good but since we (my husband too) used this twice a day it was impractical and expensive to keep purchasing on line.&lt;br /&gt;Fortunately I found a great substitute at my local CVs, which is Jason&#x27;s Ester-C Super-C Cleanser, a bit cheaper too!</li>
    <li> I have tried many face washes for my acne and this is the best I have tried. The scent is not overwhelming and it gets the job done.</li>
    <li> Nice scent and non drying</li>
    <li> Received item as described and very quick. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Feels clean, fresh, and great for my oily skin</li>
    <li> love the smell and a great skin cleaner for aging skin</li>
    <li> I love this cleanser. It&#x27;s a perfect fit for those hot summer months when it&#x27;s hot and humid. It helps with excess oil and dirt without over drying. I do have to watch the usage in the winter though. It tends to be drying in cold, dry weather.</li>
    <li> This cleanser gets the job done.  Yet, most cleansers do.  I do notice a difference when I use it with my Clarisonic.  But, that is probably the Clarisonic and not so much the Vitamin C cleanser.  I will go back to the Murad clarifying cleaner which leaves my skin feeling soft, smooth and glowing.  I don&#x27;t know why I switched in the first place.  You know us girls, we&#x27;re always looking for something new to try.</li>
    <li> Excellent product!  I have trouble finding this product at local beauty stores.  They don&#x27;t seem to do a good job with stocking this product</li>
    <li> I need something a little more powerful/&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like their acne wash, I&#x27;ve used it for year, but wanted to try this one because it&#x27;s orange, haha.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I prefer the Acne was by Murad.</li>
