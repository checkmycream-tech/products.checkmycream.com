    <li> right now i cant tell the length of my hair because it still looks the same. but this definitely works my hair has grown alot love it</li>
    <li> I was told about this product in the barber shop in Atlanta, last year when I visited friends.  I told the barber who was cutting my friends hair off.  I said I am trying to grow hair, he recommended doo gro.  I went to the beauty supply store, Sally&#x27;s and got the Mega Long hair vitalizer.  It works, I have been using for a year in my hair.  Sally&#x27;s here in Albuquerque, NM stopped carrying it.  That is why I had to order from Amazon.  Now that you have all the doo gro products, at a reasonable price, I will be ordering here from now on.  I have been telling family and friends about it.  Oh by the way, I am African American.  I don&#x27;t think other races can use it....hmmmm  Thanks amazon for being there for me....smile</li>
    <li> The Mega Long Hair Vitalizer has become a part of my daily regiment.  This product is not sold in the region of the country in which I reside. I am so thankful to Amazon for making it available.  The product arrived earlier than expected.  The product arrived in excellent condition.  I would strongly recommend this product to people of color living in a dry climate.</li>
    <li> i have the wrong product what i have it not what i order i have doo gro mega thick hair vitalizer this is not what i order i order mega long hair vitalizer</li>
    <li> my hair did not grow any faster, but its a decent moisturizer</li>
    <li> As advertised, good product, a bit greasy, but protects hair &amp; allows it to grow at its natural healthy pace.</li>
    <li> It says made for all types of hair and I found it to be so oily that I couldn&#x27;t even shampoo the greasiness out, but I have only been using it for 4 days so I still have hopes it will help</li>
    <li> You have to try some things for yourself. I absolutely love this product and I am seeing results from using it. Gonna buy more.</li>
    <li> This is thick hair grease type consistency yet it is surprisingly very light. It  melts right into your scalp and doesnt leave your hair greasy or your hair weighed down. Although this vitalizer does contain petroleum, this doesnt affect my usage of this product. I just use it sparingly. This also has great ingredients such as avocado oil, olive oil and safflower oil. Safflower oil is packed with ceremides which is great for the hair.  These among other ingredients in the Doo Gro Mega Long Vitalizer all work together to help keep hair moisturized to prevent breakage thus allowing your hair to grow longer. Another repurchase.</li>
    <li> I also use the mega long reconstructor this works great during style or greasing the hair it&#x27;s a great moisturizer and not greasy like triple strength by doo gro! In two days of use, i had over an inch of new growth and it was very soft leaves your hair silky soft!</li>

    <li> Really great for my scalp in keeping it healthy!</li>
    <li> The hair oil leaves your hair with a glossy shine.  Doo Gro Hair Vitalizer has a very&lt;br /&gt;pleasant smell, but I did not find any new hair growth since using the hair oil for&lt;br /&gt;a month.</li>
    <li> this product is not too greasy, and keeps your hair moisted. It is great and it keeps my hair in place. Thank you</li>
    <li> Smells great but I didn&#x27;t know is was greasy; thought it was a cream. Not sure yet if it does what its purported to do.</li>
    <li> Fast delivery, I think it&#x27;s working already or it might just be me or the braids but I&#x27;m happy I purchased this product.</li>
    <li> I love using mega long by Doo Gro because it not only grows the hair but is quite a good moisturizer and makes the hair quite soft. Strangely, this product is very scarce in stores so buying from Amazon is a good option.</li>
    <li> No GOOD, used it 4 times my hair is coming out in clumps. My hair was healthy and strong and long. Now i can&#x27;t even touch my hair without a couple strands sticking to my hand.</li>
