      <li>I absolutely love it.</li>
      <li>Absolutely my favorite.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend !!!!!</li>
      <li>/&gt;So far, so good!</li>
      <li>I won&#x27;t be using it VERY much after I get my nails in good shape</li>
      <li>Now they are looking great au natural.  </li>
      <li>The oil has a nice fresh smell.</li>
      <li>The crisp scent is nice and not too overpowering.</li>
      <li>I noticed a huge improvement in my nails.  </li>
      <li>Going to get fragrance free</li>
      <li>Love this, I can&#x27;t say enough good things about it.</li>
      <li>The pen is so easy to keep with me and holds way more than i would of guessed the first time around.</li>
      <li>I have found the one nail oil that cures my dry skin as well as make my nails healthy and strong too!!</li>
      <li>and it actually smells pretty great too.</li>
      <li>This has helped sooo much:)</li>
      <li>The pen is super convenient.  </li>
      <li>I got the crisp and love the smell, its a Really relaxing scent.</li>
      <li>The Crisp scent is a nice soft scent, but I do prefer unscented.</li>
      <li>Then I have read on some blogs and sites about this nail oil and have seen lots of success and wanted to give it a go.</li>
      <li>I must say though, that the comments about the &#x27;crisp&#x27; fragrance are true.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;After two days now, my nails feel far more stronger than they were.</li>
      <li>Such a sweet smell too!!</li>
      <li>It actually took about a month for me to notice any difference, but it dawned on me one day that my nails were starting to look even and the de-lamination was greatly reduced.  </li>
      <li>but was not blessed with strong natural nails.  </li>
      <li>I wash my hands frequently and my cuticles get very, very day.&lt;br /&gt;product convenient packaging and easy to use.</li>
      <li>Thanks Bliss Kiss!</li>
      <li>so I didn&#x27;t apply the oil probably as often as I should have at first.  </li>
      <li>I used to love a similar product by Avon, but they discontinued it.  </li>
      <li>I am not a fan of the crisp smell.</li>
      <li>Oh and did I mention the smell is absolutely divine!  </li>
      <li>Thanks!</li>
      <li>Seems quite similar - a good replacement, though I think the Body Shop almond oil is now my favorite (a little thicker, really helps cuticles and fingers).</li>
      <li>Immediately dry, cracked cuticles look better.  </li>
      <li>So I really started to examine my nails.  </li>
      <li>I really like the fragrance and my nails</li>
      <li>Absorbs fast and cuticles are softer.</li>
      <li>and it really works-</li>
      <li>It works really well</li>
      <li>I like this product, but it doesn&#x27;t give you much bang for the buck.</li>
      <li>Used as often as recommended, this moisturized my cuticles and nails really well.  </li>
      <li>I was not even able to use Bliss as directed (they want you to apply it frequently the first few days).  </li>
      <li>Very dry, deep ridges and they break very easily.  </li>
      <li>, maybe a few bare soaks a few times a week, defiantly will pick up some more! :)</li>
      <li>I found this, as I was having trouble getting my long-time favorite Sally Hansen.  </li>
      <li>But a bit pricey normally (had a discount code).</li>
      <li>My nails are usually ridge filled, dry, and break and tear easily.</li>
      <li>I will of course be trimming off all the old growth and let the new growth with the help of this oil!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It leaves my cuticles soft and repaired as promised.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been really with the overall look and health of my nails since I&#x27;ve started using this oil.  </li>
      <li>I live in a very dry climate and wash my hands frequently at work.  </li>
      <li>Other cuticle oils I&#x27;ve owned have lasted much longer.</li>
      <li>The price is slightly high, for how long one pen lasts (I use it multiple times a day), so I&#x27;ll have to order the larger refill size at some point.  </li>
      <li>In the past that would have meant that I had snapped the tip of my very short fingernail right off.  </li>
      <li>I always use too much or not enough and half of it winds up on the rug-</li>
      <li>REALLY wish that I took pictures before I started, but my nails would show every singly little crease and crack from spots peeling and whatnot.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Best cuticle oil out there. Absolutely my favorite.</li>
    <li> This cuticle oil smells amazing, and works wonders for my cuticles!</li>
    <li> Works well, but goes fast and is too expensive to purchase again.</li>
    <li> I dont leave reviews ever but im on my second day and my sore hangnails and peeling skin is now going away and oesnt hurt!!! We be buying the kit soon.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s good cuticlw oil but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s quite as great as they say!</li>
    <li> Great product, easy to use</li>
    <li> Very good.  I found this, as I was having trouble getting my long-time favorite Sally Hansen.  Seems quite similar - a good replacement, though I think the Body Shop almond oil is now my favorite (a little thicker, really helps cuticles and fingers).</li>
    <li> I like this product, but it doesn&#x27;t give you much bang for the buck. Other cuticle oils I&#x27;ve owned have lasted much longer.</li>
    <li> The best thing I like about this product is that it is convenient to use and moisturizes without that oily feeling. I have only used it for a couple of days. I am not sure if it will help my extremely dry snagging skin and peeling nails.  I am not a fan of the crisp smell. Going to get fragrance free so I have one in my purse and one by my sink.</li>
    <li> Works great. nice smell etc</li>
    <li> AWESOME!!! I buy this on a regular. Simple to use and it actually smells pretty great too. It leaves my cuticles soft and repaired as promised.</li>
    <li> I have horribly dry hands and my cuticles tend to be a disaster I have tried and spilled my share of cuticle oils- I always use too much or not enough and half of it winds up on the rug- NOT with this-The pen measures the amount out so very nicely and i can use it ANYWHERE and it really works- i am a tough case to crack and my cracks are gone- My cuticles are looking great THANK YOU FOR A SUPER PRODUCT!!!</li>
    <li> If you have weak or peeling nails you MUST try this!  It is based on what our nails actually need and what will work for them.  You will be amazed at your nails after just 3 days...yes I said 3 days!  The pen is super convenient.  It won&#x27;t spill or leak, it will just make your nails beautiful!  If Amazon could let me give it 10 stars I would!  Oh and did I mention the smell is absolutely divine!  Just spend the few bucks and watch your nails transform!</li>
    <li> My nails are usually ridge filled, dry, and break and tear easily. Since using Bliss Kiss for 14 days they&#x27;ve never been stronger or longer. This oil is a must for all.</li>
    <li> Smells great and my nails are slowly becoming stronger</li>
    <li> My second time purchasing this oil because I just can&#x27;t get enough of it. The pen is so easy to keep with me and holds way more than i would of guessed the first time around. Such a sweet smell too!!</li>
    <li> Used as often as recommended, this moisturized my cuticles and nails really well.  I used up this pen in about a week or two and reordered the refill kit with extra pen.  I keep one at my bedside and the other one goes with me everywhere!  The Crisp scent is a nice soft scent, but I do prefer unscented.</li>
    <li> I used to love a similar product by Avon, but they discontinued it.  So, when I ran out of it I searched and Amazon lead me to this.  It works great!  If your hands get trashed from gardening, or washing the car, or whatever.....just wash up, apply this and let it soak in.  Immediately dry, cracked cuticles look better.  So happy to find this!</li>
    <li> I have been searching for a nail oil that will actually absorb and help me dry cuticles and cracked corners. I have used all the name brand stuff like Sally Hansen and Essie and even went to my local Sally Beauty and used numerous cuticle oils they had but still no luck. Then I have read on some blogs and sites about this nail oil and have seen lots of success and wanted to give it a go. Well I am not disappointed at all!!! I have found the one nail oil that cures my dry skin as well as make my nails healthy and strong too!! I am so amazed at how quickly you see results as well as how wonderful my skin/nails look now! I am so happy I found and bought this stuff, by far the best nail oil there is!! Thank you Bliss Kiss!!!</li>
    <li> Love this, I can&#x27;t say enough good things about it. The nail oil smells so good, and is so easy to use. I use it everyday. I did the 3 day get naked challenge and my nails and cuticals were beautiful after I finished. Please just try it, you won&#x27;t be sorry.</li>
    <li> I love the pen. I can control the amount of oil that goes on your cuticles. The oil has a nice fresh smell.</li>
    <li> Love Love Love this nail oil. I got the crisp and love the smell, its a Really relaxing scent. My cuticles weren&#x27;t bad but I needed something to help my nails as they&#x27;ve been getting a little weak and breaking often. This has helped sooo much:)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been really with the overall look and health of my nails since I&#x27;ve started using this oil.  The crisp scent is nice and not too overpowering. The pen is a convenient applicator for the oil and the oil itself is a &amp;#34;drier&amp;#34; type.  My nails have been peeling for about a year now and this has made improvements in that.  It recommends using it constantly but I dont (forget/time restraints), however it does still seem to be improving my nail health.</li>
    <li> I wish I had researched this a bit more, because I would have bought the starter kit. The recommended process for this has a warning that the pen alone will be gone in 5 days. I like the stuff, just now looking for a deal on the starter kit.</li>
    <li> Cuticle oil is amazing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d never heard of cuticle oil until I started searching Instagram for nail ideas for St. Patrick&#x27;s Day.  Everyone used cuticle oil.  Once I looked into it, I knew I needed to try it.  My cuticles were always dry, and my nails were weak.  This stuff is good.  it smells nice, and it goes on easily, and non-greasy.  I noticed a huge improvement in my nails.  No more dry gross cuticles and hangnails.  The price is slightly high, for how long one pen lasts (I use it multiple times a day), so I&#x27;ll have to order the larger refill size at some point.  There is another oil I found on etsy that I like slightly better, but this was my gateway to nail oils!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love it. I work with papers all day which dry out my nails. Since using my Bliss Kiss Pen....I have noticed they are not as try. Glad I decided to try it. Thanks!</li>
    <li> Bought for myself and has helped.  Absorbs fast and cuticles are softer. But a bit pricey normally (had a discount code). Don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;ll buy refill or other indie makers cuticle oil.</li>
    <li> I have always wanted beautiful nails, (who hasn&#x27;t?) but was not blessed with strong natural nails.  For several years I would travel once a month to have acrylics put on and maintained but when the economy tanked, my unnecessary nails were the first expense to go.  I came across Bliss Kiss Pure Cuticle &amp; Nail Oil while searching the internet for strengthening nail polishes such as the Hard as Nails brand.  I was skeptical that this product would work for me as I have very brittle nails that &#x27;de-laminate&#x27; and split very badly.  I am a frugal person so I didn&#x27;t apply the oil probably as often as I should have at first.  I must say though, that the comments about the &#x27;crisp&#x27; fragrance are true.  It is very nice and I catch myself &#x27;sniffing&#x27; my nails after I apply the oil.  It actually took about a month for me to notice any difference, but it dawned on me one day that my nails were starting to look even and the de-lamination was greatly reduced.  I actually reached for something the other day and hit my middle fingernail head-on.  In the past that would have meant that I had snapped the tip of my very short fingernail right off.  To my amazement, although the nail bent a little, it didn&#x27;t break!  A total miracle for me.  So I really started to examine my nails.  In the past, if I pressed on the tip of my nail it would bend until it touched the tip of my finger. Now it is so much stronger, it doesn&#x27;t bend at all (or very little), and there is almost no evidence of any of my nails splitting or the layers de-laminating and I am thrilled.  I haven&#x27;t applied any type of polish for over a month as I used to use it as a way to try to seal and strengthen my nails.  Now they are looking great au natural.  I will continue to use this product as it has surely helped the over-all health of my nails.  Thanks Bliss Kiss!</li>
    <li> My mom and aunt both pushed me to try this nail oil.  It delivers!  I live in a very dry climate and wash my hands frequently at work.  My nails were weak and peeling.  I was not even able to use Bliss as directed (they want you to apply it frequently the first few days).  I put it on at night while I was watching TV.  My nails are so healthy!  I have not even finished the pen and my nails began growing.  The peeling is gone and the ridges are diminishing.  I cannot recommend this product enough.  You won&#x27;t be sorry.</li>
    <li> Let me start by saying I have awful nails.....truly awful.  Very dry, deep ridges and they break very easily.  This oil has helped tremendously but even with that they&#x27;re still pretty bad.  I will definitely keep using for at least a year to see what overall improvement can be had.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The application pen is great - I can keep one in my purse and one at home - very easy and convenient.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The &amp;#34;crisp&amp;#34; scent is very nice - I would wear it as a perfume if I could, and I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;m alone in that.  Perhaps a broadening of the product line is in order??</li>
    <li> I got this from here, but on my husbands account! :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been wanting to try this for ages, since I found it surfing for things to help my nails recover from acrylics. My nails were a bit iffy before, but after they pretty much got worse, and my regular lotion/nail moisturizers didn&#x27;t seem to be cutting it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I REALLY wish that I took pictures before I started, but my nails would show every singly little crease and crack from spots peeling and whatnot. After the first application, after a few minutes I could feel a few of my nails seemed to tighten. I didn&#x27;t do the 3 day hydration thing, I&#x27;m just doing it intermittently throughout the day when I&#x27;m going to be sitting for a while, and I avoid &amp;#34;rubbing&amp;#34; it in (I just feel that everything I put on my nail is just going to get soaked up by my finger!), and after about 30 min~an hour my nails are all soaked up and shiny!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After two days now, my nails feel far more stronger than they were. NO more showing of any peeling/cracks, and even on one of my thumb nails where there was a small bit of nail peeling up, has seemed to fuse back down. I will of course be trimming off all the old growth and let the new growth with the help of this oil!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far, so good! I&#x27;m certainly impressed with it. I won&#x27;t be using it VERY much after I get my nails in good shape, maybe a few bare soaks a few times a week, defiantly will pick up some more! :)</li>
    <li> It works really well I really like the fragrance and my nails look better too.</li>
    <li> works great! I wash my hands frequently and my cuticles get very, very day.&lt;br /&gt;product convenient packaging and easy to use.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff !!!!! I highly recommend !!!!!</li>
