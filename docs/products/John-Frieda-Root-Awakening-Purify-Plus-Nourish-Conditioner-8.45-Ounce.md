      <li>i first tryed it while at my aunts house and was impressed, so i went and bought myself a bottle.</li>
      <li>Placing my order now for more!</li>
      <li>Not as amazing as the shampoo.</li>
      <li>I also find I don&#x27;t have to use leave-in conditioner or gel anymore to help my hair have a nice shape and reduce flyaways.</li>
      <li>It smells so nice.</li>
      <li>I just wished the scent was stronger, but it smells pleasant - not too strong.  </li>
      <li>First the smell is wonderful, very fresh not overpowering.</li>
      <li>My scalp is oily and my very fine hair looks greasy after 24 hours.  </li>
      <li>This is the first time I&#x27;ve been truly happy with a shampoo/conditioner.  </li>
      <li>and my hair feels a lot better.</li>
      <li>Love the smell</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;ve been pleased every time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I love this stuff.</li>
      <li>and this makes it feel soo much better.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s her favorite conditioner.</li>
      <li>Love this shampoo &amp; conditoner.</li>
      <li>(Just like most all John Frieda Products)</li>
      <li>and then I apply some olive oil leave in conditioner when I get out of the shower. : )</li>
      <li>Many shampoos I&#x27;ve tried cause me to have a buildup or reaction on my scalp that is almost like a scab</li>
      <li>I received sample packets of this shampoo and conditioner and absolutely love this stuff.</li>
      <li>Love the peppermint smell</li>
      <li>Love it...</li>
      <li>I had high hopes that this would be a great conditioner, but it&#x27;s not.</li>
      <li>I got this because I have fine hair and was looking for something that would give me body and keep my scalp healthy.</li>
      <li>this conditioner is great at making my hair soft, shiny and manageable.  </li>
      <li>I have really curly hair, so I need good conditioner.</li>
      <li>I loved this shampoo sooo much.</li>
      <li>This stuff smells super good and makes my hair feel supa freshy fresh.</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s true!</li>
      <li>Love this conditioner - works great with the coordinating shampoo on my sometimes greasy scalp without adding too much extra moisture!</li>
      <li>Not bad, but maybe could use more slip.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down and it smells great!!</li>
      <li>If you don&#x27;t have that problem, then this product is fine.</li>
      <li>My hair felt smooth when I rinsed the conditioner.</li>
      <li>It was like the cheap conditioner you buy in the store for $2 (Suave, etc).</li>
      <li>My hair feels so silky and the smell is fantastic.</li>
      <li>Really, this stuff is sitting on my shelf, and I&#x27;ve gone back to my original stuff - which is awesome (Joico K Pak)!</li>
      <li>The shampoo suds up nicely and really had a clean feel.</li>
      <li>A quick blow dry and my hair feels great and in control without any fly-a-ways.</li>
      <li>It smells pretty good and makes my hair feel soft</li>
      <li>This conditioner smells great, but it&#x27;s a little too rich for me.  </li>
      <li>This is definitely my all time favorite shampoo!</li>
      <li>Overall its a nice conditioner, but nothing to write home about.</li>
      <li>It tingles and feels really fresh.</li>
      <li>it makes my hair feel fresh and soft, and i love the tingling feeling when its on.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve bought this conditioner from CVS and the supermarket numerous times and love it.</li>
      <li>Keeps my hair soft and smooth.</li>
      <li>But using this shampoo my hair comes out straight and silky without even brushing or combing my hair out!</li>
      <li>It has a good scent, but for me it&#x27;s not so heavy</li>
      <li>I have long, very fine hair that I highlight.</li>
      <li>It seems to dull my hair more than anything, leaving it more limp/lifeless.</li>
      <li>So if you have really long hair, this would probably work better for you.</li>
      <li>Smells lovely and leaves hair feeling clean not greasy or heavy.</li>
      <li>I love it for my dry and frizzy hair.  </li>
      <li>and it makes my hair super soft afterward.    </li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s not nourishing enough to keep my fine / oily hair moisturized.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I had high hopes for this product, at first I used it on my head and all of my hair...</li>
      <li>It does what it says on the bottle (which doesn&#x27;t happen  much).  </li>
      <li>so I didn&#x27;t really save any money by getting this.</li>
      <li>I have a very oily scalp, and for this reason I used to have hair loss.</li>
      <li>a no-no, so I don&#x27;t really understand the marketing of this product.</li>
      <li>but I don&#x27;t feel like its doing much for my scalp or giving my hair body but for a shampoo I like it.</li>
      <li>Thanks Amazon for always having what I need.</li>
      <li>I thought I was getting a deal by getting it from Amazon, but instead of the creamy white conditioner that normally smooths my hair nicely, I got this soupy translucent stuff which I had to use double the conditioner than I normally use, thus the product was gone faster</li>
      <li>I have a very oily scalp and I was hoping that this would help as it came highly recommended by a salon.</li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t confuse these with the kind for dry hair which has a similar package.</li>
      <li>My hair is left clean, less &amp;#34;poofy&amp;#34;, not greasy, and more manageable.</li>
      <li>It smells nice and natural, not strong and sort of like a tee tree or minty.</li>
      <li>I regularly color my hair and it&#x27;s already predisposed to being dry, so I have issues finding conditioners that make my hair feel nice and soft.  </li>
      <li>With Root Awakening Products I don&#x27;t have to wash my hair daily; it&#x27;s fresh for another 24 hours.  </li>
      <li>I have tried many different shampoos and conditioners and they may work for a few days but nothing consistently.</li>
      <li>range).&lt;br /&gt;I have been consistently buying from Amazon because my local stores stopped carrying it about a year ago</li>
      <li>Soft &amp; Shiny, Thank you!</li>
      <li>or I look like a 3rd day hair for most other women.</li>
      <li>I was hoping this would be a little more intensely conditioning on my long normal hair.</li>
      <li>I really don&#x27;t like other John Frieda products, but I love this Dry Hair conditioner!!</li>
      <li>Overall, my hair feels soft and looks very shiny.</li>
      <li>My hair (which is curly and can feel coarse at times) is much softer when I use it.</li>
      <li>My hair feels soft and shiny after using it.</li>
      <li>I first tried the Dry Scalp line from my boyfriend and I was surprised that it works.</li>
      <li>Worth every cent spent!</li>
      <li>Decent product overall.</li>

    <li> I got this because I have fine hair and was looking for something that would give me body and keep my scalp healthy. It smells pretty good and makes my hair feel soft but I don&#x27;t feel like its doing much for my scalp or giving my hair body but for a shampoo I like it. Probably will not buy again.</li>
    <li> I just bought and tried this product. My hair feels so silky and the smell is fantastic. (Just like most all John Frieda Products) I can&#x27;t wait to try this with my heat cap!</li>
    <li> This shampoo is unlike any other shampoo I&#x27;ve tried. It smells so nice. I have very thick, wavy/curly hair that takes HOURS to straighten professionally so I&#x27;ve given that up. But using this shampoo my hair comes out straight and silky without even brushing or combing my hair out! I have NO idea how this happens but it&#x27;s true! This is definitely my all time favorite shampoo! (This is without the conditioner, which I&#x27;ve yet to try.)</li>
    <li> I received sample packets of this shampoo and conditioner and absolutely love this stuff. First the smell is wonderful, very fresh not overpowering. The shampoo suds up nicely and really had a clean feel. My hair felt smooth when I rinsed the conditioner. A quick blow dry and my hair feels great and in control without any fly-a-ways. Soft &amp; Shiny, Thank you! Placing my order now for more!</li>
    <li> I was hoping this would be a little more intensely conditioning on my long normal hair. I think I prefer a heavier conditioner. Not bad, but maybe could use more slip. Also I&#x27;ve always thought putting conditioner on your roots was a no-no, so I don&#x27;t really understand the marketing of this product. Maybe if you have dandruff or dry scalp this winter, try this. It smells nice and natural, not strong and sort of like a tee tree or minty.</li>
    <li> Excellent product. Worth every cent spent!</li>
    <li> This is the first time I&#x27;ve been truly happy with a shampoo/conditioner.  It does what it says on the bottle (which doesn&#x27;t happen  much).  And the smell is so relaxing!</li>
    <li> works good on my hair. i first tryed it while at my aunts house and was impressed, so i went and bought myself a bottle. it makes my hair feel fresh and soft, and i love the tingling feeling when its on. i also nodiced my hair seems to grow faster while using this. i have fragile damaged hair thats colored and this makes it feel soo much better.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. I have very thick, very wavy hair and this is the best day-to-day conditioner I&#x27;ve found (I&#x27;ve tried everything in every price range).&lt;br /&gt;I have been consistently buying from Amazon because my local stores stopped carrying it about a year ago and I&#x27;ve been pleased every time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh my gosh and is the smell is fantastic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended for regular use.</li>
    <li> Best line of shampoo and conditioner I&#x27;ve ever used. I have an oily scalp and my hair is dry and with a lot of volume, it helps it stay in place.</li>
    <li> i buy this for my daughter. it&#x27;s her favorite conditioner.</li>
    <li> Love this shampoo &amp; conditoner. I have been using it years.</li>
    <li> i did not try it in my hair yet but before i bought it that&#x27;s why again order same quality</li>
    <li> The conditioner must be a bad product that the company turned out and then sold to Amazon for cheaper. I&#x27;ve bought this conditioner from CVS and the supermarket numerous times and love it. I thought I was getting a deal by getting it from Amazon, but instead of the creamy white conditioner that normally smooths my hair nicely, I got this soupy translucent stuff which I had to use double the conditioner than I normally use, thus the product was gone faster so I didn&#x27;t really save any money by getting this. It was like the cheap conditioner you buy in the store for $2 (Suave, etc). I have really curly hair, so I need good conditioner. If you don&#x27;t have that problem, then this product is fine.</li>
    <li> This is a great product.  My scalp is oily and my very fine hair looks greasy after 24 hours.  With Root Awakening Products I don&#x27;t have to wash my hair daily; it&#x27;s fresh for another 24 hours.  I will be regularly ordering this product and the shampoo.</li>
    <li> I regularly color my hair and it&#x27;s already predisposed to being dry, so I have issues finding conditioners that make my hair feel nice and soft.  This stuff is great! It has a nice minty/eucalyptus smell (and it tingles!) and it makes my hair super soft afterward.    I really don&#x27;t like other John Frieda products, but I love this Dry Hair conditioner!!</li>
    <li> I loved this shampoo sooo much. Unfortunately, I received different product from what I ordered, but the worst thing is that the bottle was broken and conditioner spilled all over the package. I would return, but I have nothing to return. Thank you for such disappointment!</li>
    <li> I have a very oily scalp and I was hoping that this would help as it came highly recommended by a salon. Unfortunately it seems to have made it worse. I would not recommend this product if you are looking for something to help oily scalps.</li>
    <li> I have very thick and dry hair. I went from using TIGI from this and my hair feels a lot better. I used the L&#x27;Oreal Professionnel Serie Expert Liss Ultime Polymer in the past and it works equally as well but for cheaper.</li>
    <li> I like it a lot. It tingles and feels really fresh. My hair feels soft and shiny after using it. The only thing I don&#x27;t like is its hard to rinse out.</li>
    <li> Love the peppermint smell but it&#x27;s not nourishing enough to keep my fine / oily hair moisturized.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m the oily girl where I need a daily shampoo or I look like a 3rd day hair for most other women. I had high hopes for this product, at first I used it on my head and all of my hair... Yes it tingles on the scalp but that&#x27;s all it did other than make me smell like a candy cane. My hair below the ear is still as dry and frizzed as when I don&#x27;t condition. Even hair on the top of my head, random hairs not all, are still frizz and going every which way.</li>
    <li> Not as amazing as the shampoo. Overall its a nice conditioner, but nothing to write home about. Decent product overall.</li>
    <li> Many shampoos I&#x27;ve tried cause me to have a buildup or reaction on my scalp that is almost like a scab (Gross I know!) I have been searching high and low for a shampoo that truly cleans my scalp without making my hair feel like straw. This is it!  My hair is left clean, less &amp;#34;poofy&amp;#34;, not greasy, and more manageable. Bonus: It smells really good!</li>
    <li> Leaves my dry hair soft. You get a lot for your money. I have tried several more expensive products that do not work as well.</li>
    <li> This conditioner smells great, but it&#x27;s a little too rich for me.  I purchased it to go with the Nourish Shampoo, which has been great for my oily scalp.  But the conditioner seems to undo some of the work done by the shampoo and had made my scalp oily again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have shoulder length hair and try to put it just at the ends, but some will end up at the base of my scalp (which is where it has been oiliest).  So if you have really long hair, this would probably work better for you.</li>
    <li> The only conditioner my daughter can use. Her scalp is extremely oily, but the rest of her hair is not &amp; this product helps to keep the oil down withot drying her hair out.</li>
    <li> Love this! Always leaves my hair and scalp feeling amazing! Smells wonderful.</li>
    <li> This stuff smells super good and makes my hair feel supa freshy fresh.</li>
    <li> Smells lovely and leaves hair feeling clean not greasy or heavy.</li>
    <li> Exactly as I expected and what I was looking for</li>
    <li> this conditioner is great at making my hair soft, shiny and manageable.  It doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down and it smells great!!</li>
    <li> This set is a really good option for oily scalp. I have a very oily scalp, and for this reason I used to have hair loss. Since I&#x27;m using this shampoo and its conditioner, my hair stopped falling and the scalp is much less oily. But it only works if I wash my hair everyday and if I only use conditioner at the end of the hair. It has a good scent, but for me it&#x27;s not so heavy and that&#x27;s a problem. Don&#x27;t confuse these with the kind for dry hair which has a similar package.</li>
    <li> I had high hopes that this would be a great conditioner, but it&#x27;s not. At least, not for me. It seems to dull my hair more than anything, leaving it more limp/lifeless. I have long, very fine hair that I highlight. I was hoping this would awaken the roots as advertised. Really, this stuff is sitting on my shelf, and I&#x27;ve gone back to my original stuff - which is awesome (Joico K Pak)!</li>
    <li> The hair was very difficult to style after using this conditioner.  Moreover, the hair gets oily and sticky after only 24 hours.  Worst hair condition I ever used.</li>
    <li> Used with the shampoo and it smells good but my hair was super hard to comb through after using the two.</li>
    <li> I bought this conditioner and corresponding shampoo because my hair tends be extra oily especially about 20 hours after cleansing. It will look dirty like I have not washed it in days. I have tried many different shampoos and conditioners and they may work for a few days but nothing consistently. I have tried different salon tricks and still nothing. This product has worked the best and I have been using it about a year. I still have to wash my hair once a day but at least my hair looks clean for at least 24 hours! It is hard to find so I buy it on amazon...</li>
    <li> I got this because my hair was so dry after a summer outside, then a dry house in the winter. My hair (which is curly and can feel coarse at times) is much softer when I use it. I also find I don&#x27;t have to use leave-in conditioner or gel anymore to help my hair have a nice shape and reduce flyaways.</li>
    <li> I first tried the Dry Scalp line from my boyfriend and I was surprised that it works. Now for myself, I bought the Purify + Nourish, and I was amazed on how my hair felt. My hair is thick and wavy... gets oily and very dull.. this helps maintain the oiliness and boosted shine. I just wished the scent was stronger, but it smells pleasant - not too strong.  Overall, my hair feels soft and looks very shiny. Love it... I will continue to buy this.</li>
    <li> Love the smell and I keep this in my constant shampoo/conditioner rotation.  It gives my hair body and then I apply some olive oil leave in conditioner when I get out of the shower. : )</li>
    <li> The conditioner is great.  I love it for my dry and frizzy hair.  Keeps my hair soft and smooth.</li>
    <li> My favorite shampoo! John Frieda please bring it back!!! Think I bought almost all that was available!!</li>
    <li> We buy this conditioner simply to follow the Root Awakening shampoo for Oily Scalp.  Since that shampoo is the only product we&#x27;ve found to work well on my daughter&#x27;s hair, we also buy the conditioner hoping that they will continue making this product line.</li>
    <li> Love this conditioner - works great with the coordinating shampoo on my sometimes greasy scalp without adding too much extra moisture!</li>
    <li> Thanks Amazon for always having what I need.</li>
