<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Love these ! Thanks seller !</li>
    <li> Great price,must have been old stock ,stuck to package ,however will re-order next year</li>
    <li> So unique!  I&#x27;ve used the steripods for over a year now and feel so good about keeping my toothbrush in a place that can keep it protected.  And, love that it&#x27;s done with an herb naturally.</li>
    <li> I really like these. The price point isn&#x27;t too bad.</li>
    <li> easy to use, i buy plenty because i like to go through them so fast</li>
    <li> I love them. Packaged very well and sanitary. Great buy.</li>
    <li> I love these clip-on steri-pods. They keep our toothbrushes clean and sanitized. I change them every few months. Buying them in bulk (4 packs) did save me some money. Hopefully when we need more, this seller will have them available. Thank you!</li>
    <li> Travel cover! I use it everyday! Change this and my toothbrush every 3 months. I am not a germaphobe! The whole bathroom germ thought is gone. So is the thought of a fly landing on my toothbrush, or others using it.</li>
    <li> I love these things, I can&#x27;t believe I haven&#x27;t aways used them before. Great for traveling too.</li>
    <li> These fit perfectly onto almost any toothbrush...I say almost because I haven&#x27;t found one yet that it won&#x27;t fit onto but I&#x27;m sure ts possible...maybe. Even my kids big battery operated toothbrushes are compatible.&lt;br /&gt;When you first open them, they have a kind of strong smell similar to the original yellow Listerine. Not something you would want to smell all day but not unpleasant either. They work great for travel and everyday use. My kids love them and so does everyone who sees my toothbrush. I ordered a big pack of them to hand out to all my family at Christmas because everyone kept asking where I got them.</li>
    <li> My daughter originally bought these as a stocking stuffer 2 Christmas&#x27; ago.  Have been using then ever since.  Easy to use, easy to travel with and no batteries to buy.</li>
    <li> We continue to purchase this product.  The pods are well-made and you truly feel like you&#x27;re protecting your toothbrush from the toilet spray, etc.  It&#x27;s also a great travel cover.  They&#x27;re cute and have a great purpose.</li>
    <li> I used to use the top of one of those plastic cases to cover my brush head, but periodically it got crummy inside and needed a bleach soak. These are a great substitute: they fit my Spinbrush head, keep the brush head sanitary, and (despite what others said) I don&#x27;t detect any taste at all. I bought the set of 8 as the best value and because I change my Spinbrush head every 3 months along with the batteries and now the sanitizer. With the extra sets, I&#x27;ll be ready to go for quite a while.</li>
    <li> Everyone in the family loves these toothbrush protectors!  They give us piece of mind about toothbrushes that dwell in the bathroom (yuck!).  I&#x27;ll take a cleaner/more germ-free toothbrush any day.  We&#x27;ve been using these protectors for a couple of years now (replacing them as directed) and couldn&#x27;t be more delighted.</li>
    <li> I love these ... easy to use, inexpensive and they make me feel better about my toothbrush.  They fit over a regular toothbrush and my Oral-B electric toothbrush.</li>
    <li> I love these! They are so nice to keep your toothbrush clean and away from germs.  My husband and I will continue to buy these as often as we need.</li>
    <li> Great Buy, Arrived Early, Great Price.</li>
    <li> Use these all the time</li>
    <li> We love these. We have not noticed a bad taste on our brushes from using them and change them periodically. You can actually see the tablet darken so you know when to change. I do feel our brushes are cleaner for using these. It is an easy sanitation alternative to the plug in sanitizers.</li>
    <li> During cold and flu season we have to put the odds in our favor. This is one smart way to start</li>
    <li> Great product - I have been buying them singly at the grocery store - this is a MUCH better way to buy them</li>
    <li> I thought this little plastic pod was just another gimmick...Not only is it a good design, but it works...I would buy this product again.</li>
    <li> Have used these for two months and love them!  Use them on my grandson&#x27;s battery toothbrush as well as different toothbrush heads for our electic toothbrush, so glad for the different colors.  Contrary to other reviews, none have broken and have not noticed any odor or bad taste at all.  Only have to replace them every 3 months per the manufacturer&#x27;s guidelines.</li>
    <li> This is an adorable little toothbrush cover that does exactly what it says it will.  It&#x27;s an easy alligator-clip-on style device that looks a bit like a colorful UFO just landed on your toothbrush, but honestly, it&#x27;s the most fun my toothbrush has had since I was a kid.  It clearly could fit any style. Right now, it&#x27;s on my rechargeable brush.  You can smell the purifier scent as soon as you open the package.  Although the label says the disinfectant properties will only last 3 months, the cover will last for years, I&#x27;d guess. I disinfect my toothbrush by rinsing the head in mouthwash, and then clean the cover as well.  With the multi-pack, I doubt I&#x27;ll need to buy new covers for years to come.</li>
    <li> Very good for protecting tooth brush ( regular and oral B electric toothbrush)Very happy with purchase</li>
    <li> Just what I was looking for!</li>
    <li> These are handy for travel and help distinguish toothbrushes that look similar.</li>
    <li> We travel alot.  If the trip includes 3 hotels I&#x27;d take a new toothbrush for each hotel.  No more, one brush does it and despite some doubious housekeeping you know your tooth brush is safe and you can leave that ultra blue light at home!  I use them at home too, in case the cat gets up on the bathroom counter!</li>
    <li> I have no idea if these really work, but I FEEL better using them so I&#x27;m giving them 5 stars. Got them at a good price, too.</li>
    <li> I have purchased this item before.  I really liked them for traveling.  The only problem that I encountered was that they do not last very long.  The spring becomes loose; therefore the toothbrush is not secure.&lt;br /&gt;I ordered them again and hopefully they will last longer!  Last time I ordered 2, and this time I ordered 8.</li>
    <li> These little anti-germ safetly caps for our toothbrushes feel just right.  They made great stocking stuffers and we are all using them,  They smell a little like mouthwash....and I like that.  GIves me a feeling of safety for my toothbrush,  I&#x27;m ordering more.  And great for travel.</li>
    <li> When I saw this, I thought it was a great idea so I ended up buying two family packs to last for a while especially during flu season. We&#x27;ve been using them for about a month now with no complaints whatsoever.</li>
    <li> We have an in-bed truck camper, where space is limited, to say the least. And after &#x27;rockin&#x27; and a rollin&#x27; down the road, every thing in the medicine cabinet is ready to tumble out, right under the toilet. I&#x27;ve needed something to keep the toothbrushes in so that when this happens, I&#x27;m not out a brush. And it sanitizes at the same time, bonus.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s difficult to determine the efficacy of this product. I will speak to two things, discoloration and longevity. After a few days, I noticed that the inside became rusty. I had to replace them frequently. I thought they would last longer and didn&#x27;t expect the rust and discoloration.</li>
    <li> The Steripod Toothbrush Protectors have been a staple in my travel kit for a number of years now. I love that they are easy to pack, lightweight, and do not require a power source or batteries. We use electric toothbrushes (Oral-B) and they fit these brush heads very well. As an added bonus they keep my brush head securely away from questionable hotel glasses or surfaces.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At home we use UV sterilizers but these are definitely easier to take on the road than any of those other products. I kind of like the herbal/medicinal scent (strong thyme scent) as well even though that&#x27;s probably personal preference and some people might be put off by it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely recommend these.</li>
    <li> I really like the idea for this tooth brush covers. It&#x27;s sanitizing and easy to take when traveling and the bright colors helps u not to forget.</li>
    <li> Great to keep your toothbrush in.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I wanted!</li>
    <li> Love these to keep my tooth brush clean &amp; fresh.  Only problem they were kind of stuck to the foil wrap that enclosed them.  They must have been sitting around a while.</li>
    <li> I buy these for all the toothbrushes in our home.  Makes a great protective cover.</li>
    <li> I love these little pods.  They are well made and work great.  They are the perfect stocking stuffer and are worth the money.</li>
    <li> These are the greatest idea! We use them for our Sonacare at home and for our travel tooth brushes too!! We just change them every 3 months and rinse them out occasionally!!  No colds since we started using them about 2 years ago!! A really small price to pay for peace of mind!!</li>
    <li> If you want to sterilize this may be the thing for you.  It is an easy clip.  The pic does not show how big and bulky it is compared to the toothbrush head.</li>
    <li> Love these! Great for our electric toothbrushes!</li>
    <li> What a clever idea.......great for traveling....no worries when tossing my toothbrush in with my other toiletries.....I never have liked toothbrush cases......this is a much better idea.</li>
    <li> Product works great and as described.  So say that you notice a taste on your brush after storing in the pod.  I have not, there is a smell when you open the package, but that goes away in a minute or two.</li>
    <li> I like these toothbrush covers because they sanitize the brush plus the cover is a really good design to keep germs off the brush end.  I read somewhere that when you flush the toilet, germs are airborne and can land on your toothbrush if not covered.  I always use a cover but this design is better than most.</li>
    <li> These pods keep my toothbrushes clean! Wonderful invention!</li>
    <li> I bought as a gift for a daughter and family who wanted clip-on toothbrush covers without suction cups, so I really can&#x27;t testify as to their performance.  However, I am giving this item 3 stars for misleading representation.  The picture is beautiful, and I thought I was getting ALL of the beautiful colors depicted.  They arrived as 4 packages wrapped in cellophane with a pink sticker that says, &amp;#34;SOLD AS A SET.&amp;#34;  The set consists of 2 blue/green packages, 1 yellow/green package, and 1 blue/pink package for a total of 3 blue clips, 3 green clips, 1 yellow clip, and 1 pink clip.  Red and orange clips depicted in the product picture were NOT included in my set, and I am ordering a single red/orange package separately!  Colors matter to me because I purchased them for a young family with two females and one male, and I wanted more pretty colors for the girls.</li>
    <li> I love these toothbrush protectors!  They are great for daily use and travel...I know my toothbrush will be protected  I used to buy them at Walgreens, but now I can only seem to find them online.  So glad I did.</li>
    <li> I use it in college dorm bathrooms. Works really well. Smart idea. Not much to say. Cheap alternative to expensive toothbrush sanitizers.</li>
    <li> Convenient and good product to ensure hygiene for my kids. I have already ordered another set for my family. Recommend.</li>
    <li> There is a very strong sanitizing odor when you use this product.  One of the clip-ons broke in half the first week of use.  We will continue using the remaining clip-ons, but not sure if we would ever purchase again.</li>
    <li> I use this product every day, but especially like it for traveling. Before finding the Steripods, I didn&#x27;t travel with my electric toothbrush because I didn&#x27;t like my options for covering the brush head (baggie). Now it&#x27;s no problem.</li>
    <li> Great for travel and the colors are fun!</li>
    <li> Great product! My husband and I keep our toothbrushes next FTO our sinks and with the toilet being close we wanted something to protect our brushes. I did research on other sanitizers but these were cheap and the different colors were great and helpful to know which brush is his and which is mine.</li>
    <li> Keeps the my toothbrush feeling fresh.</li>
    <li> I have not had gum disease since using this product. Sure makes dental visits easier.</li>
    <li> Great product! Really like this shape over a traditional toothbrush protector. Very easy to clip on your toothbrush.</li>
    <li> These are a great way to protect your toothbrush from germs, especially while traveling.</li>
    <li> I have used Steripods before, actually, and I&#x27;ve just been slacking on getting them back in my rotation. I&#x27;ll finally get to keep a toothbrush in my purse again!!!</li>
    <li> Love these, I have given them as gifts...people just love them! We have probably bought 24 of these in the past 2 years!</li>
    <li> Good product. Delivered on time.</li>
    <li> I love how these pods protect your toothbrush! I don&#x27;t worry anymore when someone flushes the toilet with the lid open.</li>
    <li> I hate the tube like holders in the dollar section.  I am not sure if this really sterilizes or keeps it sterile, but I like the design, and it is easy and sturdy.  100% would recommend and would buy again in the future.</li>
    <li> love love love ! i wish have them in pink in whole box!</li>
    <li> These are really great - I use them @ home &amp; travel &amp; gave them as gifts last year @ Christmas.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m paranoid about germs, especially in the bathroom, so I use these religiously. I just wish they were not so expensive per pod.  Update 3/31/16: I&#x27;ve gone through two of these in the past two months and both have started leaking a lime green substance of some sort. Can&#x27;t tell what it is and whether it&#x27;s harmful or toxic but it&#x27;s concerning.</li>
    <li> We love these!!! They are so much better than the cheap ones from the drugstore.  They stay clean and are easy for the kids to clip off and on.</li>
    <li> as a germaphobe I highly appreciate these</li>
    <li> I love, love, love these things!!! Keep them stocked up at my house because it covers up the toothbrush nicely. :) :)</li>
    <li> A great deal!  Now I don&#x27;t have to purchase them separately from the store.</li>
    <li> These are great. the work perfectly!</li>
    <li> These are great!  Wish I would have thought of them!  They keep your toothbrush clean, disinfected.</li>
    <li> While they do have a smell, which I would liken to a strong listerine type smell, these are a great product.  My husband and I travel frequently, whether for work or pleasure, and these are great in keeping the toothbrush clean and ready.  Have purchased them before and will purchase again!</li>
    <li> These are so cool to use. I use them on my kids toothbrush as well. They are a bit to big but I am fine with that.</li>
    <li> Love these little things.  I use them at home and travel.  It keeps the head of my toothbrush safe from one of my cats who seems to like the taste of toothpaste - I love my cat, but I am not sharing my toothbrush with her.  When I change my toothbrush, I change the pod.  Although a little pricey - it does the job, and the price here is less than I have found at most stores (unless I have a really good coupon!)  This is a really neat little invention.</li>
    <li> This is definitely a &amp;#34;cover&amp;#34; for your toothbrush.  Does it work and actually have bacteria fighting properties inside?  Who knows!  I still cannot detect where it would be.  This is one product you have to hope that the money that you are spending is actually doing what it is supposed to do.  It keeps those bathroom germs from floating down and landing on your toothbrush but so would anything else that you could cover your toothbrush with.  Skeptical; YES!</li>
    <li> I originally bought these at Bed Bath and Beyond but found they were cheaper on amazon.  They are great toothbrush covers and I love that it sanitizes your toothbrush.  You can use it for about 3 months so every 3 months I throw out the pod and toothbrush and use a new one.  I would recommend these!</li>
    <li> We travel whenever we can and I like to use my battery operated toothbrush.  Many of the plastic covers do not fit this type of brush and the Steripod works beautifully without falling off.  We also use one at home to keep the dust from our sonic toothbrushes.  This product works well here also.</li>
    <li> nice item, whether for travel or daily home use.  the pods do not last long and one must be sure to have plenty in stock.</li>
    <li> This is such a great product. Exactly as describe and pictured. Great to sanitize you tooth brushes. I wish they were carried in my local stores to avoid the shipping charges though.</li>
    <li> I honestly can&#x27;t speak to the antibacterial claims of the product, I can however state that provides an excellent cover for my toothbrushes, both electric and travel.  The cap keeps the toothbrush covered while allowing it to dry out completely, something most enclosed case do not do.  If the antibacterial claims are true then it&#x27;s an added bonus.</li>
    <li> Protects my toothbrush, great for travel, cute colors, and smells fresh :)</li>
    <li> I love the Toothbrush Protectors.  They are great and a good value for ordering them in bulk.</li>
    <li> Though bit always over priced a must have.</li>
    <li> I purchase this item once a year.  I believe these to be a contributing factor in healthy mouth care.  Minimizing throat infections and bacteria</li>
    <li> I gave these to someone that works on the road. It is a great way to keep one&#x27;s toothbrush clean and sanitized while traveling around. And they do not take up any extra space.</li>
    <li> I love Steripods and mine got worn out or given away and then I couldn&#x27;t find them anymore.  I was thrilled to find them on Amazon -- they&#x27;re especially great when travelling, although I also like to use them at home.</li>
    <li> We love these in our house of 5. Great product!</li>
    <li> Cleaver covers -- a bit bulky, but easier to transport than the &amp;#34;conventional&amp;#34; tooth brush holders!</li>
    <li> I use my Sonicare and Waterpik, and have them on the bathroom counter. It is fantastic to know that my items are sanitized each time I go to use them, especially since my bathroom is also used by guests. They cover the whole top and then some! And it&#x27;s easy to keep track to change them every three months! Wonderful to get a whole supply to make that so easy! Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> This is the best way to keep your toothbrush clean. Have a horror of a bug taking a stroll across the bristles and this makes me feel semi-safe.</li>
    <li> They&#x27;re bigger than other brands and have fun colors any size would fit in these cute cases and and love the smell!!</li>
    <li> Scented but, sensory friendly. This is the only toothbrush cover brand I can stand.  That Sanitizes and only protects. I use an electric toothbrush and follow the steripod directions of rinsing the brush well before use after taking the steripod off.  Because it&#x27;s electric and I follow instructions especially adding a little shake before putting the brush back in it.  My toothbrush is pretty dry when in it. This I&#x27;m sure helps prevent any bad taste or sensory issues. My toothbrush lays down. I&#x27;m hypersensitive to smells. I use toothpaste and cosmetic products that mostly avoid 98% of the ingrediants in most products due to SPD (Sensory Processing issues to it&#x27;s smell) and any  other possible concerns. If you don&#x27;t smell the steripod you won&#x27;t notice the smell. No matter how bad it actually is. And then won&#x27;t transfer to your brush. It recommends a new one every 3-4 months. The color change doesn&#x27;t change the scent either. It&#x27;s chemical inside however and the dyes on the outside of it may bother some with MCS. You can learn all about these issues on my sensorysolutions1.com blog.</li>
    <li> Just what I was looking for. I have bought these for years at Bed bath &amp; beyond. Just recently they stopped carrying them. Very pleased to find them on Amazon. I like the way they clip to my spin brush. It smells like Listerine is used as the sanitizer.</li>
    <li> Used them for a road trip with the family and loved that the kids could just toss them in their suitcases, no longer worrying about wet bristles or sanitary issues. They&#x27;re inexpensive enough that it&#x27;s okay they only last a number of months. We&#x27;ll be taking several trips this summer and I&#x27;m expecting to use them that long.</li>
    <li> Great for protecting your toothbrush from over spray and dust in the bathroom as well as keeping it clean and dry after each use. Easy to travel with too.</li>
    <li> These steripods are incredible - they keep bacteria from gathering on your toothbrush, and thus getting in your mouth...ick! They also prevent mold from growing on your toothbrush, and thus getting in your mouth...eww! They come in amazing colors, and travel very well! Worth spending the $$ because they prevent toothbrushes from becoming breeding grounds for infection-causing bacteria.</li>
    <li> As a cancer survivor and chemotherapy patient I wouldn&#x27;t be without these! Good value in the quantity pack and fun colors to brighten your life.</li>
    <li> Definitely do their job to cover up your electric tooth brush.  I was expecting it to fit better around the tooth brush.  Does it job but just doesn&#x27;t look good doing it.</li>
    <li> I buy these in 8 packs, because it&#x27;s cheaper than buy 2 packs, but I&#x27;m the only who uses them so they last forever. I used to have a unit that lit up and supposedly killed the germs, but then it got all icky inside and I ditched it. These things are great, they last exactly three months and my brush always is fresh and never smelly. You do have to rinse the brush before brushing your teeth, or you will taste the smell from the Steripod, sounds weird, but you will. I can&#x27;t actually prove it&#x27;s killing the germs, but my toothbrush is never gross or slimy so I&#x27;m happy! They fit my Oral B electric toothbrush perfectly.</li>
    <li> Absolutely the best toothbrush cover. I used to get bacteria build up and a bad taste/smell on toothbrushes all the time from covers, but I never wanted my toothbrush out in the open because of all the nasty things in a bathroom. I&#x27;m not a scientist or any sort of specialist. All I know is after searching for what felt like ages, I finally found covers that keep my toothbrush clean (as far as I know). There&#x27;s absolutely no weird taste or scent. I&#x27;m so happy and relieved to have found these. I&#x27;ll buy them forever.</li>
    <li> Luv this product, I feel so much better knowing that the tooth brushes are covered from bathroom germs and not exposed.</li>
    <li> Seems like a good idea; however I have no idea if it is working as designed.  It is still a good designed holder.</li>
    <li> Have used these for 2 years now and love knowing my toothbrush is germ free.  Shared with my son&#x27;s family too.  They love them too.</li>
    <li> Works great to kill germs especially during flu season</li>
    <li> This product is very easy to use, it has great colors. Additionally, it fits on anything. I really love it.</li>
    <li> I love these things! They are perfect for people who are concerned about germs and bacteria. They do have an odd smell when you first open them but it goes away. Good product!</li>
    <li> It seems ok ..can&#x27;t see it it works.</li>
    <li> The smell is too strong. and no proof it actually works. Ended up returning it. Will go with UV lighting instead.</li>
    <li> Perfect to any toothbrush</li>
    <li> Saved $5 on prime day, no complaints! :D&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love these little things. It sanitizes your toothbrushes and keeps it away from bacteria. I love clipping these on and using them for travel. I don&#x27;t need to carry bulky toothbrush cases for travelling.</li>
    <li> They work awesome! They have a bit of a medicine smell, (think listerine) but that smell is not unpleasant. If you want your t-brush to be clean for the whole time before you swap it out then this is the deal. We love them and buy them in bulk. These are germ fighters.</li>
    <li> Excellent product and easy to use. It snaps on and easy to remove without any hassle. I love this product</li>
    <li> These are genious! After cleaning the slime from the bottom of a toothbrush holder i knew there had to be something more sanitary, These are awesome!</li>
    <li> I love these.  #1, they really do have a sanitizer in them; you can smell it if you put it up to your nose.  That&#x27;s nice to have in a bathroom!!!  #2, I like being able to keep the actual brush covered up; especially because it&#x27;s in a bathroom.  #3, it keeps the cats from chewing on the brush!!  I caught them doing that before I got these covers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend them!  Small price to pay to keep your toothbrush sanitary.</li>
    <li> Wish I&#x27;d thought of this.  I also wish I could have chosen the colors I got, but hey - this fits over my oral b electric toothbrush just fine - and it&#x27;s easy to take it to the gym with me if I need to. (the toothbrush!)</li>
    <li> I purchased these for my daughters, son-in-laws, grandchildren, great grandchildren and my grandson&#x27;s girlfriends. It is my&lt;br /&gt;yearly Christmas gift that is unique and will make them remember me when they use it. I love toothbrush sanitizers and&lt;br /&gt;all the recepients love them also.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve heard good things about these, excited to try them!</li>
    <li> I really like these and I think we have had less colds and flu since we started using them.</li>
    <li> These are great! I hate the idea of our tooth brushes sitting out what with kids and animals roaming around the house. These help give my a peace of mind that my tooth brush is clean!</li>
    <li> Have not been sick since I started using these.</li>
    <li> They are awesome especially since my kids moved home with grandkids it keeps brushes clean</li>
    <li> Love that this was Prime Eligible so I was able to stock up and not make a run to Bed, Bath and Beyond to do so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shipped and arrived quickly as expected. I don&#x27;t care about color so that wasn&#x27;t a problem, but it would be nice if one wanted to request the color combo one could. Thanks!</li>
    <li> These have a practical side. They protect your toothbrush for contamination on a motel vanity just by preventing the touching of the environment.  The shell emits an odor which I presume kills some bacteria.  I first found them at an outdoor store, and was happy to find them available on Amazon.</li>
    <li> Easy to clip on and great for your toothbrush.</li>
    <li> Terrible product&lt;br /&gt;I gave this a one month trial. My sense of taste has been altered after using toothbrush and my mouth and tongue burn . I followed the directions and have since removed the little pod/pill from the cover. My toothbrush had a distinct, unpleasant odor which was the same as this pod. Teeth did not have a fresh clean just brushed feeling but a gross taste and I would say dont purchase this cover! I would give it less than one star if possible. The design of the cover is great. It works like a claw hair clip but don&#x27;t use the enclosed pods. The smell and taste will gag you.</li>
    <li> Keeps brush heads clean and protected from environment. Great for travel or tossed in a drawer at home. Pods are rather large but I guess that is to accommodate different size brush heads.  Have purchased several packages in the past. Will be looking for a product that fits more snug in the future.</li>
    <li> love these things. keeps my brush bathroom safe/clean</li>
    <li> Great product. We have six tooth brushes in our family and they help to color coordinate brushes and also keep everyone&#x27;s germs to themselves, no bristles touching other bristles. I would definitely purchase again.</li>
    <li> Love them .great price and hard to find locally and cost more locally . No one in our family has gotten any illnesses or their usual sore throat etc. Some of my children live among others as in  college or house mates or traveling and these have help protect in those diverse situations as well.</li>
    <li> Great product and VERY FAST DELIVERY</li>
    <li> Perfect. Just what we needed and at a decent price.</li>
    <li> I use a Steripod on my toothbrush everyday since I don&#x27;t put it in a cabinet.  I also use one for my travel toothbrush.  Love them and highly recommend them!</li>
    <li> I love these protector since my toothbrush sits on the counter.</li>
    <li> Found these originally at Bed, Bath and Beyond. Now I can keep our toothbrushes covered and clean. Makes me feel so much better. Healthier, cleaner and fresher toothbrushes.</li>
    <li> Loved  them gave 5 stars</li>
    <li> Hope it works. It&#x27;s a little weird smelling. But I am told that is the vapors that keep it clean!!</li>
    <li> Makes me feel better that I&#x27;m protecting our toothbrushes, especially when we are traveling and using unknown sinks. Very simple and easy to use...they also seem well constructed. We used them camping last weekeend and all held up well.</li>
    <li> I use to buy those steripods in a Bed ,Bath  store .Like them  for 3 month of everyday use and great storage life .Light,colorful,easy,individual fit on any toothbrush .Grandkids (6- 7 yr old) use them too .Recommend it to buy.I use this product for years and glad to find them on amazon with delivery to the door -little cheaper then store. I can&#x27;t ask for more.</li>
    <li> Easy to use and a great alternative to having to having a germy toothbrush. No more worries about having to throw out my rand new toothbrush because I had a cold 2 days after opening it.</li>
    <li> I love these! They just clip right in to your toothbrush and they smell really good. Very easy to use</li>
    <li> This is such a neat product!  I love it</li>
    <li> Second time buying these the first ones work great the only thing I don&#x27;t like is that they only last 3 months each when in use so it starts to get expensive when your not the only one using them,</li>
    <li> Great product and fast delivery</li>
    <li> Use these all the time. Protects toothbrush head and great for travel.</li>
    <li> Gives a strange smell to the brush. Some might say it smells medical/sterile but it also has a &#x27;moth ball&#x27; quality to it I think. No way to tell if it actually sterilizes. But I like that it covers the brush at least. In the package of 2, each one is actually individually wrapped in foil, which makes for a good stocking stuffer!</li>
    <li> Works as expected - used them all over the world</li>
    <li> Great product.  Wouldn&#x27;t EVER be without them.  Believe the protect the toothbrush from contaminants in the bathroom, and that gives me extraordinary peace of mind.</li>
    <li> We love these for protecting our toothbrushes in the bathroom.  They fit easily over our Oral-B toothbrushes.  I had to order a new set for my in-laws after they saw ours while they were dog sitting last month.  Aside from any sanitizing, we feel better just knowing that the toothbrush heads are covered and protected.</li>
    <li> I like &#x27;em, but it&#x27;s pretty hard to say they work. Guess I&#x27;ll assume they do.</li>
    <li> My daughter and I love this product!!  They are a must</li>
    <li> The Steripod Clip On Toothbrush Sanitizer Works Very Well, Easy To Use, Easy To Clip On My Toothbrush, I Would Buy Again</li>
    <li> Just love this product. Would recommend this product for everyone. My toothbrush is always fresh, clean and free from germs.</li>
    <li> works great for keeping tooth brush clean.</li>
    <li> Love the SteriPods for keeping my toothbrush clean</li>
    <li> What can I say?  Heard about this on one of those doctor shows and decided to try it.  Wouldn&#x27;t be without it.  Knowing the types of bacteria found in the bathroom let alone in and around the sink, I will take this protection for my toothbrush - gladly.  I am thoroughly impressed and have my entire family using these steripods.  Great product.</li>
    <li> Our family love idea of toothbrushes not exposed to dirty air.  We feel toothbrushes are more santized.</li>
    <li> We have used these type of toothbrush protectors in the past and have always been pleased.  The product received was as advertised and the price was excellent.  We would buy from this vendor again.</li>
    <li> I love these for home and travel.</li>
    <li> I am happy with my purchase. I bought these for my grandchildren who go to camp in the summer and church sponsored youth meetings during the year. They have enjoyed using these and explaining their use to friends.</li>
    <li> Quick speedy and these things definitely keep your toothbrush clean. I would recommend them to anyone. Also the shipper is very speedy.</li>
    <li> Love these. I&#x27;m not sure how great of a job they actually do at killing bacteria but it leaves it so my toothbrush is not exposed to all the bacteria in the bathroom. I think it does a good job though, because overtime I can see it turning a yellowish tint. This is how I know its time to change the pod and my toothbrush.</li>
    <li> Great deal! I use these all the time on daily basis to protect my tooth brush from the airborne germs in the bathroom. Also is great because I travel alot and I&#x27;ve found other toothbrush holders to dirty too quickly, these steripods travel well and I rotate them out every 60 days or so days. I have found no problem with the order of these, as mentioned in other reviews.</li>
    <li> We have been using the Steripods for just under a month at this point.  So far, we&#x27;re pleased with the product.  There is a taste to the brush when you use it, but it reminds us of Listerine so is not unpleasant.  It is easy to use and completely covers the head of the brush.  I would buy these again.</li>
    <li> Well I found these somewhere at a store local and of course couldnt remember where that was. Ordered them off amazon, think they were a little pricer then I paid local, but they work get especially for travel</li>
    <li> Granted we are a bit germaphobic in our house but we absolutely love these. If everyone sticks to one color then it reduces unintentional sharing (ick) and it also counteracts concerns about airborne germs in the bathroom</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a good splash guard and I really don&#x27;t know how well these work, but I will take their word for it. Major issue is that the clips are very smooth. No grips. With slightly wet fingers, these will slide out of your hand and fly all over the place when you are trying to open the clamp. Other than that, I will assume it does its job.</li>
    <li> Love these toothbrush sanitizers. I&#x27;ve been using them for years but can only find them online.</li>
    <li> These are so awesome!</li>
    <li> Convenient, space-minimizing product. My toothbrush seemed cleaner over the course of a three-week backpacking trip. It&#x27;s a bit wobbly because it has to accommodate a lot of different toothbrushes, but it never came off and it never broke.</li>
    <li> These are the best toothbrush covers! The fact that they also keep the toothbrush in a sterile condition is a bonus.</li>
    <li> Love these!! I&#x27;m in college so these come very useful to use for my toothbrush in my shower caddy</li>
    <li> I thought this was a great idea as I wanted to lay my toothbrush flat on the bathroom shelf. Well I can do that, but I could have done that with a toothbrush cover from the dollar store. Several reviewers mentioned the smell – which is bad – but the taste is even worse. It made me gag when the protector was new. What I didn’t think about (and I should have) is that the toothbrush doesn’t have a chance to dry out – it is always wet.&lt;br /&gt;I bought the product more for the protection it advertises rather then the sterilization (no one else uses my toothbrush and I don’t care about my own germs), and it does protect. I gave the remaining packages away as stocking stuffers, and I will continue to use the package I have. It does seem to last a long time (the smell is still there after three months) and I will continue to use it until it breaks as I just want to protect the toothbrush from everything else that goes on in the bathroom!</li>
    <li> These things are fantastic! I love how they clip on, and the clip part itself let&#x27;s you stand them up at an angle. There is a little disc inside that helps sanitize and kill germs. I feel so much better about the cleanliness of our brushes now. This is a great deal, too. I bought my first set in a store and this is a much more economical you to buy them.</li>
    <li> Do I know if these are actively killing bacteria?  Nope. But they do a fine job keeping anything that might land on a toothbrush that spends most of its time on my bathroom counter off of it.  And they smell like Listerine.  Win Win.</li>
    <li> LOVE these and was delighted I could get them through Amazon!!!</li>
    <li> These toothbrush covers keep your toothbrushes clean and sanitized.  They last 3 months before changing to a  new one is suggested.</li>
    <li> I have been using these over a year and will continue it is nice to have something like the uv light but without using electricity</li>
    <li> Love these and will continue to buy them!!!</li>
    <li> Really like this idea even though the first holder broke after I dropped it on the counter top trying to open it.&lt;br /&gt;Wish the product was a bit more durable but I still think the concept is great!</li>
    <li> Order every year for stocking stuffers great  product</li>
    <li> Handy toothbrush cover. I switch it out when I switch my toothbrush. I drive a truck and travel a lot.&lt;br /&gt;I feel it keeps my toothbrush cleaner.</li>
    <li> We have used this product for a year.  We replace them regularly.  I can say definativly that they have &amp;#34;improved&amp;#34; our ability to not transmit germs, but we are getting lots of colds.  So we will keep using them.  They are a much simpler way of attacking the germ buildup on your toothbrush.</li>
    <li> Great product.  Fits our electric toothbrush very well and also fits a regular toothbrush.</li>
    <li> Received what I ordered and they were perfect.  Used them to give to my friends and introduce them to the product.  I think they are a great idea.</li>
    <li> I love these for my electric toothbrush to keep them clean when it sits out in the open.  Would definitely recommend these.</li>
    <li> JUST AS EXPECTED! Love these things! They work great! Company shipped quickly. Transaction went smooth.</li>
    <li> Really good and smart stuff! I love how it keeps my toothbrush all fresh and clean.</li>
    <li> Love this little pods, exactly what I want. Functional, inexpensive, and easy for use. Will buy again.</li>
    <li> Fantastic product! Fast shipping</li>
    <li> Great arrived on time. I love this product cannot find it in stores. Don&#x27;t look all over the place like I did just order it b</li>
    <li> There is nothing I don&#x27;t like about these.  Different colours so everyone knows whose is whose.  They act as a cover and a stand!  Perfect for home and travel.</li>
    <li> I really like the convenience of this toothbrush cover, so easy to clip on.  I also like that it naturally kills germs and keeps them from growing on the toothbrush.</li>
    <li> Our whole family uses these and loves them. Not only are they handy, especially if tooth brushes are stored near the toilet but I love the pretty colors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hated the smell at first but you really do get used to them. The directions say to rinse your tooth brush before storing it and before using it each time. The fit is perfect no matter what tooth brushes I happen to buy too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Was getting these at Target but they stopped selling them there. This is a great price on Amazon!</li>
    <li> use them all the time. They work wonders.</li>
    <li> Never leave home without it.  Use it in the home too.  Keeps your toothbrush fresh and sanitary.  Every person in our family likes them even our teen kids.</li>
    <li> My husband and have used these several times.  They are great for keeping your toothbrush clean at home and during travel. We replaced them at least every three months.  Will continue to buy.</li>
    <li> these things are AWESOME!</li>
    <li> More hygienic than leaving your toothbrush in a cup, or toothbrush holder. Protects them from &amp;quot;flushing spray!&amp;quot; (Read the studies...Ugh!) Gave them out to everyone in my family. Great for travel.</li>
    <li> Just what you need to keep your toothbrush clean and covered.</li>
    <li> They work great. Easy to use</li>
    <li> I used to buy these at my local drug store until they stopped carrying then. I turned to amazon and much to my relief they carried them. The 4 pack is a bargain considering you get 8 and will last you up to 2 years worth of steripods.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These not only protect your brush while traveling, it protects your brush while at home... Most people don&#x27;t realize it but every time you flush your toilet, bacteria becomes airborne by up to 6 feet... Gross!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Keeping these nifty things on your brush not only shields said bacteria, the integrated tablet in the pod sterilizes your brush in between uses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t make a dime from shouting from the rooftops about how much I love these things.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought them as stocking stuffers for all my friends and family... They are magical little things!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buying the 4 pack is much cheaper than I paid at my local drug store even.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You may notice a slight odor and taste on your tooth brush but I like that because it tells me it&#x27;s working. It reminds me of medicated mouthwash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only regret is not inventing these things myself as I would have made a fortune if I did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Btw... I have an electric tooth brush and it fits perfectly...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a must buy item!!!!</li>
    <li> We have used these protectors for several years and love them.</li>
    <li> Love the toothbrush protectors. I use them as gifts as well as for home &amp; travel. I feel they keep the germs, dirt &amp; grime off my toothbrush.</li>
    <li> We have used these to keep our toothbrushes sterile for 2 or 3 years now and love how they work.</li>
    <li> I like the idea of having a cover for my toothbrush but this one has a funny smell to it. I am assuming that this is due to the sterilize feature of the product. We stopped using them because it recommended rinsing your toothbrush off before brushing your teeth and with having young kids I couldn&#x27;t count on them to rinse every time.</li>
    <li> Stays on brush much better than the cover that came with my electric brush.</li>
    <li> I like the idea of keeping the toothbrushes sanitary while being stored until their next use and with a larger family this was a cost effective way to do that. I&#x27;m not sure how well they really work but it has to be better then just using the plastic covers. They travel easily and fit the battery operated spin types just as well as the regular ones. I did think they have kind of a Listerine/medicine taste they impart on the brush as another reviewer mentioned but I&#x27;m the only one out of 4 that noticed it at all.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know if these really are &amp;#34;anti-germ&amp;#34; but they are handy to keep your toothbrush clean and separate from others.</li>
    <li> Simple, they work and even when the sterilizer wears out they keep your brush clean not much more you could ask.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for something like this for awhile now and for a good price. I love that these are easy to use and keeps my electric toothbrush clean and dry.</li>
    <li> I love these things.  Nice to know our toothbrushes are getting cleaner than they would be just hanging out in the bathroom drawer.  They fit my Oral B, our Sonicare brushes and regular brushes.  I can set the brush down, clip side on the counter, and it rests on the clip and my brush doesn&#x27;t touch anything.  It does have a bit of a medicine smell but I don&#x27;t notice it when I brush.  Nice for travel too.</li>
    <li> We use these in our RV to keep everyone&#x27;s brushes clean. Can not recommend them highly enough.</li>
    <li> To be honest, I have no evidence of my own to prove if these really work; however with so many disgusting, filthy people in this world certainly creates a peace of mind. Living in the NorthEastern region, a lot of people are going to get sick due to the changing seasons (and I&#x27;ll probably get sick because they got sick). I was told by a friend that the minute you get sick you should change your toothbrush, because once you&#x27;re better you&#x27;ll still have the bacteria on your toothbrush. Now, I don&#x27;t know if this is true but it definitely doesn&#x27;t sound incredulous to me. And so with these babies I can save a couple dollars and avoid buying a new toothbrush until I have to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A lot of people are commenting/complaining about the scent of these. I like &#x27;em. It smells like Listerine to me.</li>
    <li> So far, so good. The only thing I don&#x27;t like is the smell that it has. But that&#x27;s minor. It seems to be working. We&#x27;ve been using it for about a month now.</li>
    <li> I love these things. Don&#x27;t know how well they work, but they are convenient to use and keep your toothbrush from mixing with proximal germs.</li>
    <li> Use these daily...I hope they really work!  Makes me feel better anyway!</li>
    <li> I like these. They make me feel something is happening, even if it isn&#x27;t, and at least it keeps my toothbrushes clean. What more can one want in life? And perhaps they really work, which I am willing to believe, even though microbes are so very small one cannot make them out at all.</li>
    <li> We love these things.  They sell them in specialty stores, but they are cheaper through Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;Soooo easy to put on and take off.</li>
    <li> This is the second time I have ordered and one of the Steripod came apart.  I would like to mail it back if I could for replacement.</li>
    <li> I like the fact that the disk inside of each tooth brush holder is supposed to santize the brush while it is stored in it.  It is great when traveleing, especially when cruising.  The bathrooms are so small, and to have one&#x27;s toothbrush protected is always wonderful!!</li>
    <li> Love these and a great price</li>
    <li> I purchased the Steripod Clip-on Toothbrush Sanitizer at the store and never could find them again.  I love them that they do work and I would recommend them to any one.</li>
    <li> I have one bathroom for 4 people. Theses Steripods put my mind at ease since all toothbrushes are stored in close quarters.</li>
    <li> I love Steripods.  I attach them every 3 months at the same time I buy myself a new toothbrush.  I color co-ordinate them with the toothbrush.</li>
    <li> Do these really work...supposedly they do.  My wife saw  a special about these on TV and we originally gave them a try from our local drug store.  After using them for 3 months, and not being able to find them in stores anymore, we turned to Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are some studies that show the way that they work, and we&#x27;re confident that using them at least helps a little bit, so we continue to use them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Regarding the packaging.  It notes that these pods only remain effective for about 3 months until you need to replace them.  I was concerned that I would be losing out on my money since there are only 3 of us in my family, and they come in packs of 2.  DON&#x27;T WORRY...even though these are packaged in groups of 2, each pod is sealed  in it&#x27;s own plastic and foil pouch...so you only &#x27;pop out&#x27; the pods that you need, keeping the rest of them air tight and ready until you need them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A great little investment that we will continue to use!</li>
    <li> It is very easy to get on and off the toothbrush. You know nothing has gotten on your tooth brush.</li>
    <li> I really like these. Bought a couple of them at a local store, just to try. They are now 3 months old so time to replenish. They are must less expensive than the local stores and also online of you by multiples.</li>
    <li> These are easy to put on any type of toothbrush, including electric and seem to keep the brush clean.  I haven&#x27;t tested it with a germ detector but  judging from the condition of the brush, they seem to be working  even after two months of use.</li>
    <li> These are great for travel and home and last for a few months .</li>
    <li> Great way to sanitize your toothbrushes</li>
    <li> I love them they have a fresh clean smell , and I know my toothbrush is being protected !</li>
    <li> love them and will buy again.</li>
    <li> What more is t here to say, i don&#x27;t know if they work or not, but i like the idea of keeping my toothbrushes sanitary.</li>
    <li> EXCELLENT PRODUCT I WILL ALWAYS USE &amp; keep spares for guests.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are &amp;#34;Fantastic&amp;#34; for keeping toothbrushes dry and CLEAN between uses.  They also have a mouthwash scent to.replace that bland smell of your toothbrush after storage.  This scent makes the start of brushing Very pleasant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bathrooms have many more germs than your kitchen sink, so I want to feel fresh even before starting to brush.&lt;br /&gt;I bought them for everyone in my family and extended family and everyone &amp;#34;LOVED&amp;#34; them and will purchase their own in the future as well as they are all spreading the word to their friends!</li>
    <li> haven&#x27;t used it yet.  The idea gets the four stars.</li>
    <li> These are great! We have these on all our our toothbrushes.</li>
    <li> I truly like these toothbrush covers. I feel better knowing that my toothbrush is covered and will be protected from contamination.</li>
    <li> I give this product five stars</li>
    <li> Easy-to-use for children and adults alike.  Keeps the toothbrush protected with easy access.</li>
    <li> Great product fully protects toothbrush head and sterilized the same time !</li>
    <li> I love the idea of a toothbrush cover that keeps your toothbrush sterile.  The problem with the steripod is that it makes your toothbrush smell like a bandaid container.  Whatever the chemical is smells and has a slight taste.  Once you use start brushing with your toothpaste, it&#x27;s not so bad.  Overall, it is handy and the colors are cool and make it easy to keep know whose brush is whose.</li>
    <li> The individual pods are easy to clip and unclip on a tooth brush. HOWEVER inside the cover is a little chamber with holes in it. The chamber holds some kind of sanitizing chemical in tablet form. When you place your damp toothbrush back into the pod, some of the moisture from the toothbrush wets the sanitizer and which then sanitizing your tablet. Here is the thing, the package says rinse tooth brush throughly before brushing your teeth. No amount of rinsing could get rid of the taste. We had to toss our tooth brushes. Turns out there was nothing on the package stating that it was safe and non toxic. Get a regular tooth brush cover and pour a drop from a travel size bottle of Listerine on your tooth brush instead. Save your money.</li>
    <li> does keep the tooth brush fresh</li>
    <li> I love these &amp; trust that they are killing germs!</li>
    <li> Finally found a bulk discount. We&#x27;ve been using these for a long time and love them. Work as well on automatic toothbrushes as manual. Work on kids and adult brushes just fine. I never noticed any smell like some others. I have some cleaner with Thymol in it and I think it smells fine anyway.</li>
    <li> AMAZING!!!!!! Each steripod fits protectively over any toothbrush (I use mine on my electric brush).  I have given to family and friends as a little fun gift and each loves them.  Hard to find in stores. Thank you Amazon for carrying them.</li>
    <li> Was delivered real fast. Ordered this for my cousin. So I don&#x27;t know how good the product is, but am sure it should be fine :-)</li>
    <li> Sanitary product to use</li>
    <li> LOVE!  Great toothbrush cover for RV or home.  Easy to use even for someone with grip issues due to arthritis.  Colors are fun.</li>
    <li> I am happy with this item.  I have even given them to my parents!  I plan on reordering again  &amp; again!</li>
    <li> I buy them over and over.</li>
    <li> love these! Great for travel and as travel gifts (stocking stuffers). Protects my brush from the germs thrown into the air by each toilet flush. Recommend for the family.</li>
    <li> love these things!  not sure if they keep your toothbrush sterile, but they definitely keep it off the countertops.  great for traveling!</li>
    <li> I started using these last year and have been very happy with them.  I feel that they keep my toothbrush head clean and fresh!!</li>
    <li> Bests toothbrush cover ever! I haven&#x27;t had a toothbrush yet that it doesn&#x27;t fit. Electric and manual toothbrushs too. I feel like I don&#x27;t have to worry about it being clean. I just wish they were a little cheaper but they are so worth it. I haven&#x27;t found anything better.</li>
    <li> Use these each time I travel to prevent toothbrush from getting gross.</li>
    <li> Love these however I use them every four months not three</li>
    <li> Very convenient.  Keeps toothbrush clean.</li>
    <li> Keeps the germs away!</li>
    <li> These I love, so much better than the old ones you put on and the bristles all bunched up.  These are amazing and love the colors.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t really know how much it is eliminating germs on my toothbrush, but I like the protection it provides my brush and fits well, just a bit wobbly to allow for various size brushes. Does not give any weird smell to brush that I notice, but I rinse my brush before I reapply paste to brush my teeth anyways.</li>
    <li> I love this product so much that this is the second time I bought it. I gave some of them as gifts as well. I switch mine out every three months so buy these quite often.</li>
    <li> I LOVE these and they&#x27;re great for travel too.</li>
    <li> They are fun and easy to put on your toothbrush</li>
    <li> Love these.  You can smell that they are sterilizing, and not just plain usual covers.  Ordered more for my son to take for college.</li>
    <li> We are so glad to have found these. They are just what we needed. They have fit every tooth brush we&#x27;ve tried them on but I use mine on my sonicare. I was buying them at Bed Bath &amp; Beyond, and paying about twice as much.  They last a long time, I&#x27;ve never had one break.</li>
    <li> Happy! Has helped to keep me healthy all winter!</li>
