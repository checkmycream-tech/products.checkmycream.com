      <li>really like this scrub, and Olay is a great, trustworthy brand.  </li>

      <li>After washing with this product, my skin feels nice a cool,</li>
      <li>This also allows makeup and moisturizer to be more easily</li>
      <li>However, the Olay Fresh Effects scrub seems to be more effective in reducing breakout as well.</li>

      <li>I was delighted to have a chance to try the Olay Fresh Effects Clear Skin scrub for my face.  </li>
      <li>This has such a nice, refreshing, citrus smell, it&#x27;s like having an aromatherapy treatment while treating your skin.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Pleasantly fragranced, this scrub provides some mild but effective exfoliation along with anti-acne properties. There is some grit but it is not excessively rough or irritating. It contains salicylic acid 2%, a proven acne fighter. It leaves skin feeling fresh, soft and clean without redness or irritation. I found the scent refreshing. It is fruity with a touch of mint. It demonstrates that you don&#x27;t have to be rough to be tough on acne.</li>
    <li> This facial scrub feels like a really great scrub, it&#x27;s little bits and pieces do the job well.  While it&#x27;s really great at scrubbing it is also gentle enough on my acne prone and sensitive skin that I can use it every day.The salicylic acid isn&#x27;t over drying to my skin, so I assume it&#x27;s the amount of it in this product that wins me over.  It also helps keep my pores clean and small, added bonus!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have occasional breakouts on my chest and am using this there as well, still gentle enough for the skin there.  My husband has taken to using it before shaving as it helps keep ingrown hairs at bay as well.</li>
    <li> This is a great skin scrub.  Both my daughter and I use it.  Her skin has cleared up significantly and she is very happy!  I love how clean my face feels after using it, but it doesn&#x27;t feel tight and dry like other scrubs.  Love it.</li>
    <li> I USE THIS EVERYDAY IN THE SHOWER. I LOVE HOW IT FEELS WHEN I&#x27;M WASHING MY FACE AND THEN AFTER. I FEEL IT REALLY CLEANS MY SKIN, ESPECIALLY SINCE I USE SO MUCH PRODUCT.</li>
    <li> This is way better than the generic version I usually buy. The price is three times as much however. The texture is thicker, the scent is pleasing (not strong), and it washes as well as exfoliates. I got a good facial scrub and felt very refreshed after using this. I&#x27;ve since switched to using this bottle exclusively. Should last a long time (a couple months) for my needs because it doesn&#x27;t take much, a pea size. My face feels light and smooth after each use.</li>
    <li> This face wash smells nice and feels nice when you use it.  It gives a cooling sensation to the skin that feels renewing.  After using it, my skin feels soft and clean.  The salicylic acid really helps my adult acne.  It drys the skin a little without over drying.  I just made sure to put on a little facial moisturizer after using this and my skin looks and feels great!</li>
    <li> There isn&#x27;t all too much I can say about this scrub other than that I love it. I have occasional breakouts which have lowered in severity since I started using this and my face just feels a lot cleaner when I do use it. The smell is also great -- it smells citrusy but not so much that it overpowers your nose with the smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scrub itself is really abrasive and it helps to get deep in there for the clean. I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about 3 weeks now in place of my usual acne soap. I haven&#x27;t noticed any difference so I would say that it works as well in preventing breakouts (I always have a few) as the other product which has the same active ingredient. This soap does have a very grainy feel which can be a bit uncomfortable, but it has not dried out my skin at all which is good.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used many face wash products and this is one of the best. It has a pleasant scent and texture and it keeps my skin clear.</li>
    <li> Love this scrub in the morning. The citrus mint essence smells really fresh.  It has granules for exfolation and Salicylic acid&lt;br /&gt; for acne prone skin.  Helps fight oil and get rid of blackheads.</li>
    <li> When I got this I did not realize it was a gritty cleanser. ( I guess that&#x27;s what &amp;#34;scrub &amp;#34; means in this context but it was not explicit in the description). I prefer a cleanser that exfoliates chemically or to use a clarisonic which is gentler. I&#x27;m worried this might be too scratchy for my face , though it is less gritty than many on the market.&lt;br /&gt;It has a nice fresh but not overpowering scent . It rinses easily, and does not make my skin feel tight.  I like that it has salicylic acid. Due to the grit I would probably not use this every day, just a few times a week.</li>
    <li> Oil of Olay is a brand that I feel comfortable buy because it&#x27;s one that my mom used for years and her skin is a testimony to how well it works. I expect nothing less that the same standard in this product!</li>
    <li> Love this cleanser!  Thanks.  Sincerely, Dixie,</li>
    <li> I bout this since the original total effects blemish control i was used to buy had been discontinued... I don&#x27;t like this at all...,  i feel like I break-out worse after using this.</li>
    <li> This is a fairly aggressive exfoliating scrub that may aggravate irritated skin.  It contains a mild anti-acne medication, 2% salicylic acid, and has a pleasant citrusy fragrance.</li>
    <li> Dream come true! I&#x27;ve struggled with hormonal acne for years and everything else I&#x27;ve tried (including dermatologist prescribed formulas) either made my sensitive skin breakout even more or, dried it out to the point of peeling. This product is gentle, effective, leaves your skin feeling fresh, affordable and smells fantastic. PLEASE do not discontinue this item!</li>
    <li> Feels really nice during and after use. The exfoliating beads are plentiful but feel quite gentle. The fragrance is very nice. Love the 2% salicylic acid. If you haven&#x27;t been using a facial cleanser with the salicylic acid you might get a little dryness in the beginning but that goes away in a few days. I have used a facial cleanser with the s. acid for years. This stuff is great as the feel of the exfoliating beads is very nice and gentle while still feeling quite effective. This will be replacing my usual Ives product.</li>
    <li> This scrub not only works for acne, but it works as a microdermabrasion scrub.  There are little sand like particles in there, that get deep down into your skin to scrub away dry skin.  This also allows makeup and moisturizer to be more easily absorbed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent is a really pleasant, clean scent.  After washing with this product, my skin feels nice a cool, which I&#x27;m sure is due to the mint that is in it.  Sometimes, there are particles that don&#x27;t wash cleanly away.  I had to rinse my face several times to wash them away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really like this scrub, and Olay is a great, trustworthy brand.  If you are looking for an effective acne scrub, then give this one a try.</li>
    <li> This is a nice facial scrub. I really like the fragrance. It is a very light citrus and mint fragrance that isn&#x27;t overpowering. I have very sensitive skin that is always dry. Dry skin will cause acne as much as oily skin so I try to use products that aren&#x27;t overly drying. I decided to give the a try because I like Olay products. I&#x27;m glad I did. I cleaned my skin and made it feel nice and fresh without drying it out. This made my skin feel really soft and smooth to the touch and there was no redness after using it. A really nice facial cleanser and acne controller. Recommended.</li>
    <li> I have a bone to pick with this skincare line! I had bought a scrub from this line that I LOVED! Then my boyfriend left it at his brothers out of town and I had to buy a new one. I was POSITIVE this was it but when I poured it in my hand I was like &amp;#34;Where are the scrub beads?&amp;#34; So I exchanged it for a new one, thinking it was a defect, only to find that this is obviously not the product I originally used! But it smells the same and the bottle looks way I remember it looking. Anyways, I&#x27;ll get back to the actual review.&lt;br /&gt;My problem with this product is that I don&#x27;t find it scrubby enough. It claims to be a &amp;#34;deep&amp;#34; scrub but the scrub beads are so so tiny it feels like a normal face wash!  It smells good and I do think it works decently (so far not a miracle worker on my acne ridden skin but nothing ever is).&lt;br /&gt;Based on the other reviews a lot of people like this, but I personally would not purchase again when in search of a scrub, as it does not fulfill my exfoliation needs.</li>
    <li> This scrub is amazing! I have an oily and acne-prone face. Since I started using this product, my face has gotten clearer and lesser acne. I like its gel-like consistency and the fact that it has a good amount of &amp;#34;scrub bits&amp;#34; in it. I could really feel the scrubs working and gently clearing away all the dirt and oil on my face. The scent is also refreshing. I would have to put on a moisturizer afterwards though because my face tends to feel a bit dry after washing with this, probably due to the salicylic acid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I think it is a great product that effectively clears away acne and whatever impurities on the face.</li>
    <li> Wonderful! Not something I use every day - my sensitive skin dries out easily. But it&#x27;s great at keeping me balanced on oily days.</li>
    <li> WOW, this feels great and the feeling of really getting my NYC dirty skin clean, is invigorating.&lt;br /&gt;The mint and the citrus add a wonderful dimension of smell that underscores this deep cleaning&lt;br /&gt;product from the trusted name of OLAY&lt;br /&gt;i like the way it calms down my oily skin and leaves it feeling tighter and fresh.&lt;br /&gt;This is one part of my cleaning and beauty regime that is totally enjoyable and by the looks of my skin, very effective.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this to all.</li>
    <li> So the puberty stick nearly beat me to death at age eleven and I&#x27;ve been fighting a war with acne ever since. I tried Proactiv, actual prescription products, drugstore things I borrowed off my mom,... If there&#x27;s something that&#x27;s supposed to help clear up my acne, I&#x27;ve probably tried it. Now I&#x27;ve tried this and I&#x27;m so happy with how much my face has cleared up in the past month that I could just about cry. All my acne scars and my rather visible pores make it seem like I still have the acne issue, but most all of my blackheads and such have gone away. I look at my face in the mirror and I feel HAPPY. Plus the scent is lovely and it&#x27;s rather fun to put it on my face and be able to feel the scent of mint. Mixing up senses like that is pretty fun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I give it four stars only because I&#x27;ve had a significant rise in acne on my chin since I started using it. It could be chance, but I&#x27;m pretty sure it&#x27;s not.</li>
    <li> Olay Fresh Effects Clear Skin line includes several different products aimed at acne treatment and prevention. This facial scrub contains 2% salicylic acid which is effective in clearing up acne but it can be very drying for those with sensitive or dry skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does contain fragrance and it has a nice, fresh scent which is typical of the Olay Fresh Effects line. The texture is slightly gritty but not abrasive. It cleans well and washes off easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scrub is really nice and works well. I’ve been pretty pleased with most of the things that I’ve tried from the Olay Fresh Effects line and Olay in general.</li>
    <li> It starts off with a fun name, Acne Hater.  This is a deep scrubbing face wash, designed to exfoliating and help clean your skin.  Because of that it&#x27;s not intended to be used daily (you probably could, but maybe not the best for your skin).  It includes 2% Salicylic Acid which is intended to help remove and prevent acne, and is a quite standard treatment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product smells/feels and functions well as a scrub, and the addition of the Salicylic Acid makes sure to help those with Acne issues.</li>
    <li> I rec&#x27;d the 1-2-3 acne solution kit from Vine a couple of weeks ago. My kid used this on her spotty breakout and thought it was pretty effective. Her skin looked great after two days of use, yet she left it at home when she went back to school. I was fairly certain that I wouldn&#x27;t have to use this product because I am long in tooth a rarely have breakouts or even the occasional zit. As luck would have it, I got a sole zit and used the 1-2-3 kit and it was bye, bye zit in 24 hours. All three products worked great in tandem, but the scrub was great in terms of really thorough cleaning. My skin felt great after using this. I applied this using the Phillips Cleansing System that I recently reviewed on Amazon. After I finished cleaning, I applied a light moisturizer. What makes this very effective is it really deep cleans and the  Salicylic Acid which is a potent zit zapper attacks the potential culprit (dirt and bacteria) and keeps breakouts at bay.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not sure if I will toss out my other cleansers, but this is a secret weapon for when things go bad.</li>
    <li> While I don&#x27;t have a major issue with acne, I do have one with blackheads.  Big time.  Oil of Olay is a very well-known product and I decided to give this a try.  I have other skin care products but needed a very good deep scrubber; this one fit the bill.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I followed the directions to use it one a day and eventually will work my way up to twice a day.  (I haven&#x27;t had it long enough and your skin needs to adapt to it.)  First, the scent.  Unlike other scrubs I&#x27;ve smelled, this one smells WONDERFUL!  They describe it as a citrus and mint essence but the mint really comes through.  I believe that&#x27;s what helps your face feel so fresh!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I must admit I&#x27;m usually a skincare &amp;#34;snob&amp;#34; and stick to department store brands; however, Vine has allowed me to branch out and try store brands and be delightfully pleased.  This is one of those items that I&#x27;m glad I was able to try.  I believe you will too!</li>
    <li> This Olay Fresh Effects Clear Skin Acne Hater Deep Scrub is a great daily cleanser. It is clear with little flecks in the scrub. The flecks exfoliate your skin as you rub it in. The scrub also foams slightly as you rub it in. The exfoliation is not harsh or abrasive, so it won&#x27;t damage your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The citrus scent is very faint. I actually wish that the scent was a little stronger. The scrub goes on easy and washes off easy for a quick wash. I found that it made my skin feel very soft and clean. My face also had a slight tingle after using it (not strong or burning...more a relaxing tingle) that I really liked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using it for about a week now and it hasn&#x27;t dried out my face or given me any issues. This is actually very similar to the Garnier Clean+ Blackhead Eliminating Scrub that I was sent to review for another entity. I do prefer this one just because it doesn&#x27;t dry my skin out like the Garnier. However, that is another great option if you have oily skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend this Olay Fresh Effects scrub!</li>
    <li> I was delighted to have a chance to try the Olay Fresh Effects Clear Skin scrub for my face.  I decided to try it during my evening shower.  I squeezed a quarter sized portion of the scrub on to the palm of my hand.  It has a light blue color and a pleasant citrus smell to it.  I then lathered the lotion in my hands and applied it to my wet face, paying particular attention to my nose.  As many other people have noted in the Amazon reviews, it feels like very tiny bits of sand are part of the scrub.  Perhaps these bits make the soap more effective at cleaning the face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I was finished washing my face I made sure to remove all the soap by holding my face for an extra few seconds under the warm water.  After I toweled dry, I noticed that my face felt especially clean and comfortable.  The scrub remained effective overnight.  I was pleased with how good my face felt the next day.  I now use this scrub daily as recommended by the manufacturer and will continue to do so.</li>
    <li> I love the citrus and mint scent of this exfoliating scrub which helps me manage acne outbreaks while deep cleaning power my face. It contains  2% salicylic acid helps eliminate acne and control blackheads while getting rid of excess oil. I use it daily in the shower and I love the flip top cap that dispenses from the bottom for ease of use.</li>
    <li> A really nice, refreshing, gentle scrub that contains salicylic acid which is great for acne.  This has such a nice, refreshing, citrus smell, it&#x27;s like having an aromatherapy treatment while treating your skin.  Scrubs are great exfoliators and this one really works to give your skin a clean, refreshed look while fighting acne.  Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> This is a good face wash. It isn&#x27;t overly drying, and it definitely improves target areas if you&#x27;ve got a breakout. It also leaves your face feeling very clean, soft, and fresh. As far as anti-acne cleansers go, this is a good option.</li>
    <li> Deeply cleans skin and without over drying. It seemed to remove all traces of oil, dirt, and makeup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I typically use [[ASIN:B002PBCAEQ L&#x27;Oreal Paris Go 360 Clean, Deep Exfoliating Scrub, Natural Apricot Beads, 6-Fluid Ounce]] as my daily night time facial wash; it is a Deep Exfoliating Scrub. I love the little exfoliation beads.  This is a less harsh, sandy version of my favorite exfoliating scrub. Overall the facial wash felt nice, and it left my skin feeling clean and smooth. The cleanser does have a light mint scent; - it isn&#x27;t overpowering but I did want to make a note.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The lid does allow water to pool, leaking water into the tube, so I recommend storing out of shower spray range.</li>
    <li> This scrub is fantastic. It has a good amount of grit to exfoliate the skin that makes me feel like I&#x27;m actually scrubbing and cleaning the oil and dead skin off. My face feels less oily and gets breakout less often too. I think the combination of the good scrubbing and the salicylic acid in it that makes a real difference. It also has a great, refreshing smell.  I use Nivea Men Energy Face Scrub and it also has micro beads that does a fine job of scrubbing. However, the Olay Fresh Effects scrub seems to be more effective in reducing breakout as well. Now I use the Olay in my morning ritual, and get less breakout in the process. It&#x27;s slightly more expensive but works better for me. Now my favorite scrub.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t be fooled by the light \\&quot;scrubbing\\&quot; feel of this cleanser. Without irritating your skin it will give you a fresh and renewed appearance. The more you use it, the surer you will be that this is having a definite impact on the appearance of your skin. Don&#x27;t give up on this product because it doesn&#x27;t seem to be filled with pebbles!! It really is quite effective.</li>
    <li> I have had skin problems for the last 10 years and have tried everything.  I recently came across this line with the Spot Zinger and Swirl Mattifier.  I finally am getting clear skin.  It&#x27;s not there yet but it&#x27;s nothing like it was.  I highly recommend these products.  I once bought the other face wash and within 2 days my face was breaking out again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be sure to use the line as directed and be consistent!</li>
    <li> My 16 year old is quite pleased with this product. It is unique inasmuch as there is a cooling down feeling after use. She says the Olay Fresh Effects Clear Skin Acne Hater Deep Scrub, Salicylic Acid smells good and her skins feels really nice!</li>
    <li> Salicylic acid works. It is the only ingredient in any acre scub I have ever used that consistently clears up acne and keeps it away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In addition, this scrub carries a pleasant scent, unlike the slightly foul odor that comes in some other preparations.</li>
    <li> I love this product.&lt;br /&gt;Smells great - light melon/citrus&lt;br /&gt;Nice exfoliation with beads which are not too harsh or or too gentle on my oily skin&lt;br /&gt;Salicylic acid to unplug pores&lt;br /&gt;Leaves  my face feeling fresh, clean but not tight and parched</li>
