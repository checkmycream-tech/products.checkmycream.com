<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I got this product because of the other good reviews. I found it in a store for a cheaper price so I figured give it a shot. I have hormonal and cystic ance and I didn&#x27;t notice anything. Yes, it smells funky, it is greasie to. I tired using it different ways like how others said they use it and the small bumps have cleared up but the cystic is still there. I only get cystic ance a few times a year but it&#x27;s bad when I do and stays for months. So I will keep using it but I just know it won&#x27;t work for what I really want.</li>
    <li> I did not see a difference. And the smell is a bit strong.</li>
    <li> I was able to see a instant difference in my skin. Haven&#x27;t had back break outs on my back since using this product.</li>
    <li> I wanted to try cheap alternative for adult acne, however; I developed eczema not from this product. I can&#x27;t use this on my face anymore, I found out due to my hormone levels is why I got adult acne. It did dry out the pimples. I just can&#x27;t use it anymore due to eczma.</li>
    <li> This is by far my favorite stuff when I get a zit.  It is sticky, yes. It smells bad, agreed, but really...I&#x27;d rather be sticky for half an hour and smell funky for a while than have a huge puss filled zit on my face! I would probably not got crazy with this stuff and leave it on all day or anything, but for a gross zit it is perfecto!</li>
    <li> I use this very sparingly.. and hardly never during the day atleast not while I am out because of the texture of this product... It comes in the tiniest jar and I know why, because this product packs a punch..... I have mild adult acne that which is sometimes sever based on my internal workings/hormones/stress level.. This product is not to be slathered all over your face as it does contain sulfur and WILL dry your skin out very badly and look horrible. Yet when you have severe acne the one thing you want to do is to begin to dry out your skin as you wan to slow down the oil production process which is the root to all acne.. I use this product in conjunction w the Azure Sulfur soap.. I do not use this sulfur cream everyday but I do use AcneFree Terminator10 regularly for whiteheads blackheads and redness,, I also use St Ives Peach Scrub a couple times a week to exfoliate. You have to find the combination of products that works for you. I am no longer a gym rat because my work schedule is hectic... but I try to keep a healthy diet w plenty of water, fiber, green salads light dressing, nuts, small portions of meat... I do not snack on chips, cookies, candy drink soda or juice.. yet I do love coffee and drink it regularly. I take a slew of vitamins and supplements.... I recommend finding supplements specifically for SKIN like MSM, Acidophilus, and drinking plenty of water. Water is the key to FLUSHING out your body, keeping your skin hydrated etc... I wish you all luck... I would actually recommend this product</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always had problems with acne.  Tried every product out but this one gets the job done.  It does have sort of an odor but who cares if it clears up the acne.  I would recommend this product to anyone who has acne problems.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s simply and natural with no side effects.&lt;br /&gt;I use it three times a week for 10 minutes and my skin just stays clear.&lt;br /&gt;It has a lot of sulfur. I can smell it, but I&#x27;m fine with it. It also rises very easily with water.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for over 6 months and it has helped me rosacea tremendously.  I apply it 2 to 3 times per week for about 25 minutes and then wash off.  I have dry skin and it does not make it worse.  I use moisturizer afterwards.  My skin feels smoother after I apply it.  I had little pimples on my cheeks and forehead constantly before using it and now it barely happens.  I also use it as a spot treatment (keeping it on)  when a problem arises, in addition to the 2 to 3 times per week treatment.  Highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> This has been the only acne product that has ever worked for me! I follow the directions (put it on for 10 min, 3 times a day) and it works really well, my pimples usually smooth out after 3 days.</li>
    <li> I use this every night and try to leave on for over 30 minutes.  Only dried out my skin a little during the first week or two.  Been using now for almost 2 months.  HUGE difference.  I use Bye Bye Blemish for occasional pop throughs but other than that this stuff is amazing.  It&#x27;s clear so no one really knows I keep the mask on when I&#x27;m watching tv in the living room and such.  I am 32 and have had problems for years and years. This stuff really helps prevent breakouts.  It&#x27;s crazy!  Also the smell is so mild. A little tiny matchbook-y smell but no one else smells it and it doesn&#x27;t linger at all.  The price can&#x27;t be beat either!  Does not over dry my skin actually leaves my skin feeling soft.  I&#x27;m in love with this stuff and I hope they sell it forever!</li>
    <li> This works great! I just started using it this week and am already seeing a difference in my skin. Word to the wise though, sulfur causes silver to tarnish so remove silver jewelry before using. Rinsing this off my face caused my favorite necklace to turn black.</li>
    <li> Use sparingly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had sulfur washes from a dermatologist back when I would go see one, and it worked great on my acne. So I got this product thinking the same. However, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it as an ointment you keep on overnight. That&#x27;s what I was doing, but:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. The smell isn&#x27;t terrible but it definitely has one.&lt;br /&gt;2. It never absorbs into skin like a lotion, so you&#x27;ll want to avoid touching your face or allowing it to touch your pillow&lt;br /&gt;3. Extended use (overnight) is effective in drying the skin but can lead to redness and an undesirable flaky texture&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m going to look into using this product more as a wash and less as a overnight treatment, because it DOES work.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been dabbing it on potential breakouts and current pimples now for over six weeks and the stuff is a miracle. It feels a bit goopy at first, apply it sparingly - trust me... a little goes a LONG way. I notice a very, very slight  sulfur smell at first, but I&#x27;ve had other friends and family do a sniff check and they can&#x27;t detect it after even a minute. It works great under makeup, or before bed. Plus if you&#x27;re like me and have super-sensitive skin (Benzoyl Peroxide and Salicylic Acid often make me break out even worse), this frugal find could be just the ticket to clear up your skin.    I&#x27;ve bought a few bottles for friends and family - everyone is having great results! Since I am majorly pinching pennies lately, but don&#x27;t want my face and skin reverting into a acne-laden nightmare, I&#x27;ll definitely keep my Sulfur Ointment on my bedside table. My breakouts have decreased significantly, and if I do get a pimple, it heals in a few days rather than over a week or more.    I&#x27;m giving this my full Bionic Buy status!</li>
    <li> I have rosacea, which has given me some annoying adult acne. I tried so many things, and I was skeptical when I saw this recommended by someone online. But it has worked for me so far! Follow the instructions on the label (leave it on for 10 minutes, then wash off - you&#x27;re not supposed to just leave it on), and keep at it for about two weeks. My skin peeled a bunch, but now that it&#x27;s clearer, I&#x27;m only using it every other day, so that&#x27;s not a problem. I haven&#x27;t developed any new painful cysts since I started using it. And it&#x27;s cheap! Who knew? I guess pharmaceuticals haven&#x27;t developed/pushed plain sulfur products because they can&#x27;t make much money from it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hopefully the efficacy won&#x27;t wear off, as a couple other treatments have.</li>
    <li> I have used Acnomel for years and wanted to try something else with sulfur; as I have been using Proactiv/Murad with benzoyl peroxide and salicylic acid. Apparently using too many types of acne treatments makes the problem worse - go figure! I tried this and it&#x27;s a yellow, gooey paste that makes the skin feel greasy. I liked how Acnomel dries up - this never really does. And, since you&#x27;re supposed to wash it off after 10 minutes, you might as well use a face mask. I did not see much of a result with this, in fact I think it made my acne worse...</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve struggled with acne most of my life and tried many expensive acne treatments. I decided to try this after reading an article on MSN health that sulfur helps to rid acne. So I punched in a search for products w/sulfur and this one came up. I was a little skeptical because the price was very affordable but I have to tell you that I am NOT disappointed with this product. I noticed a difference the first night I used it. I have been using it for about a month now and my face is clearer than it has ever been and I think the last time I might have had an Acne free face was before puberty. I&#x27;m 32 now. I will definitely order this product again.</li>
    <li> Helped my son&#x27;s complexion. He applies this right after a shower,  while his pores are open. Even uses it as a shave cream !</li>
    <li> I bought this for seborrheic dermatitis. It showed some improvement but never went away. The smell is awful of course but it&#x27;s a small thing compared to what I have to go through.</li>
    <li> I bought this product and in just days my acne has calmed down alot. Even others are starting to notice! The only thing is that you have to wash it off after 10 minutes of putting it on. I didnt read that part and left it on for hours and even overnight. My face started peeling and itching. When I finally read the directions I couldn&#x27;t believe how I silly I was for leaving it on for so long. I&#x27;m gonna stop using it for a couple days so my skin can rehydrate but I&#x27;m gonna go back on it as soon as possible. I have cystic acne and it reduces the size of the pimple down dramatically. It does not make it go away overnight but a typical pimple stays on my face for about 1-2 weeks. With this cream my pimple heals in days! I&#x27;m satisfied. I just hope that I would have read the directions first!</li>
    <li> This will dry up a pimple overnight - use a little in select areas - causing drying of the skin.</li>
    <li> I have tried everything prescription and over the counter...  This stuff works!  I blend it with moisturizer and put it on my face at night.  Amazing results!  It lasts a long time and is incredibly inexpensive.  Wow!</li>
    <li> I have tried many other products for acne and none of them have worked like this one. Also, I have recommended this product or a homemade concoction with sulfur to others with very promising results. If you suffer from acne, I would strongly recommend you try this product (or any other sulfur product of sufficient concentration) before trying all the harsh chemicals on your skin such as benzoyl peroxide (proactive, etc) which are not only dangerous but are also pretty expensive.  Why only four stars? Because this product does not dry very well and you have to apply it and then remove it after 10 minutes which is pretty inconvenient. Think about it, if you are going to apply it morning and night then you would have to wash your face four times a day since you would also want to clean your face before applying it. Also, it is very drying.  You could say that if it works, then it&#x27;s worth the hassle, which is pretty valid but I will give you a much better way to do it.  First, get hold of a sulfur product (I&#x27;d recommend this one) and determine if it works for you, since no product will work for everyone. Once you have determined that it works, then you are going to have fun mixing your own products (if you want, of course).  This is what I mean:  Get sulfur in powdered form, and then you would need a carrier oil, since sulfur mixes very well with oils. You would want to choose an oil that is nourishing to the skin, a perfect example would be coconut oil. You can also use corn or soy oil. No, just kidding, don&#x27;t ever think of putting those oxidized oils in your skin! So stick with coconut oil, or maybe olive oil, but I prefer coconut oil because of the healthy omega-3 fatty acids. You can also add other stuff to your liking, such as a little bit of oregano oil (antibacterial) or Argan oil (vitamin E), but that is optional. More good news: You do not have to leave it on for 10 minutes since this is based on coconut oil (or olive, or whatever good oil you chose since I know you love yourself and did not choose corn oil) which is pretty nourishing and you can leave it on overnight and it only dries your skin a bit, if at all.  There you go people, your own product and you know exactly what is in it. Isn&#x27;t that cool? You can also control the percentage sulfur in your cream, this product is 10% percent but you can go a little bit higher (or lower) and it does not seem to irritate the skin. Listen to your skin to determine the correct percentage of sulfur you need.  I&#x27;ll list a source of sulfur and coconut oil you can use, these are very good products:  Sulfur: http://www.amazon.com/Sulfur-Powder-Sublimed-Oz-Pack/dp/B0013ND5AK  Coconut oil: http://www.amazon.com/Natures-Way-Organic-Coconut-Ounce/dp/B003B3OOPA  I wish you luck.</li>
    <li> I tried this product after trying what seemed like everything else for my acne. At least everything natural. Manuka honey, baking soda, jojoba oil, tea tree oil, coconut oil, alcohol free witch hazel, bentonite clay, apple cider vinegar. I had high hopes for this stuff, since it got so many good reviews, but it does not seem to work well for me. I put it on in the evenings, since it smells pretty bad, and wash it off after an hour or so. My skin doesn&#x27;t really dry out too much from it, despite being sensitive, but it doesn&#x27;t seem to clear up deeper acne. Anything small and on the surface would sometimes dry up and be alleviated, but for the most part it almost seems as though the sulfur does little to no good. If you have deeper breakouts or cystic acne, chances are this won&#x27;t work.</li>
    <li> This cream is great for people with blackheads/whiteheads and overall complexion of skin. What I like about this product is the creamy texture. The only downside is the smell. The smell actually stays with you even after you washed it off, so I would recommend you apply this nightly. Also, make sure to wash it off before 10 minutes or it will dry and will be hard to wash off. I usually apply this, then follow it with an exfoliating scrub. I give this a 4 out of 5 for effectiveness, and one star short because of the bad smell.</li>
    <li> its work perfect for my daughter acne. they need to make it like a cream its too grezy for face  and also its burn people eyes. but I still like it because my 14 year old daughter is acne free now.</li>
    <li> Best thing I&#x27;ve ever found for acne! I only wear it at night because it is kind of greasy, but it definitely works! This little bottle lasted me over a year so probably the cheapest thing out there and by far the best! You don&#x27;t need to use a lot. It says to wash it off after 10 minutes... my skin is not that sensitive so I leave it on all night. If you have sensitive skin you might now be able to do that. Watch how often you use it because it can dry out your skin if you use it too often. I use it everyday until my breakout is gone then back off. I also use a sulfur based cleanser and a sulfur lotion in the morning and that combination has given me the clearest skin I&#x27;ve had in about 15 years! You can ask you doctor for a prescription for the sulfur cleanser and lotion.</li>
    <li> I came across this stuff while searching for Sastid, a very effective and quite expensive sulphur soap I used as a teenager. I have a bit of rosacea and athlete&#x27;s foot so I thought I&#x27;d give this ointment a try. Within a few days the little bumps and whiteheads on my face had cleared up, and the ointment seems to add an extra kick to the cortisone-foot cream mixture my doctor recommends. It&#x27;s quite mild smelling for a sulphur product and while it feels greasy it rinses off cleanly. Try it before spending big bucks on skin creams and prescription rosacea treatments.</li>
    <li> The effect is not agree.</li>
    <li> I use this on active acne. It does work by reducing the pimple down. However the pimple become harden under the skin. I can feel the bump, and it does not go away. It&#x27;s appear as a red spot. I just want to squeeze it out and get it over with, but it seems rather impossible. Luckily several months later, the pimple grew back and I was able to squeeze it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am not going to use this produce on my pimple again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried several over the counter medication for my breakout. This one is the best! However, it can get a bit messy/oily (it&#x27;s ointment!), but I don&#x27;t care. I want my face to clear up. This works really well with big heads. I just randomly get them from time to time. It&#x27;s a pain to have to stare at it in the mirror. This will stop the breakout (the white yucky stuff)! Try it!</li>
    <li> Desde hace unos cuantos anos he padecido de problemas de acne y este empeoro con mi ultimo embarazo. El enrojecimiento y los dolorosos  brotes deterioraron considerablemente mi piel y con ello mi autoestima. Desde q lo comenze a usar en solo una semana los brotes cesaron y el enrojecimiento desaparecio. Ahora despues de dos meses mi piel se ha aclarado bastante y definitivamente se siente mas suave!   La piel lo absorbe rapido y el olor peculiar desaparece en unos cuantos minutos. Es lo mejor que he comprado! Solo quisiera que lo enviaran directo a Puerto Rico tambien!</li>
    <li> *****A very important edit to my review:   I used this for 5 years because it was the only thing just worked for cystic acne, but decided to try retin a, when I thought this wasn&#x27;t working for me anymore. After retin a made my skin hideous (I used it for 8 months), I pulled out an old tub of this ointment. When I opened it, there was pink fungus inside the old jar! I&#x27;m not blaming the company, or anything (I then opened a sealed jar I&#x27;d had for at least a year and it was perfect), I&#x27;m blaming myself, for not even wondering this was possible. I&#x27;m also thinking I may have been using this product with fungus in it before, not knowing, which most likely caused more acne, which led to me using retin a and causing even more acne!  I&#x27;m writing this to let acne sufferers know to throw out unsealed jars that have been opened for a while, if they feel like this product stopped working!  I started using this product again last night (the sealed jar lol) and a cyst I had for 3-4 days, had come to a head! When I used this product before,  I was using it mixed with moisturizer, but since I&#x27;m trying the, no moisturizer route, I simply washed my face with dove sensitive skin beauty bar, applied a very thin layer of this on my whole face, applied a thicker layer to active bumps, then went to sleep.  Bottom line: I really think the reason this stopped working is because I wasn&#x27;t paying attention to what may&#x27;ve been happening to exposed product for a long time. I&#x27;m also going to make sure I don&#x27;t use my fingers to scoop the product out of the jar.  Another edit: I&#x27;ve always thought this stuff was so greasy on my face (I sleep with it on because it works best for me that way) and I wished there was something better. I recently found another version of this, called, San Marcos 10% sulfur. It&#x27;s made with plant based ingredients, instead of PEG and it&#x27;s matte on my face. Sorry, De la Cruz, I was loyal for so long, but I *may&#x27;ve* found a replacement! I&#x27;ve only tested it out once, but so far, so good. I&#x27;ll keep de la Cruz on my sink, just in case ;) ***  Original review: i mix this equally with moisturizer, rub the mixture all over my face and my acne is mostly gone!  i usually have very oily skin, cystic acne, black heads, white heads and red acne scars... i&#x27;ve tried many products, including prescription acne meds and nothing has worked like this!! i&#x27;ve only been using the product for 2 weeks and i haven&#x27;t had any cystic acne since i&#x27;ve started using it! my skin flakes off but that&#x27;s helping the red marks fade fast... i just wipe my face off with a towel to get rid of the peeling skin. if you&#x27;ve suffered with acne and haven&#x27;t had any luck with other products, give this a shot!  Update: this did work for 4-5 years and it was nice to have it around as a safe acne product while I was pregnant. But, it eventually stopped working for me and I recently decided to try retin-a again.</li>
    <li> Sticky and did nothing for my son&#x27;s mild acne. I wouldn&#x27;t buy this again and I&#x27;ll probably end up tossing the container out.</li>
    <li> This seems so natural that I gave it four stars, but it did not really seem to do much for acne.  Maybe we did it wrong?  And it does smell like sulphur, so be prepared.</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t do any good for me.</li>
    <li> I think this stuff really works. It is a great addition to your arsenal if you don&#x27;t have a sulfur mask. Its easy to apply and doesn&#x27;t look scary on. Best of all it works great for the price. You will get at least 10 uses out of this little bottle. My acne is hormonal and only seems to respond to benzoyl peroxide or sulfur. Those two plus a good exfoliant are all I need.  I would recommend this to a friend.</li>
    <li> I bought this because it was described as Grisi cream in the item description and it is an ointment, not a cream.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great! You only have to you a tiny bit at a time or you can mix it with moisturizer.  Would highly recommend!!</li>
    <li> Works okay, but I won&#x27;t be ordering more. I&#x27;ll continue looking for a sulfur product that contains safe, non-toxic ingredients.</li>
    <li> I wrote a review for the grisi sulfur soap and this review is the same thing. I use the soap along with the de la Cruz sulfur ointment and garnier the brusher gel cleanser to exfoliate. First I wet my face with cool water, then wet the soap and lather it on my face, then with the brusher, I exfoliate my face in a circular motion for a few minutes and leave the soap on for 10 minutes like the instructions say (sometimes less than 10 minutes if I&#x27;m in a hurry). I rinse off with cold water, dry the face completely, then apply the ointment and leave it on for 10 to 15 minutes (I left it on for almost 30 minutes if not more and it really irritated my skin, so 15 minutes max). I rinse off with cold water. A moisturizer can be applied after since its drying at times, but my skin is oily so I don&#x27;t typically apply it. I&#x27;ve been using this method for about 3 weeks and my skin is so much clearer, I don&#x27;t need to wear concealer but I always do because I have some dark spots but even that has cleared a lot. The exfoliation has really made my skin so soft, I recommend using some type of exfoliation. This is how I wash my face twice a day (morning and night) everyday. I&#x27;m African American with brown skin (probably unnecessary to mention, but may be useful for those with darker skin) and this is the clearest my skin has been since high school and my early twenties, tho I&#x27;m 24.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will say at times I do use Dickinson&#x27;s witch hazel natural astringent and witch hazel pore perfecting toner after rinsing off the ointment but wait a few minutes before applying them. I also use aztec Indian clay and apple cider vinegar as a mask mix whenever I feel it&#x27;s necessary maybe twice a week. I was using these products for about 3 weeks before incorporating the products mentioned above.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I noticed a big difference once I started using the sulfur soap, ointment and brusher. I use these products more than the clay mask mix and toners. Makeup finally looks good on my skin since its clearer, softer, and smoother. Not to be cocky but I feel and think I&#x27;m prettier lol..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not a dermatologist, I&#x27;m just sharing what has helped me, I hope my routine helps someone else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I brought the soap and ointment from Walmart and the brusher from national liquidators in the Bronx or Yonkers, but it can be purchased online.</li>
    <li> I used to mix my own sulfur ointment until I discovered this premixed ointment in a local Dollar General store.  Been looking for it ever since.  Well worth the price because we use this on burns (instantly cools the skin) - rashes, insect bites, scrapes, etc.  It will dry on your skin a little but use a little peroxide to remove any bandaging and you will be amazed at how fast this stuff will heal any type of wound.</li>
    <li> This has been the only product to completely clear my skin since I turned into an adult. I have cystic/hormonal acne and anytime I have flare ups, I promptly use just a dab of this to dry it out. I&#x27;ve been using it for about a week now and my skin is brighter and less bumpy. It has even cleared some of my acne scars. There are people who are saying the smell is too strong, but I honestly can hardly smell anything. It does get stronger the longer you leave it on, but it&#x27;s nothing unbearable while something like Nair (the hair remover cream) smells awful to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There should be more warnings in these reviews though:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From personal experience, I leave it on overnight on large blemishes to dry them out. While it works, it does make make my skin peel! This is a positive and negative thing. It does make my skin sensitive and after a few days, I have to take a break to let my skin heal using lots of healing lotions to restore moisture and promote new growth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the upside, the peeling has removed a lot of dark scarring and I&#x27;ve been told I look fresher faced.  On the negative, it can sting a bit and you need to use a gentle face scrub to remove the flakes every morning and let your skin breathe. I also use a non-alcohol witch hazel/aloe toner to soothe the redness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wouldn&#x27;t personally spread this on my entire face unless I have all over acne. I use a thin amount on inflamed areas and let it sit overnight/during the day since I work from home. I&#x27;m really enjoying this product so far and it&#x27;s been trial/error to see how well it works or how much my skin can take before I need to take a break. It&#x27;s about the size of a Vaporub jar so you are definately getting your money&#x27;s worth to at least try it out over much more expensive and smaller acne products.</li>
    <li> Sulfur creams are the best for my skin and acne.  My mom used one on my skin when I was an infant and broke out.  I&#x27;ve tried other types of acne products over the years but they don&#x27;t work or irritate my skin, or just dry my skin out and make the situation worse.  I wish this product was in stores but the only place I can seem to find it is in Mexican stores in my area but even then they may not carry this cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do recommend that after using this cream to use a light moisturizer because if you don&#x27;t, your skin will feel tight.  I use organic coconut oil.</li>
    <li> This is by far the best cream for acne issues I&#x27;ve ever tried. This stuff works &amp; isn&#x27;t pricey..so it&#x27;s a win-win.</li>
    <li> Wife had a bad case of athletes foot after ignoring my repeated warnings about wearing flip-flops at the gym. By coincidence, we went to Costa-Rica and noticed that a few soaks in the volcanic hot-springs delivered instant relief.  Absent volcanic hot-springs, this ointment is the way to go.</li>
    <li> Hello, this is my first review but felt compelled to write a review as this stuff works!  I have tried all types of creams, ointments, pills, washes, vitamins, etc. to get rid of my acne.  Nothing seemed to work until I discovered sulfur.  This stuff is a miracle I put it on after my face is clean and sometimes sleep with it on.  It has dried up so many of my pimples and really reduced my break outs.  I am also taking this with Pantothenic acid, I don&#x27;t know if the pantothenic acid is helping but I definitely know the sulfur is a huge help for surface pimples.  The price is unbeatable - just try it!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Horrible product! Made my skin break out so bad. Very greasy and bad smell even when using the smallest amount. Do NOT use if you have sensitive skin. Days later my skin is dry and pealing. Going in the garbage.</li>
    <li> I have cystic acne. Usually one or two at a time, with one starting as the other is shrinking. I&#x27;ve tried every medicine/treatment under the sun except Accutane, and this is the quickest to work. At first, my skin did \\&quot;purge,\\&quot; but the pimples are shrinking and fading very quickly. I&#x27;ve been using it for about two weeks now and I have to say I am very happy. The directions say to put it on for 10 minutes and to wash it off with water. I&#x27;ve done that, and I&#x27;ve also left it on overnight, and mixed it with Cetaphil moisturizer and worn that at night. None of them had negative reactions. There is a little bit of peeling, but a quick \\&quot;scrub\\&quot; of baking soda and water work wonders in exfoliating the skin every couple of days. So cheap, and so quick. I hope my skin doesn&#x27;t become immune to this like it did to other treatments (espeically ProActive).</li>
    <li> I have adult acne (white heads and systic pimples mostly) and this product is a great spot treatment.  I have tried using teatree oil, salicylic acid, benzoyl peroxide and charcoal masks - nothing worked.  One dab of this ointment and the spots dried out. The directions say to leave the product on for 10 mins.....this time worked for some of my spots but the larger/deeper ones needed another treatment or a longer treatment.  I did leave the product on for about an hour and didn&#x27;t have any over-drying occur (but my skin isn&#x27;t very dry to begin with).  I didn&#x27;t think the ointment&#x27;s smell was too bad - it seems to have some sort of fragrance added to combat the sulfur smell.</li>
    <li> I bought this because my husband and I acquired a slight case of bed bugs. Dabbing a bit on the bites after bathing helped to relieve the itching.</li>
    <li> Using this every 2-3 days for 10 minutes completely got rid of my itchy back acne in about 2 weeks and has kept me clear for the past 2 or 3 months of use</li>
    <li> Really useful to kill ticks! I applied it 3 to 5 days and finally those little bugs were gone from my finger.</li>
    <li> I read a reviewer that recommended to leave it on 10 min and wash it off. That is actually the directions on the label. I do that and then go to bed. I have smaller pores and clear skin! My skin is so soft and smooth. If I have an active breakout, I apply a very small amount to it overnight, and it is significantly smaller in the am! Great product!! Thanks!</li>
    <li> As others have pointed out, it feels like a paste. It&#x27;s also a little gritty. It never completely dries, and in a way that&#x27;s good, because I think it&#x27;s more active when it&#x27;s not all dried out. It&#x27;s water based, so it rinses right off. I&#x27;ve worn it out to run an errand; it doesn&#x27;t look especially noticeable. I can&#x27;t smell it. My boyfriend can faintly smell it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After just a few days, my face is improved. It leaves my skin feeling like a very mild sunburn--pink, tight and smooth. It burns just slightly on me; some people would find it more irritating. I leave it on several hours without any problem, but my skin is used to such things. It&#x27;s important to wear sunscreen when you&#x27;re out. (I don&#x27;t try to wear them simultaneously.) I think it&#x27;s definitely helping with my acne, which tends to be mild but extremely persistent. I also use their sulfur soap and really love that.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about 2-3 weeks in combination with the[[ASIN:B001LP64D0 Sulfur Soap with Lanolin]]. It is a small jar but a little seems like it will go a long way. You only need a very thin layer, it is very thick and goopy so this is easy to do. This product is VERY drying so you might want to try using it every other day at first until your skin gets used to it. A non comedogenic moisturizer will help with dryness also. This ointment will leave more of a lingering smell than just the soap so I recommend using it at night. The smell it leaves behind is a earthy scent and not the sulfur smell you will notice while it is on your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In combination with the soap I have noticed a remarkable improvement in my skin, I have much less acne and the overall smoothness of my face is remarkable. As drying as this product is at first it still leaves my skin very soft. I would recommend this to anyone sick of buying expensive acne washes and ointments that don&#x27;t get any results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wash my face with the sulfur soap and leave it on for 10 minutes like the directions state and then apply this ointment and let it sit on my face for 10 minutes. When I wash it off I use some witch hazel to snap my pores closed and use a little moisturizer when necessary.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always had pink cheeks, but in the last year the redness escalated to a kind of constant sunburned effect, and then bumps and blemishes appeared all over my face.  I started using this sulfur pomade 10 days ago, and the result is nothing less than miraculous.  This is the first skin product I&#x27;ve ever used where I actually experienced a visible transformation - and in such a short time!  The redness has subsided, the blemishes are gone, and the surface of my face is smooth and fine-pored (and I&#x27;m not young).  It definitely dries out the skin at a very deep level - not just flaking, but deep tightness and even wrinkling - so you have to use a good moisturizer, and my skin is more sensitive (stings with suntan lotion), but, holy cow, this is an extraordinary result.</li>
    <li> I was using tretinoin before I got pregnant, which was the best thing for my comodones.  When I stopped using it, my acne immediately went CRAZY.  I started applying azelaic acid and erythromycin (I&#x27;ve used clindamycin which does nothing), but I had to stop the azelaic acid after a few weeks because it just stung too badly and didn&#x27;t seem to be doing anything (I was so miserable that I subjected myself to the pain for that long).  The erythromycin wasn&#x27;t doing much on it&#x27;s own but then I read that sulfur was safe during pregnancy. YES!  I started applying it as directed as a mask for ten minutes once a day and started seeing an improvement after only a few days.  I now use it maybe 5 times a week, leaving it on for longer than 10 minutes, sometimes up to an hour or however long I feel like it, and about 6 weeks later my face looks just about as good as it did when I was on tretinoin.  It&#x27;s great for pulling blackheads and even dormant pimples to the surface (the ones that can sit deep under the skin for several months).  I still use erythromycin at night and clindamycin in the morning (makeup doesn&#x27;t apply well over erythromycin) but I definitely think the credit is due to the sulfur.  I don&#x27;t leave it on overnight because it does stain, but I have used teeny dabs overnight as spot treatment on the doozies and it works for keeping cystic pimples under control.  P.S. The ointment doesn&#x27;t smell that bad, but you are probably desperate anyway and it&#x27;s a small price to pay.  This product is so cheap that there&#x27;s no reason why you shouldn&#x27;t at least try it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been struggling with acne since i was a teenager and after spouts of clear skin, here I am in my late twenties fighting serious cystic breakouts on my chin and jawline. I&#x27;ve tried almost everything minus adoxa and accutante with little to no result. My mom suggested I try more hollistic and natural remedies so I started using tea tree oil wash, zinc and vitamin A supplements and mira cell. I read on a lot of blogs about the power of sulfur and for $5.49 I had to try it. It cleaned up my cysts in a week. I used it the first time as directed as a mask, but let me warn you the smell is gross. At first I thought only I could smell it but when my boyfriend commented that he could smell it a bar stool away, I decided to use it at night mixed with cetaphil moisturizer. It stinks your pillowcase but you should change your pillowcase every other day anyway.  I still have scarring which will take time, but I am a believer in this product. It is strong and I suggest a gentle exfolitator to help you shed the dead skin but it works and that is all I care about.</li>
    <li> This stuff really dries your skin out so be careful.  I think it helps at least some, we&#x27;ll see.  Use it sparingly and put plenty of lotion on!</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t work at all and dried my skin to the point of leather and sweet Lord did it smell.The sulfur odor stayed with me for a few days.</li>
    <li> This cream cleared up the majority of my acne and scarring in only a couple days of use. Incredible! I have tried Proactive, every single Neutrogena acne product, tea tree oil, hydrogen peroxide, benzoyl peroxide, Clinique, Stridex, AcneFree and other sets from the drugstore. None of it worked like this, absolutely nothing. The reason why I wanted to try it is because I know many ancient cultures such as Romans used sulfur baths as an acne treatment, and obviously they knew what they were doing. I highly recommend!</li>
    <li> It works really well per directions.  It makes a difference in about two weeks.  Good thing to try when all else fails, especially the expensive ointments.</li>
    <li> I have moderate rosacea.  I tried this and it works better than the oral antibiotic and prescription cream I was prescribed!!  Redness gone, and the acne from rosacea is almost non existent.  This is the ONLY thing I use!  I use it once a day, what an amazing difference!  If your struggling with rosacea, please try it</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t notice it doing a whole lot.</li>
    <li> Have not a chance to use item the way I would like to, but I mix it with other products and it seems to be working fine.</li>
    <li> Hit with cystic acne in my 40&#x27;s, this stuff has been a GREAT find!  I have to use it in addition to other products, but I can tell when I&#x27;ve used vs. not used it.  The smell isn&#x27;t great--sulfur never is--and it takes a little bit to dry, but the product is excellent and far, far cheaper than other remedies.  I will certainly continue to buy/use this product.</li>
    <li> This is a great product for stubborn acne, cuts, and irritations.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s almost like going to the hot springs!</li>
    <li> It is sticky and does not dry. it doesn&#x27;t even work! i wish i paid attention to 1 stars rating.</li>
    <li> this sulfar ointment cream is very thick and greasy with a horrible smell. my daughter used it for two weeks for clearing acne/blackheads did nothing but a gave her a shiny, greasy complexion and offended everyone around her with the smell.</li>
    <li> I like this stuff. I used this alongside the sulfur soap for a skin condition I had and this helped me a LOT! Will use it again if I need to!</li>
    <li> This product works great on cystic acne.  This, in addition to salicylic alcohol, has cleared up my son&#x27;s face.  Several other acne products did not work.</li>
    <li> For the longest time I thought I had really bad acne, focused on areas of my face that have hair (eyebrows, facial hair), and had some dandruff/scaling of my scalp. Now I&#x27;m in medical school and know a thing or two. Before, I figured the two conditions were unrelated and treated the acne with typical medications but with little improvement. I realized that what I actually have is seborrheic dermatitis and not just refractory acne. It can look similar to acne, occurs mainly where there is body hair (including chest hair in men), and varies in severity. I suspect I&#x27;m not the only one who has mixed up acne with this other dermatologic condition. Since using the cream I have noticed improvement, but since I&#x27;m not taking any prescription meds at the moment (there are a number of options available), I still have occasional flare-ups.&lt;br /&gt;It is nice to have something over the counter that is relatively effective!</li>
    <li> This product arrived quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have had different results with it on different days but I am giving it 5 stars because it really seemed to exfoliate my problem skin away, and I will continue to use it (but with caution).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I agree with previous reviewers...follow the directions!! Do not leave it on longer than the recommended 10 minutes. Test it in a small area first. The effect of this product lasted for several days after using it. (My skin continued to flake off).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only problem I had with it was when I used it a couple of hours following another facial scrub product. My skin looked sunburnt for 2 days following this! (Then it &#x27;peeled&#x27; and looked pretty great after that.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really think this works well for drying out problems such as rosacea and acne. It could be one of those &#x27;it gets worse before it gets better&#x27; products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I have discovered in my search for clear skin is that different products work differently for different skin types. My skin can&#x27;t tolerate daily use of sulfur. However, I am going to continue using it about once a week. It does well clearing up the dead skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the price, it is definitely worth a try!</li>
    <li> The first day I bought it, I didn&#x27;t read the instructions that you are only supposed to leave it on for 15 minutes and wash off. I put it on at night as a spot cream, and woke up to way clearer skin! I wouldn&#x27;t do this daily as it would dry the skin, so I use it as directed now - but still use it as a nighttime spot cream and it is amazing! I have been struggling with my skin for way too long in life and was so tired of wearing make up. I kid you not, now all I wear on my skin during the day is a tinted moisturizer and a tiny bit on concealer on post acne marks. I had previously been buying Kate Somerville&#x27;s Eradikate which is expensive and works awesome too, but this is cheaper and works just as great. I swear Sulfur is the way to go for acne/pimples. My dad used to tell me when I was younger to use the tinted Clearasil cream, but I didn&#x27;t realize it was the Sulfur Resorcinol that was doing the trick, and I actually should have listened to him because I eneded up just buying benzol peroxide and sacilyc  acid products. But this stuff is even better. Even if you don&#x27;t get this product specifically, go for the product with 10% sulfur! I think they will all work great, it just depends on what kind of consistency you want in a product. This stuff does not dry, it remains wet on your skin and is more like a creamy type of product...not sure how else to describe it.</li>
    <li> I struggled with acne so much I was ready to give up an go into hiding. I stumbled across this product and in 2 days the acne was completely gone. I used other products to help with clearing the dark spots and now, just two weeks later I&#x27;m looking like myself again. And as a bonus... I sometimes get fever blisters.  So the last time I felt the tingle of one coming on, I used the sulphur cream on it and I was amazed that it never appeared. That has never happened. So this will be a product I&#x27;m sure to keep on hand.  **All Smiles!!</li>
    <li> I have been a proactive user and fan for three years until my skin started becoming extremely oily and not longer responded to proactive. I tried clear zine, acne free and so many other products. I wake up with so much oil on my face lately even after using an acne product. You could probably fry an egg with the amount of oil my skin produces per day. The acne i get is every kind and every where, face chest back neck. I used this product for one night, and it did dry the oil on my face and no new acne came out today. Usually I get 1-3a day on my face and countless on my back.. , I woke up to an amazing skin. I used it for 10 minutes and then rinsed it in the shower. Then after showering before bed, I mixed some sulfur ointment with cetephhil moisturizing cream and spread it on my face. This is not ur fancy beauty cream. This is a very sticky goopy gritty cream. BUT if u tried every other acne treatment out there you probably won&#x27;t care about the sticky feeling you get when u use it. It is a little smelly, but nothing that will get in the way to clear skin. Of course it is a little itchy, or warm, it&#x27;s getting ur pores cleaned. I can even feel the tingling on my face. The most important thing is to moisturize ur skin while using this. I will continue using and will update in a week.</li>
    <li> Good product. Work as expected and fast shipment.</li>
    <li> Its stinky, goopy, and I&#x27;m not sure if it works. The smell permeates and it is difficult to wash off.  The warming sensation is nice, however. I was looking for a magic bullet for my weird keratin pillaris/ hives and this wasn&#x27;t it. I reccomend formula 10.0.6 deep down detox over this.</li>
    <li> I love this product I had a Custer of ance  under my chain and in less  then a week they dried up. All I did was use the product once a day every day and like I said before the end of the week they where  gone. I have suffer with bad skin all my adult  life  and tried lot of expensive  product and this product works and it is 40-60% cheaper than all the other product our there.</li>
    <li> This did not do much for me. It did not seem to help my skin with the pimples, but I think what works for one person may not work for someone else.</li>
    <li> So I figured I&#x27;d give this a couple of weeks before leaving a review as most people right a review after a few days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think the smell was expected since it&#x27;s a sulfur treatment and they tend to smell...like...well...sulfur.  I didn&#x27;t care as I&#x27;m nearing 30 and have had acne near 18 years now.  It started off as hormonal, then around the age of 22 it got so bad that I had cystic acne and just bumps everywhere that I saw a dermatologist.  I was prescribed 2-500 mg pills of sulfamethoxazole and I had to use differin gel, glytone face wash, and I ended up clearing up in two months.  I got a chemical peel for all the scarring and stayed on the dermatologist regimen for roughly two years.  I did have to change to Retain-A micro as my skin became immune to the differin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I mostly now just get hormonal acne or whenever I wear makeup so I&#x27;ve cut makeup out of my life for work and save it for major events.  I decided to try Bye Bye Blemish before this and noticed it helped clear up acne pimples before they came to a head, or if they did and I found myself popping them, it would clear them up within days.  So I figured I&#x27;d give De La Cruz a try when I saw it as a recommended product on Amazon.  I absolutely LOVE IT.  I started off using it twice a day, in the morning and at a night.  I usually just get acne on my cheeks and chin, and right above my lip so that is where I put it.  At first, I left it on for the 10 minutes, but then I gradually moved up to an hour.  I now keep it on for an hour or more but only use it at night.  I don&#x27;t really put any acne cream on or anything but rather just use Bye Bye Blemish before bed on any acne spots I see forming.  And by morning they are gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also bought sulfur soap as the sulfur finally seems to be the key acne product I was missing from my life.</li>
    <li> The seal on my cream was open. So I haven&#x27;t even dared to use it on my already troubled skin. Needless to say I&#x27;ve wasted ten dollars on this product.</li>
    <li> Made my breakouts worse will never use again</li>
    <li> All &amp; All pretty good. Has a greasy feel to it, so you only need a little. Does Not make your face greasy, though.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend using as a spot treatment. It pulls things out of your pores, that you don&#x27;t realize were there.&lt;br /&gt;One drawback is that I can still smell the sulfur, only will use at night.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff!! It kills acne better than any script you can get filled!!  Try it and you&#x27;ll love it!!</li>
    <li> my 15 yr old loves this and it seems to work but a little too much sometimes. if she leaves it on too long, the skin on her face is very flaky and makes her pimples look even worse. i tell her not to use it everyday, maybe 3 times a week is enough and not to leave on for more than 5 min if your skin is on the sensitive side.</li>
    <li> Greasy.  Don&#x27;t like the composition of this at all. The best zit spot ointment is Aveda&#x27;s spot treatment. It&#x27;s pricey, but a tube will last for months.</li>
    <li> So far so good. If you can stand the fishy smell of this then you will love what it can do for you.  I&#x27;ve been using it for three weeks now at least once a week and I love the way my skin feels. I would up it to every day but my hubby says it smells to fishy so the max I&#x27;ve washed my face with it is three times per week.</li>
    <li> This cream has helped my daughters acne when nothing else has done any good. We have been using it along with the sulphur soap</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t liked this product. It didn&#x27;t worked for me , and is overpriced. I do not recommend it at all</li>
    <li> Seriously, this product really works.  I use it on my husbands face and back.  He has really bad acne issues and as long as he uses this regularly, I saw great improvement.</li>
    <li> I dont really enjoy this smell,and I dont like its consistency. Im not sure what the product actually does for my face.</li>
    <li> Just purchased first time acne got really bad didn&#x27;t respond to benzoyl peroxide, salicylic acid, or mint julep mask. Had bad flare up. Used exfoliator scrub then this. Rubbed it in good and left on overnight. I woke up with my pimples smaller and not red inflamed. Day 2 acne cleared up enough for makeup. Great! After a 2 week breakout this was the only thing that worked!  Buy it try it it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
    <li> Cheap and an easy fix for your acne . Does not smell too much easy to put on. Works great for me.</li>
    <li> Just like everyone else, I suffer from horrible adult acne! The side of my face is always covered in either cystic acne and or scars.  I came upon this after searching for acne cures.  Having tried every over the counter internal and topical treament and have been to several dermatologists. I was told my only solution was Actune which I did not want to do.  I&#x27;ve only had this product for week and have already seen great results my face is not acne free better is improving for sure. I have been applying with my moisturizer and also just dabbing it on the larger pimples and leaving on over night.  It has cleared up my biggest problem areas.  My only warning is like the label I think states keep away from eyes!!  I do not have sensitive skin but I must have accidentally had some residue left on my fingers while applying moisturizer to my eyes because the next morning my eyes were all puffy but it did go away after a few hours.  This products blows all the others out of the water that I have tried and is at a great price!</li>
    <li> Not sure what is in the ingredients.  It&#x27;s oily first of all.  As soon as I put this stuff on, my skin broke out all over.  Horrible stuff.  I returned it.</li>
    <li> I know other people have commented on this, but this ointment smells so bad! I don&#x27;t even know if it works because I&#x27;ve only used it twice. The smells stays on your face and washcloth for a long time. Even if you can&#x27;t smell it, other people will be able to smell it. I tried washing my face with other face washes to get the smell out but nothing helped.</li>
    <li> I am a 16 year old male with moderate acne. I&#x27;ve been attempting to solve this problem for years  with little success. I&#x27;ve tried numerous products over the past few years containing salicylic acid and benzoyl peroxide. Salicylic acid works well for about a week or so, and then quickly stop helping. I haven&#x27;t found a definitive answer as to way this is, but that problem seems to be a common compliant.  Benzoyl peroxide works okay, but I tend to have darker post-acne parks afterwards, which take months to go away completely. None of these products have ever cleared my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A few months ago, I began to thoroughly research acne. Why I didn&#x27;t do this earlier is a mystery to me, as the more information you have the better. Like I&#x27;m sure most of you have, I spend a good amount of time reading advice at acne.org, which recommends heavy use of 2.5% benzoyl peroxide and mild use of 10% glycolic acid. Glycolic acid is a chemical exfoliator that unclogs pores from the inside, rather than breaking down skin from the outside like salicylic acid.  I wanted to avoid benzoyl peroxide, but I absorbed the other information and continued my reading. This is when I first learned about Sulfur, which seems to be in very little products sold at retail stores, and thus why I had never used it before. What I liked most about Sulfur was the fact that it is anti-bacterial, so no only would it dry out acne, but it would also kill the acne bacteria, which is exactly what needs to be done for cysts and papules.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This sounded great, so I went Amazon and bought De La Cruz along with a bottle of Alpha Hydrox Oil-Free Formula(glycolic acid). I started using both immediately, exactly as the bottles instructed. I started with one application a day of both products, but I saw little results and  moved up to two applications. My skin became about 90% clear.  However, within about 5 days my skin began to peel, and out of fear of over drying, I stopped use of both products and tried to re-hydrate my skin. This was not a good idea. I broke out and my skin looked worse than it did before. I&#x27;ve since gone back to twice a application, adding in a moisturizer to keep my skin form drying out again. The product label says it leave it on for 10 minutes, then wash it off, but I feel a 20-30min application works far better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have not used De La Cruz without  Alpha Hydrox, so I can&#x27;t say how well it works by itself, but thus far it has been the best product I&#x27;ve used.  Acne is gone within days, and my skin is only slightly red afterwards, which seems to be unavoidable. It is always extremely effective at keeping my oily forehead dry. My skin is slowly but surely improving, and the price for the products are just right. Give Sulfur a try. I did, and I feel much better for doing so.to re-hydrate my skin. This was not a good idea.

    <li> i&#x27;m 35 and have moderate hormonal acne. i used this product bec of the positive reviews. i followed the instructions very carefully and i knew that it gets worse before it gets better. but instead, after 2 months, i developed cystic acne and it was really painful. i had to go to my doctor and was instructed to stopped the sulfur and to use very mild soap and moisturizer (i use cetaphil and oil free neutrogena moisturizer). i also had to take antibiotics and my doctor instead prescribed retinol 0.01%. i&#x27;m happy to report that my cystic acne disappeared but i have the scars that i cover with makeup. i really don&#x27;t recommend this sulfur product.</li>
    <li> I could never find anything that could get my acne away, not even just regular soap and water or other face washes. My mom&#x27;s boyfriend had bought this from the store for himself but I started using it and have been since like 3/2yrs ago and it be finally came to the end of the container so I will buy another one from here. I usually put it on over night, helps alot.</li>
    <li> Works well. It does get rid or acne over time of using it.it may smell horrible but it works!</li>
    <li> I cannot get over the smell.  It did not help my son&#x27;s skin, however, his skin is sensitive so that may be the problem.</li>
    <li> This has a very very bad smell ( as other reviews mentioned). I don&#x27;t see any significant improvement of my skin except for the bad smell.</li>
    <li> My 2 year old daughter had a persistant rash on her diaper area that started to trail down her legs.  It would not go away with any of the ointments or  creams we tried- and we tried them all- I began to suspect scabies but doctor said it wasn&#x27;t and prescribed a yeast infection ointment.  Dr. Prescribed ointment did nothing- decided to try this and luckily it worked!</li>
    <li> The smell is so bad; that I had to wash it off!  I bought it to treat acne, but I don&#x27;t know if it works because I couldn&#x27;t leave it on because of the smell.</li>
    <li> Helped to clear up my eczema much more quickly than meds. I used this product successfully with the sulfur soap and Durvet Nu-Stock. Please keep these products available!</li>
    <li> Very good for my face</li>
    <li> is exactly what i ordered. worked perfectly as i hoped and was cheaper that chain or department stores here in town. thank you</li>
    <li> Very good for reducing size and occurrence of acne</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried this over and over again and it has absolutely no effect on any type of breakout for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It didn&#x27;t irritate my skin or break me out further, and it also has decent ingredients, so it may be worth a try if you&#x27;re interested in sulfur. It&#x27;s a safe ingredient while pregnant/breastfeeding which is a plus (as your options are pretty limited).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you do decide to try keep in mind that products in tubs like this can be unsanitary if you&#x27;re not careful - I suggest using a q-tip or something else clean to get the product out before applying to your face.</li>
    <li> Best treatment for acne ever!!!! This is the cheapest and most effective treatment I have ever used! LOVE it!!! Ever since I bought it 2 months ago I have less acne outbreaks. I use it only when I start sensing something is coming up, a little redness or bulkiness on my skin or when it already comes out. I just put some cream for the night, in the morning it is either gone or almost gone. I usually apply 2-3 times, never used it more than that in a row. When I was in hot and humid weather it did dry my skin, in regular weather it&#x27;s actually ok. But is does tent to dry skin a little. nothing major. In the past I have used tea tree oil but now since I discovered this little ointment I don&#x27;t need ANYTHING!!!!! No need to buy tens of dollars of expensive cremes and treatments.I am so happy!!!!! Best thing ever!!!!! I discovered this after trying Kate Somerville EradiKate, but it costs like $40-60 I figured I&#x27;d just try sulfur without all the brand names and other ingredients and I am very happy that I did. This is THE best thing I have ever used, and I am in my mid 40s!!!!! So I have tried many.</li>
    <li> This works very well but tarnished my sterling silver everyday. I like to sleep and shower in my earrings, necklace and rings but this sulfur turned everything black. If it wasn&#x27;t for the inconvenience for having to remove my \\&quot;bling\\&quot; every day, twice a day (Am and PM), I&#x27;d still be using it! Smell didn&#x27;t bother me really, helped w/ blackheads and whiteheads.</li>
    <li> Bought this product to try out for the first time.  Have not been using consistently like I would like.  BUT when I do use it, it seems to do the trick!  Dries annoying zits/pimpes and even brings to surface like blackheads.  I would recommend this product!</li>
    <li> i don&#x27;t like the smell and feel of it, im sure it works well</li>
    <li> When I was a teenager, I used Acnomel cake and it controlled my acne very well.  The main ingredient was sulphur.  The cake form of Acnomel is no longer made.  I was looking for a sulphur based acne medicine for my teenagers and my brother&#x27;s kids.  I found the Pomade sulphur cream and bought several jars for my daughter, my niece and nephew.  My nephew began using it right away and within a week most of his acne was gone.  My niece has tried it and she is still having lots of breakouts.  It works pretty well on my daughter too.  I think you have to use it twice per day for it to be effective.</li>
    <li> great for acne. just use a cotton swab to get a bit out. DO NOT stick your fingers in the jar even if they are washed. i dab a dot on a pimple and leave over night and in a day or two its almost gone. the only thing i dislike is i cant use too often because its harsh on skin and causes pealing and drying. its best just to dab a bit right on the pimple and no where else.</li>
    <li> Works pretty good on break outs.  I just use a q-tip and dab on at bed time for a couple of nights.  Seems to do the trick.  Does not clear the really deep &amp;#34;cystic&amp;#34; bumps.</li>
    <li> Just started using this product. Don&#x27;t know if it works on acne, but I can tell you it is an ointment- like Vaseline- so it is very greasy. Feels slimy and seems not a good idea to clog poor with ointment on faces already having acne problems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, if you touch your face anywhere this ointment may be and rub near your eyes, then your eyes will sting like crazy. And good luck getting that ointment 100% out of your eye area. I put some of this on my nose and inadvertently must have rubbed my nose and then eye area slightly with my hand. Took me 15 minutes of washing my face and eyes 3X to finally remove the sting. A cream would be a much better carrier for the active sulfur ingredient.</li>
    <li> Used to combat dry skin and irritations.  Works for me.  Recommend for use by my son who was&lt;br /&gt;instructed by a doctor to use this type soap.</li>
    <li> if you suffer from acne this product is amazing. it helps to dry it out without damaging your skin like harsh products. better to use a sulfer soap and then this product and has a greater effect on reducing and clearing up current acne and old ones too.</li>
    <li> This works for some, but I was one of the ones it didn&#x27;t work for. Broke me skin out more.</li>
    <li> Great product! Fast shipping! Thank you! A+</li>
    <li> So far, I&#x27;m loving this treatment, BUT I&#x27;ve only had it for a week. That being said , I will update after more treatments.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for less than a week and I can see already the difference!!! is a great stuff and it doesn&#x27;t smell so bad like the other reviews said, is a sulfur any way, not a perfume.&lt;br /&gt;5 starts for this cream.</li>
    <li> Amazing... Cleared my cystic acne almost completely within 30 days of use.</li>
    <li> I first discovered this product at a walgreens after reading the comments on the website and wao the first time i used it, i did see a big difference and have had people complement me for my skin. People with severe acne problems really should try this. It&#x27;s effective and cheap.</li>
    <li> After reading the reviews, I really had high hopes for this product, but it really didn&#x27;t do anything for me except leave a lingering smell even after washing off, that would make me gag during the day. The instructions state to cover the affected area in it, leave it on for 10-15 minutes or so and then wash off, which I did. I see some reviewers say they would leave it on all night, but I was afraid of the dryness this may cause, and I&#x27;d also never be able to sleep with the smell of this all over my face.</li>
    <li> Did not work at all for me and it usually does. May have been old.</li>
    <li> Great cream, really work!</li>
    <li> I get very bad acne on my body from time to time and this stuff works wonderfully. Within a week most of my acne has reduced dramatically i wish i knew about this product long time ago before spending money on more expensive products. The smell isnt really that bad either.</li>
    <li> This ointment has the main ingredient that is contained in Acnomel (sulfur) except that it is clear and much milder to the skin. The acne just dries up and disappears in a few days. Can be applied either after having washed the face or not washing the face. Best results are bedtime applications but can be applied anytime.</li>
    <li> Long story short about my fight with acne: Have had acne for about 15 years now.  Have tried doxycyline, tetracycline, monocycline, differen gel, proactive, retinal a, 10-15% benzyl even a small round of accutane and EVERYTHING under the sun OTC wise.  The only thing that worked for me was a pill called sulfa- something or another BUT It caused a widespread body rash through anytime I was in the sun.  I found this product on here and thought maybe a topical sulfur based product would be the way to go.  Sure as heck cleared up my acne in 3 days.  Very rarely get a pimple in the last 2-3 weeks since I have had it.  I hardly use any, I get my face wet with water and then rub in a very small amount and leave it on.  The directions say otherwise but this method works for me!</li>
    <li> I have had acne on and off since a teen I am now 33.  The issue started to get worse during college I went on Proactive it did work for a while then I stopped and tried the acnefree system (wanted to try something cheaper).  I started having major breakouts went back to Proactive and it only made the problem worse this time.  Then after that I tried every available product even prescription treatments, organic treatments, natural home remedies everything only made the problem worse.  I stumbled on this product looking for something with sulfur (the sulfur .mask from proactive was the only thing that made any difference) I saw the price and thought wth.  Thank you God that I did after all the prayers and being so close to buying the makeup that supposedly covers tattoos for my face this stuff works it really, really works.  I purchased it the first time in Sept have made it through one whole cycle it kept me clear except for 2 new pimples during that time of the month(big improvement over the usual 10 new ones with the awful huge papules). I cleanse my face then put this on 2 times a day in the morning about 10 mins at night about 30min to an hour wash it off use moisturizer and I do use the End-zit Acne control drying lotion as a spot treatment at night.  I thank God I found this product and my face is finally clearer (about 90% in a month)No longer do I feel I need to put a bag over my head, or the need for the makeup that covers tattoos.  If you have tried it all and none of it has worked for you please give this one a try.</li>
    <li> Works great, sulfur products are the only thing that works on my cystic acne. I didn&#x27;t realize before ordering but it&#x27;s actually a mask of sorts, in that you&#x27;re supposed to wash off in 10 minutes. Well, that&#x27;s not as effective for me, so I usually do overnight and don&#x27;t have a problem. My skin is pretty oily and not very sensitive though. Wearing it all day and night once did cause me some dry patches, though, so I would definitely not go over 8 hours or so.</li>
    <li> so I suffer from occasional breakouts but they are down right uncontrollable during the summer due to the heat, sweat and my oily skin. They usually don&#x27;t clear up until it starts to get nippy out and by then I&#x27;m left with a bunch of marks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried it all! Proactive, tea tree oil, black soap but nothing seemed to work and only seemed to make things worse. my dad then introduces me to this cream which I refused to use due to the smell which goes away after it&#x27;s rubbed in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started by cleaning my skin off with olay&#x27;s cold cream/makeup remover because I use a light amount of makeup, I then apply the neutrogena grapefruit scrub onto my face brush and might I say this also leaves your face flawless :). I then pat dry and clean around my eye area with witch hazel. Last but not least, this baby! I tell no lies when I say my pimples went away the SAME DAY! like literally, they dried right up and went away! I couldn&#x27;t believe it! Why hadn&#x27;t I been told about this sooner? A little goes a long way so I&#x27;ve been using the same jar for what&#x27;s about to be a year..I LOVEEEE this stuff...and will keep this apart of my face washing routine. You will not regret buying this!!!</li>
    <li> Too strong I&#x27;m afraid...at least for my skin complexion</li>
    <li> Discovered Prosacea and it worked great for my acne. Since the active ingredient in that product is sulfur, I figured this product might work as well and it does. You only leave it on for 10 mins., and then rinse it off. Easy and quick way to treat your acne and oily skin. A godsend.</li>
    <li> I choose this product because of the reviews and seriously I did see a result since 3 weeks. I had better result with 1 mesure of msm powder mixed with approximatly 4 mesure of honey. It had burn my face and makes it flaky. I wasn&#x27;t worried cuz I already read it on the reviews so I was knowing that it can be possible. But after 3 week I am desappointed. I wont rebuilt this product and wont recommand this too. Also that I now know that one of the 2 ingredients is SO CANCERIGEN. OUFF No THank !</li>
    <li> I love this stuff, I use it as an overnight spot treatment and it works great!  I&#x27;ve just started using it as a daily face mask, hopefully it is just as effective.</li>
    <li> This stuff works great for acne, it is great for trouble spots.  I usually just dab a little bit on</li>
    <li> Watch your eyes, even if it doesn&#x27;t touch your eyes, it can irritate them...</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re reading this I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;ve tried just as many items as I have to control your acne. Honestly, the best thing I did was change my diet, but for those times that I&#x27;ve eaten bad for a few days this item is the remedy! It know it says to wash it off after 20 minutes or so, but before I go to bed, I wash my face, then moisturize, and then put a really light layer of the sulfur cream on the parts of my face that are prone to acne. Go to sleep and voila! Most everything has disappeared or at the very least shrunk by morning. This cream does wash off easily with just water (which is how I &amp;#34;wash&amp;#34; my face in the morning). It doesn&#x27;t quite soak into your skin, and by that I mean it can be a little sticky/tacky for a while, but honestly I haven&#x27;t had any real issues with that apart from my hair wanting to stick to my face. I also can&#x27;t tell that it stains anything (it&#x27;s yellow in color and my sheets are white) and it doesn&#x27;t bleach everything you touch like benzoyl peroxide does. Also, since you use a light layer, this bottle will last you for quite a while. I will never go without this in my medicine cabinet again!</li>
    <li> This product is excellent. I am using it for my dog&#x27;s skin problem; however it didn&#x27;t last long, so I had also purchased the flowers of sulphur powder and have added it to my own \\&quot;concoction\\&quot; of a skin salve.  If you don&#x27;t need it for a long period of time, this would suffice.  If you need to use it for a long time, I would buy the powdered sulphur and make up your own.</li>
    <li> I have struggled with acne for over a decade. My skin has responded well to sulfur in the past, so I decided to give this a go. WOW. I have been using for less than a week, and my skin looks the best it has in YEARS. Almost completely clear, and I&#x27;ve seen a drastic reduction in blackheads, too. This has worked better for me than prescription creams. And the price? You have to be kidding me! I can&#x27;t recommend this stuff highly enough! I only regret I didn&#x27;t discover this years ago!</li>
    <li> A great way to get rid of mild to moderate acne...sulfur ointment is easy to use and relatively inexpensive. The product works well if you&#x27;re very cautious in what you touch and avoid contact with anything other than your skin. However, it can be harsh on sensitive skin and the sulfur can hurt your clothes and jewelry!  It&#x27;s very important to take your time and clean up thoroughly to avoid stains or damages to other items.  I would also recommend tea tree oil for acne.  It&#x27;s less intense on sensitive skin -[[ASIN:B009YCEMU4 100% Australian Tea Tree Oil + FREE Blemish Roll-on Stick with Tea Tree Oil]].  I&#x27;d read a lot about tea tree oil and had mixed feelings about it because it was an oil, but I gave it a try anyway.  After one use, I noticed it worked, and even better than the sulfur ointment had in the same time frame. Being all natural, it left me less concerned with potential damages that the ointment had.  If I have the time to spend, I still use the ointment, but when I&#x27;m in a hurry, the tea tree oil is a great alternative. I carry it with me- it&#x27;s quick, easy, and painless while still clearing my skin. It&#x27;s like having a travel alternative for my on-the-go days, and a home remedy for the lazy ones!</li>
    <li> So my mom bought me this ointment because I kept complaining about my acne and I never used it. I was always for products like Neutrogena or Loreal and such. And once I was out of those face washes I started getting pimples again and so I FINALLY decided to try it and to my surprise, it worked. At first I didn&#x27;t see much results but after like a week and a half my face was clearing up. BUT I got a bad habit of applying it at night and sleeping with it on my face. Nothing happened (I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin) at first but like after a month of not washing it off after 10 minutes, my face was really dry so I stopped using it for a few weeks and now I&#x27;m using it again xD Anyway, this product does work and does clear up acne. It just takes time and it&#x27;s worth it. Oh and try leaving it on for about half an hour then wash it off if you don&#x27;t have sensitive skin and it&#x27;ll be effective.</li>
    <li> Works nicely and does not crack or inflame the skin, which is usually the downside of sulfur containing soaps or other products&lt;br /&gt;I recommend it for areas of seborrheic dermatitis outside the scalp</li>
    <li> I just got this product thus morning and used it for the first time I have faith that it will work and I&#x27;m glad it came . I will continue to use it and continue to update my results</li>
    <li> After 2 weeks of use i can see a real positive change to my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this to anyone with any type of acne.</li>
    <li> This did nothing for me.  I actually started getting more acne.  Maybe it would of come on either way, but this didn&#x27;t improve anything.</li>
    <li> My wife has been using this product for a month now and it made the acne worst on her and she complains about the nasty smell as well. She started out once a day for the 1st week and  twice a day after week one. Nothing has changed on her face and at times it looks worst.</li>
    <li> It works very quickly to shrink pimples, but it can cause skin peeling if you use it in high concentrations. It can increase skin sensitivity, so sun screen should be worn when you go outside. It tends to sit on the surface of the skin and it has a greasy consistency, but it dries over time. It has a weird smoky smell. The best time to use it is at night before you go to bed.</li>
    <li> i&#x27;ve had acne since i was 12. i&#x27;m 20 now, and it started getting a lot worse starting around a year ago. i&#x27;ve been on all types of prescription drugs, all types of over the counter face washes/lotions/toners. i really really wish i could describe how bad my skin was and how much it has improved because of this. It is a miracle...or something very close to it. my acne is 80% gone after about 2 months of use. also, if you have an oily complexion, it works for that too.&lt;br /&gt;as far as application, i usually wash my face with a non-acne mild cleanser, like the olay mild cleanser that comes in a blue pump bottle. then i put this on my acne spots and really oily parts of my face. do not put it where your skin is dry. for me, thats like within a half inch of my mouth. i keep it on for however long i want... usually anywhere from 30-90 minutes. i know, huge range. and then i rinse it off with luke warm water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;yah, you might be skeptical that something so cheap will do wonders to your skin. but it is by far one of the best purchases i have ever made. PLEASE take a leap of faith and give this a try. you won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
    <li> This stuff is really great at calming redness and helping to prevent new breakouts while encouraging the existing ones to heal. I have no idea why some users are leaving it on all day or night. It&#x27;s not meant for that and will cause excessive dryness if over used. I recommend using it once a day for 10-15 mins max. I use it every few days as my skin is very sensitive. Sulfur is a drying agent and will cause drying and peeling of the skin. So watch your skin and adjust accordingly. Also, If you want to use a leave on sulfur treatment I would buy some pure sulfur powder and apply a tiny bit to a blemish under makeup. That way your aren&#x27;t leaving a goopy PG mess on your skin and your skin has a chance to breath. A tiny bit of powder is all that&#x27;s needed. A good sulfur powder that I like to use as a spot treatment is Humco Sulfur Powder Sublimed in 4oz. you can get it on Amazon too for a low price. Last thing, sulfur is a purging agent so it will draw impurities to the surface quickly. So if it appears that you are breaking out more, the sulfur is doing it&#x27;s job by getting rid of the &#x27;festering&#x27; going on in the pores.</li>
    <li> I use it in the evening like twice a week and then use olive oil to prevent my face from drying up. Works great.</li>
    <li> I used this for the first night last night. I left it on for 10 minutes. I woke this morning and I seen a few of my recent acne scars have dramatically faded. My pores were a lot smaller and tighter and the blackheads on my nose were gone. I couldn&#x27;t believe it I had to look twice in the mirror and this is after just ONE use. This is an amazing product, I had to write a review. The only down side is it can be a bit drying on your skin so use cautiously!</li>
    <li> Very good and effective product. Pimples goes away just in first use. Recommended to every one, Very useful and excellent product</li>
    <li> Amazing stuff, I&#x27;ve tried a lot of acne products and this is by far the best. I put a dab on whatever&#x27;s developing with a small circular bandaid over top overnight and by morning it&#x27;s gone. I was worried about the smell from other reviews but it&#x27;s not bad.</li>
    <li> I have suffered from acne ever since I was in middle school, so I have tried many products to help combat the pesky little zits that like to inhabit my face. I came across this ointment on Amazon and thought I&#x27;d give it a try since it&#x27;s so cheap. The good news? It does dry up pimples and cysts within a few days. The bad news? It is extremely drying on your face, and makes the outermost layers of your skin peel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave it 4 stars, however, because it does such a good job of drying up those annoying cysts that won&#x27;t go away. The label also does warn that the ointment may be drying to your skin, so it was to be expected. I&#x27;d suggest using it every other day until your face gets used to it, and to use a moisturizer after the pimple has cleared up so your skin can re balance itself. It works a lot quicker than benzyl peroxide products and is much cheaper, so I definitely recommend that any acne sufferers give this a whirl!</li>
    <li> This was good and helped m relieve any issues that I was having A +... An all around good buy</li>
    <li> Works Great For Acne &amp; Acne Scars. Yes it does kind of stink like boiled eggs &amp; or like a burn smell or  like lie perm/relaxer. Anyway Here is directions on how I used it.&lt;br /&gt;1.)You put it on in the morning for 10 minutes &amp; then you wash it off with warm water &amp; then apply a moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;2.)&amp; then you put it on at night also for 10 minutes before bed &amp; then you wash it off with warm water &amp; then apply moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;Optional: Now I use a sulfur soap after I rinse the sulfur ointment off &amp; it was cheap &amp; I bought it at the same time I purchased this sulfur ointment here on Amazon. You can find the sulfur bar soap that I use here at this link Grisi Sulfur Soap with Lanolin for Acne - 2 Pack &amp; it is only $8.61 for two bars of this soap &amp; it last for ever.&lt;br /&gt;Optional also I use sometimes Raw Organic Honey as soap to wash my face after using the Sulfur Ointment &amp; you will be surprised how good the honey works also just to wash the face with. But when I wash with the honey, I leave on for 15 minutes or 30 minutes &amp; then I wash it off. What ever works for you. You can also buy the Honey here on Amazon at this link here: Y.S. Eco Bee Farms Raw Honey - 22 oz .&lt;br /&gt;Now you do not have to use the honey, This is just another option that is healthy to clean your face after you use the sulfur ointment. Anyway I hope this information helps.</li>
    <li> I usually don&#x27;t write reviews on products, because honestly I am too lazy. I love to read them though when I am making a decision about what to buy. However, I had to write something about this because if it helps another person to finally get their acne under control then it is worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I LOVE this product. I am 32 and have been suffering with acne since I was a teen. Not horrible, but definitely something I am self conscious about especially as I get older. My skin is also pretty sensitive so I have to be careful when I try new products because half the time I will breakout even more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not with this. I literally just got it yesterday and have already noticed a difference. I just put it on my blemishes, not my whole face. The directions say to wash it off in 10 mins, but I didn&#x27;t and my skin didn&#x27;t dry out or get irritated. Plus, the redness is almost gone and the actual blemish is almost gone too. Did I mention I just used it yesterday??&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the price, this is the best bang for your buck that you can get. It will last you a long, long time. I am so happy I finally found something that doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin and is super inexpensive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you to all who posted reviews as I wouldn&#x27;t have found Pomada De Azufre without them!</li>
    <li> We are using this for warts, psoriasis, and skin tags on family members and for body warts on our SENIOR DOGS, and have been surprised with how well it&#x27;s working by applying it just 2-3 days per week.  An holistic web site suggested mixing it with THUJA extract, so I did -- using a tablespoon of the cream mixed with 6 drops of the thuja.  I don&#x27;t know whether or not the thuja is actually a necessary ingredient to obtain the same results. but if using the cream alone does not do the job for you, you may want to try adding the herb to it.  We will definitely repurchase the product as we run out.</li>
    <li> While in the beginning I had assumed this would get rid of all my acne problems, it got rid of some . . . sorta. Personally this probably would have worked if I had moderate acne, but with moderately severe cystic acne, it didn&#x27;t do much. I have an already oily face, so sometimes this would help to dry it out.Other times it wouldn&#x27;t do a thing.</li>
    <li> I wish it didn&#x27;t have fragrance added.  Also,  I think it must have some water or other liquid in the ingredients to mix with the polyethylene glycol and sulfur but it doesn&#x27;t say it does.  I bought some &amp;#34;Miralax&amp;#34;  which is pure polyethylene glycol, mixed in some sulfur powder and water and made my own ointment without fragrance.</li>
    <li> This stuff does not work at all, it is like a cold compress to a dead man, no change in zits, pimples, whatsoever.</li>
    <li> I used this sulfur cream on a couple of blemishes and blackheads, twice a day and literally within one use I could tell a difference. It does smell kind of funny, like any sulfur product will, but the smell doesn&#x27;t linger on your skin after you wash it off. The consistency is kind of like a thick hand cream and then once you put it on your face it melts from the warmth of your skin. It doesn&#x27;t become runny and slide everywhere though. I am very pleased with this product and still use it twice a day! Some people might get dried out from it as it says on the jar, but it worked well with my blemish prone combination skin.</li>
    <li> My skin has broken out off and on throughout my adult years. It was absolutely hormone-related, which I hoped would clear up completely when I was a &amp;#34;grown up.&amp;#34; I&#x27;m 35 now, and in the past two years I began getting the painful cystic type of acne along my jawline. Hormonal acne didn&#x27;t seem to have a quick fix, and I tried everything topical, as well as oral vitamins and probiotics. Proactiv was helpful in some ways, but I realized it was mostly because it exfoliated my skin and cleaned my pores. I like having small pores and a glowing complexion, of course, but I was still getting the cystic acne monthly, and Proactiv is harsh and their auto shipping and billing is obnoxious! I have always known sulfur-based acne products have worked on my skin. The Proactiv mask was one of my favorite products, and Mario Badescu&#x27;s healing lotion has been a great spot treatment for me (but a bit harsh).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Knowing that sulfur was effective in treating adult acne, and hormonal acne, I searched Amazon for sulfur acne products that might just be that miracle that I was wishing existed for my skin... I am so glad I ordered De La Cruz Sulfur Ointment! 1. It was so cheap I thought it was worth a shot! 2. After the extensive research I have conducted, the ingredients seemed to make sense for acne treatment. 3. Um... It was under eight dollars!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do read the reviews, but I am judicious in forming my own opinion. I believed the positive reviews seemed more detailed and the explanations were clearly thought out. The negative reviews often talked about teens or people who maybe didn&#x27;t follow the directions exactly as stated, or sulfur just wasn&#x27;t the best ingredient for their treatment. Everyone is different, and I know from experience that typical ingredients alone, like salicylic acid, don&#x27;t work for me. When I first got this product I did not read the directions and used it as a spot treatment at night, not rinsing it off. So... That will m ake your skin peel andturn red like crazy! Hey, I didn&#x27;t mind getting some exfoliation going on my face, but it was very peely and very red! I read the directions, (duh), and started using it for 10 minutes at a time, cleansing with Cetaphil after the 10 minutes were up. I sometimes use it twice a day now. Listen, people: For the first time since I was quite young, I can leave my house with no makeup at all, even when my hormones should be reeking havoc on my face, and my skin looks clear, my pores are clean and tiny, and my skin tone is pretty darn even considering the acne scarring I have on my chin area from picking at my skin when I was too young to know better (don&#x27;t do it, kids!). I don&#x27;t need concealer, I can use a tinted moisturizer if I want to even out my complexion, and not foundation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this since late November, and I am just now getting close to needing to reorder. I do get a few blemishes, however they are not deep and painful and come to the surface so easily and disappear quickly. I say you should give this a shot, since you really only have about eight bucks to lose! I am so glad I took a chance on an unknown product that just seemed way too affordable to actually work on my skin!</li>
    <li> this cream helps bruises to fade, so if you are in an abusive relationship, put a little of this on your bruises and get the heck out of there.</li>
    <li> Okay, despite the bad reviews mixed in, I wanted to give this stuff a shot. Sulfur is really good for dealing with breakouts, and I was hoping that maybe this would be a step up from the mask I use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After very long debate, I ordered this and it arrived just in time to be tested at the tail end of my... hormonal time of the month. I had one large pimple, and this was effective at drying it out. The rest is pretty bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I applied it to the pimple, I also applied it to the area surrounding it. It shrank the size of the pimple I had, but cause a PAINFUL red lump under the skin next to it. I also applied this to a tiny white head in a different location. In theory it was so small I could have just scratched off with my nail if I were so inclined. Very tiny. It, too, turned very red, very painful, and inflamed to more than twice the original size!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This can&#x27;t be. I applied more to the red lump it caused, just to see, trying to give it the benefit of the doubt, and it went down. At that point, I&#x27;m kind of like... well maybe I shouldn&#x27;t give up just yet. Some days later,  I applied it just to an area prone to clogged pores. (Oh, I&#x27;m a daredevil.) Yet again, I ended up with a large, painful red lump under my skin. Only this time, the sulfur ointment did nothing to decrease the size, but instead made it bigger when I used it again!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m glad that some people have found this useful, but it&#x27;s a bust for me. I was skeptical with this being in grease form, but took the risk. Now I know I wasn&#x27;t missing anything good! If you do try this, the grittiness isn&#x27;t *that* bad. It&#x27;s sort of like A&amp;D ointment with a little baking soda mixed in as far as texture is concerned. I also wouldn&#x27;t recommend smearing this over large areas of skin until you know if you can tolerate it. The smell wasn&#x27;t too bad. If you&#x27;re used to cleaning silver with a vinegar and baking soda solution, it&#x27;s no where near that strong in odor. The scent is tolerable, and even though it&#x27;s a small container, you don&#x27;t need to use much of it for spot treatments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For me, personally, the terrible side effects outweigh the minimal usefulness.</li>
    <li> Bought something like this before- it worked really well- not sure about this. Didn&#x27;t seem to do much</li>
    <li> i mix this with 85% lactic acid a few drops, leave on for 45 min, rinse with warm water, do this once to twice a day, acne 90% improved and heals faster, also apply dragons blood, kind from so. america, to pimples, dries and heals</li>
    <li> I have polycystic ovary syndrome which comes with awesome adult acne. I used to use proactivs spot treatment stuff which had sulfer as the main ingredient and since that&#x27;s hard to find without the expensive monthly subscription I decided to try this. I figured it was worth the risk for $8. I LOVE it. I used proactivs as a spot treatment and left it on overnight but this doesn&#x27;t dry so that&#x27;s not an option. I use this all over a couple of times a week, for 10 minutes before I shower and wash it off. Its working SO well. Its a bit like sulfer scented butter on your face but it works and doesn&#x27;t cause any irritation what so ever.</li>
    <li> this has been pretty consistent in helping reduce and treat acne.  It has just a bit of a smell  and can dry a bit  but over all this has done better than other treatments.</li>
    <li> i think i honestly left this on longer than 10 mins my first time BAD MOVE! i was broken out in the spots where i left it on, they eventually went away and didn&#x27;t leave any marks so now i know to follow directions with this stuff. and other than acne my face normally is NOT that sensitive so this stuff MUST be strong. good investment tho, just gotta figure out how to implement this into my facial regiment.</li>
    <li> Best acne treatment ever!!!!!!!! If you have a stubborn pimple apply it and leave it overnight and wash in morning and it will dry it out! Will buy again!</li>
    <li> I hated this stuff! It is very greasy and sticky feeling on your skin. The longer it is on your face, the more greasy it feels. I can&#x27;t see it worked at all; definitely doesn&#x27;t work as it was intended. I would NOT recommend this at all.</li>
    <li> It works better than any other prescribed expensive chemicals products that your dermatologist is telling you about. Cheaper too. And yes, i&#x27;ve been struggling with acne for almost one year now. It doesn&#x27;t smell bad, i had no skin reaction ( don&#x27;t keep it on your face for longer than 15 mins ) and it works. I still have acne , is not going to do miracles in 3 days, i&#x27;m in my second month now and yes it looks better. Also, as a tip, swallow 7-8 Vitamin B5 per day and it should work. Give yourself time , and with most treatments do expect to get a little worse before it gets better specially after the first week.&lt;br /&gt;Best tip : stop popping your pimples. You are actually pushing the bacteria deeper. And you get scars.</li>
    <li> i was really excited about receiving this item in the mail.  a few days later i received a \\&quot;christmas pickle\\&quot; from this company in the mail and i thought that my order was coming soon.  but it never did. wth</li>
    <li> Acne when I was young, now Rosacea that I&#x27;m middle aged. Expensive soaps and ointments from dermatologists had helped, but nothing has EVER worked as well as this 8 dollar jar of miracles. My rosacea is almost completely resolved after two weeks. I leave it on all day  after I apply in the morning. No pealing or dryness just clear skin. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> bought for my daughter and this product is helping to clear her acne</li>
    <li> I used to live in a place where there was a very big water deposit where the water had all these chemicals in it, all natural, so I used to go swim and after a long time in the water, I would notice my skin get a very white tone, also dry, but what I liked the most is that if I had any bump on my face, the water would just get rid of them, well, these cream those the same, it makes my skin soft, clean and will just smell like that water back when I was a kid.</li>
    <li> Please please PLEASE purchase this item if you suffer from painful cystic acne. I have PCOS and this is the only ointment that has ever actually done something OVERNIGHT. I began my routine with following the directions on the jar (leaving it on for ten minutes, then washing it off). Now, I put a very thin layer on the bump and leave it on overnight. I have not experienced any &amp;#34;purging&amp;#34;. I have, however, experienced dryness in the areas of application.&lt;br /&gt;AM Routine: Splash face with water, HealthyWiser Vitamin C serum, Josie Maran sunscreen.&lt;br /&gt;PM routine: Cerave hydrating cleanser with a few drops of Nutiva Organic Hemp Oil, De La Cruz Sulfur Ointment Cream, Josie Maran sunscreen on dry spots.&lt;br /&gt;I have also begun taking Fish Oil and Zinc Picolinate Capsules. DOOOO ITTTTTTT!! My face is clearing up!</li>
    <li> Works exactly as advertised. Cleans and opens pores, but you do need to follow up with a really good moisturizer..</li>
    <li> As good as the prescription sulfa meds from the dermatologist</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m really loving this product.  I used to use the ProActiv 6% sulfur mask; I&#x27;d put it on at night and hope the zits were gone in the morning.  I actually like this one better.  It&#x27;s 10% sulfur, but it also has only 3 ingredients in it, as compared to the dozens in the ProActiv.  But mostly, I love how it makes those little not-quite-there-yet-but-coming blemishes dry out and go away instead of drawing them to a big red, ugly head... which, for me, often then turn into a scab/scar I&#x27;ve got to use scar treatment on for the next few months.  At first I tried wearing this at night, while I slept, but it made my skin dry and flakey in those areas.  So, now I put it on for a couple hours in the evening, then wash my face and do my nightly routine before bed, and the blemishes will be gone in the morning.  This really does the trick.  It doesn&#x27;t look like it when you first take the cream off, but come morning... the blemishes are gone.  Love it.</li>
    <li> Smells bad but that&#x27;s expected. I didn&#x27;t notice any drastic results. Certainly won&#x27;t buy again.</li>
    <li> This stuff is truly amazing, I am 50 yrs old and have suffered and fought acne since I was 12, the damage acne can do emotionally and to your self esteem is devastating! so to think this tiny inexpensive jar of cream would work seemed actually seemed silly..... But thank God I tried it! It works!!!!!It is very drying especially for mature skin so I use it every other night applied with my moisturizer as others have suggested and it has been wonderful! What I had been fighting lately was the whiteheads that would not go away no matter how well I washed and exfoliated or what I used, so I would  be compelled to squeeze (Yuck! I know) and usually would make it worse! I have been using this for two weeks and almost all of it is gone WOW!&lt;br /&gt;All this is wonderfully awesome fantastic news, so what&#x27;s the catch your wondering, there is one that I hate to even mention because this is truly a wonderful product, but please remove your jewelry when applying,I don&#x27;t know about gold, but sulphur will absolutely ruin sterling sIiver so just make sure and remove your rings first, but do not hesitate to order!</li>
    <li> Great product! My son used this product for two weeks and his acne is starting to clear up!! What a cheap alternative</li>
    <li> It smells horrible, and doesn&#x27;t work as expected. I&#x27;ve seen nearly no difference in my skin after using this product. If I wipe the product off my face and onto a towel, it makes my whole bathroom smell.</li>
    <li> Gracias lo recibí en tiempo y estaba en perfectas condiciones. Estaré pendiente en el futuro de Uds. Cuando decida comprar algo de nuevo.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure whether this works or not. Also, the directions need to be clearer! I had to look for a while that you only keep this on for a couple minutes. Likewise, it has a pretty bad smell, and it stays on my towel. Hasn&#x27;t prevent all my acne but definitely hasn&#x27;t made it worse.</li>
    <li> Be aware this will dry your skin out substantially.  Works OK.</li>
    <li> I knew this is described as an ointment but I thought since it&#x27;s for acne it would not be oily. But I was wrong. Because of the ointment texture I can&#x27;t wear makeup over this. There are sulfur based products out there that are not formulated as an ointment and I&#x27;m better off using those.</li>
    <li> Ive used other sulfer products that I loved but this one is way to greasy feeling</li>
    <li> I had a cystic type pimple on the area between my nose and lips. Awesome.  It was a very large bump that just sat there for a over a week, doing nothing, and was so deep under the skin that I couldn&#x27;t pop it.  I tried steaming it, heating it (Zeno), using benzoyl peroxide, and to dry it out with face masks.  I even poked it with a sterilized needle.  Nothing...it just sat there, mocking me.  I came across this product while searching for a cure.  I applied just a dot of it on the area overnight for 2 days, and suddenly this morning there was finally a white head on my little friend. I popped that bad boy and it&#x27;s now a quarter of the size it was.  Hooray, progress!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t notice any smell at all with this product.  My only complaint (which isn&#x27;t even a real complaint) is that it never actually dries.  The instructions say to apply it and then remove after 10 minutes, but I left it on overnight.  For my one little spot, it wasn&#x27;t a big deal.  But the consistency is like Vaseline, so if you apply it to your whole face and go to bed, your pillow is going to be a bit sticky by morning.  I will continue using this product for my occasional pimple.</li>
    <li> I am a 31 year old African American female and I have struggled with acne since I was 12 years old.  I have always had regular breakout and have tried everything from the dermatologist to home remedies like putting toothpaste on my pimples.  I use this pomade twice a week and I use this soap [[ASIN:B002R9K9P8 Dead Sea Sulphur Soap 4.4 Oz.]]twice a day.  You will initially see some drying and if you have dry skin, you may want to use it less frequently.  I also use [[ASIN:B000ZMBSPE Aztec Secret Indian Healing Clay - 2 lbs]] and mix it with ACV twice a week.  If you use this combination for a month, your acne will be gone.  I have now decreased my usage of the pomade and the clay mask to once a week on each unless my skin happens to break out.  Great combination that will not cost you an arm and a leg.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t have acne, I just needed to clean up my pores on my nose and chin, well this product did the job.!! A little goes a long way, it smells but it&#x27;s not that bad. My pores are clean and my face is fresh.</li>
    <li> Did not work for me at all. It smells bad and it feels sticky on the skin.</li>
    <li> Make sure to clean your skin well, and leave on 10 minutes, then rinse. This is my 3rd jar. Will keep buying.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve found this product very helpful for under the surface pimples (not really white heads or blackheads) that have trouble going away on their own. I use retin-a, so I am often worried about spot-treatments that dry out my &amp;#34;already&amp;#34; sensitive skin, and this did not do that! The pimple won&#x27;t fade instantly, but it will help the process without over-drying out the area. Additionally, if you feel a pimple coming up and use this it is good at preventing it from becoming a full-blown zit.</li>
    <li> This is the worst acne product I have ever used and basically causes me to breakout more.</li>
    <li> Did not cure my acne, but did get rid of every piece of black/white heads. Smell might linger around, but other people won&#x27;t notice it.</li>
    <li> Put this on each spot nightly, *and* during the day whenever you think about it (or at least 5 times.) It will reduce the pimple  dramatically and reduce the tenderness within 12 hours. Especially useful for the cystic (deep) acne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is thicker and oilier than Murad&#x27;s little tube of Sulfur cream ([[ASIN:B00110DWCQ Murad by Murad: MURAD ACNE SPOT TREATMENT--/0.5OZ]]), but it costs way less and it works. If you want a version that will not be so obvious during the day, and is portable, use the Murad Spot Treatment. This stuff is magic on pimples.</li>
    <li> This did nothing but make my face smell like feet. Don&#x27;t waste your money</li>
    <li> This is an oily cream which although it says it doesn&#x27;t clog pores, actually made my skin break out worse. An awful product.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. buying a second for my dogs AND myself.</li>
    <li> Makes your eyes dry out and puff up :(</li>
    <li> I got this hoping that it would be the wonderful stuff all the other reviews were raving about and it just did not work for me. I used it every night for almost a month and didn&#x27;t see and results. My acne didn&#x27;t go away, pimples didn&#x27;t seem to heal any faster than normal. I just stopped using it. The smell isn&#x27;t too bad for me, but the fumes did irritated my eyes a bit, so if you have sensitive eyes careful for that.</li>
    <li> As described, would not want to use by itself.</li>
    <li> It works well.  My daughter loves it.</li>
    <li> It works great, I&#x27;ve seen more breakouts dice I started using it, but I must be in the purification stage haha, my skin is so soft after I use it. I&#x27;m giving it a 4 because the smell is just awful.</li>
    <li> if you have any kind of zit or pimple and you need to bring it to the surface, this is what you need.  It has a pleasant smell and yo only need a small amount.</li>
    <li> Um dont fall for the 5 star reviews. It doesn&#x27;t work as they say.gives your skin a burning feeling and not much great results after a couple of weeks. You have to wash your face 2 times, total of 4 times a day. once before putting it then washing it off after 10 mins.THE SMELL OF SULFUR WILL STAY IN YOUR SKIN and if people go by you they can smell it. not worth you money.</li>
    <li> I have had adult cystic acne for years &amp; I currently have 2 large, hard cysts on my face.  They have been there since February!  I&#x27;ve tried everything:  retina-A, differing, prescription antibiotics, tea tree and other oils, glycolix and a variety of very expensive over the counter treatments.  The result was over-drying of my sensitive, mature (age 58) skin.  The area would scab, peel, and fill again with the infection, repeat.  I felt I just looked awful with these cysts on my face; no amount of careful application of cosmetics could hide it; in fact it made it look worse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I put a very small dab of this sulfur ointment and I saw an improvement overnight!  I have used it for about 2 weeks now and the cysts have almost completely disappeared!  I am thrilled! I can now apply cosmetics and my complexion looks beautiful.  I feel and look better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I want to stress that I use an extremely small amount:  I lightly dip the end of a q-tip in the ointment and rub it in.  Because of the small amount, I do not wash it off as I&#x27;ve read others recommend.  This has been terrific for me; I hope it will be for you, too!</li>
    <li> I been using this product for almost 2 weeks,it really works i love it.</li>
    <li> I SUFFER FROM BOUTS OF Folliculitis ABOUT EVERY 3 MONTHS. A lot of sufferers have had good results with sulfur . This being the only sulfur product i had  on hand and the fact that it is water soluble made me give it a try. Over night my irritation was gone as well as itching and it did not dry out my hair.&lt;br /&gt;Love it !</li>
    <li> This stuff is pretty miraculous. I use it at night for spot treatment on those very painful inflamed  acne and also on the stubborn ones that never seem to go away. There is a lot of product. It goes on like a salve and stays moist. I also used it on other areas of my body where I occasionally get bumps. Overnight results! Not necessarily gone (after first use) but significantly reduced.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS- overnight relief of painful or pesky zits. Does not bleach your clothes or pillow cases!! Yayy!&lt;br /&gt;CONS- stinky (like sulfur) and stays moist (sleep with a towel over your pillow to prevent transfer).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I read other reviews and instructions from seller/product  about wiping the product off after 10 minutes. ..but I did not. I don&#x27;t have any signs of dryness at all! My skin is clear and I&#x27;m still glowing (not flaky!). Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Got this in the mail today and excited to see how it works!&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a small container, but it&#x27;ll go a LONG way. I scooped out the small amount from the lid and that easily covered my whole face.&lt;br /&gt;Smell...someone described at as \\&quot;match box\\&quot; smell and I would say that&#x27;s exactly how it smells. I took a big whiff right from the container to see what it smelled like and it&#x27;s practically odorless. But once you have it on your skin, it does smell a little smokey...nothing too terrible.&lt;br /&gt;First I cleaned my face with coconut oil. (If you suffer from acne, look into the oil cleansing method, it&#x27;s great.) Although I clean my face day and night trying to combat acne, I still get hormonal acne and nothing seems to help. So for 3 weeks of the month I try to get rid of the flare ups of acne on my cheeks and chin area, and then 1 week of the month it have decently clear skin. At 28, I am sick and tired of acne at any time of the month though.&lt;br /&gt;Anyways, I followed the instructions to cleanse my face and then apply a thin layer on your skin. Leave on for 10 minutes. I actually left mine on for closer to 20 minutes. When it&#x27;s on your skin it starts to feel warm like you&#x27;re constantly blushing (anybody using it else notice this?)  I like how it just sits there on the skin working away. After 20 minutes I wiped it away with a warm cloth. I plan to do this once a day until my skin gets used to it. Hopefully this will be the answer I am looking for to help my skin.&lt;br /&gt;On a side note, when I was researching sulfur for acne, I came across an internal supplement called MSM which is another way to take sulfur and I hope it works from the inside out too :)&lt;br /&gt;Will update over the next few weeks as an ongoing review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**July 31 Update**&lt;br /&gt;I think I went overkill  on this stuff. For the first few days the acne on my cheeks just stayed as is. I expected that it would. I was glad to not get any new acne though. I applied this stuff with a moisturizer and left it on all day, doing this for about a week. Then the area on my cheeks purged and I got more acne there plus suddenly my skin began to peel (as other users described). So currently I have super dry flaky skin and the cheek acne! Technically my problem is worse! I really can&#x27;t blame the product because I was the one that didn&#x27;t follow the directions. So to new users, don&#x27;t do what I did and leave it on forever, that&#x27;s bad news!  I am trying to get my skin&#x27;s moisture level back and exfoliate the dead skin and start fresh. I will follow the directions this time and see where I end up...TBC&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***Sept 8 2012***&lt;br /&gt;Well, I&#x27;ve altogether stopped using this stuff. I think that my skin just dries out too easily and I end up breaking out because of that. Since my last update I&#x27;ve tried other methods to help with this ongoing acne battle and currently, my skin is the nicest it&#x27;s been in a while. I hope any information I can offer on what I do for my skin can be helpful for others!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) I wash my face 2x/ day with Dr. Bronners peppermint magic soap.  If you&#x27;ve noticed above I mentioned the \\&quot;oil cleansing method\\&quot;, this stuff&#x27;s first 2 ingredients are coconut oil and I believe jojoba oil. I&#x27;ve had this soap forever because I wanted to try something of the more natural route that doesn&#x27;t dry my skin. I just started using it on my face in the last week (used as hand wash before that). Prior to that I tried the cetaphil gentle acne cleanser and it too dried out my skin - another $12 wasted :(  So anyways, this Dr. bronners soap cleans my face wonderfully and my skin is not dry at all (avoid eye area, the peppermint scent burns the eyes!)&lt;br /&gt;2) WATER - My only water intake for the last 5 years has been in the form of coffee! It seems to me that people who eat healthy and drink lots of water don&#x27;t seem to have acne. I drink about 4-6 cups of water a day, and cut back to 1 coffee. You couldn&#x27;t have told me a year ago that this was possible for me to do, but I am determined to get rid of ACNE!&lt;br /&gt;3) I&#x27;ve also started taking the following supplements:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Fish Oil for skin and omega 3&#x27;s&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Wild Yam capsules - apparently this is great for balancing hormones. I thought I would give it a try since hormones are to blame for the bulk of my trouble acne. I strongly suggest reading the reviews on Wild Yam products (on etsy and amazon) if you have PMS troubles or menopause. My Mother in law uses a Wild Yam Oil cream and her hot flashes have gone away. For my own experience, I think this has helped my mood! It&#x27;s something that I will definitely continue to use and see how it helps next months round of hormonal acne&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Biotin - Another great supplement to help with hair, nails and overall health&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4) When acne appears - Dr. Oz says to poke the white head with a pin (it&#x27;s dead skin over the white head, so it doesn&#x27;t hurt) I&#x27;d never tried this before until last week. Now I don&#x27;t know why I&#x27;ve waited so long. I think when you squeeze those suckers, you&#x27;re pinching and bruising the skin and it makes the pimple look worse after and it takes a super long time to heal. So I tried this pin prick method and it makes so much more sense. First I clean a pin with alcohol and poke it right through the whitehead. A gentle squeeze will get all the junk out, then I swab the area with alcohol again - done. The zit will be gone in a day or 2 after that - the alcohol dries it out too. Sometimes I use a q-tip to dab a bit more alcohol on it until it&#x27;s gone. Lesson learned - don&#x27;t squeeze the life out of pimples!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, there&#x27;s all the tips I can offer. Good luck!</li>
    <li> I use this as directed and it seems to work.  I wish I were sure, but I&#x27;m not. It may be the product or just time that promotes the healing.  I do love the fact that it has a shelf life of- forever!</li>
    <li> Ordered this a couple months ago and the smell was sulfur but mild (as sulfur smells go). Got a new jar and the smell is overpoweringly pefumey -- like they tried to cover up sulfur smell with men&#x27;s cologne.  I can&#x27;t handle it.  I still have some left in the old jar so can do a direct comparison and the old jar has barely any fragrance compared to this new one.  Give me the natural sulfur smell over this any day.  Anyone else notice this?  This would be 5 stars without the change in smell.  Horrid.  If you know where I can get some with just the sulfur smell, let me know?  Maybe I just got a bad batch?  Hope they are t changing the recipe or something.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve struggled with hormonal acne for years. I bought this based on the good reviews, and am so happy I did. Bottom line, this stuff works!  The smell isn&#x27;t bad and it evaporates quickly after you wash it off.  If you are sick and tired of your acne, you should definitely give this a try!</li>
    <li> This is an awesome product to prevent acne and cure acne problems&lt;br /&gt;I use it faithfully&lt;br /&gt;It does cause some Drying of  the skin  even though it starts off  very oily&lt;br /&gt;I do notice some peeling after a day or two&lt;br /&gt;But I rather have a little dry  skin then broke out skin</li>
    <li> I only have the occasional break out so it might work better for someone who has lots of breakouts but I found that this didn&#x27;t work on anything.</li>
    <li> I used have beautiful skin but as started drinking alcohol,&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve got bunch of Acnes. Hate it&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve done many ways for it but nothing works.&lt;br /&gt;I used to use expensive good products for skins&lt;br /&gt;nothing worked.&lt;br /&gt;but this is, okay when I ordered this, I didnt expect anything&lt;br /&gt;and now Im using it a lot. it helps a lot like absolutely.&lt;br /&gt;everytime when I use it, i can see that it&#x27;s working really well.&lt;br /&gt;love it a lot and im gonna buy this more.</li>
    <li> An inexpensive solution to acne - dries out the acne prone areas very well.  A bit stinky - but skins smells fine after product washed off.</li>
    <li> Unbelievable , it&#x27;s a magic. I luv it. Not expensive and easy to use with quick results. I recommend it</li>
    <li> This product does what it says, but it will dry out your skin.  Also, do not get this on your clothes!  It has a terrible sulfur smell and it is very difficult to get the smell out of clothes!</li>
    <li> Works good on acne by drying out pimples, however it doesn&#x27;t do it overnight. For pimples to be totally gone, it takes about 3 days in a row of using the product. The HUGE downside of the product is the smell. It is sulfur though so you should already be prepared to smell like rotten eggs! Problem is though, it takes a few times of washing your face for the smell to be gone, and even then sometimes you still can smell it.</li>
    <li> This was way too greasy for my face. It did not dry out my acne and made me break out even more.</li>
    <li> this does nothing.&lt;br /&gt;probably makes it works</li>
    <li> I was hoping this product would be the answer to my recent ance since i always had clear skin before this year (23 years of clear skin and now 24th year I start having acne). It was absolutely not, and just as other products that advertise itself and has fake reviews.... This doesnt work. It dries my face, and leaves it blemish and uncomfortable feeling. I wouldnt recommend this. I have a balance skin, not too oily and not super dry, a lil lotion everyday is enough for me, so I am not sure why this product does not work.</li>
    <li> The product is a thick paste.  Apply a thin layer once a day and leave on for 10 minutes.  It rinses clean with water, but I follow with a Salytic Acid Scrub to help fight acne.  I&#x27;ve seen a noticable improvement in 3 weeks.  I still get a stray pimple but they are much smaller and less painful.  I use this product at night and first clean with Cetaphil bar soap. In the morning, I use Sulful Soap with Lanolin (also Amazon purchase).</li>
    <li> This product draws out impurities, and kills bacteria dead in its tracks. You only need the slightest amount to see huge results. The smell is minimal.. In my opinion it smells more like (mayo) than a harsh sulfur. I put it all over my face 15 min before I shower everyday</li>
    <li> yes, it does work and I do not care about the smell as long as this thing takes care of my pimples. But to be honest I&#x27;m not very optimistic though. After fighting acne for many years, I know that sooner or later the acne wil fight its way back to my skin. I will update this review that day.</li>
    <li> This product has the highest OTC sulfur %, so I took care in following the directions: leave on for only 10 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does have a rotten egg/sulfur smell, but who cares for 10 minutes?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does dry out blemishes, that&#x27;s for sure. It zapped up regular surface zits in a day or two and it dried out nodules and cysts within a few days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But it also dries out the skin around the blemish, so be careful in using excessively.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I suggest using it sparingly, especially if you have dry and/or sensitive skin.  Maybe once every 2-3 days.  I used it 1x a day for 3 days, and only on active blemishes, saw it was drying out the blemishes, and then upped it to 2x a day for the next few days.  My skin started to peel, so I stopped using it.  My skin peeled even centimeters away from where I had used it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because it is so drying, it even dried out the skin where I didn&#x27;t use it.  So that dry skin flaked up, clogged a couple of pores there, and I had new blemishes.  Instead of applying more of this stuff, I exfoliated with St. Ive&#x27;s for a couple of days and moisturized with Cerave and left the blemishes alone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After that experience, I applied it with a toothpick or a q-tip with the fluff taken off so the ointment only sat right on top of the pore that was clogged, and only 1x a day for 2 days. I also added a second layer of moisturizer after the 1st one soaked in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have dry/sensitive skin and cysts or nodules, I recommend using this in conjunction with Aztec Healing Clay ([[ASIN:B000ZMBSPE Aztec Secret Indian Healing Clay - 2 lbs]].&lt;br /&gt;First, use the healing clay (mixed with Apple Cider Vinegar) for a few days (1x per day) to bring the deepest clogs closer to the surface, where a topical can even access them.  Then, stop using the clay and switch to this ointment to zap what you&#x27;ve brought to the surface. After your rinse off from either of these, moisturize like hell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is my topical regimethat I have added to my search for the nodular / cystic acne cure.  Stopping the breakouts altogether meant getting tested for food allergies and hormonal imbalances.  I&#x27;ve started to clear up after being prescribed medicine for a hormonal imbalance.  I used this stuff to clear up my last breakout and the combo of correcting the inside of my body and the outside of my body meant cysts came and went in 2 days instead of weeks, leaving me now with only scars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4 stars for doing exactly what the product said it would do; not a full 5 stars because the instructions suggest using it on clear skin to prevent blemishes. -1 star as a preventive measure: I think it would dry out any skin type, causing dead flakes to clog pores, making you want to use it more, trapping you in a dry skin breakout cycle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In short, use sparingly for 10 minutes a day on top of an active blemish.</li>
    <li> The product works as advertised. I gave it a try because it had a lot of good reviews and I couldn&#x27;t be more satisfied. You won&#x27;t go wrong with this, and even if it doesn&#x27;t work for you, it only cost $7 and some change!</li>
    <li> My 16 year old daughter has suffered from acne for years.  We have tried everything over the counter and medications from the dermatologist.  The meds from the doctor we worked but we had to stop due to gastric issues the pills caused.  After two days of the ointment her skin was almost completely clear.  We are not crazy about the smell but it has worked for her.</li>
    <li> This is the only acne product that actually helps my cystic acne that I get on my chin. As soon as I feel one coming in, I slather this stuff on it and it keeps it small and gets rid of it in a couple of days. My fianc&amp;eacute; finally gave it a go and was amazed at how fast it works for him too. We both use it for any smaller zits too and pretty much makes them disappear within a day or so!</li>
    <li> This is a great product!  Within a couple of days I saw a dramatic improvement in my rosecea acne.  It had recently been getting very bad, despite my careful skin regimen and using the prescription that the doc had given me on the pimples.  As a result I was starting to get a number of scars. Now I am down to one or two visible pimples and they are much smaller than some of the huge ones I&#x27;d had before.  Also since I&#x27;ve used it every day on the worst area in the whole area (my chin) I have found that it isn&#x27;t as red and blotchy looking.</li>
    <li> works great as an acne spot treatment! doesn&#x27;t smell amazing, but it does the job. it will stain clothes...so wear something to bed you do not mind staining.</li>
    <li> I purchaed this for myself and my nephew.  We used it once a day and our faces broke out more then before.  I would not recommend this product!</li>
    <li> It is a good product, but I was looking for something different.&lt;br /&gt;it works, next time I will get the soup too.</li>
    <li> I have used prosacea for my rosacea, but that little tub only lasts me a few weeks, when used daily.  This is s great cheaper alternative.  I think it works better!  This is a thicker cream that you leave on for 10 minutes, and then rinse off.  It helps with ance and redness.</li>
    <li> This product appears to have given my skin a long term mild irritation and sensitivity. It was either this one or benzoil peroxide. Therefore, I do not recommend either or at least be extra careful. If you are going to try it, I suggest not using any masks or peels for a few days after using this. And no more than once a week.</li>
    <li> Works well if you can stand the odor.</li>
    <li> wife kept breaking out so I got this, it works, but the item irritates her skin a little bit quite a bit, so only 4 stars.</li>
    <li> does nothing to help my adult acne.  it smells something terrible, also.  i wouldn&#x27;t mind the smell if it worked for my particular issue.</li>
    <li> I am 32 and have tried every acne medicine, from OTC, to prescription, to Proactive, and nothing has worked as well as this stuff. It does go on a little greasy, I wouldn&#x27;t put it on right before my powder make up. However, I am just bowled over by how fast my acne cleared up. After three days, my skin is clearer than it has been in years.</li>
    <li> This stuff really works! I bought it for my son...he uses it quite frequently. Would recommend it to anyone acne problems.</li>
    <li> I started using this product 10 day ago with 100%&lt;br /&gt;all of the acne, blackhead and whiteheads are gone.&lt;br /&gt;I am so pleased with this purchase, will be buying again.&lt;br /&gt;The smell barely noticeable and no irritation at all.&lt;br /&gt;I will definitely be buying this product again.</li>
    <li> Like the product&#x27;s directions suggest, this ointment is not for everyone. So far, I like the way the ointment works, but I did have an instance of some irritation initially. Overall, I like this as an addition to my tools against acne.</li>
    <li> I have never taken the time to write a review on any of my purchases before, however, this one warrants one.  I have suffered with acne and the stubborn red spots it leaves behind for the last 20 years.  I have PCOS which carries with it numerous unfortunate symptoms, including relentless adult acne.  I have tried every prescription and OTC acne medication you can imagine (including Accutane) as well as every hair brained unconvential product known to urban legend, with no real success.  However, I have had the most luck with sulfer products in the past, and after reading several reviews about this one, decided to try it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also decided to invest in an Olay Pro X cleansing brush for a &amp;#34;deeper&amp;#34; clean and some exfoliating purposes.  I have used the brush and this ointment for only one week but have had amazing results.  The red cystic acne on my chin has all but healed and my old red marks are nearly gone.  I have never had this type of clearing with any of the previous products I&#x27;ve used and have experienced absolutely no excessive drying or peeling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wash my face morning and night with Noxema Bacteria Fighting cleanser and the Olay brush, and then apply this ointment.  I leave it on for ten minutes, wash it off, and apply a light moisturizer from Neutrogena.  For more exfoliation I use the exfoliating renewal cleanser that came with the Olay brush.  I&#x27;m not sure yet whether this regimen will keep all the acne away, but for the first time in decades I feel hopeful.  I know not every product works the same for everyone, but hopefully sharing my experience could help someone.</li>
    <li> This did not work for me. I have pretty bad rosacea which causes my nose to swell and get white heads. My whole face will be flushed at times. This cream made it worse. I&#x27;m not sure if the sulfur is too strong at 10% or if it is the base of the cream. Either way I had to toss this out after a few uses and triple the white heads.</li>
    <li> i have bad acne, ive used dermatologist prescribed stuff. a lot of it made my skin red and blotchy for awhile before getting rid of the acne. also the chemicals cost about $15 per little tube so i stopped buying them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i&#x27;ve used neutrogena, proactiv, clean and clear, you name it - i&#x27;ve tried em all multiple times. nothing works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;been using this stuff twice a day for about a week now, my face is NOTICEABLY clear. in spots where i&#x27;d always have 4 or 5 pimples at any given time, there&#x27;s 0. scarring is reduced, hopefully will be gone completely soon. another huge thing this stuff did was clear up the dark circles under my eyes! i don&#x27;t know if this is the same for anyone else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;face is irritated a bit 10 mins after putting it on. 30 mins in im wanting to scratch my face off its so itchy. so i recommend if you have skin like mine don&#x27;t leave it on too long unless you can handle it. also the smell is fine, not even nearly as bad as some of proactivs crap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;also haven&#x27;t noticed any damage to my clothes or hair, and its gotten into both.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;thanks to whoever came up with this ingenious ointment! its ironic the stuff that doesn&#x27;t work very well is what&#x27;s big and the stuff that works beautifully is hardly known.</li>
    <li> I recieved this item yesterday and overnight, it cleared up the two pimples on my face and the couple i had on my back. OVERNIGHT!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Shipment was very fast. Product does what it says. It really works. The only thing that I did not enjoy was the smell of the product.</li>
    <li> This stuff is nothing short of a miracle. It is such an amazing acne clearing product. It doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin and it gets rid of acne period. It doesnt smell as bad as some people say, worth the results in my opinion. And for 7 bucks? Seriously? I have found my holy grail.</li>
    <li> This is the single best product to fight breakouts, clogged pores, oily skin, and other skin problems. There are only 2 ingredients: Sulfur, and PG. I did some research on PG and despite what others say about it it&#x27;s not that bad... and considering you are only leaving it on your skin for 10 mins, it&#x27;s really not a big deal. This product is the next best thing to an expensive spa. The sulfur does wonders for problem skin and didn&#x27;t irritate or dry out my VERY sensitive, breakout/ rash prone, oily skin. I noticed right away that my skin was on the mend and those take-forever-to-go-away breakouts were starting to heal! AND it rinses clean! no residue. But note, it certainly won&#x27;t change your skin over night. It took a few weeks for my skin to be really clear. The skin needs time to \\&quot;purge\\&quot; and then heal. And this product will certainly bring blemishes to a head! Even those really deep ones that are only noticeable if you rub your finger over the skin. That deep down lump will come to a head so your skin can actually heal! I also noticed that the hyperpigmentation was starting to fade. But note, this prduct is a mask, not a moisturizer. It doesn&#x27;t dry hard or change color, but instead stays \\&quot;Vaseline like.\\&quot; Also, it&#x27;s not to be used for overnight or for extended periods of time. Follow the directions on the bottle! I started with once a day and then gradually increased to twice. It may seem like your skin gets worse at first, but give it time to work it&#x27;s \\&quot;magic.\\&quot; Gotta get those pores clean! Best wishes :)</li>
    <li> I place at least 5 to 6 orders a week with Amazon and always used the reviews as a reference. The reviews are so helpful that I felt compelled to start reviewing the products I bought...  so this is my first review :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product yesterday. I applied on my face ( only on bad pimples/cystic acne) 3 times so far ( 10 to 45 minutes at a time).... just to give you a bit of my story:  female, 38, skin was fine until I used a new skincare that left my skin with cystic acne and very much inflamed. Nothing was working on drying out the cystic acne ( I tried the most expense treatment available including IPL)....&lt;br /&gt;I am amazed but I have t admit that this product did wonders for my skin in less than 24 hours...&lt;br /&gt;So for the price- give it a try! You will need to experiment slowly and see what works for you ( application/ duration etc...).&lt;br /&gt;One more thing: It does not smell like other people are stating...its super easy to remove !&lt;br /&gt;I also use Primerose oil and B5 to treat my skin internally.&lt;br /&gt;Remember: baby steps :)&lt;br /&gt;Good luck to you!</li>
    <li> Hi all - I used this product for a while (you have to use as directed or less - I was doing 2x a day for 10 min - to prevent overdrying of skin). I was very hesitant about smearing propylene glycol all over my face. This same company makes sulfur powder - the same sulfur used in this jar. Buy that and mix it with pure honey (which is noncomedogenic - won&#x27;t clog pores) instead; all you need is a spoon. Be careful to measure 9 parts honey to 1 part sulfur and NO MORE. This would be a 10% solution. So I do 9 spoonfuls of manuka honey and 1 spoonful of the sulfur, mix it with a spoon, and use it 2x a day for 10-15 minutes. It&#x27;s easier to apply when your face is a little wet. It is less drying and my skin feels wonderful. The honey is antibacterial so you have an added treatment on your face, and best is it can sit in your cabinet because the honey prevents bacterial growth. It&#x27;s awesome, safe and my skin isn&#x27;t dry and flaky from the sulfur like it was before. &#x3D;)</li>
    <li> I have used two jars of this product for an hour or so each night. Not even the slightest bit of difference in my skin. No drying occured and i have normal to dry skin. I eat a clean diet and treat my skin with respect yet I still have terrible adult acne. I had such hopes for this product. I just purchased NOW brand sulfur pills and Proactive Sulfur mask in hopes they will help. I used the Proactive mask for the first time tonight and it felt much more cleansing than this product did.</li>
    <li> Before using this ointment, I literally had tried EVERY over-the-counter acne treatment. All of them. I&#x27;ve also tried all the expensive Rx creams, meds, even Accutane, birth control pills. I just could not find a safe and effective solution for my stubborn, cystic acne around my jawline/chin area until I picked up a jar of this ointment. I noticed a difference in 2 uses. My skin glowed and looked fresh, and my pimples had all reduced in size and redness. Since my skin is already used to harsh creams, I leave the mask on for close to an hour, and the results are unbelievable. I also use it as spot treatment overnight, and by morning everything is half the size. This product is a blessing.</li>
    <li> I love the way it smells and it really work great</li>
    <li> Keeps my skin looking clear, slight smell, not offensive.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work. May work for some, but not me. Use Tea Tree essential oil. It works better than this stuff.</li>
    <li> Great product, works well, feels a little gooey when first put it on but it absorbs quickly.</li>
    <li> After reading so many positive reviews on this product, I had to try it! I was in desperate need to find something that would clear up my cystic acne, which was getting worse and worse each day. It was to the point that I could no longer apply makeup without my skin burning, it go so bad. After a few uses of this product I began to see a difference in my skin. The swelling and redness from my insane breakout had gone down after a few days. I&#x27;ve been using this product for about a month and a half or so now and still have the occasional bumps but it makes such a difference when I use this stuff, I feel like the bumps go away faster therefore smoothing out my skin. I DO recommend using a good moisturizer and toner with this product as well, because it will dry out your skin a bit. ALSO I tend to leave it on longer then the suggested 10 minutes, I&#x27;ll leave it on for about an hour, wash it off, then go to sleep. You see a difference in the morning!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know if it was because I had cystic acne or what but this stuff didn&#x27;t do anything but smell. Very disappointed. but it might work for someone else. Good luck.</li>
    <li> This product works just as well as any prescription for the same thing, but lots cheaper.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried LOTS of stuff: lemons, honey, apple cider vinegar, bentonite clay masks, Benzoyl peroxide products, salicylic acid products, hydrogen peroxide, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is bar none the most effective topical treatment I have ever tried. I put it on ever night for as long as I can before it gets too itchy, usually around an hour, then rinse it off with water. The only downside (And it is a big one) is that it stinks. It kind of smells like rotten eggs, but not quite as offensive. It is totally worth it though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also forgot to mention that this stuff is cheap as heck too. 6/5 stars.</li>
    <li> My  troubled skin improved with this cream. The texture is grainey and that helped with the dermabrasion which smoothed my skin and the sulfur treated the skin bacteria.  I will purchase this product again.</li>
    <li> I was really excited to try this product hoping my face and body acne would go away. I have the occasional bad/hormonal breakout but I always have a couple pimples that never go away.&lt;br /&gt;First off I used this for a week straight when I got it and it didn&#x27;t do anything. It didn&#x27;t even dry out my face when my normal acne cleanser still did. So maybe I was doing something wrong but I followed the directions so I don&#x27;t see why it would be a problem.&lt;br /&gt;My body acne had a better reaction. After leaving it on for a whole night or a few hours my body acne reduced in size or was gone.&lt;br /&gt;The smell also tends to linger so make sure you wash it off really good.</li>
    <li> This product has a peeling effect on my skin. I have many pimples and acne, so it has been helpful. But it&#x27;s been only two weeks since I started using, so it&#x27;s to early to give a final evaluation. I dind&#x27;t realize that the product was so small, I thought it&#x27;s was bigger by seeing the picture.</li>
    <li> I suffer from minor occasional acne breakouts, but who has time, or tolerance for those? Anyway, the first time I used this product on a few breakouts the next day they were just about all gone! I&#x27;ve not used anything that has even come close to this product in terms of being gentle on the skin as well as powerful on acne. I&#x27;ve been using it for a week now, every night for ten minuets and have had NO breakouts! As in NONE! Where was this product ten years ago? Only down side- it is an extremely small container, so if you love it, be prepared to order more. Also, it does have a strong sulfur smell, so a shower after use is advised. I use this in combination with Aztec Indian Clay and my face is completely clear. Can&#x27;t say enough good about this product... love, love, love it! One of the best purchases I&#x27;ve ever made and I will be a life customer.</li>
    <li> I bought this thinking it would be really good since I read a lot of reviews saying this is the best acne cure. I have oily to combination skin and is a bit sensitive, when I broke out with cystic acne and pimples I used it as instructed on the instructions and after 5 minutes into the mask my face had a burning sensation, I was wondering if this is how it works but I don&#x27;t think so I left it on still thinking this is how this works. My face was a bit red after washing this off my face. The cystic acne went down a bit, and pimples were okay I saw no difference in them. I think I&#x27;m going to use this like every week maybe this is how it works. I also even tried wearing it over night, I read someone wrote. My face still had the burning sensation and I could not sleep so I ended up washing it off. That is why I am giving a 3 stars instead of a 5.</li>
    <li> Broke out all over my face. Did not help me. Maybe just not for my skin. Sort of gross too</li>
    <li> Bought this after seeing some YouTube videos and how it can transform your skin in a few days.&lt;br /&gt;Works Great! it IS drying, but thats the point. Not for very sensitive skin, some peeling may occur.</li>
    <li> My wife loves this stuff, it makes her skin look so good. If you married an ogre, this might help..., hahah!</li>
    <li> I purchased this product NOT for the purported acne benefits but to determine if it would help with my Tinea Versicolor on my face.  After about 2 months I can&#x27;t say that it is doing a lot for my skin condition BUT it DEFINITELY has significantly erased the fine lines (crow&#x27;s feet) around my eyes.  I will DEFINITELY repurchase this product for this purpose only.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Initially I used this product everyday for 10 minutes per application, but it is a very strong (drying) product so I switched to 3 times per week for 10 minutes. Anything longer than that and it would make my skin to feel super dry and then flake.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t see any benefits to the very minimal acne that I have (3-4 pimples strategically on my face) so I can&#x27;t give it any positives for that.  But it DEFINITELY has reduced the crow&#x27;s feet around my eyes.  It&#x27;s like it softens it and then kinda erases it.  Weird but that is the best that I can describe it.  Hope this helps someone.</li>
    <li> Listen,&lt;br /&gt;I never write reviews.....however, i was suffering from scabies for 7 months!!!!! there was nothing i could do to get rid of it.  i tried every ointment and prescription out there.  i tried every home remedy there was.  then i used this for 3 days and the itch was gone; GONE!  don&#x27;t bother trying anything else, this is the cure.  if i could help just one person with this review, i will be exceptionally happy!  the CDC recommends bathing at night and while your skin is still warm from the shower, lather sulfur ointment from the neck down and leave it on for 24 hours.  do this 3 days in a row. (please look this up, it is on the internet) it is THE ONLY THING THAT WORKS.  in addition, do not wear clothes more than once, and wash your sheets after 1 week.  you may continue to itch for 2 weeks; this is called post scabies, and you will see that the itch eventually improves.  the one thing i do want to stress is that your clothing, sheets, washer and dryer will smell bad. just put pine-sol in the bleach cycle, and that will take care of it. please don&#x27;t let yourself suffer anymore....this stuff is worth it&#x27;s weight in gold.</li>
    <li> I really enjoyed this product. I suffer (yes, suffer indeed) from severe cystic acne, and this product is my relief in a bottle. While it won&#x27;t completely cure your acne, it will dramatically reduce the redness, and swelling. It causes your skin to peel a lot, so be sure to moisturize very well afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s important you use this correctly to achieve these results. You *SHOULD NOT* leave this on all over your face overnight as a lot of people are doing, it is very thick, and can possibly clog your pores making your skin problems worse. Apply a thin layer over your entire face, leave it on 10-20 minutes, and rinse well. It has similar bleaching properties like benzoyl peroxide so be sure you sleep with a white pillow case.</li>
    <li> Oily, smelly, hard to wash out, didn&#x27;t work for me. Didn&#x27;t make things worse though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried it for a little for my acne and it did not help at all. When I was buying this i was expecting the sulfur cream that came with the old Proactiv packages which dried up my acne. This did not do that but only felt like I was putting grease on my face.</li>
    <li> Used it for about 3 weeks, wasnt helping so just stopped using it. Also it stinks and if it gets in your mouth it taste horrible!</li>
    <li> Like many of the other one star reviews, this product didn&#x27;t work at all for me. I bought three jars of it to use up my end of year FSA. After using it for several weeks on acne on the back of my neck, it had virtually no effect. It feels oily and slimy going on, and doesn&#x27;t have any of the tingling sensation that other acne medications do. From all the great reviews though, apparently it seems to work for a lot of people.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never been compelled to review anything on Amazon (though I love to consult others&#x27; reviews before I buy products). I felt like I *wanted* to review this product because I&#x27;m so happy with the results. It cleared up my acne when everything else I tried from the drugstore and department store brands didn&#x27;t. It took about a month of daily applications, and it did cause some dryness and flaking as it removed layers of skin. But that&#x27;s what it&#x27;s designed to do. It gets your skin to slough off and regenerate at a faster rate--the way I suppose other things like alpha hydroxy creams are supposed to do but didn&#x27;t for me. My skin hasn&#x27;t looked this great in two years, and before this I&#x27;d been trying different stuff--even with the help of my doctor without success. I could see immediate and gradual improvement, but it did take several weeks to fully work. The odor is present, but not overpowering. My husband agreed the smell wasn&#x27;t so strong. I did leave the product on for longer than the ten minutes recommended on the package--sometimes leaving it on for hours. For the price (I spent about 7 bucks), it&#x27;s worth giving it a try.</li>
    <li> I dont know if this product is working or not. Smells funky and leaves your skin smelling funky as well after washing.</li>
    <li> good but strong smell</li>
    <li> It is basically a product, like benzyl peroxide which dries out the erruptions, not a miracle but helpful.</li>
    <li> I have struggled with acne my entire life. I refuse to use Accutane. Now in my 40s I have tried everything and anything  I highly recommend this product I use it along with Acnomel Adult Acne Medicated Cream. I started out using it twice a day . I had very dry and flaky skin. I cut down to once a day and worked back up to twice again. Took about a week and my skin evened out.  I used moisturizer and a dab of Olive Oil each time. Whatever you do don&#x27;t  give up.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been fighting a (mostly losing, sometimes winning) battle with my skin for almost fifteen years now(BTW, no one ever tells you about the late twenties hormonal acne that is the WORST!!).  So, I have breakouts and blackheads, and lately, back, chest, and neck breakouts.  NOTHING worked on these.  I tried Retin-A, and Cleasin-T (clindomyacin) and they helped, but I was still finding new breakouts almost every day.  This stuff is amazing.  I put it on after I shower at night and leave it on (supposed to rinse, but I am impatient) all night, and everything has cleared up completely.  I think it may draw everything to the surface, so right after I started I had some new pimples come up, but they were gone within a day or so.  My chest is completely clear, as is my neck (hallelujah!!) and my back is almost completely clear (and it was terrible).  The product can be drying, I had peeling everywhere I used it, but I just exfoliated and kept on going and my skin looks great!  I think the peeling was even helpful, as I noticed some red marks are much faded and my skin is soft and smooth now!  This is a great product, but not for the faint of heart.  It&#x27;s smelly and sticky and takes forever to dry.  It also tarnishes silver.  So, if you have silver jewelry, keep it far away from this product and you after use of this product.  But, let&#x27;s face it, by the time you&#x27;re putting sulphur on your skin, you are probably at a place where you don&#x27;t care about the smell or the sticky as long as it WORKS.  And this product does. I&#x27;m ordering my third jar today!!</li>
    <li> I bought something like this when I was in Turkey. When I ran out of supply I found this product on line. It seems to be very effective for me.</li>
    <li> This stuff WORKS. I am a 27 year old mother who has struggled with awful acne for about ten years now. This sulfur treatment combined with some healthy eating has dramatically helped my acne! Try it! It has helped way way more than all of the HuNDREdS of other products I have tried!</li>
    <li> Used sulfur ointment for years.  A good product.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know what everyone is raving about - I got this product and tried it for a full week and saw no improvement. The scent isn&#x27;t even that bad, and although the texture is a bit off-putting, it washes off easily enough. My only (major) complaint is that it didn&#x27;t do anything for my skin. The saving grace is that I am returning it for a full refund.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 27 years old, my skin type Is oily and acne prone. I have been suffering with really bad acne for at least 4 years. I have tried everything!! Believe me-- this acne cream is truly magical. I have been using for 5 weeks and the results are amazing. My face is finally clear. Please note this cream will seriously dry your face but you use a good moisturizer and keep using the cream. I highly recommend this product. If could I would give it 10 stars!!</li>
    <li> I had planned to use it for a whole month before I reviewed the product but my cheeks started breaking out after a couple weeks. It wasn&#x27;t small pimples, but large inflamed bumps.  As soon as I stopped applying it to my face, my cheeks started to heal. Now I&#x27;m left with dark spots from where the pimples used to be.  I had high hopes for the ointment. I thought the product was going to have a peeling effect, but my skin didn&#x27;t react in that way.  Although it did not work for me, it has worked for others.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve ever written a review for anything ever but this product has made me feel the need to do so! I had very mild break outs as a teenager that got worse in my early twenties. I used Proactiv and cleared it up and then had mostly clear skin until 3 months ago (now in my 40&#x27;s!) when I got the largest most painful cyst beside my nose. From then until now I have not had less than 2 or 3 large cysts to try to cover up every day. I&#x27;m trying to get away from benzoyl peroxide and other chemicals and have tried every natural remedy I could find (tea tree oil, ACV, hydrogen peroxide, etc) to no avail.&lt;br /&gt;I stumbled across this sulfur cream while reading reviews of sulfur soap because I do think sulfur works well for me. I decided I had to try it after reading the reviews. This stuff is AMAZING. I would say it has cut the healing time of my existing cysts by less than half. I have been washing with a sulfur soap for a few months and have continued to do so. After patting dry I use a cotton swab to put a thin layer all over my chin that has several bumps. My skin is not very sensitive so I leave this on about an hour and then rinse. I then put a little more on a swab and cover only the bumps/pimples that I have and any cysts that I feel are beginning to form below the surface. I leave this on a few hours or over night. I&#x27;ve done this daily since I received the product 7 days ago and I am almost clear! The ones that are left are much smaller than what was popping up before and tend to heal much quicker. Very little drying for me but like I said, my skin is tough from the years of proactiv. I think someone with more sensitive skin will not be able to leave on for hours at a time. The first two days brought out a couple more cysts that were lurking below so for a few days it may have seemed worse before getting better but I am so thankful to have found this product! It seems like a big uncovered secret!</li>
    <li> I am a 39 year old female and have fought acne my entire life.  I have a variety of problems with acne, from small clusters of pimples to large painful cystic bumps.  I have tried multiple dermatologist recommendations, ProActiv, spa facials along with what the facial specialist recommends, and plastic surgeon/laser skin specialist regimens.  Acne has cost me many thousands of dollars, many tears, and immeasurable feelings of shame and self-consciousness.&lt;br /&gt;My latest battle was with the cystic bumps that were coming one right after the other.  I had made yet another appointment with a doctor to try to get some antibiotics to clear up this seemingly never-ending painful embarrassing problem.  When I called for my appointment I was told it would be 3-4 weeks, aaaarrrgghhhhhh!  I started looking on Amazon for products to help cystic acne - I found this sulfur ointment and decided it was worth a shot since it was affordable and I embrace the idea of using \\&quot;earth\\&quot; products as I consider myself made up of the same elements that exist of the earth, i.e. sodium, oxygen, nitrogen, magnesium, etc...&lt;br /&gt;I saw a noticeable difference in my skin within 1-2 days after using this product.  I have now been using it about a week and my skin is primarily clear.  In addition to this product I use a mild cleanser for oily prone skin (without salicylic acid), vitamin C serum, and I apply moisturizer after this product twice a day (a moisturizer with SPF 30 in the morning and an overnight hydrating cream in the evening).  This product produced a lot of pealing of my skin which is what my face needed so all the dead skin would come off instead of getting trapped and creating the hideous cystic bumps and pimples.  Because this product helps the skin to slough off it is of the utmost importance to moisturize.  I have started using products from the \\&quot;Yes To\\&quot; product line which are natural products that have done well for me thus far.&lt;br /&gt;I had been using a toner and tretinoin ointmentto help dry my skin so when I started using this I had quite the sunburn appearance and feeling.  I immediately applied aloe from my aloe plant and had instant relief.  I have stopped both of those acne products and am only using this sulfur ointment as the product to actively \\&quot;treat\\&quot; and prevent my acne.  I have not had any more burning problems since I stopped those other acne products.&lt;br /&gt;I usually do not give product reviews and definitely not to this length, but I am so tickled to finally find a way to control my acne without expensive products and without relying on an expensive professional.  I understand how socially, economically, physically, and psychologically painful it is to contend with having acne.  I thought it was important to share my story in hopes to help someone else.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried proactiv and neutrogena without any luck. Then I got turned onto benzoyl peroxyde and it worked like magic. I was so happy. Until my face turned red and started looking very blotchy, aged, and just ugly. Out of frustration, I hit up Amazon and started reading reviews. This was the #1 acne product in the category. Reviews looked great. Cheap as heck. What did I have to lose? The results came in literally 3 days or less. My cheek acne is pretty much gone. I just have minor scars left. The best part about it is that it doesn&#x27;t cause your face to turn red or effect the skin texture. Just kills the acne bacteria. It does have an odd smell but I could careless, it works!! I also leave it on for 30 minutes even though the instructions say 10 minutes. I really couldn&#x27;t be happier or recommend this product enough - if you&#x27;ve tried everything else, are frustrated, give this a shot.</li>
    <li> I suffer from rosacea and acne and my cheeks are almost always red. I put this on in the evening after washing my face and leave it on anywhere from 10-30 minutes. In the morning, my skin is noticeably less red. I&#x27;m so thankful I found this!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been through the gauntlet of acne products, from prescription medications to Internet &amp;#34;miracle&amp;#34; abominations like proactive and murad. I&#x27;ve tried zen med, I&#x27;ve tried peels. I&#x27;ve spent thousands. This cheap little jar is a miracle. Within a day I noticed the inflammation diminishing and after a week the texture of my skin started to change. Try this if you&#x27;ve tried everything, it really works. It smells kind of bad but I don&#x27;t mind that, the results are worth it.</li>
    <li> Nasty stuff&lt;br /&gt;Does not work</li>
    <li> The smell is bit harsh, but its worth it! It has helped to significantly reduce my acne. It also help to tame those random breakouts.</li>
    <li> It honestly doesn&#x27;t make too much difference...Benzoyl peroxide treatment works much better than this.</li>
    <li> This product arrived on time and although, a bit smelly, it is working out pretty good. It is working for everyone in the household that is using it.</li>
</ol>
