      <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s nice to be able to purchase in bulk too; this is hard to find at the store anymore.</li>
      <li>I strongly recommend this for parents / caregivers of a child or children with temperature sensitive teeth.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m a regular user of the Pronamel (for adults) and buy it in bulk here when the price is much better than the brick-and-mortar stores&#x27;.  </li>

      <li>my kids love it and it seems to work well, actually sometimes i use it</li>

      <li>not so much that she sneaks into the bathroom to eat it.</li>
      <li>My granddaughter has used this profuct for the past year, and her dental hygienist is very pleased with the result, as are her parents.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve always used sensodyne and I much prefer the taste of their children&#x27;s \\&quot;gentle</li>
      <li>The price at Amazon is reasonable.</li>
      <li>Sensoodyne Pronamel For Children, Gentle Mint, 3.4-Ounce Tubes (Pack...</li>
      <li>My kids love this toothpaste because it is not very minty.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m so glad she&#x27;s able to finally enjoy cold things; she&#x27;s always wanted to.     </li>

      <li>My 12 year old daughter really loves this toothpaste!</li>
      <li>What I didn&#x27;t realize is that since it&#x27;s made for children, it doesn&#x27;t have the ingredient for sensitive teeth, which is why I buy Sensodyne in the first place.  </li>
      <li>It is true, however... it can no longer be purchased at a discount store such as CVS, RiteAid, etc.  </li>
      <li>, for what it&#x27;s worth, this toothpaste does not have the anti-hypersensitivity ingredient that the regular version has.  </li>
      <li>It pretty much performs as well as the regular product - handled my teeth hypersensitivity.</li>
      <li>It is harder to clean out of the sink when it hardens, but it is worth it not to have a child in constant pain.</li>
      <li>She came home from school today, and was a little hot / sweaty from playing and went right to the refrigerator, put ice in a cup and water, then drank it!     </li>
      <li>I bought this for myself and I am adult, the regular adult formula is to hot</li>
      <li>This product is no longer made by the company, and the company has informed me that all products of this type still available are now expired, and that they are not responsible for the use of this product.&lt;br /&gt;I contacted Amazon by email 2 days ago to share this information, and received a response from Amazon that this product would no longer be shown as pictured, starting in one business day.&lt;br</li>
      <li>This product clearly states on the label...</li>

      <li>She is very sensitive to regular Sensodyne, so this version allows her to still get the benefits</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> My kids love this toothpaste because it is not very minty.  I think they&#x27;ve discontinued it because I can&#x27;t find it anywhere! Too Bad!  We&#x27;ve been using Tom&#x27;s Wicked Mint for kids now.  It&#x27;s not super minty either. It&#x27;s a close second to Sensodyne.</li>
    <li> This is a great product. It is the only Sensodyne Toothpaste that is gentle enough for my wife.  She is very sensitive to regular Sensodyne, so this version allows her to still get the benefits but without the skin irritation of regular strength Sensodyne.  Five Stars!!!</li>
    <li> I bought this for myself and I am adult, the regular adult formula is to hot but I have to use something that is good for my teeth and this works really well.</li>
    <li> I found this toothpaste at the store about one year ago and will only trust this toothpaste.  The other children&#x27;s toothpaste can&#x27;t compare to the benefits and results of using this.  My child has had many dental problems (cavities) and when she started using this brand she had great dental visits without any cavities and her teeth and gums are healthy.  Sadly though, I have gone all around town looking for this brand and have not found it anywhere so now Amazon will get my business for this product.  This is the only brand I trust for my child&#x27;s teeth and highly recommend this for all children to promote healthy oral hygiene.</li>
    <li> This is a great toothpaste I&#x27;m looking for. My kids love it. The price at Amazon is reasonable. I would buy from it again.</li>
    <li> Wonderful kids toothpaste that has fluoride and doesn&#x27;t taste like bubble gum. My daughter kept trying to eat the other kinds of toothpaste cause it tasted like candy (which we don&#x27;t let her have very often). Once I found this one, she likes the minty taste but not so much that she sneaks into the bathroom to eat it. Unfortunately I couldn&#x27;t find it anywhere locally so had to buy a case from Amazon.</li>
    <li> My wife and I use the regular Pronamel and thought we&#x27;d get some for our kids. We actually now all use this kind!</li>
    <li> I use this even though I&#x27;m an adult. Most toothpastes have such strong flavoring that they burn my tongue. This is the only one I&#x27;ve found that doesn&#x27;t. Even though it&#x27;s for children, it&#x27;s still has fluoride.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s nice to be able to purchase in bulk too; this is hard to find at the store anymore.</li>
    <li> This toothpaste is fantastic.  The problem should have been apparent immediately.  When I received the package of six, I searched for an expiration date on both the box and the tube.  I had to call the manufacturer (NOT the number listed on the tube or box) to find out the cryptic code for the expiration revealed it was made in 2009.  I have 5 months to use the 6 tubes before expiration.  When I asked the manufacturer if the product loses potency after the expiration date he said they don&#x27;t test out of date products so he couldn&#x27;t say.  BEWARE of soon to be expired products with irresistible prices.</li>
    <li> My 10 year old daughter had sensitive teeth; ice cream was terrible, and occasionally, so was ice water or cold &#x27;anything&#x27; from the refrigerator.     I waited a few days before doing a review to find out if it had made a change at all yet... and it did. I don&#x27;t even think SHE was aware of what she did lol.    She came home from school today, and was a little hot / sweaty from playing and went right to the refrigerator, put ice in a cup and water, then drank it!     That&#x27;s amazing. I&#x27;m so glad she&#x27;s able to finally enjoy cold things; she&#x27;s always wanted to.     I will be buying more.  Thank goodness for this toothpaste. I strongly recommend this for parents / caregivers of a child or children with temperature sensitive teeth.</li>
    <li> This is the toothpaste that my son&#x27;s dentist recommended that he use for his sensitive teeth.  Used to find it at Wal-Mart but they stopped carrying it.  Could not find it at any other drug stores in our area either.  Was very frustrated but then found it on Amazon.  It was much cheaper to order the 6 pack and received it very quickly.  Am very pleased with this order.</li>
    <li> My 12 year old daughter really loves this toothpaste! She likes the taste it leaves in her mouth and that it makes her teeth less sensitive to hot and cold.  All the stores stopped carrying this product, so I was so happy to find it here.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always used sensodyne and I much prefer the taste of their children&#x27;s \\&quot;gentle mint\\&quot; to the adult toothpaste.  What I didn&#x27;t realize is that since it&#x27;s made for children, it doesn&#x27;t have the ingredient for sensitive teeth, which is why I buy Sensodyne in the first place.  Oh well.</li>
    <li> This is a total rip-off. I paid $15.90 for 6 packs of this same toothpaste last year (on Amazon). !!!!!  It is true, however... it can no longer be purchased at a discount store such as CVS, RiteAid, etc.  I don&#x27;t know why they stopped making it.</li>
    <li> Love this better than their other flavors.  It&#x27;s a nice and gentle flavor.  I bought it because it doesn&#x27;t have SLS or sodium lauralyte s?  in it that causes me and my young daughter to have mouth sores.  This paste keeps those pesky sores away.  SO it&#x27;s great for both adults and kids.  She loves it, age 5</li>
    <li> My kids didn&#x27;t like it for some reason but I do. I use it since they want. I dont think they like the mint flavor. I dont feel that it is too strong for them though.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s the GENTLE mint aspect that I need and love in this product. I hope it&#x27;s not a discontinued item!</li>
    <li> I hate the adult version of this toothpaste. My dentist gave me a sample of this for me and my five year old. I love the childrens option...A LOT. The taste is very subtle, works extremely well and doesn&#x27;t make us gag. The kid prefers the child flavors like grape and watermellon but also likes that he doesn&#x27;t gag when he brushes his tongue. This is a great and versatile paste!!</li>
    <li> Love this toothpaste for my 5 yr old. She likes it too. It does a great job cleaning teeth and leaving a fresh minty breath. The mint flavor is not overwhelming. It is very difficult to find a mint flavored paste for a child. This is the one I buy all the time. I don&#x27;t like the fruity/bubblegum flavors as they do nothing for garlic breath! :-)&lt;br /&gt;I was disappointed that my local drugstore does not carry this and I no longer see it available on drugstore.com either. I&#x27;ll be getting it on Amazon now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please read the label...some posters have said how much this toothpaste has helped their child&#x27;s tooth sensitivities when in reality this product DOES NOT contain the active ingredient (potassium nitrate) used to treat sensitive teeth. The adult version does contain this ingredient. This product clearly states on the label...Sensodyne Pronamel FOR CHILDREN.</li>
    <li> This product is not sold by sensodyne anymore and all the available items here are 2-3 yrs old. You should check the expiry date of this product by calling pronamel.com</li>
    <li> This was such a great deal, that even though it states it is for children, I got it for me (35 years old.) The only thing that I noticed was different is it tastes a little sweeter.</li>
    <li> Only toothpaste my kids can use without tearing.  It doesn&#x27;t look superfake or neon colored.  Mild tasting and nonabrasive- good for kids.  I trust the brandname for myself and my kids.</li>
    <li> Not &amp;#34;spicy&amp;#34; according to them. Also doesn&#x27;t have sodium lauryl sulfate which i&#x27;ve read is linked to health problems. Great kids toothpaste.</li>
    <li> My husband had tongue surgery for cancer and this toothpaste is the only one that does not burn his tongue.</li>
    <li> Do not buy this toothpaste!!  It has expired.  I have to throw my whole order out!  It is very sketchy too because the expiration date is not listed on the package.  I had to call Sensodyne and give them the barcode to find out the toothpaste expired in December of 2009.  What a rip off!!</li>
    <li> We buy this for my son because it does not have Sodium Lauryl Sulfate in it.  My son is prone to getting sores in his mouth.  One of the things that triggers them is Sodium Lauryl Sulfate.  We learned that there are many people who are sensitive to Sodium Lauryl Sulfate - which causes them to get sores - so we switched him off of the standard toothpastes.  We have been able to pretty much eliminate the sores!  I chose this toothpaste because it does contain Flouride.  The other toothpaste I could find that did not have Sodium Lauryl Sulfate also did not have Flouride.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Toothpaste works well - as good as any other he has used - so we haven&#x27;t compromised his dental health.  It is harder to clean out of the sink when it hardens, but it is worth it not to have a child in constant pain.</li>
    <li> This is the best tooth paste for kids, it is very unfortunate that the manufacturer apparently discontinued the product and now its very hard to find. Probably AMAZON should get in touch with them to provide feed back as I have seen many other parents complained that this product can&#x27;t be found any longer. Thank you.</li>
    <li> I received my product with a date / lot code of 9H24.  According to Sensodyne, this means it was made in August of 2009.  They told me the toothpaste is good for 3 years, so this product is EXPIRED!  As noted by others, this product is discontinued and no longer made by Sensodyne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, for what it&#x27;s worth, this toothpaste does not have the anti-hypersensitivity ingredient that the regular version has.  So I don&#x27;t really know how they can call it Sensodyne when it&#x27;s no good for sensitivity.</li>
    <li> Really like it. They don&#x27;t make it anymore.</li>
    <li> My husband was on chemotherapy for a good while. His mouth was super sensitive to EVERYTHING. I tried at least 10 other companies before finding this one. Hard to find in drugstores. Easier just to by online.</li>
    <li> Safe-great product for kids &amp; adults.  Best toothpaste for sensitive mouths.  Helps strengthen and brightens your teeth enamel.  I am totally sold on it.  Problem I can not find in stores lately.</li>
    <li> This product is no longer made by the company, and the company has informed me that all products of this type still available are now expired, and that they are not responsible for the use of this product.&lt;br /&gt;I contacted Amazon by email 2 days ago to share this information, and received a response from Amazon that this product would no longer be shown as pictured, starting in one business day.&lt;br /&gt;It is now past one business day and there is no change in Amazon&#x27;s listing.&lt;br /&gt;Please do not use this expired product on your children!!!</li>
    <li> No Problems it was a buy for my grandchildren since they have to use it.  I will wait and see whether they need any more.</li>
    <li> Sensoodyne Pronamel For Children, Gentle Mint, 3.4-Ounce Tubes (Pack...&lt;br /&gt;I have a very sensitive mouth, regular mint is too strong, and I am allergic to the bubbles in  regualr toothpaste, this works, but it is hard to find.</li>
    <li> My granddaughter has used this profuct for the past year, and her dental hygienist is very pleased with the result, as are her parents.</li>
    <li> My child loved it! Great price.</li>
    <li> my kids love it and it seems to work well, actually sometimes i use it and i realize that sensodyne is a really good tooth past.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a regular user of the Pronamel (for adults) and buy it in bulk here when the price is much better than the brick-and-mortar stores&#x27;.  When this children&#x27;s version came as a pack for a very good price, I decided to try it.  It pretty much performs as well as the regular product - handled my teeth hypersensitivity.</li>
    <li> IT IS THE ONLY PASTE MY KID CAN USE, THE PASTE ARRIVE JUST FEW DAYS AFTER I ASK FOR IT IN A VERY GOOD CONDITIONS I RECOMEND THEM</li>
    <li> My dentist recommended this product for my daughter, i&#x27;ts simply like an adult toothpaste for kids, fresh and cool, as she says.</li>
