      <li>My favorite DO for sure!</li>
      <li>Best I have found of natural products</li>
      <li>This is by far the BEST I have ever tried.</li>
      <li>I find that it is acceptable for both a man and a woman and its very light</li>
      <li>It also does not discolor your underarms like many brands do.</li>
      <li>I have tried many antiperspirants over the years.</li>
      <li>I love it and it lasts about a month for each bottle.</li>
      <li>Boy, am I glad I did.  </li>
      <li>and I love them.  </li>
      <li>Both products kept my armpits odor free!</li>
      <li>This is my favorite brand of deodorant.&lt;br /&gt;One</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m a guy who is allergic to MANY deodorants and anti-antiperspirants.  </li>
      <li>but I am so glad I did.</li>
      <li>but ok otherwise.</li>
      <li>and I am paranoid, so I probably apply more than needed.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s definitely the best aluminum-free deodorant I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
      <li>I am quite satisfied.</li>
      <li>We love that it&#x27;s on Subscribe &amp; Save</li>
      <li>I continue to order this product along with a couple more</li>
      <li>I like this better than the stick.</li>
      <li>Safe to use and comes in scented and non-scented.</li>
      <li>I love the lavender</li>
      <li>My favorite deodorant</li>
      <li>This is the the best one I&#x27;ve found that both works all day long and doesn&#x27;t hurt me!  </li>
      <li>This is the best deodorant  I&#x27;ve ever used, and I&#x27;ve searched high and low for a good aluminum-free product.  </li>
      <li>No rash, pleasant light scent that doesn&#x27;t conflict with cologne.&lt;br /&gt;All natural product I would rate AAA+++.&lt;br /&gt;Gotta love it.......</li>
      <li>You just have to make sure you put in on clean skin.</li>
      <li>Not as strong as anti-perspirants in preventing body odor.  </li>
      <li>I liked the old version and found it to be really effective.  </li>
      <li>My absolute favorite - it smells great and works under normal conditions</li>
      <li>Since mostly scientists are saying that it can&#x27;t be absorbed</li>
      <li>This is not cutting edge technology, roll-on deodorant/anti-perspirants have been around for more than 50 years.</li>
      <li>It was pricey in the local stores and I looked on Amazon and got a six pack for a great price</li>
      <li>Also in the world of non-allum deodorants, I have found this one to be very cost effective.</li>
      <li>I always feel comfortable, protected, and not sticky.  </li>
      <li>But, and more to the point, while on a recent family visit, and not wanting to pack up the rock, I borrowed my niece&#x27;s Tom&#x27;s of Maine Citrus Zest Crystal roll-on and absolutely loved it.  </li>
      <li>It smells nice, lasts a decent length of time, and is easy to apply.</li>
      <li>This product allows you to sweat, but sweat clean, meaning no ordor because the product kills the bacteria that cause odor.  </li>
      <li>Pleasant non-invasive scent, no sticky white residue.</li>
      <li>This deodorant is good, but doesn&#x27;t last all day for me.</li>
      <li>It is very gentle and easy to use.</li>
      <li>Citrus scent is pretty strong when I apply it but seems to go away before I get to work.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very refreshing smell really keeps you relatively odor free not sweat free but order free.</li>
      <li>It dries quickly after application.  </li>
      <li>I will be loyal to this forever.</li>
      <li>Anyway, Tom Citrus Zest is my new favorite crystal deodorant product.</li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t last all day, but pretty good.</li>
      <li>It works great but man, if you drop the crystal stone, it&#x27;s a mess.  </li>
      <li>It delivered great protection, including lasting through a very sweaty workout, and unlike a couple of the reviewers, I liked the scent, in fact, one of the few scented deodorants whose smell I can tolerate, let alone actually enjoy.  </li>
      <li>This stuff smells like 7up and keeps you fresh all day.</li>
      <li>Well, as much as deodorants can rock:)  I&#x27;ve been using the Crystal brand stone, the actual hunk of crystalized salts you can buy on Amazon, or used to be able to.  </li>
      <li>Thankfully the smell fades pretty quickly.</li>
      <li>I was right at the point of frustration when Tom&#x27;s introduced this product to the market.  </li>
      <li>But mostly, for me, it just doesn&#x27;t last a full day.</li>
      <li>When it&#x27;s warm outside, it&#x27;s hot in the steel building that I work in</li>
      <li>The citrus smell is mild and the deodorant does last for 24 hours or greater.</li>
      <li>The scent is kind of strange.</li>
      <li>Honestly it does not last all day for me, especially if it&#x27;s really hot out, but it much better alternative to toxins in regular deodorants.</li>
      <li>It does last for freakin ever, and so it&#x27;s more economical than the roll-on varieties</li>
      <li>After having many problems with mainstream antiperspirants which didn&#x27;t seem to work very well, gunked up my shirts, and caused underarm irritation, and contain aluminum, I decided to go the natural route.  </li>
      <li>But some people are not as certain of this or worry that it is absorbed through cuts from shaving.</li>
      <li>This deodorant uses potassium alum which is supposedly too large molecularly to be absorbed through the skin.</li>
      <li>but I still get pretty ripe when I go au-natural,</li>
      <li>Smells great initially but doesn&#x27;t seem to last or offer much in terms of deodorizing.</li>
      <li>But it comes pretty darn close.</li>
      <li>I like this although the smell is exactly like 7Up or Sprite.</li>
      <li>I started the day with some light car maintenance, then helped a relative move out of her house to mine, then mowed our large lawn.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve decided to use this inspite of the potassium aluminum sulfate because I like it so much.</li>
      <li>I sometimes apply twice a day, but I guess it depends on how much activity and of course, it probably varies from person to person.</li>
      <li>I gave up on the product because the roller ball applied too much product</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> My favorite deodorant but I don&#x27;t usually sweat a ton. My husband finds that it doesn&#x27;t protect him as well and he&#x27;ll usually have smelly pits by the end of the day. This deodorant uses potassium alum which is supposedly too large molecularly to be absorbed through the skin. But some people are not as certain of this or worry that it is absorbed through cuts from shaving. Since mostly scientists are saying that it can&#x27;t be absorbed I&#x27;ve decided to use this inspite of the potassium aluminum sulfate because I like it so much. The roll-on deodorant for Tom&#x27;s of Maine works better than their other deodorants and it never leaves my armpit raw. Their stick deodorant isn&#x27;t bad it just isn&#x27;t as good and if I apply deodorant to already sweaty armpits it will either not work well or cause my armpit to get raw but that never happens with their roll-on deodorant. I just realized that Tom&#x27;s of Maine now makes a roll-on deodorant that doesn&#x27;t use aluminum. I wish I had looked into it before buying this pack. I think I will try it out and switch to it if it works well.</li>
    <li> I gave up on the product because the roller ball applied too much product and I&#x27;d wind up blotting it from my underarms with tissues. It did seem to work well as a deodorant but it was too annoying (and too expensive) to use. I&#x27;ve read other reviews of Tom&#x27;s roll-ons that complained that the users could&#x27;nt get any deodorant to roll on. This is not cutting edge technology, roll-on deodorant/anti-perspirants have been around for more than 50 years.</li>
    <li> When it&#x27;s warm outside, it&#x27;s hot in the steel building that I work in and I sweat like a pig all day. I have tried many antiperspirants over the years. More recently they have caused dark yellow stains in the armpit area of my shirts &amp; they never really stopped me from sweating. I decided I could put up with sweating as long as I didn&#x27;t stink. I tried Herbal Clear Sport (sold here) but found that I had to reapply it at lunch time because I could smell armpit odor. This product from Tom&#x27;s of Maine is the best odor fighting deodorant I have found. I sweat hard, can feel it dripping down my sides, down my legs even, but there is no odor in my pits at the end of the shift.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Citrus scent is pretty strong when I apply it but seems to go away before I get to work. Maybe it&#x27;s gone once it dries... Since I dont smell it during the day, what&#x27;s the point of having a scent at all?  Today I tested the Tom&#x27;s unscented crystal on my left pit, this citrus zest scented on my right pit. I started the day with some light car maintenance, then helped a relative move out of her house to mine, then mowed our large lawn. It was in the 70&#x27;s and got pretty muggy this afternoon. Both products kept my armpits odor free! The 6-pack price beats the local stores so I will be buying this product again from Amazon.</li>
    <li> I have tried several different natural deoderants and they had to be reapplied during the day even working in an office to stop armpit odor all day.  This one I apply once in the morning and it lasts all day for work.  It also lasts through working out at the gym.  Great product.</li>
    <li> After having many problems with mainstream antiperspirants which didn&#x27;t seem to work very well, gunked up my shirts, and caused underarm irritation, and contain aluminum, I decided to go the natural route.  The problem is that they contain alcohol (Jason) which is also irritating, are expensive (Origins), or don&#x27;t last long and are too soapy (Tom&#x27;s of Maine [non-crystal]).  I was right at the point of frustration when Tom&#x27;s introduced this product to the market.  I was very impressed with it.  It works by making the skin salty; so when you sweat the bacteria does not want to eat it; which is what causes body odor.  No alcohol and no irritation.  It lasted all day long and through my workout; which included a 3 mile run in the sun.  No odor.  I do keep my underarms trimed and I am paranoid, so I probably apply more than needed.  It goes on a little wet, but dries pretty quickly.  I also recommended to a friend of mine, and she&#x27;s made the switch too.  I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Love this product works great</li>
    <li> I wish Tom&#x27;s was still making this stuff.  Had a nice, and not overwhelming, scent.  It worked all day.  No complaints.</li>
    <li> Does what it is supposed to without any issues.  The deodorant smells pleasant - and keeps me smelling pleasant too :-)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this roll-on deodorant for a few years now, and I&#x27;d never go back to a normal stick variety. The citrus scent is really pleasant, and the odor-fighting capabilities are fantastic. I have sensitive skin and I&#x27;ve never had an issue with irritation with this product. The deodorant rolls on really wet, so I always wait a few minutes after application before putting on my top. After a few minutes, though, it dries completely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll point out for other potential shoppers that this is *not* an anti-perspirant. This is actually a feature that I really love, because it allows me to sweat naturally while still providing odor protection. For those looking for a sweat reducer, though, I would try a different product. Toms does carry anti-perspirants, but only in stick form.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended product! I wish it were still offered in brick-and-mortar stores, (that&#x27;s how I discovered it), but alas, online shopping seems to be the only way to get my favorite little roll-on.</li>
    <li> This deodorant is even worse then the regular toms deodorant. It smells so horrible that the second after I opened it I immediately closed it and left it sitting around for months before I finally got sick of looking at it and threw it away. I didn&#x27;t want to waste my money so I thought I&#x27;d get to it eventually but no. I just couldn&#x27;t. If you can get past the smell to actually use it then more power to ya. I personally don&#x27;t want to smell like that all day.</li>
    <li> My absolute favorite - it smells great and works under normal conditions (it is natural after all).</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work well if you will be working out but ok otherwise.</li>
    <li> Tom&#x27;s recently changed the packaging on this product (and maybe the formula).  I liked the old version and found it to be really effective.  The new version seems to be less effective and made me consider selecting another product.  I decided to check Amazon to see if they still had the old version.  Well, the photo indicated that it was the old version since it matched the package.  Well, it arrived today and it is the new packaging so I am quite disappointed.  I can buy this version in single packs at stores nearby for a lower price.  Amazon needs to update the images here to reflect what they will actually ship.</li>
    <li> I love roll-on!  Why do local stores not carry this??</li>
    <li> This is the best deodorant  I&#x27;ve ever used, and I&#x27;ve searched high and low for a good aluminum-free product.  I live in southern Arizona and I sweat, A LOT.  This formula works flawlessly.  I always feel comfortable, protected, and not sticky.  I&#x27;ve never had an issue smelling like sweat.  I also like that the deodorant is clear - no ugly white marks to worry about.  This product gets my gold star. Thank you Tom&#x27;s! I always buy it in bulk from Amazon.</li>
    <li> I have tried so many natural deoderants even others from Tom&#x27;s of Maine like their solid waxy deoderants and many other brands. This is by far the BEST I have ever tried. It doesnt leave any residue or residual smelly odor on my clothes. I was amazed. I love not having to use harsh chemicals to reduce any breast cancer risks. I will be loyal to this forever. I hope They dont stop making this.</li>
    <li> I like this better than the stick. Doesn&#x27;t last all day, but pretty good. Smells nice, but not strong which I like</li>
    <li> THE BEST STUFF ON THE MARKET, MILD, NO ITCHING</li>
    <li> I have used this product for a few years much to the consternation of my wife. I&#x27;ll explain later.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I like about the product is that it is natural. I&#x27;d read over the years about how bad the aluminum is to your health that is contained in most anti-perspirants. I wanted to switch to a natural solution and that&#x27;s how I discovered Tom&#x27;s of Maine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The citrus zest scent is under-stated and barely noticeable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The main issue is that I can get barely get through a work day before I start noticing underarm odor. My wife will say that the odor begins way before I notice it. Hmmmm. She&#x27;s been wanting me to ditch this stuff for over a year. So, I&#x27;ve been having to wash and reapply it to get through an entire day. Is that convenient? No, absolutely not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I have mixed feelings. I like the concept, I like the packaging. The roller dispenses just the right amout of flow to allow you to get it on properly. It does take a few seconds to dry adequately before you can put a shirt on so that&#x27;s a bit of a minor hassle. But mostly, for me, it just doesn&#x27;t last a full day. So it&#x27;s just \\&quot;OK\\&quot; for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you don&#x27;t sweat heavily, you may have better results.</li>
    <li> worthless compared to the other toms series of products.</li>
    <li> If you want to spare your clothes of perspiration stains from your antiperspirant this is the product to get.  takes a while to dry but i put it on before i blow dry my hair and when i am finished it is dry.  I use it when i where my white t-shirts or any other light colored clothing.</li>
    <li> It smells nice, lasts a decent length of time, and is easy to apply. We love that it&#x27;s on Subscribe &amp; Save</li>
    <li> I am quite satisfied. I live in Florida so I sweat. I used to use antiperspirant so was not sure I would be okay with just deodorant. This works well. There have been a few times I needed to reapply later in the day. A bottle lasted me over 4 months. I will buy again..... In a couple years when I run out.</li>
    <li> I am allergic to everything under the sun when it comes to Deodorants. I found Tom&#x27;s. They are clinical strength, and lasts 24-36 hrs. No more allergies.</li>
    <li> I have tried much more expensive natural deodorants only to find they don&#x27;t work or don&#x27;t last, this does both!</li>
    <li> This deodorant is good, but doesn&#x27;t last all day for me. It&#x27;s definitely the best aluminum-free deodorant I&#x27;ve tried. It doesn&#x27;t make me break out like very other one does, so I use this and reapply throughout the day.</li>
    <li> I have used Tom&#x27;s products for many years and have never been disappointed. The scent is subtle and lasts all day.</li>
    <li> Nice smelling deodorant.  Not as strong as anti-perspirants in preventing body odor.  Still a good product and I continue to use it.</li>
    <li> I have tried just about every deodorant ever made. I have a problem with scented deodorants not smelling like they are advertised to smell and anti-perspirants causing painful knots under my arms. I have tried Tom&#x27;s stick deodorant and it was ok, just didn&#x27;t last very long so I was hesitant to try this one but I am so glad I did. This has to be the best deodorant I have ever tried. As the previous review states, it does go on wet, takes a few minutes to dry but after that it is great. I appreciate the confidence it gives me that I don&#x27;t have to worry about it wearing off too early. The citrus smell is mild and the deodorant does last for 24 hours or greater. I will forever be a Tom&#x27;s fan from now on.</li>
    <li> I have tried other Tom&#x27;s deodorants and this is by far my favorite. Smells good and works!</li>
    <li> I have always used natural deodorant and Tom&#x27;s is one pf them.</li>
    <li> Over the years I have tried many different deodorants and was having a hard time finding one that a.) did not have aluminum in it, b.) did not irritate my skin, and c.) would last a decent length of time.  I generally do not like roll-ons because of the wetness, but decided to try this one based on other people&#x27;s reviews.  Boy, am I glad I did.  This stuff really does pretty much last 24 hours (actual time period depends on activity - basically how hard are you sweating in a day ;-).  It dries quickly after application.  And it has never irritated my skin at all.  A bottle lasts me about three months.  As long as they don&#x27;t change the formula for the worse, I will be sticking with this product.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a natural, cruelty-free deodorant that would be long lasting--the ones I had been using were kind of feeble and after a work out or even a walk during lunch, I would reek. I started using this a while ago and have been very pleased.  It was pricey in the local stores and I looked on Amazon and got a six pack for a great price--each bottle cost about half what I pay in the stores.  I was pleased with the delivery and very pleased with the product.  The smell is mild and very pleasant.  And--the deodorant works all day long (sometimes two days) and causes no irritation to the skin (I was concerned with that).  It is very gentle and easy to use.</li>
    <li> Well, as much as deodorants can rock:)  I&#x27;ve been using the Crystal brand stone, the actual hunk of crystalized salts you can buy on Amazon, or used to be able to.  You can also get it with an applicator.  It works great but man, if you drop the crystal stone, it&#x27;s a mess.  It shatters into a million little shards that you&#x27;ll be finding scattered about for weeks.  It does last for freakin ever, and so it&#x27;s more economical than the roll-on varieties (Crystal also makes a roll-on).      But, and more to the point, while on a recent family visit, and not wanting to pack up the rock, I borrowed my niece&#x27;s Tom&#x27;s of Maine Citrus Zest Crystal roll-on and absolutely loved it.  It delivered great protection, including lasting through a very sweaty workout, and unlike a couple of the reviewers, I liked the scent, in fact, one of the few scented deodorants whose smell I can tolerate, let alone actually enjoy.  I manscape my pits so there&#x27;s maybe some reduction in odor naturally from that, but I still get pretty ripe when I go au-natural, like I like to do some weekends, so I know these crystal salts based products really do work.  Thankfully, they are not anti-perspirants, which truly are lame, they suck, don&#x27;t work, and leave your pits a nasty mess of knarled and waxy knots that don&#x27;t even cleanup in the shower.  Why do people keep using that crap?      Anyway, Tom Citrus Zest is my new favorite crystal deodorant product.</li>
    <li> I have been buying these for awhile and my husband and I love them.  This product allows you to sweat, but sweat clean, meaning no ordor because the product kills the bacteria that cause odor.  Sweating is good for you; It&#x27;s one of the ways your body releases toxins.  Traditional stick deodorant is made with allum which inhibits the sweating process.  This has been proven to cause an array of health problems.&lt;br /&gt;The citrus zest smells great. I find that it is acceptable for both a man and a woman and its very light so the smell doesnt stay with you all day.  I love the lavender but I can&#x27;t go through 6 bottles myself before they expire and my hubby won&#x27;t use a \\&quot;girlie scent\\&quot; so the citrus is perfect for us.  Also in the world of non-allum deodorants, I have found this one to be very cost effective.</li>
    <li> It was not effective. I am not using it and I would not recommend this to anyone. Do not waste your time or money</li>
    <li> Best I have found of natural products</li>
    <li> Smells great initially but doesn&#x27;t seem to last or offer much in terms of deodorizing.</li>
    <li> This natural deodorant works very well even with the heat here in the south. It also does not discolor your underarms like many brands do. It also seems to clear up any current discolorations you may have. I love it and it lasts about a month for each bottle. Great item! Safe to use and comes in scented and non-scented.</li>
    <li> Works great.  Nice lite citrus scent.</li>
    <li> I have tried about 8 different natural deodorants over the last two years, with very little success. I even made my own for awhile. Unfortunately, none of them had any lasting odor control. After a couple of hours I could start to smell myself. Not good. I gave the Tom&#x27;s of Maine roll on a try, and it works great! All day odor control. You just have to make sure you put in on clean skin. It takes a couple of minutes to dry, so I put it on immediately after showering and let it dry while I put on lotion etc. It controls odor for at least 8 hours on me. Which is a huge improvement over any other natural deodorants. Pleasant non-invasive scent, no sticky white residue. My favorite DO for sure!</li>
    <li> Everything I try stops working after a while even the ones that are bad for you that should work. I like this although the smell is exactly like 7Up or Sprite. Thankfully the smell fades pretty quickly.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite brand of deodorant.&lt;br /&gt;One bottle lasts a very long time.</li>
    <li> This is very good product. I switched to it about a year ago in order to avoid harmful toxins that used in regular deodorants. Honestly it does not last all day for me, especially if it&#x27;s really hot out, but it much better alternative to toxins in regular deodorants. Sometimes i have to reapply it during the day. But i rather do that then poison myself.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a guy who is allergic to MANY deodorants and anti-antiperspirants.  They trigger rash-like chemical burns.  This is the the best one I&#x27;ve found that both works all day long and doesn&#x27;t hurt me!  If you&#x27;re sensitive to those products, this may work for you too.</li>
    <li> Should have known that Natural stuff doesnt work. I figured I&#x27;d give it a chance anyways. Bottom line, nothing natural ever works for me...so this didnt either. If you are thinking of using this you may as well go completely natural with NOTHING on since this really wont make a difference.</li>
    <li> Will it work as well as your chemical laden cancer-causing deodorant anti-per sprint? Probably not. But it comes pretty darn close. One of the worst things you can do for your health is to put cancer-causing agents under your armpit so they into your lymph nodes. It&#x27;s very refreshing smell really keeps you relatively odor free not sweat free but order free. Any product that retards sweating is clogging your pores and causing major problems avoid those. I continue to order this product along with a couple more and I&#x27;m loving it</li>
    <li> This stuff smells like 7up and keeps you fresh all day. I love this deodorant! It&#x27;s the best Tom&#x27;s product I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
    <li> This is the only natural deodorant I&#x27;ve found to work, and I&#x27;ve tried many others. This lasts all day, even after hour-long bike rides. I&#x27;m very happy with this product.</li>
    <li> The scent is kind of strange. Not exactly citrus</li>
    <li> I can wear regular deodorant/antiperspirant on occasion, but I&#x27;d be lost without this stuff that has no propelyne glycol and other additives that end up irritating my skin over time. I sometimes apply twice a day, but I guess it depends on how much activity and of course, it probably varies from person to person. If you are looking for a product that works but doesn&#x27;t irritate, I would give it a try.</li>
    <li> No rash, pleasant light scent that doesn&#x27;t conflict with cologne.&lt;br /&gt;All natural product I would rate AAA+++.&lt;br /&gt;Gotta love it.......</li>
