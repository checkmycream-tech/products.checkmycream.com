      <li>I ordered this by mistake and while I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s a fine product, it just isn&#x27;t as good as the necktifirm</li>
      <li>I would not order this product again as I did not see any difference except for being more moisturizer</li>
      <li>DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
      <li>I expect a night cream to be more enriching than this product is.  </li>
      <li>The Nectifirm is FANTASTIC !</li>
      <li>I  would confidently recommend  them.  </li>
      <li>Love revision products.</li>
      <li>Quite pleased with this night cream.</li>

      <li>Super hydrating.</li>
      <li>Adequate night cream.</li>
      <li>I love this cream So far!</li>
      <li>This product is easy to use daily and has a light, airy feel.  </li>
      <li>soft and smooth thank</li>
      <li>I have ordered my second jar of the Revision Firming Night Treatment, which means I still love the results I&#x27;m getting.  </li>
      <li>Haven&#x27;t used an entire jar yet, but it seems to have helped the dryness better than just normal body lotions.</li>
      <li>and I certainly recommend it.</li>
      <li>Altho I work out and have good muscle tone in my upper arms, the skin, itself, seems to be very dry and creppy looking.  </li>
      <li>Very moisturizing, which is what I wanted.  </li>
      <li>so much that I would use it even in the day time</li>
      <li>It really is tightening the skin on my face..</li>
      <li>I love this fluffy cream soaks right in not greasy</li>
      <li>Really can&#x27;t live without it!</li>
      <li>/&gt;Regarding what it actually does for my skin, I can&#x27;t be sure that it is actually getting rid of wrinkles.  </li>
      <li>this must be sn old formula.</li>
      <li>and I wake up to soft non greasy skin.</li>
      <li>I am in my early 60s.</li>
      <li>Not too heavy and absorbs quickly.</li>
      <li>jar contains 1 oz., where other more expensive moisturizers usually contain 1.7 oz., but I believe the RFNT is still more economical as it seems to last about the same length of time.  </li>
      <li>I have tried some of the more expensive moisturizers that, by morning, leave my skin looking and feeling pretty dry.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Love it! Can&#x27;t say it firms but definitely has improved neckline and decalouge .</li>
    <li> It does not work, waste of money, I would not recommend this cream. I&#x27;ve been using this cream for almost two months, I&#x27;ve not seen any progress on my face at all.</li>
    <li> I have several Revision products and they all make my face feel wonderful.  This is a new product from their line and am anxious to see how it works.  As of now, I put it on before bed and can feel it is still there in the morning.  It feels wonderful.  I would order again.</li>
    <li> My skin visible looks smoother and tighter in the morning. Does not make it oily or cause breakouts like other heavy overnight creams!</li>
    <li> I have been using Revision Firming Night Treatment for almost 1 year.  I never go without it at night.  My face is smooth and even my deeper wrinkles by my mouth are greatly diminished.</li>
    <li> I use this product every night after washing my face, it leaves my face feeling soft and smooth thank you</li>
    <li> This product is easy to use daily and has a light, airy feel.  Does not have greasy feel to it</li>
    <li> I use this every night. I was introduced to this line at our local Skin Spa. Really can&#x27;t live without it!</li>
    <li> I use this product regular..this must be sn old formula. Its nothing like my regular product from local spa..</li>
    <li> I accidently ordered this, instead of the Nectifirm, so decided to keep it and use it on my upper arms.  Altho I work out and have good muscle tone in my upper arms, the skin, itself, seems to be very dry and creppy looking.  Haven&#x27;t used an entire jar yet, but it seems to have helped the dryness better than just normal body lotions.</li>
    <li> Fantastic cream. I&#x27;m in the skincare industry and have access to all medical grade products. Super hydrating. No breakouts. People think I&#x27;m 15 years younger. Love revision products.</li>
    <li> I have not noticed any difference! On my 3rd week! Hope I start to see changes! The Nectifirm is FANTASTIC ! Saw changes in two applications!!</li>
    <li> Great night moisturizer for mature skins. Not too heavy and absorbs quickly. Last for long time. Product feels  great yet.</li>
    <li> I have ordered my second jar of the Revision Firming Night Treatment, which means I still love the results I&#x27;m getting.  I apply this product at night as my moisturizer and by morning, my skin still has a dewy appearance (not greasy, but moisturized,(thus the &#x27;glow&#x27; description in title).  Due to thyroid issues, my skin tends to be dry.  I have tried some of the more expensive moisturizers that, by morning, leave my skin looking and feeling pretty dry.  I like the Revision Night Treatment so much that I would use it even in the day time; however, I think it might be a little too moisturizing to use under foundation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The jar contains 1 oz., where other more expensive moisturizers usually contain 1.7 oz., but I believe the RFNT is still more economical as it seems to last about the same length of time.  Very little product is needed for each application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Regarding what it actually does for my skin, I can&#x27;t be sure that it is actually getting rid of wrinkles.  It might be softening the appearance just because of how it moisturizes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I believe it is a great product for the money and I certainly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I like Nectifirm by Revision is excellent product but this one is a product that I will never order again, boo,boo.</li>
    <li> The product and service were very good. I  would confidently recommend  them.  I  was especially happy with the price of the product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for over a year and find it to be a great overnight moisturizer for my aging skin.  I am in my early 60s.</li>
    <li> Loving the Revision Night Treatment cream.  Very moisturizing, which is what I wanted.  My dermatologist recommended this product and I am very pleased with the results.</li>
    <li> Quite pleased with this night cream.</li>
    <li> I have tried multiple night creams and will say that this is by far the best.  Not too greasy nor heavy and works.</li>
    <li> This neck cream is incredible!!</li>
    <li> I love this fluffy cream soaks right in not greasy and I wake up to soft non greasy skin. I wish you&#x27;d make a day cream just like it. I use the day spf 40, but if I&#x27;m not going out I use the night cream in the day too. My lines have soften and a small scar I&#x27;ve had since I was small is disappearing</li>
    <li> I have used Nectifirm so thought I would try this.  It works as well as any firming night creatm.  I like the Revision products and I would recommend this.</li>
    <li> Revision products are fantastic.</li>
    <li> You said it....it&#x27;s okay!  The jury is still out.  It feels good going on and isn&#x27;t goopy, greasy.  It&#x27;s affordable, too.</li>
    <li> THIS WAS DELIVERED REALLY FAST, AWESOME PRICE, GOOD QUALITY, IT LEAVES MY FACE SMOOTH, IT KEEPS ME LOOKING GREAT EVERY MORNING WHEN I LOOK AT MYSELF IN THE MIRROR.</li>
    <li> product functions as advertised</li>
    <li> Very nice face cream for drier skin.</li>
    <li> I ordered this by mistake and while I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s a fine product, it just isn&#x27;t as good as the necktifirm</li>
    <li> I love this cream So far! I&#x27;ve been using it for about a week now and it&#x27;s is super moisturizing! But not greasy.</li>
    <li> I would not order this product again as I did not see any difference except for being more moisturizer and I can get that for a lot less money.</li>
    <li> I expect a night cream to be more enriching than this product is.  I am disappointed as I like the other products in this line.</li>
    <li> Great night cream. Perfect for my skin.</li>
    <li> DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> This is very good for the neck...</li>
    <li> Adequate night cream. Nothing special. Haven&#x27;t seen any dramatic results, really haven&#x27;t noticed any changes at all from drug store brands</li>
    <li> Wife says......she sees no miracle taking place, but, she likes the way the product feels and smells.</li>
    <li> I have been using very expensive serums ,, face creams etc for many years.. and frankly , I am just tired of the expense... I read a review on these products and tried it.. this takes about a month to show results but results it did show!  It really is tightening the skin on my face.. I couldn&#x27;t be happier.. and at about 1/3 of what I used to spend!</li>
