      <li>This is a great product that brightens and tightens my skin.</li>

      <li>/&gt;So happy with my purchase :)</li>
      <li>Love this stuff!  </li>
      <li>Will continue to use, hopefully will see even better results!</li>
      <li>I LOVE this product!</li>
      <li>This product is amazing alone or with makeup.</li>
      <li>Nice.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s own.</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s a nice product.</li>
      <li>I love this product because it helps all the scarring and discoloration in my very fair skin fade quickly.</li>
      <li>/&gt;To be honest, I don&#x27;t think that this is a worthwhile product.</li>
      <li>My partner even commented that my skin looks &amp;#34;brighter.&amp;#34; I am much more confident going &#x27;sans foundation&#x27; now, and am very happy to support a natural, chemical and paraben-free brand.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s nice and light, soaks right in, and smells GREAT.</li>
      <li>My skin is more even, my pores are tighter, and even my freckles are lightening.</li>
      <li>Makes skin look radiant and healthy and minimizes the appearance of aging as advertized.  </li>
      <li>However, try this to achieve a dewy look and you&#x27;ll no doubt be more than satisfied.</li>
      <li>And, after just three days of not using it, it was mostly all cleared up.  </li>
      <li>I love, love this face product.</li>
      <li>This is a lovely under make-up serum that gives the skin a youthful appearance.</li>
      <li>I am so pleased with this</li>
      <li>Ok, probably would not purchase again...caused more problems than it helped.</li>
      <li>I have now been using it for 2 weeks and believe that my skin is plumper, more moisturized and nourished.  </li>
      <li>and it is my favorite.</li>
      <li>I still believe there are better solutions than this serum as I mentioned below.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Lovely product that has made a difference in evening out the tone of my skin.</li>
      <li>It looks more radiant.</li>
      <li>However, I don&#x27;t think it was significantly better in comparison to chemical exfoliants like a 40% Lactic Acid Peel.</li>
      <li>I think for the price and time, a chemical exfoliant is a better solution for those looking to get rid of acne scars and hyper pigmentation.</li>
      <li>I love this product.</li>
      <li>I am going to try more products from this company.</li>
      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>Please don&#x27;t make me type more.</li>
      <li>I had to stop using Caudalie products once I found that they are selling in China and are therefore no longer cruelty-free (since money means more than animal suffering, it seems).</li>
      <li>It did nothing for me, after a week I started getting darker and my spots became more pronounced.</li>
      <li>Funny thing is -- although the product did do good things for my skin, when I stopped using it</li>
      <li>Saw a significant difference in the quality of my skin after 1 week!</li>
      <li>Finally, whatever I put on my face and body must smell and feel good and make my body feel good...</li>
      <li>I was very cautious about paying this much for a serum but was hoping for the best.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s great for sensitive skin!  </li>
      <li>However, I do still use it as a light moisturizer: many tend to be greasy on me (even \\&quot;lightweight\\&quot; ones) or make me break out, but this Vinoperfect from Caudalie didn&#x27;t.  </li>
      <li>Very quick delivery.</li>
      <li>After using this product more than 3 weeks my face is all full of acne</li>
      <li>I quickly ordered more.  </li>
      <li>Its gaive face natural bright lovee it</li>
      <li>THis one has been really good on my sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>So the philosophical and ethical goals of Caudalie as the creator of this wonderful line of products fits the lifestyle of my husband and me and works for us.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m 32 years old with a fair complexion.</li>
      <li>giving me life right now… my skin just feels better</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t say my skin is smoother or more consistently textured, either.</li>
      <li>I first use my retinol pads, follow with this and then Jan Marini&#x27;s bio-glycolic bioclear moisturizer and my skin has never looked better.  </li>
      <li>This serum is fantastic, it has a lightweight feel, not greasy, and quickly absorbs into your skin.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s gentle, effective, and worth every penny.  </li>
      <li>Fortunately, I had used it many years before and then just forgot how gentle it was.  </li>
      <li>I have always eaten healthy...mostly organic foods, preferred good filtered water and lived a healthy lifestyle so that even with my sensitive skin issues as described, no one believes I am 70 years old.  </li>
      <li>I love it so much.  </li>
      <li>I thought this was some sort of cool thing because it was called a Serum.</li>
      <li>Overall, a good product, but I will not be repurchasing.&lt;br</li>
      <li>It is DEFINITELY worth the money and definitely worth trying on your skin!</li>
      <li>Super disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>My skin also looks hydrated, fresh, and most important... young!</li>
      <li>, so I figured it would be worth it, but it just made my skin super oily and made it break out.</li>
      <li>The BEST Serum out there...for me at least!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product for a few weeks and am so happy.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a nice supplement to daily moisturizer.  </li>
      <li>It is worth the price.</li>
      <li>In getting rid of products that didn&#x27;t work,I am so glad I found my old Caudalie brochure and decided to check out Amazon.</li>
      <li>Absorbs quickly leaving refreshing feeling with enough benefits to the skin.</li>
      <li>I see a difference and like it very much.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Does absolutely nothing I could see. I got a refund based upon their policies.</li>
    <li> Have never used anything as wonderful and effective as this.  Discovered it in France.&lt;br /&gt;Think all of their products are good.</li>
    <li> After using this product more than 3 weeks my face is all full of acne my cheeks forehead I mean all over! I will never buy this crap again !</li>
    <li> I am a 32 yr old woman who STILL GETS ZITS! I love this product because it helps all the scarring and discoloration in my very fair skin fade quickly. This also helps my skin stay moist and dewy. This product is amazing alone or with makeup. I just bought my second bottle. A bottle usually lasts me 2 months and I do not put it on every night as I use acne products at night when I sleep. Helps make my skin look flawless even though I have huge pores and some scarring.</li>
    <li> Wonderful product. Very quick delivery.</li>
    <li> I thought it would give me a bit of radiance as grape/olive/organic products usually do, but it seems to make me a bit cloudy looking which is weird - and it cost a lot! I much prefer La Roche Posay rosiliac serum for people looking for something like this.</li>
    <li> I used this product morning and night for four weeks and at the most, the only thing I have noticed is that my face feels a little softer.  However, it smells terrific and a little goes a long way.  (The instructions call for using a half dropper per application which is what I did.)</li>
    <li> The BEST Serum out there...for me at least!</li>
    <li> I have been using this for less then a week and it is already helping! My skin tone looks much more even, my dark spots are fading, and I generally just have a better glow!</li>
    <li> Update: having almost finished the bottle, I wanted to revise my original review to say that I HAVE  noticed an improvement and lightening of my dark spots, and improved skin smoothness. It took a while, though. I&#x27;m not sure if I&#x27;ll re-purchase as the price is still high.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Original review: bought this product based on many Amazon reviews (and a non-Amazon magazine article that evaluated 10 products) that claimed/raved that it lightened dark (sun) spots and helped improve and even skin tone. It didn&#x27;t do either for me, unfortunately. I&#x27;ve now used over half the bottle (consistently several months) and it hasn&#x27;t done anything toward lightening the spots.  I can&#x27;t say my skin is smoother or more consistently textured, either. However, I do still use it as a light moisturizer: many tend to be greasy on me (even \\&quot;lightweight\\&quot; ones) or make me break out, but this Vinoperfect from Caudalie didn&#x27;t.  It&#x27;s nice and light, soaks right in, and smells GREAT. You don&#x27;t need to use much to cover your whole face and neck so it lasts a long time. I can&#x27;t say I&#x27;ll buy it again- it&#x27;s too pricey for me, personally, to buy just as a moisturizer- but it&#x27;s a nice product. If I&#x27;d bought it as a moisturizer, I&#x27;d have given it 5 stars. However, I bought it specifically for its ability to lighten dark spots, and for that it gets no stars. I&#x27;m averaging it out as a 3!</li>
    <li> This is a lovely under make-up serum that gives the skin a youthful appearance. I have used Darphin Stimulskin Plus serum previously and this one is just as good and less than a third as expensive . Don&#x27;t know about reducing age spots as this would be a big ask. As far as I know , only Retin A or hydroquinine can do this when applied topicallly. However, try this to achieve a dewy look and you&#x27;ll no doubt be more than satisfied.</li>
    <li> Ok, probably would not purchase again...caused more problems than it helped. I don&#x27;t have anymore to say..PEACE and good vibes to you.</li>
    <li> **Update - 5/15/2014**&lt;br /&gt;Okay, this will probably be my final update. I&#x27;m bumping this up to 4 stars. This works extremely well for diminishing those faded brown spots &amp; freckles. It is not helpful for post hyper pigmentation. 4 stars though because it still leaves a slightly tacky finish on my skin which I don&#x27;t enjoy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**Update - 2/18/2014**&lt;br /&gt;I am bumping this up a star to 3/5. I found better success with this with my faded, brown scars than my new, red scars. I applied nightly and my acne scars diminished in appearance over two months. Granted, this didn&#x27;t make them disappear, but I now can just cover them up with BB cream, instead of concealer. So that&#x27;s a win. I tried applying it in the morning as recommended, but it did not sit well with rest of my morning routine. I had to give it 15 minutes to dry so it wouldn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling tacky before I applied makeup. Overall, a good product, but I will not be repurchasing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And I still believe there are better solutions than this serum as I mentioned below.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Original Review:&lt;br /&gt;I bought this to reduce the hyper pigmentation and acne scarring on face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To be honest, I don&#x27;t think that this is a worthwhile product. After a month of use, I did notice fading in my acne scars and an improved texture to my skin. However, I don&#x27;t think it was significantly better in comparison to chemical exfoliants like a 40% Lactic Acid Peel. With this serum, I had to apply 2x a day instead of the 2x a week for the Lactic Acid Peel. I think for the price and time, a chemical exfoliant is a better solution for those looking to get rid of acne scars and hyper pigmentation.</li>
    <li> It is very gentle and doesn&#x27;t irritate my very sensitive oily/sensitive dry menapause skin.  I have age spots mixed in with freckles and rosey cheeks although I am a brown-skinned african american woman.  Fortunately, I had used it many years before and then just forgot how gentle it was.  I have tried other natural products and they all either irritate my skin or help my skin but do nothing for the age spots.  In getting rid of products that didn&#x27;t work,I am so glad I found my old Caudalie brochure and decided to check out Amazon. I know they have something with a sun screen so that I can stay within the line as I rely on Caudalie to help me care for my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Additionally, I know that grapes are filled with those ingredients that are naturally healing to and protective of the body. I have always eaten healthy...mostly organic foods, preferred good filtered water and lived a healthy lifestyle so that even with my sensitive skin issues as described, no one believes I am 70 years old.  So the philosophical and ethical goals of Caudalie as the creator of this wonderful line of products fits the lifestyle of my husband and me and works for us. Finally, whatever I put on my face and body must smell and feel good and make my body feel good...That pleases my husband who has loved how my skin feels and smells since the day we met!</li>
    <li> I love it so much.  I had a black hairy mole on my face that is now a light brown.  I have even shared with my mother who is having great results as well.</li>
    <li> Love this product!!!!! It gives my face a glow after I put it on. It seems to stimulate something under the epidermis! I have been using this product for years and it is my favorite.</li>
    <li> It is fading two scars that prescription drugs have not.  Love this stuff!  Highly recommend if you have deep facial scars.</li>
    <li> The first time that I try this product was in Spain after to visit the wineries of Rioja and one of the wineries, offers a Wine Spa that I accept because was something different. After to massage with grapes and lemon juice, I found this product, but after use every morning, I need to buy another one. The product mentioned that delete the brown spot on the skin, well, my brown spot is still there but the color is reduced.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a new consumer of Caudalie products as of May 2013 however I have noticed a difference in the appearance of my skin.  Moreover, others close to me have seen the change and observe my skin with a &amp;#34;wonder what she&#x27;s using&amp;#34; look on their face but don&#x27;t ask.  Being 70, I have enough patience to wait for their question then I will gladly share.</li>
    <li> I have oily, uneven skin tone due to acne marks so I started to use this for a while. It has not enough significant results to keep buying it. Especially now they&#x27;re no longer cruelty-free.</li>
    <li> Never thought I&#x27;d get rid of my melasma which I got from birth control, but one week after I started using this serum the spots started getting lighter by the day and are fading before my eyes. It seems unbelievable, I tried all kinds of other ways to get rid of it and nothing did anything - and now here comes this revelation! I urge everyone with hyperpigmentation to get this product! I am endlessly thankful I tried it after reading other reviews!!!</li>
    <li> The product is great!  My dermatologist recommended this a few months ago.  She told me that the results would not come overnight, but I will see great results.  My skin looks and feels great.  It is worth the price.</li>
    <li> I must have had an allergic reaction to this product.  After 6 days of using this night and day, I started getting TONS of red bumps all over my face.  It looked like horrible acne, but it was an allergic reaction because it was SO itchy!  And, after just three days of not using it, it was mostly all cleared up.  Too bad, I would have wanted to keep using this product too.</li>
    <li> I have been eyeing this serum for a while, and I finally bit the bullet and ordered a sample of it, which I&#x27;ve been using for a few days. I break out on my chin and upper lip, which always leaves a scar--basically have had no luck removing, even with microdermabrasion and glycolic peels. I&#x27;ve been using this for two days along with my regular cleanser, eye cream, toner, and moisturizer, and I&#x27;ve already noticed a major difference in the congestion on my chin. The rest of my skin is glowing! I ordered this immediately.</li>
    <li> Beautiful product for my need. Not greasy or oily, nor drying. Absorbs quickly leaving refreshing feeling with enough benefits to the skin. Smells wonderful, too. One of the best Caudalie product.  Will definitely order again.</li>
    <li> I have used this for years. At 68, my friends always comment that I have the best skin they&#x27;ve ever seen. It was not always this way. This product makes a big difference.</li>
    <li> I love this product. Dark spots start to diminish in just a couple of weeks. It&#x27;s great for sensitive skin!  No irritation at all!  I&#x27;ve used other products like Avene to help with spots that really irritate my skin and even seem to stir up acne. Caudalie is a perfect 10!</li>
    <li> Spent so much on this to see no improvement in texture or appearance, total waste of money! I&#x27;m really upset about the fact that it&#x27;s touted as highly as it is but to no avail.</li>
    <li> Saw a significant difference in the quality of my skin after 1 week! I have a lot of acne scars that I have been trying forever to get rid of, but after using this everyday, morning and night for one week, I can tell that my skin is softer and clearing up. I have tried other serum&#x27;s, such as Clinique&#x27;s dark spot corrector and Organic correctors, but it did nothing in comparison to this. My boyfriend also noticed and felt the difference in my skin! It is DEFINITELY worth the money and definitely worth trying on your skin! I love it.</li>
    <li> This is the only scar fading product I came back to after trying everything.  It&#x27;s gentle, effective, and worth every penny.  A little goes a long way. Just fill the tip of the dropper and that&#x27;s all you need for your whole face.  I was stupid and tried other more \\&quot;aggressive\\&quot; products after I ran out of this one because I wanted to take it further and lighten everything else up too, and ended up causing breakouts that took a year to clear up. Stupid stupid stupid of me.  I finally got the acne under control and am back to using this to fade the scars. What a god send this product is. After only 1 week they are fading, and no new breakouts or cystic acne.  No comedones, no irritated skin.  Last time I used this product it took 4 weeks to fade acne hyperpigmentation scars.  Can&#x27;t wait till the month is over and then I&#x27;ll just going to hold on to this and use when needed, but I probably won&#x27;t need it now that I know to stick to gentle products.  Don&#x27;t bother with anything else, this is the best.</li>
    <li> It did nothing for me, after a week I started getting darker and my spots became more pronounced.It was also very sticky and had a very horrible smell. I&#x27;m not sure if I was sold the fake one as I have read previous reviews saying it smells nice and is non sticky.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work at all. Bought this because it was relatively pricey and I saw some good reviews, so I figured it would be worth it, but it just made my skin super oily and made it break out. Super disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Try BioOil instead</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m nearly finished with the bottle, and while I do think it made my skin &amp;#34;radiant,&amp;#34; it didn&#x27;t help much with the sun damage/dark spots. I&#x27;m 32 years old with a fair complexion. I do think it helped to lighten up the spots a bit, and am tempted to see if using it more long term would help me see the results I&#x27;m hoping for. However, I don&#x27;t know if the results I receive justify the price for this product. I think spending $79 on a decent medical-grade peel at the dermatologist has about the same results as this product (and works faster, too).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do like how it sinks into the skin quickly, so it works really well under makeup and other skin care products. It doesn&#x27;t leave any residue on the skin. It didn&#x27;t make me break-out, and I tend to have oily and acne-prone skin. It was also non-irritating, so it&#x27;s gentler on my skin than retinol or other exfoliating products.</li>
    <li> Non-greasy and useful all year round.  Ran out and tried another product.  Nothing compares so I quickly ordered more.  I love, love this face product.</li>
    <li> Works to fade dark spots, but takes a while. If you are patient enough, then invest in getting this because it does not cause acne and can be placed underneath makeup without being cakey.</li>
    <li> I am using this two times everyday combined with a 12% TCA peel once every one to two weeks and I see a noticeable difference in my skin. It is smoother, brighter, and my acne scars are going away! I&#x27;m not sure how much of this is the serum but I think it is helping. I will keep using it and will consider buying another bottle when this runs out. Which might be a while because it really lasts.</li>
    <li> I ordered this product as a gift and when we opened it, the box is supposed to come with a \\&quot;My Caudalie\\&quot;code which had been crossed out by a black marker. Off course this was not the reason why we bought the product but it does make me question the legitimacy of it. Why was it crossed out?</li>
    <li> giving me life right now… my skin just feels better</li>
    <li> Caudalie is my favorite brand as I have tried other brands such as philosophy which has been too harsh on my skin and irritated it. Caudalie is great and I find that marks on my face are minimized with this product. Amazon was great to buy this as well as was $10 cheaper than buying it from caudalie or sephora.</li>
    <li> I have not seen a difference in any way. To be honest, I might as well be putting plain water on my face. Sorry, maybe its just me….</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a nice supplement to daily moisturizer.  Makes skin look radiant and healthy and minimizes the appearance of aging as advertized.  Not as expensive as other serums.</li>
    <li> doesn&#x27;t work period too expensive waste of time. didn&#x27;t help me at all with my dark spots in my face.</li>
    <li> This is a great product that brightens and tightens my skin. I also noticed my acne scars are diminishing. I&#x27;m gonna keep using and buying this great product.</li>
    <li> So I am a middle aged woman (48)with nice skin.  I believe it predominantly stems from using good products all my life.  Skin products are one of those things that one size does not fit all but as I start to go through some menopausal issues, I&#x27;ve had a few things come up that I&#x27;ve never dealt with even as a teenager!  My once oily in the t-zone but never acneic skin became dry and very prone to breakouts... I also have some brown spots from sun exposure.  I was very cautious about paying this much for a serum but was hoping for the best. I am so pleased with this product-- I urge anyone to at least try it.  I&#x27;ve not even used it for 30 days and I am so impressed with the tone, clarity and vibrance of my skin.  It has also faded some very stubborn brown spots on my cheek and forehead.  It has a slightly milky consistency and in my opinion smells like fresh cucumber - the scent is delightful! I first use my retinol pads, follow with this and then Jan Marini&#x27;s bio-glycolic bioclear moisturizer and my skin has never looked better.  I&#x27;ve worked in some high end spas where aestheticians have complimented my skin and honestly this combo has blown my skincare out of the park to the next level! The acne flare-ups are all but gone and my skin feels moist and balanced again.  On the days when I&#x27;m stingy and want to save my Caudalie, I substitute Burts Bees repair serum for a much cheaper, but decent alternative.  Great to know that as we age we can still have BEAUTIFUL skin!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I had to stop using Caudalie products once I found that they are selling in China and are therefore no longer cruelty-free (since money means more than animal suffering, it seems). Funny thing is -- although the product did do good things for my skin, when I stopped using it I noticed my skin was much less oily. Huh.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t buy it here, but it does work! I&#x27;m a fan. Started fading my dark spots within 2 weeks, and I used only a dab on each area. Will continue to use, hopefully will see even better results!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a few weeks and am so happy. I had several dark marks/scars on my face from picking at pimples (never a good idea) and felt like they would never go away, having tried other products. Though they are still very subtly visible, this product has lightened them substantially and I feel hopeful that it will continue to. I would definitely recommend this for anyone with hyper pigmentation.</li>
    <li> I got the VinoPerfect line as a birthday present this year.  I had never heard of the line previously.  This serum is fantastic, it has a lightweight feel, not greasy, and quickly absorbs into your skin.  I have been using this serum for about 2 months and have really noticed a difference in my skin tone and complexion.  My skin also looks hydrated, fresh, and most important... young!</li>
    <li> Lovely product that has made a difference in evening out the tone of my skin. Pores are reduced and fine lines look less - my skin certainly looks healthier and fresher</li>
    <li> I have to tell you that I have tried several different ways to get rid of my acne scars. This seemed like a miracle product. When I got money for my birthday I decided I would splurge on this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried using it for over a month with zero results. It made my face sticky after using it not soft as others had said. I noticed zero difference and I massaged it in, I used it as a spot treatment and even all over my face with zero results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can tell it&#x27;s a product that will last awhile but how does that benefit me if it doesn&#x27;t work?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;End result&#x3D; Item returned.</li>
    <li> I bought this based on the review. I&#x27;m almost done with the bottle and I used it everyday but it didn&#x27;t make much difference. I can still see sun damage by the eyes and it didn&#x27;t make it look lighter at all. I like the smell and the way it feels but did not do what it was suppose to do. I really thought it would work bec it was so exp and kept on trying it thinking it would work later. Wish I returned it earlier.</li>
    <li> This is an objective review by a first-time Caudalie customer. I am in no way being compensated etc. for the following rave review. I am in my mid-twenties with sensitive, combination, hormonally-driven skin. I have spent years trying to find a solution for my slightly acne and redness prone, sun-damaged skin. I have tried everything from drugstore to department store to designer to prescription brands containing anything from sulphur to salicylic acid to benzoyl peroxide. Nothing has worked as quickly, effectively, and impressively as Caudalie Vinoperfect Radiance Serum. Do not let the steep price tag deter you. The minimal amount you use makes the bottle last a very long time. In less than two weeks my redness, sensitivity, and acne are gone. My skin is more even, my pores are tighter, and even my freckles are lightening. My partner even commented that my skin looks &amp;#34;brighter.&amp;#34; I am much more confident going &#x27;sans foundation&#x27; now, and am very happy to support a natural, chemical and paraben-free brand. I use this product with the Caudalie micellar water and the cleansing milk. I will absolutely be purchasing this product again.</li>
    <li> Nice. I have been using this for 2 weeks now. And I have noticed that there is some difference in my skin. It looks more radiant. I am indian and have slightly deeper skin tones. I was debating between this and body shop. i have tried Chanel, CLarins , Lancome. THis one has been really good on my sensitive skin. I had breakouts with clarins brightening line. But this one has been really awesome. I am going to try more products from this company. The ecru is on my mind next as in am in my 30s</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m in a tropical climate. The serum is quite milky &amp; I wear it on it&#x27;s own. It always cause bumps on my cheeks at the end of the day. Those bumps were results of clogged pores. I&#x27;ve experimented this several times. Can&#x27;t try it long enough to notice any skin brightening effect. So yes, I&#x27;m disappointed.  Expensive and doesn&#x27;t work on me.</li>
    <li> I thought this was some sort of cool thing because it was called a Serum. I was really drunk when I decided to buy it. Sober now I have no use for it but I&#x27;m going to keep it for those &amp;#34;Just in case moments.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> Let me start by saying that \\&quot;sensitive\\&quot; is understating my skin condition.  In addition to sensitive, I have combination skin - oily cheeks and dry t-zone.  Any skin irritation will leave marks on my face and leaving myself in the throws of time&#x27;s mercy for them to fade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was initially introduced to Skoah Skin Boost serum, which the customer represtative promised would help with my skin&#x27;s elasticity and fade marks.  After two days, my skin reacted to the product.  So began my hunt for another serum.  Caudalie delivers.  Made without parabens, phthalates, and nasty chemicals, it glides smoothly on the skin with a slight tinge of pleasant fragrance.  I have now been using it for 2 weeks and believe that my skin is plumper, more moisturized and nourished.  The lighter marks on my face has faded and I&#x27;m now keeping a close watch on my darker spots.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you, Caudalie!</li>
    <li> I am 30 years old and had very bad acne and acne scars due to having that issue growing up. My skin was so discolored from all the scars. and to make matters worse, I did 4 fraxel treatments, photo facial, and 3 different kinds of glycolic peels all at my dermatologist office. Since my skin is so fair the fraxlel turned my skin into a deep dark brown color and nothing would work to fade it at all. So even thought all the treatments i had done significantly smoothed out all my skin indention&#x27;s, the melasma left behind was horrible, bleach cream and many other products would not even faze it at all. When i started to use this product, it was a life saver and in 4 weeks it was 1/2 way gone and after the 8th week it was all gone. Same with scars on my legs too. This stuff is the best ever!!!!!</li>
    <li> I have tried countless products to diminish the sun damage and melasma on my face.  Finally found one that works without cancer-causing agents.  Only two weeks of use has dramatically corrected dark pigmentation and made my skin glow.  When combined with Estee Lauder night repair serum, the dark creases on my forehead disappeared within two days!  I LOVE this product!</li>
    <li> This is awesome. I see a difference and like it very much. Thank you. Please don&#x27;t make me type more.</li>
    <li> I first used a sample of this product which I received from Sephora and then I saw the results right away after only a week.&lt;br /&gt;I searched every where to find the best deal and of course I bought it from Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;Honestly it really does what it says!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend it to any one suffering from hyperpigmentation, acne scar, Uneven skin tone. It is a good serum to use as anti aging also since it penetrate and hydrate skin beautifully.&lt;br /&gt;So happy with my purchase :)</li>
    <li> on my first day of using this  product made my face oily and it got me breakout if you have a normal/dry skin stay away with it</li>
    <li> Its gaive face natural bright lovee it</li>
