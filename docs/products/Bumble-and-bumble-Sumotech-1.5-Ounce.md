      <li>Very good product.   </li>
      <li>Good stuff!</li>
      <li>Good hold, but still remains pliable all day so you can change your look whenever you want!</li>
      <li>For guys with shorter hair this product would probably be great...</li>
      <li>Feels great and smells great.</li>
      <li>lol)</li>
      <li>I love this product!!</li>
      <li>good lol</li>
      <li>it smells very nice and looks to add a good amount of texture and hold without giving the appearance of having product in your hair.  </li>
      <li>It does contain lanolin wax and cetearyl alcohol, which are good ingredients to build a foundation on for a hair mold.</li>
      <li>Not as good as the styling wax they used to make, but it was good.</li>
      <li>Some folks seemed to suggest Sumotech would be a good alternative.  </li>
      <li>Been using sumotech for many years now, and I still love this product the best!</li>
      <li>Great fragrance, good holding power, not crunchy and easily works into hair.</li>
      <li>Love it!</li>
      <li>I love this stuff!</li>
      <li>Amazing product.</li>
      <li>Works amazing for both men and women.</li>
      <li>It would be a good Fiber alternative at $15 or $20, sure.  </li>
      <li>Very important trick I had to learn through trial and error.</li>
      <li>Haven&#x27;t found anything better.</li>

      <li>Love this stuff.</li>
      <li>(Good amount of hold, but not dirty looking.)  </li>
      <li>This is the best goop for short hair.  </li>

      <li>Great product fast shipping as well.</li>
      <li>This is the perfect solution, and I am now on my second jar.  </li>
      <li>Love it.</li>
      <li>Since getting my pixie cut, I have experimented with many, many hair products.</li>
      <li>The marketing campaign, if you want to buy into it, more power to you.</li>
      <li>That&#x27;s probably from Fiber being more waterproof/waxy.  </li>
      <li>This pomade makes my stubborn, fine hair more manageable and easier to control.</li>
      <li>Perfect blend of control without the wet look</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a great wax that just holds your hair and accents your natural hair colors.</li>
      <li>Also is water based and washes out easily.</li>
      <li>This stuff smells so amazingly good, and it&#x27;s nice for short hair styles as well.</li>
      <li>It melts as you apply it and it stays strong all day</li>
      <li>If you like a strong pomade but doesn&#x27;t give a greasy look</li>
      <li>This line is pretty amazing.  </li>
      <li>I have medium length, fine, curly hair that is predisposed to frizzing.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Overall, great hair product if you don&#x27;t mind spending the extra money.</li>
      <li>and he&#x27;s got some great locks for a baseball player -- especially one in his mid-30s.)</li>
      <li>Great for short hair.</li>
      <li>He is very picky and has tried many many products.</li>
      <li>This works well to create a strong hold with good style, without being obvious that you&#x27;ve put something in your hair.</li>
      <li>I originally had this as a 3/5 instead of a 4/5 because of its size.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m sure many hair types will find this product to be great, but for me is was not a good fit.  </li>
      <li>The claim is that it doesn&#x27;t leave a bunch of waxy residue in your hair and washes out cleanly.  </li>
      <li>Great dry hold, doesn&#x27;t look like you&#x27;ve got any product in</li>
      <li>Great product and keep out of extreme temperatures.</li>
      <li>smells like band-aids but other than that it works great</li>
      <li>Despite the high price of this product, I love it.</li>
      <li>Looks dry in a good way.</li>
      <li>The drawbacks are pretty significant.  </li>
      <li>It works really well to thicken and volumize fine hair.</li>
      <li>Is it literally worth paying something like 40 bucks for?  </li>
      <li>But, if you create an account on Bumble and Bumble and order directly from them, you can get free shipping and free sample products...</li>
      <li>This is perfect for styling thin hair.  </li>
      <li>smell is good, but a little too cupcake frosting sweet for me.  </li>
      <li>It was also tricky trying to apply it at just the right hair wetness level</li>
      <li>I will concede that the product is very easy to work with, spread and ultimately style your hair.</li>
      <li>I think that&#x27;s probably true, and if that&#x27;s your #1 concern, you should absolutely try Sumotech.  </li>
      <li>I know I&#x27;m not buying cheap, drugstore hair gel, but it should have that fine middle ground.</li>
      <li>My husband first had it for doing his hair for our wedding</li>
      <li>find this product works the best after you have washed and dried your hair, but not completely.</li>
      <li>Just be sure to rub the paste in your hands before applying to your hair or your will have white balls in your hair.</li>
      <li>Sumotech holds up pretty well, but it&#x27;s not the miracle that some have claimed it is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>He is willing to spend the money on this one.</li>
      <li>I think they must have changed the formula from what it was when I first used it 10+ years ago.</li>
      <li>Make sure your smooth it clear first or you will have chuncks and white pieces in your hair.</li>
      <li>and this stuff does not like hot temperatures.</li>
      <li>Definitely a good product for everyday use.</li>
      <li>Well, after using the full product, I can say this is better than all other products I&#x27;ve used.</li>
      <li>Easy to use and only requires a little for good control.</li>
      <li>On top of the strong hold, it is a few LESS dollars and contains a full ounce MORE of product.</li>
      <li>But that is fixed by letting cool off over night.</li>
      <li>Fiber and products like it can certainly leave a bunch of gunk after they&#x27;ve been washed</li>
      <li>I have a pixie and it tends to want to stand straight up.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll primarily be comparing it to American Crew Fiber, which I believe is its closest competitor in terms of hold and usage.  </li>
      <li>It does a great job of lasting a long time in my hair, way past 24 hours on most occassions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Really work.</li>
      <li>It holds hair very well.</li>
      <li>and I really like it.</li>
      <li>I apply it to my wet hair (the top of my head and the crown area) after rubbing it between my fingers, after I shampoo.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used other products like Label M Matt Paste with better results and will probably stick with that for my hair type.</li>
      <li>This is the latest I&#x27;ve gotten my hot little hands on, and it is the bomb.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This stuff is unlike any other stuff I&#x27;ve ever had.</li>
    <li> Amazing product. It melts as you apply it and it stays strong all day</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! I apply it to my wet hair (the top of my head and the crown area) after rubbing it between my fingers, after I shampoo. Then I blow dry using my round brush. This pomade makes my stubborn, fine hair more manageable and easier to control. It&#x27;s not greasy because you  don&#x27;t need to use a lot. I have yet to find a perfect product for my hair but this one is part of my arsenal of go-to hair products.</li>
    <li> **Addendum** I originally had this as a 3/5 instead of a 4/5 because of its size. Well, after using the full product, I can say this is better than all other products I&#x27;ve used. I will stand by my review below with the concerns with the ingredients and how it can affect a scalp. However, please note, I am raising it to a 4.0/5.0 because it has outstanding performance. So, please disregard comments regarding that piece. If it weren&#x27;t for a few ingredients and the fact that it is $30 for 1.5oz, I would give it 5.0/5.0. So, if you couldn&#x27;t care less about pricing, and do not have any scalp issues -- I get itchy scalp at times for different reasons (not psoriasis or anything &amp;#34;intense&amp;#34; like that) -- then I would highly recommend this product. It holds hair very well. And, there is no shine like gels sometimes have. It&#x27;s a great wax that just holds your hair and accents your natural hair colors. Very good product.   I had it originally rated as a 4.0/5.0 overall because it essentially does its job. But, then I thought to myself: I&#x27;m paying $30 for only 1.5 oz of product and the best adjective(s) I can give the product are &amp;#34;decent, solid and serviceable.&amp;#34; Due to its small size too, I couldn&#x27;t believe I was dumb enough to purchase it in the first place. (The sad reality is, I bought it only because Chase Utley said he uses it and he&#x27;s got some great locks for a baseball player -- especially one in his mid-30s.) Anyway, back to the product review.  It does contain lanolin wax and cetearyl alcohol, which are good ingredients to build a foundation on for a hair mold. They&#x27;re both hydrating and do not have qualities that make your scalp itch. For $20 per oz, though, I&#x27;m expecting a little bit more than that. It goes on to contain alcohol, &amp;#34;fragrance&amp;#34;, polyethylene glycols and other harsh fragrant chemicals. Basically, all of which are scalp irritants. So, yeah, not good for a brand charging so much for such a small container. Then, there are the harsh preservatives it contains that are just not good for the skin/body in general.  But, even with all that, I&#x27;ll give Bumble and Bumble a pass because, after all, it&#x27;s a man-made product that is meant to synthetically hold your hair in one specific place all day long. The marketing campaign, if you want to buy into it, more power to you. For me, what a load of junk. &amp;#34;Oh, you can remodel your hair using this product throughout the day.&amp;#34; Yeah, you know why? Because, the second a gust of wind or you shake your head, your hair styling is all gone. You have to constantly re-do it throughout the day.  The worshipers of this product will say: &amp;#34;we don&#x27;t want a heavy, hard, gel-like substance that makes your hair feel rock-hard.&amp;#34; And, I would agree with you. But, when I take time in the morning to style my hair for work (and the ladies! lol), I shouldn&#x27;t have to find a mirror every 20 minutes to make sure my hair doesn&#x27;t look like Nick Nolte&#x27;s infamous mug shot. I will concede that the product is very easy to work with, spread and ultimately style your hair. There should be SOME hold to it, however. I know I&#x27;m not buying cheap, drugstore hair gel, but it should have that fine middle ground. (Good amount of hold, but not dirty looking.)  The smell of the product is just very bland. If you&#x27;re going to put fragrant ingredients into it, and charge a premium price, at least let it smell like a premium product -- or just leave out all those bad ingredients for the sensitive scalp-types.  Now, I will leave some advice to anyone thinking about purchasing this product: 1. You will not totally regret it because it is a somewhat decent, serviceable hair styling product 2. For a better hold, without looking cheap and dark black, I would have you look at Aveda&#x27;s Pure-Formance Grooming Clay.  By no means do I love that clay (hence why I bought the Sumotech in the first place), but it will keep your hair in the same place all day even if you drive with the windows down going 50mph. It is also made with a lot of the same ingredients/chemicals minus the lanolin wax. On top of the strong hold, it is a few LESS dollars and contains a full ounce MORE of product. It also has a very nice, subtle masculine smell to it if your significant other ever rubs her hands through your hair and such. Lastly, your can also be re-formulated throughout the day if you want to change hair styles for whatever reason. It&#x27;s slightly more harsh on the scalp, itself, but only marginally.  In conclusion, I do think Sumotech is a solid (no pun intended) wax to use on a daily basis. For the price, though, I just think there are better options. If you are reading this and still on the fence, I would either bite the bullet and buy both Sumotech and Aveda&#x27;s Grooming Clay to compare them daily (like I did) or simply go ahead and try the Grooming Clay only. Just a thought. Because for me, mediocrity should not be priced at Sumotech&#x27;s $20 per ounce.  Thank you for reading and kudos if you read it all. Take care.</li>
    <li> I have used numerous products over the years trying to find something that would hold my very fine hair in place without weighing it down or appearing greasy or shiny.  This is the perfect solution, and I am now on my second jar.  It may seem expensive, but I am able to use such a tiny amount that a jar lasts about 6 months.  Several of my friends have complimented my haircut since I started using this.  My haircut hasn&#x27;t changed!</li>
    <li> My husband loves this stuff!!!</li>
    <li> I will continue to buy this stuff.</li>
    <li> Love it. Great dry hold, doesn&#x27;t look like you&#x27;ve got any product in but it does its job well.</li>
    <li> smells like band-aids but other than that it works great</li>
    <li> Seriously, if you&#x27;re just new to bumble &amp; bumble products, God help you.  This line is pretty amazing.  There&#x27;s a reason hair stylists swear by this brand.</li>
    <li> This my daily hair product.  Love it!</li>
    <li> I have used this for about a year now and I really like it. I&#x27;m a male with blonde hair, and it is difficult to find a men&#x27;s product that won&#x27;t leave my blonde hair shiny or greasy looking. This works well to create a strong hold with good style, without being obvious that you&#x27;ve put something in your hair.</li>
    <li> This is the best goop for short hair.  I&#x27;ve been using it for years.  You just use a tiny bit so it lasts a long time.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this stuff for a couple of years. Easy to use and only requires a little for good control. Also is water based and washes out easily. Looks dry in a good way.</li>
    <li> Since getting my pixie cut, I have experimented with many, many hair products. This is the latest I&#x27;ve gotten my hot little hands on, and it is the bomb. Great fragrance, good holding power, not crunchy and easily works into hair.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about 8 years now. It works really well to thicken and volumize fine hair. Just use sparingly and enjoy!</li>
    <li> This stuff smells so amazingly good, and it&#x27;s nice for short hair styles as well. My boyfriend swears by it. A bit expensive, but better than any of the other types of holding products he&#x27;s tried.</li>
    <li> Love this.  My husband first had it for doing his hair for our wedding then I inherited it.  I find that if used on wet hair, just a little smoothed clear on your hands and fingers, and put at the roots works better than any gel, mousse, or root lifter if ever used.  Make sure your smooth it clear first or you will have chuncks and white pieces in your hair.</li>
    <li> I have used bumble and bumble for years and this one is my favorite!!! Works amazing for both men and women. I love this product!!</li>
    <li> Been using sumotech for many years now, and I still love this product the best! Good hold, but still remains pliable all day so you can change your look whenever you want! The jar is small, but you really only need a tiny bit to make it work. I usually finger about a pea sized ball, rub my hands together then press in my hair from back to front. Then get another pea sized ball, rub in my hands, then apply from front to back. Then style and you&#x27;re done!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I find this product works the best after you have washed and dried your hair, but not completely. When my hair is ever so slightly damp after drying and waiting a few minutes, it is easiest for me to style.</li>
    <li> If they ever stop making this, it will be a grim day for yours truly! It holds and sets and styles without being greasy or stiff, and you just need a little.</li>
    <li> Great product fast shipping as well. Pretty pricey but its worth the try if you want the matte low shine look. It worked well in my hair has a medium control and smelt good lol</li>
    <li> My husband is obsessed with this stuff. He is very picky and has tried many many products. He is willing to spend the money on this one. It is not greasy or too hard but still holds. I have to order it before he runs out so that he doesn&#x27;t get cranky. But, if you create an account on Bumble and Bumble and order directly from them, you can get free shipping and free sample products...</li>
    <li> Perfect blend of control without the wet look</li>
    <li> Not as good as the styling wax they used to make, but it was good. Hard to get through hair.</li>
    <li> Great for short hair. I have a pixie and it tends to want to stand straight up. This keeps it in check and is flexible enough to let me do multiple different styles. Also doesn&#x27;t get that hard, wet look that gel offers.</li>
    <li> Some would think this product to be only for short hair styles.  I have medium length, fine, curly hair that is predisposed to frizzing.  I use this product after using a gel and letting my hair dry completely.  A tiny dab rubbed between my palms and pulled over my hair helps shape / re-shape on day 2 the curls and keeps frizz away.  I go no where without my Sumotech.</li>
    <li> this stuff is the best</li>
    <li> This is perfect for styling thin hair.  Just be sure to rub the paste in your hands before applying to your hair or your will have white balls in your hair.</li>
    <li> Good stuff! It&#x27;s the right mix of firm and pliable</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m sure many hair types will find this product to be great, but for me is was not a good fit.  I have longer thick hair (about 6&amp;#34; on top and 1/2&amp;#34; on the sides) that tends to dry very wavy and this product didn’t do what I needed to keep it under control without having to use an excessive amount.  It was also tricky trying to apply it at just the right hair wetness level...if my hair was too wet it didn’t really provide the hold I need, and if my hair was too dry it was almost impossible to spread evenly.  For guys with shorter hair this product would probably be great...it smells very nice and looks to add a good amount of texture and hold without giving the appearance of having product in your hair.  I&#x27;ve used other products like Label M Matt Paste with better results and will probably stick with that for my hair type.</li>
    <li> one of my fav hair products it washes out and works perfect</li>
    <li> my boys love this stuff, doesn&#x27;t leave your hair looking wet or slick back, just gives control were you want it</li>
    <li> Best hair product ever!</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. There is nothing out there like it. I have very thin, very fine hair and it&#x27;s the only product I&#x27;ve found that keeps my hair looking thick, feeling soft and staying put.</li>
    <li> This product was very disappointing. It does not keep a hold longer than 30 - 60 minutes.</li>
    <li> This stuff is expensive.. but just love how it makes my hair look and feel. Haven&#x27;t found anything better.</li>
    <li> I guess it all depends on what you are looking for in a styling aid.  I used to use Alterna Styling Mud, but alas, they discontinued it!  Some folks seemed to suggest Sumotech would be a good alternative.  But unfortunately it&#x27;s nothing like Alterna Styling Mud.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d describe Sumotech as like a very thick, very matte, tacky/gummy cream which, once in your hair, almost acts like a hair gel, but  without the dryness or brittleness that a hair gel can add to your hair.  The Sumotech is almost like &#x27;dry cement&#x27;.  When you scoop out a bit of the cream and rub it in your hands, it almost IMMEDIATELY becomes dry and tacky.  It&#x27;s almost impossible to &#x27;rub&#x27; it through your hair because it is so dry and tacky.  It adds zero sheen to your hair, which was something I was looking for.  In addition, it&#x27;s hard to create &#x27;pieces&#x27; or sections in your hair with this product,  again because it&#x27;s not really &#x27;spreadable&#x27;...it&#x27;s just so thick.  If anything, what this product can do is provide an overall &#x27;hold&#x27; to your hair...a lift...but I don&#x27;t see how it can create sections, or allow someone with a pixie haircut like me,  to pick out small pieces of hair to &#x27;frame&#x27; my face.  This crème is just far too dry to do that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This crème reminds me somewhat of Alterna Hair Concrete but is nothing like Alterna&#x27;s Styling MUD...</li>
    <li> Really work. Especially if you want to hold the ends of your flick or bangs</li>
    <li> This hair stuff is the best.  It keeps my hair in place without giving me the shiny, wet look reserved for kids these days.</li>
    <li> Just like in the salon but probably 30% less.  The minus star is for the delivery being left out in the sun on my porch and turning the paste to liquid.  But that is fixed by letting cool off over night.</li>
    <li> I think they must have changed the formula from what it was when I first used it 10+ years ago. It feels a bit greasier than it used to but still does the job.</li>
    <li> You&#x27;ll read nothing but glowing reviews about Sumotech in all the magazines and websites.  But, in my experience, there are equivalent (arguably better) products for half the money.  I&#x27;ll primarily be comparing it to American Crew Fiber, which I believe is its closest competitor in terms of hold and usage.  I&#x27;m a guy with thick, wavy, longish hair down past my dress shirt collar.  It needs a lot of hold to manage it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sumotech is a whitish hard paste that you warm/prep by working it into your hands.  You get a bit going and work it into your hair.  Use too much, and it&#x27;s disastrous.  It&#x27;s very similar in composition to Crew Fiber.  The claim is that it doesn&#x27;t leave a bunch of waxy residue in your hair and washes out cleanly.  I think that&#x27;s probably true, and if that&#x27;s your #1 concern, you should absolutely try Sumotech.  Fiber and products like it can certainly leave a bunch of gunk after they&#x27;ve been washed out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BUT.  The drawbacks are pretty significant.  Sumotech&#x27;s hold is similar to Fiber, but not quite as durable.  That&#x27;s probably from Fiber being more waterproof/waxy.  I&#x27;m in Houston, and the humidity can really take its toll on these kinds of products - rendering some nearly useless.  Sumotech holds up pretty well, but it&#x27;s not the miracle that some have claimed it is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What&#x27;s a feature for some is a bug for me.  Plan on going to the beach or dipping in the pool with Sumotech? It&#x27;s gone, man.  Fiber is going to still give you something after the saltwater.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell is good, but a little too cupcake frosting sweet for me.  Fiber will be a little more citrus-y.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My main problem with Sumo is that it&#x27;s just unbelievably expensive.  Is it literally worth paying something like 40 bucks for?  Absolutely not.  It would be a good Fiber alternative at $15 or $20, sure.  But $40?  Ladies are used to paying abominable prices for cosmetics, but as a guy, it&#x27;s just an affront to have to pay outlandish prices for hair goop.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Apparently greasing up all these style bloggers and GQ writers is expensive.  And THAT&#x27;S what you&#x27;re paying for in Sumotech.  My 1st jar will be my last jar.</li>
    <li> Bumble has me hooked on their hair products. I got a haircut there and they used this on me. Once I tried it, there was no going back to the old 3 dollar loreal products I&#x27;ve been using (which worked so well).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I went to a festival this past weekend and this stuff does not like hot temperatures. I think it ruined the product actually. It&#x27;s all cakey and clumpy now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line- Great product and keep out of extreme temperatures.</li>
    <li> I use this product every day and it has revolutionized my appearance and ability to get the hairstyle I want.  I use this product in my hair with an ionic hair dryer and the results are superb!</li>
    <li> the product is excellent. Feels great and smells great. I&#x27;d compare where you buy it as the price of it on amazon seem inflated by 30%.</li>
    <li> Awesome hold in your hair. If you like thick puddy like feel in your hands before you put product in your hair this is for you. Definitely a good product for everyday use. I go to work all day in the office and do long 6+ mi runs, this holds my hair in a comb over.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please put water in your hair before if your trying to put your hair down! Very important trick I had to learn through trial and error.</li>
    <li> I have very thick, strawberry blonde hair and this keeps my hair in place all day while also looking and feeling natural (no crunchiness).</li>
    <li> Awesome products. If you like a strong pomade but doesn&#x27;t give a greasy look and you can comb all day long. Doesn&#x27;t make your hair all greasy and grimy like all those other brands!!</li>
    <li> Despite the high price of this product, I love it. It does a great job of lasting a long time in my hair, way past 24 hours on most occassions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I noticed that this product keeps my hair &amp;#34;wet&amp;#34; looking for a few hours after applying. After a few hours, it just makes my hair moldable throughout the rest of the day. I&#x27;ve tried other hair products, such as L&#x27;oreals hair paste, without the same affects.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, great hair product if you don&#x27;t mind spending the extra money. It will last all day, and only requires a little bit of paste for application.</li>
    <li> This is the best product for keeping my hair spikey and sticking up.  I use this first, then spray over the entire effect.</li>
