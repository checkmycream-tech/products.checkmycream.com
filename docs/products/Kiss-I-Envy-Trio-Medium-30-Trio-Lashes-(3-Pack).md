      <li>They are a fantastic look in a fast application time.</li>
      <li>These are great lashes, but they are so thick that they fall off more easily than their thinner cousin (individual lashes).</li>
      <li>I have rheumatoid arthritis in my right hand</li>
      <li>I continue on until I&#x27;m happy with the amount I&#x27;ve used (usually 4-5 &#x27;trios&#x27; on each eye).</li>
      <li>Thank you so much!</li>
      <li>I purchased these hoping they would be exactly like the ones I purchased</li>
      <li>If you wear individual lashes these are 10x&#x27;s better to put on yourself.  </li>
      <li>I normally love these lashes I purchased them at a local discount store.</li>
      <li>I love that they have the short and then medium in the box and</li>
      <li>Came exactly as advertised.</li>
      <li>So much better than individual lashes</li>
      <li>The only reason for 4 instead of 5 stars is because I&#x27;d love to have them be a bit</li>
      <li>I ordered the medium and plan on getting more of that size and short also.</li>
      <li>Much Faster Than The Single Individuals and In My Honest Opinion</li>
      <li>I have used the individual lashes for many years and this is so much faster and easier to apply.</li>
      <li>They look pretty realistic without eyeliner application.</li>
      <li>THE PRODUCT WAS VERY WELL PACKAGED</li>
      <li>I really like these easy-on lases.  </li>
      <li>(the knotting isn&#x27;t really that</li>
      <li>As Much As I Do.</li>
      <li>SO MUCH TIME.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Way too much.  </li>
      <li>These make putting on falsies, so much easier.</li>
      <li>* Looks more natural than regular falsies</li>
      <li>They Look Alot Better Than The Single Individuals!!</li>
      <li>the small individual and the whole eyelash just don&#x27;t raise the price on them or won&#x27;t Bilodeau for the many more</li>
      <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve always had a real b*tch of a time getting regular falsies on; struggling to fit them just right along my lash line, and then they never really stay on very well.</li>
      <li>wow!!</li>
      <li>Normally these lashes come out of the package with no problems</li>
      <li>I did not wear them for more than a day as I did not enjoy how it looked like I was wearing &amp;#34;strip&amp;#34; lashes...</li>
      <li>I brought these because I normally wear bands or either the one by one lashes.  </li>
      <li>the next day.e rheumatoid arthritis in my right hand</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t live without them.  </li>
      <li>Wow!</li>
      <li>&gt;* Easier to apply than regular &#x27;full eye&#x27; falsies, and WAY easier than the individual lashes too&lt;</li>
      <li>Personally I could never get the strip lashes on straight</li>
      <li>these look so natural no one can tell they are not.  </li>
      <li>And they look so natural.</li>
      <li>This makes your lashes look full in half the time!</li>
      <li>If your new to the individual lash world...</li>
      <li>I recived very fast, less than 3 days.</li>
      <li>My personal application method: I use Ardell clear lash glue, but you can probably use whatever you find that works for you, and just plop out a tiny glob onto any nearby surface.</li>
      <li>Cuts time down a whole lot because the lashes are doubled on the strip.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I wanted short only and I got three sizes, I can not use any but the short ones. Is there a pack with only short lashes. I love the three lashed together.</li>
    <li> couldn&#x27;t get them out of the pack</li>
    <li> I really like these easy-on lases.  I use them everyday and they are a snap to put on.  Once you try them you will abandon the individual lashes.  Personally I could never get the strip lashes on straight so I can&#x27;t compare to them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note I use the strip lash glue not the individual lash glue.  The strip lash glue lasts for 2 day and i don&#x27;t reuse the lashes. If there is a better glue I would be interested.  Any suggestions?</li>
    <li> Easy to put on! And they look so natural.</li>
    <li> I really love these lashes they are my new favorite they are easy to use and make my eyes so nice!!! I used the medium and short ones!!</li>
    <li> Looks great fast shipping I&#x27;ll buy again</li>
    <li> Best lashes ever had on ❤️</li>
    <li> These trio lashes are awesome. You can dress them up or down. You can wear a few or a lot. Very easy to apply. Fast shipping great seller.</li>
    <li> These are great....I have used the individual lashes for many years and this is so much faster and easier to apply.</li>
    <li> These cluster lashes are the best I&#x27;ve been able to find on the market.  They are faster and easier than individual lashes.  For daytime and casual evenings I use the shorter package (which is one row of extra-short, and rest of the package are all the normal short length).  For fancier evening wear I use this medium package which is one row of shorts, and the rest of the package is all medium length.</li>
    <li> These lashes are great! The only reason for 4 instead of 5 stars is because I&#x27;d love to have them be a bit longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;* Easier to apply than regular &#x27;full eye&#x27; falsies, and WAY easier than the individual lashes too&lt;br /&gt;* Customizable!&lt;br /&gt;* Reusable&lt;br /&gt;* Looks more natural than regular falsies (the knotting isn&#x27;t really that apparent)&lt;br /&gt;* Easy to remove &amp; if you usually use mascara, much better on your own lashes + no mess&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;* There are only three lengths I know of, x-short, short &amp; medium -- Sometimes I wanna go longer!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;** My personal application method: I use Ardell clear lash glue, but you can probably use whatever you find that works for you, and just plop out a tiny glob onto any nearby surface. Then I take one of the trios, lightly dip the knotted side and (by hand, no tweezers) position it right at the base of my lash line. I continue on until I&#x27;m happy with the amount I&#x27;ve used (usually 4-5 &#x27;trios&#x27; on each eye). When I&#x27;m done I prefer the look of some eyeliner, so I use a liquid liner (MAC liquidlast) and just put a thin line right along my lash line. They look pretty realistic without eyeliner application. Unless someone is right in your face and you have your eyes closed, then people won&#x27;t notice you&#x27;ve got false lashes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I usually like to get &#x27;permanent&#x27; lash extensions done, but I just had a new addition to my family and needed to cut frivolous spending. These lashes are a great way to give my eyes a boost while still giving my wallet a break.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve always had a real b*tch of a time getting regular falsies on; struggling to fit them just right along my lash line, and then they never really stay on very well. Often you can tell they are fake. I&#x27;ve also tried the individual lashes, which are just as freaking annoying to use! I can never get them to stick properly on my lash line to where they aren&#x27;t poking in some weird direction. Yes, I am not a pro at this stuff, I get it. I have rheumatoid arthritis in my right hand and it&#x27;s pretty difficult for me to do this kind of intricate crap. The trio lashes are a Godsend for me. It takes me about 5 minutes to apply 10 of these (5 on each eye) to my eyes in the morning; every morning. Sometimes I forget to take off my make-up at the end of the night, and they&#x27;re still looking alright the next day.e rheumatoid arthritis in my right hand and it&#x27;s pretty difficult for me to do this kind of intricate crap.

    <li> They speed up the process when doing individual lashes. Now they should also make a duo pack with 2 instead of 3 to make it easy for people like me to do designer lashes. Love this item</li>
    <li> Good as always. If you wear individual lashes these are 10x&#x27;s better to put on yourself.  Cuts time down a whole lot because the lashes are doubled on the strip. A must have.</li>
    <li> Cheaper to by in bulk.....love these</li>
    <li> OMG These Lashes Are A Heaven Sent!! I Now Use The  Kiss Trio Set On My Clients. They Love Them As Much As I Do. Much Faster Than The Single Individuals and In My Honest Opinion They Look Alot Better Than The Single Individuals!! Did I Mention How Much I Love and Adore The Kiss Trio Lashes?!?!?! LoL</li>
    <li> Perfect fit an easy to use</li>
    <li> YES THREE COMES IN A PACK. I LOVE THESE LASHES AND COULD&#x27;NT FIND THEM AT MY LOCAL BEAUTY SUPPLY STORE.  THEY ARE SO EASY TO PUT ON. SHIPPING WAS REGULAR TOOK ABOUT A WEEK WHICH IS FINE. I FIND THAT THESE LASHES SAVE ME SO MUCH TIME.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; THESE MEDIUM LASHES FITS MY FACE NOT TO LONG OR SHORT.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WILL CONTINUE TO BUY FROM THIS SELLER THE PRODUCT WAS VERY WELL PACKAGED</li>
    <li> I just love love this item and I am planing  to order more. best idea ever. I have recommended them to my family and friends.</li>
    <li> These lashes are really fabulous! They are a fantastic look in a fast application time. I ordered the medium and plan on getting more of that size and short also. This is another company with a great price and a phenomenal delivery time. Wow! You really got a satisfied customer in me. Thank you so much!</li>
    <li> My life would not be the same without these lashes. Maybe that&#x27;s dramatic but seriously. I can&#x27;t live without them.  I usually use a few of the longer ones on the outer corner of the eye and then one short one towards the middle. Looks SO much more natural than strip lashes and way easier to apply!</li>
    <li> These are easier to apply than the single lashes.  Just what I wanted.</li>
    <li> These are great lashes, but they are so thick that they fall off more easily than their thinner cousin (individual lashes).</li>
    <li> Repeat buyer - thank you.</li>
    <li> Love them easier to put on then the small individual and the whole eyelash just don&#x27;t raise the price on them or won&#x27;t Bilodeau for the many more</li>
    <li> These are wonderful for a lash beginner. I&#x27;ve wanted to try individual eyelashes for some time as I have rather &amp;#34;puny&amp;#34; lashes and I grew weary of spending tons of money for extensions. These were really easy to apply and fun to wear. They did not give me the &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; look I was seeking as they were a bit long..but that&#x27;s fine as glam works for me. I did not wear them for more than a day as I did not enjoy how it looked like I was wearing &amp;#34;strip&amp;#34; lashes... I had to wear eyeliner to cover the strip part... I&#x27;ve switched to individuals now.. But these were a necessary part of my lash journey so I could get used to applying my own lashes! Great product.</li>
    <li> Great idea. This makes your lashes look full in half the time! I brought these because I normally wear bands or either the one by one lashes.  These lashes do not come with glue but you can use the &amp;#34;duo&amp;#34; glue which will not take out your lashes on them and they will wear nicely. I love that they have the short and then medium in the box and the little glue well for when you apply them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have ordered several shipments. these look so natural no one can tell they are not.  The best thing about them is you can apply them in under 10 minutes because they are in groups of two which cuts the time.</li>
    <li> I love the trio lashes in medium. Easier and quicker than the single flares. They hold up pretty good and look natural.</li>
    <li> LOVE THESE! If your new to the individual lash world...you need to give these a try...there super easy to put on and they look fabulous!</li>
    <li> These are three &#x27;clusters&#x27; of individual lashes tied to a tiny plastic bar. I switched to these months ago and save alot of time.  If you don&#x27;t get your eyes wet or rub them, you can get 2 to 4 days extra out of these.</li>
    <li> These make putting on falsies, so much easier. I adore them.</li>
    <li> It was a gift to my wife. She is happy, so is a great product. I recived very fast, less than 3 days.</li>
    <li> I normally love these lashes I purchased them at a local discount store. I purchased these hoping they would be exactly like the ones I purchased but they weren&#x27;t. Normally these lashes come out of the package with no problems these were stuck and more flimsy than the ones fro the discount store. I wasn&#x27;t very happy.</li>
    <li> Love these lashes. So much better than individual lashes and they are even easier to put on compared to individual lashes. Thank you!</li>
    <li> Way too much.  Clusters over whelming.</li>
    <li> wow!! Did I save time putting these lashes on!! I love, love, love them!!</li>
    <li> Awesome shipping.  Great price.  Came exactly as advertised.</li>
