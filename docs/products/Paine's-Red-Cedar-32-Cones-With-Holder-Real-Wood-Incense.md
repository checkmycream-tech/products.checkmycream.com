      <li>These go nicely with a Paine&#x27;s Log Cabin Incense burner.</li>

      <li>I just love these cones.</li>
      <li>If you don&#x27;t have a fireplace, this is the next best thing.</li>
      <li>Great incense for people who don&#x27;t really like the smell of &amp;#34;perfumed&amp;#34; incense.</li>
      <li>You have to be carefull separating them, but it&#x27;s well worth it to me, to get comes that smell like good.</li>
      <li>I really love them and will be ordering more.</li>
      <li>Like most reviews state</li>
      <li>I bought it more out of curiosity then function.</li>
      <li>smells good and burns fast!</li>
      <li>smells great and burns nice, but the cones are very fragile...</li>
      <li>Smells great before you burn it, but not so much scent when light.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a clean wood smoke smell, but it&#x27;s relatively strong, so probably best used in wood paneled basements or attics and cabins or lake cottages and such where a wood smoke smell wouldn&#x27;t be out of place.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Other than that the smell was great!</li>
      <li>They will easily crumble.  </li>
      <li>I gave it 4 stars because the cones are really easy to break when you take them apart.  </li>
      <li>They break so easily.</li>
      <li>it are way too strong.  </li>
      <li>I enjoy the ease of ordering online and easy payment arrangements</li>
      <li>Brings the scent of red cedar and the great outdoors into your home.</li>
      <li>I have an electric fireplace that I turn on with these and a cd of ambient fireplace sound...</li>
      <li>Thanks for having this product so handy on the internet.  </li>
      <li>These cones work great and if you like smoke, they definitely do that.  </li>
      <li>These smell fantastic and are one of my favorites along with douglas fir.</li>
      <li>For the price it was worth the try!</li>
      <li>The red cedar smells delightful and lasts a long time.</li>
      <li>loud music isn&#x27;t my favorite, so guess we&#x27;re even.</li>
      <li>Lights easily and has a decent burn time.</li>
      <li>overall worth the buy for sure</li>
      <li>I have used multiple different incense and this one is not that great.</li>
      <li>I bought these out of curiosity along with the Paine&#x27;s balsam fir incense and find that these actually smell more like a forest than they do.</li>
      <li>only redeeming thing for this product is that it was an inexpensive loss to find out it&#x27;s a crappy product.</li>
      <li>and then it&#x27;s easy enough to detach without any loss.</li>
      <li>I would certainly buy again.</li>
      <li>and I doubt I can really add much.  </li>
      <li>They smell okay, but not much like cedar for some reason.</li>
      <li>Some people think I have a real fireplace in my home.</li>
      <li>and I found that worked really well.  </li>
      <li>I threw the whole box into the garbage.</li>
      <li>I have been looking for some and these really do smell like cedar.</li>
      <li>I imagine you&#x27;d have to be using too much force time and time again and not really learning any lessons along the way for that to make more than a couple unusable.</li>
      <li>The cones are a little more brittle than I would have liked, just need to be a little more careful separating them going forward.</li>
      <li>although it burns down a good way, it won&#x27;t necessarily stay lit.  </li>
      <li>Highly recommended for anyone who enjoys the scent of a roaring fireplace in the wintertime.</li>
      <li>I can live with that.</li>
      <li>Grew up in the Texas Hill Country; seemed like I was always warming up by a cedar fire or clearing cedar for a new field.</li>
      <li>it is perfect for a long cold day for us apartment dwellers.</li>
      <li>Pleasant scent, but the cones have to be broken apart by hand (no biggie) and its hard to separate them cleanly</li>
      <li>You do get the smell of pine such as around a camp fire burning pine wood, but it is difficult to light and is not that strong of a smell.</li>
      <li>I burn other stuff to make my house smell pretty.  </li>
      <li>They do tend to break if you are not careful when separating, but you can still burn the pieces without a problem.</li>
      <li>/&gt;As far as the burning quality I did have trouble at first, but found a couple reviews that recommended keeping it in a lighter flame for up to a minute</li>
      <li>The first few sort of chipped off when separating</li>
      <li>Seriously, it smells like a clean campfire out in the woods.  </li>
      <li>so I had a half a cone and a whole one.</li>
      <li>the quality control and packaging doesn&#x27;t improve significantly, they&#x27;re not worth the trouble.  </li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s a little too much, so</li>

<li> but it&#x27;s a little too much, so</li>
<li> Low and slow wins the race I guess.</li>
<li> Not sure if the rest of my family likes them as much as I do, but...</li>
<li> A mild cedar, with cones that are poorly shaped.</li>
<li> They are also a little harder to light than the douglas fir sticks (I&#x27;m not sure if the cone shape is a factor).</li>
<li> You have to be careful, however, breaking the cones into individual pieces.</li>
<li> after several tries!</li>
<li> I have found about equal success cutting along the separations with a serrated knife or just briskly snapping at the separation point.</li>
<li> so be careful..</li>
<li> They are a bit crumbly, s be careful, but they burn quite well, unlike some other incense Paine&#x27;s makes.</li>
<li> Not as pictured  Inferior to other products they sell.  </li>
<li> Plenty of other options out there.  </li>
<li> It was hard to seperate the incense without crumbling it or crumbling the ones next to it.  </li>
<li> If the cones were already separated, or at least easier to pull apart, I&#x27;d give it a solid 5 stars.</li>
<li> You have to break these apart and then half of them break in half.  </li>
<li> A little smokier than what you might be used to - dropping one star because of that.</li>
<li> Basically you should think of the smell as a small version of a woodstove or campfire.  </li>
<li> Not a good idea at all.</li>
<li> One or two have broken as I&#x27;ve pulled them apart for use, but you just need to use a bit of care</li>
<li> so you end up with lots of partial cones (very annoying and wasteful).  </li>
<li> This stuff is formed into haphazard &#x27;cones&#x27; which break apart and flake and spark when lit...</li>
<li> These things smell like cedar before you burn them, but they smell like bad campfire sausage once they&#x27;re on fire</li>
<li> Very disappointed with this product as it seemed like the box and all the contents had been soaked in water.</li>
<li> I have purchased a lot of items from Amazon and this is my worst purchace ever.</li>

    <li> Not as pictured  Inferior to other products they sell.  These cones last sbout 7 minutes only.</li>
    <li> If you want your house to smell like a campfire this is the product for you.  I burn other stuff to make my house smell pretty.  I burn the red cedar to remind me of the outdoors when I&#x27;m stuck in the city.  It has a calming effect for this nature nut.</li>
    <li> love these in the winter!</li>
    <li> I have two of those german incense smokers, where the smoke comes out of their mouth and the cones that came with it are way too strong.  This scent is perfect!  Smells Just like if you were to have a fire burning in a fireplace.  You have to be carefull separating them, but it&#x27;s well worth it to me, to get comes that smell like good.</li>
    <li> I have used multiple different incense and this one is not that great. I bought it more out of curiosity then function.

    <li> These things smell like cedar before you burn them, but they smell like bad campfire sausage once they&#x27;re on fire</li>
    <li> Very fragile.  It was hard to seperate the incense without crumbling it or crumbling the ones next to it.  Other than that the smell was great! Reminded me of home in all the evergreens.</li>
    <li> this is the strangest incense i have ever used - it is basically just cedar pulp somehow bound together.  Works like a charm and smells great though.  A little smokier than what you might be used to - dropping one star because of that.</li>
    <li> So there&#x27;s a ton of reviews of Paine&#x27;s wood incense and I doubt I can really add much.  Like most reviews state this isn&#x27;t like a &amp;#34;traditional&amp;#34; incense, it&#x27;s just wood.  So when you burn it, it smells like burning wood, not like a perfume that smells like cedar oil or something.  I prefer the cedar to the Balsam Fir, but I like both and I haven&#x27;t tried the pinion pine yet so can&#x27;t speak to that.  Basically you should think of the smell as a small version of a woodstove or campfire.  It&#x27;s a clean wood smoke smell, but it&#x27;s relatively strong, so probably best used in wood paneled basements or attics and cabins or lake cottages and such where a wood smoke smell wouldn&#x27;t be out of place.&lt;br /&gt;As far as the burning quality I did have trouble at first, but found a couple reviews that recommended keeping it in a lighter flame for up to a minute and I found that worked really well.  I tried using a jet lighter initially but it&#x27;s a little too much, so although it burns down a good way, it won&#x27;t necessarily stay lit.  Low and slow wins the race I guess.</li>
    <li> well packaged and quick delivery, excellent seller and service, like the product except they don&#x27;t burn well and they are all stuck together and need to break them apart, AAA+++</li>
    <li> These have your house smelling like a fireplace in no time</li>
    <li> I bought these out of curiosity along with the Paine&#x27;s balsam fir incense and find that these actually smell more like a forest than they do. The sticks are made of actual compacted cedar and burn well. I really love them and will be ordering more. One or two have broken as I&#x27;ve pulled them apart for use, but you just need to use a bit of care and then it&#x27;s easy enough to detach without any loss. I imagine you&#x27;d have to be using too much force time and time again and not really learning any lessons along the way for that to make more than a couple unusable. There is a bit of a smoke smell along with the cedar itself but folks, that&#x27;s what incense is. I have an electric fireplace that I turn on with these and a cd of ambient fireplace sound...it is perfect for a long cold day for us apartment dwellers.</li>
    <li> I just love these cones. I have been looking for some and these really do smell like cedar. A great refreshing smell for any home!</li>
    <li> smells great and burns nice, but the cones are very fragile... so be careful.. overall worth the buy for sure</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t see how they get away calling this stuff incense. More like barkdust and glue! This stuff is formed into haphazard &#x27;cones&#x27; which break apart and flake and spark when lit...after several tries! Not like any incense you&#x27;ve ever burned  before!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only redeeming thing for this product is that it was an inexpensive loss to find out it&#x27;s a crappy product. If you like your bathroom smelling like a fire pit, then you should love it!! Based on this product, I would stay away from ALL Paine&#x27;s incense.</li>
    <li> A mild cedar, with cones that are poorly shaped.</li>
    <li> Smells great, very nice cedar smell!</li>
    <li> This is a very pleasing aroma that fill my home with a very pleasant smell. Some people think I have a real fireplace in my home.</li>
    <li> Thanks for having this product so handy on the internet.  I enjoy the ease of ordering online and easy payment arrangements</li>
    <li> These smell fantastic and are one of my favorites along with douglas fir. They do tend to break if you are not careful when separating, but you can still burn the pieces without a problem. They are also a little harder to light than the douglas fir sticks (I&#x27;m not sure if the cone shape is a factor). These go nicely with a Paine&#x27;s Log Cabin Incense burner. If you don&#x27;t have a fireplace, this is the next best thing.</li>
    <li> Pleasant scent, but the cones have to be broken apart by hand (no biggie) and its hard to separate them cleanly so you end up with lots of partial cones (very annoying and wasteful).  There&#x27;s also lots of powdery residue in the box---if you drop it, hope you have a hand-vac nearby.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If the quality control and packaging doesn&#x27;t improve significantly, they&#x27;re not worth the trouble.  Plenty of other options out there.  I won&#x27;t be buying these again.</li>
    <li> Seriously, it smells like a clean campfire out in the woods.  I gave it 4 stars because the cones are really easy to break when you take them apart.  If the cones were already separated, or at least easier to pull apart, I&#x27;d give it a solid 5 stars.</li>
    <li> smells good and burns fast! They did not break on me like others said. The smell does remind me of a campfire. and I use them when I use my ethanol fireplace, as that does not throw off a smell.</li>
    <li> You have to break these apart and then half of them break in half.  They smell okay, but not much like cedar for some reason.</li>
    <li> Great incense for people who don&#x27;t really like the smell of &amp;#34;perfumed&amp;#34; incense. Brings the scent of red cedar and the great outdoors into your home. Felt like we had Christmas in a log cabin made of red cedar. Highly recommended for anyone who enjoys the scent of a roaring fireplace in the wintertime. (Even without a fireplace)</li>
    <li> The cones are all pressed together and often break into pieces when you try to separate. Not a good idea at all. Smells great before you burn it, but not so much scent when light.</li>
    <li> Take care when separating the cones as they tend to disintegrate.  They have a nice woodsy aroma that lingers.  The first few sort of chipped off when separating so I had a half a cone and a whole one.</li>
    <li> I already knew what I was getting when I bought these via Amazon since I had received some before as a gift. The red cedar smells delightful and lasts a long time. You have to be careful, however, breaking the cones into individual pieces. They will easily crumble.  I have found about equal success cutting along the separations with a serrated knife or just briskly snapping at the separation point. You will still get some crumbles. I can live with that.</li>
    <li> Why cones? They break so easily.</li>
    <li> These smell great. Like a campfire, almost. They are a bit crumbly, s be careful, but they burn quite well, unlike some other incense Paine&#x27;s makes.</li>
    <li> Grew up in the Texas Hill Country; seemed like I was always warming up by a cedar fire or clearing cedar for a new field. I put one of these on when I need to roll the memories back.</li>
    <li> If you love the smell of a wood fire but don&#x27;t have a fireplace you&#x27;ll love these!!</li>
    <li> I thought it would smell like a cedar closet - think I would have preferred the pine - it was OK, but not wonderful</li>
    <li> Very nice scent. Lights easily and has a decent burn time. The cones are a little more brittle than I would have liked, just need to be a little more careful separating them going forward. I would certainly buy again.</li>
