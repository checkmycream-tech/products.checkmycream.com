      <li>Gives nice shape and is better at grabbing my outer lashes than my Shiseido did.</li>
      <li>BUT this is by far the best eyelash curler I have ever had in decades.  </li>
      <li>I have owned many eyelash curlers &amp; this is, by far, the best.</li>
      <li>great product and fast shipping!</li>

      <li>I was hesitant about ordering this eyelash curler but am so glad I did.  </li>

      <li>It was okay while it lasted--It was made of plastic</li>
      <li>I ordered this eyelash curler after reading many a review recommending it.</li>

      <li>Better than nothing.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s compact size in no way reflects the fabulous job it does on curling the lashes!</li>
      <li>this one is better.</li>

      <li>I really do love this eyelash curler.</li>
      <li>I am glad I bought it.</li>
      <li>so I&#x27;m sure it works better on those with fuller lashes.</li>
      <li>I love the design.</li>
      <li>Once you get used to positioning, this is great and the crimp really holds.</li>
      <li>I love this eyelash curler.</li>
      <li>Would love to see this product in two sizes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Leah M. (not Paul</li>
      <li>And to make it even better</li>
      <li>My mom did research to find the best eye lash curler for me when she was looking for a Christmas present.</li>
      <li>just wish they made it in something more durable.</li>
      <li>So far, it&#x27;s worked great.</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t tell that it does any better than a cheap metal curler.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;d suggest this product for anyone who wants a really good eyelash curler.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Great curler! I mean it really works! Once you get the hang if it, you&#x27;ll never go back to a regular curler..</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B002P4W6MO Laura Mercier Eyelash Curler]]&lt;br /&gt;This is the best eyelash curler! I first read about this item in INSTYLE magazine. It is every bit as good as the beauty editor said.</li>
    <li> Works great!  Easy on your lashes, doesn&#x27;t hurt or pull.  Great look when done.</li>
    <li> I really like how the lash curler worked, however it took a little getting use to.&lt;br /&gt;The curler lasted only four months and broke. I contacted the company through Amazon, and through their website with no response.  I would not purchase this lash curler again</li>
    <li> I had great expectations from this product. However, I found it very difficult to use, and did not curl my lashes as well as all the hype said it would. I have since bought a curler that I find much easier to use, and does the job quite well. This eyelash curler was a complete waste of money.</li>
    <li> I had purchased one of these eyelash curlers about a year ago.  I broke it one day and reordered the same one even though it did break easily.  I think it is one of the best curlers I have ever used.  It does not grab my eyelid or pull my lashes as other curlers do.</li>
    <li> this is the best eyelash curler that I have ever used - no pulling on the eyelashes - the curl stays all day</li>
    <li> This eyelash curler got rave reviews in a magazine that I read.  I spent the extra money to get it and am very displeased.  It feels cheap, it&#x27;s hard to manipulate (especially if you have near-sighted issues) and doesn&#x27;t do any better job than the old-fashioned ones.  Really wish I had never purchased this one!</li>
    <li> This is a great eyelash curler, it works really well for a dramatic curl. BUT the best part is its little so you can actually carry it with you, unlike those big metal ones. It comes with a replacment pad, but it took me a while to figure out where it was... on the bottom of it. Its great and so much nicer then the S. U. One everyone thinks is so great.</li>
    <li> Love this curler! The best I&#x27;ve ever used! I rarely pinch myself and I feel like I get a great curl compared to other curlers. This lasts!</li>
    <li> This eyelash curler does not work very well. I have long and thick eyelashes and this did not curl my lashes at all. I had to use my old backup curler in combination with this curler. The only positive is that it is small and compact and will easily fit in my purse. I was not impressed with this product. I felt like it would break if I squeezed too hard.</li>
    <li> After being rated in a magazine as the best eyelash curler, it was hard to find.  Found it easily at Amazon.  Came fast, pleased with the curler.  Works great.  Love getting good stuff in the mail!</li>
    <li> Definitely recommend.  Easy to use; compact.  I like the great job it does in curling my lashes!</li>
    <li> I wish the curler had a little more curve to it. I cannot curl my entire lid at once :(&lt;br /&gt;VERY small / compact&lt;br /&gt;Easy to use&lt;br /&gt;Has a replacement bumper in the bottom</li>
    <li> Like the way it works, but it&#x27;s a little \\&quot;short\\&quot; to hold onto while curling. A little awkward. But it gets the job done, and I like it.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s compact size in no way reflects the fabulous job it does on curling the lashes!</li>
    <li> Think I&#x27;ve had for a year, and just stopped working a week ago. The thing would still close and look like it was curling, but it wasn&#x27;t even gripping my eyelashes. Loved it up until then.</li>
    <li> I read about this curler in Good Housekeeping, and because of their glowing review, I thought I&#x27;d try it.  My lashes are thin, but using this curler which is designed very well to separate your lashes as it curls, made a huge difference!  I didn&#x27;t think it would make that much of a difference, but I was wrong.  The design is different from other curlers, but it is easy to adapt to, and I think this unique design is what makes it work much better than others.</li>
    <li> Very small. Works well. But tricky to get the hang of.</li>
    <li> I was hesitant about ordering this eyelash curler but am so glad I did.  This little curler does a great job - better than the conventional curlers I&#x27;ve used for years.  Love it!</li>
    <li> Laura Mercier is a great brand, but this was the worst on my eyelashes. 1. It didn&#x27;t reach all of them. Maybe I just have weirdly shaped eyes? 2. The &amp;#34;curl&amp;#34; wasn&#x27;t smooth at all. My eyelashes just looked really bent and gross....anyone who has ever used a cheap eyelash curler knows what I mean. 3. It hurts!</li>
    <li> curl power was just ok and then it broke after just a few weeks</li>
    <li> This is a good little eyelash curler. I don&#x27;t have many lashes so I&#x27;m sure it works better on those with fuller lashes. It doesn&#x27;t take up much room in your makeup bag and is easy to use.</li>
    <li> I had to get used to pressing harder and longer on it than I first thought I needed to, but it achieves the desired look for that day.</li>
    <li> LOVE this eyelash curler! Super gentle, yet curls my eyelashes perfectly! Goodbye metal contraptions!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this curler for about a month.  It doesn&#x27;t seem to easily pinch my eyelid.  It seems to curl my eyelashes better than previous instruments.  It can get a little tricky though trying to create the curl look as opposed to a crimped look.  I curl at the base and at the ends only.  Curling in the middle seems to distort the curl into a crimp.  I&#x27;m still working with it but for whatever reason this seems to create a better curl.</li>
    <li> Works like a dream. This is the easiest curler I have ever used. No pinching and fits in the smallest of make up bags.</li>
    <li> Great curler. Gives nice shape and is better at grabbing my outer lashes than my Shiseido did. Will repurchase whenever I have to. It comes w an extra pad so that&#x27;s awesome too. (Shiseido recommends buying an entire new curler every few mths. I hated that and that&#x27;s why I researched and bought this one instead)</li>
    <li> My wife told me this works much better, is easier to use and causes her to be much less concerned about accidentally hurting herself.</li>
    <li> It is the best curler ever!!!!!! I have short lashes and they look much longer with this. Buy it with no regret</li>
    <li> I have small eyelashes, and this curler works so well.&lt;br /&gt;My lashes look longer, &amp; the curler doesn&#x27;t pull them out!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been really impressed with this. I never liked the big metal contraption and always felt like it pulled too much on the lashes. Once you get used to positioning, this is great and the crimp really holds. It&#x27;s also much easier to travel with than the contraption.</li>
    <li> This curler works perfectly!  It&#x27;s so small that it doesn&#x27;t take up a lot of room, which is a big plus for me.  Also, this one is quite a bit less intimidating than the traditional style eyelash curlers.  It was a little expensive, but it seems sturdy enough and I would expect it to last quite awhile.</li>
    <li> My mom did research to find the best eye lash curler for me when she was looking for a Christmas present. She bought me this, and while it initially looked kinda weird, it works great and it is super small for travel.  Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> You can get right to the base of the eyelash.  A little expensive but well worth it.  I am glad I bought it.</li>
    <li> Did not like the eyelash curler at all  My old Revelon curler is much better</li>
    <li> Very unusual and a little difficult to use at the start.  Now, wouldn&#x27;t trade it.  Fits in your purse easily, holds the curl better than any other product...Give this a try!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m small, and so are my eyes. Most eyelash curlers are too wide for my eyes, but not this one. This curler is an excellent product. I have long lashes; however, I think it would work well on shorter ones as well. So far, it&#x27;s worked great.</li>
    <li> I feel the old fashioned Maybelline eyelash curler works just as well if not better.  The only thing better about the Laura Mercier curler is it&#x27;s size.</li>
    <li> I purchased this eyelash curler after reading good reviews in Good Housekeeping. I have been very disappointed. It certainly does not work as well&lt;br /&gt;as I had hoped. I can&#x27;t tell that it does any better than a cheap metal curler.</li>
    <li> This is a handy little eyelash curler, easy to pack.  It took me a while to master it since it is so different from the traditional scissor style curler, but it does a nice job.</li>
    <li> great, best curler ever!</li>
    <li> Best curler I have found - takes a little practice but is worth it.</li>
    <li> LOVE THIS  NOT  hard on my lash&#x27;s (have really short one)  and it makes them look long.  Always had to wait to get it at a store back in Ne where I use to live  SOOOOO  this is great to know I can get on amazon  and get it  asap</li>
    <li> Before this eyelash curler broke, it would crimp my eyelashes instead of curling them.  It would bend my eyelashes in a 90 degree angle.  It was also so small, I would have to \\&quot;curl\\&quot; each eye twice because the curling part of it wouldn&#x27;t reach across my whole eye at once.  Got it as a Christmas gift and it only lasted 4 months before it broke.</li>
    <li> My lashes were sparse and so I stopped wearing mascara for some time.  I decided to purchase this curler because of the reviews it received on line.  It works great and I am back to mascara again because of the curl that this devise creates.  I would definitely recommend this product because I believe it does a better job than any other curler out there.</li>
    <li> I like this curler.  It took a few times to get use to the compact size but I have been very happy with it compared to the other brands.  My one complaint is that they break.  I expect to replace it after a year or so.  I keep an extra one in my drawer for when it happens... but I keep buying them because the results are so much better than the others.!</li>
    <li> Compact, effective, and chic.  Had to take a chance, &amp;#34;think outside the box&amp;#34;, and try it.  I am very pleased. It curls quickly and helps my skimpy (but long) lashed look fuller.</li>
    <li> Took a few times to get used to using such a different style of eyelash curler, but it really curls well. I almost always pinched an eyelid with the old style, but that rarely happens with this one.</li>
    <li> I ordered this eyelash curler after reading many a review recommending it. I waited anxiously for it to arrive...Finally, my eyelash curler arrived and I loved the look of it...It is small enough to put in your makeup bag and folds so the handle is out of the way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My first try with the curler was awful! It is way too small for anyone with large eyes and only reaches around 1/2 to 3/4 of my eyelashes. It crimped the eyelashes it did grab in an awkward angle that was not curled but instead crimped. Not a good look...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried the other eye and was also not successful. I tried to use this eyelash curler several times and was not successfull! Would not purchase again...by the way the handle is also awkward - the whole thing seems as if it were made for a child and not a grown woman...would NOT buy again! Going back to my Shu Umera!!!</li>
    <li> it curls eyelashes beautifully &amp; it&#x27;s so compact I can just put it in my small make up bag &amp; carry it everywhere.  I gave it 4 stars because the design it&#x27;s a little too flat for my eyes.  I have to do my outer lashes separately cause it doesn&#x27;t grab it all.</li>
    <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Its very small.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When you do take your time you get a good curl&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Its very small.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It takes me a few tries to get a good curl.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m always afraid that the back piece that you hold down to curl will break off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In all I don&#x27;t think the curler is worth the money.</li>
    <li> once you get comfortable with using this, i really like it,  it took a little learning curve,  but totally worth it.  i can curl lashes the  usual way, then start to tilt the curler up , i just keep doing this till the curler is almost upside down.  pressing lashes and tilting up your lashes.  hard to describe,  but it works for me.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my mom, even looked up a video on how to use it, but it does absolutely nothing for her lashes or mine. Super bummed.</li>
    <li> I loved this eyelash curler except for one thing.  The color of the curler...you can&#x27;t see your eyelashes so you don&#x27;t know if you actually got all of your eyelashes in the curler.  I inquired about another color and was told that is the only color it comes in. Too bad because it does work.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s 100% on par with it&#x27;s full-sized counterparts even for stubbornly straight lashes. The &amp;#34;handle&amp;#34; isn&#x27;t as sturdy feeling as regular eyelash curlers but it still manages to create crimp-free curls. And, it rarely pinches! It&#x27;s definitely a great addition to any traveler&#x27;s bag.</li>
    <li> I love this eyelash curler. In fact, I&#x27;ve had three of them because the same piece keeps snapping off. After several months of normal use, it cracks at the stress point of what you push down to curl your lashes. I should say, I&#x27;ve only purchased one and I just keep returning them to Nordstroms and getting them exchanged. Other than this one rather big issue, I love the curler for the following reasons:&lt;br /&gt;1. You can curl your lashes without pinching your eyelid.&lt;br /&gt;2. It is small and compact and easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;3. I have small eyes and the regular eyelash curlers are just too big for me.</li>
    <li> Was described as curling eyelashes as 149% better than other brands/types.  It did NOT do this and was difficult to use, compared to other brands.  Being priced at 2 to 3 times higher - it was a total waste of money.  I will stick to using Revlon or Maybelline brands eyelash curlers.  MUCH better job!</li>
    <li> This gets the job done if I do it two or three times. Better than nothing. I am continuing to look for a replacement for Tweezerman&#x27;s similar model.</li>
    <li> This is my third Laura Mercier Eyelash Curler. I actually bought two this time, because when the little plastic hinge breaks I have to go back to using my old metal one until a new one can ship. Had a week with that old contraption and it doesn&#x27;t curl as well.&lt;br /&gt;I can skip mascara unless out for a fancy evening. The curl is that good and lasts all day.&lt;br /&gt;Best curler ever- just wish they made it in something more durable. Mine last about a year or so. Still worth the price as it eliminates the need for mascara on most days.</li>
    <li> My mother in law bought this for me last April, 2013. It worked fine for a while, then after like 9 months it stopped curling my eyelashes, it was like it became weak or something. Then a few months later the plastic snapped. I know it only lasted 11 months, because I got it in April 2013, and it broke in March 2014.</li>
    <li> I typed in a heated eye lash curler and that is not what I got.  I could have gotten a regular plain eyelash curler anywhere-but I was looking for a heated one by Laura Mercer</li>
    <li> This was a cool curler that seemed to work great but it broke after a couple months of use. It may not be made to be used daily-maybe just as a travel curler.</li>
    <li> I have purchased ten different eyelash curlers and none of them worked very well. I found out about this one by Googling best eyelash curlers. It was number one, so I decided to see if Amazon had any. Totally worth the money. I HATE paying shipping but this product works so well it was worth it. HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!</li>
    <li> I have owned many eyelash curlers &amp; this is, by far, the best. I thought it was electric when I bought it but even though it wasn&#x27;t, it worked awesome. I love the design. It&#x27;s nice &amp; small, fitting easily into my purse.</li>
    <li> I really do love this eyelash curler. I had a similar one, but a different brand, that I loved...this one is better. It&#x27;s compact, so it fits easily into your makeup bag and/or purse easily. If you know how to use it, it curls your eyelashes beautifully.</li>
    <li> It was okay while it lasted--It was made of plastic and it broke within a couple of weeks and I did not want to spend that kind of money again to replace it and have it break again.  I think I read someone else&#x27;s review before I bought this and they also said theirs broke.</li>
    <li> The design is too narrow to reach each end of my lash line.  I have average sized eyes-neither small or large--and this product crimps the middle of my lashes every time while leaving the outside corners straight.  I use the word \\&quot;crimp\\&quot; because it leaves a sharper bend in your lashes than the word \\&quot;curl\\&quot; would indicate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When you open the curler, the outside posts are thick, brown plastic and this further inhibits the ability to determine if the outermost lashes are placed properly.  It is just not practical to spend so much time to manipulate your eyelid around until you are certain you have most of your lashes in the proper position, press, then move the curler down to the end of your eye, press and hope you use the same amount of time/pressure to ensure that the second crimp gives you a uniform bend to match the first crimp.  This curler delivers on sleek compact design, and great lift for your lashes but lacks the width that people with thick lashes from inside to outside corners or those with large eyes may need.  Would love to see this product in two sizes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Leah M. (not Paul, he is my husband)</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work well.  I gave it away</li>
    <li> I ordered this eyelash curler because it was touted as one of the best on the market and I agree. Not only is it easy to use and is effective in curling my lashes, but it isn&#x27;t bulky like other eyelash curlers. When I first received it, it took me awhile to figure out how to open it up but it isn&#x27;t difficult. It just was for me! I&#x27;d suggest this product for anyone who wants a really good eyelash curler.</li>
    <li> I read about this in Good Housekeeping and thought I&#x27;d give it a try. I&#x27;ve never really had much luck with eyelash curlers; maybe there&#x27;s something about the shape of my face? or my eyes? Anyway, this one gets right to the base of my eyelashes and the curl is dramatic and lasting. And to make it even better: it&#x27;s compact and much easier to stash in my makeup bag. I feel crazy gushing about this eyelash curler, but it is wonderful. I&#x27;m getting them for birthday gifts!</li>
    <li> The perfect eyelash curler ... travel size ... can bring it to anywhere you want! Every lady&#x27;s got to have one!</li>
    <li> Awkward to use. I actually thought I was buying a heated curler because this was the first result when I searched for that. I prefer the traditional metal curler to this, although this is nice and compact for traveling.</li>
    <li> This product works great. Curls beautifully, but broke after 10 months of use. Debating on whether or not to purchase another.</li>
    <li> It works quite well, but somewhat difficult to use.  Regular eye lash curler may not curl as well, but easier usage.</li>
    <li> I love how this lash curler makes my eyelashes look.  It takes a little practice to use the curler.  It can be fragile...I am on my third curler as they do break along the side.  I always keep an extra on hand. Despite the fragility, I will continue to use this fantastic eyelash curler.</li>
    <li> Better than other eyelash  curlers on the market.  Very easy to use and compact for transport.</li>
    <li> Works like a charm, no complaints!!</li>
    <li> Amazing product, nice size, best results, very fashion, good brand and fare price to accquire one, just have one in your bag</li>
    <li> What a neat product!  Have been using it for about a year now and still get a great curl each time.  The positioning is a little tricky but not a big problem at all.  There is only one correct way to position it and you soon turn it the right way automatically.  I would highly recommend this gadget to any girl!</li>
    <li> I found this eyelash curler not easy to use. Overall it seems to work well, but not easy to use. I give it a 3 star because I feel the product is good, but not that good.</li>
    <li> I bought this curler in Sept. 2012 and although it took several tries to get used to it, I thought it did a great job. I have extremely hard to curl lashes and my typical curler yanked out my lashes. Unfortunately this curler only lasted 9 months. It appears the spring has sprung.</li>
    <li> It absolutely did not work for me.  Unfortunately, I expected it to work as described, so I destroyed the packaging material.  My bad.</li>
    <li> Best eyelash curler ever</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on this. It&#x27;s not worth it.</li>
    <li> I usually struggle with eyelash curlers and only bought this because it was recommended by Good Housekeeping.  While I couldn&#x27;t say I had fantastic results it is easy to use and the only curler I have used so far that actually indents my eyelashes upwards.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s been a hundred years since I last used an eyelash curler. I&#x27;d never seen this type of eyelash curler before so based on the other reviews I gave it a shot. After I figured out how to use it (the instruction are small print and the ink used for the instructions is almost the same color as the background) it&#x27;s very easy to use however and does a great job.</li>
    <li> I really like this curler.  It holds the curl longer than my revlon old school curler.  Its very easy to use, and I saw other reviews that said it pinched my eyelid....I have never had that problem!  It&#x27;s smaller and more convenient than the typical curlers.  I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Love this little curler.  The size shape and size is just perfect for my small hand</li>
    <li> I saw these in allure mag. Best curlier, doesn&#x27;t cut it break lashes. Great product.</li>
    <li> Works good but this is my 4th one. Your have to be very careful not to break it when using it.&lt;br /&gt;I forgot to list that this curler is for my wife and this is her review.</li>
    <li> Love this! It works better than any other eyelash curler or technique I have ever tried. My lashes are long but straight and it takes several minutes to get them to curl. This curled them super fast. It&#x27;s costly for such a small plastic gadget but well worth the $!</li>
    <li> Would be better if the color of the curler was lighter so I could see where my eyelashes were before I pushed down.</li>
    <li> This little guy really does the trick.&lt;br /&gt;I think it is easier to use than the metal contraption.&lt;br /&gt;My lashes really curl&lt;br /&gt;My lashes stay put all day.</li>
    <li> I am a skeptical consumer, so I did a lot of research on the Laura Mercier eyelash curler prior to purchase. It is highly recommended on both this site and Good Housekeeping.  Still, I remained wary that an eyelash curler could work as well as it claimed to. It is truly a wonderful product.  All these years I have been using the basic Revlon eyelash curler, which is okay, but nothing compared to the Laura Mercier one. Some reviewers don&#x27;t like the small size, or found it took a long time to adjust to it. I found the size to be a bonus. It fits in my hand well, and you can toss it in your purse for touch-ups throughout the day/evening. To use it, you flip out the lever located on the back side, then just push the lever back in when your done. The compact, flush nature of the design means it takes up little room in your make-up bag, compared to the typical curlers. This curler doesn&#x27;t pinch your lid, and you don&#x27;t have to crimp your eyelashes for an extended period of time to get a perfect, lasting curl. I used this product after applying mascara, and I got a &amp;#34;higher&amp;#34; curl that lasted all day. This is a result I never got from my drugstore curler. I definitely recommend this product!</li>
    <li> I was so excited about this curler because it looked great for travelling.  It did curl my eyelashes well, but it broke before I had even had it two months.  Very disappointing!</li>
    <li> Ok, not great. Doesn&#x27;t get close enough fo reach the Linds on shirt lashes</li>
    <li> great product and fast shipping!</li>
    <li> Too small...pinched eyes</li>
    <li> These are the best eyelash curlers! I can&#x27;t rave enough about them! Wonder how long they will last as short of losing it I don&#x27;t think I will have to replace for years!</li>
    <li> It is a bit awkward to work with BUT this is by far the best eyelash curler I have ever had in decades.  The lashes curl super quick and hold until I put mascara on.  Totally worth the price in my opinion</li>
