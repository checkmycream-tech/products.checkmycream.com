<li> I have brush guards for every size brush and use them every single time I wash.</li>
<li> I bought the variety back but all the brush guards were the same size and very small.</li>
<li> I&#x27;m afraid they will slip on my brushes and pull the hair back because they are not very tight.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s hard to find these in stores, so I always order them online.</li>
<li> So disappointed that they were all the same size.</li>
<li> Worst purchase I&#x27;ve ever made online.</li>

    <li> essential and useful article, convenient way to store makeup brushes in good shape especially after washing, they dry quickly in these networks while maintaining the original shape.</li>
    <li> This product is super affordable, and worth every single penny. It works, and is a MUST for anyone who uses makeup brushes. My favorite feature of these brush guards is they make splayed bristles like new again. They also keep bristles well protected during drying, or storing. If you don&#x27;t have them, please don&#x27;t think twice about ordering them. You will not be upset.</li>
    <li> This work very well. Gives my brushes great shape and helps to keep them from fraying.</li>
    <li> This is a good product for traveling and washing brushes. They are a little hard to get on the brush, but if you fiddle with them right you can get them on.

    <li> I bought the variety back but all the brush guards were the same size and very small. Was no variety at all. Wanted to return them but the return policy would come out to me only getting $3 back so I did not bother. If you want to buy it make sure you read all details. So disappointed that they were all the same size. Worst purchase I&#x27;ve ever made online.</li>
    <li> The Brush Guard is such a simple yet elegant idea.  There are a variety of sizes in the pack, it&#x27;s affordable for everyone and it works wonderfully to keep my expensive brushes in as-new shape.  I don&#x27;t know how I ever did without The Brush Guard.  If you invest in good-quality brushes, you absolutely must buy The Brush Guard!</li>
    <li> Bought Brush Guard--Blush Pack . excellent case for brushes. Brush holds its shape very well. The hair does not stick out. Similarly, I will buy more.</li>
    <li> This is the best thing they couldve invented. It protect the brush and maintain their shape. I love this product I heard about the brush guard on youtube. I can&#x27;t live without it....</li>
    <li> This product really delivers - I would highly recommend the entire line of all sizes! After washing and drying upside-down in The Brush Guard, my brushes are all shaped as though they were brand new. Some are even better than when I originally bought them! This has also revolutionized my ability to bring brushes on travel. I always struggled trying to pick just a few brushes that would fit into my travel roll; now I can bring as many as I want and just throw them into a big makeup bag with all of my makeup because the bristles are all perfectly protected in The Brush Guard. I have a feeling I will keep buying these until every single brush of mine has its own Guard! One tip for using the product - these come in many sizes; when drying your brushes, make sure you pick the size of Brush Guard that TIGHLY fits around the ferrule of the brush (you may have to stretch out the Brush Guard to fit it over the handle). If the Guard is too big for the ferrule, you will not get the desired effect and the bristles will stick out of the wire mesh as the brush dries and fans apart. Buy this...you won&#x27;t regret it!</li>
    <li> Perfect for letting my brushes air dry, keeps shape well. Very inexpensive, would totally recommend to friends. Could see my self repurchasing.</li>
    <li> How come I didn&#x27;t think of this??  It&#x27;s a clever idea and an inexpensive way to preserve ,and store cosmetic brushes without taking up space.  Great idea!</li>

    <li> These are great for every day use and especially for travel. They keep brushes in &#x27;like new&#x27; condition.</li>
    <li> This product does the job in protecting my make up brushes. Just make sure that it doesn&#x27;t slide down or your brushes will have fly aways.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m so glad I heard about these!! Cleaning my brushes has never been so easy!! They were shipped all the way to Guam, and so quickly!!</li>
    <li> I like this product especially when I go traveling. It protects my brushes from damage to the bristles even the brushes that I store permanently.</li>
    <li> These brush guards have saved my makeup brushes. I purchased these guards after a wayne goss review a few years ago....absolutely incredible.</li>
