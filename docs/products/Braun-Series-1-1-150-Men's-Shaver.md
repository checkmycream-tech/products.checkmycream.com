      <li>I had an entry level Braun shaver years ago that worked great, but Braun doesn&#x27;t make it anymore.  </li>

      <li>I went out and got a Norelco which works great.</li>

      <li>Very nice shave.</li>
      <li>The shave quality is just OK at best.</li>
      <li>It holds a good charge, and shaves well.</li>
      <li>I knew Braun makes good razors, so I wasn&#x27;t concerned with quality.  </li>
      <li>Sideburn trimmer is of a good design.  </li>
      <li>I couldn&#x27;t afford the top-of-the-line Braun, which I feel is WAY overpriced, and this unit does a reasonably good job.  </li>
      <li>You can get a good shave with it and what I do is use it in between razor</li>
      <li>Pros - good battery</li>
      <li>You can still get a good shave.</li>
      <li>Feels good in hand&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
      <li>I loved it.</li>
      <li>So I now have a spare screen, which is a good thing.</li>
      <li>/&gt;- Good Battery: The battery technology in this shaver allows for frequent/regular charging without concerns about shortening battery life, as with ni-cad</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a good budget shaver.</li>
      <li>This is a good shaver for the price.  </li>
      <li>For faces, it has a good width and comfort factors on the foil area</li>
      <li>This does not feel so good.</li>
      <li>I was looking for a good inexpensive electric razor.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used a number of battery powered and rechargeable razors over the years and find them a good value for the money.  </li>
      <li>but once you do, it works fairly well.  </li>
      <li>I bought this one thinking it would be just as good.</li>
      <li>The Braun 1-150 is a good razor.  </li>
      <li>I had the Braun 1175 and loved it.  </li>
      <li>All of them give a good shave.</li>
      <li>The Braun Series 1 1-150 Men&#x27;s Shaver is a budget shaver at a good price.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;First the good.  </li>
      <li>I can get a fairly close shave with it</li>
      <li>If you want a good shave for not-too-much money, it&#x27;s a good choice.</li>
      <li>Good shaver for the money.</li>
      <li>The function of the razor has improved my shaving experience a good deal.  </li>
      <li>am not knocking the 150, but for a LOT more bang for the buck (and a WAY better shave), the M90 is the BEST shaver ever.  </li>
      <li>I am very pleased with the shave I am getting with this Braun 1-150.  </li>
      <li>I am very pleased with my purchase and, would be moreso, if the time to recharge the razor was not 8 hours.</li>
      <li>Good pricing for a really nice shaver.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s quieter and lighter than the 5005, which makes for a more pleasant shaving experience.</li>
      <li>The Braun is great for that and gives a smooth, close shave.  </li>
      <li>would be nice to have a case</li>
      <li>This is an excellent shaver at a reasonable price.  </li>
      <li>WOrks nice for the money..........  </li>
      <li>It gets very close and does a wonderful job.</li>
      <li>If I was going into a meeting, or going out for a nice dinner, I would use a razor.  </li>
      <li>It looks nice but has a problem.</li>
      <li>, it is on demand and there is a nice shaving scene in there as well.</li>
      <li>This shaver does a good job on most face areas but has problems in some.</li>
      <li>Purchased this razor because I owned a Braun Series 1 for 5 years that I really liked.  </li>
      <li>A nice feature for me is that it is dual voltage.</li>
      <li>The shaver gives a nice cut without irritation.</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m sure it would satisfy one and all, good product.</li>
      <li>Nice price.</li>
      <li>The extendible sideburns trimmer is a nice bonus to keep you looking sharp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>This great company really went from a great model to one</li>
      <li>The best thing about the shaver is that it&#x27;s so easy to clean in running water.  </li>
      <li>My daughter loved it for quickly touching up her shaved legs.  </li>
      <li>I have mainly used Norelco shavers because they seemed to work best.  </li>
      <li>But for a good quality, basic shaver, the Braun Series 1 150 is a great buy, and a great shaver.</li>
      <li>Great Razor - A lot of Razor companies forget the man with a full beard.</li>
      <li>Trimmer comes out too easy but works good.</li>
      <li>As I read the customer reviews, I realized many of the inexpensive shavers were almost as good, and I could buy six of them for the price of one of the top of the line models.  </li>
      <li>The reason I bought it is that the M90 I have gives a wonderful, very nearly blade quality shave, but relies on two AA batteries and is not rechargeable.  </li>
      <li>It was fine - seemed a good choice to start using electric shavers and to get used to the concept.</li>
      <li>Perfect for a young beginner who is shaving infrequently still.</li>
      <li>If you have a light beard this would probably be a good choice.</li>
      <li>I started with one leg and it shaved it nice and smooth!  </li>
      <li>Might be a good idea to hold-on to your older unit or have a spare handy!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This is exactly what my husband wanted.  He absolutely loves the shaver.  It lasts forever and such a nice shave.</li>
    <li> I have had this shaver for only about a month. At this point I am pleased with the product. Given my light beard, it does the job well; I would recommend the shaver for men with similar needs. It is probably not powerful enough for heavy beards. Overall, this was an excellent buy for men who don&#x27;t need all the bells and whistles.</li>
    <li> A long time Braun user, I was disappointed with this shaver. Recharges so slow you have to leave it plugged in. Does not shave as close. I paid $7.70 to return it to Braun. Not recomended!![[ASIN:B0017HFWS0 Braun 150 Series 1 Mens Shaver]]</li>
    <li> Good shaver for the money. Get two shaves per charge. Shaved every day for a week and didn&#x27;t get a rash like I usually do with electrics.</li>
    <li> This is a review of the Braun Series 1 1-150 shaver. I have been using the discontinued Braun 1775 for travel, I had read the reviews here several months ago but had forgotten about them yesterday when I bought the shaver on sale at a brick and mortar store. I didn&#x27;t take the time to come home and do my homework. Fortunately, I was able to return it after confirming other reviewer&#x27;s comments. I didn&#x27;t shave with it but just let it charge for 18 hours.    Specific negative issues:  - requires 8-plus hours for charging and then only provides 20 minutes shaving time. [Since these are advertised values, and in light of the marketing deception noted below, I would not necessarily believe these numbers.]    - lack of a battery CHARGED/BATTERY LEVEL indicator. Be careful, there is a green LED which looks like a proper battery charge/level indicator but has only one color (GREEN). It does nothing more than tell you that the charging cord is connected properly! The LED doesn&#x27;t turn off or turn RED to indicate that the shaver is CHARGED. So you never know when the battery is charged. [It is, in my opinion, deception to sell this product with a battery and charging indicator and not advise the buyer that the indicator DOES NOT indicate CHARGE/BATTERY LEVEL on the external packaging]  - lack of the ability to shave after the battery has gone dead. So basically if you want to be sure that you can have enough battery for a shave, you MUST LEAVE IT PLUGGED IN AND CHARGING ALL THE TIME. [It is, in my opinion, deception to sell this product without warning on the external packaging that you can&#x27;t shave with it if it isn&#x27;t charged.]    If you travel internationally, as I do, and you don&#x27;t always have daily access to charging outlets. Or if you forget to plug it in, this product could leave you high and dry to start your day unshaven.     I don&#x27;t know who Braun is marketing this product towards but I suspect from reading the other reviews that it is aimed at impulse buyers and gift purchasers who will not be willing or able to return the product. This has left a distinctly negative impression of Braun. Thank goodness for Amazon Reviews!</li>
    <li> I had an entry level Braun shaver years ago that worked great, but Braun doesn&#x27;t make it anymore.  The new Series One is a worthless piece of junk.  It shaves very poorly, and I do not have a heavy beard at all.  It does not shave closely and just won&#x27;t cut some of the hairs on my face, no matter how often I go over them, even with the trimmer!  The battery doesn&#x27;t hold charge for more than one or two shaves, and takes a long time to recharge.  On top of that, you can&#x27;t plug it in and keep shaving after the battery runs down like you could with my old Braun Shaver.  I&#x27;m very disappointed and can not recommend this shaver.</li>
    <li> Bought shaver as a gift for my middle age son.  It would not cut close, yet irritated his skin.  Would not cut well around lips and chin.  Thoroughly cleaned it up and returned it for credit.  Would not recommend this shaver.</li>
    <li> this razor did not shave close and you had to go over beard several times just to get a fair shave. i&#x27;ve returned the razor to braun under their 60 day satisfaction guarantee. shipping was quick and i&#x27;m pleased with amazon!</li>
    <li> Excellent seller and transaction.  Decent price.  Shaver works well but only on battery power.  If battery is drained, the unit must first be fully charged before using.</li>
    <li> While nothing seriously wrong with the shaver, it simply doesn&#x27;t stand up in speed and precision of cutting compared to a cutter block style razor.  I overcharged and killed the battery so I started using my old Braun 4775 washable.  I could notice the smoother, quicker, movement instantly.  It just seemed to take less effort to get the shave completed.  I do not have a ton of facial hair and I still found this model wanting.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my Father. I bought it because other reviews said they never got nicked while using. My Father is on blood thinners and should not cut himself. After he tried it he said it was the best shaver he ever had. He shaves every day now, he never did that before because he hated shaving. Now he doesn&#x27;t mind. He thanks me alsmost every day for buying this for him. I bought it because of the reviews I read about it on Amazon.</li>
    <li> Pros - good battery so far, not very loud    Cons - Doesn&#x27;t cut my hair. I have to go over each spot on my face 5 times to get the scruff off... and I don&#x27;t even have very thick hair! No matter how hard I try the shaver still misses hairs.</li>
    <li> do not waste money on this item.  pic is deceiving, there&#x27;s only one blade.  not very smooth. never again. just a waste of money. like they say you get what you pay</li>
    <li> This shaver does a great job. It is a bit louder than I am used to, but its a great value for the money.</li>
    <li> Have been a Braun user for over 25 years...mostly mid-range price units. Bought this as a backup unit for about $30. The unit is an underpowered bust. The first time Braun has let me down.</li>
    <li> This is a great shaver for the price.  Didn&#x27;t normally use an electric shaver prior to this purchase, but am finding out I&#x27;m using it more than my blade razor.  The only difference I&#x27;ve noticed is that I have to shave more frequently with the electric shaver.  Other then that, it&#x27;s a great shaver.</li>
    <li> This a basic shaver that does the job intended for a reasonable price.  I would buy again.</li>
    <li> This shaver does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to do, gives a good close shave and is light and easy to use.  Initially it caused a little skin irritation on my husband&#x27;s face, maybe due to the angle it was being held, but has worked fine since.  One thing I like is that it doesn&#x27;t leave little pieces of whiskers all over the sink and it&#x27;s light and is ergonomically shaped to fit the hand.  My husband likes it and I&#x27;ve tried it on my legs and it worked well, no nicks or cuts like with a razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It comes with a clear plastic cover that fits over the top of the shaver and the controls.  This makes it nice for traveling because it takes up a lot less space than a larger shaver with a case.  The charge seems to last a half hour or so and it only takes an hour to recharge.  It doesn&#x27;t have a lot of fancy \\&quot;extras\\&quot; like some of the pricier Braun shavers do, but it gets the job done at a reasonable price.</li>
    <li> I gifted this shaver to my brother-in-law, who is a veteran with electric shavers.  As a Norelco 3-head shaver user, he was a bit weary of this basic electric shaver from the start.  However, he gave it a fair shot and could come up with only one positive thing to say about it.  Here are the CONS and PRO:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS&lt;br /&gt;- Loud as a Hedge Trimmer: Seriously, this shaver is much louder than any other electric shaver my brother-in-law has previously used.&lt;br /&gt;- Poor Shave: My brother-in-law has a thick/coarse beard, and he said that he could not get a close shave with this shaver even when he pressed it hard against his skin.  With much less effort, his Norelco 3-head shaver gives him a very close shave.&lt;br /&gt;- Pile of Whiskers: Unlike other electric shavers that hold the whiskers, this shaver causes your whiskers to fall straight down from your face.  If you are over a sink, this might be OK.  However, it is a bit odd, and you must be aware of where your whiskers are dropping.&lt;br /&gt;- Impractical Cleaning: One of the selling points on this razor is that you can open up the screen on top and run the blades under water to clean them.  While this might be true, you would have to leave the shaver open someplace to let it dry out afterwards.  This is not very convenient.  It is like washing laundry when you don&#x27;t have a clothes dryer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PRO&lt;br /&gt;- Good Battery: The battery technology in this shaver allows for frequent/regular charging without concerns about shortening battery life, as with ni-cad batteries.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are considering this shaver, save your money and consider other entry-level shavers that are more highly rated.</li>
    <li> I have had several Braun shavers in the past and this is by far the worst one I&#x27;ve ever used. My last one broke that I&#x27;d had for 5+ years and I switched to another brand. I wasn&#x27;t satisfied and decided to try the Braun Series 1. Bad mistake. This shaver doesn&#x27;t cut as smoothly as the others I have used. It also takes 3-4 times as long now to shave than before. The holes in the screen seem to be smaller and they aren&#x27;t irregular shaped as in the past. All of this contributes to a shave that takes longer than it should. I&#x27;m one of the lucky men who can go 3-4 days without having to shave and have never had problems with past Braun shavers. This is not true now. Even shaving the next day with the Series 1 is a chore.</li>
    <li> I have used a Braun1775 for years. I bought this one thinking it would be just as good. What a surprise! It must be because Proctor and Gamble bought the company. It does not recharge correctly - it actually stopped running while I had it plugged into an outlet! I wrote to them and complained about this. They made some vague reply which did not sound like that they had any intention of trying to repair or replace the unit. Then the foil started to become loose and fall off while I was in the middle of a shave. So I went back to use my old nearly warn out 1775. I only use the Braun Series 1-150 trimmer as the one on the 1775 has become dull.</li>
    <li> I purchased and belived that the seller is AMAZON, I found the shaver is the worst one I ever purchased during last 50 years! I tried to replace it by better one after 20 days of purchase, the seller  \\&quot; Imperial123\\&quot; refused because I used it!! How can I know that it is bad if I do not try and use it???[ASIN:B001FA1F8K Braun Series 1  1-150 Men&#x27;s Shaver]]</li>
    <li> I needed an inexpensive electric razor to replace my old Braun.  This one is very similar to my last.  It&#x27;s not fancy, but does the job I need it to do.  If you are looking for a simple electric razor, this model isn&#x27;t a bad choice.</li>
    <li> Second Braun I&#x27;ve purchased. Earlier model seemed to have more RPM (power). Works ok, but is lacking in performance. You get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> So far I have been very satisfied with the quality of shave that I am receiving. The function of the razor has improved my shaving experience a good deal.  Don</li>
    <li> For the money, I don&#x27;t think you can beat this razor. After 35 years, I shaved my beard and began tearing up my face with a blade. I purchased the series one because I didn&#x27;t want to shell out big bucks if electric wasn&#x27;t right for me. It shaves virtually as close as a disposable razor and any battery life issues haven&#x27;t affected me in the least. If you&#x27;re not a road warrior, this shaver will make you a happy camper and not empty your wallet.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this for a couple weeks and was at first disappointed.  It didn&#x27;t cut my 2 to 3 day old beard and I thought it was a piece of junk - but like I said a 2 to 3 day old beard...  I&#x27;m lazy, alright?  So I tried shaving every day and it does a wonderful job.  I expect anyone with a tougher, faster growing beard may have trouble with this unit.  Since using it on a daily basis and with my normal beard it does just fine.</li>
    <li> Husband tried this.  Did not cut very well at all.  Took three times what his last shaver took and then still had to finish up with a razor.  Felt like it might be defective so I returned the item.</li>
    <li> I am very happy with this shaver. I had a three head shaver and this one is faster and a closer shave.</li>
    <li> It looks nice but has a problem. It will not cut facial hair. After 5 attempts to shave I was left with the same stubble I started with. The worst part I bought it based on a consumer magazines recomendation. Went back to my old Norelco. While not perfect it will take off some hair. How do I get my money back? Cost about $35 worth $0.</li>
    <li> for many years i used a top-of-the-line braun foil shaver. in fact, it lasted at least 15 years.  when i had to finally replace it, naturally i went braun--my old razor was great.  i read the reviews and picked a modestly priced razor and it is the equivalent of shaving with a disposable one.  it pulls and it barely shaves. i have to go over the same place again and again to get even a semblance of a shave.  if you have a very light beard and no real tough shaving areas, only maybe would this be the shaver for you.  do yourself a favor and go up the line. don&#x27;t do what i did, do what i&#x27;m telling you!</li>
    <li> Wife used Braun 3612 for years, it was the only shaver that actually worked. Bought this Series 1 thinking it was capable of producing the same results. I was wrong. Tried it on my beard, it powered down caused by resistance to load, failed! Worst design shaver ever!</li>
    <li> Had for 3 months, used maybe 6 times and now it will not charge nor run off ac adpater plugged in. Takes 8 hrs to fully charge and when it did work, could get maybe 1 and a half shaves per charge. Why would you manufacturer and release a POS like this?</li>
    <li> Replaced a similar Braun with this new one.. liked the old one like this one as well.  Very nice shave. I&#x27;m totally pleased..</li>
    <li> This shaver is great. I had bought another brand, but it irritated my skin. This is a pleasure to use.</li>
    <li> Hubby is not happy with this razor.  He is accustomed to using a Norelco but his Dad told him to try this one.  ALL WHISKERS ARE NOT THE SAME!!  Maybe for someone without a lot of gray whiskers or maybe for teen guys this will work; I don&#x27;t know.  After trying this for a week he gave up and went back to his old Norelco.  I figured I didn&#x27;t have much to lose so I tried it on my face and was still unimpressed.  I am a woman but either I have some fierce facial hair or this razor just can&#x27;t do the job.</li>
    <li> Good for long hair on your face not to good for lil hairs.. but I give it a 70% efficiency.</li>
    <li> Two years abo I bought a node l Series 1-150, Color black and gray. I loved it. It took 1 hour to charge the new silver one tales 8 hours to charde. The new silver one had the foil head fall off two times, so I am real carefull now every time I shave. I am going to replace the foil ans cutter on the older model, the black and gray one and just retire the new model. This great company really went from a great model to one they they have now will cause them to loose sales of the more costly models.</li>
    <li> I had high expectations for this shaver. Its predecessor -- the Braun 1775 FreeControl -- was the best electric shaver I&#x27;ve ever used. But the cost of a replacement foil and new cutter is so high that it seemed to make more sense just to buy a new shaver. Because the Series 1 Model 150 and the 1775 occupy a similar place in the Braun product line, I expected the 150 to be at least as good a shaver as the 1775, if not better. Unfortunately, as it turns out, it doesn&#x27;t even come close to the 1775&#x27;s quality in any category.  First, the Model 150 seems flimsier and cheaper than the 1775. Both shavers are the same weight (162 grams), but the Model 150 is bigger and it just feels cheaper and flimsier. The 1775 had a rubber grip that was comfortable to hold, while the Model 150 is smooth plastic all around. The foil guard on the 1775 was thicker, and attached with a firm \\&quot;snap\\&quot; that let you know it was secure. The plastic foil guard on the Model 150 is thin, cheap, flimsy, and doesn&#x27;t attach securely to the shaver.   The Model 150&#x27;s other deficiencies wouldn&#x27;t be as bothersome if the shave quality redeemed the unit, but it doesn&#x27;t. The shave quality is poor to mediocre. It&#x27;s comfortable enough, but it doesn&#x27;t cut as close or as thoroughly as the 1775 did. I have to make many more passes, which means it takes longer to shave.   It goes downhill from there. The rechargeable battery in the Model 150 is a piece of junk. The speed of the motor drops off soon after the shaver is charged, and then gradually gets slower throughout the remainder of the charge cycle. What&#x27;s more, the charge doesn&#x27;t last anywhere near as long as it did with the 1775. And for some inexplicable reason, Braun has replaced the 1775&#x27;s single, convenient on/off toggle switch with two switches--one to turn the shaver on, and a second one to turn it off.   The charging light on the Model 150 is close to being completely useless. On the 1775, when the shaver was plugged in for recharging, the charging light glowed until the battery was recharged. When it was fully charged, the light turned off. On the Model 150, the charging light stays on constantly, regardless of the charged state of the battery. Essentially, it&#x27;s no more than an indicator light to tell you that the shaver is plugged in to the charging cord. Well...I know when I&#x27;ve plugged in the shaver, so that light is about as useful as a drag chute on a parade float.  Worst of all, the main reason why I bought the Model 150 was because of the charging cord. I had assumed that it would enable me to use the shaver plugged in if the battery is low, just as it did on the 1775. Nope...the shaver does NOT run on power supplied by the cord; it runs only on the battery. If the battery isn&#x27;t charged, the shaver doesn&#x27;t work. That makes it no better than those idiotic shavers that don&#x27;t have any cords at all, and have to be plugged into wall-wart charging stands.   What that means, of course, is that the useful life of the shaver is limited by the number of charge cycles in the battery. The purpose behind such designs is obvious; by tying the entire operation of the shaver to the life of the battery, the early obsolescence of the shaver is guaranteed. If you can&#x27;t run the shaver off the cord, the whole thing goes kaput when the battery finally dies, forcing the user to buy a replacement. For my part, that replacement will NOT be a Braun shaver.   Shame on Braun for killing the Braun 1775 FreeControl shaver and replacing it with the Model 150. I have always been happy with the quality of Braun products in the the past, but this cheapening of what once was an excellent product is inexcusable. I am sorely disaffected by my ownership experience with the Model 150, and I am far less likely to consider buying ANY Braun products in the future.</li>
    <li> I bought this shave as it was suppose to have the same shaving screen and the Braun \\&quot;Mobile M90\\&quot;.  Well... It doesn&#x27;t!  The reason I bought it is that the M90 I have gives a wonderful, very nearly blade quality shave, but relies on two AA batteries and is not rechargeable.  My hope was that the 150, rechargeable, had the same screen and blade as the M90 (which the Braun website says it does..., only... it doesn&#x27;t).  What a huge disappointment!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried a bunch of electric shavers.  The Norelco was the best (until the M90), but head life was terrible and replacement cost was nuts..  The 150 does a fair job, and compares with the Norelco, not a bad shaver.  It is rechargeable, but noisy and slow compared to my now HANDS DOWN favorite Braun M90, and does not do nearly as good a job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am not knocking the 150, but for a LOT more bang for the buck (and a WAY better shave), the M90 is the BEST shaver ever.  Replacement cost for the whole shaver when the screen wares out is less than the cost for the screens for most other shavers.  I can live with the AA batteries (which last a long time, longer than I expected) and their cost for the shaves I get.  I am a life long blade user.  My blade razor and all the junk that goes with it is now in moth balls.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Trust me, if you want the best electric shaver on the market, the M90 fills the bill.</li>
    <li> I purchased this electric razor to replace the Sunbeam Golden Glide I had been using for the last 53 years.  I prefer a blade and shave cream but like to use the electric razor now and then.  I am very pleased with the shave I am getting with this Braun 1-150.  Once my face got used to it, it gives me a very smooth, close shave.  In fact, I have not used my blade razor since I got it.  I particularly like using the trimmer to keep my sideburns straight.  I am very pleased with my purchase and, would be moreso, if the time to recharge the razor was not 8 hours.</li>
    <li> This shaver is junk.  I should have returned it as defective.  I have owned 2 braun shavers in the past and they worked good.  Please don&#x27;t buy this one.  I bought a panasonic es8243a and I love it.  It works literally and I am not kidding 30 times better.</li>
    <li> this shaver get a very close shave but has a hard time with long hairs and a battery life of 20 min but all in all not bad</li>
    <li> Have owned previous Braun Series 1 shavers.  This new generation is far inferior to previous models.  The motor seems weaker and has doubled my shaving time.  Gave it to my 16 yr old son who said the side burn trimmer works great.  May be worth spending and looking at next step up if you want a good shave.</li>
    <li> I purchased this razor for my husband. After one use he has not used it since. Says it does not shave close at all and does not remove all facial hair. i am also disappointed the Co. I purchased the shaver from would not accept a return if package has been opened. i wonder....how are we supposed to know how the product functions if we don&#x27;t open the pkg.? And, if we open the pkg., product does not perform to our expectations we cannot return it. i feel Amazon should reconsider using this company as another way to purchase. Return policy is not a policy at all. Customer loses all the way around. Am stuck with a poor quality shaver which will probably end up in the trash.</li>
    <li> Be careful with this shaver- the Gillette pricing strategy of low cost shavers with replacement parts at nearly the cost of the shaver is in full force here. The foil bends easily and will need to be replaced - Amazon&#x27;s Shacer price is $31 and the foil and blade replacement is $26.     I agree with the reviewer who said to use this as a back-up, travel shaver or to trim the 5:00 shadow. Everyday shaving will cost you with replacement parts.</li>
    <li> Awesome product and price and it&#x27;s functions are incredible. It&#x27;s size in very comfortable and you can carry it everywhere!!!!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t do many reviews unless I find something I really like or really dislike. The Braun 1-150 I really dislike. I always have trimmed facial hair and like the single foils for getting in tight areas. I have used Braun single foil shavers for 30 years +or- and have always gotten a decent shave. Previously went through two 3612&#x27;s and when the last one quit holding a charge I went back to Braun. I have had this shaver for a year and have replaced the cutter/foil but it has never given much of a shave. As other reviewers have noted you have go over the same area many times to get it to cut, and that&#x27;s only if you use the trimmer to cut the hairs as short as possible first. I do have to say the trimmer does work pretty good for mustaches, sideburns, etc. I just recently purchased the Panasonic ES-SA40-K and it blows this one away. I see they have a replacement model for this shaver now. Hope it&#x27;s better but I&#x27;ll stick to my Panasonic.</li>
    <li> It is the 4th or 5th Braun that I have owned. This one is only 90 days or less old!  This one is absolutely the worst! It acts like it is tired with a very limited battery capacity.  Frequent charges only help slightly.  The long hair trimmer worked well on the last type l Braun, but this one is nearly helpless with long hair.  Would not recommend it to anyone!</li>
    <li> I had the Braun 1175 and loved it.  The new one is TOTALLY INFERIOR.  I&#x27;m going to have to buy something that works.  zero stars.</li>
    <li> This was the second one I bought.  I bought the whole shaver because the replacement blades are so expensive that you can get a whole new one for just a few dollars more.  If you bear down on your skin, the screen on the cutter can come right off the unit, which is very inconvenient.  Also, this shaver also does not cut long hairs well at all--you may have to use the trimmer to get them shorter.  On the plus side, the battery life is super.  In short, you should get a better one if you have the big bucks.  If you don&#x27;t, this one will get the job done.  You can still get a good shave.</li>
    <li> I owned this electric shaver for only 9 months before it failed completely.  I plugged it in to recharge overnight, unplugged it and tried to turn in on to use the next day, nothing.  Show over. Totally dead.  I never used in with water or rinsed it with water.  I buy electric razors to use and last for years.  This razor doesn&#x27;t make the cut, pun intended.</li>
    <li> I bought this razor yesterday to shave off 5 days of growth. It took a while but it did the job. I&#x27;ll keep the safety razor in the cabinet.    A nice feature for me is that it is dual voltage. I can charge it at home and throughout Europe.</li>
    <li> Bought this Braun after reading reviews and....it IS cheap, it IS comfortable, and it DOES quit shaving closely after a month or so. I do all the maintenance stuff as is recommended, but unless you have a light beard I&#x27;d probably go somewhere else. The trimmer is mediocre. Longer hairs cannot be shaved with this unit unless the hairs choose to commit suicide and sneak on it there with the blades.  Since I&#x27;m cheap I continue to use it, but finish up shaving with an old double-foil Remington I still have. Now that&#x27;s a close shave.</li>
    <li> i bought this because of the reviews.  all in all, it works well but does not work well on my neck and misses some hairs on my cheek.  it does take a week or two for your face to get used to it but once you do, it works fairly well.  i do like it and do use it, but \\&quot;as close as a blade\\&quot; it is far from.</li>
    <li> First of all, let me tell you that I am a Braun guy. Have always owned Braun&#x27;s, and my next razor will likely be a Braun.  However, DO NOT BUY this model from Braun. It is extremely cheap. Yes it is inexpensive, but be assured that the low price is not worth the headache.   The main problem: The foil that covers the blades is extremely fragile and will eventually break, leaving a hole with the blades exposed...often exposed to your face. This does not feel so good. I am now on my third unit(I got the warranty from Kmart). However, at this point, I am going to treat it like a disposable razor and the garbage can will be its next resting spot.   Seriously, for 30 bucks, it may sound like a good deal, but do not be fooled. Spend the $100, and get something that will last more than a couple months.</li>
    <li> I received the Braun 150 in short order. I have shaved with Braun Razors for over 25 years. They have all been great products up to now. The new Braun 150 actually pulled my whiskers, worse on upper lip, such that I stopped using it.  I contacted Braun&#x27;s customer service and was sent a new screen and cutter bar. It works fine now. I tried using the old screen with the new cutter bar. Shaved O.K., so the cutter bar must have been the culprit although I couldn&#x27;t see anything wrong with it. So I now have a spare screen, which is a good thing.</li>
    <li> have used this product for at least the last 10 years and it is almost perfect.  my only complaint is the replacement price of the shaver head which is almost 2/3 the price of the shaver.</li>
    <li> as always braun products are great. this one shaves well and battery charge lasts a long time. no complaints for now</li>
    <li> Like this product very much. Have been shaving with Braun my entire life. I would never change. The only downside of this model is the 8-hour charging time, but I don&#x27;t care. Just plug it while I sleep. It lasts a VERY long time on one charge thou. You could not shave for a year and then shave on one charge easily.</li>
    <li> I had been using manual razors for over 20 years, but decided to give electric shavers a try since I was not getting a close enough shave. I researched electric shavers and finally bought this at a dept store. It was fine - seemed a good choice to start using electric shavers and to get used to the concept. The performance was good - I used it for 18 months at which point the blades began to get dull. The manual states to replace the blades after 18 months anyway. Now the replacement blades are expensive and so, I foolishly decided to buy a new razor set. Big mistake. I bought the second one from another dept store and I am dissatisfied with the job it does. I have found the quality of shave to be very poor. It requires many passes to get a close shave and if the stubble is long, a few hairs are left behind. I have to use the pop-up trimmer in such cases. I am not sure if the difference in quality was due to the difference in the dept stores, but why would a Braun product differ in quality between stores ? It was a good buy for me the first time around especially since it helped me get used to an electric shaver. Now however, I am going to change to a different shaver - possibly a different brand. If I had written this review for my first one, I would have given it a 3 or 4 star (especially considering the price), but now it merits a 2 at best. Buy it if you want to get introduced to electric shavers, but after 18 months which is the life of the blades, it could be better to junk it and go for a different razor.</li>
    <li> Great Razor - A lot of Razor companies forget the man with a full beard. This Razor has only a single edge and that is exectely what you need to get close to a beard. Everybody else uses a gimmick of muti-edges or blades when only one is all you need. Greatest electric Razor Ever.....</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using one of Braun&#x27;s more fancy shavers for several years now, so getting the 1-150 was an opportunity to have a travel shaver that I could compare to the performance of my home shaver. Prior to the Braun I used Remington Microscreen shavers, which were okay but would wear out pretty quickly, and the replacement blade assemblies were a very significant fraction of the cost of the shaver!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(I should note that I have an extremely tough beard; I blunt the disposable razors in less than one shave)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, the Braun 1-150 performed quite well. It&#x27;s significantly smaller and lighter than my Braun Activator, and I have to say that the \\&quot;rinse under faucet\\&quot; cleaning approach is a major advantage compared to either the Activator&#x27;s dedicated cleaning assembly or the old fashioned \\&quot;carefully whisk out every part of the head with a miniature brush\\&quot; approach.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As I would expect, the 1-150 gave me a good reasonably close shave, ran pretty quietly, and lasted longer than its charge statistics indicated. I didn&#x27;t bother recharging it at all during a three-day trip and it was still running fine when I got home and tried it the next day, which indicates about 40 minutes of shaving. Its trimmer bar also extends considerably farther out than the Activator&#x27;s, which I find convenient.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The disadvantages were relatively minor. The smaller size and construction makes it feel slightly flimsy and less well balanced than the Activator, and it doesn&#x27;t seem to give me quite as close a shave as its larger relative.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still, this is a good shaver, excellent for travel use. I&#x27;ll be keeping this one in my suitcase for all my business trips.</li>
    <li> First of all my Vine choice came a bit too late for me as I&#x27;ve owned a new Braun for a couple of months now. I used to have a Norelco triple header rechargable, but the battery finally gave out. I bought the Braun 1775 Free Control from Braun as a replacement.  It listed for about ten bucks cheaper than the one I&#x27;m reviewing, but with discounts the reviewed one only costs about two bucks more. When my shaver gave out I started to look at the really expensive super models, and was shocked at the prices. As I read the customer reviews, I realized many of the inexpensive shavers were almost as good, and I could buy six of them for the price of one of the top of the line models.  My comparison will be between the one I bought (1775), and this new model (1-150).    I decided to do the taste test \\&quot;so to speak\\&quot; first, so I let my beard grow a couple days.  I have a somewhat sparse, wirey beard, with very soft skin underneath.  I had both shavers take a half of my face, and shave for 25 seconds. Before starting I cleaned the older one, and oiled it, it may have lost some sharpness, but probably not that much. After the test I looked in the mirror, and felt the two sides of my face.  The 1-150 was definately smoother. Neither razor had pulled, burned, or chaffed my skin, and handling was similar. I really can&#x27;t totally account for the smoother shave with the 1-150, so we&#x27;ll have to take it to the differences, and see if that makes sense.    To start with, both shavers use the same kind of blade, have the same width and use the same trimmer.  There was one significant difference in the head, and it may have made the difference. On the 1775, the older shaver, the foil flexes (both are foil shavers), and the head holding it floats. On the new shaver the 1-150 the foil itself both flexes and floats, the head is rigid.  This may account for the closer shave, but maybe is slightly less comfortable.    Additional Comparison:      1. The 1775 has rubberized grip coating on the base,the 1-150 does not.     2. The 1775 is shorter, the 1-150 is thin, long, a bit sleeker.    3. The 1775 has a triangular on/off button, the 1-150 has separate on/off buttons a bit smaller and harder to find.    4. The 1775 charging lamp is on the back, the 1-150 on the front.    5. The blade keepers are similar but the 1775 is a better fit.    6. The sound is a bit higher pitch on the 1-150 over the 1775.    The bottom line is I have a slight preference for the 1775, except for the quality of the shave itself.  I like the design a little better, the grip, and keeper are better features.  Still overall, the Braun foil shavers in this class gain high ratings, and I&#x27;d be happy to own either.  If you like sleek, you&#x27;ll probably go for the new model (1-150), and maybe the head design gives a slightly closer shave.  If you like simply stated function like I do, the 1775 might be your backup choice in the same price class.</li>
    <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- Excellent shave on Upper lip, side burns, cheeks, chin&lt;br /&gt;- Very light weight&lt;br /&gt;- Actually makes a SMOOTH shave&lt;br /&gt;- Side Burn trimmer works very well.&lt;br /&gt;- Easy to clean&lt;br /&gt;- Keeps a charge&lt;br /&gt;- Relatively cheap compared to other electric razors&lt;br /&gt;- Feels good in hand&lt;br /&gt;- Impressive wall charge (other companies should learn from Braun on how to design and build a wall charger)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- Compared to razor, sub par when shaving the neck area.&lt;br /&gt;- Unknown on how often I will have to buy replacement foil/head&lt;br /&gt;- Does not work on longer hair (3 days worth of growth)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is my first time using an Electric Razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first night I used it I did not shave for 4 days.  The razor could not handle the long hairs and thought this was going to be the performance every time. So first time using it I gave it a 1 star.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have now have been using it for 2 weeks and every time I learn how to use it better.  It is IMPORTANT to use it at least every 36 hours, otherwise your facial hair will be too long for the unit to cut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shave does a fantastic job on everything except the neck area.  If I was going into a meeting, or going out for a nice dinner, I would use a razor.  But for the weekday work days, it is acceptable, mainly because it does such a good job on the rest of the face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This will now be my new travel razor as I travel about 50% of the time.  I will keep a blade razor for those close shaves under the neck as well as when I don&#x27;t shave for a couple days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: 6/24/2009&lt;br /&gt;The shaver is still going strong.  I have actually now adapted a NEWway of shaving!  I use this electric shaver for my upper lip, whole chin area, and cheeks.  This allow 100% NO NICKS.  Then I use my razor JUST for my neck area.  It is great because now my razors last twice as long since it is only doing 1/3 of the work they used it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never been a fan of electric shavers. They just don&#x27;t give as clean and smooth a shave as I want, and they leave my face dried out. The Braun shaver has not converted me. While I won&#x27;t use it as my main shaver, it will be good for those times when I need a quick shave, or don&#x27;t have access to water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is very convenient to simply be able to wash the blade off under running water, but I have to wonder how that affects the life of the blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall this is an easy to use, workmanlike electric shaver.</li>
    <li> This is a good shaver for the price.  You don&#x27;t get special features such as being a wet/dry shaver as you get with the more expensive models, but it does well for what it does.  You might have to go ahead and pull out the good old fashioned razor to complement this one on occasion as well.  It&#x27;s lightweight and easy to maneuver, but is not extremely flexible.  As others have said, it is gentle on the face and doesn&#x27;t irritate the skin. Overall, it&#x27;s good for the price, shaves adequately and would make a great gift.</li>
    <li> Easy to shave with this shaver, light weight, and is easy to clean. My only problem is that it has to be charged much more often than my old Braun or my old Remington.</li>
    <li> Worked very well, but didn&#x27;t last long  Your requirement for more words is burdensome. Your requirement for more words is burdensome.</li>
    <li> My Son in Law liked mine so much that I got Him one all of his own. It&#x27;s perfect for us Guys without a heavy forest growing on our faces and I&#x27;m sure it would satisfy one and all, good product.</li>
    <li> Here is my original 4-star review, followed by an update explaining why I&#x27;ve dropped my rating to 3 stars:    \\&quot;I&#x27;ve had this shaver (the 1-150) for about 2 weeks and am very happy with it.  I&#x27;m getting about 30 minutes of shaving time per charge.  The shaver takes 8 hours to charge (the one-hour charge time in the Amazon description is for a different shaver, the 1-190).  It shaves as well as the Braun 5-series I used for a dozen years even though the 1-150&#x27;s shaver block isn&#x27;t the multi-foil design.  It&#x27;s also lighter and quieter than my 5-series was, and cost less than half the price.  So it&#x27;s cheaper, quieter, lighter and shaves as well as the more expensive Braun I used for years.  That&#x27;s a winner for me.\\&quot;    Now for the update:  After a few more weeks, the shaver stopped working.  This happened after I fully discharged the battery and plugged it in for a recharge lasting the recommended 8 hours.  Although the recharging light indicated that current was reaching the shaver, it would not turn back on.  After looking again at the documentation, I have a guess about what happened.  There is a yellow single-page insert that comes with the manual which warns that the shaver must be turned off before recharging.  When I first read that, I thought \\&quot;well, duh, who recharges a shaver that&#x27;s turned on?\\&quot;  And of course my fully discharged shaver was not turned on when I plugged in the charger.  But did I forget to hit the off switch, and was that necessary to prevent damage to the shaver?  I don&#x27;t know, but if that&#x27;s the case, the design is defective.  I&#x27;ve returned it for a refund and will go back to my heavier older Braun which is still working fine (I only needed to order a new cutter block and foil for it).</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had a Braun before and it still works 6years later but needed a new foil.   Since the new foils cost over half the cost of this Braun shaver, it was a no-brainer.    The shaver arrived in less time than stated and came with a charge so I shaved right out of the box.   After working with it a while, I can shave almost as close as a blade.    I have shaved for 7 or 8 days without charging and it seems just a few minutes can give enough of a charge for a shave.   The pop up trimmer works well and the unit is very lite.  would be nice to have a case but the one from my old shaver fits fine.   All in all, a great shaver.....see no need for one more expensive.</li>
    <li> Had the previous version of this model and liked it.  This one is somewhat of a disappointment.   It shaves O.K., although a little slow. Sideburn trimmer is of a good design.  The new \\&quot;feature\\&quot; : the current issue of this model cannot be used corded. So if the battery runs down in the middle of shaving you have to wait until you can recharge it sufficiently to finish the shave.  Also, the shaver no longer comes with a zippered case.</li>
    <li> This is my second Braun. The first was the 1775 FreeControl (still in use after 3 + years). I bought the new one as an extra travel shaver, having have had a very positive experience with the 1775. Unfortunately, Braun appears to have cut down big time with the new series 1. These are some of the main differences I have noticed:    -The new series 1 takes about three times as much to charge (16 hours for the first charge and 8 for every additional one vs 5 and 1 hour of the 1775).  -There is no way to know when the series 1 is done charging (with the 1775 the green light went off)  -The new series 1 is significantly noisy when charging - the 1775 was not.  -There is only cordless shaving with the new Braun. With the old one you could shave while it was charging. This is a feature lacking in the new 1 series that is very inconvenient. If you run out of batteries and are not yet done shaving you have to recharge the shaver, and considering it has such a long charging time, the wait is considerable, and if in a hurry not an option.    Other than that, the foil and block are pretty much the same, and perhaps the new series 1 is a little less noisy. If I had known that I could not shave while the shaver was charging, I would not have bought the series 1. If its still available, my advice is to buy the 1775 Braun FreeControl.</li>
    <li> I have never used an electric shaver before in my life, so I can&#x27;t compare it to others.  I&#x27;ve always used those cheap, plastic razors that you get at least 10 to a pack, which have always shaved fine.  I was not really expecting much from this electric razor but was I pleasantly surprised!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It only took me a a few seconds for me to get used to it and get the motion going right.  I started with one leg and it shaved it nice and smooth!  It took several goings back and forth over the same areas but it worked fine.  Then I noticed the little flat shaver doo-dad attached to the back of it.  When I pushed it out it turned on!  Well, I needed to test that part of it too but since I don&#x27;t have a beard to trim I tested it out on my uh-hem.........bikini line.  It did great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s made for a man, but a woman can get just as much, if not more, use out of it.  I couldn&#x27;t care less that it&#x27;s not pink or lavender colored or have some sort of feminine flair to it.  It&#x27;s comfortable to hold in my hand and I like hearing it&#x27;s buzzzzz and listening to the little hairs getting clipped!  I&#x27;m not tossing out my cheap plastic razors, but I think I&#x27;ll be using this thing a lot more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE!!! 10/26/2008 - My husband has now tried it 2 times and the second time his response was, \\&quot;It&#x27;s o.k. but I still have to use a razor blade to get the hairs right here (areas on neck and near his beard).  And look, if we keep using this thing we&#x27;re gonna be increasing our carbon footprint.  I think the best for the environment is to use safety razors.  They worked great.\\&quot;  - His words, as best as I can remember them, if it helps you any in your decision about this shaver.</li>
    <li> This isn&#x27;t a top-of-the-line razor. You&#x27;re not going to get one for this price point.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a pretty solid razor, however, that will get you clean-shaven, moreso than some electric razors I own, but at a somewhat slower pace.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had to shave against the grain of my face for this razor to work well, and it had trouble shaving my neck without the help of the \\&quot;beard trimmer\\&quot;. After learning how not to nick my face with this razor, however, it worked well enough.</li>
    <li> This shaver works well for me. I was surprised that the charge time was so long out of the box (16 hrs), but I gave it about 24 hours worth to be sure. That was two weeks ago, and it&#x27;s still running strong on that initial charge after daily use. I also like that that you can clean it by running it under water. The shave for me has been close, especially when compared to my current wet/dry razor that I only use AFTER I shave with a straight razor. Like any electric razor, I recommend that you use a pre-electric shave lotion or you may end up with bumps and poor shaving results.</li>
    <li> I had read some great reviews on Amazon about this razor and had had really good luck with Braun electric razors prior.  Unfortunately, this one falls into the \\&quot;you get what you pay for\\&quot; category.  It&#x27;s lightweight but is totally ineffective.  It doesn&#x27;t even give me a somewhat close shave after one day&#x27;s of growth let alone anything more substantial.  I have to go over everything with a straight razor which pretty much defeats the purpose of having an electric razor.  I will probably have to end up replacing it entirely with a more expensive model.  Bummer.</li>
    <li> Purchased this razor because I owned a Braun Series 1 for 5 years that I really liked.  This newer model does cut or hold a charge as well. Disappointed with Braun for cheapening their razors.</li>
    <li> This is the worst electric shaver I&#x27;ve ever purchased. Very noisy, doesn&#x27;t do what it&#x27;s supposed to do (i.e., effectively cut facial hair), takes forever to charge and, when finally charged, runs out of juice in less than 15 minutes.</li>
    <li> I had an older braun that I replaced with this.  This shaver is very underpowered and left a lot of whiskers behind (I shave daily).  Don&#x27;t buy it.</li>
    <li> Not a full substitute, but a good supplement.   Safer on the places you might cut with a razor.</li>
    <li> This product is lousy. I shaves horribly. I went out and got a Norelco which works great. Braun offers a 60-day money back guarantee but you have to send it back to the factory in the original packaging. For a $33.00 razor the shipping costs amount to nearly a third of the price so it really is not worth it.[[ASIN:B001FA1F8K Braun Series 1  1-150 Men&#x27;s Shaver]][[ASIN:B001FA1F8K Braun Series 1  1-150 Men&#x27;s Shaver]]</li>
    <li> For sure this shaver is inexpensive but it is not worth the price at all. I got it for two months now and I&#x27;m already back to classic blades as this machine is noteworthy for its inefficience. I had a cheap philips back when I was in France and it was much better. It taked me like 10-15 mins to get a decent shaving with this crap...</li>
    <li> I generally like Braun products, but this shaver was particularly disappointing.  The battery had a particularly short life compared to other Braun shavers and always seemed like it needed to be recharged.  I had to go over areas that missed spots far more frequently than other Brauns.  To top it off, and what ultimately made my decision to return it to Braun for their money back offer was the fact that the trimmer left a streak of blood on my chin while trying to trim my goatee.  I&#x27;ll buy another Braun, just not this one!</li>
    <li> Got this for my dad as a present and it worked like a charm. I have always bought the Braun name and they last a LONG time.</li>
    <li> When I bought this particular razor it was not intended to be my primary razor, but simply to edge straight lines for my sideburns, etc. I use a Norelco triple head for main surface shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used the Braun a few minutes a day and charged it as needed. One day while in use, the battery drained completely. After charging it for 8 hours - it did not come on. It still did not come on after an additional 8 hours of charging. I threw it away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Regardless of the issue with the battery, it did not impress me when it worked. But what did I expect for a $40 razor??? Then again, this razor replaced a Remington that I used for more that 5 years that cost $25.</li>
    <li> The 150 from braun is a big let down fron braun. The shaver takes 8 hours for 20 minutes of shaving time. The shaver will not run with the cord, it is not a cord cordless shaver. the braun 1775  was a much better shaver</li>
    <li> Replaced my older GERMAN Braun Shaver made from strong sturdy metal as the power charger mechanism wore out after over 20 years. This new one is plastic fragile Chinese crap. The foil lasted only a few weeks only and I can&#x27;t even shave with it. Braun promised me a replacement, but it never came. I don&#x27;t anticipate the replacement wil last much longer.&lt;br /&gt;Amazon should replace the shaver. They simply refered me to Braun. Big help Amazon was!&lt;br /&gt;Using a manual shaver currently.</li>
    <li> I got this shaver as a gift to replace my old Braun 1775.  Although the shave itself is adequate, I must say that overall this is a poor replacement for the 1775.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As others have stated, the charge time is ridiculously long.  Add to that hassle, you can&#x27;t use it as a corded shaver while it&#x27;s charging.  Plus, I just can&#x27;t seem to get more than a couple shaves out of it between charges.  So I find myself having to play a guessing game of when I should leave it plugged in charging overnight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ok, it&#x27;s noisy, not a big deal.  What is though, is the foil cap which pops off way too easily.  I have to hold it a certain way while shaving around my neck so that the top doesn&#x27;t pop off.  Really annoying.  The one time that happened, the foil got dented on one side, and now I could only use the other side to get a good shave.  The other time that happened, whoops, right into the toilet bowl.  Nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t have these problems with the Braun 1775.  Consequently, even though that shaver is beaten up and has the trimmer broken off of it, I&#x27;m back to using it until I find a real upgrade.</li>
    <li> Good pricing for a really nice shaver.  Easy to use and easy to clean.  Provides a close shave with little effort.  The very thin foil protects the skin.  Slim head makes it easy to reach difficult to reach places.  Gives about 20 minutes of shaving, and recharges fairly quickly. Plastic shield protects the head when storing or during travel.  I would buy it again !!</li>
    <li> My husband says he really likes this shaver. It holds a good charge, and shaves well. No pulling or dragging.&lt;br /&gt;The only thing he says could be better, is the moustache trimmer. It does not extend far enough, kind of difficult to use.&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise this is a perfect shaver for the money.</li>
    <li> Made a huge mistake switching to a Braun. I have a light beard, yet it takes forever to get a decent shave. The rotary brands are 100 times better than this type. I got so frustrated I took a 3 month razor and smashed it to pieces. Headed out right now to buy the well know rotary I should have bought in the first place.</li>
    <li> This is a very good shaver that is used by my 15 year old son. Quiet and easy to operate. The shaver gives a nice cut without irritation. Perfect for a young beginner who is shaving infrequently still. I would imagine it would be just as good for an adult.</li>
    <li> I find the prices for electric razors absurd in general.  This Braun razor is the least expensive of their product line.  It&#x27;s not perfect, but it does the job.  It is not totally comfortable shaving sensitive areas, such as the upper lip, but it doesn&#x27;t cause redness, either.  I use a blade more than half the time, but it&#x27;s risky to use a blade for those odd hairs that grow on the ears and other uneven places.  The Braun is great for that and gives a smooth, close shave.  I&#x27;ve used a number of battery powered and rechargeable razors over the years and find them a good value for the money.  If you&#x27;re looking for a prestigious product with four forward gears and computer aided parking, this is not the razor for you.  If you want a good shave for not-too-much money, it&#x27;s a good choice.</li>
    <li> Over the years I&#x27;ve owned four Braun electric shavers and have been pleased with each. This unit is about twice as expensive as the one I purchased two years ago, but it does a terrible job at shaving, perhaps because the screen has wider apertures than the previous ones I purchased. What a disappointment! Don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
    <li> My husband just had a slight stroke. He lost the use of his right hand, arm and leg...After about a week he got some use back but was unable to shave with his normal razor...so, in the interim I suggested an electric razor (he&#x27;d NEVER used one before). So, we bought the Braun 150. He is enjoying it immensely...glad we bought it.    Sincerely, Katherine</li>
    <li> I was looking for a good inexpensive electric razor. I love Braun products, I know it only cost $30 but after trying to shave with no success. I shaved with a disposable razor first and tried using the Braun again and it wouldn&#x27;t even take the fuzz the disposable razor left on my face. I would not recommend this product.</li>
    <li> This is a must have for the price. The quality of the shaver for the price is outstanding. It has a close shave in my opinion even closer a shave then a standard razor blade. It also is gentle on the skin, have being that my skin is sensitive this was easy on my face, especially on the tough areas. etc neck and jawbone area what a breeze it glides right through. It also has a little trimmer that slides out which comes in handy for sideburns and in between nose and mustache area. Clean up is as easy as sliding it under running hot water and thats it. Its cordless and battery life is ok. This is an upgrade to a more expensive electric shaver i owned, and its not the price that counts in this matter, this outdid my last shaver!! You wont go wrong with this one.</li>
    <li> I have been using Braun electric shavers for 24 years.  This unit is worse than my 1st Braun shaver from the 1980s.  Issues include:  (i) noisy shaver; (ii) head doesn&#x27;t rotate; (iii) shaving foil surface area is very narrow so have to run shaver over same area on face repeatedly; and (iv) my face looks dirty by 2-3:00 every afternoon because I cannot get a close shave.</li>
    <li> If you want a razor that leaves patches of hair on your neck &amp; face, well then this is the razor for you!! If you like spending 13 minutes in front of the mirror only to end up looking like a meth head, well this is for you!!! This razor is awful..</li>
    <li> used this razor three times now and so far it works fine i have no complaints and would probably order another one at a later time</li>
    <li> I have been using electric razors for about 37 years.  I&#x27;ve owned many in that time, some great, a couple terrible.  I have mainly used Norelco shavers because they seemed to work best.  I&#x27;ve tried Remington, Schick, and bought 2 Brauns in the past, both of which were returned because they did not provide an adequate shave.  Well, Braun has really improved their product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This shaver is very ergonomic.  It is well balanced and works very well when the head is held perpendicular to the skin.  Others have commented on the noise this razor makes.  I think it might make a small bit more noise than my Norelco, but I think the reason is that the motor in the razor seems very powerful.  You can feel the power of the motor as soon as you turn it on.  It cuts very well, does not irritate my skin, the trimmer extends far enough to be useful in every situation you might want to use it, and the razor is easy to clean.  The only deficiencies I have noted are that the battery charge lasts only about a week and no case is included with the razor.  Hardly deal breakers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, this is a great electric razor and I believe it is the best in its price class.  I don&#x27;t think you can go wrong purchasing this product.</li>
    <li> This is just what I expected; a good basic, shaver that does a fine job. It is simple to charge and use. You won&#x27;t need to refer to the instructions. Just plug it in, charge it up and it&#x27;s ready to be used. It comes with charging cord, mini brush wand, and lubricating oil. I cannot attest to how long it holds the charge, nor how long it will run on a single charge-didn&#x27;t see that info disclosed in the manual. The very short (length) trimmer edge works excellently and is much appreciated for keeping up the tidiness of growth between haircuts at neckline or wherever needed.</li>
    <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;+ quick and easy - It does the job - fast.&lt;br /&gt;+ For faces, it has a good width and comfort factors on the foil area&lt;br /&gt;+ smooth shave&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- noisy - this sounds like a loud bee buzzing against your face but it&#x27;s not so bad if you&#x27;re shaving legs.&lt;br /&gt;- blade dulls significantly in 3 months.&lt;br /&gt;- no charging stand but does have a plug-in cord.&lt;br /&gt;- no case.&lt;br /&gt;- price is cheaper elsewhere....&lt;br /&gt;- blades relatively hard to clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;MY Recommendation:  For occasional use, this shaver is fine.  It will not stand up to everyday use, tough beards or long hairs.  You&#x27;ll find same/comparable model on drugstore dot com for $39.99 and they take coupons.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I waited several months after receiving this item to review it.  Just as reviews here reflect, everyone in my household has a different opinion of it.  My daughter loved it for quickly touching up her shaved legs.  Husband hated it for a daily shave, because of the noise, and missed hairs though he admitted it was much better than his ancient phillips shaver (a very basic model).  He did like the ability to water rinse the blade.  After 3 months he complained that the blades pulled on his beard hairs and I believe we just dulled the blades.  I thought it was fine for shaving legs...but I prefer a blade shave too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you do decide to buy this model - do a web search on the model number.  Many stores sell it or a comparable model for less.  It would probably best suit a young man with a light beard or a teenage girl who just loves that smooth leg feeling (everyday).</li>
    <li> This razor blows, for me. I have thick hair and it leaves razor burn every time I use it. I bought it for the office when I didn&#x27;t feel like shaving at home. After trying it I&#x27;ve found the only time I&#x27;ll use it is when I&#x27;m desperate for a shave. Save your money or spend a bit more and buy a real razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*I don&#x27;t think all Braun razors are like this. I think this just reflects this level of razor.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m using Brauns for the last 40 years.   Once I tried a Panasonic and a Norelco but didn&#x27;t like them.  The early  Brauns had a problem with the foil cracking in a few years but the newer models last longer.  Here is what I use the Braun for:  Shaving  Cutting my hair  Cutting my wife&#x27;s hair  Shaving wife&#x27;s legs  Dog grooming (Irish and Manchester terriers).  Works great on all   As for being noisy - please get a life</li>
    <li> I am not pleased with the performance of this shaver... takes me three to four swipes to even come close to a \\&quot;clean\\&quot; shave.  Also the re-charge time of 8 hours is absurd and cleaning is cumbersome and a hassle.</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B001FA1F8K The Braun Series 1  1-150 Men&#x27;s Shaver]] is probably the worst men&#x27;s electric shaver I&#x27;ve used. For starters, It&#x27;s very loud and the vibration is just too much. I can feel the vibrations in my hand, that is when I can actually keep the razor in my hand. Sometimes, it&#x27;s difficult to keep a hold of the razor. And if you&#x27;re someone like me, who doesn&#x27;t grow a lot of hair anywhere on the body, this razor will easily cut you. I used other Braun razors in the past that I could easily give a 5 star rating to but with [[ASIN:B001FA1F8K The Braun Series 1  1-150 Men&#x27;s Shaver]], I don&#x27;t know what Braun was thinking.</li>
    <li> I had my nephew use this shaver and give me his opinion...I tried it on my legs, and uh, that just did not work out.  My nephew said it gives a smooth shave, was easy to clean, and is a simple just plug in and go shaver...which he likes because it&#x27;s easy to keep in his car, or bag, and drag along with him wherever he might find himself staying for the weekend.  The price is good compared to many other shavers, so I can only give this a positive review, without hailing it as the best shaver ever.</li>
    <li> After assuming for years that Braun was the gold standard in men&#x27;s electric razors, I purchased my first one.  This razor simply does not cut my beard.  I have a worn out Remington, which has 3 cutting heads, and it does a much better job.  And I suspect that is the problem.  With one smallish cutting head, this shaver leaves much of my  beard untouched.  I will return it.</li>
    <li> The Braun Series 1 1-150 Men&#x27;s Shaver is a budget shaver at a good price.  It offers a smooth safe shave, ease of cleaning, and a comfortable hand fit.  It plugs into a wall socket for a slow recharge, which may be a drawback for some users and it has no travel case.  And it&#x27;s definitely noisy.  But for me the price and efficency outweigh the incovenience of lengthy charging and noise.  It&#x27;s a good budget shaver.</li>
    <li> This shaver is equivalent to other less expensive braun shavers. It does not produce the quality shave of more expensive shavers but is adequate for the less discriminating person or for those who use electric shavers occasionally.</li>
    <li> I got this for my son who has just started shaving. It is a wonderful shaver for the price. The flip out trimmer does a great job too. It is easy to use and clean and the charge lasts long enough for even a beginner to get done (while putzing around). It has a nice feature which tells you when to change the foil to keep your shave clean. It can be cleaned by just running under the water. It comes with a small bottle of oil and a brush which makes cleaning even easier. It isn&#x27;t too loud. Maybe others received shavers with a motor that isn&#x27;t times correctly. We like it. I wish it had come with a pouch for travel and storage. It&#x27;s so hard to keep the bathroom neat when you have things strung all over.</li>
    <li> I have been using the 3 circle style of electric shaver for over 10 years and it has always done a pretty good job, so when I starting using this I expected similar results; however, after I was done shaving for 5 minutes or so I still had lots of little stray hairs left behind.  I have noticed that longer hair seems to have a real problem with this design, so pre cutting with a trimmer helps quite a bit.  My hair is also not quite as thick as some, so that may be another contributing factor to my inability to get a good shave with this product.  One other thing that I was a little surprised by was the pop-up built in trimmer, when you engage that, the main blade still runs, so as I was trimming my upper lip hair it was pulling at my chin hair!  It does seem pretty well build and fells pretty comfortable to hold, but I would still recommend going with the 3 blade round design because that seems to work much better.</li>
    <li> I guess you have to consider this a place holder review. I have not yet been able to try the product out. The item shipped to me came with the European market power adapter rather than the North American adapter. As a result, I have not been able to charge the razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After the second email to the customer service department for Proctor &amp; Gamble (owners of Braun), I was told that they would be sending the correct adapter (two months ago). A reminder last month that I had still not received the adapter elicited another promise to send the appropriate adapter, and I am still waiting...</li>
    <li> I wanted to like this product. Who doesn&#x27;t hate the feeling of a blade on his face in the morning?    But that feeling is nothing compared to the feeling of spending 10 minutes with this shaver, then resorting to using a blade anyway because you&#x27;d be ashamed to walk out of the house looking the way you do.    The extendable trimmer does a fine job on sideburns. But if you&#x27;re looking for a clean shave, keep looking.</li>
    <li> Sometimes I can&#x27;t help but wonder how certain products get good reviews.  Are they paid, are people just making stuff up so they can have a high review count?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is one of those products.  If you are wondering, is the Braun Series 1 1-150 too cheap and too basic of a model to be any good, the answer is a loud and resounding YES!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recently purchased the Braun 1-150. I have owned the 3 round heads style Norelco razors for years, more out of habit than any loyalty.  I&#x27;ve never really liked them much, but I&#x27;m a work from home father who runs his own business, so shaving is something I jam in when I find spare moments.  The whole sink basin of water and a razor blade just isn&#x27;t an option.  Besides, I have VERY light facial hair (I can go a day without shaving and no one will notice, on day two people will think my face is dirty, not unshaven.)  So, an electric razor is more than fine for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I always by the lower end to middle of the road ones because I can&#x27;t justify a $100+ price tag.  So, the products I am comparing this one to are not out of its league or price range.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought the Braun one night because it happened to be in the same aisle I was in, and my Norelco was overdue for having its blades changed and I think it is starting to die any way.  I knew this wasn&#x27;t a top of the line shaver, but I hoped it would match and maybe slightly improve on my Norelco.  I did not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Braun 1-150 is WAY louder than any Norelco I have owned.  It vibrates in your hand way more than any other razor I&#x27;ve owned.  It does a worse job shaving my face than any razor I have every owned.  In order to get a passable job I have to go over areas of my face several times.  Needless to say, this leaves my face burning even after a nice lotion or after shave.  It shaves worse and burns more than my Norelco with its badly needing replacement blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Those who say cleaning is easy are either full-time maids, liars, or did not read the instructions.  The instructions on page 6 of the manual do say that rinsing the shaver head under hot water is an easy and fast way to keep it clean.  Of course everyone is leaving out Step 2 and I quote, \\&quot;Next, switch off the shaver, remove the shaver foil and cutter block.  Then leave the disassembled shaving parts to dry.\\&quot;  Which leads us to Step 3 (on Page 7), \\&quot;If you regularly clean the shaver under water, then once a week apply a drop of light machine oil onto the long hair trimmer and shaver foil.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Taking it apart and putting it back together aren&#x27;t as easy as it looks.  And, if you are the type to actually bother to add a drop of machine oil weekly, then you are the type who will buy a much more expensive version.  In other words, if you are looking for a solid, middle of the road, no hassle shaver, this is NOT for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In short, I&#x27;m sure Braun makes good electric razors but this one is not one of them.6 of the manual do say that rinsing the shaver head under hot water is an easy and fast way to keep it clean.

    <li> I&#x27;ve been a loyal Braun user for the last 4 years.  I bought a 3 series last year that disappeared on me much to my chagrin and is a story for another time.  In either case, I wasn&#x27;t interested in paying $75 again and decided to get the Series 1 over any of the other brands.    While this razor is much more convenient then your typical razor and blades, it is horrible in comparison to the 3 Series.  My face is more of an upside down egg shape, with my jaw tapering down but with a strong chin and this razor just didn&#x27;t work for me.  My old 3 series could shave my entire face in about 3 to 5 minutes depending on growth and with stops to find random hairs.  This 1 series took twice as long and it never felt or looked like I was getting a CLOSE shave.      Now I figured that this was just due to the fact that it&#x27;s an entry level razor however, I saw a Remington DA 307 for less money and decided to give it a shot since it has 2 foils like my old 3 series and it is almost depressingly superior.      If you are thinking of replacing your current electric razor and/or you are looking to go to a straight electric (Remington, Braun style) over the circular (Norelco style), just skip over this one as it&#x27;ll leave you with a false impression about this style of razor.</li>
    <li> I bought this ($40 at a local drugstore) to replace an old Braun 5005 whose screen had worn through (again). It&#x27;s quieter and lighter than the 5005, which makes for a more pleasant shaving experience. There was no problem getting a close shave, even though I have a heavy beard. The shaver runs on internal (non-replaceable) batteries which, according to the manual, take 8 hours to charge after they&#x27;ve been broken in. The batteries must be charged for the shaver to work; it won&#x27;t run while charging. A charge is supposed to last for about 20 minutes. Surprisingly, they recommend cleaning the shaver under hot running water while it&#x27;s turned on (although unplugged from the wall adapter). Have to see how well that works. The shaver comes with a small bottle of lubricating oil, a brush, and an instruction booklet. Made in China; construction quality appears satisfactory. There&#x27;s also a similar Model 140 that lacks the sideburn trimmer.</li>
    <li> I bought this shaver as a replacement for my model 1175 (which was excellent).  In comparison, this shaver has a much less powerful motor, a ridiculous recharge time (8 hours minimum), and cannot be used with the wall charger if the battery runs down while in use.  About the only thing it is usable for is a quick 1-2 minute touch-up shave.  Don&#x27;t even think about it as your main shaver.  As a loyal Braun customer for many years, this is the last Braun product which I will ever purchase.</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t afford the top-of-the-line Braun, which I feel is WAY overpriced, and this unit does a reasonably good job.  It takes a little longer than my older double-header, but it&#x27;s fine.  The only thing I don&#x27;t like is the fact that once the battery has run down, one cannot use the AC cord to shave...  Might be a good idea to hold-on to your older unit or have a spare handy!</li>
    <li> This shaver gives a very poor shave,  Even after multiple passes significant beard stubble remains</li>
    <li> This shaver is OK because it is cheap.  It&#x27;s not an everyday shaver though.  It&#x27;s best to simply bridge gaps in normal razor use.  I&#x27;ll shave every 3rd day with my razor and use this electric to keep growth down in between.  Otherwise this razor simply won&#x27;t get the job done.  But for 30-40 bucks I can&#x27;t complain about it.  Light, easy to use, but it is noisy though.</li>
    <li> A few yrs back, I picked up a Braun Synchro 7505 from Amazon at an amazing price. That higher end razor never did a good job on my tough beard and I was very dissapointed.  I ended up giving it to a friend.     Some background---I enjoy a nice shave. I shave my face and head daily so I need a workhorse of a shaver. Over the years I have used a Headblade for my head and Mach-3&#x27;s, and even the new Schick Hydro. All of them give a good shave. My electric lineup is a Norelco 4xxx series and Norelco 7xxx series and a Panasonic 7xxx series. All do a very good job with my demanding routine.    So then I get an e-mail from Amazon about the Braun 1-150 at a super price. I figure it&#x27;s been  3-4 years so Brauns technology must have improved, right?  NOPE.  I was excited to get this razor and used it in a variety of ways; dry shave, using Afta, using Lectric Shave and using Shave Secret. This thing will not cut my beard. I&#x27;d go over the same spot on my neck, face or chin in all different directions and the beard was still there.    This is the first time I ever sent a razor back. This is one I would not even give to a friend. If you have peach fuzz maybe it will work, but for me it fails.    I&#x27;ll stick with my current line up, and BTW, using my Norelco 7xxx series or my Panasonic 7xxx series with Nivea Shave Conditioner gives me one of the best shaves ever.</li>
    <li> The battery takes 8 hours to get to full charge &amp; is good for 2 1/2 shaves. The shave quality is just OK at best. My previous shaver, a Remington of the same cost would last for 5 shaves &amp; I got a closer shave. I&#x27;ll use it till it dies then get another Remington.</li>
    <li> good for light beards, will not cut long hair so i use it quickly twice a day and try to not fall behind. Trimmer comes out too easy but works good. Not for heavy beards. Overall, a very comfortable shave, no pulling and just as close as a blade for me, don&#x27;t need lotion anymore. Lasts for weeks of use twice a day on a charge!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve owned Braun shavers for more than 20 years. This one, however, has made me consider switching brands. There are some major drawbacks to this shaver.     * The foil cap has a tendency to not stay on the shaver and pop off while shaving. This is a BIG issue.  * The motor is weak and gets bogged down easily.  * Long recharge time.  * Recharging makes a very high pitched noise.  * Foil replacements are almost as much as the shaver itself.    The shaver is very inexpensive. Guess you get what you pay for.    Having owned this one for under 10 months, the foil is broken and needs replacing. I&#x27;ll not be purchasing a Braun next time.</li>
    <li> Shaving time has increased versus higher priced multi head shaver used previously. (Also a Braun).  Generally OK considering low price.  Washable feature a plus - better than having to buy expensive cleaning tank ($5 - $6) used by top of line models.  Confirms the old axiom: \\&quot;You get what you pay for\\&quot;.</li>
    <li> This is a lower end Braun as is reflected in the price.  It is fine for a quick shave when you don&#x27;t need it to be extra close.  If you&#x27;re looking for that shave that leaves your skin \\&quot;Soft as a Baby&#x27;s Bottom\\&quot;  then this is not the product for you.  If that&#x27;s what you&#x27;re looking for you&#x27;ll need to step up in price with Braun.</li>
    <li> The Braun 1-150 is a good razor.  My only complaint is I am not able to shave when the product is being recharged.  If the battery runs out in the middle of your shave, you&#x27;re out of luck.  Otherwise, the product does a fine job shaving my beard.</li>
    <li> I have used Braun shavers for years.  I needed a cutter foil/replacement, but the price of this razor was only a few dollars more than the cost of the cutter/foil replacement. So now I have an extra razor which includes the foil and cutter!  It shaves jujst as well as all Braun shavers and at $29 was a tremendous bargain.</li>
    <li> I am disappointed with this shaver.  I owned two previous 150 models, and never had a disappointing shave!  This current 150 does not shave as clean or close.  Quality of the unit seems to be of inferior material compared to its predecessor.  I cosidered returning it, but then I would be left with no shaver since I already disposed of my old one.  However, I doubt I will ever buy another Baun from Amazon.com!</li>
    <li> This is an excellent shaver at a reasonable price.  I recommend it without reservation.Well, the only reservation is the fact that it comes without a case.</li>
    <li> I have always used the low end Braun electric shavers because I have found them to give an adequate shave for a low price - good value. This model, however, is a different story. First off, it takes 16 HOURS to fully charge, which is ridiculous (must be old , cheap battery technology). My previous model Braun 1175 recharged fully in 1-2 hours. Secondly, the AC adaptor is for charging ONLY. When you plugged in the old 1175, you immediately had full power available for a shave. Not this one. Thirdly, the motor in this model is severely underpowered and has a difficult time getting through my beard. I never experienced this with any previous shaver.    Bottom line - look elsewhere. Even though the price has increased for this \\&quot;entry level\\&quot; shaver, the value has been seriously compromised. I&#x27;m glad my wife dropped it and cracked the foil, forcing me to shop for another new shaver. I&#x27;m a much happier guy.</li>
    <li> My goal was to get a basic electric, re-chargable shaver and this works.  Ultimately, a blade works best for me because I have a tough old beard but I get tired of the lather, nick&#x27;s and time involved, especially at 6am or so.    After a month of use I remember why I owned and rejected several shavers in my life.  They get dull, they aren&#x27;t that close a shave and the f_&#x27;n screens are easy to poke holes in.  Bottom line, for $30, free delivery and a reasonably quick shave, I&#x27;m happy with my choice, but I did sneak in one blade shave while visiting my son using his super duper, 4-blade gillette and it was oh so sweet, w</li>
    <li> No matter what Braun Electric Shaver you buy, from the cheapest to the most costly, you face will feel like the skin of a BABK, SOFT.</li>
    <li> This Braun Series 1 150 is supposedly the replacement to Series 1 190.  The problem with the shaver is not the shave.  It shaves as well as any for a simple, no frills shaver.   However, the charge time is 8 hours compared to 1 hour for the 190.  AND....if the charge runs out you CANNOT use the shaver while it is  plugged in.   It must charge for 8 hours before you can use it again.  The 190 would at least shave if it was plugged in.  Therefore, if you forget to charge and shaver dies--you don&#x27;t get to shave for 8 hours!</li>
    <li> Bought this when my old Braun shaver broke. The old one was great and worked well for almost 20 years. This new one is of such poor quality that I will never buy another Braun. It does not shave clean and leaves your face sore for hours afterward. Don&#x27;t waste your money on this product.</li>
    <li> I love it for shaving my sideburns and chin the most.  My only complaint is the razor doesn&#x27;t do a great job on my neck.</li>
    <li> Hey I read the reviews and here is mine-- for this little bit of money this shaver is a-ok. This is not your everyday shaver and for the price you shouldn&#x27;t count on it to be. You can get a good shave with it and what I do is use it in between razor shaves for a quick tuneup-and when I go away for a couple of days I take the Braun with me and bada bing-good to go.</li>
    <li> This model is a disgrace to the name Braun.  I have used Braun Razors for many years and have recommended them to many people.  When my previous 6 year old Braun failed I purchased this model because I do not need an expensive, fancy razor with all the bells and whistles.  Just something that plugs in the wall and shaves close is fine. Over the years, I have tried several brands but, when I bought my first Braun 25 or 30 years ago, I could not believe the improvement in quality and the long life of the screens.  I have a rather coarse beard and always use a pre-shave (Lectric Shave).  This shaver is very noisy, plus it does not cut very well.  I can get a fairly close shave with it but it takes a long time going over and over the same areas; something I never had to do with previous Brauns.  It may be satisfactory for someone with a very light beard but do not buy it if you have a heavy or coarse beard.</li>
    <li> This shaver does a good job on most face areas but has problems in some. The recharging is a little weird in that there is no way of knowing when the batteries are fully charged. This has not yet been a problem but may affect the battery life if I use the shaver consistently with too little charge or if I leave the batteries on charge too long.</li>
    <li> Item was exactly as pictured.  I prefer single head shavers, and they are hard to find. Purchased this after receiving the first one; this will be a back-up.  Price was great; delivery fast.</li>
    <li> The Braun Series 1 1-150 Men&#x27;s Shaver is a serviceable electric shaver.  Many reviewers think highly of it so I know that my opinion might not be yours.  However, I must say that I don&#x27;t over care for it.  Would I use it over a standard razor? Probably. But if I had my choice, I&#x27;d use my two year old Norelco XL rotary head razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First the good.  It does a decent job of shaving on the flat areas of the face.  It is built well, is easy hold, easy to clean, and spreads very little \\&quot;beard debris\\&quot; around the sink while shaving.  It keeps a strong charge for at least a half-hour&#x27;s total use before needing a new charge.  Clear plastic cover is a neat alternative to a case and the charging cord doesn&#x27;t take up much space.  I&#x27;d say it is a decent value in the $50 price range.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In this case though I feel the cons outweigh the pros.  Compared with my rotary razor (admittedly twice the price), it does not give as clean a shave.  It doesn&#x27;t \\&quot;pull\\&quot; hairs like a rotary sometimes can (esp. if stubble over a day old), but it requires several passes before it shaves cleanly and can cause skin irritation.  The \\&quot;free float\\&quot; system does not work too well for me.  I have some red patches as I type this in fact.  This is especially true for areas on the chin and neck that aren&#x27;t flat.  It has a hard time getting all of the hairs off my neck area.  Frustrated, I grab my rotary and it trims them with much less of a hassle.  It is also rather noisy and vibrates a bit more than the other razor...a common ill for foil razors I understand.  The precision trimmer blade does not work as well as the one on my rotary and it also takes 4x longer to charge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are on a budget and don&#x27;t know any better, then I am sure you could do worse than Braun.  But if you are like me and a close, comfortable shave is a must, then consider spending a bit more for a better rotary.  I have been using the Norelco models for years and would recommend them without reservation.  Two models in the price range of the 1-150 are the [[ASIN:B000FEGUIM Philips Norelco 7110]] and the [[ASIN:B000FEGUIW Philips Norelco 7140 Cord/Cordless Rechargeable Shaver]].&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Happy shaving!nge of the 1-150 are the [[ASIN:B000FEGUIM Philips Norelco 7110]] and the [[ASIN:B000FEGUIW Philips Norelco 7140 Cord/Cordless Rechargeable Shaver]].    Happy shaving!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had mixed luck with electric shavers in the past, including one Braun that I wore out.  I had decided that I was simply going to use disposable razors when I saw the Braun Series 1 150 shaver.  I knew Braun makes good razors, so I wasn&#x27;t concerned with quality.  My big worry was how well it would fit my face -- my neck is notoriously tough for an electric razor to shave well.      The shaver comes with a charged battery, so I was able to try it out right out of the box.  I was very impressed with the comfort and quality of the shave; I didn&#x27;t have to keep running the shaver over the same part of my face to get a close shave.  The 150 is also easy to clean, and is even washable.    There are a lot of more expensive electric shavers out there -- I have a couple, lying almost forgotten in a drawer in the bathroom.  There are shavers with more bells and whistles out there.  But for a good quality, basic shaver, the Braun Series 1 150 is a great buy, and a great shaver.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Norelco, Panasonic and Braun electric shavers, and found that there is not a huge difference in shave quality among the three.    Norelco, with the rotary cutters, is a bit better at getting hairs which grow in different directions.  Cleaning is more of a hassle, however, and replacement heads are expensive.  My Panasonic ES3041 and this Braun shaver are both cleanable in water, which is a big advantage.  The Panasonic is actually useable in the shower, while the Braun only uses water for cleaning.      The Braun shaver \\&quot;grabs\\&quot; whiskers more than the Panasonic and it feels \\&quot;sharper\\&quot; and even the cutting sound is different.  Both have a \\&quot;floating head\\&quot; which is just a spring-loaded mechanism which I think is just a gimmick. At any rate, the end result is very similar.  I even tried shaving half my face with each of the two shavers, and asked my better half to judge the difference. Results? About the same.    The Braun power adapter works on various voltages and can be used around the world with no voltage adapters, only adapters for the different pin sizes.  The built-in sideburn trimmer does the job.    The Amazon description says 1 hour charge gives 30 minutes of shave time, but the instructions say 8 hours charge for \\&quot;up to 20 minutes\\&quot; of shave time.  I&#x27;ve never really clocked it, but the discrepancy is odd.  The green light on the shaver only means that it&#x27;s plugged in--it does not indicate that charging is complete, which would be more useful.    The best thing about the shaver is that it&#x27;s so easy to clean in running water.  You can even use soap on the shaving head.  I&#x27;d like to tell you that one of the shavers is a standout, but I&#x27;d be lying.  I can say that the Series 1 - 150 is not remarkably better or worse than most other electrics, and still not as close as a blade.</li>
    <li> I guess it takes a bit of getting used to, but for what it is the Series 1 150 is what I would assume to be an \\&quot;average\\&quot; electric shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The performance seems nice so long as there&#x27;s not much growth to deal with. It performs miracles at mowing down short stubble and does so comfortably. This razor holds a charge well and is lightweight and simple to operate. The extendible sideburns trimmer is a nice bonus to keep you looking sharp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Included is a starter container of lubricating oil as well as a cleaning brush and a protective cover for the foil as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Series 1 150 provides a smooth shave at an affordable price. If you&#x27;re looking for a rechargeable electric at a decent price I would say this should be sufficient, especially if you&#x27;re a daily shaver. I haven&#x27;t much heavy growth, so when I let mine go a few days I just have to mind longer whiskers to make sure I get them into the foil is all, but that&#x27;s me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A satisfactory product. Nice price.</li>
    <li> I have now passed the razor on to my son-in-law since my husband has passed away.My son-in-law likes it too.</li>
    <li> Hi, I tried this shaver after reading some of the reviews and i&#x27;m very disappointer. I can&#x27;t see how this shaver would help anyone unless you had a lite growth. I would not buy this shaver again.</li>
    <li> I was anxious to get the Braun because of its fine reputation.  The Series 1 - 150 was very disappointing.  Even though it cost only around $50, shouldn&#x27;t it give a good shave?  Not even close.  I&#x27;ve gone back to my closer-shave Remington.  The Braun sits on the shelf, gathering dust.</li>
    <li> I used to love Braun, since my grand dad had given me shaver for Christmas in 1987, which is still working amazingly and even can be used all over the world.&lt;br /&gt;This one I just bought, can be only used with the Power in the US, not in Asia or Europe, especially since the battery live is not so great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also it is hard to operate and the blade broke after about 4 month. My old Braun from 87 lasted longer till the blade broke.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Blades are not under warranty so be prepared to replace every 4 month or so for an additional 30 USD.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It seems like the product cycles used to be eight o ten years in the 80&#x27;s and now they are one to two years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Better to by wet shavers or a more expensive electrical shaver.&lt;br /&gt;Check out this movie about love in New York [[ASIN:B001D04VUQ THE MANHATTAN DATING PROJECT]], it is on demand and there is a nice shaving scene in there as well. (hint)</li>
    <li> It shaves clean, is easy to clean.  Holds a charge for a long time. Seems like a quality product to me.</li>
    <li> Cheaply made product. Waste of money.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Braun for years and when my wife told me about one of the mentally challenged individuals, at the facility she&#x27;s an assistant county director of, needing a razor I naturally thought of Braun. This razor gives the gent as good a shave as my 5000 series and you don&#x27;t have to mess with all of that cleaner crap that many of the new razor companies have gone to.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve owned about 3 of these in my lifetime----  they typically last me about 7 or 8 years ---- the foil is the thing that goes, the motor never has any problems, but when you shop you will find you can buy the whole shaver for a few bucks more than the foil, so I always buy a new one</li>
    <li> I have been using a triple headed rotary shaver  for over ten years now (the same one in fact) and had tried a couple of the other screen type shavers prior to that. I did not like the screen shavers in the least, which is why I ended up going with the rotary style. But after just six shaves, I must say I am really sold on this type now. This shaver works beautifully and doesn&#x27;t pull on the hairs. It gets very close and does a wonderful job. Also this one is rechargeable (cordless) whereas the one I have been using isn&#x27;t. Another neat feature is the sideburn trimmer. I have a beard and don&#x27;t need to shave as much as most men do, but appreciate and use the trimmer feature to keep my beard growing only where I want it to grow. After doing some edge trimming, I then just use the regular shaver part to finish the job. If you are in the market for a new shaver, I strongly urge you to consider this one.</li>
    <li> I selected this for my son to try since he is still relatively new to shaving every day. He has a Norelco (his choice) and his dad a Braun - a brand he has used for many years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My son tried it and was very disappointed in the quality of shave. It left a good amount of stubble - very patchy shave. In some areas, he had to push harder and got \\&quot;nicked\\&quot;. He ended up having to finish shaving with his Norelco. Also was not thrilled with how noisy it was. He did like the shape and the large shaving head.</li>
    <li> As a blade shaver whose weapon of choice is the [[ASIN:B000XVXK12 Gillette Fusion Power Phenom Razor]], I have always believed that electric razors are for men who don&#x27;t really insist on a close shave (or less facetiously for men whose lifestyle requires shaving on-the-go).  Nothing about the performance of this razor has changed my mind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is useless on anything more than a couple days growth of beard, and it doesn&#x27;t shave anywhere near as closely or as cleanly as a blade.  You cannot use it in the shower, and I also find the separate off and on buttons clumsy to operate.  As an emergency shadow remover for a man on the go, it is adequate, but it will take up a lot of your precious carry on space for what it delivers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;About the only good things I can say about it are that the battery performance is quite good and that the sideburn trimmer works as described; in fact it can be safely used in an emergency to trim several days growth of beard down to where the razor can handle what is left.</li>
    <li> Got this shaver to replace an older similar Braun model that has the beard trimmer stop working after two years.  It works just ok for a guy with a heavy beard. Doesn&#x27;t shave near as close as one of those triple blade Shick manual razors.  One day it suddenly refused to take a charge when the battery died.  If you have a light beard this would probably be a good choice. For a heavy beard is can work for a half day.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t shave close enough, spend extra for a better shaver.</li>
    <li> I use it just about every day and its held up for 4 years now and still gives me a clean shave</li>
    <li> Takes a long, long time even to cut a small amount of hair. I would suggest it be used ONLY as an emergency shaver in case your regular one runs out of battery.</li>
    <li> WOrks nice for the money..........  Next time I will get a better one though.</li>
    <li> - Battery only lasts about 2 shaves, and seems to be dying all together.&lt;br /&gt;- Cutting is very ineffective compared to every other shaver I&#x27;ve ever used.&lt;br /&gt;- Can&#x27;t use shaver while it&#x27;s plugged in</li>
    <li> The battery is not compatable with  other shaving machine produced by same manufacture. Other than that, it is normal similar to Braun.</li>
