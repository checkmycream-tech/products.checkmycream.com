<li> I wonder how long it will last before even Amazon runs out?</li>
<li> Two main problems:  very hard to push down the sprayer; didn&#x27;t smell quite the same as the last time I used it years ago.</li>
<li> That being said, the I do wish it were slightly stronger or that there was a perfume in the line since when I just want to add a bit during the day, the fragrance disappears in a fairly short period of time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> The product arrived partially damaged because it was not wrapped in protective packaging.</li>
<li> but when I got it the cap was unscrewed a little bit and some had leaked out.  </li>
<li> My wife loves this scent and it is unfortunate that it is no longer carried by Bath &amp; Body Works.</li>
<li> Too bad bath and body discontinued making it.</li>
<li> I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s a change in bottle or something else, but I was disappointed with my Body Splash.  </li>

    <li> Not what was ordered as shown in the site</li>
    <li> When my mother smelled me on this scent, she said \\&quot;smells like the ones you get in a spa\\&quot;.  This whole line of products with the white tea and ginger scent smell fresh and elegant, not sweet or sticky, like other fruit-based ones.</li>
    <li> I love this particular scent and it&#x27;s my favorite in the Bath and Body Works line.  I use the body cream, body lotion and the body splash daily during the warm weather months and it&#x27;s just perfect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The body splash is light and works well in combination with either the cream or lotion and is not overpowering.  That being said, the I do wish it were slightly stronger or that there was a perfume in the line since when I just want to add a bit during the day, the fragrance disappears in a fairly short period of time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great in combination with other products in the line but doesn&#x27;t work quite as well as a stand-alone product, but still my favorite !</li>
    <li> Very good product. My favorite original scent from bath and body works:) Can&#x27;t buy it in stores anymore so here is the place to get it!</li>

    <li> So glad I was able to find this particular Bath &amp; Body Works splash on Amazon.  I did not realize it was a limited&lt;br /&gt;classic scent at the actual Bath &amp; Body stores.  Amazon is the best place to shop.  Thank you....</li>
    <li> Bath and body works splash is just my wife´s favorite scent. She uses this after working out at the gym or just whenever needed. Recommended.</li>
    <li> This is a great produce, however it is only $3.00 on the Bath and Body Works website...why would anyone pay $7.00???</li>
    <li> I have used this produce for many years and love it. I could sugest it&#x27;s use by many people , because of it&#x27;s clean oder.  Thank you for continuing the purchasing at holidays.</li>
    <li> I love this fragrance!  This is my signature scent.  BBW sold out of this wonderful aroma, and I have depleted my stash. ;O)  Had to find it on Amazon, until it&#x27;s restocked at BBW.  Shipping was not favorable with Shell&#x27;s Jewels. The product arrived partially damaged because it was not wrapped in protective packaging.</li>
