      <li>It is vegan:)</li>
      <li>Bottom line is, even though this is not a product targeted to older users, it makes my skin look hydrated and great, without a lot of excess oiliness.</li>
      <li>I received this oil free cream a week or so ago and simply love it.  </li>
      <li>This is the first time I have ever liked a face moisturizer.</li>
      <li>I was so upset to see that this moisturizer made my skin more oily than usual because it smells so good!!</li>
      <li>It feels very light and keeps my oil under control while giving my skin the right amount of moisture.</li>
      <li>I had been looking for an oil free moisturizer which was not loaded with parabens, phthlates, and heaven</li>

      <li>They clearly have a good formula here.</li>
      <li>Light but adequately moisturizes the face and blends well with makeup (powder or foundation).</li>
      <li>My face still feels clean after putting it on.  </li>
      <li>This product is good for areas where you don&#x27;t want to use a regular cream.  </li>
      <li>It is very lightweight too, but for me I can&#x27;t wear this during the day since it makes my skin more oily.</li>
      <li>I started having more breakouts and my skin was very oily under my makeup.</li>
      <li>I love that this cream is oil free - it has helped clear my skin and have not had any breakouts since using it.</li>
      <li>But, make sure to wash your face really good, I mean for a length of time not just a quick once over...</li>
      <li>It is easily absorbed.</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t say I know if it would work for everyone, but for me, the cost (around 20-25 bucks) is worth it.</li>
      <li>But I have so many problems with oil and breakouts, this just seemed like a good one to try after finding the creams for older skin to be too heavy for me.  </li>
      <li>I am in my mid 30&#x27;s and wasn&#x27;t sure about this lotion.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried many mychelle products recently</li>
      <li>I do use the white cranberry cleanser which I love</li>
      <li>With the other products my skin feels clean, healthy, and glowing.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m a HUGE and dedicated fan of the MyChelle product line, and I religiously use:&lt;br /&gt;--Clear Skin Serum</li>
      <li>I use the whole MyChelle face cleansing system</li>
      <li>To clarify though it is definitely NOT oil free.</li>
      <li>Regardless, it really does work to reduce acne.</li>
      <li>Highly recommended!  </li>
      <li>I tend to get really oily in the face...</li>
      <li>and I have never had better results with any other product.</li>
      <li>I find it outperforms the other moisturizers I have in terms of returning dry skin to healthy and comfortable for hours.</li>
      <li>Glad I only got the sample size to start with as this would have been a huge waste of money.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m 43, so I was concerned about using a product that&#x27;s not designed for older skin.  </li>
      <li>It seems that most creams work well for a few weeks then stop.  </li>
      <li>They are high quality products, that aren&#x27;t extremely expensive (Amazon, by far, has the best prices), especially for being all natural.</li>
      <li>They truly live up to product claims.</li>
      <li>Plus, it smells really good and a small amount goes a long way.</li>
      <li>only knows what else, plus provide the hydration I needed and this product does exactly that.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used this in conjuction with mychelle clear skin serum and cranberry cleanser.</li>
      <li>This Item works well when paired with the MyChelle clear skin cream and the coconut sunshield moisturizer.</li>
      <li>I use it with the clear skin serum and that combination allows me to moisturize my skin without breaking out.</li>
      <li>I find this combination of products leave my skin soft and supple, my oily skin is no longer oily.</li>
      <li>This moisturizer has worked miracles on my oily, sensitive and acne prone skin.</li>
      <li>If I were to buy this is a store (such as Whole Foods)</li>
      <li>And I will never waste another minute shopping around for a face moisturizer.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using this for my oily/acne prone 39 year old face</li>
      <li>old grandmother who still has an oily t-zone</li>
      <li>I am on my second container of this particular product.  </li>
      <li>It really cuts down on oil production and breakouts w/o much irritation</li>
      <li>This lotion has proven time and time again to be of such high quality that I don&#x27;t even bat a lash that a tiny bottle costs $20-$25.</li>
      <li>I currently use the Cranberry Cleanser, Clear Skin Serum, and Grapefruit Cream.  </li>
      <li>There are several natural oils in this product.</li>
      <li>It took me awhile to try it on the recommendation of a friend, but I&#x27;ll never go back to the old stuff I was using.</li>
      <li>This product delivers just the right amount of moisture to my face without feeling heavy or oily.</li>
      <li>It actually did the complete opposite of what I wanted it to do.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Way too heavy for my acne skin.</li>
    <li> I ordered this thinking that it would help control my oily skin, but it left me feeling dehydrated and ultimately clogged my pores.</li>
    <li> I received this oil free cream a week or so ago and simply love it.  I had been looking for an oil free moisturizer which was not loaded with parabens, phthlates, and heaven only knows what else, plus provide the hydration I needed and this product does exactly that.  I am a 65 yr. old grandmother who still has an oily t-zone so I didn&#x27;t need or want heavy creams and moisturizers.  Am very pleased with the grapefruit cream and will order again.  Just wish they had a larger size, but with only using two pumps, the product should last awhile.</li>
    <li> I love that this cream is oil free - it has helped clear my skin and have not had any breakouts since using it. Plus, it smells really good and a small amount goes a long way.</li>
    <li> Light but adequately moisturizes the face and blends well with makeup (powder or foundation). When I experience break ours this is my go-to until my face clears up.  Would recommend to a friend looking for oil free lotion.</li>
    <li> I have very dry semi-mature skin. I am in my mid 30&#x27;s and wasn&#x27;t sure about this lotion.  I do have acne though and thought I&#x27;d give it a try.  This lotion is light weight but gives very good moisture that lasts.  I put it on immediately after the fruit enzyme toner and it seems to hold more moisture longer.  I&#x27;ve tried many mychelle products recently and I have to say, I love the line and I love that it doesn&#x27;t have all of the harmful stuff in it.  It took me awhile to try it on the recommendation of a friend, but I&#x27;ll never go back to the old stuff I was using.</li>
    <li> This moisturizer has worked miracles on my oily, sensitive and acne prone skin. Give it a try.</li>
    <li> I love this moisturizer. I have combination skin that is acne prone in some areas, but easily dried out. This product delivers just the right amount of moisture to my face without feeling heavy or oily. It is easily absorbed. My husband uses it in the winter when his skin gets dry. It is vegan:)</li>
    <li> Love this stuff.  My face still feels clean after putting it on.  I&#x27;m 43, so I was concerned about using a product that&#x27;s not designed for older skin.  But I have so many problems with oil and breakouts, this just seemed like a good one to try after finding the creams for older skin to be too heavy for me.  My skin is still oily later in the afternoon.  But I&#x27;ve come to the conclusion this is inevitable and does not seem to change no matter what product I use.  Bottom line is, even though this is not a product targeted to older users, it makes my skin look hydrated and great, without a lot of excess oiliness.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a HUGE and dedicated fan of the MyChelle product line, and I religiously use:&lt;br /&gt;--Clear Skin Serum&lt;br /&gt;--Cranberry Cleanser (though they&#x27;re all great)&lt;br /&gt;--Pumpkin Renew&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;and am very happy. The only products I cannot use are the too-sticky/shiny sunscreen and this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First off, the whatever gives it its fragrance flares up my fragrance allergies as badly as the synthetic fragrances do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Secondly, it just doesn&#x27;t seem to make any difference in the skin. With the other products my skin feels clean, healthy, and glowing. This one just makes me sneeze and doesn&#x27;t seem to change the appearance of my skin. I gave it to a friend who is using it but reporting no difference too.</li>
    <li> I have loved all MyChelle products I&#x27;ve tried. The customer service has also been great. It&#x27;s just a great company, great products, excellent ingredients.  They truly live up to product claims. This grapefruit moisturizer is great for acne prone skin.  To clarify though it is definitely NOT oil free. There are several natural oils in this product. So, I dk what that&#x27;s about. Regardless, it really does work to reduce acne. It has NOT made me break out. This is the first time I have ever liked a face moisturizer. It&#x27;s my favorite product.</li>
    <li> I am on my second container of this particular product.  It seems that most creams work well for a few weeks then stop.  This is one of the few products I&#x27;ve repurchased.  I fight adult acne that does not respond well to any other treatments except medication. It has been the perfect balance of moisture.

I currently use the Cranberry Cleanser, Clear Skin Serum, and Grapefruit Cream.  I would recommend this over costly and potentially harmful oral medications and harsh topical treatments.</li>
    <li> This brand products donot work for me at all. It is nature products but not effective. I tried for 4 weeks than I have togive uo.</li>
    <li> I really love this moisturizer and have reordered. I use it with the clear skin serum and that combination allows me to moisturize my skin without breaking out. I find it outperforms the other moisturizers I have in terms of returning dry skin to healthy and comfortable for hours. They clearly have a good formula here.</li>
    <li> This Item works well when paired with the MyChelle clear skin cream and the coconut sunshield moisturizer. It really cuts down on oil production and breakouts w/o much irritation</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for my oily/acne prone 39 year old face and it works great. I use the whole MyChelle face cleansing system and I have never had better results with any other product. I tried going back to a less expensive brand, but it doesn&#x27;t even compare to this. They are high quality products, that aren&#x27;t extremely expensive (Amazon, by far, has the best prices), especially for being all natural. I use this in conjuction with the White Cranberry Cleanser, Fruit Enzyme Mist, and Sunscreen, while supplementing with the Fruit Enzyme Scrub. I couldn&#x27;t be happier with my skin. I love these products!</li>
    <li> I would recommend my chelle products. I&#x27;ve used them for awhile. I have rosacea, or I would probably use more of their products.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this in conjuction with mychelle clear skin serum and cranberry cleanser. Has definitely helped my acne, and leaves skin moisturized without the oily effect. Will definitely buy this again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the fact that these products are available thru the subscribe and save option! Please continue offering these mychelle products through Subscribe and Save.</li>
    <li> Love this moisturizer and all Mychelle products. They have great ingredients and are great for my skin which is sensitive and acne-prone. I can use this moisturizer without breaking out and it makes my skin look radiant!</li>
    <li> Calming and non greasy yet moisturizes oily skin.</li>
    <li> This moisturizer is supposedly made to help control oily skin - all it did was make mine worse. My face was literally an oil slick after using this. Glad I only got the sample size to start with as this would have been a huge waste of money.</li>
    <li> This cream is perfect for my oily skin.  It balances my skin well and smells heavenly.  It feels very light and keeps my oil under control while giving my skin the right amount of moisture.</li>
    <li> This product is good for areas where you don&#x27;t want to use a regular cream.  The only thing that I don&#x27;t like about it is that it has an unpleasant medicinal smell.</li>
    <li> my skin is very acne prone and it has been the best in my life since i&#x27;ve started using this line. love!</li>
    <li> I would recommend this product to anyone who struggles with oily skin...But, make sure to wash your face really good, I mean for a length of time not just a quick once over...When I started washing my face longer my blemishes disappeared...</li>
    <li> I tend to get really oily in the face...but when I use this face lotion I feel like I don&#x27;t get oily. I figure it must be working because I don&#x27;t break out in zits anymore. I get a lot of compliments on how great my skin looks since I&#x27;ve been using this lotion. I can&#x27;t say I know if it would work for everyone, but for me, the cost (around 20-25 bucks) is worth it. I order through Amazon&#x27;s Subscribe &amp; Save Program and get a new bottle automatically shipped to me every few months which drops the price about 5%. If I were to buy this is a store (such as Whole Foods) it would cost me around 30 bucks. What a deal. Highly recommended!  Update: 6/2015 My Husband &amp; I have both been using this lotion daily on our faces for several years now and have no intention of changing up this regimen. This lotion has proven time and time again to be of such high quality that I don&#x27;t even bat a lash that a tiny bottle costs $20-$25. You get what you pay for. And I will never waste another minute shopping around for a face moisturizer. This is IT for us.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m an African American woman with oily skin. I do use the white cranberry cleanser which I love but this moisturizer is not for me. It actually did the complete opposite of what I wanted it to do. I started having more breakouts and my skin was very oily under my makeup. Other people had the same experience but I thought why not give it a try. I discontinued it immediately.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for years, I simply love it! It&#x27;s natural, feels very good on my skin, moisturizing without feeling sticky.  I use this for day moisturizer before putting MyChele&#x27;s coconut sun block.  At night I use Burt&#x27;s Bees night radiance cream.  I find this combination of products leave my skin soft and supple, my oily skin is no longer oily. These products are good for the skin and puts it into balance.</li>
    <li> I was so upset to see that this moisturizer made my skin more oily than usual because it smells so good!! It is very lightweight too, but for me I can&#x27;t wear this during the day since it makes my skin more oily.</li>
