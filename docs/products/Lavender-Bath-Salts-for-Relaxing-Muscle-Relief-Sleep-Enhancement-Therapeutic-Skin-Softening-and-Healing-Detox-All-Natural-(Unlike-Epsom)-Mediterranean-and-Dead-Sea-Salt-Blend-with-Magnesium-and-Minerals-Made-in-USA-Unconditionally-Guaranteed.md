      <li>/&gt;I was provided a sample for evaluation and an honest review.</li>
      <li>That is a nice touch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>and I am really quite happy to say that I find great value in this mineral sea salt</li>
      <li>The mineral salt itself was also nice, although there were still some crystals undissolved at the end of 20 minutes.</li>

      <li>In fact, you could use it as an air freshener all by itself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After letting the salts (I used about ¼ cup) dissolve in a bowl of warm water, I put my feet in to test the waters.</li>
      <li>I think this product makes a nice gift.</li>

      <li>I thought that would be a great time to try Bath Salts, Lavender Mineral Sea Salt Soak, and I was right!</li>
      <li>I am very pleased and would buy the jar for more prolonged</li>
      <li>when I opened the bath salts, the scent of lavender was very strong and I was concerned how it would be soaking.  </li>
      <li>This is by far the best mineral soak I have tried.  </li>
      <li>I poured the recommended cup of salts into the warm water and let it work its magic.  </li>
      <li>I used this in my claw foot tub and enjoyed a nice lavender-scented soak.</li>

      <li>bath salts (very large salt crystals) have a pleasant, but not overpowering lavender scent</li>
      <li>The bath salts come in a nice large supply for many tub soaks, or even more foot/hand soaks, providing a good value for the money.  </li>
      <li>I have tried a lot of bath salts and this one is at the top of the list for me.  </li>
      <li>I had a coupon code to try these out, a I&#x27;m so glad I did.</li>
      <li>Like most people, I am stressed and rushed and too \\&quot;busy\\&quot; to do something as luxurious as spend twenty or so minutes in the tub.</li>
      <li>The GF likes her baths, and enjoyed the feel and scent of these bath-salts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I have chronic muscle pain and often find that I&#x27;m too sore to make it through most days.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Love this product. I use it to soak my hands in it for about 10 minutes. I love the lavender scent and how great my skin feels after the soak. I can recommend it to everyone. Hubby is also in love with it when taking a bath. Can&#x27;t go wrong with this one!!!!!</li>
    <li> I wanted to share my experience with this Lavender bath salt that I bought a few weeks ago.  I have been using it three times a week when I take baths.  It really helps me relax me before I go to sleep.  I have actually noticed that I have had an easier time falling asleep at nights.  It also smells great.  I have tried a lot of bath salts and this one is at the top of the list for me.  Its a must try for women who enjoy taking baths.</li>
    <li> I really enjoyed this.  I&#x27;ve tried several different products that allege your skin feeling smoother after a bath with it, but I haven&#x27;t noticed much results with those.  With this, I definitely did, and I didn&#x27;t even use the full one cup the directions recommended!  It&#x27;s got a very strong scent, but in a good way.  The only downsides to it are that A) the particles are, in my opinion, a little larger than what I&#x27;m used to, so it took longer to dissolve, and B) you can only use it 2-3 times before you run out.  If you follow the directions, you&#x27;re supposed to use one cup per bath, and there&#x27;s only two cups in the bottle.  That said, I accidentally used a little less than a cup and still saw better results than I have with any other product.  I was relaxed and my skin came out incredibly smooth.  Definitely recommended!</li>
    <li> NOTE:  The manufacturer provided me with a free jar of this product for review purposes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t typically use bath salts, so I don&#x27;t have a lot to compare this Bath Path lavender bath salts to except how it compares to just having plain water in your bath.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I measured out exactly one cup, as the directions specify.  This used half the container, so keep in mind that you will only get two baths out of a jar if you use as much as they recommend.  At the current price, this comes out to $7 per bath, which seems pretty extreme to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I&#x27;d received tremendous benefits, a $7 bath might be a justifiable indulgence to have every now and then.  But, alas, I felt like all this did was smell nice.  The smell was very strong, but after soaking for a while, I couldn&#x27;t really smell it anymore (it was still there, I knew; I&#x27;d just gotten desensitized to it).  The water didn&#x27;t feel particularly \\&quot;soft\\&quot; or \\&quot;silky\\&quot; as some people describe an Epsom salt (magnesium sulfate) bath.  This is just \\&quot;sea salt\\&quot; (mostly sodium chloride with probably some trace minerals).  My skin didn&#x27;t feel any different, either during or after the bath.  I didn&#x27;t feel particularly soothed or relaxed.  It was just a nice-smelling bath.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After the bath, I happened to open the jar again and take a whiff, and this time the smell seemed overwhelming, and it made me feel a little sick.  I think I&#x27;d kind of OD&#x27;ed on the lavender smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I came out of the bathroom, my husband said he couldn&#x27;t even detect the lavender scent on me or coming through the open bathroom door.  However, my daughter immediately noticed it when she came in our bedroom, and later she remarked that she could faintly smell it on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I went to bed within half an hour, and I did seem to fall asleep more quickly than usual, but that is just as likely to have been a coincidence.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottom line is that this isn&#x27;t a bad product; it seems well-made, and they are generous with the lavender oil.  You could probably use much less than the recommended amount and still have a nice scent to your bath water.  But the sea salt didn&#x27;t seem to confer any benefits, so if I wanted a lavender-scented bath again, I would probably just add a few drops of [[ASIN:B0009RSP38 lavender oil]].&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This would make a very attractive gift, though.</li>
    <li> This product was a contest win.  I thought they they worked quite well.  Easy to use and makes bathing an enjoyable soak.  Would suggest this product to all.</li>
    <li> I think this product makes a nice gift. It&#x27;s nicely packaged (for the price) and when you open it, it smells really nice. It is indeed a strong smell, but that will diminish when it&#x27;s used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ingredients: 100% sea salt, vitamin e oil, lavender essential oil&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As others have said, the directions call for one cup per bath, so being only 16 ounces you&#x27;ll probably get 2 baths out of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, as a gift or for infrequent use, I think it&#x27;s a nice little luxury product that&#x27;s not too expensive, but for using regularly, you&#x27;ll probably want to find something cheaper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, 4 stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOTE: I received a free product sample for review.</li>
    <li> There is nothing more wonderfully relaxing - - and even recharging - -  than soaking in a warm (or hot) bath with a good book at the end of a long day or weekend.  Normally more choice goes into the book selection than what goes into your water.  No longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bath Path Mineral Sea Salt Soak was fantastic.  I used less than the recommended cup and my bathroom was immediately immersed in a soothing lavender scent.  I found soaking to be incredibly calming, between the wonderful smell and the softness of the water.  With or without a good book, with or without candles, each time I used this sea salt soak it did me a world of good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As promised, it soothed away stress and left my skin extremely soft and smooth.  I suffer from back and neck pains and my muscles felt relieved after use.  Additionally, there was no tub stain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you suffer from muscles aches, high stress and/or problems sleeping, Bath Path Mineral Sea Salt Soak may be the answer for you.  Be forewarned that using the suggested dosage will take half your jar, only giving you 2 soaks.  I used a quarter to a half of the suggest dosage and found it worked just fine for me and let me stretch out use of the soak.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you enjoy a good bath and lavender, you simply cannot go wrong with this product.  It&#x27;s fantastic for personal use and would also make an excellent gift.  I wouldn&#x27;t hesitate to recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;@2013 Psychotic State Book Reviews</li>
    <li> Really enjoyed this product. Used in my whirlpool tub. Left my skin nice and soft, great aroma,relaxing. The only negative is not alot of product for the money. Ran out too soon. Otherwise great.</li>
    <li> Would buy again as a gift for someone else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My wife likes the salts, but she reports that the lavender smell does not linger on the skin. She still uses lavender oil for this purpose.</li>
    <li> Taking the Bath Path - after working in the yard for most of the day, I desperately needed a soak in the tub. I thought that would be a great time to try Bath Salts, Lavender Mineral Sea Salt Soak, and I was right! I measured about one cup of bath salts in the hot water, slipped in and luxuriated in the hint of lavender and soothing salts. You can bet I will be using this product again after my next day in the garden!</li>
    <li> I had a coupon code to try these out, a I&#x27;m so glad I did. These bath salts are great - you don&#x27;t need anywhere near the recommended cup for a full bath (think a couple tablespoons instead). No harsh chemicals (sea salt, vitamin E, and lavender essential oil are the only ingredients), and it turns your tub into a mini spa. Would purchase again, and recommend as a gift.</li>
    <li> I used this in my claw foot tub and enjoyed a nice lavender-scented soak. I also appreciated the vitamin E they&#x27;ve added to the salts, making for even softer skin. However, the addition of vitamin E generally means you can&#x27;t use the salts in a jetted tub (that&#x27;s what our Jacuzzi brand manual states) as the manufacturers caution against any kind of oil in the jets.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyhow, just salts, lavender essential oil and vitamin E so no unnecessary chemicals or colorants. I don&#x27;t know if salts and lavender actually take away my aches and pains, but they sure make a nice hot soak smell a lot better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was given a free sample of this product by the manufacturer.</li>
    <li> Woah dudes and dudettes this stuff will turn your life around, I went from singing the blues to singing all the great hits of The Village People as soon as I used this product. I went from a 98 pound weakling to a powerful 210 pound stud!</li>
    <li> I got a jar of Bath Path lavender sea salt soak to use with my girlfriend, who loves this kind of stuff.  Honestly, I can&#x27;t remember the last time that I took a bath, let alone a bath with fancy smelling sea salts, so this is all pretty new to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When the package arrived, I happened to have a pretty bad cold, so I decided to give this stuff a try.  The directions say to use one cup for a bath, which seemed like a lot because the jar itself is only 16 oz.  I ended up using less than a quarter of a cup, and I thought it was fine.  The scent is soothing and nice, without being overly flowery or pungent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I soaked in the tub for about 25 minutes, and when I got out, I felt great, smelled great, and my skin didn&#x27;t feel dry at all.  I can see why my girlfriend enjoys baths so much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d definitely use this product again, but it&#x27;d be nice if they offered a larger jar at a more economical price.  Overall, I&#x27;m very happy with the purchase, and I would definitely recommend it to any other people who are hesitant to try a sea salt soak.</li>
    <li> I get stressed out easily and I carry that stress in my muscles, so I enjoy an occasional hot bath to relax. I wanted to add some bath salts to help balance and hydrate my skin, but not something strongly scented as I&#x27;m not a big fan of perfumes. I&#x27;m happy to find that Bath Path&#x27;s Lavender Sea Salt Soak had a beautiful and relaxing aroma, not overpowering in the least. The scent alone was a perfect addition to my relaxing bath at the end of the day. The mineral salt itself was also nice, although there were still some crystals undissolved at the end of 20 minutes. I am guessing they might have needed some more agitation. Along with my skin feeling a little less dry then before, I am overall pleased with the relaxing scent of this product.</li>
    <li> In all honestly, it&#x27;s been a very long time since I&#x27;ve taken the time to indulge in a bath. Like most people, I am stressed and rushed and too \\&quot;busy\\&quot; to do something as luxurious as spend twenty or so minutes in the tub. I should be doing laundry, cleaning the cat boxes, preparing dinner for tomorrow, exercising. People, forget about all that crap. It will still be waiting for you tomorrow. Your sanity may not. Seriously, I am so glad I was approached to review this product because it forced me to slow the heck down, decompress and simply relax.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The salts come in a plastic container so it&#x27;s safe to keep in the bath area without fear of slippage and glass breakage for those prone to klutzy moments or those with naughty cats who like nothing better than to set up death traps for you . . . The directions instruct you to use a full cup for each bath but I like to make things last as long as possible and if I used the full cup I&#x27;d only be able to enjoy this stuff for 2-3 baths. So, I used less than ½ a cup and the scent managed to infuse my small bathroom and hallway with a fresh and natural scent of lavender that wasn&#x27;t overpowering but just right. I suffer from migraines and can&#x27;t tolerate strong, fake, flowery scents which is why this natural product appealed to me in the first place (it only contains 3 ingredients, none of them chemicals). Most of the bath bombs and salts on the market either make my skin itch or induce a migraine. Not this one! After the bath my skin was left feeling soft and very lightly scented and my frame of mind really was much more peaceful. My naughty cat even enjoyed the scent and sat on the edge of the tub soaking in the tranquility. I can&#x27;t vouch for the fact that it helps with sore muscles because I&#x27;ve been slacking on the workouts (I&#x27;ll update on that when I&#x27;m not so lazy) but I do have a bit of pain in my wrists/hands that mostly bothers me at night from typing all day long and they were not nearly as achy that one night after the bath. It could be all in my mind but hey whatever works, right?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can easily recommend indulging in these bath salts for yourself or purchasing them as a gift for your loved one especially if he/she is stressed and needs a little soothing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*I received this product in exchange for an honest review.r the bath.

    <li> Irritated my skin. Not sure why but I have very sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> I use salt soaks to help with an arthritic condition and minimize chronic pain issues.  So, I&#x27;m picky.&lt;br /&gt;I used this several times under different conditions (my pain level or the water temp.) and I am really quite happy to say that I find great value in this mineral sea salt soak.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The fragrance is natural.  It is lavender and isn&#x27;t overpowering.  It also doesn&#x27;t disappear once you&#x27;ve added the water.  You sit in a bath of delicate lavender and it just smells good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The sea salt does the job.  I&#x27;ve never soaked in a salt bath that didn&#x27;t dry up my skin and require lotion/oil afterward.  This is no different.  There is vitamin E oil in the mix and that is so appreciated, but dryness will be a factor for you with this product.  Now, I didn&#x27;t lower the stars on that count because it really is to be expected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m thrilled with the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**** Disclaimer*** I did receive this product free in order to evaluate the effectiveness.  I do not know the company/person that makes the sea salt nor do I know the individual that sent it to me.  My opinion is an honest reflection of my experience with the Bath Path Mineral Sea Salt Soak.</li>
    <li> I LOVE lavender. It is by far my favorite scent. But I&#x27;ve come across plenty of bad or weak lavender scented products. This is the real deal. It is strong (not pungent) and relaxing. It smells natural and when put into warm water, gives off a gentle but noticeable lavender scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The salts dissolve easily and soaking feet or hands or even your whole body is a wonderful experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to say that I like to open the lid and let the scent float up for a little aroma therapy while working or reading.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A great product that would make a lovely gift too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The label states to use one cup (probably for a full bath) which means that you would use this up in two baths. But if you use it for foot or hand soaks, it will obviously last longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was provided a sample for evaluation and an honest review.</li>
    <li> Very relaxing addition to a bath. The smell is wonderful and skin feels great after using this product.</li>
    <li> Disclaimer: The manufacturer provided me with a free jar of this product for review purposes. The review is honest and unbiased as all my other reviews. Hope it helps you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried a lot of different bath salts and while I have some favorites, I must say this one was surprisingly nice. I went into the bath with a LOT of soreness from yoga, with aches and pains and a lot of fatigue and I had the most soothing bath - remember, not to use scalding hot water just hot-to-warm will do - and my body was totally healed and relaxed. I don&#x27;t know how much of it is water versus these amazing bath salts but I am going to be using them AGAIN and AGAIN, that&#x27;s for sure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you for the bath salts and for the wonderful fragrance of lavender which I love. Great product and it comes with great love and care from the makers. I recommend it heartily.</li>
    <li> This Mineral Sea Salt Soak is terrific for sore muscles and general relaxation.  My son is using it after football games to help limit muscle soreness and it really seems to speed up his recovery.  He smells great too, which is a wonder in itself.  This product is a good value and would make a great gift.  It is simple to use, and doesn&#x27;t contain the gunk that I&#x27;ve seen in other bath products that will mess clog filters and mess with the jets in your tub.</li>
    <li> I found this bath salt to provide a very nice soaking experience.  when I opened the bath salts, the scent of lavender was very strong and I was concerned how it would be soaking.  I was very pleased to find that the salt, when added to warm bath, provides a very gentle soothing fragrance, the salt dissolved nicely without leaving any hard salt residue behind, and the tub was left without any residue after.  The bath salts come in a nice large supply for many tub soaks, or even more foot/hand soaks, providing a good value for the money.  The salts kept their fragrance to relax me throughout my long soak, providing a great experience.  I love the soft lavender scent, and hope I can find this same product in an eucalyptis and menthol scent soon during allergy and cold season!  I can recommend this product honestly, since I use a variety of bath salts on a regular basis. I also appreciate this product is available through Amazon Prime - which ensures I&#x27;ll be reordering when I run out!</li>
    <li> I have tried many different bath products and so far, this is one of my favorites.  It smells amazing and left my skin feeling soft and smooth.  It definitely makes the bath a spa like experience.  The following morning after using this product, my 5 year old son told me that bathroom still smelled like flowers.  The directions call for 1 cup of the salt, although I&#x27;m not sure the entire cup is needed to achieve the same experience.  The product arrived earlier than was expected and was well packaged.  This product would make a great gift!</li>
    <li> My wife was finally able to try this product and she has nothing but good things to say about this product.  She mentioned that she loved the smell and it was nice and relaxing.  It comes in a nice bottle and I believe would make nice gifts for women in general if you&#x27;re unsure what to get them for their birthday, Christmas, etc</li>
    <li> This Mineral Sea Salt was a nice addition to my relaxing bath time.  I especially like that it doesn&#x27;t have an overpowering scent.</li>
    <li> I absolutely LOVE this product. It&#x27;s AMAZING what 2 tbsp and a bowl of warm water can do for sore hands. My dream would be to take a bath with this stuff, but my tall frame doesn&#x27;t allow me to do so in my bathtub. But if i could, I would. The scent of lavender is a plus. Overall, it&#x27;s a very relaxing, tingling (a good tingling, fyi). Thanks for reading this....ENJOY.</li>
    <li> I have a funny story...&lt;br /&gt;I volunteer at a struggling organic farm, and came up with the idea that if I wore a veggie costume and stood near the highway it&#x27;s located on, I could lure folks in to the farmstand.&lt;br /&gt;As if anyone needed proof as to what a dork I am.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dressed as an ear of corn (I reviewed the costume, it was fabulous!) I spent hours waving and dancing.&lt;br /&gt;Fun, but the next day I was so sore!&lt;br /&gt;Into the tub with these bath salts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, mineral baths really do help aching muscles, and the lavender oil in this product scents the water just enough to help you to relax even more.&lt;br /&gt;Afterwards, my skin felt so refreshed and hydrated. Perhaps the addition of a little vitamin E in the formula is what makes it stand out.&lt;br /&gt;Nice little luxury.</li>
    <li> The lavender bath salts were so relaxing. I have chronic muscle pain and often find that I&#x27;m too sore to make it through most days. One bath with these bath salts and I felt so comfortable and ready to kick back and go to sleep. If you suffer from chronic pain or have trouble getting to sleep, this is the product for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sweettartbeauty.com&lt;br /&gt;- Emmy</li>
    <li> I chose a five star rating for these lavender mineral sea salts because I have tried so many of these and not always been very happy with them.  These bath salts smell great, you can smell them without even opening the jar, very nice and relaxing.  Something I really like about these salts is that they leave you soft, but don&#x27;t leave a ring in your tub and don&#x27;t leave the tub incredibly slippery when you drain it.  I have used other bath salts that you can&#x27;t even stand in the tub after draining because of the slick film they leave, this product is clean and smells fresh.  I would give this as a gift, it is a nice big jar and made in the USA!</li>
    <li> I enjoyed the sea salt soak...nice and relaxing in a bath after a long day at work</li>
    <li> I bought this as a surprise for my wife as she&#x27;s been working hard recently and likes to take baths. Anyway, she took it to the bath with her and kinda laughed at me afterwards. Why? She said the ink ran off in the bathroom and that the label was basically printed on a home inkjet printer, scent smelled very artificial, and there was not even the proper legal stuff on the label. Basically my wife thinks it was a homemade product, made by an amateur, and it&#x27;s probably not even a legal company/product. She&#x27;s really into bath and body products so takes it all very seriously and spends a whole lot more than I do on this kind of stuff. I felt pretty embarrassed so checked the reviews out online and found that pretty much all of them were from people who were basically given some kind of gift card to receive the product for free in exchange for a review. Was I the only person who really bought one. Anyway, I&#x27;ll leave the purchasing of beauty products up to my wife next time and save myself the embarrassment :(</li>
    <li> Real essential oil of lavender is in these bath salts and a very small amount of Vitamin E oil.  I enjoyed soaking and enjoyed the silky feeling of my skin afterward.  I did NOT get an oily tub and that&#x27;s a good thing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A full cup of salt is recommended and I know that would be an excellent, therapeutic sea salt soak (for the minerals) but I used less so I can get more tub time from my first jar.  Lavender smelled lovely and is a useful relaxation tool.  In fact, I&#x27;m thinking about leaving some of the crystals out in a small bowl just for the aroma.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the spirit of full disclosure, I was invited to try this product at no cost and provide my thoughts after using it.  It&#x27;s a lovely product that I&#x27;m enjoying very much.  Recommended.</li>
    <li> Bath Path lavender bath salts are the perfect companion to your bathtub.  Put the kiddos to bed, grab a book, a glass of wine and then shut the door!  You will be transported to a relaxing day spa in your mind where you can just let go and unwind!  This would make a great gift for anyone in your life looking to have a little “me time”.  Pair these lavender bath salts with a loofa, lavender body lotion and a mud mask and you will have a wonderful gift package for the women on your holiday list for under $30!</li>
    <li> This is by far the best mineral soak I have tried.  The lavender scent is strong and wonderfully relaxing.  It is well worth the price.</li>
    <li> I enjoyed my soak in the tub with these bath salts and with the jets to further relax me it was wonderful. The scent was strong in the jar but just about right in the large oversize tub that I have. I look forward to using them again soon for my next relaxing time in the bath. My skin was nice and soft when I dried off and the dryness on my legs was gone that I had before the bath. I can recommend these as a very nice way to have a relaxing soak.</li>
    <li> I was given a free bottle by the manufacturer with the agreement that I would write a review. I opened the jar and the lavender ish smell was overwhelming, but by the time my tub was full of water I didn&#x27;t smell it anymore. While in the tub my skin may have felt a bit softer than a water only bath, but that&#x27;s about it. Otherwise it didn&#x27;t seem any different than a regular bath. Considering how expensive it is, I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;d purchase it. But thanks for giving me the opportunity to try it.</li>
    <li> First of all I LOVE lavender, I have a lavender garden.  What I tend to dislike is lavender scented things like candles, oils, etc.  They tend to have an overpowering smell that stings my nose.  So whenever I purchase something with Lavender, it is usually with some apprehension.  When I received this product in the mail, the first thing I did was take off the cap and sniff, and sniff, and sniff again.  The scent is definitely lavender, and it was heavenly.  Then my son was caught smelling it repeatedly as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After my first 3 mile jog in years, I decided to give it a try hoping to soothe my muscles so I would be able to walk the next day.  I poured the recommended cup of salts into the warm water and let it work its magic.  I soon found myself eyes closed and completely relaxed - mind blank, a perfect end to a long day.  Had the water not eventually cooled, I would have easily fallen asleep.  As it was I climbed out of the tub and right into bed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin felt amazingly soft.  I was worried the salt would have dried my skin out a bit, but it didn&#x27;t, and I was able to walk the next day.  I was still mildly sore but not at all what I expected to be after jogging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My son ended up using the salts the next night, and he too went right from the bath to his bed.  He said \\&quot;that was so relaxing.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My one complaint would be that this one jar of salts only holds enough salt for two baths.  I wish it came in a bigger size!  I will definitely be adding this to my bathroom essentials... things that should always be kept on hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cherise Everhard, July 2013&lt;br /&gt;I was given this product in exchange for an honest review</li>
    <li> These bath salts are so relaxing and smell great.  They make me ready to go to sleep right after a nice long bath with them.</li>
    <li> I read the other reviews and some of them commented on the directions to use a cup of the salts for one soak/bath.  This \\&quot;recipe\\&quot; would be expensive adding up to over $7.50 per bath soak.  So I did it differently.  I have a large tub and used only about 1/8 of the jar for the first trial.  It was fine and relaxing.  I enjoyed the Lavender smell - it wasn&#x27;t too strong for me since my sense of smell has diminished.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been mindful of other types of these bath soaks since they can make the bottom of the tub slippery which can be a problem getting out or if you have a tub/shower combination, the shower floor can be dangerous.  This was another reason I used less of the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the first trial, I found the bath soothing and my skin was soft.  On the second night, I added a bit more, but not much and this was perfect.  My skin is quite soft and no irritation to my sensitive skin.  I am planning for eight(8) soaks from this jar without skimping on the full effect of the product.  I don&#x27;t know if anyone else thought one cup was too much, but I would have found it overwhelming.  I am very pleased and would buy the jar for more prolonged usage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure:  I was offered a coupon for the product but I paid for the shipping which was not inexpensive, it is a heavy jar.  I hope I could combine the bath salts with another product to reach $25 for free shipping.</li>
    <li> Bath Path uses a gentle, natural lavender fragrance infused in unrefined sea salt to create an incredible therapeutic experience. While most other bath salts I&#x27;ve used require whopping cupfuls, it only takes a few tablespoons to experience the full benefits.  I love how it leaves my skin with silky smooth glow and light lavender scent.  Worth every penny!</li>
    <li> A pleasant-smelling indulgence.  The GF likes her baths, and enjoyed the feel and scent of these bath-salts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The salt makes the water (and your skin) feel smooth/soft/different, much like taking a dip in the ocean feels different than swimming in freshwater. The scent of lavender is mild but distinct. The scent is obvious to me when I walk into the bathroom after the GF&#x27;s bath, but much milder than from using essential oils (or the cloying awfulness of products from mall chains like BathBodyWorks). There was a trace of the scent left on her skin, again pretty mild.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The salt dissolved just fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While this 16oz container would last for only 2 uses at the recommended 1-cup-per-soak, the GF found that half-a-cup was plenty, you may even be able to stretch it to 5 uses. Four to five uses make the pricing more reasonable, and for most people, a bathtub soak is an indulgent treat rather than an everyday thing-- a little splurge isn&#x27;t a bad thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[ I was given this product to review. I received no other compensation, and my review is my honest opinion. ]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommended for a luxurious indulgence.</li>
    <li> This bath salt soak is awesome for those with dry skin.  It makes my skin soft enough to shave without shave gel and such.  I highly recommend.  The smell is awesome.</li>
    <li> I admit it.  I&#x27;m a bit of a mess.  I have a serious sleep disorder and as a result I get tired and stressed easily.  One thing that is always guaranteed to help is a warm bath.  Normally I use bubble bath but when the maker of these bath salts offered me a free sample for review I jumped at the opportunity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the scent of lavender and I even spray my pillows each night with a lavender scented spray.  The Bath Path Mineral Sea Salt Soak comes in a resealable 16 ounce jar.  I loved that the ingredients are natural and only include the sea salt, vitamin E oil and lavender essential oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The instructions say to use a cup of the sea salt but I didn&#x27;t need that much.  I used maybe 3/4 of a cup and that worked well.  The scent of the sea salt is nice but a little light.  I would have enjoyed a stronger scent.  It did take a few minutes for the sea salt to dissolve and the result was that my skin felt more moisturized and I felt totally relaxed.  When I finally forced myself out of the bath tub I dried off and went to bed.  Thanks to the lavender scent on my skin and pillows I fell asleep right away and slept through the night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These bath salts do not leave behind the mess that bubble bath does so it was really easy just to rinse the tub with clear water after my bath.  That is a huge plus for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottom line is that I loved these bath salts and I&#x27;m going to put them on my Christmas list this year!</li>
    <li> ****NOTE: I was given a free product sample to try.****&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When opened, I found the Bath Path Mineral Sea Salt Soak to have a very pleasant, if strong, lavender smell.  The granuals themselves dissolve quickly and leave no residue.  The experience was very pleasant and relaxing, although I&#x27;m not sure if this is due to the salts or just a nice long hot tub.  This is not a comment on the salts - just hard for me to tell - I guess I don&#x27;t take enough baths to tell the difference.  However, the combination of the nice smell and the soothing bath salts makes for a wonderfully luxurious bath!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That being said, I followed the recommended usage amount (since I had been given the jar for free) which was a whole cup - or half the jar.  At that usage rate, you would be spending $8 / bath!!!  Needless to say, $15+ for a jar of scented bath salts is quite expensive when you can purchase twice as much epsom salts for $4.  Not that there is a 1 for 1 correlation - epsom salts isn&#x27;t the same as this product. However, since I don&#x27;t use bath salts, this was the closest similar product that came to mind.  However, I&#x27;m pretty frugal.  If you are not concerned with cost, it would probably be worth it.  My only further comment is that if the recommended amount is a cup, the jar should be larger.  As it is, buying another jar of the product after every other bath seems kind of ridiculous...</li>
    <li> I received a complimentary container of this product in exchange for an honest review.  I&#x27;ve used this twice and both times I was completely satisfied.  The scent of the Lavender was surprisingly relaxing.  It goes without saying that you probably need to really like lavender as it is a strong scent.  The scent of the lavender lingered on after my bath and as I went to bed which I felt really helped me fall asleep...  but, by the next morning it was gone.  I wouldn&#x27;t want to smell like lavender all day so this works for me!  I would recommend using this as a soak before bedtime.  It is a little pricey but goes a long way.  I imagine this one container will last a while depending on how often you soak.</li>
    <li> It got here very quickly and is extremely relaxing! Love the lavender fragrance too!</li>
    <li> My new favorite!  Has a lovely scent and it&#x27;s not overpowering like some others I have tried. You can&#x27;t go wrong with this product. There are no artificial ingredients or chemicals either.</li>
    <li> The smell is very relaxing. I am pleased with the purchase.</li>
    <li> Overalls pleased with product. Product is as described. Scent was not too strong.</li>
    <li> I won a gift certificate to purchase this item. Item arrived quickly. The scent of this bath salt is overwhelming. Even when used in the bath as directed the aroma is so strong it makes your eyes water.</li>
    <li> These are wonderfully scented bath salts. Premium quality and worth every &#x27;scent&#x27;. Couldn&#x27;t help myself. A little goes a long way and they are truly wonderful.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not a big fan of baths, but after being on my feet all day I thought that Bath Path Mineral Sea Salt Soak with Lavender would be just the thing I needed to give my feet a little pampering. Upon opening the jar you are greeted with a delightful lavender smell. In fact, you could use it as an air freshener all by itself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After letting the salts (I used about ¼ cup) dissolve in a bowl of warm water, I put my feet in to test the waters. I let them soak for about 15 minutes. It was very relaxing and it did take some of the achiness of the day away. The lavender smell was not too strong and it left my feet feeling nice and smooth. They are made of all natural ingredients...what&#x27;s not to love?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sample provided for review.</li>
    <li> I must say that Bath Path does provide a nice fragrance. As I have tried the product you it did soothe my aches away and relaxes the body. I did try the recommend amount, which is a lot. However, I tried a second time and you can cut the amount in half of the recommend amount. I notice that it did not leave a residue around the tub, which is nice. Honestly, I didn&#x27;t notice if my skin was smoother after use. Other than that it&#x27;s a nice product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Disclaimer*&lt;br /&gt;I did receive a sample from the company.</li>
    <li> This product works as advertised. I would recommend it to a friend. I don&#x27;t think scene more words are required.</li>
    <li> I carry a lot of tension in my back, so I&#x27;m all about long soaks in a hot bath, preferably with something that smells good and is not harsh to my skin.  This mineral sea salt soak is just perfect.  It softens the water, softens my skin, and the lavender scent is that true lavender fragrance that just makes everything in life better.  As other reviewers have mentioned, the directions say to add a cup of salts, but I use a third of that and it works just fine.  (But then, I have a small tub, so maybe that&#x27;s the difference.)  If you&#x27;re a fan of lavender, I would highly recommend giving this product a try.</li>
    <li> Bath Path Mineral Sea Salt Soak / B00DCNBST4&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a big fan of bath salts, so I was happy to receive a free review copy of this product from the manufacturer. I take baths almost nightly, and that tends to dry out my skin; I have to be careful what oils or additives I add to the water because my skin is very sensitive to artificial scents and perfumes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These bath salts have a pleasing subtle scent of lavender (not so much, to me, to be overwhelming, though mileage will vary on these things) and are great for moisturizing dry skin. I&#x27;ve used these every night for a couple of weeks now and have had no adverse reaction to the bath salts and I do feel like my legs and feet are softer as a result. I will definitely be buying more of these when this batch runs out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOTE: This review is based on a free review copy of this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;~ Ana Mardoll</li>
    <li> Every time I use this product, I sleep better. We already know lavender is an amazing warm and calming scent, but combine that with the properties of this bath salt and you&#x27;ve got yourself an incredibly relaxing bath experience. When you first open the jar, you&#x27;re hit with a bold (but not too heavy) scent of lavender and it&#x27;s gonna make you want to take a bath right then and there. This is such a treat after a long stressful day, and it has allowed me to fall asleep soundly (which has always been an issue for me). This stuff takes me away, to hell with Calgon. My muscles felt nice and relaxed as well. I highly recommend this product for anyone who&#x27;s craving relaxation. Your skin will feel smoother and supple, and a little goes a long way. Great stuff. The product arrived extremely fast and the customer service was great. I will definitely be back.</li>
    <li> The seller of this product offered a sample for my review, and while it&#x27;s not something I&#x27;d personally use, my wife and her visiting mother were both interested (and probably overqualified) in trying out a different bath product. I had both ladies try out the product without having read anything about it, other than directions for use. Having given both mother and daughter the opportunity to try out the bath salts and then confer with each other, I can report the following:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bath salts (very large salt crystals) have a pleasant, but not overpowering lavender scent (this I easily verified myself... they have a very pleasant and natural scent). While the directions indicate a full cup of the product (half of the 16 oz container) should be used, both my wife and her mother felt that was way more than necessary for a relaxing bath. Both women felt relaxed after their \\&quot;soak\\&quot; and my mother in-law actually actually dozed off after her bath and called it a night. Both women also felt that after their bath their skin felt smooth and was not oily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In summary, this product seems to live up to many of its claims. There really isn&#x27;t any easy way to prove or disprove whether or not it \\&quot;increases blood circulation, stimulates body&#x27;s natural release of toxins or kills germs and bacteria on the skin.\\&quot; What I do know is that both my wife and her mother liked the product. Quite frankly, my opinion is that IS the standard of bath and beauty products. Most of what these kinds of products claim to do is purely subjective. That being said, since both family members who tried these bath salts liked them, they ARE a winner in my book, and I feel comfortable recommending them to shoppers interested in a natural bath soak.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;******************************************************************************************&lt;br /&gt;Update&lt;br /&gt;******************************************************************************************&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wrote the above review nearly a year ago, and used my mother in-law as my test subject. I found it interesting that the next time she came and visited (this past March), she asked if any of this product was left when it was time for her bath. There was still plenty left in the jar and she finished it off before she went home. It&#x27;s little things like that which are good indicators of whether people really like a product or not... and now I don&#x27;t have to put any effort into figuring out what to send her for Christmas and birthdays.rly a year ago, and used my mother in-law as my test subject.

    <li> I could defiantly feel the salt working its way into my sore feet.  It was pleasant without being too strong.  The lavender scent was the same, very nice without being overpowering.  All in all I would recommend this as a great gift for someone who enjoys high quality bath products. I also want to add that my girlfriend loved it and it was not stingy or irritating (anywhere) like other bath salts she has tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Package looks good on your shelf, I would recommend that they thicken the plastic a bit, but other than that it is all you would expect in sea salt.I mean as long as they ship the real thing it should be hard to mess up right?  They didn&#x27;t mess it up!</li>
    <li> One of our favorite scents for bath salt is lavender. Bath Path mineral salts are made with white crystals and free of lavender dye colorings. I like to pour only 1/4 of the jar which is enough to fill the tub with nice relaxing aroma. This feels great after spending extra OT hours work from the office or just after a long day of strenuous activity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I notice is that the crystals are bigger than other bath salts; they resemble tiny pieces of rocks. Nonetheless, they disappear fast once it touches the water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great product.  Premium price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A sample of this product was sent to me for review purposes.</li>
    <li> We received a gratis sample of the 16 oz Lavender salts for objective evaluation, and offer the following for your consideration.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To test this product, our teenage son used these salts last Thursday after returning from a grueling volleyball match and then my wife used them tonight... after a particularly long retail sales work weekend. Following directions on the package, 8 ounces (1 cup) of the product was used in each application which fully used the canister&#x27;s 16 ounces (2 cups) of salts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While we do not have facilities to test the composition of the salts, trusting that the canister&#x27;s list is accurate indicates that this is a wonderfully natural item -- 100% sea salt, vitamin E oil, lavender essential oil. That is a nice touch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Initially, my wife was hesitant as she is not a fan of the heavy lavender scents one usually gets with candles, air fresheners and even some body washes.  However, both she and our son agreed that the gentle lavender fragrance of these salts was very nice, light, natural, and not overbearing whatsoever.  Even now, an hour or so afterwards, our master bathroom has a nice hint of lavender in the air.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Both agreed that these sea salts did the job; both finished their baths with a sense of physical and mental relaxation, which is what they needed. Checking back with them 30 to 60 minutes later, neither had any feeling of dry skin after use. Both used the tub&#x27;s jets during their baths, and this product did not cause and foaming or sudsing when the jets were in use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far this sounds like a five star review, right? I concur, and here are the opportunities we present to Bath Path (has little to do with the actual salts):&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Typical products sit on the 18 inch tile border around our master tub, all within easy reach of the bather. When our son reached for the Bath Path canister, his hands were wet from testing water temperature... and the canister&#x27;s lettering &#x27;melted&#x27; into a pool of gray-black ink on the tile. Our tiles have a gloss finish and good grout seal, so this caused no permanent staining. It&#x27;s like a bubble-jet printer was used to print the label; if so, that should be an easy correction to effect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good Mediterranean salts are not cheap, but $8 per application may be a price point that will deter some potential buyers. In response to a similar review comment, the seller responded that users really should try using 1/2 cup of the salts to start with and increase only if needed (based on personal taste). At 1/2 cup per bath the buyer would get 4 applications from this canister, lowering the per-bath cost to a very palatable $4. My recommendation would be that the seller consider revising the instructions on the canister to reflect his guidance. Of course, selling a higher volume quantity, like a 32 or 64 ounce canister, might allow the seller to help lower the buyer&#x27;s per-use cost too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom-line: My family highly recommends these natural sea salts. They agree that the fragrance was very nice and that the salts were soothing. With tweaks to the packaging this is easily a five star offering.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommendedgray-black ink on the tile.

    <li> Loved my foot soak and can&#x27;t wait to have a whole body soak! This is a great indulgence that will make you feel great!</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t encountered a product as sorry as this one in some time. First, if you use a cup of this, you get 4-5 baths from this jar that cost me nearly $16. A tad expensive per soak? And the aroma vanishes as soon as it hits the water. Then there&#x27;s the jar itself. The plastic is so thin and cheap it cracked along the seam when I tried to open it.  Pitiful. Save your $$ and buy something else.</li>
    <li> I really like this product in that it leaves your skin feeling renewed and soft. It dissolves quickly in the bath and gives off such a pleasant aroma. Very relaxing bath.</li>
    <li> dont really care for it</li>
    <li> Smells delightful and leaves me relaxed after a nice bath!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used these several times, they dissolve nicely, my skin feels nice after using and smell great. I wish the fragrance was stronger as it seems to disappear when added to the bath.</li>
    <li> Love this bath salts in my bath. Smells amazing and relaxing my bones...</li>
