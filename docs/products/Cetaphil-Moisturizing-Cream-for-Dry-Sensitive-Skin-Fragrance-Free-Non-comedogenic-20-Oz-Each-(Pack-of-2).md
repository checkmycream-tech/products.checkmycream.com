    <li> Good price and good product!  My children use them since they were born!  I purchased more than 30 this same jar</li>
    <li> my dermatologist recommended this to me about 15 years ago and i still use it.  great product esp. if you have sensitive skin. Price for the 20 oz double pack is great  compared to retail at Walgreens or CVS, esp since i know i will be using the product i stock up when i can.</li>
    <li> Great delivery for it went to the P.O. Box and it&#x27;s a great product.</li>
    <li> This is the very Best Moisturizing cream I have ever used.</li>
    <li> This is the best lotion/cream/moisturizer on the market.  as far as price is concern...this is it!  You will love the way your skin feels once you start using Cetaphil.</li>
    <li> Delivered before estimated. Good value! Great produce....</li>
    <li> The absolute best for dry skin.  Ditch the lotion and go with cream</li>
    <li> Cetaphil is a great product for fighting dry winter skin. It doesn&#x27;t have any scent. And the consistency is rather like spreading lard on your body. But the moisturizing effect kicks in almost immediately. So, think of Cetaphil as more of a medicine than a beauty treatment. I have been slathering it on my feet at night and sleeping with socks on. My feet haven&#x27;t looked or felt this good in years. Because Cetaphil doesn&#x27;t have a pretty, flowery scent it is a good product for everyone.</li>
    <li> Still my favorite no silly perfumes added</li>
    <li> Great product. It moisturizes without being greasy and cleans up with water if necessary.</li>
    <li> WHAT IS A EXCELLENT PRODUCT RECOMMEND ALL MY EXPECTATIONS FULFILLED IF POSSIBLE AND WE REQUIRE IN THE FUTURE, buy it AGAIN willingly, TIMELY YOUR CARDS ENTTREGA SELLER</li>
    <li> Sister product to Cetaphil Moisturizing Lotion, the cream supports the lotion.  Both were gifts to my sister-in-law whose dry skin is improving thanks to these two products.  Thanks, Cetaphil!</li>
    <li> very good cream base.  Not as oily as the lotion.</li>
    <li> I love this cream - it is readily absorbed and does a great job keeping my skin moisturized.</li>
    <li> Very good product for sensitive skin. My daughter has chronic eczema this helps her when she uses the medicated ointments and Cetaphil to keep her skin moist.</li>
