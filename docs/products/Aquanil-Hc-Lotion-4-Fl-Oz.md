      <li>It goes on easy and will not leave your skin feeling greasy.  </li>
      <li>It is a good product and highly recommended by my dermatologist.</li>

      <li>I&#x27;ve been using this cream for years (originally my dermatologist prescribed).  </li>

      <li>The seller provided quick service.  </li>
      <li>It absorbs quickly and is not greasy at all.</li>
      <li>This helps my mild rosacea breakouts to a point.  </li>
      <li>(despite being bald, with hopes that it would still work on my scalp skin), extremely mild soaps and lotions like &amp;#34;Simple&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;Eucerin&amp;#34; and many other &amp;#34;solutions&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;None of those have worked anywhere near as good as this Aquanil HC stuff which I stumbled across while reading some blogs about Dermatitis treatment</li>

      <li>The shipping was also very fast.</li>
      <li>Was sent on time and received exactly what I had purchased.</li>
      <li>Exactly what I wanted and got here in the time I was told.</li>

      <li>Aquanil HC lotion absorbs into the skin and stops itching immediately, just make sure you buy Aquanil HC, and not plain Aquanil lotion, because they&#x27;re different.</li>

      <li>Thank you Aquanil and thanks Amazon.</li>
      <li>a day after i deep clean my face with a clarisonic exfoliator.  </li>
      <li>Like I said, it does the bare minimum for my face which is to keep it calm and moisturized</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m usually having some kind of acne breakout on my face and despite the makeup I use and</li>
      <li>I mainly use it on my face, but do also use it on my body if i get an eczema spot.</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t believe I&#x27;m able to simply get dressed and go out in public now without worrying about red-spotted inflamed flaking skin around my face and head.</li>
      <li>I have used this for years and very much helps to calm skin irritations from allergens, dry skin, etc.  </li>
      <li>Highly recommended by our dermatologist.  </li>
      <li>Highly recommend</li>
      <li>Highly recommended.</li>
      <li>This has helped him and I highly recommend it.</li>
      <li>I have extremely sensitive skin and so many allergies, that I have to be very careful with the products I use.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t have itchy skin or rashes but the lotion definitely keeps my face calm during break outs and under my make up.</li>
      <li>Maybe for other people or other skin conditions it would be good, didn&#x27;t do the trick for me though.</li>
      <li>I only use it 3 times a week and use only small amounts each time but it does a great job.</li>
      <li>I have very very very sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>Its the exact same lotion i ordered from the pharmacy but about $5 cheaper.</li>
      <li>We are all quite unique and it may take using dozens of different compounds of the same product to find one that works.</li>
      <li>I first started using it back in 2001 when my dermatologist recommended it and have been using it ever since.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> My husband has used this product for years now.  It was recommended by our dermatologist and now its a staple.  We order it over and over again.  Sometimes I even use it and I like it also.</li>
    <li> I have a 1 yr old daughter who has eczema or skin irritation all over her face and body especially in the winter months. We went to dermatologist and got a prescription medicine called Verdeso ($40 after insurance - $150 without insurance). Verdeso is a topical steroid to reduce inflammation to the skin. It works wonder except it&#x27;s too expensive consider it&#x27;s a foam based and you dont get very much for the price you pay. On top of that we had to keep going to the dermatologist to get a prescription which another $40 copay.    I decided to look around online and came across this lotion. I figured for $16, it&#x27;s worth a try and I am glad I did because this lotion works like wonder. Definitely will buy again. I cannot find any complains about this product.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for six months now and have found it to be very beneficial in calming, dry irritated skin. I only use it 3 times a week and use only small amounts each time but it does a great job. Fragrance free and gentle for sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> My dermatologist gave me a sample of this to try to help with my irritation caused by shaving. I have tried all types of razors and shaving creams with no results. I used this lotion and it helped right away. If you are a man who gets those red bumps when your stubble start to grow back later in the day, try putting this on in the afternoon. It worked for me.</li>
    <li> Terrific stuff! It resolved flaky areas of my skin.</li>
    <li> This is a very good product!  this product will most likely work for people that have mild breakouts from eczema.  It goes on easy and will not leave your skin feeling greasy.  This order is my third bottle.  Just a little will usually do the trick.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product to keep my psoriosis off my face.  Works great if you use it daily.</li>
    <li> Doctor recomended for flacky skin around the face during cold weather.  I use this product and it seems to work well.</li>
    <li> This is the only moisturizer I use for my sensitive skin. I&#x27;m usually having some kind of acne breakout on my face and despite the makeup I use and whatever else I&#x27;m using to treat it, I know this product will do what it&#x27;s supposed to and not break me out.  I don&#x27;t have itchy skin or rashes but the lotion definitely keeps my face calm during break outs and under my make up. Like I said, it does the bare minimum for my face which is to keep it calm and moisturized which is the reason I don&#x27;t mid paying $15-$20 for it. PLUS it literally lasts me about 8-9 months because a little really does go a long way!</li>
    <li> Very effective on dry, itchy skin. I first used it as an RX from my dermatologist due to allergies. Not something I use daily, but works well for allergy season flare ups.</li>
    <li> This lotion was recommended to my husband by his dermatologist who has tried every cream on the market for his itchy and dry skin. This has helped him and I highly recommend it. The only down side is that it is expensive non prescription lotion but worth every penny, at least in my husband&#x27;s case.</li>
    <li> I have been using Aquanil HC for years.  It is the only product that consistantly keeps my skin condition under control.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this for years.  It is a great product.</li>
    <li> This is the best moisturizer, in my opinion. It&#x27;s medicated so it both heals and protects your skin. I&#x27;ll never switch products again. The shipping was also very fast. Can&#x27;t complain about anything.</li>
    <li> My dermotologist told me to try this lotion because my face is extremely sensitive, and it has worked wonders. My face is less red and scaly, and it doesn&#x27;t clog pores like other lotions. I would definitely recommend this to anyone who has dry, sensitive, or combination skin.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I wanted and got here in the time I was told.</li>
    <li> A great mild lotion for the face. Was recommended by my dermatologist. Love the stuff.</li>
    <li> This is a nice light moisturizer.  It is not greasy and it helps my itchy skin where other products failed.</li>
    <li> product is light on my face and i use it twice a day after i deep clean my face with a clarisonic exfoliator.  fast and prompt delivery.</li>
    <li> This is by far the best lotion I have ever used.  No irritation or burning.  It absorbs quickly and is not greasy at all.</li>
    <li> Works better than expected.</li>
    <li> This helps my mild rosacea breakouts to a point.  But if it&#x27;s a really bad breakout, this doesn&#x27;t cut it.  I need to get something else that&#x27;s stronger from my derm for those bad breakouts.</li>
    <li> This is a excellent product, as other reviews indicate. But because it contains hydrocortisone, should not be continuously used. My Dermatologist says alternate 5 days on HC and 5 days on plain Aquanil...Use the plain Aquanil for just cleansing and minor problems.</li>
    <li> Had a problem with flaky skin and red rashness under my facial hair (goat-t &amp; mustache). My dermatologist recommended this product (gave me a sample). It worked so bought this bigger size. Use 1-2 times a week and no problems at all.</li>
    <li> this product works great.  The seller provided quick service.  The person using this is bald and uses it on his scalp to protect from&lt;br /&gt;sun and wind.</li>
    <li> Love this product.  Really great for people with allergies to perfume and strong scents.&lt;br /&gt;Worth the money!</li>
    <li> This lotion has done wonders for my Seborrheic Dermatitis scaly flakes on my face. It has also helped reduce redness.  I use it nightly after using the Aquanil cleanser. I have tried it also during the day but it seemed to make my skin a little bit oilier.  It&#x27;s the only product that has worked for me and now  I can wear makeup without any issues and I feel like a  normal person again!</li>
    <li> This is a great moisturizer and anti-itch lotion.  I use it on my back for the typical hot, sweaty itch you get from leather furniture, and on my face where the skin is thin and you don&#x27;t want to scratch at sunburns.  The micro-particles that make up the moisturizer work especially well where heavier creams are not well absorbed - e.g. facial skin.</li>
    <li> I wanted this to work.  I really did, and it just didn&#x27;t.  Maybe for other people or other skin conditions it would be good, didn&#x27;t do the trick for me though.</li>
    <li> excatly what I wanted</li>
    <li> Broke out horribly.  Have rosacea...was so hoping once again for a miracle.  This burned as was applied too.</li>
    <li> I have dry skin, itchy skin, flaky skin--you name it. This product helps with all these problems and I use it every day.</li>
    <li> This is our &amp;#34;go to&amp;#34; cream for moisturizing  dry skin areas or abrasions.  This is a great lotion and recommended by our dermatologist.</li>
    <li> use this for eczema and facial rash on my child it work so well. it clear up her severe flares with in hours. it&#x27;s pretty amazing.</li>
    <li> This lotion is the best for eczema, besides steroids. It really clears it up and heals your skin. Other ointments and creams with hydrocortizone did nothing. This lotion changed my life. My eczema was all over my face. It was on my forehead, eyelids, nose, cheeks, upper lip, chin and cheeks. It was also on my neck and arms. Hot sunny weather and humidity were my worst enemy. My 2nd worst enemy was fragrance lotions and sprays. My dermatologist ran some tests and diagnosed me with atopic eczema. He then suggested I try this lotion. I told him that other doctors prescribed hydrocortizone ointments and creams, steroid creams. He insisted and I am thankful I agreed. This stuff was magic for me. It really kept my eczema at bay. Now I just take preventative measures for eczema to avoid major flare ups, but I am relieved that there is a product out there like this.</li>
    <li> Great product for itching and moisturiser.</li>
    <li> tHIS WAS GIVEN TO ME AS A SAMPLE BY MY DR. 8 HEARS AGO.  HAVE USED IT EVER SINCE EVEN ON PLAIN OLD DRY SKIN.</li>
    <li> This lotion is very soothing for very irritated, painful, skin.  It is on the expensive side, but it is an excellent product.</li>
    <li> Works well for me.  Seems a little pricey for what you get.  Also, the bottle was a slightly dirty &amp; showed some wear ... Not sure how these are handled prior to shipping.</li>
    <li> Works just as well as the expensive prescription-only desonide lotion.</li>
    <li> At 40 I tend to break out a lot (never did as a teenager).  My face has dry spots and I like to moisturize to keep wrinkles away.   All lotions I have used in the past (no matter how fancy or expensive have made the acne worse except for this one.  Now I am able to moisturize every day and my skin feels great!  I am glad I can but it online because the only pharmacy that I know carries it is 30 min away.</li>
    <li> I have used this for years and very much helps to calm skin irritations from allergens, dry skin, etc.  Will continue to use.</li>
    <li> as described - thanks!</li>
    <li> Love this stuff.  This is what my Dermatologist gave me and I love this for my rash.&lt;br /&gt;I will order agrain</li>
    <li> I have extremely sensitive skin and so many allergies, that I have to be very careful with the products I use. I just wish I had found this lotion sooner! It totally transformed my swollen, red, itchy, irritated skin. Since I have started using it, my face hasn&#x27;t shown any redness, there&#x27;s no more swelling, barely any itching and I just could not be happier! It worked -so well- for me!</li>
    <li> This produce arrived on time and in good order. It has helped with my skin itchiness and rash. Great product and best of all no prescription is needed.</li>
    <li> The container is small, but the price isn&#x27;t. It is a good product and highly recommended by my dermatologist. I am not to use anything else.</li>
    <li> This lotion is the greatest for itching. My dermatologist recommended it, but it&#x27;s difficult to find in drug stores, so I tried Amazon, and there it was! Aquanil HC lotion absorbs into the skin and stops itching immediately, just make sure you buy Aquanil HC, and not plain Aquanil lotion, because they&#x27;re different. They&#x27;re both good for lotions, but the HC is the one if you&#x27;re looking for something to stop the itching; it really works! It arrived quickly, and was exactly as described.</li>
    <li> I developed some kind of weird dry, itchy skin on my nose in my mid 20s and I had tried several different types of over the counter moisturizers and after going to the dermatologist, was prescribed some Elidel. I used this for awhile, as it was working. Then I was informed that it was only to be used for short periods of time so I had to find something else to use on an ongoing basis.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The dermatologist recommended Aquanil HC and provided me with a small sample. I have been using it after showering/washing my face for 7-8 years and it has made a huge difference.</li>
    <li> Highly recommended by our dermatologist.  If you have very dry skin this lotion will help alot to releave or eliminate the itch.</li>
    <li> Was sent on time and received exactly what I had purchased.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t get this product at any of the pharmacy stores ie: CVS, Walgreen&#x27;s, Safeway Pharmacy, Walmart.  Why not? Even though I have to go to Amazon to get it, it&#x27;s a good deal and a great product. Thank you Aquanil and thanks Amazon.</li>
    <li> Nothing like it... if you are having winter dry skin this is the lotion that puts life back in the skin!</li>
    <li> Have used this for years.  I also buy for granddaughters that have exema.  It&#x27;s a major help to them.  Highly recommend</li>
    <li> Cannot explain why this version of hydrocortisone works so well. It add micronized and removes lipids. That is part of the problem. We are all quite unique and it may take using dozens of different compounds of the same product to find one that works. This works for ME.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this cream for years (originally my dermatologist prescribed).  Going on 60 and still no wrinkles to talk about.</li>
    <li> My mother and I tried this for a while and saw little difference but not enough for a five(5) star rating. We will probably go to a dermatologist next time. Still liked the product though. thank you.</li>
    <li> This lotion is the best if you have eczema.</li>
    <li> Not oily and keeps my face moist with no dry spots</li>
    <li> Keeps dry skin moist thus preventing scaling.</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive skin and very coarse beard... not a good combo. I apply this product as my \\&quot;after shave\\&quot; and it has dramatically reduced shaving irritation, ingrown hairs and bumps. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> This stuff is a life-saver. I can&#x27;t believe I&#x27;m able to simply get dressed and go out in public now without worrying about red-spotted inflamed flaking skin around my face and head. I&#x27;m a bald guy with a tough case of seborrheic dermatitis (about the face, brow, ears, and scalp) and I&#x27;ve tried a TON of solutions over the years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over the past 15 years I&#x27;ve tried prescriptions like Desonide and Avar from my dermatologist, and even over the counter shampoos with Tea Tree oil and Selenium (despite being bald, with hopes that it would still work on my scalp skin), extremely mild soaps and lotions like &amp;#34;Simple&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;Eucerin&amp;#34; and many other &amp;#34;solutions&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;None of those have worked anywhere near as good as this Aquanil HC stuff which I stumbled across while reading some blogs about Dermatitis treatment solutions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was thinking &amp;#34;ok here we go again...&amp;#34; ... you know, thinking I&#x27;m going to try yet another lotion and it will fail like the rest, but this stuff surprised me.  It does an excellent job at curbing my dermatitis, without making my skin burn or flare up with red blotches. It has really made my skin so smooth for the first time in almost 2 decades and I just can&#x27;t believe it. I can go be with a group of friends now or even just go to the store without hiding behind my sunglasses and thinking everyone is staring at my messed up skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t believe no doctor or dermatologist ever thought to recommend this to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re reading this right now I know you&#x27;ve probably suffered through years the way I have, and I&#x27;m happy to say this works really well for me, so maybe it will work for you!</li>
    <li> Completed satisfied with performance of the product.  I would like to be able to use for longer periods of time, but the label directions limit that time.  Excellent service from the vendor.</li>
    <li> Very easy to apply and works as promised! Really great product.</li>
    <li> My dermatologist recommended this to me (along with the cleansing lotion) during a period of particularly bad inflammation several years ago. Initially, I used it daily as instructed but now I only use it for the occasional flare-up (since the active ingredient is a steroid) and my skin is usually cleared up within a few hours. I&#x27;m so glad I&#x27;m able to get it on Amazon since none of the drug stores in my area carry it and the samples she gave me were used up long ago.</li>
    <li> My wife is using this product for some skin issues and is having good success with the product... which is great.  The lotion is a hydrocortisone USP 1% and is anti-itch.  It is hypoallergenic, gentle and lipid free.  She has been using for two weeks now and so far so good.  She has recommended it to others.</li>
    <li> This is an awesome product!</li>
    <li> The HC was very effective on my skin.  I really liked it.</li>
    <li> I have very very very sensitive skin. I have eczema and granuloma annulare and this is the best lotion i have ever purchased. I first started using it back in 2001 when my dermatologist recommended it and have been using it ever since. It is not cheap but worth it. I actually prefer it over Sarna or Cetaphil lotions which are more commonly recommended to people. I mainly use it on my face, but do also use it on my body if i get an eczema spot. It doesn&#x27;t leave your face or skin greasy it absorbs right in and makes your skin feel so good. I use to have a local pharmacy order it over the counter for me but that was not as cheap as ordering it offline. I switched to ordering it offline and have been happy with the product that gets delivered. Its the exact same lotion i ordered from the pharmacy but about $5 cheaper. Can&#x27;t beat that!!</li>
    <li> I love this lotion. My dermatologist recommended this for me and I use it all the time. I will be buying this again.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff for irritated skin or after a chemical peel. I even gave it to my boyfriend because he always gets cold sores after he shaves. It really helps with inflammation.</li>
