      <li>AND I LOVE IT.</li>
      <li>I love these products</li>
      <li>I had better results within one week with the cheaper Oil of Olay Definity night cream (which if it were still being made, I&#x27;d recommend).  </li>
      <li>Aside from working well as moisturizer, this honestly did nothing special.  </li>
      <li>&amp; I worry about sun sensitivity using strong glycolic in the sunny months.</li>
      <li>brighter &amp; more even toned all well doing a great job moisturizing my dry winter skin.</li>
      <li>Now the redness is gone and my skin is silky smooth.</li>
      <li>Amazing how much cleaner my face is after using this product.  </li>
      <li>I am 52 years old and have always taken good care of my skin</li>

      <li>My skin was very irritated and it appeared to have a rash.</li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t seen much change, but it may take a while to produce results.  </li>
      <li>It was too much for my skin</li>
      <li>I was very upset that this caused my skin to feel like it was on fire</li>
      <li>Ive been using this line for 15 years + and will continue as long as they offer these fabulous products.</li>
      <li>Since I started using the Serious Skin Care glycolic line, I have had several people comment on how beautiful my skin looks.  </li>
      <li>This is only getting two stars because its performance for me is right on par with a cheap drug store moisturizer (and not equal to some Oil of Olay Definity line in texture results)  </li>
      <li>I highly recommend these products.</li>
      <li>I had high hopes and a faithful, nightly application but the magnifying mirror lies not...</li>
      <li>The entire serious skin care glycolic line is great for both men and woman.</li>

      <li>I do not have sensitive skin</li>
      <li>IT MAKES MY SKIN SOO SOFT</li>
      <li>I love Serious Skin Care products</li>
      <li>I really do love serious skin care and will order it again</li>
      <li>My face is so much brighter, my pores are almost invisible, and my skin stay&#x27;s moisturized all day long.  </li>
      <li>you apply it as per instructions, generously, and then the dead skin just kinda rubs off, leaving fresh, hydrated skin.</li>
      <li>Serious Skincare usually makes good products.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> The product does seem to moisturize. But I can&#x27;t stand the fact that it pills during the night leaving a mess on my pillowcase and sheets! 😕 I would not buy this product again nor would I recommend it because of this.  Debi B.</li>
    <li> works great! after a few days of use you can see the difference in your skin.</li>
    <li> There has not be a noticeable difference with my complexion after 3 months of use. Does not sting or tingle on the skin like hydroxy-acid formulations.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not what I was looking for.  I&#x27;m trying to replace my discontinued DDF glycolic night lotion, and this just wasn&#x27;t close enough.</li>
    <li> I love Serious Skin Care products but I truly hate this one. I was very upset that this caused my skin to feel like it was on fire and then broke me out. For the amount of money I spent I was expecting a lot more. My skin was very irritated and it appeared to have a rash. I then broke out with severe acne; I was truly embarrassed by this. I do not have sensitive skin so you can imagine how I felt when this took place. I would suggest trying this on a small area of your face before using all over. I would hate for you to have the same problems that I had.</li>
    <li> when I looked at the ingredients, it said &amp;#34;hydrogentated oil.&amp;#34; This is not good. We are supposed to avoid eating that, and the skin should not have that as well. I would like a repsonse from the company about this.</li>
    <li> if you want to exfoliate your skin because of issues with cracked skin, or eczema, you&#x27;ll be disapointed. This did not help my skin at all. I did find hope though, I started using a korean itally towel, and thats been helping me amazingly.</li>
    <li> There is nothing bad to say.  It works and smooths the skin.  I use at night.  Does not irritate my fair skin..</li>
    <li> I like the Serious skincare line so I am happy to start using this.  I have used it once and though the scent reminded me of Ponds night creme, it feels very good on my face.</li>
    <li> Skin tone and firmness noted even after first application.  Feels wonderful on the skin, and skin feels fresh after it is cleansed.</li>
    <li> This is only getting two stars because its performance for me is right on par with a cheap drug store moisturizer (and not equal to some Oil of Olay Definity line in texture results)  I have used the entirety of the bottle over the last few months along with the serum and cleanser.  I also have the mask although I admit I have not applied the mask as often as recommended.  With all that said, I&#x27;ve noticed no improvement in my skin tone or texture.  I&#x27;m 33 and have some issues with uneven tone, rather large pores, sun/old acne spots and generally dry skin.  Aside from working well as moisturizer, this honestly did nothing special.  I had better results within one week with the cheaper Oil of Olay Definity night cream (which if it were still being made, I&#x27;d recommend).  I had high hopes and a faithful, nightly application but the magnifying mirror lies not...no change...</li>
    <li> thank you I love these products</li>
    <li> Would purchase again.</li>
    <li> I HAVE BEEN USING SERIOUS SKIN CARE FOR AS LONG AS IT HAS BEEN OUT. NEVER TRIED THIS BEORE SO I ORDERED IT AND I LOVE IT. IT MAKES MY SKIN SOO SOFT AND IT GIVES IT GLOW. WILL BE GETTING MORE WHEN I RUN OUT</li>
    <li> The entire serious skin care glycolic line is great for both men and woman. Ive been using this line for 15 years + and will continue as long as they offer these fabulous products.</li>
    <li> got for a friend likes and still uses and continues to reorder</li>
    <li> This product works great just like I knew it would. I really do love serious skin care and will order it again</li>
    <li> you apply it as per instructions, generously, and then the dead skin just kinda rubs off, leaving fresh, hydrated skin.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this cream for a couple years I love it!</li>
    <li> I am 52 years old and have always taken good care of my skin but my skin seemed to had reached a plateau.  I did research online and decided to add glycolic to my regimen.  I decided on Serious Skin Care because it was affordable, and WOW WOW WOW!  I have been using the glycolic line for about 2 weeks and I am already seeing the difference in my skin.  My face is so much brighter, my pores are almost invisible, and my skin stay&#x27;s moisturized all day long.  Since I started using the Serious Skin Care glycolic line, I have had several people comment on how beautiful my skin looks.  I highly recommend these products.</li>
    <li> I always use Serious Skin Care face care!!  It makes my skin feel so dewey not greasy or oily .  Jennifer Flavin does a wonderful job with her products!!</li>
    <li> Love this product -- use it every day after taking off makeup.  Amazing how much cleaner my face is after using this product.  It exfoliates the residue makeup that my makeup cleaner misses.</li>
    <li> I would love it if it didn&#x27;t peel and rub off in pieces when I sleep</li>
    <li> I am a  fan of Serious Skin Care and have used many of their products, particularly within the glycolic  line. I was not overwhelmed with the Glycolic Cream.  It goes on smoothly and feels good on the skin however, it is a bit strong for my sensitive skin. I used it overnight as a night cream and also tried using it as a day cream. It was too much for my skin and I developed redness.  I now use it once a week or so rather than as a daily cream as I had planned.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t seen much change, but it may take a while to produce results.  It&#x27;s okay.  Serious Skincare usually makes good products.</li>
    <li> Good price...better than HSN.  Will keep buying here.  It makes my skin feel good</li>
    <li> This is the best stuff! I started using this line because other products left my skin rough and red. Now the redness is gone and my skin is silky smooth.</li>
    <li> Absolutely the best products I have ever used. Works amazingly well for my skin. I have tried a lot of products but this one beats them all. You get exactly what they show. A full size product. I am very happy with this purchase and 100 percent sold.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 36 had my first zit @ age 11 and acne has been a constant pain on my face since. I just stopped having cystic breakouts this year after about ten years and was left with deep scars and lots of discoloration. This cream is a freaking miracle! After just one use my skin felt so soft and hydrated! After One week of use -along with the glycolic wash, mask, retexturizing pads- my boyfriend of 5 years told me that my skin was glowing. Now one month later and the improvement of tone, clarity, texture is drastic! My dark spots vanished my scars have softened and my make up goes on smoother! What&#x27;s crazy is that this cream actually heals active breakouts! I had a couple of zits that came to a head- I steamed them and released the pus -gross I know- applied this cream and within a few hours them suckers were healed up and I could apply make up! If you have acne you&#x27;ve got to try this, I even ditched my regular acne wash! wow...</li>
    <li> I used this cream as my night moisturizer all winter &amp; my 43 year old skin never looked clearer , brighter &amp; more even toned all well doing a great job moisturizing my dry winter skin. I have used this with &amp; without the ssc glycolic serum and even without there was a noticeable difference after a week. I did stop using during the summer only bc I need a lighter moisturizer in this humidity &amp; I worry about sun sensitivity using strong glycolic in the sunny months.</li>
