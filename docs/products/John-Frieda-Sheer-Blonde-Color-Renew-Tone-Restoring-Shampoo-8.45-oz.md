      <li>Worked great for my hair.</li>
      <li>The shampoo smells great, but it dries out my hair.</li>
      <li>This is perfect but you don&#x27;t have it any more</li>
      <li>Of course, you have to use the conditioner also for best results and it leaves your hair healthy looking</li>
      <li>After dying my hair with a box kit two times my hair, to my dismay, turned bright orange.</li>
      <li>My hair looked just as good as it would have been had</li>
      <li>Not as good as I wanted.  </li>

      <li>I highly recommend this product to anyone with brassy tones, it is awesome!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m very impressed so far!  </li>
      <li>My hair was a bright orange brass color, it is now a cooler darker blond with light blond highlights.</li>
      <li>It cleaned my hair, made it feel silky and soft, and best of all, kept it from looking brassy for months after I lightened my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It is a VERY drying shampoo and I need to use a lot more conditioner, and added a leave-in (Neutrogena, which is very good).</li>
      <li>After just one good wash it looked almost cool-dark blonde at my roots and the high-lights are brilliant again.</li>
      <li>First use showed great results.</li>
      <li>I love this.</li>
      <li>and shiny.&lt;br /&gt;Def recommended  :)</li>
      <li>I love this product.</li>
      <li>then using the john Freida Go Blonder shampoo which I love...</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m sure it would work even better with the matching one.</li>
      <li>, it does not worst it.</li>
      <li>Another wash and I was back to nice medium cool-blonde with brilliant high-lights.</li>
      <li>I will not buy it for this price any more</li>
      <li>What bothered me was that she shipping cost more than the product itself</li>
      <li>I used this many times and it does work to remove brassiness.</li>
      <li>but it does work much better than Shimmer Lights.</li>
      <li>Leaves hair soft and smelling great.</li>
      <li>Smells great and hair is soft and shiny after use.  </li>
      <li>I will probably try a different brand (sulfate free) since it doesn&#x27;t do a great job of maintaining moisture.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t give a huge change, but a gradual one.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t see much difference, to be honest.</li>
      <li>I originally bought this shampoo when I ombred my hair myself.</li>
      <li>I love love love this product and will definitely be re-ordering.</li>
      <li>dont have feeling that my  hair is clean.</li>
      <li>Threw it right in the trash can!</li>
      <li>This shampoo does what the product says it does, it definitely brightens your hair, takes away the brassiness, and is perfect for blonde hair.</li>
      <li>Does dry hair out so you&#x27;ll need good conditioner.</li>
      <li>I read quite a few reviews of this product (great reviews)</li>
      <li>Works amazingly well, especially if you&#x27;re using on purple hair.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a good shampoo, I have been using this product for quite some time over the years, and it is getting harder to find.</li>
      <li>I own both Shimmering blue lights and this shampoo.</li>
      <li>Gives the fresh from salon look.</li>
      <li>Made my hair super soft and strong.</li>
      <li>Which it did right away.</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t expect it to, but it lifted the slightly muted brass/orange tones out of my bleached blonde hair wonderfully!</li>
      <li>The first two times I used it I noticed a slight change, but once I used it it the third time, I was impressed.</li>
      <li>It has kept my light blonde looking fresh and even after a month I don&#x27;t see any hints or orange at all!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m axious to see if it gets better after the next 2 uses!  </li>
      <li>In fact I felt it left my hair more brassy in the end.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>So far I have had luck using Enjoy clarifying spray with Suave clarifying shampoo...</li>
      <li>REALLY pay attention to the directions!</li>
      <li>I love this shampoo as it keeps the brassiness out of my blonde weaved hair color.  </li>
      <li>My hair pulls very brassy, so I was looking around for something like Shimmerlights but cheaper</li>
      <li>Thanks for the tip and THANK YOU John Frieda for selling this product.</li>
      <li>Didn&#x27;t help too much with the brassiness</li>
      <li>It helps somewhat if you use like 4-5 times a week and really lather it and let it sit in your hair.</li>
      <li>as for shipping it was fast</li>
      <li>so i dont  think this shampoo is helping him much.</li>
      <li>My hair at the time was really brassy and orange.</li>
      <li>I always pull brass and sometimes even cool no-lift/deposit only color turns my hair a brassy/coppery color.</li>
      <li>Kept my purple hear looking new for over 2 1/2 months !</li>
      <li>this is magic in a bottle (for my hair), my hair was recently colored ans was left brassy brassy brassy.</li>
      <li>So I had really high hopes for this product...</li>
      <li>but I do color my hair with high lift color about every 6-8 weeks.</li>
      <li>I have used Shimmer Lights in the past and loved it, but didn&#x27;t want to go out of my way to the specialty store when I saw this product at my local drugstore.</li>
      <li>I use with normal conditioner-</li>
      <li>After one wash I saw a huge difference and by the second wash, there was no longer any orange/brassiness left.</li>
      <li>(the bottles say you will see a difference after 3 uses) and I have to say, WOW!</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t notice at first until after several washes, but it&#x27;s worked great!&lt;br /&gt;Some</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s stayed pretty yellow after the bleach.</li>
      <li>So for me, it is a clear choice.</li>
      <li>Had professional highlights done, but the brassiness underneath from the strands that were not highlighted cont.</li>
      <li>I was worried that Silverlights or something would be too much, and this is just enough!</li>
      <li>since my hair naturally wants to go towards the red</li>
      <li>, I thought I lucked out because I had a whole bottle left over from my ombre hair.</li>
      <li>It washes the hairs natural oils out, thats why we use conditioner after, to put the oils</li>
      <li>My hair is soft.</li>
      <li>All the John Frieda products are extremely drying to the hair and just aren&#x27;t worth the money</li>
      <li>I used a lighter blonde that I normally do</li>
      <li>It really brings life back to my blonde hair.</li>
      <li>The only way I fixed it was to wash over and over with a clarifying shampoo.</li>
      <li>Barely turned platinum blonde !</li>
      <li>my hair seemed to be full and thick.  </li>
      <li>I was expecting more of a difference, more toning down of the brassiness -- and was slightly disappointed with that.</li>
      <li>It looks all muddy and VERY TONED DOWN.</li>
      <li>My hair feels less brassy,it really works....</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I read quite a few reviews of this product (great reviews) so I thought I would give it a go. Holy crap this is magic in a bottle (for my hair), my hair was recently colored ans was left brassy brassy brassy. The secret to this product is letting it stay in ur hair for a few mins (not just lather and rinse)... After two shampoos my brassy color is 90% gone, it&#x27;s a you have to try it to believe product.</li>
    <li> This was recomended by a friend...Not for me it makes my hair sticky and heavy.&lt;br /&gt;I dont have feeling that my  hair is clean.</li>
    <li> Thanks it was awesome</li>
    <li> works on color correction but makes me itch.</li>
    <li> This stuff did nothing to help the red tones in my hair and left it feeling very dry and brittle. All the John Frieda products are extremely drying to the hair and just aren&#x27;t worth the money</li>
    <li> Smells great and hair is soft and shiny after use.  However, it does not remove brassy tints as well as I had hoped and expected that result from very hard or well water.</li>
    <li> Shelling out upwards of $20 on fancy boutique shampoos is not in my price range. For less than half the price, this product is easier to find and works better than any other &amp;#34;blonde&amp;#34; product i have tried.</li>
    <li> Been battling brassiness for a few months now...recovering from some stupid mistakes I made with trying to color my hair myself. Had professional highlights done, but the brassiness underneath from the strands that were not highlighted cont. to show thru.  I saw this in the store and picked up the shampoo and conditioner and thought can&#x27;t make it worse! I used it once yesterday (the bottles say you will see a difference after 3 uses) and I have to say, WOW! Instant gradification for me.  I&#x27;m axious to see if it gets better after the next 2 uses!  My highlights are a much cleaner shade of blonde, no more yellow andthe red/brassy ugly tones underneath the highlighted hair are much less noticable.  I&#x27;m very impressed so far!  I would recommend using BOTH the shampoo and conditioner, i left the conditioner on for about 2-3 min while i shaved and washed the rest of my body.  Also when my hair dried (i have very thin fine hair) my hair seemed to be full and thick.  Thank you John Frieda!</li>
    <li> my hair was orangeish afterwards....</li>
    <li> I own both Shimmering blue lights and this shampoo. I prefer this shampoo. The smell is great and it works wonderfully. I didn&#x27;t expect it to, but it lifted the slightly muted brass/orange tones out of my bleached blonde hair wonderfully! I didn&#x27;t notice at first until after several washes, but it&#x27;s worked great!&lt;br /&gt;Some reviews have said the it drys your hair out.&lt;br /&gt;All shampoo&#x27;s do this people. It washes the hairs natural oils out, thats why we use conditioner after, to put the oils back in.&lt;br /&gt;I, myself, didn&#x27;t notice that my hair was dry as I follow after it with Aussie [[ASIN:B001F51PXA Moist 3 Minute Miracle Deep Conditioner 8 Fl Oz (Pack of 4)]].</li>
    <li> Just regular shampoo. It is does not do ANY correction for the blond hair as it said in the add. (Same as a conditioner) I will not buy it for this price any more, it does not worst it. I gave a lot of star, just because it does a cleaning shapmpoo-job well.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this shampoo for about three weeks and the first few washes I noticed the brassiness had died down a bit. Recently I have noticed the brassiness reappear. I will probably try a different brand (sulfate free) since it doesn&#x27;t do a great job of maintaining moisture.</li>
    <li> After dying my hair with a box kit two times my hair, to my dismay, turned bright orange. I decided to try an easier, and less damaging, route. After one wash I saw a huge difference and by the second wash, there was no longer any orange/brassiness left. I love love love this product and will definitely be re-ordering.</li>
    <li> I have been looking for anything to get the brass out of my hair. I always pull brass and sometimes even cool no-lift/deposit only color turns my hair a brassy/coppery color. Living in a sunny, ocean-salt saturated climate makes this even worse. Tried this after I read some good reviews and was really skeptical but desperate. After just one good wash it looked almost cool-dark blonde at my roots and the high-lights are brilliant again. Another wash and I was back to nice medium cool-blonde with brilliant high-lights. Thanks for the tip and THANK YOU John Frieda for selling this product.</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo as it keeps the brassiness out of my blonde weaved hair color.  My hairdresser recommended it to me.</li>
    <li> I adore this shampoo and accompanying conditioner. It cleaned my hair, made it feel silky and soft, and best of all, kept it from looking brassy for months after I lightened my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair always started looking gold, which along with my roots, made me look a little too trashy for my taste. I just washed my hair with these a couple of times a month, and it kept my locks just the shade of blonde that I wanted them to be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used my normal shampoo and conditioner the other days just because this one is more expensive. However, that didn&#x27;t hurt me a bit. My hair looked just as good as it would have been had I used them every day.</li>
    <li> I originally bought this shampoo when I ombred my hair myself. My hair at the time was really brassy and orange. I left the shampoo on for short amounts of time and long amounts of time and nothing. I figured my hair needed to be toned. I let my hair be. A few months later and I am now blonde. My hair stylist recommended I use a purple shampoo to fight brassy tones and protect my color, I thought I lucked out because I had a whole bottle left over from my ombre hair. Again, I used the shampoo for short amounts of time and long amounts of time and nothing. I used it with the John Frieda conditioner and without. In fact I felt it left my hair more brassy in the end.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Long story short: I&#x27;m going out to buy Shimmer Lights (or the GVP, imitation shampoo) today. I heard it works wonders.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t help too much with the brassiness</li>
    <li> Description does not match picture, besides that.  Works amazingly well, especially if you&#x27;re using on purple hair.  The die in it will maintain longer (5weeks in, still deep purple and counting)</li>
    <li> This is a keeper!! It really brings life back to my blonde hair. REALLY pay attention to the directions! Use no more than 3 times a week. YOU will have purplish blue hair if you don&#x27;t. Ummm not that I wouldn&#x27;t read and follow directions. Noooooooo.... .&lt;br /&gt;In all seriousness. My hair is soft. Has plenty of shine, bounce and even my curl holds wonderfully. I&#x27;m thoroughly impressed!! Well, once the blue washed out. Which it did right away.</li>
    <li> Worked great for my hair. Made my hair less brassy and a little darker. I only used it once a week. It can dry out your hair with overuse.</li>
    <li> I recently bleached my hair from a multitude of colors (almost black on longer bottom layers, reddish brown on the middle layers and dark blond on the shorter layers). My hair pulls very brassy, so I was looking around for something like Shimmerlights but cheaper and I found this. My hair was a bright orange brass color, it is now a cooler darker blond with light blond highlights. I love this stuff! The first two times I used it I noticed a slight change, but once I used it it the third time, I was impressed. I highly recommend this product to anyone with brassy tones, it is awesome!</li>
    <li> Works great on the brassiness. Does dry hair out so you&#x27;ll need good conditioner.</li>
    <li> Does not take the brass color out of my hair...not worth buying ....:(</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t know how badly I needed this until I used it. Sometimes you get so used to being brassy that you stop seeing it. Definite improvement, even on my dark blonde hair that had been previously dyed a copper red, leaving gross orange tones. I&#x27;m in the process of gradually lightening my hair with sun-in, and this has kept it from getting that fakey fakey look. I use with normal conditioner- I&#x27;m sure it would work even better with the matching one.</li>
    <li> This is really great.  I have naturally dark brown hair and now that I have blonde ombre I need to keep it from getting brassy.  I&#x27;ve used this a few times and have noticed a difference.  I&#x27;ll be using it every other wash I&#x27;d say since my hair naturally wants to go towards the red and I hate it.  Great product.</li>
    <li> I have used Shimmer Lights in the past and loved it, but didn&#x27;t want to go out of my way to the specialty store when I saw this product at my local drugstore. I have used almost all of a bottle of the shampoo and conditioner. The tone in my blonde was not affected AT ALL. Today I bought Shimmer Lights shampoo. After ONE USE I noticed a difference in my tone.  So for me, it is a clear choice. This product just did not work for my hair.</li>
    <li> Not as good as I wanted.  I&#x27;ll stick with Fudge products in the future.</li>
    <li> The shampoo smells great, but it dries out my hair. And I haven&#x27;t noticed any changes at all in the tone of my hair. It&#x27;s stayed pretty yellow after the bleach. This is after 2 weeks of use.</li>
    <li> Made my hair super soft and strong. First use showed great results. Giving it 4 stars because it takes a few washes to get the brassyness out toward the ends, and my roots are still kinda brassy.</li>
    <li> It does what it says it will but it is extremely drying. I would not it use it too often</li>
    <li> It helps somewhat if you use like 4-5 times a week and really lather it and let it sit in your hair. I bleached my cousins hair blonde and it turned out so brassy because he wouldnt let me use anything but 1 bleach session, he needed a second bleaching and some toner but he didnt want to.. So I got him this shampoo hopeing it will help a little. And it did but it dried out his hair he said. I also bought this for my brother cause he bleached his hair too and the sides are a little brassy, and he only showers like twice a week so i dont  think this shampoo is helping him much.</li>
    <li> I like it. It did take out some of the brass/yellow look that will sometimes happen to highlites due to minerals in the water. It brightens my blond &amp; refreshens the color.</li>
    <li> I would personally only recommend this shampoo/ conditioner for washing hair over a sink or with shower attachment. I unfortunately used whilst taking a shower and had a skin reaction to the ingredients. I have since noticed other reviewers have reported the same problem.</li>
    <li> Honestly I don&#x27;t see a difference, but still trust it</li>
    <li> This shampoo does what the product says it does, it definitely brightens your hair, takes away the brassiness, and is perfect for blonde hair.</li>
    <li> I used this many times and it does work to remove brassiness. Not a lot of stores around my area sell it but it does work much better than Shimmer Lights. Because it is a subtle, gradual change I only gave it 4 stars, I don&#x27;t think anything can beat Schwarzkopf&#x27;s Silver Shampoo! But, as a substitute if you can get this it works. Of course, you have to use the conditioner also for best results and it leaves your hair healthy looking and shiny.&lt;br /&gt;Def recommended  :)</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t see much difference, to be honest. I&#x27;ve been using it for over a month and have seen no results.</li>
    <li> I love this product. I always have an issue with my hair turning brassy within a couple weeks of coloring. I used a lighter blonde that I normally do and I knew I needed to get a product to try to combat the brasiness. I am so glad I chose this! I was worried that Silverlights or something would be too much, and this is just enough! It doesn&#x27;t give a huge change, but a gradual one. It has kept my light blonde looking fresh and even after a month I don&#x27;t see any hints or orange at all! I would recommend this for all blondes to keep their color looking great!</li>
    <li> I do like this shampoo. I think it might do what it says. What bothered me was that she shipping cost more than the product itself so it was not worth purchasing this way.</li>
    <li> So I had really high hopes for this product... To my dismay, it was horrible. I have almost platinum hair with some gold tones running through. I used this in hopes that it would make my hair less brassy and appear &amp;#34;brighter&amp;#34; as it states. It turned my hair purple/grey. It looks all muddy and VERY TONED DOWN. It darkened my hair about 2 levels and left me looking like Paula Dean&#x27;s twin sister. My hair is not damaged at all....but I do color my hair with high lift color about every 6-8 weeks. It should not have done this to my hair. The only way I fixed it was to wash over and over with a clarifying shampoo. After about a week and a half it started to look somewhat normal again. Ew! Threw it right in the trash can!</li>
    <li> It seems to help a little. My only issue is it is pretty drying, which is not good for bleached hair. Just make sure you have a good conditioner. Also I hate that if I place the bottle cap down or even lay it on its side it leaks like crazy.</li>
    <li> Great product ! Kept my purple hear looking new for over 2 1/2 months ! Barely turned platinum blonde ! If you have purple highlights or hair I would DEFINETLY recommend this hair product and as for shipping it was fast</li>
    <li> I was expecting more of a difference, more toning down of the brassiness -- and was slightly disappointed with that. It is a VERY drying shampoo and I need to use a lot more conditioner, and added a leave-in (Neutrogena, which is very good). I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again...</li>
    <li> My hair feels less brassy,it really works....</li>
    <li> This is perfect but you don&#x27;t have it any more</li>
    <li> I love this. I use it before - before I was a blonde - it gives silver color my hair.</li>
    <li> I unfortunately didn&#x27;t notice a difference..I have thin highlighted hair that turns brassy from well water.  Whenever I try this it totally dries out my hair and knots it...you must use conditioner with it!  So far I have had luck using Enjoy clarifying spray with Suave clarifying shampoo...then using the john Freida Go Blonder shampoo which I love...</li>
    <li> Brightens highlights just as good as salon products. Leaves hair soft and smelling great. Gives the fresh from salon look.</li>
    <li> works great for my hombre tips great recommendations from responses thanks.  recomended</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a good shampoo, I have been using this product for quite some time over the years, and it is getting harder to find.</li>
