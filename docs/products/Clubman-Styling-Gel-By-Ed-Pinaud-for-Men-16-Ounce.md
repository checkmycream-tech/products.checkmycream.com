<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Found out about this gel through my barber. This is a staple in his shop and never fails. Don&#x27;t need to overuse like other gels. This thing is a classic.</li>
    <li> good soft hold, great smell, no flakes</li>
    <li> i am not one to overly indulge in cosmetics by primping and polishing.But recently i started using(and i cant say why) hair gel. and i am glad i did. I found this hair gel to have a mildly pleasant scent (something similar to some sort of exotic papaya or mango?) and a non-oily texture. just a small dab massaged than brushed through your damp hair is all you need to keep your hair styled. the only surprise i found is after your hair dries you my find that it feels crusty(?) or plastic-like when you touch it! this disappears when you brush your hair and is only a minor criticism. i plan on adding this to my Amazon &#x27;subscribe and save&#x27; items.</li>
    <li> Powerful for sure.  A little goes a ong way.  I use brylcreem mostly but once in a while I break out this gel.  Good stuff, just don&#x27;t over do it, heh.</li>
    <li> Still my favorite but hard to find.</li>
    <li> Best men&#x27;s hair gel.  The scent is light, masculine, and dissipates quickly.  The gel is also light.  Not clumpy and crusty.  Leaves hair clean feeling and well managed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Can&#x27;t beat the price and quality of Pinaud.</li>
    <li> I like this styling gel.  I don&#x27;t use much, and it just a subtle hold.  Its not greasy and it doesn&#x27;t dry hard unless you use a lot of it.  16 oz should last me a long, long time and can&#x27;t beat the price..  It also has a nice smell that&#x27;s not overpowering or too &amp;#34;chemical&amp;#34;.  I put it in my wet hair after the shower, then partial blow dry and style.  You wouldn&#x27;t know its there.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t leave hair stiff. Provides good lasting hold for styling</li>
    <li> This hair gel works great and for a few bucks it will last a while. It doesn&#x27;t leave your hair all crusty or shiny looking, and is not greasy feeling. It does have a scent that goes away after a really short period. I will definitely buy again when I run out.</li>
    <li> After using different hair gels over the years this is the best I&#x27;ve found...  No flakes or buildup, works great.</li>
    <li> It works as advertised, has a nice manly smell and is a bargain.  It&#x27;s really stiff, though..</li>
    <li> Easy to apply, great hair hold without being sticky, flaky or drying. I can imagine this one can lasting me for at least a year!</li>
    <li> Been using this gel for years. Pinaud has always had good products.</li>
    <li> The product was delivered as promised and was as advertised.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite hair gel. It doesn&#x27;t flake and has a pleasant scent. In my opinion, it is the best gel for the money.</li>
    <li> When I received this product it seemed like it had been opened.  Not sure why. Thus I did not give it 5 stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However when I used it, it has pretty good holding characteristics and reasonable smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will use this product when I go out to something a little more formal and need that slick, crispy gelled look.</li>
    <li> I thought this product was going to have a strong hold on the hair, but it only gives the wet look, doesn&#x27;t really shape your hair unless you have medium long hair</li>
    <li> I really like this stuff, first it only takes a small amount to style my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second once my hair dries it isn&#x27;t flaky or greasy looking, as a bonus the gel itself smells pretty good. I rather like that I smell a bit like a barber shop after styling my hair each morning.</li>
    <li> Decent gel with a decent hold.  The smell of the gel is a bit like Brut aftershave (not bad, but to each their own).  The gel holds well, but doesn&#x27;t add any body to your hair at all.  I have thin blond hair, and this gel doesn&#x27;t do it for me.  I am a fan of Garnier Fructis Fiber Gum Putty, but tried this to see if an alternative gel could save me some money.  I would kinda compare this gel to a manly smelling LA looks.  I will continue to buy my gum putty instead...</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for years to keep my hair from flying all over. If the barber cuts my hair too short I just spike it up with this stuff. When it grows out I use Clubman Styling Gel to make it lie somewhat flat. If I forget to use it my hair just sticks straight out from my scalp. As I said, this is just a great product for a very reasonable price!</li>
    <li> I have used this for many years, after finding out about it from an old Air Force barber.  This is a great product! Although it is green, it disappears when applied, and always works well.  In cases where it does not provide enough hold, a damp comb solves the problem instantly.  Highly recommended for any man.</li>
    <li> This gel is one that can be used for all types of hair. I personally use it to style my hair up and it works all day when I do use it.</li>
    <li> Worked nice, holds hair well, looks slick, feels old fashioned in a classy cool way, I would get this again</li>
    <li> The gel does it&#x27;s job, smells great and is an excellent value for the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only disappointment was that it feels too lose and liquid compared to other products I use.  This may be a pro for you if you prefer that consistency.</li>
    <li> This is the Gel my barber uses on my hair. I&#x27;ve tried other brands, but they don&#x27;t seem to hold like this one does. If you comb it through it should take out any residual gel residue, and if you blow dry it after, it should take out some of the shine.</li>
    <li> As I age my hair becomes thinner and more flyaway.  This stuff works great, keeps my hair in place.  Those who don&#x27;t like stiff hair can just run a comb or brush through after the gel dries, still holds hair in place and your hair isn&#x27;t glued together.  I will buy more of this, although I only use a dab and one jar should last a year or more.</li>
    <li> Great product with good hold that brushes out soft. Love the scent, subtle yet manly.</li>
    <li> Came across this very randomly when my dad asked me to order some since his local supplier stopped carrying it.  I have never really used any hair product but figured I&#x27;d try a jar out.  I am very pleasantly surprised in how well it works!  Just a small little dab of this stuff applied to damp hair and them combed in keeps my hair in place nicely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What else can I say, it&#x27;s simple to use and works well.  Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used it a couple of times but I really like the small and texture.&lt;br /&gt;oh and the bothe is bigger than I thought</li>
    <li> ITEM ARRIVED QUICKER THAN I EXPECTED.  EXCELLENT PRICE AND PRODUCT.  I HAVE BOUGHT THIS ITEM IN STORES IN THE PAST BUT WILL BE ALWAYS BE PURCHASING ON AMAZON</li>
    <li> Love the smell of Pinaud products. This gel is inexpensive. A little goes a long way. Makes my hair easier to comb when wet. Combs out easily when dry.</li>
    <li> This stuff is awesome! It provides a really good hold that does not get flaky at all. Has that great clubman smell too. You can do a dry look or a wet look really well.</li>
    <li> Good old barber shop hair gel.  I absolutely love the stuff.  The best part is that if you run your fingers through it after it sets it does not flake.</li>
    <li> I really like it so far  ,  makes my hair look healthy</li>
    <li> Great Stuff!  Not the sticky hard gel you buy in stores.  Truly a mans product!</li>
    <li> Works well without making my hair crispy.  The sort of &amp;#34;minty&amp;#34; smell is a little bit too strong.  Think I will try something else next time.</li>
    <li> cannot beat this gel for the price. Works great for me. Last all day for me holding my style in place.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my 15 year old son so he can control his thick, wavy hair.  He likes it better than the suave stuff he had.  I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s like Dippity-Do! It&#x27;s okay but not the best for my fine hair.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my son. He and his room-mate are both using it and love it because not only does it hold well, but it never flakes.</li>
    <li> As title was put, yes, this is one of the best gels that I&#x27;ve used in regular price range. Not sure about expensive Salon versions-I used KMS, but nothing more impressive than this, with double or tripple the cost. The scent is mostly for guys though.</li>
    <li> This product may be older than your grandpa but it does the job superbly. The hold is perfect and it never flakes.</li>
    <li> Cheap, holds my hair just fine, smells like a man should. If you use spray deoderant, like the smell of products like Axe, and don&#x27;t feel right unless you&#x27;re spending half your paycheck on your appearance - don&#x27;t buy this. If you like smelling good, looking good, and haven&#x27;t watched MTV since they played music, this gel is for you.</li>
    <li> Good price and product but I might try the heavier duty stuff text time.</li>
    <li> Nothing fancy, just some good, old-school men&#x27;s hair gel that gets the job done. I typically use it right out of the shower, rubbing it into damp hair and then blowing it dry before I apply a little pomade to finish it. Works great, has a light finish, manly (?) smell and gives my hair natural, light hold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PRO:&lt;br /&gt;1. A light, manageable hold. Not stiff and sticky.&lt;br /&gt;2. Smells more manly than many gels I&#x27;ve used. (This can be a pro or con, depending on your sensitivity.)&lt;br /&gt;3. A little goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CON:&lt;br /&gt;1. This tub is HUGE. Seriously. I have a feeling it&#x27;ll last me several years. Should have ordered the smaller size.&lt;br /&gt;2. The smell is both manly and somewhat old-school barber ship-y. Depending on what you like, you might love it or you might hate it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, good stuff. I&#x27;d definitely buy it again.</li>
    <li> do not like the smell.</li>
    <li> It holds, but it smells weird and is very thick. I ended up mixing it with a weaker gel to get it to not be too strong. If your goal is to not run gel through all of your hair, go for it.</li>
    <li> top notch hair gel for difficult hair</li>
    <li> I have used tons of different hair products and decided to see how this one was since I enjoy Pinaud&#x27;s aftershaves. It provides no body, no hold, and just slicks your hair down. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend buying this product.</li>
    <li> I love this gel. It is the epitome of a man&#x27;s gel; it holds well and smells like a barber shop. I have a lot of hair and prefer to wear it slicked back. This gel does the job perfectly, I would suggest this to any man who wants a strong hold for the entire day.</li>
    <li> Love the logo, love the smell, love the light non-crispy hold. I just wish it came in a glass bottle so I could show off the label.</li>
    <li> Seriously, this stuff smells great. It has a nice hold without being super goopy.  No more store bought stuff just get this and be awesome.</li>
    <li> it  wont last long, basically I need to reapply on mid afternoon  just to have my bangs not fall on my forehead. And I work in an office and not outside, where it&#x27;s humid or windy. I dont understand the high rating for this product. I wont buy this product again.</li>
    <li> Sorry guys, I&#x27;m not a hater at all, I like the smell in fact. But the hold is awful. I have very thick, mildly curly hair. It did not hold for me, hair just falls right down. Not comparable to American Crew Fiber or also this &amp;#34;Mitch Reformer&amp;#34; I recently got from sport clips. Both have way stronger hold and will last more than a day. I was so shocked at the disappointment after reading so many stellar reviews. Had to order another product from amazon as this was what i was going to use daily. Definitely wont be finishing this tub of goop.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. Great,  classic barbershop scent. Goes well with the Pinaud aftershave. A little bit of this stuff goes a long way!  I plan on buying again once I run out! Also plan on buying more Pinaud products as well. Very classic, masculine fragrance at a low cost. Shipping was fast.</li>
    <li> Good product at a GREAT price. Fast Shipping! Super hold, when combed out, leaves my hair super soft, my wife loves the texture of my hair! Also just found that Sally Beauty Supply stores sell this behind the counter for $4.29 in my area!</li>
    <li> Based upon the AMAZON reviews, I purchased this product for my husband and he likes it.  It&#x27;s a nice alternative from the more expensive brands.</li>
    <li> Very good hold and it smells like being at the pool, like suntan lotion and chlorine. I really like using this for every day at work it works with most of my aftershaves/colognes. It&#x27;s also water based so it comes out with a quick splash of water.</li>
    <li> I bought the Clubman gel after reading reviews about it on the Art of Manliness. I have been using Axe pommade, which I really like, but I wanted to try something a little more sophisticated. This gel fits the bill. It smells great, kind of like an old time barber shop, yet clean and manly. The hold lasts all day and the subtle scent lasts too. All in all, I am very impressed with this gel, and I truly feel like it is for men. Axe always felt a little trendy and like it was made for spiky hair!</li>
    <li> Simply do not like this product.  Full of chemicals I can&#x27;t pronounce and has a nasty residue left over.  Great for the price, but is simply a cheap gel</li>
    <li> Not bad for the price, I&#x27;ll be ordering a stronger hold though.</li>
    <li> great price, as advertised</li>
    <li> Best hair gel ever if you and old fashioned guy like myself.  - Clyde</li>
    <li> Great hair gel with great hold. Has the classic clubman scent. Will be the only gel I use from now on.</li>
    <li> Very good goo for those who have independent hair.</li>
    <li> This stuff is light enough to wash easily off my hands when I&#x27;m done. I don&#x27;t have a ton of hair, so this provides just enough control to keep things looking good. I&#x27;ve always been a fan of Pinaud products, and this is no exception.</li>
    <li> I prefer Brylcreem. This is pretty much like any other gel, stiff and sticky.</li>
    <li> This goop is absolutely terrible. No Hold, Greasy, Smells like an old man. Stay clear, do not purchase this product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always bought the cheapest gel on the shelf, with the strongest hold, but I finally got fed up with the greasy feel that many of them had. I switched to Clubman and couldn&#x27;t be happier. I can just use a little in my damp hair and it holds all day. It&#x27;s not the strongest hold compared to some of those hard like rock spike gels, but it does great for me, I spike the front of my hair and it stays up (my hair is thin and semi short at a couple of inches in the front). I find that the scent is light and fades quickly which I like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One other note: This product is listed twice on Amazon, one listing has a choice of 1 pack or 3 pack of 16oz and the other a choice of a 3.75oz or 16oz. I first bought the 16oz from the first link below and later found the 3 pack to be the lowest cost per oz so I purchased it from the second link below (prices change so check for yourself) and they were the same product just listed twice on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B0009QZYII Clubman Styling Gel By Ed Pinaud for Men, 16 Ounce]]&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B0016DA62C Clubman Original Styling Gel 16 Oz]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They also have a stronger hold gel if that is what you prefer (haven&#x27;t tried it myself): [[ASIN:B00112TIIQ Pinaud Clubman hair styling gel, super hold - 16 oz]]</li>
    <li> Husband loves this gel.  Great price.</li>
    <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong with this gel, especially for curly hair, it styles and holds without an impossible grip. Great buy.</li>
    <li> Heavy scent. &amp;#34;wetter&amp;#34; hold, appears wet. It&#x27;s on OK product, but not a legit replacement to Steadfast or Layrite - just my opinion.  i prefer the waxier stuff.  This stuff is really goopy and liquidy, but it does get the job done.</li>
    <li> I love this gel.  It smells wonderful and holds like it is supposed to without  being too stiff. Recommend highly</li>
    <li> Yes! Finally a hair gel that doesn&#x27;t smell like a pimply faced boy!</li>
    <li> A good basic gel with that old school smell</li>
    <li> Love this gel and this is comming from someone who used American crew for years and I started getting white flakes and knew it was time to change the product.  Before using this I even used gels from loreal and other companies but clubman was the best.  First no white flakes and it gives perfect shine and hold for the whole day.  Lastly it has the classic smell.</li>
    <li> I am not that obsessed with what I put on my hair, but I want quality and I don&#x27;t want results that I&#x27;m not looking for.  This product comes in a large jar (16 ounces) and it does not leave a residue.  Only a little is needed to get a controlled look and my hair is not greasy or crunchy.  If you want crunchy hair, this is not the gel for you.  The smell is pleasant, but not very strong.  I finally found a product that hits the mark on what I am looking for.</li>
    <li> My husband loves this product and his barber quit selling it.  It is a great product and it smells fantastic, too!</li>
    <li> Loving this product, smells good, works well. I&#x27;m not huge into &amp;#34;doing my hair&amp;#34; everyday. I just am an average dude who wants to look decent. a dab of this in my hands and a shake through the hair and I&#x27;m done. perfect. plus no large amounts of grease look. and my hair still looks good into the next day. showers out well. it will make your fingers sticky a bit, but just wash them or wipe them and its gone. Awesome Product</li>
    <li> usually buy by the &amp;#34;barbar shop&amp;#34;...this is a great product...does not leave hair greasy...</li>
    <li> The scent will take an old timer back to the kiddie seat at the barber&#x27;s and that&#x27;s not bad. But, age aside, it&#x27;s a clean gel with just enough hold. I use it sparingly, on wet hair, and the effect is clean and natural.</li>
    <li> This product was used on my son&#x27;s first barber haircut and I&#x27;ve been buying it ever since. (He&#x27;s 19 years old) It keeps his hair in place, not sticky and it has a pleasant scent.</li>
    <li> This product smells great but I docked a star because I don&#x27;t like the wet shine after. I was hoping for a more natural matte look.</li>
    <li> i cant seem to find this gel in the stores anymore. I am happy i was able to find it online. I have been using this gel for years. Its cheap and it works great.</li>
    <li> If  you could bottle Earnest Hemingway and turn him into a hair gel this would be him.  It&#x27;s just like others have said, it works well, no flakes, just the right amount of give.  And it smells like a man.  If you like axe and aerosol body sprays my advice would be to move along and search for another product.  If you are a man that enjoys smelling like a man .... check this out.</li>
    <li> Unfortunately, this product did not satisfy me at all. I have longish hair and it did not do much to control my hair. Duration of control, what little there was, did not last but a few hours. Do not recommend for long hair.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s been a long time since I&#x27;ve enjoyed this product.  After my barber died, I didn&#x27;t think I&#x27;d ever see it again.  I cut my own hair using a hair cutting kit bought off Amazon, and after more than seven years, I found that I needed some kind of hair gel again.  Only thing I could think of was the infamous Clubman hair gel.  Thank God for Amazon, they&#x27;re the only place I&#x27;ve found that has it.</li>
    <li> My hair is very coarse, and this gel is one of the few (that doesn&#x27;t stink) that can &#x27;do&#x27; the job.  I used to use Rusk fx, but found it too expensive in the long run.  Also, my wife likes the scent of Clubman better.  It is non-greasy, and seems to re- activate with a little bit of water fairly well.  The only drawback is that I can&#x27;t squeeze this gel into a 3 oz. travel container, so I keep a small stash of Rusk fx for that purpose.</li>
    <li> Does the job and it does it well... it holds your hair in place with medium hold and there is not a speck of flyaway hair.  I have been using this brand of grooming products for years and I have never been disappointed.  If you&#x27;re new to Clubman you&#x27;re in for a real treat, if you already know what I&#x27;m talking about chances are you already have this hair gel in your medicine cabinet already...</li>
    <li> Its OK for the price, Crew gel it is not.  Not sure if I&#x27;ll buy again or not.</li>
    <li> Great smell and great hold. Doesn&#x27;t feel greasy and hold just enough. Leave a nice shine but not to shiny. Will be buying again.</li>
    <li> Too early to rate this product.  I started to use it and it will be a while to rate it.</li>
    <li> This is just the right hold and fragrance for me. I find the fragrance compliments my use of Clubman hair tonics as well, which I was doubtful about until I tried it. I have been through a lot of pomades and gels to find one that works best a majority of the time. So far, I&#x27;m rating this as the best product for me.</li>
    <li> Excellent gel, not to strong but enough hold to do the job.  I like the fact that when it dries it&#x27;s not so hard and crunchy as other gels.  Also, other gels tend to dry my hair and scalp out after a couple days in a row of use.  This gel has never dried out my hair or scalp and I&#x27;ve been using it over 6 months.  The smell is pretty good too.  If it had more of the original Clubman after shave smell I&#x27;d give it 6 stars.  Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> Hold is fine, smells ok.  Would be better if there was a pump version and maybe it&#x27;s weird, but not sure I like the fact that it is green?  It seems to dry clear, but still, I am sure they&#x27;ve had to put dye in it to make it that color.  Every other hair gel I&#x27;ve ever used is clear.</li>
    <li> Not stiff.  Great hold.  Don&#x27;t use too much.  That clean barbershop scent.</li>
    <li> This is the only gel my husband has been using for years.  It leaves his hair manageable without the greasy film that other gels have.  He uses it once in the morning and he&#x27;s good for the whole day!</li>
    <li> Love this gel. It holds great with just a little and has that classic smell.</li>
    <li> Great scent, use conservitavely. Works without flaking or hardening glue as many others out there have that issue---EX-LA Looks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall a better value and this Amazon reseller ships ultra fast------BUY IT!!!!</li>
    <li> I think it is a Good size bottle, will last for quite sometime.  It makes the hair a bit stiff though...</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;m using this stuff wrong or what but I can never quite get it to work for me. Too much and my hair just clumps and becomes crusty for the whole day and too little and it does nothing. While it isn&#x27;t greasy, I suspect this may be the problem since I have very thin and dry hair. The only thing that seems to help is diluting it a bit my hands with some water before I put it in. Smell is fine with me but my girlfriend doesn&#x27;t like it... a bit too chemical smelling.</li>
    <li> Nice smell and holds good.</li>
    <li> The best thing for my hair...love the texture and aroma...</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this for years.....it&#x27;s the best!!!!</li>
    <li> I have used this product before and it does control your hair well. Only four stars as the packaging should be updated to a squeeze bottle, not. Jar.</li>
    <li> The hold is great, and it isn&#x27;t flaky.  Of course, if you run your hands through your hair, it will dislodge some of the &amp;#34;dusty&amp;#34; particles, but the important part to me is that it doesn&#x27;t look like I have dandruff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I prefer a dry look, and this does the trick.  I&#x27;ve used a lot on occasions when my hair was thickest, and it blends in very well.  It&#x27;s not itchy or greasy after it&#x27;s dried, and it comes off your hands very easy with a little soap and water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You do need to make sure to mix it in well.  If you leave a glob on top of your head or scalp, it looks exactly like you&#x27;d expect from the bottle: a green blob.</li>
    <li> same as the after shave... awesome hold and smells good too... reasonable price for what you get.... you don&#x27;t need much for a good hold!!</li>
    <li> This is a great product.  Other gels tend to become crusty when dry.  This gel doesn&#x27;t.  It holds hair in place but is not noticeable when dry.  If you want good hold without the obvious appearance of gel, this is the product for you.  It&#x27;s also very cost effective.  I have mad a a subsequent purchase since my first buy.</li>
    <li> one of the best I have used</li>
    <li> I had used LA Looks Mega Mega Hold.  Never again.  This doesn&#x27;t flake like LA looks nor does it have as much of a greasy feel.  However, it still does a good job of holding my stubborn hair in place without too much of the &amp;#34;gel look&amp;#34;.  I&#x27;d imagine that there might be better products out there but they&#x27;d probably cost double.</li>
    <li> This product is better than expected. It works well and has a fragrance that reminds me of the old time barber shops. Nice!</li>
    <li> This hair gel is the best and the price is right smells nice and does not dry too hard and stiff.</li>
    <li> Does the job.  Not crusty or too shiny.  Not too crunchy, although there is a little.  Not oily.&lt;br /&gt;Five stars for performing exactly as advertised.</li>
    <li> Smells good but doesn&#x27;t hold hair in place as well as I would like it to. It still works for longer hair and trying to get it to one side but not for styling purposes for the most part...</li>
    <li> Now my hair smells as manly as my face looks ;)</li>
    <li> Like those obnoxious Bluebell ice cream commercials, this product harkens back to a simpler time. I think we can all recall getting some Clubman gel at the barbershop after our childhood haircuts. However, unlike 80&#x27;s movies which seem horrifyingly cheesy when you watch them today, Clubman gel has aged well. It works well, leaves minimum residue, and leaves you smelling like 1986.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Feeling like Maverick today? I thought so.</li>
    <li> This stuff is wonderful. Has great hold without looking like concrete in your hair. I&#x27;d never had a....bucket of gel before. It gives you plenty of freedom to really choose how much you want and the ability to put stuff back that you don&#x27;t use. It doesn&#x27;t get 5 stars because it isn&#x27;t very travel friendly. I still keep a travel bottle of the other stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By the way, I have a pretty simple halr style&amp;#34; short with a part down the side.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are okay buying another product for travel, or simply don&#x27;t travel, this is a great product.</li>
    <li> Great price on a great gel. I love the smell.</li>
    <li> I like this styling gel from Clubman because it does a good job of taming my hair. My hair sticks out on the sides and this gel helps keep it from sticking out and looking like I rolled out of bed. It also helps with hat head. Also I&#x27;ve noticed that it helps condition my hair a bit (which is advertised on the package).</li>
    <li> This is n amazingly simple and inexpensive product that smells great, and works.  Apply just a little to areas that need control, and you&#x27;re set.  Also....this has to be the same gel that barbers use, as it smells exactly the same.</li>
    <li> Never got to try the product. It arrived opened in the package and all over the inside of the box. Really bad</li>
    <li> No flaking, great hold, smells great. What more could you want?</li>
</ol>
