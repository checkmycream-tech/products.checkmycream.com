<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> was very surprised with the quality of this brush&lt;br /&gt;- first of all it is a beautiful brush, it looks so pretty in my brush holder&lt;br /&gt;- the design of the brush is perfect, I was absolutely impressed when I took it out of it&#x27;s box&lt;br /&gt;- sooo soft, who doesn&#x27;t like a soft brush&lt;br /&gt;- I have been due for a new kabuki but didn&#x27;t have the money to afford another 35 brush and this one is perfect&lt;br /&gt;- I use bare minerals and this brush gives me great coverage just like my old brush from them&lt;br /&gt;- very pleased with this product, highly recommended for anyone on a budget since you get the same quality for half the price!&lt;br /&gt;received discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased opinion</li>
    <li> Nice makeup brush, looks fancy anf it is very soft.</li>
    <li> Great Kabuki brush for dabbing on your foundation!  I absolutely love it!</li>
    <li> This is by far my most favorite kabuki brushes as yet. Its bristles are so soft and easy to apply. Its very gentle on the skin and ts coverage is great.&lt;br /&gt;I like the while and golden body of the brush.&lt;br /&gt;Kabuki brushes are generally used for even application of foundation or bronzer and due to the flat make of this brush it really works great. It does not eat away the foundation but rather helps in even and smooth application.&lt;br /&gt;The bristles are very very dense and thick but its very soft to touch. Totally recommended.&lt;br /&gt;I was lucky to recieve this under promotion but my opinions are unbiased.</li>
    <li> Great makeup brush with flat surface for maximized surface area coverage.</li>
    <li> I love this foundation brush! It applies my foundations wonderfully and its easy to clean. I have never had a single hair fall out of the brush.</li>
    <li> I am just beginning to realize the value of a good brush when applying makeup and this seems to fit the bill. I usually use a mineral powder makeup and this brush applies the powder perfectly with just enough coverage but not too much. I would definitely recommend this product.  the only reason I did not give it 5 stars is because I have not tried too many and have not used it enough to see how well it cleans up after using it for awhile.</li>
    <li> I love this brush.  Its soft, blends really well, easy to clean, and doesn&#x27;t shed the bristles.  The last 2 kabuki brushes I bought broke at the handle, this one has held up great.</li>
    <li> I received the Kabuki Me brush for review and testing purposes.&lt;br /&gt;This pro flat brush has a long barrel and perfect for applying my mineral powder foundation. I was impressed because the packaging looked so elegant as well as the brush itself. I also noticed this brush did not have a factory smell which was great! I cleaned it with a spray cleaner and the bristles were very soft with the right amount of density to distribute the powder. I really like this brush and it makes a statement as soon as you see it. It totally gets my five star of approval.</li>
    <li> Love love love this brush!  I use it daily to apply my BB cream and it goes on flawless with this brush!!!</li>
    <li> Great brush blends well.  Bristles do not fall out.</li>
    <li> Makeup is one of my favorite things, I mean it just makes me feel so beautiful.  Not because I feel like I need it, I just LOVE trying different looks and techniques.  One of the most important things in applying your makeup and trying all those new techniques is having the right brush.  Brushes can be very expensive, ant I tend to struggle with spending THAT much money on the brushes so I have tried to buy cheaper ones and most do not meet my expectations.  This brush is really good!!! I love how easy it is to apply my makeup, I don’t get that caked on or streaky look.  This brush is very reasonably priced and I definitely recommend it.  I received this product at a deep discount for my honest &amp; unbiased review.  I always test each product before leaving my 100% honest review.</li>
    <li> This make up brush has brought my current powder to a whole other level! It makes my powder full coverage, go on smoothly and evenly! Because of this brush I have fallen in love with my powder all over again.</li>
    <li> This has got to be the softest brush ever. It allows for super easy usage. I was able to apply coverage in several levels with this kabuki brush. It&lt;br /&gt;has become one of my favorite makeup brushes. It is easy to clean and care for. I have used and washed it several times and not lost any bristles from it. This is quite an amazing feat as I am not gentle when cleansing it by a long shot. I would definitely purchase this as well as the other brushes by this company.&lt;br /&gt;*sample provided*</li>
    <li> This is the best brush I&#x27;ve ever used for foundation. I will order this again in the future.</li>
    <li> the brush is so soft and it glides to the skin beautifully, i used it with either liquid or cream and it delivers a beautiful skin like finish.&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this now as my foundation brush and I would always get compliment with my foundation.&lt;br /&gt;It doesnt leave any streaky lines whatsoever, it glides smoothly on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;The bristles are dense yet they are very very soft, they are also a bit longer compared to a usual flat top kabuki.&lt;br /&gt;i have washed it several times already and it never shed any hair.&lt;br /&gt;the handle is long enough for control, and the color make it look like so sophisticated.&lt;br /&gt;it also came with a brush guard, over all 5 stars. love it!</li>
    <li> Wonderful quality and beautifully designed!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only ever used brushes from drugstores before and was excited to finally get such a well made and pretty looking brush. I love the long handle and it applies powder evenly and I use way less now then I did before with the cheaper brushes. I would recommend it.</li>
    <li> i wasn&#x27;t sure i would like this brush, but have used it for a few days now and it&#x27;s great!</li>
    <li> The kabuki brush is awesome. It&#x27;s so soft on my face and evenly puts my bronzer on like I had it professionally done. Love it!</li>
    <li> I love this brush so much! It&#x27;s now my all-time favorite brush. I use Mac Studio Fix pressed powder and they&#x27;ve always told me that it was better to use a brush to apply the powder but I&#x27;ve always preferred the applicator that comes with the powder. Anytime I used a brush the powder would produce a lot of residue and dust and the brush would start to leave chips in the powder, then when I would apply it to my face I would end up with powder all over my chest, basically wasting a lot of the makeup.&lt;br /&gt;Not so with this brush! The brush collects every last drop of loose powder, then when I apply it to my face all of the powder transfers to my face, not my chest.&lt;br /&gt;It is high quality, well made... It comes shipped in very nice packaging, I still use the net that it came in to keep my bristles nice.&lt;br /&gt;You will not be disappointed with this brush!</li>
    <li> This brush is fantastic! It ranks right up there with many of my high end brushes. I have actually been reaching for this one over my regular one. It looks very nice and feels great. The bristles are very soft and the perfect density. I washed this before using and was pleasantly surprised that it didn&#x27;t shed one time! Still after a few uses I haven&#x27;t found any shedding. I use a liquid foundation that I rub on my face and then go over it and buff it in with this brush. My makeup comes out looking flawless with this and also doesn&#x27;t soak up foundation. I am thoroughly impressed with brand and have already recommended it to many of my makeup loving friends. You HAVE to try this brush!!&lt;br /&gt;*Be You, Beautifully sent this complimentary product to me for quality testing. All opinions are my own.</li>
    <li> i have never Hurd of this brand brush  but thing i do buy cheap ones to. but after seen all the positive reviews how could i not try it out. wow was i amazed at the kabuki brush  it is just beautiful brush the handle it self is nice and big and very comfy in your hands and the brush part is what was really amazon how soft it was and not ruff to the face very smooth when you use it. it did not irritate my skin at all very easy to use you can use from powder makeup or liquid and it goes on very smooth. this is a wonderuful make up brush but don&#x27;t just take my work for it try it out and you will love it as much as i do. i did get this at a discount in exchange for my honest unbiased review.</li>
    <li> It is nice and soft and I can finish off my makeup to set it for the day.</li>
    <li> This Professional Flat Top Kabuki Makeup Brush is super easy to use and is really gentle on my skin! The bristles on this makeup brush are soft enough for sensitive skin which I love! I have yet to see any bristles fall out which happens a lot with other lower quality or even other brushes that claim to be high quality brushes. The handle is very easy to grip without having slippage. The brush allows me to get the all over coverage that I always want very easily! This is definitely a must have high quality makeup brush and I would definitely recommend!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**I received a discount on this product for testing and reviewing purposes and this is my honest and unbiased opinion**</li>
    <li> Great coverage. Picks up face powder easily and applies to the face evenly. Great handle. Very pretty brush all together. Awesome addition to any make-up brush collection.</li>
    <li> I am so picky when it comes to brushes.  I am just really weird about textures and how products feel against my skin.  This is my second item from Be You Beautifully and I am just as pleased with this product as I was the set I also received.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When choosing a good brush there are a couple of things to look for:  1) Is there a lot of fall out when you wash or use them 2) Do they pick up and transfer color well? 3) Do they feel nice on your face?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This brush ticks all the boxes.  There was NO fallout when washing, it was super easy to clean.  you can see in the included pics that they picked up the product extremely well as well as transferred to my face with no product wasted.  This brush is also extremely soft against my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There just literally isn&#x27;t one negative thing I have to say about this brush, and I try to look for defects or things that could be a con about a product and I just can&#x27;t find any fault in this brush!  This is definitely a brand that I would recommend to anyone looking for a good set of brushes or brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*  Sample Provided for Testing &amp; Inspection for Review</li>

    <li> One of my best beauty purchases all year. I use this flat top kabuki brush to apply liquid foundation - I have acne-prone skin with small bumps but love a natural, breathable look, so it has always been difficult finding a brush that provides enough coverage to cover my blemishes, yet does not make my face look overly cake-y. This brush does just that: it covers the redness and makes my face look airbrushed, while still allowing the foundation to glide on smoothly and evenly without the cakiness (not a word but you get it!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My biggest criteria when it comes to determining whether a brush is good or not is its softness to coverage ratio. I&#x27;ve found that most brushes do not balance these two things well - they are either very soft but don&#x27;t provide enough coverage, or provide good coverage but are very rough/hard on skin. Be You, Beautifully has the best balance of softness/coverage of any brushes that I have, including my Mac/Estee Lauder/Ulta brushes. Their bristles are incredibly soft, yet dense enough to deposit the perfect amount of product on my face. The handle is very sturdy, and there is no brush fall-out or shedding whatsoever. Another thing that I am nit-picky about since I am honestly not very knowledgeable about makeup is having the type of brush imprinted on the handle. A lot of companies don&#x27;t do this, but Be You, Beautifully always imprints the name of the brush onto the end of its handle, which I truly appreciate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this brush has done wonders for my makeup aesthetically. I am a huge beauty junkie and know the importance of finding makeup brushes that are comparable to high-end brand names, yet still affordable for a student/young professional income. All the brushes I have tried from this company have been amazing, and this kabuki brush was no exception. I received this brush at a discount for the purposes of unbiased testing and reviewing, and will happily purchase another at retail price as soon as this one is done.</li>
