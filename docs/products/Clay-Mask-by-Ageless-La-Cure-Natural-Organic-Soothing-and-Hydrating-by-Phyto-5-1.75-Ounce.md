      <li>My skin felt more smooth after use.  </li>
      <li>I ended up just sorting of winging it, and while that worked, it&#x27;s really not the best model to follow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>This is perhaps the most important part.</li>
      <li>I love a good mud mask but was surprised at this one!</li>
      <li>It also rinses off easily.</li>
      <li>Lightweight, goes on easily, dries in 15 minutes, and washes off thoroughly.&lt;br</li>
      <li>The container has a pump dispenser and the product flows out easily.  </li>
      <li>For starters, it&#x27;s easy to put on.</li>
      <li>/&gt;The mask washes off easily and I felt no residue after it was rinsed off.  </li>
      <li>but nothing too strong and after it is applied</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s perfect for those of us with sensitive skin and thus normally don&#x27;t do well with clay-based masks.</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t have a brush to apply it, but it went on fine using my fingers.</li>
      <li>While I&#x27;m happy to pay upwards of $50 for a nice mud treatment, I usually get more product for that amount.</li>
      <li>I like this easy to apply clay mask with its user friendly pump.  </li>
      <li>Because of it&#x27;s smooth mousse-like consistency</li>
      <li>/&gt;The mask went on smoothly, and my skin immediately started tingling.</li>
      <li>The mask itself was light, there were no perfumes.  </li>
      <li>face was smooth and there was no tingling or drying.  </li>

      <li>It smells like strong candy or some sweet scent</li>
      <li>It has a very fresh smell that feels calming.  </li>
      <li>It dries quickly and  rinses off easily.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t set up quickly, so it glides on easily.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s rare to find a mask-type product that really works for my skin, and I&#x27;m so glad I did!</li>
      <li>The first thing I noticed was the appealing, natural fragrance - a light mix of almond and rose.  </li>
      <li>but it is really super light.  </li>
      <li>I love the mostly natural, organic ingredients and that it was more calming to my skin than I</li>
      <li>Ageless La cure Phyto website: &#x27;Being extremely rich in minerals and sweet almond oil, this clay mask is nourishing and revitalizing.  </li>
      <li>But I experienced absolutely no redness, pain or burning during use.</li>
      <li>There&#x27;s a hint of the almond, but mostly it smells &amp;#34;natural,&amp;#34; or of very little.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Clay masks tend to wreak havoc on dryer skin, so I really wasn&#x27;t sure about this.</li>
      <li>and I really wonder how many uses I will get out of it.</li>
      <li>I used not quite two full pumps.</li>
      <li>I will update this to see after time if it has diminished fine lines and leaves skin brighter, but I can say after one time I am pleased with the way it leaves my skin feeling soft and renewed.</li>
      <li>Cost aside, I think this would be a good mask for anyone with skin that is more dry than oily and who therefore wishes to avoid using masks that are very drying.</li>
      <li>Seems to be good for sensitive skin and is very soothing and hydrating.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t think anything is actually going to stop my face from aging, but if it can look better along the way, I&#x27;m okay with that.</li>
      <li>I can see myself using this once a week to super refresh my face.</li>

      <li>I am a beauty product junkie and absolutely love to try new products that will become a permanent part of my morning or nightly regimen.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;The ingredients are clay (Kaolin), Rose Essential Oil, Organic Sweet Almond Oil, Organic Aloe Vera, Calendula Extract, Organic Verbena Flower Water, Glycerin, Vitamin E and more.&lt;br</li>
      <li>There&#x27;s a pretty good amount in the bottle so you will get multiple uses out of it.</li>
      <li>It also seems to calm my rosecea.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This mask pumps out of the bottle which I like helps with not making everything all messy.  I also like the nice light almost florally fragrance but it is really super light.  The mask tingles when it is on, but unlike other masks I have tried it doesn&#x27;t make my face feel like I am in stone and being pulled. Very nice.  The mask made my face red after use but it faded in like 15 minutes.  Smooth skin was the result very soft. I highly recommend this one</li>
    <li> I do like this mask, my only complaint is it didn&#x27;t come in a box and there are no directions on the bottle so I had to look up the directions on the amazon product page. On the product page it basically just says to apply mask with a brush and let sit for 15 minutes and rinse.  I didn&#x27;t have a brush to apply it, but it went on fine using my fingers. I did have to prime the pump approx. 17 times before I got anything out of it. The consistency is like a thick and creamy similar to foundation. It feels cold while applying, but comfortable. It has a slight rose scent when applying it but nothing too strong and after it is applied I didn&#x27;t really even notice it anymore. I read some people said it didn&#x27;t dry. I didn&#x27;t have that problem, after 15 minutes it was thoroughly dried and ready to rinse. After thoroughly rinsing it leaves your skin feeling so soft and moisturized yet it still feels like there is a little bit of a clean tight feeling. I used not quite two full pumps. I will update this to see after time if it has diminished fine lines and leaves skin brighter, but I can say after one time I am pleased with the way it leaves my skin feeling soft and renewed. I also like the fact that it is a certified organic product.</li>
    <li> As an older woman my skin is more on the dry side.  I really didn&#x27;t notice much difference using this product, but it might be more useful for someone with oily skin.</li>
    <li> This is easy to apply and a great product for a woman. I recommend this, would buy, and I hope this helps someone.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used many brands of clay masks over the years, but the Phyto 5 Ageles Clay Mask is different from them all. It goes on very smooth and creamy similar to a thick, whipped mousse rather than a gloppy clay. It dries to a light red, velvety, smooth finish, not a hard, cracked mask. My overall stance so far as to whether or not I will buy more once this container is empty is tentative. Yes, my face is becoming very soft and smooth with smaller pores right from the start, which I like very much. I also really like the consistency of this mask, but I&#x27;ve yet to see any improvement in fine wrinkles or color correction - and that&#x27;s what using this mask is really about, right? Will I get the results it promises? I&#x27;m leaning toward continuing with this product because the results they claim do take time, but there are a few other issues to consider. I&#x27;ve broken down my experience into pros and cons in no specific order of importance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;1. Lightweight, goes on easily, dries in 15 minutes, and washes off thoroughly.&lt;br /&gt;2. A little goes a long way. Only need a thin layer to accomplish results.&lt;br /&gt;3. Does not dry into a hard, cracking &amp;#34;cement&amp;#34; that tugs on skin or dries out face.&lt;br /&gt;4. Skin is left velvety soft and smooth with tighter pores.&lt;br /&gt;5. No itchiness, redness or blotches on my sensative skin afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;6. Pump dispenser eliminates messy application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;1. The scent. I find it slighy unpleasant. It reminds me vaguely of Play Do.&lt;br /&gt;2. The sting. In under a minute of application my face begins to sting. It is similar to the slight burn of glycolic acid facial products. It lessens during the 15 minutes, and there is no residual redness afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;3. The slight &amp;#34;rawness&amp;#34; for a few hours afterwards. It is minimal. I do not apply any lotion after removing the mask. Again, this may be a glycolic effect.&lt;br /&gt;4. The packaging. It is impossible to tell how much product is left, except that the container gets lighter with each use.&lt;br /&gt;5. It took 21 pumps the first time to extract the mask. Not a problem if you are aware of this. Otherwise it will appear the container is defective.&lt;br /&gt;6. Lack of instructions. There are none on or with the container. Zero. Just a list of ingredients. This cost one star. Newbies to clay masks will be lost.&lt;br /&gt;7. The unknown. How many more applications will I get from this rather expensive tiny bottle? Will it remain creamy to the very end or will I have to toss the last of it? Considering the price, I think these are relevant questions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the end, I am pretty pleased with this mask so far. I&#x27;m willing to give it a few months to see if it delivers on its promises for me, because everyone is unique - our skin, it&#x27;s condition, and how it reacts to different products vary. The problems as I see them for the most part are in marketing and not the product itself. If organic ingredients matter to you, the label states that while 99.8% of total ingredients are of &amp;#34;natural origin,&amp;#34; only 23.4% are organic. The decision is your.ner gets lighter with each use.&lt;br /&gt;5. It took 21 pumps the first time to extract the mask. Not a problem if you are aware of this.

    <li> First and foremost, I would not pay the nearly $50 price tag for this product.  After applying to my face and waiting what seemed like an eternity for it to dry, I was left with a sense of clean over my face yes...but for $50 bucks, I was hoping for much more than that.  The scent is nice and not to perfume based...easily wearable from a mans point of view.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does not feel like there is much in this bottle and I really wonder how many uses I will get out of it.</li>
    <li> This face mask came without instructions or warnings.  Ingredient list is in English and French.  I put some one my face and left it until it dried.  It took a long time to dry, and did not dry stiff and crackly like other facial clay masks I have tried.  The color is rust orange.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My face was smooth and there was no tingling or drying.  In fact, I was not sure what the purpose of this mask is, since unlike others, it did not dry out the oily parts of my face.  It rinsed off with water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Loses stars for a lack of instructions and MOST IMPORTANTLY, it left red blotches on my face where it had touched.  They went away and I had no reaction or rash, but wow, I would not want to walk out of the house with those bright red patches on my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have very fair skin.  Might not be that way on darker skin.</li>
    <li> No instructions were included with this mask so I looked up the manufacturers website and found the following directions: Apply to face and/or body after cleansing and toning. Leave on for 15 minutes, then rinse well, and apply a skin toner.&lt;br /&gt;This mask is in a pump bottle that is much nicer than the last clay mask I used.  It took maybe 3 or 4 pumps of this lightweight lotion to cover my face, neck and decolletage.  It has a very fresh smell that feels calming.  Definitely made this feel like a spa experience.  I felt a slight tingle as this was drying, but nothing unpleasant.  I left it on for about 30 minutes, then rinsed it away very easily.  My skin felt moisturized and refreshed.&lt;br /&gt;I look forward to trying more products from this company in the future.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From Ageless La cure Phyto website: &#x27;Being extremely rich in minerals and sweet almond oil, this clay mask is nourishing and revitalizing.  The clay cleanses, mineralizes and purifies the skin. In addition, this mask is highly moisturizing and soothing thanks to its concentration in aloe, calendula and verbena flower water. It also has revitalizing, healing and anti-wrinkle properties due to the precious rose essential oil that acts directly on collagen production.&#x27;</li>
    <li> My wife wanted to try this is a red clay mask (I don&#x27;t know why but she expected it to be white).  Per the wife, it feels like a thin creamy mud.  It does not dry and become hard while on the face if you leave it on for the recommended amount of time (15 minutes).  The instructions recommend cleaning the face, applying the mask, and then leaving on for 15 minutes.  After 15 minutes, rinse and use toner.  Her skin felt soft after using the mask (not dry like some masks).&lt;br /&gt;I did some research into the company that makes this product, as I was not familiar with Phyto 5.  The Phyto 5 products are made at a&lt;br /&gt;factory in the Swiss mountains.  This is a certified organic products (called “BIO” in Europe).&lt;br /&gt;Interestingly, the root of the PHYTO 5 logo is the Taoist symbol of yin and yang. In the middle of the logo there is a the White Dragon, a symbol of purity in Chinese mythology.&lt;br /&gt;The ingredients are: Aqua (water), kaolin (clay), Lippia citriodora (Verbena flower water), octyldodecanol, cetearyl alcohol, glycerin (vegetal), aloe barbadensis, Calendula officinalis extract, cetearyl wheat straw glycoside, Prunus amygdalus dulcis (sweet almond oil), benzyl alcohol, parfum (natural origin fragrance), limonene, CI 77491 (iron oxide), citral, tocopherol (vitamin E), dehydroacetic acid, sodium hydroxide, geraniol, citronello.&lt;br /&gt;The label indicates that 98.8% of the total ingrediants are from a natural origin. The key ingredients are: Kaolin, aloe, calendula extracts, sweet almond oil, with rose, orange, tangerine, geranium and sandalwood essential oils, Verbena flower water, vitamin E.&lt;br /&gt;My wife really liked the mask and would recommend it.</li>
    <li> There are a few big reasons to like this mask. For starters, it&#x27;s easy to put on. You don&#x27;t need to use tons of it each time. It also rinses off easily. That might be the nicest part.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also smells nice. This is perhaps the most important part. It&#x27;d be hard to stand having this on your face if it smelled bad, which many of them do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as results, I&#x27;ve been impressed. The mask itself feels like more of a moisturizer than many and that&#x27;s a good thing. My face seems to like it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a good product for a good price. Many masks are too expensive. Do yourself a favor and pick up this product.</li>
    <li> I like this mask, but I&#x27;m not certain that it&#x27;s life-changing. It goes on smoothly, and I like how you can pump out only a little bit at a time. I can use the same product over and over without having to worry about it drying out. It dries quickly and  rinses off easily. It does not have a firming feel to it when I rinse it off; if anything my face feels mushy immediately after treatment. I think this is a matter of personal preference, because I sort of like to have that sense of firming when I take off a mask. However, I  think the goals of this product are a little different, and as far as detoxifying and purifying, I think it&#x27;s doing what it sets out to do. I don&#x27;t think anything is actually going to stop my face from aging, but if it can look better along the way, I&#x27;m okay with that.</li>
    <li> The words “clay mask” evoke memories of thick concoctions that dried like a crackle finish on my face and had to be scrubbed off with a washcloth.  When I was young and had oily skin I liked the drying effect of that type of mask, but a product like that would be too harsh for my complexion these days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is nothing like ye olde clay mask of my teens/twenties.  This has the texture of foundation or moisturizer and there’s no “pulling” sensation when it dries on your skin.  It rinses off very easily by just splashing your face with tepid water.  It has a mild “earthy” type of scent that I don’t find unpleasant (it’s preferable to perfume!) and is a pinky-brown color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found it odd that this product came with no instructions and none are printed on the container itself.  I tried locating it on the Phyto 5 website but didn’t have any luck.  According to the product page on Amazon you’re supposed to apply it to your face with a brush and rinse off after 15 minutes, then follow with a toner.  I’ve used it several times and it leaves my skin feeling soft with no dryness, redness or irritation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So what is this product supposed to do for your skin?  According to the product page here on Amazon, it “…helps correct six of the most common visible signs of aging: dark spots, dryness, dullness, visible pores, rough texture, and fine lines and wrinkles”.  I’m no chemist, but I know my way around cosmetics and skin care products and I don’t really see anything in this product’s ingredients that’s going to have any appreciable “anti-aging” effect on your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom Line:  I have nothing negative to say about this mask, I didn’t have any unwanted side effects from using it but neither did I see any difference in my complexion.  I don’t see it as a skin care essential, but if you like masks and you’re not on a tight beauty budget you might want to give it a try.  This is not a product that I personally would purchase again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Certified Organic&lt;br /&gt;*98.8% of the ingredients are of natural origin&lt;br /&gt;*23.4% of the total ingredients are from Organic Farmingain.  *Certified Organic *98.8% of the ingredients are of natural origin *23.4% of the total ingredients are from Organic Farming</li>
    <li> I love a good mud mask but was surprised at this one! Usually when they dry, you can move your mouth and crack your whole face. After rinsing you get a really tight &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34; feeling aka your face is super dry. This was completely different! The Phyto clay mask goes on like silk, with a thinner consistency than a typical mud mask. It really just glides onto your skin and has a faint hint of almond oil. Putting it on feels luxurious. I sat down for 15 minutes or so and didn&#x27;t even really notice when it had dried because my face didn&#x27;t feel stuck in one caked on clay position like usual. After rinsing it off my skin felt soft and hydrated. Definitely an impressive mud mask. I love the mostly natural, organic ingredients and that it was more calming to my skin than I expected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; The only thing I don&#x27;t love is the price. While I&#x27;m happy to pay upwards of $50 for a nice mud treatment, I usually get more product for that amount. My favorite used to be the DDF sulfur mask which was in a tub of maybe 6 oz. This is under 2 oz. and while I appreciated the air tight distribution(no sticking your hands over and over into an open jar and contaminating it), I still probably couldn&#x27;t justify the price.</li>
    <li> This is a moisturizing clay mask which uses many organic ingredients.  The container has a pump dispenser and the product flows out easily.  Although it&#x27;s more fluid than other clay masks I have used, it&#x27;s firm enough to stay on your face without drips.  What I liked:  the scent; almond and rose - very light and pleasing:  dried quickly - 15 min, and did not dry into a hard cacky mass; easy to remove.  I did think that it left my skin lighter and smoother, for the day at least.  I very much liked the product, but like many others, doubt I would purchase it for $50.  I mean come on, $50 for a bit of kaolin clay and some oils?  a bit much for me.  But, a very nice product.</li>
    <li> So...this is called an Ageless Mask but I don&#x27;t know that it claims to address wrinkles or any others signs of aging.  The benefit I did notice after using this mask is that my skin was very soft. I liked that the mask didn&#x27;t make my skin feel tight as it dried and it was never uncomfortable. The product comes out of a pump, which may be a problem when the product is almost gone. Another reviewer went on and on about the smell being unpleasant but I didn&#x27;t find it unpleasant at all.</li>
    <li> PHYTO 5 skincare products are made from natural ingredients in a lab in the Swiss mountains; Phytobiodermie is a Swiss company. The ingredients in this expensive mask are certified organic. Certified organic products are called &amp;#34;BIO&amp;#34; in Europe, and a BIO logo appears on certified organic products. The BIO logo appears on the lower front right of this container, as you can see in Amazon&#x27;s photos as well as in mine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The mask itself is unlike any I&#x27;ve tried before, and I&#x27;ve tried many since the late 70&#x27;s when I sold Queen Helene Mint Julep Masque in natural food co-ops I managed, which led me to discover that occasional use of such a mask could be of benefit to my oily skin. After some time on my face, masks such as the original Queen Helene dries and begins to flake, unlike this PHYTO 5 mask, which has stayed moist and slightly sticky even after I&#x27;ve left some on my forehead for as long as an hour. In my experience, this mask is less drying than some others I&#x27;ve used, and given that my skin is oily, I prefer the more drying masks. (I don&#x27;t like peel off type masks at all; I only like clay or mud type masks.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This mask has a pleasant smell and is easy to apply, though I wish it were easier to get out of the container. I took two quick snapshots of the container, one with the cap removed, and one with a pencil near the container to give you a sense of the size of this 1 3/4 ounce container.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The container is small and light in weight (I decided to weigh it after removing a fingertip size amount of the mask from the container, and the weight of the nearly full container with the cap on was 2.82 oz.). One presumably gets a very high quality product for their money, but relatively little quantity when compared to other clay masks. (E.g., I currently have a 6 oz. jar of Dead Sea Mud Mask and a 12 oz. jar of Queen Helene Original Mud Pack Masque, the main ingredient of which is English Clay, both of which cost less than the clay mask under review. Are they as high in quality? Probably not. The dead sea mud mask label lists mostly organic ingredients, the QH does not list any organic ingredients.) I  don&#x27;t know how many treatments one can get from the amount of clay mask in this PHYTO 5 container, but it&#x27;s obvious to me it will be far, far fewer than the number one can get from larger quantities of clay mask.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cost aside, I think this would be a good mask for anyone with skin that is more dry than oily and who therefore wishes to avoid using masks that are very drying. I would not recommend it to anyone who wants a serious pore cleansing mask, not because this mask won&#x27;t cleanse pores, but because - at least based on my experience - it doesn&#x27;t seem to have the kind of &amp;#34;pull&amp;#34; that some other clay/mud type masks have (e.g., in the sense of being able to &amp;#34;pull out blackheads&amp;#34;).in quality? Probably not. The dead sea mud mask label lists mostly organic ingredients, the QH does not list any organic ingredients.) I  don&#x27;t know how many treatments one can get from the amount of clay mask in this PHYTO 5 container, but it&#x27;s obvious to me it will be far, far fewer than the number one can get from larger quantities of clay mask.

    <li> A little bit goes a long way! Which is good, because it&#x27;s expensive.&lt;br /&gt;The smell - definitely dominated by the rose oil, but only barely. There&#x27;s a hint of the almond, but mostly it smells &amp;#34;natural,&amp;#34; or of very little.&lt;br /&gt;The grit for the clay is very fine, like fine popcorn salt or sea salt.&lt;br /&gt;As a test, because I have sensitive skin, I did a spot on the back of my hand first. Not only could I feel the difference between the treated and untreated part of my skin, I could feel it. The treated area felt softer and smoother and looked better hydrated/less textured. So that was kind of cool.&lt;br /&gt;When I used it on my face I saw similar results - soft, smooth, glowing skin.&lt;br /&gt;However, I&#x27;ve used it over the past month and noticed no better lasting effects than I&#x27;ve gotten from less expensive, similarly pure &amp; natural products. So while I like the product, I don&#x27;t anticipate purchasing it over a less expensive alternative.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a fan of beauty masks, so I was eager to give he Phyto 5 clay mask a try. One initial irritating note: There are no instructions on the bottle, so I had to come to Amazon to check how to use it/how long to keep it on/etc. Once I found that out, I was good to go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The mask went on smoothly, and my skin immediately started tingling. I could tell something was happening. The instructions said to leave it on for 15 minutes, by which point the mask had dried. I washed it off and was left with smooth, soft skin. It&#x27;s a high quality mask with natural ingredients, and you get that feeling and quality while using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only hesitation is the price; you don&#x27;t get a lot of product, especially considering the instructions are to use it once or twice a week for three months. I doubt one bottle of this would last that long.</li>
    <li> Have used this several times now.  My skin feels great afterwards - nice and smooth.  It also seems to calm my rosecea.</li>
    <li> This clay mask is certainly unlike any I&#x27;ve used. I like that it pumps out, though it took several pumps to prime it. This appears to be a new packaging design for this line. I&#x27;m curious to see how it functions over time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The clay is creamy and soft. It doesn&#x27;t set up quickly, so it glides on easily. The fragrance is light, and the clay goes on a dark orange in color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As it dries, it tingles a bit. I&#x27;m always cautious about that point of any mask, concerned whether it indicates irritation or just settling in. This one dried evenly and without making my skin feel pulled or tight. I actually forgot I had it on, as once it dried, the tingling stopped. That&#x27;s a good sign.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I left it on for a few minutes, and upon washing it off, it left a light moist residue on my skin. We&#x27;ll see if that becomes problematic with use, though it felt like a nice moisturizer. My skin was smooth and soft. No tingling &#x3D;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My concerns around this mask are that it comes with no instructions for use. Masks are somewhat intuitive, though it&#x27;s nice to have affirmation that I&#x27;m using a product as intended. Also, it contains wheat, which is a flag for me. I have to be very careful with it. Thus far, no problems. I&#x27;m dubious of vague ingredients like &amp;#34;natural origin fragrance,&amp;#34; which this contains. I like to know exactly what&#x27;s in products, and &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; can mean a lot of unpleasant things. The product description does include the exact list of ingredients, so it&#x27;s worth reading to see if any of the natural ingredients may pose a problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Along that line, it contains no parabens, which is awesome. I recommend trying this mask for a good moisturizing treat.</li>
    <li> I put the mask on and sit back to relax, like I always do with most masks.  After I washed it off, my skin looked like I actually went to a spa for a facial.  The mask itself was light, there were no perfumes.  With other masks I&#x27;ve tried, my skin can react negatively, like reness or tingling.  With Ageless, my face actually felt cool and relaxed.  Then a week later, I did it again.  THis time, same results.  I&#x27;ve been using Ageless for a few years for their hydrating cream, the wash and once a year I do the treatment serum, so I had high hopes.  Definitely delivered on my expectations!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Truly love this product.</li>
    <li> After one use of the Phyto 5 Ageless Clay Mask, my face felt very soft and smooth, as if it were vigorously exfoliated and moisturized.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I applied the product to my face &amp; neck.  It comes in a pump style container and a little goes a long way.  It has the texture and feel of a heavy foundation makeup. It does not turn stiff on your skin.  I felt no tingling at all during the 15 minutes I had the clay on my face.  I did not care for the overpowering odor, however.  It smells like strong candy or some sweet scent I cannot place.  Very artificial smelling to me. I would prefer an odorless mask.  So I subtracted a star.  I really do not care for the odor one bit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The mask washes off easily and I felt no residue after it was rinsed off.  I did go ahead and apply my regular moisturizer, and did not have a greasy feel on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My face and neck, where I applied the product, feels very soft and smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the product but again, do not care for the smell.  I also don&#x27;t think this bottle will last more than a few applications, so if cost is a factor, that&#x27;s a deterrent also.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise my skin feels great!</li>
    <li> As clay masks go this is a decent one as it has clay as the main ingredient and is almost 99% natural.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ingredients are clay (Kaolin), Rose Essential Oil, Organic Sweet Almond Oil, Organic Aloe Vera, Calendula Extract, Organic Verbena Flower Water, Glycerin, Vitamin E and more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has a nice fragrance and felt soothing and refreshing and not drying like some clay masks problem probably due to the essential oils, aloe and glycerin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Clay masks are good for the skin, I apply the after cleansing skin with warm water and after washing off clay mask with warm water rub an icecube in my face to close the pores and then apply moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;Recommended.</li>
    <li> This comes in an easy to use dispenser, and the mask is very smooth and creamy.  Unlike some clay masks it goes on smoothly - in a very light shade of tan - and feels very moisturizing compared to many other masks.  The aroma is also pleasant.</li>
    <li> I like this easy to apply clay mask with its user friendly pump.  The mask itself is definitely more moisturizing than drying.  It doesn&#x27;t make your face feel dry and crackly even after 15 minutes.  My skin felt more smooth after use.  The bottle states that 98.8% of its ingredients are from natural origin of which 23.4% of total ingredients are from Organic Farming.  Product of Switzerland.</li>
    <li> Moisturizing mask that has a light formula that blends and absorbs right into the skin rather than some of your typical thick clay masks. Has a nozzle/pump to give you just the right amount or to use as much as you need. There&#x27;s a pretty good amount in the bottle so you will get multiple uses out of it. Contains Kaolin Clay, Flower Water, Glycerin, Almond, Alcohol, Vitamin E and Aloe. Seems to be good for sensitive skin and is very soothing and hydrating. Helps with aging, dryness, pores and wrinkles. 98.8 of the ingredients are from natural origins. 23.4 of the total ingredients are from organic farming. Certified Organic, Product is made in Switzerland. Would recommend if you&#x27;re looking for a mask that won&#x27;t weigh your skin down.</li>
    <li> This mineral-rich kaolin clay mask is formulated to purify, moisturize, and nourish, and it does just that. It&#x27;s perfect for those of us with sensitive skin and thus normally don&#x27;t do well with clay-based masks. The formula is quite gentle, yet isn&#x27;t one of those creamy masks that just sits on your skin...the kaolin still draws out impurities well. I also has anti-inflammatory ingredients, which are probably what keeps it from stinging or making your skin feel tight (my experience with other clay masks, some of very reputable brands).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m guessing this will be coming with a box when it becomes available in the U.S. (Phyto 5 is a Swiss company and apparently distributes in salons), but for those complaining about missing instructions and ingredients, here they are from Phyto 5&#x27;s websites: Apply to face and/or body after cleansing and toning. Leave on for 15 minutes, then rinse well and apply a skin toner. (I wouldn&#x27;t recommend using this on your body unless you&#x27;re an oil baron, though, as you&#x27;d have to use the entire contents!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The majority of the ingredients are plant-based and most of these are organic, such as: aloe, calendula, sweet almond oil, verbena flower water, vitamin E, plus a blend of rose, orange, tangerine, geranium and sandalwood essential oils purportedly balanced/inspired by the 5 elements of traditional Chinese medicine. There are other typical ingredients like cetearyl alcohol and sodium hydroxide.</li>
    <li> Very nice cleansing mask made with organic ingredients. My skin is super sensitive so I would know pretty much right away if the product was harsh and all I felt was a slight tingling feeling and coolness on my skin. The container does not come with directions written on the &amp;#34;bottle&amp;#34; so I went with allowing it to dry and leaving it on for about 10 minutes. Rinsing off was fairly easy and my skin felt tight and refreshed. I do not use a toner so I followed with a moisturizer. I can see myself using this once a week to super refresh my face. I did specifically like the pump dispenser instead of the usual tube or jar.There really was no mess dispensing what I needed and no messy cleanup afterwards.</li>
    <li> I am a beauty product junkie and absolutely love to try new products that will become a permanent part of my morning or nightly regimen.  This Ageless Clay Mask by Phyto 5 is unlike any other clay mask I&#x27;ve tried in the past.  It pumps out and has the consistency of mousse.  It&#x27;s a red clay mask and I chose to apply it like I do all of my face masks, with a face brush.  Because of it&#x27;s smooth mousse-like consistency, I didn&#x27;t need much to cover my entire face and neck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this mask while taking a bath and leave it on for twenty minutes.  This was approximately the time it took to completely dry.  While on my face waiting to dry, It never felt tight, it didn&#x27;t tingle or burn my skin, and washed off easily.  I could see the results when I got out of the tub.  My pores were non-existent and my skin was soft and smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this mask for the past two weeks and I really love it.  My skin looks bright and even.  I do follow the instructions and I follow the mask (like I do any of my cleaning products) with toner and a moisturizer.  The Ageless Mask by Phyto 5 is gentle and totally relaxing.  I feel like I&#x27;m doing something for me every time I use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Ageless Mask is made of natural ingredients that are wonderful for your skin.  It&#x27;s of outstanding quality and I would highly recommend it to anyone with sensitive skin, doesn&#x27;t like the heaviness/tightening of a regular mask, or if you simply want to pamper yourself.  I can&#x27;t say enough about just how wonderful this product is!  I think I&#x27;ve found the perfect mask!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve probably tried nearly every facial mask on the market.  While my preference runs to thick clay masks (like Borghese&#x27;s amazing Fango), I also enjoy the occasional moisturizing mask, like Lush&#x27;s Sacred Truth or Meaningful Beauty.  What I don&#x27;t particularly enjoy is a mask that doesn&#x27;t dry thoroughly. Because it seems as if I&#x27;m just putting lotion on my face for fifteen minutes before rinsing it off.  I like to feel the mask working somehow, not just sitting there.  Unfortunately, moisturizing masks or those targeted for &amp;#34;mature&amp;#34; skin tend to fall into the non-drying category.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With that in mind, I was skeptical as I smoothed the Phyto 5 Ageless Clay Mask over my face.  The first thing I noticed was the appealing, natural fragrance - a light mix of almond and rose.  It went on creamy (similar to the Meaningful Beauty product), looking a bit like thick, wet Calamine lotion and, much to my surprise and delight, after about twenty minutes it had completely dried to a dark brick red.  It was easy to rinse and left my face smooth and supple, not in the least tight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In addition, it&#x27;s made from mostly natural botanical ingredients.  Definitely a high quality product that made me feel pampered.</li>
    <li> I have extremely dry, sensitive skin. And as I get older (I&#x27;m in my early 40&#x27;s now), it has become much more temperamental. Things that I used to use will now randomly cause burning or redness, and I have to be very careful what products I use.  And I have found that most facial skincare that says &amp;#34;good for all skin types&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;for use on sensitive skin&amp;#34; is full of baloney. So having said that, I frankly decided to try this product for the simple reason that, by testing it myself, I could help others with the same skin issues avoid yet another product that proved to be more harmful than helpful. Well...the jokes on me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, I have to note this - the reason I did not give this product 5 stars is that there are absolutely NO instructions. How much to use? How long to keep on? Best way to take off? I ended up just sorting of winging it, and while that worked, it&#x27;s really not the best model to follow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the product itself? Surprisingly, I love it. Clay masks tend to wreak havoc on dryer skin, so I really wasn&#x27;t sure about this. But I experienced absolutely no redness, pain or burning during use. My skin felt soft instead of tight and dry after I had taken it off, and it continued to feel that way for several hours. No signs of dry, flaky patches. It went on almost like a red-tinted moisturizer, and dried up a bit on my face. I left in on for 3 minutes (Again-winging it. Didn&#x27;t want to leave it on too long and risk damage, or too short and have it be wasted.), then rinsed it off with lukewarm water. I supposed I could have used a damp washcloth, but again - super sensitive skin. Without knowing how my face was going to react, I didn&#x27;t want any more abrasiveness than I could help. There *was* a small bit of tingling while the mask was on, but it felt more...refreshing...than painful in any way. It rinsed off very easily, and then I patted my face dry and applied my regular moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the pump, just for germy issues, though I think getting all the mask out could be a problem as it gets down towards the bottom. Again, with no instructions, I took a guess on how much to use and did 2 pumps. With my skin type, I would probably not use this more than once a week, though others could probably use it more often if they wanted. I have no idea what the recommended usage is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I am absolutely surprised by how much I like this. It&#x27;s rare to find a mask-type product that really works for my skin, and I&#x27;m so glad I did!issues, though I think getting all the mask out could be a problem as it gets down towards the bottom.
