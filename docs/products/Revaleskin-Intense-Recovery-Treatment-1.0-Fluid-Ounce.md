      <li>my skin feels better-</li>
      <li>I love this product.</li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t blend well with the sunscreen that I love.  </li>
      <li>Love Love Love...</li>
      <li>The Coffeeberry extract soothed and healed my face in a matter of weeks and now my skin looks better than it has in years.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I am pleased with the company and pleased to be able to find such great deals on Amazon</li>
      <li>so I could focus on more important things with my kids rather than returning items.</li>
      <li>It runs out fast and it is a bit costly, but I do love the product!</li>
      <li>So far my rosacea prone skin has been perfect and very clear.</li>
      <li>Didn&#x27;t see huge difference in skin though..</li>
      <li>This product oxidizes as it ages, changing in color from a light tan to brown.</li>
      <li>I really enjoy using this product.</li>
      <li>Cream is light and not oily,  so I can use before make up as well.  </li>
      <li>I need tiny amount and it keeps hydrate my face over the night, it gets solves skin very well, smells delicious.  </li>
      <li>He was right!</li>
      <li>I returned it and Amazon gave me a full refund.  </li>
      <li>but it feel really nice on my skin and keep my face feeling soft and not oily.  </li>
      <li>I got this sun spot on my face (tiny but noticeable because I have fair skin) and I wanted something to take it away.</li>
      <li>Skin feels clean and fresh after using it.</li>
      <li>It is a great product for dry sensitive skin, my skin has never looked better, I really do like this product!</li>
      <li>Pricey but worth it.</li>
      <li>but of course that could also be because i never received a full bottle in the first place.</li>
      <li>I guess when the price is too good to be true it is indeed not true.</li>
      <li>i ordered this product before i was out of product on hand at home, precisely so i wouldn&#x27;t run out and have to wait for a new shipment.</li>
      <li>Overall, it is a great facial cream.</li>
      <li>It was recommended by a dermatologist, but I find several dermatologists who have never heard of it.&lt;br /&gt;I find that my skin feels better when I place the extract on my face before retiring for the evening.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>Sometimes smells funny.  </li>
      <li>Most days the only makeup I wear is mascara.</li>
      <li>As far for my serum/treatment I will surely keep this new treasure.</li>
      <li>I love to try new beauty products, but I also don&#x27;t like to have 6 serums or 4 nightcreams for the same thing...</li>
      <li>The price is reasonable as its performance.</li>
      <li>However, I have not noticed that it makes much difference to my skin.</li>
      <li>Treatment helped remove pink spots after my scars healed, and It seems I won&#x27;t need to purchase more.</li>
      <li>Been using this product for a month and haven&#x27;t noticed much benefit.  </li>
      <li>i look forward to my nighttime routine as this really feels nourishing.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I have a fabulous dermatologist who suggested this product--for daytime use only.</li>
      <li>(I dont use it during the day because I notice it can leave a tiny residual (the color of the serum is light brownish/green)</li>
      <li>much more reasonably priced than on other sites.</li>
      <li>and I mostly combine it with some other products</li>
      <li>The clean smell of coffee only enhances this product.</li>
      <li>and this is unusual for me for someone with older skin.</li>
      <li>Leaves a dark residue after many hours of wear.</li>
      <li>It has a bit of a different (not bad, just not ordinary) sent and</li>
      <li>once i ran out, i opened my new box.</li>
      <li>I have ordered numerous items from Amazon and this will be the first return.</li>
      <li>She loves it and asked me to get her a new one as far as she noticed she is running out of it.</li>
      <li>Aging, sensitive skin seems improved with this product.  </li>
      <li>I have seen marked improvement in my skin.</li>
      <li>I will use this below the neck only, as I don&#x27;t throw away products I have paid so much for, but I will never repurchase.</li>
      <li>and I love the smell when others have complained about it.</li>

    <li> It&#x27;s OK, won&#x27;t buy again.</li>
    <li> I have ordered numerous items from Amazon and this will be the first return. AFL Fullfillment has a good track record so I&#x27;m not sure what happened. The box and container of cream were both damaged and not sealed. The pump on the small container/bottle was also not working and I could not get a single drop of cream and both my husband and I tried. I understand that this happens and it may have just been defective, but because the box and container were not sealed, I think this was very poor service on the sellers end. There was not a single piece of paper/receipt indicating what I had ordered, which I thought was kind of weird. Frustrating to have go out of my way to find a UPS Store to return something that somebody carelessly threw in an envelope and sealed. I have small children and doing errands such as this could have been avoided if someone took an extra 5 minutes to do their job. I signed up for Amazon Prime so I could focus on more important things with my kids rather than returning items.</li>
    <li> Excellent cream recommended by my Dermatologist, absorbed by the skin with no trace of oil, I love it.</li>
    <li> been using this for years and probably will continue until i find something much better</li>
    <li> Best product I have ever tried for Rhodesia. Reduces redness 90%.</li>
    <li> Great product!! Been using it for years and always get compliments on my skin and asked what I use.</li>
    <li> This product is great. It has a bit of a different (not bad, just not ordinary) sent and it is a bit tacky for a few minutes after application, but overall I really like it.</li>
    <li> I usually order mine from a different store (where I pay almost 2x as much for it) but wanted to see if I could get it cheaper. Well, ya get what ya pay for I guess because this doesn&#x27;t seem to be the same quality as what I usually get. It smells the same, and it&#x27;s the correct color but it is definitely gritty when I&#x27;ve never had that before (and I&#x27;ve been using this stuff for 3 yrs or so). I gave it 3 stars as I&#x27;m not noticing any adverse effects and it seems to still be doing its job. Not sure if it is just expired or what. I won&#x27;t be ordering again from this company though I will order it again (if it were the expected consistency it&#x27;d get 5 stars, esp for the price!)</li>
    <li> I bought a 2 year supply because they are closing up shop. Why? Why? The Coffeeberry smooths the wrinkles, but I will move on to Skinceuticals Vitamin C Ferullic now.</li>
    <li> i ordered this product before i was out of product on hand at home, precisely so i wouldn&#x27;t run out and have to wait for a new shipment. once i ran out, i opened my new box. the pump was broken. i researched long and hard to figure out how to return it, but kept hitting walls because the time from purchase and receipt until i actually opened it was too long. i wasn&#x27;t eligible to return it, apparently, under any circumstances. i figured out a way to get it to work, by removing the pump cap. this wasted the product each time i pumped it. i ran out in half the time i should have, but of course that could also be because i never received a full bottle in the first place. i have been ordering revaleskin from amazon for years, but this is the first bad experience i had. for what it&#x27;s worth, the product seemed real; it was not different than when i&#x27;ve had it shipped to me by other sellers in unbroken pumps. i won&#x27;t be using Beauty-Stop (the seller) again.</li>
    <li> This insanely delicious-smelling serum sinks in instantly and over time has evened my complexion and calmed my redness. It smells so great I think I&#x27;d put it on even if it didn&#x27;t do anything.</li>
    <li> I like the product and have purchased previously on several occasions until this past purchase.  The product was bad or out dated and if I decide to purchase from Amazon again I do not want the supplier who sent it….you should have it on record.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you&lt;br /&gt;Bernice Estrada</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about a year now. Makes my skin look wonderful and I love the smell when others have complained about it. Of course I wish it were a bit less expensive...but I love the results and look fabulous!</li>
    <li> This product feels so good on my skin.  I use it alternating with my Retin A regimen, alternating nights.  This prevents my skin from getting too dry and flaky.  I would recommend trying this product, it feels wonderful going on.</li>
    <li> I love this cream. It smells like coffee, but the smell goes away after a while.  Overall, it is a great facial cream.</li>
    <li> Smells amazing. Didn&#x27;t see huge difference in skin though..</li>
    <li> Aging, sensitive skin seems improved with this product.  Treatment helped remove pink spots after my scars healed, and It seems I won&#x27;t need to purchase more.</li>
    <li> My skin looks so much younger and firmer.  I need tiny amount and it keeps hydrate my face over the night, it gets solves skin very well, smells delicious.  Cream is light and not oily,  so I can use before make up as well.  The price is reasonable as its performance.</li>
    <li> I love this product. I notice a difference each time I use it.&lt;br /&gt;I have never liked anything as much as I like this...</li>
    <li> I researched green coffee berry extract and read that it is the highest in antioxidents so thought I&#x27;d give it a try. When I made a visit to my skin doctor, he actually commented on the glow of my skin. I ordered it again!</li>
    <li> Not as good as Replenix products.  Sometimes smells funny.  Doesn&#x27;t blend well with the sunscreen that I love.  Leaves a dark residue after many hours of wear.</li>
    <li> my skin feels better- i look forward to my nighttime routine as this really feels nourishing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have rosacea and this is the only thing that has brought some serious improvement and calm to my red cheeks.</li>
    <li> My dermatologist recommended this treatment, and I continue to use it nightly. However, I have not noticed that it makes much difference to my skin. I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s worth the price.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! It smells great and leaves my skin with a wonderful texture! It&#x27;s a great product, although a bit expensive!</li>
    <li> I have a fabulous dermatologist who suggested this product--for daytime use only. After a few months, my skin is noticeably improved.  The anti-oxident properties apparently need daylight to activated, so use another product in the evening. The smell is wonderful if you like coffee.</li>
    <li> This is one of the few facial products where I have noticed a difference when I use it and this is unusual for me for someone with older skin.</li>
    <li> I love this product. It is amazing how well it works!</li>
    <li> I really enjoy using this product. I do not know if my skin looks any younger (maybe yes, maybe no) but it feel really nice on my skin and keep my face feeling soft and not oily.  I have a tendency towards break outs and this product does not make me break out.</li>
    <li> Excellent Product&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used this product after finding  reviews of it on several sites.  I just finished using Carac which is&lt;br /&gt;a chemotherapy  medication for premaligmant skin lesions and my face was looking and feeling awful from the harshness of the treatment.  The Coffeeberry extract soothed and healed my face in a matter of weeks and now my skin looks better than it has in years.&lt;br /&gt;Believe it or not, I am 79 years old and often get mistaken for 65. Some of it may be genetic, but I know that the RevaleSkin Recovery Treatment has had a remarkable effect on how my skin has healed from the Carac treatment.</li>
    <li> It was recommended by a dermatologist, but I find several dermatologists who have never heard of it.&lt;br /&gt;I find that my skin feels better when I place the extract on my face before retiring for the evening.&lt;br /&gt;I use it very sparingly because it is so expensive. Is there a discount if I purchase several extracts at one time?&lt;br /&gt;Note: the plunger device does not always work properly.&lt;br /&gt;Question - I have psoriasis of the scalp. Could I use this extract on my scalp? Or is it only for the face?&lt;br /&gt;Could the extract be provided in a jar? I&#x27;m never sure that I use it all up when the plunger quits working.</li>
    <li> Been using this product for a month and haven&#x27;t noticed much benefit.  Could be I don&#x27;t notice what it has done for my skin&lt;br /&gt;.</li>
    <li> Good service&lt;br /&gt;Good product</li>
    <li> Skin feels clean and fresh after using it. A great restorer for my skin! The coffee berry smell is great!</li>
    <li> I live in the high DRY desert.  I would be totally prune dry without RevaleSkin.</li>
    <li> I bough this after I read Dr. Wu&#x27;s book &#x27;&#x27;Feed your face&#x27;&#x27;. I bought it because she mentioned that for dark spots that have less than 6 months some kind of botanical extract could help. She recomended two, this was one of them. I got this sun spot on my face (tiny but noticeable because I have fair skin) and I wanted something to take it away. It&#x27;s only been 3 weeks since I got this product and I mostly combine it with some other products so I don&#x27;t use it daily but about 4 times a week during nights. (I dont use it during the day because I notice it can leave a tiny residual (the color of the serum is light brownish/green) either way this didn&#x27;t affect the stars I am giving this product because I prefer to use these kind of products at nighr anyway. So... anyway, the sun spot is slightly lighter, but overall what I have found after usin this product is that it leaves your skin so radiant, full of life, tight... It doesn&#x27;t erase the sun spots (at least not yet) who knows... (remember I only use it 4 times a week during the night). But my skin complexion is much better! That is for sure! I love to try new beauty products, but I also don&#x27;t like to have 6 serums or 4 nightcreams for the same thing... so I only keep the best ones. As far for my serum/treatment I will surely keep this new treasure.</li>
    <li> My dermatologist recommended this. I  have rosacea and can&#x27;t use a lot of products.  Though I&#x27;m not crazy about the scent, I think it&#x27;s a great product. My skin looks improved even after only a week. I will likely continue to add products from this line.  i paid about 1/2 on line as what I would have for the same product at the Dr. office.  It&#x27;s the same products as the samples that were given to me.  I recommend this product and this seller.</li>
    <li> Great fast delivery service! Product smells amazing like a cup of coffee in the morning.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m surprised I haven&#x27;t seen my complaint of this product in other reviews.  I purchased this to use for daytime under a moisturizer and foundation makeup.  I can&#x27;t do that because if I touch my face during the day, it pills and rolls of in my hand, that is if I can even apply a foundation without it rolling off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use products with peptides and retinol for nighttime use and wanted to use an antioxidant for daytime to protect from the environment.  I did, however, start alternating products with this at night, so it wouldn&#x27;t be a total loss at this high price.  Since as a serum it isn&#x27;t enough to moisturize, I put a moisturizer over it (different moisturizer from daytime) and same thing--it rolls off!.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the only product I have which does this, and I have tried three foundations, and different moisturizers (all of which have no problem with other serums); I know this is the problem product.  I will use this below the neck only, as I don&#x27;t throw away products I have paid so much for, but I will never repurchase.</li>
    <li> I use this product every day and when I saw it on Amazon for considerably less than I usually pay I ordered it.  The product was darker, smelled odd and I was hesitant to use it on my face.  I returned it and Amazon gave me a full refund.  I guess when the price is too good to be true it is indeed not true.</li>
    <li> My dermatologist recommended this product.  I used to use Olay Regenerist and thought I&#x27;d probably &#x27;topped out&#x27; in terms of that product&#x27;s effectiveness.  This new serum slides on beautifully and is SO great under sunblock, makeup, etc.  My skin (and I&#x27;m in my 60&#x27;s) is the best its ever been.  Pricey but worth it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used RevaleSkin products for years. This product oxidizes as it ages, changing in color from a light tan to brown. The product I received was dark brown from the initial opening, indicating that it was not fresh.</li>
    <li> great product to use with retinol based products . much more reasonably priced than on other sites. i&#x27;ve read the company has stopped making it, what a shame.</li>
    <li> Love Love Love...got turned on to the RevaleSkin line by my dermatologist.  Feels great on the skin, does not over moisturize or leave me oily feeling and smells heavenly.</li>
    <li> Bottle broke in two weeks</li>
    <li> Great product! Will continue to buy!  Wish there was no fragrance.  Tightens and brightens your skin.</li>
    <li> The moisturizer pump was defective, and the overall authenticity of the product was questionable. The product label differed from the same product I purchased from my dermatologist two months ago, and the bottle had clearly been tampered with. WHAT A RIP-OFF! DO NOT BUY!!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I chose a 5 star rating of the product because I have been using it for years with great results.  I am pleased with the company and pleased to be able to find such great deals on Amazon</li>
    <li> The clean smell of coffee only enhances this product. So far my rosacea prone skin has been perfect and very clear.</li>
    <li> Love it!  It runs out fast and it is a bit costly, but I do love the product!</li>
    <li> This was recommended to me by my dermatologist who said it was one of the few products that actually works. He was right! I have acne scars that were getting brown looking and this totally reversed that.</li>
    <li> This product was recommended by my dermatologist.  I have been using it for a long time. I have seen marked improvement in my skin.</li>
    <li> Love this face cream!! Smooth and refreshing on my skin!</li>
    <li> I am 62 years old and this product makes my skin feel wonderful.  Most days the only makeup I wear is mascara.</li>
    <li> I bought this one for my mother who has tried almost everything. She is in her 70´s and her skin looks amazing. Even our dermatologist asked her what she has had been doing for her skin looks so great. She loves it and asked me to get her a new one as far as she noticed she is running out of it. Not because she is my mother, but the true is that she looks so great for her age. I always find the best price here in amazon!</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t buy, the smell and the color is different from the one I bought at the dermatologist.&lt;br /&gt;Lyrics of the box are not sharp</li>
    <li> I tried this  as a sample from another website, and when I found out the cost, I couldn&#x27;t justify it.  I went to Amazon and there it was  - $60.00 cheaper.  It is a great product for dry sensitive skin, my skin has never looked better, I really do like this product!</li>
    <li> Unfortunately, this is a pump dispensor and the pump does not open properly.&lt;br /&gt;I will have to break the tube to get to the lotion.</li>
    <li> great product, delivered in timely fashion.  thank you.</li>
    <li> It was expensive and it made my face more red, not less red, which I think may be from the licorice root extract.</li>
    <li> I love the product but I have a defective dispenser and had to tear it apart in order to get to the product.  My dispenser is now in 3 pieces and of course when I use the pump I have to be careful that the product doesn&#x27;t go everywhere.</li>
    <li> My dermatologist recommended this product......my skin looks and feels better when using it ....and it smells good....which is a bonus!!</li>
