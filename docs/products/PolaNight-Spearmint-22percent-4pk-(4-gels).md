      <li>This is a great product and the merchant provides quick and reliable service.</li>
      <li>I love</li>
      <li>I love this product and have been using for years.</li>
      <li>That means I pay more</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m glad I can buy this through   Amazon.</li>
      <li>This is authentic.</li>
      <li>and they used pola night for whitening and was able to find the product on Amazon.</li>
      <li>Love it works great decently priced what more can one ask for?</li>
      <li>Cleaned my teeth to a brilliant white and no sensitivity all in 45 minutes at a time!!</li>
      <li>Arrived on time, nice large size.  </li>
      <li>and you can get custom trays made for cheap compared to the dentist</li>
      <li>This product works wonders and the price is great, I had purchased the same whitening system from my dentist and payed 5x the cost of these.  </li>
      <li>I ORIGINALLY GOT IT FROM MY DENTIST</li>
      <li>Previously ordered PolaNight from Amazon - thru another vendor and loved the PolaNight!  </li>
      <li>I am 70 years old, have all my own teeth which were browning with age, had trays &amp; 2 tubes from dentist, then ordered 22%.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s very convenient to just order it and have it show up at my door, and a better price, too.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used a quick 45 minute application before from the dentist and it was fast and strong.  </li>
      <li>Amazing my teeth have never been so white</li>
      <li>if you do plan to use this i would suggest getting some sensitive toothpaste as most people this will cause some sensitivity.</li>
      <li>and this product really works, just need to make sure you buy whitening trays or if you have a  tray retainer like I do, then you are all set and ready to start whitening as soon as you receive the product.</li>
      <li>This application does not seem to be as effective and I will have to go through all 4 tubes(approx. 10 applications) to get the same whiteness from 1 tube (5 applications) from the dentist.</li>
      <li>Definitely worth the buy</li>
      <li>But there are other teeth-whitening products that get good reviews here on Amazon, so I&#x27;ll try another one instead.</li>
      <li>It lasts about  4-6 months depending if you don&#x27;t smoke or drink coffee or red wine that produces stains on your teeth more quickly.</li>
      <li>My dentist sells this exact stuff (PolaNight 22% carbamide peroxide) for $25 for TWO syringes (about 2 weeks worth).</li>
      <li>This is the exact at home kit I received from my Dentist...</li>
      <li>And much much cheaper!</li>
      <li>Really works!  </li>
      <li>I actually appreciate that it is not as strong as the dentist application.</li>
      <li>It never makes my teeth or gums hurt when I use it, and improvement is very noticeable.</li>
      <li>The product really whitens teeth, so I use it every 6 to 9 months.</li>
      <li>Works gr8 and much cheaper than purchasing from the dentist.</li>
      <li>However, the polanight does work and is gentle.  </li>
      <li>I received the product on time and the price was really affordable.</li>
      <li>Just use a cloth and floss  to gently remove any surface plaque.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>/&gt;This is very aggressive whitening but is gentle.</li>
      <li>I have used it the paste many times and they are lying about this product this is some other teeth</li>
      <li>get compliments on my smile pretty regularly now.  </li>
      <li>Wow  Love the product and it works on my old, yellow teeth</li>
      <li>Each tube will last 2.5 applications (3 if you are lucky).  </li>
      <li>it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend polanight gel.  </li>
      <li>And it&#x27;s the same exact freaking formula!</li>
      <li>\\&quot;You have such a pretty smile,\\</li>
      <li>But after about 3 sessions, my teeth looked exactly the same</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m on my 4th syringe and barely notice much whitening.</li>
      <li>I felt like it was working because my teeth were very sore the next day.</li>
      <li>but that being said this stuff has whited my teeth so much in the last week</li>
      <li>you have sensitive teeth don&#x27;t brush immediately before or after.</li>
      <li>Also, even though I only kept the tray in my mouth for less than an hour, usually 45 minutes, I experienced quite a bit of sensitivity the following day each time I used it.  </li>
      <li>Sure, gums are a bit sensitive for 24 hours, no great deal.</li>
      <li>used to brush my teeth with Colgate Total toothpaste with whitening, and I always had pretty white teeth, but then I started using Tom&#x27;s and other natural brands of toothpaste without fluoride and SLS.  </li>
      <li>The product is good but missing syringes is not good!</li>

<li> It&#x27;s the exact same product but without the hard shell case - which is a waste anyway if you throw it away each time you get a new supply.  </li>
<li> Usually whitening products work very well for me, but not this one.  </li>
<li> and I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s long enough to work.</li>
<li> It really worked well for me and my teeth are hard to whiten.  </li>
<li> I only use tiny dots of gel; a little goes a long way.  </li>
<li> I&#x27;m down to the last bit in the last syringe and there is minimal improvement in the appearance of my teeth.</li>
<li> as if you use the plain thermos mold trays and it gets on your gums it will burn and possibly turn them white for a day or two.</li>
<li> Boost with half tube every month or so, refrain from curry &amp; tomato based foods, drink red wine &amp; coffee through a straw for 3 days as teeth are porous.</li>
<li> One day I was curious if it happened to be sold on Amazon.</li>
<li> This is the same bleach I get from my dentist-for less money!</li>
<li> That was something that had never happened with any other whitening product.      </li>
<li> Not sure if its the same stuff I get from my dentist. ..  </li>
<li> I occasionally whiten the backs of my front teeth and molars usually every other month.</li>
<li> But is taking ages to get to the whiteness that I&#x27;ve had with other brands.</li>
<li> So I could only use this product every other day; otherwise, it might have gotten worse.  </li>
<li> (I drink very dark coffee, and drink it black.)    </li>
<li> There were two syringes missing from one of the packs.</li>
<li> For 4 syringes on here its less than $20!</li>
<li> but through Amazon it is 75% less money!  </li>
<li> Hi - I usually purchase this product from my dentist&#x27;s office.  </li>
<li> I would recommend this product highly you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
<li> Having ordered once from this awful organisation I have for the second time been bombarded by email some very threatening from very angry customers on the list of this company.&lt;br</li>
<li> Unfortunately, they don&#x27;t keep my teeth as white.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> email address has been circulated to some very angry customers who are also horrified at the breach of data protection.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Works gr8 and much cheaper than purchasing from the dentist.</li>
    <li> I love this product and have been using for years.</li>
    <li> Amazing my teeth have never been so white</li>
    <li> Usually whitening products work very well for me, but not this one.  I&#x27;m down to the last bit in the last syringe and there is minimal improvement in the appearance of my teeth. I use a tray made for my teeth by the dentist, and only wanted to remove coffee stains from my lower teeth. (I drink very dark coffee, and drink it black.)    Also, even though I only kept the tray in my mouth for less than an hour, usually 45 minutes, I experienced quite a bit of sensitivity the following day each time I used it.  So I could only use this product every other day; otherwise, it might have gotten worse.  That was something that had never happened with any other whitening product.      I think if I had the patience to get through 12 syringes of this product, I would eventually achieve the desired results.  But there are other teeth-whitening products that get good reviews here on Amazon, so I&#x27;ll try another one instead.</li>
    <li> I love the polanight 22% gel!  My dentist gives me 2 syringes at each 6 month checkup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used to brush my teeth with Colgate Total toothpaste with whitening, and I always had pretty white teeth, but then I started using Tom&#x27;s and other natural brands of toothpaste without fluoride and SLS.  Unfortunately, they don&#x27;t keep my teeth as white.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started using polanight about 7 months ago and I only whiten my teeth occasionally, about every month or so.  I only use tiny dots of gel; a little goes a long way.  I also only whiten my teeth that show.  (There isn&#x27;t a lot of point to whitening back teeth!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I get compliments on my smile pretty regularly now.  \\&quot;You have such a pretty smile,\\&quot; people say.  \\&quot;Your teeth are so white!\\&quot;  I love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend polanight gel.  It never makes my teeth or gums hurt when I use it, and improvement is very noticeable.</li>
    <li> I purchased PolaNight from the dentist. It really worked well for me and my teeth are hard to whiten.  I&#x27;m glad I can buy this through   Amazon.</li>
    <li> I have been using Pola Night for over a year. It works for me. It lasts about  4-6 months depending if you don&#x27;t smoke or drink coffee or red wine that produces stains on your teeth more quickly. I would definitely recommend this product. I had my teeth trays made at my dentist and they used pola night for whitening and was able to find the product on Amazon.</li>
    <li> This is a great product and the merchant provides quick and reliable service. I would recommend this product highly you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> I did not realize that these are very tiny application syringes.  Each tube will last 2.5 applications (3 if you are lucky).  I&#x27;ve used a quick 45 minute application before from the dentist and it was fast and strong.  This application does not seem to be as effective and I will have to go through all 4 tubes(approx. 10 applications) to get the same whiteness from 1 tube (5 applications) from the dentist. However, the polanight does work and is gentle.  I actually appreciate that it is not as strong as the dentist application. However, for my personal preference, I would rather have a 10 ml tube with application marks along the side. One 10ml tube from the dentist with 5 applications whitened my teeth to \\&quot;glowing.\\&quot;  I&#x27;m on my 4th syringe and barely notice much whitening.</li>
    <li> This is the same bleach I get from my dentist-for less money! It does not irritate my gums and bleaches my teeth reasonably white.</li>
    <li> I ORIGINALLY GOT IT FROM MY DENTIST AND NOW I WAS VERY HAPPY TO SEE ON LINE, IT WORKS WELL</li>
    <li> I think this product might be out-of-date! That is why they are priced lower. I would NOT buy these again!!!!</li>
    <li> I am 70 years old, have all my own teeth which were browning with age, had trays &amp; 2 tubes from dentist, then ordered 22%. Boost with half tube every month or so, refrain from curry &amp; tomato based foods, drink red wine &amp; coffee through a straw for 3 days as teeth are porous. Teeth are amazing, get compliments all the time. Sure, gums are a bit sensitive for 24 hours, no great deal. Brush with Oral B brilliance toothpaste. Not rocket science for WHITE teeth!</li>
    <li> Yes it was the best ever.  Cleaned my teeth to a brilliant white and no sensitivity all in 45 minutes at a time!!</li>
    <li> Good product. But is taking ages to get to the whiteness that I&#x27;ve had with other brands. Suppose you get what you pay for,</li>
    <li> This is the exact at home kit I received from my Dentist... but through Amazon it is 75% less money!  Wow  Love the product and it works on my old, yellow teeth, that are white again.</li>
    <li> I smoke. I drink coffee. Nobody would ever guess that. This is authentic. Same as dentist&#x27;s. My office charges $24.99 per two tubes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have sensitive teeth don&#x27;t brush immediately before or after. Just use a cloth and floss  to gently remove any surface plaque.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is very aggressive whitening but is gentle. No sudden shooting pains with this like the others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only need a drop of gel per tooth front. I occasionally whiten the backs of my front teeth and molars usually every other month.</li>
    <li> There were two syringes missing from one of the packs. Contacted Amazon but never got a reply. The product is good but missing syringes is not good!</li>
    <li> Love it works great decently priced what more can one ask for?</li>
    <li> The product really whitens teeth, so I use it every 6 to 9 months. I received the product on time and the price was really affordable. For one of the syringes at my dentist&#x27;s office its 20 dollars. For 4 syringes on here its less than $20!</li>
    <li> I felt like it was working because my teeth were very sore the next day. But after about 3 sessions, my teeth looked exactly the same</li>
    <li> Arrived on time, nice large size.  Works great and cleans easily.</li>
    <li> as good as the product i buy from my dentist and at 1/4 the price.&lt;br /&gt;easily cleans and soaks while i just look good</li>
    <li> Did not meet my expectations.  Previously ordered PolaNight from Amazon - thru another vendor and loved the PolaNight!  Saw ZERO difference with this last order!  Will not order again from this vendor.</li>
    <li> This product met &amp; exceeded my expectations. Cheaper than when I purchased it from my dentist. I will continue to use.</li>
    <li> Hi - I usually purchase this product from my dentist&#x27;s office.  That means I pay more and sometimes I run out between cleanings and then I have to go to their offices to stock up.  Now that I&#x27;ve found it from this supplier on Amazon it&#x27;s very convenient to just order it and have it show up at my door, and a better price, too.  It&#x27;s the exact same product but without the hard shell case - which is a waste anyway if you throw it away each time you get a new supply.  Now I just keep the case and order the refills.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for the good buying experience!</li>
    <li> Having ordered once from this awful organisation I have for the second time been bombarded by email some very threatening from very angry customers on the list of this company.&lt;br /&gt;My email address has been circulated to some very angry customers who are also horrified at the breach of data protection.&lt;br /&gt;I want my details removed from the companies records and would recommend nobody provides any confidential information to them.&lt;br /&gt;Absolutely not acceptable.&lt;br /&gt;AWFUL and No Stars</li>
    <li> Really works!  You can see the difference immediately.</li>
    <li> Not sure if its the same stuff I get from my dentist. ..  I used all four tubes and didn&#x27;t see a difference.</li>
    <li> This product works wonders and the price is great, I had purchased the same whitening system from my dentist and payed 5x the cost of these.  Definitely worth the buy and this product really works, just need to make sure you buy whitening trays or if you have a  tray retainer like I do, then you are all set and ready to start whitening as soon as you receive the product.</li>
    <li> this stuff works great i would recommend getting custom trays to use with this product. as if you use the plain thermos mold trays and it gets on your gums it will burn and possibly turn them white for a day or two. but that being said this stuff has whited my teeth so much in the last week i am amazed and wish i would have know amazon had this stuff sooner. if you do plan to use this i would suggest getting some sensitive toothpaste as most people this will cause some sensitivity. if you are looking for trays and gel look at sporting smiles or they have a store here on amazon also and you can get custom trays made for cheap compared to the dentist</li>
    <li> I initially purcahse Polanight from my dentist... Who charged me an arm and a leg for it... One day I was curious if it happened to be sold on Amazon. To my delight, it is! And much much cheaper! And it&#x27;s the same exact freaking formula!</li>
    <li> My dentist sells this exact stuff (PolaNight 22% carbamide peroxide) for $25 for TWO syringes (about 2 weeks worth). Here, you get FOUR syringes for ~$15. This stuff works great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a side note, my dentist instructs me to leave this stuff on 2-4 hours at a time when I&#x27;m using it. Just thought I&#x27;d mention this because I see people listing 15-20 minutes and I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s long enough to work.</li>
    <li> Works well. Good price.</li>
    <li> This is just like what I get at the dentist, but easier to obtain and cheaper. Works great! Saw results after two treatments!</li>
    <li> this is not pola night teeth whiting I have used it the paste many times and they are lying about this product this is some other teeth whiting gel NOT POLANIGHT</li>
