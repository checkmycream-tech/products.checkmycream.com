      <li>it&#x27;s own, and I put off finding anything to resolve my problem.</li>
      <li>AT A RESONABLE PRICE, MAXIMUM GROWTH CLEAR NAIL POLISH IS THE BEST</li>
      <li>I HAVE USED IT FOR MANY YEARS AND WAS SO EXCITED TO SEE IT AT THIS AMAZING PRICE!</li>
      <li>It arrived in a decent amount of time and was in very good condition.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for 3 days and the results are pretty great, and for 3$ its a bargain</li>
      <li>If you follow the instructions exactly as it says you will get great results.</li>
      <li>I had to dilute it with top coat/alcohol to get it to be usable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>love it.&lt;br /&gt;I am almost out and need to repurchase.</li>
      <li>What more is there to say?</li>
      <li>so they&#x27;re *able to grow</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s ok,</li>
      <li>What more can you ask of a nail product?</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m considering pairing it with Hair, Skin &amp; Nails for even better results.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;i love that my nails are getting longer and growing.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I have used many sally hansen products and I just love them all.&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
      <li>My nails look even better than when I paid for scupts.  </li>
      <li>I receive many compliments on my nails.</li>
      <li>i top with salley hansen &amp;#34;hard as nails&amp;#34; just to assure that they wouldnt break. .</li>
      <li>But with this it made them stronger and a bit more longer than normal.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>I love it.  </li>
      <li>(also, removing and then reapplying the polish works better than just leaving it on and applying more on top in my opinion).</li>
      <li>It dries nice and quick, and within about an hour after applying,</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m a huge at-home beauty nut, so this is a favorite product of mine.  </li>
      <li>Fortunately, when I went to the beauty aisle, this miracle in a bottle was available!</li>
      <li>so touch-ups are easy</li>
      <li>It is easy to put on, and \\&quot;mistakes\\&quot; don&#x27;t show up...like polish on skin</li>
      <li>and my nails were flexible and strong.</li>
      <li>It does keep my nails strong and helps them grow faster.</li>
      <li>However, I took the time to read the reviews on Amazon and noticed people were having better results with this cheap polish than they were with the golden, sparkly, $20 bottle of polish!</li>
      <li>nails normally grow a good amount.</li>
      <li>SO IF YOU WANT BEAUTIFUL LONG STRONG NAILS</li>
      <li>My mom and sister both use this regularly as well and enjoy great results.  </li>
      <li>Not even the OPI Nail Envy could do that for me, and this is cheaper and available everywhere&lt;</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t take to much time to do my own nails</li>
      <li>I love this product have been using it for about 10 years its the only product that will make my nails grow, strong and healthy!</li>
      <li>I apply two coats on clean nails and remove after 2 days and repeat.</li>
      <li>This product is true to what its claims to do.</li>
      <li>if whatever \\&quot;good brand\\&quot; nail polish, then the Sally Hansen Dri-Fast Anti-Chip Topcoat (in the red bottle)</li>
      <li>/&gt;This is even better than the HAN original product, since the HAN fluid gets more viscous and denser in time.</li>
      <li>My nails break easily and I&#x27;m trying to stop biting them and this product has helped them grow so much!</li>
      <li>/&gt;UPDATE---Use MIRACLE CURE product now.&lt;br /&gt;Please see my latest comment on Sally Hansen&#x27;s Miracle Cure (blue bottle) product, which is even better than this one.&lt;br /&gt;Note</li>
      <li>since using this product i have noticed a tremendous amount of a nail growth.&lt;br</li>
      <li>It grows your nails and relatively quickly too.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Miracle Cure (blue bottle) is much better!</li>
      <li>theyve grown and have been the pretty nails I&#x27;ve always wanted!</li>
      <li>I bought just to have a clear polish and got much more than I bargained for.  </li>
      <li>A week of this stuff brings them back to a nice state</li>
      <li>now they are strong and steady growing with out the &amp;#34;hard as nails&amp;#34;</li>
      <li>I love how strong and long my nails are</li>
      <li>you can see the difference your nail will grow pretty fast , now i had originally taken pictures to show the progress for a month</li>
      <li>As a chronic nail biter, I saw a huge difference between letting my nails grow naturally and letting them grow while using this product.</li>
      <li>This is the longest my nails have been in my whole life!</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know anything about nail strengtheners, but when I first started having chipping and peeling issues about a year ago, I didn&#x27;t do anything about it.</li>
      <li>If you use this stuff daily you will surely be satisfied.</li>
      <li>I followed the instructions exactly.  </li>
      <li>and my nails are long and healthy. .</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used this product in the past and loved it.</li>
      <li>I have used the product for a little over one week, and I am amazed at how much better my nails are looking!</li>
      <li>I REALLY LIKE THIS PRODUCT.</li>
      <li>But this really works tho.</li>
      <li>and i can assure you this really works within a week</li>
      <li>I always seem to put too much on with 2 coats and then it has to be removed in 2 or 3 days after washing dishes, chores etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>i don&#x27;t think is working so much</li>
      <li>I ALSO HAVE OTHER TIPS TO KEEP YOUR NAILS FROM SNAGGING AND TIPS TO MAKE THEM SHINE EVEN MORE.</li>
      <li>My nails constantly chip and peel but have improved significantly while using this product.  </li>
      <li>My only complaint is my nails are growing at significantly different speeds, so I don&#x27;t have similar length-ed nails, but I&#x27;m sure that has more to do with my own nails than this product.</li>
      <li>However, I&#x27;ve found my little miracle when it comes to healthy nails.</li>
      <li>HIGHLY RECOMMEND to anyone who wants long pretty nails! 💁</li>
      <li>It says to apply a fresh coat daily.</li>
      <li>and they&#x27;re super long now.</li>
      <li>Didn&#x27;t dry as quickly</li>
      <li>People don&#x27;t believe they are my natural nails if I use color polish</li>
      <li>I GET COMPLIMENTS ON MY NATURAL NAILS</li>
      <li>I have soft and peeling nails that tear all the time.  </li>
      <li>I have used several products claiming to help your nails grow but this one really works for me</li>
      <li>remember that acrylics will always do harm to your natural nails</li>
      <li>I have used this since I was 20 years old.</li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t let the old name fool you.  </li>
      <li>so I just like to show my natural nails with the Maximum Growth shine.</li>
      <li>and soon I&#x27;ll be getting a french manicure to show off my new nails!</li>
      <li>Never steers me wrong; the nail polish strengthens nails and works as an amazing base and top coat also (nice and shiny).</li>
      <li>And during that time my nails barely grew at all.</li>
      <li>but I&#x27;m not too happy about the stained look they have now :(</li>

    <li> I have used several products claiming to help your nails grow but this one really works for me and I saw improvement within two weeks.  My nails constantly chip and peel but have improved significantly while using this product.  There are several types of Sally Hansen polishes but this works best for me. (Sally Hansen Maximum Growth)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a week, and my nails are still peeling. Don&#x27;t waste your money</li>
    <li> My nails are thin and they crack easily. Not only that, but I wash dishes and wash my hands so often, the water often makes them worse. However, I&#x27;ve found my little miracle when it comes to healthy nails. I&#x27;ve tried every other green tea nail polish out there, and every polish that claims it will make your nails grow... And Sally Hansen&#x27;s Maximum Growth is the only one that&#x27;s actually done what they say  it will do. I redo my nails about every two weeks, and I always - ALWAYS - use one coat of this as a base coat and then proceed with whatever design I plan to do. This would have been my fourth bottle, if I didn&#x27;t receive it broken in the mail. Amazon promptly refunded me though. But that will not stop me from purchasing it. I just need to buy it at the store like I&#x27;ve been doing.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know anything about nail strengtheners, but when I first started having chipping and peeling issues about a year ago, I didn&#x27;t do anything about it. Unfortunately, the problem didn&#x27;t clear up on it&#x27;s own, and I put off finding anything to resolve my problem. Fortunately, when I went to the beauty aisle, this miracle in a bottle was available! I originally glanced past it because I figured the small price tag correlated with the quality. However, I took the time to read the reviews on Amazon and noticed people were having better results with this cheap polish than they were with the golden, sparkly, $20 bottle of polish! I took the plunge and I&#x27;m so happy I did. I have used the product for a little over one week, and I am amazed at how much better my nails are looking! I applied one thin coat a day for one week, and after the week, I removed the polish and started over. I have noticed my nails still peel slightly and have chipped twice, but the length of my nails are definitely improving. My only complaint is my nails are growing at significantly different speeds, so I don&#x27;t have similar length-ed nails, but I&#x27;m sure that has more to do with my own nails than this product. I will definitely buy another bottle!</li>
    <li> excellent I&#x27;m seeing the diference already!!</li>
    <li> I have used many sally hansen products and I just love them all.&lt;br /&gt;My nails normally grow a good amount. But with this it made them stronger and a bit more longer than normal.&lt;br /&gt;I love it.&lt;br /&gt;I am almost out and need to repurchase.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing.  Don&#x27;t let the old name fool you.  I bought just to have a clear polish and got much more than I bargained for.  I put on two coats and undercoated under my nails.  Then every day afterwards I put on one topcoat and undercoat.  In 10 days my nails looked great.  They were protected as I did dishes and other household chores hard on nails.  I have soft and peeling nails that tear all the time.  No more.  My nails look even better than when I paid for scupts.  Thank you Sally Hanson!!!  I sing your praises.  I only used Sally H nails color since I trust their formulas.</li>
    <li> I have used this since I was 20 years old. I am now about to turn 41 in December.  It has always worked great. It does keep my nails strong and helps them grow faster. This treatment also has a great shine so I just like to show my natural nails with the Maximum Growth shine. People don&#x27;t believe they are my natural nails if I use color polish so I just use this treatment and that is it. I do my own manicure because I have noticed the 2 times that I have gotten a profetional manucure, that my nails get thin and weak. It doesn&#x27;t take to much time to do my own nails and I know what to do to make them nice. I re do my nails once a week because they are at the length that I like them and don&#x27;t need to use the Maximum Growth as often. I would never stop using this product unless they discontinue it and then I would not know what to do. SO IF YOU WANT BEAUTIFUL LONG STRONG NAILS AT A RESONABLE PRICE, MAXIMUM GROWTH CLEAR NAIL POLISH IS THE BEST I KNOW OF AND IT WON&#x27;T HURT TO GIVE IT A TRY. I ALSO HAVE OTHER TIPS TO KEEP YOUR NAILS FROM SNAGGING AND TIPS TO MAKE THEM SHINE EVEN MORE. IF YOU WANT TO KNOW JUST REPLY TO MY MESSAGE AND I WILL BE HAPPY TO GIVE YOU SOME OF MY SECRETS BUT NOT ALL.  GOOD LUCK AND REMEMBER TO FOR BEGINNERS YOU SHOULD FOLLOW THE INSTRUCTIONS ON THE LABEL. I GET COMPLIMENTS ON MY NATURAL NAILS ALL THE TIME NOW WOULDN&#x27;T YOU LIKE THAT TOO? I AM PROUD TO HAVE THESE GREAT NAILS &amp; IT&#x27;S A SHAME THAT PEOPLE WOULD PAY OTHER PEOPLE SO MUCH MONEY FOR SOMETHING SO SIMPLE TO DO. remember that acrylics will always do harm to your natural nails but there is hope with Maximum Growth.</li>
    <li> My nails are slow-growing and brittle.  They responded to this product within a week and soon I&#x27;ll be getting a french manicure to show off my new nails!</li>
    <li> This stuff worked wonders for me.  I followed the instructions exactly.  It helps keep my soft nails from peeling, and a lot less expensive than the salon.  My nails just don&#x27;t grow without this stuff.  I&#x27;m a huge at-home beauty nut, so this is a favorite product of mine.  My mom and sister both use this regularly as well and enjoy great results.  I&#x27;m considering pairing it with Hair, Skin &amp; Nails for even better results.  If you&#x27;re considering this, then give it a try!</li>
    <li> Excellent item and works</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for 3 days and the results are pretty great, and for 3$ its a bargain</li>
    <li> Sally Hansen is Sally Hansen. Never steers me wrong; the nail polish strengthens nails and works as an amazing base and top coat also (nice and shiny). I receive many compliments on my nails.</li>
    <li> Hard to remove and didn&#x27;t do a thing to help cracking nails or nail growth. How can nails, which are not living tissue, benefit from a layer of protein infused stickum anyway? Placebo effect? Hmm.</li>
    <li> So i started using this product and my nails became longer and stronger. But I notice my nails are a bit yellow :( I&#x27;m wondering if anyone else who has used this product has had the same problem?? I love how strong and long my nails are but I&#x27;m not too happy about the stained look they have now :(</li>
    <li> As a chronic nail biter, I saw a huge difference between letting my nails grow naturally and letting them grow while using this product. A week of this stuff brings them back to a nice state and I will definitely buy this again once I run out. I apply two coats on clean nails and remove after 2 days and repeat. It does peel a bit after a couple days, but it dries on your nails within 30 seconds so touch-ups are easy (also, removing and then reapplying the polish works better than just leaving it on and applying more on top in my opinion).</li>
    <li> What more is there to say? My nails don&#x27;t break. My polish stays on and doesn&#x27;t chip. What more can you ask of a nail product?</li>
    <li> Let me start off by saying don&#x27;t expect miraculous long overnight nail growth, because nothing is going to do that. But if you use this stuff regularly it will make your nails stronger so they&#x27;re *able to grow* long. It dries nice and quick, and within about an hour after applying, if you look at the tips of your nails before and after, your nails have a nice tight curve instead of being flat and weak. Not even the OPI Nail Envy could do that for me, and this is cheaper and available everywhere&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It makes a great base coat too, I use one coat of this, then 2 or 3 coats if whatever \\&quot;good brand\\&quot; nail polish, then the Sally Hansen Dri-Fast Anti-Chip Topcoat (in the red bottle) (It&#x27;ll dry the polish underneath in no time at all, no matter what brand it is, and it doesn&#x27;t do that shrink-and-peel crap like Seche Vite)</li>
    <li> I REALLY LIKE THIS PRODUCT. I HAVE USED IT FOR MANY YEARS AND WAS SO EXCITED TO SEE IT AT THIS AMAZING PRICE!</li>
    <li> I love this product have been using it for about 10 years its the only product that will make my nails grow, strong and healthy!</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing! After a few weeks I could definitely see results but after about 2 months of using it is when my nails really sprung in growth and they&#x27;re super long now. If you use this stuff daily you will surely be satisfied.</li>
    <li> I was applying everyday. Then you get distracted. And forget. If you go 2 days without re applying the coat, it will chip off and your nails are likely to become weak. It&#x27;s ok, i just expected it to last longer in between coats.</li>
    <li> The smell of it it too strong !!! Im wondering why as it suppose to fix the nails</li>
    <li> The directions say to apply this daily but I usually apply it before my base coat, kind of to act as a nail hardener. My nail polish stays on just as long and I still think it works to grow my nails faster. Definitely recommend</li>
    <li> My nails were very short and were paper thin.  I bought it at a grocery store for double the price i got it on AMAZON. I would recommend this to anybody whos wanting long health looking nails</li>
    <li> i don&#x27;t think is working so much but it looks great and I bit this instead of my nails</li>
    <li> This product did nothing to help grow my nails. In fact when I took it off with nail polish remover my nails started to grow almost immediately. So I&#x27;m avoiding using it unless I am going to use it as a base coat but since it didn&#x27;t help my nails grow I feel that I may just throw it away and accept a loss. Too bad. I was hoping it would help.  I had the polish on my nails for a solid 2 weeks. And during that time my nails barely grew at all. I was thinking it was just that I had quit biting my nails and the immediate growth was over with. I was wrong. I don&#x27;t recommend this nail polish to help grow your nails. Save your money.</li>
    <li> I have used Sally Hansen products over the years, including \\&quot;Hard as Nails\\&quot; (HAN) and cuticle oil, and nail polish in various colors.  I always seem to put too much on with 2 coats and then it has to be removed in 2 or 3 days after washing dishes, chores etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This new \\&quot;Maximum growth\\&quot; product in the translucent pink and clear (what I tried first) stays thin in consistency so that I can put on a very thin coat every other day, and it doesn&#x27;t chip, wear off, and looks FANTASTIC!!  It is easy to put on, and \\&quot;mistakes\\&quot; don&#x27;t show up...like polish on skin, cuticle area etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is even better than the HAN original product, since the HAN fluid gets more viscous and denser in time. Eventually the HAN stuff gets too GOOPY, I think because taking up air and the brush helps pull it like taffy.  I won&#x27;t go into the technical details of its turning into a non-Newtonian fluid and why, but I end up having to toss out the HAN bottles half empty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product has become my everyday nail polish. One coat each day, and just layer it on. It doesn&#x27;t chip, or dimple, get sticky etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE---Use MIRACLE CURE product now.&lt;br /&gt;Please see my latest comment on Sally Hansen&#x27;s Miracle Cure (blue bottle) product, which is even better than this one.&lt;br /&gt;Note that the Maximum Growth nail polish started out as clear with a slight pink tinge, but now SH only has it with a YELLOWISH clear color--terrible. Why did they ever change it from the pink hue to the yellow crap is beyond me! As you use it it also gets thicker as air gets into the bottle, turning it into a goopy mess. I had to dilute it with top coat/alcohol to get it to be usable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Miracle Cure (blue bottle) is much better!</li>
    <li> The polish is watery and it peels after a while. But it actually does make my nails grow. I usually take the polish off when it pessimistic and restart over. That seems to make my nails grow faster when I do that rather than adding a new coat everyday.</li>
    <li> since using this product i have noticed a tremendous amount of a nail growth.&lt;br /&gt;i love that my nails are getting longer and growing.&lt;br /&gt;HIGHLY recommend using this product.&lt;br /&gt;although it does have a very nasty odor to it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product in the past and loved it. Unfortunately, local stores stopped carrying it. It arrived in a decent amount of time and was in very good condition. I think it works wonders on nails that are tough to grow and I recommend it wholeheartedly.</li>
    <li> The key seems to be consistency - I used it nightly for about two weeks, and then I switched to every other night until it got thick enough to take it off, started the process over...  and my nails were flexible and strong. If I slacked off for a week, my nails started to peel but if I trimmed the split bits, I could start again with no problem.</li>
    <li> I tried this when I ran out of my regular nail growth stuff, Rejuvacote.  Results were disappointing!  Didn&#x27;t dry as quickly (you have to apply it every day), my nails started to chip (again) in a way they never did after I started using Rejuvacote.  It also didn&#x27;t cover up the ridges that have developed on the surface of my nails during the last few years (I&#x27;m 63).  Too bad - I used to like Sally Hansen, too...but not up to snuff.</li>
    <li> If you follow the instructions exactly as it says you will get great results. It says to apply a fresh coat daily. Meaning remove the previous application with nailpolish remover and apply a new coat every single day. If you can keep up with that then this is the nail growth polish for you.</li>
    <li> Works amazing! Had really short nails who always seemed to peel but now for the last week I&#x27;ve been using this theyve grown and have been the pretty nails I&#x27;ve always wanted! HIGHLY RECOMMEND to anyone who wants long pretty nails! 💁</li>
    <li> I bought mine from Walmart. My nails break easily and I&#x27;m trying to stop biting them and this product has helped them grow so much! This is the longest my nails have been in my whole life!</li>
    <li> So for the longest time now i had been trying to grow my nails and i can assure you this really works within a week you can see the difference your nail will grow pretty fast , now i had originally taken pictures to show the progress for a month i took a pic of my nails every week but i had a little problem my phone fell in the pool and well its not water proof and it stopped working and i lost everything :( . But this really works tho.</li>
    <li> I dont understand the negative reviews. I had a SEVERE nail bitting problem along with veryyy weak thin nails IF they ever grew. . .ive used this everyday for 2 weeks and my nails are long and healthy. . i top with salley hansen &amp;#34;hard as nails&amp;#34; just to assure that they wouldnt break. . now they are strong and steady growing with out the &amp;#34;hard as nails&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> This product is true to what its claims to do. It grows your nails and relatively quickly too. Buy it!</li>
    <li> I love it.  Got my nails back in shape in no time.  Delivery was spot on.</li>
    <li> Best product I&#x27;ve tried for nail growth. Within 5 days I noticed a difference in my nails. They&#x27;re longer and stronger. I&#x27;ve been using the polish about a month now and I couldn&#x27;t be happier. If you want your nails to grow faster and stronger-buy it!</li>
    <li> NO ONE HAS TIEMNTO APPLY RVRTY FREACKIN DAY</li>
