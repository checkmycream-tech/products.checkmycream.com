      <li>but if you&#x27;re looking for amazing brushes at low price you need to buy these</li>
      <li>I do love the synthetic brushes they are extremely soft.</li>
      <li>I love them, they are very comparable to the Sigma brushes everyone loves so much.</li>
      <li>but I&#x27;m always looking for new brushes and I needed something else in my cart for free shipping, SO</li>
      <li>They are so soft and easy to blend.</li>
      <li>They all work very well, are super soft and easy to wash.</li>
      <li>Super soft and just the right size!</li>

      <li>I use the smaller brushes for eyeshadow (I have large eyes</li>
      <li>but GUYS these brushes.. are so soft...</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a useful pink pouch with a zip lock style closure.</li>
      <li>I used a mixture of mild dishwashing liquid and olive oil  (the soap cleans it while the oil keeps the soap from drying out the bristles) and washed it out in lukewarm water, and left them on their side to dry overnight.</li>
      <li>The next day I had very soft brushes and none of them shed.</li>
      <li>Although it just came in the plastic and not a pink zipped bag</li>

    <li> Nice and soft. Gets the work done.</li>
    <li> I love these brushes! I ordered them yesterday and got it today! And it delivered earlier then it said. It&#x27;s said it would deliver today at 8:00 pm and it actually delivered at 8:57 am! A great surprise to wake up to! Out of all the 10 brushes, only the big tapered brush shedded only two hairs! There is a little smell but it&#x27;s not really strong. Although it just came in the plastic and not a pink zipped bag :/ but that&#x27;s not a big deal. And the brushes are SO soft! Defiantly dupes of the Sigma brushes but for quarter of the price!</li>
    <li> I love them, they are very comparable to the Sigma brushes everyone loves so much. They arent super dense but are just perfect for me. They all work very well, are super soft and easy to wash. When I was unpackaging one of them, the brush and handle werent together. None of the others were damaged at all. the seller agreed to send a replacement!  Great quality for the price though!</li>
    <li> Love them, great deal for theses brushes.</li>
    <li> The barrel came un attached and the glue came Off on two of them</li>
    <li> I AM IMPRESSED. HIGH QUALITY PRODUCTS AND BRUSHES AND SHIPPED AND DELIVERED WITHIN 2 DAYS. VERY GOOD.</li>
    <li> These brushes are absolutely wonderful! After a few disappointing brush sets, I ordered this one because I was desperately out of good face brushes. When I got them, they did have a chemical scent to them. I washed them before I used them. I used a mixture of mild dishwashing liquid and olive oil  (the soap cleans it while the oil keeps the soap from drying out the bristles) and washed it out in lukewarm water, and left them on their side to dry overnight. The next day I had very soft brushes and none of them shed. I mean it. Not one hair came out. Each brush is densely packed and picks up a good amount of product. I use the smaller brushes for eyeshadow (I have large eyes so this is fine for me) and to detail some face work. I use every brush in this set and not one has let me down. Also, the packaging they came in was nice. It&#x27;s a useful pink pouch with a zip lock style closure. Wonderful affordable purchase :)</li>
    <li> I bought this professional kit  but one of the face brushes came broken :(</li>
    <li> Literally just opened the package I got today (on a Sunday might I add) and I can already tell the brushes are AMAZING!!! Super soft and just the right size! You must buy buy buy!!!!!</li>
    <li> This is my second set of brushes I bought and before taking them out a couple of brushes were detached due to poor glue or something. They could definitely do a better job at these types of things. Then again you get what you pay for. I do love the synthetic brushes they are extremely soft.</li>
    <li> I love these brushes, but the handles fall apart really easily.</li>
    <li> My daughter loves it!</li>
    <li> Bestope makeup brushes are absolutely great brushes.  These brushes are densely packet to collect as much pigment and product as one desires.
