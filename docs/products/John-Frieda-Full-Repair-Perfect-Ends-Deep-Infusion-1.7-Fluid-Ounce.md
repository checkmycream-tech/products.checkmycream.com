      <li>:) JR~</li>
      <li>but, it will make your ends more manageable.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t want to cut off any more of my hair.</li>
      <li>and i love it.</li>
      <li>Great for really really damaged hair.  </li>
      <li>but this is more affordable</li>
      <li>I found to be the best for my teen daughter fried ends.</li>
      <li>I love this stuff.</li>
      <li>I LOVE this product.</li>
      <li>However, since she has been using the Full Repair Perfect Ends, I have noticed a considerable change; her hair feels almost like silk and her ends have more of a sleek finish to them.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried many many products for my fine hair.</li>
      <li>Love this full repair infusion!</li>
      <li>I am very happy I found this and would recommend it to anyone with dry, damaged hair, or frizzy hair.  </li>
      <li>Nice and light and clean smelling.</li>
      <li>I had not seen it in stores &amp; forgot exactly where I bought it, so I&#x27;m glad I found it on here!</li>
      <li>I think for people with relatively normal hair, this would be a good option</li>
      <li>Five stars, this is a small bottle, but the formula is great for my hair and smells good.</li>
      <li>This is strong, yet light weight.</li>
      <li>Just found this product and then it was no longer available in stores.</li>
      <li>it was like it had been filled with tap water.  </li>
      <li>It leaves hair smooth and shiny, but not too shiny.</li>
      <li>Maybe John Frieda people will take notice to the fantastic healing power of coconut oil.</li>
      <li>This not only works great</li>
      <li>- it&#x27;s a bit light . . .</li>
      <li>Perfect Ends Deep Infusion works good on damaged frizzy dead ends.</li>
      <li>my hair is smooth and full.</li>
      <li>Original and delivered on time.</li>
      <li>I used the Full Repair Perfect Ends Deep Infusion as directed on packaging, and my hair is soft and manageable.</li>
      <li>I have been using this along with the full repair shampoo &amp; conditioner</li>
      <li>John Frieda Full Repair</li>
      <li>I have naturally curly/wavy hair, and this is the most important product I use to keep my hair looking nice and natural.</li>
      <li>Even still after three days with Perfect Ends Deep Infusion I have to give the blow dryer a quit and wear my hair up with some Aveeno moisturizer in it to try and heal it up before the next heat wave.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Frieda&#x27;s Perfect Ends Deep Infusion has helped to bring me my &#x27;Seattle&#x27; hair back: stronger, healthier, shinier.</li>
      <li>this truely is the best for thick unruly hair!</li>
      <li>The way it came packaged however, doesn&#x27;t make me feel confident that the bottle I got is brand new.</li>
      <li>This product does exactly as it says it will!</li>
      <li>protection,\\&quot; my ends were burned to a CRISP!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m ready to celebrate my 60th birthday next week with a new Eileen Fisher outfit and a head full of beautiful, wavy, lustrous, chestnut hair.</li>
      <li>This is a great little bottle of hair health.</li>
      <li>The scent is very light, and, after a few hours of lying on my neck and shoulders to warm up to my body temp, I would describe it as taking on the scent of the way my hair smells after being outdoors in the sun and fresh air.</li>
      <li>All professional hair stylist say its best to just cut off the dead ends.</li>
      <li>I have color treated hair and this stuff helps keep my hair soft and smooth!</li>
      <li>Finally, I see it growing and tones of NICE curls ( I also use John Frieda shampoo and curls enhancer spray)</li>
      <li>wow, I haven&#x27;t found anything better.</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s well worth the money.</li>
      <li>felt exactly like it normally does, except the ends were more stringy/oily.</li>
      <li>But compared to other products, it is worth it and does a better job than most others I have tried.</li>
      <li>I use a lot of pumps though, not just one or two...every day, and right after she washes her hair.</li>
      <li>This stuff is strong, if you hair really fine hair you will only need a DROP.</li>
      <li>I put some more on when my hair was barely damp.</li>
      <li>There is no excuse for this, now I have to go cut off more than an inch of my hair</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t heat style my long straight hair that often, but this product keeps my hair very soft, minimizes static, and helps a great deal with being to comb it out, even when it&#x27;s not fully dry.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Quality very good. Works exactly as advertised.</li>
    <li> i love this product, it does wonders!</li>
    <li> I found to be the best for my teen daughter fried ends. She has curly hair that freezes like crazy...she did not even have curls, just a dry &amp;#34;broom look&amp;#34;. Also, even though I never cut her hair for 12 years,  her hair just did not grow more than shoulder length. Till now! I use a lot of pumps though, not just one or two...every day, and right after she washes her hair. Finally, I see it growing and tones of NICE curls ( I also use John Frieda shampoo and curls enhancer spray)</li>
    <li> All of the John Frieda hair products I&#x27;ve used have been excellent, but this one exceeds all others.     I have moderately long hair that falls to the middle of my shoulder blades in the back, with a slight wave, graying, but colored with chestnut-brown henna, so ... it does require regular conditioning to look healthy. I used the Full Repair Perfect Ends Deep Infusion as directed on packaging, and my hair is soft and manageable. Soft to the touch, but with body. This product has oils in it, but it does not make your hair look oily (as some silicone leave-in conditions have done.) I&#x27;m really pleased with how my hair feels and looks (and smells!) since I first used this product four or five days ago.     I rubbed a dab into my palms and began applying to ends of hair and working up to about half of the length of my hair, but mostly concentrating on the last four inches or so at the ends. The scent is very light, and, after a few hours of lying on my neck and shoulders to warm up to my body temp, I would describe it as taking on the scent of the way my hair smells after being outdoors in the sun and fresh air. Very yummy!    I am going on day four or five of the first application of the product, and I&#x27;m going to shampoo today and apply the Deep Infusion to the ends again. I am going to use it with the Deep Infusion Root Lift Foam (which I just got from Amazon) and my Revlon Tourmaline Heat Nano Ceramic Deep Waver (also just got from Amazon.) I&#x27;m tired of wearing my hair pulled back into various types of a \\&quot;styled\\&quot; pony-tail, so I&#x27;m ready to heat style these tresses and wear them \\&quot;down\\&quot; sometimes. The Deep Infusion products will protect my hair from the deep-waver heat styling.     I&#x27;m ready to celebrate my 60th birthday next week with a new Eileen Fisher outfit and a head full of beautiful, wavy, lustrous, chestnut hair. Don&#x27;t let anyone tell you that 40 or 50 is \\&quot;over the hill.\\&quot; :-D</li>
    <li> John Frieda Full Repair Perfect Ends Deep Infusion works good on damaged frizzy dead ends. Personally, I don&#x27;t think any product on the market can mend split ends together. All professional hair stylist say its best to just cut off the dead ends. I didn&#x27;t want to cut off any more of my hair. I just cut off 2-inches 2-weeks ago.&lt;br /&gt;I relaxed my hair 1-week ago and my ends were still frizzy, damaged, and dead looking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I saw an advertisement of this product on u-tube. It look like it worked wonders on the model&#x27;s hair. I purchased it on Amazon. I used it with coconut oil to seal the ends. The next day, I comb my hair and blow dried it. My hair comb glide with ease through down to the ends. My ends were no longer tangled, dry, brittle, and breaking. This product saved my hair from another hair cut. I&#x27;m really happy with the results. Full Repair Perfect Ends Deep Infusion is very moisturizing to my damaged ends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this products to anyone who really do not want to cut their hair due to damaged ends. Its not a cure but, it will make your ends more manageable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reason I gave this product 4 stars and not 5 stars is because, I had to use coconut oil to seal it so it would work 100%. Maybe John Frieda people will take notice to the fantastic healing power of coconut oil. Without the coconut oil, It did not work as well.</li>
    <li> Wow! Talk about easy way to repai hair! A def must buy, especially for the price.</li>
    <li> I have color treated hair and this stuff helps keep my hair soft and smooth! Just use as soon as you get out of the shower and style as usual, helps dull hair look a bit healthier. Buy this stuff often.</li>
    <li> I have been using this along side coconut oil for the past two weeks. Its really helped bring my hair back from a dry, severely damaged birds nest. I just wish the bottle was a bit bigger for the price.... It says to use only one or two squirts but I find I have to use at least 4 or 5, so its going to run out quite ckly. Otherwise it&#x27;d be 5 stars.</li>
    <li> Original and delivered on time.</li>
    <li> As always John Frieda products are the bomb! I love this product because it protects my hair from damage&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Five stars, this is a small bottle, but the formula is great for my hair and smells good. I would definitely buy more of it. It leaves hair smooth and shiny, but not too shiny. I use it on the ends of my hair to nourish split ends etc.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t heat style my long straight hair that often, but this product keeps my hair very soft, minimizes static, and helps a great deal with being to comb it out, even when it&#x27;s not fully dry. At no time do I feel any residue or greasiness.  I use about 6 pumps at a time, but the 1.7 ounce container has lasted me about 4 months.</li>
    <li> I am chronically ill and I have tried so many hair products lately for my sick, lifeless, falling out hair. These products have really made a difference and I think with continued use a huge difference! I highly recommend.</li>
    <li> This hasn&#x27;t helped with my bad split ends or damaged hair at all that I can tell.  I will not order this again.</li>
    <li> I have baby fine unprocessed hair that I lightly blow dry on warm daily. Because of my thin hair I get heat damage incredibly easily. Even a quick blow dry to my roots will leave my hair looking like straw and frizzing out. Couple that with my sensitive skin that breaks out with nearly every leave in product and you have a girl in need of some serious (yet light) moisture!&lt;br /&gt;This has made the back of my shoulders break out just a tiny bit but it&#x27;s manageable. However, as far as helping my ends not dry out and turn into straw.. it SORT OF helped? If I hadn&#x27;t gotten this on sale for $5 I probably would have given it one less star but for $5 it did a good enough job. I have shoulder length hair and one pump isn&#x27;t quite enough but two pumps is too much and weighs my hair down. This product is like oil - very thin and slippery! There&#x27;s no real way to get half a pump out. Even still after three days with Perfect Ends Deep Infusion I have to give the blow dryer a quit and wear my hair up with some Aveeno moisturizer in it to try and heal it up before the next heat wave.&lt;br /&gt;The search continues!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*(feel free to comment on my review if you have any suggestions on what I could try next! I&#x27;d really appreciate it!)</li>
    <li> I purchased this product because I&#x27;m trying to grow my hair long and luscious and my ends were starting to look pretty grody. This completely did the trick. I&#x27;ve used it only three times and my dried old ends are already well on their way to looking and feeling healthy. I use only one pump the distribute that all throughout my ends, then blowdry as usual. I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I recommend this product if your hair is hard to brush out after shower because of dying it excessively. I love it and use it everyday.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t do it for me. I was hopeful That it would be someting after reading other reviews. I have thin fine straight hair.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. It makes my hair feel soft and silky. It&#x27;s a really good price, and I use it almost everyday. It just makes my hair look a little healthier and sleeker. Plus it smells really really good. Nice and light and clean smelling.</li>
    <li> It made my hair so soft and wasn&#x27;t oily. I hated that my roots would be oily but my ends always be dry. This not only works great but it smells good too. I will definitely be purchasing more.</li>
    <li> The only thing that smooths my flyaways! They stopped selling in the stores so I have to get it from here.</li>
    <li> I use this every time I shampoo my hair and it has really made a difference on the ends.  There is less breakage and split ends.</li>
    <li> I love this product because the smell is good, my mom loves it so does my sister. Niice product to care ur hair</li>
    <li> My hair was dull and damaged. It became soft and manageable after just one use. Other people commented on the difference.</li>
    <li> great quality! Thanks</li>
    <li> The oil inside firstly squirts out all over the place - the dispenser is faulty somehow and rockets it out at such a speed that it splashes everywhere. Secondly, it just feels like it dries my ends rather than making them feel soft or supple or anything. I probably will not continue using this and will definitely not buy again. This is the first John Frieda product I&#x27;ve ever not liked! Sad.</li>
    <li> I have thick curly hair which is prone to split ends. This product did nothing for me</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried many many products for my fine hair. This one is one of the products I really like and it&#x27;s well worth the money.</li>
    <li> This is a great little bottle of hair health. I moved from Seattle to Los Angeles, and my hair has never been the same: dried out, slow-growing, limp hair. My fine, blonde hair doesn&#x27;t stand up to the dry desert heat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;John Frieda&#x27;s Perfect Ends Deep Infusion has helped to bring me my &#x27;Seattle&#x27; hair back: stronger, healthier, shinier. I get comments  on how nice my hair looks at least once a week now. Yay!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this in conjunction with a protein pack once a week, and also Biosilk Silk Therapy.</li>
    <li> this product does not weigh your hair down and does not give your hair a greasy feel....i highly recommend it for frizz control ....the oil in it is incredible.</li>
    <li> It is not the life saver most of the reviews I read prior to purchasing described IMO. I like it, it does a good job, but I guess my hair is just really thick enough that it takes quite a bit to see the difference. My hair is also pretty dry, so it doesn&#x27;t last that long. But compared to other products, it is worth it and does a better job than most others I have tried.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s like oil...But it makes my hair silkly!</li>
    <li> Having long hair that&#x27;s been bleached for years, I have amassed a collection of deep conditioners and leave-ins - none of which comes close to what this product does.  I&#x27;m usually a skeptic when it comes to product claims but this does everything it promises. Although it comes in a small size, a little goes a long way. It has a lightweight oil/liquid consistency that absorbs without residue and the smell is very light, pleasant, and high-end.  It instantly made my damaged hair look and feel soft, silky, and tangle-free all day without weighing it down! I am ecstatic that a product around $10 can achieve these results. I am very happy I found this and would recommend it to anyone with dry, damaged hair, or frizzy hair.  It works!</li>
    <li> This product does exactly as it says it will! I burned a portion of my hair with the straightener, tried several other products that didn&#x27;t work. After just two days of using this product my hair is soft again! I am amazed!</li>
    <li> I LOVE this product. I plan to use it the rest of my days! For the first time in YEARS I was able to style with a blow dryer alone, without having to use a straightener to tame frizzy ends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have fine/medium wavy/curly hair. Basically BLAH hair. Not enough curl to be cute, but too much to wear straight without heat styling every single day. This product cut my styling time in half! I used the John Frieda Full Repair shampoo and conditioner, ran a comb through my wet hair, applied one pump of this product to my hands and after rubbing my hands together to emulsify, simply smoothed it over the ends and rubbed it in gently. I could feel a difference immediately. Then, with jsut a curling brush and a blow dryer I was able to style my hair without a straightener! The Deep Insusion kept my ends silky and friz free with just a few swipes of the brush/dryer! Love it. I finished the style with a few brushes with the Flyaway tamer, and I look like I just left the salon!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d give this thing 10 stars if I could.</li>
    <li> I like it - it&#x27;s a bit light . . . I&#x27;m not sure exactly how effective it is, but it doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down which I also like . . .</li>
    <li> This is the best product! I have frizzy hair at my neckline. That weird undergrowth. I use it when my hair is wet or dry and it makes it smooth as silk without any greasy or heavy feeling. I don&#x27;t generally have much friz anywhere else but i use what is left on my hand as over the rest of my hair and it feels like silk!</li>
    <li> I torture my hair with a blow dryer, curling iron and sometimes a flat iron. This is the only product (and I&#x27;ve tried &#x27;em all) that actually helps repair my dry damaged ends.</li>
    <li> Great product!!! Always leaves my hair looking great!</li>
    <li> Before my wife began using this product, her ends were particularly brittle and her hair had a general roughness to it. However, since she has been using the Full Repair Perfect Ends, I have noticed a considerable change; her hair feels almost like silk and her ends have more of a sleek finish to them.</li>
    <li> I found out about this product on YouTube so decided to try it and could only find it on Amazon.com. It worked just like the video described. Thank you.</li>
    <li> This is a great product and I&#x27;m able to travel with it!</li>
    <li> This is the best ever. I had used redken allsoft but this is more affordable and i love it. I have thick shoulder length hair that is very unruly at times and looks frizzy after a blow dry because its so thick and this full repair keeps it smoothed down and so silky. I use all 3 products, the shampoo and conditioner and follow with the serum just before i blow dry. Ive tried so many products to find that silky smooth frizz free look and this one is the best out of all that i have tried and thats putting it up against redken and biosilk. I would highly recommend this product and i really really hope john friedas keeps this and doesnt change a thing to it. I hate when you find something that works and then they mess with the ingredients and change the name or completely discontinue it. So i hope they never do because really...this truely is the best for thick unruly hair!</li>
    <li> Love this full repair infusion! I have been using this along with the full repair shampoo &amp; conditioner and I have seen huge improvement in my crazy frizzy fine hair!</li>
    <li> pretty small bottle but much less expensive than wal-mart. works very well. smells amazing,</li>
    <li> Just found this product and then it was no longer available in stores. I am delighted to have found this one through this seller. I have naturally curly/wavy hair, and this is the most important product I use to keep my hair looking nice and natural.</li>
    <li> I was expecting something much better from reading all the reviews.  This stuff is as thin as water and it took me about 10 pumps to cover my thick hair.  As far as giving you softness goes... wow, I haven&#x27;t found anything better. But I don&#x27;t  just need softness, I need SHINE and health. I didn&#x27;t find this doing anything else except give my hair a soft feel once it was applied. I think for people with relatively normal hair, this would be a good option - I do not have normal hair though, I have very thick, coarse, unruly hair that needs something more.  UPDATE: I straightened my hair with this the other day, and even though it stated \\&quot;high heat protection,\\&quot; my ends were burned to a CRISP! I had listed this review at 2 stars but now I&#x27;m moving it down to 1. There is no excuse for this, now I have to go cut off more than an inch of my hair all because this product did not work as advertised! Use at your own risk!</li>
    <li> Love this product it makes hair beautiful</li>
    <li> This is great! Has a wonderful smell, not too oilyonly use one pump and pull through hair. I loved skiiny by pauk mitchell, but this works much better and not oily. It doesnt dry out my hair either. Ithink it works best if you are always using high heat on your hair.</li>
    <li> This product has really helped yame my frizzy hair. I love that my hair does not look greasy when I use this.</li>
    <li> this was TERRIBLE.  it was like it had been filled with tap water.  didn&#x27;t do one thing for my hair other than making it wetter.&lt;br /&gt;DO NOT BUY!</li>
    <li> I bought this because of the amazing reviews, but honestly I&#x27;m not very impressed. Following the directions (i.e. apply to the ends of damp hair), I didn&#x27;t see any change in my hair texture or moisture as it dried. I tried both blow-drying and air-drying, and combing and brushing, and nothing made a difference...still looked/felt exactly like it normally does, except the ends were more stringy/oily. Oh well.</li>
    <li> This John Frieda full Repair really works my ends were split pretty bad and were very dry I started using this daily and have noticed a huge difference .After I shampoo and Condition I towel dry my hair gently and start from the ends I use about 4 pumps of this into my hand and work my way up to the Roots just be careful how much you use at the roots to much could leave your hair oily it took me a few times to figure out how much I needed .I let my hair air dry and the results have been great no more split ends and this leaves my hair manageable with a nice healthy shine.This is my second bottle I wanted to have a back up.</li>
    <li> My hair felt like silk after using this!!! I put it on wet and it still dried kind of frizzy. I put some more on when my hair was barely damp. Once it completely dried I just wanted to run my fingers through it. I have long, thick hair. I also think it added some shine.</li>
    <li> A couple pumps on damp hair and you are done.  One bottle has lasted me 6 months. It has made such a difference with my hair.</li>
    <li> I have fine dark blonde hair that frizzes but gets weighed down easily. I like it to be smooth yet not flat or greasy. It&#x27;s hard to find the right combination. I have used Garnier Fructis sleek &amp; shine anti humidity smoothing milk for years. When I added this product -just one pump and my hair is smooth and full. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Came fast. Makes my hair feel great as well.</li>
    <li> I color my hair every 4 weeks to keep my stubborn grays at bay. In addition to those, My hair tends to be somewhat coarse, dry, with natural wave. I have mid length hair, so I actually do 2 pumps, mixed in with my Dove Curl Mousse, and applied to ends first, working my way to roots. It&#x27;s really made a difference with softness and shine, and the bottle seems to be lasting a long time. Will definitely repurchase!</li>
    <li> This is by far the best hair product I&#x27;ve ever used.  I wouldn&#x27;t say it repairs my hair, but it definitely makes it less noticeable.  It also makes my hair shiny and soft.  No frizz.</li>
    <li> From what I can tell the product is good. The way it came packaged however, doesn&#x27;t make me feel confident that the bottle I got is brand new. It didn&#x27;t come in a box, it came in a padded manilla envelope, and the pump on top of the bottle was taped so it couldn&#x27;t twist and unlock..</li>
    <li> it makes your hair really soft and it repairs your split ends and it adds shine to your hair i loved it</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been suffering with significant breakage for as long as I can remember and after three days of use I can actually get my fingers through with no snags.  My hair is belly button length and I find the one pump to be enough. My hair doesn&#x27;t even look like my own anymore! It&#x27;s super soft and shiny. I would absolutely recommend this product to any and every one.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing! Just a small amount and my hair goes from dry and frizzy to shiny and well behaved. Follow the directions though because in this case, more is not better. You&#x27;ll love what a difference it makes in your hair.</li>
    <li> Great for really really damaged hair.  I use the spray for using with a light/medium heat.  If you have really really damaged hair (mine is breaking off from chemicals and I regrowing it out now)... this will help you until you are able to grow out some of the damage!</li>
    <li> This stuff is strong, if you hair really fine hair you will only need a DROP. I bought this at a Dept. store on a whim, figured I&#x27;d give it a try- my hair was fried from bleach &amp; heat styling. The only &amp;#34;different&amp;#34; ingredient that is in THIS &amp; not in other similar serums is: INCA INCHI OIL , now I&#x27;ve never heard of it before but it works wonders on fried dry frazzled ends (or hair shaft!) ! I had not seen it in stores &amp; forgot exactly where I bought it, so I&#x27;m glad I found it on here! I&#x27;m not sure what I paid for it, so don&#x27;t know if this is a Deal  or not. But I seriously don&#x27;t even care! This is strong, yet light weight. It soaks INTO your hair instead of laying on it. It smooths out ends &amp; any dry areas, adds shine &amp; also is a Heat Protectant !  I am ordering 2bottles now, my hair is over processed &amp; I know I should cut it but I hate short hair! ;(  I also use hair extensions &amp; this is great for keeping them shiny &amp; hydrated! Also extensions need HEAT PROTECTION, so this will aid w/that as well. I highly recommend it if you have dry split ends. I wish I could just buy a big bottle of the &amp;#34;inca INCHI &amp;#34; oil , maybe I&#x27;ll look for it on here. Don&#x27;t know if it would perform the same without the other ingredients but hey, can&#x27;t hurt! Lol-  Dry ends, split ends, get some!.....  :) JR~</li>
