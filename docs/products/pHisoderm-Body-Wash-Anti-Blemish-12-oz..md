      <li>I love this product.  </li>
      <li>This product is great so far!</li>
      <li>Great for sensitive skin, ingrown hairs, or people who have acne breakouts in places all over their body.</li>
      <li>It is watery as one customer stated, but I like it better than the Neutrogena because it smells better (very light and not heavily scented) and is productive, unlike Neutrogena, which causes you to use a lot to get a nice lather.)</li>
      <li>And you don&#x27;t have to use a lot because it does come in a very wet liquidy form which is great!</li>
      <li>The product is easy to rinse out and to use.</li>
      <li>It was too strong and broke her out.</li>
      <li>This keeps you really clear and smells good too.  </li>
      <li>I was excited because I didnt know what product could reduce them</li>
      <li>The product had such good reviews that I ordered again, thinking that maybe they&#x27;ll send me a 12 oz this time and that, with time, my skin will start improving.</li>
      <li>Works good used to control my breakouts on my skin, especially my back.</li>
      <li>Purchased this product to get my skin back to a good PH level.  </li>
      <li>As it smells good and light and my back is clearing up fast!</li>
      <li>he has oily skin, it has helped tremendously.  </li>
      <li>But anyways, I love this product so far!!</li>
      <li>i didn&#x27;t quite notice any difference in the blemish problem, BUT i love how glowing and soft my skin looks and feels after using it.</li>
      <li>Some people may have success with this</li>
      <li>and it was worth a shot.</li>
      <li>Good product, I gave three star due to seller posted incorrect size...</li>
      <li>I thought the price was right</li>
      <li>The soap doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin which I was worried it would, and it also smells nice for being a medicinal product.</li>
      <li>This one is clear and with a perfume smell to it, which is fine.  </li>
      <li>So stay away from putting lotion on your back if you think you are more prone to getting pimples that way.</li>
      <li>Tips: Don&#x27;t scrub your back as it will irritate your skin and cause more pimples.</li>
      <li>(I love back massages).</li>
      <li>It actually has a much better smell than Neutrogena, so I like that part a lot.</li>
      <li>It is more liquid-y than other bodywashes, but makes a great lather with a very little bit of product if you use loofah.</li>
      <li>but that hasn&#x27;t been strong enough</li>
      <li>It works really well for keeping the skin on your body super clear.</li>
      <li>This product really didn&#x27;t do much for my acne, but it kept my skin hydrated.&lt;br</li>
      <li>My baby girl has eczema to the point where she scratches so much, it looks like cuts on her skin.</li>
      <li>I really like this bodywash.</li>
      <li>Why is this product only available online and not in stores?  </li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t really see much difference in my skin.</li>
      <li>The wash is very foamy</li>
      <li>far Phisoderm Anti-Blemish Body Wash has rid my back and chest of most of its acne.</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t see the sellers note on the original order, only on the review of the product.</li>
      <li>Maybe other people will have more luck.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll have to wait a little longer to see if this product completely clears my skin like Neutrogena, but so far it looks good.</li>
      <li>Decent body wash.</li>
      <li>I highly recommed this product.</li>
      <li>but I didn&#x27;t like the price so after doing a little more research</li>
      <li>Within the first week of using it, it really made a drastic difference in clearing up my husband&#x27;s probelem area: his back.</li>
      <li>But it did not prevent new blemishes from appearing.</li>
      <li>I only know that I have not found very much product</li>
      <li>You do feel clean, but then again so does any other soap.</li>
      <li>It cleans the scalp blemishes and does not dry out the hair too much.</li>
      <li>I have very sensitive skin, so I am surprised that I can use it at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m less than pleased to pay regular price for 10oz bottle when I thought I was paying for a 12oz bottle.</li>
      <li>And washes off clear, leaving no residue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>And I also don&#x27;t use lotion on my back because I tend to get pimples much much easier that way.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m a 31 year old man.</li>
      <li>/&gt;This is only 1 of 2 products that has really helped me to keep the blemishes, itching, rashes and comedons at bay.</li>
      <li>Eight bucks isn&#x27;t much of sacrifice, especially if you find something that clears up acne and hydrates your skin simultaneously.</li>
      <li>I used to use the old pHisoderm and had to search online to find this.  </li>
      <li>Phisoderm helped heal the blemishes I had,  by encouraging old skin cells to slough off.</li>
      <li>This product surprised me</li>
      <li>I give it two stars because it smells nice and isn&#x27;t that expensive to really piss me off.</li>
      <li>Worth every penny I spent.</li>
      <li>I have naturally rough, dry skin that gets inflamed easily.</li>
      <li>major drug chain offers this item online, however not in their stores.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a little pricey, but to me it&#x27;s totally worth it.</li>
      <li>It does dry the skin a little, which is probably from the salicylic acid, but that&#x27;s fine with me, because it&#x27;s drying the wounds as well.</li>
      <li>I never knew it was possible to have a back that was completely clear of (b)acne until I found this stuff!!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s different from the old, white creamy looking liquid soap.  </li>
      <li>The body wash does not dry out my skin which was one of the things I was worried about.</li>
      <li>Generally I would buy Neutrogena, but I felt like trying something different.</li>
      <li>and we used this product in the past for this problem and found it helped him very much.  </li>

<li> I normally have small amounts of acne during Fall and winter that I can handle by using my facial acne cream.</li>
<li> The moisturizing soap didn&#x27;t help with the deep scratches healing, so I tried Neutrogena because of the active ingredient that would help dry out acne, hoping it would do the same for the the \\&quot;cuts\\&quot;.</li>
<li> Hope other people don&#x27;t have the same reaction to this as i did.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Years ago, my daughter&#x27;s pediatrician recommended we use pHisoderm on her. Now I need to use after swimming in the ocean.  The only place i could find it was Amazon.  Thank you Amazon.</li>
    <li> I ordered this body wash hoping that it would reduce the amount of breakouts I get on my back &amp; chest.  I&#x27;m a bartender so I sweat quite a bit and that tends to cause me some breakouts.  I got this body wash about 2 weeks ago, maybe less, and I&#x27;m all clear!  I love it!!</li>
    <li> Sometimes I get stress breakouts, so I needed a body wash that would help alleviate the problem. Generally I would buy Neutrogena, but I felt like trying something different. I&#x27;ve been using this for about four or five days now and it seems to be working for me. It actually has a much better smell than Neutrogena, so I like that part a lot. I&#x27;ll have to wait a little longer to see if this product completely clears my skin like Neutrogena, but so far it looks good.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for a few weeks; really dosen&#x27;t work well for me.  Seller was great!!</li>
    <li> This did not work for me and took forever to get to my house. Maybe other people will have more luck.</li>
    <li> Purchased and used with twice a day in the shower and saw no result! I have since then started using Pro-Active body wash and it&#x27;s cleaning up my skin nicely!</li>
    <li> I dont think my skin has ever felt this good.  I love this product.  My skin is clearer and softer than ever!  I would give it six stars if I could.</li>
    <li> I suffer from Folliculitis so my doctor recommended I give pHisoderm a try. My doctor told me to wash with it once a week but that hasn&#x27;t been strong enough so I have been washing with pHisoderm every day. The soap doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin which I was worried it would, and it also smells nice for being a medicinal product. It is a little runnier than regular shampoo but that doesn&#x27;t bother me any; a small amount goes a long ways. I did recently get an abscess so I don&#x27;t know just how effective the soap is for my Folliculitis ... it has helped, but I may need to go to the doctor again for further treatment. I think if you have a milder case of Folliculitis, or want to use pHisoderm for acne, then one of the best bets is to wash with pHisoderm!</li>
    <li> Average in effectiveness.  Phisoderm helped heal the blemishes I had,  by encouraging old skin cells to slough off. But it did not prevent new blemishes from appearing.</li>
    <li> I really like this bodywash. It works really well for keeping the skin on your body super clear. I&#x27;ve never had any issues with the skin on my face staying clear, but my chest or upper back would have a blemish or two and drive me crazy. This keeps you really clear and smells good too.  It is more liquid-y than other bodywashes, but makes a great lather with a very little bit of product if you use loofah.</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B004GF2AOE Phisoderm Anti-blemish Body Wash, 12-ounce Bottles (Pack of 6)]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Phisoderm product helps a lot with scalp rosacea. It cleans the scalp blemishes and does not dry out the hair too much. The product is easy to rinse out and to use. I have very sensitive skin, so I am surprised that I can use it at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this in conjunction with DHS Zinc shampoo. I switch shampoos every other day. I have found this product quite helpful and there is also very little scent to the shampoo, which I also like. There is no oily residue left behind or any dryness, it just cleans really well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am not sure if it is recommended by physicians for scalp rosacea? I only know that I have not found very much product which is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is only 1 of 2 products that has really helped me to keep the blemishes, itching, rashes and comedons at bay. Otherwise, the rosacea issues quickly become an itchy, scaling, bloody, irritating mess.</li>
    <li> Background: My baby girl has eczema to the point where she scratches so much, it looks like cuts on her skin. I was told by her dermatologist to bathe her with a moisturizing soap and use a moisturizing cream following her bath. (Along with the usual eczema routine of no scented soaps, bubbles, detergent, etc.) The moisturizing soap didn&#x27;t help with the deep scratches healing, so I tried Neutrogena because of the active ingredient that would help dry out acne, hoping it would do the same for the the \\&quot;cuts\\&quot;. It was too strong and broke her out. (Her skin produced tiny, red, itchy bumps all over her body.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enter pHisoderm: It is watery as one customer stated, but I like it better than the Neutrogena because it smells better (very light and not heavily scented) and is productive, unlike Neutrogena, which causes you to use a lot to get a nice lather.) It does dry the skin a little, which is probably from the salicylic acid, but that&#x27;s fine with me, because it&#x27;s drying the wounds as well. I also like that it has aloe vera, vitamin E, and chamomile, which also is supposed to help with dry, eczema-skin. Using this followed by a moisturizing cream has helped her skin a lot.</li>
    <li> This lap had a Medical-hospital type odor. You do feel clean, but then again so does any other soap. No big difference in skin look.</li>
    <li> I brought it for my husband he has oily skin, it has helped tremendously.  I&#x27;m using it also for my face and it is great.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s an awsome product. it works for me. it&#x27;s take away the blemishes from my face and body. i&#x27;m happy with this product and willl buy again.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t make a difference - again, might be my skin.</li>
    <li> The ones I use to buy were 12 oz.  I have not opened this one yet.  I use to buy mine at Rite Aid but they discontinued it.  It was really hard to find.</li>
    <li> This product is great so far! As it smells good and light and my back is clearing up fast! And you don&#x27;t have to use a lot because it does come in a very wet liquidy form which is great! :) Tips: Don&#x27;t scrub your back as it will irritate your skin and cause more pimples. And I also don&#x27;t use lotion on my back because I tend to get pimples much much easier that way. If your skin on your back gets too dry for you, then lay off the wash as it has Salicylic Acid in it (Treats your acne). So stay away from putting lotion on your back if you think you are more prone to getting pimples that way. Also! Do not touch your back with your fingers and pick your pimples as that makes matters worse for you. But anyways, I love this product so far!! Hope I helped and thank you! :)</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s summer and you know what that means. Back and chest acne. I normally have small amounts of acne during Fall and winter that I can handle by using my facial acne cream. But during the summer, it&#x27;s a different story.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far Phisoderm Anti-Blemish Body Wash has rid my back and chest of most of its acne. Even my husband has noticed a difference when he&#x27;s rubbing my back (I love back massages). He says that my back is less bumpy. The body wash does not dry out my skin which was one of the things I was worried about. There&#x27;s no peeling like you get with the face acne medicine. I started off using it everyday and now use it every other day. The wash is very foamy so you don&#x27;t need to a lot. I pour a quarter size on my loofah and it suds up nicely. And washes off clear, leaving no residue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can now wear my cute v-neck cut tops because I no longer worry about my chest being riddled with red, ugly bumps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will definitely continue to use this project in the future.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4/5</li>
    <li> i didn&#x27;t quite notice any difference in the blemish problem, BUT i love how glowing and soft my skin looks and feels after using it. The smell is great, so as a shower wash i will keep using it.</li>
    <li> I used to use the old pHisoderm and had to search online to find this.  It&#x27;s different from the old, white creamy looking liquid soap.  This one is clear and with a perfume smell to it, which is fine.  I used it and immediately the skin on my face and neck felt smoother and little bumps cleared up.&lt;br /&gt;One major drug chain offers this item online, however not in their stores.  Why is this product only available online and not in stores?  (With such a small item the shipping charges double the price.)</li>
    <li> Stuff works great - Has helped me not to get skin infection</li>
    <li> I looked at myself after a week and my stretch marks have diminished great ! I was excited because I didnt know what product could reduce them so I took a chance!</li>
    <li> I have tried so many products for the bumps on my arms and nothing worked.  This product surprised me I noticed a lot less itching within three days.  As I continue using the product my bumps are starting to diminish. I will re-order this product.  The shipping for Prime or Shop Runner would be nice.</li>
    <li> Decent body wash. Good for the acne-prone skin.</li>
    <li> This item appears nothing like it used to be.  The cleanser is thin and not very lathery.  I will not be buying this again.  I think I will stick with Neutragena or Dial antibacterial soap.</li>
    <li> I have been using this body wash for two months and have been breaking out 10 times worse than before! Some people may have success with this but i have now had to go to a dermatologist to fix this. Hope other people don&#x27;t have the same reaction to this as i did.</li>
    <li> Purchased this product to get my skin back to a good PH level.  It&#x27;s a nice product, smells good but did not meet my expectations. With that being said, it may work for other people.</li>
    <li> Works good used to control my breakouts on my skin, especially my back.</li>
    <li> LOVE IT!!! On time and works great!! Very happy with my purchase and when i run out i will buy more from this company</li>
    <li> I will continue buying this product in the future and recommend to others who need help with their skin as well..</li>
    <li> Cleared my back and shoulders up after a week of using! Don&#x27;t know what happened but now it doesn&#x27;t work at all. Oh well, on to the next product.</li>
    <li> I actually bought this product hoping it would help my tinea versicolor but I didn&#x27;t see any results so I will keep looking for a product that works.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! I&#x27;m a 31 year old man. I work as an industrial/commercial electrician so I sweat a lot and occasionally get some body blemish outbreaks. I was looking to try proactiv but I didn&#x27;t like the price so after doing a little more research I found pHisoderm body wash. I thought the price was right and it was worth a shot. I was suprised how well it worked. It got rid of the smaller blemishes in a few days and the bigger ones in a week or 2. The body wash smells refreshing and I think it&#x27;s good for a man or a woman.</li>
    <li> I have naturally rough, dry skin that gets inflamed easily. A lot of acne cleansers/scrub only aggrivate this and I usually wind up with worse skin after I started. This product really didn&#x27;t do much for my acne, but it kept my skin hydrated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said, I would give it try and see if this works any better for yourself. Eight bucks isn&#x27;t much of sacrifice, especially if you find something that clears up acne and hydrates your skin simultaneously.</li>
    <li> This product, for me at least doesn&#x27;t work at all. I didnt feel anything as i used it as I would compared to other acne body washes (almost like menthol). It is also so watery and easily wasted of not careful.</li>
    <li> Cleans well, clears well</li>
    <li> Great for sensitive skin, ingrown hairs, or people who have acne breakouts in places all over their body.</li>
    <li> I never knew it was possible to have a back that was completely clear of (b)acne until I found this stuff!! It&#x27;s a little pricey, but to me it&#x27;s totally worth it. It&#x27;s crazy how well this stuff worked. Worth every penny I spent. Recommended!</li>
    <li> Within the first week of using it, it really made a drastic difference in clearing up my husband&#x27;s probelem area: his back.</li>
    <li> Good product, I gave three star due to seller posted incorrect size...</li>
    <li> Bought this product (12 oz pHisoderm) and got a 10 oz bottle instead. I didn&#x27;t really see much difference in my skin. The product had such good reviews that I ordered again, thinking that maybe they&#x27;ll send me a 12 oz this time and that, with time, my skin will start improving. But I got a 10 oz bottle AGAIN. And then no change in skin. I tried to call customer service but got put on hold several times until I just gave up. I give it two stars because it smells nice and isn&#x27;t that expensive to really piss me off. I&#x27;m not gonna fight this company for a stolen $15. But I won&#x27;t be making another purchase.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m less than pleased to pay regular price for 10oz bottle when I thought I was paying for a 12oz bottle. I didn&#x27;t see the sellers note on the original order, only on the review of the product.</li>
    <li> My husband suffers from folliculitis and his is the only thing that actually helps the symptoms. I highly recommed this product.</li>
    <li> My daughter uses it religiously and it continues to work well for her.  I always ensure we have a good supply of this...nothing else works for her.</li>
    <li> I have looked for this product for the past 3 years and just decided to look it up on the net.  Amazon was the only place the sold it so  I ordered it from you.  This product was bought for my wheelchair bound son.  He has problems with his back and we used this product in the past for this problem and found it helped him very much.  I am happy that amazon had it available and were able to get it sent out so quickly.  We hope to get my son&#x27;s back cleared up with phisoderm body wash once again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank You</li>
