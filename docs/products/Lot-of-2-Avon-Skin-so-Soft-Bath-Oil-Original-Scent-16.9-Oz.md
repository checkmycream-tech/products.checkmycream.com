    <li> Leave skin feeling soft, very soft!</li>
    <li> I know it&#x27;s not advertised to do so, but I&#x27;ve been using this for years to keep away bugs during the summer months.  I live in a very rural area, and am allergic to mayflys.  I put this on after I shower in the AM and don&#x27;t rinse it off.  Keeps my skin moisturized and the bugs away!</li>
    <li> Love it great price will be using it everyday</li>

    <li> I loved this product!!  I used it as a first step repellant against mosquito/bug bites during my two week mission trip to Tamale, Ghana, Africa.  I also used Off! repellant around my ankles and arms.  After long days in the villages, I would shower and add the Skin So Soft without applying Off! repellant.  I was never bitten!  Funny thing, I returned home yesterday around 5 PM.  It took 2 days travel to get back home.  Within two hours of being home and no Skin So Soft, I was bitten by a mosquito :(.  I&#x27;ll now be using this product in North Carolina!!</li>
    <li> It does seem to repel mosquitoes and ticks, but it just smells too strongly.  If it&#x27;s not the perfume keeping the bugs away I wish they would cut back on the fragrance. That way it could be a more healthy bug spray.</li>
    <li> Used for years. Great product.</li>
    <li> Product is as advertised.  This is the real product from Avon at a very good price.  I love the scent.</li>

    <li> Great keeping the mosquitoes at bay.</li>
    <li> I use this all the time, both in the bath water and as a body oil,&lt;br /&gt;to ward away insects and bees. Not sure why they hate the&lt;br /&gt;smell, I love it and it works better that the stinky ones.</li>
    <li> I love this product..it smells great. This product was a great asset while on active duty in south west asia...It served as a great insect repellent</li>
    <li> These arrived on time for Christmas and lit up my grandmother&#x27;s face. She kept talking about needing more Skin-So-Soft oil, and thankfully didn&#x27;t contact an Avon rep before I had a chance to surprise her. Thank you!!</li>
    <li> I use it as an insect repellent.Very gentle &amp; effective.</li>
    <li> I started using this product as a teenager for the sole purpose of a bath oil.  Who would have figured that thirty years later I&#x27;d still be using it, only this time for a bug repellent!  Works wonderfully for both purposes.</li>
    <li> I live in South Florida and no matter what I do, flies attack my horses nonstop.  I have tried almost every mix of fly sprays out there, and nothing seems to work.  I decided to go with the Skin-So-Soft + vinegar + water mix, and WOW the flies completely stopped bothering my thin-skinned Thoroughbred who has been getting eaten alive this summer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;LOVE this product!</li>
