    <li> I used them to make a scented bath salts.  They worked wonderfully</li>
    <li> I also mix it with epsom salts to encourage a healthier product. The only issue I have with this product is that I am constantly finding stones in the salts. THEY SAY it&#x27;s sorted by hand here in the USA, while that may be true, their quality control leaves a little to be desired. Other than that. Very nice.</li>
