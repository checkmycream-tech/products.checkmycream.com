<li> The mini flat iron was already browning in color from usage.</li>
<li> /&gt;The one we received LOOKS like a Royale flat iron</li>
<li> I have really curly hair and CHI sucks on this hair</li>
<li> Now for other news, Apparently, only &amp;#34;certain&amp;#34; companies that are contracted with &amp;#34;Royale&amp;#34; can sell their products and all the people here on Amazon are either in violation of that contract, selling stolen and or substandard merchandise or do not even have a contract with Royale</li>
<li> It was not new.</li>
<li> hers worked on my daughters hair with one swipe down each strand.</li>
<li> Even after 3-4 swipes down a strand</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve been using this straightener for a little while now</li>
<li> Also the five year warranty is not available if you buy it from an unauthorized source.</li>
<li> Waste of money</li>
<li> Garbage don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
<li> I thought that it was used because my box was broken, but who gives a crap about the box as long as the inside is what works, right?</li>
<li> shes usually a chi girl ..</li>
<li> bod it here for less than 85€ !!</li>
<li> ** set and its broken</li>
<li> im not impressed.</li>
<li> At florida mall you can buy, but is so expensive...</li>
<li> Unfortunately I let someone borrow them who never returned tbem</li>
<li> Forget the stupid chi, it will damage your hair.</li>
<li> Very disappointed.</li>

    <li> Why spend $100+ per peice? Or $200+ for the set at the mall?!  This set includes the dvd demo, two professional hair clips, basic heat resistant glove, plus the regular and mini flat irons, and the curler!</li>
    <li> These are the best  curlers I have ever had. Plan to buy more as christmas gifts for all the women in my family.</li>
    <li> Excelent product. O recomend it. My wife enjoy so much. At florida mall you can buy, but is so expensive...</li>
    <li> It was not new. The mini flat iron was already browning in color from usage. It does not reach the temperatures that it should. I owned a set of these before and they were awesome. I bought them at a kiosk in the Florida mall. Unfortunately I let someone borrow them who never returned tbem and I thought this was a awesome price seeing as I paid $225 for the original set and this one was only $89. Garbage don&#x27;t waste your money. Also the five year warranty is not available if you buy it from an unauthorized source.</li>
    <li> Kit is awesome my girl loves it but the mini straightener is starting to separate so it looks like I got a s***** set and its broken and I don&#x27;t even know the policy on returns or exchanges</li>
    <li> the  curler works well. the straightener im not impressed. hair does not stay straight. has to keep heating up. feels static. the straightener get hot to hold.</li>
    <li> Arrived in new packaging. Everything works great, just like at the mall kiosk. My daughters and I love the product.</li>
    <li> My daughter loves it! They are easy to handle. Heats up quickly and does a wonderful job of straightening and curling!</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my daughter as a birthday present. We were approached by someone in the mall who was selling these flat irons and hers worked on my daughters hair with one swipe down each strand. It worked beautifully! I just wasn&#x27;t going to pay the incredibly jacked up mall kiosk price.&lt;br /&gt;The one we received LOOKS like a Royale flat iron but sure doesn&#x27;t straighten like one. Even after 3-4 swipes down a strand it is still wavy (no longer curly) but very wavy and frizzy. Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> it was a christmas gift for my daugher and she loved it! shes usually a chi girl .. so this is a great product</li>
    <li> As for the quality, it works good, not a 10 but definitely a strong 7 or 8. Now for other news, Apparently, only &amp;#34;certain&amp;#34; companies that are contracted with &amp;#34;Royale&amp;#34; can sell their products and all the people here on Amazon are either in violation of that contract, selling stolen and or substandard merchandise or do not even have a contract with Royale so any item purchased on here will not receive a warranty from Royale. Ebay and now Amazon are on the list of places that they will not honor the warranty!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased this as a Christmas gift and was mortified to find out that the warranty may not be honored after the person receiving the gift had tried to register it for the 1yr warranty listed on the box at the Royale website! I prayed and decided to try and register the kit  myself. About a week later, I received a call from Royale headquarters in Tampa, FL and they asked where I purchased it and I told them and they were very gracious to me. They decided to give me a 5yr warranty (as listed on their website) and not only that, they gave me a coupon code for 70% off my next purchase from their website that I used to purchase another gift! Thank you Lord for answering my prayers,  and thank you Royale, whew!</li>
    <li> i have wanted one of these for a while but could not justify spending the money.  i got a great deal on amazon with free shipping with prime.  i travel to area&#x27;s with 220v and 110v.  this was the only one i could find that was dual voltage.  i could not say enough about this. make may hair straight and soft.  love it</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this straightener for a little while now and I love it! I use it everytime i get out of the shower and it works great. Please with the product :]</li>
    <li> it was a great product and works amazingly !</li>
    <li> I have used this one time so far and it  works just like the ones in the mall. The box was completely sealed CD was new straighteners and curling wand were clean and unused.i went back and fourth on ordering or not. I had my card ready to pay $250 for a solid color one from Royale website. Finally hubby and my sister said just do it if it doesn&#x27;t work complain and report selling. So I took the leap and paid $61 for product and shipping. It arrived I looked over this sucker with a fine tooth comb looking for anything misspelled words cracked played used marks. Anything to show it was junk. Happy to say NOT junk totally tHe REAL deal and in LOVE!!  It leaves your hair soft silly and smooth!! I have really curly hair and CHI sucks on this hair but Riyale is the only one that works wonders!! Totally work the money and leap of faith!! You will be very happy!</li>
    <li> I have been using it for quite some time and it&#x27;s been great. It does not burn my hair like others did.</li>
    <li> This products works totally different in the mall at their booths however, when you get this product home, it is not the same quality at all. It heats up really fast but the quality is not the same. This flat iron works no different from the others sold in beauty supply stores fo 9.99. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend that you buy it unless you just want a flat iron that will straighten your hair lightly. If you are trying to really get a salon look, you might want to explore a better product than Royale,</li>
    <li> Works great on really curly hair. Best flat iron ever!!! Product broke after 3 months of use but was able to take it apart and fix loose wire.</li>
    <li> I was in Germany for xmas shopping and this product was sell there for 220€ !!&lt;br /&gt;I bod it here for less than 85€ !!</li>
    <li> doesn&#x27;t get super hot</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not the real deal ceramic; it only has the name brand.  My daughter used it once and it did not work. Waste of money</li>
    <li> I thought that it was used because my box was broken, but who gives a crap about the box as long as the inside is what works, right? I used to work at a kiosk doing hair with royale straightners and wands.. Let me just tell you all, THEY ARE BEYOND WORTH IT an ESPECIALLY being so damn cheap. We sold ours for an arm and a leg so $53 for a KIT?! This seller was amazing for that. Forget the stupid chi, it will damage your hair. Royale is by far the best. Your hair will look and feel amazing!! And if you don&#x27;t wash your hair everyday, straightening or curling will last for atleast 4 straight days. And no, your hair won&#x27;t frizz with these straighteners. BUY IT! Don&#x27;t questions it at all, take this from someone who did hair and mastered the facts and quality of the straightener/wand. :)</li>
