    <li> Our local Body Shop store closed and I was missing using this product. Was so glad to find&lt;br /&gt;it online. It is the best for my sensitive skin here in PA in the winter when my skin dries out&lt;br /&gt;with hot air furnace running all the time. It is a great moisturizer that doesn&#x27;t feel heavy on the skin.</li>
    <li> I love this brand. It&#x27;s affordable and works great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I always clean my face before going to bed, then I apply this cream as my night cream.

    <li> I&#x27;ve been searching for a cheaper replacement for Hope in a Jar by Philosophy and I&#x27;ve finally found it!!! I am amazed at how great my skin looks- no more blotchy dry patches. This moisturizer is better than most of the high-end (and high-priced) stuff.</li>
    <li> I love this face cream.  Only one I use now  Delivery was fast too.&lt;br /&gt;My daughter let me try hers , so I liked it so much I ordered my own.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for years. It lasts me quite long as well. For about a year or so, as I use it as a base before i put on my makeup, or sometimes just to moisturize. Only a little bit is needed. I got this product within a week and I live in the Caribbean, so I was really pleased. The packaging was fine and the cream itself seemed to be in perfect condition. Will buy again when I need to re-stock.</li>
    <li> Perfect hydrating cream for dry winter days. Love it!</li>
    <li> I have very dry skin that is also sensitive and this moisturizer works well for me.  It does not irritate my skin or give me a rash and keeps my face from getting that horrible tight feeling.  No breakouts from this cream either.  The only thing I do not like about the moisturizer is the strong perfume scent, but I am sensitive to scents so this may not be an issue for others.</li>

    <li> I am a die hard body shop fan. I am using this cream since last two years. My skin is excessively dry and sensitive. Two years back when I realised I am getting allergic to almost any thing I apply on my face,  I visited dermatologists, tried using herbal medicines.. But all in vain.. And then my husband suggested me to try body shop and pheeeww.. All problems solved.</li>
    <li> In my younger days I would use vitamin E on my face all the time; back then I would take a vitamin e gel cap &amp; squeeze out the liquid. This is, in one word  AWESOME - they&#x27;re not kidding when that say it&#x27;s an INTENSE MOISTURIZER....It&#x27;s creamy &amp; luscious and my skin soaks it up!  I stopped using all the high priced &amp;#34;wrinkle&amp;#34; creams and lotions I bath in and have been using this along with the Vitamin E Sink-In Moisture mask for 10 days now &amp; I am AMAZED AND THRILLED at the results.  We can&#x27;t actually turn back time but I sure in heck can look like I have ...</li>
    <li> I purchased this after someone gave me a sample. It&#x27;s a really rich moisturizer and I will order again for my very dry skin.</li>
    <li> over 50 and have dry skin issues and live an outdoor life in a sunny clime, hard to find a moisturizer that lasts and actually soothes my skin, this Body Shop moisturizer fits the bill! I have tried beauty counter products, but who can afford those anymore??? This is a great price for an exceptionally good product!</li>
    <li> The side of my nose was really dry and it&#x27;s been a long time that i&#x27;am  looking for moisturizer and i found this in amazon. I tried it and it helps a lot. It lessens the dryness on my nose. I will continuously use this.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know if it was because the weather was hot, but the cream was sorta melted when I got it.&lt;br /&gt;When I bought it at the store, it was very creamy, but this one felt like it was old.&lt;br /&gt;But it could just be me, and the shipping was super fast, so I give it a 3.

    <li> This is the best facial moisturizer I have found - use it every day and especially during long tough New England winters where dry skin is really a battle.  Expensive but it really works at fixing dryness!  Feels great!</li>
    <li> My wife loves this product</li>
    <li> Great moisturizer for my turning 40 skin and my Mom&#x27;s over 70 skin. We love it&#x27;s rich yet light texture because it has a slight rose-y scent that evaporates and doesn&#x27;t make us itch. It doesn&#x27;t have any sunscreens in it that make me break-out.</li>
    <li> bought it several times!</li>
    <li> I love this moisturizer it makes my skin feel so soft and not so dry for a 70 year old lady.</li>
