      <li>If you have super sore muscles, Epsom salt helps, but it isn&#x27;t an end</li>

      <li>and you know that it is pure.</li>
      <li>It is also certainly cheaper than any store bought products.</li>
      <li>Good product, I am lazy and buying it on Amazon is worth paying a little more to me.</li>
      <li>Many other uses I wasn&#x27;t aware of.</li>
      <li>(For a mild laxative, I put 1 Tsp in 4 ozs of freshly pressed apple juice or freshly juiced apple juice as it severely curbs the bitter taste.</li>
      <li>will buy again, very high quality</li>
      <li>Very convenient packaging, milk-carton-like, to shake out the amount I wanted to use.</li>
      <li>and it really helps my legs.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> great products but over priced</li>
    <li> I love prime shipping. The Epsom salt baths are helping soothe our son&#x27;s eczema. We&#x27;ve already seen much improvement and look forward to seeing continued improvement for his skin.</li>
    <li> THE PRODUCT IS FINE  IT  WORKS AS GOOD AS YOU CAN BUY IN ANY  DEPARTMENT STORE OR IN CVS OR ANY PHARMACY</li>
    <li> Used this for my DIY scented candle thing at home. I don&#x27;t have to use a lot of this, which is great.</li>
    <li> UPDATE: Since I published my review a day or two ago, this product has gone up in price again. I love Amazon because you CAN find good deals - especially if you have Prime and order a lot. But do yourself and your wallet a favor. Go to Walmart for this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;--------**--------**--------**--------**--------**---------&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a very good product and is able to be ingested as a laxative as well as the bath. (For a mild laxative, I put 1 Tsp in 4 ozs of freshly pressed apple juice or freshly juiced apple juice as it severely curbs the bitter taste. Use whatever juice works for you.) It works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My one-star rating is for the cost of this product on Amazon. I found it at Walmart in one-pound cartons for a whopping 0.88 cents. For $2.64 I can buy three one-pound cartons and keep the change. If you go to Walmart to get it, you should find it located with the hydrogen peroxide, etc...</li>
    <li> not much to say about epsom salt really. love the product, no issue with broken boxes.</li>
    <li> The Epsom salt crystals are larger than I prefer. There were several large chunks, but they were easily broken apart. That being said, I liked how well they mixed with other ingredients to make bath salts. They helped a lot with the soreness in my leg muscles.</li>
    <li> use every time I take a jet bath, about three times a week, feels very good on skin and on muscles</li>
    <li> Love Epsom Salt, for so many reasons.  Great brand, great price.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know much about Epsom salt but I was told to use it for pain from my Lyme.  It does feel nice taking a hot bath.  It was a great price for the cost and with my Prime account I had free two day shipping.</li>
    <li> Then again, thats not really why you&#x27;re buying this. You&#x27;re buying this because of theraputic benefits. It works as advertized. Wouldnt put it on food, or on your icy driveway, but if you&#x27;re feeling achy its a great choice.</li>
    <li> These came with the carton sealed in plastic as well so unless damaged, there was no chance of it getting damp in storage or transit.  Then, once here, they don&#x27;t last long enough for that to be a problem, but if you only use them seldom you might not want to store the carton in a humid bathroom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We did, and they stayed nice for about a month before we&#x27;d used them up.</li>
    <li> I used this today for a detox bath and pain relief soak. It did not help my pain, but it did help detox. I did not measure myself before and after, but I did notice a detoxing affect. I especially learned not to eat crappy foods after a detox bath because it will make your body feel sick.&lt;br /&gt;I took off one star because it didn&#x27;t help with my pain. However, it&#x27;s chronic foot pain from bunions and upper back pain from stress. I think it works better for muscle pain.</li>
    <li> Medicinal salt works good I am satisfied with purchase will buy again, very high quality no added weird stink just salt in a box.</li>
    <li> Good product, I am lazy and buying it on Amazon is worth paying a little more to me.</li>
    <li> This product is ok. I prefer the bigger salts that can be found in health food stores, mostly because its more aesthetically pleasing. This did the job though</li>
    <li> Good product and value!  Love this in the bath, to soak feet etc.  Much more cost effective than what is sold in local stores.  I mix this with a scented product as those are generally overwhelming to me.  With this unscented product I can get the amount of scent perfectly balanced.</li>
    <li> Great product- was very happy with it until I got the same amount of epsom salt for $2.98 at Wal-Mart.</li>
    <li> I bought this product to make homemade bath bombs and scented bath salts. Works great. I have also just poured a cup into my hot bath after a good workout at the gym to ease my achy muscles! Would recommend to all.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great! I felt fantastic and slept like a baby that night. Be careful if you have serious digestive issues though cause this will make you very &amp;#34;regular.&amp;#34; Haha!</li>
    <li> perfect to use alone or mix with sents and give as a gift</li>
    <li> I loved this product.  I have very bad arthritis and by soaking in the bath with the salts for thirty minutes made the pain so much more manageable</li>
    <li> I use this in my garden to help the plants grow strong root systems and it also helps the plant to absorb all the nutrients they need.  Just 1/2 cup to a gallon of water, or you can broadcast it over the garden before a good soaking rain.</li>
    <li> I used this to make bath salts for my friends for Christmas. I do have some friends sensitive to smells, and what I really liked about this is that it did not smell.</li>
    <li> Epsom salt is a staple of my bath-time supplies. Easy-to-use, cheap, and leaves you feeling soothed and refreshed. Typically I&#x27;ll only use about 3/4 of a cup per bath, but your mileage may vary. Epsom salts are also a great addition for making your very own Lush-style fizzing bath balls.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the White Mountain product because the milk box design is much easier to pour than other brands, while still being affordable. The carton also does a good job of keeping moisture out (which is important when it is stored in a humid bathroom).</li>
    <li> This was not as nice as some of the ones that have great smells mixed with them! I add some of this with other ones so I don&#x27;t have to use so much of the more expensive salts!</li>
    <li> Perfet item... i liked</li>
    <li> As described.  Great in a bath.</li>
    <li> Love it, but too expensive to use it as often as I need to. Perfect for a few baths etc. It was great, gone already and ordered bulk from a local Agway store to reduce the cost.</li>
    <li> Before buying for the purpose of relieving bruises and other injuries (which has no scientific evidence to support), search online for the article \\&quot;Do Epsom Salts Work?\\&quot; by Paul Ingraham.  I had posted the link here, but it gets removed.</li>
    <li> Hey, what can I say? It&#x27;s Epsom Salt. This is as good as any, and a decent price on this size. I was fed up with paying the same price for a pint size at cvs, &amp; found this deal. Amazon still rules!</li>
    <li> Great for muscle soaks. I used it in my Christmas gifts to family. I made salts, detox salt gifts with this. It is a great size for the price. Would definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> Just what the doctor ordered! Little bit in the bath goes a long way especially with soft water. Another added benefit is to use it in the process of making homemade sake.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s Epsom salt for pity sake.  I used it in the garden.</li>
    <li> love natural healthy product&lt;br /&gt;thank u</li>
    <li> This is the greatest stuff for a quick fix of magnesium to your whole body. I put in the jacuzzi and it really helps my legs. You can actually taste it because it has penetrated into the body that well and from a medical standpoint this is what you want and you know that it is pure.It is easier than remembering to take magnesium pills. You have to take a bath............so you never forget to use it when you get cramps in the legs as it is right there on the tub in a decorative glass holder. Once a week is all that is needed and no leg cramps. Lasts a month.</li>
    <li> On time, wonderful product</li>
    <li> I always love Epsom salt...I always feel better after soaking in a tub with some in it. This carton is HUGE and it&#x27;s wonderful because it&#x27;s made of a good material that doesn&#x27;t concave after getting a little wet, so I can keep it on the edge of my tub. Highly recommended :D</li>
    <li> We use this as the base for our home made laundry scent (like the Downy Unstoppables)  This and some essential oil and our clothes come out clean smelling and nice and soft.  It is also certainly cheaper than any store bought products.</li>
    <li> Taking an Epsom salt bath will definitely help sooth sore muscles. However it won&#x27;t cure all your problems. If you have super sore muscles, Epsom salt helps, but it isn&#x27;t an end all be all cure. Take it for what it is, it helps soothes muscles and helps you relax.</li>
    <li> I was suffering with constipation and one teaspoon of EPSOM salt diluted in 8 oz glass of warm water did the trick.  Most people use EPSOM salt to soak in a bath tub which is very good.  I use EPSOM salt also on my plants and they are greener than ever.&lt;br /&gt;Epsom salt has magnesion so it is good to relieve you from constipation but don&#x27;t get too much or can be dangerous (like anything).  One TEA spoon with warm water to clean my intestines Once a month keep me detox.  ;0 YEAH!</li>
    <li> Great for mixing with essential oil to put in bath.  Many other uses I wasn&#x27;t aware of.</li>
    <li> I have use before. good product. I order because of size and price. I use every day. it helps with body aches</li>
    <li> Good deal poor shipping.</li>
    <li> The best epsom salt! High quality, excellent price!</li>
    <li> I need more, as I don&#x27;t use the recommended dose. I have a bad corn I&#x27;m trying to soothe and remove, and I also bought the Progressive International Collapsible Tub and that works well for foot soaking.</li>
    <li> Magnesium Sulfate will always be the same compound regardless of whom you buy it from but the value for your money can vary greatly. I found the same weight of epsom salt for exactly half the price at the grocery store. Better yet, it was enhanced with pure essential oils like spearmint, eucalyptus, rosemary etc. When shopping online for things other than electronics, I advise that you also check the grocery store if your main goal is to save money.</li>
    <li> This really helped rejuvenate our tomato plants.</li>
    <li> I work out a lot and sometimes get very sore from over doing it.  A bath with espom salt works out the soreness and makes me sleep better.</li>
    <li> perfect size for the perfect price with so many uses!</li>
    <li> Always a good product -- use for roses as well as detoxification baths</li>
    <li> epsom salts are fine.  Have used them for many years.  At 85 years of age, I find them very helpful and relaxing.</li>
    <li> I just opened this package today.  The cardboard of the container is infected with brown spots that look like mold or some such thing.  I guess that was a waste of money.</li>
    <li> Good quality Epsom salt. The product is fresh and makes a very therapeutic bath soak! I will be researching other uses for it.</li>
    <li> I learned recently the benefits of epsom salt for relaxation.  I decided to get this from amazon because the price seemed fair and all I can say is that it works wonderfully!  Two cups of this in a warm bath (add in some essential lavendar oil) and it actually does soothe the muscles!</li>
    <li> People say sodium is bad for you, but I say they&#x27;re stupid. Haven&#x27;t you ever been to McDonald&#x27;s? They SOAK their fries in salt and look how good they are for you!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I frequently use this as my &amp;#34;secret&amp;#34; ingredient in my salt &amp; pepper chicken recipe. The chicken is pretty much famous in my town and I&#x27;m always asked to bring it to the monthly sacrificial meetings.</li>
    <li> I had gotten it to soak my sore tired feet from work in at the end of the night but it didn&#x27;t work as well as everyone said it did for them. I work 2nd shift and I am standing all night for my job. Needless to say my feet are killing me bu the end of the night. When I tried this out it helped a little for easing the soreness of my feet but as soon as I took my feet out within 10 minutes my feet were still super sore again. I soaked my feet for 20 minutes too.</li>
    <li> product arrived on time and it is okay</li>
    <li> Good quality at a good price...very satisfied.</li>
    <li> In Las Vegas it&#x27;s easy to clean up several times a day, especially with yard work and such. Instead of using soap all the time I throw in a Epsom Salt bath to get fresh and clean after running around in the car. The product is so fresh and contains no lumps. I am very impressed at the absorption time in the water. It is a matter of minutes. This stuff is great for soft skin and amazing relaxation. No chemical smells added for people like me who are sensitive to chemicals.</li>
    <li> I love epsom salts in my bath.  I actually mix this with magnesium chips and baking soda, and keep a big container of it by the tub.  Most American&#x27;s don&#x27;t get enough magnesium and it&#x27;s important for so many things.  For me, it has a calming effect.  I sometimes add lavender to it.  You can buy epsom salts with lavender in it; but, it&#x27;s a lot cheaper to do it yourself.</li>
    <li> I love this product.  I recently purchased a 2 pound container of this same product at Walmart for less than one dollar.</li>
    <li> I am using this Epsom Salt in my line of skin care products. I love its healing properties, but found that it was a little harsh in my Gentle Exfoliating Body Scrub. I adjusted the recipe and decreased the amount, so it should be fine now. Top quality product. I will definitely order this product again.</li>
    <li> What can you say it is Epsom salt</li>
    <li> great product for the money, i will buy for this company again.</li>
    <li> Very convenient packaging, milk-carton-like, to shake out the amount I wanted to use. I&#x27;ve used it to clean wounds on the dog and on the chickens.</li>
    <li> Works great for after snow shoveling and any other work out activity! I would highly recommend this, you don&#x27;t feel stiff the next day</li>
    <li> Probably the worst thing I have ever tasted. But it feels good on my feet. It was a great value for the amount.</li>
