      <li>You&#x27;ll be rewarded with soft and greatly revived skin.  </li>

      <li>However, since I started using Vanicream on my face, not only has my skin become extremely soft and moisturized, it&#x27;s also stayed beautiful and clear.  </li>
      <li>and this is the only really safe product line that I trust</li>
      <li>Hopefully, I&#x27;ll be able to go back to Vanicream soon.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Anway, decided to try it on my dry skin and it&#x27;s been very effective - done what multiple prescription products from my dermatologist haven&#x27;t:  </li>
      <li>The redness will be relieved, and the dry texture will become softer and more supple.   </li>
      <li>This is good enough that I can skip a day if circumstances require, for example, a really long flight.</li>
      <li>No matter how much lotion/cream I put on, my face would look like extremely dry parchment paper with an oily layer on top.  </li>
      <li>This is a nice product for people with very dry, sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>And this moisturizer really works.  </li>
      <li>This product is billed as gentle on the skin and recommended by dermatologists.</li>
      <li>It really moisturizes my babies skin without being greasy.  </li>
      <li>and I can tell it really helps.</li>
      <li>Better than any other creams I have tried.</li>

      <li>In fact, I just picked up one this evening from my local drug store via special order.  </li>
      <li>I was about to purchase this Vanicream as I used it in the past and liked it for a sunscreeen.</li>
      <li>This product is fantastic for dry skin.</li>
      <li>Both of my children had eczema and through the use of Vanicream with proper bathing techniques, they now have are clear and smooth skin.</li>
      <li>I had no idea that my former moisturizer made my skin itch, mildly, but itch.  </li>
      <li>this cream is so nice and thick.  </li>
      <li>It probably works fine and the 5 stars is based on reviews by other people.</li>
      <li>My skin is very sensitive and I have had no adverse reactions to this product.  </li>
      <li>first you might think it&#x27;s rather costly, but let me reassure you, the one pound container will last you quite a while.   </li>

      <li>Our children have very sensitive skin and because this product has no harmful chemicals, the kids have not experienced any reactions to this and many other products by the same company.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> This product is fantastic for dry skin. Both of my children had eczema and through the use of Vanicream with proper bathing techniques, they now have are clear and smooth skin. I also use Vanicream on really dry areas and it works like a charm. There is no other product that saturates the skin quite as well as Vanicream. For fast and thorough results it&#x27;s the only moisture product we use.</li>
    <li> I started using this product for very mild psorasis.  The plaques are approximately 90% improved after using the product a bit less than a year.  It also performs well in controlling dry, itchy skin in the winter.  My skin is very sensitive and I have had no adverse reactions to this product.  I really like the pump dispenser because I believe it keeps the product a bit less contaminated.</li>
    <li> This product is billed as gentle on the skin and recommended by dermatologists. It probably works fine and the 5 stars is based on reviews by other people.</li>
    <li> I happened to find this product at walgreens (a one pound tub with pump for $13.99).  My friends were using Hydrolatum for their newborn baby&#x27;s skin and I noticed my hands felt extremely soft (and stayed soft for a long time!) after I used my hands to put lotion on the baby too.  I was thinking about buying some Hydrolatum and while doing some internet searches to determine if it was safe to use on my face (i.e., wouldn&#x27;t cause break-outs) I also found some websites talking about Vanicream and how great it was because there were no parabens, etc.  So, when I saw Vanicream at the drug store, I figured &amp;#34;$13.99? - sure, i&#x27;ll give it a try!&amp;#34;  I had been using tazorac and retin-A creams for a while and my skin was really red and raw despite moisturizing like crazy with other gentle creams/lotions.  No matter how much lotion/cream I put on, my face would look like extremely dry parchment paper with an oily layer on top.  I was just utterly confused on how my skin could look so dry and paper-y / crinkly despite the globs and globs of cream I would put on.  People I knew kept on commenting on how red, chapped, and dry/flaky my skin looked.  After I started using Vanicream on my face (I put it on immediately after I wash my face and rub it in well), many many people starting commenting on how my skin started looking much much much better.  Not only was all the flakiness and redness gone, but my face also no longer burned or stung when I washed it!  Even using something as gentle as cetaphil used to cause my skin to burn/sting due to my use of tazorac/retin-A.  However, since I started using Vanicream on my face, not only has my skin become extremely soft and moisturized, it&#x27;s also stayed beautiful and clear.  Vanicream did not cause any break-outs to occur at all!  I&#x27;m amazed!  I&#x27;ve been using it for many many weeks now (almost a month) and I&#x27;ve had no problems whatsoever.  I have extremely sensitive skin (prone to broken blood vessels) which even turns bright red when I use a damp tissue to wipe my face (esp. around the eyes).  Vanicream has never caused my skin to burn or sting or break-out.  I&#x27;m really impressed with it and I will be using it from now on!</li>
    <li> My toddler son has really dry but hyper-sensitive skin and this has been a great help for him.  It&#x27;s the only lotion we&#x27;ve tried that doesn&#x27;t irritate.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Vanicream Moisturizing Skin Cream for years. Unfortunately, in recent times it hasn&#x27;t proven to be as effective for me as it has in the past--I guess my skin is getting dryer, so I&#x27;m using Eucerin Intensive Care Plus (the one with the cross on it) instead. Hopefully, I&#x27;ll be able to go back to Vanicream soon. It&#x27;s a great lotion.</li>
    <li> This is a nice product for people with very dry, sensitive skin. Unfortunately it is so thick that is sometimes hard to spread around and in itself can be a little drying.</li>
    <li> My dermatologist recommend Vanicream; and it&#x27;s the best one I&#x27;ve ever used for my dry, cracked, chapped hands!  In fact, I just picked up one this evening from my local drug store via special order.  I didn&#x27;t realize it was sold here.</li>
    <li> My doctor recommended this after trying a lot of other creams.  This is the BEST for sensitive, dry skin!</li>
    <li> I discovered Vanicream when I took my father to the Mayo Clinic for his surgery and it was used in his post-surgical care.  The nurses were raving about it, so I asked what was so great about it.  It was apparently developed by Mayo dermatologists and is the preferred healing cream at the clinic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anway, decided to try it on my dry skin and it&#x27;s been very effective - done what multiple prescription products from my dermatologist haven&#x27;t:  let my very dry skin heal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will continue using it.</li>
    <li> What a marvelous product this is, and it&#x27;s so vastly under-rated (and not so easy to find, either).    I discovered it last year when my husband was hospitalized with an illness that created a nasty side effect:  a  painful red and bumpy skin rash on his arms and legs.    His dermatalogist (who is truly a godsend to us!) suggested that we use this product religiously to relieve even the toughest skin reactions and allergies. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;At first you might think it&#x27;s rather costly, but let me reassure you, the one pound container will last you quite a while.   I would definitely recommend getting the pump to use with it, also.  Otherwise you&#x27;ll have a mess on your hands when you reach the bottom of the tub.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;This product is great for the most sensitive skin, and also can be purchased in bar-form for use in the shower.   For really severe skin rashes, try soaking gauze in warm water (as warm is can be tolerated), lay it on the area that&#x27;s bothering you, and cover the entire area with warm towels.   Leave these on for at least thirty minutes to get the most effect for the treatment (you&#x27;ll probably have to repeatedly warm the towels so the gauze stays warm).    You&#x27;ll be rewarded with soft and greatly revived skin.  If you repeat this treatment twice a day for a while, you&#x27;ll see dramatic improvements in the condition of your skin.   The redness will be relieved, and the dry texture will become softer and more supple.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;While my results may not be achieved by everyone, I still believe that, dollar for dollar, this is a \\&quot;must have\\&quot; product to keep on hand.</li>
    <li> The very first time I used this product I could see a difference in my skin.  I live in AZ and the dry climate is not good for my skin.  I use this cream every day and I can tell it really helps.</li>
    <li> this cream is so nice and thick.  It really moisturizes my babies skin without being greasy.  It is non-irritating and makes my babies ezcema not flare up. Better than any other creams I have tried.</li>
    <li> I had no idea that my former moisturizer made my skin itch, mildly, but itch.  This is so amazing now, not to have that feeling any more.  And this moisturizer really works.  I have officially switched products now.  Living in the desert moisturizer is a necessity, and a cream really keeps the dry skin away for hours.  This is good enough that I can skip a day if circumstances require, for example, a really long flight.</li>
    <li> I live in cold weather country and develop fissures on my fingers in the winter.  This product has prevented this painful condition.  It is a bit greasy but effective.</li>
    <li> Few weeks ago, a friend told me that her dermatologist recommended this product, and it was totally awesome; so I decided to try the vanicream moisturizing cream, and I truly love it.  It&#x27;s not heavy nor greasy, and sticky like Eucerin and the handy pump dispenser is to die for. I&#x27;ve tried several other products for eczema and dry skin problems, and this is by far one of the best. I would definitely purchase this product online, because it hard to come by at the local drugstores and pharmacies.</li>
    <li> This product came strongly recommended by our family pediatrician and I can say, after our family has tested and tried, this product is the best!!!  Our children have very sensitive skin and because this product has no harmful chemicals, the kids have not experienced any reactions to this and many other products by the same company. Try it and your whole family will love it without any worries!</li>
    <li> I recommend all Vanicream products. I have extremly sensitive skin and this is the only really safe product line that I trust</li>
    <li> The product was satisfactory, as was the transaction. I would recommend both the product and the seller.</li>
    <li> Been using this cream for years.  Recommended and sold by my dermatologist and almsot twice the price.  Get it here if you use it.</li>
    <li> During the winter we use aquaphor, but I was looking for something lighter for my DD for the summer and the dermatologist as well as other Eczema parents recommended Vanicream.  So far the cream is doing great, we still use aquaphor in the evenings.  I like the lightness, the quick absorption and it is not greasy.  The pump on the jar is a plus.</li>
    <li> I was about to purchase this Vanicream as I used it in the past and liked it for a sunscreeen. But, I just saw that it contains BHT, a cancer causing ingredient so I will not buy it an longer. I wont even buy my dog anything with BHT in it ! Too bad, as it did work well.</li>
