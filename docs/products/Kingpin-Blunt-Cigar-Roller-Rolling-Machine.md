      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>This is pretty nice if you like to roll your own...</li>
      <li>The construction of this particular rolling machine is very nice and haven&#x27;t found anything else on the market that can stand up to this one.</li>
      <li>but when she does I&#x27;m sure she&#x27;ll enjoy.</li>
      <li>Pretty much amazing.</li>
      <li>Is great, but not with the same leyend written on it...</li>
      <li>Perfect roll, not too tight and it fits a cigarillo!</li>
      <li>other than that it&#x27;s a great machine and works wel</li>
      <li>DEFINITELY worth buying, an at such a good price, why would you pass it up anyway?</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s not even worth</li>
      <li>The instructions arent clear and its more for rolling tobacco</li>
      <li>This thing isn&#x27;t worth it.</li>
      <li>It rolls so lose and is not the right size.</li>
      <li>and I can&#x27;t get it right</li>
      <li>You have a customer for life, thank you very much.</li>
      <li>if you are an avid &#x27;roll your own-er&#x27; ...</li>
      <li>this is def something you will instantly fall in love with</li>
      <li>so you cant find a normal wrap to fit the whole length.</li>
      <li>First off mines got stolen.</li>
      <li>Came 2-3 days earlier than planned, thought it would be harder to use,  but very easy, started rolling n puffing right away!</li>
      <li>Very convenient</li>
      <li>you can really make a phat blunt</li>
      <li>Instructions that come with it aren&#x27;t very helpful</li>
      <li>I think price is good and package was complete nothing missing, and</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t roll worth anything and must say thank you for such a fast turn around time.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Never hand an issue with it and have been living the high life since it</li>
      <li>Highly recommend.</li>
      <li>so im new</li>
      <li>However you do need to purchase larger cigar papers to fit its long stature.</li>
      <li>It rolls a little tight but after massaging a little it is perfect</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a tube containing clear rolling cigar-size papers.  </li>
      <li>NOT waste your money on this</li>
      <li>Cold as hell only thing that sucks is that sometimes folds the blunt paper but still be burning perfect as hell</li>

<li> rolls a phat blunt or just a regular sized one! and doesn&#x27;t roll it tight where you can&#x27;t hardly pull a drag..</li>
<li> but my husband got it down packed.</li>
<li> Its alright could probably be a little tighter.</li>
<li> Others have a hard time rolling or moving from the load to roll positions.</li>
<li> hard to roll anything &amp;#34;small&amp;#34; in it</li>
<li> Maybe I&#x27;m dumb, but I can work a cigarette roller...</li>
<li> This item is awful, it is poorly designed and rolls a cigar properly maybe 20% of the time.&lt;br</li>
<li> Seriously if you want a blunt that bad, just learn to roll it yourself.</li>
<li> This is crap.</li>
<li> Horrible does not do what it says</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> rolls them BIG!  hard to roll anything &amp;#34;small&amp;#34; in it</li>
    <li> I bought this roller thinking it would be like the ZigZag Cigarette roller, but only for cigars (blunts).  It&#x27;s a tube containing clear rolling cigar-size papers.  This is NOT a Cigar Rolling Machine.  Do not buy it unless you already know how to roll a cigar/blunt.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t buy it for myself because I don&#x27;t smoke. but my friend said it work really good.</li>
    <li> Horrible does not do what it says</li>
    <li> Never used one of these before and I can&#x27;t get it right but my husband got it down packed.</li>
    <li> Does what it says and without any problems, who can complain? Just be careful and don&#x27;t throw it around and don&#x27;t be aggressive when you are rolling and it won&#x27;t break</li>
    <li> I love it. Very convenient</li>
    <li> This is crap. It rolls so lose and is not the right size. Not very durable either. I tried to use it once and have</li>
    <li> Came 2-3 days earlier than planned, thought it would be harder to use,  but very easy, started rolling n puffing right away! Perfect roll, not too tight and it fits a cigarillo!</li>
    <li> This item is awful, it is poorly designed and rolls a cigar properly maybe 20% of the time.&lt;br /&gt;Do NOT waste your money on this</li>
    <li> Great product. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Worked great for me my mother in law liked it so now it&#x27;s hers. She has yet to use it but when she does I&#x27;m sure she&#x27;ll enjoy.</li>
    <li> Cold as hell only thing that sucks is that sometimes folds the blunt paper but still be burning perfect as hell</li>
    <li> Too big for a regular size swisher..&lt;br /&gt;Waste of my money</li>
    <li> It was too big for cigarillos but that&#x27;s my fault cause the length was on the page, other than that it&#x27;s a great machine and works wel</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t roll worth anything and must say thank you for such a fast turn around time. The construction of this particular rolling machine is very nice and haven&#x27;t found anything else on the market that can stand up to this one. You have a customer for life, thank you very much.</li>
    <li> Love it! rolls a phat blunt or just a regular sized one! and doesn&#x27;t roll it tight where you can&#x27;t hardly pull a drag.. recommed this to anyone wants a good blunt roller!</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t work that well. When it rolls the \\&quot;tobacco\\&quot; it doesn&#x27;t roll it tight enough. Alot of times I have to take it out when its halfway rolled up and fix it myself.</li>
    <li> Roll perfect blunts every time</li>
    <li> Pretty much amazing. Got the job done perfectly 😎</li>
    <li> Instructions that come with it aren&#x27;t very helpful the plastic on it seems like it should be tighter around the sticks and mines keeps getting stuck but luckilyI got it to roll once so far the rest of times have been a failure</li>
    <li> Got completely different brand than ordered. Don&#x27;t like it at all. Just stick to rolling it your self</li>
    <li> Maybe I&#x27;m dumb, but I can work a cigarette roller... A blunt roller is just out of the question. Seriously if you want a blunt that bad, just learn to roll it yourself. This thing isn&#x27;t worth it.</li>
    <li> First off mines got stolen. Thats how awesome it was. None like it one of a kind, i never knew how good this roller was until i lost it. Others have a hard time rolling or moving from the load to roll positions. This one was easy to use and was an excellent blunt roller. Perfect conversation starter and very classy blk and silver finish. Doesnt hurt that it says KingPin on it either. If your looking for a roller this is the one for you.</li>
    <li> Is great, but not with the same leyend written on it...</li>
    <li> Very good roller. However you do need to purchase larger cigar papers to fit its long stature. Regular cigarette.cigarello.and swisher papers do not fit this device</li>
    <li> Its too long for your average blunt</li>
    <li> Requires patients to utilize.  Not the greatest roller by no means</li>
    <li> I think price is good and package was complete nothing missing, and im learning how to roll so im new</li>
    <li> I could not use it at all. The instructions arent clear and its more for rolling tobacco</li>
    <li> all i have to say ... EASILY rolls a 3 gram &#x27;cigar&#x27; :D DEFINITELY worth buying, an at such a good price, why would you pass it up anyway? if you are an avid &#x27;roll your own-er&#x27; ... tehn this is def something you will instantly fall in love with</li>
    <li> It rolls a little tight but after massaging a little it is perfect I recommend to everyone that rolls there own &amp;#34; tabacco&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> Good buy i still have it and it still works would recommend to people have a nice day and good price</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t buy this it&#x27;s not even worth it mine doesn&#x27;t work at all</li>
    <li> Its alright could probably be a little tighter. The biggest concern i have is that its really big so you cant find a normal wrap to fit the whole length. I recommend buying a roll of hemp paper, that way you can really make a phat blunt</li>
    <li> This is pretty nice if you like to roll your own...er..um...cigars.&lt;br /&gt;Never hand an issue with it and have been living the high life since it arrived!&lt;br /&gt;Blaze on!</li>
