      <li>This gives me a nice tan.</li>

      <li>I LOVE this.</li>

      <li>everything else is okay.</li>
      <li>Works well, just make sure you put on even and rub in well.</li>

      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>Getting more.</li>
      <li>Do a spot check as soon as you get it and make sure it works on you.</li>
      <li>This one is safe and most importantly, it works!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s more of an orange color than brown, and I had to get used to the greasy gel feeling as opposed to a lotion.</li>
      <li>That said, the texture was more waxy than creamy, but it feels good on your skin because it melts right into it.  </li>
      <li>I gave this 4 stars because it works pretty good, but still seemed a bit orange in spots.</li>
      <li>Moisturizes perfectly, and most importantly, gives a beautiful, golden color after using for a few days.  </li>
      <li>It also does not have the strong chemical smell most self-tanners have.</li>
      <li>The seller was super nice about it</li>
      <li>I am a very fair skinned woman only intending to use this on my legs.</li>
      <li>Great natural, self tanner.</li>
      <li>I even use it on my face and there is a very noticeable change, in a good way.</li>
      <li>You have to really rub it in good and even.</li>
      <li>It smells good (not so much like lavender</li>
      <li>The color is good , works fast , but</li>
      <li>Goes on easy.</li>
      <li>I mix it 50-50 with a good body lotion and use it 3 or 4 times over a couple of days (knees only once, though), and she gets a nice, even, tannish looking tan.  </li>
      <li>but the scent isn&#x27;t strong), and tans my skin well without that orange hue.</li>
      <li>if you want to smell like pee, then I strongly recommend this product.</li>
      <li>Its alright may be a bit on a orangey side, and dont like the smell its too strong for me.</li>
      <li>and I was able to return it for a full refund.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It is smooth and creamy, spreads easily, has no detectable smell-</li>
      <li>Really works great, just be sure to apply very evenly or does leave streaks, but nice color and love all natural</li>
      <li>it is chemical free.</li>
      <li>but not oder free.</li>
      <li>Not greasy after it dries; I have light olive skin</li>
      <li>Smooth.</li>
      <li>I researched this on EWG.org and feel comfortable with it</li>
      <li>FANTASTIC.  </li>
      <li>Works like a charm AND is cruelty free.  </li>
      <li>Pros - very good color, not as dark as Jergens, but not as orange.</li>
      <li>I bought this because I thought there would be minimal smell, or it would smell more pleasant then others.</li>
      <li>I actually filled in her spots with True and saved us a lot of time and mess.&lt;br /&gt;Very</li>
      <li>This product is pretty good - natural, good color, not a lot of streaking - but I still think the Lavera just rocks and will be going back to my favorite.</li>
      <li>EWG rates most sunless tanners as being pretty toxic.</li>
      <li>I have bought this from another retailer and I love it - natural looking, not an overwhelming scent</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t think it was possible to find an all-natural, completely safe self-tanner that is so effective.  </li>
      <li>so I can get the right one!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I have tried many self tanners, and this one is by far the worst. It leaves major streaks. Need I say more? The smell is not that great either. I would not recommend this product to anyone.</li>
    <li> This is a good sunless tanner.  Nice color.  I could not give it 5 stars because based on the price, you get an extremely small amount of product.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great. Leaves a nice non-streak tan and is all natural. Ity&#x27;s my new go-to tanner</li>
    <li> Works very well and you see results quickly.</li>
    <li> if you want to smell like pee, then I strongly recommend this product. I bet hunters use it all the time.</li>
    <li> I looked and looked for more natural/less toxic self tanners.  From what I understand, none of them are great, since DHA, even plant-sourced is questionable.  But!  This one is suitable, and gets a decently low toxicity rating.  I loved that one application gave me a nice, subtle and natural color!  As a frame of reference, one application gives you more color than Jergens Medium, and less than Loreal Medium.  The perfect amount for me!  This makes it easy to use, and a little goes a long way.  Definitely my favorite tanner I&#x27;ve ever used!</li>
    <li> Very easy to apply, makes even tan and does not feel greasy on the skin. I&#x27;d used it many times, and ended up using it for my wedding instead of getting a spray tan. It worked just fine, I had a nice even tan. It also does not have the strong chemical smell most self-tanners have. I picked it because it was a number 1 on the EWG website where they provide information on skincare toxicity, so this product was named the safest sunless tanner.</li>
    <li> When I don&#x27;t have time to take her to get a professional spray tan, I use this on my very fair Irish Dancing daughter (I know, but all the girls do it, so the judges expect it).  I mix it 50-50 with a good body lotion and use it 3 or 4 times over a couple of days (knees only once, though), and she gets a nice, even, tannish looking tan.  It&#x27;s not as orange as a lot of tanners. It doesn&#x27;t have the chemicals that a lot of tanners have -- Environmental Working Group gives it a &amp;#34;2&amp;#34; unlike a lot of other tanners, which get 5s and 6s.  It also fades well after her competitions, not blotchy like other products we&#x27;ve tried.</li>
    <li> Great product! Does exactly what it claims. I have tried other products but this is the first to give me a natural look. It doesn&#x27;t turn orange or streak on my fair skin.  I will defiantly continue using this product.</li>
    <li> Works well, just make sure you put on even and rub in well.</li>
    <li> I love this! It works over night and doesn&#x27;t have an awful smell. I did find that it had a very oily feeling, but it leaves your skin soft and smooth when you shower the lotion off.&lt;br /&gt;This is perfect for fair skin!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not a fan of sunless tanners. I hate the smell, I hate the fake orange tint, I hate the streaks, and the way your palms end up darker than anything else. This is different. Revolutionary even. The smell is subtle and pleasant and fades very quickly. It goes on just like lotion and doesn&#x27;t look fake or streaky. It took three applications to get the shade I want and I am not complaining. This is going to become part of my standard beauty routine.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t think it was possible to find an all-natural, completely safe self-tanner that is so effective.  So when I found True Natural I felt like a struck the jackpot.  It feels great to put on, no greasiness whatsoever.  Even with one application I saw an effect that was just right.  I&#x27;ve been putting it on after I shower every three days, and I am so in love.  I even use it on my face with great results.  I have very sensitive skin and usually don&#x27;t put anything on my face besides honey and jojoba oil, so I was scared to add this to my regimen, but I&#x27;ve had only positive results.  FANTASTIC.  Never stop making it please!</li>
    <li> Self tanner just as described. Shipping was quick. Excellent experience.</li>
    <li> Finally found a tanning cream that doesn&#x27;t smell horrid and actually works... I bought this to use only on my face and like it lots...,&lt;br /&gt;Happy Girl!</li>
    <li> This was perfect for my needs. I was in the bridal party for a wedding and I am super pale, and wanted a bit of a tan. I was worried it would be too dark/orange, but this was subtle and looked natural. Exactly what I wanted, without the harsh chemicals.</li>
    <li> Does exactly what it claims to do!&lt;br /&gt;Easy to apply, no streaks. I am really happy with this product and would buy it again.</li>
    <li> I was testing out this product to possibly use before my wedding - unfortunately it looks like I will need to continue searching.&lt;br /&gt;I used in on my legs for testing, 4 days on my upper leg, 3 days on my lower leg/feet. My feet did not turn out well, I assume because it did not apply evenly. My feet had large yellowish/orange spots and were darker on my toes. My legs looked great, I was very pleased, until today. My routine was to apply the lotion after my shower. I took one day off, and then this morning I noticed some coming off under the water. When I dried off it all rubbed off onto my towel and I was left with no color. I also noticed spots on my sheets this morning.&lt;br /&gt;Others seemed to have good luck with it, so maybe I just had a bad routine, but I highly recommend testing this product before a big event, I&#x27;m glad that I did as I will not be using it to prepare for my big day.</li>
    <li> I need to stop trying other things once I find a product I like.  I guess that&#x27;s called being a product junkie.  This product is pretty good - natural, good color, not a lot of streaking - but I still think the Lavera just rocks and will be going back to my favorite.</li>
    <li> I did not like this self tanner at all. It broke my skin out and it feels so nasty and heavy on the skin. I felt like my pores couldn&#x27;t breath. I kept smelling it the whole time on my face and it smells like chemicals. I couldn&#x27;t wait to get home to wash it off. It also gave me a really unnatural color. I don&#x27;t recommend this tanner.</li>
    <li> This self tanner is a good color for me (I&#x27;m very pale) and smells like citrus frosting to me instead of chemicals (it does smell a little for the hours it&#x27;s working).  I didn&#x27;t have any issues with streaking and I feel great using it knowing that it&#x27;s biobased.</li>
    <li> Really works great, just be sure to apply very evenly or does leave streaks, but nice color and love all natural</li>
    <li> The product smells a bit better than others I&#x27;ve used but the color of my skin is great!</li>
    <li> I have not used this and am looking for a natural self tanning lotion. This is not it contains dihydroxyacetone (DHA). &amp;#34;Although there is no concrete evidence indicating that DHA is harmful, some reports have found that it may have the potential to cause genetic alterations and DNA damage.&amp;#34; Which can lead to cancer. Yes, I know that there are tons of other things that COULD lead to cancer, but I personal would like to avoid this from happening to me. At least I can avoid product that contain DHA.</li>
    <li> Best tanning lotion out there.</li>
    <li> I bought this hoping natural would work. It smells nice and does not make my skin break out, but I also need to apply it 3 times to see some change in my face color. I&#x27;m glad I tried it, but I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it if you are looking for actual color change.</li>
    <li> I consider myself very pale and this product did not work for me. The seller was super nice about it and I was able to return it for a full refund. Do a spot check as soon as you get it and make sure it works on you. I also found it didn’t smell much like lavender and had a lot of that “self tanner” smell. The smell wouldn’t have been so bad if the product actually worked for me.</li>
    <li> this tanner fits for me with not having the usual smell and being natural. I just put on legs and its a subtle clean product</li>
    <li> Love this!  I have pale skin and this works very well for me.  I exfoliate first and put light moisturizer on before I use this tanning cream or I will mix a tiny bit of moisturizer with the tanning cream and it&#x27;s perfect!  Wish it came in a larger size and wasn&#x27;t so expensive!</li>
    <li> I have bought this from another retailer and I love it - natural looking, not an overwhelming scent and you can gradually increase the color (which I personally like).  It does not give you an instant dark tan if that is what you are seeking.  Unfortunately, I have tried purchasing this twice from two different Amazon retailers and both times I have received the wrong product.  Amazon has been great to work with (as always!) but frustrated I keep receiving the incorrect tanner... different label, different description, no expiration date, says &amp;#34;medium color&amp;#34;... almost like it is an older version they are trying to get rid of... my other retailer has stopped carrying so hoping Amazon can figure this out so I can get the right one!</li>
    <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;works well and fast. I recommend using it after shower/bath and exfoliated skin.&lt;br /&gt;The product is on the thicker side so slightly damp skin helps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt; It definitely will clog pores and may cause breakouts for acne prone skin. If you have larger pores, I would not recommend this. Refined skin will likely not have a problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has the typical sunless tanning smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommendation:&lt;br /&gt;use this sparingly, like 1-3 times a week as needed.&lt;br /&gt;be careful with white sheets if applied at night, that is why I usually put it on in the morning.</li>
    <li> I bought based on the reviews, no bad smell- true, natural color - so so, even color- not true. I noticed it was so thick I could barely squeeze it from the tube, so if May have been old and expired- bottle didn&#x27;t say., color was chalky to me and had to scrub a few areas to decrease color.</li>
    <li> ...A rare combination. EWG rates most sunless tanners as being pretty toxic. This one is safe and most importantly, it works! I&#x27;ve used it twice. The color is natural and (as long as you exfoliate first and rub in evenly) the tan is perfect.</li>
    <li> It is a good self tanner but still has some of an odor to it but not much. It is nice lotion and applies well.</li>
    <li> Its alright may be a bit on a orangey side, and dont like the smell its too strong for me. Gets spotty fast, dont like that either. everything else is okay. use it on body only cuz if used on face it will get very spotty, and it wont come off for few days.</li>
    <li> Bottle looks like it went through a garage disposal and it smells like burnt skin.</li>
    <li> This product is wonderful! It is the first natural tanning product that I have tried, so I can&#x27;t compare it that way- but compared to the drug store varieties of tanning products- this is superior!&lt;br /&gt;It is smooth and creamy, spreads easily, has no detectable smell- certainly not the chemically smell of the drug store brands! And, it developes into a nice warm tan color!!! I used it on my legs and also on my face, and I am a fan!</li>
    <li> I use this all year long!  I mix it with regular hand lotion to extend use.  This used to be made by Lavera, so it is a carcinogenic-free product.</li>
    <li> This  product is not all natural.  I used it once and broke out in hives due to the hydroxyacetone.  I had to send it back.</li>
    <li> Not impressed. Not easy to spread. Turned my skin orange with uneven coloring.</li>
    <li> This is a review of three comparable products: Jergens Natural Glow - 3 Days to Glow Moisturizer Medium to Tan Skin,True Natural: All Natural Self Tanner Face &amp; Body, and Caribbean Solutions Beach Colors Natural Self Tanner. I have been using the Jergen&#x27;s product for years, but have been reading too much about the toxicity of the ingredients. I used several sites to research this, and found EWG&#x27;s Skin Deep to be most helpful. So I narrowed them down, and tried True Natural and Caribbean Solutions. I have been using the latter two for about a month now, and here is my findings.&lt;br /&gt;Jergens: Pros - It is the darkest color, two applications and you can really tell the difference. Cons -- Very potent odor. Smells your clothes and everything it touches, with the smell lingering for days. My family can&#x27;t stand the smell. It dyes fabrics that it comes into contact with, like sheets, even multiple hours after application. Hard to get the last part out of the tube. Apply too much and color goes to orange. Aforementioned toxicity fears.&lt;br /&gt;True Natural. Pros - very good color, not as dark as Jergens, but not as orange. Odor is not potent. Low toxicity and cancer concerns. Cons: Doesn&#x27;t apply smoothly, have to really rub it in. Container is not the easiest to use, but better than Jergens.&lt;br /&gt;Caribbean Solutions. Pros - Mild odor. By far, the easiest to apply. Low toxicity and cancer concerns. Smooth. Decent color -- not orange. Can apply any time. Cons: Color is the lightest of the three, but still makes a big difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My conclusion: I probably will use all three -- with Jergens use the least frequent. Maybe an application every other day for the first couple of days a month to get some rich color, and then touch up the rest of the month with the other two. I will not use Jergens more than that because of the toxicity, smell and mess. I imagine Caribbean Solutions will be used most frequently, because the color is almost as good as True Natural, and it is byfar the easiest to use. Really simple to use every two or three days: you don&#x27;t have to figure out a good time when you won&#x27;t stain anything, or be around other people to offend with the smell, or soil your clothes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course, with them all, you have to wash your palms really well after using so they don&#x27;t get the color.</li>
    <li> clogged pores caused breakout.</li>
    <li> Wow, amazing.  I am switching all of my makeup and personal care items to &amp;#34;green&amp;#34;.  Self-tanners can be loaded with fragrance and harsh chemicals.  Sad because I loved St. Tropez more than anything.  These chemicals will do harm in the long-run and it&#x27;s not worth it.  Found this brand on EWG site and ordered here.  Love it.  BF doesn&#x27;t complain about the smell (he used to with the st. tropez).  In fact, the lavender scent is great.  Moisturizes perfectly, and most importantly, gives a beautiful, golden color after using for a few days.  Tip: I use more than one layer, sometimes even three.  The color isn&#x27;t intense, so building the color is a necessity.</li>
    <li> I did not order from this listed supplier as I can get it at a nearby store for $15 (and no shipping).  Love it!! Not smelly like the the chemical ones  .  .  . but not oder free. You will still smell a slight scent like that of a tanner.  It moisturizes the skin well too.  Getting more. Not from here though.</li>
    <li> The tube was pretty small (making the product pretty expensive per ounce) but the color was great.  It didn&#x27;t smear, went on evenly, and wasn&#x27;t orangy at all.  It looked very natural.  AND, it&#x27;s vegan.  I will definately buy this product again.</li>
    <li> I tan pretty easy and this just doesn&#x27;t really do anything. Its a white type cream that rubs on smooth, but leaves my face feeling oily and really heavy. It doesn&#x27;t even tan it. I have to use this product with another tanning lotion just to see anything. It doesn&#x27;t stay on long and smells kinda bad. Def wouldn&#x27;t recommend.</li>
    <li> It does in fact look very orange. bad stuff.</li>
    <li> I found this a bit heavy, which for me, translates into streaks and it&#x27;s hard to get out of the tube.&lt;br /&gt;The ingredients are excellent and the fragrance is strong but not bad, so if it&#x27;s right for your skin, definitely worth trying.&lt;br /&gt;The company/vendor was very accommodating. I love doing business with people who back their product.</li>
    <li> I have always had topical (itchy rash) reactions to self-tanners.  I don&#x27;t care how much they cost, etc...  (Because of a gluten sensitivity, I only use topical  products they have natural ingredients and no parabens, etc...)  This includes my daily routine with soap, shampoo, moisterizers and laundry detergents.  It&#x27;s just better for you anyway.&lt;br /&gt;After researching several options, I tried the True product and had no reaction to it at all.  I am fair complected/light freckles and it dried very natural looking for my tone.  I did use it sparingly to start and then added to areas the next day.  I&#x27;m not sure how long it lasted for I was on a beach vacation but I would say conservatively 4-5 days before reapplying.&lt;br /&gt;My teenage step daughter brought the San Tropez tanner with her and applied the 1st night of vacation.  What a mess and ordeal that was.  It applies very unevenly and messy even after exfoiliating .  After what I thought was a heavy application for her she would have had to apply again to get a similar color to what I had and I didn&#x27;t experience any of the mess I saw with her product.  I actually filled in her spots with True and saved us a lot of time and mess.&lt;br /&gt;Very happy with True, will order again and try some of their other products as well.  Great value too!</li>
    <li> Works well. You have to really rub it in good and even. Only last for a day or so though.</li>
    <li> After all of the reviews, I decided to try this product.  I have fair to medium complexion and I tan pretty well in the beds.  I have used spray tans in the past and for the most part they look natural until I start applying too many times and then I start to look orange.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I tried this product for the first time, I mixed it with some of my own face cream, because I wanted to make sure that it wasn&#x27;t too dark on the first application.  I&#x27;m glad I did.  The next morning I woke up and I was VERY orange.  I imagine, had I put the lotion on without cutting it with my moisturizer, I would have looked like an Oompa Loompa!  I will not be using this product again.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s organic so that makes me happy - cream feels good - just can&#x27;t apply too much or it&#x27;s orangy.</li>
    <li> wonderful self-tanner, lovely color, beautiful scent.  will never, ever again buy self-tanners from drugstore.</li>
    <li> This gives me a nice tan. I&#x27;ve used it just on the face, neck and chest. But, after applying, it feels tacky and moist still on the skin for a few hours afterwards. It never quite absorbs all the way. I don&#x27;t notice an intense smell -- just a little which I would expect. So, overall I am pretty satisfied.</li>
    <li> I like how it developed into a nice brown color. It didn&#x27;t streak and was simple to use. It is a bit thick and takes a while to absorb, though. I usually try to go 30 minutes before getting dressed just to be sure. It hasn&#x27;t rubbed off on clothes or sheets but it will stain on hands and feet if not careful. I put thick lotion or cream on my hands, feet, knees, and elbows beforehand so it isn&#x27;t darker on those spots, which seems to work pretty well. I especially like it because it has better ingredients than other self tanners.</li>
    <li> This is LOADED with toxic chemicals! Don&#x27;t be fooled by the clever marketing. Read the label and Google the ingredients yourselves.</li>
    <li> I am very satisfied with this self tanner. The color is good , works fast , but not too&lt;br /&gt;much color. Looks natural. I chose it because it is safer than most self tanners and&lt;br /&gt;uses natural ingredients.A good find !!</li>
    <li> Good smelling, easy to use and apply -- results were very good...  It was a little pricey; but overall I was happy that I tried the product.</li>
    <li> Finally a self-tanner that won&#x27;t make my skin freak out and itch, and it actually works!  I wouldn&#x27;t say the scent is lavender, per se, but it&#x27;s not as bad as other tanners.</li>
    <li> Works like a charm AND is cruelty free.  A no-brainer.  I use 2 or 3 times a week during the winter to prevent me from looking like a snowman.</li>
    <li> This lotion worked great (and faster than some of the more gradual tanners) but the smell was also stronger than most so I will not purchase again.</li>
    <li> I am a very fair skinned woman only intending to use this on my legs. I waxed before using this, so was adequately exfoliated, as directed. Surprisingly, one application was enough for me. I wasn&#x27;t going for tan; just &amp;#34;regular&amp;#34; skin tone, since my normal skin tone is fish-belly white. I washed my hands thoroughly and no stains. Pretty good for a fake tan.</li>
    <li> Fastest self tanner I have ever used. I already have more of a glow and I&#x27;ve only used it twice.</li>
    <li> This self tanner is okay, but I couldn&#x27;t believe how small the tube is. Yes, it is a stated on the site, but when I saw it I was shocked. As for the product, I found it to be easy to use, didn&#x27;t smell bad and really is a natural looking tan.</li>
    <li> Still has a smell - didn&#x27;t smell like lavender but has a nice even look&lt;br /&gt; - looking for one without a smell that is all natural</li>
    <li> It was very disappointing because I really wanted this all natural tanner to work ,but it failed me. First of all it smells good going on ,but after it dries it has a bad odor and it is hard to see if your applying it evenly because it is clear. Try washing off the tanner and it was very difficult my skin was red and raw after scrubbing for several minutes! I am returning this tanner and will have to go back to my old bronzer with color.</li>
    <li> I REALLY wish this was non-comedogenic because it actually is a fantastic product.  It&#x27;s one of the few self-tanners I&#x27;ve found that is free of all those nasty chemicals, yet still every bit as effective.  It gives you a great even color, and doesn&#x27;t have that awful smell most tanners have (lavender scent is very subtle).  That said, the texture was more waxy than creamy, but it feels good on your skin because it melts right into it.  Unfortunately, it just didn&#x27;t react well with my oily/ acne prone skin.</li>
    <li> This is a product you have to plan ahead to use. Takes hours to show up. That&#x27;s why removed a star. Because when I put on in the morning on my face before make-up, I have no idea what it will look like 2 hours later. Or if I apply to my body before going out for the day, again, I can&#x27;t see if I&#x27;ve done a good job until a few hours later and at that point, what are my options to fix? Best bet - apply a couple hours before bed so if you need to apply more or fix, you will be able to later that night or the next morning. I appreciate other self tanners that show a slight tint on your skin after application - that give you a preview of sorts of the color. With that said, for color alone, I would give 5 stars. It does look natural and nice.</li>
    <li> I decided to try this since it was rated as the safest self tanner to use on another website. It smells good (not so much like lavender but the scent isn&#x27;t strong), and tans my skin well without that orange hue. I dilute mine with other lotions in the ratio of 2 of this to 1 other lotion, and the result is a very natural tint, and I apply about once or twice a week. The only complaint is that the tube was smaller than I expected, and for the price I tend to use it up pretty quickly.</li>
    <li> Great natural, self tanner. Creates gradual, natural looking color and it does not streak. I will buy it again soon.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried several self tanners and they never work well on my face.  Finally something that does.</li>
    <li> Works well. I love it.</li>
    <li> While it&#x27;s not as dark as my non-all-natural self-tanner, it still gets 5 stars for being all-natural. It&#x27;s more of an orange color than brown, and I had to get used to the greasy gel feeling as opposed to a lotion. But I still like to use it on my face as a base and on my legs when I wear skirts to work. I like that it doesn&#x27;t have sun protection so it&#x27;s not thick like sun block for going to work, though the downside is you can&#x27;t go without adding sun block on top for the weekends.</li>
    <li> have used a number of self tanners.  very little odor.  Spreads evenly and a little goes a long way.  Streaking has been at a minimum if any</li>
    <li> It made me feel like I looked jaundice for awhile. Still wearing long pants until the stains wear off my legs.</li>
    <li> Some self tanners leave me itching, but this one didn&#x27;t.  Not greasy after it dries; I have light olive skin so this one is good for winter but I need a darker tanning product for the summer.</li>
    <li> I gave this 4 stars because it works pretty good, but still seemed a bit orange in spots. I have very fair skin with freckles so it&#x27;s hard to use any fake tanner. It wasn&#x27;t too orange that I felt uncomfortable using it, but I would only do 3 consecutive applications before I let it fade. Smells pretty strong, but it can be covered up with other lotions. I recommend using it at night and then putting lotion on or rinsing in the shower the next morning.</li>
    <li> At first try I did not like this at all because if not rubbed in, and I mean really rubbed in, it is tacky feeling. Once I read another reviewers&#x27; advice to rub it in well and even use a little moisturizer to improve the absorption and coverage I have changed my opinion fully. I bought this to try a more natural product (I&#x27;ve used Nutrogena-terribly smelly and Loreal-drying, in the past) The True Natural color is nice light brown, not orangy and has lasted several days with one application.</li>
    <li> Contains DHA.  I can&#x27;t use it.</li>
    <li> left me with that orange look</li>
    <li> My favorite tanning lotion. I love that it&#x27;s pretty natural and it gives a good color without that funky smell.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this. It works as well as the expensive spray tan I get, although I can&#x27;t reach my back. I&#x27;m a redhead (complete with freckles all over) and never thought I could look like I have a tan and get away with it. But everyone thinks I have a tan! Its crazy. I researched this on EWG.org and feel comfortable with it bc it is chemical free. No smell. No weird streaking. I even use it on my face and there is a very noticeable change, in a good way. People ask if I have lightened my hair.</li>
    <li> I bought this because I thought there would be minimal smell, or it would smell more pleasant then others. I was wrong, it STINKS! Color is not bad but doesnt last long.</li>
    <li> Gives a nice, non-streaky, natural tan but does not last long. Best for people willing to reapply every other day, maybe eventually you can cut back to few times a week. Goes on easy. Scent isn&#x27;t great. I detect the lavender smell but it smells a bit old. Perhaps it&#x27;s just the batch I got.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have very fair skin and freckles. I have used this on my face, neck, and chest and it works well without looking fake or leaving a line where I stopped the application.</li>
