<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Have not noticed any results yet. I&#x27;ve been using it on my face and stomach during pregnancy for the past 3 months. It has helped maybe a little bit with the melasma but I haven&#x27;t been applying it to my face daily. When I do use it on my face it doesn&#x27;t cause me to break out anywhere and I&#x27;m usually very susceptible to breakouts.</li>
    <li> I had carpal tunnel surgery on my left hand 3 weeks ago and started using this the day after my stitches came out, my Dr said it was ok.  My method is to spread it on the 1&amp;#34; wrist incision and massage firmly across it and in circles, I do this several times a day. The oil softens the old dead skin on the edges making it easier to slough off. And it lubricates the skin making it easier to massage and compress the area. I have read, and believe, that regular massaging breaks up the formation of scar tissue. I&#x27;m 1 week past having the stitches out and my scar is healing well and looks great. If I never touched it I think it would still look cruddy.  I&#x27;m less convinced this is due to any magic properties of the oil, and more that the lubricating properties and massaging are the key. I&#x27;m pleased.</li>
    <li> It is very useful for scars, but you have to keep using it for about 3 months. Now I have 2 more in storage.</li>
    <li> It worksss! Within two weeks my scars were faded, still very noticeable but a lot better, and its only been two weeks so I&#x27;m excited :)</li>
    <li> good stuff&lt;br /&gt;It is good for scars,stretch marks,unenen skin tone, aging skin and dehydrated skin.&lt;br /&gt;Although i took time,but i look better than before. And my skin become smoother. I will continue use it twice a day and recover my face~</li>
    <li> I have deep olive skin- when I get a burn/mark/scratch- whatever it heals but the mark remains like forever!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I burnt my arm....and read reviews on this.&lt;br /&gt;I bought a bottle for myself and  used it religiously for a few weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This took away 80 percent of the mark that was left on my arm...&lt;br /&gt;I can see a slight shadow of it, but if it works this well for me....people with skin that&lt;br /&gt;is a bit more resiliant to marking would find this the wonder product!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I give this 5 stars and would recommend it to anyone!!!</li>
    <li> This is probably the greatest product I&#x27;ve ever found for my sensitive skin. It seems to brighten and nurture, even if I am sleep deprived. I absolutely love it.</li>
    <li> Good product not much to say about it, I would recommend to a friend!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this on a scar on my leg for about 3 weeks now and I&#x27;ve definitely noticed that it&#x27;s become less visible. The bottle is still nearly full. A little goes a long way. I&#x27;m confident that my scar will go away completely in time. In addition, I&#x27;ve incorporated Bio Oil into my skin care routine. After cleansing I simply rub it onto the parts of my skin that are slightly discolored or where there are light marks. I leave it on while I sleep. It definitely makes me glow in the morning and improves my skin tone.</li>
    <li> I have a problem with extremely sensitive skin.  One cheek starts to itch then turns red.  I have tried all kinds of expensive things to stop the pain.  I bought this at a local Vons on the chance that it would help and it does.  By ordering it from Amazon I also save a lot of money.  I use it all over my face and neck and chest.  It smells good without being cloying and works wonderfully.</li>
    <li> My wife says she likes this product.</li>
    <li> I have to say this stuff really works, at least for scars. I burned myself taking a turkey out of the oven one Thanksgiving--got two angry red welts on the inside of my forearm. I googled &amp;#34;scar treatments&amp;#34;, and Bio-Oil came up. I decided to try it, and for the next year I faithfully massaged the area with a few drops of this every day after showering. By the next Thanksgiving, the marks were literally invisible to the naked eye! I can&#x27;t imagine anything could&#x27;ve worked better at the price.</li>
    <li> This is such a great product to help your skin heal.</li>
    <li> It feels great on my skin and I had open pours that are now very minimal</li>
    <li> Helped alot during pregnancy didnt get one single strecth mark so happy</li>
    <li> Used religiously for months and never saw a difference.</li>
    <li> Has strong chemical smells.</li>
    <li> At 43 I had adult acne breakouts........and it left dark marks all over my face.........it was really bad and I was so embarrassed but after 3 months, my face is 85-90% clear...I use this twice a day</li>
    <li> i love it ,i still using it right now,..</li>
    <li> This stuff WORKS! But it only works if you use it faithfully and consistently. I&#x27;ve been using this stuff a whole year after I had my son (stretch marks looked like the devil scratched up my stomach) and by the end of the year they&#x27;re GONE! I used it everyday twice a day on my stomach in circular motions. Honestly you won&#x27;t see results right away but it DOES work, just not that fast. Lol</li>
    <li> very nice for removing makeup</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t buy this bio oil on amazon, but i did in a drug store. This product is awful to put on your skin. I used it for my acne scars and it made the scars look worse. It stretched the scars out and made it bigger. I couldn&#x27;t believe it. Do not waste your money people.</li>
    <li> Smells amazing!! The stretch marks on my thighs are much much lighter. I mix this oil with Palmer&#x27;s Cocoa Butter Formula Massage Cream For Stretch Marks and the results are amazing, (TRY IT) . I had to order a bigger one. I use it everyday &amp; WILL for sure use it in the future when I become pregnant.</li>
    <li> Work great, I ordered this 4 time already</li>
    <li> this is my fourth little bottle and idk if I even see a difference in my stretchmarks . it looks as If nothing changed even</li>
    <li> I love this!!! I have been using this product for almost two months.  My old stretch marks on my stomach and thighs are visibly reduced.  I use it religiously twice a day along with Q-10 firming lotion (just to make sure I cover all my bases). I will continue to use it and see if there is any further improvement.  Love it! Worth every penny!</li>
    <li> I love how this feels on my skin and it smells incredible!  I think it will penetrate to the subdermis !&lt;br /&gt;I am itchy on my love handles b/c I am losing weight, and I am going to see if this will make stretch marks not appear.</li>
    <li> Get it on before i expected! Great service!</li>
    <li> If you have any scarring or dry skin ~ use this. It&#x27;s stronger than vitamin E oil which I used in the past.</li>
    <li> This is my second time purchasing bio oil. I used it my entire pregnancy and didn&#x27;t receive a single stretch mark. It smells good and feels great on my skin. A bottle is somewhat expensive, but it lasts a super long time. I didn&#x27;t have to replace my previous bottle until I was 7.5 months.</li>
    <li> Effectively prevented stretch marks for me during my pregnancy.</li>
    <li> Everyones body is different so I&#x27;m skeptical when it comes to stuff like this but I was not working for me.</li>
    <li> I tried everything and this is the only product that worked for my dry skin during pregnancy.  Better than the butters etc.</li>
    <li> Heard this was good for chipped or peeling nails. It&#x27;s really great for rough areas like elbows and heels. Absorbs in quickly and doesn&#x27;t feel slimy on skin. Softly scented.</li>
    <li> The product arrived on time and really stopped the itching that I was experiencing.  This stuff really works!</li>
    <li> VERY GOOD STUFF helps so much with my skin thanks :)</li>
    <li> great oil! I use it on my face and legs, and It smells so good! I heard its suppose to help aging,  and wrinkles. We will see! (:</li>
    <li> I love love love this thing!!!! I thought it was all a scam but I&#x27;ve been proven wrong. I swear by this oil, it works!</li>
    <li> I Love it! This is a great product! I told my friends about it and they all bought sum too!</li>
    <li> Awesome and Cheap. Gets rid of age spot and stretch marks. You HAVE to put it on 2 times a day, and do this everyday. Otherwise you will not see results. I have horrible allergy&#x27;s and this does not bother my skin at all.</li>
    <li> I am in love with Bio Oil.  For years I have fought dry aging skin on my arms.  One month of using this product and my life has changed.  I no longer feel like I have to wear long sleeves wherever I go.</li>
    <li> Great Product- with Delivery!!</li>
    <li> I have been using this oil on my belly and breast area since the day I got pregnant. Twice a day, every single day. I am 37 weeks right now and still not a single stretch mark. I love the texture and the smell.</li>
    <li> It makes my skin feel smooth, not sticky. My friend in New Mexico sent me some to try and I liked it, and ordered it.</li>
    <li> I put this on several new scars on my face and top of my foot.  I&#x27;m really happy with the way it made my skin feel.</li>
    <li> This product caused severe skin irritation.</li>
    <li> Very impressed ive been using now for only a month and im starting too see results it is definitely worth your money keep up the Good work👍👍</li>
    <li> It works great on scars. It helped me a few burning scars. Also works great on face stains. one of a kind!</li>
    <li> This product did not really work at al. It was super oily and I used it for like a month with NO results.</li>
    <li> Bought this when I was having my first child. It worked great, no stretch marks on my tummy. I would recommend to any pregant ladies, but please do not scratch.</li>
    <li> I used this while pregnant hoping not to get any stretch marks. It worked great up until my 32nd week! :) Not sure if it was just inevitable. It has a great smell so I didn&#x27;t mind oiling down twice a day!</li>
    <li> iT REALLY WORKS TO HELP HEAL OLD AND NEW SCARS. WELL WORTH THE PRICE. I DO APPLY IT TO SCARS EVERYDAY. LOVE IT, LOVE IT, LOVE IT</li>
    <li> Ive been using this off and on for a month , mostly at nights and I haven&#x27;t seen any significant change. However it did make my skin softer and has a nice scent. Maybe if i used it every single night I would have noticed more of a change. I plan on trying for another month and more diligently.</li>
    <li> So far I&#x27;ve been using it for about 3 weeks now and I haven&#x27;t seen any changes. I am kind of disappointed because doesn&#x27;t work as good as the palmers cocoa butter lotion at walgreens or walmart. I guess it doesn&#x27;t work as good for me but I will continue to use it because I already bought it and I don&#x27;t want to throw it away just yet.</li>
    <li> I actually use this for removing eye makeup and eye lash glue.  Works great!  So Happy I found it online.</li>
    <li> I read reviews on how this helped reduce the appearance of stretch marks so I thought I would give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;This product is amazing. I use it twice a day on my lower stomach on my pregnancy stretch marks and it takes time but there is definately a difference. Dont get me wrong, they didnt disappear but they are lighter and not as stretched looking. I also use this on my face and it helps hydrate it.</li>
    <li> used religiously on my face and stretchmarks but didn&#x27;t see dramatic results--perhaps it works on fresh marks and is better for preventative. i&#x27;ve switched to baby oil which about does as much as this for less money</li>
    <li> Not noticing a HUGE difference but I haven&#x27;t been using it very long. I guess you have to give it time &amp; I have to be consistent &amp; with the warmer weather, the last thing I want to do is put oil on my stomach. So...I think I am going to start doing it in the morning when it is cooler. That may make it easier on me &amp; more likely for me to stick to a routine!</li>
    <li> It is obviously not a miracle but after only 4 days I am seeing slight improvement. I am confident that in short time that the stretch marks on my hips will fade away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just for background in case you are wondering if this product is for your situation, the stretch marks on my hips were caused by puberty (I believe). I have pretty large hips, and it happened quickly so this oil helps if your looking for it to fix something along those lines.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope this helps! :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update***&lt;br /&gt;I have been using it for a week or so now and they really are fading nicely. I will definitely buy this product again if/when I need more. Not even a quarter way through the bottle yet! I was expecting it to not last as long because of the price, but between the amount you get and the results this is the best stuff ever! Haha</li>
    <li> I have not purchased this item recently but, I do remember when I previously used it...It was life-changing. My stretch Marks looked like they had been erased literally. No exaggerations here. They just vanished. I fell in love with the product instantly. After the first week is when I saw my results. I recommend if you don&#x27;t have this product to purchase it now because, it gives you amazing results that you would not believe. I am going to purchase this again because, I have some stretch marks that need to be taken care of and acne scars. Which this is also good for. BOTTOM LINE RECOMMEND IT! PLEASE BUY THIS PRODUCT!</li>
    <li> Makes my skin silky and smooth!  I used it for 2 months and did not see a reduction in scarring, though.</li>
    <li> This product works amazing. It has helped diminish my scar each week. I love it!! Would highly recommend it to have it for anything.</li>
    <li> I have bad acne scars since I have always picked or scratched my face when acne had showed up and this product worked amazingly fast! My acne scars have gone down so quickly and are lightening day by day from every use! I would recommend this for everyone who has had problems with acne scars! 😊😊</li>
    <li> this thing is like a miracle in a bottle! cleared my face, smoothed it out, got rid of acne scars... i loved it so much that i decided to order 2 more at a larger size. :)</li>
    <li> I just started using it again and I hope it works this time around. The first time I bought it I didn&#x27;t apply it as much as I should have, but now I apply it twice daily and I hope to see results in the next 1-3 months like I read in other reviews.  It is very easy to apply. My stretch marks have been on my body for forever and I know that those are the harder ones to get rid of, so I am just praying for the best results.</li>
    <li> I love the smell and its not as oily as I thought it would be. I will be purchasing more for sure.</li>
    <li> I had already bought this product in store and online before but it worked exactly as i expected. I applied 2 times a day during my pregnancy along with plamers cocoa butter and i did not get any stretch marks.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent product that works wonders for all skin issues.  It is a light weight non-greasy oil that is beneficial for all ages and ethnic backgrounds. It is an incredible value and a must have for any blemish, scar or unpleasant mark</li>
    <li> ITs too small to see if it worked, but I liked how it feels and how it smells I should have kept using it, maybe some other time.</li>
    <li> used this oil on my nephew&#x27;s discolored skin due to previous scarring from a burn that had healed over, with amazing results. no one could ever tell that the skin had any problems.</li>
    <li> nada, nothing happening.  alot of rubbing.  didn&#x27;t do much but it does smell nice</li>
    <li> I have used it for 2 weeks, it makes my skin very soft and nice, is not thick and it absorbs very quick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;my skin is very soft. I decreased the use to once a week on my face bc I was braking out!.</li>
    <li> removed former stretch mark coloration and prevented more from showing up this time around</li>
    <li> Was only using for about two weeks before I noticed how much my stretchmarks have faded! Would definatly recommend! Also smells good which is a plus!</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t seen much of a difference as yet...waiting on a few more weeks of using products to see hopefully viable results....love the smell of this oil though.</li>
    <li> Any other oils that people recommend?</li>
    <li> Works great for pregnancy</li>
    <li> I used Bio Oil the first day I found out I was pregnant.  Two, sometimes three times a day.  Never received one stretch mark!!!  Works great.  I would recommend to anyone that is pregnant or is planning to become pregnant.  Good Luck!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product on a burn scar for about a month and it seems to have improved the look of the scar. I heal horribly, but this scar is already smaller and less noticeable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some people may not love the smell of Bio-Oil, but I adore it. It&#x27;s soft and cinnamon-y. The oil itself is thin and rubs in easily without feeling greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is that I received an unboxed bottle. Because of this, I have no way of verifying that the product is legit/untampered.</li>
    <li> This is an awesome product.i will difinitely recommend</li>
    <li> This stuff is awesome. It helped tremendously with those pesky stretch marks from pregnancy. Wish I would have bought sooner!</li>
    <li> Made my skin feel so soft and some red marks left behind have lightened up and it appears that the scaring is diminishing</li>
    <li> Good for your scares and smells nice!</li>
    <li> I love this Oil, I have only been using it for 2 days and I can already feel the difference in my Skin. I use it for my face and stretch marks and it absorbs quickly and leaves a light fragrance. I have been looking for a Oil like this for a while now and finally came across it. I use it twice a day and also at night before I go to bed, hope to see better results. So Yes, I recommend this to anyone.</li>
    <li> I use this on scars and they are disappearing.</li>
    <li> I have just started using it, on a burn I have had for a while. Not sure if it works yet</li>
    <li> I have used this through out my pregnancy and so far I have no stretch marks! I am in my third trimester!</li>
    <li> This was recommended to me by my friend she doesn&#x27;t have any stretch marks during her pregnancy and even after delivery! I started using it two weeks ago, I&#x27;m on my last month of 2nd trimester and I don&#x27;t see any stretch marks popping out until now! I think it works for me and definitely will use this until after giving birth! Nice product!</li>
    <li> Just started using it and am finding it absorbs nicely and you don&#x27;t need to use much.  Use it twice a day for at least 8 weeks.</li>
    <li> Use it for stretch marks during and after pregnancy...it makes the skin super soft and lightens stretch marks and scars</li>
    <li> I have used this product everyday for 3 weeks, and have noticed a lightening/diminishing of my stretch marks. Very happy I will purchase this product again.</li>
    <li> Fantastic oil for every skin issue.</li>
    <li> Good Product. My skin is getting better!</li>
    <li> BEST STUFF EVER!  I use it at the end of my shower, Im 50….and i honestly have people ask me all the time that are younger and feel their skin looks older…..what i use, i say Bio-Oil...</li>
    <li> All My cravings are going away!!! And I did myself less and less hungry!!!! I&#x27;m really enjoying it! Great product</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure why I got this.  I used it for a little while, but then I didn&#x27;t feel right about using it anymore.  It has way too many chemicals in it, and that just can&#x27;t be good for you to put on your body long-term.  Not okay.  There are too many other great options for scars that can be organic - like simply using coconut oil.</li>
    <li> Came with no package , no seal. I don&#x27;t know whether I could use it or not, finally decided to throw away.</li>
    <li> Crap crap crap! This mess doesn&#x27;t work and I kept buying bottle after bottle trying for months. Seen no progress what&#x27;s so ever. What a waste</li>
    <li> I can honestly say I didn&#x27;t have high hopes since I have tried plenty of other products trying to fade my stretch marks, with that being said I haven&#x27;t even been using this product maybe a month now and I have already seen a rather big difference! My stretch marks have faded by quite a bit! It also helps that it dries faster than most creams and oils I have tried before and it has a rather pleasant smell :D if you have scars, or stretch marks I suggest you give it a try its totally worth it!</li>
    <li> I have only been using this product for 2 days and it is already making the stretch marks fading. Also, I got the product 2 weeks earlier than it was suppose to be in, that is AWESOME!!!</li>
    <li> I am still in the process of reviewing this product but as of now, I love it! I have been using it for 3 months now and have seen big improvements in the acne scares on my face. I have recently started using it as my night time, anti-aging serum and am hoping to see good results from it! I have acne prone skin, especially along my jaw line and mouth and this does not break me out at all! Will definitely be repurchasing!</li>
    <li> I have used this product for three years and love it...bought as gifts this year!  Really helps fade skin discolorations without bleach.</li>
    <li> I like it, but it didn&#x27;t do much.  Good go to moisturizing oil.  I was hoping it would heal two scars I got last summer (about 7 or 8 months ago).  No effect.  After a few days of using baby lotion with vitamin e, the marks are fading, so this product really kind of does nothing, but it smells nice and it might be good for something.  I saw a tutorial for rehabilitating a cheap weave using this in shampoo.  Her weave looked great!</li>
    <li> Seems to be doing its job! I will be repurchasing again when I run out. and I would recommend to others!</li>
    <li> didn&#x27;t work as well i expected</li>
    <li> Fantastic scar oil. smells great. use as hair smoother, baby lotion, make up remover, dry feet etc. great product</li>
    <li> Seems to be working well thus far.</li>
    <li> Very fast shipping &amp; delivery. I was using cocoa butter but wasn&#x27;t seeing the results I wanted on my post-pregnancy stretch marks. Bio-oil is not at all oily and it doesn&#x27;t feel wet under my clothes. It has a nice smell but not overpowering. And a little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> I was so skeptical of putting straight oil on my face but it was one of the best decisions I ever made for my skin. I have never had great facial skin and part of my New Years resolution is to really work on that. I am prone to deep cyst like blemishes that leave their red mark long after they are gone. A Google search brought me to this stuff (a dermatologist claimed it was my best choice for fresh scars). I was so afraid because I will get a zit if I even sleep in my makeup for one night, never mind apply oil. I started with a small patch on my cheeks at first- a red spot that was haunting me for months. I thought I was seeing things the next morning when it was noticeably faded. I kept questioning myself that maybe the scar wasn&#x27;t as bad as I remembered? Then the next morning it was even lighter. I hadn&#x27;t started breaking out so I started using the oil a little more liberally. My skin is GLOWING these days. I have NEVER had such amazing texture- silky, flush (not red, just... glowy), smooth, and even. And not one single pimple since I started (I use in conjunction with a popular otc acne medicine that was so-so on its own). I stopped using expensive department store moisturizers to try bio oil. I am a believer.</li>
    <li> Wow this has helped me with my stretch marks that i got after hitting puberty! I tried everything to help fade them atleast. I almost gave up till i came across this oil! It really softens and evens out skin tone within time. Please never stop makin this product!!!</li>
    <li> Mrs. Bry-Man here:  I originally ordered this hoping it would help reduce an ugly scar on one of my knuckles, but I have found it works wonders on hydrating out fine lines and the &amp;#34;papery&amp;#34; look that I had begun to see around my eyes/eyelids.  I just gently pat it on around my eyes twice a day.  (I&#x27;ll be 50 next month, and my age is showing in my facial skin.)&lt;br /&gt;Can&#x27;t say it&#x27;s really done anything for my knuckle scar, I apply the oil to it at least twice a day, but my hands are always in and out of water so much around the house that it may not have much chance to soak in and show a change.</li>
    <li> I had some success with BIO Oil before with some hyper-pigmentation. I am using it again to see if I can achieve the same results or better.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for weeks now, and I have to say that I am pleasantly surprised at just how wonderful it is!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin just seems to totally drink it in. It does not leave your skin with a greasy feel -- just soft and refreshed. The smell is light and disappears quickly. I have also noticed a beneficial change to the texture and appearance of my skin, and I deinitely plan on purchasing this product again!</li>
    <li> I ordered this to get rid of scars, but I can&#x27;t really tell if it&#x27;s working or not. I&#x27;m still using it but I can&#x27;t tell if they are fading. This product does make my skin super soft though. It also smells really nice.</li>
    <li> Not sure about this yet .... Smells and feels like baby oil.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s works like magic</li>
    <li> I like bio oil my family in Scotland use it and after being home I started to order and use it also, its a nice oil for your whole body.&lt;br /&gt;I love it. Thank you Amazon seller.</li>
    <li> I love the way it makes my skin feel and I hope that in the next few mo. I will see some change, i seems to be working in some areas. But I think its for problem skin, during a pregancy...</li>
