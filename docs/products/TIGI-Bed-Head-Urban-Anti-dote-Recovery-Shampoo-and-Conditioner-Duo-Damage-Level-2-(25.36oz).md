<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I have thick curly hair and this shampoo and conditioner has done wonders! My hair doesn&#x27;t get nearly as frizzy and even my hair dresser has noticed a difference in how my hair feels!</li>
    <li> Great products - love them, thank yo&lt;br /&gt;u</li>
    <li> I was sceptical at first that this would be truly hydrating but not anymore. This stuff is perfect. It makes my hair so soft and smooth AND it smells amazingly good. The scent is citrusy . Tons of lather with the shampoo with no scalp irritation ( I have an extremely sensitive scalp) and the conditioner creates a lot of slip so hair easily untangles. I highly recommend this duo :)</li>
    <li> Smells delicious and makes my hair more soft and manageable. Definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> Love this shampoo &amp; conditioner</li>
    <li> We love this product, I buy it ALL the time.  It is  a great conditioner and shampoo combo!  Works wonderful!!</li>
    <li> Conditions my dry and itchy scalp.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff, makes my over treated hair very soft.</li>
    <li> I love the products, they arrived quickly.</li>
    <li> I have platnium blonde hair, that has damage to the ends(not fried though). I was using the Bed Head Dumb Blonde &amp; That left my hair weighted down &amp; sorta oily. Then I bought this duo. I have used it several times, and I&#x27;m addicted! It leaves my hair sooooo soft &amp; very clean feeling. My hair gets oily very fast&#x27; but since using this my hair stays cleaner longer. Also I have noticed that when I comb,brush,blow dry, &amp; flat iron my hair I have very little hair breaking off, before I would be covered in hair. I&#x27;m not sure what the smell is, kind of a clean laundry berry smell, Veryyyyy pleasing though. It stays in your hair after drying too, which is not a problem for me.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this to every blonde out there, or anyone with damaged hair!&lt;br /&gt;**UPDATE**&lt;br /&gt;After using this for awhile my hair has gotten tired of it. Which usually happens with every shampoo/conditioner I buy. I still 100% recommend :)</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo and conditioner. I&#x27;ve used both the level 1 &amp; 2 of this line but can&#x27;t say I really notice much difference between the two. I have fine, straight hair and this set leaves my hair soft, shiny, and smooth. I&#x27;ve also used it on my daughters who have very curly hair and had good results with them as well. The reason I buy the level 2 over the level 1 is because I prefer this scent, though level 1 smells very fresh and clean too. I would definitely recommend any of the urban antidotes shampoo and conditioner line.</li>
    <li> Love this shampoo and conditioner.  Leaves my hair feeling very soft and shiny.  Bottles last for months!</li>
    <li> It just makes my hair soft and very manageable.</li>
    <li> * After using for months, I have updated my review *  Please do your research first. Many, many products sold on Amazon are knock offs. At first I just had good things to say about this duo (like many of the reviews, probably made hastily and immediately after arrival). Well after using for some months, I started having SEVERE itching on my scalp. I also had flakes. Seriously, my scalp would itch constantly- it was so uncomfortable! Then I visited my hair stylist, and she remarked on the build up on my scalp, despite me barely using any products and keeping my head clean. Yes, these products are much cheaper on me than in store- but ask yourself WHY. I&#x27;m still recovering from my use of these products- and now I&#x27;m only ever purchasing from a salon.</li>
    <li> I have had this for about a month. It seems to be improving my overall hair condition slightly, but not as much as I expected. And I have a few complaints. 1. These do NOT come with the pumps (at least in my case) as asked in several questions and as suggested in several other reviews. 2. I like the smell of the shampoo, but the conditioner smells different. I am not sure if it is because it is an older bottle or if they were designed to smell different, but I wish they both smelled the same (and preferably like the shampoo). 3. My previous experiences with Bed Head shampoo has been very good. I am not sure if it is this type of shampoo from Bed Head or my specific bottles, but I have not been especially impressed with this shampoo. I will be looking for something different next time.</li>
    <li> I absolutely Love this shampoo and conditioner.  I have used alot of different shampoo&#x27;s and conditioner&#x27;s over the years but I have to say this one is the best by far.  Before using this, my hair was really dull and had split ends. My hair dresser started using this on my hair and in one application I could tell a world of difference. Love, love this product..i will not live without it...</li>
    <li> Excellent product with a fair price for what it promises. have not tested it, but from what I read will work perfectly.</li>
    <li> Love this shampoo and this is the best price out there.</li>
    <li> I have killed my hair over and over again by straightening it almost daily. Just one week of using this product has transformed my dry damaged hair into beautiful and soft hair. Even immediately after straightening it, it stays soft and shiny. Would buy it again every single time. GREAT PRODUCT.</li>
    <li> great product for dry curly hair</li>
    <li> I usually ONLY use Biolage Hyrotherapy, and I am in love with this! I have really soft/fine straight hair, and it suffers bc I use a lot of heat on it daily, this shampoo/conditioner duo is like SEX for my hair!</li>
    <li> Great shampoo &amp; conditioner for dry hair.&lt;br /&gt;I also noticed a diff the 1st time I used this. It smells great too</li>
    <li> Drug store brand shampoo&#x27;s started drying out my hair.  so i decided to switch to bedhead. Mostly because it caught my eye.  BUT THIS SHAMPOO CONDITIONER DUO IS AMAZING! I straighten my hair alot, and sometimes my hair ends up smelling burnt or if i go in the sun it smells like its literally burning.  but not with this shampoo.. it smells like a candy vanilla. I love it.  My hair is incredibly moisturized. When i rub the strands together theres no longer that straw dry feeling.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m in my thirties and I&#x27;ve tried a lot of shampoos and conditioners. I&#x27;ve tried cheap, I&#x27;ve tried expensive. I&#x27;ve tried them with all the styling products you can think of..  Here&#x27;s the deal. This set (shampoo + conditioner) REALLY WORKS!!! It has made my hair look better than it has in years. It feels softer, it&#x27;s more managable. It looks less frizzy or damaged. And it smells great.   This stuff is kind of expensive- but it&#x27;s a large amount of product and it REALLY WORKS!  I blowdry and flat iron my straight to wavy hair every single day. I wash and condition every single day. I dye my 50% gray hair every other week (at least the roots). If this stuff works on my hair- it&#x27;ll work on yours.  AND- TIGI doesn&#x27;t test on animals (so there&#x27;s another reason to buy)</li>
    <li> I am a HUGE Bed Head client and at this price it was a smart buy!!!</li>
    <li> My wife loves this product.  We always bought it in retail shops, like Kroger or Ulta, and we tried online for the first time.  We were aware it might not be the real product but, given the excellent price, we decided to take our chances.  It turns out to be it&#x27;s the real thing... we&#x27;ll definitely order again.</li>
    <li> This shampoo/condition work great in my hair. I regularly dye it. I used to use the red bottles, but it made my hair really greasy. These smell really good.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t have a good smell.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my cousin for Christmas and she loves it!!</li>
    <li> Awesome wife very happy nd it&#x27;s really working for her hair!!😃😃😃👍👍👍👍</li>
    <li> For some background, my hair is long (think: bra-band length), frizzy/wavy, and has never been dyed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You know that feeling when you leave the salon and your hair is ridiculously soft and doesn&#x27;t tangle and smells really awesome? This has made my hair like that every day. I love this stuff. I wouldn&#x27;t use it on thin hair, though, as it does seem to weigh my hair down a little. If you have kind of out of control hair, this is a good thing, but if you want your hair to have volume it&#x27;s probably not for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this with a leave in conditioner and no other products and my hair has never looked or felt better. I got a haircut right before switching to this product, and have noticed a decline in how quickly I usually get split ends.</li>
    <li> Smells fantastic.......... and its huge bottles for the cheap price... Unbelieveable.... I love it..........</li>
    <li> Conditioner top was broken when I received.</li>
    <li> LOVE THIS SHAMPOO.  It smells wonderful and makes my hair so soft.  And it&#x27;s a great price.  Definitely worth it.</li>
    <li> I received my new shampoo/conditioner and still had some left from the salon so I used the new product just to try it out. I used it twice because I didn&#x27;t think I used the conditioner. I then used my old bottle these are two completely different products. I will never purchase hair products online again. Lesson learned.</li>
    <li> I thought I couldn&#x27;t go wrong with this set given the number of great reviews but I didn&#x27;t find this shampoo and conditioner to be anywhere near as good as even $7 John Frieda shampoo from Target. This shampoo felt like it was making my hair too clean- like all my natural oils were stripped and the conditioner didn&#x27;t leave my hair feeling like it had any moisture whatsoever. After showering I had to spend way longer than usual detangling. Not for me. I&#x27;ll go back to the Enjoy Luxury shampoo and conditioner I was using before.</li>
    <li> So, this works great and smells great if your hair is NOT bleached or damaged.  I bought it when I had bleached ombre ends, and it dried the ends out even more than they already were.  I switched to sulfate free shampoo and put these away.  Recently, I cut off the bleached portion of my hair and took these back out and used them on my unprocessed hair and it worked just great.  I like the smell, too.</li>
    <li> I ADORE this. It smells wonderful and significantly improved the strength of my fine, overly processed hair. I bleach and dye my hair on a regular basis and as a result it breaks and splits very easily. The Recovery Shampoo and Conditioner work wonders for not only keeping things from getting worse but repairing some of the existing damage.</li>
    <li> Great shampoo.  I didn&#x27;t initially love the smell but it definitely smells clean.  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I was about out of my normal product (davines) and a friend won a set from her salon. She wasn&#x27;t going to use it and passed it along to me. I use only good salon product, and figured if it came from her (well reputed) salon, it would be good enough for me to try. I have thick hair and I put it through the ringer. Ringer is no stretch: swimming in chlorinated pools multiple times a week, blow drying, flat ironing, dying. The works. My normal product has kept damage at bay and I usually just have to have the ends dusted. I began using this after my last cut. I usually go 8 weeks, and had to call to move my appointment up. At 6 weeks I had just over 5 inches of frayed ends taken off! I thought that maybe it was because I added another day in the pool, and since it&#x27;s winter I am blow drying more. Nope, I just washed for the first time after my cut. Used this product and my ends are already fraying. Have never seen damage so soon after my cut. Hated to spend the $80 on my normal product as I recently quit my job for grad school, but some corners just can&#x27;t be cut! Lesson learned.</li>
    <li> I love this product. I needed something for my dry over processed hair and this has helped so much. My hair is soft, shiny and hydrated.</li>
    <li> Bought for the boss (wifey) she loves this shampoo set. BUT BEWARE. the picture is cut off at the top for a reason. These bottles do not come with the push down nozzle. It&#x27;s just a plain bottle. It in NO WAY detracts from the fact that this is the same product sold at the salons. I just think they shouldn&#x27;t have posted the  picture the way they did. It&#x27;s a bit misleading in case some people wanted the nozzle. Either way this is a great bargain.</li>
    <li> Love the smell and my hair is so soft</li>
    <li> I was so excited to receive these two items after reading the reviews...the price is great and I know Bed Head is supposed to be amazing. However, I received my order and it was just the shampoo which was marked as conditioner with the sticker. So I was missing the conditioner. I called Customer Care and they said they were unable to replace it so I have to return it for a refund. So disappointed.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this shampoo and conditioner for about 2 months now. I did not purchase it through Amazon, rather I got it from the stylist that did my hair. But I love it so much I had to post a review! I love that it comes with pumpers because it&#x27;s too big of a bottle to try and squeeze the product out. My hair feels so much more healthy now that I&#x27;ve been using it. The scent is kind of... citrus... which was not what I expected from bed head but I love it! Would absolutely recommend this product to anyone that colors/lightens their hair on a regular basis. If you&#x27;re familiar with bed head products, it comparable to \\&quot;dumb blonde\\&quot; in the way it makes your dry/brittle hair feel brand new!</li>
    <li> Love Bead Head! This is one of the best !</li>
    <li> Product is exactly as described but most important was how much cheaper this is compared to ulta/walmart/etc. Great deal if this is your normal shampoo</li>
    <li> Oh my gosh. After using Bed Head level 3 shampoo and conditioner for a while, my hair was getting kinda tired of it, as well as I was getting a little tired of the fake strawberry smell of that stuff. So I thought I would give this a shot. Not only is the smell wonderful, more perfume smelling, but my hair is back to being bouncy. I use this daily, then the level 3 on the weekends. It&#x27;s working great on my hair, making it soft and shiny, while keeping the moisture in. And the fact that TIGI doesn&#x27;t test on animals means no guilt for me. This is a winner in my book!</li>
    <li> Great moisturizer!!! My daughter has tight curly hair, this is the only thing i have found that works this great! Works great on my hsir as well!</li>
    <li> Love bed head products!</li>
    <li> I love bed head so of course I&#x27;m happy, but I thought it came with the pumps, and it didn&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> I love the smell of this and the shipping was quick but I have to give it a three star cause I feel like it&#x27;s drying my hair out instead of helping it.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a gift set, it came with the Ego boost and I am so glad I found this product! I am constanly spending money on products because I want my hair to be shiny, soft and healthy but have never found anything to that until now! I will never use anything else and I literally could not be happier!! This stuff is awesome!</li>
    <li> I normally love TIGI products and have a few other hair products that I have been using for a long time.  I decided to give this shampoo and conditioner a try after reading that it is good for dry hair.  I have naturally wavy, course hair that I straighten twice a week (normally with a flat iron), and the heat has taken it&#x27;s toll on my poor hair.  I was really excited to give this stuff a try after reading the good reviews.  The shampoo and conditioner smell delicious...like it should be a candy or cocktail!  However, the shampoo doesn&#x27;t leave my hair feeling clean at all.  It actually makes my hair feel greasy WHILE I&#x27;m washing it and makes my scalp really flakey and gross once I&#x27;m out of the shower.  Not sure why...maybe I&#x27;m allergic to something that&#x27;s in it, or I just got a bad bottle of shampoo, but I&#x27;ve never had this reaction with anything else I&#x27;ve ever used on my hair...ever!  So I tried experimenting to find out if it was just me and maybe the cold, dry air in the winter months, or if it was the shampoo/conditioner that was causing the flakes.  I switched back to my old shampoo/conditioner, and my hair/scalp went back to normal again!  The next time I washed my hair, I tried my old shampoo, with this TIGI conditioner (on the ends only) and my hair seemed fine.  Then back to the TIGI shampoo/conditioner, and my scalp was gross again.  So, apparently it&#x27;s just the shampoo that&#x27;s the problem, and the conditioner seems to be ok as long as I don&#x27;t massage it in my scalp.  I plan on using my old shampoo and the TIGI conditioner till it runs out, and will try something else next time.  Too bad! :(</li>
    <li> It smells SO good and makes my hair super soft and shiney!</li>
    <li> My hair had been so dry and no shampoo or condition seemed to help.  I tried this and my hair is soft and it moves!  It was so dry it didn&#x27;t seem to move at all, but after using this shampoo and conditioner it feels greats!  Smells really nice, too!  I will be using this from now on!</li>
    <li> This worked okay but not anywhere as good as I thought it would do. It does have a light pleasant scent and you do get a lot for your money in this twin set.</li>
    <li> I received this product three days ago and have since used it twice. The smell is amazing &amp; my hair feels much lighter &amp; all around clean. Especially compared to generic drug store shampoos! The smell is amazing &amp; last a lot longer. A little goes along way with both shampoo &amp; conditioner. (Btw, I have very long thick curly hair that I straighten daily &amp; never use heat protection, so my hair is rather fried but this SO FAR seems to be helping quite a bit!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is that when it arrived both bottles had leaked open &amp; product was all over the bottles. This could have been the post office&#x27;s fault though &amp; the bottles weren&#x27;t busted so it wasn&#x27;t too big of a problem. I really enjoyed the cute little carrying bag that came with it.</li>
    <li> Made my dry, brittle hair come back to life! It had been chemically destroyed, and this combo helped to restore my softness</li>
    <li> Great shampoo for a great price!</li>
    <li> I have normal, non-treated, bra-strap length hair, and this combo works pretty well. I&#x27;m an avid gym goer and have to wash my hair pretty frequently (usually every other day, sometimes everyday). I haven&#x27;t noticed any new dryness in the ends or greasiness in the scalp. The shampoo lathers really well, and the conditioner leaves my hair silky but full of volume. Both products smell lovely, kind of like peaches.</li>
    <li> Usually use a smoothing shampoo so this is a nice change of pace love the smell!  seems to get hair clean without leaving a residue like other shampoos and conditioners</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo and conditioner. Will definitely buy it again! Smells great and leaves my hair silky. Great online price!</li>
    <li> this is a very very great product for my hair.  I use it because it smell terrific and i color my hair and it is a great product.&lt;br /&gt;i would recommend this product to all my friends co workers and family.  I love this product</li>
    <li> Really like this shampoo and the price was very good.</li>
    <li> Completely changed my hair for the better. Love it!</li>
    <li> Just as described! it left my hair completely soft and shinny, i will keep buying it in the future! it works great!</li>
    <li> you cant find this anywhere in stores, but this is the only shampoo and conditioner I use it keeps my hair soft</li>
    <li> good conditioning, great smell</li>
    <li> Love this product. I will order this again it came in fast, If you have curly uncontrollable  hair this is the way to go</li>
    <li> It smells so great! It works great as well. I have \\&quot;blonde\\&quot; hair and I blow dry and straighten my hair just about every day and this helps my hair so much. It also styles real nice while giving my hair body. I normally use Matrix Biolage, once I bought this bed head I won&#x27;t be switching back!!!!</li>
    <li> I bought this hoping that a more expensive brand would make my hair softer and shiner. I was wrong. It did get the knots out of my hair and it smelled good when you were shampooing BUT after it dried the smell completely vanished and in just a few hours my hair started smelling dirty. And it weighed my hair to the extreme. I guess if your hair is naturally overly dry to the point where it takes a week to get oily then it might be fine. But I was highly dissatisfied. After 2 uses I gave it away and went and bought the red bottle of herbal essences off the shelf, which is 20x better. I wouldn&#x27;t suggest wasting your money on this.</li>
    <li> I am white, with extremely thick, extremely problematic, wavy/curly hair.  Picture Bette Midler in the 80&#x27;s.  That&#x27;s me!  This shampoo wasn&#x27;t the best I&#x27;ve ever tried, but it&#x27;s miles better than any other Tigi product for my hair, and I have tried them all.  Great price, too!</li>
    <li> Son likes very much, it is his favorite shampoo. He says the smell is great and he likes the way his hair feels. Nice deal on both items.</li>
    <li> This is our family favorite shampoo and conditioner. The smell is divine. It leaves your hair clean and silky smooth. Helps with dry and over styled hair.</li>
    <li> After reading some great reviews about this product, I decided to give it a try. I was using Bed &amp; Body works brands shampoo/conditioners before, and they kept leaving my hair extremely dry. I had high hopes for this product and it did a fine job of de-tangling my very frizzy hair, but left it extremely dry, just like the other shampoos. The smell is very pleasant and the product is not greasy, but I need a lot more moisturizing power.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do not recommend for dry hair.</li>
    <li> Love the fragrance &amp; the feel of my hair when I use these shampoos.  Great price tooooooo!</li>
    <li> Love the smell and the results I get using this shampoo and conditioner. My hairdresser uses only TIGI products and I can understand why.</li>
    <li> This is the product I have been using for years. I bought it with a good price. It is an excellent product.</li>
    <li> The price is extremely affordable! At my local hair salons the prices for 1 bottle range between $25-$30. Shipping was extremely fast. Love this shampoo and will definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> Love the TIGI Bed Head Urban Anti-dote Recovery Shampoo &amp; Conditioner. Leaves my hair soft and smells excellent. Excellent product!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t love it as much as I loved moisture maniac, but I do like it. Smells great. Cleans well.</li>
    <li> I fell in love with the scent of this shampoo and conditioner when it was used on my hair at a local salon.  When I turned around to see what she used, I was shocked to see &amp;#34;Bed Head&amp;#34; since I was actually familiar with the brand.  I bought some for myself and have been using it for the past couple years and still love the scent.  I subtracted 1 star because it does seem to make my scalp pretty dry... but I do have rather dry skin in the wintertime to start with.</li>
    <li> One of my favorite shampoos ever. Love the smell and leaves my hair silky smooth and soft. Makes hair very easy to brush through.</li>
    <li> This is a great TIGI product. This is a fantastic deal for 1 liter bottles.  I order this every 2-3 months (depending on usage) and will do so until they quit offering it (or TIGI comes up with another product that I like better) :)</li>
    <li> Just tried this shampoo (don&#x27;t have the conditioner) for the first time (with a different conditioner), and my hair feel amazing.  I didn&#x27;t even buy it on Amazon, but my hair feels so soft that I wanted to comment about this shampoo somewhere.  I&#x27;m now tempted to stock-up and maybe try the conditioner, too.  I have very long, untreated hair.  I am in love with this shampoo.  Enjoy!  .. if you already have a conditioner you love, try the shampoo with that, too.  Either way, I will be repurchasing this shampoo!  :)</li>
    <li> I LOVE this shampoo and conditioner. My stylist suggested I try it after my color and highlighting and I absolutely love it!  It leaves my hair so soft and healthy. I can&#x27;t imagine using anything else.</li>
    <li> My hair feels great!!!</li>
    <li> this is a great product- hands down.  Scent, effective, volume, value.  You can&#x27;t beat this price- cheaper than two smaller bottles at salon!</li>
    <li> I can never live without this ever again!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It makes my hair soft, shiny and smells amazing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My bottles lasted almost a whole year, so the price really worth it.</li>
    <li> I really like it and it makes my hair more smooth</li>
    <li> I really love this shampoo and even though it is a little bit expensive I care about my hair. I found great offers in amazon.com with this product.</li>
    <li> I would recommend this for anyone who wants their hair to feel soft, silky, and dead end free. Love TIGI Shampoo and conditioner products. They serve my order quickly and I get my delivery on time as they say I will. I will never go to any other Shampoo or Conditioner. Fabulous for the fabulous hair you desire.</li>
    <li> The first time I tried this shampoo&amp;conditioner combo, I absolutely fell in love. It really is the &amp;#34;ultimate recovery&amp;#34;. I picked it up for $14.99 a bottle at Marshalls, and when I ran out I had to get some more immediately. I could definitely tell the difference in my hair in the amount of time it took me to get some more. The problem was, they didn&#x27;t have it any more at Marshalls, and at ULTA it was like $27 PER BOTTLE! So I checked around, and the best price I found was here on Amazon. It may be more expensive than pantene or herbal essences, but I&#x27;m telling you, this stuff really works. Smells great, transforms hair, fantastic product all around.</li>
    <li> Happy with the product</li>
    <li> I love the product but it had leaked during shipping, so I returned it.</li>
    <li> I have to wash my hair twice a day because of my job, and this Shampoo and conditioner keeps the moisture in my hair! Has a great smell that lasts too!</li>
    <li> I dye my hair, and recently used a different brand (Feria) to try and achieve a brighter red....and it resulted in my hair breaking off left and right. Not the normal full strands falling (which is normal), but little 2-3 inch pieces of hair just breaking off. I purchased this hoping it would help repair the damage. It is not bad...it just did not moisturize as well as I had hoped, and if I did not put Argan oil in my hair before blow drying, my hair was like straw. It smells great, just did not work on my hair type (long and thin).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My daughter is bi-racial, so I gave it to her to try, and it works great at moisturizing her hair....she actually has movement after using this shampoo/conditioner combination, even before putting any products in her hair, so at least the purchase did not go to waste.</li>
    <li> Very moisturizing! Worked well!</li>
    <li> I have a lot of allergies.  This product worked very well.</li>
    <li> Package came quickly and I received exactly what is pictured.  I just wish it came with the pumps for easier use.</li>
    <li> Felt like it left residue in my hair. Didn&#x27;t really improve the condition of my hair at all.</li>
    <li> I have very thick, dry hair. I do like this product but I like TIGI Bed Head Urban Antidote in the green bottle much better, it seems to leave less deposit on my hair.</li>
    <li> My hair care specialist recomended that I try a higher quality product for my hair, so I settled on Bed Head Recovery. I&#x27;ve used it for approx. a month and I have no complaints. My hair feels clean and smooth and smells pretty dang good. I would recomend it.</li>
    <li> The one pump came cracked, but otherwise all good! Came as pictured, exactly as I was expecting. Thanks so much!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this shampoo/conditioner for about two years now.  I highlight, blow-dry, and flat iron my medium/long hair - so it needs more TLC, and I love this shampoo and conditioner.  I noticed an immediate difference in my hair being more manageable and looking healthier.  This is also a product that your hair won&#x27;t really tire of.  While the conditioner does it&#x27;s job, your hair does not feel weighed down at all.  Both the shampoo and conditioner smell great - the 25 oz. sizes last me about 2.5 months, and I shampoo and condition almost daily.</li>
    <li> The best shampoo and conditioner I have ever used! Leaves your hair soft, shiny and silky! I have curly hair and have never had a shampoo leave my hair this soft! The seller was excellent! The first one they sent was leaking and they quickly sent me a new one. Very satisfied!</li>
    <li> This is my favorite shampoo and conditioner. It makes my hair soft and doesn&#x27;t feel like it weighs it down.  It also gives me more volume and I notice less hair breakage, which is great because my hair is thin. Plus it smells amazing!</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing.  I have frizzy hair that is sometimes hard to manage, but this makes it soft, shiny and healthy.</li>
    <li> Love the smell and the way my hair feels after I use it.  It is so silky and soft.  My husband loves the shampoo too.</li>
    <li> Best Conditioner EVER! Makes your hair silky smooth, salon quality!</li>
    <li> Great product delivered exactly as when i purchased them a year ago. only issue was the conditioner leaked out a little because there was no packaging on the pump tips so it got banged around on the way to my house by UPS but still got to give 4 stars because it was a great price for a great shampoo &amp; conditioner combo first introduced to me in a fancy hair saloon</li>
    <li> This product made my scalp so itchy that I could not finish the bottle.</li>
    <li> Product was diluted and crap. Once I started using it noticed a difference in smell and consistency and then my hair took a turn for the worst. I bought new bottles from my stylist and compared to have proof it was diluted. Never again will I buy on amazon because of this seller. The diluted product is on left and the real product on right.</li>
    <li> Quality shampoo and conditioner.</li>
    <li> I have asthma and severe allergies to certain smells and chemicals. They are so severe that I have a very difficult time finding products that do not make me ill on contact. That is why this shampoo and conditioner is a God Send! It not only doesn&#x27;t make me sick, but it leaves my hair very soft and shiny! Will be using this product over and over, again!</li>
    <li> Love how my hair feels and manages after using this duo</li>
    <li> After having to put my hair up in a bun every day in the Afghan heat, it became so dry and damaged. I started to use this shampoo/conditioner set and now my hair is soft and shiny again.  I also love the smell! It reminds me of fruity bublicious gum I used to chew when I was a kid.</li>
    <li> The product smells so good, but it is expired!</li>
    <li> This shampoo really moisturizes and tames the frizz!</li>
    <li> I just love what this shampoo &amp; conditioner does to my hair!</li>
    <li> Bed Head make great products and this duo is just as great as all their other lines.</li>
    <li> Definitely worth getting! Left my hair smelling fantastic and super soft! Also works great for my color treated hair. Fast shipping, too!</li>
    <li> Great shampoo and conditioner.</li>
    <li> A little more pricey than the average Walmart shampoo &amp; conditioner but definitely worth it.  I have used this for years in the past and took a little break for about 6 months (sheer lack of patience ordering online &amp; waiting)  Recently ordered again and it&#x27;s complete night and day difference with my hair.  Softer, shinier, healthier!</li>
    <li> I am working in Afghanistan and between the sun, heat, water, etc...my hair had become extremely dry.  I purchased these items mainly based on the reviews.  After just one use, my hair isn&#x27;t as dry as it was.  I am truly amazed on the difference in the look and feel of my hair.  I would highly recommend this product and will continue to use it once i get home.</li>
    <li> ABSOLUTELY the BEST shampoo and conditioner from bed head! Smells great and leaves your hair soft but you can still style your hair. Some shampoo and conditioners leave your hair soft and it wont hold a curl, not this one. You can style your hair as normal and it hold. (Of course other products are required to help hold the style.)</li>
    <li> I really love my recovery shampoo set. My hair feels amazing. It does not feel as dry and it even helped even my blonde tone a bit. Will buy more from seller.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing. Your hair will look and feel like you just left the salon. You will love the smell also. I love it !!</li>
    <li> I love, love, love this stuff! Not only is it a great value but it works really great and smells great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It leaves my hair really soft and has really improved my dry hair!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will continue to by and definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> What can I say?  I love TIGI Bed Head products, they always make my hair look and feel great and this product is no exception.  I have color treated, very fine hair that has a tendency to dry out very easily so I really need to take good care of it if I want it to look good and be healthy and Bed Head always does the trick.  This TIGI Urban Antidote Recovery also smells fantastic!      I got this set for a great price right here on Amazon.  If you&#x27;re thinking of trying it, I personally would highly recommend you do. If your hair is anything like mine, you will love it!</li>
    <li> Purchased this for my wife and her best friend.  Both have long hair. Both use almost exclusively Tigi Bed Head products (with very good results), but this one for some reason has just been drying their hair out...</li>
    <li> Wow! The first thing I fell in love with was the scent! Smells SO good! My hair is super silky soft, frizz free and smells wonderful after 1 use! Better than any shampoo and conditioner I&#x27;ve ever used. Highly recommend this product  :)</li>
    <li> Hey bed head and cheap. LOVE!!!</li>
    <li> I got this instead of the Level 3 shampoo because that one was making my hair insanely oily on my off-shower days (I shower every other day when possible so as to not damage my hair). This one seems to hydrate just as well without the oiliness (I have thick, color-damaged hair) of the Level 3 Urban Renewal products and smells awesome - more citrusy than the cherry-like other one! I use it in conjunction with Biolage Conditioning Balm (use this shampoo, then put this conditioner on my roots and Biolage on my ends) and Biotin supplements and my hair has gone from a frizzy wreck to manageable in the past 6 months. Thank God for Tigi products.</li>
    <li> Thank you would buy again</li>
    <li> MADE MY HAIR STRAIGHT &amp; WIREY</li>
    <li> I bought this six months ago, it&#x27;s still not empty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;... I shower every other day. Promise.</li>
    <li> This product rescued me from the worst hair disaster I have seen in my 33 years.  I have done hair straightening, bleaching, drastic colour changes.  Now I have bleached thick curly blonde hair.  I have been on the path to repair my hair from the last bleaching session.  I had purchased a high end shampoo, and it dried out my hair, and it started breaking off in the shower.  Two times into using these Bed Head recovery products, my hair is starting to see the light of day, the consistency, sheen, and silkiness is starting to return to  my natural state of healthy being, and my hair started to quit braking off.  I have found in these  Bed Head products a consistent and reliable shampoo to help out with my consistantly punished hair.  I should have gone with my instinct and gone back to bed head, since I had another miraculous moment at age 19 with their now out of production, Control Freak products.  I would say, Recovery is a perfect replacement for Control Freak.</li>
    <li> Amazing i love it wonderful price and great products.</li>
    <li> My hair feels silky after!</li>
    <li> Loved the price on this item when I bought it (around $20)!  It&#x27;s a great shampoo and perfect for colored hair.</li>
    <li> I am truly amazed at the results after using this product for the very first time.&lt;br /&gt;I have dry, curly frizzy hair thats actually quite thin. Bought this today after my hair stylist used it on me and told me it could add a lot of moisture to dry damaged hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I blow dry and iron my hair out flat a lot, but today after the whole process was done I am shocked at how shiny , smooth and sleek my hair is.&lt;br /&gt;I keep touching it as I am amazed by it.&lt;br /&gt;This product definitely works for what it promises to do with dry, damaged hair.</li>
    <li> Smells great. Makes my hair very soft.  Great price on the shampoo and continuer bundle. Will buy this product again and again.</li>
    <li> It made my hair real soft, it smells good, I didn&#x27;t need a lot, it came a few days earlier than expected. The price for 2 on Amazon was what 1 bottle costs in the store/salon. GREAT STUFF!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Great shampoo and conditinoer for my color damaged hair. It is making it smoother and more manageable with every wash. Glad I was told about this product.</li>
    <li> Great for my super dry hair</li>
    <li> I love how soft and relaxed my hair felt! I tried so MANY shampoos and conditioners but they don&#x27;t seem to work with my hair. I decided to try this and it works AWESOMELY well with my hair! I use bed head after party cream afterwards and my hair is so smooth! Tamed a lot of frizz! I recommend this product!</li>
    <li> Amazing shampoo and conditioner</li>
    <li> Great smells, seemly great product, worth the price. It made my scalp super dry, however so I had to switch to a new brand.</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo and conditioner! It smells great and my hair is always tangle free.</li>
    <li> I love this product. My hair is much better since I use it!</li>
    <li> First off I love the scent secondly it does wonders to clean and moisturize my dry unruly hair</li>
    <li> It is by far my favorite shampoo and conditioner. It smells so good and the conditioner is to die for. I dye my hair every 2 months and curl it most days so my hair gets a lot of treatment and the conditioner is perfect for everything I put my hair through!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this shampoo/condition for approximately 3-4 months. I stopped for awhile (ran out) and was using other retail products and nothing compares. My hair is naturally slightly curly/kinky and dry. As soon as I switched back it was amazing how soft and more manageable my hair is. Much cheaper at Amazon than buying in store (except sometimes at TJ MAX you can find a good deal). Love the way it smells. I know some people do not like the strong smell, but I personally (someone who uses a lot of products) appreciates that I can still smell the shampoo after styling.</li>
    <li> Not sure this is the real deal - I have used this product for many years and this shipment doesn&#x27;t perform like any I have used in the past. Will not purchase again.</li>
    <li> I have color treated hair and not only does this shampoo smell great, it makes my hair really shiny! My hair has not looked this healthy in a really long time...</li>
    <li> I bought this product because my daughter uses it (we are both bottled blondes lol). My hair is thinner than hers, and this product is a little too heavy for my hair. It&#x27;s great if you have thick damaged hair, she swears by it. It smells AMAZING, which depresses me because I want to use it but I can&#x27;t!</li>
    <li> its great to promote quality products and this brand of Shampoor and Conditioners are one. The shipment arrived as scheduled, I like fast delivery... So 5 stars all around.</li>
    <li> my hair feels so awesome I touch it more often and giggle. doesn&#x27;t get better than that. bed head for life!!</li>
    <li> I bleach the absolute S*** out of my hair. I change the color very often (every 3-4 weeks) and this totally saved my hair after intense bleaching. Pricey but totally worth it if you abuse your hair. And smells delicious! Highly recommend. It&#x27;s also cruelty free which I like!</li>
    <li> After bleaching my hair and frying it this shampoo and conditioner has really helped. I really recommend.</li>
    <li> This shampoo transformed my hair into a more smoother and thicker state. My hair used to be too dry. I also believe it helped with the growing part. I do cut my split ends an inch every 6 months and when I started using this, it drastically helped grow my hair longer/faster than usual. I couldn&#x27;t even believe it!!!  reason why I gave it a 4 as opposed to a 5 star is because it leaves my hair a tad bit tangled, but I think that might be due to not brushing my hair every single day.</li>
    <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE! I always had really nice, long healthy hair and after highlights, it became dry and brittle-it broke easily and hard to brush!&lt;br /&gt;I have tried many different products and conditioners in an attempt to rectify what I&#x27;ve done. After only the first time of usage, I noticed a big difference! Hair was much softer, easy to brush, and feels great! Plus it smells really good! Hair Recovery is definitely the right name here!</li>
    <li> Wonderful it has helped alot with my extra dry hair.</li>
    <li> Just wanted to let you know the shampoo was open and it was a huge mess:(</li>
    <li> love this product...great smell!</li>
    <li> My favorite hair product! Leaves hair clean, smelling amazing and doesn&#x27;t make your hair oily the next day. Causes fewer split ends and makes hair extremely soft!</li>
    <li> Great shampoo and conditioner!</li>
    <li> Good Product, right price.  It smells pretty good too.  I like the way it makes my hair feel and smell after using.</li>
    <li> I bought this shampoo for my fiancée and I to use and it works wonderfully. I&#x27;ve noticed the difference in the texture of my hair after using it and the smell is very relaxing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product to anybody with damaged hair.</li>
    <li> I bought it before, and I just couldn&#x27;t stay away from this shampoo and conditioner.  Most of the time I like to try new products and hardly ever go back to the same one, but not this time... it&#x27;s almost like I missed it... it has been over a year since I had bought it and well im back again.  I missed how wonderful my hair smelled, how soft and strong it felt.  I have a problem with dry scalp and this seems to help.  It&#x27;s no head and shoulders but I love the way my hair feels and thats worth it alone.  My wife loves smelling my hair when we sleep now, so she likes it as well.</li>
    <li> This is the best Shampoo and Conditioner ever! I color my hair ALOT and if it wasn&#x27;t for this stuff my hair would be a dry disaster. But it looks healthy and shiny!</li>
    <li> a co-worker said that this was THE best shampoo and conditioner. Originally bought it just to shut her up and now I run around yammering about how awesome it makes your hair feel and smell, too.</li>
    <li> Honestly not worth it. My suave shampoo and conditioner made my hair softer and more &amp;#34;hydrated&amp;#34;.  I thought that the salon brands were better for your hair but looking at the ingredients this stuff has a ton of dyes, sulfates and harsh chemicals.</li>
    <li> Girlfriend absolutely loves this product, I love this price!!!</li>
    <li> When the site I use to order this shampoo from suddenly stopped selling it, I ordered it from Amazon. Reasonably priced and packaged carefully. Will order again!</li>
    <li> If you have baby-fine straight hair this is the combo for you!!  Love these.</li>
    <li> Love the scent of this Shampoo and Conditioner! The conditioner has a bit stronger scent.... Smells like a Sweet Ocean. The Shampoo is very thick which I like, I have shortish thin hair which it does not take much to get a good lather, maybe 3 pumps. The conditioner was okay.... I just loved the scent but took a lot more to get a good lather, Overall this has been the best combo I have used, still leaves my hair a bit Frizzy in some places since its hard to spread the conditioner around since its not as thick... But the scent made up for it... :) Good price for huge size bottles...  Also when I got mine, the conditioner was leaking :( Wish they would package it better.... But definitely try these out.. :)</li>
    <li> Best shampoo ever! I use a flat iron and hair styling product, especially hair spray, every day. With this shampoo/conditioner I feel like my hair is well hydrated and soft and smooth after blowdrying. I don&#x27;t feel like I have to put any leave in conditioner in it - I actually stopped using my &#x27;It&#x27;s a 10&#x27; leave in stuff. It feels like it cleanses enough to get all my product out and conditions enough to feel like my hair is back to a clean slate and being perfectly manageable. I even caught my boyfriend using some, because he said he liked it better than his!! LOL</li>
    <li> It smells nice, but I haven&#x27;t noticed any change in my hair it still feels the same. And it still looks the same all crazy and frizzy. My ends are still dead. I&#x27;m just not happy at all</li>
    <li> Bed Head shampoo is a great product.  My hair feels so soft and tames the frizz.  Other shampoos would make my scalp itch or bumps, but this does not.</li>
    <li> I love this product. I dye my hair all the time and this is the perfect shampoo to get my hair nice and soft again. Only draw back rinse a couple times, if you don&#x27;t your hair may look greasy when it dries.</li>
    <li> I have color treated hair and have tried everything under the sun for dry damaged hair. A friend of mine told me to try this product, so I did, and it did wonders to my hair. I do put a leave in conditioner in my hair after washing, but there has been a big change in the look and feel of my hair. I will use Bed Head forever.</li>
    <li> Smells amazing &amp; hair looks great &amp; feels soft</li>
    <li> Some boys like showers and doing their hair.  Mine has good days and bad days.  I wanted a product that worked well and conditioned his hair and this stuff does it.  My son has fun bi-racial hair.  A little bit of everything has lead to a whole lot of trouble in the hair department.  Tons of hair that is curly and thick is clean, manageable, and shiny with this great product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let me put it this way.  He loves it so much that he reminds me to buy it for him.  And, in my house this is breaking news people.</li>
    <li> Absolutely wonderful on my hair, love the smell, bought a second set, and then a third for my sister!</li>
    <li> Smell good and works well</li>
    <li> Love this product. Makes my hair feel so healthy</li>
    <li> Love it! Fast shipping</li>
    <li> The scent is great but the product quality is definitely lacking. I have curly hair that is prone to being dry even though I don&#x27;t color or style it. The shampoo works okay but leaves my hair feeling stringy, and the conditioner seems really thin and washes out so completely that it&#x27;s like I never even used it. Leaves my hair feeling dry and frizzy, not conditioned or &amp;#34;recovered&amp;#34; as I had hoped.</li>
    <li> Leaves my hair soft, manageable and smelling great!</li>
    <li> Love this shampoo and conditioner!! I had damaged hair and after a month or so of this product, it is full and healthy looking. My hairdresser kept asking me what I had done differently and it was this!!</li>
    <li> this is not one of my Tigi favs.. didn&#x27;t like the scent and ended up giving it away. Not your usual line of product.</li>
    <li> This shampoo and conditioner is seriously the best!! I get my hair colored so it has some damage, of course, but not much and this makes my hair so smooth and shiny like silk. It also helps control my frizz. The smell is really good too. You don&#x27;t have to use a lot either so this will last along time!</li>
    <li> ive used this about 4 or 5 times now it does make your hair a couple percent softer i would say it smeels great so im gonna keep useing it but i think works just well as some the other shampoos it seems</li>
    <li> I save myself a ton of money by purchasing this on Amazon instead of at my salon.  This is a great deal and you can&#x27;t go wrong with this duo pack.  I love the smell of the product and you really can&#x27;t beat the quality of the TIGI products.</li>
    <li> Excellent product  keeps my hair soft and damage free.  All Tigi shampoos are great  order from amazon makes it affordable hair care.</li>
    <li> I have dry, color treated, and curly hair. I can&#x27;t tolerate many scents, but love how this smells and the smell lasts. This set makes my hair feel very soft and easy to brush.</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo and conditioner. It makes my hair feel so soft and healthy.</li>
    <li> this is not the actual shampoo or conditioner. The bottles have been filled with some other garbage! How are they getting away with selling this?!!!do not waste your money!</li>
    <li> I was excited to get this product but when I did, I didn&#x27;t love it. I have been using it now for about a month and I want to like it but all it has done is weigh my hair done and makes it feel dirty and oily. I have fine hair but lots of it so maybe it&#x27;s too much for me. My hair does daily break but this did nothing to help it.</li>
    <li> Awesome! Made my har really soft</li>
    <li> Smells great, detangles, doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down.</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo and will continue to purchase it. However, when I ordered the second time it did not come with the pumps. I wish they warned me not to throw them away because if you re-order you will not get the pumps. (or for some reason I just didn&#x27;t receive?)</li>
    <li> I love the smell of this shampoo and conditioner! Makes your hair feel so soft. Definitely happy with this product. Would recommend it.</li>
    <li> One of my favorite Bed Head shampoo/conditioners. Makes your hair feel much healthier.</li>
    <li> Great product and price. However the conditioner must have opened in transit because it had leaked all over the bottle. Luckily the shipper had the foresight to put it in its own plastic bag prior to shipment.</li>
    <li> bought this for myself and my god daughter . i love how easy it made for me to comb my hair in the shower and how soft my hair feels when it dries . the smell is very nice as well . my god daughter fell in love with this too , that she let her sisters try it and now i&#x27;ve got them all hooked on TIGI Bed Head Urban Anti-dote Recovery Shampoo &amp; Conditioner . will i buy this again for the both of us OH YESSSS i will since i have ordered this a few times already . if you like TIGI BED HEAD you&#x27;ll love this .</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used all 3 levels of the urban antidotes line, this one is great. It&#x27;s really a perfect balance between 1 and 3. It cleans well and the conditioner moisturizes but doesn&#x27;t leave your hair weighed down. It&#x27;s great for everyday use. I&#x27;m always concerned about the scent of my hair products, and this one is pleasant. It&#x27;s not my favorite, but it&#x27;s not offensive. It&#x27;s kind of a citrus-y lemony orange scent.</li>
    <li> My hair is very dry , nothing is working to be honest . I have been using this shampoo and its conditioner for a while now . My hair feels softer and a bit healthier .</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t say enough positive things about this product. As a self proclaimed product junkie, I am absolutely loving this shampoo and conditioner. The combination leaves my hair smooth and silky soft. (Background:i am a 28 year old woman and I have naturally curly hair which I flat iron and color on a regular basis.)This product doesn&#x27;t leave build up like some others that I have used in the past. It has a really clean grapefruit scent and only requires a small amount of product to work up a good lather. My hair looks and feels healthier than it has in a long time. Bang for your buck rings true with this product for sure!</li>
    <li> excellent shampoo, fixes dry dull hair.  Especially for thick dry hair, this leaves your hair very soft.</li>
    <li> i really love this product i know it seems kind of pricey but its really worth the money!!! it smells so delicious and your hair is shiny healthy and soooo soft after the first use!!! my hair was all dried up from horse shampoo and sun in and once i tried this it worked!!! i&#x27;m very pleased with this product and will continue to use it (: i just love my hair now!!!</li>
    <li> My hair has completely changed.I highly recommend this if your hair is dry or damaged in any way. Super Rad.</li>
    <li> I love this duo.  I have thin, highlighted hair.  My hair drinks up the moisture and feels thicker and softer than with any other similar products I&#x27;ve used.....and I&#x27;ve tried many.  You won&#x27;t be disappointed if you try this!</li>
    <li> I usually use the green bottle, and decided to try the blue bottle to see if it was any better. It smells amazing, and I suppose its alright, but my hair seems to get greasy much faster.</li>
    <li> I have very damaged hair from bleaching last year. I have stopped dying it and am now trying to get it back to normal, grow it out and let it be healthy! This shampoo is amazing.. lathers well and the smell of it (very fruity) lingers all day!!! I don&#x27;t like the conditioner. It&#x27;s ok but I prefer to use others because it doesn&#x27;t moisture as well as my hair requires. But you cant beat the price, such a good deal!!</li>
    <li> This shampoo and conditioner works better than anything else I&#x27;ve found.  It makes my hair shiny and soft even though I have a lot of damaged ends.</li>
    <li> I love tigi products. Great price!</li>
    <li> Great for color treated, damaged hair. Smells fabulous!</li>
    <li> I love this stuff..I have been using for 2 years now...I just wish it was a little cheaper...Due to my budget...</li>
    <li> Really loved the scent of this product - even my hubby commented.  Would definitely recommend to throw in to break up your usual routine.  I have very fine &amp; thin hair, so it was a little much.  Great product!</li>
    <li> love the smell, and a little goes a long way!</li>
    <li> I love my hair and try to use what I think is the best. This product is probably one of my most favorite shampoos/cond. I love the smell, feel and look of my hair when I use this stuff. My hair is long and I occasionally color it. A little goes a long way, after using this to clean my hair I use Argan oil when styling. Great results. I&#x27;ve been using this product for 4 years or more.</li>
    <li> This product makes your hair silky soft and smells great!  Awesome price on this superior product!  Will purchase again!  Excellent!</li>
    <li> I love this product, and have turned my town upsidedown trying to locate it.  Sooo glad to have found it here and an even better price!</li>
    <li> To dry, need more moisture.</li>
    <li> Great product for colored hair! Smells good too :)</li>
    <li> I switched to a sulfate free shampoo because I bleached the underside of my hair. My hairdresser used bedhead so I thought it would be a good product to try at home. It smells amazing and as long as you don&#x27;t have a roommate stealing it, it will last for about three or four MONTHS. It leaves my hair clean, lights, no sulfates stripping it or weighing it down. Only thing I didn&#x27;t like was being robbed on shipping. In what universe could it possible cost $10 to ship these products.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t say enough about this product.  My hair dresser began using it on me and I had to have some.  It smells wonderful, leaves my hair feeling so clean and soft.  The conditioner does the job without any oily feel at all.</li>
    <li> I have dry curly, color treated hair and this stuff works great.  It tames the frizz without making my hair oily.</li>
    <li> We prefer the red bottle but this was all that was available at the time.</li>
    <li> I was so excited to try this! Great price! 💰 It had a lot of great reviews and also everyone said it smelled great. I know that shampoo and conditioner works different on other people,this did not work great on me at all. I also was not happy with the smell, it reminds me of that fast orange hand cleaner that my husband uses to wash his hands when he&#x27;s done working on his jeep. Not a smell that I care for.. lol  Hope you have better luck than I did? For the price it was worth the risk for me. 😉</li>
    <li> Love love love! My hair is so much softer since about 1 month of using! Must try if you havent already! :D</li>
    <li> i have fine hair, this combo is awesome! smells delightful and grapefruity:-)</li>
    <li> Not as the original.  My product seems &amp;#34;watered down&amp;#34; (conditioner) while shampoo is okay.  Not sure this is authentic.</li>
    <li> Love the product but the top of one of the bottles was cracked and broke, (i&#x27;m assuming during shipping) so the pump doesn&#x27;t work on the conditioner.</li>
    <li> Today is March 1st was suppose to receive products february 26th and I haven&#x27;t got them yet!!!!! I&#x27;m not happy!</li>
    <li> Best deal we could find on Bed Head!</li>
    <li> I purchased this set because I have badly damaged hair from over bleaching it, using the blow dryer everyday, and the flat iron. It arrived yesterday without any issues! The shampoo/conditioner set smells really good (kind of like sweet candy/fruit). Today was the first day I used it, and it seemed to work well. Today is the first day so I&#x27;ll update my review after a week. The smell stays in your hair so your hair will smell amazing all day which I like! Give it a try!</li>
    <li> Product perfect, delivered early.</li>
    <li> Pretty smell :) arrived in good condition! My hair was soft and shiny after first use, the only thing I didn&#x27;t realize is that it contains sulfate :/ other then that its good</li>
    <li> I have tried many hair products for my thick, naturally curly hair.  Bead Head is the best and purchasing them from Amazon saved me more that $20.00.  I will never shop in a beauty retail store again.</li>
    <li> Great product at a great price, definitely recommend to those with dry or damaged hair.</li>
    <li> Love this Shampoo and Conditioner combo. Has an awesome fruity scent and does leave my hair softer. I really enjoy the larger bottle size as well. I ordered pumps for them to make it easier in the shower. Will be ordering this again!</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with these products.  They are the perfect &amp;#34;recovery&amp;#34; products for damaged hair! They smell wonderful, too!</li>
    <li> Disappointed that this does not include the pumps. Hard to use a bottle this large with only a push button top. Should be specified in the details</li>
    <li> I had tried the red version of this duo and loved it. It was leaving my hair a little bit heavy and greasy so changed to level 2 (this one) loving it!</li>
    <li> Love love love it. Makes my hair feel so silky and soft. Noticed a difference within a week.</li>
    <li> Best shampoo set ever!</li>
    <li> I LOVE this shampoo and conditioner. My hair was soft and always smelled great. Much better than Redkin in my opinion.</li>
    <li> This shampoo is my favorite! It smells really nice and the smell stays in your hair for hours and hours after you get out of the shower. These bottles are nice and big and come with a pump at the top which is awesome! I would recommend it to anyone!</li>
    <li> My favorite brand and my boyfriend loves the smell!</li>
    <li> Received quickly and as advertised</li>
    <li> Good Shampoo and conditioner</li>
    <li> Quick shipping, great product!</li>
    <li> Good shampoo, the smell is citrus, smell isn&#x27;t that great.</li>
    <li> Item arrived when expected and was very well packaged.  I have extremely dry and damaged hair. In the past I have spent a small fortune on hair care products that don&#x27;t further the damage and leave my hair heavy or frizzier than usual. I love the TGI line because they are not harsh on my hair or scalp, rinse clean, and don&#x27;t add to the frizz. They smell great and a little goes a long way. I have actually noticed a huge improvement since I started using the recovery line and like to alternate between level 2 and level 3. I highly recommend this set for anyone who has naturally dry hair or damage from heat and styling.</li>
    <li> Wife say it has done great on her hair</li>
    <li> I had really high hopes for this shampoo/conditioner. I completely used both bottles before writing this review. The best things about this product are that it smells fantastic, and the price on Amazon is much cheaper than in stores. However, after going through the entire thing I expected to see at least some improvement in dryness and/or damage. I don&#x27;t think I see any difference at all. I don&#x27;t feel it is worth the extra price. For reference I have long, fine, thick blonde hair that is dry from a lot of heat styling. There seem to be a lot of five star reviews here that either don&#x27;t say anything, or sound exactly the same.</li>
    <li> Makes my hair super soft. I can feel the difference between this and cheaper shampoo. Totally worth the price!</li>
    <li> Love this shampoo and conditioner! My hair is looking and feeling better already!</li>
    <li> My second try with a BedHead product, I purchased the recovery shampoo and conditioner in a red bottle, and while it helped my dried out winter beaten hair (and my husband&#x27;s beautiful locks) I always thought the smell was a little off.  Not so with this product, the smell is awesome.  It is, as it says, very moisturizing, which is great, but at the same time, will leave your hair a little bit flat.  Otherwise, it&#x27;s good for getting your hair back into healthy shape. Gotta splurge on the good stuff every once in awhile - it&#x27;s been helpful since I just had a baby and hair loss sometimes happens afterwards.  This has kept my hair fairly strong, along with getting a recovery treatment at a salon and getting my hair shaped and styled.</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo and conditioner. I have extremely dry frizzy hair and my hair feels very clean and a lot more controlable now. The price was good and I ordered it on Nov. 13th and it came to my door Nov. 14th, the very next day! Will definitely buy again!</li>
    <li> I find that the shampoo doesn&#x27;t lather well in my hair.  I have to use quite a bit each time (5 pumps).  I admit that I have long, thick hair, but 5 pumps???  That&#x27;s just crazy!.  I have also tried the Recovery line in the RED bottle and like that much better.  I do like the conditioner.</li>
    <li> I love this product!! Hands down best available.</li>
    <li> Got referred this brand after complaining to a friend about my less than stellar hair condition.  I&#x27;ve always been a bit rough with my hair, and it shows.  Anyway, I tried this stuff, and while it&#x27;s not a miracle product, it does wonders!  My hair is super soft and very tangle resistant, and though it&#x27;s very prone to split ends and frizz, even that&#x27;s been toned down!  Not to mention, I -love- the smell of it!  While a bit overpowering in the shower, the scent is actually very mild after drying, though definitely still there if you&#x27;re looking for it.  I see no reason to ever switch to another shampoo/conditioner combo.</li>
    <li> My hair rejoices with this product. I just can&#x27;t use the conditioner every day or my hair gets greasy.</li>
    <li> I love these! Although I hope it would be perfect if the seller would wrap them around tigher, so they won&#x27;t leak.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I got the box open, shampoo and conditioner was leaking so that was not pleasant. Bubble wrapping would be a great option for this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But overalll about the product itself, I am very satisfied. I can feel my hair got softer and more nourished.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Plus, I love the scent of it! Thanks to these products, I get my morning started with great feelings.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been warned from friends about buying hair care products online, about how sometimes you don&#x27;t get the real product. I must say, I always laughed a little at their accusations, but I think in this case I might have become a believer in that theory. I have never used this product before this purchase, so I have nothing to compare it to. The shampoo was great, smells fantastic and is a nice thick texture. The conditioner was horrible though, I feel it was either diluted or just replaced. The conditioner barely had a scent (which was surprising because the shampoo has a rich delicious smell) and was thin, light, and did not make my hair feel soft and healthy at all. I almost want to go to a salon and compare the conditioners. I feel as though my hair is in worse shape after using this conditioner for a month. Two stars are for the shampoo. The conditioner was a waste of money. I just spent 30 bucks on a deep conditioner to put my hair back to good condition. In these harsh winter months you need to make sure your conditioner is doing it&#x27;s job. I do not recommend this product set.</li>
    <li> Great product shipped fast</li>
    <li> Best hair product out there, As a swimmer I need some serious re-hydration and this stuff does the trick like no other! Smells great too! And these bottles are freaking huge, this was a steal for the price.</li>
    <li> I love Bed Head products, and this shampoo/conditioner set is amazing. It smells delicious, and leaves my hair soft and healthy. I have fine blonde (highlighted) hair. This product works great on it.</li>
    <li> I use a different shampoo every night, and this one smells fantastic, but I don&#x27;t see a clear difference when using this versus any other of my shampoos. Might buy again...we&#x27;ll see.</li>
    <li> LOVE the product!! I was looking all over for a cheaper price on this and it&#x27;s sooo hard to find it. Thank you for selling!</li>
    <li> I used this product for the first time at my sisters, as soon as I got home i ordered it.  People really notice the change in my hair, sicne i started using this product.  I am truly a BED HEAD!</li>
    <li> Love the scent - really like the way my hair feels after I&#x27;ve shampooed - don&#x27;t like the other scents.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s what I expected.</li>
</ol>
