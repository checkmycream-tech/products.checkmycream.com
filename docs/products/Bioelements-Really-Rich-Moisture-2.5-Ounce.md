<li> Keeps it moist all day long but not oily.</li>
<li> Here in Colorado, the air is extremely dry and damaging and this cream leaves my skin moist all day long.</li>
<li> But I wanted something a little bit better for dry cold winters.</li>
<li> Extremely emollient.</li>
<li> I live in a cold region and my face was getting so dry.</li>
<li> After putting on my face there&#x27;s a sheen for a little bit until it absorbs fully.</li>
<li> My hairdresser recommended this product a few years ago and I have used it ever since.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s very thick and doesn&#x27;t seem to soak in as well during the day.</li>
<li> I was afraid this moisturizer would be too heavy and make me break out - nope.</li>
<li> The Retin-A is very irritating and drying to my skin.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Extremely emollient. Great for super dry skin. This and sleepwear are the most moisturizing products of this line. Crucial moisturizer (name?) was watery and ineffective.</li>
    <li> Yes yes yes it&#x27;s good</li>
    <li> I have really dry skin and regular moisturizer doesn&#x27;t work for me. I started using this product as recommended by my esthetician about a year ago and love it! One 2.5 ounce jar lasts me about 6 months as only a tiny bit is needed.</li>
    <li> This is my absolute favorite moisturizer! Not only is it rich and creamy, the smell is a wonderful tangerine scent! I cannot say enough nice things about this product! It&#x27;s Awesome!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m sticking with this rich moisturizer with a wonderful scent.</li>
    <li> Great product only drawback is it takes a little while to soak in so you dont want to put makeup on right after applying</li>
    <li> Rich and creamy.  You do not have to use much so the jar lasts a long time.  A spatula is provided so that the product remains clean.  This has helped my skin feel moist and beautiful.  The end of May will herald in my 70th Birthday, my wrinkles are softened so nicely with this, people compliment me often.  I recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Bioelements is a wonderful product that I&#x27;ve been using for a long time.  This moisturizer is very good for my dry/normal skin.  I love the softness it creates.</li>
    <li> I am in my 50&#x27;s and love the product line, lover of products for 6 months. Goes on smooth and a little goes a long way:]</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t used it, but my wife and mother in law swear by it. That&#x27;s a good enough review for me.</li>
    <li> i love this moisturizer. I have been using it for two year straight. I couldn&#x27;t recommend it more highly. It&#x27;s thick and perfect for night and day use.</li>
    <li> I use Retin-A to control acne. The Retin-A is very irritating and drying to my skin. I was afraid this moisturizer would be too heavy and make me break out - nope. Its rich and makes my thirty skin happy but it doesn&#x27;t break me out. I have tried MUCH MUCH more expensive moisturizers like La Mer. This is better in my opinion. I&#x27;ve been using this about three weeks and my skin has never looked better.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this cream</li>
    <li> My very favorite moisturizer. It works wonderfully and has a nice clean smell.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s the only moisture cream I use, also like the Crucial Moisture Cream.  The Really Rich is good for summer and night tried others but like Bioelements products the best.</li>
    <li> I have used Bioelements products for many years.  Really Rich Moisture give my dry skin just what it needs.  Moisture without clogging my pores.  My makeup applies easily and give my skin with a smooth and flawless look.</li>
    <li> Item was as listed. Quick delivery</li>
    <li> This is a great, reasonably priced moisture cream.</li>
    <li> Love this product. Packaged to prevent damage.</li>
    <li> This is a great night time moisturizer. It absorbs into the skin quickly and leaves the skin glowing.  A great value&lt;br /&gt;as well</li>
    <li> Ive used crucial moisture for over 10 years. But I wanted something a little bit better for dry cold winters. This seems to do the job. Nice light scent. Smooth but thicker than crucial moisture. After putting on my face there&#x27;s a sheen for a little bit until it absorbs fully. I would not use this outside of winter or it would irritate my skin.  My only reason for 4 stars is the price. A little bit too much but I&#x27;d buy again</li>
    <li> Best moisturizer on the market for dry skin. Keeps it moist all day long but not oily. Great for people older</li>
    <li> This product met my expectations in terms of the item itself as well as its delivery on time.</li>
    <li> I use this product more at night. It&#x27;s very thick and doesn&#x27;t seem to soak in as well during the day. I find that if I use it during the day I can&#x27;t put any foundation on because the moisturizer seems to leave a film.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Despite this, I like this product for night time use a lot.</li>
    <li> My hairdresser recommended this product a few years ago and I have used it ever since. It is a good heavy cream that does not cause me any itching as I have sensitive skin. I use it as a daily product. Here in Colorado, the air is extremely dry and damaging and this cream leaves my skin moist all day long.</li>
    <li> This cream is really moisturizing with a creamy texture</li>
    <li> Best face lotion I&#x27;ve ever used.  Great for my dry skin!</li>
    <li> Been using over ten years. Now my in laws use it and my mother of age 74 thinks the world of it. She has used all bio elements sines was age 60, 14 years, and it is 70% organic and made in the USA. I love my skin.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite moisture by far.  It is light, but it doesn&#x27;t feel oily, or make my skin look oily.  I can apply it day, or night.  A very good price for such a good product.</li>
    <li> Awesome, awesome moisturizer! I had bought Bioelements Absolute Moisture, which is great...for the summer. I live in a cold region and my face was getting so dry. Now it&#x27;s soft, smooth, and healthy feeling.</li>
    <li> This is a good, inexpensive product.  It will never compare to Creme De Le Mer, but it&#x27;s a good alternative.</li>
    <li> Love it been using it for several years now.</li>
    <li> I have dry skin and this product has been amazing at keeping my skin hydrated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a BIG Bioelements fan but if you have dry/very dry skin this could be your daily routine savior.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend with highest regard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*I&#x27;m sensitive to smell and this is a little smelly but WORTH it*</li>
    <li> Love this stuff!!! Smells excellent!</li>
