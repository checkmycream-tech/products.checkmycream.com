<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> works great,, very helpful to skin other then sun blocker</li>
    <li> Solbar PF 50 offers excellent sun protection. Solbar Shield offers complete solar protection in that it contains both zinc oxide and titanium dioxide.  This stuff is bullet proof but quite expensive.</li>
    <li> I was breaking out in unbelievable itches 24 hours after ANY other chemical-based sunscreen, this one--no itching AND it really protects me! I buy two new bottles every summer.</li>
    <li> Not as good as the cream version of same, product</li>
    <li> I like this sunscreen a bit shinnie I do not use on face but I use on my body</li>
    <li> I was a little worried about this after reading some of the reviews but I have loved this sunblock. I have kids with LIGHT skin and I struggle with sunblock like crazy!! This stuff has worked great!</li>
    <li> This sunscreen is great I use it every day. I also use it in my grandchildren and it works great!</li>
    <li> This is an excellent product, first recommended by my dermatologist.  I&#x27;ve used it for years and it truly protects my skin and isn&#x27;t greasy.  It was delivered on time and packed very well!</li>
    <li> This sunscreen was first recommended to me by a pharmacist. I have been using it now for 20 years on my face, every day of the year. It is a great product! It feels good as a moistuizer under my make-up and in the tropical caribbean sunshine it never allows you to burn. I highly recommended Sol Bar 50.</li>
    <li> Skin reacts in rashes to most OTC sunscreens. This is good stuff. No problems, good value.</li>
    <li> Only way to get this product locally is to have a store order it in bulk (min 6) for me. Thank you Amazon.com!</li>
    <li> We took it to Florida and so far so good in the two weeks we were there.  Was recomended by our Dermatologist.</li>
    <li> Use it a lot with the kids and no problem. No issues with using it after in the shore. Skin has no problems</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s the best for sun burn protection especially over new skin tissue. It gives solid protection against darkening new skin</li>
    <li> Have used it for years.  Recommended by my dermatologist.</li>
    <li> I ordered Solbar 50 from NG, w/picture and NDC # &amp; recd. a different NDC # and list of ingredients. Complained, never heard anything. Bad sev. I guess NG stands for nogood.</li>
    <li> This sunblock cream is work  really good.Long lasting in whole day even if you are expose in sun.The only problem is, it has a little bit smell.But I love this cream.Good for summer vacation if your planning to expose in sun,feel confident with no worries.</li>
    <li> This was recommended by a dermatologist.  Goes on easy and no greasy look or feel.  My husband is now using this also</li>
    <li> Took this to Hawaii and the kids didn&#x27;t get burnt.</li>
    <li> I was first given this sunscreen as a sample at my derm&#x27;s office over 10 years ago. This has been consistenly the only sunscreen I ever use. It&#x27;s not totally oil free, which is good for me since I have dry skin. I actually use it over my makeup and it gives a nice dewy finish.</li>
    <li> I use this everyday  and found its exactly as stated on bottle. Very absorbent, creamy, silky smooth and not sticky. Where it for a straight four hours without reapplying because I put an ounce on my face alone including ears and throat. Do the same for body and have no reoccurrence of burnt suntan which has happened to me once. Will be purchasing this gem again.</li>
    <li> PreSun which I had been using for 40 years has been&lt;br /&gt;discontinued but their website recommended Solbar as&lt;br /&gt;a replacement.  Product has excellent &amp;#34;slip&amp;#34; (adheres to&lt;br /&gt;skin and leaves a beautiful moist finish) Excellent as a&lt;br /&gt;moisturizer under make up as well as sunscreen.</li>
    <li> I love the Solbar zinc which really keeps the sun away.  This sunscreen, I used this on my face and it blinded me. I was crying for two hours.  I can&#x27;t review on the efficacy of it- as I washed it off within 30 minutes.</li>
    <li> We had to have biodegradable sunscreen to go to Xel-Ha and Dolphin Discovery.  This was great stuff!  Kept us from burning!</li>
    <li> Another repeat purchase - Goes on smoothly, absorbs well, no fragrance is especially important to me.</li>
    <li> Only sunscreen I use.  It absorbs very well.</li>
    <li> I have used it for years and would not want to switch to anything else.</li>
    <li> I love this sunscreen. It&#x27;s sunscreen and moisturizer in one. My Dermatolgist recommended it. It has a great feeling on the skin and is  very effective..</li>
    <li> Been using it for years, but can&#x27;t be found in our location</li>
    <li> Love the UV protection that only zinc can give. This product goes on clear. Only beef is it feels little greasy and heavier than other products but I continue to use it because it also protects better than other products I&#x27;ve tried so far. A trade off I can live with.</li>
    <li> This a wonderful and useful sun block.</li>
    <li> SPF 50 too strong to use on my face. Burned my eyes for 2 days even after discontinued use.</li>
    <li> Broke skin out a bit.</li>
    <li> Works well and spreads nicely.  Loses points for me because it stings my eyes when I sweat or swim.</li>
    <li> this sunscreen is great- nice moisturizer- good coverage- essentially fragrance free. the only thing I like better is the gel but only has an SPF of 30 and I need longer protection.</li>
    <li> This is the best sunscreen I&#x27;ve ever used. I have had bad reactions to some other products in the past, but a doctor recommended this stuff and it&#x27;s all I&#x27;ve ever used since. Never burn.</li>
    <li> i buy it for the second time ,useful ,if you ues this on face ,may be a little oilly .bu i like it ,which make my face ,my body far away the sun.</li>
    <li> I buy it from Amazon. It&#x27;s much better then others. You don&#x27;t feel put something on your skin. It is a good protection for you.</li>
    <li> I first received a sample of the Solbar PF 50 Cream from my dermatologist. I wasn&#x27;t able to find it in local stores so I turned to Amazon.com -- and voila !!!!&lt;br /&gt;I am very pleased with the product. It is creamy but not greasy. I am very fair &amp; need a high SPF for my face.&lt;br /&gt;Other products with higher SPF have irritated my skin after a few uses, but not the Solbar PF 50.&lt;br /&gt;I would just caution that you apply it sparingly, though. I first used too much and it did seem a little greasy. When I applied less, it was PERFECT.&lt;br /&gt;I definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I love this sunscreen, i ask my dermatologist about this sunscreen and he said that it was the best to use. I use this sunscreen every single day. I love it.</li>
    <li> yes, it&#x27;s very thick and you have to work it in, but i never get sunburn with their products.  i use it on my face, too.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for 15 years and never a sun burn. Hard to find but worth the effort. A little greasy at first but really works.</li>
    <li> I have sensitive skin and require an effective sunblock that will not clog my pores or break me out.  Solbar was recommended to me by my Dermatologist and I have used this product exclusively for over 10 years.  Much prefer the cream to the liquid.  It has longer staying power.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for over 15 years since my dermatologist recommended it after my CO2 laser resurfacing.  I highly recommend it.  It goes on so easily, unlike other products that are difficult to rub in with this high SPF.</li>
    <li> works great when on land.  but it washes off quick when in the water.  must reapply as soon as you get out</li>
    <li> My dermatologist gave me a sample to use on my face - it caused horrible, stinging eyes within about twenty minutes.</li>
    <li> Skin doctor recommended it.  I can&#x27;t find it in my area so I order it online.  It seems to be working.</li>
    <li> Smells fine, great product, but too expensive. Other products have unpleasant odor and leave a chalky residue, making me look like a ghost.</li>
    <li> I keep this in my car &amp; when I put my convertible top down, I apply&lt;br /&gt;the cream to my shoulders &amp; it&#x27;s terrific.</li>
    <li> Solbar was recommended by my dermatologist as I have fair skin and I do landscaping. I like that it goes on easily and is non-irritating unless I get it too near my eyes. It shipped very quickly and the seller was sure to tape the cap so there was no leakage.</li>
    <li> This is light and creamy.  I prefer the 30 spf SolBar gel, but if you are going to use any cream, this is my favorite.</li>
    <li> Recommended to me by my dermatologist who used to give out samples but can&#x27;t keep enough in stock it is so wonderful.  I have very photo-sensitive skin and this is the best sunblock I have ever used.  I love that it does not have a tropical scent as I wear sunscreen every day, not only when I am at the beach.  The SPF 30 Liquid (more of a gel) is fantastic as well.</li>
    <li> This is a way overpricd sunscreen.  You can get a far better deal with a similar product and better price by buying at cvs or walgreens.  Don&#x27;t bother buying this over the internet unless you feel like giving your money away to the seller.</li>
    <li> personal preference...it&#x27;s too greasy!  SolBar Liquid is so much better and has a dry feeling.  Great product though</li>
    <li> Excellent product. My wife loves it. She is sensitive to a lot of products, but this one is great.</li>
    <li> This is the only sunscreen that I&#x27;ve used that actually meets the claims made for it.  Used to buy it in the stores but recently had to search for it online.  Glad I found it again.</li>
    <li> I have tried other sunscreens which left me burned and peeling.  I never have that problem with Solbar. It&#x27;s a great product.</li>
    <li> Does as it said it would.  Thanks</li>
    <li> Solbar was recommended to me by my dermatologist and I&#x27;ve been using it for +5 years. If I know I&#x27;m going to be outdoors in full sun for the day, I use the 50 SPF. It&#x27;s perfect under makeup and is odorless and blends well. I wouldn&#x27;t use anything else!</li>
    <li> great product and service</li>
