      <li>Ideally, if you could just click the button once to turn it on and click it once to turn it off, it would be a lot more</li>
      <li>Good price too.</li>
      <li>Good size for kids</li>
      <li>However, that&#x27;s about good as it got.  </li>

      <li>and it just made her feel better!</li>
      <li>Fan works great and is strong.  </li>
      <li>My at home manicures are amazing as I&#x27;ve received tons of compliments from my work colleagues.&lt;br</li>
      <li>She seems thrilled with them.</li>

      <li>It&#x27;s nice to know that people still do care about their customers.</li>

      <li>Seems to be a good product to me :)</li>
      <li>I liked that these have non-slip grips on the bottom.</li>
      <li>price is nice too.</li>
      <li>exactly what i was looking for and the price very good.</li>

      <li>I no longer have to spend an hour (or more) at a nail salon.</li>
      <li>While the set does not include an AC adapter, I am ok with replacing the AA batteries when required.</li>
      <li>At some point I&#x27;ll invest in a more salon-like nail dryer.</li>
      <li>But it&#x27;s better than nothing.</li>
      <li>They&#x27;re ok....</li>
      <li>Glad I bought them.</li>
      <li>but they are compact and can almost fit in your purse!</li>
      <li>They both LOVE It and use it ALL the time.</li>
      <li>but they&#x27;re ok</li>
      <li>and I was able to give one to my daughter and she loves it.</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s safe for him to play with it.</li>
      <li>They even organized a girls party to share with friends and all the girls love it.</li>
      <li>I like them better for my feet than my hands</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Did not work at all, very disappointing.</li>
    <li> Works well. Helps nails dry faster. Happy I purchased them.</li>
    <li> Disappointed with product.  It does not come with an adapter and it did not work with AA batteries. They  both worked when I used an adapter that I had, but, will be returning produce because it is too small.  Can&#x27;t fit your thumb in it - only four fingers - and I have small hands.!!</li>
    <li> One works fine but the other worked for about 1 second and hasn&#x27;t worked since.</li>
    <li> Nice and small and it blows a lot of air..love it</li>
    <li> They are great. The girls at my kids spa love them</li>
    <li> Unfortunately, both of my nail dryers have broken. They were OK for a few weeks, but didn&#x27;t last very long. Disappointing.</li>
    <li> My girls loved them, works great</li>
    <li> This product is great, however:&lt;br /&gt;You need batteries, there is not a wall outlet cord included... No big deal.&lt;br /&gt;Also, to make it function, there&#x27;s a pressure pad inside, sometimes it takes a little extra pressure to get it running (kids might have trouble).</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very happy with this item.  I actually bought a bigger one from Walgreens and ended up by giving it away since it was a total waste of time and the fan barely blew!  The fan on these is quite strong, given their size.  I already had a pair of these for a different location, so I ordered them again.  My only complaint, if there is one, is that they could be just a little bit wider so your thumb can comfortably fit.  But I make it work by putting my four fingers in first and then I sneak the thumbs in very carefully so as not to smudge the polish!  That&#x27;s the reason I gave them four stars instead of five.  But, overall, I&#x27;d definitely recommend them!</li>
    <li> Purchased for my two teens - they love them!</li>
    <li> Arrived on time, packaged fine, these are small fans, my 3 year old daughter has a tough time getting all 5 fingers carefully into it and I would&#x27;ve preferred on/off buttons on them instead of having to press down constantly as it&#x27;s easy for my daughter to mess up a nail trying to push down at times but they&#x27;re ok I&#x27;ll see how long they hold up. We just leave her thumbs out and fan them separately, she likes to use them. I will say the customer service here is excellent and really want their customer to be happy, so that is a definite plus!</li>
    <li> Does not dry nail quick enough</li>
    <li> Small and portable.  These are great for my daughter who paints her nails like every other day.  Only downfall is your thumbs dont fit.  Great for drying toes also.</li>
    <li> This is a very good mini dryer.&lt;br /&gt;To dry the nails, I need to put my hands in without thumb (I guess this is why it is called mini). It actually cut the dry time about 30 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;But you do have to press the wide button down a little bit. This is not a quite easy thing to do for a long time. but for a couple of minutes, I can deal with it just fine. The fan is small but powerful enough. I can fell the air blow through my fingers. If you want to bring it when traveling and no enough room in your luggage, I think just one would be enough, because the nail dries quickly.</li>
    <li> Didnt expect these to be as good as they were. Will be purchasing a few more for my shop and kit.</li>
    <li> This isn&#x27;t the most powerful fan, but it gets the job done and is a nice, handy little fan for the price. It&#x27;s a mini dryer, so it&#x27;s small (about four inches high, four inches long and 3 inches wide) and lightweight. My one gripe against the size is that I couldn&#x27;t fit all five fingers inside. You have to maneuver a bit to fit your thumb in and it&#x27;s not the easiest or most comfortable thing to do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Using the fan is easy. There are no switches to flip, so you don&#x27;t have to struggle with those while trying to keep your fresh manicure intact. Instead, the bottom part of the inside of the dryer is one large button, which you gently hold down to turn the fan on. The inside of the dryer has enough overhead room that I didn&#x27;t have to worry about bumping my nails on the top of the fan compartment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is I do wish this dryer was a touch wider so I could easily fit my thumb in, but other than that, I was happy with it!</li>
    <li> These work great! I ordered some from Wal-Mart.com but had to return them. They didn&#x27;t work well at all. these are great. We used them at my daughter&#x27;s 5 year old b-day party. The girls loved them and thought they were fun. Good price too.</li>
    <li> My daughter loves to have painted nails, but doesn&#x27;t have the patience to let them dry. This is a small dryer and she can use it successfully with very little assistance. The dryers require batteries that are not included. It&#x27;s nice that these come as a pair so that both hands can dry at once. The fan is moderately strong, and works well.  I liked that these have non-slip grips on the bottom.</li>
    <li> Twin dryers does great job . The best part is the size which makes it easier to carry. I have small hands and long nails so it&#x27;s easier for me. For the price this product is very good. I am looking forward to using this product for my daughter too !!</li>
    <li> I like these dryers, but you do have to press down pretty hard for them to dry your nails.  Unfortunately, you can sometimes mess up your nails while putting your hands under the dryer.  They are also not wide enough to put your whole hand under if you have large hands (I do).  All in all it&#x27;s an okay item, but not great.</li>
    <li> This mini dryer gets the job done.  I have slender fingers, so all of my fingers fit in the “shell”.  However, I have to place my thumb at angle for it to fit.  The mini nail dryer shaves about 30-40 minutes off of the drying time, depending on the amount of polish on the nail.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The portable mini dryer will come in handy when traveling on occasions where I need to have my nails polished.  Also, it will serve well when ‘touch ups’ are needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This unit is battery operated (AA) and the fan is activated by lightly depressing the bottom with your hand for drying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This mini nail dryer was supplied by the manufacturer in exchange for an unbiased review.</li>
    <li> Pressure really needs to be applied to get fan going. Sometimes causing nails to smudge.</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t expecting much out of these fans based on price, etc. I was pleasantly surprised. Shipping was quick and the fans have some decent power for being battery operated. These fans are great for regular nail polish (not gels, etc as fans don&#x27;t have curing lights).  Add a little quick dry drops or quick dry spray to your manicure and these fans help even more in a quick time.  Thumbs don&#x27;t fit in with the rest of fingers but that&#x27;s not a deal breaker for me. Would purchase these again.</li>
    <li> Very quick ship. great product for children or for my nursing home. not hot. very safe. For businesses such as daycare centers and nursing homes that require strict safety measures. Some people of different abilities just can&#x27;t hold still and smear polish. This helps. Aerosol sprays that dry quick are sooooo toxic, it&#x27;s bad enough we must use polish remover.</li>
    <li> These are nice little dryers and they work well.  The only complaint I have is that you cannot fit your thumb in while your other fingers are drying.  Good product overall.</li>
    <li> Bought 2 of these for a gift and was glad I tried them out first. Neither one worked, very very cheeply made. returned both for a full refund. ado not waste your money on theses.</li>
    <li> they are cute and nice designed; work very nicely and quickly. easy to carry. price is nice too. worth buying.</li>
    <li> Wow, I am very happy with these nail dryers.  Not only do they look cool, they work really good too.  I have small hands so there is a lot of room in the nail dryers.  Note:  AA batteries are required.</li>
    <li> These were a great value. Regular nail polish dryers are hard to find since gel polish is so popular. I found one in Sally&#x27;s but they wanted $35 for it. I wish I would. I&#x27;d stand in front of my house fan with my hands out before I paid that much for one. These work great. The fan is strong and they are not overly loud. I took a star because you kinda have to maneuver your fingers to get your thumb in. It&#x27;s worth it though. I need my nails dried as quickly as possible because it never fails that as soon as I polish them something starts itching, or someone calls, or I get a wedgie. Lol.</li>
    <li> This product works very well. So glad I purchased these little dryers. I really does cuts drying time in half!</li>
    <li> The twin pack is perfect for my 4 year old twin granddaughters.  I bought them each a set.  This will make drying their nails fun and avoid smudges. Even though they are only 4 they love having mom polish their nails every week.</li>
    <li> The dryer takes 2AA batteries, and the fan is not hot, very safe for kids. The mini size fits my 9-year daughter&#x27;s fingers well and she loves it very much. It is a good gift for 8 to 14 year girls.</li>
    <li> This nail dryer is cute. My daughter loves it. It&#x27;s very easy to setup(install 2 AA batteries) &amp; use safely.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t come with the plug. At least it has a place for it, we wanted one that would allow it to plug or do batteries. The fan is stronger than I thought it would be. I am excited for my daughter to open it for Christmas, she&#x27;s 13 and wanted one from Walmart, but they only sell the battery powered one.</li>
    <li> One for each hand! I love how I can either have them battery opporated or I can use a 3 Volt adaptor (unfortunately not included, but to be expected for the low price paid) to plug in and power these babies. Compact size made them easy to store and take with on trips.</li>
    <li> Units don&#x27;t come complete. They have the Female port for the power cord but they don&#x27;t come with the cord so they are battery only.</li>
    <li> Got these for my nieces as they enjoy doing their nails. They worked well and they like them. Thanks a lot!</li>
    <li> Purchased this for my teen daughter who is doing her nails every week and she loves it. It&#x27;s compact and works well!</li>
    <li> I got this for my wife since she does her nails every weekend. She always takes her sweet time there because she wants her nails to dry before she starts her drive back home. I decided to buy these for her so she can speed up the process. Tho, the fans aren&#x27;t powerful, it does save 5-10 mins off the drying process which was my intended purpose and gives my wife the peace of mind that she wont mess up her nails during the drive home. Her only gripe is that she cant fit all 5 fingers in the dryer and she has skinny fingers too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall its a great investment and will update this review over time.</li>
    <li> The fan works great dry very quickly . my future clients will like it. Helps rid of oders. Will suggest.</li>
    <li> Needs 2 double A batteries each. Also you can use a 3V DC Adapter (not included) instead of batteries. Very cute and it fits my 13 year olds 4 fingers without the thumb (not enough space for the thumbs). But she loves it.</li>
    <li> I wish it had more power behind it but works fine for drying nails.</li>
    <li> Two for the price of one. These fans are perfect for a quick nail dry.Just a few minutes under the dryer and no more messed up nails. The price is great and I was able to give one to my daughter and she loves it. It is battery operated so you can use it anywhere. They are small and pack easily in a suitcase for trips.</li>
    <li> Cute little driers &amp; perfect for my 13 year olds &amp;#34;nail salon&amp;#34; in our basement.  Put hand in (4 fingers) and get a nice little blow dry.</li>
    <li> Shipped super fast and is very convenient. You have to press down on a plate button to get the fan to go. The only downside is that you can&#x27;t fit all 5 fingers in at the same time but you work around it. Great price for 2.</li>
    <li> It dries nails a little bit faster.</li>
    <li> Wish they would have came with the cord or offered the option. Other wise it was what I had expected.</li>
    <li> Works well, It is kind of small but since the size is PORTABLE it is to be expected although you really can&#x27;t get your thumb in there at the same time. There is a button you push that is on the bottom but it is really easy to press, I have my kiddo&#x27;s use this fan and they are 6 and 4.</li>
    <li> I bought the twin pack and ended up giving one to my wife and one to my mother...They both LOVE It and use it ALL the time.</li>
    <li> NAIL DRYERS - Purchased for my Grandaughter. It was a huge success and she loved it. And it does work.</li>
    <li> Great product where money and space aret tight, very powerful blowers for such little machines .Can be used battery -operated or plugged in</li>
    <li> Product is cheaply made for the price.....dryers dont work that great..they r small.. They should include the plug in. Thanks</li>
    <li> These nail dryers are so so. After reading all the great reviews no one mentioned to keep the fan on your have to press down and hold on a button the whole time as you have your hands inserted in there. Since these are travel size and it&#x27;s already awkward that your whole hand can&#x27;t comfortably fit in there it would of been helpful to have an off/on switch. I already have little patience holding my hands in there for 5-10 minutes but it&#x27;s more annoying to hold them and press down on this button.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will have to deal with it for now.</li>
    <li> Awful...Take too long or your nails to dry. Not powerful enough.</li>
    <li> If you have big or long fingers these fans might be inconvenience for you.&lt;br /&gt;But with my &amp;#34;regular&amp;#34;-sized hands and fingers, they work fine.&lt;br /&gt;They do help me save time!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BUT there is a bit of weird smell when I dry my nails for a few minutes in a row.&lt;br /&gt;And..if you are in the colder regions, the fan might make your fingers colder &#x3D;P&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a pretty good product though~</li>
    <li> I have a salon in a retirement community and my lil ole ladies can&#x27;t press that hard for very Lon. It would be getter if it wasn&#x27;t so hard to press!</li>
    <li> This product is exactly what i needed. It was also nice that the seller actually reached out to make sure that I was a satisfied customer. It&#x27;s nice to know that people still do care about their customers.</li>
    <li> Have come in so handy. use them all the time, work great.&lt;br /&gt;like that you can use adapter on them also</li>
    <li> Wish I had known it was batteries only.  Works fairly well.  Good size for kids not so good size for adult size hands or someone with long nails.</li>
    <li> Purchase this as a gift for my niece. She seems thrilled with them. Very good service. I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> These dryers take batteries and are useful and compact. They help in drying nails and are easily stored away when not n use.</li>
    <li> These were a waste of money. I could blow on my fingers and dry them faster , plus not enough room for whole hand without smearing polish.</li>
    <li> I have needed one of these and it is the best thing ever i love them they are easy to use and just all together fantastic</li>
    <li> My daughters love this cute nail dryer. Now the older one is opening a manicure shop and the little one is the first customer. It takes 2 AA batteries and the fan would turn on when little fingers pressing on the large button. It feels safe and does dry the nails quickly. A good buy!</li>
    <li> These are great little fans!  They use AA batteries and you turn on the fans by pressing your fingers on the platform in front of the fan....so easy to use.  Genius.</li>
    <li> I bought I for my daughter so she does not need to wait to long for her nail to dry.  She has hard time to active the dryer. I was very strong.</li>
    <li> Work so great and fast.  The design is cute.</li>
    <li> For 2AA battery, these little dryers pack a small punch!&lt;br /&gt;Just a little hard to get an adult size hand in fully, the thumb sticks out a bit.  But otherwise It&#x27;s all good</li>
    <li> Works great, dries my nails faster (I use to just spray a quick dry on it and blow my nails...having this is much better -_-) You just press down and it&#x27;ll blow cool air.</li>
    <li> Great Xmas gift thanks barb</li>
    <li> As mentioned by a previous reviewer, the opening to each fan does not allow enough room for your thumbs. So you&#x27;ll either have to adjust your fingers a bit (which was a bit awkward and cumbersome for me to do), or you&#x27;ll have to dry your thumbs separately.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The push button to turn on the fan is where your hand is placed inside of the fan which is very convenient. However, you have to continuously press down on the button to keep the fan running, which is a bit of a hassle. Ideally, if you could just click the button once to turn it on and click it once to turn it off, it would be a lot more convenient.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not sure if these little devices truly help my nail polish dry faster, but not a bad purchase overall.&lt;br /&gt;FYI each fan requires 2 AA batteries.</li>
    <li> So far so good.  Wife seems to use it every week, and no problems yet.  Drys the nails fast too.</li>
    <li> I was disappointed this product mentions it can be powered with an DC adapter but it is not included with the product. You have to buy it separately. Misleading. Also you have to press down on the inside of the unit to turn the fan on. Not a good feature with wet nails because you risk messing up the tips of the nails when they touch the dryer. Just disappointed in general with this product. Not useful at all.</li>
    <li> Would like it to be a little larger to fit thumb</li>
    <li> A must for a 7 year old!</li>
    <li> A tad bit to small... should have a little more depth to them and they&#x27;d be perfect for the price.</li>
    <li> I got it recently and my two daughters love it.  They play together with each other with that and had a lot fun. They even organized a girls party to share with friends and all the girls love it.</li>
    <li> Great for drying my nails at home which I do often. As many people say, you can not fit all 5 fingers in the machine but that is ok, I dry the other finger after.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t remember the last time I was so disappointed in a product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ordered the 2-pack and it was delivered on time and well packaged. However, that&#x27;s about good as it got.  I plugged in one of the units to the outlet with the supplied power cord and within one minute it stopped working.  I plugged in the second unit and It also stopped working within a minute also.  I thought the problem might be the power cord so I tried to power the units via battery power with new batteries, but that didn&#x27;t work either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can somewhat understand 1 defective unit, but 2? Come on now!</li>
    <li> Great! Cute! Bought these for my daughter whose a Nail Tech for her to use on the go.</li>
    <li> Fast delivery!  Seems to be a good product to me :)</li>
    <li> Great fan speed! Some commented that room for the thumb is needed, it&#x27;s easy enough to put the thumb on top of the pointer finger for it to dry too.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a gift for a teenager.  Hope she likes it.</li>
    <li> I was so excited to receive this. It actually came on the day I was doing my nails. How perfect!&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, one of them is broken. The other one is a great little product, super happy about it but I will have to return because I&#x27;m not paying that much for one single useable mini nail dryer. PS: It does have some power adapter holes at the back of it, in case you&#x27;re wondering.</li>
    <li> I ordered these as a gift for my teen daughter.  She loves it!  I love the fact that it only runs when the bar is pressed with your fingers so hopefully she won&#x27;t go thru so many batteries!</li>
    <li> I received these in a timely fashion and they are wonderful! They&#x27;re lightweight but powerful. I love having two of them because I can polish my nails and hold them in my hands to dry as I walk on my treadmill. Would definitely buy again!</li>
    <li> These were a gift and she seems to like them! would recommend</li>
    <li> The two for 20 was great. It gives off a lot of air for a little fan.&lt;br /&gt;You do have to maneuver to get your thumb in but for what it was&lt;br /&gt;meant for it&#x27;s perfect. One for each hand or one for each child, either&lt;br /&gt;way I&#x27;d recommend this product and seller again.</li>
    <li> One failed after about 5 uses.  Can&#x27;t get thumb in with fingers.    Kind of hard to hold down to make fan run.    After I posted this review, USpicy contacted me and sent me a replacement.  I&#x27;m very impressed!</li>
    <li> Works great for the price. A couple people noted that you can&#x27;t fit your thumb in - this is true, but if you&#x27;re getting the two pack you can just pinch them together in one hand with your thumb in one and your fingers in the other.</li>
    <li> These were a cute and inexpensive little gift for my girls. They do help the drying process along faster than without them!</li>
    <li> I would give it 5 if they both worked.  Only one works.  They can be plugged in, but do not come with one.  I tried a plug on the one that wasn&#x27;t working &amp; it still didn&#x27;t work.  Wish I would have just purchased one &amp; saved my money.</li>
    <li> They&#x27;re ok.... Not super strong and still takes a while for my polish to dry. But it&#x27;s better than nothing. At some point I&#x27;ll invest in a more salon-like nail dryer.</li>
    <li> If I could do it over again, I would make the same purchase.  Does exactly what it claims it does - dry nails.</li>
    <li> Great product.  Fan works great and is strong.  Having two is nice to be able to do both hands at one time.</li>
    <li> these mini fans work great... my only complaint is that i can fit my thumb in it but i guess that is why they call them mini.</li>
    <li> I received these today, also purchased a 2nd pair for a gift.  I can&#x27;t wait to try them.  I popped batteries in just to see how powerful the fan is, which is comparable to the power of the dryer at the salon.  I am giving 4 stars because they did not come with the AC Power Supply, nor did the offering mention that the power supplies may be purchased separately.</li>
    <li> DO NOT WORK!! I bought 2 for my daughter for Christmas and we can&#x27;t use either one because they smell like something is burning and flicker on and off...  Both of us are very unhappy.</li>
    <li> I ordered the twin pack for Christmas presents, and they are so cute and will fit nicely as a stocking stuffer.  I am things about ordering more items.  I had a problem with the order at first, but that was resolved and very happy with this product.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s way too small!!! You can&#x27;t even fit your hand far enough inside to dry the thumb ....I haven&#x27;t tried to use it ... What&#x27;s the point ?? I want to return it</li>
    <li> Works great!  Powerful little fans.  My granddaughter can use it and she&#x27;s three years old.  Even my grandson, who is one and a half years old, learned how to work it and it&#x27;s safe for him to play with it.</li>
    <li> I got these for my birthday, I had asked for them because my nails take FOREVER to dry. like serioulsy I have to plan to have no activity for an hour after I do my nails otherwise all that hard work is going to be destroyed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Used these for the first time last night and they cut back on my waiting time by 30 minutes. I am happy with the product especially for the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I saw a review saying its hard to opperate but I had no trouble getting the fans to turn on. However it is hard to fit your thumb in the dryer so I dried my thumbs after my other fingers.</li>
    <li> I thought to get these for my daughter for Christmas after seeing something similar for far more money in a Pottery Barn Teen catalog.  My daughter is very into painting her nails and I thought this would be a fun addition to her routine and might help speed things up.  They arrived timely, packaged well and were up and working with no problem.  My daughter isn&#x27;t able to paint both hands and dry at the same time, so she paints one and dries one at a time so currently, we don&#x27;t have a need for both dryers!  Good value and happy with the purchase.</li>
    <li> I am editing my original review (one dryer was not working) because this company is FANTASTIC to work with!  Going through Amazon I was only able to return the item for a refund and would have to order another one.  After leaving my original review, Sunvalleytek contacted me direct via email that same day offering me an exchange, and they paid the postage for the return!  They sent me a new dryer ASAP (which works perfectly) and were very pleasant and understanding to work with!  Technology will sometimes fail us, we all know that.  The customer service this company has shown me is irreplaceable!  Thank you so much to Dava with Sunvalleytek Customer Service Department!  ORIGINAL REVIEW... These are the perfect size for my 14 year old daughter and nail tech in training.  Unfortunately, only one out of the two fans work, so we will have to pay shipping to return both of them and hope the next pair will both work.</li>
    <li> I saw these little guys on amazon and thought I would give them a try since I&#x27;m so impatient on waiting for my nails to dry. I love them!</li>
    <li> I bought these, one for home and one for vacation property.  they work great, love them</li>
    <li> Very light weight.  It takes two AAA batteries to use and there is an area where you can buy a cord (not sure what kind) and plug them in if you want to run them that way.  They turn on by pressing down with your finger tips and shut off when you let up.  They are not super quiet, but these are my first ones - maybe none of them are.  This is a great price for a twin pack.  I would order them again.</li>
    <li> I received this product on time, but only one of them works. The one that does, works pretty well</li>
    <li> these work great on kids and dry the nails fast when doing one coat. Since these are the \\&quot;Mini\\&quot; fans they do take a little bit longer to dry the nails but they are compact and can almost fit in your purse!</li>
    <li> these are battery operated although you can buy an adapter.  I really like the small size.  I can do one nail at a time or all of them.  it is very convenient.  Glad I bought them.</li>
    <li> I recently got the Twin Pack USPicy SEASHELL Portable Mini Fan Cute Size Handy Manicure Nail Dryer and Blower for my wife and she loves it!  The following information is what my said about these incredible dryers and blowers:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Seashell nail dryer is great! It is super easy to operate, all you need two AA batteries and it&#x27;s ready to work.  There aren&#x27;t all kinds of buttons you have hit to operate it.  Just one power button and you&#x27;re ready to go. The dryer and blower are ideal for drying any nail polish and acrylic nails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The size of these dryers are perfect because you can take them anywhere.  Whether you&#x27;re going over to a friends house or traveling the world.  They are very easy to pack and travel with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A friend of mine is in the hospital and I decided to surprise her and do her nails (as a way of a pick me up).  So of course I took the Seashell with me. Instant hit!  She loved these portable dryers and how fast acting and easy they were to use and it just made her feel better! Making someone happy, especially a friend, is priceless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now since it’s battery operated your nails are dried by a mini rotating fan, versus UV light dryer used in most nail salons.  UV light nail dryers have been linked to cause cancer according to certain studies, so in my opinion, I like the fan better.  It’s like having a nail salon at your house!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These dryers and blowers are the perfect items for anyone who does their own nails.  They are a sure hit and must buy!</li>
    <li> Way too small. I am a small person.  Made for children.</li>
    <li> Got this for my wife when my neighbors asked me if she was &amp;#34;special&amp;#34; because they saw her waving her hands back and forth without any observable reason.</li>
    <li> works well for home manicures! dries quickly!</li>
    <li> they work well but i had holding the switch down. I like them better for my feet than my hands</li>
    <li> Amazing product for a great price! Fast drying nails!!</li>
    <li> exactly what i was looking for and the price very good. overall if you are looking for a nice product and not a pricey one thios is the one</li>
    <li> These are perfect for traveling. Very compact and run on batteries. A big plus in my needs.. Thanks for the fast delivery and very compact nail dryer.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s to small no cord I was very disappointed</li>
    <li> Work well, good price, delivered quickly.</li>
    <li> Yes, it&#x27;s small but that&#x27;s a plus for portable nail dryers. I have small hands and naturally long nails. I use these about every week or so and it doesn&#x27;t disappoint. Fan is great with its cool air and polish dries quickly. My at home manicures are amazing as I&#x27;ve received tons of compliments from my work colleagues.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re looking for small dryers with mobility, this gets the job done at a fraction of the cost. While the set does not include an AC adapter, I am ok with replacing the AA batteries when required. I no longer have to spend an hour (or more) at a nail salon.</li>
    <li> It has never worked that well with the batteries and it has already broken.  It was purchased in Sept and was not used immediately.&lt;br /&gt;Was a gift and we are luck if it worked 6 times.  Big mistake!!!  Do not purchase.</li>
    <li> Built for a child&#x27;s hands. No power cord included</li>
    <li> Used them tonight and loved rhem! They really speed up dry time!</li>
    <li> I was satisfied with the purchase</li>
</ol>
