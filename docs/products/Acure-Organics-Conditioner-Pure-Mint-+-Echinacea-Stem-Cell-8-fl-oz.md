<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I was looking for an organic shampoo and this is it. I have fine hair and this product makes my hair fuller. The best thing is that my hair looks so good that I wash it every other day instead of daily.</li>
    <li> I have fine short hair.  The conditioner does not weigh my hair down.  It does not make my scalp any itchier than it was before.  I am also using the Acure shampoo.  Neither product works miracles, but my hair seems healthier and is not flyaway.  My hair is drier in the winter.  The conditioner has worked both in the winter and the summer, but I have to leave it on longer in the winter.</li>
    <li> I like how it untangles my dyed and highlighted hair.  Doesn&#x27;t make it flat like most and it smells terrific</li>
    <li> My hair has grown longer and healthier than ever before since I started using this shampoo &amp; conditioner - the Acure pure mint + echinacea.  It took me a few WEEKS to get used to the smell but once I got over that part I can&#x27;t stop using it - it makes my frizzy dry curls look so much better and the growth has been such a great added bonus.</li>
    <li> Nice natural conditioner, works well. Refreshing light mint scent. Decent price for a natural brand.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this conditioner.  I&#x27;ve tried just about EVERY single natural and organic brand of hair care products out there.  This is by far the BEST conditioner I have ever used.  I have fine hair, buts tons of it, and it can tend to get weighted down and oily when using other conditioners.  With this one, my hair looks shiny and soft, almost baby-hair-like in the morning after using it and very volumized.  It does an amazing job at detangling as well and you only have to use a small amount to get results, unlike other products where you practically have to use the entire bottle!  I just stocked up on this because I love it so much!</li>
    <li> Always enjoy the smell of this product.  I really think it&#x27;s a great quality.</li>
    <li> don&#x27;t love the smell, and I did not notice any type of additional volume to my hair</li>
    <li> This was my first Organics buy. I have really started be more careful of what I use on my body and what goes into it. Trying to be more healthy and take care of myself better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, I bought this with the shampoo that matches and I love it! The scent is nice and it lathers up really well, so I feel like it&#x27;s spreading throughout my hair perfectly. I have really long and fine hair so I was told to buy voluminous products. This product in particular makes my hair feel light and soft. It feels good on my scalp too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will be buying it again.</li>
    <li> It did not work for me. May work for others.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love the scent and have never had a better organic hair product than what Acure offers!</li>
    <li> I choose this because it is organic and is mint flavor, which is perfect for Summer usage. Fast shipping. Thank you!</li>
    <li> Left my hair limp and feeling greasy, and I normally have really dry hair. While it did give my hair some shine, it was so slick and ended up looking really lifeless by the end of the day.  Used it a few times, but won&#x27;t be finishing the bottle or buying again.</li>
    <li> Awesome product! Good rating on the EWG Skin Deep site (aka low toxicity) and no animal testing! Love the minty fragrance and it is the BEST natural shampoo &amp; conditioner I&#x27;ve tried - and I&#x27;ve tried a ton of them.</li>
    <li> liked it, smelled great, loved the pure and minimal ingredients - something didn&#x27;t like ultra-sensitive old me. scalp broke out.  won&#x27;t try it again.</li>
    <li> This is my go-to conditioner! I buy it every couple of months, I have thin wavy hair and post-pregnancy issues with my hair falling out and not looking as nice as it used to. I love the way that this makes my hair look and feel, i also enjoy the minty smell.</li>
    <li> Love it!  I have fine, wavy hair and this conditioner leaves my hair shiny and not weighed down. Have been recommending to my husband, family and friends...anyone who will listen!  So glad to have a product that works great and is good for you!</li>
    <li> Love this conditioner soft manageable hair with some volume!</li>
    <li> A little goes a long way. Perfect for post-keratin treatments.</li>
    <li> Its a nice product for every day use anything organic is good:) maybe i can order more n future  , not bad !</li>
    <li> I have very dry hair with a lot of frizzy ends, so I was looking for a deep conditioner. I get my hair trimmed every 5 weeks, and after using this product for a few months, my hairdresser said my ends are still dry. I didn&#x27;t get the sleek, healthy hair look I was hoping for. Also, another down-side is that bees and flies love this conditioner! Every time I use it, I&#x27;m bothered by bees and flies. I guess this is a good testament to the quality of the ingredients, but super annoying.</li>
    <li> I liked this product but I think there are cheaper organic products that work just as well. I might buy again.</li>
    <li> Intense volume. Love this low poo.</li>
    <li> My hair:  peri-menopausal crazy hair, fine wavy, oily scalp with ends that are dry/damaged from coloring, washed every three days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nothing has worked as well as Acure mint/echinacea conditioner to both calm my hair without leaving it limp and allow me to ease a wet hair comb through the knots for which fine hair is famous.  I was using mainly John Masters Rosemary conditioner (and occasionally other organic conditioners like Desert Essence coconut or Juice Organics) but none of them worked as well.  I smooth a tiny dab of J. Masters through the ends as a leave on conditioner after thoroughly rinsing out the Acure.  The two together do wonders to make my ends look healthy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For anyone with the same hair type who has been searching for a good combination of organic/natural products, here&#x27;s what (after much experimentation and $ spent on various hair concoctions) seems to work the best for me-  wash with Pura d&#x27;or hair loss prevention argan oil shampoo, then the Acure/Masters conditioners.  In order to minimize damage, I&#x27;ve taken to either allowing my hair to dry naturally or leaving it wrapped in a towel until it&#x27;s damp (as opposed to still dripping) then using a diffuser on the lowest setting to get more body at the roots.  I spray a little Aveda  Volumizing Tonic in my palms, rub them together, run them through my roots and then scrunch a small dab of Mop-Top Leave it in Conditioner into the rest of my hair.  This gives it more body than not using any styling products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Acure mint shampoo is also good but my hair seems to be a little fuller and stays clean a little longer with the Pura d&#x27;or shampoo.  Every few shampoos I use J.R. Liggett&#x27;s herbal formula shampoo bar instead of the Pura d&#x27;or.  It works well (but works best traded off with Pura d&#x27;or, may be too stripping used every shampoo for my type of hair), lasts forever and is modestly priced.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s great to finally find a combination of organic products that work well formy hair type.  Hopefully it will for you as well.</li>
    <li> This is ok but it doesn&#x27;t leave my hair looking or feeling as nice as my old bad for you conditioner did. I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s just this or if it&#x27;s all the natural conditioners but I have yet to find one that leaves my hair as soft and shiny as my old stuff. It&#x27;s not bad and as far as natural conditioners go it&#x27;s the best I&#x27;ve tried but it didn&#x27;t leave my hair as soft and manageable as I would like. I will continue to search for great natural conditioner.</li>
    <li> Horrible. Flat, dull, lifeless hair that felt caked with residue. Back to whatever is on sale at the drugstore conditioner.</li>
    <li> My favorite! I have curls, and I don&#x27;t comb out the tangles before the shower, I just use this and comb through with my fingers, no more split ends!</li>
    <li> This shampoo &amp; conditioner works better than the salon stuff I used to buy that was loaded with toxic chemicals and cost much more. The volume this product gives me is unbelievable! It smells fresh and clean but not too strong or intrusive. It leaves my hair feeling clean, not coated or stripped. In the past I would have to switch hair products every so often because it would start to feel like I was getting build up on my hair or that the products eventually didn&#x27;t work as well. I&#x27;ve been using Acure for about a year now and have not had that problem. I love that Acure has science &amp; technology behind their safe, plant based products. Everything I have tried by Acure has been wonderful, so use caution, because you might get addicted.</li>
    <li> I feel good knowing I&#x27;m not using a product filled with a bunch of chemicals. Worked good on my hair. Would buy again.</li>
    <li> Wonderful stuff. Just very small tube.</li>
    <li> I have been using the Pure Mint conditioner for about a year now, and I love it. I have fine, oily hair, and it moisturizes my hair and scalp without making my hair oily. At first I was wary of the mint scent, because I thought it would be strong or clash with more flowery/herbal fragrances. On the contrary, it is a light scent that is nice when you apply it in the shower, and I can&#x27;t smell it on my hair after it&#x27;s dry. It doesn&#x27;t clash with any other fragrances. (I only use natural fragrances or none at all).</li>
    <li> I really liked this brand for natural ingredients, contains no chemical substances under so it does not damage the hair, buy different products of this brand and that favorable results in all aspects</li>
    <li> Not totally satisfied with this product. I&#x27;m not sure if all natural hair products do the same, but I felt some build up in my hair after several days if use.</li>
    <li> Love these products. We&#x27;re big on &amp;#34;organic&amp;#34;/natural ingredients, and this fits the bill.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair seems to have more volume. It &amp;#34;feels&amp;#34; clean (this could be because of the mint smell - you can definitely feel it tingle a bit when it&#x27;s in your hair). I love the smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;d say these products are in my top 5. I&#x27;ll continue to use and buy these products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[Hair: 3A/B curly, thin]</li>
    <li> This conditioner smells good and feels good. I wish it made my hair feel cleaner for longer - I have to wash almost every other day for it not to feel oily. But I can deal with that because it&#x27;s completely organic and non-toxic. Thanks Acure!</li>
    <li> I rarely shampoo. I only wash my hair once a week or week and a half. This is the best conditioner I have found for the &amp;#34;no poo&amp;#34; lifestyle. I think it cleanses well, and it smells nice. I love anything minty, and this conditioner is perfect. My hair always feels clean and soft. I find that this conditioner also gives me the shine and body I desire.</li>
    <li> Made my fine straight hair very limp.  Did not improve the shine either.  wish I could return it.  Did not like the shampoo either.</li>
    <li> When I received the product the smell of it wasn&#x27;t so pleasant. It could have been a great hair product but I&#x27;m really picky and would much rather find a product with a scent of my liking.</li>
    <li> Im sure this stuff is great if you don&#x27;t have oily hair! I have oily hair and it makes it worse. It&#x27;s good if I dont plan on going more than a day without washing. I like that it doesn&#x27;t contain gross chemicals!</li>
    <li> I wish I would&#x27;ve known about this product sooner!!  Really works well and is safe for color treated hair too.  Will be reordering for sure!</li>
    <li> I like the company&#x27;s philosophy and the ingredients look great, but it doesn&#x27;t translate into a great conditioner.  It rinses off without absorbing much.</li>
    <li> Love it!!! Smell is wonderful and gives a tingling sensation on scalp.  I could swear my hair is falling a lot less.</li>
    <li> I bought this conditioner in conjunction with the volumizing shampoo. This conditioner comes out in a white liquid. It does not smell as minty as the shampoo, but I think it complements the shampoo well. I wish the conditioner was just a little bit thicker- it was a bit watery for my liking. I just put this throughout my ends and comb it through with a wide-toothed comb once I let it sit on my hair for a few minutes. My hair was a bit less tangley while combing the conditioner through than it is with other conditioners, so I liked that about this product. I would suggest using this in conjunction with the volumzing shampoo. Once I dried my hair, I did noticed it was softer than usual and had a bit more volume, but not a noticeable amount. My hair feels clean and smells really good after using this conditioner (along with the shampoo). I have only used it once so far, so I cannot say if my scalp will be itchy or if it gives me dandruff, but if something like that starts to happen, I will update this review and let you guys know!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this shampoo and conditioner for a few days now, but so far I am loving it. I have very curly, very fine hair that is thinning a bit in the front. These products don&#x27;t weigh my hair down at all and actually do seem to add some volume. I will update later if anything changes.</li>
    <li> Great product, I only use this product</li>
    <li> This is the best shampoo I&#x27;ve used for sensative skin and oily scalp. My daughter and I both use this.  She has very thick straight hair and I have thin hair.  It works well for both of us.</li>
    <li> Organic, safe, no grease in my hair. Switched to this after &amp;#34;no pooing&amp;#34; for a year. This is much better!</li>
    <li> This conditioner was a very pleasant surprise.  Not sure if I will continue to purchase as it is a bit watery, however, it works well and smells wonderful!</li>
    <li> I was looking for something comparable to Moroccan Oil shampoo and conditioner but for a better price. I think this product (shampoo AND conditioner) is actually better than the Moroccan oil! Leaves my hair feeling very soft and I think the product actually does add volume. At least compared to other \\&quot;volumizing\\&quot; shampoos and conditioners. Has a nice minty smell, not too overpowering. And you can&#x27;t beat the price, especially if you&#x27;re a prime member, for the amount you get in the bottles! (I have very thin, highlighted hair)</li>
    <li> This stuff makes my hair feel soft and look healthier. Plus I break out to pretty much everything and this doesn&#x27;t bother my hands to use it.. Which makes me love it even more! Try it, and you won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
    <li> Nothing feels more clean than mint! I love this conditioner, and I also use the shampoo that goes along with this. This has definitely made my hair shiny and more healthy. This is the only conditioner I have repurchased in about two years. I will definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> I love this line, it&#x27;s great for my fine, oily hair and when I need to wash my hair every day for several days in a row, this shampoo and condition doesn&#x27;t strip or dry it out.</li>
    <li> ~ Revised 5/27/13 ~&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I looked over my post and it seemed so negative with the review. I realized I shouldn&#x27;t be as harsh on the review, so I revised it a little. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I have looked every where for the right shampoo and conditioner for my hair. My hair is straight, dark brown/black, medium thin-to-thickness ratio, VERY OILY, and recently cut shoulder length. I looked thoroughly over the reviews posted to come to my decision to buy this product. I have to say this is probably one of the closest I have found to work. Yet I still get the bumps, an allergic reaction, like I do with most shampoos. **Big side note though - most people do not get this type of reaction.** I truly wish I could find a shampoo that wouldn&#x27;t do that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t want to degrade the shampoo or conditioner because I do get great volume for at least 6 hours; which for me is amazing! So the volume flattens out in the late afternoon/evening when my oil reserve comes blasting through my scalp. So there you have it, my review for this conditioner and it&#x27;s shampoo as well. I hope it helps others who may have this issue, but to not fully turn them from trying it first.</li>
    <li> This line of shampoos and conditioners is great, judged against natural and conventional ones! This has a nice slip to it without feeling oily, and the mint smell is very refreshing and not fake or plasticky. The price is good and they have good safety ratings from Environmental Working Group, so there&#x27;s just really no reason to use a conventional conditioner!</li>
    <li> I have used Purelogy and decided to give this a try.  I like this even better.  The peppermint is really invigorating and my hair looks great.  I also use the shampoo.  My only wish is that I could get it in bigger sized bottles.</li>
    <li> I use this on very long fine hair with a ouchless brush and detangling the 8yr olds hair has finally become tolerable. Strong mint smell but I like that cooling sensation.</li>
    <li> I love. It.. my hair looks and feels healthier. I definitely Would recommended this to any o e with fine or dull hair.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very pleased with this conditioner! I&#x27;ve recently become interested in using essential oils and removing synthetic products from my skin care routine. My grocery store shampoo and conditioner were the first to go! The price seems very fair - a little more than grocery store brands, but a lot less than salon brands. And the shampoo, coupled with this conditioner, does exactly what it says. My fine, limp hair is soft, fluffy and as full as it&#x27;s ever going to be - the results are much better than my previous volumizing shampoo &amp; conditioner. And the smell is fantastic! Slightly minty which can feel energizing or relaxing. Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> If you are looking for a traditional conditioner this is not your pick.  But for an organic product this works pretty well.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used a bunch of different kinds of shampoos/conditioners for fine, limp hair and nothing has worked. They usually weigh it down or make it greasy looking (which happens naturally anyway). I&#x27;ve used this for about a week and LOVE it! I love the smell, how little I have to use, how much it foams up, and that there are no chemicals in it. I have eczema on my scalp so it gets flaky during certain seasons. This shampoo/conditioner combo has worked wonders for my hair. I don&#x27;t feel like I need to put extra products in after my shower. It leaves my hair light and gives the roots body. I&#x27;ve started using this on my daughters hair also (they have the same problems).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;only thing I would change is how watery the conditioner is, I have to use a handful for my long hair, but would like to see it a little thicker instead of running through my fingers, but other than that I love everything else!</li>
    <li> I am pleased with this product over all but feel as though if used too frequently it would possibly be drying to your hair.  I however have fine/thin hair that tend to be fragile.</li>
    <li> I love this brand and was even happier when I got onto their web site and read their philosophy with high quality fair trade, natural and certified organic personal care products.  Reasonable prices as well.</li>
    <li> Chemical free and does its job!</li>
    <li> I am a 45yr old caucasion with bleached, damaged and hormonal hair.  This conditioner thickens my fine flat hair as well as it conditions.  I was able to do a nice smooth style with no frizzies!  It tingled and felt amazing on my scalp when I let it sit for about 3 minutes then I did a cold rinse which woke up my senses.  The moisture is better than the more expensive salon brands and the smell is very nice too (if you like minty fresh, and I do). Leaves my hair with a nice sheen, body and bounce.</li>
    <li> I have tried 3 of acure shampoos and I have loved everyone of them. The smell didn&#x27;t bother me and I loved the clean feeling I get after using this one. For it being clean and organic - it is at an amazing price point!</li>
    <li> I have fine hair that gets pretty oily in just one day and I shed a lot, but when I used this product I remarkably noticed a difference of more hair coming out. once in stopped using it my hair went back to normal.</li>
    <li> Best conditioner I&#x27;ve had in a while but not perfect. Price is fair. Lightweight and leaves hair very soft and healthy. There is a residue buildup after a while but my hair isn&#x27;t dry so I can easily skip a day conditioning and it evens out. I haven&#x27;t noticed much in volume. I have oily fine but a lot of it so this was a perfect fit.</li>
    <li> My favorite natural organic brand. This conditioner does not weigh the hair down but does an excellent job at conditioning and leaving the hair to feel silky and tangle-free. I have tried many organic and natural hair brands and this one is my favorite so far. I have been using for about 8 months now.</li>
