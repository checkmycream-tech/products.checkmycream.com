      <li>Love that!</li>
      <li>and it is very strong and could leave scarring as it could burn the skin.  </li>
      <li>I have many years of scarring on my body from KP.</li>
      <li>It removes a ton more layers which is what I was looking for.</li>

      <li>This is way more affective than any exfoliater I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
      <li>Otherwise, it is a bargain as an ingredient added to your favorite lotion that works for you as opposed to buying glycolic acid lotions.</li>
      <li>Some areas seem to be more smoothed out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Be sure to use the baking soda to de activate the acid.</li>
      <li>&quot; the top layers</li>
      <li>but then get better.</li>
      <li>I am so glad I purchased this stuff, it works so well for anyone who want to get rid of wrinkles, fine lines, and just blotchy skin.</li>
      <li>Happy with it so far &amp; will use it again</li>
      <li>, that was cool!</li>
      <li>, everything was so easy to press out.</li>
      <li>It is strong, but I like that about it.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Overall I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s working just fine.</li>
      <li>When I do use it consistently, 3/4 times a month, I notice a huge difference!</li>
      <li>Many complain it doesn&#x27;t peel enough,probably they require higher strength.</li>
      <li>I have also fine lines on my cheeks that are noticeable when I smile.</li>
      <li>Be sure to follow the instructions and if they aren&#x27;t informative enough, be sure to do some research online.</li>
      <li>Exactly what I thought it would be!</li>
      <li>and i love it so far!</li>
      <li>The shipping was super fast!</li>
      <li>My skin did burn but the scabs fell right off throughout the week as I walked my face.</li>
      <li>It will burn the top layer of skin off and leave it on only until right before you can&#x27;t stand it anymore.  </li>
      <li>This is my first time using a chemical peel.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m taking it slow on how often I use this product (once to twice a week), but I have seen results that have pleased me greatly in the short amount of time I&#x27;ve been using it.</li>
      <li>I was able to keep it on my skin for 5 minutes after the second time.</li>
      <li>I was probably only able to leave it on for 2 1/2-3 min.</li>
      <li>Be sure to have your baking soda and water mixed to neutralize it.  </li>
      <li>and I have a problem with big pores and fine lines, so</li>
      <li>I made my baking soda solution &amp; had it ready, cleaned my face &amp; applied as directed.</li>
      <li>On the up side once all the flakes and scabs go away I notice much fewer blackheads, redness, and acne.</li>
      <li>I really like it though.</li>
      <li>It sounds like I have a ton of acne, but really I don&#x27;t.</li>
      <li>and they fade so much.</li>
      <li>I really like this product and will order it again.  </li>
      <li>haha</li>
      <li>, I took my zit popping tool and literally pressed it against my whole face.</li>
      <li>Good quality acid, have done at least 5 peels already</li>
      <li>my first time I started with my chin and my nose, as those areas on my face aren&#x27;t as sensitive as my cheeks.</li>
      <li>It stings but mainly its itchy.</li>
      <li>Mainly this was my T zone.</li>
      <li>It will burn sensitive skin fast..</li>
      <li>First timers use low strength, to get used to the burning sensation.</li>
      <li>I followed the directions exactly and am currently on my 7th peel.</li>
      <li>Anyways, I think I&#x27;ll order a higher percentage from the same company and see how that works.</li>
      <li>so my skin is super wet</li>
      <li>But because of the product I could actually remove the junk without much effort.</li>
      <li>I am in my early twenties</li>
      <li>I have tried this about 3 times so far.</li>
      <li>Since my skin was so wet and fresh, the peel had \\&quot;eaten\\</li>
      <li>I highly recommend following the instructions that are included.</li>
      <li>I had such high hopes for this peel.</li>
      <li>Like at least 5 days or more later.</li>
      <li>Like at least 5 days or more later.ly only on the tip of my nose.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Good quality acid, have done at least 5 peels already and my acne scars have faded noticeably</li>
    <li> I have been using this and i love it so far! My face actually peels with this cause some peelings don&#x27;t make my face peel AT ALL!!!&lt;br /&gt;I LOVE THIS!!!</li>
    <li> Exactly what I thought it would be!</li>
    <li> i recommend adding a few drops to a lotion as a trial to see how your skin can react to this.  i tried this alone and it is very strong and could leave scarring as it could burn the skin.  Otherwise, it is a bargain as an ingredient added to your favorite lotion that works for you as opposed to buying glycolic acid lotions.</li>
    <li> I am so glad I purchased this stuff, it works so well for anyone who want to get rid of wrinkles, fine lines, and just blotchy skin. I had to use several times before I got desired results but totallly worthi it.</li>
    <li> This did sting but not totally intolerable. I was able to keep it on my skin for 5 minutes after the second time. I have tried this about 3 times so far. It does help my skin with break outs and gives a great healthy glow. My problem is there is a week of down time where my skin looks absolutely terrible! Dry, peeling, scabby, redness. Whenever I use this I know my skin will look terrible for 5 days before it looks good again. Not only does my skin look terrible for 5 days, but I can&#x27;t wear any makeup to cover it up because my skin is so dry. On the up side once all the flakes and scabs go away I notice much fewer blackheads, redness, and acne. I try to only use this when I&#x27;m having a break out now, I think I will spot reduce from now on. This could be 5 stars if It didn&#x27;t have any down time.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a couple of months and I went from having a few whiteheads to about 1-3. The solution burns but that means it&#x27;s working. My skin looks healthier, the pores are smaller and the peeling part isn&#x27;t too bad. I would recommend it.</li>
    <li> I love this product &amp; have recommended it to my friends and family! I have many years of scarring on my body from KP. I&#x27;m taking it slow on how often I use this product (once to twice a week), but I have seen results that have pleased me greatly in the short amount of time I&#x27;ve been using it. I diluted it to 12.5% with purified water to start with and will strengthen the solution as my skin gets used to it. There is a tingling sensation, but nothing that isn&#x27;t tolerable to me. I apply it with the brush this product came with and it works perfectly. Be sure to follow the instructions and if they aren&#x27;t informative enough, be sure to do some research online. There are plenty of articles and videos on how to use this product.</li>
    <li> I had such high hopes for this peel. I followed the directions exactly and am currently on my 7th peel. Although there is a TINY, (and I mean tiny!), difference in the redness on my face the day of the peel, it reverts back to its god-awful mess the next day. I have yet to experience ANY peeling and my acne is just as bad as it was before. I also have extreme facial keratosis pilaris and there are no differences in that either. Maybe I&#x27;ve had too much previous chemical exposure from years of trying to get rid of acne, so it didn&#x27;t affect my skin? Anyways, I think I&#x27;ll order a higher percentage from the same company and see how that works.</li>
    <li> I bought this product, not sure if it worked. There was a lot of burning off of the skin. Somehow i developed a tiny skin tag on my face before I saw this product. I used this two or three times, and it removed the skin tag, that was cool!</li>
    <li> Been getting/doing glycolic peels for years so I know what to expect, and tried this brand to try to save a lil money. It did not behave like a normal glycolic solution - not sure what is in it but I don&#x27;t trust it and returned it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used this once so far. The shipping was super fast! I followed the directions that came with it. I made my baking soda solution &amp; had it ready, cleaned my face &amp; applied as directed. I was probably only able to leave it on for 2 1/2-3 min. I was starting to itch. I then applied the soda &amp; it sizzled which was fascinating, rinsed &amp; applied aloe vera for cooling then a moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did have a few spots that seemed to scab. It did say that it could make acne worse but then get better. I&#x27;ve noticed mine got a little bit worse but not too bad. I did this on Thursday and it is now Monday, my skin is still a little sensitive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s working just fine. Can&#x27;t wait to do the 2nd application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;12/10/2014 UPDATE&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I have been using this for about 6 months. Technically I should be out but I don&#x27;t use it as often as I should, I&#x27;m lazy. I really like it though. When I do use it consistently, 3/4 times a month, I notice a huge difference! I have \\&quot;anger\\&quot; lines, the elevens between my eyebrows (I didn&#x27;t have them until I became a mother) and they fade so much. Love that! My skin is even in tone, I have less acne and its smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This last application, I like to shower after I use it so my skin is super wet, I took my zit popping tool and literally pressed it against my whole face. I pressed out any black head, or potential white head I could. It was awesome. Since my skin was so wet and fresh, the peel had \\&quot;eaten\\&quot; the top layers, everything was so easy to press out. It sounds like I have a ton of acne, but really I don&#x27;t. haha Mainly this was my T zone. But because of the product I could actually remove the junk without much effort. This morning, my skin looks good. I can see in my chin, especially, that I have fewer black heads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have also purchased the 70% from this company, but I wanted to use all the 50% and work up to it. I can handle the 50% for a little longer, about 5 minutes. It stings but mainly its itchy. I still scab but usually only on the tip of my nose. Its usually gone in a couple days and it doesn&#x27;t bother me since I&#x27;m not a working mom. I always plan my peels around my schedule. I don&#x27;t do them if I have something in the next couple days. I try to not wear makeup for those 2 days so I can peel and heal. This is way more affective than any exfoliater I&#x27;ve ever used. It removes a ton more layers which is what I was looking for. I still use an exfoliater but well after I&#x27;ve used the peel. Like at least 5 days or more later.ly only on the tip of my nose.

    <li> Very good product but needed some tutorials on how to apply it. Will do some more research and try it again some time.</li>
    <li> Just did a second treatment, once a week, I have the 70% waiting when this bottle is used up.</li>
    <li> This is my first time using a chemical peel. You can feel the stinging once it&#x27;s applied. I highly recommend following the instructions that are included. My skin did burn but the scabs fell right off throughout the week as I walked my face. I can see a difference. I will definitely purchase this again once I&#x27;m finished with my bottle.</li>
    <li> I applied this peel twice, a week between each application, leaving it on for 10 minutes each time and following the instructions exactly.&lt;br /&gt;My skin did NOT peel.&lt;br /&gt;Well actually, the only &#x27;peeling&#x27; that occurred was 3 days after the last application, three small, DEEP rough patches appeared on my upper cheeks that were very painful. Somehow in my sleep, two of them peeled off--- taking the underpart of my skin with it, drawing blood, and leaving a small chunk out of my face, totally the opposite of what this was intended to do. The rest of my skin is just dry and bothersome, even with the recommended moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m chalking this up to a &#x27;you get what you pay for&#x27; scenario.&lt;br /&gt;WOULD NOT RECOMMEND.</li>
    <li> I guess this works... Be careful. It will burn sensitive skin fast.. Happy with it so far &amp; will use it again</li>
    <li> I really like this product and will order it again.  It is strong, but I like that about it.  Be sure to use the baking soda to de activate the acid.</li>
    <li> After going to salons and hearing about facial peels I decided to try it myself. I am in my early twenties and I have a problem with big pores and fine lines, so I decided to try this peel. These are my experiences with the product:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For my first time I started with my chin and my nose, as those areas on my face aren&#x27;t as sensitive as my cheeks. I continued onto my cheeks, forehead, and upper lip and I started to feel a tingling within seconds. I only left it on for 5 mins as I wasn&#x27;t used to the burning sensation. After rinsing with cold water my face was red and blotchy, as if my impurities were dramatized and swelling. I just left it alone and decided not to use any toner or facial moisturizer, as I used it before bed. The next few days my skin started peeling and I had red scar marks in some areas. Those went away eventually.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The second, third, and fourth time I did the same process, except I left it on for 10 minutes. My skin peeled, I got red marks, and I even burned the side of my mouth which left a scar. No big. I am sure it will fade away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some things I don&#x27;t like are the red marks that look like something scratched my face, the scars it left, and the fact that the days following the peel my skin is so rough and dry. I have to apply moisturizer constantly throughout the day because my skin peels so bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HOWEVER! After seeing the results I believe that constant use of this product will outweigh the petty problems. I&#x27;ve only used this a handful of times but I have seen dramatic change in the size of pores on my nose - they seem to be less noticeable and smaller. Not entirely closed, just smaller. I have also fine lines on my cheeks that are noticeable when I smile. Some areas seem to be more smoothed out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all it&#x27;s a good product. I will have to use it longer to comment on how it affects my skin.</li>
    <li> This stuff will take your skin OFF.  Be sure to have your baking soda and water mixed to neutralize it.  It will burn the top layer of skin off and leave it on only until right before you can&#x27;t stand it anymore.  There will be some peeling, but what did you expect?</li>
    <li> This is best of the peels I have tried. To notice the difference give it about 4-5 peels two weeks apart. Many complain it doesn&#x27;t peel enough,probably they require higher strength. First timers use low strength, to get used to the burning sensation.</li>
