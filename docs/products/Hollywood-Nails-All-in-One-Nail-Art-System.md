      <li>I am still working with mine Over all I am kind of meh about ti at the moment.</li>
      <li>and I thought this would be a nice gift for her..</li>
      <li>Took some time to get the hang of it but in the end you get really nice designs on your nails.</li>
      <li>Stencils kinda work on their own with the scraper and rubber stamper</li>
      <li>and u can place it where you want on your  nails by your own hand.</li>
      <li>The metal plates are nice but the plastic &amp;#34;helper&amp;#34; is of no help.</li>
      <li>You CANT beat the price honestly Just goin to take some patience and practice.</li>
      <li>it is pretty neat and makes beautiful nails once you know how to work it.</li>
      <li>Having MS it was easy &amp; looks like I went to a salon!</li>
      <li>Stamper didn&#x27;t work,but it okay for beginners</li>
      <li>This product will work better the longer your fingernails are..</li>
      <li>My girls try so many times,its not working properly,they watched YouTube,its not what you advertise chip,useless,&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>Seems more like a child&#x27;s toy.</li>
      <li>intended to be something better, it seemed easier to use in tv channels but a lot of work</li>
      <li>you are better off using the nail rubber stamper and a scraper.</li>
      <li>it way cheaper and better made this is junk</li>
      <li>Most of the time the scraper just smears the polish on the plate.</li>
      <li>We now have lovely nails</li>
      <li>Love it...</li>
      <li>There&#x27;s got to be a better product on the market than this thing.</li>
      <li>So glad I read the reviews.</li>
      <li>daughter, who is 13, was my helper for this and two people are able to do it well.</li>
      <li>I think maybe with a better quality polish than I have it would work better.</li>
      <li>I bought this and tried many times to use it.</li>
      <li>have tried for 10 hours, sometimes a couple of hours at a time sometimes more.</li>
      <li>I was able to successfully stamp my nails.&lt;br /&gt;Since the scraper is so cheap and the rubber stamp broke so quickly all I ended up buying in the end was 7 plates, the brush/dotting tool, and a bunch of</li>
      <li>I hope I can work with it and get better because I was VERY excited to try this product..</li>
      <li>and it worked pretty good</li>
      <li>I love doing nails and was really excited and couldn&#x27;t wait to get this product.  </li>
      <li>I bought 2 sets for chritsmas gift , never work ,in the tv look easy</li>
      <li>You just have to make sure you clean off the plate after every</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t like the stamper, as it was too plush for stamping, and easily fell out of its holder.  </li>
      <li>The scraper gets junked up easily after 2 or 3 passes and won&#x27;t scrape as well.</li>
      <li>the only good thing is that they gave nice decal templates for your nails,</li>
      <li>The gems in the wheel are decent and the wheel is surprisingly large.&lt;br</li>
      <li>and it seemed fine until it wouldn&#x27;t pick it up .</li>
      <li>, I use stuff that I got from the dollar store and it works fine</li>
      <li>You have to be light when using it or it wont work well</li>
      <li>It bought this primarily to use on my toes.</li>
      <li>Had a similar thing 10 years ago and it worked great - this one not even close.</li>
      <li>It is best to find a kit that is just stamp and round plates which I do have it is by Salon Express.</li>
      <li>/&gt;The rubber stamp is cheap and broke as soon as I used it.</li>
      <li>The scraper in mine is jagged instead of smooth, the stamper falls out and doesn&#x27;t capture the polish.  </li>
      <li>The designs do not go on smoothly.  </li>
      <li>The plates don&#x27;t fit well inside the tray and cause the device to jam.&lt;br /&gt;4)</li>
      <li>This product is so cheaply made and a piece of junk.  </li>
      <li>I wasn&#x27;t a huge fan of having to clean it after every application.</li>
      <li>And since you&#x27;ll need a lot of nail polish remover to get the plate and scraper clean, you may not be able to clean it right away</li>
      <li>Then just do it fairly quick, don&#x27;t take the time screwing the brush back in bottle lol.</li>
      <li>The lever to adjust the nail setting broke the first time using it, but I still was able to use the stamping plates, and use it now just to hold my plates when I do my stamping.  </li>
      <li>First of all it has a lot of designs but most of them are for fingernails.</li>
      <li>I just got it today from my very excited husband and at first it wouldn&#x27;t work at all.</li>
      <li>There is already hassle having to clean the slider.</li>
      <li>You have to constantly clean the plates.</li>
      <li>the &amp;#34;stamper&amp;#34; is way too sticky and squishy to transfer anything cleanly.  </li>
      <li>You have to clean it after every nail.&lt;br</li>
      <li>but I don&#x27;t have to use any special polish</li>
      <li>Looks cool, but don&#x27;t bother.</li>
      <li>The unit doesn&#x27;t adhere to table top like one would expect it to and the latch to set the nail in the correct position on the guide doesn&#x27;t work very well</li>
      <li>After about an hour if fiddling around and trying to figure out how to work the thing I finally got the hang of it and the trick is to stamp it lightly and quickly and the richer and better quality polish &#x3D; better results.</li>
      <li>the system is no goos for transfering polish, it dries to quick.</li>
      <li>Shipped quickly but doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
      <li>If you do it fast, it works fine.</li>
      <li>But it has been a lot of fun for my girl</li>
      <li>rhinestones.&lt;br /&gt;Not worth it.</li>
      <li>For under $10 this was worth the gamble for me.</li>
      <li>You can&#x27;t even put the stamper in right?</li>
      <li>just right</li>
      <li>but yes u just have to do it fast for the nail polish not to dry on the plate, and richer better quality nail polish works better.</li>
      <li>Since her nails are small not all the templates fit, but she has been choosing the ones that will be a good size.  </li>
      <li>She has found using the sponge independently has been most successful since her nails are small to fit on the guide.  </li>
      <li>Most of the time not a single spec of polish would transfer.</li>
      <li>so it dries quick, fast, and in a hurry.  </li>
      <li>Once polish is painted onto the pattern you choose, and you have to put quite a lot on, you have to be very fast as the polish dries.</li>
      <li>The rhinestones and brush are the only redeeming features.</li>
      <li>At first I thought it was the polish I was using</li>
      <li>&quot; this onto the table is fiddly at best, and useless at worst.&lt;br /&gt;3)</li>
      <li>When I first tried this, the stamper would not pick up the image at all.</li>
      <li>It does not work, I tried many times and with different nail polish</li>
      <li>Also, I purchased a. Nail polish remover container that has a big push button on top that dispensed the remover which makes cleanup just a bit</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s only redeeming qualities are the gem and pointed brush.&lt;br</li>
      <li>This isn&#x27;t my first time stamping</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I bought this thinking that it would help eliminate some of the guesswork with a regular nail stamping system. I was so, so, so wrong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) This only works with the plates included. They are octagonal, and the company does NOT sell any additional designs. This is a real shame because there are so many great design plates out there that even if I could get this machine to work (see following), I still wouldn&#x27;t keep it because I can&#x27;t use standard round plates.&lt;br /&gt;2) The mechanism that \\&quot;locks\\&quot; this onto the table is fiddly at best, and useless at worst.&lt;br /&gt;3) The plates don&#x27;t fit well inside the tray and cause the device to jam.&lt;br /&gt;4) The scraper is very difficult to remove, and I imagine this would be worse with wet nails. Waiting until your nails are dry just means you have a more difficult mess to clean (as an aside, if you have someone helping you this probably is not an issue, but my husband really didn&#x27;t sign on to be my nail art apprentice, and I cannot blame him). I say \\&quot;I imagine,\\&quot; because as my following points will illustrate, at no point did I have any polish on my nails during this whole operation.&lt;br /&gt;5) You absolutely cannot see if you are aligned properly without removing the \\&quot;stamper.\\&quot; Removing the stamper just lets you peer down to see the same thing you are looking at before you \\&quot;loaded\\&quot; the stamper with polish.&lt;br /&gt;6) The rubber portion of the stamper falls out of the handle. This causes the machine to jam. It WOULD get nail polish everywhere, if the stamper picked ANY polish off the plate at all. Seriously. I took the stamper out to see where the polish was (in case I aligned wrong) and SURPRISE there was none. It was smeared all over the plate and the blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another reviewer says that the only redeeming quality was the brush/dotter and the gems, but you can get a whole SET of dotters and brushes and probably a Trump-esque quantity of gems for 20.00 so why would you put yourself through this nonsense just for that (you wouldn&#x27;t, please tell me you would not or I will lose all hope for humanity).wouldn&#x27;t, please tell me you would not or I will lose all hope for humanity).</li>
    <li> The rubber stamp would not stay in it &amp; it did not pick up the polish and put a design on your nails!</li>
    <li> This thing is horrible. It&#x27;s only redeeming qualities are the gem and pointed brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The rubber stamper falls out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The stamper doesn&#x27;t pick up the design. AT ALL.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The machine is rickety and doesn&#x27;t lock.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scraper does nothing but smear the polish all over the plates.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have NO idea why they are even allowed to sell this fraud of a product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That&#x27;s twenty bucks i&#x27;ll never get back and one VERY unsatisfied customer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FOR SHAME HOLLYWOOD NAILS! How about you stop ripping off your customers and make a product that actually works. Then do the right thing and replace all of the faulty pieces of crap we&#x27;ve wasted our money on!</li>
    <li> This was prefect for my daughter. You have to be light when using it or it wont work well but once you figure it out it works great.</li>
    <li> Missing pieces, won&#x27;t work according to factory instructions. the system is no goos for transfering polish, it dries to quick. an overall bad design.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t used it because the rubber stamp that is in the chamber to put on your nails will not stay in its place.  If this is the case I will probably not use this product EVER!!!  the only good thing is that they gave nice decal templates for your nails, only problem I can&#x27;t use them without the stamp.  NOT VERY HAPPY WiTH THIS PRODUCT!!</li>
    <li> When I first tried this, the stamper would not pick up the image at all. I sanded the rubber stamper down a bit with a nail file, as is recommended in the instructions, and washed it a few times with nail polish remover and now it works perfectly every time.  You just have to make sure you clean off the plate after every nail.&lt;br /&gt;It is a little tricky yet to get the position just right but I don&#x27;t have to use any special polish, I use stuff that I got from the dollar store and it works fine (some reviews have said you can only use special stamping polish).&lt;br /&gt;Considering I bought this at Dollar General for my daughters nails, I would say it was worth the $20 I spent on it.</li>
    <li> THE STAMP DIDNT WORK CORRECTLY!!!</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work. Not worth the money at all. Stamp doesn&#x27;t pick up anything even after filed down some. Save the $.</li>
    <li> Funny contraption. Seems more like a child&#x27;s toy.</li>
    <li> Terrible!!  Wont stamp at all!  Tried many different options read all directions and viewed YouTube tutorials and this darn machine wouldn&#x27;t do anything!  Waste of money!</li>
    <li> The machine does not work but if you take the &amp;#34;stamper&amp;#34; and use an old credit card it does work. The designs on the plates are outdated and ugly. The scraper is small and hard to eat. This machine gets dirty easily. the only good thing is the jewls and the dotting/brush , but could order better on amazon for way cheaper. :(</li>
    <li> I bought 2 sets for chritsmas gift , never work ,in the tv look easy but in reality not work in anyway</li>
    <li> I think maybe with a better quality polish than I have it would work better. Also with much practice. I am still working with mine Over all I am kind of meh about ti at the moment. I hope I can work with it and get better because I was VERY excited to try this product.. Also my 8 year old daughters fingers are too small for the device. Which was disappointing. You CANT beat the price honestly Just goin to take some patience and practice. I wasn&#x27;t a huge fan of having to clean it after every application. I will say this.. This product will work better the longer your fingernails are.. I am currently working on growing mine out specifically for this reason!</li>
    <li> The designs don&#x27;t transfer onto the stamp at all. This was a complete waste of my time and money. My daughter is terribly upset and disappointed with this.</li>
    <li> followed directions..wont stamp onto nail..very diappointed, i bought this for my daughters birthday and it doesnt work at all, what a waste of money!!</li>
    <li> didn&#x27;t transfer the image that great.  and yes i have several stamping tools but this one was a bit difficult to get the image to transfer with out smearing a part of it.</li>
    <li> I usually don&#x27;t write reviews but I had to for this thing because I was so disappointed. It bought this primarily to use on my toes. First of all it has a lot of designs but most of them are for fingernails. There&#x27;s only 5 that are just for toes - points off for that. You can use the fingernail designs on your toes but they&#x27;ll be small.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The rubber stamper will not pick up the design. I&#x27;d say for every 10 tries, 1 time would the design completely transfer. Most of the time not a single spec of polish would transfer. The instructions say to file the stamper first but doing that causes the stupid thing to fall out. Plus even doing that doesn&#x27;t always work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Its also very messy. After trying so many times to actually get a design to transfer, you&#x27;ll end up with a mess. Most of the time the scraper just smears the polish on the plate. The scraper gets junked up easily after 2 or 3 passes and won&#x27;t scrape as well. On top of that, the scraper is really hard to clean. And since you&#x27;ll need a lot of nail polish remover to get the plate and scraper clean, you may not be able to clean it right away or you&#x27;ll mess up your fresh manicure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After my third or fourth use, the buttons used to pop the scraper up completely locked up so now I can&#x27;t get the scraper back into place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one or two times I&#x27;ve managed to successfully use this thing to put a design on my nails, I&#x27;ve gotten compliments. However with this thing, its too messy, too time consuming, and too much of a hassle to use. There&#x27;s got to be a better product on the market than this thing.</li>
    <li> After getting this for my girl and seeing her frustrated and dogging out my cheesy gift for a week I gave it a try. The trick was to clean the rubber stamp pad with acetone, as well as all other parts. Then just do it fairly quick, don&#x27;t take the time screwing the brush back in bottle lol. I showed her, now she&#x27;s stamped pink.</li>
    <li> it does not work like it said very unhappy money spent for nothing would like more information on how to use cause it does not have much</li>
    <li> It was pretty much uselss. Do not buy it.</li>
    <li> The metal plates are nice but the plastic &amp;#34;helper&amp;#34; is of no help.</li>
    <li> This product is the worst product I&#x27;ve ever had.... Simply just wasted my money. Never buy this product its a rip off!!!</li>
    <li> Had a little trouble at bigining</li>
    <li> I  FOLLOW THE INSTRUCTION CORRECTLY BUT IT DIDN&#x27;T TRANSFEREDE THE DESIGN AT ALL. TRYED IT A COUP;E OF TIME WITH DIFFERENT DESIGN BUT NOTHING. WASTE OF MONEY!</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work. I want. My money back</li>
    <li> Shipped quickly but doesn&#x27;t work. Don&#x27;t waste your money on this one. I have tried numerous time to get it to work&lt;br /&gt;properly but with no luck.</li>
    <li> I just got it today from my very excited husband and at first it wouldn&#x27;t work at all. We thought it was defective! Then I read some reviews and realized that I needed to gently file the stamp down for it to work and it worked. Getting it aligned properly can take a few tries but once you get the hang of it, it works pretty well. The scraper gets stuck on some of the plates causing it to jam a little and the rubber stamp does fall out sometimes and also jams it up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re looking for a professional quality nail stamper, this is probably not for you. But if you&#x27;re just looking to have some fun or if it&#x27;s for early teen or tween girls, go for it! They&#x27;ll have a blast with it as long as you file the rubber down a bit and be sure to clean the scraper or it gets a little gunked up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope that helps!</li>
    <li> This product is so cheaply made and a piece of junk.  The rubber bottom is very flimsy and does not stick to hold it tight.  I did all the tips and tricks and even watched a you tube video to get this thing to work.  I worked and worked with it and tried all the tips I could find on the internet.  I love doing nails and was really excited and couldn&#x27;t wait to get this product.  After working with it over and over again I could not get it to work well and then it started breaking on me.  Please don&#x27;t waist your money on this stamping system.</li>
    <li> This is as advertised.  The price is very good.</li>
    <li> I have never used this, since it falls apart when I attempt to practice.  In fact it arrived with one  of the pieces out of place.</li>
    <li> thanks to everyone&#x27;s tips, i didn&#x27;t have to spend weeks of frustration.  i actually got my first image within a couple of hours. i have also found an online sight that sells the octagonal plates.  i really like using my hollywood nails</li>
    <li> I bought this item and am deeply disappointment. They make it look so effortless on TV. Please don&#x27;t waist your money it belongs in the garbage</li>
    <li> My girls try so many times,its not working properly,they watched YouTube,its not what you advertise chip,useless,&lt;br /&gt;I am not recommended this piece at all</li>
    <li> very cheap made, polish won&#x27;t stick the the rubber, will not stay stuck to the table, waste of money, the only reason I sent it back is because i previously purchased the other kit that you do yourself, and I&#x27;m gonna keep the plates and the bonus gift, but other than that I wouldn&#x27;t buy another one !!!</li>
    <li> DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT.&lt;br /&gt;Once it has been opened you cannot return it.&lt;br /&gt;I have tried for 10 hours, sometimes a couple of hours at a time sometimes more. The stamp does come onto your nails, but it is very faint, does not look anything like on the ads, and it is really a two person job. Once polish is painted onto the pattern you choose, and you have to put quite a lot on, you have to be very fast as the polish dries. You have to position your nail in the nail guard first to have any chance of having a decent picture on your chosen nail. Then the plate has to be cleaned of excess polish before doing it again. This can be tricky when you have polished nails, as the cotton pad you use to wipe the polish off the plate will also rub off some of the polish off of the nail you are holding the cotton in. The nail guard really needs to be positioned for every nail, as pinkie nails are smaller than others and therefore the centre of the nail is different. I am VERY disappointed with this product. I am sure the company has sold many millions, and made their money as, once opened and tried, and it fails, you cannot return.&lt;br /&gt;DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT.</li>
    <li> This product has been a hit with my 9 yr old dd.  She has been familiarizing herself with it and by the second time she had the hang of it.  I warned her it may take some practice due to the reviews already posted.  She has been experimenting.  Since her nails are small not all the templates fit, but she has been choosing the ones that will be a good size.  She has found using the sponge independently has been most successful since her nails are small to fit on the guide.  The unit doesn&#x27;t adhere to table top like one would expect it to and the latch to set the nail in the correct position on the guide doesn&#x27;t work very well so I could not give it 5 stars.  But it has been a lot of fun for my girl and she is ready to do my nails too.  As she said, &amp;#34;I wish I had 100 nails.&amp;#34;  Overall, a hit with her.  The price seemed fair-but wouldn&#x27;t pay the MSRP.</li>
    <li> This is terrible.Could not use it at all. I want a refund on this product. My daughter is very upset that this product did not work as described. You use your fingernail polish to paint over the design that you want on your nails then use the scrapper to get excess polish off and then stamp down on the design to get the design on the rubber stamper and then you push the rubber stamper down on the fingernail and then guess what?? NOTHING HAPPENS!! This is clearly a waste. I just got mine yesterday and I am going to contact the seller today!! Will post and let you know what happens.</li>
    <li> Stamper didn&#x27;t work,but it okay for beginners</li>
    <li> Not worth the money.  Tossing it.  The ridges on the plates are to shallow and do not hold enough polish to stamp 1 finger.  Looks cool, but don&#x27;t bother.</li>
    <li> hate this product, it doesnt work that well, cheap item to be short. you might as well get your nails done at the salon for this price</li>
    <li> This doesn&#x27;t work as described...at all.</li>
    <li> no easy to use. no funtions</li>
    <li> my friends and I are very happy with the set and have recommended it to others.  We now have lovely nails</li>
    <li> Waste of money except for plates does not work and made crappy the stamper does not even work at all if looking for something that works I bought the salon express stamper after this and was amazed it does work and it way cheaper and better made this is junk</li>
    <li> I bought this as a christmas gift for my daughter. I know she loves to do her nails and I thought this would be a nice gift for her..</li>
    <li> this item will not stay in place, just wasted some of my gift card.</li>
    <li> Sorry but this item is poor quality and doesn&#x27;t work. I purchased it for my tween nieces and all is caused was frustration.</li>
    <li> This product does not work the way the directions state it should work. At first I thought it was the polish I was using but this is junk.</li>
    <li> The lever to adjust the nail setting broke the first time using it, but I still was able to use the stamping plates, and use it now just to hold my plates when I do my stamping.  Additionally, it did come with a dotting tool, and gems.  I didn&#x27;t like the stamper, as it was too plush for stamping, and easily fell out of its holder.  Luckily I had ordered the Konad stamping kit that had the scraper and stamper, otherwise it would have been a waste.</li>
    <li> It doesn´t work. It didn´t do what the add on the tv says.</li>
    <li> Love it... It works just as it shows... Thanks sooo much....</li>
    <li> I was ready to return this, when I read the reviews. You must be fast or the polish dries and will not leave an image. If you do it fast, it works fine. So glad I read the reviews.</li>
    <li> I saw this at 5 and below and thought why not give it a try. The only reason I&#x27;m glad I got it is because is comes with a gem wheel. The scraper was sideways! You can&#x27;t even put the stamper in right? Seriously? Next I tried using an old keychain to scrap and it seemed fine until it wouldn&#x27;t pick it up . Then if it did it wouldn&#x27;t transfer to my nail. Next the cheap rubber crap that they use as a &amp;#34;stamper&amp;#34; started peeling and came apart within the first week.</li>
    <li> It does not work, I tried many times and with different nail polish but the stamp does not transfer the design into the nail...do not loose your money buying this garbage</li>
    <li> intended to be something better, it seemed easier to use in tv channels but a lot of work</li>
    <li> My problem is not with the product but with the packaging.  Everything seems to be included but the clear plastic packages are cracked badly and because they are to be given as gifts, I do not want to open them to make sure that nothing is missing.  It did say that they were new where I bought them.</li>
    <li> Not working as u said it would it was a bad idea that I bought this shoud considered it b4</li>
    <li> I agree with all of the other 1-star reviews. Total piece of crap.</li>
    <li> It looked like this was previously used, there was pink nail polish on it and black nail polish on the stamp. I&#x27;m extremely disappointed.</li>
    <li> I bought this and tried many times to use it. The metal plates were not deep enough on the design and I could not get it to stamp a design for my life. I would not recommend this at all to anyone. I got my money back. It is best to find a kit that is just stamp and round plates which I do have it is by Salon Express. It works great the dauber to use on the plates catches the polish fine and u can place it where you want on your  nails by your own hand. This is just not work the money.</li>
    <li> Not worth a dime and not worth your time... If I could rate this with no stars I would.... It will not even stamp anything... I bought stamping nail polish and none of them work....I bought one of those little cheap hand held ones and it actually works.... How can I describe this one JUNK!!!! JUNK!!!!JUNK!!!!!</li>
    <li> very disappointed in this product.</li>
    <li> very very bad quality&lt;br /&gt;they aren&#x27;t working at all</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.  The stamper won&#x27;t pick up the image.</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t work. I tried several different nail polish brands and colors. Nothing worked. Great idea just wish it worked. $20 isn&#x27;t worth the trouble of sending it back for a refund. I just threw it away out of frustration.</li>
    <li> my daughter loves it. now she is decorating her nails a the time trying al the different designs  thanks.</li>
    <li> My wife loves this product.</li>
    <li> The scraper it includes is too thin to scrape properly, and gets gunked up after the second scraping. You have to clean it after every nail.&lt;br /&gt;The rubber stamp is cheap and broke as soon as I used it. It was cut in half by the plastic portion pressing down on it.&lt;br /&gt;After replacing the stamp rubber with another I had laying around (of much better quality) I was able to successfully stamp my nails.&lt;br /&gt;Since the scraper is so cheap and the rubber stamp broke so quickly all I ended up buying in the end was 7 plates, the brush/dotting tool, and a bunch of rhinestones.&lt;br /&gt;Not worth it.</li>
    <li> My particular one, the rubber stamp keeps coming off, you can&#x27;t press too hard or else the rubber starts tearing from the edges where the rim is, plus since the rubber keeps coming off the stamp is too low and as you slide into the nail the design comes off smudged ... however I&#x27;m giving it some stars BECAUSE if you some how glue the rubber on to the stamper, and as you slide the print you can lift the stamper up as you are sliding it into the nail and it works. There is already hassle having to clean the slider. The stamp and the rubber, to having to deal with rubber coming off and tearing, ....I just got it in the mail and used it for the first time, and hour later the rubber is torn, now to have go and get it replaced somehow somewhere.......but it prints beautifully</li>
    <li> The designs do not go on smoothly.  It becomes messy and gooey. You have to constantly clean the plates. The rhinestones and brush are the only redeeming features. Other than that it is awkward to use.</li>
    <li> I bought this at the store and i was so mad and upset  i tried returning it because i couldn&#x27;t get not even a drop of nail polish of the design even on the little sponge. I tried returning it but they said it had been used so i couldn&#x27;t, i was so mad, the girl there told me she had one that i just had to do it fast and get the hang of it.&lt;br /&gt;Well i decide to give it another try and it worked pretty good i got so happy i had to come levee a review lol but yes u just have to do it fast for the nail polish not to dry on the plate, and richer better quality nail polish works better.</li>
    <li> I needed a new stamper and I was hoping this would make stamping my nails quicker and easier too.  The scraper in mine is jagged instead of smooth, the stamper falls out and doesn&#x27;t capture the polish.  I&#x27;ve tried all suggestions and it&#x27;s still a piece of junk.  I even tried taking the machine apart and stamping my fingers the way you&#x27;re supposed to use it on your toes (using a different scraper of course) and the polish just won&#x27;t adhere even after filing it a little bit and giving it a good cleaning.  This isn&#x27;t my first time stamping so I know how fast you need to move before the polish dries and won&#x27;t transfer to a stamper or nail so I know it&#x27;s not operator error.  The only good thing about this purchase is the rhinestones and art tool which can be purchased individually for a fraction of the price.</li>
    <li> After about an hour if fiddling around and trying to figure out how to work the thing I finally got the hang of it and the trick is to stamp it lightly and quickly and the richer and better quality polish &#x3D; better results. Was very frustrated at first and thought it was a piece of garbage but I take that back it is pretty neat and makes beautiful nails once you know how to work it. The best tips on how to use are just to watch a YouTube video review of the product</li>
    <li> This is very hard to use, but it does work after some practice. Also, not all nail polishes will work with this item. Just keep that in mind. The designs and gems together make it look like a professional did my nails each time.</li>
    <li> This device will frustrate you, the nail polish dries up so fast it doesnt even stamp a design on the nails,  you are better off using the nail rubber stamper and a scraper. The only thing I liked about this product was that it came with the little nail jewels and design plates . I recommend looking up on ( how to do your nails on youtube ) with only the nail rubber stamper it will save you money.</li>
    <li> It came exactly as described. I am extremely happy with this purchase and would recommend to others.</li>
    <li> Do not order this product , it doesn&#x27;t work! I tried to get my money back from this company and it was nothing but hassle!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been stamping my nails for a few years.  I have to say, it took me a LOT of practice at first just to get a complete image on a single nail!  I was SO, SO frustrated for a couple of weeks.  I could only do so much each day before getting frustrated and nearly disgusted.  I made a pretty sizable mess with all my mistakes!  BUT, it REALLY can be done with some patience, and a bit of practice!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The biggest tip I can give anyone is once you apply the polish to the plate, you only have seconds to get that stamp on your nail.  If you think about it, you&#x27;re applying a much thinner layer of polish to the plate than you would if you were applying polish so it dries quick, fast, and in a hurry.  Also, I purchased a. Nail polish remover container that has a big push button on top that dispensed the remover which makes cleanup just a bit easier!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I took a star off because of the exclusive plates as someone else mentioned.  I already have a big set of circular plates but, being able to position my fingers is a pretty big deal.</li>
    <li> i recieved  fast but the stamp didnt work ,for that reason i returned it.my wife try everything  but it never work</li>
    <li> My grandaughter loves it, she&#x27;s using it every week!</li>
    <li> I would not recommend this product at all.  It broke whilst I was doing my daughters nails.  If you still wonder if you should purchase this message me and I will send photos of what broke for you to see yourself the shocking quality.</li>
    <li> Took some time to get the hang of it but in the end you get really nice designs on your nails.</li>
    <li> Won&#x27;t work for me, don&#x27;t know why.  May work well for you though.</li>
    <li> Bought this on a whim for my daughters.  It simply does not work.  If I guess I would say that the etching into the metal plates is not deep enough.</li>
    <li> Great idea - cheaply made. The whole thing won&#x27;t stay locked in place and the nail guide won&#x27;t stay locked in place so the designs end up on the plastic than my nail. Stencils kinda work on their own with the scraper and rubber stamper but it&#x27;s hard to judge the center of your nail. Had a similar thing 10 years ago and it worked great - this one not even close.</li>
    <li> Takes a lot of practice i was really mad at first when it didn&#x27;t work the trick is to sand the rubber thing down and stamp the image really FAST</li>
    <li> I just tried this with my very excited daughter and couldn&#x27;t get a single stamp to transfer to her nails.  We gave up and I just used the brush/dotter and gems to do an impromptu design.  I&#x27;m following the instructions and can&#x27;t get any polish to transfer to the rubber stamp.</li>
    <li> The plate is good. The machine seems quite hard to operate. However, i take out all the parts to use it has a good results.</li>
    <li> ok not the best nail stamper, sometimes it works sometimes it dont</li>
    <li> very nice nail art system i really like it.</li>
    <li> It took some time, but I got the hang of it &amp; I get compliments all the time. Having MS it was easy &amp; looks like I went to a salon! Even have a backup. Bought extra plates on Amazon!</li>
    <li> total crap! the &amp;#34;stamper&amp;#34; is way too sticky and squishy to transfer anything cleanly.  I&#x27;m going to try and use the plates with my other stamper but I dont have much hope.  The plate designs arent carved very deep so i dont see it working at all!  Good uck to anyone who can get this thing to work!</li>
    <li> too hard to work with, my daughter said her came in a new package but looked used.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work...don&#x27;t waste your money. Just recently bought a individual stamp&amp; scraper set, hoping it will work better. Have two stars bc the plates are usable</li>
    <li> Very week product the rubber part came of the same day I got it</li>
    <li> For under $10 this was worth the gamble for me. The gems in the wheel are decent and the wheel is surprisingly large.&lt;br /&gt;My daughter, who is 13, was my helper for this and two people are able to do it well. It added a lot of speed and stability to the process.&lt;br /&gt;I have other octagonal plates from other nail projects that fit this. Always remember to peal the plastic protective coating off of the plates before you use them.&lt;br /&gt;Here is how I do it;&lt;br /&gt; I dropped the paint, swiped the stamper part back and quickly swiped it forward and stamped. I would repeat this process for one hand. I clean the plate in between the first and second hand. Then I repeat for the second hand.  We moved the nail guide up toward the center for my daughter&#x27;s longer nails, and back for my shorter nails.</li>
