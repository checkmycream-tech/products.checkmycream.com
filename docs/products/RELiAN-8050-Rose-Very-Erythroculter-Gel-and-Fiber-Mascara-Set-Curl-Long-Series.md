      <li>I do have really sensitive eyes though.  </li>
      <li>For example, I am attentive about the outer tops/bottom lashes, and I tend to do a second or third coat just on them to make them fan out...but only the last 1/5 of my eyelid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>apply the transplanting gel to one set of upper or lower lashes 4)apply the natural fiber to the lashes you just put the transplanting gel on 5)apply the transplanting gel over the lashes you put the natural fibers on.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I&#x27;m so in love with this product and it was here within a day</li>
    <li> But I have really sensitive eyes.</li>
    <li> My fav fiber mascara ever!</li>
    <li> I love these. I apply it one time in the morning a couple coats of each. They do shed however so keep an eye for the little black fibers throughout the day.</li>
    <li> I watched a tutorial on-line to show you how to use this type of mascara.  If you regularly wear mascara you should have no problem with the application of this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) Curl your lashes 2)apply a thin coat of your regular mascara on all top and bottom lashes 3) apply the transplanting gel to one set of upper or lower lashes 4)apply the natural fiber to the lashes you just put the transplanting gel on 5)apply the transplanting gel over the lashes you put the natural fibers on.  Repeat if you want longer lashes, otherwise go ahead and follow these steps on the other upper and lower lashes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The end result looks really good. Nice long, full lashes.  They stay on all day  and don&#x27;t irritate my eyes.  The product also washes off very easy with soap and water.</li>
    <li> This mascara makes your lashes longer and feels goof on...however, the direction are in Chinese with no English translation except on this website. I have to log on to Amazon every time I want to use it.</li>
    <li> This is literally the nest thing in the world.wish i could upload a picture to show you guys.just look it up on YouTube on how to use it. Its simple. Just as good as the high brand ones</li>
    <li> It works, it  lengthens my lashes. What mascaras promise to do but dont lol. Just dont put too much of the fibers cause it will become clumpy. The directions are in chinese but all you have to look is on the description on here and it tells you what to do.</li>
    <li> Used this several times.  People ask if my lashes are fake.  I love it but it&#x27;s cheap and the fibers fall off throughout the day.  Annoying to constantly check if I have it on my face all day.  It&#x27;s good for a couple hours use at a time and as long as you aren&#x27;t going to sweat.</li>
    <li> I love the ease n look of this. However it flakes easily and you have to constantly check and wipe your eyes. The fibers get into your eyes easily even after applying the liquid coat over a few times</li>
    <li> Product works just as they say it will. If you open both tubes and have them ready your able to apply just as instructed! Only down side may be that the fibers can get into your eye. But, goes away quickly.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t live without it</li>
    <li> My only compliant is that they don&#x27;t have instructions in english.  The photos are pretty self explanatory and there is always youtube, but I felt funny giving this away as a gift without instructions</li>
    <li> Nice little package for a low price</li>
    <li> This stuff didn&#x27;t work for me it was just a big mess!  Sorry I purchased it!</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t live without it, since I&#x27;ve tried it! Fun and addictive, very effective! works wonders, thickens and lengthens. i can&#x27;t go anywhere without someone asking if my lashes are real or what mascara I use!!!</li>
    <li> When I wear it, people think I have on fake eyelashes. I love it. Will order again!!</li>
    <li> So, like everyone else I saw the \\&quot;expensive\\&quot; stuff advertised on fb. I thought I would be smarter and check amazon for an off brand. Bought this..was wowed. One week after use I noticed every time I washed this off my eyelashes were coming out with it. They weren&#x27;t just falling out but breaking off too. I ended up with shorter eyelashes after using this for a week. I decided to try the younique brand and fell in love. No more lashes falling out and looked better, felt better, yes, the expensive stuff just is better. I joined the company that&#x27;s how much I loved the other stuff. If you want the real stuff that wont make your lashes fall out check out www.youniqueproducts.com/lisaslate but whatever you do if you want to keep your lashes don&#x27;t use this stuff! Its been a month and a half and they are just now growing back!</li>
    <li> I recommend buying this over the younique brand. I never purchased the younique brand but this does the trick for a fraction of the price &amp; is much better than false eyelashes that can fall off &amp; look tacky.</li>
    <li> This product was dry and unusable</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t like it so much. My mascara from Victoria Secret actually worked better.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m still using the mascara, but the fiber part didn&#x27;t come off the brush like I felt it should have.</li>
    <li> Nice dup for Younique 3D mascara if you don&#x27;t want to pay the higher price.  If you&#x27;ve never used fiber lashes before, you might want to research the cons (fibers falling onto face, lord help you if one gets in your eye,  can seem clumpy)... but if you&#x27;re searching for a low cost fiber system,  this one does the trick.</li>
    <li> would be great if it didn&#x27;t shed...</li>
    <li> I tried Younique, and loved the product but not the price.  I tried several of the mascara&#x27;s that claimed to be the same, and my search is over.  The bottles are beautiful, and so are my lashes.</li>
    <li> Love love love!!! Made all my friends get this!!!! I swear this product gives me life.... I love this mascara!!!!</li>
    <li> The fibers would get into my eyes. It also made my eyelashes look clumpy...not a fan at all.</li>
    <li> Received a cpl of days ago was so excited 2 try but after I did I&#x27;m  very disappointed in this item it&#x27;s dry and hard 2 use.when you put it on its clumpy and takes forever plus it takes a couple of days 2 remove .is not worth the $12.99 or the trouble.plus this item made my eyes burn .it was not in my eyes though. .</li>
    <li> Fibers are too thin &amp; short. They don&#x27;t stick to your lashes &amp; flake on your face &amp; into your eyes. Don&#x27;t waste you&#x27;re money. I&#x27;ve used similar products that are far superior.</li>
    <li> Is very nice it is something the help me to more beautiful and the better part is the it doesn&#x27;t cost a fortune !!!thanks</li>
    <li> Love it...works like a charm...my go to mascara..I can wear this and lip gloss and I&#x27;m good to go!</li>
    <li> leaves eyelashes clumpy and is not easily to remove</li>
    <li> horrible product. the fibers went straight into my eyes every time i blinked.. i will never buy it again.. waste of my money</li>
    <li> Works just as well as the party brand. For best results, apply as follows:&lt;br /&gt;Apply a thin coat of your regular mascara (powder too if you tend to have runny mascara during the day). Be sure to separate your lashes as you normally do. Let dry.&lt;br /&gt;Do only one eye at a time. Apply adhesive (this smells like glue, chemical like, and although I have had no problems, I am very careful about not letting the tip have a glob on it that could get into my eye. I also use my normal mascara to thicken up the base of my lashes, and use this more for the middle and ends.)&lt;br /&gt;Apply lashes.  Then apply adhesive again (seal in the coat of the lashes.)&lt;br /&gt;Do the other eye...check them out...decide if you need/want another coat. Repeat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can do the lower lashes, but I find them too babydoll looking (falsies), which doesn&#x27;t work for the workday.&lt;br /&gt;You can also play.  For example, I am attentive about the outer tops/bottom lashes, and I tend to do a second or third coat just on them to make them fan out...but only the last 1/5 of my eyelid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Most of all, practice. Each time you will get better...oh, and keep a brush from an old mascara, clean well, and use to help separate/clean up when you accidentally get a big clump.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried 4 different versions of this by different manufacturers and will be giving the same post/review to all because in my opinion they all do the same job well. Really it just takes a little patience and practice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S. I work out most evenings and sweat well and my eyes are still fine. I do use a makeup pad remover like Almay to remove gently at night.</li>
    <li> I would have given this 5 stars but it makes my eyes itch.  Other than that it looks amazing, without the hassle of false eyelashes.  There weren&#x27;t any instructions, and everything on the box was in Chinese.</li>
    <li> Natural looking, it&#x27;s all about how heavy you apply it. Fast delivery.</li>
    <li> At First I Was Second Guessing About Buying This Because of The Reviews. BUT! Don&#x27;t Let The Reviews Persuade You. This Was Great For The Price</li>
    <li> Flakes off in my eyes when applying the fiber. Seriously annoying to try to fish out... Not worth it. Just grab false lashes!</li>
    <li> Best one out there! !!!</li>
    <li> Does what it say it will, beats paying 30-40$ for a top brand.  I just found it to really irritate my eyes after a few hours of wearing it and for a couple days after.  I do have really sensitive eyes though.  It kind of smells bad too, only when being applied though.</li>
    <li> took me about 4 times to use it right.  Take your time the first time!  Have a empty/clean eyelash brush to separate after fibers dry to &amp;#34;un-clump&amp;#34;.  Looks great but not an all day/all night makeup.</li>
    <li> Still getting the hang of it. Seem to do a satisfying result.</li>
