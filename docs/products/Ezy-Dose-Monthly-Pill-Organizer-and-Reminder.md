      <li>so you don&#x27;t miss or take too many pills.</li>
      <li>I ended up buying a different pill organizer which I&#x27;m very happy with!</li>
      <li>Love this product.</li>
      <li>However, I would give it one star, at the most, for quality of construction.  </li>
      <li>and I wouldn&#x27;t be able to tell.  </li>
      <li>Returning this item cost more than the cost of the item</li>
      <li>Great pill organizer for helping older people manage their medications.</li>
      <li>Like it but top comes off easily.</li>
      <li>but I can see how or when I need to renew but most importantly I can tell if I missed a day.  </li>
      <li>I ended up ordering the \\&quot;31 day mini pill organizer\\&quot; (http://www.amazon.com/31-Day-Mini-Pill-Organizer/dp/B002XRGXTK/ref&#x3D;pd_sbs_hg_6), for just a couple of dollars more and it will work fabulously.  </li>
      <li>This organizer makes it easy and convenient to keep track of your pills</li>

      <li>I take three pills in the morning and they all fit and could probably fit more.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s easy to travel with  --</li>

      <li>It saves a HUGE amount of time -- fill it once a month</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s HUGE and not for traveling</li>
      <li>This is great because you only fill them once a month.  </li>
      <li>1 was a primary</li>
      <li>Light weight seemingly air tight(ish) seal.  </li>
      <li>This is the perfect size for what the supplements I take everyday</li>
      <li>It is definitely worth it!</li>
      <li>Would also be good for those who are younger and have to take a lot of medications.</li>
      <li>Thanks. :)</li>
      <li>The reason I like this pill dispenser is because it holds a full month of medications</li>
      <li>Simple, cheap, effective.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It also helps as a quick way of counting to verify count from pharmacy.</li>
      <li>Very convenient and easy to use.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s exactly what my husband was looking for!  </li>
      <li>and opened the lid it snapped right off at the hinge.</li>
      <li>Clearly labeled and easy to see the pills inside.  </li>
      <li>When I first received this pill organizer, I too had problems with the lids closing.  </li>
      <li>However, upon my first use, one of the lids broke off.  </li>
      <li>But after using it for a while, I realized I didn&#x27;t have the lids (which are really just one piece!)</li>
      <li>Sad, because otherwise excellent for pill management.</li>
      <li>Love that I only have to fill once a month and not weekly.</li>
      <li>I wish I had seen it first.  </li>
      <li>She likes being able to set up an entire month&#x27;s medication at one time.  </li>
      <li>I first want to state that one of the lids was cracked when I received it</li>
      <li>Construction seems pretty sturdy.</li>
      <li>Two of the doors broke off the first time I used it.</li>
      <li>I bought this for my grandmother since she has so many pills to take daily</li>
      <li>just took out the second one of these and filled it, now THE VERY FIRST TIME I opened day #17 to fill it, the lid snapped off at the hinge.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>This would be good if you took ONE or 2 small pills a day.</li>
      <li>I put large rubber bands on the container hoping that would work.  </li>
      <li>It is a pretty decent product.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not like we&#x27;re overly zealous about getting to our vitamins in the morning, so they really shouldn&#x27;t have fallen off.</li>
      <li>I take the following (&amp; all fit with room to spare) - (1) baby aspirin,</li>
      <li>Cheap plastic and nonexistent quality control equates to a big no-no if you are considering this item for your medication needs.</li>
      <li>Fast shipping.  </li>
      <li>This becomes an issue because the covers don&#x27;t always snap into place very well.  </li>
      <li>and I can fill it up for a whole month.</li>
      <li>I filled mine up, dropped on the floor and it did not open.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this product!</li>
      <li>Much to my surprise</li>
      <li>the shipping was super fast for regular shipping.</li>
      <li>After less than a month of use, two more hinged doors broke off.  </li>
      <li>I would pay a bit more if the materials would stand up to daily (sometimes twice daily) usage.</li>
      <li>They fit back on and close, they just come off completely.</li>
      <li>THESE ARE MADE SO CHEAP AND POORLY that there is now way you will get more than a couple months out of it,&lt;br /&gt;LOOK</li>
      <li>even that didn&#x27;t help as the lids popped up under the tight fitting rubber bands.  </li>
      <li>I would highly recommend this.</li>
      <li>I like the idea of having a month&#x27;s worth of pills in an organizer, but this one has several problems.  </li>
      <li>Two compartment tabs broke on the first day, at least the one we were replacing lasted more than a year</li>
      <li>I ordered me a new one, and I ordered two for my mom</li>
      <li>Very useful, but plastic top is very weak.</li>
      <li>First, when I opened the package, one of the sections (one section for each day of the month) was obviously defective - it was a defect during it&#x27;s manufacturing.</li>
      <li>FIRST TIME I got to #2, (2nd day of the month)</li>
      <li>I soon realized that the entire container was so cheaply made that it was only time before all the sections would end up with similar results even with normal wear and tare.</li>
      <li>Finally a well porportioned pill box that is easy to use with large enough spaces to accommodate the necessary pills and combined vitamins that I find necessary to maintain the schedule I must keep.</li>
      <li>I have purchase many pill organizers over the years and was looking for a simple organizer for my grandmother that is simple for her single pill she must take every day.  </li>
      <li>If you don&#x27;t need the days of the week marked this should work for you.</li>
      <li>I think this is a very reasonable time for such an inexpensive item to last.</li>
      <li>Maybe enough for 3 normal vitamins?</li>
      <li>Compartments are large enough to hold several pills.</li>
      <li>I take 5 different medicines and two of them really look similar in color and shape and size, By placing them in this container</li>

    <li> This organizer makes it easy and convenient to keep track of your pills so you don&#x27;t miss or take too many pills.</li>
    <li> Two compartment tabs broke on the first day, at least the one we were replacing lasted more than a year</li>
    <li> I like the idea of having a month&#x27;s worth of pills in an organizer, but this one has several problems.  I keep two fish oil capsules and two multi-vitamins in each slot, and the space is pretty tight.  Because the pills are wedged in there, I have to hold the container upside down and shake it, in order to get the pills out every day.  This becomes an issue because the covers don&#x27;t always snap into place very well.  If I am not careful, a bunch of pills can come falling down.  Another problem is that the covers are flimsy.  I have only been using this container for a few months, and one of the cover tabs has already snapped off.  A second one looks like it is about to fall off.  There have to be better products than this one.</li>
    <li> I have purchase many pill organizers over the years and was looking for a simple organizer for my grandmother that is simple for her single pill she must take every day.  She often would forget to take them and I wouldn&#x27;t be able to tell.  This looked like it fit the bill perfectly.  Boy was I wrong.  I wish I had read reviews before purchase.  The lids no matter what you do will not close tightly.  After the second time the box fell on the floor with pills going everywhere I put large rubber bands on the container hoping that would work.  Much to my surprise even that didn&#x27;t help as the lids popped up under the tight fitting rubber bands.  Returning this item cost more than the cost of the item so obviously I&#x27;m just out the $$ I spent on it.  I ended up ordering the \\&quot;31 day mini pill organizer\\&quot; (http://www.amazon.com/31-Day-Mini-Pill-Organizer/dp/B002XRGXTK/ref&#x3D;pd_sbs_hg_6), for just a couple of dollars more and it will work fabulously.  I wish I had seen it first.  Don&#x27;t waste your money...[[ASIN:B002XRGXTK 31 Day \\&quot;Mini\\&quot; Pill Organizer]]</li>
    <li> This is one dandy little item!  Great size.  Each section holds at least 10 small pills and each compartment snaps open and shut.  No spillage.  Just a nice idea all around...  Thanks. :)</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s exactly what my husband was looking for!  He loves it!</li>
    <li> I thought I had solved my numerous medication boxes issue. WRONG! First, when I opened the package, one of the sections (one section for each day of the month) was obviously defective - it was a defect during it&#x27;s manufacturing. I soon realized that the entire container was so cheaply made that it was only time before all the sections would end up with similar results even with normal wear and tare. Cheap plastic and nonexistent quality control equates to a big no-no if you are considering this item for your medication needs.</li>
    <li> This works best for me and my linear way of thinking.  It&#x27;s HUGE and not for traveling but I can see how or when I need to renew but most importantly I can tell if I missed a day.  The weekly organizer was ok but a full month works best for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also helps as a quick way of counting to verify count from pharmacy. The lids are not too tight nor are they too loose to operate.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t expect it to be so big but, I&#x27;m still glad I got it.</li>
    <li> It is a pretty decent product. I bought this for my grandmother since she has so many pills to take daily and I can fill it up for a whole month. The only complaint I have is that some of the lids have broken off. They fit back on and close, they just come off completely. Needless to say, it is still being used.</li>
    <li> When I first received this pill organizer, I too had problems with the lids closing.  But after using it for a while, I realized I didn&#x27;t have the lids (which are really just one piece!) lined up correctly.  Once I figured out how to line up the lid and click the individual lids closed, no problem.    It saves a HUGE amount of time -- fill it once a month and you&#x27;re finished.    It&#x27;s easy to travel with  -- it&#x27;s a fairly compact organizer.    I gave it 5 stars -- and I&#x27;m a tough grader.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this product! I loaded everything for 30 days. It is well made and sturdy. I am not sure if the product was changed after the earlier bad reviews, but I didn&#x27;t have any of the problems with the lids closing or being poorly made. I filled mine up, dropped on the floor and it did not open. I am purchasing one for my mom today. I highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> Like it but top comes off easily. The individual compartment tops also break easily but still worth the price as I had a difficult time finding an organizer for a month.</li>
    <li> Well constructed. Great for travel. Just a hint. Lid has to be put on bottom in same position to seal correctly.</li>
    <li> I have to agree with the guy which said he uses rubber bands to hold the lid on. The lid definitely doesn&#x27;t snap on tight. I have thrashed this one and purchased a different style. Will see how well it does.</li>
    <li> I bought this product in hopes of decreasing the amount of time it took to fill and refill a week-at-a-time pill box.  The lid does not fit tightly and has dumped a whole month of pills and vitamins out all over my floor.  I now have to use 3 rubber bands to keep it together so this doesn&#x27;t happen again.  Do not buy this product!</li>
    <li> I would not recommend the Ezy Dose Monthly Pill Organizer as one of the lids came off within a week.</li>
    <li> each pocket is a bit too small, other than that, i like the idea of a whole month supply. the shipping was super fast for regular shipping.</li>
    <li> This works well. Compartments are large enough to hold several pills. Construction seems pretty sturdy. If you don&#x27;t need the days of the week marked this should work for you.</li>
    <li> I had one of these already and i returned it once for the little compartment door broke off.&lt;br /&gt;it happend with the 2nd one too....i did not know that this was the same manufacturer otherwise i would not have ordered it..  (ordered it thru a catalog)</li>
    <li> Two of the doors broke off the first time I used it.</li>
    <li> compartmenmts too small for me</li>
    <li> In each box is kinda small for bigger pills to fit in. Struggling to get it out with my index finger.</li>
    <li> Love this product. I&#x27;ve had it before, it was so old the individual compartment lids would no longer close. I ordered me a new one, and I ordered two for my mom so she would have one for her AM meds and one for her PM meds.</li>
    <li> It was hard getting the pills in and then getting them out. I ended up buying a different pill organizer which I&#x27;m very happy with!</li>
    <li> The reason I like this pill dispenser is because it holds a full month of medications so I can organize all of them only once a month&#x3D;&#x3D;then I&#x27;m done for thirty days!  I use one for morning meds and the other one for evening meds.  I notice that some customers had trouble with the lids breaking and falling off, but I have used this for three months and have had no such problems.  I like these!</li>
    <li> The tabs break off fairly easily. Should be stronger.</li>
    <li> I bought 2 monthly pill organizers and one broke after about 6 weeks.  Unfortunately, the manufacturer did not offer an warranty. Because it was past thirty days, the company had no obligation to replace my broken one but replaced it for me with no hassles.  Literally no hassles and I got it the same week I called.  Because most companies customer service sucks, as a consumer, I want to know about the ones that go above and beyond and only shop from them.  This is a company I will go back to again and again.</li>
    <li> Great pill organizer for helping older people manage their medications. Would also be good for those who are younger and have to take a lot of medications.</li>
    <li> I like this. I have been trying to find something like this for months. It is easy for medication for a month at a time. I like it a lot.</li>
    <li> I ordered 2 of the Ezy Dose Monthly Pill Organizers for my Mom.  She is on several medications that need to be taken in the mornings and in the evenings. Every month I organize her medications so that all she has to do is open the corresponding number on the Ezy Dose that matches the date on the calendar.  It has made it alot easier for both of us.</li>
    <li> Perfect for my daily pills. Love that I only have to fill once a month and not weekly.</li>
    <li> I purchased one of these 4 1/2 years ago, and the lids are starting to fall off, so I am ordering a replacement.  I think this is a very reasonable time for such an inexpensive item to last. The daily containers are large and will hold quite a few pills. Something like this works much better than always trying to remember if you took your meds.  Also, you can tell well in advance when you need to refill prescriptions. It is true that if you are not always careful about getting the lids squared up and snapped closed correctly, they can spill.</li>
    <li> On initial washing of the item, the hinged platic doors broke.  After less than a month of use, two more hinged doors broke off.  Not sturdy at all. Not recommended.</li>
    <li> I bought 2 two of these recently to keep track of dispensing several vitamins I take. 1 was a primary and I put the second one aside just in case or for travel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Idea of these is perfect, great concept.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I filled the small flip lid slots with my vitamins and snapped the lids closed. Great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The FIRST TIME I got to #2, (2nd day of the month) and opened the lid it snapped right off at the hinge. I contacted Amazon and was refunded, good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just took out the second one of these and filled it, now THE VERY FIRST TIME I opened day #17 to fill it, the lid snapped off at the hinge.&lt;br /&gt;I will get a refund I know but the point here is THESE ARE MADE SO CHEAP AND POORLY that there is now way you will get more than a couple months out of it,&lt;br /&gt;LOOK FOR SOMETHING ELSE.</li>
    <li> Finally a well porportioned pill box that is easy to use with large enough spaces to accommodate the necessary pills and combined vitamins that I find necessary to maintain the schedule I must keep.</li>
    <li> great size for the price but the little tabs wear down very quickly and then won&#x27;t stay shut....which kind of defeats the purpose if you need this for travel.</li>
    <li> I first want to state that one of the lids was cracked when I received it but I did not have time to return it. The product still served its perpose and worked well. I bought this for a 3 week mission trip. In the unused sections I put OTC medicines so that I would not need to pack those bottlesas well.</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my Wife.  She likes being able to set up an entire month&#x27;s medication at one time.  Quality is good.</li>
    <li> This is the perfect size for what the supplements I take everyday so I only have to fill it once a month. I take the following (&amp; all fit with room to spare) - (1) baby aspirin, (1) claratin, (1) multi-vitamin, (1) green tea extract &amp; (1) fish oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All the tops closed firmly &amp; stay closed when opening 1 compartment &amp; turning the case over to get that set of pills out.</li>
    <li> several of the doors broke off. but it served it&#x27;s purpose</li>
    <li> i have tried all kinds of pill dispensers, but this one is the best its by the date of the month very easy to use. i have never seen it in stores just on Amazon...</li>
    <li> Bought this so that I didn&#x27;t have to reload my pills every week.  In that respect, this does the job and fits several pills in each compartment.  However, upon my first use, one of the lids broke off.  Not to long after, another lid popped off.</li>
    <li> Both of the dispensers we bought have lost some of the little door flaps. It&#x27;s not like we&#x27;re overly zealous about getting to our vitamins in the morning, so they really shouldn&#x27;t have fallen off.</li>
    <li> Very useful, but plastic top is very weak. Broken 2 days off with light usage. Sad, because otherwise excellent for pill management.</li>
    <li> I gave this product three stars based on the idea.  However, I would give it one star, at the most, for quality of construction.  I bought two of these about two years ago...one for my husband and one for me and I love the idea and convenience of them.  However, the quality is super shoddy.  My husband&#x27;s broke within a week...three of the covers came off.  I tried to hot glue them but that failed.  So, I switched his for mine.  That lasted a few weeks longer then the lids/covers started to break off.  We finally just taped them closed and untape the broken ones when we use them.  It&#x27;s sad that such a great idea comes in a poor method of construction.  I would pay a bit more if the materials would stand up to daily (sometimes twice daily) usage.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve ordered them before.  Great item.  Fast shipping.  This is great because you only fill them once a month.  This is brilliant.</li>
    <li> I received mine yesterday.  It was received broken.  I am not blaming the Amazon staff packaging - as it was probably cracked and broken prior to shipping and was not noticed.  I am not reordering this item.  It received 1 star to be able to rate.  I do not recommend this item.</li>
    <li> Not sturdy. The lids kept breaking off. Bought this for my husbands meds but the lids kept breaking off and I was afraid the grandchildren or the pets would get into the medicine if left out. Threw it away and bought another brand.</li>
    <li> Ezy Dose Monthly Pill Organizer and Reminder. Very convenient and easy to use. Will recommend to friends. Why do you require that I send feedback according to your procedure? It&#x27;s no longer voluntary.</li>
    <li> Each &amp;#34;hole&amp;#34; is very small. Maybe enough for 3 normal vitamins? Also I lost day the lid to day 17 after a week because it snapped off in my hands. This would be good if you took ONE or 2 small pills a day. Don&#x27;t think it would last a long time though.</li>
    <li> I like it because I can have my medicines set for a month at a time.  It is definitely worth it!</li>
    <li> This makes it really easy to remember your meds. I take three pills in the morning and they all fit and could probably fit more. I would highly recommend this. It also snaps open and closed and hasn&#x27;t broken or cracked.</li>
    <li> Does what it is supposed to do.  Light weight seemingly air tight(ish) seal.  Clearly labeled and easy to see the pills inside.  Simple, cheap, effective.</li>
    <li> Like others said, within a few weeks two of the lids broke off and I too had to dump the pill case upside down to get pills out.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s difficult to find these. I got one for a friend and two for me (one for AM one for PM). No more 7 day pill boxes, I can dole them out once a month and not think about it again for 30 days.</li>
    <li> Love the 30-day pill minder.  Once each month I load my dosages of prescription meds.  I take 5 different medicines and two of them really look similar in color and shape and size, By placing them in this container, I eliminate taking the same pill twice and the other pill not at all.  Overdosing can create major health issues.</li>
    <li> These pill cases are sturdy and made well easy for my mother to use and see would order again if needed</li>
