      <li>This is an excellent resourcehttp://www.bellavisageskinstudio.skincaretherapy.net/differences-between-salicylic-lactic-and-glycolic-peels</li>
      <li>excellent product.</li>
      <li>I chose the salicylic peel because it seemed to be the best option for someone looking to get rid of acne.</li>

      <li>This is awesome!</li>
      <li>Excellent!  </li>
      <li>I am impressed with them.  </li>
      <li>I am also impressed by the customer service of the manufacturer.</li>
      <li>I am very happy with this product for doing at-home chemical peels.</li>
      <li>This could have been a factor in the issue I was experiencing with it not providing great peeling.</li>
      <li>being said, I still think it&#x27;s a great product.</li>
      <li>Packaged great for shipping.</li>
      <li>What a great deal…</li>
      <li>This worked great.</li>
      <li>With one application it did reduce the size of my pimples in about a week, which I&#x27;m happy with.</li>
      <li>Loved the product and the service was good too!</li>
      <li>was more than impressed with the results.  </li>
      <li>Great product, excellent price and quick shipping....</li>
      <li>and I loved the result.</li>
      <li>loved the product.</li>
      <li>If you&#x27;re looking for a good peel, try the 20% instead.</li>
      <li>I applied it using the gauze that it came with (which I was really happy about, since I didn&#x27;t have a fan brush or my own gauze at the time it came in).</li>
      <li>This is a great peel, but VERY strong.  </li>
      <li>The Salicylic Acid from Skin Beauty Solutions is absolutely phenomenal, and this size is a great value as well.</li>
      <li>Very satisfied customer</li>
      <li>I guess it&#x27;s safe to say that I have hormonal acne!</li>
      <li>After recieving this product, I&#x27;ve used it twice and have had better results!</li>
      <li>I love seeing the results and not to mention, it has saved me lots of money!  </li>
      <li>I love it!</li>
      <li>then applied a neutralizer solution of baking soda and water (this stung more than the application itself!)</li>
      <li>Fast shipping, Great value, great product -performs</li>
      <li>I had been using the 20% solution for a couple of years and really liked it.</li>
      <li>My skin is starting to look really good, I&#x27;m very happy and wish I had started using chemical peels years ago.</li>
      <li>the shipping was fast and the packaging was very good.  </li>
      <li>We have ordered a 70% solution in hope that it is more effective.</li>
      <li>(skip this if you aren&#x27;t very experienced with acids in general and this one in particular.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I was about to try to go on Accutane again, but since my acne isn&#x27;t cystic like it was before I wasn&#x27;t sure I&#x27;d get the go ahead.</li>
      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>and I thought 30% will just be better</li>
      <li>Better then I anticipated</li>
      <li>and I have done MANY peels over the years.  </li>
      <li>This product came nicely and securely packaged.</li>
      <li>used to have to use a lot more makeup to cover the scars</li>
      <li>and I think most people looking at this product already know this.</li>
      <li>I love this stuff.</li>
      <li>I love the way it works</li>
      <li>Perfect this was the product I was looking for and this product was everything I expected it to be and more</li>
      <li>I tend to use it more frequently for just a minute or two with good results.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve had great results but couldn&#x27;t bare the price.</li>
      <li>My first order last year this peel is perfect for my project</li>
      <li>Great info came with it on application use and extra gauge.</li>
      <li>Wash face with soap free, non-creamy cleanser.</li>
      <li>it was wrapped securely and no spillage at all.  </li>
      <li>I will continue to use it as maintenance for my acne, because it definitely does some good - way more good than I have ever gotten out of a topical product, Rx or non-Rx.</li>
      <li>The size of my acne has been reduced significantly for just one application, but it&#x27;s still</li>
      <li>if you know you will use this faithfully, buy the bigger (100ml) bottle because this is such a great product you will want to reorder, might as well just have more on-hand!</li>
      <li>However, since I still do want to do a good peel, where my skin actually peels, I&#x27;ve decided to try a 20% TCA peel.</li>
      <li>Did it a second time and good lord it caused me to have hyperpigmentation.  </li>
      <li>Thank you to Skin Beauty Solutions and Amazon for offering such a great product and giving me a normal life again.</li>
      <li>Totally worth it.</li>
      <li>Make sure to use a really good moisturizer at night after washing and a moisturizer that contains an spf of at least 30 after morning washings.</li>
      <li>and we use this product in our office when administering chemical peels, so I bought my own for my personal use at home!</li>
      <li>But, this will last at most for three days, and then immediately that layer of skin will come off and your skin will look ten times better, i noticed a huge difference after about three to four peels.</li>
      <li>It came in 2 very large bottles for a peel.  </li>
      <li>It works very very well</li>
      <li>A peel with no additives would possibly fare better.</li>
      <li>pretty prominent.&lt;br</li>
      <li>But again, make sure you have no formal events or anything to do for the next two days after using the peel.</li>
      <li>it works--please use correctly--removes build up in pores--reduces allover size--repeat later for even more benefits</li>
      <li>instead of 5*)</li>
      <li>Product consistently delivers desired results for my clients and myself.</li>
      <li>I used it the first time</li>
      <li>Note, this was my first time ever doing a chemical peel.</li>
      <li>Many dermatologists had different opinions as did the sufferers of this acne attack.</li>
      <li>Due to budget constraint, I&#x27;ve resorted to doing my own peels.  </li>
      <li>Although I didn&#x27;t notice any results after the first application, after the second my skin really started to look so much better.</li>
      <li>I would highly recommend this product to anyone but if you burn easily or have extremely sensitive skin, you may want to try a reduced strength (10% or 20%) instead of this as it does take some getting used to.</li>
      <li>I hope to buy a genuine salicylic acid from a different produce.</li>
      <li>I should have started with a much lower percentage</li>
      <li>This product has really improved my skin.</li>
      <li>I like to use it after a gentle scrub with micro-dermabrasion crystals.</li>
      <li>and I didn&#x27;t get much frosting.  </li>
      <li>I use this to control very oily skin.  </li>
      <li>I have very resistant acne and have had all my life - rx creams and antibiotics never cleared anything up.</li>
      <li>Highly reccomend for Beauty Professionals!</li>
      <li>This product works very well.</li>
      <li>This product is great, it does what it is intended to do, remove dark spots and other discolorations.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll make this short and sweet.  </li>
      <li>I researched the internet to find that many people had either the same or a similar issue.  </li>
      <li>I went on Accutane about two years ago and that took care of things for the most part, but in recent months it has started to come back.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s only recommended to keep it on for about a minute when doing it for your very first time, but I kept it on about 5 minutes because the pain was dull.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Already bought several other peels and none were as effective as this.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m hoping a few more applications should get me to where I&#x27;d like to be with even skin.&lt;br</li>
      <li>If you are new to acids, I suggest going with the 1 oz bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>: I would use a fan brush instead of gauze to apply this - the gauze only allows a minimal amount of the product to be applied to your face, and the rest gets absorbed pretty fast.</li>
      <li>and now I&#x27;m feeling comfortable using less makeup and don&#x27;t feel so self conscious when my boyfriend sees me in the morning without makeup.  </li>
      <li>As far as this company.  </li>
      <li>Wow.</li>
      <li>It did help lighten old blemishes</li>

    <li> This is an excellent resourcehttp://www.bellavisageskinstudio.skincaretherapy.net/differences-between-salicylic-lactic-and-glycolic-peels</li>
    <li> Both my wife and tried this product following manufacturer&#x27;s directions. Literally, nothing happened even when left on for 20 minutes. Either very diluted or for us simply useless. We have ordered a 70% solution in hope that it is more effective.</li>
    <li> excellent product. Already bought several other peels and none were as effective as this. Looks like I&#x27;ve ever done in the dermatologists</li>
    <li> This product has really improved my skin. I&#x27;ve been using it once a week. Although I didn&#x27;t notice any results after the first application, after the second my skin really started to look so much better. I&#x27;ve had mild-moderate acne for almost 15 years and horrible hyper-pigmentation and red marks left behind. This has really helped fade my red marks, even ones I&#x27;ve had for years, and has dried up all my active acne. My skin is starting to look really good, I&#x27;m very happy and wish I had started using chemical peels years ago. It hasn&#x27;t done anything for my black heads yet. The only negative I could mention is that one of the bottles was not sealed properly so I lost several applications worth, so I&#x27;m glad I bought the larger order.</li>
    <li> I have only used this once and I loved the result. It did help lighten old blemishes and I do feel that it helped decongesting my pores.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll make this short and sweet.  About four years ago I started developing some type of acne around my waistband and it was ugly and embarrassing.  I&#x27;ve never had acne in my life, nor do I have oily skin.  I researched the internet to find that many people had either the same or a similar issue.  Many dermatologists had different opinions as did the sufferers of this acne attack. I decided to follow the advice of the doctors that recommended using Salicylic Acid to help dry out the outbreaks and eliminate all the scarring.  I bought the 30% solution from Skin Beauty Solutions through Amazon and quite frankly was more than impressed with the results.  Now I will have see a few red acne bumps starting to form and I immediately apply the skin peel.  Sometimes they disappear by the next day, but never take longer than two days to go away.  I no longer have painful acne breakouts or embarrassing scarring.  Thank you to Skin Beauty Solutions and Amazon for offering such a great product and giving me a normal life again.</li>
    <li> It does not even feel like 2% Salicylic acid. 20% burns my skin after 5 minutes and I thought 30% will just be better but this is worse.  I hope to buy a genuine salicylic acid from a different produce. So disappointing with this.</li>
    <li> I do like this product, however it didn&#x27;t seem to work for me the way it probably should have. I applied it using the gauze that it came with (which I was really happy about, since I didn&#x27;t have a fan brush or my own gauze at the time it came in). The stuff was a little hard to get out of the bottle - it has to be tilted at the right angle for it to come out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once i applied it on my face, the burn was very minimal. I was definitely expecting it to be a lot worse from what I have read. Note, this was my first time ever doing a chemical peel. It did burn but only like a sunburn. It wasn&#x27;t intolerable (to me anyway, I realize we are all different when it comes to pain thresholds). It&#x27;s only recommended to keep it on for about a minute when doing it for your very first time, but I kept it on about 5 minutes because the pain was dull.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I then applied a neutralizer solution of baking soda and water (this stung more than the application itself!) and rinsed. I expected peeling within the next few days, and got nothing. My skin didn&#x27;t even feel tight like it should have or anything like I have seen described. There were a couple of dry patches and that&#x27;s all. So, although I knew it was not recommended, I ended up doing another application two or three days later. I let it sit for approximately the same amount of time. It&#x27;s been about a week since the second application, and I only got a little flaking and nothing more. The size of my acne has been reduced significantly for just one application, but it&#x27;s still pretty prominent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That being said, I still think it&#x27;s a great product. I have very resistant acne and have had all my life - rx creams and antibiotics never cleared anything up. I went on Accutane about two years ago and that took care of things for the most part, but in recent months it has started to come back. I was about to try to go on Accutane again, but since my acne isn&#x27;t cystic like it was before I wasn&#x27;t sure I&#x27;d get the go ahead. Hence, I decided to go the chemical peel route. I chose the salicylic peel because it seemed to be the best option for someone looking to get rid of acne. With one application it did reduce the size of my pimples in about a week, which I&#x27;m happy with. It just doesn&#x27;t work for me in the sense that peels should work. I will continue to use it as maintenance for my acne, because it definitely does some good - way more good than I have ever gotten out of a topical product, Rx or non-Rx. However, since I still do want to do a good peel, where my skin actually peels, I&#x27;ve decided to try a 20% TCA peel. I just applied that tonight, and my skin already feels tight and it seems like it&#x27;s going in the right direction (I&#x27;ll post a review on that in about a week, this time with pictures).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: I would use a fan brush instead of gauze to apply this - the gauze only allows a minimal amount of the product to be applied to your face, and the rest gets absorbed pretty fast. This could have been a factor in the issue I was experiencing with it not providing great peeling. Then again, it could just be my skin. However, if you are going to spot treat or use it as maintenance like I will be doing, I&#x27;d suggest the gauze.&lt;br /&gt;Lastly, another factor could have been that this specific brand includes propylene glycol and alcohol in the product - something I didn&#x27;t realize in the beginning. A peel with no additives would possibly fare better.</li>
    <li> if you know you will use this faithfully, buy the bigger (100ml) bottle because this is such a great product you will want to reorder, might as well just have more on-hand! This really helps even out skin (even dark tones like my Caribbean American skin), especially dark spots. I love the way it works but i do always have to hide my shedding skin (hence the 4* instead of 5*)</li>
    <li> Loved the product and the service was good too! Thank you!</li>
    <li> Wow. Does the job but be very careful &amp; don&#x27;t leave on too long or you&#x27;ll be red faced for days or weeks.</li>
    <li> My first order last year this peel is perfect for my project&lt;br /&gt;I order again for a second time and seem it has diluted</li>
    <li> I wish I hadn&#x27;t wasted my money on this product...If you&#x27;re looking for a good peel, try the 20% instead.</li>
    <li> This worked great. A bit of peeling for a couple of days then I thought I looked quite &amp;#34; bright&amp;#34;!</li>
    <li> Fast shipping, Great value, great product -performs as described.</li>
    <li> I love it! This is awesome! It works very very well and I have been dealing with trying to find products that work on my stupid skin for ever. I&#x27;m 24 and I used to have tons of painful, huge zits on my chin, but this stuff cleared that up quick and painlessly! It even reduced my red spot scarring. I love it. Totally worth it.</li>
    <li> I am very happy with this product for doing at-home chemical peels. I like to use it after a gentle scrub with micro-dermabrasion crystals. I am also impressed by the customer service of the manufacturer.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been going to my dermatologist getting these peels at $50 a pop. I&#x27;ve had great results but couldn&#x27;t bare the price. After recieving this product, I&#x27;ve used it twice and have had better results! Product came when expected and I will definaty order when I run out!</li>
    <li> This is a great peel, but VERY strong.  I should have started with a much lower percentage and I have done MANY peels over the years.  I used it the first time and I didn&#x27;t get much frosting.  Did it a second time and good lord it caused me to have hyperpigmentation.  I was so scared that I ruined my face!  I am now using Retin A daily to undo the damage and using a yellow concealer to hide the dark spots on my face under makeup.  that is working thank goodness.  But yes proceed with caution.  I will try it again but not for a very long time and I will not leave it on my skin for very long either!  I think that is what the problem was I left it on a little longer than I should have which was still not more than just 3 minutes.  As far as this company.  I am impressed with them.  the shipping was fast and the packaging was very good.  it was wrapped securely and no spillage at all.  It came in 2 very large bottles for a peel.  I have usually gotten them from another company in very small bottles for about the same amount so this peel will literally last me for a very very very long time.  I advise that you not start at this strength even if you have done peels in the past unless you are having it applied by or are a professional.  Also expect to have a couple days off from work because you will look like your face was in a fire!</li>
    <li> It is what it is and that&#x27;s just what I wanted. 5*****s</li>
    <li> Excellent!  Would definitely buy again!</li>
    <li> I have ordered this type of item from Amazon in the past. This product came nicely and securely packaged. It came with an instructional brochure which was extremely helpful. This product works very well.</li>
    <li> I must have tough skin, I&#x27;ve used weaker strength peels without much results so I&#x27;ve decided to try the stronger stuff.  I use it once a week and after rising off I put vitamin E on my skin.  I&#x27;ve been using it for about a month now and can see a difference.  I&#x27;m 36 and have some dark marks from acne scaring.  This product has helped reduce the appearance of the dark marks.  They&#x27;re not completely gone, but you can definitely tell a difference.  I&#x27;m hoping a few more applications should get me to where I&#x27;d like to be with even skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used to have to use a lot more makeup to cover the scars and now I&#x27;m feeling comfortable using less makeup and don&#x27;t feel so self conscious when my boyfriend sees me in the morning without makeup.  Very happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> This product is great, it does what it is intended to do, remove dark spots and other discolorations. Its common sense that you need something strong like this 30% salicylic acid peel to physically remove the spots on your face or other parts of your body. The store-shelf junk like proactive dark spot remover does not work and I think most people looking at this product already know this. However, the next day after using the peel your skin will actually look worse because that layer of skin is coming off, so the dark spots will look darker, a lot darker and your skin will look wrinkly. But, this will last at most for three days, and then immediately that layer of skin will come off and your skin will look ten times better, i noticed a huge difference after about three to four peels. But again, make sure you have no formal events or anything to do for the next two days after using the peel.</li>
    <li> loved the product. Perfect this was the product I was looking for and this product was everything I expected it to be and more</li>
    <li> Highly reccomend for Beauty Professionals! Product consistently delivers desired results for my clients and myself. You will not be disappointed.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. Great info came with it on application use and extra gauge. Packaged great for shipping. i use this for sun damage I have and it&#x27;s made a big difference in my wrinkles.</li>
    <li> it works--please use correctly--removes build up in pores--reduces allover size--repeat later for even more benefits</li>
    <li> Great for acne!!! I  use it on my teenage son for his acne. I also use it to exfoliate my face.</li>
    <li> The Salicylic Acid from Skin Beauty Solutions is absolutely phenomenal, and this size is a great value as well. It comes as two 2 oz bottles, one of which will last you six months to a year depending on your frequency of application. They came with two packages of medical swabs for application. If you are new to acids, I suggest going with the 1 oz bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My method is as follows:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Wash face with soap free, non-creamy cleanser. Allow to dry.&lt;br /&gt;2. Wet cotton ball with water, squeeze out, apply rubbing alcohol to cotton ball. Apply liberally to face. Allow to dry.&lt;br /&gt;3. Use a cotton round/medical swabs provided to add salicylic acid until swab is wet but not dripping and use it to cover entire face, starting with problem areas, leaving a few milimeters around eyes, lips,and nostrils (you can apply on bridge of nose, but the crevice around nose flakes and becomes incredibly dry and uncomfortable.)&lt;br /&gt;4. Leave acid on skin for six minutes(Newbies should leave on skin for no more than three), then rewet swab with acid and reapply to whole of face and wait another six minutes (skip this if you aren&#x27;t very experienced with acids in general and this one in particular.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This keeps my previously acne-ridden skin relatively clear. I use this as well as the Glycolic 70% once a week(which I don&#x27;t suggest as highly, I&#x27;d go with a slightly lower percentage) and Benzyl Peroxide every morning and evening, excepting the day I do a peel.</li>
    <li> Better then I anticipated</li>
    <li> I use this to control very oily skin.  I tend to use it more frequently for just a minute or two with good results.</li>
    <li> Great product, excellent price and quick shipping....order arrived alot earlier than expected and that was without paying for expedited shipping. As a medical assistant in dermatology, I was looking for something to use at home that would take care of my occasional breakouts as well as the breaking out I&#x27;d experience just before my monthly visitor...I guess it&#x27;s safe to say that I have hormonal acne! This product will bring your imperfections to the surface, so get prepared because things will get a little worse before they get better. Make sure to use a really good moisturizer at night after washing and a moisturizer that contains an spf of at least 30 after morning washings. Peeling may occur, slight dryness may also occur which is why you have to be diligent in using moisturizers. I would highly recommend this product to anyone but if you burn easily or have extremely sensitive skin, you may want to try a reduced strength (10% or 20%) instead of this as it does take some getting used to. After a few uses, you will notice visible improvement in overall appearance of skin tone, will experience fewer breakouts, fading of dark spots, and a decrease in the size of your pores. Very satisfied customer and we use this product in our office when administering chemical peels, so I bought my own for my personal use at home!</li>
    <li> Im amazed by this product it has cleared my skin and prevents breakouts and has diminished my acne scars and dark spots i will buy this again</li>
    <li> I am a Black woman in my mid 30s who has always suffered from moderate to severe acne and oily skin. I&#x27;ve been mostly able to control my acne over the last few years. I use this to even out my skin tone. I had been using the 20% solution for a couple of years and really liked it. I figured that my skin had been using that long enough and could take a stronger solution. I use this once a week. I leave it on for about 10 minutes, rinse off, and then moisturize with shea butter. It brightens my skin, shrinks my pores and fades dark marks. Here&#x27;s a tip: If you have peeling - which I used to have on the second and third days after a peel - exfoliate every time you wash your face (I use an exfoliating brush from Sephora) and use an acne treatment that has an AHA or BHA in the evening. Vastly reduces the bothersome peeling.</li>
    <li> What a great deal……..the tiny bit I got front the docs office was a rip off</li>
    <li> Wrote previous review only thing helps to control acne.want to find product to take scars away now. For ex a peel to whiten the skin and marks</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been getting professional chemical peels for the last year. Due to budget constraint, I&#x27;ve resorted to doing my own peels.  I love seeing the results and not to mention, it has saved me lots of money!  My breakouts are kept at bay and my skin tone has evened out.  It also works well as a spot treatment.  I no longer have to \\&quot;paint\\&quot; my face; a sheer, but moisturizing foundation is all I need now.</li>
