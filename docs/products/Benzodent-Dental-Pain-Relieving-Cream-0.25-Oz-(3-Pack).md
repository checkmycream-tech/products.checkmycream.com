    <li> I am very satisfied with the product and have recommend it to several of my friends and family members who have dentures.  I give Benzodent a five star. I also plan to order more.</li>
    <li> This is the only toothache medicine that has ever worked for my husband &amp; I.  I recommend this product for any adult that has tooth pain.  I also used this for my grandchild when teething.  It only takes a small amount, and it numbs whatever it touches, in your mouth.</li>
    <li> Does the job.  Great product.</li>
    <li> The best. But has to be warmed up to get it out of the tube easier.</li>
    <li> Everything went well and I was very pleased with my  experience with Amazon</li>
    <li> It works really well for sore places on the gums!</li>
    <li> Use all time is great.</li>
    <li> Was very happy with the product, but it washes away with a sip of beverage.  If I use it before bed, it makes a spot on the pillowcase.  Luckily it washes out.</li>
    <li> Always use this difficult to find except online. Price was to good to be true have used this for over 35 years.</li>
    <li> Benzodent is the only product that works for deture pain,too bad we can&#x27;t buy in store anymore.Glad  I can buy it at Amazon &amp; at a great price.</li>

    <li> Amazing product. Couldn&#x27;t have made through tbe first few weeks of new dentures without it. Will keep my self stocked up on this from now on.</li>
    <li> I have used this on my dentures for years but when I went to buy it this time I couldn&#x27;t find it anywhere.  I made sure I bought plenty this time.  I don&#x27;t need it very often, but it&#x27;s nice to have around when you get a sore spot under your denture.  Also, this was a good price.</li>
    <li> Wonderful and very useful med for persons with temporary denture pain.</li>

    <li> Have used this product for over 25 years and haven&#x27;t been able to find for over 2 years it in any of the stores the mfg stated in their lists,  so very glad to fint it thru AMAZON!</li>
    <li> Great product, I got it so fast</li>
    <li> Hard to find where I live. But a wonderful deal and a Must have for anyone with new dentures and are still adjusting to them.</li>
    <li> I clench my teeth and all my teeth hurt all of the time.  Mouth guards do not help.  The only thing that helps me deal with the pain is this.  It does last long, and provides the best relief I have found so far.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t find anything better than this product but I&#x27;m also finding it difficult to find it in stores anymore. Probably not a big seller in this part of Florida because a lot of people are running around with no teeth :-)  This was a great deal. Thank you.</li>
    <li> Best pain reliever on the market.</li>
    <li> I love it! I&#x27;ve tried Oragel and others but did not get the relief like I did with Benzodent. It was recommended by my dentist but I could not find it in any store so I went to Amazon.</li>
    <li> I was so happy to get this. It was a great buy and I could not find it in the drug stores.&lt;br /&gt;I use it a lot.</li>
    <li> When I first received my dentures I was given Benzodent in case of any sores on my gums. I still use it, if I get cancer sores in my mouth where my dentures sit. It takes care of it right away, usually day one, sometimes two or three days depends how sever the sore. I would recommend  it to anyone that wears dentures.</li>
    <li> Relieves sore spots from my dentures, which have become very problematic.  No bone left makes for difficulty wearing them.  Not a candidate for mini implants so I am stuck and sad.</li>
    <li> This is the best dental pain relief that I have found.</li>
    <li> Since this product has become nonexistent in our part of KY,  I was happy to find online. My dad wants use only your brand. Delivery was prompt.</li>
    <li> This product works best for me, I have tried most of the other brands and was not happy with the way they performed, too runny or too numbing.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. I wish that the stores sold it still. If I was not able to have this in my kit I would be in serious trouble! Will be buying again soon.</li>
    <li> my husband uses this all the time,he will not use any other brand</li>
    <li> Great product, have been using it for at least 15 years.</li>
    <li> Super Price, works for me.</li>
    <li> It was what I expected and needed.  I would recommend to anyone needing it..  It works very well for denture pain.</li>
    <li> THIS HAS WORKED FOR YEARS. WHY THEY TAKE THINGS OFF THE MARKET  THAT WORKS IS STUPID. HERE IS ANOTHER.  IF YOU EVER GET THIS ITEM PLEASE LET ME KNOW.  ICHTHAMMOL 10% OINTMENT,USP.  THANK YOU.</li>
    <li> Is an instant healing agent for any gum irritations, could not live without it!  Have been using this product for&lt;br /&gt;over 30 years.  I have to order it on Amazon (thank God) because they do not sell it in any of the drug stores.</li>
    <li> This product is the very best thing anyone can use if they have partials or false teeth.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t flow out of the tube like it&#x27;s big brother - the 1.0 oz. size.</li>
    <li> It did the job to kill the pain</li>
    <li> My wife needed it for her denture pain and it works fine</li>
    <li> As always Amazon did a great job. Moved to Charleston front Massachusetts, where you could find the benzodent easily. Seems no one  (cvs, Walmart etc) in the Charleston SC area sold it, so it was wonderful to find it on amazon.</li>
    <li> Used this product for many years.  Others of this type product didn&#x27;t do</li>
    <li> Best dental pain relieving product..</li>
    <li> I was so happy that Amazon had the Benzodent . I used to purchase Benzodent at our local Walmart, but typical of Walmart that they always discontinuing something that you get used to buying. I just got new dentures and until I adjusted to them I had a couple of sore spots and this helped with the soreness until I adjusted. It really helps you through the adjustment stage. Thanks</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this for quite a while. once in a while dentures tend to make my gums sore especially after eating nuts and other hard foods. this really helps me.</li>
    <li> has worked better for sore gums due to denture irritation than any other product I have tried</li>
    <li> This is a great product if you need something to help adjust to false teeth.  I am sure would work for any problem on the gums</li>
    <li> Great stuff does the job</li>
    <li> Benzodent is the best cream for sore spots. It soothes the area and relieves the pain.  Great product!!</li>
    <li> It will relieve the pain .</li>
    <li> I never use anything else, great for anything in the mouth!!!!</li>
    <li> Great product fast service</li>
    <li> So glad I got this product, it was a god sent when your hurting.</li>
    <li> I use this occasionally when i get a sore spot in my mouth from my partial denture. Just a small dab and the pain is gone.</li>
    <li> Everything was great.</li>
