      <li>I love Burt&#x27;s Bees Lip Crayons, so this PRODUCT gets an excellent rating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>it is quite bright.</li>
      <li>Love it!</li>
      <li>you want to feel more chic or glamorous!</li>
      <li>I love how redwoods fits me as &amp;#34;me shade&amp;#34;!</li>
      <li>It also doesn&#x27;t have amazing staying power</li>
      <li>but better&amp;#34; kind of shades.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s opaque and matte, yet feels a bit more like wearing chapstick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t like lipstick because of its waxy oily taste, but this lip crayon tastes like nothing to me and the red is perfect.</li>
      <li>Love love love this lip crayon.</li>
      <li>Wasn&#x27;t expecting to like this so much, but it&#x27;s great.</li>
      <li>They are more &amp;#34;your lips</li>
      <li>I love it and would repurchase.</li>
      <li>I was hoping this would be more moisturizing.  </li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s not as drying as most lipstick for me.  </li>
      <li>I love the matte but will apply gloss gloss when I want a shimmer.  </li>
      <li>I love the color ...</li>
      <li>They glide on more smoothly and are easier to apply.</li>
      <li>The texture isn&#x27;t what you&#x27;d think- i.e a light and smooth balm.</li>
      <li>is my new favorite product!</li>
      <li>One swipe creates a beautiful shade of red, very flattering on my medium skin.</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s not bad either.  </li>
      <li>Very, very pretty color</li>
      <li>and I think i&#x27;ve hit the jackpot with Burt like I did when I first used their products 20 years ago!</li>
      <li>I want to replace all of my old toxic makeup with better products.</li>
      <li>The crayon in Niagara Overlook is creamy, has good staying power and is a pretty shade of pink.</li>
      <li>A little bright for me. .</li>
      <li>and I do love a pretty lipstick, but regular brands make my lips even drier.</li>
      <li>I do first apply chapstick .</li>
      <li>I only use one swipe as more than that</li>
      <li>the Napa Vineyard color looks more fuschia than red on me.</li>
      <li>/&gt;However, I was greatly displeased that when it ARRIVED, the &amp;#34;crayon&amp;#34; portion itself FELL OUT of the casing and even after putting it back in, is SO &amp;#34;wobbly&amp;#34; I can&#x27;t apply it from an angle like I can the other *3</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s basically a lipstick, a very matte one.</li>
      <li>I bought the Redwoods color, though originally I had it in mind to buy the Napa Vineyard color, but I think it was going to be a bit too red for me in comparison.</li>
      <li>I was really surprised when I tried Burt&#x27;s crayon for the first time.  </li>
      <li>A lot of all-natural lipsticks are sold at a higher price, but I was pleasantly surprised to find these new lip crayons!</li>
      <li>I also love the texture and matte first wish and it definitely lasted a long time!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been trying to find a new color, but might end up having to switch brands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>After several hours it began to feel dry, so I used a lip balm over top of it and it was completely revived.</li>
      <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ll use this new lip color, but will need to tone it down by applying it along with a lightly colored lip balm, then wiping off some.</li>
      <li>Have light Olive toned skin, dark hair, and green/hazel eyes.</li>
      <li>I love this crayon - easy to apply, doesn&#x27;t dry out my lips, and it&#x27;s a company with a mission I can get behind.  </li>
      <li>I have always had that problem with reds though, and need more of a coral color - which is hard to find now with the Burt&#x27;s Bees line (like with lip shimmers how they got rid of Nutmeg and Papaya).  </li>
      <li>I literally can only use it by pressing the tip of the Lip Crayon directly to my lips to prevent it from wobbling AS much or falling out again.</li>
      <li>It actually might be too light pink for my olive skin, but sometimes I wear it anyway</li>
      <li>It is soft, don&#x27;t dry the lips and the color is intense and mate.</li>
      <li>Reminds me a lot of Mac&#x27;s Russian Red, actually, with the rich red color.</li>
      <li>It is dry, and the color is very saturated and redder than I would like, so</li>
      <li>This will last a while, and I.love that it&#x27;s natural too!</li>
      <li>I also have this in Carolina Coast, which is more sheer but buildable for a pale pink.</li>
      <li>And since I&#x27;ll only buy non-toxic products, it was a major find for me.</li>

<li> The crayon in Napa Vineyard is not the same texture; it&#x27;s drier and does not last as long.</li>
<li> so I usually have to put a quick layer of balm over it which is a bit of a let down</li>
<li> Brighter shade than expected, but it stays on for a few hours straight.</li>
<li> Lately I have been just putting a little on for some color, but you can easily go for a dark red</li>
<li> It wears off unevenly on me and I have to reapply it frequently.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve always had dry lips</li>
<li> My complexion is dark brown and my under tones are red</li>
<li> Unfortunately, even though the color is very pretty, I wouldn&#x27;t buy the Napa Vineyard shade again because I don&#x27;t like the dry texture.</li>
<li> but sometimes I end up getting something I feel is not ethical</li>
<li> It&#x27;s not very moisturizing</li>
<li> I will purchasing the other colors.</li>
<li> I tone it down with an other brand of organic lipstick.  </li>
<li> It has a subtle shine to it and it did not dry out my lips.</li>
<li> I like the product but the color is too dark on me</li>
<li> Aside from the fact that the color I chose was too dark,  Burt&#x27;s lipstick was sooo waxy.  </li>
<li> makes the shade too dark.</li>
<li> I use a little for blush, too.</li>
<li> It was a little gift for my daughter</li>
<li> and it usually stays on my lips longer than expected.&lt;br</li>
<li> I usually have to reapply chapstick throughout the day because of dryness however, I do not have to when using the crayon.  </li>
<li> so I was pretty disappointed.  </li>
<li> ; that works for me without being too flashy, whiney, cakey, or drying, and I&#x27;ve finally found it!</li>
<li> But they aren&#x27;t 100% natural. :-(</li>
<li> but they are a bit expensive</li>
<li> It can be a bit drying, like any matte, but it&#x27;s not too bad.</li>
<li> when it comes to my lips, I know, sounds stupid</li>

    <li> Wasn&#x27;t expecting to like this so much, but it&#x27;s great. The texture isn&#x27;t what you&#x27;d think- i.e a light and smooth balm. It&#x27;s basically a lipstick, a very matte one.

    <li> I was hoping this would be more moisturizing.  It is dry, and the color is very saturated and redder than I would like, so I&#x27;ll be blending it with gloss or something with a smoother texture.  I prefer the Neutrogena and Revlon lip pencils.  They glide on more smoothly and are easier to apply. But they aren&#x27;t 100% natural. :-(</li>
    <li> Have light Olive toned skin, dark hair, and green/hazel eyes. I have been searching forever for the &amp;#34;prefect vintage every day red&amp;#34; that works for me without being too flashy, whiney, cakey, or drying, and I&#x27;ve finally found it! I bought the Redwoods color, though originally I had it in mind to buy the Napa Vineyard color, but I think it was going to be a bit too red for me in comparison. I love how redwoods fits me as &amp;#34;me shade&amp;#34;! I also love the texture and matte first wish and it definitely lasted a long time! After several hours it began to feel dry, so I used a lip balm over top of it and it was completely revived. This will last a while, and I.love that it&#x27;s natural too! Finally, I&#x27;ve been waiting for burt&#x27;s bees to come out with  &amp;#34;real&amp;#34; lipstick, and this is my new favorite product!</li>
    <li> Love it! It is soft, don&#x27;t dry the lips and the color is intense and mate.</li>
    <li> I was really surprised when I tried Burt&#x27;s crayon for the first time.  Aside from the fact that the color I chose was too dark,  Burt&#x27;s lipstick was sooo waxy.  It was a little gift for my daughter so I was pretty disappointed.  I will have to keep looking.</li>
    <li> the Napa Vineyard color looks more fuschia than red on me. it is quite bright. I have always had that problem with reds though, and need more of a coral color - which is hard to find now with the Burt&#x27;s Bees line (like with lip shimmers how they got rid of Nutmeg and Papaya).  I&#x27;ve been trying to find a new color, but might end up having to switch brands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll use this new lip color, but will need to tone it down by applying it along with a lightly colored lip balm, then wiping off some.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t buy this product here but at Sprouts. I came here to buy more and leave a review because they&#x27;re great! The color stays on and its the best crayon type lip color i&#x27;ve purchased, and i&#x27;ve bought a lot of them! Being a vegan, it matters what I use on my face but sometimes I end up getting something I feel is not ethical when it comes to my lips, I know, sounds stupid but anyway, I decided to pick this lip color up and I think i&#x27;ve hit the jackpot with Burt like I did when I first used their products 20 years ago!</li>
    <li> A little bright for me. . . I tone it down with an other brand of organic lipstick.  I use a little for blush, too.</li>
    <li> Great lip color! Only had to reapply once (and it was after having a beverage.)</li>
    <li> I love Burt&#x27;s Bees Lip Crayons, so this PRODUCT gets an excellent rating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I was greatly displeased that when it ARRIVED, the &amp;#34;crayon&amp;#34; portion itself FELL OUT of the casing and even after putting it back in, is SO &amp;#34;wobbly&amp;#34; I can&#x27;t apply it from an angle like I can the other *3* Lip Crayons by Burt&#x27;s Bees (which I&#x27;ve NEVER had this issue with).  I literally can only use it by pressing the tip of the Lip Crayon directly to my lips to prevent it from wobbling AS much or falling out again.</li>
    <li> Brighter shade than expected, but it stays on for a few hours straight.</li>
    <li> I love the color ... I use it along with Burt&#x27;s bees lip balm.</li>
    <li> Love love love this lip crayon. I don&#x27;t like lipstick because of its waxy oily taste, but this lip crayon tastes like nothing to me and the red is perfect. Literally about 6 of my friends went out and bought it after they saw it on me! And since I&#x27;ll only buy non-toxic products, it was a major find for me.</li>
    <li> I like the product but the color is too dark on me so I don&#x27;t wear it.</li>
    <li> I want to replace all of my old toxic makeup with better products. A lot of all-natural lipsticks are sold at a higher price, but I was pleasantly surprised to find these new lip crayons! I&#x27;ve always had dry lips and I do love a pretty lipstick, but regular brands make my lips even drier. Thankfully I don&#x27;t have that problem with Burts Bees. It&#x27;s opaque and matte, yet feels a bit more like wearing chapstick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My best friend also bought this shade Napa Vineyard and now she can&#x27;t stop wearing it. Every woman should have this in their makeup bag. Lately I have been just putting a little on for some color, but you can easily go for a dark red that&#x27;s perfect for fall/winter - or anytime you want to feel more chic or glamorous! I also have this in Carolina Coast, which is more sheer but buildable for a pale pink. It actually might be too light pink for my olive skin, but sometimes I wear it anyway and it usually stays on my lips longer than expected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: I have bought both Hawaiian Smolder and Niagara Overlook (couldn&#x27;t decide which one to get!), but they&#x27;re not as opaque as Napa Vineyard. They are more &amp;#34;your lips but better&amp;#34; kind of shades.</li>
    <li> Very, very pretty color and it looks soo nice on!  It&#x27;s not very moisturizing so I usually have to put a quick layer of balm over it which is a bit of a let down but it&#x27;s not as drying as most lipstick for me.  It also doesn&#x27;t have amazing staying power but it&#x27;s not bad either.  Basically middle range staying power, in my opinion.</li>
    <li> I love this crayon - easy to apply, doesn&#x27;t dry out my lips, and it&#x27;s a company with a mission I can get behind.  It doesn&#x27;t stay put though - so be prepared for anything you touch with your lips to also end up wearing this (napkins, fellas, clothing, etc.).</li>
    <li> I usually have to reapply chapstick throughout the day because of dryness however, I do not have to when using the crayon.  I do first apply chapstick . I love the matte but will apply gloss gloss when I want a shimmer.  My complexion is dark brown and my under tones are red so the color, especially when accompanied with their starry night lip gloss, complements my ebony complexion.</li>
    <li> I tend to buy Buxom lip sticks but they are a bit expensive so I thought I would try one of these. I bought these lip crayons in Niagara Overlook and Napa Vineyard. The crayon in Niagara Overlook is creamy, has good staying power and is a pretty shade of pink. I would probably buy it again. The crayon in Napa Vineyard is not the same texture; it&#x27;s drier and does not last as long. It wears off unevenly on me and I have to reapply it frequently. I only use one swipe as more than that makes the shade too dark. One swipe creates a beautiful shade of red, very flattering on my medium skin. Unfortunately, even though the color is very pretty, I wouldn&#x27;t buy the Napa Vineyard shade again because I don&#x27;t like the dry texture.</li>
    <li> I was shocked and delighted that Burt&#x27;s Bees made lipsticks. This color is absolutely gorgeous! It has a subtle shine to it and it did not dry out my lips. I will purchasing the other colors. Beautiful product!</li>
