### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>This was excellent.  </li>
      <li>Your hair will look beautiful every day!  </li>
      <li>I have used hair care products for 48 years now and, this is the best.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s one of the best purchases I made.  </li>
      <li>Well I am very impressed with this.  </li>
      <li>But I am very happy with my purchase.</li>
      <li>He says he is about \\&quot;perfect hair\\&quot;.  </li>
      <li>I say that because whether I straighten my hair or leave it curly, this shampoo makes it feel and look and smell great.  </li>
      <li>and it does literally feel like straw, then I&#x27;ll happily return to having \\&quot;dirty\\&quot; hair...</li>
      <li>My scalp never felt this good.</li>
      <li>I loved this product.  </li>
      <li>and I used J.P shampoo and it work like magic!</li>
      <li>I also have tried so many different shampoos and this is one of the best, if not the best, I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
      <li>You need to get used to that feeling, but once you do, your hair will look and feel better every day!</li>
      <li>look amazing .</li>
      <li>Absolutely every product he makes is a the best I have ever used.</li>
      <li>I used a sample and liked the fact that it cleaned my hair the way I want my hair cleaned.</li>
      <li>I love it because it smells so good</li>
      <li>When I rinsed out, it was shiny, clean and smelled good.   </li>
      <li>You can safely shampoo your hair EVERY DAY with no build up.</li>
      <li>Okay, so I bought in to the hype of \\&quot;Blow Out\\&quot;.  </li>
      <li>The more dirt and oil you have on your hair,</li>
      <li>it became very sudsy and washed great.   </li>
      <li>I love the feel and the fragrance of the shampoo and conditioner, I would like it more if the scent lasted longer.</li>
      <li>You can get better products at the drug store.</li>
      <li>Even though Head and shoulders uses MEA I find that that even that works better than this.</li>
      <li>It feels so nice and clean.  </li>
      <li>Most girls buy shampoos etc based on packaging and smell and let me tell you, not only does it look and smell great, but what it does for your hair is amazing</li>
      <li>Get a big tooth comb and some guts and go through life with really clean hair!!!!</li>
      <li>Most people are used to the detergent and chemical rich shampoos that create lots of lather and leave your hair feeling slippery.</li>
      <li>bottom line is: Despite the 20 bucks that it costs, I think that having healthy hair and a healthy scalp is worth every penny.   </li>
      <li>Plus it is sulfate free.</li>
      <li>What&#x27;s important is that you take the time to massage it into your hair and scalp.</li>
      <li>so worth it !</li>
      <li>I originally bought it for my daughter, but, I used it</li>
      <li>Once your hair is dry, it feels great and</li>
      <li>The shampoo and conditioner neither clean nor moisturize hair.</li>
      <li>SQUEAKY CLEAN.</li>
      <li>But despite the fact that it \\&quot;feels\\&quot; annoying...that&#x27;s how clean hair is supposed to feel...</li>
      <li>br /&gt;Jonathan is not the only good product out there.</li>
      <li>And for the price, you sure don&#x27;t get much.</li>
      <li>I watched Blow Out adn ordered much of the Jonathan Product the moment it was available.</li>
      <li>Before she used cheap shampoo (just like me) and she had so much frizz now that she washes with Jonathan Product and her hair</li>
      <li>However, those are exactly the things that aren&#x27;t good for hair over the long run.  </li>
      <li>I have bought shampoo and conditioners that cost 1/3 and 1/4 of the price that perform far better than Jonathan&#x27;s.</li>
      <li>this product another try, it is well worth it..</li>
      <li>and yes, the hair does feel like straw right after you wash it.</li>
      <li>thats all that matters right?</li>
      <li>Let me tell you right now that this product is junk.  </li>
      <li>In the long run it is damaging for the hair and after some hours it really does not have that nice clean bounce that hair is supposed to have.</li>
      <li>Very picky about shampoo and this a really good for dry color treated hair.  </li>
      <li>I received a sample of this shampoo and I am ever so glad I got to try it free before I actually spent money on it.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Although it doesn&#x27;t lather up that much, it doesn&#x27;t take much lather to clean your hair.</li>
      <li>That actually caused some hair loss on the top of my head.  </li>
      <li>My hair doesn&#x27;t feel like it has any more of its essential oils</li>
      <li>I won&#x27;t hesitate to buy more of Jonathan&#x27;s products next time I go.  </li>
      <li>What exactly is it supposed to do??  </li>
      <li>I love this and can&#x27;t say enough about it.</li>
      <li>I thought this may be a good oil substitue for lubricating my gears, but as Whatevia said, it just dried everything up.</li>
      <li>If you have a handful of suds, you have either used too much product, or your hair was not very dirty to begin with.</li>
      <li>I have great hair , but my mom&#x27;s hair is extremly frizzez , thin and just horibble .</li>
      <li>Watching the show I thought that Jonathan really cared about hair and its no doubt that he does still</li>
      <li>RUN AS FAST AS YOU CAN...</li>
      <li>I have oily hair and fine hair but color treated and can get dry.  </li>
      <li>Maybe if he didn&#x27;t spend all his time mugging for the cameras he would have a decent product.</li>
      <li>but it DOES use three different types of PEG, a petroleum based thicker found in most bath products that can erode wooden tables in just minutes.</li>
      <li>I understand the idea behind sulfite-free, but no suds&#x3D;no good.  </li>
      <li>With most other shampoo and conditioners, they are filled with sythetic ingredients, to include silicone, which give hair that slick slippery feel.</li>
      <li>That is why the other reviewer noticed more suds on the second pass.</li>
      <li>I had hopes that the conditioner would make it soft again</li>
      <li>I see several previous reviews that acknowledge the fact that this shampoo leaves your hair feeling like \\&quot;straw\\&quot; yet say that is because this shampoo leaves your hair so clean!  </li>
      <li>Jonathan should have sent it back to the factory to get it fixed again because it is highly suspect.   </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not worth your 20 dollars, its barely worth 5 dollars.</li>
      <li>This is just as harmful as MEA, especially for people with sensitive scalps and hair.</li>
      <li>I ended up throwing it in the trash and went back to my old shampoo.</li>
      <li>/&gt; Not washed with useless lather and coated with all kind of smoothening silicon products.</li>
      <li>I have rather dry hair, and I merely tried this product on a lark, just to see if it was any good because I am a fan of Jonathan and his show, so I will return to my drugstore shampoo, Dove and Pantene which have always worked well for my dry hair.</li>

<li> For example, even in the hot, very humid atmosphere of Houston, TX it left my hair feeling dry and unhealthy, even after using his conditioner (alot of it).</li>
<li> that&#x27;s long enough to make them potential Guiness World Record candidates.</li>
<li> This shampoo made my hair flat and dry when I used it every day.</li>
<li> the products that are supposed to cleanse are much less apparent in the product than the PEG products.</li>
<li> With the Jonathan products, I have found the ultimate hair products and have thrown all my other hair products away.</li>
<li> and I&#x27;ve switched back to the other hair products Iv&#x27;e</li>
<li> I could not even run a comb through my hair while it was wet because this product left my hair feeling so rough!</li>
<li> and you only have to use a very little bit (meaning it lasts a long time) .</li>
<li> Not only did my hair feel like straw, as mentioned by other reviewers, but it was so heavy</li>
<li> And the price is way too high for them to work so poorly.</li>
<li> was not impressed the first time I used it, why?  </li>
<li> When using other products, you need to use a \\&quot;clarifying shampoo\\&quot; every week to get rid of the build-up</li>
<li> I couldn&#x27;t comb it out with a wide tooth comb until I applied a leave in conditioner from another product line!  </li>
<li> I was so let down.</li>
<li> The shampoo &amp; conditioner are below average - I could acre less that they&#x27;re 100% vegan.</li>
<li> my hair was noticably flat and dull.</li>
<li> the less \\&quot;sudsy\\&quot; it will be.</li>
<li> As much as I love Jonathon, Im sorry to say that this is really thick, hard to apply, hard to rinse and my hair felt like straw after.</li>
<li> This is what causes limp looking hair.  </li>
<li> the Jonathan product, you don&#x27;t get that slick slippery feel that you would get from other products, and that&#x27;s because it does not build up on your hair!</li>
<li> Create Curl stinks, too - it left me with a mess of frizz and no curls were created.</li>
<li> I used lots of the companion conditioner hoping for a balancing act, but was left aghast when I rinsed and felt the \\&quot;new\\&quot; texture of my hair.  </li>
<li> It&#x27;s so thick and clumpy.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This makes your hair smoother and easier to comb. My scalp never felt this good. Plus it is sulfate free.</li>
    <li> As much as I love Jonathon, Im sorry to say that this is really thick, hard to apply, hard to rinse and my hair felt like straw after. I had hopes that the conditioner would make it soft again but it was horrible as well! I tried to give it to my sister and she had the same opinion. I do like the refresh spray, and my husband likes the dirt. So, I guess the whole line is not a total waste. I will not buy any of the products again.</li>
    <li> Is this shampoo or sap??  What exactly is it supposed to do??  I received a sample of this shampoo and I am ever so glad I got to try it free before I actually spent money on it.  Not only did my hair feel like straw, as mentioned by other reviewers, but it was so heavy I couldn&#x27;t do anything except rewash it with my regular shampoo.  I&#x27;ll save this one for Halloween.</li>
    <li> I used a sample and liked the fact that it cleaned my hair the way I want my hair cleaned. &lt;br /&gt; Not washed with useless lather and coated with all kind of smoothening silicon products. People have beconme so used to the mass produced garbage that is sold in gorcery stores, that they do not realize they are paying for detergent. In the long run it is damaging for the hair and after some hours it really does not have that nice clean bounce that hair is supposed to have. &lt;br /&gt;Jonathan is not the only good product out there. I have been using Phyto Shampoo from France and Kiehl&#x27;s, both don&#x27;t have the silicon smoothers either and yes, the hair does feel like straw right after you wash it. Get a big tooth comb and some guts and go through life with really clean hair!!!! &lt;br /&gt;I used my sample and will buy a big bottle of the Shampoo. I have not tried the conditioner, but will try it too. &lt;br /&gt;</li>
    <li> I thought this may be a good oil substitue for lubricating my gears, but as Whatevia said, it just dried everything up. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;If I could find this Jonathan guy I would Hit Em Up Style</li>
    <li> RUN AS FAST AS YOU CAN... DO NOT TRY!  Okay, so I bought in to the hype of \\&quot;Blow Out\\&quot;.  Once I saw the \\&quot;JONATHAN\\&quot; product line on the shelf, I thought, \\&quot;Hmmm, how yummy!\\&quot;  Boy, was I disappointed.  The moisturizing shampoo was anything but!  The product felt like a mixture of tree sap and glue.  Once applied to the hair, I felt knots forming.  Upon rinsing, my hair like it had been stripped!  I used lots of the companion conditioner hoping for a balancing act, but was left aghast when I rinsed and felt the \\&quot;new\\&quot; texture of my hair.  I couldn&#x27;t comb it out with a wide tooth comb until I applied a leave in conditioner from another product line!  Once dry, my hair felt gritty, brittle and generally nasty.  I&#x27;M TAKING THIS STUFF BACK AND DEMANDING A REFUND!  I&#x27;m going back to my Frederick Fekkai products immediately!</li>
    <li> If you buy this shampoo, buy something else with it to get this glue out of your hair. I guarantee you will be disappointed, it is the equivalent of Herbal Essence. (also leaves your hair like glue)</li>
    <li> Read the review from C. Bouvier \\&quot;Beauty Junkie\\&quot; below, she knows what she is talking about. If you have a handful of suds, you have either used too much product, or your hair was not very dirty to begin with. That is why the other reviewer noticed more suds on the second pass. The shampoo is supposed to \\&quot;grab\\&quot; hold of the dirt and remove it from your hair. The more dirt and oil you have on your hair, the less \\&quot;sudsy\\&quot; it will be. With conditioner you should start at the ends of your hair and work the product up towards the scalp, and after you rinse, you should not feel any trace of conditioner on your hair. This is what causes limp looking hair.  I love the feel and the fragrance of the shampoo and conditioner, I would like it more if the scent lasted longer. But I am very happy with my purchase. I hope this helps. Give the product a chance to work and improve your hair.</li>
    <li> I have great hair , but my mom&#x27;s hair is extremly frizzez , thin and just horibble . Before she used cheap shampoo (just like me) and she had so much frizz now that she washes with Jonathan Product and her hair look amazing . I love it because it smells so good and you only have to use a very little bit (meaning it lasts a long time) . Today I got my hair highlited and I used J.P shampoo and it work like magic! Don&#x27;t be scared to buy it because of it&#x27;s price it  &lt;br /&gt;is so worth it !</li>
    <li> Well I am very impressed with this.  I also have tried so many different shampoos and this is one of the best, if not the best, I&#x27;ve used.  I say that because whether I straighten my hair or leave it curly, this shampoo makes it feel and look and smell great.  It feels so nice and clean.  I don&#x27;t rinse twice with this because it&#x27;s unnessesary.   &lt;br /&gt;I tried this because of watching Blow Out and on my last trip to America I bought a couple of bottles.  It&#x27;s one of the best purchases I made.  Most girls buy shampoos etc based on packaging and smell and let me tell you, not only does it look and smell great, but what it does for your hair is amazing and apparently it&#x27;s very low in damaging chemicals.  I won&#x27;t hesitate to buy more of Jonathan&#x27;s products next time I go.  I love this and can&#x27;t say enough about it.</li>
    <li> This shampoo made my hair flat and dry when I used it every day.So,I tried using another shampoo and used Jonathan&#x27;s once a week.The one day I used Jonathan shampoo my hair was noticably flat and dull.I ended up throwing it in the trash and went back to my old shampoo.What a disappointment.</li>
    <li> Bought the Condition Theory, Shampoo Theory and Re-do -- and have returned the shampoo and conditioner. I appreciate the efforts put into developing vegan products and sulfate-free shampoos. But they just do not perform well. The shampoo and conditioner neither clean nor moisturize hair. I have bought shampoo and conditioners that cost 1/3 and 1/4 of the price that perform far better than Jonathan&#x27;s. &lt;br /&gt;</li>
    <li> I have to admit I purchased Jonathan Product (shampoo and conditioner) because I bought into the claims that these products were terrific.  Don&#x27;t make the same mistake!  They made my hair feel so unclean and unhealthy.</li>
    <li> I have used hair care products for 48 years now and, this is the best.  &lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;I was not impressed the first time I used it, why?  My hair was a bit dirty, 3 days no wash (yuck). When I put the shampoo on my hair, I only used the amount of a nickle size for medium length. It did not get sudsy at all.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I rinsed it out and put another nickle size amount in my hair and volia....it became very sudsy and washed great.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I then used the conditioner, and just for measurements sake, I added about a quarter size, and left it in my hair while I washed up.  When I rinsed out, it was shiny, clean and smelled good.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Give this product another try, it is well worth it..</li>
    <li> Some people might say that this product does not perform well. I disagree. With most other shampoo and conditioners, they are filled with sythetic ingredients, to include silicone, which give hair that slick slippery feel. When using other products, you need to use a \\&quot;clarifying shampoo\\&quot; every week to get rid of the build-up so your hair can start over.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;With the Jonathan product, you don&#x27;t get that slick slippery feel that you would get from other products, and that&#x27;s because it does not build up on your hair! You need to get used to that feeling, but once you do, your hair will look and feel better every day! You can safely shampoo your hair EVERY DAY with no build up. Your hair will look beautiful every day!  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I have worked in the beauty industry for 15 years and have tried EVERYTHING on the market. With the Jonathan products, I have found the ultimate hair products and have thrown all my other hair products away. Absolutely every product he makes is a the best I have ever used.</li>
    <li> I loved this product.  I have oily hair and fine hair but color treated and can get dry.  This was excellent.  I don&#x27;t know why all the bad reviews here.  I originally bought it for my daughter, but, I used it and now I will get some for myself!!</li>
    <li> It seems that alot of people have a problem with this shampoo for the wrong reasons. Most people are used to the detergent and chemical rich shampoos that create lots of lather and leave your hair feeling slippery. However, those are exactly the things that aren&#x27;t good for hair over the long run.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Although it doesn&#x27;t lather up that much, it doesn&#x27;t take much lather to clean your hair. What&#x27;s important is that you take the time to massage it into your hair and scalp. Anyone that needs alot of this shampoo to fully wash their hair are either (A)not applying the shampoo properly or (B)have hair that&#x27;s long enough to make them potential Guiness World Record candidates. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;In terms of the \\&quot;straw effect,\\&quot; I don&#x27;t like it either. But despite the fact that it \\&quot;feels\\&quot; annoying...that&#x27;s how clean hair is supposed to feel...SQUEAKY CLEAN. Once your hair is dry, it feels great and thats all that matters right? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The bottom line is: Despite the 20 bucks that it costs, I think that having healthy hair and a healthy scalp is worth every penny.   &lt;br /&gt;</li>
    <li> Very picky about shampoo and this a really good for dry color treated hair.  I can tell it has made a difference!</li>
    <li> I understand the idea behind sulfite-free, but no suds&#x3D;no good.  It felt like I was washing my hair with maple syrup.  And used in conjunction with the conditioner, my hair turned out worse than it ever had.</li>
    <li> Let me tell you right now that this product is junk.  Jonathan should have sent it back to the factory to get it fixed again because it is highly suspect.   Maybe if he didn&#x27;t spend all his time mugging for the cameras he would have a decent product. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I even tried his \\&quot;dirt\\&quot;.  That actually caused some hair loss on the top of my head.  He says he is about \\&quot;perfect hair\\&quot;.  No way. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;This is just a rumor, but I heard something about a recall and potential litigation.</li>
    <li> I watched Blow Out adn ordered much of the Jonathan Product the moment it was available. I was so let down. The shampoo &amp; conditioner are below average - I could acre less that they&#x27;re 100% vegan. I feel like I&#x27;ve gotten beter shampoos &amp; conditioners at the drugstore. And for the price, you sure don&#x27;t get much. The shampoo leaves my hair feeling stripped of all moisture - even though it&#x27;s the moisturizing formula &amp; I can&#x27;t the conditioner out of the freaking bottle. It&#x27;s so thick and clumpy.Create Curl stinks, too - it left me with a mess of frizz and no curls were created. I&#x27;ll use this up, but I will not make the mistake of buying Jonathan Product again.</li>
    <li> I agree with the majority of reviewers: these products are bad news. I&#x27;ve used TONs of products and these are quite possibly the worst. These leave your hair feeling \\&quot;grubby\\&quot; and unmanageable. And the price is way too high for them to work so poorly. You can get better products at the drug store. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;And for the reviewer who said something like: \\&quot;you just have to figure out how to use them properly\\&quot;. Say what? Since when is applying shampoo rocket science? And the conditioner won&#x27;t even squeeze out of the bottle. Wassup with that? No-body tested it? &lt;br /&gt;Highly dissapointing.</li>
    <li> I see several previous reviews that acknowledge the fact that this shampoo leaves your hair feeling like \\&quot;straw\\&quot; yet say that is because this shampoo leaves your hair so clean!  Are you kidding me?  If having \\&quot;clean\\&quot; hair means having my hair feel like straw and it does literally feel like straw, then I&#x27;ll happily return to having \\&quot;dirty\\&quot; hair...seriously, I&#x27;ve had smoother, softer hair from drugstore shampoos that cost .99 than this 20 dollar shampoo and conditioner!  I could not even run a comb through my hair while it was wet because this product left my hair feeling so rough! I have rather dry hair, and I merely tried this product on a lark, just to see if it was any good because I am a fan of Jonathan and his show, so I will return to my drugstore shampoo, Dove and Pantene which have always worked well for my dry hair.</li>
    <li> Watching the show I thought that Jonathan really cared about hair and its no doubt that he does still but his shampoo leaves alot to be desired. For example, even in the hot, very humid atmosphere of Houston, TX it left my hair feeling dry and unhealthy, even after using his conditioner (alot of it). My hair looks awful after using it. And the bottle claims that it doesn&#x27;t use toxic ingredients like MEA but it DOES use three different types of PEG, a petroleum based thicker found in most bath products that can erode wooden tables in just minutes. This is just as harmful as MEA, especially for people with sensitive scalps and hair. And it claims not to strip your hair but the products that are supposed to cleanse are much less apparent in the product than the PEG products. Since PEG is a thickener, you&#x27;re also getting a diluted, toxic, solution. Even though Head and shoulders uses MEA I find that that even that works better than this. My hair doesn&#x27;t feel like it has any more of its essential oils and I&#x27;ve switched back to the other hair products Iv&#x27;e been using. It&#x27;s not worth your 20 dollars, its barely worth 5 dollars. My hair stylist also recommended Dove products if you need hydration. DON&#x27;T BUY IT!</li>
