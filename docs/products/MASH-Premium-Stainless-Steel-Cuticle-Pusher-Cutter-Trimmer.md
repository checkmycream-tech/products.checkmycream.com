<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Just received and used tonight. Works great.</li>
    <li> Good for pushing not for trimming.  This is a nice sturdy tool and works great for pushing back the cuticle.  The sharp end is as little dangerous unless you have a steady hand and good eyesight.  It doesn&#x27;t really remove the cuticle.  I&#x27;m puzzled by the 5 star reviews.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I wanted.  Works great!</li>
    <li> I thought the wand part</li>
    <li> I was introduced to one of these at a salon in california. Best product I have ever used</li>
    <li> Very nice Tool for the price. I actually use these for Art Work. Very nice quality, surprising in fact. Took a while to come in, but then there is a surprise in mail!&lt;br /&gt;FYI... The wider end is Larger than I would have expected for nails but excellent because you can alter. The smaller end is a tapered curved blade design that will conform to most any area you need to work.</li>
    <li> Awesome product, Exactly as described.</li>
    <li> It not what I thought it would be. It&#x27;s ok.</li>
    <li> Poor quality shipped from china. Iam not happy</li>
    <li> I was excited for this. Very cheap!! Im a nail fanatic and if you were to buy this at Sallys i think the price is arond $12-$15. And this works great. I bought this along with cuticle remover. Both off amazon and i love them both!! Works great. Wont buy these products from anywhere else.</li>
    <li> arrived on time,packed well and in good condition when received,,product is easy to use and constructed nicely,should be around for a long time</li>
    <li> Works great, nice and sturdy. I love it!</li>
    <li> I use these as dabber for oils. They work fine this was my fourth order</li>
    <li> Nice! Just like I the picture!&lt;br /&gt;Arrived earlier than expected!</li>
    <li> Prefect, better price</li>
    <li> Great item for the price</li>
    <li> These are really sharp. My friend came over and use it to clean under her nail not realizing how sharp it was and sliced her finger. I&#x27;ve been scared and extremely careful to use them since.</li>
    <li> Solid product. Works well.</li>
    <li> Does the job. Takes getting used to because its not symmetrical so you have to flip it ant work in the opposite direction when you change hands.</li>
    <li> Came from China and the little spoon was not smooth. Can create dents in nail. Perhaps I got a defective one.</li>
    <li> This is much better for pushing back my cuticles than an orange stick was!</li>
    <li> Works great. Has an awesome edge that can very easily push cuticles down. You can angle the tool to give you more leverage. Scraping quickly can remove build-up on the nail surface easily. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> works well great for removing die skin around your toes and fingers</li>
    <li> Just what you want it to be.</li>
    <li> Works great on my nails. Both ends of the tool do a great job. The price makes it a great deal. I take care of my own nails and this tool makes it easy to take care of my nails.</li>
    <li> Almost too sharp but does a wonderful job on my cuticles! I&#x27;d definitely reccomend it! Don&#x27;t hesitate to snatch this up</li>
    <li> I received my cuticle pusher in a quick time awesome product</li>
    <li> LOVE this tool.  Best I have ever used in pushing back cuticals. My nails have never looked so good from a home manicure.</li>
    <li> Ends are very sharp and not shaped properly.  I paid $1.80, but it was a complete waste of my money and time. No matter how inexpensive, I don&#x27;t like not being able to use a product I buy and throwing it directly in the garbage.</li>
    <li> Cheap, but the edges were kinda rough.</li>
    <li> The pusher is very sharp and if you are not careful it can damage your nail .</li>
    <li> Great little tool to keep in my purse, nice sharp edges.</li>
    <li> works great to push back cuticles and clean under nails. Also to help chip away that last bit of stubborn no-chip manicure. Just what I was looking for and a great price.</li>
    <li> I received it early.Much more efficient than the orange sticks I was using prior to receiving it. Would recommend if you want a cuticle remover that is easy to use and last forever.</li>
    <li> It has a nice sharpness and arrived pretty quickly.</li>
    <li> This product is perfect. I never had anything to push cuticles back and of I ever did it was plastic and something that breaks easy. This product is stainless steel and works perfect on the cuticle. For the sharp end on use that to clean under my nails. Not sure of its intended for that but it works great and gets the job done. Thanks again for a really sturdy product that works like a charm :)</li>
    <li> This cuticle pusher is okay - pretty standard item nothing special - while the 96 cent price is great - this item comes from China and they don&#x27;t tell you that so your shipping time to get it is 6 weeks +/- --  and when contacting them it is just your item will arrive in about 30 days so don&#x27;t worry blah blah blah.........</li>
    <li> amazing quality for the price but took awhile to arrive!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not great, it kind of works.  Where you would expect smooth metal it&#x27;s really not smooth.  But what do you expect for the price?</li>
    <li> Absolutely amazing!! I didn&#x27;t use any of my other manicure set tools which is a lot. I&#x27;m in love with the cutter really a great job than you mash &lt;3</li>
    <li> Works great! seemed to ship faster than expected...</li>
    <li> This is a great product for the price. I will definitely order it again.</li>
    <li> I bought this to help take off the gel nails I do. This works way better than the little wooden stick I got that came with a gel manicure set. The stainless steel is very durable and heavy and helps take off the gel nail polish quickly.</li>
    <li> This looks cheap and scary to use on your nails.  I&#x27;m afraid to use it as looks like it will cause more harm than good.</li>
    <li> It takes like two months to finally get it, BUT it works great and is sharp.</li>
    <li> Perfect cuticle pusher. Also does a fine job at scraping resin. 😉</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s mostly great, but the edges could be a bit smoother.</li>
    <li> Large enough so that it does not slip out of your hand.  Nice tool.</li>
    <li> Good for th price but it is cheap steel with sharp edges.</li>
    <li> Cheap and gets the job done.</li>
    <li> [[VIDEOID:mo1QMSUBZ0T67J9]]It arrived On Time; the product was Arcuate; and I the Customer &#x3D; very very Satisfied ;-) Thank you do much....now to caring for my cuticles. Now I need to buy some cuticle oil.</li>
    <li> Perfect, specially for the price. It fits the bed of the nail perfectly and really pushes cuticles all the way back. Couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
    <li> Ok. Not as smooth as the other brand I use so it cuts into my nails if I am not careful. Took a really long time to get here.</li>
    <li> Heavy duty. Thick. Smells like metal but supposed to be stainless. Does the cuticles pretty quick and can shave where it sticks.&lt;br /&gt;It is kind of cheap but cheap price as well. Works and not bad.</li>
    <li> I actually didn&#x27;t buy this for my nails. My horse has a seed hole and this item is durable. Also,  really worth the cheap price! I&#x27;m very satisfied. Cleans very nicely and works on your  cuticles to.</li>
    <li> perfect, strong &amp; point end great for adding designs on nails</li>
    <li> This is a great help. You can&#x27;t do a nice manicure without this little thing. It&#x27;s a great quality and costs almost nothing! It will last forever!</li>
    <li> Works great and is durable. Product is made with great quality and delivery was quicker than what I expected. A Must have if you do your own manicure.</li>
    <li> Good product, good price</li>
    <li> This is a great cuticle pusher for a really low price.  Arrived in a reasonable amount of time (less than 2 weeks) considering it came from overseas.  I use it every time that I give myself a manicure and sometimes just to clean under my nails in between manicures.  I have the fastest growing cuticles of all time so they are constantly creeping up my nails so I have to use this tool every time I want to polish.  I am new to the whole world of doing nails so for a beginner like me, this tool makes it easy for my nail beds to look professional and well kept.  I will definitely purchase another if something happens to this one.  So far I have been using it at least once a week for about 3 months.</li>
    <li> I added this cuticle cutter/pusher to my basket of nail paraphernalia. I think everyone who does their nails should have one of these.</li>
    <li> Does it&#x27;s job and the pusher side is a little wide but it works perfect , took some time to get here tho.</li>
    <li> I just got this in the mail today and I loved it! It took forever to arrived but it&#x27;s all worth it! Will buy it again! :-)</li>
    <li> Great Tool. if you do your own manicure it a good tool to push cuticles back, and cleaning the dirt from under nails.</li>
    <li> Received this item when expected. Item works well. I work on my own nails all the time. This is a great addition to my nail tools. I hope to have it for many years. Love it!</li>
    <li> Havent used it yet but will. Doesnt look as thick as the one i have</li>
    <li> great tool for taking off gel polish</li>
    <li> This cuticle pusher is just ok. It&#x27;s not a great quality of metal and the cuticle pusher part on one of them has a jagged edge, which is not good when you&#x27;re trying NOT to damage your nails or cuticle bed.</li>
    <li> After waiting so long for my cuticle pusher I finally went to Ulta and bought their brand cuticle pusher. The one I bought on Amazon finally came on a slow boat from China I compared the two and the Ulta pusher was way better I paid $12.00 for theirs and it is a far better quality. My advice even though the pusher on Amazon is only like  $3.00 save your money and get a good one the old saying &amp;#34;you get what you pay for&amp;#34; is so true. BUT if you are looking for cheap and willing to wait 5 weeks for this all I can say is its ok....</li>
    <li> It works.  I just need to use it more</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful product - just like in the salon- I am able to do my nails just like in the salon. I use a little hand lotion on my cuticals and then push them down.  This product will also scratch off bits of nail polish that is left over from the nail polish remover. The price was ridiculously low - the only thing is it took a few weeks to a month to get to me - but for me that was fine! enjoy!</li>
    <li> Does what I bought it to do!  I was tired of buying all the wood cuticle pushers so I went for this bad boy.  It. Is. Sharp.  Perfect for any stubborn cuticles (like toes n stuff).  Worth the money!! Great value!</li>
    <li> Excellent. Would buy again. Wish the packaging was so flimsy. I leave mine in for protection and it is falling apart.</li>
    <li> Great tool for removing those hidden cuticles.  Great quality.</li>
    <li> Works great and has sharp edges.</li>
    <li> Arrived really early!! May not be the best quality, but who cares for the price.  I bought it to scoop acrylic powder and it does the job!</li>
    <li> Great tool...good quality worth the money...when you purchase them I would recommend buy them in quantities...4 or five....I would buy them again</li>
    <li> Nice quality.  feels weighty in the hand and sturdy.  Not sure if it&#x27;s stainless or maybe low grade stainless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But both ends are nice and sharp for cleaning cuticles and cleaning under nails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4 stars only because it took 4 weeks to receive it.  Even media mail is faster than that.</li>
    <li> Horrible, would not recommend.</li>
    <li> Awful product, damage for the nails</li>
    <li> I like the rather sharp end of this cuticle pusher and the tool seems well made. This is the best such tool I&#x27;ve owned yet.</li>
    <li> I love this product, exactly what I needed. Very sturdy and strong.</li>
    <li> This thing is great!! It works so well I would recommend this to anyone! Great price as well can&#x27;t beat this.</li>
    <li> good quality and not weak or flimsy like pewter.... will obviously perform as intended... recommended..a great addition to any cuticle kit.</li>
    <li> stainless steel tool, has nice weight to it. looks well made (not German or American well made but Chinese well made). I&#x27;ve had it for a few months, used it around water and it hasn&#x27;t rusted or anything. the side with a cuticle pusher is pretty wide, as wide as some of my nails. my only complaint that it is a little thick. but it doesn&#x27;t prevent me from using it the way it is supposed to be used. the other end is knife-like sharp edge. good for cleaning edges of your nails, removing traces of stubborn nail polish etc. I highly recommend using cuticle pusher only  after a bath or a shower, on softened skin</li>
    <li> Cheap molded  pot metal ripoff mailed from China. A piece of junk.</li>
    <li> This has metal burs on it and I wouldn&#x27;t order another one because of that. Very sharp edges and would be afraid someone would hurt themselves</li>
    <li> although the shipping came before the date, the stainless steel it isn&#x27;t strong enough the product didn&#x27;t work well, it wasa extremely hard to take off my cuticles with this</li>
    <li> this thing is great. i love to use it for left over gel polish that is left over. it makes the removal of gel polish a breeze, as well as making cuticles much prettier in the process</li>
    <li> I bought this to replace my old cuticle tool which broke. It was exactly what I was wanting! It is sturdy and does the job of pushing back and trimming the cuticles. I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Product is so great and useful.  Durable, sanitizable.....and effective at pushing back cuticles and cleaning under nails.  I love mine</li>
    <li> You have to be careful with the steel pushers, because they will take top layer of nail off, in saying that I have 3 of them. Just follow the direction and they will work well for you.</li>
    <li> It does the job, but you can tell it isn&#x27;t made from quality steel.. Totally mass produced in a factory.. has that blah feel</li>
    <li> It is just as described. Works great to push back overgrown cuticles, which I suggest doing after soaking your feet or taking a shower.</li>
    <li> Will last a lifetime!</li>
    <li> Works well and is much less expensive here than in the shops.</li>
    <li> Works well, great price would buy more if ever needed. I will be sure to let my friends know where I got it</li>
    <li> Yes this gets the job done and it&#x27;s very cheap in price. It pushes my cuticles and I use the other side to clean the gunk out from under my nails YAAASSS.</li>
    <li> Perfect, solid quality - I do not know how they can be making money on these items. Ordered for all my friends.</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t cost much, kinda bleh...</li>
    <li> This is a perfect item. Works wonders. For a great price too! The spoon type side helps easily remove gel polish after your nails are soaked in acetone. The other end helps get the excess polish off prior to curing the gel polish. A+ item!</li>
    <li> For the price paid is woth it. Takes too long to receive but if you dont need it right away it&#x27;s not that bad waiting for it.</li>
    <li> Nice weight, feels good and heavy in the hand.  Does what it needs to do.  Works best when you push back your cuticles after a shower so they are soft and easier to remove.</li>
    <li> Nice product,fast shipping!!!Thanks))</li>
    <li> Seems like a good quality tool.</li>
    <li> Product came on time as directed. It was definitely worth the wait! I use it all the time when I give myself a mani and pedi! Made from great quality. Highly recommend to any nail enthusiast!</li>
    <li> This works as well as the 10.00 one sold by my local beauty supply store. It is not as polished and pretty, but it does the job!</li>
    <li> Heavy duty metal.  Works the way it is supposed to.  Just get your cuticles soft before using.</li>
    <li> I carry this item every where it is great for cuticles as well as a tool like a screwdriver. I noticed men love this item too</li>
    <li> Exactly as purchased and arrived before expected date.</li>
    <li> This product is very good considering the price on it ... The truth I thought I was going to b disappointed with the cuticle pusher ... But I wasn&#x27;t the quality is good ,it does what it supposed to do .. Works great .. I RECOMMEND THIS CUTICLE PUSHER ... U WONT REGRET PURCHASING IT...</li>
    <li> Fake knock off, poor quality</li>
    <li> This is just like the ones I&#x27;ve seen in the stores for $12 and works just as well.  My best online purchase ever!</li>
    <li> not too bad. great for if you are in a hurry for one. there are better ones out there. recommond the ASP brand one at sally beauty supply.</li>
    <li> Very small and I had to smooth the edges because they were digging into my clients nail plates.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this! Can&#x27;t find this in stores- salon quality!</li>
    <li> Yes, it&#x27;s a great price but the delivery time was lengthy and I found the product wasn&#x27;t worth the wait. It was a lot smaller than I thought it would be and had very sharp edges. Not what I needed.</li>
    <li> Great quality great price and arrived pretty quickly from China</li>
    <li> great price, works great!!</li>
    <li> I ordered this small item well over a month ago and have received nothing I&#x27;m sure it would work great If they would actually send it to me. Had I known it would take 2 months to get here I probably just would have walked up to my local walgreens and just bought the thing in person.</li>
    <li> Shipping took forever. When it finally got here I was highly impressed, this item works perfectly. I even tried a test nail without soaking it ( just to see how good it works ) it lifted the gel polish right off without leaving any residue behind. It works on fingernails &amp; toenails. I would purchase again if I need another one in the future.</li>
    <li> I love this cuticle pusher. I dont really like trimming my cuticles. I use the cuticle pusher and cuticle oil and voila! Decent looking nails</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m pleased with it. Does what it&#x27;s supposed to. It was very cheap amd great quality. I would recommend it.</li>
    <li> It does the job but is a bit too harsh on the nail. It scraped some of my top layer off as i was trying to push my cuticles back.</li>
    <li> It took a month to get to my house but I liked it. This is my first ever cuticle pusher and I liked it. Wasn&#x27;t bad..</li>
    <li> very good implement...happy with this purchase I would  buy this again.I shop on Amazon for everything and think they are great!</li>
    <li> The product is great and at an amazing price. The only grievance I have was it took over a month and a half to ship to me.</li>
    <li> It does what it is supposed to, but since the curved tip is so narrow, I am constantly making deep scratches on my nail with the sharp corners when I am removing my gel nail polish. I will notbeven use the other end, it is awkwardly shaped, and the edge isn&#x27;t smooth, it has grooves that I don&#x27;t think is meant to be there. I don&#x27;t feel that it is well made. Well, I got what I paid for I guess.</li>
    <li> Pusher is good but the scrapper is not</li>
    <li> For years I have tried different things to trim my cuticles. Imagine to my surprise they have a tool designed specifically for that purpose UNDER $2. Delivered. Easy peasy to use, even comes with a tiny plastic carrier. So that way I do not confuse it with a hangnail tool. It is so cheap and useful they ought to sell millions. One end to push it back and the other end to nip it free....shu</li>
    <li> I LOVE this tool! I don&#x27;t have the extra money to always pay someone to do my nails so I&#x27;ve been buying stuff here and there and this is made very well and it&#x27;s at a good price. A must have if you want your nails to look professional.</li>
    <li> Works well and the shipping was surprisingly quick considering it came from overseas.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t think this would be as good as it turned out to be. It really does get rid of more cuticle than orange sticks and the plasticky cuticle pusher I got at Sally Beauty Supply.</li>
    <li> GREAT!!!!! Especially for gel nail removal and cleaning up those cuticles</li>
    <li> Perfect for scrapping gel off!</li>
    <li> A must have for your nail care</li>
    <li> this the bad cuticle pusher i never see in my life.</li>
    <li> Shipping took quite awhile, but good value, and it does what it&#x27;s supposed to do.  I use the larger side to push back my cuticles when doing manicures.  I&#x27;m not totally sure how to use the smaller side, though!</li>
    <li> shipping took forever but finally got it it seems great 👌</li>
    <li> I love the cuticle pusher its really good and it takes away the part that you don&#x27;t need. i like this cuticle pusher i will certainly buy stuff from here again.</li>
    <li> This product does the job of keeping my unruly cuticles neat and trimmed.  I have tried LOTS of different cuticle pushers, and none seem to work without tearing the cuticle.  This is very effective at pushing my cuticles back.  I definitely recommend it for those with excess cuticle that needs to be removed.</li>
    <li> Normally I have to go to a beauty supply company and spend a ridiculous amount of money on one of these things. I was skeptical at first not knowing the quality since I was unfamilar with the company. When it arrived I found it to be very heavy, very sturdy, and very sharp just like the ones I use at work! Great professional quality without the over pricing at big chain beauty supply companies.</li>
    <li> Perfect tool for a fast nail Maintanace</li>
    <li> Got this earlier than estimated delivery date so I was happy about that. I just got done using it. Worked fine. Works how its suppose to. I also like that it was really cheap, so i&#x27;m happy.</li>
    <li> The item is not at all what I thought it would be, and it is poorly made for what it is. Considering the price I paid for it, it is not even worth the hassle to return it.  It is already in the garbage.</li>
    <li> I have to use a bit of a lighter hand than I would normally, but this tool is great at pushing back cuticles.</li>
    <li> Great stainless steel cuticle pusher. It is sturdily constructed and pushes back the cuticle well.</li>
    <li> This is nice and useful tool for my manicure . I was looking for something affordable and give it try and I would like say I&#x27;m very pleased with my purchase. I have used it so many times since I bought and it&#x27;s nice and very happy with the price and shipping from&amp;#34;Mash&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> This is not a genuine MASH cuticle pusher when sold by HC-Talk. It is a blunt, poorly shaped piece of metal which takes weeks to arrive from China.  Search the other buyers for a MASH cuticle pusher sold by Mash and ships quickly from CA. The true Mash product rates 5 stars!</li>
    <li> Easy to use, good quality, inexpensive for home or professional use. No issues with this set and what a money saver! I&#x27;d definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> Works good, I use it after using cuticle oil and cream and massaging it into my cuticles.  I&#x27;m working on growing nice natural nails out after years of wasting $$ on acrylics.  This tool is definitely useful in maintaining healthy nail beds and cuticles.</li>
    <li> It didnt work on me, I&#x27;m planning to return all if I can</li>
    <li> Works well, lightweight, quick (and free) shipping across the world. It took about a week. I&#x27;d recommend it.</li>
    <li> Exactly as described, pictured.  This is the same tool used at my local nail salon which is why I selected it.  The curved end has the perfect curve to run nicely over the top of my nails.  I use this to remove the final bits of my gel polish after soaking.  Just takes the polish off without stressing or damaging the nail.</li>
    <li> I love it. Got a little weight to it too. :)</li>
    <li> Good quality and very cheap. I don&#x27;t mind if I get the product like I think 3 weeks because they come from China. 😃</li>
    <li> At a great price, this is one of the best nail products I&#x27;ve used. I use it with the CND Cuticle Remover and have saved a lot of money doing my own manicures!</li>
    <li> Very good product just take long time to get home like 22 days or more. But other than that I love it it helps to remove cuticle very fast.</li>
    <li> love the product, just wish the directions were written in English not russian</li>
    <li> They are new and very durable.</li>
    <li> I love this product and for the price you can&#x27;t beat it.  The only problem is that the shipping takes a few more days than prime members are use to.  It does its job and easily pushes the cuticles down.  The material is metal and it feels very durable.  I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Inferior product, somewhat crudely made.  Comes directly from China and took over a month to arrive.  I ended up buying a colete manicure set that has one of much higher quality in it.  On the plus side, inexpensive.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very pleased with this cuticle pusher. Between this tool and my Clyppi nail clippers (  [[ASIN:B00J7Q1AV6 Clyppi Toenail Clippers For Cool Dudes, Well Groomed Men &amp; Stylish Ladies | Perfect Birthday Gifts For Men &amp; Women | Best Nail Clippers to Trim your Toe Nails | Popular Easy Grip Nail Clipper | Professional Heavy Duty Stainless Steel Nail Cutter | Lifet...]] or [[ASIN:B00GQ0GD4A Clyppi Fingernail Clippers For Cool Dudes, Well Groomed Men &amp; Stylish Ladies | Perfect Birthday Gifts For Men &amp; Women | Best Nail Clippers to Trim your Finger Nails | Popular Easy Grip Nail Clipper | Professional Heavy Duty Stainless Steel Nail Cutter |...]] ) I have no excuse not to have beautifully manicured nails!</li>
    <li> its an awesome tool it works well and its durable and very professional .</li>
    <li> I have found many uses for this tool</li>
    <li> It does what it says it does.</li>
    <li> I received this item earlier than expected. I was supposed to receive by Jan. 27, 2015.  I received this item on January 14th. Very sturdy. I love the long head so that I can clean cuticles and heat up so that I can &amp;#34;iron&amp;#34; on my Jamberry wraps onto my nails to remove any lifting or bubbling.</li>
    <li> This tool is really easy to use and gets the job done really well.</li>
    <li> This product is a high quality tool that I use every time for the manicures and pedicures I give myself.  I couldn&#x27;t do without it!</li>
    <li> I got this tool to help maintain my nails. The wide tip side works as long as you a gentle while pushing you cuticle back and the blade tip side works well for scraping soften over grown cuticle fast and easy. I had no problems. If you do get this make sure you either soak you hands or use a cuticle remover so you don&#x27;t have to force it and do damage to your nails.</li>
    <li> GREAT FOR GEL NAILS. PERFECT REMOVER.</li>
    <li> Arrived on time, and works well!</li>
    <li> It is a great product for manicure loving people.  Great for cleaning out dirt underneath the nails and a good cuticle pusher. If you don&#x27;t know why you need one, these are to push the cuticle so you get a nice clean manicure. Make sure to soften the cuticle first with oils or a cuticle softener.</li>
    <li> Great tool, item as described and shipped as promised.</li>
    <li> Works really well and great value. The pushing tip is nice and wide with just the right amount of curve and sharpness.</li>
    <li> I think this tool is very good and does the work it suppose to do, so I&#x27;m very pleased with it.  Also the product came sooner then expected which made me happy since I taught it was going to be a month wait.</li>
    <li> old fashioned style product that works well....</li>
    <li> Works good. Just like the one&#x27;s in the salon.</li>
    <li> Great cuticle pusher. Gets the job done and it&#x27;s sturdy. It&#x27;s a great weight too and doesn&#x27;t feel flimbsy.</li>
    <li> Great Product.  Great quality.</li>
    <li> This is such a cheaply made pusher. It was absolutely worthless to buy and I feel bad for the environment having it shipped from god knows where. It was absolutely worthless for my nails. It is shaped too thickly to do a good job and it scrapes the nail bed.</li>
    <li> 4 stars...4 out of 5 actually worked.  A great deal for a nice to have length of charger cord.</li>
    <li> Took waaaaaaay too long to get delivered (a month to be exact) other than that the product is nice. Its kinda small not too small. I thought itwas gonna be those big ones they use at the salon</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m pretty sure I read this before I bought it, but when it came it was nothing like I expected.  I have a cuticle trimmer that is shaped like a V that is great for trimming my dry cuticles.  I thought this trimmer had that feature to, but it looks more like a scalpel.  I don&#x27;t know how to use it???  As far as the cuticle pusher end, the very first nail I tried it on it slipped past my cuticle and cut my finger.</li>
    <li> NICE AND SOLID... IS A GOOD ADDITION TO ANYONES NAIL KIT!! WAS SUPRISED BY THE PRICE AND HOW GOOD OF A QUALITY THIS IS!!!</li>
    <li> Hey, thanks to all the silly strangers who complained about this being too sharp and &#x27;scraping&#x27; the nail too much.  They must&#x27;ve dulled these based on all the idiotic complaints, now this isn&#x27;t sharp  enough to be used for removing gel polish and completely useless.  I wish I didn&#x27;t buy 3-4 or these worthless pieces of junk</li>
    <li> I bought this to help me keep my cuticles under control between my salon visits. It&#x27;s great</li>
    <li> This is the real thing, just like in a salon, nice and sharp and cheaper than what you would pay at the store</li>
    <li> Whatever you use this for I think it&#x27;s helpful. In my case I use it to clean toenails and it works wonders. Perfect. Not too sharp and both ends can work. Most people like to clean their big toenails if they are active and this thing does the job well after a trimming. No complaints.</li>
    <li> Love this! This was the best buy I&#x27;ve done in a while. Super solid, durable, easy to grip and multi-purpose. I use it to push back cuticles, clean up edges when applying nail polish, clean under my nails and even open new sealed boxes of nail stuff. I bought several and placed them strategically around the house. A must have in any nail connoisseur&#x27;s kit! Don&#x27;t mess with those feeble wood ones that warp and give splinters anymore!</li>
    <li> i love it and it works great for cleaning under your nails</li>
    <li> I use these to keep my nails shaped and keep my cuticles neat and this works well for that.  Now if I could just stop losing them...</li>
    <li> Super cheap and it is great for what I need. I personally love the sharpness and the price! All stainless steel can be sterilized so that is a plus. Very satisfied and would definitely buy this again!</li>
    <li> its really good for the price</li>
    <li> My new favorite nail tool!  This high quality stainless steel cuticle tool comes in a nice sleeve so it can go anywhere you do!  It is made well, the design is perfect for my nails and nail bed shape.  It should last me my life time!</li>
    <li> a good pusher for that price! need to be a lil carefull and maybe soak your cuticles in warm soap water first and then use the tool.</li>
    <li> Does just what I thought it would at a good price.</li>
    <li> The trimmer is great.  Some precaution is a must as it could cut if not used carefully. Customer service is great, shipment was fast.</li>
    <li> I actually use this while doing my acrylic nails. The curved end is a small scoop and the sharp end is great for shaping and removing small bits around the cuticles.</li>
    <li> I love this product its perfect for what I want to do with it. I would totally get this again if I need another one.</li>
    <li> I love it, its just not too sharp and doesn&#x27;t pull as easily as I thought it will pull my cuticle</li>
    <li> I wish i had bought one of these months ago. Works AMAZING :)</li>
    <li> use this all the time, glad I bought a couple of them.</li>
    <li> This is a great little tool for pushing cuticles back and cleaning up the sides of nails.  Very durable and easy to handle.  I definitely recommend this item!</li>
    <li> After years of using an orange stick and finally realizing it was putting ridges in my nails, I am hoping this tool will care for my cuticles and do away with the damaging ridges.  The curved edge is not at all sharp on the one I received and feels comfortable pushing the cuticle.  I like the quality of the stainless steel and I&#x27;m sure it will last forever. Not exactly sure of the intended use for the pointed end but I can say it works well for cleaning up nail polish that gets on your skin at the edges of your nails. I&#x27;ve been using this tool with a cuticle cream for a week now and I&#x27;m loving it. For the few dollars it costs, this is a must-have.</li>
    <li> bought it for my girlfriend who couldnt find one of these anywhere locally.  she uses it weekly and loves it</li>
    <li> Works great. My daughter keeps stealing mine...these are great to have!</li>
    <li> It works great to remove gel polish and cuticle.</li>
    <li> These are high quality, and I love that they come in their individual plastic wrappers!</li>
    <li> Shipping takes forever. I finally just went to Sally&#x27;s and bought one because everything else I&#x27;d ordered to start doing my gel nails had already arrived. When this finally did come, the comparison to the one I got from Sally&#x27;s was startling. It&#x27;s much smaller and not as easy to handle. You get what you pay for and this is an inferior product imo.</li>
    <li> I love to do my nails at home, and I cannot believe I&#x27;ve waited so long to purchase one of these.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smooth &amp;#34;pusher&amp;#34; side is sharp and it does the job.  Just a couple of swipes on the surface of each nail and the cuticle is pushed back enough to trim.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pointy side is great to get under the pushed back cuticles just a bit more if you want them to be more &amp;#34;lifted,&amp;#34; but it also works well for cleaning the area under the nail as another reviewer mentioned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would definitely buy this again!</li>
    <li> It is not the best cuticle pusher out there. I&#x27;ve had better ones. For the price, you get what you pay for. I will be buying other brand that costs a bit more, but it does the job.</li>
    <li> This came faster than expected delivery, which I was happy about. But I can definitely see why other reviewers are saying this is too &amp;#34;sharp.&amp;#34; It&#x27;s definitely a little sharp, but You just have to be careful and gentle so that it doesn&#x27;t scrape ur nail up. I Don&#x27;t like the other side of it (for cleaning under nails).. But overal good product, especially for the price.</li>
    <li> For 5 bucks you can&#x27;t beat the price, great little tool to have on hand to help push back those cutiles.will definetly order from this company again. Thankse for the prompt delivery..</li>
    <li> This works perfect! It pushed back my cuticles with ease and it is so easy to remove the dead skin with the other end.</li>
    <li> This tool works wonderfully, it does just what it should. the tip used to get the unwanted skin off works like a charm!</li>
    <li> It is perfect not to big just the right size. And the price is the best part usely these are thirty dollars.</li>
    <li> This will make tipping nails on life-size preemie and newborn collectible &#x27;reborn&#x27; dolls much easier.  Price was crazy low- and shipping time was good.</li>
    <li> It works great. I used it the day it came.. it did take a while to come in.</li>
    <li> I am rating this cuticle pusher/cutter four stars bc it is just how I Imagined it would be! It&#x27;s super light and not dull at all. I love the fact that you can just rinse it with soap and warm water ir alcohol to sterilize it. I regret not purchasing more than just one. I really love this product, its too bad I couldn&#x27;t find one this good and at such a valuable and reasonable price!</li>
    <li> Took a long time to get here but I think it&#x27;s worth it. The cuticle pusher is kinda sharp and can scratch your nails, so I filed mine a bit. Now it works like a charm. I totally recommend this.</li>
    <li> I am not really crazy about this cuticle pusher.  It looks cheap and took a while to arrive</li>
    <li> Smaller than expected but product was what I needed</li>
    <li> It took so long for me to finally recieve it. Took about 3 weeks. And i dont even really feel like using it anymore cause i totally forgot i had even ordered it.</li>
    <li> I have been doing my own manicures and this is a must!! It&#x27;s study and gets the job done!</li>
    <li> Great! Even better for the price!</li>
    <li> This nail tool is industrial strength. I was surprised by its weight and balance and to see it is about the diameter of a pencil and a generous 5.25&amp;#34; long. The &#x27;spoon&#x27; end easily is as wide as my index nail, making it an easy chore to prep my nail bed for faux nails. The pointy end is a cuticle cutter and general under nail cleaner. This is way more tool than I expected. I am super delighted with it.</li>
    <li> I like the ends.  Very useful in cleaning up cuticles for a manicure.</li>
    <li> Exactly as described and pictured. The knife end has a nice sharp edge and is great for scraping excess stuck cuticle off. I use this to help apply Jamberry nails. Shipping was a little slower than anticipated, though.</li>
    <li> They work well (I bought 3: one for the car and the others around.) You cannot beat the price.</li>
    <li> This is a very sturdy and very effective cuticle pusher.  I love it!</li>
    <li> Very sturdy and works great. Feels like salon quality. My cuticles have never looked better (I use this along with Gena Healthy Hoof Cream).</li>
    <li> Item came as described and shipping was quicker than projected.</li>
    <li> A very good tool to have...</li>
    <li> The quality is great. Came in time and overall good product for nail techs or just for people who paint their nails</li>
    <li> I hesitated to purchase this cuticle pusher after reading some of the negative reviews but given the price I decided to try it.  What I like: It has some nice heft to it, I thought it would be very light but it&#x27;s about 14 grams/ .5 oz, so it is heavier than my current cuticle pusher.  It is about 5 inches long.  The width is not as wide as I thought (I&#x27;m uploading a photo), it is about 1/4 inch wide, a little narrower than a paperclip but I find it does work well to push my cuticles back, better than my current cuticle pusher.  The cons: The front corners of the scoop side are surprisingly sharp.  When I push my cuticles I hold it at an angle so only the rounded front portion touches my nail and it is fine but if I were to hold it at less of an angle so the front corners also touched my nail, for example using it to lightly push softened gel polish off the nail, I think the front corners of the scoop would easily scratch the nail.  I will probably run the corners over a file so they are not too sharp. Also, it took about 2.5 weeks to arrive, faster than the Seller estimated, but I know to some that might feel a bit long.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a little smaller than I thought, but for only $2, you really couldn&#x27;t go wrong! Works great for those self-manicures/pedicures.</li>
    <li> So I bought this item because I wanted to start doing my own manicures! I love it! Oh and trust me when they say your item is gonna take a long time for it to arrive, they&#x27;re not kidding! I ordered this on Jan 10th and received on Feb. 4th. It didn&#x27;t bother me, because I was not in desperate need for it, But I do want to put it out there for ppl to know just in case they need it right away.</li>
    <li> I love this little thing, help me a lot to get my nails look bautiful! No more cuticles, I push all of them and then cuts! looks clean!! Nails made by me. :)</li>
    <li> Easy to hold to, works well on cuticles and i do love using it!  Will probably order another one soon.</li>
    <li> Overall, a good cuticle pusher. It&#x27;s very sturdy, and easy to use. And the smaller end used to cut/trim the cuticle isn&#x27;t too sharp. The wide end of this tool, is more square than round. My cuticles are more round in shape, but it&#x27;s only a matter of angling the cuticle pusher to adjust to my round cuticles, so no biggie. It&#x27;s definitely a handy tool to have if you work with nails.</li>
    <li> This cuticle pusher is my favorite to use. I have a couple of them, but this does such a good job I always use this one.</li>
    <li> Great purchase! Very heavy duty and does not tarnish. Definitely worth the purchase especially at the price! Just get it! ;)</li>
    <li> Sturdy and quality made! This product is great for my nail clients. At great price this purchase is a plus</li>
    <li> This is the best cuticle timmer and pusher ever! If your reading this then you need to buy it! no second thoughts!</li>
    <li> Used with the cuticle oil was it was most effective.  These cuticle pushers are hard to find in drugstores usually.</li>
    <li> Great product especially if you are a diyer and do your own nails at home. In fact when I go back to the salon I may take my own cuticle pusher now lol</li>
    <li> Great quality stainless steel tool.  If you&#x27;re not a professional be careful using this product. You can easily damage your cuticle if not used correctly.  Works great with the product called cuticle away to remove all dead skin around and on the nail. The tool Cleans up nicely. Fast shipping.</li>
    <li> Love this so much I purchased 3 more.</li>
    <li> Stainless steel cuticle pusher - does work and I really like the curved edge side. I was able to quickly push back all of my cuticles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When prepping my nails to be painted I like to push back my cuticles to have more space on my nail to decorate. The only drawback to this particular cuticle pusher is the ends of each side of the tool (the tips) are very sharp. Because of this the tool will scrape the nail while pushing back my cuticles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I still think this tool is worth the money - cheaply priced, durable - and does work well. When I get done pushing back the cuticles and then painting my nails; when they are completely dry I always make sure to rub oil on the cuticles and nails. This softens the cuticles and makes them easier to push back next time!</li>
    <li> This is great! Love it.</li>
    <li> Its exactly as you would think it would be.Very sturdy, good feel and size. Wonderful price, great product, a must have!! :)</li>
    <li> Really good high quality. Is a little heavy for something like that, but that&#x27;s okay.</li>
    <li> Great quality - especially for the price.</li>
    <li> Very sturdy works well and rust resistance</li>
    <li> I like it. It is good for the price. Now I don&#x27;t have to buy an expensive one at the store that does the exact same thing. The only issue it that it came on the slowest boat from china. I swore it took over a month and a half. So be prepared to wait. It&#x27;s not very heavy. But not too light piece of metal. I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Perfect combo. Very useful when you working on your nails. Very sturdy and happy I bought it. Need to buy another one....</li>
    <li> Arrived on time and were exactly as stated.  Thank you</li>
    <li> i got it within a week of ordering (possibly less). i was surprised by it&#x27;s weight. it&#x27;s good that it&#x27;s heavy i personally think it shows that it isn&#x27;t flimsy and that it is durable. absolutely love it, it works amazing</li>
    <li> This is an alright product, other reviews said it was really sharp however mine was barely able to cut the cuticles off and I was pushing hard. I had a friend try it too and they said that it was not me. Not sure if its a one time problem but I would not buy again. It is also awkqard to hold and use it does not feel right and slips a lot. If it had been sharp I would have needed stitches.</li>
    <li> Nice and heavy. Came in little plastic pouch for storing.</li>
    <li> You get what you pay for. The rough-machined pewter-like finish didn&#x27;t match my expectation of shiny stainless. Kind of afraid to use these on my own nails, so these  go in the garage toolbox or the round file. Better luck to me next time!</li>
    <li> I had not expected this product to be shipped from China.  But it did.  It arrived on time.  I&#x27;ve used it repeatedly.  And am satisfied w/ its precise ends.  Sharp but not sharp as to cut but just sharp enough to do its job as designed and intended.  I am satisfied.  One word of precaution:  I do not know if this product is Stainless Steel as it&#x27;s represented because it is NOT marked as such.</li>
    <li> Sharp, precise, great quality.</li>
    <li> Works very well! I&#x27;ve gotten a lot of use out of this since I got it. The cutter&lt;br /&gt;trimmer is really sharp and makes dealing with cuticles and deeply cleaning&lt;br /&gt;under your nails a snap. Most nail clippers have a swing out nail cleaning&lt;br /&gt;tool; but compared to this tool those seem useless by comparison.&lt;br /&gt;There are more expensive options, but this tool works just fine.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Fabulous buy. I use this and cuticle cream on my fingers and toes a few times a week. This is all you need for nice cuticles!</li>
    <li> sort of rough around the edges but amazing for the price.</li>
    <li> Great quality! Will definitely buy another and other items from this vendor.</li>
    <li> HALF THE SIZE OF THE PICTURE. BUT DOES THE JOV</li>
    <li> These are NOT stainless steel!</li>
    <li> love these trimmer. I&#x27;ve had it for over a year now and it is still nice and sharp</li>
    <li> Really poor quality, would have returned it but more hastle then it&#x27;s worth.  Threw it away.  Really doesn&#x27;t even rate a star, but have to or can&#x27;t submit review.</li>
    <li> This is well made instrument.</li>
    <li> It has many uses and its sturdy and well made.</li>
    <li> Great pusher! Works very well!</li>
    <li> I received this tool today and absolutely love it!  The cuticle pusher end works great but my favorite end is the other end - it&#x27;s a little curved sharp knife-like tool.  It works really well for a variety of tasks (i.e. getting excess acrylic out from under your acrylic nails).  Beautifully crafted with a small plastic case.  I think this is my new favorite nail tool!</li>
    <li> This is a very well-made pusher. Its sharpness is just enough to remove cuticles and dry skin but not scratch the nail surface. I like it and I will buy the same piece again shall I lose this one.</li>
    <li> satisfied with the purchase, really like</li>
    <li> Very nice stainless steel cuticle pusher. Does exactly what it&#x27;s meant for, perfect for cleaning around and under nails. Received product very fast.</li>
    <li> This product is simple to use and has ridges so you wont have to worry about slipping. The edges are sharp and for the price and money you will save is alot of money</li>
    <li> A little rough but was very inexpensive.  Can&#x27;t complain.</li>
    <li> This product is so easy to use even if you&#x27;re an amateur like me. I use this product on my fingers and toes. This is to push back your cuticles. Best used with Sally Hansen Instant Cuticle Remover.</li>
    <li> Great price, product and very satisfied</li>
    <li> This cuticle pusher will not damage or scrape your nails, like some other claim. This one is great at pushing back the cuticle without damaging the nail bed. The trimmer end works great too!</li>
    <li> Excellent quality and the price was good.  Use them to apply extra heat to my Jamberry nail wraps when necessary.  I&#x27;ll also consider giving some away during in-home demos and/or as party gifts.</li>
    <li> Very good!! Thank you</li>
    <li> I bought this for peeling off nail vinyls for doing nail art. It works perfectly but shipping was extremely slow. Took over a month to get here.</li>
    <li> This cuticle pusher works very well and does not damage my nails like other metal tools I have used. Great product, reasonably priced!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s so easy now to push on my cuticles. I don&#x27;t know why I didn&#x27;t know about this before. My hands look always great now.&lt;br /&gt;Good quality, I bet it&#x27;s going to last forever.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s great for scraping barnacles off thebottom of your boat.</li>
    <li> As the other reviews say, this is very sharp.  It&#x27;s GREAT at removing the cuticles though.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok. It does help push cuticles back;however the other end isn&#x27;t very helpful.</li>
    <li> it is ok. does the job</li>
    <li> Ordered 2...love them!</li>
    <li> I may end up ordering more of these.  Not only a great deal, but I received the shipment so quickly.</li>
    <li> all I can say is: I Love it!</li>
    <li> Unless you wanna be bleeding then get it!</li>
    <li> helps do own manicure</li>
    <li> Very good quality and for a great price!</li>
    <li> Its great and very professional</li>
    <li> This item came wayy before the expected date! Before this I would push back my cuticles with orange wooden sticks. Now using this steel pusher I find that I can get them done quickly &amp; with great results! The other end of the pusher can be used to trim hang nails. It&#x27;s sharp but not too sharp that it will cut you when you use the opposite end. The price is especially a treat. I highly recommend!</li>
    <li> CRUDE AND ROUGH!  VERY BAD WORKMANSHIP</li>
