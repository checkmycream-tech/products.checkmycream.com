      <li>This is really great soap!</li>
      <li>Now for what I didn&#x27;t like about this soap which caused me to toss it into the trash bin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Working up a lather with this soap isn&#x27;t even close to the best which are Tallow based shaving soaps like Tabac.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Love the smell, reminds me of old school barbershop.</li>
    <li> Nice mild scent. Husband tells me it lathers nicely.</li>
    <li> This is part if a Christmas gift for my son. He has used this product before and loved it so I am sure there will be no complaints.</li>
    <li> This stuff is fantastic, I wish it had a stronger smell to it though but other then that this stuff works fantastically.</li>
    <li> This is a great product. I stopped using my gillete foam as it used to leave skin very dry.... this one keep skin very fresh after shaving.</li>
    <li> I really liked this product. It lathers extremely easily and provides a great glide. Shaving has been made much easier.</li>
    <li> This is a good shave soap.  I have used this and [[ASIN:B001JHEY14 Proraso Shaving Soap, Ultra Sensitive Skin 5.2 oz (147 g)]] and like them both.  This product comes packaged as just a round block of soap (as shown in the pictures).  You really need to put the block it into another container to have a good way to get it on your shaving brush.  Alternately, you can scrape a little off and put it into your shaving mug.  Trying to use your brush to wet the block and get a nice amount onto your brush while leaving it in the package it was shipped in does not work well.  That is not really a negative of the soap, and it is probably why the product is well priced.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the lather the soap produces.  It is rich and feels great on my face.  If you are new to this method of shaving, be sure to really \\&quot;whisk\\&quot; the soap in your shaving mug.  Slowly count to 75 or so while whisking the material and you will get a great foam.  If you stop after only 20-30 seconds, it looks good, but it is not thick and rich.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is a very good product, but I do not like the smell as well as it appears that some do.  I find it a little strong and is too \\&quot;classic\\&quot; for me.  That is the reason for taking off one star, and it is certainly just my preference.  I will use all of the product and may order this supplier again, but will try a different fragrance.  I would not hesitate to recommend this to others.</li>
    <li> If your just looking for a mug soap I suggest you buy the cheap one at the grocery store--it is as good as this one.  Supposed to be bay rum but neither my girl friend or I can smell any scent to it.  We both like the smell of bay rum and you will not get it here!</li>
    <li> This soap is great. The smell is very classy, but it&#x27;s not overly pungent. The lather is good, too. It just requires working with a badger brush for a moment or two. I&#x27;ll definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> I tried this soap because I had seen other reviews on web sites saying how most people liked it and plus I wanted to know what Bay Rum smelled like. :)  Well I have to say this soap lathers very well with badger bush and the Bay Rum scent is pleasing, not too strong and doesn&#x27;t linger.  Would buy again.</li>
    <li> I purchased this after reading some good reviews on here and other shaving forums.  All i got to say is this is one of the best shaving soap I have tried..  read other people reviews here too. They all cant be wrong.  truly deserve 5 stars     would buy this product again and again</li>
    <li> This is a great shaving soap that creates a good amount of lather and does not overpower you with the bay rum scent.</li>
    <li> The scent is nice but does not last. I do not think this product is any better than Williams Mug shaving soap. Col Conk is 2 to 3 times the money. If you can do without the bay rum scent, buy Williams and save yourself some money.</li>
    <li> I dropped this in an old coffee cup and when taking a shower I let the water heat up to max and fill the cup with HOT water and set it aside with my razor stuck in cup also. I wait a bit and then dump the water and beat the soap with the brush to make lather. I get great shaves even with a four day beard (I&#x27;m retired) I recommend it.</li>
    <li> This shave soap has just the right amount of bay rum scent for me. It also gives a good shave that is on par with Van Der Hagen Deluxe (the only other soap I have tried). I recommend it.</li>
    <li> About 3 years ago I started shaving using the boar bristle brush and shave soap.  This was the first soap I purchased.  I&#x27;ve never been disappointed with this product, not only does it smell really nice, but the soap goes on really nice.  I&#x27;ve tried some other brands of shave soap and they&#x27;ve dried out my skin or leave a residue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Col Conk Bay Rum shave soap comes with a HIGH recommendation from me, OH and its cheap which I really like.</li>
    <li> Col. Conk Bay Rum Glycerine soap may be my favorite shave soap. It builds a great lather, has a classic aroma, and one puck lasts for months. I use this in a rotation that I alternate with a tub of Proraso shave cream. I&#x27;ve used many Col Conk products and have been extremely satisfied with all of them.</li>
    <li> I got a puck of the Bay Rum to fill out an order (to get free shipping).  This soap reminds me of Van der Hagen right down to the packaging.  Seems to work OK, nothing special.  But I&#x27;m a sucker for the overprices British creams so consider this review wit that in mind.  I&#x27;m using this soap more to break in a couple brushes instead of shaving with it.  For newer wet shavers and those on a budget, it&#x27;s worth trying but I think I prefer VdH Deluxe and Glycerin better and they&#x27;re less expensive to boot.</li>
    <li> Lathers nice,smells great,smooth shave. Good price for a fine product. The Colonel delivers a fine bar of soap at a good price.</li>
    <li> Got this for Christmas as I wanted to go back to a shaving brush. Decided to start here on a cost vs good reviews basis. Very good but the Bay Rum isn&#x27;t very strong, wish it was a little stronger. Otherwise, I love it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used an electric razor purely for convenience for many years. It was quick, clean, and got the job done. Many years ago, I had used a Gillette double-edged safety razor and blades, the adjustable type. Back then, I had a heavy beard and sensitive skin and usually wound up sliced-and-diced. That&#x27;s why I went to the electric.  After watching some videos on Youtube and reading the reviews here, I decided to give wet shaving another shot. I bought the Merkur long-handled razor, Col. Conks Bay Rum Glycerine Shave Soap, a decent brush, and some Feather blades. It really was an eye-opening experience for me. Let me say that there is a learning curve to get the hang of everything and growing accustomed to your tools. It will take practice, but there is a definite payoff.  For me, the trick to getting a good lather is not using too much water in the brush and whipping it up good on my face. Scrub fast in tight circles and you&#x27;ll work up a very good lather. The air in my house is very dry, so I usually lather just one side of my face at a time to shave. Then I do the other half. The soap is glycerine based and leaves a nice slick coating on your skin that lets the razor glide across your skin. I re-lather sections of my face before each pass. When I think I&#x27;m done, I wet my face with a wash-cloth and check for spots I may have missed. The soap leaves a very slick coating on my face that lets me get any stray hairs or patches without any discomfort or burn.  In fact, that is one of the major selling points for me. I can wipe the foam off with a wet cloth and still shave very comfortably with just the glycerine residue on my face. After my shave, I rinse my face thoroughly with warm water, then very cold water to close up the skin pores. Even if I nick myself, it doesn&#x27;t hurt or burn for days. I get a very close, comfortable shave with this soap and highly recommend it. I plan to try the Lime next.</li>
    <li> This is a great soap. It has a great smell that is not over powering. I only wish the scent would last longer.   The soap is easy to work into a perfect lather to shave with. It does not dry out my skin, it leaves it feeling great. I will never use the canned cream again! I only wish I had this stuff when I was on active duty!</li>
    <li> This is the first time I&#x27;ve purchased this and I found it to be terrific. I&#x27;ve been using Probaso which comes in a tube and always enjoy it and never thought anything else would compare. Col. Conk products seem to get very good reviews by the shave blogs and I tried it on a whim and I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
    <li> Why you can buy BayRum candles I don&#x27;t know.  This soap also leaves your face moisturized and feeling soft.</li>
    <li> Good shaving soap. I&#x27;ve been using shaving soap and brush almost my entire adult shaving life and used a lot of different brands.  Given how hard it has become to actually find shaving soap (even in a big city), finding shaving soap that I also like is a good deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This soap creates a nice lather without a strong scent, doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin and seems to last a reasonable amount of time. My only complaint is that my shaving mug is an &amp;#34;Old Spice&amp;#34; mug (yes, I bought it new, it&#x27;s now an antique) and all the soaps that I can find now-a-days are much smaller than my mug. Including this one. If I ever find a soap that fits properly in my mug, I&#x27;ll give it five stars. And stock up on the brand in case it get&#x27;s discontinued.</li>
    <li> I got the bay rum flavor. It smells like the Indian Ice Cream Kulfi-Malai, when I smell the soap itself, do not smell it while or after shaving. I think the $2 soap at Walmart lathers as good as this. The smell is always a personal preference. I like strong smell, if you like mild smell this soap is for you.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a gift for my husband and he really likes it.  Like most men, mine has to shave every day!  It&#x27;s cheap and lasts a long time (varies per person), before you have to buy another bar- from what my husband says.  They have other flavors but this one was pleasant smelling.</li>
    <li> This was the first bar of bay rum shaving soap that I had purchased and while I have been happy with other scents of Col Conk shaving soaps, I think I&#x27;ll stick with the bay rum scent going forward. It has a good lather and a pleasant smell when applied.     There is also something wonderfully nostalgic about brushing it on then scraping it off with a nice, old safety razor. It allows me a few morning moments of reprieve from the technological, complicated society we live in to be transported back to a Norman Rockwellesque vision of what life must have been like when my grandfather was my age.</li>
    <li> For a basic glycerine shaving soap, it&#x27;s alright, but I have a few gripes. First of all, I&#x27;m not sure about the other reviewers, but this definitely makes my skin feel taut afterwards.... and I hate the feeling of tight skin after a shave. Second, while Bay Rum is an OK scent, I wouldn&#x27;t say I like it. Granted, this might just be personal taste.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, it&#x27;s so-so in my book.</li>
    <li> The only good thing I can tell about this product is that the lather it produces smells nice.    I know I shouldn&#x27;t be expecting so much from a product that&#x27;s priced as low as this, but I can buy a tube of Gillette or some other shaving cream in the store that can produce much more lather and is good on the skin.    This one just robs the moisture off the skin and I won&#x27;t recommend this to anyone.</li>
    <li> I have tried several different shaving soaps over the past few months including this one. I read the positive reviews and I wanted this shaving soap to be just as good as described by others, but this product just isn&#x27;t good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The positives is that the puck fit into my shaving mug. The \\&quot;Bay Rum\\&quot; scent is nowhere near overwhelming and I think is a bit weak, but it certainly is a plus for those who don&#x27;t want a stronger scent in their soaps. Another positive is that because this is a glycerin based shaving soap it left my skin feeling silky smooth. Now for what I didn&#x27;t like about this soap which caused me to toss it into the trash bin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Working up a lather with this soap isn&#x27;t even close to the best which are Tallow based shaving soaps like Tabac. It takes a little longer to work up the lather in a bowl, and once the lather is created it dries out way too fast. The only way I could work a lather for multiple shaving passes was to keep working my silvertip badger hair brush on top the soap puck itself and work the lather on my face. But wait! There&#x27;s more.... once the lather was worked up on my face it would fall flat and dry out towards the end of my shave, causing drag against the skin which in turn produces irritation, nicks, and cuts. So, I would wind up having to go back and recharge my brush and apply lather over where it dried out. The other shaving soaps I have purchased here on Amazon and tried (such as Proraso) do not dry out nearly as fast as Col. Conk. This soap is not creamy, it does not glide all that well, and it caused me a good amount of irritation. I will never use this product again. I had my last shave with Col. Conk Bay Rum this morning and have consistently bad shaves when using this product. Never again!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My other soaps work great. Even my Dove bar soap works better than this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am sure some are getting good shaves from this product, but I am not one of them. There are FAR better shave soaps available to me so I am not going to waste my time with an underwhelming and under-performing product such as this one.</li>
    <li> I was greatly looking forward to trying this soap given that it is Bay Rum - one of my favorite scents.  I was hoping that it would be at least as pleasant to use as the [[ASIN:B001A3DNY6 Van Der Hagen Deluxe Shave Soap]] that is my daily go-to mug soap.  I didn&#x27;t expect it to be at the amazing level of luxury, such as [[ASIN:B000H72BWQ Kiehl&#x27;s Men&#x27;s Skincare - Close-Shavers]].  It isn&#x27;t bad, but it isn&#x27;t great either.  The secret to getting a good lather from this soap is to let it soak in some hot water right before you attempt to whip up some cream.  Although this creates a good cream, it still tends to dry out rather fast.  I am adjusting my rating from 1 to 3 stars.  PROS:  Pleasant, mild Bay Rum scent  CONS:    Likely to dry out while shaving, making for an unpleasant end of shave and less than close shave    High price point that delivers a mediocre performance</li>
    <li> I like this fine. I prefer it to the simple stuff I&#x27;ve seen at the store.  It has a pleasing fragrance that&#x27;s not too strong, and won&#x27;t linger. I do think there are better lubricating soaps out there, but not for the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a great one to try becasue it&#x27;s affordable.&lt;br /&gt;4 stars for price/performance.</li>
    <li> I was using the Van der Hagen stuff from walmart which to me smelled like Avon&#x27;s skin so soft, blah. I switched to this and it&#x27;s fantastic. It smells great, lathers good and doesn&#x27;t dry me out.</li>
    <li> I just love this stuff!  Cheap as dirt, makes a great lather, and smells wonderful!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a small ceramic grapefruit bowl that I melt this into for ease of use.  I just put the soap in the bowl and place in microwave.  Usually about 15 seconds or a little longer will do it.  (Don&#x27;t overcook or you&#x27;ll drive off too much of the scent).  When the soap has just melted, stop the microwave AND LEAVE IT ALONE!!  Just let it set for a few hours until it cools; if you take it out right away it will slosh around.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I&#x27;m ready to use I put a little hot water on the soap while I wet my face and run my shaving water.  Dump the water into my mixing bowl, load up my brush, and go the the mixing bowl to work up a lather.  This is really great soap!</li>
    <li> Smells fantastic, lathers with ease, and makes for a smooth clean shaving experience (with a DE at least).  Will definitely be buying again (and again).</li>
    <li> This shaving soap lathers up well with a great aroma of an old time barber shop. It has glycerine in it which gives a good wet and slick feeling shave. I would recommend this to another person.</li>
    <li> -Great gift for a guy! Stocking stuffer idea!    -Great lather properties (I was told by the gifted guy).    -Great scent! Not too strong but smells delicious and sexy!    -Perfect to go with a Tweezerman Brush I bought. Just place in a shaving mug and go!    -Good delivery by Amazon</li>
    <li> Great for the price and lasts forever.  I&#x27;ve been using the same puck for almost a year and still have some to go.  I&#x27;d say I average 4 shaves a week with this soap.  This soap lathers well on your face (I dislike using a cup).</li>
    <li> I have been using this shaving soap for the past couple of weeks. It lathers well, which is hard to find, and the fragrance is not too strong. I get a nice smooth clean shave with no residue. Recommend highly, and will purchase again.</li>
    <li> I love this soap. I use it with Neutrogena skin clearing shave cream, and it works, lathers and smells great. Doesn&#x27;t dry my skin out nearly as much as other soaps I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
    <li> The scent is nice and not overpowering at all. It&#x27;s pretty easy to make a lather with as well. I wouldn&#x27;t mind trying the Colonel again in a different scent.</li>
    <li> Lather is ok with this stuff, nothing special but really beats goo in a can. The Bay Rum scent is awful. The scent is very medicinal and one dimensional. This soap about turned me off to Bay Rum but luckily I tried Captains Choice aftershave which is awesome.</li>
    <li> Ordered this shaving soap after reading the reviews. I think the reviews rated this better than the product actually performed. There are other soaps that perform much better (albeit at a higher price). All in all a good soap.</li>
    <li> A bit spendy, but works well. I like the fragrance. Shaving soap is getting hard to find in stores and I am happy with this purchase. It arrived promptly with no problems.</li>
    <li> This soap produces a good lather without being too much.  It gives a smooth shave and leaves my face feeling good.  It also smells very good.</li>
    <li> I really dig this shave soap for a few reasons. First, it&#x27;s hard for me to find shave products with scents that don&#x27;t make me feel in my 70s. I want to be able to have a good shave without having to smell sandlewood on my face all day. The bay rum is a nice, masculine scent, and mild enough that it doesn&#x27;t interfere with other scents I&#x27;m wearing. The soap lathers well, the shave is slippy enough (both qualities are better than certain creams I&#x27;ve used) and so far it&#x27;s lasting a fairly long time. My only qualm with this product is that I really like the feel of a cream or a triple-milled Italian soap better than glycerine, but since I know that just comes down to preference it&#x27;s not enough to take off a star. Great shave, great soap.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t had a chance to put it to use yet (working with another cake of soap atm), but I love the smell of this stuff and can&#x27;t wait to try it out. Maybe I ought to get another bowl for this stuff...</li>
    <li> I bought this for my boyfriend when he decided to try out the soap/badger brush shave. At the time I was pretty clueless, but managed to get lucky with this one. We both like the smell, but its more expensive than the generic shave soap found at Wal-Mart so he rotates between the two but definitely likes this brand best. It seems to last a little longer than the cheap stuff.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried a number of shaving soaps.  Col. Conk is a popular brand that features a very friendly price.  It&#x27;s spiked with avocado oil and vitamin E to help nurture the skin and is manufactured with glycerin for added lubricity.  An additional feature of this soap for me was the size.  It fit perfectly in my shaving cup.  Not all are sized 2-1/2\\&quot; in diameter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While I&#x27;ve used worse soaps than Col. Conk, I found it actually dried my skin after use and also dried faster on my face than other soaps I&#x27;ve used.  For this reason, I haven&#x27;t returned to it.  I think this falls under the category of what soap works well for your skin type?  For me, this soap caused dryness and itching the following day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve since discovered Taylor of Old Bond Street (ToOBS) lavender soap.  This soap works very well with my skin and has a fantastic scent that is mild, yet lingers longer than Col. Conk.  It is more expensive, but I find it lasts longer.  Col. Conk lathers up well, but doesn&#x27;t last as long.  ToOBS is larger in diameter, so I have to whittle it down.  I get at least twice as many shaves out of ToOBS than Col. Conk.  At $14 a cake as opposed to ~$7 for Col. Conk, I find ToOBS to be a comparable deal in terms of length of use.  Also, ToOBS doesn&#x27;t dry out on my face as quickly as Col. Conk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not steering people away from Col. Conk, but just reporting my experience.  It&#x27;s something to keep in mind when you try it.  Hopefully it works better for you than it did for me.</li>
    <li> My wife loves the fragrance of this soap. I like the feel of the soap on my face, no skin irritation, a problem I have always had. Would highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Colonel Ichabod Conk makes a really nice shaving soap.  The small puck fits well into almost any shaving bowl (or just leave it in the plastic bowl it comes in) and the bay rum smell is pleasing in a subtly spicy Captain Morgan&#x27;s kind of way.  One of the things I really like about this soap is that it smells nice during your shave but the bay rum scent does not last too long afterward on your face.  This glycerine based soap&#x27;s lather is excellent when you find the right soap/water ratio, although I recommend a brush for lathering and overall shaving comfort.  Overall this soap is inexpensive, of decent quality and shaves well.  I give the Conk a solid 4 stars for quality, price, shave comfort and scent variety.  TOBS is my all time favorite, but the Conk deserves an honorable mention and will fit nicely into your shave rotation for not much money.</li>
    <li> This shaving soap produces a relatively thin foam that is barely acceptable. The bay rum scent is overly mild and not long lasting.</li>
    <li> I really don&#x27;t like this. I bought it because it was cheap but learned my lesson. The razor doesn&#x27;t glide very smoothly over my face leaving a razor burn. I am going to go back to using the Van Der Hagen brand</li>
    <li> The smell is one I remember from years ago at the barber shop and still enjoy to this day. I replaced the soap that came with my shaving kit and I&#x27;m very pleased with the lather, the smoothness and of course as stated the aroma. Much better than the soap that I originally received and the one purchased at my local drug store.</li>
    <li> Col. Conk Bay Rum Glycerine Shave Soap-great scent, smooth on the face, easy lather, and easy clean up. Great purchase!</li>
    <li> This bay rum glycerine shave soap behaves more or less similarly to other Col. Conk shave soaps, except that it has a light pleasing bay rum scent.  If you haven&#x27;t used these soaps before, you may find it difficult to attain a good lather, but once you have got the appropriate moisture content figured out you shoud have no problems producing a nice thick lather.  Depending on how often you shave (I shave 3-4 times a week) the soap should last for months, too, so it&#x27;s a pretty good budget alternative to some of the pricier creams that are available.</li>
    <li> I store the shave soap in it&#x27;s packaging, and take it out to rub over my face. It foams best when I have a decent amount of stubble. Overall it&#x27;s a pretty solid product that makes old school shaving easy.</li>
    <li> So far my favorite shave soap I have tried.  Great smell and great lather.  Really enjoy how easy it is to use and the price.</li>
    <li> I guess I am being too picky but I cannot overcome the smell of this soap, therefore the performance of it doesn&#x27;t really matter.  I shaved with it once and It performed lathered well, better than other soaps I have used - but I threw it away after 1st use because the smell is just not my style.</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re looking at this product you&#x27;re probably interested in getting into DE shaving. If you are then you can&#x27;t go wrong with this classic shave soap. Col. Conks&#x27; Bay Rum is an absolutely amazing scent and my fiance highly compliments it. The soap lathers up easily and loads into my brush very easily as well. I&#x27;ve tried several soaps/creams, this will constantly remain in my shaving arsenal.</li>
    <li> THIS IS THE ONLY WAY TO SHAVE..I CAN GO 2 or 3 DAYS AND MY BEARD JUST GOES AWAY NO DRAGGING OR PULLING THE RAZOR JUST GLIDES &amp; CUTS LIKE THE BEARD WASN&#x27;T EVEN THERE...</li>
    <li> Good smell and lather.</li>
    <li> love it and great service.</li>
    <li> Col. Conk&#x27;s soap gets a lot of love on wet shaving forums but I find that the lather really underperforms even in comparison to much cheaper products.</li>
    <li> I think I will be getting this soap as long as I live. Smell is addictive and it produces great lather. I&#x27;m getting 2 pucks and nuke them together so I have a bigger area to later with. The super sized puck of BR is hard to find.</li>
    <li> I buy this for stocking stuffers fro the men in my family who like the west shave experience.  It seems they prefer this brand and glycerine soap for lather, the gentleness to their skin and the smell. I like it for the name, I mean, come on, Col. Conk Bay Rum?  That conjures all kinds of images!  :)</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s inexpensive. It&#x27;s refreshing. It lathers well. After using it for a year, I can&#x27;t imagine justifying the expense behind using a more expensive shaving soap. (In my opinion, anything more would be a vanity purchase; this is the gold standard.)</li>
    <li> This soap is very easy to make in the container and I love that you don&#x27;t have to use the cup it gives a great scent and dies a great job for protection from cuts it&#x27;s a decent price for the product it&#x27;s probably not the best soap but it&#x27;s worth the money and will help with a lot of great shaves</li>
    <li> i love this soap. i have a scuttle that i use to fill up with hot water, to heat up the soap, while i take a shower. it lathers very well and the razor glides over your skin smoothely. it has just a hint of bay rum. and the aroma is realy pleasant. i highly recomend this soap, or any other col. conk soap. buy it, you wont be disappointed.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been sampling different soaps and this one leaves me wanting. It doesn&#x27;t produce a rich lather like some of the other soaps I&#x27;ve tried. Perhaps that&#x27;s the glycerine. I&#x27;m not an expert, and this such a subjective preference, but I know what I like. My hunch is this soap will sit in the cupboard as an emergency back-up.</li>
    <li> What can I really say? It&#x27;s shaving soap. It smells like bay rum. I like the smell personally, and I was actually a little surprised to find out that my wife actually likes it too. I&#x27;m new to shaving with this stuff... I&#x27;d been using canned stuff forever before, and disposable razors. I stepped back in time and stepped up my game, and I&#x27;m using a double edged safety razor (a Merkur) and a badger brush. I got a kit on here that came with a stand to hold the brush and razor, but that&#x27;s another story. Back to the soap... Compared to shaving cream, it&#x27;s a world of difference. Assuming my face is good and wet, it helps the razor glide very smoothly across my face. I noticed another reviewer or two had mentioned it made his skin feel tight afterwards... I have to agree, but I&#x27;m not really bothered by it personally. I&#x27;m not giving it 5-stars simply because while I do like the smell, I&#x27;m not 100% in love with it... I figure I&#x27;ll try out some others, but I&#x27;d definitely keep this on my list of keepers.</li>
    <li> Love this shave soap.  Does not irritate my skin or leave any kind of markings.  I used to use a mach 3 and barbosol.  I always would get this one patch on my left check, right below the jaw line...kind of an irritation mark.  However, after shaving with this soap and this method for several months, it has steadily got better and now does not occur.  Everyone should be shaving this way.  Some initial cost in setup, but then CHEAP CHEAP CHEAP!!</li>
    <li> Good foam and nice scent.</li>
    <li> It makes a good lather.. Seems to last long too... I am not even halfway through and I forget when I bought it .  Mild if any odor/smell to it</li>
    <li> I love Colonel Conk&#x27;s Bay rum shave soap! This is my favorite scent of the conk soaps. It lathers up nicely, and the price is great for traditional shave soaps. Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> Not bad, but inferior to Truefitt &amp; Hill Shave Cream.</li>
    <li> I just started shaving with a DE razor about 1.5 years ago.  At the time which I purchased my handle and blades I also picked up two tubs of Taylor of Old Bond St.  I only shave every other to third day and these two soaps lasted me for that time.  While I am DE shaving for the long haul so to speak, I kept thinking that while my issues with razor burn were better, they still weren&#x27;t great.  My heritage is a blend of Northern European, Mexican, and large part mongrel.  I seem to grow at least 00 steel wool from baby-butt fair skin.  Prior to taking up DE shaving, the corners of my mouth and neck were a constant bloody, irritated mess!  Running low on shave soap I read a few reviews and decided to try out a hard soap and to go American.  My two picks were Van Der Hagen and Col. Conks.  The Van Der Hagen arrived first and so was first up.  After using it for two weeks i was impressed.  For me, this was a far better product than the Taylor&#x27;s ever was.    When rummaging through a kitchen cupboard I came across a coffee mug made by my son for me when he was six and in kindergarten.  It is just perfect in size and depth for a cake of shaving soap and the Col. Conks was loaded up for use.  My first shave with the Col. was an epiphany!! I got the closest, smoothest, DE shave that I have EVER gotten, and with a blade that had three prior shaves on that edge!  I was absolutely amazed at how soft and smooth my face felt.  There was no irritation.  There was no razor-burn. No nicks.  And the only thing different was the Col. Conks.  Since then I tried the Van Der Hagen once more, and yes there was a difference, and it was retired to the waste basket.  For me, Col. Conks has been a great discovery which I am very happy with.  I can honestly say that for my tough, tough beard, I have never used anything that works as well!</li>
    <li> it has a good smell, nothing overpowering and my girlfriend loves it. I swapped from cheap walgreans stuff and I like how this feels. it&#x27;ll take a bit to get the lather right but it could also be because I switched my cup I use, or because it&#x27;s a different soap. Either way, I like it and like i said, it makes me smell like a man!</li>
    <li> The shaving soap is \\&quot;ok\\&quot; at best, part of the experience of old fashion shaving is the aromatic experience and the aroma of the soap died within days - I would suggest the seller loose this product from their inventory.</li>
    <li> For the price, it&#x27;s pretty good shave soap. It smells good and leaves his skin all silky smooth. The bay rum is nice.</li>
    <li> This was my first dive into DE shaving.  The smell of the soap is pleasant but not overwhelming.  I would definitely recommend it for someone starting out.  My next purchase will be the Proraso/CO Bigelow shaving cream.  The tough thing about this whole shaving experience is that its hard to pin down what is working and what isn&#x27;t.  Between the soap/lather, the razor, the brush, etc. you have to play with all the different variations and techniques before you find what is perfect for you.</li>
    <li> Excellent lather. Very slippery and gives a nice shave. Scent is classic and &amp;#34;Manly&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s okay. Bay rum fragrance very subtle. Very ! Fits nicely in my shave mug, whips great. Works fine. But I would spend a little more money and buy Proraso shave cream in a tube over this. But if you like an old school mug with a cake in it to whip up up is okay but other brands would do well too. The Bay Rum thing is marginal. If your into subtle and not bold, it might be okay. It&#x27;s easy on the wallet too.</li>
    <li> Great smell but the lather leaves much to be desired. I would buy again but you really gotta work to get a proper lather.</li>
    <li> I was hoping for a similar product to Burt Bee&#x27;s shave soap.  This doesn&#x27;t even come close.  If you are looking for heavy lather, strong Bay Rum frag. this is not for you.  Mild frag. and I felt razor drag.  I will not buy again.</li>
    <li> I bought this soap when I started wet shaving with a double edge razor. It has a nice smell that isn’t overwhelming. The only downside that I’ve noticed is that the lather is a little thin, but this could be due to the quality of my brush. It seems other reviewers appear to be having no trouble with lather.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before buying this soap I used one from a local drugstore. It was only a couple of bucks, but had an old school aftershave type of smell which was pretty powerful and stuck around longer. I prefer Col. Conk Bay Rum scent over that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It’s good for the price and I would buy it again. Four stars only because of my lather issue.</li>
    <li> They actually sent me the &#x27;Almond&#x27; scent instead of the &#x27;Bay Rum,&#x27; but the soap itself lathers up nicely and provides a good shave.</li>
    <li> Smell isn&#x27;t overpowering and allows the razor to glide smoothly. Will order more in different fragrance.</li>
    <li> Like other women out there, I&#x27;d heard many men tout the luxury of shaving the \\&quot;old-fashioned\\&quot; way, and wanted to give it a go myself.  I started out with just a basic set, the [[ASIN:B001A3HPT0 Van Der Hagen Premium Shave Set]], to see if the whole brush and soap shaving experience was for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this soap as I wasn&#x27;t particularly keen on the scent of the soap sold with the Van Der Hagen kit mentioned above, and I remembered my Puerto Rican father always splashing bay rum on his face after a shave.  The scent of this soap is wonderful, and brought back memories of sitting in the bathroom with my dad watching him shave.  It has a lovely spice scent, with slight hints of cinnamon and lime, but the wonderful clove smell is what is most prominent.  This does NOT leave a heady scent with your skin after you shave, but rather a nice light and airy essence, and not too overtly masculine.  That being said, I tend to use men&#x27;s products overall as they produce better results for me (and I hate smelling like frilly flowers or food), so ladies, you may want to consider the Almond scent of Col. Conk&#x27;s soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the lather, I&#x27;ve used this with a pure badger brush and a boar brush, and have had good results with both.  It lathers nicely whether you prefer a bowl-lather or a face-lather (or in my case, leg-lather) technique, but be sure you&#x27;re adjusting your water/soap ratios accordingly.  I was able to produce a fluffy yet thick lather with all tools and techniques listed above, and the soap provided a wonderfully slick shave.  The lather does dry out a bit if you leave it too long; men probably won&#x27;t encounter this issue much, as I encountered this by lathering too large of an area that I could shave efficiently before the lather began to dry out.  A few drops of water and swirling that into the existing lather on my leg fixed the issue nicely though, and I was back in business.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not really sure if this helped moisturize my skin at all, but I definitely did not feel any pulling of my skin after my shave, nor did I experience any tugging on the razor, which was a major improvement for me.  I&#x27;m not sure if it was the soap or simply my technique improving though, but this soap gave me the closest shave I&#x27;ve ever had, although not quite BBS.</li>
    <li> over all my favorite scent of shaving soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Col. Conk soap has just the right amount of lather to it for a good coverage and shaving experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are a \\&quot;wet shave\\&quot; type, their products do not disappoint.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;shave everyday and you&#x27;ll always feel keen!\\&quot;</li>
    <li> This is my favorite Add-On item at Amazon. If I could find it locally that would be great but as the closest place to buy it is an hour away. I always have a backup.</li>
    <li> This was the first time trying Col. Conk shave cream.I liked that it seemed a product with good ingredients like avocado oil and vitamin E.Bay rum can be a very pleasing and bracing scent.Unfortunately,it was too subtle.It did not lather up as much as I would have liked and dried quickly.Although a fairly good shave was achieved I would have preferred softer and moister feeling skin.However,it is very reasonably price.</li>
    <li> didn&#x27;t really like the scent but that is just me. Col Conk is a great product though.</li>
    <li> I have just made the leap to wet shaving, and of the Conk soaps I have tried (Lime, Amber, Bay Rum), this is far and above my favorite one.&lt;br /&gt;It has a solid, smooth later that seems to have better staying power on the face, at least on mine. And, it&#x27;s got a scent that smells great, but not overpowering, that brings back memories of my granddad.&lt;br /&gt;I rotate through my soaps pretty regularly, but the Bay Rum is the one I go to most often. It&#x27;s reliable and provides a great shave.</li>
    <li> The scent and lather are just right. Not too much, not too little. I highly recommend this shaving soap! Keep it up Col. Conk!</li>
    <li> Best smelling Shave soap I&#x27;ve ever used. All of the Conk Soaps are great, but this one is my favorite. Great Bay rum scent but not too strong. If they made this in a Bath soap I&#x27;d definitely use it.</li>
    <li> I have a fairly sensitive face for safety razor shaving and this soap has been my go to since I started safety shaving last July.  It never fails.  I&#x27;ve tried other shave soaps and this is the one I will always have around.</li>
    <li> I like this product. It has a pleasant smell, makes a great lather, rinses clean, and lasts a long time. So far, I like all of Col. Conk shave soap.</li>
    <li> Product arrived on time. This shaving soap proved to be a quality product and good value. I would use this product in the future.</li>
    <li> I personally did not find this soap that great didn&#x27;t lather that well and skin felt dry after shaving only tried once did have a pleasant scent to it.</li>
    <li> Not sure what the hype about Col Conk is about!&lt;br /&gt;This shave soap is OK.&lt;br /&gt;I do get a bit dry skin after shaving with this.&lt;br /&gt;The soap I liked the best is Van Der Hagen.&lt;br /&gt;If you want an ultra moisturizing shave, use VDH.</li>
    <li> Awesome scent of Bay rum and lather up nicely using my proraso boar bristle brush. Goes well and lasts long.</li>
    <li> I really love the scent.  It lasts a pretty long time too.</li>
    <li> This was my first Col. Conk shave soap and it did not disappoint! Very slick and loads on my brush very easily. The smell is light and doesn&#x27;t linger much. Bay Rum is a classic scent and definitely one you should add to your shave den.</li>
    <li> I bought a bar of this shave soap back in the early part of December and I&#x27;m STILL using the same bar in July!  I love the smell and the lather seems pretty good (I just started using a shaving brush 7 months ago and this is the first and only shave bar I&#x27;ve used so far).  I think I get a much better shave with this than I ever got with canned foam; I can even shave against the grain without any irritation or razor burn, something I could never do before.</li>
    <li> Truly a great product! Lathers easily, producing a thick, rich product. And it smells great! At this price there is no reason not to buy this product!</li>
    <li> Soap arrived on time with a Shaving Set. I&#x27;m very happy with this item and would recommend this Shaving Soap to others.</li>
    <li> Good for a cheap but reasonable shave. If you want to keep it cheap, give this soap a try. I moved on to Taylor shaving cream now which gives me less cuts, but every face is different so you should try out this soap and see if it&#x27;s right for you</li>
    <li> I have tried many different shaving soaps from commercial brands sold at drug stores to soaps only  available at speciality stores or mail order ( this product purchased from Amazon) . This soap gives you a very thick, wet and warm lather.  This is one of the best I have found.</li>
    <li> This was only my second shaving soap purchase and off been quite pleased with it.  Definitely and upgrade from what came with the shaving kit I had originally purchased when I got into shaving with a straight razor.  Tue bay rim scent doesn&#x27;t compare to Clubmans aftershave, but the scent is light and pleasant enough.</li>
    <li> Bay Rum is a traditional and manly scent and the glycerine soap is a fine medium.  Col. Conk shave soap whips up into a fine lather and the result is all that anyone could want in a great shave.</li>
    <li> I recently switched to traditional wetshaving with a badger hair brush and DE safety razor. I got some Col Conks Bay rum soap first and gave it a shot because a friend recommended it. I wasn&#x27;t all that impressed with the lather. It doesn&#x27;t seem very thick or slick. So I did some reading of reviews for other products and decided to try the famed Italian brand Proraso shave cream (in the toothpaste-like tube), which seems to get a lot of rave reviews. I started \\&quot;superlathering\\&quot; with Col Conks and Proraso together and it was decent. Then I was told I was using Proraso wrong and you have to let it sit on your face for 2 minutes before shaving so it softens the beard. After making that change and using just Proraso, I have to say Proraso is a much better product. The lather is thicker and, more importantly, slicker on your face, providing a nice protective layer. It&#x27;s much more invigorating with the menthol and Eucalyptus oil, leaves my face feeling nice afterward, and I get a shave with much less irritation and nicks than with Col Conk. Proraso really softens your beard and makes for a great shave when you leave it on your face for two minutes after lathering it on with a badger brush. Also, it doesn&#x27;t take much Proraso to get a nice lather (pea to almond size amount squeezed out of tube). So it lasts a while. I&#x27;ve heard Proraso shave soap is great as well, but I haven&#x27;t tried it.</li>
    <li> Best of the best, my butt.  I bought this based on positive reviews, but this stuff sucks.  Go with Taylor of Old Bond Street Eton College.  It doesn&#x27;t get better than that.  This stuff is hard as a rock and takes forever to get going.  Once it does, it doesn&#x27;t lather.  It comes in this cheap clear plastic case, which you won&#x27;t want to use and you will want to use a wooden bowl.  If you by Taylor, you can just put a little water in the lid and use that as your bowl and then clean it afterward.  Sucks.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing, if you ever have shopped at Art of Shaving, you about to realize that their products are garbage. Col Conk is the real deal.</li>
    <li> I got this for the scent which there doesn&#x27;t seem to be any.  As a shave soap its not bad but I was looking for something with more of a scent.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll be honest. I had low expectations for this puck-type of hard shaving soap but was pleasantly surprised. I usually use the softer cream tubs. I figured I would have to work real hard to get a decent lather from this little soap puck. Instead, it made a very foamy lather with above average lubrication that made for a nice clean cut-free shave. I just keep it in a small mug and re-use with my brush whenever needed. My only complaint is that the smell can seem a bit \\&quot;cheap\\&quot; for lack of a friendlier word. But the scent is fairly light so it doesn&#x27;t stick around for too long. I will try some of their other flavors to find a scent I like better, but I will definitely buy this type of product again. Also worth mentioning, I sometimes travel and this is now my preferred shaving companion when traveling since it is so small and has the consistency of a bar of soap you don&#x27;t need to worry about airport security with liquids/gels.</li>
    <li> I bought this product on august 1rst 2011.  I just now needing to buy another cake of this very soap (yes that is how long it has lasted, today 09-23-2012),  I shave with a razor; straight or cartridge style, and I have found this to be the best soap thus far. I use a Williams white brush (wit a red base).  I use, I think, the same company&#x27;s soap bowl and it has lasted this long.  I think it is a great soap, you can see the glycerine droplets the first couple times you use the soap sitting on its top as it dries.&lt;br /&gt;this soap offers a smooth and clean shave with most all razors,  the lather can be tailored to your personal preference (I prefer a thick lather, so use little water).  The effect when done shaving is awesome, it smells nice but not to strong, and leaves a clean fresh feeling with out the burn.  Glycerine has a lubricating function and for me, has proven quite pleasant compared to other brands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just don&#x27;t use it with my new electric razor, but that is brand new to me (never owned or used one before),  so I am still figuring that out.</li>
    <li> Good lather; good shave.</li>
    <li> The difference between canned shaved gel and Col. Conk shave soap is Night &amp; Day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This soap makes a great lather and provides a smooth shave. It smells good and will last for a very long time.</li>
    <li> This soap smells good, gives a smooth shave, lathers up fairly easily.  Overall I wouldn&#x27;t hesitate to recommend it to someone looking for an introductory shaving soap.</li>
    <li> Gentle soap, and a slick foamy lather.  It&#x27;s very high quality for the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It seems to agree with my skin perfectly ... not drying and a great shave.</li>
    <li> Boyfriend likes it very much.&lt;br /&gt;Easy shaving, smooth skin, good smell.&lt;br /&gt;What else do you want.&lt;br /&gt;Will buy again!!!&lt;br /&gt;Love it</li>
    <li> I initially tried this soap the traditional way:  whip it up into a lather/foam, however, no matter how careful I was I experienced a lot of nicks (using a Edwin Jagger DE razor), especially in the throat area.  I then just used the soap on my a face as a &amp;#34;lube&amp;#34; - rubbed a nice slimy coat on my hands - then rubbed briskly on my face, and this works great (be sure to apply soap on face before each pass.)  Very close shave, nick free.  In addition, the avocado oil in the soap makes my face feel soft and supple with a slight sheen (non-oily.)  The scent is subtle, and tends to stay throughout the day.</li>
    <li> The Col Conk Bay Rum Shave Soap is great. It has a soothingaroma and makes me feel cleaner than regular bathroom soap.Will be ordering more in the near future.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you</li>
    <li> I will never use shaving cream or gel from a can again!! looking forward to buying more ASAP. you wont be disappointed.</li>
    <li> Great Shave soap for a great price.  The lather is not the best, but due to teh glycerine this soap has some very good slickness.  For the price I would definately reccomend people get this soap just to try it out.  Scent is not very strong, but it is a really nice scent.  If the scent was stronger or the lather was slightly better I would give this product 5 stars.  None the less this is a must try item for a wet shaver.</li>
    <li> Scent is great but the lather is only average.  Compared to soap that normally comes with a shave cup it&#x27;s good, but pales in comparison to Taylor or other high end soap.</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t thrilled with this soap. Maybe, it&#x27;s because I like bay rum and have used a genuine tropical bay rum aftershave for forty years. It didn&#x27;t smell like bay rum. It smelled more like a fruit cake at Christmas. Cinnamon, allspice, clove, orange peel, and several other scents combined give it a fair spicy smell, but definitely not bay rum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the soap&#x27;s shaving qualities, it performed as well as you would expect from a glycerine soap. Lather was mediocre, I could feel the razor pulling at the stubble because the soap just wasn&#x27;t able to soften my beard, and barely lubricated my face. If you&#x27;ve ever used a soap made from goat&#x27;s milk, the performance is identical. So, if you like the smell of fruit cake and the performance of milk soap you&#x27;ll be OK with this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought the soap knowing the shave would be rough because I knew the difference between glycerine and tallow soaps. There is no comparison in comfort between the two. But I was willing to give up comfort for the bay rum, and ended up with neither. But, these things are a personal matter and your mileage may vary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My final thought, you be disappointed if you&#x27;ve ever experienced genuine bay rum, or are used to the comfort of a good tallow soap.</li>
    <li> High quality shave soap with a great smell.</li>
    <li> This shaving soap is fantastic. I started using a straight razor about six months ago and this soap is very good for that purpose. It is not as good a product as a shaving creme; but it is an acceptable substitute.</li>
