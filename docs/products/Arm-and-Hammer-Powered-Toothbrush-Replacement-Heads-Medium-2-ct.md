<ol>
      <li>After Spinbrush got an excellent dental report.  </li>
      <li>Excellent product, I fully recommend it.</li>
      <li>Got the 4-pack, excellent quality not hard/stiff and not Crest as pictured.  </li>
      <li>Very good product.</li>
      <li>Great price, Excellent conditions</li>
      <li>It is a great replacement for the Arm &amp; Hammer spin brush.  </li>
      <li>These are great.  </li>
      <li>I was quite happy with my order.</li>
      <li>At age 33, that&#x27;s something to be proud of.</li>
      <li>These are great to have on hand.  </li>
      <li>These are great replacements.  </li>
      <li>Never had good reports at periodic 6 month cleanings.  </li>
      <li>Fit and functionality perfect.</li>
      <li>If you brush 3 times a day still good as the day you started using it</li>
      <li>It is good for teeth an gums.  </li>
      <li>I assumed 2ct (2 pack) meant 4 at $17 which is fair; however, that is not the case.</li>
      <li>Really good price..</li>
      <li>They fit perfectly on my Crest Spin Brush..  </li>
      <li>This product says it fits all electric rechargeable toothbrush including the one we own.</li>
      <li>I know I&#x27;ll continue using the product because it&#x27;s so effective.</li>
      <li>To prevent staining and discoloration of Invisalign, I&#x27;d mix 8 ounces of warm water</li>
      <li>What would be absolutely wonderful is if I could get some new plastic covers that come with the toothbrush.</li>
      <li>They are firmer and therefore they deliver a more effective cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
      <li>cheaper than Oral B and works fine!</li>
      <li>(it dissolves quicker and cleans better) with two tablespoons of Arm &amp; Hammer baking soda for about an hour.</li>
      <li>I expect all electric brushes would do but why pay more.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m glad they sell it here.</li>
      <li>Gums were healthy.</li>
      <li>What more is there to say?</li>
      <li>Love  this toothbrush.</li>
      <li>I love the Spinbrush</li>
      <li>i wish the store had more of these...</li>
      <li>Much better price than the stores.</li>
      <li>Clean with toothrbush, brush with A&amp;H toothpaste, replace and done!</li>
      <li>These work great, and I was able to order &amp;#34;medium&amp;#34; stiffness, which I like much better then the standard &amp;#34;soft&amp;#34;.</li>
      <li>If you have this system and like the brushes, then buy some, the shopping at Amazon is easy and painless.</li>
      <li>Still works fine tho..  </li>
      <li>These original heads are easy to remove and these heads are easy to insert.  </li>
      <li>NONE of the brushes fit</li>
      <li>I was really happy to find the larger size head.</li>
      <li>Somehow you twist it and it never sits comfortably on it.</li>
      <li>Invisalign braces remained free of stains.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>My last teeth cleaning went great.</li>
      <li>I received a total of 4 brushes, so I&#x27;m happy.  </li>
      <li>Great to have Amazon to sell these as NONE of my local stores</li>
      <li>It does a good job cleaning my teeth--much better than using a regular toothbrush.  </li>
      <li>BUT GOOD OLD AMAZON DID THE TRICK</li>
      <li>They fit well and seem to clean well.</li>
      <li>Replacement heads are made to fit for all SpinBrush Pro Select, Pro Recharge, Pro Clean and Pro Whitening brushes.</li>
      <li>It got to me quickly,  fits my electric toothbrush and works fine.  </li>
      <li>These are way more effective than the floppy Soft heads, which seem to be the only thing available in stores!</li>
      <li>the other hand, if you have sensitive teeth, these may not be the best for you.</li>
      <li>They last and are great and stay like new for twice a day brushing for the full 3 months.  </li>
      <li>the ad for the toothbrushes clearly stated the kind of Pro-clean tooth brush these replacements would fit and the packaging on the new electric element was listed-</li>
      <li>The Spinbrush pro is by far my favorite.</li>
      <li>Good price, delivered when expected and what was advertised.  </li>
      <li>Replacement heads are a bit pricy, but worth it.</li>
      <li>good stuff worked properly and it was the right one for my brush fast delivery</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a great product and very comparable to other brands on the market today.</li>
      <li>Works better than the reciprocating only style.</li>
      <li>Pretty durable.</li>
      <li>Totally love power toothbrushes and especially this Spin Brush.</li>
      <li>Exactly what we needed.</li>
      <li>and then you don&#x27;t have to run to the store and buy the whole toothbrush because they don&#x27;t always have replacement heads.</li>
      <li>The problem is always the same: the head does not quite fit the body.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t believe myself, if they didn&#x27;t return it fast ,I will make a police report....</li>
      <li>Dentists recommend that you replace the head every three months, this seems about right as far as usage goes.</li>
      <li>toothbrush helps remove tartar buildup that most other toothbrushes can&#x27;t remove.</li>
      <li>Med head is needed to get his teeth clean and Amazon was the only place I could find them.  </li>
      <li>I also credit that, along with white teeth (despite a deep love affair with Starbucks Coffee) to be from using Arm &amp; Hammer toothpaste.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend them.</li>
      <li>The replacements are pretty reasonably priced and they lose the blue color on the bristles when it is time to replace the brush.</li>
      <li>so I am now left with a new Arm &amp; Hammer unit and $50 worth of replacement brushes that do not work together-</li>
      <li>because it is definitely better than the small ones I had.</li>
      <li>Their quality is significantly better compared to other similar replacement heads I have purchased.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
      <li>Most people realize the multiple benefits of Arm &amp; Hammer, but when it comes to buying a toothbrush, I tend to be a little picky.</li>
      <li>I recently bought a new Arm&amp; Hammer electric toothbrush because I could not find replacement brushes for my older Pro-clean-</li>
      <li>only thing left to say is that I prefer the \\&quot;deep cleaning\\&quot; heads, which us available to purchase here also.</li>
      <li>but I got soft.</li>
      <li>I like using the dual action spin brush, and have bee doing so for over five years.  </li>
      <li>Couldn&#x27;t find any in Cedar Rapids that had bristles stiffer than soft.</li>
      <li>This replacemente works as the original: the round brush spins and the lower brush shakes.</li>
      <li>Does not fit the Arm &amp; Hammer Spinbrush SONIC Pro Clean, FYI.</li>
      <li>The medium brushes are better than soft and hard to find!</li>
      <li>only reason I gave this product four stars is because after looking high and low, I can&#x27;t find anything else but soft heads.</li>
      <li>Came well packed and so much sooner than expected.  </li>
      <li>Do not EVER want to go back to the old manual type.</li>
      <li>They provide a much deeper clean by adding a few longer bristles in the round tip of the bush&#x27;s head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>My teeth are a little larger, so it&#x27;s a tight fit in there!</li>
      <li>The only problem is that when I screw it on to bottom part it doesn&#x27;t exactly turn all the way, so it sits a little crooked.  </li>

    <li> Great price, Excellent conditions</li>
    <li> Very good product. I&#x27;m glad they sell it here. The medium brushes are better than soft and hard to find! Pretty durable.</li>
    <li> I like using the dual action spin brush, and have bee doing so for over five years.  The only problem that I encounter is that I am not able to purchase them locally.</li>
    <li> These are way more effective than the floppy Soft heads, which seem to be the only thing available in stores!</li>
    <li> I got a Spinbrush over a year ago and would recommend it to everyone.  It does a good job cleaning my teeth--much better than using a regular toothbrush.  The replacements are pretty reasonably priced and they lose the blue color on the bristles when it is time to replace the brush.</li>
    <li> I COULD NOT FIND THIS PRODUCT IN ANY STORE BUT GOOD OLD AMAZON DID THE TRICK</li>
    <li> I do not give the 5 starts for one simple reason: I have been buying Spinbrush for quite some time now and have run through two compete units. The problem is always the same: the head does not quite fit the body. Somehow you twist it and it never sits comfortably on it. So you have to use it slightly enhanced. Not a big problem but annoying. The brush is always looking away from me. This replacemente works as the original: the round brush spins and the lower brush shakes. Excellent product, I fully recommend it.</li>
    <li> I like a medium bristle and I have a difficult time finding the replacements.  I was quite happy with my order.</li>
    <li> These are hard to find around here, and they are not cheap knock off brushes that don&#x27;t work, these are actually the real deal made by Crest. Replacement heads are made to fit for all SpinBrush Pro Select, Pro Recharge, Pro Clean and Pro Whitening brushes. If you have this system and like the brushes, then buy some, the shopping at Amazon is easy and painless. Also... Dentists recommend that you replace the head every three months, this seems about right as far as usage goes.</li>
    <li> Never had good reports at periodic 6 month cleanings.  After Spinbrush got an excellent dental report.  I expect all electric brushes would do but why pay more.  Could not find replacement at Walmart where I purchased the brush but this vendor provided what I needed.</li>
    <li> Does not fit the Arm &amp; Hammer Spinbrush SONIC Pro Clean, FYI.</li>
    <li> Came well packed and so much sooner than expected.  They fit perfectly on my Crest Spin Brush..  Really good price..</li>
    <li> It got to me quickly,  fits my electric toothbrush and works fine.  What more is there to say? The end.</li>
    <li> I received a total of 4 brushes, so I&#x27;m happy.  The only problem is that when I screw it on to bottom part it doesn&#x27;t exactly turn all the way, so it sits a little crooked.  Still works fine tho..  The brush heads are so difficult to find anywhere!  Thank you Amazon!</li>
    <li> I love the Spinbrush I&#x27;ve been using one for years. I was really happy to find the larger size head. I gave 4 stars only because I thought i was getting &#x27;Medium&#x27; grade but I got soft. That&#x27;s O.k. because it is definitely better than the small ones I had. I did get 4, 2 packs of 2. What would be absolutely wonderful is if I could get some new plastic covers that come with the toothbrush. They tend to get a little cruddy and I don&#x27;t like my toothbrush to be without a cover. Also it takes some &#x27;muscles&#x27; to twist it into place. Don&#x27;t wimp out twist it!</li>
    <li> These work great, and I was able to order &amp;#34;medium&amp;#34; stiffness, which I like much better then the standard &amp;#34;soft&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> This product says it fits all electric rechargeable toothbrush including the one we own. However, no matter what we do, we can&#x27;t make the replacements line up, and the handle is difficult to hold.</li>
    <li> good stuff worked properly and it was the right one for my brush fast delivery i wish the store had more of these...</li>
    <li> They&#x27;re toothbrush heads. They do their job and didnt cost an arm and a leg. They fit well and seem to clean well.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a great product and very comparable to other brands on the market today. I would recommend it to others.</li>
    <li> It is a great replacement for the Arm &amp; Hammer spin brush.  It is good for teeth an gums.  I recommend it.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t find these in stores anymore.</li>
    <li> My last teeth cleaning went great. The dentist said no tarter buildup and the cleaning took half the time. He said he wished all patients would switch to the electric toothbrushes. Gums were healthy.</li>
    <li> what a difference using a battery operated toothbrush!! I can See it and Feel the Difference!!!</li>
    <li> I have been purchasing replacement heads at Wal-Mart but, I have been somehow disappointed of the poor quality of their replacement heads (both medium and soft) because they go \\&quot;flabby\\&quot; in just few uses.&lt;br /&gt;Looking around, I found these at Amazon. I purchased a couple and after testing them for a month, I noticed the following:&lt;br /&gt;- They are firmer and therefore they deliver a more effective cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;- Their quality is significantly better compared to other similar replacement heads I have purchased.&lt;br /&gt;- They seem to last longer.&lt;br /&gt;- The image in Amazon&#x27;s website is inaccurate; I have uploaded the actual image of the product.&lt;br /&gt;In the other hand, if you have sensitive teeth, these may not be the best for you. Personally I haven&#x27;t had any issues and, everybody at home including the kiddies are using them with no problems.&lt;br /&gt;Clean and squeaky-clean smiles for us all. Yup, this is one product I can recommend.</li>
    <li> I never can find &amp;#34;medium&amp;#34; heads on brushes in the drug or grocery store.  These original heads are easy to remove and these heads are easy to insert.  I highly recommend them.</li>
    <li> These are great replacements.  If you are doing what you are supposed to by replacing every 3 months These are great to have on hand.  They last and are great and stay like new for twice a day brushing for the full 3 months.  If you brush 3 times a day still good as the day you started using it and then you don&#x27;t have to run to the store and buy the whole toothbrush because they don&#x27;t always have replacement heads.</li>
    <li> The ad was a little misleading...I assumed 2ct (2 pack) meant 4 at $17 which is fair; however, that is not the case. It is 2 total for $17 which is way too expensive.</li>
    <li> Fit and functionality perfect.</li>
    <li> Love  this toothbrush.</li>
    <li> I was expecting 2 packages of 2 replacement heads. I rec&#x27;d 1 pkg of 2 replacement heads. I know I like the product just feel a little scammed. Please change the wording of this product. 2 replacement heads would be much clearer :-(</li>
    <li> Got the 4-pack, excellent quality not hard/stiff and not Crest as pictured.  Great to have Amazon to sell these as NONE of my local stores sell medium either!</li>
    <li> I received the toothbrush replacement and when I opened the bag I surprised that the package was opened and the brushes are dirty&lt;br /&gt;and used .....I don&#x27;t believe myself, if they didn&#x27;t return it fast ,I will make a police report....</li>
    <li> Medium firmness hard to find.</li>
    <li> You get two packs of two, four brush heads total.  Good price, delivered when expected and what was advertised.  Will be getting them again</li>
    <li> I have used the Spinbrush Pro for several years. I have had several rechargable electric toothbrushes. The Spinbrush pro is by far my favorite. Replacement heads are a bit pricy, but worth it.</li>
    <li> Exactly what we needed. Couldn&#x27;t find any in Cedar Rapids that had bristles stiffer than soft. Thank you.</li>
    <li> Works as expected. Have been using this product for 5 years.</li>
    <li> These are great.  Much better price than the stores.</li>
    <li> I use this brush for my disable spouse and is the only one I have found to work well for him.  Med head is needed to get his teeth clean and Amazon was the only place I could find them.  Med head was not available in the local store.</li>
    <li> I recently bought a new Arm&amp; Hammer electric toothbrush because I could not find replacement brushes for my older Pro-clean- the ad for the toothbrushes clearly stated the kind of Pro-clean tooth brush these replacements would fit and the packaging on the new electric element was listed- NONE of the brushes fit so I am now left with a new Arm &amp; Hammer unit and $50 worth of replacement brushes that do not work together- I am going to get rid of everything and find anther brand.  Why the company would continue to sell electric units and then not sell replacement brushes is beyond me.</li>
    <li> Totally love power toothbrushes and especially this Spin Brush. Do not EVER want to go back to the old manual type.</li>
    <li> cheaper than Oral B and works fine!</li>
    <li> Works better than the reciprocating only style.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Arm &amp; Hammer products for years. Most people realize the multiple benefits of Arm &amp; Hammer, but when it comes to buying a toothbrush, I tend to be a little picky. Here&#x27;s why:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have very difficult teeth to brush,  if I don&#x27;t continue with a clean oral hygiene, the one cavity I have will turn into 2. At age 33, that&#x27;s something to be proud of. I also credit that, along with white teeth (despite a deep love affair with Starbucks Coffee) to be from using Arm &amp; Hammer toothpaste. It&#x27;s inexpensive, so I can tolerate the somewhat grainy texture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This toothbrush helps remove tartar buildup that most other toothbrushes can&#x27;t remove. My teeth are a little larger, so it&#x27;s a tight fit in there! I also cleaned my Invisalign Braces using this product. To prevent staining and discoloration of Invisalign, I&#x27;d mix 8 ounces of warm water (it dissolves quicker and cleans better) with two tablespoons of Arm &amp; Hammer baking soda for about an hour. Clean with toothrbush, brush with A&amp;H toothpaste, replace and done! Invisalign braces remained free of stains.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only reason I gave this product four stars is because after looking high and low, I can&#x27;t find anything else but soft heads. I haven&#x27;t even found medium. A hard or medium even would help remove tartar buildup in those hard to reach places.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing left to say is that I prefer the \\&quot;deep cleaning\\&quot; heads, which us available to purchase here also. They provide a much deeper clean by adding a few longer bristles in the round tip of the bush&#x27;s head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope my review helps you make an informed decision. I know I&#x27;ll continue using the product because it&#x27;s so effective.</li>
    <li> The box said medium, but these are the hardest brushes ever. I have read about fake/knockoff products from China, and it wouldn&#x27;t shock me if this fell into that category. Unlike the other posters, I went to my local Walgreens and got replacement mediums that didn&#x27;t hurt to brush.</li>
