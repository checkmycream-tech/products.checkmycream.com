<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I bought this bottle along with a &amp;#34;stress&amp;#34; relieving bottle, from a different seller. This so call &amp;#34;sleep&amp;#34; bottle has no scent at all. It says breathe deeply but I do not smell anything. The bottle was put in a plastic bag and the seal wasn&#x27;t on the cap of the bottle like the what the stress bottle have. The solution inside may be switched out. I do not recommend buying one from this seller.</li>
    <li> I love this fragrance and it came well-packaged and in good time.</li>
    <li> Not satisfied at all and very disappointing with the product...</li>
    <li> My absolute favorite smell. It&#x27;s so delicate, yet strong. I love the blend and if you add it to the water when you&#x27;re filling the tub it will make a nice foam (short-lived, though). Love how the whole place smells like it after a bath. Will buy again.</li>
    <li> One of my favorite scents....very soothing. Very clean and relaxing scent and I use it for my evening shower!  Nice!</li>
    <li> This smells amazing. It reminds me of the Johnson&#x27;s baby lotion and bath set we&#x27;ve all used as a child.&lt;br /&gt;It is a great sleep aid. It is a bit much, considering the size of the bottle, but I use it sparing.</li>
    <li> If you like a very relaxing bath, highly recommend. Very pleasant smell, not to strong like some others. I received a bottle for Christmas along with bath salts. I went back to store and they where sold out. Will purchase again.</li>
    <li> I bought this about a year ago for myself when I was having difficulty falling asleep. It truly does work, so I gave it as a gift for my son. Gotta check back with him to see if it&#x27;s helped. I also use the pillow spray.</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with this body wash..makes my skin soft and has a lingering fragrance..would suggest to anyone that likes this combination</li>
    <li> I have been wanting to get this gift for a long time and am very excited to give it to my friend</li>
    <li> Love this product. Very soothing and works. Got a great deal on this as it was discontinued in my local store, transaction went smoothly.</li>
    <li> My favorite sleep remedy</li>
    <li> Wife loves this product.</li>
    <li> I have been using this body wash for a couple of years - I use it  when I shower in the evening and want to relax.  The body spray is wonderful, too.  The fragrance is wonderful.  I requested it for my birthday last year and my daughter sampled it when she bought it for me.  She&#x27;s hooked on it now, too.</li>
    <li> Someone gifted me with a Lavender &amp; Vanilla basket from Bath &amp; Body Works--pillow mist, room freshener, body mist--a while back and it quickly became my favorite. (Before then, I was more partial to Moonlight Path and the Sensual Amber scents, which I do still like.) A wonderful scent if you like something clean, light yet strong enough that it lingers, I would suggest this without reservation. Probably more a spring, summer scent as far as most autumn and winter scents tend to be heavier, but I think this can hold its own, works in all 4 seasons.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of all our senses, olfactory is supposedly the strongest. Maybe so, but this one doesn&#x27;t recall specific memories or moments; it&#x27;s just a scent I find really relaxing. Enough that I purchased the whole line--room mist, pillow mist, body spray, body wash/splash, body lotion. Even the jar candle. And I receive nothing but compliments from other people. It&#x27;s one of those soft, lingering scents that doesn&#x27;t overpower. Like a good, expensive perfume so subtle it almost doesn&#x27;t register, yet does (if that makes any sense). Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> An all time favorite!</li>
    <li> Relaxing fragrance for showering before you go to bed.</li>
    <li> I love the Sleep Lavender and Vanilla by B&amp;BW.  I didn&#x27;t want to make the trip to the store, so I ordered on Amazon.  Showed up two days later - perfect condition and just what I wanted.</li>
    <li> It is such a great body wash. And surprise! My boxer dog was experiencing some allergy issues with his feet. for weeks he was chewing on his feet and no matter what I did I could not seem to relieve this problem. 3 days ago I decided to wash his feet with this body wash, knowing that Lavender often helps with skin issues. The next day, he laid down on the floor and flipped his foot upwards to began chewing (out of habit) then just laid there looking at his foot. Didn&#x27;t chew at all and hasn&#x27;t since. I believe that the lavender was very helpful in relieving his \\&quot;itchy\\&quot; feet. Or maybe it was the vanilla too? either way, I&#x27;m ordering more today for me and my dog.</li>
    <li> Does what it says it will ... Soothes my skin.</li>
    <li> Do not use this product but a friend had said that she liked it and that her birthday was coming up.  So it was a gift and she is happy with it.</li>
    <li> I love this scented foamy soap! It leaves a soft clean scent on my skin,  not too strong. One of my favorites!</li>
    <li> Not very strong scent and doesn&#x27;t seem to clean. It leaves like a film on your skin. I normally love bbw products but this one not so much. Wasn&#x27;t horrible just wouldn&#x27;t buy again.</li>
    <li> This is the best lavender  body wash I&#x27;ve ever purchased better than the mist I purchased from a lavender farm.  Try the lotion &amp; body mist also I bought them all from Bath &amp; body Works &amp; Amazon of course!!!</li>
    <li> This was for my wife, it came to us with a broken top with tape on it and a torn package. I&#x27;m still waiting for my return label.</li>
    <li> SMELLS GREAT ON MY WIFE</li>
    <li> The smell you long for! This is such a beautiful clean and relaxing smell...I also do hand washables and Oh how they smell wonderful.&lt;br /&gt;This is my second purchase of Aromatherapy Sleep Lavender from Bath and Body works...the price is reasonable as well as the fragrance is&lt;br /&gt;so pleasing!</li>
    <li> It suits my needs wonderfully.  I cannot shower due to nerve damage in my feet  so I must bathe now and adding this to the bath water helps my skin to stay much softer and the aroma is so nice.  Winter is a drying time for everyone&#x27;s skin and these two products combined are so good against dry skin.</li>
    <li> I was looking for Sleep Lavender and Camomille, but couldn&#x27;t find anywhere.  I bought this as a replacement and I can&#x27;t even use it.  It is way to strong with an unnatural scent.</li>
    <li> Most relaxing fragrance.  Love it.</li>
    <li> Hubby bought this for me and I love it, it&#x27;s so fresh and calming and I&#x27;m not a shower gel person because they can be overwhelming.  I was so happy I could replace it through an Amazon seller.  I ordered one for a friend at the same time and she loves it too.  Seriously, I should buy about 5 in case they ever stop making it.</li>
    <li> Came brand new, and I love this soap</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s good and relaxing but requires more liquid to lather.</li>
    <li> Love the way it makes me feel in my shower and I love the smell.  It goes together with my other Sleep products.</li>
