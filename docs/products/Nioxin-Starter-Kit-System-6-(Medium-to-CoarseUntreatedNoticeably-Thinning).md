### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>I switched to System 1 and it works great!</li>
      <li>This is the best hair care system I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
      <li>The foam seems to be a great way to prevent UV damage.</li>
      <li>It is a good product in my opinion..</li>
      <li>Plus it feels good on the scalp and seems to deliver as promised.</li>
      <li>LOVE, love, love it!!!</li>
      <li>However, the shampoo and conditioner do leave my scalp feeling very healthy.</li>
      <li>&quot;  I love the results, having used Nioxin System #8 for about 11 months now, everyone comments on how good my hair looks</li>
      <li>It seems to be a popular product</li>
      <li>Conditioner is a nice addition to package.</li>
      <li>I love it</li>
      <li>I bought this for my boyfriend, who&#x27;s hair is thinning on top of his head at the age of 22.</li>
      <li>I love it.  </li>
      <li>, how \\&quot;filled-in\\&quot; the top of my scalp is with hair now.  </li>
      <li>I keep correcting my stylist because they&#x27;re under the impression it does - maybe to sell more.</li>
      <li>Then, someone told me about Nioxin, and I read a comment from a happy purchaser here on Amazon who recommended just getting the starter kit each time, it saves money and is very convenient and I am SO happy I took the initiative (and the unknown purchaser&#x27;s advice) and started using Nioxin.  </li>
      <li>This excellent hair care product costs much less at Amazon than at salons.  </li>
      <li>, it&#x27;s worth it!</li>
      <li>While showering I noticed a large amount of hair fall out and while combing, even more fell out</li>
      <li>and wow, my hair looks and feels amazing.</li>
      <li>It is worth</li>
      <li>This stuff keeps your follicles clear of DHT and oils so your hair looks and feels better</li>
      <li>The difference was evident in the thinning of my hair when I stopped.</li>
      <li>Hair is thicker and more coarse.  </li>
      <li>After the first wash, I felt and saw the difference.</li>
      <li>Only time will tell if 6 is better than 1.</li>
      <li>My husband even told me how thick my hair looks, Nioxin is amazing!</li>
      <li>The starter kit is too small, but you can get it to make sure it works for you, but I wouldn&#x27;t see why it wouldn&#x27;t work.</li>
      <li>Well, I was using around the time that I didn&#x27;t know too much about DHT and how it can actually be blocked.  </li>
      <li>I started with the System 1 and after not seeing much results, granted I had no further hair loss I switched to system 6.</li>
      <li>and you&#x27;d think that such a heavily marketed and popular product actually worked.</li>
      <li>As a vain female, my thick, wavy hair was my crowning glory---I was devastated when, in my early to mid-50s, I noticed that I could see my scalp through my hair on top, and so could everyone else.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m blonde and fair complected - this is the WRONG system for my type.</li>
      <li>But if you actually have AGA, alopecia, or any other true medical condition that causes hair loss, Nioxin won&#x27;t work.</li>
      <li>Nioxin mentions that nearly 90% of the people get the feeling that they are getting their hair back.</li>

<li> It is very hard to find these products.</li>

<li> No one wanted to say anything and hurt my feelings, so I tried to ignore it, thinking &#x27;If they aren&#x27;t saying anything, nothing must really be wrong; it&#x27;s all in my head.&#x27;  </li>
<li> I&#x27;M saying, \\&quot;Needless to say.....</li>
<li> Very disappointed I can&#x27;t find these elsewhere.</li>

    <li> Product arrived in timely fashion. Yet to see any results. However, the shampoo and conditioner do leave my scalp feeling very healthy.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m blonde and fair complected - this is the WRONG system for my type. I switched to System 1 and it works great! So don&#x27;t get this if you&#x27;re like me. Oh yea and remember this product doesn&#x27;t grow hair back. I keep correcting my stylist because they&#x27;re under the impression it does - maybe to sell more. You need to be on Propecia if you&#x27;re loosing hair or even Minoxidil. This stuff keeps your follicles clear of DHT and oils so your hair looks and feels better plus it thickens it. Hope this helps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Regards,&lt;br /&gt;Steve</li>
    <li> This is the best hair care system I&#x27;ve ever used. I love it and I will continue to use it, despite the price, it&#x27;s worth it! If you have noticeably thinning hair like I did, you need to buy this. After the first wash, I felt and saw the difference. I&#x27;ve been using the cleanser, scalp thearpy, scalp treatment and recently got the follice booster, for the past two weeks and wow, my hair looks and feels amazing. My husband even told me how thick my hair looks, Nioxin is amazing! The starter kit is too small, but you can get it to make sure it works for you, but I wouldn&#x27;t see why it wouldn&#x27;t work. I recently ordered larger bottles. I will only use Nioxin from now on!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been dealing with a thinning hair problem for the last few years and tried this particular product to see if it would help. It does not, the \\&quot;Scalp-Activating Treatment\\&quot; only makes your hair appear thicker temporarily. I&#x27;ve been using it for months and have only continued to lose hair. This angers me because this product only served to bring my hopes up, and now I have to face reality. Don&#x27;t waste your time with this, or any mainstream hair restoration treatment. Go to a doctor or hair restoration CLINIC!</li>
    <li> I started with the System 1 and after not seeing much results, granted I had no further hair loss I switched to system 6. The foam seems to be a great way to prevent UV damage. Only time will tell if 6 is better than 1.</li>
    <li> This excellent hair care product costs much less at Amazon than at salons.  Plus it feels good on the scalp and seems to deliver as promised. Conditioner is a nice addition to package.</li>
    <li> I have only been using for a month and am already noticing a difference.  Hair is thicker and more coarse.  I recommend also buying the Nioxin supplements.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t say that I noticed a difference in my husbands bald spot until he stopped using it. He used it for 4-5 months and the spot didn&#x27;t seem to get smaller so he stopped using it once he ran out. However, once he stopped using it I started noticing his hair in the sink, on his pillow, and in the shower again. So needless to say it does not grow hair back but it did stop him from losing further hair. It is worth the try I think because it can&#x27;t hurt.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t \\&quot;get\\&quot; Nioxin. It seems to be a popular product and you&#x27;d think that such a heavily marketed and popular product actually worked. Nope, my hair got thinner. I have AGA and Nioxin claims to block DHT. Well, I was using around the time that I didn&#x27;t know too much about DHT and how it can actually be blocked.  Needless to say, this product didn&#x27;t work AT ALL and the imgredients do not support the claim. I even used the Follicle Booster thinking that I might need something a little stronger. Again, this did nothing. I can see how Nioxin might help those who have hair loss due to stress or post pregnancy. But if you actually have AGA, alopecia, or any other true medical condition that causes hair loss, Nioxin won&#x27;t work.</li>
    <li> I can tell a difference in the thickness of my hair after two months of using the product.It is a good product in my opinion..</li>
    <li> I was very skeptical about this product,  this has worked very well for my thinning hair</li>
    <li> It is very hard to find these products. I have used these hair products for years. Very disappointed I can&#x27;t find these elsewhere. Thank goodness I can get them from you</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t know why Married With Children said \\&quot;Needless to say, it didn&#x27;t work\\&quot;.  I&#x27;M saying, \\&quot;Needless to say.....it worked PERFECTLY!\\&quot;  I love the results, having used Nioxin System #8 for about 11 months now, everyone comments on how good my hair looks, how \\&quot;filled-in\\&quot; the top of my scalp is with hair now.  As a vain female, my thick, wavy hair was my crowning glory---I was devastated when, in my early to mid-50s, I noticed that I could see my scalp through my hair on top, and so could everyone else.  No one wanted to say anything and hurt my feelings, so I tried to ignore it, thinking &#x27;If they aren&#x27;t saying anything, nothing must really be wrong; it&#x27;s all in my head.&#x27;  It took a particularly rude friend of my husband&#x27;s, who blurts out whatever comes to mind, to mention that I was going \\&quot;BALD\\&quot;, as he so politely put it.  I was crushed!!  Then, someone told me about Nioxin, and I read a comment from a happy purchaser here on Amazon who recommended just getting the starter kit each time, it saves money and is very convenient and I am SO happy I took the initiative (and the unknown purchaser&#x27;s advice) and started using Nioxin.  LOVE, love, love it!!!</li>
    <li> Have used Nioxin for over 15 years.  Stopped for a while to try something else but returned to Nioxin.  The difference was evident in the thinning of my hair when I stopped.</li>
    <li> While showering I noticed a large amount of hair fall out and while combing, even more fell out so I stopped using it after three weeks. Plus it stinks, I always had to use a different conditioner after kit to make my hair smell decent. Save your money!</li>
    <li> I love it.  Results after just one week of use.</li>
    <li> It just DOES NOT grow your hair back or stop hair from falling. They never claim so, either. Nioxin mentions that nearly 90% of the people get the feeling that they are getting their hair back. Well, psychology!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my boyfriend, who&#x27;s hair is thinning on top of his head at the age of 22. He used it for about a month, a couple times a week. It appeared to be helping; making his hair look thicker.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He had to stop using it because it was giving him acne on his scalp. It got to the point where he had a cyst develop in one of his hair follicles. He had to go to the doctor to get it checked out. It disappeared in a few days once he stopped using this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this to anyone who&#x27;s scalp is not super sensitive to chemicals.</li>
