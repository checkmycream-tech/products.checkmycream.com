      <li>Easy to use and nice colors!</li>
      <li>They are easy to use, look great and wash off easily.</li>
      <li>First of all, the color selection is great.</li>
      <li>PF discontinues it. :)</li>
      <li>I love makeup</li>
      <li>a try &amp; immediately fell in love with it.</li>
      <li>I love the colors too and it just make my eyes pop.</li>
      <li>I have tried many liner pencils and they just disappear on my lids.  </li>
      <li>The medium brown color in this trio is my favorite.</li>
      <li>Even outside, in the 100° heat, it stays on perfectly.</li>
      <li>I love this product.</li>
      <li>but I love the nude</li>
      <li>I love these and buy them again and again.  </li>
      <li>And STAY on :)</li>
      <li>The lighter brown color is also great for your bottom lids if you want definition that looks natural.</li>
      <li>easy on, easy off, great colors, and does not bother my very sensitive eyes.  </li>
      <li>Does not smear easily.  </li>
      <li>My sister commented that in the sunlight, with my new smudgy shimmery look, my eyes looked a beautiful shade of golden brown.&lt;br</li>
      <li>They apply so easily to get a smooth line.</li>
      <li>Smooth and doesn&#x27;t smear</li>
      <li>This eyeliner glides on smooth and my eyes have had no reaction to it.</li>
      <li>Go on really smooth.  </li>
      <li>Worth the money!</li>
      <li>They go on smoothly and work super.</li>
      <li>Unlike most eyeliners I&#x27;ve experimented with in the past, I haven&#x27;t experienced irritation or itching in my eyes from the product.</li>
      <li>Physicians Formula pencils do last longer and are a good price as well.</li>
      <li>It isnt worth the cheap price</li>
      <li>I had hoped if I bought new makeup without irritants or toxins I would be able to wear it comfortably but that is just not the case.</li>
      <li>The lightest color is very light goldish color which doesn&#x27;t have a great effect by itself (even for blondes), but it works great when you go for a more natural smudgy look - simply use one of the darker colors first, and then trace the outside of the dark line with the gold pencil.</li>
      <li>A nice swipe of brown over that, and under the bottom lashes gives an amazing smudgy/smoky-eye illusion, without any hard lines.</li>
      <li>The best part is that, unlike the other pencils I&#x27;ve purchased, I&#x27;m not constantly breaking off the tip.</li>
      <li>This is the first eyeliner I found that really does go on smoothly and doesn&#x27;t smudge while I&#x27;m working out leaving me raccoon eyes.</li>
      <li>Only thing is my didn&#x27;t come with a sharpener, so that is becoming an issue as the eyeliners need it!</li>
      <li>The eyeliners are smooth and easy to apply, and I don&#x27;t usually have to worry about touching up smudges or smears throughout the day.</li>
      <li>Easy to apply, colors are natural looking.</li>
      <li>This eyeliner really does stay on ALL day!</li>
      <li>I will most definitely stocking up on these!</li>
      <li>is suppose to make you look pretty</li>
      <li>The colors of the eyeliners are neutral and pretty.</li>
      <li>Since Stila discontinued my favorite brown eyeliner over a year ago, I&#x27;ve searched high &amp; low for the right shade of easy-to-apply medium brown eyeliner (I have brown hair/eyes), both at Sephora and drug stores.</li>
      <li>They are super easy to apply and very durable once they dry out.</li>
      <li>One is light enough I use it to fill in my brows.</li>
      <li>goes really well with PF eye shadows.</li>
      <li>I have sensitive skin and am prone to eye infections caused by many commercial make-up brands.</li>
      <li>but I love the other two.</li>
      <li>The stay-put creamy formula glides on, without any tugging, as with many other eyeliner pencils.</li>
      <li>It glides smoothly and it stays for a long time.</li>
      <li>Would highly recommend.</li>
      <li>I usually pair this with Physician&#x27;s Formula OrganicWear Mascara, and the result is nice and natural.</li>
      <li>Its rare that i find a liner that doesn&#x27;t make my eyes red or water until they adjust.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a really great color to wear if black is too harsh for you, but you still want something that will make your eyes pop.</li>
      <li>The colors all have a subtle shimmer to them and it&#x27;s very easy to create a smudged look by combining the colors.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not a big makeup person as my skin is incredibly sensitive, but this product has worked very well for me.</li>
      <li>I have found during my makeup adventures that if you have any thing sensitive you need to apply makeup to Physicians Formula</li>
      <li>You can do a really natural look for the day or amp it up for a night out.</li>
      <li>For a whole day long, it stays and looks like you just finish the make up.</li>
      <li>The first day I got it was great, but then the narrow tip disappears and a very thick, wide tip develops.</li>
      <li>Also, I have very sensitive eyes, and  this is the only eyeliner I can find that won&#x27;t irritate them.</li>
      <li>I am a big fan of physicians formula generally.</li>

    <li> I&#x27;m not sure how to review this product because the eyeliners were all dried out and crumbly when I got them. I could hardly apply them.</li>
    <li> Great eyeliners! They are super easy to apply and very durable once they dry out. The lightest color is very light goldish color which doesn&#x27;t have a great effect by itself (even for blondes), but it works great when you go for a more natural smudgy look - simply use one of the darker colors first, and then trace the outside of the dark line with the gold pencil.</li>
    <li> I love this product. It glides smoothly and it stays for a long time. it didn&#x27;t irritate my eyes at all. I put eye shadow over it under the eye area and it last all day. I love the colors too and it just make my eyes pop.</li>
    <li> I have found during my makeup adventures that if you have any thing sensitive you need to apply makeup to Physicians Formula is the go to. My eyes are really sensitive especially in this awful allergie season. This eyeliner glides on smooth and my eyes have had no reaction to it. Its rare that i find a liner that doesn&#x27;t make my eyes red or water until they adjust. looove this brand and this liner!</li>
    <li> This liner is way too thick to apply to my lower lids. The first day I got it was great, but then the narrow tip disappears and a very thick, wide tip develops. It should come with a sharpener.</li>
    <li> I wear a lot of neutrals and the medium brown in this set is the best color ever. I use the lighter color sometimes on my lower lid and the black for at night. Great texture to these liners. Go on really smooth.  I haven&#x27;t had any problems with them breaking as some reviews indicated</li>
    <li> I too love these eyeliners, great pigments, doesn&#x27;t make my eyes irritated, and it comes with a sharpener on the end of it.</li>
    <li> This is my go-to eyeliner. This is the third box I buy. The colors all have a subtle shimmer to them and it&#x27;s very easy to create a smudged look by combining the colors. The best part is that, unlike the other pencils I&#x27;ve purchased, I&#x27;m not constantly breaking off the tip.</li>
    <li> For a whole day long, it stays and looks like you just finish the make up. Easy to use and nice colors! Love it!</li>
    <li> This eyeliner really does stay on ALL day! Even outside, in the 100° heat, it stays on perfectly. Also, I have very sensitive eyes, and  this is the only eyeliner I can find that won&#x27;t irritate them. I am VERY impressed with these pencils!</li>
    <li> I love these and buy them again and again.  Great colors, good value, no complaints.  I am a big fan of physicians formula generally.</li>
    <li> These eye liner pencils are the best. They are twist up so I do not need to sharpen them. They apply so easily to get a smooth line. I get the best definition with these liners. I love makeup and I like to find products that help me apply it as easily as possible. I have blue eyes and this nude collection goes really well with PF eye shadows. I I&#x27;ll repurchase soon.</li>
    <li> easy on, easy off, great colors, and does not bother my very sensitive eyes.  I have about twelve of these liners and use them in combination together instead of shadow.</li>
    <li> I have sensitive skin and am prone to eye infections caused by many commercial make-up brands. I have no reactions to these eyeliners. They are easy to use, look great and wash off easily.</li>
    <li> Physicians Formula Shimmer Eyeliner Trio for Nude Eyes rocks my world! Since Stila discontinued my favorite brown eyeliner over a year ago, I&#x27;ve searched high &amp; low for the right shade of easy-to-apply medium brown eyeliner (I have brown hair/eyes), both at Sephora and drug stores. CVS had 40% off PF products last week, so I gave the Nude trio a try &amp; immediately fell in love with it. The stay-put creamy formula glides on, without any tugging, as with many other eyeliner pencils. A thin line of the black pencil offers a nice base on your upper lash line to make lashes look fuller.  A nice swipe of brown over that, and under the bottom lashes gives an amazing smudgy/smoky-eye illusion, without any hard lines. The third color - a champagne shade - applied over the others, will lighten the color if you&#x27;ve been a little heavey-handed with application, and also gives your eyes a wide-awake look if you line the inner corners of your eyes with it. My sister commented that in the sunlight, with my new smudgy shimmery look, my eyes looked a beautiful shade of golden brown.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also bought the PF Shinner Eyeler Trio Hazel Eyes trio. I liked the black/light brown combo, but didn&#x27;t like the purple. It made me look like I&#x27;d been punched in the eye. I&#x27;m stocking up on the Nude shade in case PF discontinues it. :)</li>
    <li> This eyeliner stings my eyes and even makes them yellow. The seller has not helped me resolve issues with this and was rude and not very responsive to my email. It isnt worth the cheap price it just is s**tty all around eyeliner is suppose to make you look pretty but this irritates my eyes to the point where I look like a zombie. Ladies look elsewhere or buy crap.</li>
    <li> Only use the black but stays on  all day. Wish they sold the colors separately. Have no use for the other two in the box.</li>
    <li> Best eyeliner, EVER. Wears an extra long time. I especially like the medium brown.</li>
    <li> I had hoped if I bought new makeup without irritants or toxins I would be able to wear it comfortably but that is just not the case. It&#x27;s a bummer.</li>
    <li> I have tried many liner pencils and they just disappear on my lids.  Physicians Formula pencils do last longer and are a good price as well.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not a big makeup person as my skin is incredibly sensitive, but this product has worked very well for me. The colors of the eyeliners are neutral and pretty. The eyeliners are smooth and easy to apply, and I don&#x27;t usually have to worry about touching up smudges or smears throughout the day. Unlike most eyeliners I&#x27;ve experimented with in the past, I haven&#x27;t experienced irritation or itching in my eyes from the product. I usually pair this with Physician&#x27;s Formula OrganicWear Mascara, and the result is nice and natural. Worth the money!</li>
    <li> Black and brown are identical but I love the nude</li>
    <li> I am in love with this eyeliner trio! First of all, the color selection is great. You can do a really natural look for the day or amp it up for a night out. The medium brown color in this trio is my favorite. It doesn&#x27;t have a reddish undertone to it like most other brown eyeliners, which can make my eyes look tired. It&#x27;s a really great color to wear if black is too harsh for you, but you still want something that will make your eyes pop. The lighter brown color is also great for your bottom lids if you want definition that looks natural. The best part about this trio, however, is the staying power of these eyeliners. I have oily skin and these liners last all day. They outlast any other eyeliner I have ever purchased, including Mally&#x27;s so called \\&quot;bullet proof\\&quot; liners. I will most definitely stocking up on these!</li>
    <li> Smooth and doesn&#x27;t smear</li>
    <li> Very messy to use and I&#x27;m allergic to it.</li>
    <li> Easy to apply, colors are natural looking. Does not smear easily.  One is light enough I use it to fill in my brows.</li>
    <li> This is the first eyeliner I found that really does go on smoothly and doesn&#x27;t smudge while I&#x27;m working out leaving me raccoon eyes.</li>
    <li> Everytime I&#x27;ve used the trio I&#x27;ve received compliments on my eye.  Only thing is my didn&#x27;t come with a sharpener, so that is becoming an issue as the eyeliners need it!</li>
    <li> These are great liners. They go on smoothly and work super. The lightest one is a bit hard to see but I love the other two. Would highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Love these!  They literally GLIDE on!!!!  And STAY on :)</li>
