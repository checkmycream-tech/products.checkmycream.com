      <li>Although this is the split end protector and it does work good</li>

      <li>Leaves my hair feeling nice and smooth.</li>
      <li>This is a must have for me! :)</li>
      <li>This is my favorite leave-in conditioner of all time.</li>
      <li>and after you take a shower and that beautiful hair drys you can feel your split ends disappearing and that soft luxurious feel of healthy hair :)plus the delicious smell is such a bonus !</li>
      <li>/&gt;It is wonderful to put in long hair to protect the ends and it gives some shine as well.</li>
      <li>I ordered this product because i heard a lot of great reviews, and i must say I love the way it made my natural hair feel.</li>
      <li>But I soon figured out that if I put it on in the morning rather than letting it sit on my hair overnight, it wasn&#x27;t as strong.     </li>
      <li>First, just to give you an idea on what kind of hair I have</li>
      <li>This could be because it was discontinued and repackaged under the Touchably Smooth line.</li>
      <li>and I searched for it everywhere because I heard such great reviews on it.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s definitely worth looking in to!</li>
      <li>It leaves my dry hair moisturized and it smells great.</li>
      <li>No hair product can mend split hair back together, but as a leave-in, this does a good job of disguising the damaged ends.</li>
      <li>but it leaves buildup quickly.</li>
      <li>I used to just be able to put this on my hair and leave the house, but I don&#x27;t use this new one.</li>
      <li>when i first heard about this product and ordered it, i was so excited about trying it.</li>
      <li>I retain moisture better, this is more creamy &amp; loose.</li>
      <li>Leaves it soft, managable, smelling fabulous, and leaves no build up!</li>
      <li>This was well worth the $2.50 I paid for it at Wal-Mart.</li>
      <li>This one left my hair soooooo soft, the smell is great</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t speak for this one on Amazon, though the bottle appears to be the right design.</li>
      <li>It is a creamy, thick leave in conditioner that works great weather</li>
      <li>/&gt;Unfortunately, I don&#x27;t think Herbal Essences makes this exact product anymore.</li>
      <li>So this time I concentrated on just the ends with this product and it worked really well!</li>
      <li>The first two weeks I used it, it made my hair feel coated, then too moisturized.</li>
      <li>I recently picked up Pantene Split End Repair, which works SO much better on my hair.</li>
      <li>and it really works!</li>
      <li>I first heard about it on youtube</li>
      <li>It moisturizes really well</li>
      <li>shipping was fast.</li>
      <li>I only recently had to refresh because it was such a great product.</li>
      <li>This product is very creamy</li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t know how much it does for prevent split ends though.</li>
      <li>it and my hair feels very moisturized.</li>
      <li>SHIPPING WAS FAST, NEED TO</li>
      <li>Now my Sister wants me to get her  a bottle to so</li>
      <li>The only thing I didn&#x27;t like about this product is that the product does have a sweet smell - something I didn&#x27;t mind at first but soon found it wearing on me.</li>
      <li>But Clairol completely changed the product and kept the packaging!!!</li>
      <li>The other benefit to this product is that aside from it protecting hair against the rough effects of rubbing against my shirt, it also does a great job with moisturizing my hair without making it oily.</li>
      <li>i use long term relationship shampoo and conditioner and it does such an amazing job with growing my locks longer.</li>
      <li>I purchased one bottle and it arrived withing the next three days, super fast shipping.</li>
      <li>Before, I was carrying around a spray-in styling mousse to push down fly-aways, but now I&#x27;m able to leave the house without taking any products with me.</li>
      <li>I bought this (at a high, inflated price) because I&#x27;m using the matching shampoo/conditioner, and had problems with hair loss.</li>
      <li>I almost gave the review 4 stars because it is so difficult to find, but its so great</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used a handful of expensive hair \\&quot;solutions\\&quot; since my hair was first damaged in May, and can say that most of them aren&#x27;t worth the hype.</li>
      <li>I was will to pay the higher price if it was the same.</li>
      <li>I only bought it because I thought it was their first formula as the bottle in the picture.</li>
      <li>Just be careful not to use a lot of this; especially if you have fine hair, this will weigh your hair down if you use too much.</li>
      <li>or if I blow dry straight.</li>
      <li>So much so that I wondered what would happen if I used it on wet hair and combed it through!</li>
      <li>I have bad split ends and it helped them a little but could be better especiall for 13 BUCKS!!!</li>
      <li>I allow my hair to dry naturally in curls</li>

<li> I tried it and come to find out, it still didn&#x27;t make my hair stiff but it came out soft and manageable!     </li>
<li> I used the protector on my washed hair and let it air dry.</li>
<li> I put this on my ends and they immediately go from dry to silky.</li>
<li> I don&#x27;t like the way my hair feels when I use it on dry hair.</li>
<li> Mainly because I like thick butters on my hair.</li>
<li> Let me mention that I am a mixed African American with really thick, sometimes frizzy hair.</li>
<li> I have fine, wavy-curly hair that was badly damaged in a bleach job last spring.</li>
<li> Also, a little goes a long way.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I LOVE this product! I&#x27;ve been using this for 6 months now and it works so well that it&#x27;s now officially one of my must-have products! Here&#x27;s why.....     First, just to give you an idea on what kind of hair I have, I&#x27;m an African American (AA) woman with type 4a hair (for those who don&#x27;t know - that means it&#x27;s pretty thick ;-D). When I first tried this product I didn&#x27;t use this on wet hair but on dry hair and the reason I didn&#x27;t was because I&#x27;ve dealt with other products that were specifically designed for \\&quot;split end protection\\&quot; and knew that when I tried to use them throughout my hair before, it made my hair a bit stiff and hard to manage. So this time I concentrated on just the ends with this product and it worked really well! So much so that I wondered what would happen if I used it on wet hair and combed it through! I tried it and come to find out, it still didn&#x27;t make my hair stiff but it came out soft and manageable!     The other benefit to this product is that aside from it protecting hair against the rough effects of rubbing against my shirt, it also does a great job with moisturizing my hair without making it oily. This is a big plus because I can&#x27;t tolerate oily hair!     The only thing I didn&#x27;t like about this product is that the product does have a sweet smell - something I didn&#x27;t mind at first but soon found it wearing on me. But I soon figured out that if I put it on in the morning rather than letting it sit on my hair overnight, it wasn&#x27;t as strong.     All in all, it&#x27;s a great product for split end protection and moisture and that makes it great for length retention. Not to mention that the price is more than fair for what it does! It&#x27;s definitely worth looking in to!</li>
    <li> when i first heard about this product and ordered it, i was so excited about trying it. The first two weeks I used it, it made my hair feel coated, then too moisturized. I wanted to continue to see what it would do to my hair. So, I used a smaller amount and only every other night. After the two weeks were up, my hair was begging for more. I can now use it every night on my hair. And it&#x27;s great as a leave- in. I love this product, i will continue to use. Oh, the shipping took forever, so next time I will order way before I run out, that way I&#x27;ll get it in time.</li>
    <li> Pretty good product! I like to use it as a leave-in after washing and conditioning my hair. I don&#x27;t like the way my hair feels when I use it on dry hair. Also, a little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> I have fine, wavy-curly hair that was badly damaged in a bleach job last spring. I bought this product after I decided to give up my hair straightener due to the added damage it was causing and finally noticed how bad my split ends were. No hair product can mend split hair back together, but as a leave-in, this does a good job of disguising the damaged ends. My hair was dry and coarse to the touch but has started to feel softer again after buying this product. Before, I was carrying around a spray-in styling mousse to push down fly-aways, but now I&#x27;m able to leave the house without taking any products with me. This was well worth the $2.50 I paid for it at Wal-Mart. I&#x27;ve used a handful of expensive hair \\&quot;solutions\\&quot; since my hair was first damaged in May, and can say that most of them aren&#x27;t worth the hype. Just be careful not to use a lot of this; especially if you have fine hair, this will weigh your hair down if you use too much.</li>
    <li> Very unhappy this is not the same product it use to be. Will not buy again. I was will to pay the higher price if it was the same.</li>
    <li> There&#x27;s nothing else to say that , \\&quot; My hair just love this split end treament ! \\&quot; Now my Sister wants me to get her  a bottle to so there must some kind of evidence or progress in the way works with my hair .</li>
    <li> This product is amazing!  I first heard about it on youtube and I searched for it everywhere because I heard such great reviews on it. I have relaxed hair so I have always used a leave in conditioner. This one left my hair soooooo soft, the smell is great it and my hair feels very moisturized. I have tried a lot of leave-ins in my day, but this one is at the top of my list! I almost gave the review 4 stars because it is so difficult to find, but its so great I gave it 5 anyway.</li>
    <li> I love this leave-in conditioner! It leaves my dry hair moisturized and it smells great. I only gave 4 stars because it is so difficult to find this product in stores and for the fact that 2 out of the 3 bottles I ordered had broken pumps upon arrival.</li>
    <li> This smells sooo good first off!! And does wonders for maintaining my thin waist length highlighted hair!! Leaves it soft, managable, smelling fabulous, and leaves no build up! This is a must have for me! :)</li>
    <li> * I find this product and the Fructis Leave-In treatment to be comparable  * I think they are both great finds for the price  * Great for anyone that blow dries or curls their hair often</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for a while and couldn&#x27;t find it at my local stores anymore. Thank God for Amazon! It is a creamy, thick leave in conditioner that works great weather I allow my hair to dry naturally in curls or if I blow dry straight. This smells great and helps keep split ends and dryness at bay. I love it!</li>
    <li> I bought this because I was hoping it would be the one I got years ago! I only recently had to refresh because it was such a great product. But Clairol completely changed the product and kept the packaging!!! It smells like soap and has a thin texture that doesn&#x27;t do anything for me. I used to just be able to put this on my hair and leave the house, but I don&#x27;t use this new one.</li>
    <li> I heard that this product was good so I tried it and it did nothing for me besides leaving build up and a sticky white residue. It smells okay but it leaves buildup quickly. It did not moisturize my ends either.</li>
    <li> I have waist-length hair, &amp; use several products by Herbal Essence.  I used this product until the bottle was finished, which lasted over a year.  I would use it sparingly on the ends, wet or dry, but it would leave my hair stiff, &amp; sometimes would clump in certain sections of my hair.  I recently picked up Pantene Split End Repair, which works SO much better on my hair.</li>
    <li> I have been looking to try this product ever since I saw it mentioned in a YouTube video. I was dismayed to find out that it was discontinued, but I knew that Amazon would have some. I purchased one bottle and it arrived withing the next three days, super fast shipping. Let me mention that I am a mixed African American with really thick, sometimes frizzy hair. I also relax my arm pit length hair. I used the protector on my washed hair and let it air dry. Once dry my hair was so soft and less frizzy that I could not believe it. Also, I use this in my LOC (liquid oil cream) method to seal in moisture.</li>
    <li> I bought this (at a high, inflated price) because I&#x27;m using the matching shampoo/conditioner, and had problems with hair loss. I have noticed that it smoothed my hair a bit, kept it from frizzing so bad, but it doesn&#x27;t seem to have made a difference with my hair loss. One other problem with it was it seems like no matter how careful I am about spreading it through my hair, or how little I use, I still end up with a streak or 2 of clumped up hair in the morning (I use it at night).</li>
    <li> As far as the smell, we&#x27;ll it smells wonderful. But that&#x27;s it&#x27;s best quality. I have bad split ends and it helped them a little but could be better especiall for 13 BUCKS!!!</li>
    <li> I have thin hair, and I am growing it out so I want to make it easy to take care of and this product did a great job.</li>
    <li> I loveee this!!! I put this on my ends and they immediately go from dry to silky. A little goes a long way</li>
    <li> Mainly because I like thick butters on my hair. I retain moisture better, this is more creamy &amp; loose. Also the base is water, I like that it is a leave in, doesn&#x27;t last long though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have thick loooooong hair down my back. This tiny bottles didn&#x27;t last long</li>
    <li> I had never seen this stuff in stores until just recently. i use long term relationship shampoo and conditioner and it does such an amazing job with growing my locks longer. so i decided to use this as well. it smells so great and it really works!</li>
    <li> This is my favorite leave-in conditioner of all time. My hair is extremely dry and damaged from years of bleaching, but you would hardly know it with this product. Not only does it make combing a breeze, it also leaves your hair looking nicer and it smells WONDERFUL.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, I don&#x27;t think Herbal Essences makes this exact product anymore. I can&#x27;t speak for this one on Amazon, though the bottle appears to be the right design. However, the price on here is quadruple what I used to pay at Target. This could be because it was discontinued and repackaged under the Touchably Smooth line.</li>
    <li> GREAT PRICE, AND SHIPPING WAS FAST, NEED TO BUT MORE, SMELLS REALLY GOOD. PRODUCT WORKS GREAT IN MY HAIR, LEAVES IT MOISTURIZED AND SMELLING GREAT</li>
    <li> I may get more. It moisturizes really well and I like it. Don&#x27;t know how much it does for prevent split ends though.</li>
    <li> I love this leave in.</li>
    <li> This product is very creamy and after you take a shower and that beautiful hair drys you can feel your split ends disappearing and that soft luxurious feel of healthy hair :)plus the delicious smell is such a bonus !</li>
    <li> Love this product! Leaves my hair feeling nice and smooth. Actually works like it says it will, unlike some products that still leave my hair looking frizzy.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. I have relaxed hair, and it works well. It makes my hair fell silky and conditioned. O and it smells sooo good, like raspberries.</li>
    <li> Although this is the split end protector and it does work good I only bought it because I thought it was their first formula as the bottle in the picture. It was not. It was the second formula which has a different bottle and smell!</li>
    <li> this is not the same as the stuff i bought from the store.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for years. Walmart quit carrying it and I could not find it anywhere else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is wonderful to put in long hair to protect the ends and it gives some shine as well.</li>
    <li> I ordered this product because i heard a lot of great reviews, and i must say I love the way it made my natural hair feel. shipping was fast.</li>
