      <li>Love this product!  </li>
      <li>Made this vacation much more pleasant than most!</li>
      <li>just started taking it, so don&#x27;t know how effective it is</li>
      <li>it was warm and sunny.  </li>
      <li>Pleased to report that after taking heliocare one pill per day then sailing all day also wearing one application of zinc sunscreen for babies, i had no hint of burn whatsoever.</li>
      <li>make sure you wear sunscreen as well.</li>
      <li>I sunburn easily.  </li>
      <li>The company advertises it as a strong antioxidant for the skin.</li>
      <li>I take one a day during the warmer weather,and two if I&#x27;ll be out in strong sun for longer periods of time.</li>
      <li>But it&#x27;s sold via drugstore.com where its relevant page says it contacts strictly</li>
      <li>Bought this product on a friend&#x27;s recommendation to prevent an allergic reaction I get from sun exposure in the spring and fall (my condition is called PMLE - Polymorphous Light Eruption).  </li>
      <li>I no longer suffer severe burns when exposed to light.</li>
      <li>I was excited about it</li>
      <li>/&gt;So far, it has been effective.</li>
      <li>I am fair skinned and have blue eyes.</li>
      <li>Returned it for a full refund but decided not to have it replaced because it didn&#x27;t look as though it was tampered with it</li>
      <li>IT REALLY WORKS!!  </li>
      <li>Well he was right.  </li>
      <li>Just take one right when you see you burned.</li>

      <li>product isn&#x27;t a substitute for sunscreen or for being careful in the sun, but it does help protect you even more against the sun&#x27;s damaging rays.</li>
      <li>I just know that I can&#x27;t handle much sun at all anymore and burn within minutes.  </li>
      <li>real test will be at the end of the summer season.</li>
      <li>There is voracious debate in the medical community as to whether or not barrier creams (i.e. sunblock) make any difference, but many other porphyrics also find that anti-oxidant oils and/or barrier creams make a huge impact on quality of life.</li>
      <li>Mind you, this is not a magic bullet for me in order to have copacetic experiences with light all of the time, but the amount of relief it provides during short-term light exposure is noted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>But, I love to be active outdoors.</li>
      <li>Just don&#x27;t rely on these alone, especially if you&#x27;re going to the beach or vacation to a hot area</li>
      <li>There are several types of porphyria which have such severe reactions to sunlight that boils and lesions erupt almost immediately, but my mutation does not cause more than very red and sore burns on occasion</li>
      <li>I was pretty tan when we left</li>
      <li>My particular case is so severe that all light, natural or otherwise, causes me neurological and physical symptoms which are rather chronic (seizures, hallucinations, breathing difficulties, unbearable abdominal pain and distention, et cetera).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>He&#x27;s pretty traditional and old school.  </li>
      <li>My system is SUPER sensitive to chemicals and other irritants, and Heliocare has caused me not one reaction or symptom--</li>
      <li>As of today (3/7/2011),  WOW, immediate corrections:  </li>
      <li>Still need to use sunblock and take proper precautions, but this stuff helps you heal from the inside, and really makes a difference.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m rather surprised.  </li>
      <li>I have used this product for several years and I highly recommend.</li>
      <li>wasn&#x27;t sealed correctly, wasn&#x27;t stored properly or was old &amp; the seal just gave out.</li>
      <li>I have been using this product for about 5 years and it definitely helps protect your skin if you are frequently in the sun.</li>
      <li>I am red headed and very pale skin and live in very sunny Florida.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I am red headed and very pale skin and live in very sunny Florida. Walking from the car to a building would cause freckling on my skin even with sunscreen, since I have been taking HELIOCARE the problem has minimized and the redness from sun exposure has discontinued.</li>
    <li> Bought this product on a friend&#x27;s recommendation to prevent an allergic reaction I get from sun exposure in the spring and fall (my condition is called PMLE - Polymorphous Light Eruption).  IT REALLY WORKS!!  Without taking Heliocare, I will develop a rash/hives after only 5 minutes of sun exposure.  But one pill daily and...no hives!  I also use Anthelios sunscreen, but often forget to put it on.</li>
    <li> This bottle of capsules did not work as well as the one I bought last year.  Different formula, different crop??  Three people including myself used the first bottle in 3 different states during travels with outstanding sun block results in 2014.  I burned with this bottle.  So disappointed.</li>
    <li> As of today (3/6/2011):  This page does not the cite the active ingredients (just the superfluous stuff) of this version of Heliocare. But it&#x27;s sold via drugstore.com where its relevant page says it contacts strictly the essential Polypodium Leucotomos extract (i.e., Calaguala Leaf extract).    However, the photo on this page shows Biopelle on the box, but the text says \\&quot;product of Spain\\&quot; which would be IFC pharmaceuticals.    UPDATE +++++++++++++++++  As of today (3/7/2011),  WOW, immediate corrections:  Just one day later, the photo has been changed and the ingredients have been fully identified.  Impressive response.</li>
    <li> I hoped this product would help with the sun rash i get in the summer or on holidays,it did not work.I was excited about it but it was a disappointment.</li>
    <li> I have a condition known has Hereditary Coproporphyria. My particular case is so severe that all light, natural or otherwise, causes me neurological and physical symptoms which are rather chronic (seizures, hallucinations, breathing difficulties, unbearable abdominal pain and distention, et cetera).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In all honesty, this supplement makes it easier for me to coexist with my family members who need at least a small amount of light around the house, and even helps with my capacity to leave home on occasion. There is voracious debate in the medical community as to whether or not barrier creams (i.e. sunblock) make any difference, but many other porphyrics also find that anti-oxidant oils and/or barrier creams make a huge impact on quality of life. Mind you, this is not a magic bullet for me in order to have copacetic experiences with light all of the time, but the amount of relief it provides during short-term light exposure is noted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To get down to brass tacks:&lt;br /&gt;  My system is SUPER sensitive to chemicals and other irritants, and Heliocare has caused me not one reaction or symptom-- no abdominal discomfort, no rashes-- nothing at all. While this may not be the case for everyone, it is something to consider. I recall from my research that there are very few pharmaceutical contraindications, but that is something about which you should speak to your physician.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  In addition to its inert presentation to my system-- I no longer suffer severe burns when exposed to light. There are several types of porphyria which have such severe reactions to sunlight that boils and lesions erupt almost immediately, but my mutation does not cause more than very red and sore burns on occasion, e.g I can say with all confidence that, in my case, Heliocare has done that which it has promised.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for several years and I highly recommend. I take one a day during the warmer weather,and two if I&#x27;ll be out in strong sun for longer periods of time. Prevents sun poisoning on my very fair skin. Still need to use sunblock and take proper precautions, but this stuff helps you heal from the inside, and really makes a difference. Traveled to Mexico and avoided all signs of sunburn and sun poisoning and blisters. Made this vacation much more pleasant than most!</li>
    <li> just started taking it, so don&#x27;t know how effective it is</li>
    <li> Package was opened when I received it. Returned it for a full refund but decided not to have it replaced because it didn&#x27;t look as though it was tampered with it just seemed like it either wasn&#x27;t sealed correctly, wasn&#x27;t stored properly or was old &amp; the seal just gave out.</li>
    <li> Since my mother has started taking one a day of these as recommended on the package she has stopped making precancerous skin lesions and stopped  making skin cancer.  It could be coincidental but she has not made any dietary changes and no supplement&lt;br /&gt;changes other than this,  I will continue to buy it. The company advertises it as a strong antioxidant for the skin.</li>
    <li> I am fair skinned and have blue eyes. I also spent my youth baking in the sun and I am now paying the price for that. I have had melanoma and have to be extra careful now. Sure, I slather myself with sunscreen whenever I go outside, even in the winter. I wear long-sleeved shirts, hats and sunglasses. But, I love to be active outdoors. I would hate to have to give up my kayaking or my hiking in order to stay out of the sun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was happy to have learned of this product from a dermatologist. I figured it couldn&#x27;t hurt to give it a try. It contains polypodium leucotomos extract, which is supposed to reduce ultra-violet induced damage of human skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far, it has been effective. My face isn&#x27;t red after spending the day kayaking, nor are my arms.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The real test will be at the end of the summer season. My arms used to have a faint tan, even though I protected them. I am hoping that they will be pale. I will update my review in a few months to give my results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I take one capsule about 30 minutes before I go outside for the day. If I&#x27;m going to be out kayaking or hiking all day, I take another capsule two to three hours after my initial sun exposure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product isn&#x27;t a substitute for sunscreen or for being careful in the sun, but it does help protect you even more against the sun&#x27;s damaging rays.</li>
    <li> BEWARE - Snake Oil!&lt;br /&gt;Started taking these a week before we left on our trip to the Bahamas. I was pretty tan when we left but I wanted a little extra protection. These did hardly anything, if they did anything at all. SPF 10??? No way! I burned after only a couple hours out in the ocean and I&#x27;m still peeling two weeks later.</li>
    <li> One in the am and one in the afternoon.  Sunblock is necessary, but if you miss a spot no severe burn.  Also works to help relieve the burn if you forgot the pills.  Just take one right when you see you burned.</li>
    <li> I take this with me when I go on a vacation where I will be getting a lot of sun.  Although I also use sunscreen, it definitely keeps me from burning.  I only get a slight tan.</li>
    <li> Love this product!  Long history of skin cancers, and since I have been using this supplement for almost three years...I have had zero skin cancers!  Excellent product!  Buy this product from Amazon!!!!</li>
    <li> I bought this product for a vacation in Florida.  I normally burn a bit when I&#x27;m down there, but not this time.  Will purchase it again for next years vacation!</li>
    <li> My dermatologist recommended this.  He&#x27;s pretty traditional and old school.  I&#x27;m open to this type thing.  I sunburn easily.  He said it would be like wearing factor 10 sunscreen every day.  Well he was right.  I found myself outside at the lake this last thanksgiving M&amp;D it was warm and sunny.  No burns.  I&#x27;m rather surprised.  Hs advice was take one every AM and take a 2nd one at lunch if you&#x27;re outside playing golf or fishing, etc.  proof will be this summer, but I need all the help I can get.</li>
    <li> 4 out of 8 reviews on here are not Amazon verified purchases, but possibly for advertising only. I wouldn&#x27;t buy it if I were you.</li>
    <li> i have been using this product for awhile, not sure whether it works or not but I will continue to use it.  No adverse reaction.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for about 5 years and it definitely helps protect your skin if you are frequently in the sun. Great antioxidant for the skin!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for over ten years and it does help me with my problems.  It was and is doctor recommended.</li>
    <li> As an extremely sun sensitive person prone to sun rashes, these definitely help.  They do not replace sunscreen, they just boost your defenses against burning.  The sun is stronger now, whether it&#x27;s from a thinning ozone layer or what, I don&#x27;t know.  I just know that I can&#x27;t handle much sun at all anymore and burn within minutes.  Just don&#x27;t rely on these alone, especially if you&#x27;re going to the beach or vacation to a hot area make sure you wear sunscreen as well.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical but as a blond who spends time sailing in the sun,  i needed something. Pleased to report that after taking heliocare one pill per day then sailing all day also wearing one application of zinc sunscreen for babies, i had no hint of burn whatsoever. That included a swim. Do ramp up an take a pill daily for a week or so before testing it out.</li>
    <li> Help keep you from getting a sunburn recommended by the dermatologist</li>
