      <li>Over the years i have many people ask me where they could get this cologne.</li>
      <li>My all-time favorite fragrance.</li>
      <li>I used to wear this in the 80&#x27;s and bought for nostalgia more than anything.</li>
      <li>The Devin I received was as advertised, store quality, and at a much better price.</li>
      <li>It  is not overbearing as many colognes are.</li>
      <li>My husbands favorite</li>
      <li>My husband and I both love his Devin, so when he was running out</li>
      <li>I love this cologne.  </li>
      <li>Been wearing it for MANY years.</li>
      <li>my husbands favorite deodorant.  </li>
      <li>and such a great price, very pleased</li>
      <li>If you&#x27;re unique and want to stand out from the crowd, you must try this scent !</li>
      <li>It arrived super fast and the price was great.</li>
      <li>Cool!</li>
      <li>Devin is very mild and not offensive to people that i come in contact with.</li>
      <li>the price was even more than what I got it for on special here at amazon.com.</li>
      <li>This product starts off just fine</li>
      <li>but I have to wonder how genuine some of the things are there plus</li>
      <li>It is available from some ebay sellers</li>
      <li>but If you are used to the original smell of Aramis</li>
      <li>Woodsy and rich.</li>
      <li>It is unique among cologne.</li>
      <li>Back then the most popular men&#x27;s cologne&#x27;s were Polo and Halston Z14.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s still good, and maintains enough of the original smell to do the job.</li>
      <li>People enloy the smell since it is so mild.</li>
      <li>If you like a  clean, fresh and crisp  scent this is worth a look.</li>
      <li>Very happy with this Cologne that is getting harder to find locally.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not crazy about.</li>
      <li>smells very nice, little pricey but worth it.</li>
      <li>very thanks</li>
      <li>Most modern day men&#x27;s colognes are too sweet and piercing for my nose, they remind me of toilet bowl cleaner scent.</li>
      <li>I have worked with the same people for many years.</li>
      <li>Like some others, I first heard of this scent when watching the Regis and Kelly show and Bryant Gumbel was substituting for Regis.</li>
      <li>and I am now always ready to impress Kelly if she ever stops in for a chat some morning!</li>
      <li>I purchased something more &#x27;current&#x27; recently (and it wasn&#x27;t cheap).</li>
      <li>I think its the spray that makes it last so long smells good too</li>
      <li>Thanks</li>
      <li>Thanks</li>
      <li>never having smelled it before but really like it.</li>
      <li>Thanks</li>
      <li>This scent fits me very well.</li>
      <li>much smell..</li>
      <li>Compared to \\&quot;regular\\&quot; Aramis, which I find to be very \\&quot;citrusy\\&quot;, \\&quot;Devin\\</li>
      <li>Very Manly</li>
      <li>Devin, like most fine fragerances, typically settles in after a couple hours and becomes more subtle and muscier as it reacts with your body temperature.</li>
      <li>The packaging looks authentic and the scent seems similar enough, but it lacks the depth and musciness of the ones I&#x27;ve purchased retail.</li>
      <li>Used to wear this in high school/college.</li>
      <li>I ordered a new bottle here on Amazon.</li>
      <li>Old Faithful!</li>
      <li>Seems almost like someone took the original and watered it down.</li>
      <li>Purchased for my 86 year old Father for his birthday.</li>
      <li>wow....</li>
      <li>mature cologne</li>
      <li>I have never had a complaint from anyone that it was too strong.</li>
      <li>She is a tough customer, because she does not like most colognes.  </li>
      <li>It is the ONLY cologne to fall under the pure green category.</li>

<li> This cologne lasts forever at least it seems like it still on first bottle I bought 6 years ago</li>
<li> Long lasting, wood tones to it.</li>
<li> Product received as expected.</li>
<li> still have the Aramis sting but not strong enough.</li>
<li> I have other colognes that I wear on other occassions when i go out in the evenings.</li>
<li> &quot; is very dark and brooding, reminding me of wood, leather and pipe tobacco.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s my memory, if this is the &amp;#34;$27 version&amp;#34; or if it&#x27;s a knockoff, but there seems to be  something missing in the scent.</li>
<li> The base notes emerge later, smells to me like a masculine sort of amber.</li>
<li> Something from his past a smell to remember.  </li>
<li> She likes the fragrance, and appreciates that it is not overwhelming.</li>
<li> And as you know they are hard to buy for.</li>
<li> I have been wearing this scent since the late 80&#x27;s.</li>
<li> I looked for it here in Canada and was unable to find it.</li>
<li> Impossible to find in retail stores anymore.</li>

    <li> I wear it daily. This scent fits me very well. Woodsy and rich. The base notes emerge later, smells to me like a masculine sort of amber. Most modern day men&#x27;s colognes are too sweet and piercing for my nose, they remind me of toilet bowl cleaner scent.</li>
    <li> Great find! Purchased for my 86 year old Father for his birthday. Something from his past a smell to remember.  He wore for years. And as you know they are hard to buy for. Thanks</li>
    <li> Used to wear this in high school/college. I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s my memory, if this is the &amp;#34;$27 version&amp;#34; or if it&#x27;s a knockoff, but there seems to be  something missing in the scent. It&#x27;s still good, and maintains enough of the original smell to do the job.</li>
    <li> My husband and I both love his Devin, so when he was running out I ordered a new bottle here on Amazon.</li>
    <li> Maybe my sense of smell has changed. I used to wear this in the 80&#x27;s and bought for nostalgia more than anything. But there is an undertone&lt;br /&gt;that I&#x27;m not crazy about. Like I said..maybe it&#x27;s just me but I don&#x27;t recall that back in the day. I will say..the smell stays with you. I purchased something more &#x27;current&#x27; recently (and it wasn&#x27;t cheap). I can&#x27;t even tell I had anything on after 30 minutes.</li>
    <li> my husbands favorite deodorant.  he&#x27;s been using it for many years</li>
    <li> For over 30 years this is part of my image. Very happy with this Cologne that is getting harder to find locally.</li>
    <li> Got this for my dad. It arrived super fast and the price was great. Thanks</li>
    <li> Great smell, not as strong as the original...</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve worn Devin since it came to market in 1978. Back then the most popular men&#x27;s cologne&#x27;s were Polo and Halston Z14. I found this scent simply because I didn&#x27;t want to smell like everyone else. It is unique among cologne. There is no cross reference in any fragrance guide. When you look up Devin, only Devin appears. It is the ONLY cologne to fall under the pure green category. If you&#x27;re unique and want to stand out from the crowd, you must try this scent !</li>
    <li> SMELLS GREAT, I USED IT SINCE IT FIRST CAME OUT. GOT SOME FROM A DEMO LIKED EVER SINCE.</li>
    <li> I love this cologne.  I have been using Devin for 30 years.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using devin for about 40 years and always make sure I have a bottle.the scent is perfect not too strong</li>
    <li> I do not like the scent.  It is very strong  at the beginning and after while it will be better smell.</li>
    <li> Compared to \\&quot;regular\\&quot; Aramis, which I find to be very \\&quot;citrusy\\&quot;, \\&quot;Devin\\&quot; is very dark and brooding, reminding me of wood, leather and pipe tobacco.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the scent, it stays with me and my wife doesn&#x27;t disapprove. I find many scents to be too floral or too bright in character. This one suits me well. YMMV.</li>
    <li> My wife liked it years ago and now doesn&#x27;t.  Go figure.</li>
    <li> smells very nice, little pricey but worth it. Aramis does it again. Long lasting, wood tones to it. mature cologne</li>
    <li> My husbands favorite no one has it anymore and such a great price, very pleased and I got it in time for Christmas.</li>
    <li> Product received as expected. Thanks</li>
    <li> Like some others, I first heard of this scent when watching the Regis and Kelly show and Bryant Gumbel was substituting for Regis. She always commented on how nice he smelled! I looked for it here in Canada and was unable to find it. It is available from some ebay sellers but I have to wonder how genuine some of the things are there plus the price was even more than what I got it for on special here at amazon.com. I purchased it here on amazon.com never having smelled it before but really like it. My wife too raves about it and I am now always ready to impress Kelly if she ever stops in for a chat some morning!</li>
    <li> Good cologne but If you are used to the original smell of Aramis this won&#x27;t satisfy your taste. still have the Aramis sting but not strong enough.</li>
    <li> The Devin I received was as advertised, store quality, and at a much better price. I am a satisfied customer.</li>
    <li> Cool! Always the Best</li>
    <li> This cologne lasts forever at least it seems like it still on first bottle I bought 6 years ago obviously I don&#x27;t shave every day. I think its the spray that makes it last so long smells good too</li>
    <li> Great product and price and quick shipping.</li>
    <li> Been wearing it for MANY years. Can&#x27;t get it locally anymore. My all-time favorite fragrance.</li>
    <li> wow.... much smell.. so cologne... very thanks</li>
    <li> Great deal for wonderful cologne. If you like a  clean, fresh and crisp  scent this is worth a look.</li>
    <li> I have been using this cologne for 30 years. Impossible to find in retail stores anymore. I use it daily. It  is not overbearing as many colognes are. Devin is very mild and not offensive to people that i come in contact with. Over the years i have many people ask me where they could get this cologne. I have never had a complaint from anyone that it was too strong. I have worked with the same people for many years. Believe me, if it was offensive i would have heard about it. People enloy the smell since it is so mild. I think it has been on the market since the mid seventies. I have other colognes that I wear on other occassions when i go out in the evenings.</li>
    <li> Old Faithful! I had this cologne back in my college years. I&#x27;m glad I found it.</li>
    <li> I Love this aramis product</li>
    <li> I have been wearing this scent since the late 80&#x27;s. The only place I can find it regularly is Macy&#x27;s and the price varies between $45-$60. I saw this listed on Amazon and based on the price/value purchased two bottles. The packaging looks authentic and the scent seems similar enough, but it lacks the depth and musciness of the ones I&#x27;ve purchased retail. Devin, like most fine fragerances, typically settles in after a couple hours and becomes more subtle and muscier as it reacts with your body temperature. This product starts off just fine and then just fades away.  Seems almost like someone took the original and watered it down. Unless the geniune formula has been changed by Aramis, this may be a knock-off.</li>
    <li> Great price, great scent.</li>
    <li> This is how my dad smells...</li>
    <li> I have had several compliments since I started using Devin.  My wife loves it.  She is a tough customer, because she does not like most colognes.  She likes the fragrance, and appreciates that it is not overwhelming. Would definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> This scent reminds me of &amp;#34;Someone I Used to Know&amp;#34;.  Very Manly</li>
</ol>
