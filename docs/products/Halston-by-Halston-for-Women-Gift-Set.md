    <li> My wife thought this product was no longer produced. When it arrived she was amazed, but soon realized the bottle was leaking. Half of the perfume was gone. With one e-mail to Amazon a replacement was on it&#x27;s way. The problem was a factory crimp collar atop the bottle. The crimp was not done properly. Thank you Amazon.</li>
    <li> Love Halston for women; have been wearing it since the year it came out!!</li>
    <li> Halston is an old favorite of mine, has survived the test of time. I find the aroma to be light and pleasing. Most pleased with my purchase.</li>
    <li> I have worn Halston for Women for over 40 years!  It&#x27;s not easy to find anymore which is why I am so grateful I found it on Amazon.com.  Many people compliment me when I&#x27;m wearing it. I layer with body powder, body lotion and cologne.</li>
    <li> The gift sets are a amazing price!!!</li>
