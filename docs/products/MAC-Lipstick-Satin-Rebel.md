<li> my mom worked at MAC for years before becoming an RN, when she gets off work i&#x27;ll be finding out if I received a fake &#x27;&#x27;knock off&#x27;&#x27;, or not.</li>
<li> Lasts a long time.</li>
<li> I was looking for a dark, \\&quot;sort of gothic\\&quot; looking lipstick on my pale NW15 skin without it being *too* dark.  </li>
<li> what a shame, after some investigating i found a lot of other ladies stating they&#x27;re lipsticks were not authentic as well.</li>
<li> (- when my mother stopped by to check out my lipstick, she immediately knew it was not genuine )</li>
<li> I&#x27;m so disappointed!</li>
<li> I&#x27;m disgusted!</li>
<li> This is FAKE!!!!!</li>

    <li> This is FAKE!!!!! do NOT buy this lipstick! I only wear MAC lipstick this is definitely not MAC! I&#x27;m so disappointed!</li>
    <li> I had some issues when placing this order, but in the end those issues were resolved and this present for my mother was delivered in a timely manner and she loved it.</li>
    <li> Gorgeous color for cooler months...looks good on anybody...just make sure to wear a liner as it tends to feather and/or bleed.</li>
    <li> Not the same i choose!</li>
    <li> Goes great with MAC current lip liner, and a similar gloss!!</li>
    <li> I bought this at the MAC counter in my mall, but I loved it so much I had to write a review! It is my FAVORITE lipstick! I saw it on someone and asked what it was and practically ran to the store to buy it! Perfect color, I am fairskinned and blonde and it gives my face the perfect amount of color, it would work for any skin tone! I always get compliments on it!</li>
    <li> I was searching for a nice purple shade.  Someone on pintrest showed a picture of a model with this shade.  Yep, its a purple---you really have to co-ordinate to wear this shade with your clothing.  Its a smooth lipstick that applies nicely and seems to stay on well too!</li>
    <li> I was looking for a dark, \\&quot;sort of gothic\\&quot; looking lipstick on my pale NW15 skin without it being *too* dark.  I think this is the perfect color for that, because it&#x27;s a dark berry fuchsia and incredibly bold, but still looks very classy and sexy, not too gothic.  If you want to go a bit darker, try Cyber.  Great, beautiful, bold color...definitely plan on buying again.</li>
    <li> Gorgeous color and long lasting. Beautiful for fellow WoC.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used MAC for years and this is my favorite color.  Stays on all day long and has a nice matte finish.  I recommend MAC to all the ladies.</li>
    <li> The best color MAC lipstick is rebel. I wear it winter and summer and get many compliments. Stays on very well too.</li>
    <li> smudge inside on lipstick somebody touched it, it smells a lot different than my store bought lippies from MAC. my mom worked at MAC for years before becoming an RN, when she gets off work i&#x27;ll be finding out if I received a fake &#x27;&#x27;knock off&#x27;&#x27;, or not. -god only knows what is put in fakes, harmful, toxic, unsanitary who knows! what a shame, after some investigating i found a lot of other ladies stating they&#x27;re lipsticks were not authentic as well. there&#x27;s either  1 - 2 out of every 5 or so reviews on each &#x27;&#x27;mac&#x27;&#x27; lipstick in their amazon page that say they&#x27;re selling fakes. I&#x27;m disgusted! never buying makeup off of amazon again. (- when my mother stopped by to check out my lipstick, she immediately knew it was not genuine )</li>
    <li> Oh my lord♡ I got my order in today. Literally only 3 days. I can&#x27;t wait to get dolled up and wear it. It&#x27;s so beautiful.  No imitation The real deal♡</li>
    <li> (Note: My friend did not make her purchase on Amazon, she bought at department store.) So, with that said... if this product is truly the Mac Rebel lipstick - then all I can say is... It&#x27;s my favorite lipstick ever. I can&#x27;t believe I haven&#x27;t purchased one for myself yet. I asked to borrow hers every time I hang out with her. The color is awesome. I have blonde hair and green eyes and fair complexion and it looks awesome on me. She has dark brown hair and brown eyes and a fair complexion and it looks great on her. Lasts a long time. Does come off though on your glass and stuff... but I don&#x27;t like that super permanent lipstick very much. So smooth and creamy!</li>
    <li> I loce having this color for your collection. Goes well on many occasions , not too stand outish , noticed for all the right reasons</li>
