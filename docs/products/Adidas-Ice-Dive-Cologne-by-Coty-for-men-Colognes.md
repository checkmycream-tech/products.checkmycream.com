      <li>Its great.</li>
      <li>Like all adidas eau de toilette&#x27;s it smells great;</li>
      <li>in all, this would be a great fragrance for spritzing on before work, or going out with friends, or if your lady friend is visiting and you just don&#x27;t feel like going all out.</li>
      <li>I am happy with this purchase as well.  </li>
      <li>Very nice daytime scent</li>
      <li>but da smell is still very nice</li>
      <li>It is also very nicely priced for a quality cologne.</li>
      <li>Even the smell itself is no as remarkable as you should expect from a brand li Adidas.</li>
      <li>great price smell good</li>
      <li>Good, I sent it to my friend as a gift, he likes it.</li>
      <li>This is being given to my brother-in-law and he like&#x27;s to be smelling good</li>

      <li>i loved the price</li>
      <li>The smell is good</li>
      <li>A good buy.</li>
      <li>Good</li>
      <li>THE PRICE AND SIZE GOOD.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s an excellent cologne despite of their cheap price and well known trademark.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>Very refreshing, not overpowering at all.</li>
      <li>He smells really great and sexy too.</li>
      <li>Its kind of spicy, and gets its fair share of praises, when worn.</li>
      <li>What more can a guy want?!</li>
      <li>Nice.  </li>
      <li>Dates, friends, at work, at the club, just out of the shower.. just need something to smell nice.  </li>
      <li>, it&#x27;s really nice.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s like purchasing a Mini Cooper and expecting it to keep pace with a Ferrari, Mini Coopers are nice cars, but they&#x27;re not Ferraris; apples and oranges.&lt;br</li>
      <li>For that kind of scenario, I can recommend this Adidas scent.  </li>
      <li>Kind of spicy,</li>
      <li>i Liked The Name \\&quot;Ice Dive\\&quot;....</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s cheap, smells good, and gets the job done if you&#x27;re just looking to smell nice going out the door without expecting to impress anyone.</li>
      <li>Good light scent.</li>
      <li>but I wouldn&#x27;t give it any more time than that.</li>
      <li>so I am sure he will like it .</li>
      <li>many compliments</li>
      <li>The girls absolutely love it, and there is nothing I can complain about.</li>
      <li>Its about ok smell.</li>
      <li>just ok, guess you get what you pay for.</li>
      <li>I plan on buying 3 more bottles.</li>
      <li>You will love this one guys.</li>
      <li>It has a nice, clean scent and isn&#x27;t overpowering.</li>
      <li>1- its more of a every day cologne wit a not so strong smell</li>
      <li>/&gt;Instead of a body splash, this cheap cologne smells nice and leaves me feeling clean after the body wash scent has faded from the shower.  </li>
      <li>And smells fresh but not as good as Fresh Impact.</li>
      <li>Admired By All &amp; Easy on The Pocket...</li>
      <li>The product is very good, and didn&#x27;t take long time to deliver to my home.</li>
      <li>The Adidas colognes are alcohol based, which means they are cheap to produce and therefore purchase.</li>
      <li>Even the cheap fragrances have their purpose.</li>
      <li>I alway like adidas products, this are a good one, I will buy more in my next shoop of colognes.</li>
      <li>But it sure does live up to that Name :)</li>
      <li>Cheap, smells good, wears off smooth, lasts a long time.</li>
      <li>If you are looking for a scent to wear daily that smells good but isn&#x27;t overpowering this one will work.</li>
      <li>For full day coverage you probably need three mists every eight hours.</li>
      <li>GENUINE AND HONEST SELLER, SUPER FAST SHIPPING, HIGHLY RECOMMENDED, AAA+++</li>
      <li>Fresh and clean are the words that describe it.</li>
      <li>I love the smell of this, and i overall love the product itself</li>
      <li>Many other times I just want to smell nice, be it to combat with body odors of myself or others or whatever reason, and in those cases you don&#x27;t want to use your $100 bottle of Obsession.  </li>
      <li>Highly recommended!!!</li>
      <li>OBVIOUSLY this is not something you would get for someone over the age of 17, but it DOES smell nice.</li>
      <li>That&#x27;s a bit of a broad list, but I can smell the citrus and amber for sure.</li>
      <li>As a man who is used to high end fragrances, I can say if want something cheap that smells</li>
      <li>I like Nautica Competiton, Swiss Army Altitude, Cool Water, Swiss Army Classic, and this!</li>
      <li>great for a younger person present who likes adidas, smells like $10 cologne</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using this Ice Dive as more in the need of the last two.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Highly Recommended !!</li>
      <li>Purchased this as a gift for my son, its exactly what he was looking for.</li>
      <li>Plan to order a re-stock pretty soon .</li>
      <li>This is my first bottle of this after trying another Adidas scent.  </li>
      <li>I add these perfumes that are fun by the economic price</li>
      <li>I recommend this for a man who wants to turn on his date/wife!</li>
      <li>Good for everyday use.</li>
      <li>Overall, I&#x27;d say it has a nice smell for a cheap cologne and is worth getting if you plan on using it everyday and using it up quickly.</li>
      <li>It was a much bigger bottle than I expected, great value for the price.</li>
      <li>My 4 year old son hugged me last night and smelled it on my shirt and had to keep smelling because he liked it.  </li>
      <li>he goes a little faster but the smell is actually a good perfume and does not smell bad like water is fresh and youthful perfect</li>
      <li>It kind of fades out within 2-3 hours so not a long lasting one.</li>
      <li>Despite being an alcohol based cologne, it doesn&#x27;t smell artificial to me which is impressive.</li>
      <li>We both really like it.</li>
      <li>Thanks Jose</li>
      <li>, this is a \\&quot;cologne\\&quot; you really need to take at face value.</li>
      <li>One  of my absolute favorites .</li>
      <li>I have tried all the Adidas for men and this is by far my favorite because of the citrus, fruity sporty scent but the sprayer now just shoots out a stream rather then an equal spray</li>
      <li>It is big enough to use frequently, and has a unique scent that has gotten me many compliments.</li>
      <li>This fragrance is cheap in price, rich in scent and lasts long enough.</li>
      <li>Over all, it&#x27;s nice, good for someone young, especially someone who is heavy on the spraying and wants something that smells like your average 13 year old&#x27;s &#x27;Axe attack&#x27; but not overpowering.</li>
      <li>I have been using this particular cologne for years.</li>
      <li>I use this everyday and it really is a nice masculine fragrance  .</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not a particularly special scent, but it&#x27;s clean and crisp and really does have an \\&quot;icy\\&quot; scent to it</li>
      <li>Not bad in any way, it&#x27;s crisp and clean smelling, just not original enough to be that signature smell.</li>

    <li> I have colognes for all occasions.  Dates, friends, at work, at the club, just out of the shower.. just need something to smell nice.  I&#x27;ve been using this Ice Dive as more in the need of the last two.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Instead of a body splash, this cheap cologne smells nice and leaves me feeling clean after the body wash scent has faded from the shower.  Many other times I just want to smell nice, be it to combat with body odors of myself or others or whatever reason, and in those cases you don&#x27;t want to use your $100 bottle of Obsession.  For that kind of scenario, I can recommend this Adidas scent.  If you&#x27;re looking for a signature date-scent, don&#x27;t waste your time on this though.  It smells sterotypical and un-unique.  Not bad in any way, it&#x27;s crisp and clean smelling, just not original enough to be that signature smell.</li>
    <li> It wont give any fragrance , but will stop the body odor with a small fragrance.</li>
    <li> Not too strong, not too subtle. For the price, one of the best colognes you can get. It&#x27;s got a fresh kick with a subtle sweetness and citrus scent behind it. Good for everyday use.</li>
    <li> had a great smell for a great price- i got some $50 and $60 cologne and my girl loves dis 1- its more of a every day cologne wit a not so strong smell but da smell is still very nice</li>
    <li> THE PRICE AND SIZE GOOD. BUT DON&#x27;T LAST NOTHING IN YOUR BODY. I AM DISAPPOINTED WITH THIS BUT I WILL TRY OTHER ADIDAS MAYBE WILL BE DIFFERENT</li>
    <li> Cologne arrived as advertised. I have been using this particular cologne for years. The girls absolutely love it, and there is nothing I can complain about.</li>
    <li> I would not recommend it to any buyer. The smell does not last for more than half an hour. Even the smell itself is no as remarkable as you should expect from a brand li Adidas. I felt very disappointed.</li>
    <li> This is my first bottle of this after trying another Adidas scent.  I am happy with this purchase as well.  Great Value!  Smells Nice.  My 4 year old son hugged me last night and smelled it on my shirt and had to keep smelling because he liked it.  I&#x27;ll probably try a different Adidas scent the next time around because there are a lot of choices, but I would buy this again!</li>
    <li> This smells awesome. It&#x27;s subtle, but does make me think of water / ice. Some of the other Adidas fragrances smell like alcohol, but not this scent. I will wear it as a cologne, but it would also work throughout the day to just give one that \\&quot;fresh\\&quot; feel/smell. At its current retail, you really can&#x27;t go wrong. I paid $12 today at an outlet mall, so Amazon beats even that. I&#x27;m a woman that usually wears men&#x27;s fragrances... I like Nautica Competiton, Swiss Army Altitude, Cool Water, Swiss Army Classic, and this! Hope this helps someone...</li>
    <li> I alway like adidas products, this are a good one, I will buy more in my next shoop of colognes.</li>
    <li> is just perfect for the price you are paying! You will love this one guys. And ladies.. you will not resist!</li>
    <li> Product was listed as Aftershave - not Eau de Toillet. My husband only likes the aftershave.  Advertisement was misleading. We gave the product to a friend.</li>
    <li> Like the scent. Its great.</li>
    <li> This fragrance is cheap in price, rich in scent and lasts long enough. I use it before going to class, parties, or even walking around. It is big enough to use frequently, and has a unique scent that has gotten me many compliments. It seems to wear off in 20-30 minutes.</li>
    <li> Highly recommended!!! I needed a sport or daily cologne for work and this one fits my need! Like it so far, it smells like an expensive one</li>
    <li> I love the smell of this, and i overall love the product itself</li>
    <li> Bought this for daily use. It kind of fades out within 2-3 hours so not a long lasting one. But I like the fragrance.</li>
    <li> Purchased this as a gift for my son, its exactly what he was looking for.</li>
    <li> My girlfriend got this cologne for me a year ago for Christmas. It has a nice, clean scent and isn&#x27;t overpowering. We both really like it. Like I said, I&#x27;ve had it for a year, and I must say that it has lost its potency. I use it nearly everyday, and I&#x27;ve noticed that I can spray myself 5-10 times, but when I got right over to my girlfriend&#x27;s house I will ask her how I smell and she says she doesn&#x27;t notice anything. I&#x27;ll even smell myself and stick my shirt in my face and can only smell a very faint trace of it. It&#x27;s also worth adding that I haven&#x27;t exposed it to any extreme conditions. It just sits in my medicine cabinet. Overall, I&#x27;d say it has a nice smell for a cheap cologne and is worth getting if you plan on using it everyday and using it up quickly.</li>
    <li> At this point I can&#x27;t see what I did, but I never thought of ordering Adidas cologne.  What I wanted, and thought I had ordered, was Adidas after shave. Who made the mistake?  Since I can&#x27;t prove otherwise, I&#x27;ll accept it as mine. It&#x27;s not my intention to return anything.</li>
    <li> As a man who is used to high end fragrances, I can say if want something cheap that smells good Adidas is your fragrance!  I plan on buying 3 more bottles.</li>
    <li> just ok, guess you get what you pay for. Its about ok smell. will not be purchasing perfurmes online anymore.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s an excellent cologne despite of their cheap price and well known trademark.&lt;br /&gt;I have been using for years and it is one of my favorites.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend 100%</li>
    <li> product was as described, it was delivered on time and no complaints about anything in the process.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love adidas, its a a time tested product and nothing has really ever gone wrong with it</li>
    <li> The only thing that i didn´t like it was the tape on the box, Looks like very old.</li>
    <li> Provided that I buy any item for Amazon.com I add these perfumes that are fun by the economic price and they help me a lot to the pocket. Obviously to use every day, since does not persist too much the aroma. Thanks Jose</li>
    <li> Choose to give it only two stars because it said item was brand new and it didn&#x27;t look like it at all</li>
    <li> I Ordered this Perfume just Becoz i Liked The Name \\&quot;Ice Dive\\&quot;....But it sure does live up to that Name :)&lt;br /&gt;Amazing Fragrance, Admired By All &amp; Easy on The Pocket...Great Purchase!!!&lt;br /&gt;5 Stars...Highly Recommended !!</li>
    <li> I bought as a gift. The smell is good and I think this perfume should be used during the day. It worths the price. I recommend it.</li>
    <li> This is being given to my brother-in-law and he like&#x27;s to be smelling good so I am sure he will like it .</li>
    <li> The product is very good, and didn&#x27;t take long time to deliver to my home.</li>
    <li> Scent lasts about 3 hours.</li>
    <li> This is not a high end scent.  If you are looking for a scent to wear daily that smells good but isn&#x27;t overpowering this one will work.</li>
    <li> Good light scent. Very refreshing, not overpowering at all. I am another who chose it because of the name. For full day coverage you probably need three mists every eight hours. Overall recommended for casual use. I am happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> great price smell good</li>
    <li> It was a much bigger bottle than I expected, great value for the price. I would purchase again at anytime.</li>
    <li> The box wasn&#x27;t sealed, but what&#x27;s worse is the bottle cap wasn&#x27;t on correctly, making it obvious that someone had opened it!</li>
    <li> Good, I sent it to my friend as a gift, he likes it.</li>
    <li> i got this as a simple bday gift 4 my 15 year old n he loves it. i loved the price</li>
    <li> Smells good and affordable to wear while out at the gym.</li>
    <li> Very good, I use it almost every day. I get complimented on my smell and avoid unwanted ones. A good buy.</li>
    <li> he goes a little faster but the smell is actually a good perfume and does not smell bad like water is fresh and youthful perfect</li>
    <li> I bought this fragrance for my husband. He smells really great and sexy too. It&#x27;s a little strong when it first is applied but the smell tames down after awhile. I recommend this for a man who wants to turn on his date/wife!</li>
    <li> El producto llego perfecto, y en buen estado,  es exactamente lo que quería muchas gracias.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;los productos adidas don buenos</li>
    <li> I highly recommend this product. Fresh and clean are the words that describe it. It is also very nicely priced for a quality cologne.</li>
    <li> great for a younger person present who likes adidas, smells like $10 cologne</li>
    <li> It last quite long for me. And smells fresh but not as good as Fresh Impact. I can smell it of the shirt when I remove it even in the evening.</li>
    <li> I am simply amazed by this cologne&#x27;s smell. Its kind of spicy, and gets its fair share of praises, when worn. Definitely try. I tried Adidas Move in the past, but was allergic to it, now this one rocks</li>
    <li> Cheap, smells good, wears off smooth, lasts a long time. What more can a guy want?!</li>
    <li> I bought this as a gift for my 13 year old brother. OBVIOUSLY this is not something you would get for someone over the age of 17, but it DOES smell nice. Kind of spicy, a little sweet, think of AXE except a little nicer and not as violently in-your-face gym class smell. Over all, it&#x27;s nice, good for someone young, especially someone who is heavy on the spraying and wants something that smells like your average 13 year old&#x27;s &#x27;Axe attack&#x27; but not overpowering.</li>
    <li> Like all adidas eau de toilette&#x27;s it smells great; however the draw back is that it&#x27;s staying power is terrible, which is to be expected since it&#x27;s and eau de toilette and not parfume, but still, even to that end it&#x27;s staying power is weak.</li>
    <li> I use this everyday and it really is a nice masculine fragrance  . Plan to order a re-stock pretty soon .</li>
    <li> GENUINE AND HONEST SELLER, SUPER FAST SHIPPING, HIGHLY RECOMMENDED, AAA+++</li>

    <li> Excelente producto. Gracias</li>
    <li> I have tried all the Adidas for men and this is by far my favorite because of the citrus, fruity sporty scent but the sprayer now just shoots out a stream rather then an equal spray so I have to spray it on my wrists of hand and rub it in. Other then that this ones a winner!</li>
    <li> Good but wish the fragrance would have stayed longer</li>
    <li> I think the user Tate put it the best, this is a \\&quot;cologne\\&quot; you really need to take at face value. It&#x27;s cheap, smells good, and gets the job done if you&#x27;re just looking to smell nice going out the door without expecting to impress anyone. The Adidas colognes are alcohol based, which means they are cheap to produce and therefore purchase. 3.4 ounces of ANY cologne costs three times this price if not more. Alcohol based colognes don&#x27;t have the longevity of \\&quot;legitimate\\&quot; colognes because of the ingredients. I would vouch any reviews for this two stars or less probably need to lower their expectations. It&#x27;s like purchasing a Mini Cooper and expecting it to keep pace with a Ferrari, Mini Coopers are nice cars, but they&#x27;re not Ferraris; apples and oranges.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That being said, I picked this up for eight bucks at a local Marshalls (sorry Amazon, I&#x27;m a good customer though I swear!) and for the price, you can&#x27;t beat 3.4 ounces of this stuff. It&#x27;s not a particularly special scent, but it&#x27;s clean and crisp and really does have an \\&quot;icy\\&quot; scent to it, it&#x27;s really nice. Despite being an alcohol based cologne, it doesn&#x27;t smell artificial to me which is impressive. The notes that Amazon has listed are citrus, greens, and amber. That&#x27;s a bit of a broad list, but I can smell the citrus and amber for sure. Ice Dive is a well put together fragrance without being \\&quot;sporty\\&quot;, I would say Ice Dive could be worn whenever for any occasion. The longevity is alright, maybe three, four hours if you spray it appropriately on hot spots like the neck, wrists and dab it behind the ears but I wouldn&#x27;t give it any more time than that. But with a 3.4 oz bottle for less than ten dollars there&#x27;s really no need to be stingy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, this would be a great fragrance for spritzing on before work, or going out with friends, or if your lady friend is visiting and you just don&#x27;t feel like going all out. Even the cheap fragrances have their purpose. This one happens to smell very good to boot!!</li>
    <li> Just what my son wanted.!</li>
    <li> Very nice daytime scent many compliments</li>
    <li> gives me a headache. smells really cheap unlike other adidas colognes</li>
