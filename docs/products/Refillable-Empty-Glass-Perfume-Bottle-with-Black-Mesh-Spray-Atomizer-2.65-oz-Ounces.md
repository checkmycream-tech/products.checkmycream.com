      <li>I LOVE TO MAKE MY OWN LIP GLOSS, AND</li>
      <li>Make sure your perfume bottle has a screw top before purchase, otherwise you will lose your mind trying to spray it in n wasting some of the mist etc etc.</li>
      <li>I love mine.</li>
      <li>It was perfect for the last of my husband&#x27;s cologne.  </li>
      <li>For a low price, this is excellent!</li>
      <li>cause it was his favorite fragrance.</li>
      <li>The puff piece was cute</li>
      <li>Spray works very well and bottle looks great sitting on my shelf.</li>
      <li>I should have taken heed when another reviewer wrote that the funnel wasn&#x27;t included, but I figured that since the description explicity stated that included were \\&quot;a dropper and funnel for easy filling,\\</li>
      <li>It was easy to fill and use.</li>
      <li>One gripe is that it wasn&#x27;t easy to transfer the perfume into it even with the mini funnel and pipette.</li>
      <li>I would not recommend this product for anyone who does need a fine mist (i.e., perfume, setting makeup, etc).</li>
      <li>It shipped well, and quickly!</li>
      <li>The bottle looks elegant and the colored atomizer spray was very pretty.</li>

      <li>The volume was perfect for the amount of fragrance I had left, and it works well enough.</li>
      <li>The atomiser doesn&#x27;t really produce a strong, even mist like a high-quality fragrance bottle does, but it is sufficient.</li>
      <li>When i filled it up and started using it, the spray was a bit airy and not too much comes out like</li>
      <li>Uncomplicated, simple and would look nice in any bathroom or on any dressing table.</li>
      <li>but this is really cute and has that retro, but classy feel to it.</li>
      <li>I think the bottle is pretty cool looking, it&#x27;s a mix between feminine and masculine for a bottle, which describes the scent of my manly fruit scented cologne :)</li>
      <li>Comes with a tiny funnel, but honestly it&#x27;s easier to pour by hand.</li>
      <li>He likes it and it sprays just the right amount.</li>
      <li>I use mine as decoation more than I do an actual atomizer.</li>
      <li>This perfume atomizer is exactly what I needed.  </li>
      <li>but when you spray it, it&#x27;s a little airy instead of a super vaporized mist of cologne which is no big deal because less is better than more when you have a strong cologne!</li>
      <li>I prefer essential oil and that clogs up sprayer pretty quick.</li>
      <li>So rather than buy a whole new bottle of perfume, I opted for this.</li>
      <li>It makes a high pitched airy noise when you spray though.</li>
      <li>When using this item, it spits speckles of product instead of creating the fine mist expected of an atomizer.</li>
      <li>The bottle is adorably and perfectly round.</li>
      <li>My wife had a perfume atomizer filled with her favorite (and expensive) perfume.  </li>
      <li>We bought the item (looks exactly as pictured) as a gift for a female employee and was surprised to see the additional goodies below included.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I needed an atomizer that would hold at least 2 ounces of my favorite perfume.</li>
      <li>&quot; maybe they updated the product to now include these vital pieces.</li>
      <li>It looks pretty on my counter &amp; make the cologne go a long way</li>
      <li>Bought some splash cologne without sprayer, very economical but waste a lot splashing on</li>
      <li>Love this bottle, use it basically everyday, now to get the perfume in the bottle is the trick, wish it came with the little funnel which I got with another item</li>
      <li>The spray is not as fine and misted as a lot of other perfume bottles I have tried in the past, but if you are looking for heavier application this product works well.</li>

    <li> I bought this item because both my husband and myself had fragrances that we couldn&#x27;t use, because he dropped his bottled and the sprayer jammed, and mines just stopped spraying. So that is when of thought of getting the Atomizers, my husband was extremely delighted be cause it was his favorite fragrance. The size was perfect and was surprised to have received a funnel with each. I would definitely recommend this products to any one. It was a gift for Father&#x27;s Day so I expedited shipping to receive it in time and I got it way earlier than expected.</li>
    <li> When using this item, it spits speckles of product instead of creating the fine mist expected of an atomizer. For my purposes, I can still use it, but it&#x27;s not nearly as pleasant as a proper mist would be. I would not recommend this product for anyone who does need a fine mist (i.e., perfume, setting makeup, etc). Actually, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product at all, buy one that functions as it should!</li>
    <li> I broke a bottle for  a really expensive perfum soo i needed a new bottle.  This bottle shipped fast and it was in perfect condition when it got here.  They even had a little note on the inside that was hand written and said thank you.  I had a really great experience and the bottle works great!</li>
    <li> It was perfect for the last of my husband&#x27;s cologne.  The puff piece was cute but when you spray it, it&#x27;s a little airy instead of a super vaporized mist of cologne which is no big deal because less is better than more when you have a strong cologne!</li>
    <li> Perfect for using up small amounts of oils. The spray is not as fine and misted as a lot of other perfume bottles I have tried in the past, but if you are looking for heavier application this product works well.</li>
    <li> I LOVE TO MAKE MY OWN LIP GLOSS, AND ESSENTIAL OILS AND THIS LITTLE BOTTLES ARE NOT FOR WHAT I DO.THEY LEAK VERY BAD</li>
    <li> I purchased the perfume bottle for a gift for someone in my family.  The bottle looks elegant and the colored atomizer spray was very pretty.</li>
    <li> The bottle is adorably and perfectly round. It shipped well, and quickly! Sadly not much perfume comes out, and the straw that sets in the center is too long, but that&#x27;s easily fixed!</li>
    <li> We put perfume from larger containers into this little gem.  It&#x27;s just like the one Grandma used to have, and difficult to find on the local market.</li>
    <li> Excellent product with fine mist sprayer.  Bought some splash cologne without sprayer, very economical but waste a lot splashing on so did a search for a refillable bottle. It looks pretty on my counter &amp; make the cologne go a long way</li>
    <li> I bought this because my daughter knocked over a bottle of my Jimmy Choo perfume and broke the sprayer. So rather than buy a whole new bottle of perfume, I opted for this. I should have taken heed when another reviewer wrote that the funnel wasn&#x27;t included, but I figured that since the description explicity stated that included were \\&quot;a dropper and funnel for easy filling,\\&quot; maybe they updated the product to now include these vital pieces. Silly me!&lt;br /&gt;I tried to contact customer service by clicking the link (while leaving feedback), but the only option is a refund. I don&#x27;t want to go through the hassle. Just send me what I paid for! Ugh...</li>
    <li> This perfume atomizer is exactly what I needed.  I was given a gift of perfume and the bottle was not a spray.  It was so annoying.  So I found this little perfume atomizer and it&#x27;s just perfect.</li>
    <li> My wife had a perfume atomizer filled with her favorite (and expensive) perfume.  However, the atomizer was broken.  By removing the broken atomizer and transferring the contents to the Refillable Empty Glass Perfume Bottle, I was able to salvage the perfume.  Note: I used set of three small metal funnels to effect the transfer.</li>
    <li> Bought a few of these bottles so that I could transfer perfume from bottles that were aerosol propelled.  No more perfume getting stuck in my nose. &amp; no more headaches.</li>
    <li> I love mine. I use mine as decoation more than I do an actual atomizer. I prefer essential oil and that clogs up sprayer pretty quick. but this is really cute and has that retro, but classy feel to it.</li>
    <li> Bottle is beautiful, great quality. Spray works very well and bottle looks great sitting on my shelf. Thank you again.</li>
    <li> perfume evaporated out of bottle during travel! 120 perfume :( as long as your not traveling its a really nice bottle!</li>
    <li> I bought it for my friend so he can pour the rest of his cologne in this because he broke the cap to his cologne. He likes it and it sprays just the right amount. For a low price, this is excellent! I really like the cute squeezy thing I probably will just buy a lot for myself and transfer all my perfumes in these things! I dont like the heavy glass the perfume comes in.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t put anything in it as yet but I like the look and feel.  Uncomplicated, simple and would look nice in any bathroom or on any dressing table.</li>
    <li> I do not like that I am required to write a long review.  You should not required a long written review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love the product.</li>
    <li> Bought da lady perfume. Only to have the squirt portion break during use.&lt;br /&gt;The local department store would not take it back, some crazy policy..&lt;br /&gt;Removed the cap off the broken perfume bottle, poured the content in&lt;br /&gt;the new bottle, via the enclosed funnel.. Works like a charm..</li>
    <li> Nice perfume bottle, I am glade I order it .</li>
    <li> I broke the atomizer on a perfume bottle so bought this to replace it. The volume was perfect for the amount of fragrance I had left, and it works well enough. The atomiser doesn&#x27;t really produce a strong, even mist like a high-quality fragrance bottle does, but it is sufficient.</li>
    <li> I needed an atomizer that would hold at least 2 ounces of my favorite perfume. It was easy to fill and use.</li>
    <li> So i got this for my Kenneth Cole Reaction after shave, which doesn&#x27;t come with a spray, and i wanted to use it as cologne. When i filled it up and started using it, the spray was a bit airy and not too much comes out like someone else said but i prefer it that way. I think the bottle is pretty cool looking, it&#x27;s a mix between feminine and masculine for a bottle, which describes the scent of my manly fruit scented cologne :) It makes a high pitched airy noise when you spray though.</li>
    <li> Comes with a tiny funnel, but honestly it&#x27;s easier to pour by hand. Sprays well and looks great!</li>
    <li> We bought the item (looks exactly as pictured) as a gift for a female employee and was surprised to see the additional goodies below included.&lt;br /&gt;- Chrome screw on spill/travel cap&lt;br /&gt;- Black Mesh storage/travel bag&lt;br /&gt;- Opaque plastic funnel&lt;br /&gt;Had we known ahead of time, we would have gotten 3 additional sets to give away to other employees and family members throughout the year.</li>
    <li> I had a defective spray on a perfume bottle and this worked perfect.  Came with a funnel and an eye dropper type thing.</li>
    <li> Love this bottle, use it basically everyday, now to get the perfume in the bottle is the trick, wish it came with the little funnel which I got with another item so I was luckily. Make sure your perfume bottle has a screw top before purchase, otherwise you will lose your mind trying to spray it in n wasting some of the mist etc etc.</li>
    <li> I like the way it looks and it works great! One gripe is that it wasn&#x27;t easy to transfer the perfume into it even with the mini funnel and pipette.</li>
