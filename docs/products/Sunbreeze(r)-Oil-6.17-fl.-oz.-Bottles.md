      <li>It only takes a little, so the price is good.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Great massage oil. It is magical</li>
    <li> Lovr this product for headaches, toothaches or what ails you! Fast delivery and comp priced</li>
    <li> I HAVE PURCHASED THIS PRODUCT A FEW YEAR AGO.  THE POTENCY HAS CHANGED (NOT A STRONG AS  BEFORE). WOULD LIKE SUNBREEZE TO GO BACK TO ORIGINAL FORMULA.</li>
    <li> A drop in the palm and inhaling for a few times clears a cold on the spot.</li>
    <li> perfect for sinus congestion, headaches, and migraines.  Just either rub a little on your temple or right under your nose.&lt;br /&gt;you can also drop in hot water and just breathe in the aroma</li>
    <li> have used this for years, topically, for relief of headaches. it is effective and safe and smells good too! could not get it locally any more and was delighted when i found it available from Amazon. I thank you and so does my head !</li>
    <li> Very good product. relieves headache and puts me to sleep quite easily. Would highly recommend. Expensive product, but works well.</li>
    <li> This is a regular staple for all things sinus related in our home!</li>
    <li> This product is great for clearing up sinus&#x27; and headaches!  I have used it for years.&lt;br /&gt;I carry a bottle with me wherever I go.</li>
    <li> Very soon, very well, I will always use it, thank you</li>
    <li> Provides warmth and comfort for arthritic neck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It may not heal but it feels good. I like it a lot</li>
    <li> This product works very well relieving tight muscles.  It would be easier to apply with a roll-on applicator.</li>
    <li> Not quite as strong as before, but otherwise ok</li>
    <li> I love this oil - the smell starts out quite potent then flashes off to a lovely citrus.  I use it to ease breathing because Albuterol no longer works for my asthma. I put 2 drops of oil on the palm of my hand, vigorously rub my hands together to release the volatile oils and inhale from my cupped palms. It works beautifully.</li>
    <li> Great stuff! I keep it on hand for bug bites and heartburn.  It works miracles.</li>
    <li> Sun Breeze does so many things.  You can use it for many ailments.  I have used it for many years and am glad it is available here on Amazon.  I highly recommend you use it.  It will open your sinuses, stop a runny nose, stop a headache, soothe an upset stomach, ease muscle and joint pain, ease a toothache, and lots of other stuff.  It only takes a little, so the price is good.  One little bottle lasts a long time.  I also really like the balm, probably more than the liquid but the liquid is faster acting.  Warning:don&#x27;t touch your eyes and certain other body parts with it on your hands!</li>
    <li> have used SunBreeze for years to soothe musceles at temple and back of neck area and it&#x27;s great for opening up stuffy noses</li>
    <li> My mother started using sunbreeze 15 years ago. She used to sell it along with other herbs made by the same company. My sisters friend had spilled hot tea on her legs when she was in high school. Her parents were out of town so she called my mom. My mom and sister went over to her home to help her. My mom stayed up all night spraying sunbreeze mixed with cool water on her legs. When they got there she had third degree burns and blisters on her legs. The next morning the blisters were gone, Amazing! This is a great product. Therese no surprise that it has healing powers from an herbal recipe that&#x27;s very old.</li>
    <li> A colleague of mine gave the last drop of her Sunbreeze to me when I had a headache. It smells great and it&#x27;s effective. This is so concentrated that you need a dab to clear your sinus.</li>
    <li> I have used Sun Breeze for over 20 years. I got my new shipment today &amp; not only does it look  diluted but it smells diluted. WHAT HAPPENED TO THE ORIGINAL PRODUCT? I would be happy to pay more just so I could have the original. Shame on the company for a cheaper/less effective product if I was concerned about price &amp; knew this was soooo diluted I would have gotten a jar of mentholatum!!!</li>
    <li> Working good for anything of painful coughs, headaches, out of joint...!</li>
    <li> Wonderful product. Will buy again.</li>
    <li> Put a single drop on your palm. rub palms together, and cup over mouth and nose and breath deeply!!&lt;br /&gt;I really love this oil!!!</li>
    <li> Excellent oil for minor aches &amp; pains</li>
    <li> Service and product excellent  Couldn&#x27;t get along without it in Michigan winters.  Thank you.&lt;br /&gt;I use for headache or congestion or muscle aches.</li>
    <li> No, I literally mean that it truly is a miracle oil. It heals all kinds of aches, sores, sunburns, pain and it is all natural. No more Ibuprofen or Aleve here! If you don&#x27;t know about this product, look it up online. It can be used for countless holistic healing options.</li>
    <li> Recommended to friends and they love them because the oil is not fake and the smell is not too strong like my eucaluptic vietnamese oil. Price is wonderful too. Bought this product many time.</li>
    <li> Great product. Works for migraines,</li>
    <li> I have used Sunbreeze Oil for the last 25 years. Got muscular aches and pains, a headache? - Sunbreeze soothes them away.  Got a blocked nose? Sunbreeze will help you breath easily again (and keep your airways open longer and better than some harmful nasal sprays!) Starting to get a sore throat? One drop of Sunbreeze on your tongue will help.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I made one little bottle last 20+ years - because I didn&#x27;t know how or where to find a replacement.  I am soooo pleased I recently found Sunrider International all over again and don&#x27;t have to be stingy using it anymore.  Now I have a bottle next to my bed, in my handbag, one kept in my drawer at work. And will reorder long before I ever run out again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is just one of many quality products I am now a lifelong customer for!</li>
    <li> I think they diluted their recipe. It used to be very strong, now it is not worth it. I was very disappointed since I bought it from a friend as well. I found something else</li>
    <li> Will never be without this oil. It could replace every other item in my medicine chest. Been using it for 18 years and plan to keep on as long as the quality remains the same.</li>
    <li> Thank you finaly recieved two weeks after I contacted about shipment. I love &amp; use this often.</li>
    <li> this Oil essence is helpful for allergies and skin and deep rub for sores.  It can be used for so many thing.  It is the multi use natural combination of oils that rejuvenate the senses.</li>
    <li> This oil works great and I would recommend it to promote healing of cuts, bruises, and sore muscles. I use just one drop on the affected area twice a day. I do not care for the strong scent. I apply it outside on the porch and conceal the scent with baby lotion since my family complained.</li>
    <li> Weird, but....I just found this in my travel bag and have no idea where I got it or how long ago it may have been. My neck was stiff from driving several hours today in the rain, and I happened to run across Sunbreeze Essential Oil when I was putting things away. I researched it online and here it is at Amazon! Put it on my neck where it was so stiff, and it warmed it up right away. I definitely think it will help me sleep tonight. I have some similar products from other companies that are carried right here on Amazon. Some have mentioned the strength not being the same - they may have lightened up on the eucalyptus because some people are allergic to it. OR it could be that the longer you keep this stuff the stronger it gets!  Anyway, this is going right back in my travel bag the next time I&#x27;m going out of town! I am a great believer in Essential Oils!!</li>
    <li> I use this essential oil for several of my massage therapy clients... for colds/coughs/congestion.... inhalation therapy/aromatherapy... and I put some in my daughter&#x27;s humidifier when she&#x27;s a snotty mess!</li>
    <li> I have used Sunbreeze oil for almost 20 years. We use it for opening sinuses and sore throats. Use it on tight chests during colds. Also great healer for burns.</li>
    <li> Great product, can&#x27;t live with out it during cold season. Also works great for helping to relax when you have a head ache.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for 28 years.  Relieves pain, relieves headaches, great for bites.  It&#x27;s so good!</li>
    <li> We have been using this product for 25 years and still love it.</li>
    <li> Very satisfied doing exactly what I wanted it to do</li>
    <li> was advised by a friend who suffered from the same problem and was satisfied with the good result using this&lt;br /&gt;pruduct.</li>
    <li> Sunbreeze Oil is a great product that clears my throat and keeps me from coughing.  I carry it with me in case a coughing spell comes up.</li>
    <li> Love It.. Have Been Using It for Joint Pain for 13 Years Now..</li>
    <li> Sunbreeze is my favorite oil blend.  I use it when I&#x27;m heading into a migraine...painted on my forehead, behind my ears, up and down my neck and under my nose...the nausea and pain stop for a bit.  It is also good when you come down with a sore throat a little on your tongue and it coats it...making things better. Highly recommended by me!</li>
    <li> Sunbreeze is the best.  Love it except sometimes it&#x27;s hard to get it directly from the company without a sponsor, or signing up.  It being on Amazon is AWESOME!!!  If you want a high quality product that helps with relaxing, minor aches and pains, this is it.  I bought it as a gift and they received it before the expected date.  Super happy.</li>
    <li> Excellent for headaches!</li>
    <li> Helpful for clearing sinuses. Recommended by a friend. Daughter tried it and likes it, too. Small container fits easily in pocket or ourse.</li>
    <li> Great stuff for muscle pain. Why do I have to continue telling anymore about this product. It works, end of story</li>
    <li> This is one of those products that I take with me everywhere. I keep one at home and one in my purse. This oil is good for just about any ailment/injury. I use it for headaches, upset stomach, muscle aches, coughs, mild cuts... I could not imagine being without it and was glad to find it after much searching here on Amazon and in a 6 pack too! A great all around first aid product!</li>
