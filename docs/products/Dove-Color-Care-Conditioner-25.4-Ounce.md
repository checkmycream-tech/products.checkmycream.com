      <li>It&#x27;s great for people looking to repair some damage in their hair without spending a lot of money on a deep conditioning treatment.</li>
      <li>any case, I really enjoy using this when I do my hair each evening.</li>
      <li>Plus, my hair smelled fantastic all day.</li>
      <li>Because there are plenty of color care conditioners available in recyclable bottles, I would not buy this product.</li>
      <li>a light coconut-y fragrance&lt;br /&gt;4.</li>
      <li>So silky and smooth.  </li>
      <li>Dove delivers a good attempt on creating a nice, cheap conditioner that slightly restores hair, makes it smooth, and even controls the frizz of curly hair.</li>
      <li>The scent is light and clean (not flowery or fruity).  </li>
      <li>I love the tube packaging--so much easier to dispense!  </li>
      <li>By using Dove color treatment I can get a longer color and rich color as well.</li>
      <li>I liked this conditioner; it kept my hair from getting static or becoming too dry (which is a problem for me).</li>
      <li>/&gt;Although this product meets its goals in providing more nourishment to the color-treated hair, I would recommend looking for more natural products.</li>
      <li>looking for inexpensive this is a good solid</li>
      <li>Rinses quickly and my hair still feels clean from the shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>For the cost, it&#x27;s good enough.</li>
      <li>It is thick, coats hair and does an excellent job of conditioning.</li>
      <li>/&gt;The smell is pleasant, and the conditioner is nice and thick, however, so it definitely makes you feel like you are doing something good for your hair.</li>
      <li>And the texture of my hair has only gotten better and better</li>
      <li>just because it&#x27;s adequate.  </li>
      <li>It has a very creamy texture that absorbs into hair easily and rinses cleanly.</li>
      <li>Being long haired for a male, this works nicely and has a mild pleasant scent.  </li>
      <li>It smelled great, and didn&#x27;t weigh my hair down.</li>
      <li>and I needed a new conditioner that was going to be color safe.  </li>
      <li>I had previously reviewed the companion shampoo for this conditioner, and now that I have both, I can say that they work very nicely together.  </li>
      <li>ends  up more true to what it looks like when I first leave the stylist as well as soft and manageable.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used it as a conditioner with shampoos like Nexus as well as with  more economy conscious brands like Suave.  </li>
      <li>I am now using it with a regular shampoo and enjoying the extra shine and a good frizz control which is my biggest problem.</li>
      <li>The hallmark of a great daily hair care product is the ability to rinse completely without residue or build up and without stripping the color from your hair.</li>
      <li>It does a very nice job conditioning the hair, while not leaving a heavy waxy feel to the hair (which I was prepared for, given the density of the product).  </li>
      <li>results you can see from this conditioner are right there from the beginning.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s so thick &amp; creamy, smells good, and after about a week of using it my hair really is softer &amp; more manageable.  </li>
      <li>Great affordable color safe conditioner, a hard thing to find actually.</li>
      <li>I looked at the price several times as the specialty ones tend to be more dear.</li>
      <li>it felt like a more concentrated version of the DOVE regular conditioner.</li>
      <li>I try to use Dove color care shampoo and conditioner when I first do my highlights</li>
      <li>I like color care conditioners because my hair is pretty damaged from chlorine and color care</li>
      <li>This is the third product I have tried from the Dove Color Care line and I am in love with all three of them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Hair coloring tends to make the hair a bit harsh and you really always need to use a good conditioner so why not try this one.  </li>
      <li>This product really brings out the gold in my \\&quot;color treated\\&quot;  - OK dyed blonde hair.</li>
      <li>/&gt;The smell is pleasant, and very floral, but not overwhelming, and it doesn&#x27;t linger for too long, leaving you able to use your perfume without worries.</li>
      <li>They work very well for my very fine, dry</li>
      <li>I certainly would recommend this product, as it does everything it claims.</li>
      <li>I really like the Dove Hair Therapy Color Care products.  </li>
      <li>And my hair smells really</li>
      <li>and I didn&#x27;t lose the color nearly as fast as I thought I would.  </li>
      <li>, it worked really well</li>
      <li>It really does seem to help my hair hang on to color.  </li>
      <li>I had imagined the conditioner would come out of the tube with distinct stripes, much like some toothpaste brands did when I was young.  </li>
      <li>I have liked and used Dove hair care products for quite a few years now.  </li>
      <li>I liked how soft it made my hair feel right from the moment I washed it out til a few days after.</li>
      <li>I have not had a problem with conditioner residue build-up, as I experience with many other conditioners.  </li>
      <li>It rinsed clean, leaving no gross residue.</li>
      <li>Need a little goes on with a low scent that is pleasant.</li>
      <li>highly recommend this Dove Color Care Conditioner.</li>
      <li>Highly recommended.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Really works well at deep conditioning, gets the tangles out and smooths my hair and works well with defrizzing. I really love the smell of it as well, not too strong but very clean and slightly sweet smelling. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> If you are looking for a product that will keep your hair from fading from the Sun then this is just perfect for you. I have a few gray hairs that I have died., but after going to the beach and bike ridding I find my hair dye not to stay up to par. By using Dove color treatment I can get a longer color and rich color as well. Need a little goes on with a low scent that is pleasant. Use daily for best use.</li>
    <li> I love the tube packaging--so much easier to dispense!  Leaves my hair fresh and clean without the residue that some conditioners leave behind.  I am just not sure if it has any impact on protecting colored hair.  My hair was easily combed after showering.  I have recently had a problem with breakage but this product did not help improve that issue.</li>
    <li> Dove Color Care Daily Treatment Conditioner is a super-rich very thick product.  It really does seem to help my hair hang on to color.  And it leaves hair remarkably soft.  Would purchase again as well as recommend.</li>
    <li> Colored hair is notoriously harder to maintain because it is damaged by the hair dye. Therefore, colored hair requires more conditioning and more nourishment. Dove delivers a good attempt on creating a nice, cheap conditioner that slightly restores hair, makes it smooth, and even controls the frizz of curly hair. However, I am not a fan of the ingredients in this product, which include a lot of words I can&#x27;t pronounce (read: chemicals).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dove likes to talk about inner beauty and confidence that stems from the soul, but outer beauty is hard to maintain when it&#x27;s exposed to chemicals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although this product meets its goals in providing more nourishment to the color-treated hair, I would recommend looking for more natural products.</li>
    <li> Love this product. Incredibly thick and creamy.  Dove makes great hair care products and this is one of my favorites.  Smells great too!</li>
    <li> The hallmark of a great daily hair care product is the ability to rinse completely without residue or build up and without stripping the color from your hair. This Dove Color Care Daily Treatment, first of all, smells wonderful and is thick enough to feel like a deep conditioner but rinses like a daily conditioner should. Not too sure how much of a role conditioner actually plays in stripping hair of color since shampoo is the big culprit of color stripping (generally speaking) but I didn&#x27;t notice my fresh color running down the drain when I rinsed this out over several washes. I do notice that more with shampoo. I guess the logic in my head is conditioner adds something (protection?) to the hair while shampoo removes something.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In any case, I really enjoy using this when I do my hair each evening. I don&#x27;t have super thick hair but I do have a \\&quot;mane\\&quot; and it&#x27;s particularly long now. The fact that I can rinse this out without residue and that I need less drying and smoothing afterwards is freeing, to say the least. And my hair smells really nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommend.</li>
    <li> I had been using the Dove Hair Therapy Color Care shampoo and bottled conditioner together, for about three weeks before I tried this tube conditioner.  I really like the Dove Hair Therapy Color Care products.  They work very well for my very fine, dry hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really don&#x27;t see any difference between this tube conditioner and the bottled conditioner, other than this product is a thick cream.  Once it is smoothed on to my hair and worked in, it feels and works just like the bottled conditioner.  Both products are intended for daily use, and have similar usage instructions. I would gladly buy either conditioner again... probably choosing between the two formulations based on which is on sale.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Dove Hair Therapy Color Care products leave my hair as soft, shiny, detangled and manageable as any other shampoo/conditioner I&#x27;ve tried.  I have not had a problem with conditioner residue build-up, as I experience with many other conditioners.  The scent is light and clean (not flowery or fruity).  The price makes this an excellent choice for me.</li>
    <li> I like color care conditioners because my hair is pretty damaged from chlorine and color care tends to repair a lot of that damage. This Dove Color Care is no exception.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The results you can see from this conditioner are right there from the beginning. I liked how soft it made my hair feel right from the moment I washed it out til a few days after. The conditioner also smells great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this Dove Color Care Conditioner. It&#x27;s great for people looking to repair some damage in their hair without spending a lot of money on a deep conditioning treatment.</li>
    <li> Dove has really reinvented itself in the last ten years or so.  They have gone way beyond the basic bar of soap! I have been a big fan of their hair care line for awhile now. The products really are salon quality but probably at least one third the price! This conditioner is no exception! I recently colored my hair so it felt a little too crunchy for my taste. I was very happy  with the outcome after using this conditioner just one time. My hair felt smooth and silky and smelled fantastic! It rinsed clean, leaving no gross residue. And the texture of my hair has only gotten better and better the more I used it. This is a wonderful product at a great price!</li>
    <li> I have straight, thick, long hair that tangles easily. I need a conditioner that will help with my tangles and leave my hair soft. This Dove conditioner treatment did just that. The conditioner is very thick and creamy. I have been using it as a treatment every few days to deep condition my hair even though the bottle says you can use it daily. I am using [[ASIN:B00AVWJN6E Dove Color Care Conditioner, 25.4 Ounce]] in between for daily use. This combination has been working great for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Dove Color Care Daily Treatment Conditioner has a great light floral scent. It is thick, but it washes out of your hair easily and does not weigh your hair down like some conditioners do. It left my hair feeling really soft, silky and it helped tame my fly-a-ways. Plus, my hair smelled fantastic all day. As to whether or not it helped my highlights, it didn&#x27;t diminish my color any. This is the third product I have tried from the Dove Color Care line and I am in love with all three of them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend trying out this treatment conditioner even if you do not have colored hair.</li>
    <li> I have liked and used Dove hair care products for quite a few years now.  I had previously reviewed the companion shampoo for this conditioner, and now that I have both, I can say that they work very nicely together.  This conditioner is rather thick (packaged in a tube that you squeeze).  It does a very nice job conditioning the hair, while not leaving a heavy waxy feel to the hair (which I was prepared for, given the density of the product).  Used together, these two products - shampoo and conditioner - work very nicely to clean and keep color-treated hair manageable, without either: drying out the hair, or making it feel heavy and weighed down, all while protecting your color.  I would definitely recommend this duo for your color-treated hair!  Nice scent also!</li>
    <li> I have shoulder length hair that is very fine.  It is colored and highlighted ...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I found this conditioner to be pretty good for my very fine hair.  It smelled great, and didn&#x27;t weigh my hair down.</li>
    <li> I am OBSESSED with this treatment conditioner!! I just switched from a VERY high end line of haircare for colored hair to this line, and I will NEVER go back! It is thick, coats hair and does an excellent job of conditioning. The smell is divine and non-offensive, almost like a fruity coconut scent. I love this line, Dove…please continue to make it!</li>
    <li> She has kind of frizzy hair, some of it and this was the perfect conditioner for that hair.  It has a nice coconut fragrance and it&#x27;s thick going on.  Not much is needed like you&#x27;d expect.  I looked at the price several times as the specialty ones tend to be more dear.</li>
    <li> Oddly, this conditioner is richer than the \\&quot;repair\\&quot; conditioner in the same line. It has a very creamy texture that absorbs into hair easily and rinses cleanly. A little goes a long way. The scent is a light cocoa butter smell that is faint enough that you don&#x27;t feel like you&#x27;re at the beach surrounded by suntan lotion. Product dispenses easily from tube (gravity bottle + flexible packaging material, ample hole), which seems like a silly thing to mention, except that I&#x27;ve noticed a trend of rigid squeeze bottles that don&#x27;t seem to release the contents without a battle, so a bunch goes to waste.</li>
    <li> Love how my hair feels after using this.  So silky and smooth.  When I am out of the shower I can get a comb through it easily without having to spray in detangler if that tells you anything.  Generally I only get those results with Pantene and other high end conditioners.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My husband also has taken to using this (although he does not color his hair) he discovered it accidentally in the shower and he said he noticed it made HIS hair feel great.  Now he&#x27;s stealing MY conditioner!  LOL!</li>
    <li> I really like the Dove Color Care Daily Treatment Conditioner.  This product really brings out the gold in my \\&quot;color treated\\&quot;  - OK dyed blonde hair. I&#x27;ve used it as a conditioner with shampoos like Nexus as well as with  more economy conscious brands like Suave.  Whatever shampoo I use this quality conditioner with my hair color ends  up more true to what it looks like when I first leave the stylist as well as soft and manageable.  And the gold in my hair is not brassy looking after use of this conditioner as some other \\&quot;color guarding\\&quot; products tend to leave it.  With the summer months upon us I really like that this conditioner is designed for daily use and in my experience it does not leave hair too dry or too oily.</li>
    <li> I have color-treated hair so always look for shampoo and conditioner that help keep the color from fading as long as possible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This conditioner claims to have a \\&quot;color case treatment stripe\\&quot; and a \\&quot;concentrated nourishment stripe.\\&quot;  I had imagined the conditioner would come out of the tube with distinct stripes, much like some toothpaste brands did when I was young.  In practice, the conditioner comes out with some vaguely pink parts but I wouldn&#x27;t call them stripes and nothing like the illustration on the tube.  It is a very thick conditioner and I have to work to distribute it through my hair (which is not very thick and barely shoulder length).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The conditioner seems to work okay but my hair doesn&#x27;t feel as soft as when I use [[ASIN:B00A0IWRUI Suave Professionals Moroccan Infusion Color Care Conditioner 28 oz]].&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My biggest beef with the product is that the tube they use to try to get stripes does not appear to be recyclable.  I do not see a recycling code on it anywhere.  I try not to buy products in packaging that is not recyclable unless there is no other option.  Because there are plenty of color care conditioners available in recyclable bottles, I would not buy this product.</li>
    <li> 50 year old hair and need a conditioner that will tame it enough to allow me to brush it out before I add any leave in treatment and this fits the bill (I use an oil to keep my hair from fizzing and a straightening creme).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use every time I wash my hair in lieu of standard conditioner. Rinses quickly and my hair still feels clean from the shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To me it felt like a more concentrated version of the DOVE regular conditioner. It comes out like a dense beauty cream. I leave it in while I bathe and then rinse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When looking for inexpensive this is a good solid choice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do like when I visit a salon and the scent of the products they use, the scent here is pretty generic.</li>
    <li> I have used a lot of different Conditioners that claim they help with keeping the color in your hair but there are few that work that well.  I have used the Dove products in the past and really like them and this conditioner works quite well considering it doesn&#x27;t cost a small fortune.  I like the fragrance and the way my hair is really soft afterwards.  Hair coloring tends to make the hair a bit harsh and you really always need to use a good conditioner so why not try this one.  A plus in my book that&#x27;s for sure.</li>
    <li> I just colored my hair and I needed a new conditioner that was going to be color safe.  I ordered this Dove bottle and I was impressed, it worked really well and I didn&#x27;t lose the color nearly as fast as I thought I would.  Great job Dove, this works amazing!</li>
    <li> Pros&lt;br /&gt;+Works well&lt;br /&gt;+Smells good, but not overwhelming&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons&lt;br /&gt;-Tube isn&#x27;t designed to be held and squeezed by slippery hands&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am once again impressed with Dove&#x27;s products. I used this in place of my conditioner, and it made my hair more shiny and silky. When used for a few days in a row, the effects intensify. As a disclaimer though, it will do nothing for split ends. Just trim those.&lt;br /&gt;The smell is pleasant, and very floral, but not overwhelming, and it doesn&#x27;t linger for too long, leaving you able to use your perfume without worries. The conditioner is very thick and creamy and it takes a little longer to rub in, but the results are worth the effort and it rinses out quickly.&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is that unlike most other Dove products, this one is tricky to hold and squeeze when in the shower. I certainly would recommend this product, as it does everything it claims.</li>
    <li> Very nice product, my hair seems much stronger and I love the fact that I can use this everyday.  My hair comes out silky but not slimy which I get from a lot of hair conditioners.  The fact that it&#x27;s good for my color is a wonderful added bonus.</li>
    <li> Great affordable color safe conditioner, a hard thing to find actually. This works well on my thick fine brown box colored hair. Haven&#x27;t detected any buildup or scalp issues. I do wish it made my hair feel a little bit more conditioned but overall not too bad.</li>
    <li> I am so happy with this conditioner!  I only have to use a quarter of what I was using before (just regular suave conditioner). It&#x27;s so thick &amp; creamy, smells good, and after about a week of using it my hair really is softer &amp; more manageable.  I&#x27;m very happy and will start buying it when this one runs out.</li>
    <li> I liked this conditioner; it kept my hair from getting static or becoming too dry (which is a problem for me). However, I did notice that my hair had almost a greasy sheen by the day after,and my hair is generally so dry that I need to go two days without washing it. This made me think that maybe it was making my hair a tad bit too conditioned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell is pleasant, and the conditioner is nice and thick, however, so it definitely makes you feel like you are doing something good for your hair.</li>
    <li> This conditioner smells really nice.  I have brown hair with some highlights.  I try to use Dove color care shampoo and conditioner when I first do my highlights but it&#x27;s been a while since I had the last retouch.  This deep conditioner helped me to revive them again.  I don&#x27;t wash my hair every day but I&#x27;ve been able to use this conditioner 3 or 4 washes in a row before it gets too heavy (buildup).  I am now using it with a regular shampoo and enjoying the extra shine and a good frizz control which is my biggest problem.</li>
    <li> I made the crazy decision to balayage my hair.  This is like highlighting, but instead of foil strips the highlights are \\&quot;painted\\&quot; on one-by-one.  Yeah...now my used to be awesomely healthy hair is tough and feels pretty intense when I wash it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started using this Dove shampoo, and like most Dove products I&#x27;m really happy with it.  I leave it on for a few minutes and by the end my hair feels bearable, and even almost soft verses tough and straw like.  It has a hint of purple which is good too I&#x27;m told.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once my hair is dry, it is soft and manageable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It smells nice as well, floral but not overwhelming.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend.</li>
    <li> Comparing this with other conditioners that I&#x27;ve tested, this is a good one, but not top scoring.  Being long haired for a male, this works nicely and has a mild pleasant scent.  For the cost, it&#x27;s good enough.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d just colored my hair (at home) when this product arrived.  I&#x27;ve been using it for 3 weeks and I&#x27;m pretty satisfied with it, but I&#x27;m not sure I like it any better (or worse) than any other product I&#x27;ve tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I do like:&lt;br /&gt;1. It&#x27;s very thick and feels like it&#x27;s conditioning my hair, but it doesn&#x27;t leave a lot of residue and rinses clean&lt;br /&gt;2. My hair (oily) can go a day without washing and still look good&lt;br /&gt;3. The smell is pleasant: a light coconut-y fragrance&lt;br /&gt;4. The 8 oz bottle will probably last a long time since I have fairly short hair&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Could be better:&lt;br /&gt;1. Doesn&#x27;t seem to make my hair less frizzy in our high humidity (but our Florida climate is tough on hair)&lt;br /&gt;2. I don&#x27;t notice that this maintains my hair color any better (or worse) than any other inexpensive product&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3-stars just because it&#x27;s adequate.  Not a bad product, but won&#x27;t draw me away from other similar products from Suave, Loreal, or John Frieda that have fragrances I prefer.</li>
    <li> This 8 ounce Conditioner is great for traveling and give your hair the extra boost for softness, healthly and nice light smell. I find that my Color Care is very dry in the last few weeks before I dye it again and this product brings it back to life.</li>
