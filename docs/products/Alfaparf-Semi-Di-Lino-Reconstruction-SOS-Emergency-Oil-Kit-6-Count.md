    <li> this repaired my hair!!!!</li>
    <li> Works good but you need to use it for at least 3-4 months twice a week, I decided to take biotin to help me with my hair loss and started to work</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t see a difference at all however the blue  ampules from this brand is the bomb, gives shine and softness to my curls.</li>
    <li> I did not see any results.</li>
    <li> Delivery fast...&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a treatment, will not get your hair 100% fine with just one of it...&lt;br /&gt;Depending how dry it&#x27;s your hair, must use once a week or twice a month...
