      <li>Nice to dust myself with before getting dressed.  </li>
      <li>Wonderful scent that&#x27;s not overpowering, and a very affordable price.  </li>
      <li>so it is nice.  </li>
      <li>I use Royale Bouquet Rose and Honeysuckle but thought i wpuld branch out and try something else.</li>
      <li>Had I known that they were discontinuing the original, I would have stocked a supply to keep me happy for years.&lt;br</li>
      <li>While pleasant the fragrance is a bit strong for me</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Was very pleased to find this on Amazon. I like to dust after a shower. Jean Nate has such a pleasant fragrance.</li>
    <li> Finally! I&#x27;ve searching for a powder/powder puff combo for a while. Nothing is quite as lovely for your girlie bits during a hot, sweaty summer! The scent is delightful: light and fresh. The puff is generous and \\&quot;poofy\\&quot;. Thank You!</li>
    <li> I was happy with the shipment and punctuality but neither I or my fiance found this scent appealing what-so-ever!! Threw it away and found some nice smelling lavender powder instead. Would not recommend or purchase this again. Maybe the smell was just too old for me... :/</li>
    <li> Began using Jean Nate After Bath Splash in college and am still using it and the body powder.  I love it and the way it makes me feel so fresh.  I also have a small travel size bottle of the After Bath Splash which always goes with me.</li>
    <li> I had forgotten about Jean Nate&#x27;.  Recently read about it and started using it again!&lt;br /&gt;Use the Splash (keep in the refrigerator), and layer with this powder as I did years ago.  Came very quickly, packaged well! LOVE the puff! We all need some pampering in today&#x27;s world!</li>
    <li> Lovely silky freshly scented bath powder.</li>
    <li> Recently received my Jean Nate Body Powder.  I love it!  Being the very happy owner of a horse, I use powder a lot..... mostly baby powder, but having been a fan of the Jean Nate odor, I decided to try their powder.  It is great!  Not too strong (and I don&#x27;t smell like a baby!).  It helps keep me dry in this horrid New Jersey humidity and between horse chores and house chores I can just pat some powder on and I feel refreshed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll be purchasing it in the near future for sure.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been searching for a new powder puff, this one is great.  The fragrance is a little strong for me so I just use regular babby powder.  The puff keeps a little of the fragerance so it is nice.  Perfect sized and perfect material!  I love the puff!  Thanks</li>
    <li> What more can I say.  Jean Nate has been around for years and years and that alone should tell you how well loved this product is.  I was looking for some dusting powder to freshen me up during the hot summer months in Houston.  When I searched Amazon and found this, I was thrilled.  You can&#x27;t go wrong, this has been tested and approved by many many people.  The price is right too.</li>
    <li> I remember my mom using this when I was a little girl.  It was such a special treat when i got to use it too!  I was looking for a powder with a puff and was thrilled to find this was still available.  I love the light scent that is not overwhelming.</li>
    <li> Product was great. Shipping was quick</li>
    <li> My favorite year around</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve searched for Jean Nate for my Mom, who is 93 and thank goodness for the internet and Amazon.  I was able to buy 4 boxes for very reasonable prices.  My mother is staying at a great assisted living facility in Wilton Connecticut and she mentioned to her friends that I bought Jean Nate from Amazon and they are ready to order both for themselves and for the boutique store they have on premises.</li>
    <li> a favorite powder of mine</li>
    <li> Bought this on line because we cannot find a local store selling it anymore. When I met my wife in 1971 this was the stuff she used.  Now married 37 years and I still love the smell!  Time to stock up???</li>
    <li> I love this scent. It reminds me of lemon blossoms and lemon oil that have been seeped in a milk bath with just a hint of vanilla extract, or a really fragrant lemon ice cream, or even a warm freshly made lemon custard. It&#x27;s a very soothing, yet refreshing scent. The smell brings a smile to my face.  The buff has very long loose fibers, compared to my (Guerlain) Shalimar buffs.  Ingredients listed: Talc, Kaolin, Parfum, Limonene, Linalool, Hydroxycitronellal, Geranoil, Citronellol, Coumarin, Citral and Magnesium Carbonate.</li>
    <li> Fragrance is very subtle, however, I have chemical sensitivities and it did not mix well with my immune system.  Sadly I cannot use it, but I did like the fragrance and will give it to my sister.</li>
    <li> This is THE BEST bath powder ever.  Light scent, not overwhelming.  Smooth fine talc, excellent quality.  Love it![[ASIN:B000MT1GHA Jean Nate Silkening Body Powder with Puff, Original 6 oz (170 g)]]</li>
    <li> Favorite since the 1950&#x27;s still the same quality  AND free shipping, can&#x27;t beat that!!</li>
    <li> Could not find this product at local stores because I love dusting powder and used this product years ago and it is perfect for summer.  When I went to a local mall and visited a few stores the young girls looked at me like I was from outer space when I asked for dusting powder.  I did finf another pricey powder in a major dept. store but the price was too expensive and not Jean Nate.  So, I turned to Amazon and found it there and it was delivered in a few days after I placed the order.  When in doubt turn to Amazon.</li>
    <li> This is an old favorite and never disappoints.  Sent to my mother as a gift and she loves it. Would recommend.</li>
    <li> I used to love the clean fresh scent of Jean Nate but this was so strong, I choked on the scent.  I washed and dried the box and the puff and will try using it with some Burt&#x27;s Bees powder.</li>
    <li> I was so glad to find powder with a powder puff.&lt;br /&gt;This is a very nicely scented product.  I hope I will be able&lt;br /&gt;to keep on purchasing this product.</li>
    <li> I found this to be a not bad, but rather strong smelling powder; stronger than I’d like if I had to smell it for longer than it would take to apply it.  But once applied I never notice the scent again and my nose is pretty sensitive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I’d been looking for something to apply that comes with a decent sized powder puff to keep me feeling dry as the day goes on and this fits the bill.</li>
    <li> Love this product!!!  The powder is light and has a wonderful scent.  Better even than the After Bath Splash scent.  Feels wonderful against the skin on hot Summer day.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Jean Nate Bath Powder for over 60 years, and never have I found one that pleases so much.  The scent is a bit spicy, yet sweet; its feel is silky; and the smell is mild, not over powering.  My childhood neighbor&#x27;s Mother  WAS JEAN NATE,, not that I&#x27;m biased :)</li>
    <li> WILL NEVER GO OUT OF STYLE.</li>
    <li> I thought about buying this product for my grandma and then I did a quick search of the ingredients online and found that, \\&quot;Talc is closely related to the potent carcinogen asbestos. Talc particles have been shown to cause tumors in the ovaries and lungs of cancer victims.\\&quot; from [...]</li>
    <li> I have loved Jean Nate for so many years that I expect it to be as great as it was in the &#x27;50s.  The scent is the same, but the powder puff used to be well made and didn&#x27;t come apart after a few uses.  Since it is difficult to find where I now live, I ordered it from Amazon.com. I can recommend the powder, but find another well made large puff! I last used that puff to swipe-clean my bathroom counter of the powder dust; it did not hold up for body usage!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my mom.  She likes to apply powder after bathing and it&#x27;s hard to find bath powder with a puff, without paying for the really expensive stuff in department stores.  This is very affordable and has a light refreshing scent.  Mom loves it.</li>
    <li> My wife has used this for 20 + years,  a must for each Christmas and much looked forward to. Try the Jean Nate after bath Splash</li>
    <li> This is one of the most impressing items I owned. The (Discounted) price is very good. Quantity is big &amp; it has its own puffing pad.  I would order it again if stays at the same price.</li>
    <li> I bought this mostly because I wanted the powder puff and the container to use in the future.  The Jean Nate scent reminds me of my grandma and I will use it for nostalgia.  The scent is strong so I&#x27;ll probably cut it with some regular powder just to dial it down a little.  The puff and the plastic container are exactly what I wanted.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my mom as part of her Mother&#x27;s Day gift, and she was thrilled because it brought back fond memories of when she used it in the past.  She loved the fresh scent and said it was &amp;#34;clean clean clean smelling.&amp;#34;  My mom is 75 years young.</li>
    <li> Christmas gift.  My wife likes it very much</li>
    <li> This Jean Nate powder has been a winner for so many years I cannot remember.  My mother used it when I was young and I never forgot the fragrance.  Gave as a gift recently and everyone was asking what she was wearing!!</li>
    <li> The smell is way too strong. It would work for an older male, but not for a young woman. My goal for powder is to divert attention to my smell, not get attention. It was waaayyyyy too strong of a smell. I had to return it.</li>
    <li> This powder has probably been around since the &#x27;40&#x27;s.  It is clean smelling, light, yummy.  I just smile when I puff it on.  I need to order more.  I use little else to make me feel dry and scented.  Live in the tropics so this powder is almost essential due to sweaty conditions. The plastic container is fun to keep for storing hairclips, rubber bands, jewelry or whatever.</li>
    <li> I searched on the computer and found very few bath powder items available.  The    few available were very expensive.  I remember this brand from years ago and liked it then.  I really like the Jean Nate powder.  It smells so very good.</li>
    <li> When I was a young lady, my mother bought me Jean Nate splash and dusting powder. I am way older now, and haven&#x27;t seen it anywhere. Of course, Amazon offered a seller, who was reliable in getting the package to me on time, and in perfect shape. And the dusting powder is just an old timey finishing touch. The fragrance is light enough to wear daily, and really takes me back, too.</li>
    <li> Easy to use, smells wonderful and doesn&#x27;t make a mess all over the floor like the sprinkle powders! I will buy again!</li>
    <li> Close, but not exactly the same fragrance.  Years ago, this product was made in the USA.  I believe this was imported.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Jean Nate on and off since the seventies. The light clean smell of the powder is wonderful and the talc keeps you dry.</li>
    <li> I love this dusting powder.  Has a nice but understated fragrance.  Works well.  Hard to find in the stores these days so it is great that I can still get it through Amazon.</li>
    <li> This scent takes me back to my high school days.  Along with Villager clothes, Aigner  purses, Bass Weejun shoes and Madras plaid accessories, this was a must have for the girls.</li>
    <li> I have loved this scent since childhood.  I use this product daily to freshen sheets.  Works very well for me.</li>
    <li> The Jean Nate Body Powder is one of my favorites.  It&#x27;s light scent and silky smooth fine powder texture are especially great when used during the hot summer weather or after a nice hot shower.  I pair it up with the Jean Nate After Bath Splash too.  Jean Nate is one of the very few scents I can wear in addition to Nina Ricci&#x27;s Le Air Du Temps Eau de Parfum and Calvin Klein&#x27;s Obsession Eau de Parfum.  Anything other than these (Qty 3) perfume scents tend to trigger a migraine.  The Jean Nate powder is definitely a keeper.</li>
    <li> have used it for years and received it soon after I ordered it with no problems!  Love it in the summer!</li>
    <li> I had been looking everywhere for Jean Nate products and hadn&#x27;t been able to find them until I checked Amazon. This order came to me super fast and I was really glad to get it. Great service.</li>
    <li> My wife likes this powder so it is a safe bet for a present. Probably be back next year for more.</li>
    <li> Have been using it daily for many years.  Wouldn&#x27;t be without it in my house.</li>
    <li> This was something mom has been using for years, and when it disappeared from the shelf of the local pharmacy I thought I would give the Amazon purchase a try, and voila have it again. It is authentic, the same exact thing, and comes nicely packed in the Jean Nate box ready for gift giving or just for storage purposes.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t beat tje citrus scent of Jean Nate.  Better than the high priced copies.</li>
    <li> Reminds me of my Mother. Silkey powder with the light classic fragrance of JEAN&lt;br /&gt;NATE. Will not conflict with perfume.</li>
    <li> I enjoy this refreshing after bath powder.  The fragrance makes me think of lemon bars with confectioners sugar dusted on top; it doesn&#x27;t smell exactly like that, but that is what comes to mind.  The yellow container is so cheerful in the bathroom.</li>
    <li> As expected, nice light scented powder and came quickly.</li>
    <li> One of the best body powders I&#x27;ve used!  It really does help minimize sweat and odour for me.  I will definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> The smell was a little stronger than I remembered. But I will use it. I have allergies and was afraid after smelling it that I would have a problem.</li>
    <li> l&#x27;m very impressed with the smell and silkiness of this powder and the puff works excellent to help apply the powder thanks amazon for providing this excellent product</li>
    <li> Here again I have to give one star as the box that the powder came in was opened. Powder was awful, very strong order and very overpowering. Can&#x27;t use it. Also the container that the powder was in didn&#x27;t have the plastic thing that has the holes in it to regulate how much powder comes up from the bottom and gets on the puff.</li>
    <li> I originally bought this because I couldn&#x27;t find a powder puff in the store-them thought, well I would need a container for the puff so why not get an all in one package. Glad I did-live this subtle scent-and Jean Nate-what a blast from the past! The puff is 5 inches in diameter, perfect size.</li>
    <li> I love the silky smooth feeling this powder leaves me with after each shower!  It has a pleasing smell too!</li>
    <li> I put this on every morning. It&#x27;s wonderful I would recommend. I would purchase more when I run out. I have been looking for this for a long time finally found it.  Thank you.</li>
    <li> Love the light scent. Shipping great.</li>
    <li> Decent size/quantity for the price.  The container is fairly strong of hard plastic.  While pleasant the fragrance is a bit strong for me so I mixed it with baby powder to soften the scent.</li>
    <li> I remember this product from long ago.  Didn&#x27;t know it was still available, but am enjoying&lt;br /&gt;it again.  I dust with it before bed to fall asleep to the aroma, and then again in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;Nice packaging, bright, friendly yellow.</li>
    <li> The powder arrived in a very timely manner. Great shipping from the supplier. This is a Christmas gift for my wife. She turned 50 last September and thought she might enjoy a reminder of younger days. I am sure she will love it!</li>
    <li> It is nice, but as nice as it is somehow it doesn&#x27;t smell like the cologne does.  I&#x27;ll try something else the next time.</li>
    <li> classically elegant, subtle Jean Nate... When you only want a hint, plus the velvety feel on your skin... Wonderful.</li>
    <li> Delivered on time.  Good value for the size of the body powder.  My favorite perfume scents are overpriced so I thought I would try Jean Nate since my mother likes and uses it.  Smells fine.</li>
    <li> This product use to be around a lot during my grandmothers day. Availability is almost nonresistant.  You will be happy with purchase</li>
    <li> I like this product it is convenient, smells good and something you can use to keep refreshed during the hot and cold seasons.</li>
    <li> The scent of this powder is so vibrant and regal. I now understand why my grandmothes continues to treasure this powder.</li>
    <li> Been using Jean Nate fragrances since the &#x27;60s.....love the refreshing, clean scent. Very happy with the powder even though this is the first time I have bought it.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s amazing how a certain fragrance can bring you back in time. This powder is wonderful. It&#x27;s just like I remember it from the 70&#x27;s and it&#x27;s very silky on the skin. Smells clean and fresh. LOVE IT!!!</li>
    <li> I have used Jean Nate since I was a little girl. I&#x27;m 77 now.  It has a light and clean scent.</li>
    <li> I  HAVE BEEN USING JEAN NATE PRODJECTS SENCE 1950&lt;br /&gt;  AT THAT TIME I WAS 20 YEARS OLD&lt;br /&gt;  I WAS WORKING MY FIRST JOB AT &#x27;N.Y. HOSPITAL&#x27;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THIS WAS BEFORE JEAN NATE BECAME SO VERY POPULAR&lt;br /&gt;AND I HAVE LOVED EVERY MINUTE OF IT&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SIGNED &#x3D; ANN KORMAN SCAPARRO</li>
    <li> This powder is very silky.  It has no clumps like some other bath powders I&#x27;ve had.  I love the lemon smell.  It&#x27;s very fresh.  For those bothered by strong fragrances as I am, I encourage you to try this.</li>
    <li> Feel fresh for hours.</li>
    <li> Was excited to find this!</li>
    <li> I got this gift for my Mon and &#x27;She Loves It&#x27; !!!.  I&#x27;m gonna get this for her again next year.</li>
    <li> I ordered this product mainly because I wanted a powder puff to apply body powder and this comes with a large puff. I love the puff but the body powder has a very strong smell. It reminds me of perfume that a very mature woman might use. Overall, I am happy with my purchase, but I had to thoroughly clean the container and puff and use my own unscented body powder.</li>
    <li> I use Royale Bouquet Rose and Honeysuckle but thought i wpuld branch out and try something else. The Jean Nate smells so strong i almosy gagged. Will definiyely not use or reorder.</li>
    <li> My wife fell in love with this powder many years ago while overseas.  Its lightly fragranced and keeps you feeling fresh and dry. She finally ran out a few weeks ago. And she  foolishly ran around town looking for \\&quot;after bath powder\\&quot;. All she could find was baby powder. Most companies in the fragrance business no longer sell body \\&quot;bath\\&quot; powder.  Then she turned to The place she should have started with \\&quot; Amazon\\&quot;. Saved the day.</li>
    <li> Gave it as a gift to my granddaughter, she loves it</li>
    <li> Very velvety, nice scent and have used it for years.</li>
    <li> When you live in high humidity places like FL powder can be your best friend. This one works well because it has a light sent and doesn&#x27;t interfere with your purfume. If perspire a lot you may have to apply more frequently. I put it on the inside of my thighs because I like to wear dresses.</li>
    <li> First of all, the scent has changed which should have warned me right off.  After applying only once, I broke out in the worst rash I have ever had.  I&#x27;ll never order this product again &amp; wish I could get my money back.</li>
    <li> I love this nice light fragrance put on after a bath,  IT is so soft on you skin.  I received fast service and excellent packaging on the product.  I purchase a lot thru&lt;br /&gt;amazon and this is another satisfactory transaction.</li>
    <li> Purchased as a gift and the receiver loved it.</li>
    <li> I have not received the Jean Nate Powder yet but have used it in the past and like it.  I bot this as a Xmas gift for my grandson.  He loves it and likes the fact that it comes with a powder puff.</li>
    <li> Lovely.  Am enjoying it.</li>
    <li> Very happy with the product.  Arrived on time in great condition.  The powder is very nice and the container more than I expected. I love it and will buy more!</li>
    <li> I woukd give 5 stars, but on the second use of the powder puff, the entire puff came apart.  Now i have to either find a new puff or stuctvh this one back together.  The powder is nice, although not the same scent as I remember.</li>
    <li> Mom is now 90 and still likes to dress to the hilt like she did in the 50s 60s 70s 80s 90s 2000s 10s.......Now she can still get her stuff (online) without having to drive (which seems to be getting harder each year.)THANKS AMAZON</li>
    <li> It was a gift.  I think she sent it back for exchange.  She used to like Jean Nate, now likes Elizabeth Taylor fragrances.</li>
    <li> A very nice body powder with that great citrus fragerance of Jean Nate. A must to go with the body splash for the freshest after bath feeling you can have!</li>
    <li> Love this! Subtle scent. perfect for day or night</li>
    <li> It has an unpleasing fragrance --I remembered Jean Nate as smelling like lemons, but this is nothing like I remember.  Before you buy it, be sure tocheck out the fragrance.</li>
    <li> This product was shipped and arrived on time and was exactly as expected. Gave it to my mother as a gift and she loves it, so all is good and I am satisfied.</li>
    <li> have used this for many years and it is difficult to purchase locally  thanks for having such a diverse selection of items,</li>
    <li> While browzing at Amazon, I started to look for talcum powder with a puff. Using a sprinkling can, I either get too much, or the holes fill up. When I saw Jean Nate under body powders I was delighted.  I forgot how I used it years ago and loved it.  I added one to my \\&quot;cart\\&quot; to buy when I had extra items. I forgot I had it in my cart so added it again during my next browzing session. When I received my order with two containers, I kept both since the price was right.  One is for me and other for a friend who also used it years ago. Love the nostalgic feeling I get when I wear it!</li>
    <li> I remembered this brand from when I was a little girl and thought my mother-in-law would enjoy it.  I think she was happy to have a bath powder, but didn&#x27;t say anything about the brand.  Oh well, I remembered it was considered a nice brand back in the old days</li>
    <li> The powder smells so good it glides on your skin it&#x27;s very light and airy not over powering in any way it doesn&#x27;t stain your clothing it&#x27;s a very refreshing powdery smell!!</li>
    <li> an older body dusting powder not found at the run of the mill mall,agreat valentine gift to someone special or to a sister</li>
    <li> This is a nice basic talc that isn&#x27;t too overpowering. It doesn&#x27;t cause a rash as some talcs do, and is pleasant smelling. I would buy it again.</li>
    <li> My mother-in-law loves this powder, and I find it hard to obtain for her.  I am so happy I am able to purchase it here.  And the ship it immediately.</li>
    <li> Love Jean Nate, and it&#x27;s difficult to find-especially powder.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a body powder with no perfume because I&#x27;m allergic to perfume. I went through the reviews. Most people said it had a citrus smell and I knew I could tolerate citrus, just not floral, so I wanted to try it. It&#x27;s been 45 years since I used Jean Nate products and have forgotten how they smell or why I stopped using them but I really can&#x27;t understand the gritty comments about this powder because it is a very mild scent and not gritty at all. It&#x27;s smooth and silky and makes your skin feel smooth as a babies....well you know. I recommend it to those of us that can&#x27;t take floral scents and anyone that loves to feel smooth, fresh and clean. I will forever be using this powder..</li>
    <li> I bought this out of nostalgia. It reminds me of my childhood. The scent and the packaging haven&#x27;t changed at all. It&#x27;s funny that they still make it the same way they always did. I love it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for many years and it&#x27;s great nothing comes close to the quality always my go to powder</li>
    <li> A fresh scent that I remember my mother using many years ago. Very fast delivery too.</li>
    <li> Was a gift for my wife and she love it, the fragrance is delicious and feels like a silk.</li>
    <li> good large size powder puff, awesome smelling powder.</li>
    <li> Old but classic one always arouse my memories.</li>
    <li> I loved it. I need MORE!!!</li>
    <li> She loved it! My mom is part of the generation were body powder was part of the beauty routine. She was struggling to find it and specially this brand. Smells soft and nice and like she said, it is great to pamper yourself with it. Great if you live in a humid, warm weather.</li>
    <li> No problems with the item, shipping, etc.  However, even thought this product smells very good it does not have the same silky texture as most powders.  It feels a little bit grainy.  I don&#x27;t think I would repurchase it again.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my wife. This is her favorite body powder but this time it not good. The smell is completely different. It&#x27;s almost a very synthetic smell and much milder than the original. She used it anyway and got a rash... Dumped it... Waste of money.</li>
    <li> I love Jean Nate powder after a shower. The scent is subtle and does not bother my allergies. Too many other scents are too strong for me.</li>
    <li> Smells fresh and light. Large puff for easy coverage.</li>
    <li> The Jean Nate bath powder is a product that I have loved for years. Unfortunately it&#x27;s difficult to find in stores in my area these days. Thinking it might have been discontinued, I decided to check Amazon, and there it was! I like the fact that the scent is clean and fresh and not sweet and overpowering. I&#x27;m sensitive to scents and this one is perfect for me.</li>
    <li> Brand new, Good ship!</li>
    <li> Thank you for still offering this product.  It&#x27;s all my mom has asked for this Christmas and no stores where we live carry any type of dusting powder for women.  It&#x27;s nice to know I have my own elves to help me out this holiday season!</li>
    <li> nothing like Jean Nate.  Fresh, lovely.  There really is nothing else I can say - love all Jean Nate products</li>
    <li> Exactly the way I remember it. Brings back wonderful memories. I will  buy more when needed. I love this product</li>
    <li> The scent is nice and subtle and it comes with it&#x27;s own powder puff. I think it was a good buy.</li>
    <li> This is nostalgic for us to Buy Jean Nate, as my mother loves it and when we smell that scent, it reminds us of her. We just bought her some this Christmas. It came quickly and as promised... Love the scent!</li>
    <li> Glad to be able to find this on-line as the chain stores don&#x27;t seem to carry it anymore. Like the fresh scent and the soft feeling after using it.</li>
    <li> Still don&#x27;t like the puffs.</li>
    <li> I have been searching everywhere for the original Jean Nate products.  While the powder is close, it still doesn&#x27;t seem to be the same scent.  I guess it will have to do until Revlon decides to make a bunch of &#x27;baby boomers&#x27; like me - happy!&lt;br /&gt;The original Jean Nate was so unique - a soft, refreshing lemony smell.  Had I known that they were discontinuing the original, I would have stocked a supply to keep me happy for years.&lt;br /&gt;Again - *attention Revlon* - go back to the original formula.....you&#x27;ll make a ton of friends!</li>
    <li> This was a gift for my Mother. She loves Jean Nate&#x27; and I was able to find the spray cologne and body lotion locally but could not find the dusting powder and that is what she loves most. I am so glad I was able to get it though you. Very satisfied and thank you.</li>
    <li> I bought this a stocking stuffer for my mom. She used to use this years ago and always loved this powder.</li>
    <li> I love this product. I like to use it in the summer time.</li>
    <li> THIS WASA GIFT FOR MY SISTER; SHE LOVES THIS BATH POWDER</li>
    <li> This is a great somewhat light smell for the summer. Haven&#x27;t used it for a while and am glad I purchased it again.</li>
    <li> Great service, great product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I remember my mom using this when I was a kid.  I wanted a nice powder to use after showering - it fits the bill.</li>
    <li> Had so many varieties online but I&#x27;ve Jean Nate Bath Splash so figured I&#x27;d get this version.  Nice to dust myself with before getting dressed.  So glad you can still get it.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff, and have since I was young.  Wonderful scent that&#x27;s not overpowering, and a very affordable price.  Go for it!</li>
    <li> HAS A NICE DELICATE SMELL GREAT SAOOTHING FEAL I LOVE IT MAKES ME SMELL AND FEEL LIKE A LADY GREAT</li>
    <li> It smell&#x27;s so pretty.. I love it, soo clean smelling and not over bearing...  Not too perfume smelling. I would recommend it and would rather smell this on some one than other perfumes.. Smiles</li>
    <li> It is getting difficult to find this wonderful product.  I adore the powder.  It is so refreshingly fragrant and makes me feel lovely.  I bought one for my aunt too.  It&#x27;s her favorite.  It really is silky and the aroma takes me back to my youth.  Love this.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t even know you still could get this classic!  Mother-in-law was very pleased.</li>
    <li> It was what I was looking for. I just love it. It fragance is great. I recommend it to everybody.</li>
    <li> Smells good.  Smooth, clean scent.  Not sure if I will buy it again but it is a decent powder.</li>
    <li> This was a Christmas present for my Mom (I bought for my Dad to give to my Mom!) She LOVES it. It smells nothing like the body splash that I though was horrible when I was a kid, it is very mild. My mom uses it every day. I am sure there will be requests for more (though I will have to figure out how to get it with out her knowing it was me).</li>
    <li> UNEXPECTED PLEASURE OF SCENT!  This item delivered quickly, in just a few days, box was sealed that contains the powder and it&#x27;s one of the larger types of containers with a large puff too!  Haven&#x27;t tried JN in eons and find it refreshing and very nice feeling on skin, Highly recommend this great buy!</li>
    <li> My wife has been using this product exclusively for many years.  She loves it.  Silky, nice aroma.</li>
    <li> My mom and I both love it and the fragrance.</li>
    <li> My wife says it&#x27;s not the original scent but it&#x27;s close enough</li>
    <li> Love this product and have used it for years. Not to heavy and very light fragrance makes product so special</li>
    <li> When I received it, I wasn&#x27;t expecting it to be big so I was surprised. For me, it was like a lemony fresh scent. I love it. Make you feel refresh. Definitely worth the price!</li>
    <li> I have used Jean Nate Body Powder for years and love it.  However I have not been able to find it in stores.</li>
    <li> I scored brownie points with the Mrs. when I got her this.  She really, really likes it.  I&#x27;ll take her word for it.</li>
    <li> I love this products, I been using then for a very long time... thanks!</li>
    <li> gift for mother in law and she loves it</li>
    <li> So glad to have come across this powder on Amazon.  Was almost out of my last container.  It is so refreshing, especially in the summer.  Have been a fan for years.</li>
    <li> This has a lovely fresh scent, I use it after a bubble bath, it&#x27;s not too heavy or &#x27;perfumey&#x27; for bedtime. A nice clean refreshing fragrance. Love the little powder puff!</li>
    <li> Have used this powder off and on for years . . . . always come back to it and plan to order more.</li>
    <li> Have loved Jean Nate since I was a teen. To my amazement it still smells just has good. It smells clean and refreshing. The price is great and it last for awhile.</li>
    <li> Ahh the fresh scent of Jean Nate, just as I remembered. When I opened the box it immediately brought back memories. I can&#x27;t find this powder any where and it was one of the few things my mother in law had on her Christmas list. The order arrived promptly and was well packaged.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this powder before and I love the smell of it.</li>
    <li> I had forgotten what this smelled like. It was so many years ago that I wore this all the time. It still smells so clean and feminine.</li>
    <li> Reminds me that my Grandmas with me, like smell</li>
    <li> I would have given this product 5 stars if it had a &amp;#34;puffier&amp;#34; puff. The puff included is pretty much flat, but is serviceable and does the job intended. I have been looking for loose powder with a puff for a long time and this is the only one I could find. I would describe the scent as citrus and spicy, a little sweet. I remember Jean Nate from when I was a kid but I don&#x27;t know what it smelled like then so I cannot comment on if it is the same scent or not.</li>
    <li> My favorite bath power.</li>
    <li> Always a good buy for an old classic.  Love it.</li>
    <li> I purchased this item to use under my arms and other hidden places rather than the Gold Bond (which was ok but smelled medicated). I must say I am pleased with this powder. I was scared to try it because I thought it would irritate me but it doesn&#x27;t. I ordered the splash to compliment the powder so I hope it&#x27;s ok as well. The scent of this powder is pleasant and light. Nothing overbearing. I will be purchasing this again when I run low.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried to order and find in reg stores..I&#x27;m so glad you had it can&#x27;t wait to order more time</li>
    <li> was one of my mother-in-laws favorite. This was hard to fine and I was glad to accommodate her while she stayed with us.</li>
    <li> I looked into seven local area pharmacies and drug stores to no avail.  Jean Nate&#x27; has been my mother&#x27;s scent \\&quot;forever\\&quot; -- gentle, soft, and comforting.&lt;br /&gt;I am so glad that she can continue to enjoy this body power for her 95th year.  Thanks!</li>
    <li> I am a fan of Jean Nate Body Powder too.  I say that as I also use Wind Song Dusting Powder.  Both are excellent!</li>
    <li> very happy with Jean Nate.  Glad I found it.  Someone wanted it for xmas.  Served the purpose just fine for me</li>
    <li> I would have given this 5 stars except the powder puff started falling apart during the second week.  I do like the fragrance and softness of the powder.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my mom. She loves jean nate and its hard to locate in stores.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always liked Jean Nate bath products, and I wanted a nice fluffy powder puff and container for my bathroom countertop. This was perfect! The only reason I&#x27;m giving it 4 stars is I think it&#x27;s a bit over-priced. I&#x27;ll probably re-fill the container with some nice baby powder.</li>
    <li> I live in HOT socal and this really helps keep me fresh on those gross sweaty days. I never thought I would use something like this bc my mother does.... BUT now I understand why!!</li>
    <li> Glad to see this is still being made! Love to use this powder and have done so since my early 20&#x27;s. Very fresh scent!</li>
    <li> Great transaction. Would recommend</li>
    <li> Fits the purpose I bought it for.</li>
    <li> Memories of years ago. Loved it then. Love it now!</li>
    <li> I had been looking for a nice, light, and refreshing body powder for quite sometime. I had read many positive reviews about this particular body powder and was intrigued enough to buy it, and I love it! It leaves my skin nice and soft. It&#x27;s a strong citrus scent right when you put it on, but as the day goes on it leaves a lovely faint scent that is absolutely catching.</li>
    <li> Purchased for my mother. She liked it very much.</li>
    <li> This sent brings back memories of my mom. I bought it for my 20 year old daughter who needed a new puff and I am so glad I did.</li>
    <li> No more &#x27;tinkie&#x27;----smell me-----&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Diane</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always come back to Jean Nate. I&#x27;ve tried many many other brands and there is just something about jean nate that the other brands just don&#x27;t have..Super Product</li>
    <li> THE POWDER WAS JUST WHAT I WANTED.&lt;br /&gt;CBS</li>
