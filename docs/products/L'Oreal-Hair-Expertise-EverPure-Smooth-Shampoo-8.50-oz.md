<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using for several weeks. It lathers well, smells amazing (a truly different but subtle smell of rosemary) and does as advertised (cleanses and protects).</li>
    <li> This is a great shampoo  THE BEST</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used it for years.  I have shiny, happy hair.  (Even with color and highlights.)</li>
    <li> THIS IS A GREAT SHAMPOO IN MANY RESPECTS, THICK LOVELY SMELLING LATHER, SAFE FOR COLOR TREATED HAIR, NO NEED FOR CONDITIONER. NO SULFATES. BUT I HAVE RECENTLY SWITCHED TO AN ALL NATURAL ORGANIC SHAMPOO -- TATE&#x27;S, ALSO AVAILABLE ON AMAZON -- BECAUSE I DON&#x27;T NEED EXPOSURE TO PARABENS AND A HOST OF OTHER CHEMICALS TO GET CLEAN, SOFT HAIR. A COMPARISON OF INGREDIENTS SAYS IT ALL.   SO THIS SITS ON THE SHELF UNOPENED. IF YOU ARE FINE WITH COMMERCIAL SHAMPOOS, THIS IS A GOOD ONE. BUT FOR ME, IT&#x27;S NO LONGER GOOD ENOUGH.</li>
    <li> I have naturally curly, dry, color and Keratin treated hair.  I was surprised I liked this shampoo so much.  Much better that my $25 a bottle salon purchased brand.  It has a lovely smell that reminds me of Avaeda salon smell.  My hair is soft, moisturized, bouncy and less frizzy.  I definitely would reccommend!!!</li>
    <li> I had never tried sulfate free shampoo before, but I cannot imagine being more pleased. My hair feels lighter and fuller. The aroma in the shampoo is great. I would recommend this highly to anyone.</li>
    <li> My very favorite shampoo bar none!! It leaves hair smooth!!</li>
    <li> I have curly hair and have looked for years for a product that smoothes my hair without making it greasy so I don&#x27;t have to wash it every day.  This is excellent smoothing shampoo, doesn&#x27;t strip my color, and I don&#x27;t have to wash every day.  I can wear it curly or blowdry it straight and it works either way.  It&#x27;s magic in my eyes!</li>
    <li> My scalp hates sulfites and will generate giant flakes merely at the mention of SLS-based shampoo.  I was using the Lush shampoo bars for a while (the old formula for the \\&quot;New\\&quot; scent didn&#x27;t have sulfites), but then they switched from sodium coco sulfate to sodium lauryl sulfate and my scalp starting flaking again.  Rather than try yet another Lush shampoo bar (at $10 a pop), I gave the L&#x27;Oreal shampoo a shot and no more flakes.     My hair has a lot more body, and is smoother and more manageable!  It really feels \\&quot;clean\\&quot; and isn&#x27;t weighed down.  I use a dab of this, followed by the EverStrong smooth conditioner in the morning.</li>
    <li> I used this awhile ago so I can&#x27;t remember if my hair was really soft or whatever, but I remember being shocked at how well my dyed hair looked. The color usually washes out so fast but it looked great for weeks. I used the herbal essence color stuff and also the garnier one and both washed it out pretty much like regular shampoo.</li>
    <li> One of my favorite low cost shampoos. perfect for color treated hair. makes hair smooth and easy to manage. I am not a fan of its smell though. That&#x27;s why I tried other shampoos from the same L&#x27;oreal Sulfate-Free series, but none of them worked as well as this one. I use it with the L&#x27;Oreal Paris EverPure Sulfate-Free Color Care System Smooth Conditioner, which has a heavier smell, but works really well together with the shampoo.</li>
    <li> I picked this up, liking the idea behind it and as a cheaper alternative to salon products.  I used it the first time I shampooed after having my hair colored (and I always wait at least two to three days before shampooing after a fresh hair color).  After I was done with my shower, I noticed colored water on the floor of the shower (this has never happened when I use professional products).  Not really thinking anything of it (maybe my hairdresser didn&#x27;t get all of the color out??), I proceeded to style my hair, and noticed that it was dull, no shine to my hair at all.  Thinking that maybe the dullness came from a new frizz serum I had bought, I used the shampoo again the next time I washed my hair.  Again, colored water on the bottom of the shower and dullness.  Today, I went back to my professional shampoo and lo and behold....no colored water left behind and my hair had a brilliant shine to it (even with using the frizz serum!).  I will be definitely throwing the bottle out and sticking to my professional products.</li>
    <li> Great value: this shampoo is very effective at removing all the buildup from miscellaneous hair products.  It lathers well and has a pleasant smell.  I have very fine, typically blonde, heavily processed hair. Keratin treatments work really well after just one wash with this shampoo. Conveniently packaged for 1-2 weeks long travel, too -- if you don&#x27;t trust hotel shampoos.</li>
    <li> This shampoo really does smooth my hair.  I&#x27;ve also bought the conditioner but if I forget to use it sometimes, the shampoo is enough to smooth my thick, wavy hair which has a tendency to frizz.  Once, I bought their moisture shampoo by accident and using that alone, my hair was back to frizzy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has been kind to my color and I love how soft my hair feels with this product.  Finally, a smoothing product that works and doesn&#x27;t feel like it&#x27;s greasy or slick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this if you&#x27;re the type that has to use the hair dryer and flat iron to straighten your hair.  I now don&#x27;t even have to blow dry my hair and it comes out nice and smooth.  I&#x27;m thrilled I can just buy this at the local grocery store.  I thought I&#x27;d check here to see if the price was better but it isn&#x27;t.  I wanted to leave a review though to say the product is great though.</li>
    <li> I love the way this makes my hair feel and it smells great! I am in love with this shampoo!It doesn&#x27;t even take much of this product so it is very cost effective!</li>
    <li> lathers good for sulfate shampoo, but smells like medicine, did not leave my hair soft, won&#x27;t buy again mostly because of smell.</li>
    <li> The smell is horrible</li>
    <li> is the best of the better recommend all people soft shine manegable too much good</li>
    <li> This is said to help with colored hair... It stripped my high.. Extremely disappointed.</li>
    <li> This shampoo smells great. I recently switched to sulfate free shampoos and this is really gentle. I didn&#x27;t notice a lot of smoothing for my frizzy coarse hair, but no shampoo really helps that. I was surprised to see this about $3 less than my local store. Will buy again.</li>
    <li> I really, really like this product. I did some research for a long time on products that contain sulfate and realized that it was causing alot of my skin and hair problems. I had no idea that sulfate was such a harsh ingredient on not only color treated hair, but your skin-especially if you have sensitive skin!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This shampoo leaves your hair noticeably softer and healthier. It also dramatically decreases the amount of breakage you have in your hair. I always just thought I \\&quot;shed\\&quot; alot, but now I know it&#x27;s because i wasn&#x27;t using a quality shampoo! Within 48 hours my hair and skin was softer, clearer and stronger. I HIGHLY recommend this shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some things you&#x27;ll need to get used to, which i was unaware of, is that because it is sulfate free, it doesn&#x27;t lather like a regular shampoo would. But, you also don&#x27;t need to use as much of it either. The smell also takes some getting used to. It smells good, just different. I also wish the bottle was bigger. It&#x27;s only 8.5 oz...but again you don&#x27;t need to use as much of it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried many shampoos over the years for colored hair but the color always faded pretty fast.  This one is by far the best, the color doesn&#x27;t fade nearly as fast, i can go approx. 5 months between colorings, and the price is right!</li>
    <li> I love everything about this shampoo except the bottle it comes in. It can be difficult to squeeze the shampoo from the bottle (esp. with slight nerve difficulties in my elbow presently). The cap collects water but does not come off to get it out so it just dribbles old, cold water out the next time I use it. None of this will deter me from buying this product in the future. It is great shampoo! : )</li>
    <li> I picked this product up as it was in the discount section at the grocery store.  So,did I ever get a great buy.  Love this shampoo and get compliments on my hair every time I use it.  My hair shines and has more body.  I use Henna and it makes my color look rich and alive. I will be buying this next time I run out of allll my shampoos.</li>
    <li> Smells artificially perfumed, definitely not for guys!</li>
    <li> Sometimes sulfate-free shampoos don&#x27;t lather at all and I miss that feeling.  This lathers nicely, and leaves my hair pretty tangle free after washing.  In the dry winter I need a conditioner every day along with the shampoo, but in the summer it leaves my hair soft and smooth enough to skip the conditioner much of the time.  I have lots of hair, but it is very fine as opposed to coarse, and because it is slightly wavy it can be frizzy and this helps to keep that frizz under control.</li>
    <li> There is something very special about this shampoo, and I can&#x27;t put my finger on it. When you wash your hair with it..it&#x27;s like there is maybe some kind of silky-ness to the shampoo itself. It feels amazing washing your hair with this stuff. It smells nice, and It hydrates your hair.</li>
    <li> This product is NOT Sulfate free. It&#x27;s listed in the ingredients and it lathers like crazy, causing hair to fade faster. Super false advertisement. the ingredient is listed as &amp;#34;Sodium Lauryl Sulfoacetate.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> This shampoo is terrific!  My hair is colored red, and red looses its color much sooner than other dyes.  This shampoo keeps my color strong until the next touch up.</li>
    <li> I was very surprised on how clean my hair and scalp feels after using L&#x27;Oreal Paris EverPure Smooth Shampoo.  I also don&#x27;t have to use any coniditioner on my very long hair.  That saves me a lot of money.</li>
    <li> This is a great product for my colored hair, I won&#x27;t trade it for anything. My hair looks and feels awesome.</li>
    <li> Works , doesn&#x27;t dry out scalp and keeps color. Been using for over a year. Doesn&#x27;t work as well guess my hair got used to it but its a very nice product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve got fine dry hair and I&#x27;m not sure that this was the ideal shampoo for me to be using. I was looking for a less expensive sulfate free shampoo and probably got what I paid for. I can&#x27;t attest to the &amp;#34;smoothing&amp;#34; properties of this shampoo since I really didn&#x27;t see it do much of that (to my frizzy hair), though the scent was very pleasing (light floral). The shampoo definitely weighed my hair down quite a bit, but didn&#x27;t smooth it per-se... it left this kinda greasy feeling. I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;d buy this shampoo for fine/frizzy/dry hair type.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like this product because a day after I have washed my hair, my hair is no longer bouncy and feels dirty and greasy.</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo because it&#x27;s sulfate free, has a creamy consistency, and is inexpensive.  I have thick wavy hair that often gets dry ends, but using a sulfate free shampoo helps my hair retain moisture. I also recommend putting a little bit of conditioner on your ends before applying shampoo. This will ensure that your ends aren&#x27;t overly stripped of any moisture. Overall, love these cheap sulfate-free shampoos!</li>
    <li> Love this shampoo and got it at a good price</li>
    <li> I wanted to try a sulfate free shampoo and decided on this one after I smelled it.  Divine!  My hair is fine, but wavy and tends to frizz if there&#x27;s any moisture in the air.  This shampoo (and the conditioner) smooths any frizz I have, but it also tends to weigh my hair down a bit.  Not completely flat, but enough to frustrate.  I imagine this is for harder to control hair than my own.  I may put it away for now and try again in the summer/humid months when my hair is harder to tame.</li>
    <li> I always get my hair colored every few months, and this time around I thought I&#x27;d try a sulfate free shampoo &amp; conditioner because of all the great reviews. After I got my hair colored, this was the first shampoo &amp; conditioner I used on it. My hair was so dry and frizzy after I used it. I have always had very smooth and shiny hair so I was shocked to see it so dried out. I thought for sure my color had been overprocessed and I was so upset. I called my hairdresser and I had my hair deep conditioned and even had a keratin treatment. As soon as I was able to wash my hair after the keratin treatment, I used this same shampoo &amp; conditioner. And once again, my hair was dry &amp; frizzy. I finally got rid of this stuff, and my hair has returned to normal. Unfortunately for me, this product just made the texture of my hair awful! Never again.</li>
    <li> I use this along with the smoothing conditioner and it helps my dry, fine hair get the moisture it needs. It also helps greatly with the frizzies I get in the humid summer months.</li>
    <li> Read the ingredients on the back of L&#x27;oreal&#x27;s so called &amp;#34;sulfate-free&amp;#34; shampoos.  Sodium Lauryl Sulfoacetate.  Sodium Lauroyl Sarcosinate.  Unclear as to how L&#x27;Oreal is getting away with this.</li>
    <li> ...check around for lowest prices and it is available for a cheaper price if you join the Subscribe and Save or if you add it to an order of $35.00 or more..  I also think it is true that it doesn&#x27;t fade my colored hair as well.</li>
    <li> My hair stylist recommended sulfate-free shampoo to battle dried out ends.  It works wonderfully well and I&#x27;ve used it for over 2 years at this point.  I won&#x27;t use any other shampoo.  It has also helped me to transition into washing my hair less and less so a bottle of this lasts me months.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure how long I&#x27;ll use this to see if it helps my damaged hair.  It&#x27;s heavily perfumed and not in a good way.</li>
    <li> Excellent shampoo and it smells great.  I use the conditioner also, and I will be purchasing this product again in the future.</li>
    <li> It was ok, but my hair didn&#x27;t feel as sleek as I thought it would when washing it with this product.</li>
    <li> This shampoo does miracles on my hair! It takes away all the frizz. Amazing!</li>
    <li> Love this product. Great for coloured hair. The only thing is it does leave a residue on my towels. A small complaint. Also sulphate free.</li>
    <li> I work a dirty, sweaty, smelly job, so I need a shampoo that really gets the job done at the end of the day. Unfortunately, that means my hair gets dried out and crunchy from the detergents in the shampoo. So I heard about the sulfate free stuff and how it&#x27;s supposed to be less damaging, so I thought I&#x27;d give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately I have to say it just did not work for me. It does not lather, so it feels like you&#x27;re trying to wash your hair with hand cream. It doesn&#x27;t really rinse out, making me feel like I just had an oily residue that had bonded with all the dirt, oil, and smell on my hair and made a big greasy mess. Also, my scalp is naturally oily and the shampoo just made it feel dirty and itchy. I finally had to jump out of the shower and grab a bottle of regular shampoo and wash about three times to get the sulfate free stuff out of my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe this would be good if your hair and scalp are dry and don&#x27;t really get dirty during the course of your day. But if you really need a shampoo to thoroughly clean your hair, I don&#x27;t think sulfate free can do the job. I&#x27;d stick with a normal sulfate shampoo and just get a really good conditioner to use afterward.</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo and the fact that it is sulfate free.  My hair feels great and not all dried out.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a good shampoo that will treat my color gently, keep the fizz under control, and not break my bank.  I&#x27;m very pleased with this shampoo, it has fit the bill on every point.  I have baby fine hair which always has me sporting a &amp;#34;halo&amp;#34; of fine fuzzies.  Also I use demi-permanent color, and usually after a couple of washes, the stubborn grays show right up.  This treats my hair so much better.  I feel there&#x27;s extra weight to my flyaways and the texture is just so smooth I find I&#x27;m constantly touching my hair.  When I let my hair air dry it looks so much better than any other product.  It was what I was hoping for when I tried Wen and for a fraction of the price.</li>
    <li> She loves this shampoo.  I don&#x27;t know why but when I asked her to rate it, she said, &amp;#34;give it a five&amp;#34;!  So I did.</li>
    <li> I have been coloring and/or highlighting my hair on and off for almost 15 years. I recently colored my hair again. Due to some budget constraints, I wanted a color protecting shampoo (and sulfate free if I could) that was a little more affordable. After reading some reviews, I decided to try this line. It was AWFUL. It did not make my hair feel clean at all. Even when wet, it still felt dirty. After less than 24 hours from washing my hair, my hair would look like I hadn&#x27;t washed it in three days. I have NEVER had this problem before. Due to my hair type, I generally go every other day to wash my hair. There is no way to do that with this shampoo and conditioner. I did not change any other products on my hair, it was only this that changed. It also severely dried out my hair. After using it for about a week and a half, I threw it away and I switched to Redken (which I have used before), and my hair was back to its healthy, shiny, and clean self immediately.Seriously, it is the worst shampoo I have ever used in my hair and a waste of money.</li>
    <li> Love it! Makes my hair feel great.  Stopped my hair from feeling dry and brittle.</li>
    <li> l am always receiving compliments on my hair, which is quite fine, when I use this shampoo as it imparts a very natural looking sheen to my hair.  A plus is that it really smells good.  I was very pleased to see that the manufacturer changed the color of the cap as it previously was identical to the EverPure conditioner which I also use and which I accidentally used instead of the shampoo.  Now that the caps are different colors, I will not be making that mistake again.</li>
    <li> I am not sure how this shampoo has got such goo rating. I have keratin treated hair and I was looking for sulphate free shampoo and this shampoo has damaged my hair. I have asian , wavy , black hair and now it&#x27;s dry , damaged , black hair. On top of it I feel so itchy after using this shampoo. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it to people who have done keratin treatment to use this shampoo.</li>
    <li> After sending my daughter to two other schools, she ends up in a beauty school, well.....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She ran through the beauty &amp;#34;heads&amp;#34; and then friends and family and it became time for me to donate my hair....for coloring.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She insisted that I should have &amp;#34;speshul&amp;#34; shampoo and conditioner, but seeing salon prices, I cowered in fear. After all, what school will I have to pay for next year?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I consulted my friends at amazon and purchased this without regrets. I really want to go on TV and shake my wavy locks and smile...but guys with receding hairlines evidently don&#x27;t sell hair products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At first I was worried that I&#x27;d smell like a woman, but after thinking it over I concluded that they probably smell better than me in general anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I recommend this duo of products if you want shiny, manageable hair that retains coloring longer....and if you&#x27;ll need the extra money to pay for another school.</li>
    <li> Love this sulfate free shampoo and conditioner!  By far the best on the market for the price!</li>
    <li> Love all of the Loreal Smoothing products!  My daughter and I both have thick, coarse, curly hair and always use these products!</li>
    <li> This L&#x27;Oreal Paris EverPure Sulfate-Free Shampoo for color treated hair, it seems like it helps the color to last longer</li>
    <li> I had read that you should use sulfate-free shampoo if you are losing hair on top of your head. Well, I am so I tried it and although it isn&#x27;t a miracle cure, it does seem to help some.</li>
    <li> Great for a sulfate-free shampoo, and you can&#x27;t beat the price. I&#x27;m on my 2nd bottle and plan to continue using it. It lathers more than the last sulfate-free shampoo I used, and my color is staying put. As other reviewers noted, the scent is a bit odd but I actually like it. At this price, it&#x27;s worth a try.</li>
    <li> Love this shampoo!  The smell is wonderful, it cleans and lathers very well too.  One tip is that I found the generic version of this at Rite Aid.  It normally sells there for $5.99, but was on sale for $4.49.  When I got to the check out, because I have the store card to get extra discounts, I ended up paying $3.99 a tube, which is unbeatable.  That&#x27;s a steal!  I definitely recommend this shampoo and the conditioner for anyone with colored hair or for the fact that it is sulfate free.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t believe this is sulfate free with all the lather it makes?  It leaves hair dry and unmanageable.</li>
    <li> Love love love t5his shampoo! A super small amount (dime size with my short hair) is all that is needed, and the lather and cleansing is fantastic!</li>
    <li> Hair color is still going strong after a couple months.</li>
    <li> Wow! I&#x27;ve been looking all over for a color safe shampoo &amp; this is perfect! It smells good, leaves your hair soft &amp; clean, &amp; most importantly, it leaves color in!  have teal &amp; green hair &amp; it works wonders.</li>
    <li> this works wonderfully and for only a few bucks too. if you&#x27;re looking for a shampoo that will leave your hair shiny and smelling lovely then this is good stuff</li>
    <li> my hair is super dry and damaged. this is by far the best shampoo I&#x27;ve ever used and everyone compliments me on my hair when I use it. If I don&#x27;t use it you can tell. great price too! thanks!</li>
    <li> Bought this to use after getting a keratin treatment. Needed a good sulfate free shampoo and conditioner for colored hair. This product was awesome from first use. Made my hair super soft and silky. I bought more to stock up it worked so great.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve found the L&#x27;Oreal sulfate free for curly hair to be better for my fine curls.</li>
    <li> Not color safe. Turned my salon dyed ash blond hair brassy.</li>
    <li> This shampoo has changed my hair.  I will never go back to a shampoo with sulfate!  I just wish they sold it in a bigger bottle because I use it up pretty quickly.</li>
    <li> Very much like this shampoo.</li>
    <li> Love this shampoo ... My hair has neve looked so healthy.</li>
    <li> Great product but the one for volume smells better.i will buy again but different fragrance.have a good day&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;wt h</li>
    <li> This definitely got me by surprise. This is a great sulfate-free product! I&#x27;m surprised because of the price - its really a great product for its price. I feel that my hair is more alive with this product - more bounce! In terms of moisturizing my hair and smoothing it out, it does a decent job. Its not the best product to use if thats really what you need but it gets the job done. In terms of the bottle design - yes, water does get into the lid. It won&#x27;t get in the bottle itself, but it is a little annoying; however, most bottle that are made like this do that so it really shouldn&#x27;t be a surprise. After all, you&#x27;re buying this for the product, not for the bottle it comes in. Also, if you don&#x27;t know, sulfate can be very drying to your hair and most shampoos have it so that they create more bubbles. This shampoo has enough bubbles so don&#x27;t worry - and you will really feel your hair becoming healthier with a sulfate-free shampoo. Overall, 5 stars - its a great sulfate-free shampoo that has a great price tag to go with it!</li>
    <li> I have green hair, I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s because of the dye or the shampoo but my dye washes off faster than before</li>
    <li> Wife loves this product.</li>
    <li> Not that harsh on your hair.</li>
    <li> Have been using this particular shampoo for years.  It was the first sulfate-free product I found in the store.  Am very pleased because a little goes a long way and my &#x27;enhanced&#x27; hair color does not fade!  Will continue buying it.</li>
    <li> I have tried several different shampoos over the last two years to help, manage my wavy, frizzy hair, including Wen, Super Skinny, and Frizz Ease. I did not like the greasy, heavy feeling of the first two and did not find Frizz Ease very effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This shampoo makes my hair feel clean, not greasy and heavy, and does an excellent job of reducing the frizz! I alternate between the SMOOTH SHAMPOO and the MOISTURE SHAMPOO.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve seen some reviews complaining about the pine scent. I have no problem with the scent but if you do, stick with the MOISTURE SHAMPOO. The scent is milder on that one.</li>
    <li> I excitedly purchased this product (along with the conditioner) after reading through the reviews. I have thick hair that has a tendency to dry out at the ends. My hair felt soft after the first wash, but after about two weeks of regular use it just made my hair feel greasy. It also has this strong menthol-like odor that I really dislike. I&#x27;m surprised no one else had mentioned the smell, that&#x27;s all I notice unless I blow dry my hair and use another product to mask it.</li>
    <li> If you have colored hair and want the color to last longer, this is what you want to get. Unlike many sulfate-free shampoos, this one &amp;#34;suds up&amp;#34; really well. My hair stylist even recommended this brand to me after I got my hair colored, over more expensive salon brands. Get the matching conditioner for best results.</li>
    <li> I have thick, curly, usually frizzy hair.  This shampoo is the best I have ever used, it makes my hair not only feel clean but soft and manageable.  I have a business where I make bath and beauty products, including liquid soaps but I have not been able to match anything that comes anywhere close to this shampoo.  I buy this on subscribe and save and one time I got a warning that it would take over a month to ship and I nearly freaked out, luckily Amazon was able to get it back in sooner than expected. My mother also now buys this one in the Moisture type.  I don&#x27;t even need a conditioner with this shampoo, but I bought the companion one for a \\&quot;once in a while\\&quot; use.  Excellent product.</li>
    <li> After coloring my hair for almost ten years, I took a break a couple of years ago after developing a PPD allergy. After bouncing around between a few sulfate-free brands, I took a friend&#x27;s advice and have been using [[ASIN:B002LMBLTY Trader Joe&#x27;s Tea Tree Tingle Shampoo with Peppermint, Tea Tree and Eucalyptus Botanicals, 16-Ounces]] and [[ASIN:B002LMNJDA Trader Joe&#x27;s Tea Tree Tingle Conditioner with Peppermint and Eucalyptus - Cruelty Free]] for the past two years. However, I thought this might be too abrasive after color-treating my hair again. My stylist recommended Redken or L&#x27;oreal. I mentioned that I had switched to sulfate-free products, and she said the thought L&#x27;Oreal had a sulfate-free line. I picked this up at the drugstore, along with the [[ASIN:B001P1ZEMC L&#x27;Oreal Paris EverPure Smooth Conditioner, 8.5-Fluid Ounce]], and after the first wash my hair was SO dry. I thought it might be from having my ends lightened, but it got worse and worse over the next couple of weeks -- my hair felt like straw, and I&#x27;d never had a problem with dryness in the past.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After reading a lot of reviews, I just switched to [[ASIN:B005BA5PZ4 ALTERNA ALTERNA ALTERNA Bamboo UV+ Color Protection Vibrant Color Shampoo 8.5 oz 8.5 oz 8.5 oz]] and [[ASIN:B004Q23AFU ALTERNA ALTERNA Bamboo Abundant Volume Conditioner 8.5 oz 8.5 oz]]. I hesitated at the $20 price tag but my hair IMMEDIATELY felt better. It&#x27;s smoother and softer.</li>
    <li> A friend recommended the L&#x27;Oreal Sulfate Free line of shampoos/conditioners. I was skeptical at first that it would really make a difference in my hair. I have dyed hair, that is pretty thick, with a slight wave in the back. Its usually really frizzy in the winter time so doing anything other then putting it up in a pony is not possible. With this shampoo, it felt very different in the shower, has a nice clean almost minty scent, with a nice lather. I followed this up with the conditioner for soft, frizz free hair.</li>
    <li> My mom was very pleased with this product. Thank you</li>
    <li> Smells great and leaves my hair very moisturized!</li>
    <li> This stuff smells great! It&#x27;s an earthy clean scent, not overpowering fake flowers.  My hair is super smooth, I use all of these products.</li>
    <li> Love this. Keeps my hair smooth.</li>
    <li> Prior to using this product, I was purchasing high end salon products for $20-30 per bottle. I would typically switch brands a few times a year as the affects would seem to wear off after a while or I would get bored with the product. I find this conditioner to be on par with or better than those products. I have now been using this conditioner exclusively (or others from this same line) for over a year and I have abandoned all other brands. Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> First of all the image shown above is wrong.  It is displayed as green text and cap but it is actually orange.  Besides that, I think it lathers well.  The smell is rosemary and juniper.  Smells quite refreshing to me, but I know some people who do not really like that.  I just dyed my hair so I was searching for a shampoo that is sulfate-free and since I used Loreal hair dye box, I thought I might as well stick to or try Loreal products.  It says &amp;#34;smooth&amp;#34; but my hair feels pretty much same.  Maybe a slight less frizzy but I still get puffy hair if I do not flat iron it or anything.  I usually just leave my hair air dry.  I think I might lose less hair with this shampoo than my other shampoos as I shower but I only used this twice.. so I need more time to observe.  Overall, I am glad it is sulfate-free to protect my colored hair but I was hoping it can do more for my frizzy/puffy hair.</li>
    <li> I switched to sulfate free shampoo 3 years ago on recommendation from my hair dresser.  I had been buying the brand she recommended, but that was starting to get expensive.  I was underwhelmed by the famous infomercial &amp;#34;cleansing conditioner,&amp;#34; so I switched to this.  It works just as well and leaves my hair soft and smooth.  Definitely helps control frizz and helps color last longer.</li>
    <li> This shampoo and accompanying conditioner are awful. Horrible itchy scalp and dandruff are the result for me when I have never been prone to dandruff before.  I have fine hair if that matters.  I&#x27;ve used them together, and also used just one or the other and no matter what they destroy my scalp. I just changed to Theorie green tea shampoo and conditioner that I found for a low price at a local discount store and after 3 days dandruff is almost completely cleared up.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful line of products! I wear my hair in a short bob and it smooths the hair without making it oily looking.  It also seems to give it added body.  Excellent product.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t notice any difference (for better or worse) in my hair texture or the duration of my hair color.</li>
    <li> Nice lather; clean rinse and hair that&#x27;s still fresh and soft at the end of the day.  No problem with color fade.  I&#x27;ve been using this product for a few years - it&#x27;s that good.</li>
    <li> Works but still burns if you get it in your eyes</li>
    <li> This is the first Sulfate-Free brand that I&#x27;ve liked.  Keeps my hair healthy!  Most sulfate-free shampoos don&#x27;t adequate lather up but this generate great lather which results in clean hair.  No sulfates results in healthy hair!</li>
    <li> I really enjoy this shampoo mostly for its refreshing scent. Juniper and rosemary. So fresh and crisp. I wish the conditioner had the same scent too.  Makes my hair feel great.</li>
    <li> I like this product but I live in a small town and could not find it.&lt;br /&gt;Prompt delivery.&lt;br /&gt;Very good product, especially of woman with fine hair.&lt;br /&gt;Recommend this product and this site.</li>
    <li> Love this shampoo.  It is gentle on your hair and leaves your hair clean.  Also use the conditioner and deep conditioner in this same line.</li>
    <li> My hair is completely different since I started using the products.&lt;br /&gt;They are great! They are a little on the \\&quot;expensive\\&quot; side from your market products.&lt;br /&gt;Leaves my hair with volume and smelling great</li>
    <li> The reason I bought was to take care of my color treated hair and love how it makes my hair super soft and silky.</li>
    <li> I had a keratin treatment done about 2.5 months ago.  I purchased the recommended shampoo and conditioner from the salon for $60 and within 2 months had to buy more.  That is too expensive.  So I did my research and learned what ingredients to avoid (sulfates, which I was already doing, and sodium chloride).  This shampoo and conditioner are keratin treatment approved.  I was being to think at the 2 month mark that the keratin treatment was wearing off.  My hair was starting to get frizzy again, closer to back to normal.  THEN I used this shampoo and conditioner, and my hair is amazing again!  It is noticeably smoother and shinier.  I&#x27;m thrilled.  Not only did I save about $50, I&#x27;m getting better results.  I&#x27;ve tried lots of different shampoos and conditioners.  I&#x27;ve noticed when I didn&#x27;t like a product, but I can&#x27;t say I&#x27;ve ever been sure that a product has made my hair better.  This is the first time I actually was amazed by the improvement.  My husband even noticed.  This is a keeper!</li>
    <li> This has to be the best shampoo and conditioner I have ever used. It&#x27;s the first set that I can use without my head itching. I have really bad allergies and everything makes my scalp itch. Not only that but it makes my hair feel amazing. I can run my fingers through my hair when wet before brushing it and it&#x27;s not even tangled. It&#x27;s so smooth, less frizz (practically none), color still looks great, and just overall looks amazing. I wish the bottles were a little larger, but I&#x27;m learning that I a little goes a long way. My hair feels so clean and moisturized. And the smell... Oh my gosh the smell is great.</li>
    <li> I have bleached and processed hair.  It makes my hair really dry and tangly, completely stripped of oils.  It does not help with color retention.  I agree with others who are saying that they replaced the SLS with other sulfates, as this really does lather way too well.  Before I bleached my hair and only had lifted highlights, this stuff was still drying but somewhat manageable after putting in conditioner immediately - would not give this more than 2 to 3 stars as a shampoo for regular hair to begin with.  Now it&#x27;s just useless.</li>
    <li> This actually did prevent my red color in my hard to dye black hair from running everytime I washed it which was once a week or every two week. It also smells nice and being sulfate free is a plus as since 2010 I stopped using Sulfate based shampoos and I never want to go back.  It lasted for about two months because I dont wash my hair that often since it is of the 4b dry type but its not such a big bottle. Also not hard to find in drugstores if you dont want to wait for your hair products in the mail.</li>
    <li> The scent is so strong I could not use it.</li>
    <li> I have really thick curly hair and have been attempting to manage it since I was a little girl. I have tried many products including Wen products which are also sulfate free. Wen offers some good products but Everpure beats out even the Wen. What&#x27;s great about this shampoo is only need about a 1/3 of what I would use with other products and it&#x27;s lathers like regular shampoo but doesn&#x27;t contain the harsh sulfates. It leaves my hair clean but light and moisturized. The pairing conditioner is a must have! You will be addicted to this stuff and never want to return to regular shampoo and conditioner! People stop me on a regular basis and ask what products I use. I couldn&#x27;t be happier with the results. I also recommend Pantene curling mouse level 4 for styling of thick curly hair.</li>
    <li> I love the shampoo with the green lid.  The shampoo with the orange lid was sent to me.  The title is not matching the picture.  I did not notice that until the shampoo came in the mail.  I did not return because of the shipping costs.  Please make sure the description matches the picture of the product.</li>
    <li> After using regularly product made my hair come out by the handfuls. .This product is supposed to be the closest thing to Pureology($60 shampoo) Sulfate is an additive that helps in lathering which also strips ur hair..&lt;br /&gt;It still lathers up pretty well..&amp; still strips hair although sulfate free.. what did they substitute the sulfate for?</li>
    <li> My daughter uses this for her bleached and colored hair. She hasn&#x27;t complained, so I guess she likes it.</li>
    <li> I actually love this shampoo, but this time it shipped to me with a dark orange lid which is the lid that is supposed to be on the conditioner bottle, and not the shampoo. It may have just been a factory mistake, but it has me concerned so I didn&#x27;t use it.</li>
    <li> Wife says good for color treated hair.  Works great for her.</li>
    <li> I was &amp;#34;sent&amp;#34; in this direction by another reviewer who stated that this worked great for her keratin treated hair. It absolutely does! It doesn&#x27;t strip the keratin from your hair at all, and since this is my first keratin treatment and I am about two months in I absolutely feel that it helps the keratin stay where it&#x27;s supposed to. The only reason I gave it four instead of five stars is I&#x27;m not a big fan of the scent (rosemary juniper) but that of course is a matter of preference and has no impact on weather or not it works well. In addition Walmart sells multiple varieties of the everpure shampoo and conditioner and I was able to pick up a came line fragrance which works just as well but you get the 30% more free bottle.</li>
    <li> Picture shows lavender tube with light green lid. What I got was lavender with orange lid. This is getting really common with orders of small items from Amazon. There isn&#x27;t as much attention to detail.</li>
