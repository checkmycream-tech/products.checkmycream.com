      <li>and you will love it.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Every time we were in Paris we would get a couple more, settling on Silver Mountain water and Millesime Imperial as our favorites.</li>
      <li>One of my most favorite scents.  </li>
      <li>This is my husband&#x27;s favorite cologne.</li>
      <li>It is definitely authentic.</li>
      <li>&lt;br /&gt;sold and procured by Amazon is actually authentic.</li>
      <li>This is one of my all time favorite Creed colognes.  </li>

      <li>It took while to be sent, but it was the genuine article.  </li>
      <li>Love love love Creed...but definitely don&#x27;t like the pricetag.  </li>
      <li>To me it has a citrus followed by a clean soapy/inky smell.</li>
      <li>it does have a good vibe per say, but it doesn&#x27;t last at least compare to Adventus which is my favorite from the house of creed (maybe do to the fact that is like pheromones to my wife lol).</li>
      <li>I have been using this particular Creed Scent for many years now and used to buy it at a flagship Creed retailer.</li>
      <li>Perfect smell not strong very sensual.</li>
      <li>THANKS SOOOOO MUCH AMAZON FOR THE THE AUTHENTIC  SILVER MOUNTAIN WATER.THE FRAGRANCE</li>
      <li>only took a star off my rating, because amazon does not tell you that it is classified as a hazardous material and prime shipping</li>
      <li>The first two bottles were all right (both supplied by FragranceNet), with the correct scent, bottle, and packaging.</li>
      <li>This product has the old creed sprayer thats huge still..</li>
      <li>and will be coming back to buy more.</li>
      <li>The amount of compliments it generated was amusing, because it was virtually unknown in the states.</li>
      <li>I have about 20 colognes and this one is my 2nd favorite.</li>
      <li>At this time they were more available in the states but for the down payment of and arm.</li>
      <li>This cologne is masculine, fresh with</li>
      <li>it is the real deal.</li>
      <li>Creed is ten times better at this price especially when its legit!</li>
      <li>I think the first one I got was Irish Tweed.</li>
      <li>/&gt;i actually bought 3 other perfumes which were okay</li>
      <li>a soft musk finish that and lasts all day.  </li>
      <li>I do recommend whoever trying a sampler before purchasing though!&lt;br /&gt;Bought direct from amazon</li>
      <li>so far thing is legit.</li>
      <li>This bottle was sold by Amazon, not a marketplace seller, so beware that some old gray-market bottles are being sold by Amazon, and they are not returnable.</li>
      <li>The REAL Creed sticks to me all day long and is undeniable.</li>
      <li>No imitation or fakery.</li>
      <li>And this was a better price than what we&#x27;ve paid in department stores for the same product, so I&#x27;m thrilled to save a few dollars on a very expensive item.</li>
      <li>It lasts barely 30 minutes when used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I love this scent and the small store I used to get it from closed.</li>
      <li>The one purchased here smells the same, but the smell quickly fades away after a few minutes.  </li>
      <li>The third bottle looked okay until I opened the box and saw that the usual Creed picture card was replaced with a green paper insert written in Arabic.</li>

<li> Keep in mind Creed has changed their sprayers on the newr Aventus and Green Irish Tweed as I bought 2 bottles from Nieman Marcus to compare to and one had the new spayer and was informed its brand new from creed and is supposed to leak less than the mammoth spayers...</li>
<li> I used to buy Creed in Europe before this purchase, as I was living there for the previous 5 years and that´s where I discovered this fragrance.  </li>
<li> No wrapper round the pack, the bottom of the bottle had nothing written on it.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve had a few bottles of Creed.</li>
<li> Very hard to describe, go and sample it</li>
<li> Buyer beware they are selling fake Creed.  </li>
<li> It was delivered and i found out it was fake.</li>

    <li> I do like this cologne it does have a good vibe per say, but it doesn&#x27;t last at least compare to Adventus which is my favorite from the house of creed (maybe do to the fact that is like pheromones to my wife lol). I do recommend whoever trying a sampler before purchasing though!&lt;br /&gt;Bought direct from amazon so far thing is legit.</li>

    <li> I used to buy Creed in Europe before this purchase, as I was living there for the previous 5 years and that´s where I discovered this fragrance.  The one purchased here smells the same, but the smell quickly fades away after a few minutes.  My wife can´t even smell it on me after an hour or two.  In comparison to the ones I bought in Europe everyone, including her, gave me compliments throughout the day.</li>
    <li> Creed is ten times better at this price especially when its legit! Keep in mind Creed has changed their sprayers on the newr Aventus and Green Irish Tweed as I bought 2 bottles from Nieman Marcus to compare to and one had the new spayer and was informed its brand new from creed and is supposed to leak less than the mammoth spayers... This product has the old creed sprayer thats huge still..</li>
    <li> But it&#x27;s for me!!  Love love love Creed...but definitely don&#x27;t like the pricetag.  Amazon came through on this one.  Can&#x27;t beat this price at all... One of my most favorite scents.  #shedidthat</li>
    <li> Buyer beware they are selling fake Creed.  The REAL Creed sticks to me all day long and is undeniable. This version has worn off before I get in the car good</li>
    <li> Perfect and cheapest place to buy! Use it every day and get compliments all the time.  My husband wears it too!</li>
    <li> Great product!! No imitation or fakery. Excellent service and will be coming back to buy more.</li>
    <li> This is a great price for Creed.  The Silver Mountain Water&#x27;s fragrance is fresh and clean and wonderfully for both women and men.</li>
    <li> I have about 20 colognes and this one is my 2nd favorite. I imagine Adam himself wore this in the Garden. Some people call this one Unisex but I don&#x27;t see it. My wife says its not a smell she would wear, but she loves it on me. To me it has a citrus followed by a clean soapy/inky smell. Very hard to describe, go and sample it</li>
    <li> a friend recommended this perfume and i came here to get it. It was delivered and i found out it was fake. No wrapper round the pack, the bottom of the bottle had nothing written on it. It lasts barely 30 minutes when used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i actually bought 3 other perfumes which were okay but i doubt if i will ever buy perfumes from amazon or online again.</li>
    <li> This is one of my all time favorite Creed colognes.  This cologne is masculine, fresh with a soft musk finish that and lasts all day.  I get compliments every time I wear it.</li>
    <li> Creed Silver Mountain Water&lt;br /&gt;sold and procured by Amazon is actually authentic. I have been using this particular Creed Scent for many years now and used to buy it at a flagship Creed retailer. I kept all the bottles of the years and compared not just the scent but also the authenticity of the bottles, packaging, inlays etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Awesome Deal Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I only took a star off my rating, because amazon does not tell you that it is classified as a hazardous material and prime shipping does not apply.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise great buy, highly recommend it if you like this scent.</li>
    <li> Great price for great product! Great gift for men. Best cologne every men would love. Perfect smell not strong very sensual.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve ordered Creed&#x27;s Silver Mountain Water three times. The first two bottles were all right (both supplied by FragranceNet), with the correct scent, bottle, and packaging. The third bottle looked okay until I opened the box and saw that the usual Creed picture card was replaced with a green paper insert written in Arabic. Then I discovered that the liquid was just alcohol, without any trace of Silver Mountain Water&#x27;s fragrance. This bottle was sold by Amazon, not a marketplace seller, so beware that some old gray-market bottles are being sold by Amazon, and they are not returnable.</li>
    <li> My wife and I picked up Creed in Paris years ago. It was unheard of over here and they used to have one or 2 specialty fragrance shops. I think the first one I got was Irish Tweed. The amount of compliments it generated was amusing, because it was virtually unknown in the states. It almost became a Seinfeld like joke explaining the name and no you can&#x27;t get it around here...&lt;br /&gt;Every time we were in Paris we would get a couple more, settling on Silver Mountain water and Millesime Imperial as our favorites. The nice thing about the shops in Paris was they would load you up with testers. One of the assistants in the office would always compliment how great it smelled and how she wanted to get it for her husband. At this time they were more available in the states but for the down payment of and arm. She said she found it here and I needed a refill (Paris this summer?) it is the real deal. A great buy and you will love it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had a few bottles of Creed. This is the second I&#x27;ve bought through amazon. Saved a lot on it. It is definitely authentic.</li>
