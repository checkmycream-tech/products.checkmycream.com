      <li>More lotion on the floor than on my back.</li>
      <li>I am now able to reach parts of my back that I couldn&#x27;t before using this creamer.  </li>
      <li>It makes it so easy to put lotion on my back.</li>
      <li>I really like this and the only reason I gave it a four rather than a five is the fact that I have not found or used a moisturizer lotion that freely flows through the rollers.  </li>
      <li>The lotion doesn&#x27;t really come out a lot</li>
      <li>The Body-creamer worked very well.</li>
      <li>Now it is so much easier to put lotion on.</li>
      <li>Also, it helps to gently slap it against your hand before using it.</li>
      <li>but  its still very sturdy and hasnt caused any problems at all</li>
      <li>what else do you really need.</li>
      <li>I had wondered if it would really work or not</li>
      <li>&lt;br /&gt;if tightened too much.  </li>
      <li>While I am trying to find one (and may have thanks to another user&#x27;s review)</li>
      <li>Simply squirt your favorite skin lotion directly onto the plastic balls and apply to the skin.</li>
      <li>The lotion will go on your skin smoothly and it is easy to spread evenly on your back and other difficult-to-reach areas.</li>
      <li>Requires occasional clean up.&lt;br /&gt;Great way to apply lotioin, for those who live alone.</li>
      <li>This is well worth the extra money because it lasts so much longer.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend.</li>
      <li>Highly recommended.</li>
      <li>I have bought other types and they tend to fall apart too easily.</li>
      <li>I had to laugh at myself at how long it took me to figure out how to put this product together.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s much sturdier and better made, and the applicator doesn&#x27;t have the rough edge like other one.</li>
      <li>This makes applying lotion to back so much easier.</li>
      <li>My sister wants one and will likely purchase another for her birthday.</li>
      <li>i couldn&#x27;t sleep at night,this tool can cover the whole back.</li>
      <li>Works so far.  </li>
      <li>Her skin is extremely sensitive and she uses this all the time</li>
      <li>No more dry skin on my back now silky smooth!</li>
      <li>I live in the northeast and my skin becomes so dry in the winter.</li>
      <li>I have a similar &amp;#34;gadget&amp;#34; that I use to apply lotion to my back and it is getting old and cracked</li>
      <li>at 15-20$ it does not last near long enough.</li>
      <li>My back no longer itches from the dry indoor heat and winter cold thanks to  being able to rub lotion on it.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I love this and I use for my back every day after my shower. It makes it so easy to put lotion on my back.</li>
    <li> AWFUL. bought this because it was advertised as better than the cheaper models that have the balls fall out after 6 months. the same thing happened with this more expensive product. don&#x27;t waster your money.</li>
    <li> This actually works as described was a little sceptical But it does work. Lotion that is stored inside doesn&#x27;t Leak either</li>
    <li> Works so far.  Replacement for one received last year.  Last years broke after six months.  Balls fall out and cannot be put back</li>
    <li> When you don&#x27;t have a partner around to help moisturize the back you can&#x27;t reach, this thing is a winter dream. Very well made, much sturdier than less expensive products and actually works! We use Moisturell which appears to be the perfect consistancy. Thick enough to stay in the chambers and fluid enough to flow smoothly.&lt;br /&gt;Been using for several months now and am very satisfied.</li>
    <li> Works. A bit hard against delicate skin.</li>
    <li> The only problem is that when it falls on the floor, the cream compartment opens and the cream spills. Other than that, great.</li>
    <li> Just stop looking right now and buy this wand and applicator ok!!! I already did all the research, and have tried multiple products, and my search is over, super sturdy, smooth even application and easy to care for!! what else do you really need.</li>
    <li> Balls fall out after time and the can be messy if used as directed.  We put lotion on our backs and then rub in with body creamer.  Just awkward to use.</li>
    <li> Gas heating and air conditioning can leave your skin dehydrated and itchy.  The Hydras Euro lets you get lubrication in hard to get to places.  It has a sturdy construction an is easily filled..</li>
    <li> This is what I have been wishing for over the years. I can now get lotion on those previously unreachable back areas. Before this, my back would get so itchy from the dry winter air. This definitely helps.</li>
    <li> It works as described... just keep the reservoir full of cream. Also, it helps to gently slap it against your hand before using it.</li>
    <li> Did as advertised. Only problem is getting to the lower middle back for a person that has a problem bending their elbows.</li>
    <li> I like being able to put lotion on my own back.  But you cannot fill the inside of the applicator with the lotion.  It will not come out onto the skin.  I add the lotion on the outside of the rollers and it works well.</li>
    <li> Unlike many of the cheaper and flimsier lotion applicators you can get at retail outlets, this one is strong and durable and works like a charm. Great quality and well worth the price because you will never have to buy another appliactor.</li>
    <li> Disappointed. The lotion would never come out. The applicator fell apart when I applied pressure necessary for the lotion to disperse. More lotion on the floor than on my back.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used these type of body lotion applicators before, but this one beats the other ones I&#x27;ve owned.  It feels solid in my hand while using it and I can feel the lotion being applied evenly.  I recommend this wholeheartedly.</li>
    <li> Works great! So easy to use and it does the job easily and fast! No more dry skin on my back now silky smooth!</li>
    <li> I ordered this as I have shingles and Sjogren&#x27;s Syndrome Disorder.  I works great to reach those areas on my back that I can not reach by hand.</li>
    <li> Spreads the lotion surprisingly well with little effort. I plan to also use it for sunscreen application at the beach this summer.</li>
    <li> This little gadget has saved my shoulder.  I am now able to reach parts of my back that I couldn&#x27;t before using this creamer.  It&#x27;s a great invention.  I spray my moisturizer onto the head every use instead of filling the inside with cream.  That way it&#x27;s fresh all the time and I don&#x27;t have to refill.</li>
    <li> I have a similar &amp;#34;gadget&amp;#34; that I use to apply lotion to my back and it is getting old and cracked so I ordered this one to have on hand when the other one completely bites the dust.  I would recommend this to anyone who would like to apply lotion to their back.</li>
    <li> After buying the American version every year (as it keeps breaking) I went&lt;br /&gt;for the German made one. What a difference! Worth the money and so&lt;br /&gt;sturdy. The plastic is thick enough not to crack and the tiny balls aren&#x27;t falling&lt;br /&gt;out all the time. Definitely German engineering at it&#x27;s best.</li>
    <li> This is especially great when you have no one around to do the job for you.</li>
    <li> Got this for myself. I have dry skin and needed help putting lotion on itchy back. It is well made and I think it will last. Lotion sometimes get clogged but with a few taps it comes back out. Purchased another for a gift too.</li>
    <li> Overall this is a good product, it works well. This is my second purchase of the same thing. The only negative is that the point of connection between the two pieces is rather weak and will break over time after repeated uses. This is the reason for my second purchase. After receiving the second unit, I have reinforced this weak point with two pieces of metal to hopefully prevent future breakage. I like the product but this weakness prevents me from giving a 5 star rating. I would recommend it to a friend with a warning of this shortcoming.</li>
    <li> This thing works great,it feels good on your back and still works..My back would itch so bad i couldn&#x27;t sleep at night,this tool can cover the whole back.Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I used to have the &amp;#34;as seen on TV&amp;#34; version of this applicator, and this one is SO MUCH better. It&#x27;s much sturdier and better made, and the applicator doesn&#x27;t have the rough edge like other one. This is well worth the extra money because it lasts so much longer. I&#x27;m so glad I tried it.</li>
    <li> Constantly clogged despite cleaning with each use, even with thinner lotions. Too much trouble to use. Buy the one with removable and extra applicator pads. Those stick to holder with Velcro and wash easily with soap and water.</li>
    <li> Best invention ever!  I immediately ordered another one for a single friend who has raved about it.  I was going to invent this myself but someone beat me to it.</li>
    <li> I had to laugh at myself at how long it took me to figure out how to put this product together.Seriously it&#x27;s only three pieces! But a combination of no English (or Spanish, I could&#x27;ve worked with Spanish!) directions and being sick it took me a little bit of time to get it together.&lt;br /&gt;Once I got it together though, I love this product! I can get that dry spot in the center of my back and I have yet to somehow break it!</li>
    <li> I used to have a lotion applicator &amp; I have been wanting another one.  This one works fine.  The balls have not gotten stuck yet, the lotion stays \\&quot;fresh\\&quot; inside, &amp; it reaches all the way down my back.</li>
    <li> This is a nice product.  Works so well for my back and legs.  It&#x27;s&lt;br /&gt;easy to fill.  The cream does not come out very heavy so I go over&lt;br /&gt;the area a few times.  You do have to be careful not to over-tighten&lt;br /&gt;cream dispenser.  Some cream does get on the threads and when you&lt;br /&gt;tighten it tends to slip.  It could easily crack or break the container&lt;br /&gt;if tightened too much.  It is a sturdy construction over-all.  Very&lt;br /&gt;happy with it.</li>
    <li> Yep, been months now and still loving this, I really still cant believe how well this lays a even layer on, I actually thought it wouldnt but I am so very happy with this product, I use it with sombra warm and its perfect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Review update, October 13, 2013.&lt;br /&gt;No longer happy with this product, after about 7 months from purchase the balls started falling out  during use. If it was cheaper it would be worth it for 6 months as when it worked it was great but at 15-20$ it does not last near long enough.</li>
    <li> I live in the northeast and my skin becomes so dry in the winter. I always use body lotion but could never reach my back. Now it is so much easier to put lotion on. I love this product.</li>
    <li> I would recommend it to anyone! I have used it several times a day on my dry back when it is needed.</li>
    <li> The Hydas Euro Body-creamer is built better and works better than cheaper models. For those who complain about the body lotion drying out in the reservoir, the simple solution is to not use the reservoir at all. Simply squirt your favorite skin lotion directly onto the plastic balls and apply to the skin. The lotion will go on your skin smoothly and it is easy to spread evenly on your back and other difficult-to-reach areas. The only caveat is that you want to a use lotion which has the consistency of Curel or similar products.</li>
    <li> I wish I had found  this years ago.  It is just as described.  My back no longer itches from the dry indoor heat and winter cold thanks to  being able to rub lotion on it.  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> The Body-creamer worked very well. At the time of the purchase, I only had body cream to add to the lotion reservoir of the Body-creamer. This did not work as well and I bought lotion to replace the cream. The thinner consistency of the lotion allowed the Body-creamer to work as designed. The rolling balls allow for just the right amount of lotion to be applied.There is no dripping or clogging. I plan on buying more as qifts.</li>
    <li> Larger than I would like, but works well. My sister wants one and will likely purchase another for her birthday.</li>
    <li> This makes applying lotion to back so much easier. Very sturdy and easy to use. I have bought other types and they tend to fall apart too easily. Glad I found this style.</li>
    <li> its great im a big guy its a hard to reach spot because i&#x27;m not that flexible it works great for me.</li>
    <li> I sent this to my friend who has tried a large variety of lotion dispensers and wasn&#x27;t happy.  My father has one so I ordered this for her.  She is extremely delighted with it.  Her skin is extremely sensitive and she uses this all the time and she loves it.  Based on what she has said I would say it is perfect for dispensing lotion, especially for seniors.</li>
    <li> This works great, puts on just the right amount of lotion and no leakage when stored.  I&#x27;ve had two friends over that saw me use it and now they&#x27;ve both ordered one.</li>
    <li> This is so well made and easy to use. I live in a cold dry part of the country and this works so well that I no longer have dry itchy skin on my back. Well worth the good price.</li>
    <li> I am extremely pleased with this product. I had another version that seemed to fall apart every time I used it. This one does not. All pieces fit snugly together. No more lotion falling on the floor!</li>
    <li> Great product for applying lotion on any part of the body.  Don&#x27;t overload the applicator!  Requires occasional clean up.&lt;br /&gt;Great way to apply lotioin, for those who live alone. 😊</li>
    <li> I really like this and the only reason I gave it a four rather than a five is the fact that I have not found or used a moisturizer lotion that freely flows through the rollers.  While I am trying to find one (and may have thanks to another user&#x27;s review) I put some lotion on the outside on the rollers and then use.  That is a temp fix but it works.  Waiting to try the moisturizer the other user suggested.</li>
    <li> The lotion doesn&#x27;t really come out a lot and you don&#x27;t get the moisture you need on your back if it&#x27;s really dry. Also a lot of the lotion crept into the corners and dried up and I had to scrub it. I ended up throwing it out and have seem some of the foam/sponge ones and will get one of those next time.</li>
    <li> I had wondered if it would really work or not and it does!!  It is so nice to have this when I need it for lotion and will be great when I need to use sunscreen!!  I might get a second one just for that!!</li>
    <li> Zvery good product for the money, prob the best product out considering ouroptions for something like this.  handle was 2 piece but wish it wasnt but  its still very sturdy and hasnt caused any problems at all so i really have not a single complaint.  buy it!!!!</li>
    <li> This one works better than the as seen on tv variety.  I think the design will last longer and not break.</li>
    <li> Easy to use.  Have to refill often. Overall good product.  I gifted one to both my dad and step mon.</li>
