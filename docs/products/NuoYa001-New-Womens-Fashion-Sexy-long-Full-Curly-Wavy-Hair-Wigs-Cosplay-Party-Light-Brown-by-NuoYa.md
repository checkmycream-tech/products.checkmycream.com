      <li>I am happy with the purchase and i will buy more wigs again! :)&lt;br /&gt;9/10</li>
      <li>Liked this wig a lot.</li>

      <li>Love it.</li>
      <li>This is so adorable.  </li>
      <li>pieces sticking up under the top layer, but they weren&#x27;t on top or in front, so I just took away one star.  </li>
      <li>but I still love it</li>
      <li>but that&#x27;s okay</li>
      <li>i love everything about it..</li>
      <li>:)</li>
      <li>This is the most beautiful wig I&#x27;ve seen yet, I love how it looks so real, but I don&#x27;t like how long it took to get here.</li>
      <li>I got a free gift with my purchase.</li>
      <li>but i find it incredibly comfortable to wear.</li>
      <li>Mine wasn&#x27;t as curly as the picture, but I loved that it looks so natural.  </li>
      <li>It looks like a wig it dose not look full and dose not look at all what it looks like in picture</li>
      <li>so i ordered this for a cute look with my dresses and outfits and it blends in really well.</li>
      <li>The crimped texture adds volume and makes it look more realistic.</li>
      <li>It does shed quite a bit but it is very pretty.</li>
      <li>Definitely worth buying.</li>
      <li>Its sooo soft I love it.</li>
      <li>but I&#x27;ll rewrite a review to hold up my end of the bargain too its definitely worth the wait if your in Canada it will take about a week longer</li>
      <li>Soft light and full..</li>
      <li>Very soft and easy to brush.</li>
      <li>and the bangs were kind if long</li>
      <li>It looks real when i wear it, doesn&#x27;t come off as a wig at all!</li>
      <li>The seller had gotten back to me many times to try to figure out whatever the issue may be over all</li>
      <li>and it feels real!</li>
      <li>Right color and super soft.</li>
      <li>Super soft and</li>
      <li>super soft but not all curly aome parts are straight n fishy smelling need to perfume it to cover that smell.</li>
      <li>fast shipping</li>
      <li>But not as much volume as seen in the pictures.</li>
      <li>everyone thinks its real</li>
      <li>It was supoosed to be all real hair turns put</li>
      <li>Was really poofy and made me look like a lioness.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s really close to the photo</li>
      <li>Looks very simliar to real hair.</li>
      <li>I love the wig, it is the same color as my natural hair</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s super soft and realistic looking.  </li>
      <li>way better than expected, and nobody realized it was a wig!</li>
      <li>the wig has realistic scalp imitation on the top of the wig to come as a look of realistic hair.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not overly heavy and bulky, but it is really full and you gotta want to wear your hair big and bold to like this.</li>
      <li>but it will do wearing for a month so far...</li>
      <li>and it looks and feels natural</li>
      <li>Didn&#x27;t really look the same as in the picture.</li>
      <li>it arrived well packaged 8 days after ordering  the wig itself is full,very soft and layered neatly.</li>
      <li>not everyday use</li>
      <li>most of it was synthetic #not happy</li>

    <li> This is so adorable.  It&#x27;s super soft and realistic looking.  Mine wasn&#x27;t as curly as the picture, but I loved that it looks so natural.  It looks like you went to the beach with your hair in braids during the day and then took them out to go dancing at night.  It even has the ends that aren&#x27;t curled, like when you do that.  It did have some pieces that were 1&amp;#34; pieces sticking up under the top layer, but they weren&#x27;t on top or in front, so I just took away one star.  It&#x27;s not overly heavy and bulky, but it is really full and you gotta want to wear your hair big and bold to like this.</li>
    <li> Its the most beautiful wig I have gotten. Its sooo soft I love it.</li>
    <li> The best wig ever! Soft light and full..i love everything about it..its going to be my everyday wig and it looks and feels natural</li>
    <li> super soft but not all curly aome parts are straight n fishy smelling need to perfume it to cover that smell. a bit disapponting</li>
    <li> Liked this wig a lot. The crimped texture adds volume and makes it look more realistic. It&#x27;s really long and I like it a lot.</li>
    <li> This wig is ok.. not the best but it will do wearing for a month so far...hair falls out like crazy. It&#x27;s sheds like crazy. I wouldn&#x27;t buy this again.</li>
    <li> This wig is absolutely amazing! It&#x27;s really close to the photo and it feels real! It&#x27;s so soft, it is a little shiny but that&#x27;s okay and the bangs were kind if long so I trimmed them up. Definitely worth buying. It&#x27;s also decently thick.</li>
    <li> Right color and super soft. But not as much volume as seen in the pictures.</li>
    <li> I love the wig, it is the same color as my natural hair but i have short hair so i ordered this for a cute look with my dresses and outfits and it blends in really well. It looks real when i wear it, doesn&#x27;t come off as a wig at all! the wig has realistic scalp imitation on the top of the wig to come as a look of realistic hair. This wig is really nice but the bad part is the fact it sheds a little but it is gorgeous. I don&#x27;t have photos to show but i find it incredibly comfortable to wear. I got a free gift with my purchase. :) Takes awhile to ship but the seller put everything in a little brown box. I am happy with the purchase and i will buy more wigs again! :)&lt;br /&gt;9/10</li>
    <li> This is the most beautiful wig I&#x27;ve seen yet, I love how it looks so real, but I don&#x27;t like how long it took to get here.</li>
    <li> Hats off to the maker/seller!!! fast shipping it arrived well packaged 8 days after ordering  the wig itself is full,very soft and layered neatly. This is a beautiful wig THANK YU</li>
    <li> way better than expected, and nobody realized it was a wig!</li>
    <li> Perfect. Just like the picture. Super soft and because it&#x27;s wavy u can brush it without the worry if brushing anything out.</li>
    <li> Very soft and easy to brush.</li>
    <li> Looks very simliar to real hair. It almost matches my color perfect. Though the bangs are kinda long debating on cutting them.</li>
    <li> It looks like a wig it dose not look full and dose not look at all what it looks like in picture it&#x27;s good for just Halloween not everyday use</li>
    <li> It was supoosed to be all real hair turns put most of it was synthetic #not happy</li>
    <li> Love it. The only thing I don&#x27;t like is that it shed but I still love it</li>
    <li> I just received this wig today. Taking it out of the packaging I thought it was going to be super thin. It came in a very small box and was wrapped in bubble wrap. I brushed it out when I took it out and it definitely has volume. It does shed quite a bit but it is very pretty. The bangs are super long but it doesn&#x27;t look bad like the last wig I bought. None of the netting seems to be visible unless I clip the bangs to the side. The top looks good too. Doesn&#x27;t look fake at all. It&#x27;s a little shiny but hairspray seems to fix that. Only complaint is the shedding.</li>
    <li> I had given negative feed back before even getting the wig due to me being a little impatient .. The seller had gotten back to me many times to try to figure out whatever the issue may be over all I am very happy with the wig looks great and everyone thinks its real I told the seller I&#x27;d delete my negative feed back once I got my wig I don&#x27;t know how to but I&#x27;ll rewrite a review to hold up my end of the bargain too its definitely worth the wait if your in Canada it will take about a week longer then it says however the seller will explain great communication and happy with the quality especially for that price !!</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t really look the same as in the picture. Was really poofy and made me look like a lioness. I guess if I had intentions on wearing it with a costume, I would have loved it; but no. :--(</li>
